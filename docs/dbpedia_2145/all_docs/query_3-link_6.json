        "text": "Marian names\n\nBaby name consultation: Mary, family, strength, beauty, and nickname options for baby no. 3’s name\n\nHappy Monday! There are a bunch of holy people celebrated today — some that jumped out at me are two popes (Pope St. Adrian III and Bl. Pope Eugene III), St. Morwenna, and St. Sunniva of Bergen.\n\nPlease remember that as of July 2 (as I wrote in the post that day), I’m suspending consultations indefinitely due to various things going on in my life (all good!). I will continue to post consultations I’ve already done for those families who want public posts, and I have some birth announcements and other things to post this summer as well; I also always keep you all in my prayers! 🩷🩷🩷\n\nToday’s consultation is for Annelise and her husband, who are expecting their third baby very soon! This little one is a green bean (=gender unknown) 🌱 and joins big sibs:\n\nMariana Catharine (“She is named after both my mother and great grandmother – both Catharina Maria – with her own unique twist on the family tradition. Mariana also catches my husbands paternal grandmother Mary and mine and my MIL’s middle name, Marie. I love that her name is not only three of my favorite saints, Mary, Anne and Catherine, but also so deeply rooted in our family and Austrian heritage on my mom’s side. She chose her own nickname – Mari. Which suits her perfectly! If she had been a boy, she would have been James William“)\n\nHenry James (“While I was pregnant with him, he came to me in a dream and told me his name. When I woke up, I very excitedly told my husband I met our baby and not only is it a boy but he told me his name. Every fiber of my being knew we had to go with this name for him. When he was finally born, holding him was surreal because he was absolutely the same baby as in my dream. His name carries a lot of family significance on my husband’s side. My husband is named after his grandfather Hale James [“Jim”], who was named after his father James Hale. My husband loves that our Henry has the same initials [HJB] as his grandfather, who passed not long before Henry was born. While Henry the 8th gives the name some bad PR, there are a few wonderful Saint Henry’s we love! And James goes without saying. We love the nickname Hank and our Henry really brings it to life. He is all things boy, tough and wild! If he had been a girl, he would have been Lillian Alexandra“)\n\nMariana Catharine and Henry James are such attractive combos and I love that they have faith and family significance. Mari and Hank are such sweet sibling names!\n\nAnnelise writes,\n\n“For this baby, I’ve been feeling my heart connect to only one name – Maddalena. Which is both wonderful and challenging. I love that this name, like Mariana, has so much familiarity to it and yet is very unique. It sounds both new and old at the same time. It’s a beautiful connection to Mary Magdalene, who’s feast day is in July, and is full of nickname potential! The cons are that my husband isn’t a big fan. His worries are that it is too long, too easily misspelled and worries if it is too similar to Mariana. He would prefer the more common, Madeline.\n\nWhen it comes to boy names, we love the idea of using my husband’s middle name as the middle name. Christopher is also my husband’s father’s middle name. Unfortunately, we have not been able to agree on a first name we both like that works well with Christopher. So we aren’t fully committed to this idea.\n\nStylistically, I am drawn to romantic, lyrical names for girls and regal, traditional names for boys. I care very little about how popular a name is and actually prefer, especially for girls, more unique names with strength, beauty and nickname options. I love when a name has deep religious significance, family and personal ties. My own name is Annelise Marie. I grew up with a unique name and nickname (Lissi) and loved it. I love that it calls to Saints Anne, Elizabeth and Mary. My own name has that unique but sounds familiar feel that Mariana and Maddalena have.\n\nMy husband, however, is drawn to names that sound very familiar and aren’t too exotic. He would happily choose from the 25 most popular names in the US, while I read those as a list of names to avoid, particularly for girls! lol He is on board with using first and middle saint names.”\n\nSome names that Annelise likes include:\n\nDiana\n\nLouisa/Louise\n\nCecilia\n\nElisa\n\nGeorge\n\nOwen\n\nOtto\n\nMichael\n\nCharles\n\nSome names her husband likes include:\n\nCecilia\n\nCharlotte\n\nDelaney\n\nMackenzie\n\nMichaela\n\nJohn/Jack\n\nCharles\n\nSome family names that might be nice to include are:\n\nGeorge\n\nWilliam\n\nJohn\n\nMichael\n\nQuinn (could be for boy or girl)\n\nSaints they love include:\n\nSt. Padre Pio\n\nSt. Anne\n\nSt. Mary Magdalene\n\nSt. Clare\n\nSt. Teresa\n\nSt. Azelie\n\nSome additional considerations:\n\n“Mary has always been my guiding force. I feel profoundly called by her and close to her. Some of her titles I love are Our lady of the Mystical Rose, Our Lady of Guadalupe, Queen of Heaven, Queen of All Saints.\n\nHard no list: While we both love Charles, we simply can’t do it with our last name.\n\n[Annelise’s grandfather recently passed.] His passing was expected … but has not come easily. He was an extraordinary man and so well loved by his family.\n\nI think it would be wonderful to honor him somehow in naming this baby.” His full name included Floyd, Eldo, and Quinn.\n\nAdditionally, Annelise shared a portion of her family tree with me, which I had such fun looking through — so many great names on there!\n\nI also really loved hearing the names Annelise and her husband would have given each of their older kiddos if they’d been the opposite sex — James William and Lillian Alexandra give a good sense of their style. I know some people consider the names their children would have been named to be off limits going forward — I’m assuming that’s how they feel?\n\nAs for the names they’re considering, I’d love to offer my thoughts in case they’re helpful:\n\nMaddalena: This is, indeed, a gorgeous name! I like how Annelise characterized it as “both new and old at the same time,” and I love that St. Mary Magdalene’s feast is in the month she’s due. I would love to help figure out a name in her honor that Annelise and her hubby both like! I’m interested that he thinks it’s too similar to Mariana — I’m sorry to say that I had a similar thought when I first read it, especially because the “r” in Mariana would sound more like a “d” for Spanish speakers, which is something I think of because we have a large population of Spanish speakers where I live. But that may not be their situation, which would certainly make Maddalena less problematic from that perspective. If we put aside for just a second the fact that Annelise has “been feeling [her] heart connect to only” Maddalena as a first name (which is definitely an important consideration!), some possible solutions or compromises between you and your husband could be:\n\nMaddalena as a middle name: Moving Maddalena to the middle spot could make Annelise’s hubby feel more okay with them using this form that she prefers. If they did so, they could use a first name that they both agree upon and really just leave Maddalena as the seldom-seen middle name, or they could incorporate Maddalena into the everyday call name. For this family, my favorite idea would be Mary Maddalena. It’s an old but traditional practice in several Catholic cultures (Irish, French, Spanish, Italian) for every daughter in a family to have a form of Mary as their first name, even if they exclusively go by their middles. Considering that Mariana already has a Marian first name, they could consider Mary Maddalena as their second baby’s given name (first + middle), and call her by a nickname of Maddalena. If you used Lena, there’s no issue at all with Mariana and Maddalena being similar — Mari and Lena are great together! You could also do something Rose Maddalena and do a mashup nickname from the first + middle like Romy or Reina.\n\nA different form: Maddalena and Madeline are sort of the two ends of the spectrum regarding the names to honor this Saint. I wonder if something more in the middle would be agreeable to them both? I’m thinking Magdalene (or Magdalen, Magdalyn) — it’s not as familiar as Madeline but not as potentially problematic as Maddalena (especially in terms of not being as similar to Mariana). It also has more of a surname feel, like Delaney and Mackenzie on Annelise’s husband’s list. Another option is Magali, which I don’t see often — I knew a woman with this name a long time ago, it’s the Occitan (French) form.\n\nCecilia: Because Annelise and her husband have pretty different lists except for Cecilia, which they both share, Cecilia is definitely high on my list for them! I love it as a sister to Mariana and I love it on its own, but I also love the idea of something like Mary Cecilia as mentioned above.\n\nLouisa/Louise: Both lovely names, but they made me think of two other names that I would think of as a closer match for this family: Lucia for a girl and Louis for a boy. I wonder what they would think of those?\n\nDiana: I find this one surprising! But when I consider that Annelise prefers “regal” names for boys, Diana makes sense. I don’t love that it has the same ending as Mariana though.\n\nElisa: This is one of my favorites for this family because of its connection to Annelise’s name! I love that Mariana has “ana” like her Anne, and using Elisa for her second daughter would give both her girls a nice connection to her. Because she likes “romantic and lyrical” names for girls, including the very Italian Maddalena, I wonder what she would think of the Italian form of Elizabeth, Elisabetta? Elisa could still be the nickname.\n\nCharlotte: Even though Annelise don’t have this on her personal list, Charlotte is a style match for Louisa, and since they both like Charles but can’t use it, maybe Charlotte is a good compromise?\n\nDelaney, Mackenzie: These names Annelise’s husband likes are definitely different from the ones she likes, but they gave me an idea for some that might be good compromises — I’ve included those ideas in my list of “official” suggestions below.\n\nMichaela: I’m interested by Michaela — it can have a Delaney/Mackenzie feel (as in McKayla), but in the spelling Michaela it has a more traditional feel. I’ve actually always loved it and had it on my own list.\n\nChristopher as middle name: I love their tentative plan of using Annelise’s hubby’s middle name for the baby if they have a boy! It’s so meaningful that it’s also her father-in-law’s middle name. Since she said they haven’t been able to agree on a first name they both like that works well with Christopher, I wondered what they’d think of considering Hale as a middle name? It’s a middle name that would clearly be for Annelise’s husband’s side of the family, and it has a totally different sound and rhythm from Christopher, which might mean that it would work well with names that wouldn’t work well with Christopher.\n\nGeorge: This definitely fits into the “regal, traditional” feel Annelise prefers for boys. Georgie is such a fun nickname, and I also love Geo and Geordie.\n\nOwen: I loved seeing Owen three times in Annelise’s family tree! I’m not sure what I think about it for a first name for them, though … it has a different feel from George and Charles, for example … I have always loved St. Nicholas Owen — I could see loving them using it in that way (as a middle name for Nicholas, as a direct nod to that Saint, while also looping in their family name), or as a middle in general.\n\nOtto: Otto is very cool, but this helps me articulate a thought I’ve been trying to formulate: the mix of ethnicities they have represented in their name lists is unexpected, especially given their very English surname. Even though Mariana is listed in Behind the Name as Portuguese, Spanish, Romanian, Czech, Bulgarian, and Ancient Roman, I think it, and similar names like Juliana, have been used enough that they don’t come across as obviously ethnic. Maddalena, however, is clearly Italian, and if then if they add in Owen, which has a more Irish feel, and especially Otto, which has a very German feel, people who pay attention to names might take notice. I know Annelise has German and Austrian ancestry, so Otto totally makes sense for them! I guess I’m feeling like Otto calls names like Maddalena into question more, which I’m not sure they want to do. Or maybe it doesn’t matter to them! And it doesn’t have to necessarily! (** ETA: Annelise subsequently shared with me that she had a very international upbringing, which has definitely informed her taste in names. So cool! **)\n\nMichael: Michael on Annelise’s list and Michaela on her husband’s is interesting … Michael is certainly solid, handsome, and saintly for a boy!\n\nCharles: I’m so bummed that they both love Charles but they can’t use it! I wonder if the variants Carlo (like for Bl. Carlo Acutis — soon to be St. Carlo!) or Karol (St. JP2’s birth name) appeal to them?\n\nJohn/Jack: John with the nickname Jack seems like a perfect name for this family. John has the “regal, traditional” feel that Annelise prefers, and Jack feels like her husband’s style. John is probably my top choice for this family of the names Annelise and her hubby are considering! It also has the amazing quality of going well with all kinds of middle names — it can serve to “normalize” the more out-there middle names, too, in the same way that I’ve always thought Mary as a first name does for girl names. When I was looking through Annelise’s family tree and saw a relative named John George, I immediately loved John George as a combo for them! But I also love John Christopher! And John Pio! And John Charles! I think John Christopher nicknamed Jack is what I would recommend — it seems like a name that hits all the right notes (family, faith, and a name that both Annelise and her husband are likely to like).\n\nWilliam: I really love names that work to honor both sides of the family!\n\nQuinn: I love Quinn as a possible middle name! I’m not as much of a fan of it for a first name for them — if they were doing all Owen-type names, then yes, definitely Quinn! But with Maddalena and Otto in the mix as well, I would prefer Quinn in the middle. George O’Quinn, John O’Quinn, William Quinn, and I love Mary Quinn for a girl (sounds like Mary, Queen)! This is a nice, easy way to honor both Annelise’s mom and her grandfather.\n\nSpeaking of, I want to spend a minute talking about Annelise’s grandfather specifically and her family tree more generally — I have so many ideas to share! First off: her beloved grandpa. I had so much fun thinking about his name! I looked it up to see if the meanings of any of his names might be helpful, and Behind the Name says Floyd is a variant of Lloyd, which means “grey.” Grey! What a cool name! I think it could work for a boy (for a first or middle) or a girl (probably more as a middle — the new Hunger Games book/movie has Lucy Gray Baird as one of the main characters, and she goes by the double Lucy Gray, so I wouldn’t do that that combo [though I love it!], but Maddalena Grey is a very intriguing combo!) But only if Annelise was sure to feel like her grandpa was represented in a meaningful way if Grey was used somehow!\n\nThen, Eldo: I’m so intrigued by Eldo! It’s kind of a mystery name! It’s not in Behind the Name’s database (I consider Behind the Name to be the most trustworthy in terms of name meaning, origin, etc.) so I had to venture out into sites of questionable reputation and found that it could be of Aramaic origin via South India meaning “birth of Christ” (source, source) (would be cool if Annelise or her hubby had any ties to India in their family!), or it could be of Spanish/Galician/Portuguese origin meaning “happy, joyful” (source). Both of those meanings are amazing! They inspired some of my suggestions below. Also, Christopher could nod to Eldo if they accept the “birth of Christ” meaning!\n\nThen, further in Annelise’s family tree, I found some really lovely names and combos, some of which also inspired some ideas below. It was cool to see Cecilia — a name they both love, and it’s also a family name! Regina is a middle name for one of her ancestors, which means “queen” and has a long, impeccable tradition of being used for Catholic girls in honor of Our Lady. It could be used in honor of Queen of Heaven and Queen of All Saints, as Annelise noted she loves those titles. Other variants include the Spanish Reina (RAY-na) and the French Reine (REN). Could be cool for a middle name! Ooooh and I’m just thinking, they could use Reina as a mashup-type nickname for Rose/Rosa Maddalena, which would get Mystical Rose, St. Mary Magdalene, and any of Our Lady’s titles as Queen in one name! Gah! I’m loving that idea!\n\nSpeaking of Marian titles, Annelise said that some of her titles that she most likes are Mystical Rose, Our Lady of Guadalupe, Queen of Heaven, and Queen of All Saints. I wonder if she would ever consider Rosa Mystica as a first + middle combo? Any of the Rose names could honor that title (Rose, Rosa, Rosemary, Rosalie), and could also honor Our Lady of Guadalupe, too. They’re considering John for a boy, which could also nod to Our Lady of Guadalupe because of St. Juan Diego (Juan is the Spanish form of John). And I already mentioned some ways of working in “queen” (Regina, Reina, Reine), but the “of heaven” part could be fun to play with: Regina Caeli is “Queen of Heaven” in Latin, with Caeli said like CHAY-lee — I’ve seen some families name daughters Caeli (first name) in honor of this title. Celeste means “heavenly,” so that could work too: Regina Celeste, Reina Celeste, Celeste Regina. Annelise and her hubby both like Cecilia, and the very similar Celia, which can work as a nickname for Cecilia but is also its own name with separate etymology, means “heaven” — maybe that? Celia Regina, or mixing it up to something like Celia Rose or Celia Rosemary, could be lovely and meaningful from a Marian perspective.\n\nOkay! On to new ideas! As noted, I was inspired by Annelise’s family tree, and I also did my usual research, looking up Mariana as well as the names they’re considering in the Baby Name Wizard (affiliate link) as it lists, for each entry, boy and girl names that are similar in terms of style/feel/popularity. I really tried to harness a “romantic, lyrical” feel for girl names and a “regal, traditional” feel for boy names. Based on all that, these are my ideas:\n\nGirl\n\n(1) Elena\n\nThis idea was inspired by a couple things. I didn’t think of it until I saw Annelise’s ancestor Helen Regina in her family tree, and thought that was such a beautiful combo! Helen didn’t seem quite right for this family, though, nor Helena or Helene, but the variant Elena seems perfect! Then I realized that Elena has the same sound as the end of Maddalena, so maybe Elena could be a good compromise between A. and her husband! (They lose the St. Mary Magdalene connection, but they could make up for it with a variant of Mary somewhere: Maria Elena, Mary Elena, Elena Marie, etc.) If they like the idea of mirroring the full Helen Regina combo, Elena Regina and Elena Reine would both do nicely.\n\n(2) Natalia, Natalina, Noel(le)\n\nThis was originally inspired by the possible meaning of Eldo being “birth of Christ,” since the Natalie and Noel names literally refer to Christmas Day. Then I saw Natalia in the BNW as a style match for Mariana! Like Mariana, Natalia is very pan-European, having usage in lots of different countries and languages. I couldn’t help but notice that a specific Italian variant is Natalina, which nearly rhymes with Maddalena (depending how you say the “lena” part), but might provide enough differentiation from Mariana that Annelise’s husband would be okay with it? Then of course Noel and Noelle. They could certainly consider them for the first name spot, but I feel like they’d be a more natural fit for them in the middle spot.\n\n(3) Matilda\n\nAnnelise has an ancestor named Mary Matilda, which I loved right away! Matilda is also a style match for Louisa on her list! It’s a little clunkier than Mariana and Maddalena, but a beautiful name nonetheless with some sweet nickname options.\n\n(4) Stella(maris)\n\nEstella is a match for Louisa, which didn’t feel quite right to me for this family, but made me think Stella might be perfect. Then I found that Henry, Jack, and Charlie are all style matches for Stella! While I love the trimmer Stella, I wondered what they’d think of the fuller Stellamaris? It refers to Our Lady’s title Star of the Sea, and is also seen as Maristella, which I would have suggested in a heartbeat if it wasn’t so similar to Mariana! I also have a friend who named her daughter Stella Marissa as a nod to Our Lady, Stellamaris.\n\n(5) Saintly surname-type names\n\nBecause of the surname-y Delaney and Mackenzie on Annelise’s husband’s list, I wanted to try to think of names that might be similar, but with saintly significance and hopefully a “romantic, lyrical” feel. Avila came immediately to mind — it’s not technically a surname, but serves a similar role in St. Teresa of Avila’s name. Another is Salette, from Our Lady of La Salette — I did a consultation for a family considering Salette (dropping the “La”) and I thought it was brilliant and so pretty. Bessette is another, from St. Andre Bessette, and has the added feature of looking like a French diminutive of Elizabeth. Annelise and her hubby might also like to look through the girls’ names in this family — there’s a definite saintly surname feel in a few of them, like Vianney, Clairvaux, and Lourdes, and all of them done in an ultra-feminine way. (That link goes to the original post I did on them; here [this baby had some scary health issues at birth, in case any of you can’t handle reading that kind of stuff right now!], here, here are birth announcements for subsequent babies. Amazing namers!)\n\nBoy\n\n(1) Edmund\n\nAs soon as I saw Edmund in the list of names similar to Louisa I knew I had to include it on the list! It has that regal, traditional feel I think Annelise is looking for, with lots of nicknames options: Ed, Eddie, Ted, Teddy, Ned. St. Edmund Campion is great! Edmund Christopher is very handsome to me.\n\n(2) Arthur\n\nArthur is a style match for Louise, and again, once I saw it I was like yes! What is more regal and traditional (especially from an English perspective) than Arthur?? I thought they might particularly like a nickname I’ve been seeing for Arthur: Bear, because of Arthur’s possible and mostly accepted meaning of “bear.” (I love the nickname Bear so much that I tried to convince my husband of Benedict Gerard with the nickname Bear for our youngest!) There are several Blesseds with that name. I think this is a name that wouldn’t pair well with Christopher — do you all agree? Arthur Christopher has repeated ending sounds, but some people quite like that. If these parents like Arthur but not Christopher with it, maybe they would consider Arthur Grey? Or, I also really like Hale from Hubby’s family — Arthur Hale is handsome too!\n\n(3) Felix\n\nThis was originally inspired by Eldo’s possible meaning of “happy, joyful,” but then I was excited to see that it’s a match for Otto and Eliza (similar to Elisa). I’ve been seeing some little Felixes here and there, it’s a cool name!\n\n(4) Alexander\n\nI did a quick general search online for “regal” names for boys, just to see if anything jumped out, and Alexander was on the list, which reminded me that Alexandra was going to be Henry’s middle name if he’d been a girl, and I wondered if they’d be interested to switching it to a boy’s name? Alexander is saintly and papal and has some cool nickname options in addition to the familiar Alex like Xander, Zander, and Sander. Sandy is a traditional nickname that isn’t used much anymore, but my boys have a friend named Sandy whose given name is Alexander and I love hearing it.\n\n(5) Bates, Hart\n\nThese last two are taken from Annelise’s family tree, both names that I think are so cool and could work as either first or middle names. Bates is the first: I’ve always loved that Bates is a medieval diminutive of Bartholomew, giving it impeccable faith credentials in an unexpected way.\n\nThe other is Hart: I worked with a doctor a long time ago in a previous career whose son was named Hart — his wife’s maiden name. I loved that! A hart is a male deer (stag), and the “ard” part of names like Gerard and Bernard are actually the Old German element “hart” which means “brave, hardy,” both of which gives it a really masculine spin. I also love that it sounds like “heart,” which gives it an affectionate feel. There’s also this birth announcement I did for parents who named their son Gerhardt and call him Hart. Love, love, love!\n\nAnd those are all my ideas! What do you all think? What names would you suggest for the little sister or brother of Mariana and Henry?\n\nFor help with Marian names, my book, Catholic Baby Names for Girls and Boys: Over 250 Ways to Honor Our Lady (Marian Press, 2018), is available to order from ShopMercy.org and Amazon (not affiliate links). It’s perfect for expectant parents, name enthusiasts, and lovers of Our Lady!\n\nBaby name consultation: floral, literary, possibly Brit, probably not too Italian-y for baby girl’s name\n\nHappy feast of St. Anthony Mary Zaccaria! I hope my American readers had a good 4th of July! Please pray for America! 🗽🙏\n\nBe sure to note that as of July 2 (as I wrote in the post that day), I’m suspending consultations indefinitely due to various things going on in my life (all good!). I will continue to post consultations I’ve already done for those families who want them, and I have some birth announcements and other things to post this summer as well; I also always keep you all in my prayers! 🩷🩷🩷\n\nToday’s consultation is for Jessica and her husband, who are expecting their fourth baby — a girl! Little Miss joins big siblings:\n\nGianna Catherine (“Gianna is my confirmation saint [I converted in college] and also a patron of our family. I knew after learning her story that I would want to name a daughter after her, so once we found out that our first was a girl, that was that! My husband and I met through pro-life work during our college years, and after we married, I pursued a degree in Catholic Bioethics, and Gianna’s patronage covers the whole gamut of issues important to us [the department at the university where I earned my degree was officially christened The St. Gianna School of Health Sciences soon after I graduated]. The middle name Catherine was chosen both for how well it flows with Gianna and also because we wanted to honor St. Catherine of Sienna, another strong Catholic woman who served the Church in an entirely different way than St. Gianna. We mostly call her Gianna or some other non-name-related nicknames, but a lot of relatives call her Gigi or G [we do as well, but not as frequently]“).\n\nDominic Ivan (“To be perfectly honest, the main reason we chose Dominic was that it was one of the only boy names we both liked. I used to joke that we would struggle to name any future boys, but the joke is on me now because we’re having a girl and struggling anyways. But we both liked the name Dominic, and a bonus was the connection to St. Dominic and the Order of Preachers, whose charisms we appreciate. It also paired well with Gianna’s more Italian-style name, and is a fairly common name in Croatia, where my father’s family is from. Ivan is my husband’s grandfather’s name – once I suggested Ivan as a middle name, my husband really liked the idea and that also helped push Dominic to the top. We had been considering some other names like Thomas or Damien, but felt that Dominic Ivan flowed better than the alternative options. We also mostly use his full name, but occasionally shorten it to Dommy (Or Doodle, but I doubt he wants that nickname to follow him into adulthood] 😂”)\n\n+Stella Mercy (“We named our miscarried baby Stella Mercy. We lost her right around the start of Advent, so a star-related name seemed appropriate, and I have always loved the name Mercy. My husband didn’t like the idea of a unisex name [even though we lost her too early to know the sex] but I like to think that her name could also be Stella Clement if, in fact, she was a boy. The meaning would be the same“)\n\nAbsolutely fantastic names!! And two consultations for families with a little Dominic in one week!!😍\n\nJessica writes,\n\n“So this little rainbow baby will be our third here on earth, but our fourth to name. I have always been into baby names, and as a kid I used to read baby name books and make long lists of names – for book characters but also for future children. So now that I’m actually in the baby-naming phase of life, I feel a lot of pressure to pick the perfect names! We both prefer names with strong meaning, or family names. I am also very picky about the cadence of a name, and how well the whole name flows together, as well as just the first/last combo (since that’s what they’ll most often be called). Our last name is very short and choppy. Most single-syllable names are out because they don’t sound good, and any name that ends with D also doesn’t work (I like Marigold and Adelaide but they’re just too clunky with [last name].)\n\nMy husband and I have a decent amount of baby name style overlap, although I am definitely more accepting of unusual or less common names. I tend to throw out a bunch of name ideas and he whittles down our list by vetoing the ones he doesn’t like (like Aveline, Linnea, or Calliope). Our last name is very simple (and boring! – I say that with full agreement of my husband too 😅) so I wouldn’t mind going completely ‘out-there’ with names but my husband is skeptical of names he doesn’t hear super often.”\n\nSounds familiar! 😅\n\nNames they’re considering include:\n\nClara (“this was our top choice for a while but my husband says it’s not clicking as well as he thought it would; it’s a family name on my side and I also really love the connection to St. Clare [who was born Chiara, which is the Italian form of Clara]“)\n\nLydia (“this was our girl name pick when pregnant with Dominic. It’s still one of Hubs’ favorites but I’m not as sure about it anymore, but we love the biblical Lydia and her association with the early Church and hospitality“)\n\nMaisie (“we would use it as a nickname, probably with Mary Therese or Margaret as the full name. Hubs prefers it as a nn for Margaret, but his mom and my grandmother are both Mary, so it feels like it would be a missed opportunity to pick Maisie but not honor the multiple Marys in our lives“)\n\nJosephine (“my husband really likes the nickname Josie, I’m worried it’s too sing-songy with our last name. Also this is nitpicky, but my name is Jessica, and our older daughter is Gianna, so it feels like a lot of repletion of the J/G sounds in all the girls“)\n\nFelicity (“we both like the cadence of the name, and especially the nickname Lissie. The one hang-up we have [and we’re not sure if it’s even a real concern] is that some friends in the area just had a girl in April and named her Felicity. We have no issue with anyone in our circle using the same names as our kids, and we’ve said as much to friends who mentioned liking the names Gianna and Dominic, but I know that not everyone feels the same way about ‘stealing’ baby names and we want to bring it up casually with these friends and see if it would be something that bothered them before we lock anything in“)\n\nAdditional names that Jessica likes but her hubby doesn’t:\n\nAdeline\n\nEmilia\n\nRosalie\n\nViolet\n\nElowen\n\nNames already used in their family (basically a “no” list) include:\n\nJulia\n\nMikayla\n\nEmma\n\nAnna\n\nEllie\n\nCharlotte\n\nAllison\n\nLilly\n\nEmily\n\nElaine\n\nEvelyn (nn. Evie with a long E)\n\nSome final considerations:\n\n“Gianna and Dominic both have saint names (and vaguely Italian names) but we didn’t necessarily intend that as a requirement – so I’m a little worried that we might lock ourselves into a theme if this baby also has a saint name (or a name that’s too Italian sounding I guess). My favorite boy name for the future is Tristan, which is not a saint name, so it’s on my mind, and names like Clara, Lydia, and Maisie seem like a good happy medium – biblical or saint associations without being overtly a saint name. We could easily name future children after saints or not, without anyone ending up being the odd one out.\n\nBaby girl is due in early November, so if there are any late Oct/early Nov feast days that might be relevant, that would be interesting to know! Also we are both very into theology and literature – my husband is a huge LOTR fan (although he still won’t sign off on the name Eowyn 😅). One of the reasons I felt drawn to Maisie early on was the connection to Maisie Ward, a Catholic theologian and writer connected to the Oxford movement in England. I mentioned that my ancestry is mostly Croatian and Italian, but my husband’s ancestry is German and Ukrainian, so we’re open to names more from that region. Also my husband is a big anglophile and probably wishes he lived in England, so we love a good British name too! I know that’s all over the place, but maybe it can help with some inspiration!“\n\nI absolutely love Jessica’s older kiddos’ names! Gianna Catherine, Dominic Ivan, and Stella Mercy (/Clement) are all so beautiful, meaningful, and full of faith significance! I loved reading all the background behind each one.\n\nI laughed over Jessica’s characterization of their family’s surname as “boring” and I tend to fall in the same mindset she has of balancing that kind of thing out by “going completely ‘out there’ with names,” but I also really like how she articulated her husband’s reservations: “skeptical of names he doesn’t hear super often.” That’s one of the best explanations I’ve heard for why so many husbands (in my experience) are reluctant to consider certain names, and also why so many seem stuck on names that their wives describe as being “names of girls they went to high school with.”\n\nI love their list of ideas, and I’ll start by offering my thoughts on each one, in case they’re helpful:\n\nClara: This is a great and less-expected way to nod to St. Clare, a beautiful name! I get, though, that sometimes a name that has been a top contender for a while might start to feel … stale? To one or both parents?\n\nLydia: It sounds like what’s happening with Clara for Jessica’s husband is what’s happening with Lydia for Jessica! It’s a great name, and I loved her explanation of what they love about the name including “her association with the early Church and hospitality.” I’ve also always loved that purple would be a Lydia’s own personal color!\n\nMaisie, Josephine: Okay, I’m putting these two together because I think there might be a solution here that would involve both of these names! Jessica mentioned that her love of Maisie began in part with Maisie Ward; also that her mother-in-law and her grandmother are both Mary; also that Josie LastName sounds too sing-songy to her; also that having another girl’s name start with the J sound seems overmuch. I know Jessica’s husband prefers this as a nickname for Margaret, which I get, since in origin it is a diminutive of Margaret, but I wonder if he — and Jessica — would be open to Mary Josephine nicknamed Maisie, especially when they find out that Maisie Ward’s given name was Mary Josephine?? It seems to bring together/solve all the things Jessica listed! (Except for the Margaret thing, which I am sorry for, but it would allow Jessica’s husband to call their daughter Josie if he wants! Moms and Dads sometimes have different nicknames they use for their kids.)\n\nFelicity: Oh man, I love Felicity for this family! But I also get Jessica’s reservations about using it without making sure that it’s okay with the other family they know! If their friends give their blessing, I really do love Felicity as Gianna’s and Dominic’s sister. If their friends aren’t okay with them using it, I wouldn’t think it’s totally off the table — maybe just shelved for now. You never know what the future brings — that family might move away, or Jessica and her family might, or a few years’ difference in ages between two Felicitys might diffuse any issue.\n\nI’m glad Jessica included the list of names she likes but her husband doesn’t — I was interested by the number of flower names (Marigold, Linnea, Rosalie, Violet) and tried to keep that in mind while working on this. I also love that Jessica’s favorite boy name is Tristan — funny enough, it’s a style match for Dominic according to the Baby Name Wizard book! (affiliate link) And though it’s not a Saint’s name, I did include Tristan in my book of Marian names (not an affiliate link!). This is what I wrote:\n\n“Though Tristan seems to have originated as a variant of the name Drustan, which is unrelated to Our Lady in any way, the Latin word tristis (“sad”) played a role in its evolution from Drustan to Tristan due to the old and well-known tragic story of Tristan and Isolde. Its sad connotations give the name a great connection to Our Lady of Sorrows.” (230)\n\nAlso, I’ve heard before from readers that they don’t want to saddle their children with names that have a tragic connection (whether Our Lady of Sorrows or even the martyrs! [That one surprised me!]), but Theresa wrote a beautiful piece on her choice of Our Lady of Sorrows as her daughter’s patron, in which she wrote:\n\n“This, I think, perfectly illustrates who Our Lady of Sorrows is and a Catholic view of sorrow. It is hope, instead of despair, in the face of tragedy. It is fortitude in the face of upset and chaos. It is trust in the midst of darkness. And it is gratitude in the midst of hardship.”\n\nI love that! So I absolutely love Tristan as a possibility for a future son. I also like Jessica’s thought that Tristan “and names like Clara, Lydia, and Maisie seem like a good happy medium — biblical or saint associations without being overtly a saint name. We could easily name future children after saints or not, without anyone ending up being the odd one out.” In fact, I might suggest characterizing their children’s name style (including Gianna and Dominic) as simply “Catholic,” which removes all pressure to use only Saints’ name and opens up so many other things that can all go together under the style umbrella of “Catholic.”\n\nOkay! On to new ideas! I did my usual research in the Baby Name Wizard, as it lists, for each entry, boy and girl names that are similar in terms of style/feel/popularity — I looked up the names Jessica and her husband have already used and those they like. I loved the extra info about her and her husband’s shared interests in theology and literature (me and mine too!), including LOTR (it was an inspiration behind my first suggestion below!) (also, that’s an affiliate link, and the boxed set, including The Hobbit, is only $20 today!), and her husband’s Anglophilia. There are posts here on the blog that address each of those things that I used in my research, and I want to be sure to list them here in case any of you would like to look through them, too:\n\nBirth announcement for a baby whose mom introduced me to Maisie Ward and who has a similar aesthetic to this family\n\nProfile of a family who names with a literary + Catholic sensibility — they’ve already used fantastic names, and there are some additional ideas, too (an update to a post I’d done on them several years earlier, which is referred to in the posts below)\n\nSeveral posts I’ve done on Catholic literary names: here, here, here.\n\nConsultation for a family living in England, the parents of whom are converts and whose dad is a former Anglican Clergyman-turned-Catholic-priest. They had a “preference for three-syllable Old-World catacomb-y names” that would also fit in in England — Dominic was on their list! Woo! There’s also this birth announcement I did for them a couple years later for their next baby, which includes the name they chose for the baby the consultation had been for.\n\nThe mom of a mama I did a consultation for did a post fifteen years ago on the very unusual names her kids have, inspired by Tolkien and Lewis.\n\nBased on all that, here are my new suggestions for Jessica and her hubby:\n\n(1) Elanor\n\nWhen reading Jessica’s email, I immediately knew I wanted to include Elanor in my suggestions for her! I was initially inspired by Elowen, as Elanor is also a LOTR name, but a more accessible one. Seeing all the flower names that she likes inspired me, too, as in LOTR, not only is Elanor the name of Sam and Rosie’s baby girl, but it’s also the name of a little flower. The fact that it means “sun star” in Sindarin could make it perfect as a little connection to the baby that came before, their Stella, but that’s only if they like that connection — otherwise they can ignore that. I will admit I’m a little hesitant because of Ellie and Elaine on the list of cousins, but it’s so perfect otherwise (in my opinion — they may disagree!) that a way they can work around that is by using Nora as a nickname, which is a common and traditional nickname for Eleanor and has usage in Italian, German, and Ukrainian, making it a nice nod to both Jessica’s and her husband’s heritages, or another more unexpected idea like Lore (a German contracted form of Eleanor) or something made up like Linny or Nori.\n\n(2) Eloise\n\nWhile Elanor is my favorite El- suggestion for this family, and one that I offer even knowing that Ellie and Elaine might make it problematic, I can’t not include Eloise on this list for the sole reason that it was a huge style match for them according to the BNW! It’s a match for Adelaide, Adeline, Rosalie, and Violet! Similar to Elanor, they’d need to find a non-El- nickname — Lola and Lulu could work. Also, as far as I know, there’s no Saint named Eloise (though there is a Bl. Helwisa, also known as Eloisa and Heloise), and the strongest connection to the faith that I know of is the story of theologian Peter Abelard and his wife Heloise (Eloise is a variant of Heloise) — I don’t know how well known that story is among Catholics or the general population, but I read it years ago and it’s still a dominant thought for me regarding Eloise.\n\n(3) Zelie\n\nSt. Gianna is linked with St. Zelie in my mind as two women who served the world and their families through work, and Zelie is distinctly not Italian, so it’s a nice addition to this family’s names from that perspective. An additional inspiration is that many, many people consider Azelie (St. Zelie’s given name) to be French for “azalea” (I just have to add that I’ve never been able to confirm that — according to Google translate, azalée is the French for azalea, but if you do a general search for “is azelie French for azalea” you’ll find lots of sites that say so), which could be a nod to Jessica’s love of floral names.\n\n(4) Cora(lie)\n\nCora is a match for Stella and Clara, and since Clara isn’t feeling quite right to Jessica’s hubby but Cora’s so similar, maybe Cora would feel like a fresh take? I’ve known many families to choose it because of cor meaning “heart” in Latin — they use it for the Immaculate Heart of Mary and/or the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which is so lovely. Then I saw Coralie as a match for Rosalie, and thought that might be even better! With Jessica’s hope of moving away from Italian-feeling names, Coralie feels closer to that goal than Cora does.\n\n(5) Phoebe\n\nThis is another name I wouldn’t have thought of for this family, but it’s a match for both Lydia and Maisie and has an early-Christian biblical association like Lydia. I just heard from a mom who I’d done a consultation for that they’d named their baby girl Phoebe and are calling her Bee, which is so darling!\n\n(6) Beatrice, Beatrix\n\nSpeaking of Bee, I wonder what they would think of Beatrice or Beatrix? Beatrice is a match for Violet and Josephine, and it’s literary and saintly; I also included Beatrix in my book of Marian names for this reason:\n\n“As the word Beatrix in Latin means ‘she who blesses, makes happy, delights,’ the name Beatrix can easily refer to Our Lady, who blesses us all and is the Cause of Our Joy (Causa Nostrae Laetitiae)!” (42)\n\nBeatrix has the added fun element of being the name of Beatrix Potter — British + literary! I love Bea or Bee as a nickname, and Trix and Trixie are cute, too.\n\n(7) Natalia\n\nNatalia is a match for both Dominic and Tristan, so while I wouldn’t normally have included it, since it seems to lean into the Italian-ish feel rather than out of it, the fact that it’s a match for Jessica’s two favorite boy names — who themselves might normally feel mismatched as brothers (though I and the BNW don’t agree with that) — seems a big deal! It or its variants also have usage in other languages, including Croatian, German, Italian, and Ukrainian, making it a real pan-European name (I always love pan-European names!), and they could have fun looking into the diminutives for it in those languages for nickname possibilities. Natascha is a German diminutive and Natalka is Ukrainian, for example. Its nickname Talia has separate origins as a Hebrew name, and Lia sounds like the biblical Leah, both of which tip it a little closer to Lydia. Tilly could work, which has a “Lissie” feel. Some nice options!\n\n(8) Avila\n\nMy last idea is inspired by Aveline on the list of names Jessica likes but her hubby doesn’t. Aveline is, in origin, a diminutive of Avila, and Avila is all “St. Teresa of Avila” to Catholics, but isn’t her actual name, so I thought it might be perfect! Avila as a name derives from Old German, which is a nice nod to Jessica’s husband’s heritage; Avila the city has a different etymology and is considered Spanish today (being a city in Spain).\n\nThose are all my “official” suggestions, but there were a few others that I wanted to include in this final note, just in case. One was Willa — it’s one of the names that the “literary + Catholic namer” I linked to above used for her daughter, after Willa Cather, who wasn’t Catholic but whose fiction is considered consistent with a Catholic outlook. I’d done a spotlight post on the name a while ago in which I took some liberties in assigning it a connection to “willow” — that botanical connection and Jessica’s love of floral names made me think she might like to consider it! They could consider Willow itself, of course, but that didn’t seem to be their style as much as Willa.\n\nAnother name I saw in the literary posts was Philippa, which feels SO British to me! She’s the main character in Rumer Godden’s In This House of Brede (affiliate link), about a cloister of Benedictine nuns, and the nickname Pippa is to die for. I could see the connection to the royal family being a big selling point to Jessica’s husband … but also a negative? I wanted to mention it anyway. It also feels like Lydia to me because of the apostle Philip and the Letter to the Philippians.\n\nI also quickly went through the list of feast days and memorials from October 21 to November 10 at CatholicSaints.info, which is my favorite source for all that stuff. These were the ones that jumped out at me:\n\nOct. 22: John Paul II — names in his honor include Caroline, Karoline, Karolina, Charlotte\n\nOct. 24: Anthony Mary Claret — I like that “Claret” could connect to Clara\n\nOct. 27: Martyrs of Avila (some)\n\nOct. 28: Martyrs of Avila (others)\n\nOct. 29: Chiara Badano (another nice connection for Clara)\n\nNov. 2: Margaret of Lorraine\n\nNov. 4: Charles Borromeo\n\nNov. 5: Beatrice of Swabia\n\nNov. 6: Beatrice of Olive\n\nNov. 7: Eleanor of Portugal\n\nAnd those are all my ideas! What do you all think? What name(s) would you suggest for the little sister of Gianna, Dominic, and +Stella?\n\nFor help with Marian names, my book, Catholic Baby Names for Girls and Boys: Over 250 Ways to Honor Our Lady (Marian Press, 2018), is available to order from ShopMercy.org and Amazon (not affiliate links). It’s perfect for expectant parents, name enthusiasts, and lovers of Our Lady!\n\nBaby name consultation: Second baby girl needs a pretty, Italian-ish name\n\nHappy Tuesday of the week of July 4th! Happy feast of lots of titles of Our Lady: Our Lady of the Garden, Our Lady of Madhu, Our Lady of Montallegro, Our Lady of the Grove, Our Lady of the Leśniów Spring, Our Lady of the Visitation, Our Lady of the Way of Leon, and Our Lady of Vaussivieres!\n\nUnfortunately, as of today, I’ll be suspending baby name consultations indefinitely, as I will have a very busy fall and probably the entire upcoming school year (some new professional things, and sending my second son off to college! My mama’s heart and mind can only take so much! I started Sancta Nomina three months after my sixth was born; my oldest was 9. Now my oldest is going to be a college junior, and my next boy a college freshman, and my baby [boy no. 7] will be in first grade, and I can’t even believe how big all my boys are!). If you’ve already sent me a request, no worries — I will honor all of those I received as of midnight last night. If I’m able to resume consultations in the future, I will let you know here on the blog! In the meantime, the Catholic Baby Naming Discussion Facebook group is a great option — it’s got lots of members and is very active, with several posts a day by mamas looking for name help and lots of people eager to offer their ideas/thoughts/suggestions. Thank you to all of you who have invited me into your baby name conversations! I have thoroughly enjoyed hearing about your families and helping you find names for your little ones that connect to our faith.\n\nI also want to note that I celebrated my tenth blogiversary last week! Wow!! What a fun decade it’s been!! If you’d like to read my first post ever, click here.\n\nI won’t be gone from the blog altogether, but do note (as many of you have discovered!) that my ability to read and reply to emails in a timely manner is getting less and less. I do apologize to anyone who’s left waiting longer than you’d like!\n\nToday’s baby name consultation is for Kate from Kate Scimeca Art (such beautiful, faithy art prints!) and her husband as they prepare to welcome their fourth born baby — their second girl! This little lady joins older siblings:\n\nDominic Andrew\n\nLucia Marie\n\nVincent James\n\n+Francis Joseph (in heaven)\n\nSuch attractive, saintly names! Kate writes,\n\n“So far, we chose saint names that seem to suit our Sicilian last name pronounced SKIM-uh-ka. We like the Italian-ish sound to the names, and we like the kids to have an easy patron saint to turn to. To us, the boy names need to feel strong and the girl names need to feel pretty. 🙂\n\nWe chose Dominic very quickly and easily right after the 20 week ultrasound when we found out he was a boy; no special devotion from us – just loved the strong sound of the name! Andrew is my husband’s middle name and my grandpa’s middle name. For Lucia, that was our top girl name had Dominic been a girl and we still both loved it two years later so we named her that right away after the 20 week ultrasound again. 🙂 We like to connect it to Saint Lucy and Sister Lucia from Fatima. Marie is my middle name, my mom’s middle name, and my grandma’s middle name. Vincent was harder for us to name. We couldn’t agree until after he was born. My husband wanted Anthony, but I don’t like the nickname ‘Tony’. I really wanted Solanus (with the nickname ‘Sully’) after Blessed Solanus Casey, but that name was a little too ‘out there’ for my husband. Vincent was both of our second choices, and of course we have no regrets since we see now how it suits our son perfectly. His middle name James is his other grandfather’s first name. I think we tend to like names that are classic but not boring – generally not too unique that they’d cause difficulties in life but not so common that they feel dull to us – and again, a natural connection to a saint. And we like middle names to have some kind of family connection. We do call Lucia ‘Lulu’ a lot and Vincent ‘Vinny’ sometimes but we never call Dominic by a nickname.”\n\nThe names they’re considering for their baby girl include:\n\nAvila Clare (“I wanted to name Vincent this if he was a girl. It just sounds so pretty to me! We have no connection to the middle name Clare, though, and I worry that Avila might be too unusual? Though hopefully not as ‘out there’ as my love of the name Solanus!“)\n\nGianna (“My husband’s pick. I just don’t love Gianna for some reason. I really don’t think I’ll change my mind.”)\n\nGemma (“I love this one! I much prefer it to Gianna. My husband feels the same way about this one as I feel about Gianna – just doesn’t click for him but I think he can be convinced, hah. Saint Gemma’s birthday is our wedding anniversary.”)\n\nCamilla (“We both like this one – it’s very pretty. I feel like we wouldn’t use a nickname. I’m not sure about Catholic saints with this name though.”)\n\nJuliet (“This one came to us out of the blue. We both like it and favor the nickname ‘Jules’ but aren’t certain about Catholic connections with this one either!“)\n\nStella (“We both like it but aren’t sure since our last name also starts with S.”)\n\nMiddle name ideas include:\n\nAnne (“It is a tradition in my family to give as a middle name to the second daughter, like my sister and aunt both have this as a middle name.”)\n\nMarguerite (“Marguerite is my mom’s first name and my husband has a grandmother Margaret. This one is my preference and I think my husband’s as well. We are up for bucking the Anne family tradition because we think this name is so pretty. To us, Anne just doesn’t sound as good with our first name preferences but ‘Camilla Marguerite’ as an example sounds so lovely to us.”)\n\n“I guess we’d never use Mary/Maria since we used Marie as a middle name. I also don’t love Catherine/Elizabeth/Caroline because they feel too common even though they’re very beautiful.”\n\nIt goes without saying that I LOVE their older children’s names! Dominic, Lucia, Vincent and +Francis Joseph are so attractive and full of faith significance, I love them! I also love that they fit in nicely with this family’s Sicilian heritage and surname, while also being able to connect to other cultures: e.g., the Spanish St. Dominic and the Portuguese Sr. Lucia. These parents have done a great job!\n\nAs for the names they’re considering for this baby, I thought I’d offer my thoughts on them in case they’re helpful:\n\nAvila Clare: What a beautiful combo! I think it’s a really nice fit for this family in that it’s a Spanish place name, which is one of the reasons I mentioned the pan-European nature of their older kiddos’ names — it’s great to choose names that can fit together even when coming from different countries/cultures/languages. The fact that Avila ends with an -a can give it a vague Italian-ish feel, too. I feel like Lucia Marie and Avila Clare are really well matched as sister names! I don’t think Avila is too “out there” at all — I see it with some regularity in the families I work with (here’s a birth announcement for an Avila Rose!), both on already-born daughters and on lists of names for consideration. I think it’s so lovely! And the possible nickname Ava really makes it very familiar if they decided they wanted to do that. I also don’t think it’s a problem at all to not currently have a connection to the name Clare — I really do think that sometimes Saints find us through our taste in names! This family could absolutely cultivate a devotion to St. Clare of Assisi, and it’s extra nice for them that she’s an Italian Saint!\n\nGianna: It’s so interesting that Kate doesn’t love this name — it does seem like the kind of name she would choose! But I’ve had that same feeling many times, when a name seems like it would be perfect for our family but I just can’t get there.\n\nGemma: I’ve also had the experience where I liked a name and was sure I could bring my husband around, haha! I also LOVE that St. Gemma’s feast day is their anniversary!! That’s amazing!! It’s also really cool that in the Baby Name Wizard book (affiliate link), which lists style matches for each entry, the matches for Gemma are mostly British-y feeling, so even though she’s obviously a legit Italian Saint, they would also introduce a different European feel into their family, which can open more possibilities going forward (if they’re so blessed). My preference is always to try to help parents find a name that they both equally love (or at least both equally accept), and I never want to interfere in baby name conversations between parents — only help — but between you and me 😊 , I really like this option for this family!\n\nCamilla: This is a really pretty name, too! Though Kate said they likely wouldn’t use a nickname, it is pretty cool that both Cammie and Milla/Millie could work, which are nice options. But the full Camilla is lovely too! I also love that Kate and her hubby both like it! As for Catholic Saints, there are two Saints and a Blessed; St. Camilla Battista Varano was a Poor Clare, which immediately makes me think Camilla Clare would be lovely!\n\nJuliet: Oh man, Juliet is one of my very, very favorites — I love seeing it on their list!! Like Gemma, it has a somewhat Brit feel, but of course the original Juliet was Italian, so it works nicely for this family! I did a spotlight post on Juliet here, which provides some good faith connections! (Don’t mind me saying in it that Jules isn’t my favorite nickname — if Kate and her hubby love it, I’m thrilled!!)\n\nStella: This is another great option for this family, and since I’m a fan of alliteration, I don’t mind Stella Scimeca at all! Maristella is a longer option that gets away from the S-S at least formally, though if their daughter always goes by Stella as a nickname/everyday call name, then a non-S formal name doesn’t really help with that. I wouldn’t cross it off their list if it was up to me, but they’ll have to decide how they feel!\n\nAnne: Ooh, I am a big fan of family traditions, but I’ve also been in the spot to not like how a particular name works as a middle name for a first name we like. I wonder if Kate and her husband would consider a compromise of sorts by using a different Anne name? There are so many variants and related names like Annabel(le), Annika, Hannah/Anna, Annette, Anita, Nancy, and so many others. Using one of those could be a cool way to freshen up the family tradition and balance their chosen first name better?\n\nMarguerite: It’s hard for me to argue against Kate’s mom’s name, especially when it can also nod to her hubby’s grandma and it’s also the name they both prefer! I wonder if they would consider a double middle name? Marguerite Anne or Anne Marguerite? Those combos are giving me gorgeous French princess vibes — it makes me want to add a hyphen in the manner of French royalty or French Saints! Marguerite-Anne and Anne-Marguerite are beautiful!\n\nMary/Maria: Though Kate said they wouldn’t use these because they already used Marie, I do just want to throw out there that it’s a very traditional Catholic practice to give each daughter in a family a variant of Mary as part of their name, so if they want to include a Marian name, there’s no reason not to! If they don’t want to, that’s totally fine too!\n\nCatherine/Elizabeth/Caroline: Just a thought — I wonder if Kate would like these better if she considered the Italian or Spanish versions? Caterina, for example, is gorgeous, and can nod to St. Catherine of Siena and Kate herself as well! Elisa, Elisabetta, and Isabella are all beautiful, and Karolina is one of my favorite ways to honor St. John Paul II (since his birth name was Karol).\n\nOkay! On to new ideas! As I mentioned, I did my usual research in the Baby Name Wizard, looking for names that are similar to the style they’ve shown that they like (through the names they’ve already chosen and those they’re considering). I also really leaned into their preference for pretty girl names! Based on all that, these are my ideas:\n\n(1) Chiara\n\nThis is a little bit of a cheat idea since they already have Clare on their list as a middle name possibility, but Chiara is the Italian version and has gotten some attention in recent years among the families I work with in large part because of Bl. Chiara Luce Badano and Servant of God Chiara Corbella Petrillo — two wonderful models of the faith and certainly both named after St. Clare of Assisi, who would have been known as Chiara. This is a style match for both Gianna and Gemma, so maybe it’s a nice compromise for Kate and her husband?\n\n(2) Emilia\n\nEmilia is a style match for Lucia — it’s always meaningful to me to find style matches for the older children’s names as opposed to the names on the parents’ list! My favorite thing about Emilia is that it’s the name of St. John Paul’s mom, whose cause for canonization is open; for this family, I also like that it has pan-European usage, which fits in so nicely with their other kids.\n\n(3) Siena\n\nI’d already had Siena on my list for this family because of Avila, since it’s also a saintly place name and an Italian one at that (most familiar because of St. Catherine of Siena [Dominican], but there’s also St. Bernardine of Siena, who was Franciscan and is known as *the* promoter of the Holy Name of Jesus). But another fun thing is that I know a family who purposely leaned into their Italian heritage when naming their two daughters — they named them Emilia and Siena!\n\n(4) Natalia\n\nNatalia is a style match for Dominic and it’s long been one of my favorite names! Though Kate’s having a July baby, I love that Natalia’s meaning is literally “Christmas” — “the birth of Jesus.” So beautiful!\n\n(5) Rosa(lia)\n\nWhen I saw Rosa listed as a style match for Lucia, I immediately knew I wanted to include it in my list of suggestions! It also made me think of the longer Rosalia, which is a particularly Italian long form. The Rose names are always so lovely, and I love that they are Marian, too.\n\n(6) Seraphina\n\nSeraphina wasn’t listed as a style match for any of the names I looked up for this family, but I saw it as I was flipping through my BNW and I was like yes! Seraphina! I think it’s one of the prettiest girl names, and since that’s one of Kate’s criteria, I definitely wanted to include it! It refers to the angels (specifically the seraphim), and as such I think it can nod to Our Lady’s title Queen of the Angels, though there are also a few other holy women with this name. An Italian spelling is Serafina, which is also really pretty.\n\n(7) Philomena\n\nI wanted to see what names are style matches for Seraphina to be sure I wasn’t totally off the mark by suggesting it, and saw Philomena listed as one of them, which, again, made me go yes! Philomena is one of those obviously Catholic names, which is a characteristic I love, and speaking of love — its meaning is “to be loved,” which is so special! Like with Seraphina/Serafina, an Italian spelling is Filomena.\n\n(8) Zita\n\nEven though Seraphina and Philomena can hold their own length-wise with Dominic and Vincent, it didn’t escape my notice that Lucia and the girl names on their list are shorter. Zita is one of the shortest, and specifically Italian! There’s the St. Zita most people know about, but many of the families I work with have been loving Servant of God Empress Zita. I do too!\n\n(9) Caeli\n\nThis is a Latin name I see from time to time in the families I work with (this family has a Caeli Rose, gorgeous!), and I love it! It means “of heaven” (like in Regina Caeli = Queen of Heaven) and in Church Latin is said CHAY-lee.\n\n(10) Felicity\n\nI know I’ve already given more ideas that they bargained for, but just one last one: Felicity is a style match for Gemma and Juliet (a little bit more of that “Brit” feel), such a beautiful name.\n\nAnd those are all my ideas! What do you all think? What name(s) would you suggest for the little sister of Dominic, Lucia, and Vincent?\n\nFor help with Marian names, my book, Catholic Baby Names for Girls and Boys: Over 250 Ways to Honor Our Lady (Marian Press, 2018), is available to order from ShopMercy.org and Amazon (not affiliate links). It’s perfect for expectant parents, name enthusiasts, and lovers of Our Lady!\n\nBaby name consultation: Maybe Mediterranean-ish for new baby, but definitely not Oregon Trail\n\nHappy Monday, everyone! This week is winter break for both my elementary and high school kids, so if you are also on break, I hope this consultation is a fun diversion for you in the midst of the much-needed break from the stresses of school days and also the additional fun and mayhem that is always part of it, at least in my house!\n\nToday’s consultation is for a couple expecting their second baby, a sweet sister for big sister Avila. This family has the good fortune of Avila being a surname in their family tree! I love that so much!\n\nA funny thing to keep in mind is that the papa says, regarding names, “1880’s America is out” and, “If it came over the Oregon trail, it’s out.” That made me laugh! But also provided important info about what kinds of names he doesn’t like (to a certain extent; see my comments below).\n\nThe mama also writes,\n\n“I feel like our style and preferences are all over the place!\n\nWe like …\n\nJosephine (for a long time, we said our second girl would be Josephine, but we’re second-guessing it now for some reason. We have a devotion to St. Joseph but I don’t love ‘Josie’ or ‘Jo’ for a nickname)\n\nMadalena or Maddalena (your spotlight post about Mary Magdalena made me cry, in a good way! I love the nicknames Lainey and Lena, we like the Italian/Portuguese feel. We like how this sounds like Madeleine — a name my husband loves — but just a little more unique)\n\nLucia (pronounced loo-see-uh, but my husband does not care for Lucy, so he is hesitant, since Lucy seems like an inevitable nickname. I am Portuguese, so I like the connection to Our Lady of Fatima here, without literally naming the baby ‘Fatima’)\n\nCaroline (We love this name! But does it feel too preppy next to Avila and other names we gravitate towards?? It might be worth mentioning that our home/clothing/lifestyle preferences lean quite preppy, so while it fits ‘us,’ I don’t know how it goes with Avila)\n\nI like Edith and Edie, but my husband is strongly opposed (the Oregon trail comment haha)\n\nI also like Bridget, but my husband isn’t a fan\n\nAlso,\n\n“Our style is …\n\nFamiliar, but not super common\n\nNot overly saccharine (i.e. ‘Isabella’ because the nickname ‘Bella’ is just too frilly for me)\n\nWould like it to be a patron/tied to a saint\n\nLike ‘hipster’ Catholic names as much as the classic European names (two styles that I feel like are conflicting)\n\nWe love traditional English names for boys (Charles, George, Henry) so if we go too Mediterranean this time, does that nix any English names for future children? If it helps, if this baby was a boy, we’d be strongly considering Giorgio, after Giorgio Frassati (we love him!)\n\nAdditionally, names they can’t or won’t use include:\n\nJacinta\n\nRose or Rosalie\n\nAnna\n\nCecelia\n\nLucy\n\nEdith\n\nEden\n\nZelie\n\nClementine\n\nNoelle\n\nMarigold\n\nGianna\n\nIsabella\n\nVeronica\n\nSiena\n\nLily\n\nSophia\n\nColette\n\nStella\n\nHannah\n\nFelicity\n\nAnd they’d like to avoid:\n\nPlace names (since we already have Avila — we LOVE Siena but won’t use it for this reason, and because our best friends have a Siena that’s Avila’s age)\n\nUnless you really convince me, I’d like to avoid another ‘A’ name\n\nFinally,\n\n“Overall, to me, it feels like Avila could go with a very classic/traditional name theme, or could go super Mediterranean. So, it seems like baby #2 could really determine a theme for us either way.”\n\nBaby no. 2 really does offer an interesting opportunity for parents who like names of differing styes! My favorite idea is to choose a name that provides the most possibility for future children, which is the mindset I brought to this consultation.\n\nThe “Oregon Trail” thing and the fact that the mama said Edith falls into those categories for her hubby gave me a decent idea of what names he doesn’t like. It’s unfortunate, because those names are totally back in fashion right now, and a lot of the ones I thought I might like to suggest based on what’s in fashion right now for Catholic families (like Avila) have that older feel. (In fact, I would characterize some of their list as fitting that vibe! I could easily see Josephine and Caroline riding in covered wagons, and Mad[d]alena, Lucia, and Bridget could be thought of having a late 19th/early 20th century immigrant feel, which might be similar to what this papa says he’s opposed to. So unfortunate! I personally love those pioneer/Old World names.)\n\nI was very interested by how Mama defined their style. From everything she wrote, I was most inspired by the fact that their “home/clothing/lifestyle preferences lean quite preppy,” “Not overly saccharine,” “hipster Catholic names” (which is where I would put Avila), “and “classic European names.” In fact, of all those, I would say “preppy” was the most inspirational to me — if I have the right idea of what that means, I think of names that I have characterized as “pearl necklace names” for girls and “pinstripe names” for boys (the latter was the Baby Name Wizard’s description for the name Brooks, which I would think might appeal to this family). So while she worried that “classic European names” conflict with “’hipster’ Catholic names,” I think both can fit with the pearl necklace/pinstripe aesthetic, and that’s the sweet spot I was shooting for.\n\nAlso, I wanted to assure this mama that “pearl necklace names” aren’t necessarily frilly. Her example of Isabella being out because Bella is too frilly for her gave me good direction — maybe Isabel is more her speed? I like that it doesn’t naturally nickname to Bella. The nickname Isa (if they wanted to use a nickname) feels more her speed, too, as it doesn’t have the same lacy feel that Bella does. I also think the “traditional English names for boys” that this couple favors fit in perfectly with their style as I’m understanding it (although … not to play devil’s advocate, but those are the exact kind of names the pioneer boys would have! Or does Papa only dislike those kinds of girl names?).\n\nThat’s actually another good point to discuss — it’s totally normal for parents to have a different style for their girl names than their boy names! I do agree with this mama that baby no. 2 can help determine a theme for them, and if they were having a little Giorgio, I do think it would mean Caroline and Henry would feel out of place going forward. But they could totally do George/Henry/Charles for boys and Avila/Lucia/Madalena for girls, no problem at all. And when I say “no problem at all,” I mean I don’t think it would really raise any eyebrows if they were to do so because doing so is within the realm of “normal” for American parents. But if they didn’t care about what others’ perceptions are, they could simply consider their style “Catholic hipster” and have Avila, Henry, Giorgio, Zelie (though I know it’s on their “no” list), Kateri, Stanley, Fulton, and Faustina! And confuse everyone, haha! But I’d really like to figure out a way for them to be able to use all their favorite names *and* have their children’s name style make sense to them.\n\nThis would be a good time for me to go through the names they’ve discussed or are considering and offer my thoughts, in case they’re helpful:\n\nJosephine: I’m always a little sad when I read that parents have loved a certain name for a long time and when the time finally comes when they can use it, they’re not feeling it so much. I do understand! I’ve had the same feeling myself. But if the traditional nicknames are the only things holding them back from Josephine, maybe an unexpected nickname would solve the problem? A traditional but less common nickname for Josephine is Posy/Posey/Posie, which I think is darling and brings in the extra nice meaning of a posy being “a bunch of flowers.” Or Poesy, which is a poem/poetry. I also think Sophie can work for Josephine (but does Sophia on their list of names they won’t use make this one unusable?). I know Pina is a nickname sometimes used by those of Italian descent, since the Italian variant, Giuseppina, ends in -pina. And I’ve seen Fia sometimes suggested. So they have some options to consider that might make Josephine feel a bit fresher to them!\n\nMadalena/Maddalena: I love these variants! They go really nicely with Avila, and Lainey/Lena are sweet. They do take this family more in that Iberian/Mediterranean direction, which could make Josephine and Caroline feel more mismatched for future daughters, but again, I don’t think it should affect their English boy name list at all. All that said, I think I would have thought Madeleine was more their style, so I’m not surprised Papa loves it! I get a “straightforward” feel from this couple re: their girl names (Isabel instead of Isabella). So while I love Mad(d)alena, since Madeleine feels like a better fit to me but Mama would like a more unique version of it, I wonder what they would think of Magdalene? They could still use Lainey/Lena as nicknames (even though I think it’s traditionally said to rhyme with “pin”), as well as Magda and Maggie. I like that Magdalene is Catholicky Catholic but not Spanish/Portuguese/Italian (though I do love that this mama has Portuguese heritage!), which makes it a great fit for Avila and other names on their list without making them feel restricted to names from a certain part of the world.\n\nLucia: Oh man, with Mama’s Portuguese heritage and love of Our Lady of Fatima, Lucia seems like a slam dunk! But if Lucy is a dealbreaker, that’s going to require some creative thinking. They could double down on Lu/Lou as a nickname, which would likely require them to use it almost exclusively and be firm and consistent with family/friends to make sure it doesn’t turn into Lucy, which could be exhausting. I could see Lu/Lou turning into Louie, which could be cute (I have a girl cousin we affectionately call Louie). Or actually, even better: Lulu! I do think that if they used Lucia at all, even occasionally, it’s very likely Lucy will emerge, but if they always and only use Lulu and introduce their daughter that way, I think that could work, and still give them the satisfaction of having Lucia on the birth certificate. For a Fatima connection, I totally would have suggested Jacinta, which seems more Avila-esque to me, but it’s on their no list … Jacinta is the Portuguese for Hyacinth, I wonder if they would be interested in that? If you watch the Pioneer Woman, you’ll know that one of her best friends is Hyacinth and she always refers to her as Hy. I also think Frances has that “straightforward” feel that I think is part of their girl name style, and could be a nod to Francisco — a different way of naming a girl for Our Lady of Fatima. (But is Frances too Oregon Trail?)\n\nCaroline: Based on so many things in this mama’s email, I’m not at all surprised that she and her hubby love this name and feel that it fits “them”! If they reframe their thinking about it, I think it can totally go with Avila! Many, many families have named their children after St. John Paul II by using a Charles variant, since his birth name, Karol, is the Polish for Charles. Caroline is one I’ve seen many times! If they wanted to lean into this connection even more, they could spell it Karoline. Also, to address the “preppy” concern, one of the naming trends I see and love among parents with a similar style is using surnames as first names — Sloane is sort of a stereotypical example; mothers’ maiden names are often used as well — from this perspective, Avila exactly fits into that! The fact that it’s also a super Catholic saintly place name is just amazing for a family like this, but even if they weren’t Catholic, I could see someone with Avila as a family surname choosing it for their daughter’s first name. So they’re good with Avila and Caroline both fitting their preppy style!\n\nOkay, on to new ideas! You all know that I always start a consultation by looking up the names the parents have already used and those they like in the Baby Name Wizard (affiliate link) as it lists, for each entry, boy and girl names that are similar in terms of style/feel/popularity. I did so for this family, but it was only somewhat helpful because Avila and Madalena don’t have their own entries, for example, and even if Avila did, its style is as much “surname” as “saintly place name,” which makes it equal parts amazing and complicated from a style perspective. I kept thinking about a consultation I did for a family a while ago who were expecting twin girls — “pearl necklace names” were my total focus, and there was some overlap between the names they were considering and some this family likes (they ended up naming one of their babies Caroline, and the other Evelyn, which is, in origin, derived from Avila!), so I read through those posts again. I also looked through the list of Portuguese girl names on Behind the Name for inspiration. In doing all this thinking and researching, I found it pretty difficult to stay away from the old timey names! Hopefully they like something here:\n\n(1) Mary or Maria [something]\n\nNot only do I love a Marian double name anyway, but I really think something like this could be a bridge between Avila and any other kind of name they like. Consider Maria Caroline, for example, either as a first+middle combo or a double first name (Maria-Caroline; I use hyphens throughout this consultation for my double name ideas because I like that it makes the double name obvious, but it’s totally not necessary if they don’t like it!). Maria hits all the Avila notes, which means the middle name can be anything they want and still fit style-wise, and they can use the middle name (or second first name, if they consider it a double first name) as the everyday call name. Consider St. Therese and her mom and sisters, who had Marie- as the first part of their first names but went by the second (or third, in St. Therese’s case). So Mary or Maria [something] could go by her middle name, or a nickname of her middle name, and might help this couple feel more comfortable using a name they like that doesn’t necessarily feel like it fits with Avila. Doing this really opens up a whole host of names! If they hadn’t already used a family surname, I would suggest they consider doing so; boyish names become feminine and Catholic when paired with Mary or Maria (something like Maria-Bennett or Mary-Blaise); names that might have nickname issues could be helped by being paired with Mary or Maria (like Mary-Lucia — I don’t think a Mary-Lucia would automatically be shortened to Lucy [to Mary, if anything, I would think], and they could have fun trying to think of mashup nicknames if they wanted to, like Mia, Marly, Marilu, Malou, that kind of thing). While Mary Clare and Mary Elizabeth might be Oregon Trail names, I don’t believe Maria-Caroline, Mary-Lucia, and Mary-Bennett are!\n\n(2) A different kind of double name\n\nWhile double Marian names are traditional and not uncommon among Catholic families, double names in general strike me as having a preppy feel. As with Mary/Maria, they could give two traditional names an unexpected twist by pairing them, or femininize or normalize an otherwise uncommon or unfamiliar name for a girl, or temper a name that might feel overly feminine for them but they’d like to consider anyway. Some ideas include Sara-Kate, Lucia-Jane, Molly-James, Caeli-Clare. Other elements that might pair up in various combos might include Tessa, Cara, June, and Nell. Some boyish names could be fun, too, like Jesse and Elliott. I was looking around online for unusual real-life double names and saw Rose-Maite (I know they don’t want to use Rose, but I looove Maite! It’s a Spanish mashup of Maria and Teresa), Anna Reid, Kara Drake, Charlie Kate, and Sarah-Taylor. I was also thinking how this mama likes Edie, and thought they could consider an E name with a D middle (or second first) and use Edie (E.D.) as the nickname. Something like Elisa-Day or Eva-Daisy could work. I also know a Mary Elizabeth who goes by M.E. (Emmy).\n\n(3) Julia or Juliet\n\nJulia is a style match for Madeline (standing in for Madalena, which doesn’t have its own entry in the BNW) and Caroline, and has that non-frilly “straightforward” feel that I think they might like. It leans more “classic European” than “hipster,” though, which made me think they might like Juliet even better in terms of looking for a “familiar, but not super common” name. Juliette would certainly be overly frilly for this family, I think, but I don’t think Juliet is … or maybe it is? Just by virtue of the story? It does have good faith credentials, though: I did a spotlight post here.\n\n(4) Eliana\n\nEliana was in the list of Portuguese names, and it’s such a beautiful name I knew I wanted to include it! Though its Portuguese roots don’t trace back to a name of much interest, it’s simultaneously a Hebrew name that means “my God has answered,” which is so great!\n\n(5) Beatrice/Beatrix/Beatriz\n\nAnother name that caught my eye in the list of Portuguese names was Beatriz, and Beatrice is a style match for Josephine — I really felt like this name family (Beatriz, Beatrix, Beatrice) has that same feel that this couple likes. It could be a good replacement for Bridget on the mama’s list?\n\n(6) Vivian, Verity\n\nBecause of Avila’s prominent V, I was hesitant to include other names with prominent V’s, but it was hard to do! Genevieve, Violet, Evangeline, and Victoria are all names that showed up in my research as being similar to names they like. But I did like the idea of Vivian — again, it has that straightforward, non-frilly feel (which, like Juliet, seems more their speed than the frillier Vivienne), and if the V’s bother them, it could be a good candidate for a double name like Mary-Vivian. I also like the idea of Verity — this strikes me as a Catholic hipster name! I also think this could be cool in a double name: Mary-Verity, Maria-Verity, Verity-Jane.\n\n(7) Sidony\n\nI wanted to think of an idea that could possibly appeal to the part of their style that loves Siena, so I was looking for names with similar sounds, and wondered what they might think of Sidony? It’s got an amazing meaning! According to The Oxford Dictionary of English Christian Names (1977) (affiliate link) by E.G. Withycombe,\n\n“this name was formerly used by Roman Catholics for girls born about the date of the Feast of the Winding Sheet (i.e., of Christ), more formally alluded to as ‘the Sacred Sendon’. Sendon or Sindon (from Latin sindon … ‘fine cloth’, ‘linen’) was used in Middle English for a fine cloth, especially one used as a shroud. The Sacred Sendon is supposed to be preserved at Turn … Sidonie is not uncommon in France, and the Irish Sidney is probably really Sidony.” (pp. 268-269).\n\nThe Feast of the Winding Sheet isn’t on the calendar anymore, but it used to be commemorated the day before Ash Wednesday. Isn’t that a cool background for a name?! So Catholic! So unexpected!\n\n(8) Thais\n\nI really wanted to give this couple a range of names, from Mary doubles to unusual ideas. Thais is unusual! In fact, it doesn’t fit their “familiar, but not super common” criteria, but it’s such a beautiful name that I wanted to include it. And it has a Portuguese variant (Thaís)! I spotlighted the name here. If they like it but hesitate that it’s a little too unusual, it would be a good candidate for a Mary double or other double: Mary-Thais or Ella-Thais or Clara-Thais.\n\nI also wanted to mention a few more names that showed up in my research as matches for this family that didn’t feel quite right to include in the list above for whatever reason, but I didn’t feel right leaving them out altogether: Camila, Carina, Emilia.\n\nAs an additional note, I was thinking that Becket is a name that could be added to their list of English boy names that would also fit the Catholic hipster theme they like and be a nice match for Avila — a bridge name, maybe, between Avila and George.\n\nAnd those are all my ideas! What do you all think? What name(s) would you suggest for Avila’s little sister, taking into consideration the details discussed above?\n\nRead all about how to get your own baby name consultation here.\n\nFor help with Marian names, my book, Catholic Baby Names for Girls and Boys: Over 250 Ways to Honor Our Lady (Marian Press, 2018), is available to order from ShopMercy.org and Amazon (not affiliate links).

This is a lovely quote from it, which contains a quote from Dr. King himself:\n\n“As Rev.

He sometimes goes by Luka [our intended nickname] but prefers and introduces himself as Lukas. St. Luke the evangelist and St. Paul are his patrons, and I love that they were friends!

Peter and Paul to represent the east and west, as I was raised Roman Catholic and my husband was raised Byzantine Catholic and we are trying to foster a love for both rites in our home!“\n\nRose Marie (+) (“Our baby in Heaven. When I returned from the doctors appointment confirming my miscarriage, one single rose was in bloom in our garden that wasn’t even budding before. A true gift from Our Blessed Mother and St. Therese. Now I always imagine her as a little rose interceding for our family in Mary’s heavenly bouquet. She and St. Therese frequently shower our family with roses.”)\n\nMika Rose (“[pronounced mee-kah] — we call her MikaRose mostly. I am a big fan of her full name, and really wish we had made it MikaRose and then a separate middle name. It will be a happy addition when she is old enough to pick a patron saint name. (: Mika is a Ukrainian nickname [at least in my husband’s family!] for Maria/Marika. She is named after my husband’s beloved grandmother, Maria, always called ‘Mika.’ Nicknames are Marika, Mee-shoo, and Meeksy [coined by big brothers and man has it stuck….] Rose is for her sister and great intercessor in Heaven! Her patron is Mary, specifically Our Blessed Mother’s title of Mystical Rose and St. Therese. MikaRose even got to meet her namesake and great-grandmother Baba Mika a few times before Baba’s passing, which was just so incredibly sweet.”)\n\nIncredible names, right?? Of course, you have to know that I am SO THRILLED that Lindsey was reassured of Lukas’ Marian connection by my work here at Sancta Nomina! I love the twin connection between Lukas and Simon, the sister connection between Rose Marie in heaven and Mika Rose on earth, the connection between Mika Rose and her great-grandmother, and how Our Lady is all through these beautiful names. Lindsey and her husband have done such a great job!! It’s such a joy to read such thoughtful and beautiful naming!!\n\nLindsey continues,\n\n“My husband’s family is of 100% Ukrainian heritage, so we do like names that can be said easily in Ukrainian OR have a Ukrainian connection (not required, just preferred), and have an obvious patronage. Top priority to have a family name as either first or middle.\n\nFor a baby boy we have always loved Clement, Blessed Clement Sheptetsky (a Ukrainian priest and hieromartyr!) as patron and obvious Marian connection in the Salve Regina (which was the Marian hymn sung at our wedding). My concern is this — does it mix with our other kids names well? I worry because Simon and Lukas are very familiar names and Clement is not so familiar. But MikaRose isn’t familiar at all. So maybe a good bridge name? Also a little nervous he’s going to be nicknamed ‘Clem’ on the soccer field, but could stick firm to having people call him Clement (our community is mostly understanding of using full names). Middle name needs to be a family name and a canonized saint (do we need an apostle to fit with brothers???): some options are Stephen, Aloysius, or Cole.\n\nStill discerning if Clement is the right fit… Other boy options we really like are:\n\nBasil. My husband and I both love this name, so it’s a top contender. We love St. Basil the Great and the Ukrainian pronunciation Vasyyl is so sweet. Basil Aloysius is a really cool name. The more I write about it the more I love it! I don’t know which pronunciation we would use, like the herb (BAY-zil) or like the Saint (BAZ-ill). I like both, but don’t love pronunciation confusion.\n\nJacob- we like the Ukrainian pronunciation and we have a sweet nickname for it ready to go.\n\nVincent – my husband isn’t sold on this one, but could maybe be persuaded. This is my uncle’s name whom I was very, very close to. I love the nickname Vince. Some great patron saint options too.\n\nThomas- we love the Ukrainian pronunciation, don’t love the nickname Tom.\n\nA few more we have tossed around are: Gabriel, Mateo, James (very close friends named this), Thaddeus, Francis, Max, Nicholas, Louis (much too close to Lukas IMO), Cyril (too close to Simon?), and Gregory (don’t like any nickname option for Gregory), and Josaphat (don’t think we would actually go for it, but it is an epic name).\n\nBoy family names (not used yet): Aloysius, Stephen, Ihor, Myron, Cole, Matthew, Vincent, Maurice, Nicholas, Alexander\n\nGirls names we have quite a few options we are shaking around the brainbox, and I feel that my problem is I have too many ‘ideas/themes’ that I’m making us work with. My first idea was to have all of our daughters named after a title of Mary in the Litany of Loreto. So, MikaRose is Mystical Rose and any sisters following would have one as well. I do love this idea, but am not loving how it’s making many of the names we love feel unusable. So I’ve come to the conclusion that we don’t HAVE to do this, but if we could find a name we just adore that also so happens to be a title of Mary, I would be so so happy haha. Also the girl name needs an obvious patron and a family name. AND the name needs to fit well with MikaRose because I feel like we can get away with boys having a style and girls having a style, but don’t want this girl name to match the boy’s too much and leave MikaRose’s hanging awkwardly beside them. ….And maybe be a Ukrainian name…. I’ve dug myself into a hole with all the rules\n\nGirl names we are currently discussing:\n\nStella- we both adore this name, but it’s not a family name or Ukrainian! But maybe it doesn’t matter? Obvious Marian title with that one!\n\nAzelie – same like Stella. We love this name, just no family or Ukrainian connection! Pronunciation would be a struggle.\n\nMargaret – my mother’s name. I would LOVE to honor her in some way. Her middle name is Anne. Although I’m a little nervous that it’s too “regular/common” like Simon and Lukas, compared to MikaRose which is a very unique and not obviously Catholic name. We would not call her Margaret, though, we like the nicknames Daisy and Mae. Also lacks the Ukrainian connection, but since it’s my mom’s name and a saint we love, could get past that. One of my favorite books growing up was My Only May Amelia and I just love that name. Thinking Margaret ‘Mae’ Emilia could be sweet, and she might go by the double name some, just like MikaRose.\n\nMagdalena or Helena – (nickname Lena or just use full name!). [Hubby] likes Helena more than Magdalena, but is open to both. Worried about Helena pronunciation, there are so many pronunciations and spellings. HELL-ena, hell-Lay-na, Ha-leena, etc. Sometimes I see Halina which is a name I like, but I think different name completely?\n\nLilia – MikaRose was almost Lilia, Cecilia, or Josephine. Worried if we have another girl or two she’ll have to be a flower and we will run out!! (Same goes with Daisy nn for Margaret above …. But clearly we love flower names and already have a few in the running, so maybe we should embrace the floral theme!) This feels like a good, safe option. Not super thrilled about it right now for some reason, though. I think maybe because Lily names are somewhat popular. But maybe our enthusiasm will grow again because it truly checks off the boxes – it’s Ukrainian, it matches MikaRose, and making it Marian will be easy – just need to add a family name)! Lilia Margaret is pretty special, and Mary, most pure would be an appropriate Litany title I think.\n\nMarianna – beautiful Ukrainian name! Love the double patronage of the Blessed Mother and St. Ann and think the nickname Mari (marr-ee) is sweet.\n\nEdith – my husband’s suggestion. I don’t love it, although I do love the saint, and could probably get behind it eventually. It feels off though because it hardly checks any of my many boxes.\n\nPia – don’t know if we could ACTUALLY go for this name, but we both do really love it. We have tossed this name around for years since we were pregnant with the boys.\n\nI like Genevieve, Vera, Gloria, Katerina/Katherine (nn Katya) and Felicity but my husband is not a fan. Giving for stylistic examples.\n\nMy husband REALLY REALLY wants and loves ‘Mary” or “Maria’ but I think we already have used that as a first name. He disagrees that all of our daughters could have a Marian first name and he IS right. He also makes the good point that I love Marianna. I worry that ‘Mary’ makes MikaRose’s name stand out from the other biblical/common names. I love the name Mary, I do(!!!!), but it just doesn’t feel like the right fit. I also love Maria, but especially since Mika is a nickname for Maria, it really feels like that belongs to MikaRose. He disagrees, and I am up for being persuaded differently. He says MikaRose and Maria are perfect sister names. I agree to an extent, except it once again makes MikaRose ‘out there’ and the other names super normal/classic.\n\nFormerly we have loved Josephine and Cecilia, but both feel a little too popular in our circles. But I could be convinced with the right nickname or Marian connection. They are already family names because both of my great-grandmothers were Josephine and my confirmation name is Cecilia. Maybe good middle names- just missing the Marian connection. Maybe we will fall in love with one of them again!\n\nClara – we both like this name!\n\nGirl family names: Margaret, Oksana, Frances, Carolyn, Gertrude, Maria, Anne, Mary, Mary Ann, Josephine, Doris, Mae, Cecilia\n\nFamily devotions/patrons: the Sacred Heart of Jesus (our homeschool name is Sacred Heart Academy and our home is consecrated to His Most Sacred Heart), the Holy Family, St. Therese of Lisieux, St. Ignatius, St. Padre Pio, anything Ukrainian/Byzantine focused we can get behind. Have started looking into some Ukrainian virtue names, like Rada means joy but I don’t love it.”\n\nI loved reading all this and couldn’t wait to spend time working on this! And BOY DID I WORK ON THIS! This is definitely one of my longest consultations, if not my longest, and you have to know that I had to actually cut myself off — there was so much more I wanted to research and write about! Even as I was trying to finish it up I was reading about some Ukrainian martyrs and crying and showing my husband and sons, gah! I had to make myself stop reading about holy people so I could finish! And even here, I tried to edit it down a little so it isn’t ridiculously long.\n\nI absolutely loved reading about Lindsey’s husband’s Ukrainian heritage and their efforts to foster a love for the Roman and Byzantine Rites in their home and family! I used this as my major inspiration when trying to find names I thought they both might like.\n\nBefore getting to my new ideas for this family, I thought I would start by offering my thoughts on the names already on their list, in case they’re helpful:\n\nClement: This, to me, is the name to beat. It’s got the great Ukrainian connection and the Marian meaning, with the additional layer of connecting to their wedding, and as Lindsey herself noted, I do indeed think of it as a great bridge name between Lukas/Simon and Mika. I myself go back and forth on Clem as a nickname — on the one hand, it’s the kind of nickname that’s not for everyone (just this morning I thought of “Clay” as a nickname I could suggest to parents that are interested in Clement but would like a different nickname than Clem — maybe for Clement Aidan? Clement Eamon? Clement Abram?), but on the other hand, I know that if we had named one of our boys Clement (it was on our list because of the Marian connection, and also our parish is St. Clement’s, for the Redemptorist St. Clement Mary Hofbauer), we totally would have eventually shortened it to Clem and grown to love it. I suspect it would be the same for Lindsey! And like she said, living in a community that’s “mostly understanding of using full names” means they’ll likely not have too much of a problem.\n\nAs for the middle name, Lindsey wondered if they should stick to apostles’ names in order to fit in with the brothers — that’s totally up to them! It makes sense for twins to have some sort of name connection (howwww many hours did I spend coming up with lists of twin names for my own self?! So fun!), so moving away from apostles’ names for their third boy seems like a fine and reasonable decision. Maybe even preferable, so they don’t end up feeling tied to it in the future? Stephen is a nice option because it’s biblical like Peter and Paul; Aloysius is nice because it’s not biblical, so it establishes that they’re not tied to biblical names; Cole made me hesitate a little — I like that it’s a family name, but it has a trendier feel to me than the more “serious” (in a good way!) feel of the older kids … but at the same time, maybe that would be nice, as a way of balancing the more unfamiliar Clement? I do tend to like alliteration as well. And Cole was on our own list for ages, it really is very sweet.\n\nBasil: I agree, Basil Aloysius is pretty amazing!! I like that it’s clearly an Eastern name as well. I’m with Lindsey regarding pronunciation, though — I’ve seen some charged conversations online where people who pronounce it like the herb are skewered for “mispronouncing” it, despite the fact that both pronunciations are totally acceptable; also, the only BAY-zil I know is a girl (and her parents specifically liked the connection to the plant, as well as its connection to “basilica” and St. Basil). Hmm … now I’m wondering — I wonder what Lindsey and her hubby what would think about Basil for a girl?? Okay, so let me step off into a tangent for a minute:\n\nI have a lot of thoughts about MikaRose’s name and its impact on their future naming, especially for girls! I absolutely love it, I really really do, and it was t"
