        "text": "Michael Szczerban\n\nVP, Publisher of Voracious and Little, Brown Spark\n\nI oversee the Voracious and Spark imprints at Little, Brown, which publish books that make life better. As an editor, my interests are driven by appetite and curiosity, and I love helping authors connect readers to their passions.\n\nI have published numerous bestsellers and established several million-copy series that include Pete Souza’s photo books (Obama: An Intimate Portrait and others), cookbook programs from Christopher Kimball’s Milk Street and Jeffrey Eisner, and Sarah Knight’s No F*cks Given Guides. Other projects include Wally Koval’s Accidentally Wes Anderson, Zach Klein’s Cabin Porn, and our half-century-old Ansel Adams program. My authors include Pamela Anderson, Bryan Ford, Sam Heughan, the estate of Johnny Cash, Vivian Howard, Marcus Samuelsson, Daniel Humm/Eleven Madison Park, Brad Leone, and Ayesha Curry. My books have won the Thurber Prize for American Humor and been finalists for the Financial Times Business Book of the Year and the National Book Critics Circle Award.\n\nPreviously, I worked at Simon & Schuster, where I acquired Samin Nosrat’s mega-bestseller Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat and helped develop the TED Books line. I then helped launch the Regan Arts imprint at Phaidon, and joined Little, Brown in 2014. We launched Voracious in 2019, and I was named publisher of Spark and Voracious in 2024.\n\nI am a recipient of the Lawrence Peel Ashmead Editorial Award and a Publishers Weekly Star Watch honoree, and have written about our business for Poets & Writers. You can follow me on Instagram @foreverbeard.\n\nJoshua Kendall\n\nExecutive Editor, VP, Editorial Director\n\nI am an executive editor, as well as the editorial director of Mulholland Books, where I’ve edited novels like The Cuckoo’s Calling, by Robert Galbraith (aka J.K. Rowling), JJ Abrams and Doug Dorst’s S., Lauren Beukes’s internationally bestselling The Shining Girls, as well national bestsellers like the debut Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, and crime fiction legends like Lawrence Block, Joe Lansdale, Charlie Huston, and Jim Thompson. At Little, Brown, I published the acclaimed literary novel Neverhome, as well as New York Times bestselling authors Michael Koryta and Dan Simmons. Prior to Little, Brown, I worked at Viking/Penguin and Picador, where I worked with authors and titles as diverse as Tana French, Stewart O’Nan, Ron Carlson, and Jasper Fforde. I have also edited a variety of nonfiction projects, such as The Boys In the Boat, Moby-Duck, and Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx Is Burning.\n\nTalia Krohn\n\nVP, Editorial Director\n\nI joined Little Brown Spark in 2022 after sixteen years at Penguin Random House. I acquire primarily idea- and research-driven books in business and economics and in the behavioral and social sciences. I am particularly drawn to expert voices with unique insights that help us better understand ourselves, each other, and the ways in which we live and work. Books that I am proud to have published include: Zero to One, Brave, Not Perfect, Essentialism, The Lonely Century, Humor, Seriously, Acting with Power, It’s About Damn Time, Makers and Takers, Insight, The Happiness Advantage, The Power of Broke, and The Start-up of You. While I did not technically attend Stanford University, I have worked with many authors who did.\n\nAlex Littlefield\n\nExecutive Editor\n\nI joined Little, Brown in 2022 to expand our list of serious nonfiction, primarily in the categories of history, biography, politics, and current affairs. I also have a soft spot for investigative journalism, narrative non-fiction, science, and true crime. Above all else, I love books with an edge and with a mission; I look for well-crafted stories braided with bold arguments and big ideas, and for authors with fresh perspectives and deep expertise in their subject areas. I am proud to have published New York Times bestselling authors such as Fiona Hill, Marie Yovanovitch, Peter Strzok, Neal Katyal, Avi Loeb, and Randall Munroe as well as luminaries such as Graham Allison, Lisa Feldman Barrett, and Jennifer Doudna. I also have had the pleasure of working with Adam Hochschild, James Risen, Wesley Lowery, Eric Lichtblau, Jacqueline Jones, and Jonathan Greenblatt. Before Little Brown, I spent sixteen years in the editorial departments of Mariner Books (formerly Houghton Mifflin Harcourt), Basic Books, and Grove/Atlantic.\n\nVivian Lee\n\nSenior Editor\n\nI joined Little, Brown in 2021 and acquire literary fiction and narrative nonfiction. I am excited to read books that ask big questions (or complicate those questions); authors who write in the intersections of race, gender, class, sexuality, and ability. I am passionate about narratives that challenge our way of thinking both in the world and on the page. I have published Anna DeForest’s A History of Present Illness (winner of an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award), Curtis Chin’s Everything I Learned, I Learned in a Chinese Restaurant (ALA Stonewall Winner), Jimin Han’s The Apology (a Barnes and Noble Discover Pick), and Youngmi Mayer’s I’m Laughing Because I’m Crying. Previously, I worked in print magazine and newspapers and as an editor at Little A for six years, where I published bestselling and award-winning authors including PEN/Faulkner finalist Matthew Salesses, Kirkus finalist Naima Coster, and PEN/Faulkner finalist Viet Dinh, as well as with Jim Atlas on the ICONS series. For my editorial work, I was named a PW Rising Star Honoree in 2018 and a Kundiman Honoree in 2023."
