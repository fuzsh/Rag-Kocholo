        "text": "Jennifer writes:\n\nHi!\n\nI am writing to find out how I can get your help!\n\nWe are due with a second baby girl in August and are really struggling finding a name that we love. Our first daughter is Charlotte Lucy Grabiner. We are working on using the nickname Lottie more regularly (shes 2.5 now). My husband is Josh and I am Jennifer.\n\nThis might be an unusual situation but we actually only have boy names that we love – lol! So I thought maybe if I shared those with you you might be able to come up with some girl names in a similar style so that we can finally find one we really and truly love. The girl’s name does not by any means need to be a feminine form of any of the boy ones, rather I am looking for one that has a similar quality or style to it. I’m not sure how you would categorize our taste (southern, classic, not popular but not too unusual, strong, prep school like – ha ha, ??? I’m having trouble putting it into words). Anyway so here’s the boy name list. Good luck and thank you!!!!\n\nEmmett\n\nWhittaker (our #1 choice for a boy – Whittaker Bates Grabiner, Whitt for short)\n\nBennett\n\nEverett\n\nLandon\n\nDexter\n\nFisher (middle)\n\nMark (middle)\n\nBentley\n\nBates (middle)\n\nYates\n\nPreston\n\nGraham\n\nPenn\n\nBlake\n\nAnderson\n\nIt depends in part on whether you plan to have more children. If you might have a boy in the future, I would want to be careful not to suggest a girl name that would rule out a favorite boy name: for example, if you’re planning more children and would definitely want to use Whittaker for a boy, I wouldn’t want to try to sell you on Whitney. But if you’re definitely stopping at two, I’d be looking for ways to get you something close to the names you weren’t going to get to use. Also, if you’re planning more children and would use Whittaker, I might look for double-T names for this baby as well, just for fun.\n\nAnother issue is that it’s common to have quite a different style for girls than for boys. The name Charlotte is vintage, literary, and currently popular; I wouldn’t use those same adjectives for very many of the names on your boy-name list. If I’d seen only your boy-name list and didn’t know you had a Charlotte, I might be suggesting names such as Sloane, Carrington, Britt, Bex, Kerrigan, Presley, Lane, Darby, Padgett, Yeardley, Greer, Ellery, Waverly, Whitley, Hollis, Rowan. If I’d seen you had a daughter named Charlotte but didn’t see your boy-name list, I might be suggesting names such as Evelyn, Eleanor, Josephine, Vivian, Nora, Abigail.\n\nWhen I look at names that go well with your boy-name style, I keep coming up with options that seem to clash with Charlotte: Charlotte and Peyton, Charlotte and Berkeley, Charlotte and Avery, Charlotte and Lennox. This makes me hesitate to answer your question as asked. Because your daughter’s middle name is also vintage, literary, and currently popular, I tentatively conclude that your style for girls is different than your style for boys—though there is some overlap in names such as Emmett, Everett, and Graham.\n\nCharlotte is a name that can sound sweet or sassy. Others that seem like that to me, without clashing:\n\nBeatrix\n\nCamilla\n\nCecily\n\nEliza\n\nEmeline\n\nEsther\n\nEve\n\nFiona\n\nFrances\n\nGeorgia\n\nHarriet\n\nJosephine\n\nKatherine\n\nLila\n\nMatilda\n\nNora\n\nPhilippa\n\nPhoebe\n\nRuby\n\nSimone\n\nStella\n\nVivian\n\nWinifred\n\nName update!\n\nI deeply apologize for this email coming so much later than I ever anticipated. I want to thank y’all and everyone else for the immense amount of help y’all provided us in naming our sweet baby girl.\n\nAugust 1, 2013 we welcomed our 2nd daughter, Emmeline Rose Grabiner, sister to Charlotte Lucy Grabiner.\n\nSwistle and many commenters suggested the name Emmaline/Emaline/Emeline. As I wrote in my interim update, I was in love with the name Emmaline. My husband, however was not.\n\nOver much discussion we found that we wanted to avoid a nn of Emma due to its popularity (#1 name the previous year). Also, many Google searches later I discovered the historical version of Emmaline is actually Emmeline. I liked that that the name had a history, that it avoided a natural nickname of Emma from its spelling, and allowed for a more acceptable nickname to us of Emmie.\n\nRose is a family name.\n\nSo we now have a Charlotte and an Emmeline. And although we don’t use them all that much now, we have nicknames of Lottie and Emmie. Love!\n\nThank you again and again for all the help!!\n\nJennifer"
