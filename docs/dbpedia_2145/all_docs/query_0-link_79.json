        "text": "Benjamin Wesley Aguirre (“The Legend” to the derby community), AKA Jabe Peacher\n\nJanuary 25, 1952- July 3, 2021\n\nIn the early morning hours of July 3, 2021, Ben peacefully passed away at the age of 69 at home in Miles City surrounded by family, after a 6-year battle with a heart condition.\n\nBen was born on January 25, 1952 to Benjamin Alfonso Aguirre and Dorothy Benjamin Aguirre, in Miles City, MT. The family resided about 45 miles SE of Miles City where his dad worked at the LO Ranch owned by Mary and Bob Hardy. Ben attended the one room LO School just down from their bunkhouse. It was a one room classroom with grades 1-8 with about 5 or 6 kids total, and one teacher.\n\nAs a baby, Ben was nicknamed” Jabe Peacher ” by a relative, and that name stuck! Ben was baptized Catholic by Father Patrick Berther, from Ashland. Who would come offer mass once a month at the LO School or in someone’s house.\n\nHe gained a sister, Charity, a few years later. Salvador and Connie Aguirre also live in the bunkhouse at the LO, so Ben and Charity had numerous cousins as their playmates. In January 1963 the family welcomed another sister Carla. In 1964 the family moved to Miles City when Ben was 12. Sister Carrie was born that December.\n\nHe attended Washington Middle School, and graduated from CCDHS in 1969, at the age of 17. During High School, Ben lettered in wrestling, and was a member of FFA. After graduating high school, Ben spent time working with his cousins at the horse track. He also spent time as a brick layer and working road construction.\n\nIn 1971, Ben met Kathy bringing Larry, Donald, and Dyna to the family. They then welcomed daughter Libertie in July of 1974.\n\nBen moved back to the LO Ranch with his family in 1982. He then married his wife Toni on June 3, 1984 at the LO Ranch, bringing Raoul, James, and Ryan to the family. They had their son Ben in October of 1983. Shortly after, they moved to the valley, they had their daughter Tabbetha in May of 1985. Later that summer, Ben was baptized into the 7th Day Adventist Church. They then moved to Miles City and welcomed another son, Jonathan in June of 1987.\n\nBen had spent time working for the USGS seismographing off and on from 1974-1990 and later took a job at the stock yard in Miles City so he could spend more time and be closer to his family. During these years Ben would build derby cars, often with the assistance of his children. Letting them bust out the windows and help paint the cars. He then began a career with the Dept. of Sanitation and continued that career after moving to California in 1996, eventually retiring from the City of Fresno Dept. of Sanitation in 2009. During his time in California, He is remembered by his daughter Tabbetha, for making it a point to make it to all of his kids sporting events. Traveling to different basketball, wrestling, and football games, supporting his children.\n\nBen then moved back to Miles City in 2013, enjoying retirement surrounded by children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren. He spent this time truly enjoying his passions in life, traveling around to different demolition derby’s competing in his final one in 2018, finding a live poker game on a weekend, tooling leather, and most of all playing his guitar with and for family and friends.\n\nIn his down time, He would spend his time with his dog Ying Yang curled up next to him on the couch with a cup of coffee at arm’s reach, watching his favorite things on tv. Either watching a derby on YouTube, reruns of poker tournaments, or UFO Files at bedtime, and church service on Saturdays.\n\nBen always took time to remind people how important family was. When clashes broke out, he would always remind people to not let the petty things get in the way. He was always proud of his children and their individual accomplishments. Often telling the stories in only a way he could, getting excited and louder as he went on telling the story, laughing and shouting by the end. He took pride in his children and loved them all, having stories to tell about each one. He never reserved himself from letting any of his kids or grandkids know when they were doing something stupid, and was never afraid to speak his mind. His stubbornness knew no bounds. Once he made up his mind, there was no changing it.\n\nMany of his friends and family will remember his simple phrases “Dirty”, as a response to snarky comments made, “Nancy” if he thought you were being over dramatic, or calling everyone “Jack” at some point.\n\nBenjamin was preceded in death by his Father Benjamin Alfonso Aguirre, Mother Dorothy Benjamin Aguirre, and Baby Sister Aguirre, his Grandparents Nicholas Jose and Rachel Garcia Aguirre, Wesley Elijah and Alma Russell Benjamin, brother in-law Tom Venable, and Father in-law Max Young.\n\nBenjamin is survived by his sisters, Charity Aguirre, Carla (Gary) Fox, Carrie (Rob) Pederson. Kathy Millspaugh of Oregon, and their children Larry (Betty) Bennett, Donald Bennett, Dyna (DJ) McCarthy, Libertie (Brendan “Billy”) Jones. His ex-wife Toni Smith of California and their children, Raoul Childs, James Childs, Ryan Noble, Benjamin (Reylene) Aguirre, Tabbetha (James) Aguirre-Hunziker, Jonathan (Diana) Aguirre. His grandchildren Brandon (Ann) Bennett, Kasey (Talia) Bennett, Destiny (Jimmy) Yeager, Justice Aguirre, Elizabeth (Gabe) McBride, Claire and Tiberius Aguirre, Alexus, Alvin, and Jacob Hunziker, Angelina and Cheyanna Nalton, Makenzie Brewer, Tyson, Levi, and Christian Jones. Great grandchildren Tiegan, Lucas, Emily, Violet, and Link. Ben is also survived by numerous cousins, nieces and nephews that he held dear to his heart.\n\nSpecial thanks to MCPD, Miles City EMS, and the Emergency Room staff at Holy Rosary Hospital.
