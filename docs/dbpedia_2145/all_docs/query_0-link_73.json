A pediatrician, speaker and podcast host, she is a New York Times bestselling author of multiple books including The Care and Keeping of You series, with more than seven million copies in print, and the forthcoming This Is So Awkward: Modern Puberty Explained (Rodale Books, Oct. 2023). Along with her podcast co-host Vanessa Kroll Bennett, Cara shares all things puberty on Instagram and TikTok at @spillingthepubertea. Cara graduated from Harvard and Johns Hopkins Medical School and trained at UCSF.\n\nWhen her own daughter started puberty, Cara realized there was no company dedicated to making this decade of life more comfortable….so she started one. When her son entered puberty, she realized that there was even less puberty content and product aimed at males… so Cara decided to fix that, too!\n\nCO-FOUNDER\n\nJulie has been in the entertainment business for over 20 years, most recently overseeing film publicity at Netflix. She has worked in publicity and marketing leadership roles at Lionsgate, Disney and Miramax, where she was instrumental in over a hundred Academy Award campaigns. Julie is a member of the Academy of Motion Pictures and has served on the board of the New York Women's Foundation.\n\nPRESIDENT OF CONTENT\n\nVanessa is a puberty expert, podcaster, and writer who helps adults navigate uncertainty while supporting the kids they love. She is co-author of This Is So Awkward: Modern Puberty Explained (Rodale Books, October 2023), and co-host of The Puberty Podcast. Together with Cara Natterson, Vanessa shares thoughts, information and interviews on Instagram and TikTok at @spillingthepubertea.\n\nVanessa is also the founder of Dynamo Girl, a company focused on building kids’ self-esteem through sports and puberty education. Vanessa is a graduate of Wellesley College and holds a Masters in Jewish History. Most importantly, Vanessa thinks tweens and teens are the funniest, smartest people on earth, including her own four children, ages 12 to 20."
