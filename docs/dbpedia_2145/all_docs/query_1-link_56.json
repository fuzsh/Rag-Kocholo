        "text": "Board of Directors\n\nFARE is governed by a ten-member operating board known as the Board of Directors. FARE recently introduced two non-voting boards, the Board of Governors and the Board of National Ambassadors, to better position FARE to rapidly respond to the evolving landscape of food allergy and support the organization's growth.\n\nDavid Jaffe, Chair\n\nDavid Jaffe has long supported research and education initiatives to help the 33 million Americans with Food Allergies. Raising four children with severe food allergies, David and his wife Helen are the founding members of the Food Allergy Initiative, one of FARE’s legacy organization. In 1997 the Jaffes established the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute, the first medical research institute dedicated to food allergy research at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, a Discovery Center of Distinction in the FARE Clinical Network.\n\nDavid was recently a Senior Fellow in Harvard’s Advanced Leadership Initiative, where in addition to his academic work, he started SubjectToClimate, a not-for-profit venture that combines his interest in promoting education with fighting climate change. In addition, he is an angel investor and advisor to early-stage entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nUntil his retirement in 2019, David was the Chairman and CEO of Ascena Retail Group, Inc., a leading specialty retailer of apparel for women and tween girls. Ascena generated $7 billion in annual sales, operated over 4,500 stores across the U.S. and Canada and employed 65,000 associates through its eight distinct brands: Ann Taylor, Loft, Lou & Grey, Lane Bryant, Justice, Dressbarn, Maurices and Catherines.\n\nDavid began his retail career with Dressbarn in 1992 and spent 10 years learning all aspects of the business, becoming the President & CEO in 2002. David drove the transition of Dressbarn from an off-price discount store to a lifestyle specialty store brand. With that experience, David began an expansion of the company and led four successful acquisitions; the first with Maurices in 2005, followed by Justice in 2009, Lane Bryant and Catherines in 2012, and of ANN INC in 2015.\n\nDavid’s previous experience was as a General Partner of Chemical Venture Partners, a private equity firm, and as a portfolio manager at Merrill Lynch. He received an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business and his BS/BA from the Wharton School at theUniversity of Pennsylvania.\n\nDavid is a Director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, The Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Trustee of the Connecticut Chapter of The Nature Conservancy, and a former Director of the National Retail Federation and the Baker Retailing Center at the Wharton School.\n\nWith four grown children, each with life-long food allergies, David and his wife, Helen, have been long-time advocates on behalf of the food allergy community as well as for FARE.\n\nAlan Hartman, Vice Chair\n\nAlan Hartman has been a senior partner at Centerview Partners, a leading independent investment bank, since joining the firm in 2009 as a co-founder of its healthcare practice. In his over 25 years of investment banking experience, he has advised on almost $1 trillion of transactions that have helped transform the healthcare sector, including representing many of the largest and most respected pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Alan joined Centerview after 16 years at Merrill Lynch, where he was head of Americas Mergers & Acquisitions. Prior to joining Merrill Lynch, he spent four years as a corporate attorney at Skadden Arps. He is a graduate of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard Law School.\n\nMilton Brown, MD, PhD\n\nDr. Milton Brown serves as Professor of Practice and Director for the Center for Drug Discovery for Rare and Underserved Diseases at George Mason University and as Fellow at the National Academy of Inventors (FNAI). Dr. Brown is a physician-scientist who has expertise in the design, synthesis and evaluation of new drugs and is one of only a handful of physician-scientists in the U.S. to hold a PhD in synthetic chemistry and an MD. Dr. Brown is a recipient of the 2015 Percy Julian Award by the National Organization of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers for significant contributions in pure and/or applied research in science. He received a BS degree at Oakwood College, a PhD in organic chemistry at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and an MD at the University of Virginia.\n\nDavid G. Bunning\n\nDavid G. Bunning, founder and Chief Executive Officer of The TLP Group, LLC (TLP), is driven by the ultimate goal of developing effective treatments and a cure for life-threatening food allergies. Meeting regularly with leaders of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and with members of Congress, Bunning and his family foundation have brought attention to the growing impact of food allergies and the need for increased federal funding for food allergy research and treatments. Bunning helped spearhead the inaugural FARE symposium at Harvard Medical School, now known as FARE’s annual Contains: Courage® Research Retreat. He has been an active Board of Directors member for FARE and for the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. Bunning was instrumental in the merger of Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network and the Food Allergy Initiative to create FARE. He has a BA from Harvard College and an MBA from the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago.\n\nLeigh Feuerstein\n\nLeigh Feuerstein comes from a highly successful hedge fund and private equity career, specializing in tax, accounting, systems, fund structuring, deal structuring, asset raising and reconciliation projects. Most notably, under his six years as Partner and Chief Operating Officer/Chief Financial Officer of Element Capital, a global macro hedge fund, net assets grew from $250 million to $4+ billion where he oversaw all non-trading aspects of the business including accounting, operations, legal, compliance and investor relations. Simultaneously, Leigh invested in, raised capital, and served on boards for various companies, mostly in consumer packaged goods (CPG) such as Sensible Portions Veggie Straws (Sold), Rickland Orchards Greek Yogurt Bars (Sold), Dippin’ Chips, Thinsters Cookies (Sold), and SkinnyPop (Sold). This became the driving force behind his transition into the food company operating space, forming Halen Brands as Co-Chief Executive Officer, a leading better-for-you CPG focused investment portfolio company currently holding interest in Only What You Need (plant-based protein product) and Real Food From the Ground UP (plant-based snack company). Leigh currently serves as a board member of several companies, most notably IMH Financial Corporation (a public company) and ParmCrisps.\n\nEmily Glassman\n\nEmily Glassman has more than fifteen years of experience in financial services advising a vast clientele, ranging from large institutions to individual clients.

Goodman, JD\n\nNancy Goodman is founder and executive director of Kids v Cancer. Kids v Cancer promotes pediatric cancer research by identifying structural impediments at key junctures in the research process—new drugs, tissue donation and access to funding—and developing strategies to address them.\n\nThrough Kids v Cancer, Nancy championed the Creating Hope Act in 2012, which creates a market-based incentive to spur pediatric rare disease drug development. The Creating Hope Act was passed into law as USC 360ff. Since then, $1 billion in Creating Hope Act Priority Review Vouchers have traded with the last voucher trading at $350 million, providing a significant incentive for pediatric rare disease drug development.\n\nKids v Cancer is pressing for the RACE for Children Act to update the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), which was designed to require companies to test drugs being developed for adults on kids, but which has been interpreted in a way that does not cover pediatric cancer. By updating PREA to require companies to share drugs that act upon the same markers as those active in pediatric cancers, we expect to open up vast new opportunities for pediatric cancer drug development.\n\nGoodman founded Kids v Cancer after her son, Jacob Froman, died of medulloblastoma. Earlier in her career, she was an international trade lawyer. Goodman received her JD from the University of Chicago and her MPP from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.\n\nLee Helman, MD\n\nLee J. Helman received his MD from the University of Maryland School of Medicine magna cum laude and was elected to Alpha Omega Alpha.

He did his post-doctoral training in the Molecular Genetics Section, Pediatric Branch, NCI, and then became Head of the Molecular Oncology Section, Pediatric Oncology Branch, NCI. He served as Chief of the Pediatric Oncology Branch from 1997-2007 and as Scientific Director for Clinical Research in the Center for Cancer Research, NCI, from 2007 to 2016. He joined Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) and the University of Southern California (USC) from 20017-2020 as professor of Pediatrics and Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine and director of Basic and Translational Research within the Children’s Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases at CHLA and a member of the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. He currently is the Director of the Osteosarcoma Institute. He was elected to the American Society for Clinical Investigation and the American Association of Physicians and is a founding member and past president of the Connective Tissue Oncology Society. He received the 2011 ASCO Pediatric Oncology Award and is a Fellow of ASCO. He serves as a vice chair of the Scientific Advisory Committee of Stand Up To Cancer, a scientific partner to the AACR.\n\nHelen Jaffe\n\nTogether with her husband David, Helen Jaffe is one of the founding members of the Food Allergy Initiative, one of FARE’s legacy organizations. Raising four children with severe food allergies, Helen created educational initiatives, school food allergy policies and advocacy efforts to support bills including requiring food manufacturers to make labels that identify allergens in easy-to-understand language. She also chaired efforts that led to passage of Connecticut’s stock epinephrine bill. The law – responding to the preventable 2012 death of a kindergarten student in Virginia – requires all schools to stock and deploy epinephrine auto-injectors to help any child experiencing an anaphylactic reaction. In 1997 the Jaffes established the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute, the first medical research institute dedicated to food allergy research at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, a Discovery Center of Distinction in the FARE Clinical Network. Along with her husband, Helen has received numerous honors for this work, including FARE’s Vision Award for Outstanding Achievement in Community Engagement.\n\nAdam Miller, Ex Officio Member\n\nAdam Miller is a Managing Partner at AllerFund, the first venture fund focused on food allergy companies. To support the food allergic community, Adam led the merger of Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) and Food Allergy Initiative (FAI) to create FARE, seeded Aimmune with Dave Bunning (which developed the first FDA-approved treatment for food allergies), and helped build the UCLA Food Allergy Program in Los Angeles. Adam also was the founder and 20-year CEO of Cornerstone OnDemand. Under his leadership, Cornerstone went public and became one of the largest cloud computing companies in the world. Today, Cornerstone products are used by more than 7,000 organizations worldwide, empowering more than 75 million people in 192 countries. Adam’s other nonprofit work includes serving as Chairman of Team Rubicon from 2013-2020, where he helped create America’s leading veterans service organization, and co-founding 1P.org, a social enterprise focused on addressing some of the most intractable problems facing our one planet.\n\nEdith Perez, MD\n\nEdith A. Pérez is a Puerto Rican hematologist-oncologist. Perez was born and raised in Humacao, Puerto Rico. Her mother was a teacher and librarian and her father owned a grocery store.
