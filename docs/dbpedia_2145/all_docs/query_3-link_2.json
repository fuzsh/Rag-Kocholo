        "text": "Celebrity guest: Clementine, one of our youngest readers!\n\nI just put up a post about St. Anne’s feast day yesterday, and now this — what better way to celebrate St. Anne even more than with a special guest post!\n\nI received an email from a reader a few months ago that made by whole year — she’s fourteen years old and had written to me to let me know how much she loves the blog and how much she loves babies and baby names. How many of us can see ourselves in her?? I asked this young lady if she would be interested in writing a guest post explaining about her interest in names, and I was delighted that she said yes! (I was sure to secure her parents’ approval as well.) I know you’ll all enjoy reading this!\n\n💐💖💐💖💐💖💐💖💐💖💐💖\n\nBeing named Clementine, and being born 14 years ago before my name supposedly became more popular, I’ve always been curious about why I am named Clementine, and I suppose that curiosity grew into an interest in all names. I am named Clementine Marie; Clementine because my parents loved the name (though they’ve never told me a specific reason), and Marie after Mary our Mother and my Mom’s middle name.\n\nI have loved the Sancta Nomina blog since I was introduced to it in October, and I read all the archives over a couple months :).\n\nI am the oldest of 5 children, with 4 younger brothers. I was actually allowed to help choose my youngest brother’s name. My Dad gave me the two choices (Thomas or Albert), and I picked Thomas. I was ten at that time. Maybe some day Thomas will thank me for that.\n\nI have always found names fascinating, and over the past four years I’ve kept a spreadsheet of all the birth announcements from my grandparents’ newspaper; my grandmother clips and saves them for me, and I occasionally get them in the mail. I use my spreadsheet data to make bar graphs of the most popular first and middle names each year (separating boys and girls), and I compare the results with the national trends. (Sometimes there are some strange names.) So far this year Ava and Piper are tied for the lead for girls, and Oliver is leading the boys. Several times I’ve noticed that people who had a baby a couple years ago are now having another, so sibling name-sets is another thing I’ve ended up keeping track of.\n\nMy taste in names has definitely changed as I’ve gotten older. When my brother and I were really little we had Lego families, and the children in mine were given names such as John, Paul, Catherine, Gianna, etc.\n\nOver the past few years I’ve gradually started to like more obscure names, and I keep a running list for future children.\n\nSome girl names on my list are:\n\nAzalea Louise, nicknamed Zelie; Louise is my Confirmation name for St. Louise de Marillac, and Azalea because of St. Zelie.\n\nFaustina; I really want one of my future daughters to have the middle name of Faustina after St. Faustina, because God’s mercy and love needs to be shown to everyone.\n\nI also like the names Miriam, Rosamond, Magdalena, and Sophia.\n\nFor boys I like these names:\n\nEdmund Louis, after St. Edmund Campion and Bl. Louis Francois.\n\nJude Francis de Sales; St. Francis de Sales is amazing!\n\nTheodore Dismas; I know Theodore is popular, but I like it anyways, and Dismas after the Good Thief.\n\nI also like the names Oliver, Phineas, and Dominic.\n\nSometimes whenever our friends from Church have babies I will give the parents suggestions. It’s probably really annoying, but one couple used an idea of mine (although I think they were already considering it).\n\nBy the way, feel free to check out my blog at https://holy2thelord.wordpress.com/.\n\n💐💖💐💖💐💖💐💖💐💖💐💖\n\nI hope you all enjoyed reading this as much as I did! I’m sure we’d all love a peek at Clementine’s bar graphs — that’s fascinating information! I hope you all have a wonderful weekend!\n\nFor help with Marian names, my book, Catholic Baby Names for Girls and Boys: Over 250 Ways to Honor Our Lady (Marian Press, 2018), is available to order from ShopMercy.org and Amazon (not affiliate links). It’s perfect for expectant parents, name enthusiasts, and lovers of Our Lady!\n\nHappy feast of St. Anne!\n\nYesterday was the feast of St. Anne! Longtime readers will know that’s a big deal for Sancta Nomina, as St. Anne is our patroness. Every year since I started the blog, I’ve tried to make a pilgrimage of some kind to a St. Anne church or shrine in order to thank her for her intercession. You can read about each previous one:\n\n2023 St. Ann by the Sea in Marshfield, MA\n\n2022 St. Anne niche at the Holy Family Church in Syracuse, NY\n\n2021 St. Anne came to me when I couldn’t go to her via a friend’s thoughtful gift of a beautiful St. Anne Shrine by Violets and Moss\n\n2020 St. Ann’s in Fort Ann, NY\n\n2019 St. Mary and St. Anne’s Cathedral in Cork, Co. Cork, Ireland\n\n2018 Shrine of St. Anne for Mothers in Waterbury, CT\n\n2017 Basilica of the National Shrine of St. Ann in Scranton, PA\n\n2016 St. Anne Shrine in Sturbridge, MA\n\n2015 Saint Anne’s Shrine in Isle La Motte, VT\n\n(And you can read an article I wrote on taking pilgrimages with small children in tow: Pilgrimages for Parents of Young Families.)\n\nLast night I was able to post on Instagram about my 2024 “pilgrimage,” the difficulty of which lay mostly in going out on a Friday night when there were a bunch of things going on at home. (Orrrr … some may think that’s not a difficulty at all? 😉 But no, for a homebody like me, leaving the house is almost always harder than staying home.) A church near me called Notre Dame-Visitation (such a beautiful name!) had a beautiful Mass in honor of St. Anne, sponsored by the Daughters of St. Anne, whom I’d never heard of! I haven’t been able to find anything about them — they’re a lay group, not the Order of Sisters that I keep finding in my searches — and the priest who said Mass, who I know, was surprised to see me there (since it’s not my home parish) and said, “Are you a Daughter of St. Anne?” Of course I wanted to say yes! Even though I know that’s not what he was asking. Anyway! It was a beautiful Mass, and as I always do during these pilgrimages, I prayed for the entire Sancta Nomina community and all your intentions. 🩷🩷🩷 St. Anne, pray for us!\n\n(I’m about to post a special guest post — check back in a few minutes!)\n\nFor help with Marian names, my book, Catholic Baby Names for Girls and Boys: Over 250 Ways to Honor Our Lady (Marian Press, 2018), is available to order from ShopMercy.org and Amazon (not affiliate links). It’s perfect for expectant parents, name enthusiasts, and lovers of Our Lady!\n\nBaby name consultation: Short, soft but strong names with good meaning for baby boy\n\nHappy feast of St. Mary Magdalene! Here‘s an article I wrote a few years ago in celebration of her feast day in which I offer some of the ways that she has popped up throughout history.\n\nToday’s consultation is for Hannah and her husband who are expecting baby no. 2 — a little boy! Little Mister joins big sister:\n\nRafaella (“We named our daughter Rafaella and call her both Ella and her given name. Rafael is a family name on my side of the family, and it ended up that we found out she’s a girl on the heavenly birthday [not her official feast day but the day she died] of the only female St. Rafaela in the Church – St. Rafaela Porras Ayllón. It was one of our top two names and then it ended up that God already knew she was a Rafaella.”)\n\nIsn’t that an amazing story?? And such a beautiful name!!\n\nHannah writes,\n\n“Right now we have two names we are thinking of choosing between, Leo Dominic and Peter Ambrose. I think we both like Dominic as a middle name for Peter too. Both names are ones that were not on our radar as possible baby boy names with our first pregnancy, and were not names we were considering when we found out this one is a boy.\n\nAfter finding out, my husband had a dream that our son was 6 months old and we were still throwing out possible names to name him. One of those names was Leo. The morning after his dream, and before he even told me about it, the name Leo popped into my head.\n\nThe name Peter came to me just before I became pregnant, or it could have been within the first week before I knew I was. I had never considered it as a possible name for us before.\n\nI like the name, but I don’t like the nicknames for it.\n\nAt the moment, it doesn’t seem we’ll have a name for our son until we meet him when he’s born … but it would be nice to have it narrowed down beforehand.\n\nI am looking to see if there are other names we should be considering. Especially if they’re shorter and have good meanings behind them. It is also a plus if they can’t easily be nicknamed.\n\nOne of the top boy names we had last time was Dominic, but after finding out we’re having a son, it doesn’t feel right for this little boy.\n\nSebastian, Jacob, Gabriel, and Theodore are other names we have tossed around. We like Sebastian but it’s a bit long. We love Jacob but I’m not a fan of the meaning. We like Gabriel, but I don’t like any of the nicknames. It’s also another archangel name. We both do like Theodore with the nickname Theo.\n\nIt seems our naming style for a boy is a bit different than for a girl. Top names for a girl were Serafina, Evangeline, Magdalena, and Agnes. Agnes being the only one out of the ordinary in that list!\n\nOur top names for this boy turned into Leo, Peter, and Jacob. We do like that they are shorter. I like that they sound softer like our daughter’s name, and also strong.”\n\nNames they can’t use include (though Hannah particularly loves Andrew nn Drew, Benjamin, and James):\n\nAndrew\n\nJonathan\n\nStephen\n\nDavid\n\nTimothy\n\nMichael\n\nJames\n\nThomas\n\nBenjamin\n\nNathan\n\nCharles\n\nDaniel\n\nRobert\n\nPatrick\n\nThis was fun to work on! I loved reading about Hannah’s husband’s dream and that she was thinking about the name Leo even before her hubby told her about it! Leo certainly has all the things they’re looking for: shorter, good meaning, not easily nicknamed (though it might be helpful to know that I have a bunch of Leos in my family and while the younger generations are able to enforce the full Leo, the olders tend to go by Lee!), and I think it goes great with big sister Rafaella. Leo Dominic is a really handsome combo!\n\nPeter is also a great name! I especially like it paired with a more unexpected middle name like Ambrose; I also quite like Peter Dominic. I have a friend whose son is Peter Damian, after Doctor of the Church St. Peter Damian, which I’ve always thought was a cool combo. That said, Peter does seem less well suited than Leo, based on the fact that it’s not a shorter name (though technically does have the same number of syllables as Leo), it’s easily nicknamed (and Hannah doesn’t like the nicknames), and it doesn’t have that “biblical-ish name dream” story that Leo has … I wonder if they might like the variant Pier, either as an unexpected nickname for Peter, or as a given name? Bl. Pier Giorgio Frassati is the inspiration here, and though his devotees tend to get upset about people using Pier to honor him, since he went by Giorgio in life, I wouldn’t let that stop this anyone who was interested in using Pier — we use parts and variants of Saints’ names all the time to honor them (e.g., Charles and Lolek for St. John Paul II).\n\nIn addition to Leo and Peter, they have a great list of possibilities! I thought I’d offer my thoughts on them, in case they’re helpful:\n\nDominic: While I love Dominic — it’s one of my very favorites! — I’m not too disappointed that they’re not really considering it for a first name for this baby, since I think siblings Rafaella and Dominic come across as having a heavy ethnic feel — Italian-ish or Spanish, Latinate of some kind. That doesn’t have to be a problem! I actually really love it when families lean into their heritage when naming their babies! But I didn’t see any evidence in Hannah’s email or in her last name to suggest that she or her husband have heritage of that nature? Again, that doesn’t have to be a problem — Catholic parents often choose names of beloved Saints outside of their own family heritage! I love that we have such a wide pool of names to choose from! But it might make them feel boxed in to use Dominic after Rafaella — siblings Rafaella, Dominic, and Jacob sound a little jarring, for example. (Again, that doesn’t have to be a problem! There’s no reason they can’t choose names that sound jarring together, and honestly, many people wouldn’t even notice! I just want to be sure I share all the thoughts that I think are relevant.)\n\nSebastian: Sebastian is long! It’s got lots of fun nicknames like Seb, Sebby, Bastian, and Bash; my kids also have a friend Sebastian who goes by Baz. But if they’re trying to stay away from nicknames, Sebastian probably isn’t the right name for them!\n\nJacob: Though Jacob was buried in the list of names Hannah and her husband have discussed, later on in her email Hannah said that Leo, Peter, and Jacob are their top frontrunners. I love the name Jacob! Like with Peter, I like the idea of an unexpected middle name for Jacob, since it’s such a familiar name. Also, I know they prefer not to use a nickname, but I think Jake is one of the very best! So friendly yet strong. (As a side note, Hannah said James is a name she likes, though they can’t use it because it’s a cousin’s name — I just wanted to point out that Jacob and James are the same name! Jacob is the Hebrew and James is the Latin.)\n\nGabriel: Gabriel is one of my very favorite boy names ever! However, with big sister Rafaella I like it better as a middle for this family, at least for this baby immediately following Rafaella (never the heavy Archangel influence!). Peter Gabriel would be great if the music association doesn’t bother them! A name that I thought might be able to take Gabriel’s place on their list is Gideon — there isn’t a natural nickname for it (though I’ve been partial to something like Gideon Louis with the nickname Gil) and he’s a huge hero in the Old Testament.\n\nTheodore: I’m not surprised Hannah and her hubby like Theodore and Theo, since Leo is high on their list! Based on their preference for shorter names that don’t nickname easily, I would say Leo is a better fit for them, however, I also have a friend who recently named her son Theo (not Theodore), so that’s an option, too. Also, I think it’s the kind of thing where they can use either Leo or Theo(dore), not both, so they’ll want to give some thought to which one they like better, or which one they’d be sorrier to lose.\n\nEven though they can’t use Andrew/Drew, Benjamin, and James, I’m glad Hannah mentioned that she loves them, as they gave me extra information to use in my research.\n\nI’m also glad she mentioned the names on their girl list! Serafina, Evangeline, and Magdalena all have a similar feel to Rafaella in my mind; Agnes is a little surprising, but I’m seeing it more and more. Though it’s very common for parents to prefer different styles of name for their girls versus their boys, I think there’s also usually a sense of not wanting the two styles to clash, so it was helpful to see what they’re thinking for a future daughter.\n\nAlright! On to new ideas! I did my usual research in the Baby Name Wizard (affiliate link) as it lists, for each entry, boy and girl names that are similar in terms of style/feel/popularity. I also paid special attention to names that are shorter, have good meaning, and aren’t easily nicknamed, as well as names that I thought fit their preference for “soft but strong.” Based on all that, these are names that I think Hannah and her husband might like:\n\n(1) Joachim nn Jake\n\nOkay, despite the fact that they’d prefer not to nickname, I just had to mention this idea! I absolutely love the name Joachim and tried to convince my husband of it through several of our boys. Not only is this the name we honor Our Lady’s father under, but I had thought that the nickname Jake really “made” this idea! (We couldn’t use Joe.) Since they love Jacob, I thought I’d throw that out there.\n\n(2) Caleb\n\nJacob was a big inspiration behind this idea, too, as Caleb is a style match for it and I often see that parents who like Jacob also like Caleb. Caleb is one of the sweetest, softest boy names I know! While it’s generally considered to derive from the Hebrew word for “dog,” which isn’t the greatest meaning, there’s also a theory that it could mean “whole, all of” plus “heart,” which is wonderful. Even the dog meaning isn’t bad — St. Dominic is known as the hound of heaven, so Caleb Dominic could actually be very meaningful to anyone with a Dominican sensibility!\n\n(3) Bennett\n\nSince they can’t use Benjamin, there’s a good bet they can’t use Bennett, either, because of the shared Ben nickname, but if there was a chance they could use Bennett, I think they might like it! It’s a medieval diminutive of Benedict, so it’s got great faith connections, and I think it has that softer feel they’re looking for.\n\n(4) Matthias\n\nI was excited to see that Matthias is a style match for a bunch of names they like, first and foremost Rafaella! It’s also a match for Dominic, Serafina, and Evangeline — that’s amazing to me! It’s one of my favorite biblical names, and I often think of it as having Catholic character because Matthias was chosen by the apostles — the first “Church council”?? 😉— to replace Judas.\n\n(5) Milo or Miles\n\nMilo is a style match for Leo and another name I think they’d probably like to consider if they didn’t already have Ella: Elliott. I have always loved Milo’s amazing meaning: “devotee of the Virgin Mary” via an Old Irish name with that meaning that Milo has traditionally been used as the anglicized version of (Maelmhuire). I also think Milo has a softer feel while still being squarely masculine. However, I worry that Milo might take Leo and Theo out of the running, so the variant Miles might appeal to them more — it shares the same Marian meaning as Milo, as it, too, has traditionally been used as the anglicized form of Maelmhuire. Miles can also take the added meaning of “soldier” as the Latin for soldier is miles. Very cool for a little boy!\n\n(6) Oliver\n\nOliver showed up so much in my research for this baby! It’s a style match for Leo, Sebastian, Theodore, and Madeline (standing in for Magdalena, which doesn’t have its own entry in the BNW; Madeline’s matches have often seemed to me to be similar to what Magdalena’s might be); additionally, I know a little Oliver who has brothers named Benjamin and James, so it definitely seems like a name Hannah and her husband would like! I would also definitely put it in the “softer” category.\n\n(7) Simon\n\nThis is another match for Leo, and one that I would consider “softer.” I know of two little boys named Simon Peter — maybe that’s how they can work Peter in? As a middle name for Simon? (For what it’s worth, both little Simon Peters I know use it as a double first name!)\n\n(8) Tobias, Tobiah\n\nTobias is a match for Dominic and Evangeline — it’s always fun for me to see a name that is a match for both boy names and girl names on parents’ lists! It’s the Greek form of Tobiah, which they might also like — the “ah” ending gives it a softer feel. Tobias and Tobiah mean “Yahweh is good,” which is great!\n\nAnd those are all my ideas! What do you all think? What names would you suggest for Rafaella/Ella’s little brother?\n\nFor help with Marian names, my book, Catholic Baby Names for Girls and Boys: Over 250 Ways to Honor Our Lady (Marian Press, 2018), is available to order from ShopMercy.org and Amazon (not affiliate links). It’s perfect for expectant parents, name enthusiasts, and lovers of Our Lady!\n\nBaby name consultation: Mary, family, strength, beauty, and nickname options for baby no. 3’s name\n\nHappy Monday! There are a bunch of holy people celebrated today — some that jumped out at me are two popes (Pope St. Adrian III and Bl. Pope Eugene III), St. Morwenna, and St. Sunniva of Bergen.\n\nPlease remember that as of July 2 (as I wrote in the post that day), I’m suspending consultations indefinitely due to various things going on in my life (all good!). I will continue to post consultations I’ve already done for those families who want public posts, and I have some birth announcements and other things to post this summer as well; I also always keep you all in my prayers! 🩷🩷🩷\n\nToday’s consultation is for Annelise and her husband, who are expecting their third baby very soon! This little one is a green bean (=gender unknown) 🌱 and joins big sibs:\n\nMariana Catharine (“She is named after both my mother and great grandmother – both Catharina Maria – with her own unique twist on the family tradition. Mariana also catches my husbands paternal grandmother Mary and mine and my MIL’s middle name, Marie. I love that her name is not only three of my favorite saints, Mary, Anne and Catherine, but also so deeply rooted in our family and Austrian heritage on my mom’s side. She chose her own nickname – Mari. Which suits her perfectly! If she had been a boy, she would have been James William“)\n\nHenry James (“While I was pregnant with him, he came to me in a dream and told me his name. When I woke up, I very excitedly told my husband I met our baby and not only is it a boy but he told me his name. Every fiber of my being knew we had to go with this name for him. When he was finally born, holding him was surreal because he was absolutely the same baby as in my dream. His name carries a lot of family significance on my husband’s side. My husband is named after his grandfather Hale James [“Jim”], who was named after his father James Hale. My husband loves that our Henry has the same initials [HJB] as his grandfather, who passed not long before Henry was born. While Henry the 8th gives the name some bad PR, there are a few wonderful Saint Henry’s we love! And James goes without saying. We love the nickname Hank and our Henry really brings it to life. He is all things boy, tough and wild! If he had been a girl, he would have been Lillian Alexandra“)\n\nMariana Catharine and Henry James are such attractive combos and I love that they have faith and family significance. Mari and Hank are such sweet sibling names!\n\nAnnelise writes,\n\n“For this baby, I’ve been feeling my heart connect to only one name – Maddalena. Which is both wonderful and challenging. I love that this name, like Mariana, has so much familiarity to it and yet is very unique. It sounds both new and old at the same time. It’s a beautiful connection to Mary Magdalene, who’s feast day is in July, and is full of nickname potential! The cons are that my husband isn’t a big fan. His worries are that it is too long, too easily misspelled and worries if it is too similar to Mariana. He would prefer the more common, Madeline.\n\nWhen it comes to boy names, we love the idea of using my husband’s middle name as the middle name. Christopher is also my husband’s father’s middle name. Unfortunately, we have not been able to agree on a first name we both like that works well with Christopher. So we aren’t fully committed to this idea.\n\nStylistically, I am drawn to romantic, lyrical names for girls and regal, traditional names for boys. I care very little about how popular a name is and actually prefer, especially for girls, more unique names with strength, beauty and nickname options. I love when a name has deep religious significance, family and personal ties. My own name is Annelise Marie. I grew up with a unique name and nickname (Lissi) and loved it. I love that it calls to Saints Anne, Elizabeth and Mary. My own name has that unique but sounds familiar feel that Mariana and Maddalena have.\n\nMy husband, however, is drawn to names that sound very familiar and aren’t too exotic. He would happily choose from the 25 most popular names in the US, while I read those as a list of names to avoid, particularly for girls! lol He is on board with using first and middle saint names.”\n\nSome names that Annelise likes include:\n\nDiana\n\nLouisa/Louise\n\nCecilia\n\nElisa\n\nGeorge\n\nOwen\n\nOtto\n\nMichael\n\nCharles\n\nSome names her husband likes include:\n\nCecilia\n\nCharlotte\n\nDelaney\n\nMackenzie\n\nMichaela\n\nJohn/Jack\n\nCharles\n\nSome family names that might be nice to include are:\n\nGeorge\n\nWilliam\n\nJohn\n\nMichael\n\nQuinn (could be for boy or girl)\n\nSaints they love include:\n\nSt. Padre Pio\n\nSt. Anne\n\nSt. Mary Magdalene\n\nSt. Clare\n\nSt. Teresa\n\nSt. Azelie\n\nSome additional considerations:\n\n“Mary has always been my guiding force. I feel profoundly called by her and close to her. Some of her titles I love are Our lady of the Mystical Rose, Our Lady of Guadalupe, Queen of Heaven, Queen of All Saints.\n\nHard no list: While we both love Charles, we simply can’t do it with our last name.\n\n[Annelise’s grandfather recently passed.] His passing was expected … but has not come easily. He was an extraordinary man and so well loved by his family.\n\nI think it would be wonderful to honor him somehow in naming this baby.” His full name included Floyd, Eldo, and Quinn.\n\nAdditionally, Annelise shared a portion of her family tree with me, which I had such fun looking through — so many great names on there!\n\nI also really loved hearing the names Annelise and her husband would have given each of their older kiddos if they’d been the opposite sex — James William and Lillian Alexandra give a good sense of their style. I know some people consider the names their children would have been named to be off limits going forward — I’m assuming that’s how they feel?\n\nAs for the names they’re considering, I’d love to offer my thoughts in case they’re helpful:\n\nMaddalena: This is, indeed, a gorgeous name! I like how Annelise characterized it as “both new and old at the same time,” and I love that St. Mary Magdalene’s feast is in the month she’s due. I would love to help figure out a name in her honor that Annelise and her hubby both like! I’m interested that he thinks it’s too similar to Mariana — I’m sorry to say that I had a similar thought when I first read it, especially because the “r” in Mariana would sound more like a “d” for Spanish speakers, which is something I think of because we have a large population of Spanish speakers where I live. But that may not be their situation, which would certainly make Maddalena less problematic from that perspective. If we put aside for just a second the fact that Annelise has “been feeling [her] heart connect to only” Maddalena as a first name (which is definitely an important consideration!), some possible solutions or compromises between you and your husband could be:\n\nMaddalena as a middle name: Moving Maddalena to the middle spot could make Annelise’s hubby feel more okay with them using this form that she prefers. If they did so, they could use a first name that they both agree upon and really just leave Maddalena as the seldom-seen middle name, or they could incorporate Maddalena into the everyday call name. For this family, my favorite idea would be Mary Maddalena. It’s an old but traditional practice in several Catholic cultures (Irish, French, Spanish, Italian) for every daughter in a family to have a form of Mary as their first name, even if they exclusively go by their middles. Considering that Mariana already has a Marian first name, they could consider Mary Maddalena as their second baby’s given name (first + middle), and call her by a nickname of Maddalena. If you used Lena, there’s no issue at all with Mariana and Maddalena being similar — Mari and Lena are great together! You could also do something Rose Maddalena and do a mashup nickname from the first + middle like Romy or Reina.\n\nA different form: Maddalena and Madeline are sort of the two ends of the spectrum regarding the names to honor this Saint. I wonder if something more in the middle would be agreeable to them both? I’m thinking Magdalene (or Magdalen, Magdalyn) — it’s not as familiar as Madeline but not as potentially problematic as Maddalena (especially in terms of not being as similar to Mariana). It also has more of a surname feel, like Delaney and Mackenzie on Annelise’s husband’s list. Another option is Magali, which I don’t see often — I knew a woman with this name a long time ago, it’s the Occitan (French) form.\n\nCecilia: Because Annelise and her husband have pretty different lists except for Cecilia, which they both share, Cecilia is definitely high on my list for them! I love it as a sister to Mariana and I love it on its own, but I also love the idea of something like Mary Cecilia as mentioned above.\n\nLouisa/Louise: Both lovely names, but they made me think of two other names that I would think of as a closer match for this family: Lucia for a girl and Louis for a boy. I wonder what they would think of those?\n\nDiana: I find this one surprising! But when I consider that Annelise prefers “regal” names for boys, Diana makes sense. I don’t love that it has the same ending as Mariana though.\n\nElisa: This is one of my favorites for this family because of its connection to Annelise’s name! I love that Mariana has “ana” like her Anne, and using Elisa for her second daughter would give both her girls a nice connection to her. Because she likes “romantic and lyrical” names for girls, including the very Italian Maddalena, I wonder what she would think of the Italian form of Elizabeth, Elisabetta? Elisa could still be the nickname.\n\nCharlotte: Even though Annelise don’t have this on her personal list, Charlotte is a style match for Louisa, and since they both like Charles but can’t use it, maybe Charlotte is a good compromise?\n\nDelaney, Mackenzie: These names Annelise’s husband likes are definitely different from the ones she likes, but they gave me an idea for some that might be good compromises — I’ve included those ideas in my list of “official” suggestions below.\n\nMichaela: I’m interested by Michaela — it can have a Delaney/Mackenzie feel (as in McKayla), but in the spelling Michaela it has a more traditional feel. I’ve actually always loved it and had it on my own list.\n\nChristopher as middle name: I love their tentative plan of using Annelise’s hubby’s middle name for the baby if they have a boy! It’s so meaningful that it’s also her father-in-law’s middle name. Since she said they haven’t been able to agree on a first name they both like that works well with Christopher, I wondered what they’d think of considering Hale as a middle name? It’s a middle name that would clearly be for Annelise’s husband’s side of the family, and it has a totally different sound and rhythm from Christopher, which might mean that it would work well with names that wouldn’t work well with Christopher.\n\nGeorge: This definitely fits into the “regal, traditional” feel Annelise prefers for boys. Georgie is such a fun nickname, and I also love Geo and Geordie.\n\nOwen: I loved seeing Owen three times in Annelise’s family tree! I’m not sure what I think about it for a first name for them, though … it has a different feel from George and Charles, for example … I have always loved St. Nicholas Owen — I could see loving them using it in that way (as a middle name for Nicholas, as a direct nod to that Saint, while also looping in their family name), or as a middle in general.\n\nOtto: Otto is very cool, but this helps me articulate a thought I’ve been trying to formulate: the mix of ethnicities they have represented in their name lists is unexpected, especially given their very English surname. Even though Mariana is listed in Behind the Name as Portuguese, Spanish, Romanian, Czech, Bulgarian, and Ancient Roman, I think it, and similar names like Juliana, have been used enough that they don’t come across as obviously ethnic. Maddalena, however, is clearly Italian, and if then if they add in Owen, which has a more Irish feel, and especially Otto, which has a very German feel, people who pay attention to names might take notice. I know Annelise has German and Austrian ancestry, so Otto totally makes sense for them! I guess I’m feeling like Otto calls names like Maddalena into question more, which I’m not sure they want to do. Or maybe it doesn’t matter to them! And it doesn’t have to necessarily! (** ETA: Annelise subsequently shared with me that she had a very international upbringing, which has definitely informed her taste in names. So cool! **)\n\nMichael: Michael on Annelise’s list and Michaela on her husband’s is interesting … Michael is certainly solid, handsome, and saintly for a boy!\n\nCharles: I’m so bummed that they both love Charles but they can’t use it! I wonder if the variants Carlo (like for Bl. Carlo Acutis — soon to be St. Carlo!) or Karol (St. JP2’s birth name) appeal to them?\n\nJohn/Jack: John with the nickname Jack seems like a perfect name for this family. John has the “regal, traditional” feel that Annelise prefers, and Jack feels like her husband’s style. John is probably my top choice for this family of the names Annelise and her hubby are considering! It also has the amazing quality of going well with all kinds of middle names — it can serve to “normalize” the more out-there middle names, too, in the same way that I’ve always thought Mary as a first name does for girl names. When I was looking through Annelise’s family tree and saw a relative named John George, I immediately loved John George as a combo for them! But I also love John Christopher! And John Pio! And John Charles! I think John Christopher nicknamed Jack is what I would recommend — it seems like a name that hits all the right notes (family, faith, and a name that both Annelise and her husband are likely to like).\n\nWilliam: I really love names that work to honor both sides of the family!\n\nQuinn: I love Quinn as a possible middle name! I’m not as much of a fan of it for a first name for them — if they were doing all Owen-type names, then yes, definitely Quinn! But with Maddalena and Otto in the mix as well, I would prefer Quinn in the middle. George O’Quinn, John O’Quinn, William Quinn, and I love Mary Quinn for a girl (sounds like Mary, Queen)! This is a nice, easy way to honor both Annelise’s mom and her grandfather.\n\nSpeaking of, I want to spend a minute talking about Annelise’s grandfather specifically and her family tree more generally — I have so many ideas to share! First off: her beloved grandpa. I had so much fun thinking about his name! I looked it up to see if the meanings of any of his names might be helpful, and Behind the Name says Floyd is a variant of Lloyd, which means “grey.” Grey! What a cool name! I think it could work for a boy (for a first or middle) or a girl (probably more as a middle — the new Hunger Games book/movie has Lucy Gray Baird as one of the main characters, and she goes by the double Lucy Gray, so I wouldn’t do that that combo [though I love it!], but Maddalena Grey is a very intriguing combo!) But only if Annelise was sure to feel like her grandpa was represented in a meaningful way if Grey was used somehow!\n\nThen, Eldo: I’m so intrigued by Eldo! It’s kind of a mystery name! It’s not in Behind the Name’s database (I consider Behind the Name to be the most trustworthy in terms of name meaning, origin, etc.) so I had to venture out into sites of questionable reputation and found that it could be of Aramaic origin via South India meaning “birth of Christ” (source, source) (would be cool if Annelise or her hubby had any ties to India in their family!), or it could be of Spanish/Galician/Portuguese origin meaning “happy, joyful” (source). Both of those meanings are amazing! They inspired some of my suggestions below. Also, Christopher could nod to Eldo if they accept the “birth of Christ” meaning!\n\nThen, further in Annelise’s family tree, I found some really lovely names and combos, some of which also inspired some ideas below. It was cool to see Cecilia — a name they both love, and it’s also a family name! Regina is a middle name for one of her ancestors, which means “queen” and has a long, impeccable tradition of being used for Catholic girls in honor of Our Lady. It could be used in honor of Queen of Heaven and Queen of All Saints, as Annelise noted she loves those titles. Other variants include the Spanish Reina (RAY-na) and the French Reine (REN). Could be cool for a middle name! Ooooh and I’m just thinking, they could use Reina as a mashup-type nickname for Rose/Rosa Maddalena, which would get Mystical Rose, St. Mary Magdalene, and any of Our Lady’s titles as Queen in one name! Gah! I’m loving that idea!\n\nSpeaking of Marian titles, Annelise said that some of her titles that she most likes are Mystical Rose, Our Lady of Guadalupe, Queen of Heaven, and Queen of All Saints. I wonder if she would ever consider Rosa Mystica as a first + middle combo? Any of the Rose names could honor that title (Rose, Rosa, Rosemary, Rosalie), and could also honor Our Lady of Guadalupe, too. They’re considering John for a boy, which could also nod to Our Lady of Guadalupe because of St. Juan Diego (Juan is the Spanish form of John). And I already mentioned some ways of working in “queen” (Regina, Reina, Reine), but the “of heaven” part could be fun to play with: Regina Caeli is “Queen of Heaven” in Latin, with Caeli said like CHAY-lee — I’ve seen some families name daughters Caeli (first name) in honor of this title. Celeste means “heavenly,” so that could work too: Regina Celeste, Reina Celeste, Celeste Regina. Annelise and her hubby both like Cecilia, and the very similar Celia, which can work as a nickname for Cecilia but is also its own name with separate etymology, means “heaven” — maybe that? Celia Regina, or mixing it up to something like Celia Rose or Celia Rosemary, could be lovely and meaningful from a Marian perspective.\n\nOkay! On to new ideas! As noted, I was inspired by Annelise’s family tree, and I also did my usual research, looking up Mariana as well as the names they’re considering in the Baby Name Wizard (affiliate link) as it lists, for each entry, boy and girl names that are similar in terms of style/feel/popularity. I really tried to harness a “romantic, lyrical” feel for girl names and a “regal, traditional” feel for boy names. Based on all that, these are my ideas:\n\nGirl\n\n(1) Elena\n\nThis idea was inspired by a couple things. I didn’t think of it until I saw Annelise’s ancestor Helen Regina in her family tree, and thought that was such a beautiful combo! Helen didn’t seem quite right for this family, though, nor Helena or Helene, but the variant Elena seems perfect! Then I realized that Elena has the same sound as the end of Maddalena, so maybe Elena could be a good compromise between A. and her husband! (They lose the St. Mary Magdalene connection, but they could make up for it with a variant of Mary somewhere: Maria Elena, Mary Elena, Elena Marie, etc.) If they like the idea of mirroring the full Helen Regina combo, Elena Regina and Elena Reine would both do nicely.\n\n(2) Natalia, Natalina, Noel(le)\n\nThis was originally inspired by the possible meaning of Eldo being “birth of Christ,” since the Natalie and Noel names literally refer to Christmas Day. Then I saw Natalia in the BNW as a style match for Mariana! Like Mariana, Natalia is very pan-European, having usage in lots of different countries and languages. I couldn’t help but notice that a specific Italian variant is Natalina, which nearly rhymes with Maddalena (depending how you say the “lena” part), but might provide enough differentiation from Mariana that Annelise’s husband would be okay with it? Then of course Noel and Noelle. They could certainly consider them for the first name spot, but I feel like they’d be a more natural fit for them in the middle spot.\n\n(3) Matilda\n\nAnnelise has an ancestor named Mary Matilda, which I loved right away! Matilda is also a style match for Louisa on her list! It’s a little clunkier than Mariana and Maddalena, but a beautiful name nonetheless with some sweet nickname options.\n\n(4) Stella(maris)\n\nEstella is a match for Louisa, which didn’t feel quite right to me for this family, but made me think Stella might be perfect. Then I found that Henry, Jack, and Charlie are all style matches for Stella! While I love the trimmer Stella, I wondered what they’d think of the fuller Stellamaris? It refers to Our Lady’s title Star of the Sea, and is also seen as Maristella, which I would have suggested in a heartbeat if it wasn’t so similar to Mariana! I also have a friend who named her daughter Stella Marissa as a nod to Our Lady, Stellamaris.\n\n(5) Saintly surname-type names\n\nBecause of the surname-y Delaney and Mackenzie on Annelise’s husband’s list, I wanted to try to think of names that might be similar, but with saintly significance and hopefully a “romantic, lyrical” feel. Avila came immediately to mind — it’s not technically a surname, but serves a similar role in St. Teresa of Avila’s name. Another is Salette, from Our Lady of La Salette — I did a consultation for a family considering Salette (dropping the “La”) and I thought it was brilliant and so pretty. Bessette is another, from St. Andre Bessette, and has the added feature of looking like a French diminutive of Elizabeth. Annelise and her hubby might also like to look through the girls’ names in this family — there’s a definite saintly surname feel in a few of them, like Vianney, Clairvaux, and Lourdes, and all of them done in an ultra-feminine way. (That link goes to the original post I did on them; here [this baby had some scary health issues at birth, in case any of you can’t handle reading that kind of stuff right now!], here, here are birth announcements for subsequent babies. Amazing namers!)\n\nBoy\n\n(1) Edmund\n\nAs soon as I saw Edmund in the list of names similar to Louisa I knew I had to include it on the list! It has that regal, traditional feel I think Annelise is looking for, with lots of nicknames options: Ed, Eddie, Ted, Teddy, Ned. St. Edmund Campion is great! Edmund Christopher is very handsome to me.\n\n(2) Arthur\n\nArthur is a style match for Louise, and again, once I saw it I was like yes! What is more regal and traditional (especially from an English perspective) than Arthur?? I thought they might particularly like a nickname I’ve been seeing for Arthur: Bear, because of Arthur’s possible and mostly accepted meaning of “bear.” (I love the nickname Bear so much that I tried to convince my husband of Benedict Gerard with the nickname Bear for our youngest!) There are several Blesseds with that name. I think this is a name that wouldn’t pair well with Christopher — do you all agree? Arthur Christopher has repeated ending sounds, but some people quite like that. If these parents like Arthur but not Christopher with it, maybe they would consider Arthur Grey? Or, I also really like Hale from Hubby’s family — Arthur Hale is handsome too!\n\n(3) Felix\n\nThis was originally inspired by Eldo’s possible meaning of “happy, joyful,” but then I was excited to see that it’s a match for Otto and Eliza (similar to Elisa). I’ve been seeing some little Felixes here and there, it’s a cool name!\n\n(4) Alexander\n\nI did a quick general search online for “regal” names for boys, just to see if anything jumped out, and Alexander was on the list, which reminded me that Alexandra was going to be Henry’s middle name if he’d been a girl, and I wondered if they’d be interested to switching it to a boy’s name? Alexander is saintly and papal and has some cool nickname options in addition to the familiar Alex like Xander, Zander, and Sander. Sandy is a traditional nickname that isn’t used much anymore, but my boys have a friend named Sandy whose given name is Alexander and I love hearing it.\n\n(5) Bates, Hart\n\nThese last two are taken from Annelise’s family tree, both names that I think are so cool and could work as either first or middle names. Bates is the first: I’ve always loved that Bates is a medieval diminutive of Bartholomew, giving it impeccable faith credentials in an unexpected way.\n\nThe other is Hart: I worked with a doctor a long time ago in a previous career whose son was named Hart — his wife’s maiden name. I loved that! A hart is a male deer (stag), and the “ard” part of names like Gerard and Bernard are actually the Old German element “hart” which means “brave, hardy,” both of which gives it a really masculine spin. I also love that it sounds like “heart,” which gives it an affectionate feel. There’s also this birth announcement I did for parents who named their son Gerhardt and call him Hart. Love, love, love!\n\nAnd those are all my ideas! What do you all think? What names would you suggest for the little sister or brother of Mariana and Henry?\n\nFor help with Marian names, my book, Catholic Baby Names for Girls and Boys: Over 250 Ways to Honor Our Lady (Marian Press, 2018), is available to order from ShopMercy.org and Amazon (not affiliate links). It’s perfect for expectant parents, name enthusiasts, and lovers of Our Lady!\n\nBaby name consultation: floral, literary, possibly Brit, probably not too Italian-y for baby girl’s name\n\nHappy feast of St. Anthony Mary Zaccaria! I hope my American readers had a good 4th of July! Please pray for America! 🗽🙏\n\nBe sure to note that as of July 2 (as I wrote in the post that day), I’m suspending consultations indefinitely due to various things going on in my life (all good!). I will continue to post consultations I’ve already done for those families who want them, and I have some birth announcements and other things to post this summer as well; I also always keep you all in my prayers! 🩷🩷🩷\n\nToday’s consultation is for Jessica and her husband, who are expecting their fourth baby — a girl! Little Miss joins big siblings:\n\nGianna Catherine (“Gianna is my confirmation saint [I converted in college] and also a patron of our family. I knew after learning her story that I would want to name a daughter after her, so once we found out that our first was a girl, that was that! My husband and I met through pro-life work during our college years, and after we married, I pursued a degree in Catholic Bioethics, and Gianna’s patronage covers the whole gamut of issues important to us [the department at the university where I earned my degree was officially christened The St. Gianna School of Health Sciences soon after I graduated]. The middle name Catherine was chosen both for how well it flows with Gianna and also because we wanted to honor St. Catherine of Sienna, another strong Catholic woman who served the Church in an entirely different way than St. Gianna. We mostly call her Gianna or some other non-name-related nicknames, but a lot of relatives call her Gigi or G [we do as well, but not as frequently]“).\n\nDominic Ivan (“To be perfectly honest, the main reason we chose Dominic was that it was one of the only boy names we both liked. I used to joke that we would struggle to name any future boys, but the joke is on me now because we’re having a girl and struggling anyways. But we both liked the name Dominic, and a bonus was the connection to St. Dominic and the Order of Preachers, whose charisms we appreciate. It also paired well with Gianna’s more Italian-style name, and is a fairly common name in Croatia, where my father’s family is from. Ivan is my husband’s grandfather’s name – once I suggested Ivan as a middle name, my husband really liked the idea and that also helped push Dominic to the top. We had been considering some other names like Thomas or Damien, but felt that Dominic Ivan flowed better than the alternative options. We also mostly use his full name, but occasionally shorten it to Dommy (Or Doodle, but I doubt he wants that nickname to follow him into adulthood] 😂”)\n\n+Stella Mercy (“We named our miscarried baby Stella Mercy. We lost her right around the start of Advent, so a star-related name seemed appropriate, and I have always loved the name Mercy. My husband didn’t like the idea of a unisex name [even though we lost her too early to know the sex] but I like to think that her name could also be Stella Clement if, in fact, she was a boy. The meaning would be the same“)\n\nAbsolutely fantastic names!! And two consultations for families with a little Dominic in one week!!😍\n\nJessica writes,\n\n“So this little rainbow baby will be our third here on earth, but our fourth to name. I have always been into baby names, and as a kid I used to read baby name books and make long lists of names – for book characters but also for future children. So now that I’m actually in the baby-naming phase of life, I feel a lot of pressure to pick the perfect names! We both prefer names with strong meaning, or family names. I am also very picky about the cadence of a name, and how well the whole name flows together, as well as just the first/last combo (since that’s what they’ll most often be called). Our last name is very short and choppy. Most single-syllable names are out because they don’t sound good, and any name that ends with D also doesn’t work (I like Marigold and Adelaide but they’re just too clunky with [last name].)\n\nMy husband and I have a decent amount of baby name style overlap, although I am definitely more accepting of unusual or less common names. I tend to throw out a bunch of name ideas and he whittles down our list by vetoing the ones he doesn’t like (like Aveline, Linnea, or Calliope). Our last name is very simple (and boring! – I say that with full agreement of my husband too 😅) so I wouldn’t mind going completely ‘out-there’ with names but my husband is skeptical of names he doesn’t hear super often.”\n\nSounds familiar! 😅\n\nNames they’re considering include:\n\nClara (“this was our top choice for a while but my husband says it’s not clicking as well as he thought it would; it’s a family name on my side and I also really love the connection to St. Clare [who was born Chiara, which is the Italian form of Clara]“)\n\nLydia (“this was our girl name pick when pregnant with Dominic. It’s still one of Hubs’ favorites but I’m not as sure about it anymore, but we love the biblical Lydia and her association with the early Church and hospitality“)\n\nMaisie (“we would use it as a nickname, probably with Mary Therese or Margaret as the full name. Hubs prefers it as a nn for Margaret, but his mom and my grandmother are both Mary, so it feels like it would be a missed opportunity to pick Maisie but not honor the multiple Marys in our lives“)\n\nJosephine (“my husband really likes the nickname Josie, I’m worried it’s too sing-songy with our last name. Also this is nitpicky, but my name is Jessica, and our older daughter is Gianna, so it feels like a lot of repletion of the J/G sounds in all the girls“)\n\nFelicity (“we both like the cadence of the name, and especially the nickname Lissie. The one hang-up we have [and we’re not sure if it’s even a real concern] is that some friends in the area just had a girl in April and named her Felicity. We have no issue with anyone in our circle using the same names as our kids, and we’ve said as much to friends who mentioned liking the names Gianna and Dominic, but I know that not everyone feels the same way about ‘stealing’ baby names and we want to bring it up casually with these friends and see if it would be something that bothered them before we lock anything in“)\n\nAdditional names that Jessica likes but her hubby doesn’t:\n\nAdeline\n\nEmilia\n\nRosalie\n\nViolet\n\nElowen\n\nNames already used in their family (basically a “no” list) include:\n\nJulia\n\nMikayla\n\nEmma\n\nAnna\n\nEllie\n\nCharlotte\n\nAllison\n\nLilly\n\nEmily\n\nElaine\n\nEvelyn (nn. Evie with a long E)\n\nSome final considerations:\n\n“Gianna and Dominic both have saint names (and vaguely Italian names) but we didn’t necessarily intend that as a requirement – so I’m a little worried that we might lock ourselves into a theme if this baby also has a saint name (or a name that’s too Italian sounding I guess). My favorite boy name for the future is Tristan, which is not a saint name, so it’s on my mind, and names like Clara, Lydia, and Maisie seem like a good happy medium – biblical or saint associations without being overtly a saint name. We could easily name future children after saints or not, without anyone ending up being the odd one out.\n\nBaby girl is due in early November, so if there are any late Oct/early Nov feast days that might be relevant, that would be interesting to know! Also we are both very into theology and literature – my husband is a huge LOTR fan (although he still won’t sign off on the name Eowyn 😅). One of the reasons I felt drawn to Maisie early on was the connection to Maisie Ward, a Catholic theologian and writer connected to the Oxford movement in England. I mentioned that my ancestry is mostly Croatian and Italian, but my husband’s ancestry is German and Ukrainian, so we’re open to names more from that region. Also my husband is a big anglophile and probably wishes he lived in England, so we love a good British name too! I know that’s all over the place, but maybe it can help with some inspiration!“\n\nI absolutely love Jessica’s older kiddos’ names! Gianna Catherine, Dominic Ivan, and Stella Mercy (/Clement) are all so beautiful, meaningful, and full of faith significance! I loved reading all the background behind each one.\n\nI laughed over Jessica’s characterization of their family’s surname as “boring” and I tend to fall in the same mindset she has of balancing that kind of thing out by “going completely ‘out there’ with names,” but I also really like how she articulated her husband’s reservations: “skeptical of names he doesn’t hear super often.” That’s one of the best explanations I’ve heard for why so many husbands (in my experience) are reluctant to consider certain names, and also why so many seem stuck on names that their wives describe as being “names of girls they went to high school with.”\n\nI love their list of ideas, and I’ll start by offering my thoughts on each one, in case they’re helpful:\n\nClara: This is a great and less-expected way to nod to St. Clare, a beautiful name! I get, though, that sometimes a name that has been a top contender for a while might start to feel … stale? To one or both parents?\n\nLydia: It sounds like what’s happening with Clara for Jessica’s husband is what’s happening with Lydia for Jessica! It’s a great name, and I loved her explanation of what they love about the name including “her association with the early Church and hospitality.” I’ve also always loved that purple would be a Lydia’s own personal color!\n\nMaisie, Josephine: Okay, I’m putting these two together because I think there might be a solution here that would involve both of these names! Jessica mentioned that her love of Maisie began in part with Maisie Ward; also that her mother-in-law and her grandmother are both Mary; also that Josie LastName sounds too sing-songy to her; also that having another girl’s name start with the J sound seems overmuch. I know Jessica’s husband prefers this as a nickname for Margaret, which I get, since in origin it is a diminutive of Margaret, but I wonder if he — and Jessica — would be open to Mary Josephine nicknamed Maisie, especially when they find out that Maisie Ward’s given name was Mary Josephine?? It seems to bring together/solve all the things Jessica listed! (Except for the Margaret thing, which I am sorry for, but it would allow Jessica’s husband to call their daughter Josie if he wants! Moms and Dads sometimes have different nicknames they use for their kids.)\n\nFelicity: Oh man, I love Felicity for this family! But I also get Jessica’s reservations about using it without making sure that it’s okay with the other family they know! If their friends give their blessing, I really do love Felicity as Gianna’s and Dominic’s sister. If their friends aren’t okay with them using it, I wouldn’t think it’s totally off the table — maybe just shelved for now. You never know what the future brings — that family might move away, or Jessica and her family might, or a few years’ difference in ages between two Felicitys might diffuse any issue.\n\nI’m glad Jessica included the list of names she likes but her husband doesn’t — I was interested by the number of flower names (Marigold, Linnea, Rosalie, Violet) and tried to keep that in mind while working on this. I also love that Jessica’s favorite boy name is Tristan — funny enough, it’s a style match for Dominic according to the Baby Name Wizard book! (affiliate link) And though it’s not a Saint’s name, I did include Tristan in my book of Marian names (not an affiliate link!). This is what I wrote:\n\n“Though Tristan seems to have originated as a variant of the name Drustan, which is unrelated to Our Lady in any way, the Latin word tristis (“sad”) played a role in its evolution from Drustan to Tristan due to the old and well-known tragic story of Tristan and Isolde. Its sad connotations give the name a great connection to Our Lady of Sorrows.” (230)\n\nAlso, I’ve heard before from readers that they don’t want to saddle their children with names that have a tragic connection (whether Our Lady of Sorrows or even the martyrs! [That one surprised me!]), but Theresa wrote a beautiful piece on her choice of Our Lady of Sorrows as her daughter’s patron, in which she wrote:\n\n“This, I think, perfectly illustrates who Our Lady of Sorrows is and a Catholic view of sorrow. It is hope, instead of despair, in the face of tragedy. It is fortitude in the face of upset and chaos. It is trust in the midst of darkness. And it is gratitude in the midst of hardship.”\n\nI love that! So I absolutely love Tristan as a possibility for a future son. I also like Jessica’s thought that Tristan “and names like Clara, Lydia, and Maisie seem like a good happy medium — biblical or saint associations without being overtly a saint name. We could easily name future children after saints or not, without anyone ending up being the odd one out.” In fact, I might suggest characterizing their children’s name style (including Gianna and Dominic) as simply “Catholic,” which removes all pressure to use only Saints’ name and opens up so many other things that can all go together under the style umbrella of “Catholic.”\n\nOkay! On to new ideas! I did my usual research in the Baby Name Wizard, as it lists, for each entry, boy and girl names that are similar in terms of style/feel/popularity — I looked up the names Jessica and her husband have already used and those they like. I loved the extra info about her and her husband’s shared interests in theology and literature (me and mine too!), including LOTR (it was an inspiration behind my first suggestion below!) (also, that’s an affiliate link, and the boxed set, including The Hobbit, is only $20 today!), and her husband’s Anglophilia. There are posts here on the blog that address each of those things that I used in my research, and I want to be sure to list them here in case any of you would like to look through them, too:\n\nBirth announcement for a baby whose mom introduced me to Maisie Ward and who has a similar aesthetic to this family\n\nProfile of a family who names with a literary + Catholic sensibility — they’ve already used fantastic names, and there are some additional ideas, too (an update to a post I’d done on them several years earlier, which is referred to in the posts below)\n\nSeveral posts I’ve done on Catholic literary names: here, here, here.\n\nConsultation for a family living in England, the parents of whom are converts and whose dad is a former Anglican Clergyman-turned-Catholic-priest. They had a “preference for three-syllable Old-World catacomb-y names” that would also fit in in England — Dominic was on their list! Woo! There’s also this birth announcement I did for them a couple years later for their next baby, which includes the name they chose for the baby the consultation had been for.\n\nThe mom of a mama I did a consultation for did a post fifteen years ago on the very unusual names her kids have, inspired by Tolkien and Lewis.\n\nBased on all that, here are my new suggestions for Jessica and her hubby:\n\n(1) Elanor\n\nWhen reading Jessica’s email, I immediately knew I wanted to include Elanor in my suggestions for her! I was initially inspired by Elowen, as Elanor is also a LOTR name, but a more accessible one. Seeing all the flower names that she likes inspired me, too, as in LOTR, not only is Elanor the name of Sam and Rosie’s baby girl, but it’s also the name of a little flower. The fact that it means “sun star” in Sindarin could make it perfect as a little connection to the baby that came before, their Stella, but that’s only if they like that connection — otherwise they can ignore that. I will admit I’m a little hesitant because of Ellie and Elaine on the list of cousins, but it’s so perfect otherwise (in my opinion — they may disagree!) that a way they can work around that is by using Nora as a nickname, which is a common and traditional nickname for Eleanor and has usage in Italian, German, and Ukrainian, making it a nice nod to both Jessica’s and her husband’s heritages, or another more unexpected idea like Lore (a German contracted form of Eleanor) or something made up like Linny or Nori.\n\n(2) Eloise\n\nWhile Elanor is my favorite El- suggestion for this family, and one that I offer even knowing that Ellie and Elaine might make it problematic, I can’t not include Eloise on this list for the sole reason that it was a huge style match for them according to the BNW! It’s a match for Adelaide, Adeline, Rosalie, and Violet! Similar to Elanor, they’d need to find a non-El- nickname — Lola and Lulu could work. Also, as far as I know, there’s no Saint named Eloise (though there is a Bl. Helwisa, also known as Eloisa and Heloise), and the strongest connection to the faith that I know of is the story of theologian Peter Abelard and his wife Heloise (Eloise is a variant of Heloise) — I don’t know how well known that story is among Catholics or the general population, but I read it years ago and it’s still a dominant thought for me regarding Eloise.\n\n(3) Zelie\n\nSt. Gianna is linked with St. Zelie in my mind as two women who served the world and their families through work, and Zelie is distinctly not Italian, so it’s a nice addition to this family’s names from that perspective. An additional inspiration is that many, many people consider Azelie (St. Zelie’s given name) to be French for “azalea” (I just have to add that I’ve never been able to confirm that — according to Google translate, azalée is the French for azalea, but if you do a general search for “is azelie French for azalea” you’ll find lots of sites that say so), which could be a nod to Jessica’s love of floral names.\n\n(4) Cora(lie)\n\nCora is a match for Stella and Clara, and since Clara isn’t feeling quite right to Jessica’s hubby but Cora’s so similar, maybe Cora would feel like a fresh take? I’ve known many families to choose it because of cor meaning “heart” in Latin — they use it for the Immaculate Heart of Mary and/or the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which is so lovely. Then I saw Coralie as a match for Rosalie, and thought that might be even better! With Jessica’s hope of moving away from Italian-feeling names, Coralie feels closer to that goal than Cora does.\n\n(5) Phoebe\n\nThis is another name I wouldn’t have thought of for this family, but it’s a match for both Lydia and Maisie and has an early-Christian biblical association like Lydia. I just heard from a mom who I’d done a consultation for that they’d named their baby girl Phoebe and are calling her Bee, which is so darling!\n\n(6) Beatrice, Beatrix\n\nSpeaking of Bee, I wonder what they would think of Beatrice or Beatrix? Beatrice is a match for Violet and Josephine, and it’s literary and saintly; I also included Beatrix in my book of Marian names for this reason:\n\n“As the word Beatrix in Latin means ‘she who blesses, makes happy, delights,’ the name Beatrix can easily refer to Our Lady, who blesses us all and is the Cause of Our Joy (Causa Nostrae Laetitiae)!” (42)\n\nBeatrix has the added fun element of being the name of Beatrix Potter — British + literary! I love Bea or Bee as a nickname, and Trix and Trixie are cute, too.\n\n(7) Natalia\n\nNatalia is a match for both Dominic and Tristan, so while I wouldn’t normally have included it, since it seems to lean into the Italian-ish feel rather than out of it, the fact that it’s a match for Jessica’s two favorite boy names — who themselves might normally feel mismatched as brothers (though I and the BNW don’t agree with that) — seems a big deal! It or its variants also have usage in other languages, including Croatian, German, Italian, and Ukrainian, making it a real pan-European name (I always love pan-European names!), and they could have fun looking into the diminutives for it in those languages for nickname possibilities. Natascha is a German diminutive and Natalka is Ukrainian, for example. Its nickname Talia has separate origins as a Hebrew name, and Lia sounds like the biblical Leah, both of which tip it a little closer to Lydia. Tilly could work, which has a “Lissie” feel. Some nice options!\n\n(8) Avila\n\nMy last idea is inspired by Aveline on the list of names Jessica likes but her hubby doesn’t. Aveline is, in origin, a diminutive of Avila, and Avila is all “St. Teresa of Avila” to Catholics, but isn’t her actual name, so I thought it might be perfect! Avila as a name derives from Old German, which is a nice nod to Jessica’s husband’s heritage; Avila the city has a different etymology and is considered Spanish today (being a city in Spain).\n\nThose are all my “official” suggestions, but there were a few others that I wanted to include in this final note, just in case. One was Willa — it’s one of the names that the “literary + Catholic namer” I linked to above used for her daughter, after Willa Cather, who wasn’t Catholic but whose fiction is considered consistent with a Catholic outlook. I’d done a spotlight post on the name a while ago in which I took some liberties in assigning it a connection to “willow” — that botanical connection and Jessica’s love of floral names made me think she might like to consider it! They could consider Willow itself, of course, but that didn’t seem to be their style as much as Willa.\n\nAnother name I saw in the literary posts was Philippa, which feels SO British to me! She’s the main character in Rumer Godden’s In This House of Brede (affiliate link), about a cloister of Benedictine nuns, and the nickname Pippa is to die for. I could see the connection to the royal family being a big selling point to Jessica’s husband … but also a negative? I wanted to mention it anyway. It also feels like Lydia to me because of the apostle Philip and the Letter to the Philippians.\n\nI also quickly went through the list of feast days and memorials from October 21 to November 10 at CatholicSaints.info, which is my favorite source for all that stuff. These were the ones that jumped out at me:\n\nOct. 22: John Paul II — names in his honor include Caroline, Karoline, Karolina, Charlotte\n\nOct. 24: Anthony Mary Claret — I like that “Claret” could connect to Clara\n\nOct. 27: Martyrs of Avila (some)\n\nOct. 28: Martyrs of Avila (others)\n\nOct. 29: Chiara Badano (another nice connection for Clara)\n\nNov. 2: Margaret of Lorraine\n\nNov. 4: Charles Borromeo\n\nNov. 5: Beatrice of Swabia\n\nNov. 6: Beatrice of Olive\n\nNov. 7: Eleanor of Portugal\n\nAnd those are all my ideas! What do you all think? What name(s) would you suggest for the little sister of Gianna, Dominic, and +Stella?\n\nFor help with Marian names, my book, Catholic Baby Names for Girls and Boys: Over 250 Ways to Honor Our Lady (Marian Press, 2018), is available to order from ShopMercy.org and Amazon (not affiliate links). It’s perfect for expectant parents, name enthusiasts, and lovers of Our Lady!\n\nBaby name consultation: Second baby girl needs a pretty, Italian-ish name\n\nHappy Tuesday of the week of July 4th! Happy feast of lots of titles of Our Lady: Our Lady of the Garden, Our Lady of Madhu, Our Lady of Montallegro, Our Lady of the Grove, Our Lady of the Leśniów Spring, Our Lady of the Visitation, Our Lady of the Way of Leon, and Our Lady of Vaussivieres!\n\nUnfortunately, as of today, I’ll be suspending baby name consultations indefinitely, as I will have a very busy fall and probably the entire upcoming school year (some new professional things, and sending my second son off to college! My mama’s heart and mind can only take so much! I started Sancta Nomina three months after my sixth was born; my oldest was 9. Now my oldest is going to be a college junior, and my next boy a college freshman, and my baby [boy no. 7] will be in first grade, and I can’t even believe how big all my boys are!). If you’ve already sent me a request, no worries — I will honor all of those I received as of midnight last night. If I’m able to resume consultations in the future, I will let you know here on the blog! In the meantime, the Catholic Baby Naming Discussion Facebook group is a great option — it’s got lots of members and is very active, with several posts a day by mamas looking for name help and lots of people eager to offer their ideas/thoughts/suggestions. Thank you to all of you who have invited me into your baby name conversations! I have thoroughly enjoyed hearing about your families and helping you find names for your little ones that connect to our faith.\n\nI also want to note that I celebrated my tenth blogiversary last week! Wow!! What a fun decade it’s been!! If you’d like to read my first post ever, click here.\n\nI won’t be gone from the blog altogether, but do note (as many of you have discovered!) that my ability to read and reply to emails in a timely manner is getting less and less. I do apologize to anyone who’s left waiting longer than you’d like!\n\nToday’s baby name consultation is for Kate from Kate Scimeca Art (such beautiful, faithy art prints!) and her husband as they prepare to welcome their fourth born baby — their second girl! This little lady joins older siblings:\n\nDominic Andrew\n\nLucia Marie\n\nVincent James\n\n+Francis Joseph (in heaven)\n\nSuch attractive, saintly names! Kate writes,\n\n“So far, we chose saint names that seem to suit our Sicilian last name pronounced SKIM-uh-ka. We like the Italian-ish sound to the names, and we like the kids to have an easy patron saint to turn to. To us, the boy names need to feel strong and the girl names need to feel pretty. 🙂\n\nWe chose Dominic very quickly and easily right after the 20 week ultrasound when we found out he was a boy; no special devotion from us – just loved the strong sound of the name! Andrew is my husband’s middle name and my grandpa’s middle name. For Lucia, that was our top girl name had Dominic been a girl and we still both loved it two years later so we named her that right away after the 20 week ultrasound again. 🙂 We like to connect it to Saint Lucy and Sister Lucia from Fatima. Marie is my middle name, my mom’s middle name, and my grandma’s middle name. Vincent was harder for us to name. We couldn’t agree until after he was born. My husband wanted Anthony, but I don’t like the nickname ‘Tony’. I really wanted Solanus (with the nickname ‘Sully’) after Blessed Solanus Casey, but that name was a little too ‘out there’ for my husband. Vincent was both of our second choices, and of course we have no regrets since we see now how it suits our son perfectly. His middle name James is his other grandfather’s first name. I think we tend to like names that are classic but not boring – generally not too unique that they’d cause difficulties in life but not so common that they feel dull to us – and again, a natural connection to a saint. And we like middle names to have some kind of family connection. We do call Lucia ‘Lulu’ a lot and Vincent ‘Vinny’ sometimes but we never call Dominic by a nickname.”\n\nThe names they’re considering for their baby girl include:\n\nAvila Clare (“I wanted to name Vincent this if he was a girl. It just sounds so pretty to me! We have no connection to the middle name Clare, though, and I worry that Avila might be too unusual? Though hopefully not as ‘out there’ as my love of the name Solanus!“)\n\nGianna (“My husband’s pick. I just don’t love Gianna for some reason. I really don’t think I’ll change my mind.”)\n\nGemma (“I love this one! I much prefer it to Gianna. My husband feels the same way about this one as I feel about Gianna – just doesn’t click for him but I think he can be convinced, hah. Saint Gemma’s birthday is our wedding anniversary.”)\n\nCamilla (“We both like this one – it’s very pretty. I feel like we wouldn’t use a nickname. I’m not sure about Catholic saints with this name though.”)\n\nJuliet (“This one came to us out of the blue. We both like it and favor the nickname ‘Jules’ but aren’t certain about Catholic connections with this one either!“)\n\nStella (“We both like it but aren’t sure since our last name also starts with S.”)\n\nMiddle name ideas include:\n\nAnne (“It is a tradition in my family to give as a middle name to the second daughter, like my sister and aunt both have this as a middle name.”)\n\nMarguerite (“Marguerite is my mom’s first name and my husband has a grandmother Margaret. This one is my preference and I think my husband’s as well. We are up for bucking the Anne family tradition because we think this name is so pretty. To us, Anne just doesn’t sound as good with our first name preferences but ‘Camilla Marguerite’ as an example sounds so lovely to us.”)\n\n“I guess we’d never use Mary/Maria since we used Marie as a middle name. I also don’t love Catherine/Elizabeth/Caroline because they feel too common even though they’re very beautiful.”\n\nIt goes without saying that I LOVE their older children’s names! Dominic, Lucia, Vincent and +Francis Joseph are so attractive and full of faith significance, I love them! I also love that they fit in nicely with this family’s Sicilian heritage and surname, while also being able to connect to other cultures: e.g., the Spanish St. Dominic and the Portuguese Sr. Lucia. These parents have done a great job!\n\nAs for the names they’re considering for this baby, I thought I’d offer my thoughts on them in case they’re helpful:\n\nAvila Clare: What a beautiful combo! I think it’s a really nice fit for this family in that it’s a Spanish place name, which is one of the reasons I mentioned the pan-European nature of their older kiddos’ names — it’s great to choose names that can fit together even when coming from different countries/cultures/languages. The fact that Avila ends with an -a can give it a vague Italian-ish feel, too. I feel like Lucia Marie and Avila Clare are really well matched as sister names! I don’t think Avila is too “out there” at all — I see it with some regularity in the families I work with (here’s a birth announcement for an Avila Rose!), both on already-born daughters and on lists of names for consideration. I think it’s so lovely! And the possible nickname Ava really makes it very familiar if they decided they wanted to do that. I also don’t think it’s a problem at all to not currently have a connection to the name Clare — I really do think that sometimes Saints find us through our taste in names! This family could absolutely cultivate a devotion to St. Clare of Assisi, and it’s extra nice for them that she’s an Italian Saint!\n\nGianna: It’s so interesting that Kate doesn’t love this name — it does seem like the kind of name she would choose! But I’ve had that same feeling many times, when a name seems like it would be perfect for our family but I just can’t get there.\n\nGemma: I’ve also had the experience where I liked a name and was sure I could bring my husband around, haha! I also LOVE that St. Gemma’s feast day is their anniversary!! That’s amazing!! It’s also really cool that in the Baby Name Wizard book (affiliate link), which lists style matches for each entry, the matches for Gemma are mostly British-y feeling, so even though she’s obviously a legit Italian Saint, they would also introduce a different European feel into their family, which can open more possibilities going forward (if they’re so blessed). My preference is always to try to help parents find a name that they both equally love (or at least both equally accept), and I never want to interfere in baby name conversations between parents — only help — but between you and me 😊 , I really like this option for this family!\n\nCamilla: This is a really pretty name, too! Though Kate said they likely wouldn’t use a nickname, it is pretty cool that both Cammie and Milla/Millie could work, which are nice options. But the full Camilla is lovely too! I also love that Kate and her hubby both like it! As for Catholic Saints, there are two Saints and a Blessed; St. Camilla Battista Varano was a Poor Clare, which immediately makes me think Camilla Clare would be lovely!\n\nJuliet: Oh man, Juliet is one of my very, very favorites — I love seeing it on their list!! Like Gemma, it has a somewhat Brit feel, but of course the original Juliet was Italian, so it works nicely for this family! I did a spotlight post on Juliet here, which provides some good faith connections! (Don’t mind me saying in it that Jules isn’t my favorite nickname — if Kate and her hubby love it, I’m thrilled!!)\n\nStella: This is another great option for this family, and since I’m a fan of alliteration, I don’t mind Stella Scimeca at all! Maristella is a longer option that gets away from the S-S at least formally, though if their daughter always goes by Stella as a nickname/everyday call name, then a non-S formal name doesn’t really help with that. I wouldn’t cross it off their list if it was up to me, but they’ll have to decide how they feel!\n\nAnne: Ooh, I am a big fan of family traditions, but I’ve also been in the spot to not like how a particular name works as a middle name for a first name we like. I wonder if Kate and her husband would consider a compromise of sorts by using a different Anne name? There are so many variants and related names like Annabel(le), Annika, Hannah/Anna, Annette, Anita, Nancy, and so many others. Using one of those could be a cool way to freshen up the family tradition and balance their chosen first name better?\n\nMarguerite: It’s hard for me to argue against Kate’s mom’s name, especially when it can also nod to her hubby’s grandma and it’s also the name they both prefer! I wonder if they would consider a double middle name? Marguerite Anne or Anne Marguerite? Those combos are giving me gorgeous French princess vibes — it makes me want to add a hyphen in the manner of French royalty or French Saints! Marguerite-Anne and Anne-Marguerite are beautiful!\n\nMary/Maria: Though Kate said they wouldn’t use these because they already used Marie, I do just want to throw out there that it’s a very traditional Catholic practice to give each daughter in a family a variant of Mary as part of their name, so if they want to include a Marian name, there’s no reason not to! If they don’t want to, that’s totally fine too!\n\nCatherine/Elizabeth/Caroline: Just a thought — I wonder if Kate would like these better if she considered the Italian or Spanish versions? Caterina, for example, is gorgeous, and can nod to St. Catherine of Siena and Kate herself as well! Elisa, Elisabetta, and Isabella are all beautiful, and Karolina is one of my favorite ways to honor St. John Paul II (since his birth name was Karol).\n\nOkay! On to new ideas! As I mentioned, I did my usual research in the Baby Name Wizard, looking for names that are similar to the style they’ve shown that they like (through the names they’ve already chosen and those they’re considering). I also really leaned into their preference for pretty girl names! Based on all that, these are my ideas:\n\n(1) Chiara\n\nThis is a little bit of a cheat idea since they already have Clare on their list as a middle name possibility, but Chiara is the Italian version and has gotten some attention in recent years among the families I work with in large part because of Bl. Chiara Luce Badano and Servant of God Chiara Corbella Petrillo — two wonderful models of the faith and certainly both named after St. Clare of Assisi, who would have been known as Chiara. This is a style match for both Gianna and Gemma, so maybe it’s a nice compromise for Kate and her husband?\n\n(2) Emilia\n\nEmilia is a style match for Lucia — it’s always meaningful to me to find style matches for the older children’s names as opposed to the names on the parents’ list! My favorite thing about Emilia is that it’s the name of St. John Paul’s mom, whose cause for canonization is open; for this family, I also like that it has pan-European usage, which fits in so nicely with their other kids.\n\n(3) Siena\n\nI’d already had Siena on my list for this family because of Avila, since it’s also a saintly place name and an Italian one at that (most familiar because of St. Catherine of Siena [Dominican], but there’s also St. Bernardine of Siena, who was Franciscan and is known as *the* promoter of the Holy Name of Jesus). But another fun thing is that I know a family who purposely leaned into their Italian heritage when naming their two daughters — they named them Emilia and Siena!\n\n(4) Natalia\n\nNatalia is a style match for Dominic and it’s long been one of my favorite names! Though Kate’s having a July baby, I love that Natalia’s meaning is literally “Christmas” — “the birth of Jesus.” So beautiful!\n\n(5) Rosa(lia)\n\nWhen I saw Rosa listed as a style match for Lucia, I immediately knew I wanted to include it in my list of suggestions! It also made me think of the longer Rosalia, which is a particularly Italian long form. The Rose names are always so lovely, and I love that they are Marian, too.\n\n(6) Seraphina\n\nSeraphina wasn’t listed as a style match for any of the names I looked up for this family, but I saw it as I was flipping through my BNW and I was like yes! Seraphina! I think it’s one of the prettiest girl names, and since that’s one of Kate’s criteria, I definitely wanted to include it! It refers to the angels (specifically the seraphim), and as such I think it can nod to Our Lady’s title Queen of the Angels, though there are also a few other holy women with this name. An Italian spelling is Serafina, which is also really pretty.\n\n(7) Philomena\n\nI wanted to see what names are style matches for Seraphina to be sure I wasn’t totally off the mark by suggesting it, and saw Philomena listed as one of them, which, again, made me go yes! Philomena is one of those obviously Catholic names, which is a characteristic I love, and speaking of love — its meaning is “to be loved,” which is so special! Like with Seraphina/Serafina, an Italian spelling is Filomena.\n\n(8) Zita\n\nEven though Seraphina and Philomena can hold their own length-wise with Dominic and Vincent, it didn’t escape my notice that Lucia and the girl names on their list are shorter. Zita is one of the shortest, and specifically Italian! There’s the St. Zita most people know about, but many of the families I work with have been loving Servant of God Empress Zita. I do too!\n\n(9) Caeli\n\nThis is a Latin name I see from time to time in the families I work with (this family has a Caeli Rose, gorgeous!), and I love it! It means “of heaven” (like in Regina Caeli = Queen of Heaven) and in Church Latin is said CHAY-lee.\n\n(10) Felicity\n\nI know I’ve already given more ideas that they bargained for, but just one last one: Felicity is a style match for Gemma and Juliet (a little bit more of that “Brit” feel), such a beautiful name.\n\nAnd those are all my ideas! What do you all think? What name(s) would you suggest for the little sister of Dominic, Lucia, and Vincent?\n\nFor help with Marian names, my book, Catholic Baby Names for Girls and Boys: Over 250 Ways to Honor Our Lady (Marian Press, 2018), is available to order from ShopMercy.org and Amazon (not affiliate links).

Stanley Rother inspo for baby no. 6\n\nHappy belated Mother’s Day to all the mamas! I went on retreat last weekend at Our Lady of Martyrs Shrine, also known as the Shrine of the North American Martyrs, and remembered all of you — the Sancta Nomina community — in my prayers. ❤️💐\n\nAs you all likely know, every year, right before Mother’s Day, the Social Security Administration releases the name stats from the previous year. Such fun for name lovers! The first thing people look at is the Top Ten for both girls and boys, and interestingly, there were no new additions or subtractions from the girl list (one moved up, two moved down, all others remained unchanged), while there was one addition to the boy list (Mateo) and one subtraction (Benjamin). For more — lots more! — be sure to check out Abby’s posts over at Appellation Mountain!\n\nToday’s consultation is for a couple expecting their sixth baby! While they’re Team Green, they have a girl name picked, so they need help with a boy’s name, since, if this baby is a boy, it will be their fifth boy in a row! This little one joins big sibs:\n\nEleanor Eileen (“Eileen was [mama] Miranda’s paternal grandmother’s name, and we liked the way that Eleanor sounded with it … [Miranda] was a new convert to Catholicism and had little relationship to the saints at the time, so a patron saint didn’t even occur to me. We retroactively made St. Helen her patron – I know now that the Eleanor/Eileen connection to Helen is debatable, but she formed a close relationship with St. Helen before I learned that, so it stuck. 🙂 I also had already fallen in love with the name before I knew that Eleanor & Eileen were technically the same name, but she truly has been a ‘light light’ in our lives and in our family.”)\n\nMackie John (“Mackie was Miranda’s paternal grandfather’s nickname, he passed away while we were in an ultrasound. His given name was Morgan Matthew, but he only ever went by Mackie. John is the name of a beloved uncle on Miranda’s mom’s side, and St. John the Evangelist is his patron.”)\n\nSamuel Luke (“Miranda was studying Samuel for her master’s degree in theology while pregnant and fell in love with his response to God’s calling. Luke was my maternal grandfather’s middle name. He and I were very close when I was younger. St. Luke the Evangelist is his patron.”)\n\nMarc Paul Raphael (Marc Paul is a double first name; “Marc is Miranda’s dad’s name and he spells it with a “c,” but St. Mark the Evangelist is his name patron. Paul references a few people: Miranda lost her other grandfather during this pregnancy, whose brother was Paul. Fr. Paul is a priest who was assigned to the parish in which Miranda & her family joined the church. He remained our pastor for almost the next 10 years- marrying us, baptizing our first three children, and loving on our family in a beautiful and influential way. Raphael was to honor St. Raphael: Samuel woke up one day paralyzed from the waist down in March of 2020 (right before lockdown). The doctors were struggling to diagnose him but settled on Guillain Barre, which could have potentially killed him. Miranda and I prayed to St. Raphael for healing and guidance and after two days in the hospital Sam woke up asking to go for a walk around the hospital. His reflexes returned to normal! The doctors changed his diagnosis to acute cerebellum ataxia which is a swelling of the brain stem that can cause leg paralysis but does not necessarily cause permanent damage. Thankfully Sam was back to normal in a few weeks.”)\n\nRocco Matthew (“We fell in love with St. Rocco during the pandemic. We had no idea that we would need his intercession so badly (more on that below). Matthew served several purposes: it rounded out our four gospel writers as patrons, it honored Miranda’s Uncle Matt who passed in 2019, and finally, honored Miranda’s cousin who passed away 2 days before Rocco’s birth. She was already hospitalized due to complications when she received the news of his illness and quick passing.”)\n\nI really loved reading through the explanations Bryan and Miranda gave of each of their children’s names! I think their choice of St. Helen for their Eleanor Eileen’s patron is perfect and fitting, and I love how they said she’s been a “light light” in their lives and family, how lovely! Eleanor Eileen really is a stunning combo. As for Eleanor and Eileen technically being the same name, I kind of love that they didn’t know that until after they named their daughter, because I love saying the combo out loud! Also, people name their babies things like Anna Grace and Jacob James all the time with no issue because most people just don’t know, so it’s really fine! (I know people with both of these combos: Anna means “grace,” and Jacob and James are two variants of the same name.) Mackie is such a cool name — I love the connection to Miranda’s grandfather! I just finished a consultation for another family to whom I suggested Samuel for the same reason this couple loves it, it is a great name and a great story! Marc and Paul have great connections, and that Raphael story about Samuel, wow!! And Rocco’s story — you’ll be as amazed as I was when you read it below! (Be warned that his story involves potentially difficult medical information for sensitive readers.)\n\nMiranda writes,\n\n“I tend to use the names of loved ones, so I am not really sure that we have a ‘style,’ per se. My dad’s side of the family is Cajun and full of beautiful, unique names that Bryan isn’t always so keen on. 🙂 My cousin mentioned above was named after my great-grandfather, Sampre’ (pronounced like ‘sam-pray’). Sampre’ and my great-grandmother, Philomene … had 11 kids and my dad is one of 7, so there is no shortage of Cajun names to pull from.\n\nWe also, obviously love to honor saints with whom we have formed relationships. This time, we would love to honor Blessed Stanley Rother. Rocco was born at 32 weeks. He was healthy, but after one week, he developed a disease called Nectrotizing Enterocolitis. He was rushed to emergency surgery the following day, but we were told the unimaginable: to prepare to say goodbye. They predicted we may have 24-48 hours left with him. The infection had killed most of his large intestine, which was then removed, but his small intestine & stomach were still infected (The surgeon had never seen NEC affect a stomach and did not think it was survivable). We laid our prayers at the feet of St. Rocco, patron of infectious diseases, and St. Matthew, the patron of our tiny baby. We begged Blessed Stanley for a miracle. We baptized our baby at one week and one day in his NICU room. The kind priest reminded us to have hope, but it was so hard after hearing the opinions of the different doctors. However, our God is loving and merciful, and we received our miracle! Rocco is alive and thriving! He no longer even has a colostomy bag. He is a miracle through and through and continues to astound us and his medical team.”\n\nWow, wow, wow!\n\n“If we have a daughter, we are considering either Dorothy Francis or Dorothy Ann Francis. Dorothy was my maternal grandmother’s name, and Francis is Blessed Stanley’s middle name. I like the double name Dorothy Ann & the nickname Dottie Ann, because what Southern woman doesn’t love a double name? 🙂\n\nFor a son, however, we are not as sure. Stanley has the added benefit of being my father-in-law’s middle name. I am drawn to Sebastian. He is certainly a powerful saint! I like Sebastian Stanley, but then, he would be the only of our boys to not have a biblical name. Perhaps a double name: Sebastian James Stanley, but that may be clunky. James is a family name, and I don’t love Stanley as a first name simply due to the popularity of the cup.”\n\nOkay, so I have to interject here and tell you this hilarious thing: when Miranda mentioned “the cup,” I immediately assumed she meant the hockey trophy! My husband and I had considered Stanley for our youngest, so I wrote to them, “Funny enough, the Stanley Cup wasn’t once mentioned in our conversations — is it really that much of an association for you and your family/friends/community?” DEAR READERS. I realized only just now this moment, putting together this post, almost two weeks after sending them my thoughts/ideas/suggestions, that they meant the popular drinking cup! 🤣🤦‍♀️\n\nBack to this lovely couple! Some names they like and are considering include:\n\nSebastian\n\nStanley\n\nFrancis\n\nJames\n\nSampre’\n\nJude\n\nRaymond (family name)\n\nDominic\n\nDamien\n\nPeter\n\nBenedict\n\nNames they can’t use because of nephews:\n\nChristopher\n\nJonathan\n\nRoss\n\nAnthony\n\nAlrighty! First off, I loved reading about Miranda’s Cajun heritage! I’d never heard Sampre’ before, so I did a little digging and it seems to be related to St. Peter (I found a surname Sampere that is connected to San Pere) — if that is, indeed, the connection, Peter on their list could be an honor name for the Sampre’s in their lives. Also, as much as I love an unusual/unexpected name, especially with family connections, especially with faith connections (if the Peter connection is true), I would hesitate over Sampre’ because of their Samuel — having the same first three letters for two different sons would be kind of weird, no? Maybe they’d both be okay with it in the middle spot? If so, I wonder if they would consider it to fulfill their desire for a biblical name, since it seems to be related to Peter?\n\nI love both Dorothy Francis and Dorothy Ann Francis, and Dottie Ann is adorable! I love a double name, too, and have always loved how well Southerners do them!\n\nRegarding the other names on their list:\n\nSebastian: Sebastian is a great name, and his story tends to be one that boys love (at least my boys!) — the arrows sticking in him in his images are always a (boy) crowd pleaser! Haha! I like Sebastian James, and I certainly think Sebastian James Stanley can work, but like Miranda said, it is long.\n\nStanley: Bl. Stanley Rother is a fantastic holy man to name their baby after! I was reading more about him for this consultation and was moved, again, as always, by his story. I do like that Stanley is Bryan’s Dad’s middle name — it’s always fun when a name can pull double duty! My husband really liked the name Stanley for our youngest, and he wasn’t even aware of Bl. Stanley! He really likes the nickname Stan! ((This here is where I assured them that the hockey reference isn’t that big a deal! But now, let’s talk about the drinking cup — would that be a dealbreaker to any of you right now?))\n\nJames: I’m moving James up because it could be the answer to their dilemma! Miranda said she feels “drawn to” Sebastian and she also wants to honor Bl. Stanley, but she’s worried that Sebastian Stanley doesn’t have a biblical name; James is a biblical name and a family name, but Sebastian James Stanley is clunky … I think Sebastian James could be the solution, because the mission Bl. Stanley served at in Guatamala, and where he was martyred, is Santiago Atitlan — Santiago means St. James! Wow!\n\nFrancis: I’m having trouble moving on from the perfection of Sebastian James! But of course Francis is lovely, and a nice non-cup nod to Bl. Stanley.\n\nJude, Raymond, Dominic, Damien: All of these are great names! I’m glad they included them, to give me a good sense of their taste, but it does seem like unless they change their desire to use Sebastian and to honor Bl. Stanley, these likely won’t be used.\n\nBenedict: I pulled Benedict out because, with its meaning of “blessed,” they could consider this another way to honor Bl. Stanley without using any of his actual names.\n\nSo even though I think this couple has absolutely nailed the name possibilities for their baby if they have a boy, I can always come up with more ideas! 😀 I used the Baby Name Wizard (affiliate link) as I always do, as it lists, for each entry, boy and girl names that are similar in terms of style/feel/popularity, and I also did some research on Cajun Saints, just to see if there was any inspiration there. Based on that, these are my additional ideas for this family:\n\n(1) Shepherd, Rother\n\nMy first ideas here are other ways to honor Bl. Stanley. I was so moved to read in that account of his life that I linked to above that he insisted on returning to Guatemala even after safely escaping because “the shepherd cannot run.” Shepherd could be a great nod to him because of that, and you could even possibly think of it as a biblical name because the word “shepherd” appears in the bible so frequently, and of course has the extra amazing layer of referring to Jesus, too! Shep is a really great nickname, I’ve always liked it.\n\nRother is just another option — I know a family who named their son Rother after Bl. Stanley.\n\n(2) Charles\n\nWhen I was looking to see if there are any Cajun Saints, I came across a story they’re probably already familiar with: that of Servant of God Charlene Richards. Because of her, I thought they might like to add Charles to their list — not only does it have a nice Cajun connection because of her, but there are so many Sts. Charles to choose from as patron, including Pope St. John Paul II (birth name Karol), Bl. Karl of Austria, and St. Charles Borromeo.\n\n(3) August(e), Augustine\n\nAnother Cajun Catholic whose cause for canonization has been opened is Servant of God Auguste “Nonco” Pelafigue. August, Auguste, and Augustine are all wonderful names that they might like to consider; Augustine especially has a similar feel to the heavier Dominic and Benedict on their current list.\n\n(4) Xavier\n\nThese last two were results of my research in the Baby Name Wizard — they’re style matches for Dominic and Damien. Xavier is such a fun name — X is an amazing initial! St. Francis Xavier is amazing patron, as well.\n\n(5) Tristan\n\nI have always loved that Tristan can have a Marian connection via the title Our Lady of Sorrows! I know some people see the connection to sadness as a negative, but I don’t — this post by Theresa on my blog addresses it beautifully, especially this quote about the Catholic view of sorrow: “It is hope, instead of despair, in the face of tragedy. It is fortitude in the face of upset and chaos. It is trust in the midst of darkness. And it is gratitude in the midst of hardship.” That reminds me of their stories of their Samuel and Rocco!\n\nAnd those are my ideas! What do you all think? What name(s) would you suggest for a family with Cajun heritage and a love of Bl. Stanley Rother if their baby is a little brother for Eleanor, Mackie, Samuel, Marc Paul, and Rocco?\n\nRead all about how to get your own baby name consultation here.\n\nFor help with Marian names, my book, Catholic Baby Names for Girls and Boys: Over 250 Ways to Honor Our Lady (Marian Press, 2018), is available to order from ShopMercy.org and Amazon (not affiliate links).

Today’s consultation is perfect for this beautiful feast because the baby’s big brother’s name is Gabriel! In fact, he has the so-handsome combo Gabriel Joseph!\n\nMama Julia writes,\n\n“For the new baby — we found out we were pregnant a few days after the passing of a priest named Fr. Roman, who was something of an important person in my husband’s life, and I just had the random thought — oh, if it’s a boy, what if we named him Roman — after this priest, and also I found it to be a unique name with super cute nicknames: Romie, Romeo, Rome. I raised the idea with my husband and he seemed to like it – but he isn’t too sure about it. I think because using the exact same name means we are naming the baby after this particular priest, which seems maybe too onerous??\n\nThen somewhere along the line I just clung to the name Roman John Paul — St. John Paul II is definitely a key figure in my life as I spent years studying at the JPII Institute in D.C., and my husband and I invoke his intercession every night (along with St. Joseph, and the archangels Gabriel, Raphael, and Michael…).\n\nHowever, I’m also toying with the idea of using John Paul as a first name. I love what you quoted in th"
