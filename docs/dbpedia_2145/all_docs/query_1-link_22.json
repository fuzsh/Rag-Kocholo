In addition to competing with Murrieta, she also competes with Westside Dance Project's Performance Company.\n\nOn the season 3 reunion finale of Lifetime's Dance Moms, Talia performed a solo. Abby Lee Miller announced on the episode that Talia would be dancing for the Abby Lee Dance Company the next season, yet Talia never showed up on the show until season 5, when she began competing against the ALDC with MDP. It is unknown why Talia did not ever compete for the show as was promised.\n\nTalia is also on her high school dance team at Vista Murrieta High School and maintains a 4.14 GPA. She is a featured assistant for Art of Movement Dance Convention, a CLI Studios Brand Ambassador, a member of Artists Giving Hope and is a model for the Pearl Yukiko clothing line.
