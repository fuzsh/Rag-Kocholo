Names at the top of a list have the greatest change in popularity, while those at the bottom have the smallest change in popularity. Generally, the more popular a name, the smaller the change in popularity.\n\nFor each year, rank 1 indicates the most popular name, rank 2 the next most popular, and so forth. A change in popularity is indicated by the difference, either an increase or decrease, in ranks from one year to the next. We compared ranks for both years only if a name was in the top 1000 in at least one of the 2 years."
