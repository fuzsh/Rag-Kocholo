Talia Seitel (born April 23, 2001) is a dancer at Murrieta Dance Project. She is the daughter of Jennifer Seitel and the older sister of Kayla Seitel. Talia has been dancing at MDP since she was four years old, but began her preschool dance training at two years old. In addition to competing with Murrieta, she also competes with Westside Dance Project's Performance Company.

On the season 3 reunion finale of Lifetime's Dance Moms, Talia performed a solo. Abby Lee Miller announced on the episode that Talia would be dancing for the Abby Lee Dance Company the next season, yet Talia never showed up on the show until season 5, when she began competing against the ALDC with MDP. It is unknown why Talia did not ever compete for the show as was promised.

Talia is also on her high school dance team at Vista Murrieta High School and maintains a 4.14 GPA. She is a featured assistant for Art of Movement Dance Convention, a CLI Studios Brand Ambassador, a member of Artists Giving Hope and is a model for the Pearl Yukiko clothing line. Talia will be going to Chapman College this fall and someday dance for a professional company.
