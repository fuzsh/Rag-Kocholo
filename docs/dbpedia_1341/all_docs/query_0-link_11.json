        "text": "The Eolica Casimcea Wind Farm is a proposed wind power project in Casimcea, Tulcea County, Romania.[1] It will consist of six individual wind farms connected together. It will have 122 individual wind turbines[2] with a nominal output of around 2 MW which will deliver up to 244 MW of power, enough to power over 150,000 homes, with a capital investment required of approximately US$300 million."
