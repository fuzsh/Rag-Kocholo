        "text": "(1879–1960). Max von Laue was the German recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1914 for his discovery of the diffraction of X-rays in crystals. This enabled scientists to study the structure of crystals and hence marked the origin of solid-state physics, an important field in the development of modern electronics.\n\nMax Theodor Felix von Laue was born on October 9, 1879, in Pfaffendorf, near Koblenz, Germany. He became professor of physics at the University of Zürich (Switzerland) in 1912. Laue was the first physicist to suggest the use of a crystal to act as a grating for the diffraction of X-rays, showing that if a beam of X-rays passed through a crystal, diffraction would take place and a pattern would be formed on a photographic plate placed at a right angle to the direction of the rays. The pattern would mark out the symmetrical arrangements of the atoms in the crystal. This was verified experimentally in 1912 by two of Laue’s students working under his direction. This success demonstrated that X-rays are electromagnetic radiations similar to light and also provided experimental proof that the atomic structure of crystals is a regularly repeating arrangement."
