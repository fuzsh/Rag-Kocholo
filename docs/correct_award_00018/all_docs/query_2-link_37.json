        "text": "Who is the youngest person to receive the Nobel Prize in Physics? Here are some clues: • He was one of the founders of the scientific field of X-ray crystallography • His father was also a laureate • He won a Nobel Prize when he was just 25 The answer is Lawrence Bragg, who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics 1915 with his father, William Bragg. Lawrence was born on this day in 1890. For a long time, Lawrence Bragg was not always recognised in his own right for his seminal work in formulating the law that helped give birth to the scientific field of X-ray crystallography. For example, in 1913, shortly after Lawrence’s law was published, his father was invited to an important conference, but he was not invited. He did at least receive a postcard signed by famous participants, including other laureates such as Marie Curie, Albert Einstein, Max von Laue, Hendrik Lorentz, and Ernest Rutherford, congratulating him for \"advancing the course of natural science.\" When the Braggs were both awarded the Barnard Medal in the spring of 1915, Rutherford wrote to William Bragg expressing that: \"It is very early for your boy [Lawrence] to be getting these distinctions.\" A few months later, Lawrence Bragg made Nobel Prize history by becoming a laureate at 25 years old.
