        "text": "AKA Max Theodor Felix von Laue\n\nBorn: 9-Oct-1879\n\nBirthplace: Pfaffendorf, Germany\n\nDied: 23-Apr-1960\n\nLocation of death: Berlin, Germany\n\nCause of death: Accident - Automobile\n\nRemains: Buried, Göttingen City Cemetery, Göttingen, Germany\n\nGender: Male\n\nReligion: Christian\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Physicist\n\nNationality: Germany\n\nExecutive summary: X-ray crystallography\n\nMilitary service: German Army (1898-99)\n\nGerman physicist Max von Laue won the Nobel Prize in 1914, for his work measuring the wavelength of x-rays by their diffraction through the atoms of a crystal. His studies showed that x-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation similar to light, and that crystals have a molecular structure that regularly repeats its arrangement. He studied or worked under David Hilbert, Arnold Sommerfeld, Albert Einstein, and Max Planck, and made significant contributions to the scientific understanding of how applied magnetic fields affect superconductivity.\n\nAs the Nazis came to power in Germany, von Laue openly criticized the governmental stance against \"Jewish physics\" (i.e., Einstein), and remained in contact with otherwise-isolated Jewish colleagues. During World War II he refused to work on the Nazi program to develop nuclear weapons, and instead wrote a respected book on the history of physics. Still, as one of the leading physicists in Germany, he was among the scientists taken into custody after the war, and was imprisoned for almost a year at Farm Hill in England. During his incarceration he wrote a paper on the absorption of X-rays.\n\nHe was an early and enthusiastic adapter of the automobile, and had a reputation for driving at fast speeds. He was seriously injured in a collision with a motorcycle in Berlin on 7 April 1960 in which the cyclist was killed, and von Laue died of his injuries about two weeks later.\n\nFather: Julius von Laue (military official)\n\nWife: Magdalena Degen (m. 1910)\n\nHigh School: Protestantische Gymnasium, Strasbourg, Germany (1898)\n\nUniversity: University of Strassburg\n\nUniversity: BS, University of Göttingen (1904)\n\nUniversity: University of Munich (one semester)\n\nUniversity: PhD Mathematics and Physics, University of Berlin (1903)\n\nScholar: University of Göttingen (1903-04)\n\nLecturer: Thermodynamics, University of Munich (1909-12)\n\nProfessor: Physics, University of Zürich (1912-14)\n\nProfessor: Physics, University of Frankfurt (1914-16)\n\nProfessor: Physics, University of Munich (1919-43)\n\nAdministrator: Director, Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Berlin (1919-43)\n\nProfessor: Physics, University of Göttingen (1951-58)\n\nAdministrator: Director, Max Planck Institute, Berlin (1951-58)\n\nNobel Prize for Physics 1914\n\nMatteucci Medal 1914\n\nMax Planck Medal 1932\n\nKnighthood Order Pour le Mérite:1952\n\nHelmholtz Medal 1959 (awarded by East Berlin Academy of Sciences)\n\nGrand Cross with Star for Federal Services 1953\n\nFrench Legion of Honor 1957 (Officer)\n\nAccademia dei Lincei\n\nAmerican Physical Society Foreign Member\n\nGerman Academy of Science\n\nGerman Physical Society\n\nGerman Mathematical Society\n\nInternational Union of Crystallographers\n\nPontifical Academy of Sciences\n\nRoyal Society Foreign Member\n\nRussian Academy of Sciences\n\nTaken Prisoner of War 1945-46 (Farm Hill Prison, near Cambridge, England)\n\nGerman Ancestry\n\nAsteroid Namesake 10762 von Laue\n\nLunar Crater von Laue (28.0°N 96.7°W , 87 km. diameter)\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nDas Relativitätsprinzip (The Theory of Relativity) (1911)\n\nDie Theorien der Radiologie (The Theories of Radiology) (1925)\n\nRöntgenstrahl-Interferenzen (X-Ray Interferences) (1941)\n\nGeschichte der Physik (History of Physics) (1943)\n\nTheorie der Supraleitung (Theory of Superconductivity) (1947)\n\nMateriewellen und ihre Interferenzen (Matter Waves and Their Interference) (1948)\n\nGesammelte Schriften und Vorträge (Collected Writings & Lectures) (1961)\n\nNew!\n\nNNDB MAPPER Create a map starting with Max von Laue\n\nRequires Flash 7+ and Javascript.\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
