        "text": "Unfortunately, director Frank Coraci (“The Wedding Singer,” “The Waterboy”) also delivers — an egg.\n\nThroughout the talking-animals-help-a-guy-get-his-girlfriend-back formula, James and the cast make a valiant effort to hold the film together. The backdrop of Boston adds cohesion, but then Joe Rogan’s Gale jumps a curb halfway between Kenmore Square and downtown. When he lands, he winds up at the bottom of the stairs across from the State House.\n\nThe cast plugs along. Bas Rutten voices a wolf who helps explain to James’ character Griffin Keyes the finer points of urinating on stuff to attract a mate. The theme that animals think differently than humans comes up repeatedly, but is best expressed in the bonus features.\n\nWorking with a live gorilla proved impossible for the crew, so two actors brought Bernie (voiced by Nick Nolte) to life. They sweated, suffered a lack of ventilation, followed James around Boston, sweated, and one of them ran into a parked van at one point. Anyone interested in pursuing a career portraying animals in film should check out the redeeming set of extras."
