Have an account? .\n\nFor Father's Day, here are some nearly identical parent-child pairings who have similar careers.\n\nFrom TV and film to music and more, these fathers have inspired their sons creatively.\n\nSome have played dads to their sons in projects, or their sons have played younger versions of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDamon Wayans and his son Damon Wayans Jr. have shared the screen together.\n\nDamon, 61, is best known for his stand-up comedy from the '90s and his sitcoms like \"In Living Color\" and \"My Wife and Kids.\"\n\nThe comedian's son, Damon Jr., 39, shares the same name, looks strikingly like him, and also caught the acting bug. The younger actor is best known for his roles in \"New Girl\" and \"Happy Endings.\"\n\nThe father-son duo have also collaborated on acting projects. Both were in \"My Wife and Kids,\" \"The Underground,\" and Damon made a cameo as his son's character's father in both \"Happy Endings\" and his son's other sitcom, \"Happy Together.\"\n\n\"I've been waiting for this for a long time. He's not hanging on my coattails. I'm on his,\" Damon told Spoiler TV in 2018. \"So I have to come in and be Damon 2 [...] I'm super proud.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert Irwin has picked up his late father Steve Irwin's looks and love for wildlife.\n\nThe late Steve Irwin was one of the most recognizable faces in the world of wildlife conservation and became a loved figure by many. In addition to his conservation efforts, he was an environmentalist, zookeeper, and a TV personality best known for his documentary series \"The Crocodile Hunter.\"\n\nSteve was 44 years old when he died from being pierced by a stingray in 2006. His son, Robert, now 18, was just two years old at the time.\n\nRobert has grown into the spitting image of his father in more ways than one. He shares the same charismatic and caring personality as his dad, and also went on to gain the same love of animals that his father had, particularly for crocodiles. Robert has now become a wildlife conservationist and TV personality.\n\nHe's known for his talk show appearances and reality TV series \"Crikey! It's the Irwins,\" alongside his mother, Terri, and sister, Bindi. Robert also works with the Australia Zoo like his father did and has successfully pursued wildlife photography.\n\n\"I hope in every aspect of my life that I can make him proud, and [make] sure that his message never dies,\" Robert told Esquire Middle East in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth of Billie Joe Armstrong's sons have his musical genes and perform in their own rock bands.\n\nThe Green Day frontman has been going strong as a prominent and influential singer and musician for over 30 years. Billie Joe, 50, has a knack for creating timeless punk rock and pop-rock music, a skill trickled down to his two sons.\n\nBillie's younger son, who goes by the stage name Jakob Danger, 23, followed in his father's footsteps. He is a singer-songwriter and guitarist both as a solo artist and for his punk band Mt. Eddy, which formed in 2017.\n\nThe \"American Idiot\" singer's older son Joey Armstrong is also a singer and has been the drummer for the alternative rock brand SWMRS since 2004, though the band's status is unclear at the moment.\n\nIn July 2020, Joey was accused of sexual misconduct and emotional abuse by musician Lydia Night. The two started dating when she was 16 and he was 22. He released a statement, saying in part, \"While I don't agree with some of the things she said about me, it's important she be allowed to say them and that she be supported for speaking out. I respect her immensely and fully accept that I failed her as a partner.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDenzel Washington's son, John David Washington, has been on the same path to stardom.\n\nDenzel, 67, is Hollywood royalty, playing major roles in blockbuster films like \"Remember the Titans,\" \"Training Day,\" and \"The Equalizer.\" He's had a long, successful career and his shoes may seem difficult to step into, but his son John David Washington, 37, is on his way.\n\nJohn David's first minor acting credit was as a student in Spike Lee's 1992 film \"Malcolm X,\" which his father starred in as the real-life revolutionary.\n\nHe then pursued a career as a professional NFL player, before seriously transitioning to acting and starring in the football comedy \"Ballers.\" Within the last few years, he's made a name for himself with films like \"BlacKkKlansman,\" \"Tenet,\" and \"Malcolm & Marie.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYoung actor Michael Gandolfini is a doppelg√§nger of his late father, James Gandolfini.\n\nThe late James Gandolfini famously played the Italian mob boss Tony Soprano in the HBO series \"The Sopranos.\" He unexpectedly died at 51 years old in 2013 from a heart attack. His son, Michael, now 23, was a teenager at the time.\n\nAfter this tragedy, Michael turned to acting like his father. He first starred in the TV series \"The Deuce\" and the film \"Cherry\" before giving his most notable performance to date in \"The Many Saints of Newark.\"\n\nIn this \"Sopranos\" prequel movie, Michael played a younger version of his father's character.\n\n\"It's uncanny,\" actor Steve Schirripa previously told Insider about Michael's appearance and performance. \"He looked so much like his dad and he always has.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScott Eastwood is just one of Clint Eastwood's children who has stepped into his acting shoes.\n\nClint, 92, has been in the entertainment industry for over six decades as an iconic actor, writer, director, and producer. He's known for his Western characters and action-packed films.\n\nHis son Scott, 36, looks strikingly like Clint did when he was younger and shares the same smoldering look. He also stepped into show business. Scott had small roles when he started and also acted in Clint's directorial projects like \"Gran Torino\" and \"Invictus,\" and co-starred with him in the film \"Trouble with the Curve.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to just soak up every piece of knowledge I can from him,\" Scott told Joe Rogan in 2021 about his collaborations with his father.\n\nScott has gone on to star in dramas like \"The Longest Ride\" and \"Snowden,\" and action films like \"Suicide Squad\" and \"The Fate of the Furious.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter his father Prince Charles, Prince William is next in line to the throne.\n\nCharles, the Prince of Wales, 73, has been serving the British monarchy for decades under his parents, Queen Elizabeth II and the late Prince Philip. Charles is the next in line to serve as the King of England, and his eldest son, William, the Duke of Cambridge, 39, is a working royal who is set to become king afterwards.\n\nAlthough they have a height difference, with William standing five inches taller than his father, and different public personas, they look very similar, especially when Charles was younger.\n\nWhile William will follow in his father's footsteps, his younger brother Harry, 37, has famously stepped away from royal duties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristian \"King\" Combs shares the same rapping chops as his famous father, Sean Combs, aka Diddy.\n\nDiddy, 52, is a powerhouse rapper, record executive, and TV producer. His larger-than-life personality and signature style has made him a household name over the last three decades.\n\nHis look-alike son Christian, 24, better known by his stage name King Combs, has also stepped into the music industry as a rapper. He signed to his father's record label, Bad Boys Entertainment, in 2016 and has since released several songs, EPs, and an album.\n\nBefore this, as a child, he was featured in Sean's 2001 music video for \"Bad Boys For Life.\"\n\n\"I definitely feel like I need to live up to this legacy,\" Christian told DailyMotion in 2018. \"I feel like it's a different type of responsibility that I'm held to and I'm ready to take that.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDistinguished careers and similar physical appearances link Kurt and Wyatt Russell.\n\nFrom his roles in \"Escape from New York,\" \"The Hateful Eight,\" and \"The Christmas Chronicles\" franchise, Kurt, 71, has been an ever-present face in Hollywood.\n\nAfter pursuing a career in hockey, Wyatt, 35, transitioned into acting, as well. Wyatt looks eerily like his father, especially when they both grow out their facial hair.\n\nLike his father before him, Wyatt has appeared in various genres throughout his career, from comedies such as \"This Is 40\" and \"22 Jump Street,\" to an episode of the dystopian sci-fi series \"Black Mirror\" called \"Playtest,\" to the true crime series \"Under the Banner of Heaven,\" in which he plays a terrifying fundamentalist Mormon.\n\nThe father and son are also both in the Marvel Universe, with Kurt appearing in \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" and Wyatt in \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\" Disney+ series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActor Jesse Johnson inherited his father Don Johnson's movie star looks and talents.\n\nDon, 72, has had a diverse career from a TV and movie actor, to a director, to a singer-songwriter. He is potentially best known for his role as James \"Sonny\" Crockett, the heartthrob police officer in the '80s TV series \"Miami Vice.\"\n\nDon's son Jesse, 39, is a dead ringer for '80s Don, and is also an actor. He played a minor role in Don's famous show \"Nash Bridges\" in 2001, and has continued guest-starring in projects like \"Law & Order,\" \"Grey's Anatomy,\" \"NCIS,\" and \"Twin Peaks: The Return.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhil Collins' sons Simon Collins and Nic Collins have both gotten into rock music.\n\nThe former Genesis drummer and solo singer Phil, 71, has had a legendary career.\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Famer announced in March 2022 that he would stop performing with the band due to nerve damage and spinal injuries from his work. Although his touring career is slowing down, his legacy will live on through his many talented children, two of whom are musicians.\n\nSimon, 45, is a drummer and was the lead vocalist in the rock band Sound of Contact until 2018. He also has a solo career.\n\nNic, 21, is also a drummer. When Phil had to stop playing the drums as part of Genesis, Nic took over, joining the band on their 2021/2022 tour and playing the drums instead. He also has his own band, Better Strangers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEugene and Dan Levy share an uncanny resemblance and famously played father and son on-screen.\n\nEugene, 75, has put his comedic stamp on the TV and film industries for decades. Some of his most notable work includes the \"SCTV\" series, \"Best in Show,\" and \"American Pie.\"\n\nBut Eugene's biggest legacy is now perhaps the beloved sitcom \"Schitt's Creek,\" which he famously starred in and co-produced with his son, Dan, 38. Their real-life relationship and camaraderie is amplified in the show, as Eugene plays Johnny Rose, the father of Dan's character, David Rose.\n\n\"He's been doing a great job on the show, really fantastic. And it's fun watching him work.
