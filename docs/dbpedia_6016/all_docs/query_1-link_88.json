        "text": "And they are obviously responding to his caring presence. But Griffin has\n\nproblems when it comes to relating to humans.\n\nIt seems he’d proposed to good-looking girlfriend Leslie (Stephanie Bibb),\n\nbut she not only rejected him, she dumped him. So Griffin has been\n\nmoping around for, oh, about five years, but he does have a good working\n\nrelationship with the zoo’s veterinarian, Kate (Rosario Dawson). When\n\nGriffin suddenly bumps into Leslie again at his brother’s wedding, he\n\nswoons all over again, and wonders aloud how he can attract her attention\n\nonce more.\n\nThe animals, who only talk when the humans aren’t around, decide to break\n\ntheir code of silence in order to give Griffin some friendly advice. At first,\n\nof course, Griffin has to get over the fact that they can talk (and actually\n\ngather together every night to visit each other with the help of the monkey\n\nwho picks the locks on all the gates). The animals, naturally, all have\n\ndifferent advice: the frog says he should puff up, well, like a toad. The\n\nfemale lion (the voice of Cher, no less), advises him to make Leslie jealous\n\nby showing up at the wedding reception with another girl. The male lion\n\n(the voice of Sylvester Stallone, which is a very interesting matchup with\n\nCher), predictably, advises him to stand down his rival and then separate her\n\nfrom the herd and move in for the “kill.” The wolf advises him to “mark his\n\nterritory” publicly, which is another opportunity for little sight gags. The\n\nbears think he ought to alternate being nice to her and being mean to her,\n\nwith the supposed result that he will be in control of the relationship. This\n\nlast one plays out a little strangely, and goes against the feel-good mantra of\n\nthe whole. You’re supposed to be intentionally mean to people to get them\n\nto like you?\n\nFinally, Griffin decides to ask Kate to accompany him to the reception, and\n\nthey enjoy some luminously funny moments, but somehow Griffin doesn’t\n\nrealize Kate’s attentions are more than just an act for Leslie’s benefit.\n\nMeanwhile, Griffin finally accepts that car salesman job that his brother has\n\nbeen hounding him about, and after some initial success (where we get to\n\nsee some more of Kevin James, the comedian, cutting loose), Griffin soon\n\nrealizes how unhappy he is not being around the animals, and also around\n\nKate. We all know how it’s going to end. But he didn’t have to be mean to\n\nLeslie as a kind of payback in kind, and revenge in full, did he?\n\nSure, the film could have been funnier. It’s uneven, determinedly puerile\n\nand at times just plain awkward, as most Adam Sandler movies are (he\n\nplayed the monkey who kept making poop jokes). But, also like most\n\nAdam Sandler movies, there’s a certain populist charm here as well, and an\n\neasygoing kind of romanticism that feels comfortable and uncomplicated.\n\n“Zookeeper” won’t win any awards, but is a harmless popcorn movie for the\n\nwhole family."
