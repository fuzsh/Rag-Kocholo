        "text": "Kevin James has had quite a successful film career after his long run on television. His previous films were mainly anchored by other stars. Zookeeper, a family comedy about talking animals helping their lovable caretaker win back an ex-girlfriend, is Kevin James' first lead role since Paul Blart: Mall Cop. Rosario Dawson co-stars as a fellow zookeeper who harbors a secret crush, and Leslie Bibb appears as the aforementioned ex-girlfriend. I recently had a chance to interview the stars in New York City. Kevin James has lost a lot of weight. He's remarkably thinner. It was clear that the ladies had a great time working with him. He's got a great sense of humor and is very approachable. Check out our interviews below where they discuss working with animals and each other.\n\nZookeeper comes to theaters July 8th, 2011 and stars Kevin James, Rosario Dawson, Leslie Bibb, Ken Jeong, Donnie Wahlberg, Joe Rogan, Nat Faxon, Steffiana De La Cruz. The film is directed by Frank Coraci.\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.
