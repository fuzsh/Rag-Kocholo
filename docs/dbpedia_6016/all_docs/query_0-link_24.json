        "text": "We want the same from comedians as from great ballplayers: that they \"leave it all on the field.\" Kevin James does just that. From his pairings with Adam Sandler to Paul Blart: Mall Cop, he hurls himself at the physical shtick and never lets on that he knows he doesn't make art.\n\nIn his latest, Zookeeper, James takes a pounding through pratfalls, bicycle spills and porcupine pokes, creating a child-oriented romantic comedy like a Night at the Museum at the zoo.\n\nWith slapstick and sincerity, the actor accepts the idea that he makes friends with animals big and small; and that, as a guy with limited prospects and a lineman-gone-to-seed physique, he has a shot - several shots - at a beauty such as Leslie Bibb.\n\nThe talking-animal comedy finds the hapless Griffin (James), zookeeper at Franklin Park Zoo, receiving advice from the critters in his charge.\n\nThe animals have always kept to \"the code,\" enforced by Joe the Lion (Sylvester Stallone): no talking to humans.\n\nYet, in a proposal scene that opens the movie, Griffin strikes out with the fair Stephanie (Bibb), about whom the animals have heard him go on and on for years.\n\nEnough is enough: To help the friendly zookeeper close the deal, the animal kingdom will get him up to speed on what it knows by instinct - the mating game.\n\nJoe the Lion suggests \"cutting her from the herd\" - getting her away from her boyfriend (Joe Rogan), an over-the-top boor. The lioness (Cher) supports the thought of making her jealous.\n\nThe bears, Jerome (Jon Favreau) and Bruce (Faizon Love), offer advice on becoming a predator. And: \"Lead with your puddin' cup,\" they say. Which means what we think it does.\n\nThe capuchin monkey (Adam Sandler, doing a funny voice) is lost in reveries about having a thumb: \"I've been blessed.\"\n\nAnd the elephant (Judd Apatow) has the same solution for any awkward moment: \"Flee. Fleeing is the new fighting.\"\n\nAll along, Griffin can't see how sweet and seemingly available the zoo's eagle expert and vet (Rosario Dawson) is. She's into guys who are into animals.\n\n\"You're like the frickin' hippo whisperer,\" she cracks.\n\nDirector Frank Coraci, a veteran of Sandler's comic style ( The Waterboy), is more at home with the slapstick than the would-be romance or the movie's darker subtext. Bernie (Nick Nolte), a forlorn gorilla, has long been kept in a cave so he can't repeat his attack on a cruel zookeeper (Donnie Wahlberg). The film's silliest scenes involve Griffin dragging Bernie along to Bernie's dream eatery - T.G.I. Friday's - where Bernie, supposedly on his way to a costume party, is a hit.\n\nThe film's mix of digital critters and real animals results in many shots of this beast or that one standing alone, mouth moving, cracking jokes.\n\nBut the cuddly, ever-put-upon James takes his comic lumps like a man. His Griffin suffers injuries and indignities and lets us laugh at him as he does. No matter where the script wanders or the direction founders, at some point, James' comic instincts take over. And they don't let him down."
