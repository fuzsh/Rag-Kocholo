The animals have listened to Griffin pine over her for years and, after she reappears in his life, they decide to help Griffin rekindle the relationship and become the alpha male she wants him to be. They inadvertently reveal their secret ability to talk and, after Griffin's initial shock, teach him the rules of courtship, animal-style. Surprisingly, the animals' advice really works and Griffin is about to get everything he's ever dreamed of--or is he?\n\nFrank Coraci\n\nDirector\n\nDavid Ronn, Jay Scherick\n\nStory\n\nScott Hill\n\nEditor\n\nAdam Sandler, Todd Garner, Jack Giarraputo, Kevin James, Walt Becker\n\nProducer\n\nKindhearted Griffin Keyes is one of the best-loved caretakers at the Franklin Park Zoo, but he's more comfortable with the animals than with females of his own species as proven by his failed marriage proposal to the self-absorbed Stephanie several years ago.
