Griffin loses his girlfriend because she doesn't like what he does for a living. He gets the chance to win her back, but he thinks he needs to get a new job and leave the zoo. The animals, however, think otherwise. It turns out that animals can talk and they reveal this secret to Griffin. Then they work to help him win back his girlfriend.

Parts are very funny, but other scenes are just crude. It was okay.\n\n3 of 5 Ducks\n\nWatch the Movie Trailer\n\nWe are sorry, the trailer has been removed."
