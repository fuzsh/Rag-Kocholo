        "text": "It's always a dubious sign when you watch the coming-attractions trailer for a movie and immediately identify other movies that it filches from (or draws inspiration from, if you want to be charitable).\n\nWith “Zookeeper,” starring big-guy Kevin James in full Jackie Gleason form, the immediate influences are all too obvious. His upbeat, big-hearted, blue-collar zookeeper Griffin Keyes is a kindred spirit to the actor's earnest security guard in “Paul Blart: Mall Cop” (who was a direct offshoot of James' regular-guy delivery man in “The King of Queens”).\n\nAnd the fanciful notion of zoo animals, mute and inscrutable by day, becoming antic mischief makers and chatterbox lonely-hearts advisers when the zoo gates are locked appears to draw heavily on the after-hours fantasy of “Night at the Museum” and its sequel.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's the whole “Doctor Dolittle” thing.\n\nBut what “Zookeeper” lacks in narrative freshness, it sort of makes up for in technical wizardry.\n\nJames and his human co-stars — Leslie Bibb as Stephanie, Griffin's self-centered and fickle girlfriend who thinks zoo keeping is a dead-end job, and Rosario Dawson as Kate, Griffin's dedicated fellow zookeeper and obvious soul mate — might populate a bland and predictable comic-romantic story (with five credited writers, which is never a good sign).\n\nBut the animal cast of supporting players is an all-star ensemble of real zoo creatures, one big animatronic ape and an amazing menagerie of A-list actors lending them sassy attitude and vibrant voice.\n\nWhen Griffin considers forsaking his much-loved zoo gig and taking a fast-lane job as car salesman, to satisfy Stephanie's materialistic lusts, the zoo animals agree to break their ancient code of silence and talk to their beloved keeper. Their plan: counsel Griffin on the fine points of wooing and winning the female of the species.\n\nNaturally, this sets up a lot of over-the-top comic business for James to mug and muddle his way through. But the best laughs are scored by the animals, with computer-generated imagery animating their talking mouths. There are great wisecracks and one-liners delivered by Donald the laconic capuchin monkey (voiced by Adam Sandler), Joe the pugnacious lion (Sylvester Stallone), Janet the patient lioness (Cher), Jerome the blustery bear (Jon Favreau), Barry the elephant (filmmaker Judd Apatow), Mollie the jive-talking giraffe (Maya Rudolph) and others.\n\nThe only fake animal in the cast is Bernie, a melancholy gorilla (gravel-voiced Nick Nolte), who bonds with Griffin, enjoys a guys-night-out at TGI Fridays and convinces the forlorn zookeeper that his true calling is caring for the animals. (Bernie is an actor in an ape suit, topped with an astoundingly expressive mechanical head.)\n\nJames is a highly likable lug who moves with a comic grace that recalls Gleason and who manages to sell this lightweight trifle with more conviction than it deserves. Still, the star attractions of “Zookeeper” are the funny, wisecracking animals that manage to upstage their human co-stars at every turn."
