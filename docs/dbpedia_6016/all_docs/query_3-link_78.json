        "text": "By ,\n\nWell-meaning, sort of sweet, but can't really get it together: That describes both Kevin James' character and his new movie, \"Zookeeper.\"\n\nWhich is too bad, because both seem to have a lot of untapped potential.\n\nDirectory Frank Coraci, veteran of several Adam Sandler comedies (\"The Waterboy,\" \"The Wedding Singer\"), steers the humor from the broadly slapstick to the logically absurd and back again. He owes what success he has to James' good-natured, all-in attitude.\n\nJames plays a caring, competent zookeeper whose brain is short-circuited when he re-connects with the vapid model who broke his heart five years earlier because his job wasn't impressive enough.\n\nWhen he considers becoming a high-end car dealer to impress her, the animals break their vow of silence to give him some truly terrible (and often gross) romantic advice.\n\nAn impressively random menagerie of celebrities give the animals their voices, including Sandler, Nick Nolte, Maya Rudolph, Judd Apatow, Cher and Sylvester Stallone.\n\nSandler gets the most laughs with lines that seem ad-libbed around the animals' natural actions, augmented by digitally enhanced mouth movement. You can almost see the five guys who share screenwriting credit - including James - shouting smart-aleck lines at nature film footage of animals and then turning it into a script.\n\nStallone and Cher get a few chuckles, too. I think they'd make an interesting comic screen couple - in human form.\n\nAnd Rosario Dawson as the zoo veterinarian in love with James - did I mention absurd? - is a welcome comedic surprise.\n\nLess successful are a ridiculous gorilla field trip to T.G.I. Friday's and a pointless and dark subplot about animal abuse by fellow zookeeper Donnie Wahlberg, who pops up infrequently but still too often.\n\nResist the temptation to bolt from this ultimately disappointing movie: The outtakes over the closing credits are the funniest part.\n\nZookeeper **"
