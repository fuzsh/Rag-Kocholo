        "text": "The Zookeeper is no Mr. Popper’s Penguins. On the continuum of live-action talking-animal films, it’s somewhat more emotionally resonant than the execrable Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties, but less amusing than the airplane candy Dr. Dolittle.\n\nThe should-be-more-fun gag at the core of the film — made by Frank Coraci, director of Adam Sandler’s The Wedding Singer and Click — is that the beasts begin talking, and use their skill to give a neurotic, husky zookeper named Griffin (played by Kevin James) all sorts of animal-kingdom advice on mating. You see, Griffin is hopelessly obsessed with Stephanie, a superficial, skinny snoot (Leslie Bibb), and unaware of Kate, the comely veterinarian (Rosario Dawson) right under his snout.\n\nThe wolf tells Griffin to mark his territory, so he pees into a potted palm. A lion tells Griffin to separate Stephanie from the herd, so he cuts her off. A bear tells him to “lead with his puddin’ cup,” so he thrusts his crotch at her idiot boyfriend (played by a stiff, unfunny Joe Rogan).\n\nComplain all you want about the success of chronic self-debaser Kevin James, but the man is gloriously game. His wedding proposal is brutally rejected in the first scene. Soon after, he’ll have a porcupine shoot quills into his face, and endure a brutal series of prat-falls that employ the thudding humor of his weight. When James (or his stunt double) smacks his head or thumps to the ground, you feel the surround-sound impact of his mortification. Often, though, he’s just overacting next to a robotic gorilla — so the transitions back into more realistic human-on-human scenes are, to be kind, unconvincing.\n\nAnd the animals? They’re animated as well as a Geico commercial — and fall into some bland uncanny valley of boredom. But the beastly voice cast is so star-studded it would rival an episode of Dancing With the Stars, including Sylvester Stallone as the hen-pecked lion and Cher as his domineering lioness. (Judd Apatow makes the least sense as a scaredy-cat elephant.) The best? As a capuchin monkey who lords his opposable thumbs over all the other animals, Adam Sandler does a husky, garbled voice that recalls his most weirdo SNL goofiness: It’s like Gilbert Gottfried swallowed Gollum.\n\nIf pratfalls and silly voices are sometimes fun, nothing else works: Five screenwriters are credited, because no one writer can recall so many bland catchphrases. (The film’s best line is the monkey’s advice: “Throw poop at her.”) Other lines seem too tasteless for kids and too dumb for adults, like: “Canadian bears are born with an extra claw — and they know how to use it … Canadian bears are wild.”"
