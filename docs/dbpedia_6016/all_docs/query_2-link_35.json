        "text": "#10: Megan Washington as Calypso Various\n\nBluey’s teacher, a Blue Merle Australian Shepherd named Calypso, is featured throughout all three seasons of the cartoon. And if the beloved educator’s soothing voice sounds familiar to you, it might be because the actor is Megan Washington, an Australian musician and songwriter. As of 2022, she’s the recipient of 3 ARIA Music Awards, and her albums are no stranger to the ARIA charts. So of course, it would be a missed opportunity if Washington didn’t show off her amazing voice on the show. Thankfully, fans get a taste of her skill in the season 1 episode “Calypso” when she sings about sister rain.\n\n#9: Darren Hanlon as Alt Energy Dog \"Sheep Dog\"\n\nAnother Australian singer-songwriter to join the ranks of “Bluey” is Darren Hanlon, who is credited with voicing Alt Energy Dog in the Season 3 episode “Sheep Dog.” It’s truly a blink-and-you-miss-it moment. Hanlon’s character knocks on the Heelers’ door to inquire about helping them save money on their energy bill. What he doesn’t realize is that patriarch Bandit is distracting the girls by pretending to be a sheepdog in order to allow Chilli to get some time to herself. The poor salesman doesn’t know what he’s walking into, but it makes for entertaining viewing!\n\n#8: Sean Choolburra as Maynard “Grandad” & “Explorers”\n\nFunnyman Sean Choolburra, who is also known as “The Godfather of Indigenous Comedy,” has appeared in two episodes of \"Bluey.\" Choolburra voices the character of Maynard, an Irish Wolfhound and fishing enthusiast who lives relatively near Bluey and Bingo's grandad Mort. He may not be a major player on the kids show, but his brief appearances are full of hilarious quips that make them memorable. Who could forget the time when he thinks Bluey, Bingo and their grandpa are running from aliens? Or when he explains to Jack’s dad that he got rid of his phone because it kept ringing? We’d take more Maynard any day.\n\n#7: Anthony Field as Rusty’s Dad & Postie Various\n\nKid’s group the Wiggles were huge in Australia in the 1990s. So it’s very fitting for Anthony Field, also known as the Blue Wiggle, to lend his voice to this Aussie children’s hit. Field provides a couple of voices, like that of Rusty's dad, a Red Kelpie and army man. But our favorite character that he brings to life is Catahoula Leopard Dog Postie, who, as you could probably guess, is on staff at the post office. He first appears in season 2’s “Dance Mode”, where he unexpectedly ends up getting a front row seat to a performance by Bandit. Yes, it’s as fun as it sounds.\n\n#6: Hamish & Zoë Foster Blake as Jack’s Parents & Hammerbarn Employees Various\n\nBandit and Chilli aren’t the only power couple on “Bluey.” Husband and wife duo, comedian Hamish Blake and author Zoë Foster Blake, have voiced Jack’s mom and dad, as well as some Hammerbarn employees. And the excitement they shared over their guest roles is adorable. As parents to two young tots, the Australian natives are true fans of the show. Hamish has even called Bandit his “hero”! So when the opportunity to appear on the show came up, he said “there was only one possible response: whackadoo.” He even dubbed it a “career pinnacle”. Here’s to that!\n\n#5: Robert Irwin as Alfie “The Quiet Game”\n\nConservationist and zookeeper Robert Irwin, the son of the late Steve Irwin, saves the day in the Season 2 episode “The Quiet Game.” Irwin lends his voice to Alfie, who’s newly employed at a toy store that Bandit, Bluey, and Bingo visit while shopping for the girls’ cousin Muffin. When Bluey and Bingo refuse to speak after Bandit encourages them to stay silent with a made up game, it’s up to Alfie to help the dad find the right Moonlight Unicorn toy for Muffin. It’s essentially a hilarious game of charades as Bandit’s attempt at a quiet afternoon backfires. Fortunately, Alfie proves himself to be a “rockstar.”\n\n#4: Rose Byrne as Brandy “Onesies”\n\nLeave it to actress Rose Byrne to have us in tears. The “Bridesmaids” star and Australia native was featured in the season 3 episode “Onesies” as Chilli’s older sister, Brandy. The episode had “Bluey” fans talking because of how strange it was to not have met or heard about the character for so long. Of course, that’s part of the plot. Even Bluey asks her mom why they rarely see their Aunt Brandy. Viewers agree that it’s hard not to get emotional when we learn that she likely can’t have kids, especially because of Byrne’s great performance.\n\n#3: Eva Mendes as Yoga Instructor “Born Yesterday”\n\nIf you’re not paying attention, you’ll definitely miss star Eva Mendes’ guest stint. In an episode from the third season titled “Born Yesterday,” you can hear the “Hitch” actress voice a yoga instructor in the video that Chilli is following. It’s a small role, but Mendes jumped at the chance when the show’s producers called. “Bluey” is a favorite for not only her, but for her whole family, which includes husband Ryan Gosling and their daughters. The actress even revealed that they’ve binge-watched the cartoon. Needless to say, her girls loved the cameo. We did too!\n\n#2: Natalie Portman as Whale Documentary Narrator “Whale Watching”\n\nOne of the reasons why parents love “Bluey” is because it's so relatable. And there’s arguably nothing more relatable than not being able to function on New Year’s Day. In season three, Chilli and Bandit are recovering from a wild New Year’s Eve. That doesn’t stop Bluey and Bingo from roping their parents into a whale watching game though. Eventually Chilli needs a break, and puts a whale documentary on TV, with none other than Natalie Portman narrating it. Her voice is incredibly easy to miss. But once you realize it’s the “Black Swan” actress, it’s impossible to un-hear! And her delivery is so soothing we kind of wish this was a real program. Before we unveil our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions. Leigh Sales as Coco’s Mom Bella & Ice Cream Lady, Various Even a Broadcast Journalist Can’t Resist Joining in on the Fun of “Bluey” Layne Beachley as Surfer, “The Beach” Who Better to Voice a Dog with a Passion for Surfing Than a Former Pro Surfer?\n\n#1: Lin-Manuel Miranda as Major Tom “Stories”\n\nFamed songwriter, actor, playwright, and filmmaker Lin-Manuel Miranda has a hilarious appearance as a talking horse named Major Tom in the third season. The “Stories” episode revolves around Indy, as she struggles to make a model horse at school. In an attempt to fix her creation, she and Winton visit Major Tom, a horse that resides nearby. Like many of the other stars on our list, Miranda and his family are huge fans of the show. Still, the “Hamilton” creator reportedly once said he’d “never dare guest star” because he’s not Australian. We’re certainly glad he ended up being wrong on that front. Here’s to dreams coming true!"
