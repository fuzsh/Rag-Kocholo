From his various team- ups with Adam Sandler to Paul Blart: Mall Cop , James hurls himself at the physical shtick and never lets on that he knows he's not making art. In Zookeeper , James and his stunt doubles take a pounding - pratfalls, spills, porcupine pokes. It's a kidfriendly romantic comedy, a Night at the Museum at the zoo. With slapstick and sincerity, James buys into the idea that he's a friend to animals, big and small, and that a guy with his limited prospects and his lineman- gone- toseed physique has a shot - several shots - at a beauty like Leslie Bibb. It's a talking animals comedy, as the hapless Griffin ( James), zookeeper at Franklin Park Zoo, receives advice to the lovelorn from the critters in his charge. The animals have always kept to \" the code,\" enforced by Joe the Lion ( Sylvester Stallone): No talking to humans. But we've seen Griffin flame out with the fair Stephanie ( Bibb). And the animals have heard Griffin go on about this woman for years. Enough is enough. If the friendly zookeeper can't close the deal, the animal kingdom will pitch in and get him up to speed on what they know by instinct - the mating game. Joe the Lion suggests \" cutting her from the herd,\" getting her away from her current boyfriend ( Joe Rogan, an over- the- top boor). Joe's lioness wife ( Cher) talks up the idea of making Stephanie jealous. The bears offer advice on becoming a predator. And \" Lead with your puddin' cup,\" Jerome and Bruce ( Jon Favreau and Faizon Love) declare. Yeah, it means what you think it does. The capuchin monkey ( Adam Sandler, doing a very funny voice) is lost in reveries about having a thumb. \" I've been blessed.\" And the elephant ( Judd Apatow) has the same solution for any awkward moment - \" Flee. Fleeing is the new fighting.\" All along, Griffin can't see how sweet and seemingly available the zoo's eagle expert and vet ( Rosario Dawson) is. She's into guys who are into animals. \" You're like the frickin' hippo whisperer,\" she cracks. Director Frank Coraci, a veteran of Adam Sandler's comic style ( The Waterboy ), is more at home with the slapstick than the would- be romance or the movie's darker subtext. Bernie ( Nick Nolte), a forlorn gorilla, has long been kept in a cave so he can't repeat his attack on a cruel zookeeper ( Donnie Wahlberg). The film's silliest scenes involve Griffin dragging Bernie along to Bernie's dream eatery - T. G. I. Friday's - where Bernie, supposedly on his way to a costume party, is a hit. The film's mix of digital critters and real animals results in far too many shots of this beast or that one standing alone in the shot, mouth moving, cracking jokes. But the cuddly, ever- put- upon James takes his comic lumps like a man. His Griffin suffers injuries and indignities and lets us laugh at him as he does. No matter where the script wanders and where the direction founders, at some point, James' comic instincts take over. And this time, they don't let him down. - Orlando Sentinel Other voices Selected excerpts from reviews of Zookeeper. Kevin James' average- Joe appeal doesn't go very far in a film that's noticeably low on charm or playfulness. - Tim Greirson, Screen International The team of five writers, including James, simply fails to provide a narrative that would make us care about what happens next. - John Hartl, Seattle Times James hurls himself into this sad scenario with energy and teddy- bear charm that makes him impossible to hate. But it's easy to hate Zookeeper . If we could talk to the animals, they'd probably hate it, too. - David Germain, The Associated Press It's stupid, then it veers toward the absurd, but with James at its centre it remains sort of sweet throughout. You can't hate James or the movie; both are sort of dopey but well- meaning. - Bill Godykoontz, Arizona Republic Zookeeper is essentially a surreally awful Happy Madison Productions version of Mad Libs. - Simon Abrams, Slant magazine Zookeeper is a surprisingly good time at the movies, or maybe it's just too hot outside for anything in air- conditioning to disappoint... It isn't just the heat; it's the film's amiable stupidity. - Steve Persall, St. Petersburg Times - Compiled by Shane Minkin By Roger Moore Amiable riff on Dr. Doolittle needs to do more Movie Review Zookeeper .
