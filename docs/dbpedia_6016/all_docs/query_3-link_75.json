        "text": "Where to start?\n\nObviously everything in the trailer for Zookeeper is incredibly bad, which obviously means itâll be a big hit. But even for bad movies starring horrible untalents like Kevin James, the Zookeeper trailer is especially shitty. And it doesnât even feature a fart joke (although you know thereâs going to be one in the film). Also, this is the kind of movie where the awful âlessonâ at the end is telegraphed from the beginning of the trailer - James will realize that heâs a hugely obese ugly person and is lucky to be with ANYBODY. Oh, wait - heâll learn that Leslie Bibbâs character is really shallow and a cunt, and heâll end up with Rosario Dawson, who loves him for whatâs inside of him (which appears to be a case of Ben & Jerrys)."
