        "text": "NEVER work with animals? Comic actor Kevin James clearly wasn’t listening to the old adage when he penned himself the lead role in new movie Zookeeper.\n\nThe father-of-three produced, co-wrote and stars in the comedy film about miserably single, zookeeper Griffin, who decides to take dating advice from the animals in his care.\n\nAll the animals are played by real-life creatures, with the exception of the animatronic moody gorilla, Bernie.\n\n“I knew what I was getting into,” says 46-year-old James, with a knowing smile.\n\n“We wanted a natural environment for these animals, and then we could write towards them. When you try to get the animals to do something, that’s where it gets tricky.”\n\nWhile James, who rose to fame starring alongside Will Smith in 2005’s Hitch, may be acting his funny socks off, he’s got stiff competition. In particular from Donald the Capuchin monkey, voiced by Adam Sandler. Janet the Lioness is also voiced by Cher and Sylvester Stallone is the voice of Joe the lion.\n\nJames also enjoyed screen time with an elephant named Rosie, but admits he drew the line at working with the bigger beasts.\n\n“The wolf was a little scary. And they tried to talk me into going in with the bears, but I was smarter than that,” he says.\n\n“Working with Rosie was really good. She would clean me every once in a while. Out of nowhere, blow whatever was in her trunk all over me. I think it was cleaning, I don’t know...”\n\nBernie the gorilla is voiced by Nick Nolte and James jokes: “This is my first buddy comedy in which my buddy outweighs me, so that makes me feel very happy.”\n\nThe King Of Queens sitcom actor will next be seen playing a teacher moonlighting as a mixed martial arts fighter in Here Comes The Boom, the third film role he’s penned for himself.\n\n“More and more I’m getting to do the kind of movies I want to do,” he says. “I don’t want to make movies just for kids, where the adults can check out and go to sleep. I want to make movies everybody can enjoy.\n\n“Adults will love the animal interaction in Zookeeper. It’s not just kiddie humour, it’s got everything.”"
