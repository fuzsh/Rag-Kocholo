        "text": "The Nephew of the Zookeeper (also known as Zookeeper 2 on DVD) is a American animated family television film, starring the voices of Grant Palmer, Kevin James, Rosario Dawson & Ryan Stiles. It is the sequel to 2011 film Zookeeper (2011). A year after Griffin and Kate got married, Griffin's 14 year old nephew Mason comes to visit him for the whole Summer, and Griffin has just ordered a new animal to the zoo. Meanwhile, however, a business man wants to destroy Franklin Park Zoo to make room for a factory to serve meat from animals. Unlike its predecessor, it received some mixed reviews, about 146 (96 positives & 50 negatives).\n\nKevin James, Adam Sandler & Rosario Dawson are the only actors to reprise their roles, as the rest of the cast didn't participated.\n\nPlot[]\n\nTBA\n\nCast[]\n\nHumans[]\n\nMason Keyes (voiced by Grant Palmer) The 14 year old teenager, and the nephew of Griffin.

That was involved in Brazilian Portuguese, Dutch, French (France), Italian, Korean, & Spanish (Venezuela/Miami/Spain).\n\nIn both Dutch dubs, Bas Rutten, who originally voices Sebastian the wolf in the original movie, provided Sebastian's voice in this dub.\n\nTranscripts[]\n\nThe Nephew of the Zookeeper (2015)/Transcript\n\nThe Nephew of the Zookeeper (2015)/Trailers\n\nRelease[]\n\nTV/Theatrical[]\n\nDVD release[]\n\nHome Media[]\n\nThe Nephew of the Zookeeper (2015)/Home media\n\nReception[]\n\nOther Languages[]"
