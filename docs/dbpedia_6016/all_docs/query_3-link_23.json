        "text": "Just like the animals who make up most of the cast of “Zookeeper,” Kevin James leaves his mark all over the film. He co-wrote it, co-produced it, and stars in it as Griffin Keyes, the guy who runs the show at the nonfictional Franklin Park Zoo in Boston.\n\nGriffin is loved by all, from his co-workers to the creatures, large and small, that populate the place. The only one he’s not feeling the love from is his girlfriend (Leslie Bibb), who’s disappointed that he’s just a zookeeper.\n\nOpening Friday, the film’s central plot, which relies on talking animals, has the zoo residents giving Griffin some life lessons in how to get the girl.\n\nIt was a story idea that initially didn’t interest James, who’s become a regular fixture in Boston, starring in “Paul Blart: Mall Cop” here a couple of years ago, and just wrapping “Here Comes the Boom,” much of it shot in Quincy, Mass., for release next year.\n\n“I was immediately not into doing an animal movie when it was brought to me,” said James earlier this week in New York. “It felt so goofy to me. But then I started thinking, if we had a great story where you didn’t need animals, where animals were just kind of buddies and you could put them in later and they would add to the film, then I started getting more interested in it. I wanted them to be your buddies that just happened to be bears and lions.”\n\nThat’s when he became involved in the writing, always keeping two goals in mind: some semblance of reality about animal behavior, and aiming at a wide audience.\n\n“We wanted it to be a funny movie for everybody,” he said. “I have kids, and I want to be able to bring them to movies. But I’ve been to so many movies with my kids where I’ve just been bored out of my skull sometimes because there wasn’t anything for adults. It’s a tough world to live in because you don’t want be where it’s too ‘kiddy’ for me. So I try to bump it up where everybody can enjoy it. That’s the trick of it.”\n\nOf his own proclivity for pratfalls – and there are plenty of them here – he said, “I’ve always loved physical comedy. I love Jackie Gleason, or anybody who was kind of big and could move. So I kind of follow that.”\n\nIn a story where zoo animals provide the voice of reason for a guy who’s confused about love, James and his co-writers first took a look at how animals actually behave.\n\n“We were thinking that animals act on instinct, and in some ways it works a lot better,” he said. “Animals don’t play games. They don’t pretend to be something they’re not. They just go out and do it. It either happens or it doesn’t happen or you get killed or eaten. Whatever happens is just natural. And that’s the way I’m operating my life from now on. I’m even throwing poop.”\n\nOf course, working with real animals presents a special set of challenges. There was no problem with the monkey or the giraffe or the ostrich. But there was also a wolf, along with a pair each of lions and bears.\n\n“The lions and bears were on set with us,” said James, “and the bears were sometimes close to us. So all I would do is just plan my escape route. I would [be ready to] push the cameraman in the way and I’d be back in my trailer watching ‘SportsCenter.’ I was OK with the wolf, but it was scary at times.”\n\nThe entire animal cast was real, with the exception of the animatronic gorilla voiced by Nick Nolte. That part called for too much emotion, and a reliance on specific facial expressions.\n\nJames is still enthusiastic about the success they had with the unpredictability of the real things.\n\n“That’s why we didn’t want any CG animals,” he said. “It was a great environment. We weren’t asking them to do crazy things. We didn’t want it to be jokey where the elephant does a funny move and stands on his hands. We just wanted it natural. But if they did some spontaneous move – like when the bear dropped to his back and started scratching – I wanted to write to that, and we did, and we put that the movie.”\n\nWhile “Zookeeper” stands on its own as a cute and funny and crazy comedy, it’s also got a message about staying true to yourself and doing what you love. James made sure that part of it was always up front.\n\n“I can’t speak for everybody else, but I’ve tried in the past being someone I’m not to impress somebody and try to be who I think they want me to be,” he admitted. “Ultimately it ends up being a mistake, and you find out who you really are and you find someone who loves you for that. So the movie is about being yourself. And if that doesn’t work, throw poop at ’em.”\n\nThe Patriot Ledger"
