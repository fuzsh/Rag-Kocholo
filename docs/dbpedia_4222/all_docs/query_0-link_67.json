Rear Admiral Fletcher detaches three of his four destroyers to look for downed TBD (VT 5) reported in the water astern of TF 17. During the search, a Japanese reconnaissance flying boat (Yokohama Kokutai) attacks (but does not damage) destroyer Sims (DD-409). Soon thereafter, two F4Fs (VF 42) splash the flying boat. The TBD crew, however, is never found in the prevailing poor weather.\n\nMotor torpedo boats and USAAF P-40s repulse Japanese landing attempt on southwest Bataan.

By the time R-5 has reloaded, the enemy is gone. While R-5's captain is criticized for erring in judgment for failing to follow up his contact during darkness and continuing the attack, his inexperience (R-5 is his first command) is considered, as is the fact that it is that commanding officer's first war patrol. R-5's quarry may have been U-564, which sinks Canadian motor tanker Victolite at 36°12'N, 67°14'W the same day.\n\nFebruary 11, Wed.\n\nPacific\n\nSubmarine Shark (SS-174) is sunk by Japanese destroyer Yamakaze about 120 miles east of Menado, Celebes, 01°45'N, 127°15'E.

Doorman, RNN) is attacked by Japanese naval land attack planes (Genzan, Mihoro, and Kanoya Kokutais) as well as carrier attack planes from carrier Ryujo. Australian light cruiser HMAS Hobart is straddled, while near misses damage U.S. destroyers Barker (DD-213) and Bulmer (DD-222), which will need to retire to Australia for repairs.\n\nU.S. Army transport Meigs, U.S. freighters Mauna Loa and Portmar, and Australian coaster Tulagi, escorted by heavy cruiser Houston (CA-30), destroyer Peary (DD-226) and Australian corvettes HMAS Swan and HMAS Warrego sails from Darwin, Australia, for Timor (see 16 and 19 February).\n\nAtlantic\n\nBrazilian steamship Buarque is torpedoed and sunk by German submarine U-432 30 miles southwest of Cape Henry, 36°35'N, 75°20'W (see 16 February).\n\nU.S. tanker Point Breeze suffers explosion in engine room that damages steering gear, forcing the ship to go around off Throggs Neck, New York; one man is killed and one is blown overboard. Point Breeze later floats free and is towed to New York for repairs.\n\nFebruary 16, Mon.\n\nCaribbean\n\nOperation NEULAND begins with simultaneous attacks on Dutch and Venezuelan oil ports to disrupt production and flow of petroleum products vital to the Allied war effort; German submarine U-156 shells refinery on Aruba, N.W.I. and torpedoes and damages U.S. tanker Arkansas as she lies alongside Eagle Dock; a second torpedo misses the ship and runs up on the beach. There are no casualties among the 37-man crew. The enemy does not emerge from the action unscathed, however, for the explosion of a shell prematurely in a gun barrel injures two men on board U-156, which will receive permission to put in to Martinique (see 20-21 February).\n\nAtlantic\n\nUnarmed U.S. tanker E.H.

On board the latter, one crewman is killed; of the 500 troops embarked, one is killed and 18 wounded. Houston's heavy antiaircraft fire saves the convoy from destruction, but the imminent fall of Timor results in the recall of the convoy and its routing back to Darwin (see 19 February).\n\nFebruary 17, Tue.\n\nPacific\n\nSeabees (First Naval Construction Battalion) arrive at Bora Bora, Society Islands.\n\nSubmarine Triton (SS-201) torpedoes and sinks Japanese gunboat No. 5 Shin'yo Maru off Nagasaki, Japan, 32°14'N, 127°14'E.\n\nJapanese destroyer Ayanami is damaged when she fouls an uncharted reef 2.4 nautical miles off Durai, Anambas Islands.\n\nAtlantic\n\nCoastal minesweeper Detector (AMc-75) is accidentally sunk in collision with U.S. tanker Oswego 300 yards east-northeast of Finn's Ledge Buoy, at the entrance to the north channel at Boston, Massachusetts.

Blum returns to active service.\n\nFebruary 18, Wed.\n\nAtlantic\n\nDestroyer Truxtun (DD-229) and stores issuing ship Pollux (AKS-2) run aground during storm near Placentia Bay, Newfoundland; the former just east of Ferryland Point and the latter off Lawn Point. Minesweeper Brant (AM-24) arrives on scene and contributes rescue parties as well as brings medical officer and corpsmen from destroyer tender and Support Force flagship Prairie (AD-15). The tragedy produces deep admiration for the lifesaving efforts of the local population. \"Hardly a dozen men from both ships would have been saved,\" one observer writes later, \"had it not been for the superb work of the local residents.\" Many men jeopardize their own lives frequently to save the American sailors; several hang by lines over the cliffs to keep survivors from dragging over sharp rocks as they are pulled up from the beach below; others go out in a dory, risking swamping several times in the rough waves; after working all day rescuing Truxtun's people, some of the local inhabitants then toil all night rescuing Pollux's men with a stamina that defies description. Though poor, the men, women, and children of the town of St. Lawrence turn out to outfit the \"survivors with blankets, warm clothes, boots, fed them, cleaned them up as best they could and turned them in their own beds.\" Subsequently, they turn a deaf ear to offers to pay for food and clothing used in succoring the shipwrecked Americans. Destroyer Wilkes (DD-441) also runs aground off Lawn Head, 46°53'N, 55°28'W, but manages to free herself from her predicament and escape the fates of Truxtun and Pollux.\n\nBrazilian tanker Olinda is torpedoed and sunk by German submarine U-432 at 37°30'N, 75°00'W (see 19 February).\n\nCaribbean\n\nU.S. freighter Mokihana is torpedoed by German submarine U-161 while lying at anchor at Port of Spain, Trinidad, 12°55'N, 80°33'E; there are no casualties among the 36-man merchant crew or 9-man Armed Guard.\n\nFebruary 19, Thu.\n\nPacific\n\nJapanese forces land on Bali, N.E.I.\n\nBattle of Badoeng Strait begins as Allied naval force (Rear Admiral Karel W.F.M.

In related actions, U.S. freighter Florence D, under charter to the Army and carrying a cargo of ammunition, rescues eight-man PBY (VP 22) crew (Lieutenant Thomas H. Moorer) off north coast of Australia, near Darwin, and later comes under attack by Japanese carrier aircraft that bomb and sink the ship (one man of Moorer's crew and three of the 37-man ship's complement are killed in action); Australian minesweeper HMAS Warrnambol and mission boat St. Francis rescue the survivors. Japanese carrier planes also bomb and sink Philippine motorship Don Isidro (chartered by the U.S. Army to run supplies to Corregidor) off northwest coast of Bathurst Island, 11°00'S, 130°00'E; 11 of the 67-man crew and one of the 16 embarked soldiers are killed. HMAS Warrnambol rescues the surviving crew and passengers.
