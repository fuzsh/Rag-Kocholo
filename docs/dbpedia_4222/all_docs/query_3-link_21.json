        "text": "According to Brazilian health officials, a 28 year old woman miraculously survived a horrific injury after her husband accidentally shot her in the mouth with a harpoon.\n\nThe harpoon entered through her mouth, penetrating through to the back of her neck (cervical spine). The womanâ€™s husband was apparently cleaning the spear gun when it accidentally misfired.\n\nShe was rushed to a nearby hospital where she underwent emergency surgery, and is currently under observation.\n\nAccording to preliminary reports from her neurosurgeon, she had a tracheostomy placed for breathing, and has some degree of weakness on the right side of her body.\n\nThis is not the first harpoon incident in Brazil this year. Last month, Bruno Barcellos de Souza Coutinho was cleaning his spear gun when it also misfired, penetrating his skull through his orbit or eye socket. He arrived to the hospital alert and awake, underwent emergency surgery where he had the weapon removed without any subsequent neurologic sequelae. In his case, the harpoon was millimeters away from vital arteries and nerves.\n\nPenetrating injuries to the neck, mouth and base of the skull are particularly dangerous and potentially lethal.\n\nThe angle, depth and position of the harpoon were important factors which ultimately determined the outcome in this woman.\n\nOf the three specific zones of the neck, penetrating injuries to so-called \"Zone 2\" (extending from the angle of Jaw to the cricoid cartilage or \"adams apple\") leave patients at risk for injuries to their airway or trachea, esophagus, carotid and vertebral arteries, as well as the spinal cord.\n\nIn the ER, it is important not to remove the impaled harpoon- this should be done in the operating room (OR) under controlled conditions to secure the airway (with surgical maneuvers) and control bleeding.\n\nEstablishing a stable airway and controlling any bleeding are immediate priorities in stabilizing a patient with such an injury.\n\nPerforming a cricothyrotomy, or a tracheostomy, would likely be necessary in the setting of such penetrating trauma.\n\nInjury to the spinal cord would be a concern after stabilizing the airway, and addressing bleeding concerns.\n\nAccording to initial reports from the treating neurosurgeon, the harpoon apparently penetrated an area between an upper vertebral body and the spinal cord.\n\nThe harpoon was apparently quite close to the carotid artery, a vital artery that supplies blood to the brain. Interruption of this blood vessel can lead to death or a stroke, depending on severity of the injury.\n\nCervical injuries to the spinal cord typically result in partial or complete quadriplegia. However, depending on the specific location and severity of trauma, limited function may be possible.\n\nInjuries at C1-C2 levels typically result in loss of breathing requiring a ventilator to support breathing, or pacing of the phrenic nerve is some cases.\n\nInjuries to C3 vertebra and above typically affect the function of the diaphragm, requiring a ventilator to support breathing.\n\nInjuries at C4 affect the function of the shoulder and biceps, while injuries at C5 lead to loss of function of the wrists, hands, biceps and shoulders.\n\nIt's also possible that this patient may have suffered a so-called \"Brown-Sequard Syndrome\", a partial transection of the spinal cord as a result of a penetrating harpoon injury, which can lead to paralysis on one side of the body as well as loss of sensation, along with loss of sensation of pain and temperature on the opposite side of the body.\n\nAs she wakes up, it will become more clear as to what exact injuries she sustained. In any event her survival is attributed to the fact that the harpoon missed her carotid artery.\n\nShe may have some residual neurologic deficits from injuries to other blood vessels which supply the spinal cord, as well as trauma to other areas of the spinal cord itself.\n\nIt does not appear that nerves to the diaphragm, which support breathing, were involved at this time, based upon early reports."
