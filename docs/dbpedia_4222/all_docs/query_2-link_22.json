        "text": "Background\n\nAfter the First World War (1914-18) and the economic crises of the 1920s, aggressive nationalism began to emerge in Europe. Keen to reverse the terms of the Treaty of Versailles (1919) and reassert its dominance of Europe, Germany annexed Austria and parts of Czechoslovakia in 1938.\n\nEconomic turmoil had also brought about militaristic movements in the Japanese Empire. Seeking influence and resources, Japan launched an invasion of China in 1937.\n\nThe war expands\n\nIn July 1941, the Japanese sent troops to South-East Asia. This threatened British interests in the area and prompted the United States and Britain to establish an oil embargo against Japan. In retaliation, the Japanese launched a devastating attack on the US Navy’s Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, drawing the United States into the war.\n\nIn the days that followed, the Japanese invaded European colonies across eastern Asia, including the British territories of Hong Kong, Malaya, Singapore and Burma. Their aim was to create a fortified perimeter around a self-sufficient Japan, which could then be defended until the Allies tired of the war.\n\nThe Allies move against Italy\n\nIn May 1943, the Allies secured victory in North Africa. Their armies advanced from east and west, linking up near Tunis and prompting 250,000 German and Italian troops to surrender.\n\nThe Allies next set their sights on clearing the Axis powers from Europe. The invasion of Sicily took place in July 1943, leading to the arrest and expulsion of the Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini later that month. This victory prompted Italy to surrender. An armistice was signed on 3 September, but fighting in the country continued.\n\nThe Allied invasion of Europe\n\nThe Allies launched the amphibious invasion of Europe on 6 June 1944 in Normandy. They also landed in southern France in August. These operations coincided with a huge Red Army offensive in Eastern Europe that dealt a crushing blow to the Germans.\n\nVictory in Europe\n\nThe Allies pushed into western Germany in February 1945. On 25 April, the Red Army entered Berlin. Five days later, Adolf Hitler committed suicide and the Soviets captured the German parliament building, the Reichstag. After another Allied breakthrough in Italy, German forces there surrendered on 2 May.\n\nVictory in Europe was declared for the Allies on 8 May 1945, following Germany’s unconditional surrender. This led to the occupation and division of Germany."
