        "text": "You've heard of the wreck of the Hesperus\n\nAnd similar tales of the sea -\n\nLike the boy who stood on the burning deck\n\nwith his trousers as burnt as could be.\n\nBut what of H.M.S. \"Partridge\"\n\nAnd the stirring tale she has to tell\n\nOf defying the mighty \"Wbp\" navy\n\nAnd seeing Adolf Luftwaffe to hell.\n\nThey did their best to sink her.\n\nOf that there is no doubt -\n\nBut somehow they just couldn't manage\n\nTo put her out for the count.\n\nThey tried it with \"Stukas\" and \"Junkers\" –\n\nIn fact, planes of every type,\n\ndropping mines and bombs and torpedoes\n\nIn an effort to finish the fight.\n\nThey tried it with destroyers and cruisers,\n\nFiring eight inch shells by the score,\n\nAnd although they all didn't miss her\n\nShe took 'em, and came up for more.\n\nThey wrecked her torpedo tubes for'ard.\n\nAmidships they set her afire.\n\nThey holed and buckled her deck plates,\n\nBut the \"Partridge\" didn't tire.\n\nHer steering they put out of action\n\nWith a well placed bomb by the stern\n\nSo that she careened around in circles\n\nUnable to straighten the turn.\n\nThey brought down all her main aerials\n\nAnd reduced her speed by knots,\n\nBut she kept her head above water\n\nExchanging shots for shots.\n\nIt was a one-sided scrap most surely\n\nBut they didn't get all their own way –\n\nShe shot down for certain five aircraft\n\nAnd many got damaged that day.\n\nShe fought her way out of the spot though –\n\nWhich was really no mean feat,\n\nTowered over by Germany's bombers\n\nAnd surrounded by Italy's fleet.\n\nThe B.B.C. news next morning\n\nGave a short account of the fray –\n\nPraising high our wonderful air-force.\n\nTo us - Remarkably absent all day."
