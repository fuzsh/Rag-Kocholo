        "text": "As Canadian soldiers wrapped up their first major combat mission in half a century, nervous relatives breathed a little easier Sunday on the other side of the world.\n\n\"I felt like a million bucks this morning,\" said Kathy Winfield, as she packed a box of goodies to send to her husband, a private, in Afghanistan.\n\n\"I was woken up by the phone. It was Jeff, and just knowing he was OK, and that he sounded excellent, it was a huge relief for me.\"\n\nThe last of about 500 Canadian soldiers returned from a battle zone in eastern Afghanistan on the weekend, after spending five days hunting for al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters holed up in caves.\n\nFROM MARCH 17, 2002: Canadian troops return from front lines\n\nBack in Canada, Operation Harpoon sent a flood of emotions through the ranks of many veterans.\n\nAlmost 50 years ago to the day, for instance, men like Dan Bordeleau were on the front lines in the Korean War. On Sunday, the Alberta man said he still vividly remembers his narrow escape from a battle that killed five of his friends.\n\nBordeleau is also still haunted by the memory of shooting an enemy soldier.\n\n\"Never saw him until he got up on his knees and lit a match to light the fuse,\" the old soldier recounted somberly. \"And he didn't get there.\"\n\nWhile the military mission to Afghanistan has relatives worried and many old vets are proud, some Canadians are not sure Ottawa should have agreed to send men and women into battle.\n\n\"It scares me that they may be in danger, they may get hurt, that they are away from their families,\" said one woman at a hockey game in Ottawa Sunday, where the Canadian military was honoured at centre ice.\n\nAs the soldiers in Afghanistan prepare to go on more missions, peace activists back home are lobbying against U.S. plans to expand the campaign against terrorism to other countries, such as Iraq.\n\n\"I think it's important that the federal cabinet be quite firm in that we are supporting only the role in Afghanistan,\" said Mary Kehoe of Project Ploughshares. \"There is no justification for widening it to other countries.\""
