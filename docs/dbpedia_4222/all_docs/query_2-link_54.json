        "text": "Transcript\n\nNARRATOR: Summer 1942 - just one year after the invasion of the Soviet Union, Hitler orders an offensive against the large city on the Volga that bears Stalin's name. In early August, Wehrmacht troops advance to the city limits of Stalingrad.\n\nGERHARD DENGLER: \"We thought that if we could cut off Stalingrad and with that the Volga, the war would be as good as over.\"\n\nNARRATOR: Day after day, the German bombers attack. The city looks increasingly like a wasteland. In mid-September 1942, German soldiers enter Stalingrad. Many believe the enemy is almost defeated, that it's only a matter of crushing the last pockets of resistance. But the Soviet dictator is determined. The city will not be taken. Stalingrad is turned into a fortress. Even civilians pitch in.\n\nRAISSA GALTSCHENKO: \"There was an appeal to the soldiers: There is no more land for us beyond the Volga. We knew what we were defending, our homeland and, most of all, our city.\"\n\nNARRATOR: There is bitter fighting among the ruins, street by street, house by house. Sometimes only floors separate the enemies. The hand-to-hand combat is savage. It lasts for weeks.\n\nGÜNTER SCHRÖDER: \"When the Russians suddenly charged in, we could do only one thing: pull out our spades and strike at them from below and hit the main artery below the head.\"\n\nNARRATOR: The brutal battle now takes a daily toll of thousands of German and Soviet soldiers. By early November, the temperatures in Stalingrad drop to -18 degrees. The Volga freezes over. In the snowy steppes not far from the city, Red Army troops are gathering. Over a million soldiers stand at the ready, with orders to besiege the enemy. On November 19, 1942, they attack. The Germans have little to oppose such an overwhelming force. Within three days, the troops of the 6th Army are surrounded. Close to 300,000 German and allied soldiers are now under siege in Stalingrad.\n\nHANS-ERDMANN SCHÖNBECK: \"We feared that they would do to us what we had already done to hundreds of thousands of Russians. By then, there was no hope of mercy on either side. We knew what would happen to us.\"\n\nNARRATOR: For Hitler, the Battle for Stalingrad is also a matter of pride. The 6th Army wants to capitulate. But he refuses. Leaving his soldiers to their fate. Thousands of lives are lost not only in combat, but also to hunger and cold.\n\nGERHARD MÜNCH: \"Thousands of soldiers lay unburied in the snow, thousands upon thousands. The road led through them, the wind swept over them. It breaks something inside you, that can never be healed.\"\n\nNARRATOR: On February 2, 1943, the 6th Army surrenders against Hitler's will. For the Soviet Army, the first great triumph at a huge cost. Half a million Soviet soldiers die. Of the 300,000 German soldiers under siege, only one in three survives to face years of imprisonment. Only 6,000 German soldiers who fight in Stalingrad to the bitter end ever return home."
