        "text": "Post by emron on\n\n13 April 1924\n\nCaptain Isoroku Yamamoto was a member of the Japanese delegation to the United States. Amongst other places visited was the United States Naval War College.\n\n13 April 1943\n\nAt Rabaul, New Britain, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto played a game of Shogi with Vice Admiral Ryunosuke Kusaka and discussed Pacific War strategy. He spoke of his intention to personally inspect forward bases to raise morale, a decision which lead to his death over Bouganville 5 days later.\n\nPost by emron on\n\n14 April 1945\n\nSimple funeral held for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt at the White House, Washington D.C. followed by military procession and burial at Hyde Park, New York.\n\nHaving been paralysed from the waist down since contracting polio in 1921 and by then in declining health, Roosevelt passed away suddenly after suffering a cerebral haemorrhage on 12 April while at his retreat in the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia.\n\nOnly 11 weeks into his fourth term and less than a month before war ended in Europe he was aged 63. Succeeded by Harry S. Truman who was sworn in shortly after the death.\n\nPost by emron on\n\n14 April 1942\n\nAdmiral Chester Nimitz orders carrier USS Yorktown to proceed to Tonga under urgency.\n\nInformation obtained from IJN coded messages, freshly intercepted and deciphered by the allies, warned of a major build up of Japanese naval power in the Southwest Pacific, with a carrier fleet already en route from Formosa via Truk Atoll. The likely target of this aggression was Port Moresby, New Guinea. Nimitz also directed carrier USS Lexington, already in the area, to rendezvous with Yorktown in preparation to stop the Japanese advance. Less than a month later both sides would sustain heavy losses in action when they met during the Battle of Coral Sea.\n\nPost by emron on\n\n15 April 1942\n\nSecret mission underway in North Pacific.\n\nThe imminent threat to our region was considered so serious that all four US carriers of the Pacific fleet would be requisitioned for it's defence. However both USS Hornet and USS Enterprise were presently committed to another task. They were sailing under radio silence together with their escort of 4 cruisers, 8 destroyers and 2 oilers and on course approaching Japan from the east. The plan was to launch a flight of B25 bombers from the deck of Hornet, once within range of Tokyo and other cities. This attack was scheduled for the following Saturday, April 18.\n\nPost by emron on\n\n16 April 1942\n\nThe Japanese Navy issued Order No.18 for the capture of Midway and Aleutian Islands.\n\nThe provocative Doolittle Raid on main island cities of Japan only 2 days later would have emphasised the strategic importance of Midway Atoll and it's priority in the IJN leadership's immediate plans.\n\nInterrupted by the Battle of the Coral Sea, the operation against Midway commenced when a massive invasion fleet was assembled and sailed from Japan on May-29.\n\nPost by emron on\n\n20 April 1889\n\nAdolf Hitler born in Austria-Hungary.\n\n20 April 1942\n\nBritish, Indian and Burmese troops under command of Lieutenant General Slim together with Chinese Army Division forced to withdraw during Battle of Yenangyaung in Central Burma, following an unsuccessful counterattack against advancing Japanese Army. Before departing north to Mandalay, oilfields and bulk storage was set on fire and refinery and power station destroyed to prevent capture by enemy. By end of May Allied troops would have retreated north into India and China.\n\n20 April 1944\n\nJapanese siege of Kohima, Manipur State, northeast India is about to be lifted by attacking Allied forces. They would continue on to recapture Imphal to the south and force the Japanese to retreat out of India.\n\nPost by emron on\n\nI am appreciating these posts Ron, keep them coming.\n\nDave, thanks for the support. I started this thread with the intention to chronicle the events unfolding 75 years ago and particularly in the Pacific region. I'll stick to reporting briefly with historical facts and hope to remain free of any copyright issues, though I haven't creditted or sought permission from my sources. Please let me know if you have concerns about that approach.\n\nTime permits me to only cover a small part of the 1942 timeline so feel free to add notable events happening in other theatres, as well as those from 25 years earlier in the Great War.\n\nPost by emron on\n\nANZAC Day 1942\n\nUnlike in Australia where only religious services were allowed, daytime parades were held in New Zealand as usual. However dawn parades were cancelled due to wartime constraints and those on urgent defence construction remained at work on the day. It must have been hard on those attending to equally remember the fallen of the Great War as well as the casualties of the current conflict. In the previous 12 months too many of their loved ones were killed, wounded, taken prisoner or missing while serving in places like Crete, North Africa, at sea in the Atlantic or in the skies over Europe and more recently Singapore, Philippines and Java. Their thoughts would have also been with the many overseas, still on service and in danger. They would have also shared concerns for their own safety, because the enemy was encroaching on our region and overwhelming any opposition on the way.\n\n25 April 1942\n\nJapanese bombers carried out raids on airfields around Darwin\n\nIJN carriers Shokaku and Zuikaku arrived at Truk in preparation for the invasion of Port Moresby and Tulagi, Solomon Islands.\n\nUS and Filipino troops were under siege at Corregidor Island, Luzon , providing the last resistance in the Philippines.\n\nJapanese forces were advancing on Mandalay and allied Generals were planning for an orderly and rapid withdrawal out of Burma.\n\nPost by emron on\n\n28 April 1945\n\nWhile Adolf Hitler was tucked up in the Fuhrerbunker the Red Army had entered Berlin and was closing in. But 3 years earlier it was a completely different situation.-\n\n28 April 1942\n\nThe Russian forces were struggling to hold the Axis Armies back and heavily reliant on resupply by Arctic convoys to Murmansk. Leningrad in the north was under siege as was Sevastapol in the south. The Germans had broken out from encirclement at Kholm not far from Moscow. Improving weather would soon allow the offensive to resume and with the deadliest of battles still to come.\n\nPost by emron on\n\n29 April 1945\n\nThe bodies of Benito Mussolini and Clara Petacci were taken to Milan following their execution by partisans the previous day.\n\n29 April 1942\n\nJapanese Special Naval Landing Force departed Rabaul, New Britain aboard transports for the invasion of the RAAF seaplane base at Tulagi, Solomon Islands.\n\nAs promised by President Roosevelt in March, Admiral Ernest King established the South Pacific Amphibious Force composed primarily of the 1st Marine Division. It's first contingent would embark aboard USS Wakefield on 19 May 1942 sailing to Wellington, New Zealand.\n\nPost by emron on\n\n30 April 1945\n\nAdolf Hitler and Eva Braun commit suicide in the Fuhrerbunker, Berlin. The Third Reich is almost over.\n\n30 April 1942\n\nAdmiral Nimitz issues orders that directed two carriers and their supporting warships towards the Coral Sea. Task Force 17 consisting of the carrier Yorktown, escorted by three cruisers and four destroyers, supported by a replenishment group of two oilers and two destroyers had already departed Tongatapu on 27 April. TF 11 consisting of the carrier Lexington with two cruisers and five destroyers, was between Fiji and New Caledonia. TF 44 en route from Sydney and Nouméa, was a joint Australia–U.S. warship force made up of the cruisers HMAS Australia, HMAS Hobart and USS Chicago along with three destroyers."
