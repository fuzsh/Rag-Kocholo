        "text": "This page is YOUR \"Warships Damage\" page.\n\nYou can “contribute” to my blog by adding +/- modern* warships (late 1960's-present) damage data (warships name/class, date, number & kind of hits substained, damage levels).\n\n* +/- modern warships damage =\n\nAircraft-carrier: Post-1948 design (ie. Forrestal & followers...).\n\nCruisers/Destroyers/Frigates: Post-1956 design (ie.Full missiles systems integrated into a warship...).\n\nSmall warships/Fast Attack Crafts: Post-late 1960's design's (ie.Full missiles systems used).\n\nLarge Amphibious: Post 1956 design (ie. 20+ knots ships, from wartime LSD replacement...).\n\nThese figures allow us to see the current (and future ?) capability for a +/- modern warships design to withstand multiple hits…Don’t hesitate to help me by put your information ! (I valid comments whenever I can, usually every one or two days). Obviously only Warships Damage Data...\n\nAircrafts-Carriers:\n\nUS, 80 000+ tons nuclear powered large carrier, late 1950’s/early 1960’s design:\n\n- USS Enterprise : (accidental war-damage):\n\nDamaged on 14 January 1969 by fire/explosions on aft flight deck (bombs/ammunitions/Jets-fuel/rockets) due to a Mk-32 Zuni rocket initiated (rocket loaded on a parked F-4 Phantom exploded due to ordnance cook off after being overheated by an aircraft start unit mounted to a tow tractor). The explosion set off fires and additional explosions across the flight deck. The fires were brought under control relatively quickly (when compared with previous carrier flight deck fires) but the resulting damage forced Enterprise to put in for repairs, primarily to repair the flight deck's armored plating. 27 killed, 314 injured, 15 aircrafts destroyed, damage repairs completed in 2 months.\n\nUS, 60 000 tons conventionnal powered large carrier, early 1960’s design:\n\n- USS America CVA-66 (used as a target):\n\nSunk in a controlling scuttling on 14 may 2005 after substained 2+ weeks of intensive explosives trials (multiples underwater/surface explosions to simulate advanced-torpedoes/limpet-mine/suicides-crafts/missiles impact's).\n\nUS, 60 000 tons conventionnal powered large carrier, early 1950’s design:\n\n- USS Forrestall CV-59 (accidental war-damage):\n\nDamaged on 29 July 1967 by fire/explosions (rockets, ammunitions, jets-fuel, bombs) due to a accidentally fired Mk-32 Zuni rocket mounted on a F-4 Phantom II. Aft flight deck holed by nine 454kg bombs detonations. Damage repairs full completed by april 19­68. 134 killed, 161 injured. 21 aircrafts destroyers or damaged beyond repairs.\n\nHelico-Carrier/Amphibious LHD-LPH:\n\nUS, 40 000 tons, late 1960’s LHA design:\n\n- USS Belleau Wood LHA-3 (used as a target):\n\nSunk 13 july 2006 by controlled scuttling after being hits by Harpoons missiles and 5’’ shells from US cruiser USS Mobile Bay (CG-53).\n\nUS, 11/18 000 tons, late 1950’s/early 1960’s LPH design:\n\n- USS Guan LPH-9 (used as a target): Sunk 16 or 25 ? October 2001 by several small missiles (maverick,hellfire), bombs, Harpoons SSM launched from aircrafts/helico from US Carrier John F Kennedy (CV 67) airwings.\n\n- USS Okinawa LPH-3 (used as a target):\n\nSunk 06 june 2002 by 1 (or 2 ?) torpedo (likely MK-48) launched from USS Portsmouth (SSN 707).\n\n- USS New Orleans LPH-11(used as a target):\n\nSunk 10 july 2010 by 7 Harpoons SSM, one 227 kg bomb, several 5’’ shells.\n\n- USS Tripoli LPH 10 (war-damage):\n\n18 February 1991, hit by a iraki mine (likely a italian made) on her starboard bow. The explosion ripped a 16 by 20ft hole in the ship's hull and injured 4 sailors. After 20 hours of damage control, the ship was stabilized and was actually ready to resume operations. Tripoli remained on station for 7 days before finally setting course for Al Jubayl to allow HM-14 to crossdeck to the USS New Orleans (LPH-11) and then to Bahrain's Arabian Ship Repair Yard. After 30 days and almost 5 $ million in repairs, Tripoli was able to return to her assigned tasks.\n\n5000/8000 tons Cruisers/Destroyers:\n\nUS, 9000 tons, early 1980’s AAW destroyer design:\n\n- USS Cole DDG 67 (war-damage):\n\nDamaged october 12 2000, hit amid-ship by a suicide crafts (with 400/70 lb warhead, apparently these 200/350 kg warhead was explosives molded into a shaped charge against the hull of the boat). The blast hit the ship's galley (where crew were lining up for lunch). Port hole of 10,6 meters. The crew fought flooding in the engineering spaces and had the damage under control by the evening. Divers inspected the hull and determined the keel was not damaged. 17 killed, 39 injured, repairs lasted 14 months.\n\nUS, 9000 tons, late 1970’s/early 1980’s AAW cruiser design:\n\n- USS Valley Forge CG 50 (used as a target):\n\nSunk november 02 2006 by Missiles and gunfire hits.\n\n- USS Princeton CG 59 (war-damage):\n\nFebruary 18 1991, hit by two Italian made MN 103 Mantra bottom-mounted influence mines (one just under the port rudder and the other just forward of the starboard bow, most likely a sympathetic detonation caused by the first explosion). The blasts cracked the superstructure, buckled three lines in the hull, jammed the port rudder, flooded the #3 switchboard room through chilled water pipe cracks, and damaged the starboard propeller shaft. Two crew members were seriously injured, and another sustained minor injuries. Despite the severe damage, the forward weapons and the AEGIS combat system were back online within 15 minutes. The crippled ship, with a locked starboard propeller shaft and a locked port rudder, was towed away.\n\nUS, 7000 tons, late 1960’s/early 1970’s ASW destroyer design:\n\n- USS Spruance DD-963 (used as a target):\n\nSunk December 07/08 2006 by aircraft launched AGM-84 Harpoons missiles.\n\n- USS Kinkaid DD-965 (used as a target):\n\nSunk July 14 2004 by aircrafts from Carrier Airwing 14 during RIMPAC 2004.\n\n- USS Elliot DD-967 (used as a target):\n\nSunk July 23 2005 during Exercise Talisman Saber.\n\n- USS Peterson DD-969 (used as a target):\n\nSunk February 16 2004 for the DD-21 weapons effects test.\n\n- USS Caron DD-970 (used as a target):\n\nSunk December 04 2002, originally intended to survive these tests (aft stern explosion) and scheduled to be sunk as a target later in 2003, but secondary explosions caused her to sink.\n\n- USS David R Ray DD-971 (used as a target):\n\nSunk July 11 2008 by one Mk-48 mod 7 torpedoes fired from Australian sub HMAS Waller during RIMPAC 2008.\n\n- USS Oldendorf DD-972 (used as a target):\n\nSunk August 25 2005, shelled by many 3” and 5” shells from US frigates/destroyers, maybe finished off by a airstrike ?\n\n- USS John Young DD-973 (used as a target):\n\nSunk April 13 2004 by one Mk-48 torpedoe fired from the US sub SSN 752 Pasadena.\n\n- USS Comte de Grasse DD-974 (used as a target):\n\nSunk June 07 2006, shelled by many 5\" shells.\n\n- USS O’Brien DD-975 (used as a target):\n\nSunk 09 february 2006 by US cruiser Lake Erie (CG-70).\n\n- USS O’Brien DD-975 (used as a target):\n\nSunk February 09 2006, hit by missiles (AGM-84 Harpoons ?) from the Canadian frigate HMCS Vancouver and 2 US aircrafts P-3C Orion.

Initially hit by gunfire (57mm shells/missiles from the Australian frigate HMAS Adelaide), hit by 1 torpedo from the SSN USS Tucson, finished off by a Maverick missile, fired by a fighter from the USS Abraham Lincoln's air wing. Ship sank 90 minutes later, during RIMPAC 2000.\n\n- USS Dale CG 19 (used as a target):\n\nSunk 06 April 06 2000.\n\n- USS Richmond K Turner CG 20 (used as a target):\n\nSunk 09 August 09 1998 by USS Enterprise carrier battle group (including the USS Philippine Sea (CG-58), USS Thorn (DD-988), USS Nicholson (DD-982) and Carrier Air Wing 3), ie= sunk by 5” gunfire, bombs and missiles.\n\n- USS Reeves CG 24 (Accidental-damage):\n\nOctober 30 1989, a F/A-18 Hornet aircraft from the USS Midway mistakenly dropped a 227kg general-purpose bomb on the deck of Reeves during training exercises, creating a 5-foot hole in the bow, sparking small fires, and injuring 5 sailors.\n\n- USS Reeves CG 24 (used as a target):\n\nSunk May 31 2001, hit by bombs from Australian FA/-18 hornet, Missiles from US Navy & Shells from Royal Australian Navy. Finished off by two 227 kg bombs (Mk-82 model) hits that created six foot gaping hole in the starboard side of the hulk.\n\n- USS Belknap CG 26 (used as a target):\n\nSunk September 24 1998.\n\n- USS Wainwright CG 28 (used as a target):\n\nSunk June 11/12 2002, initially hit by 2 AGM-84 Harpoons from the British frigate HMS Richmond. Remaining afloat overnight, hit the next day by a Spearfish torpedo launched by the British SSN sub HMS Tireless, severing the bow. US aircraft then attacked Wainwright before she was scuttled with explosive charges.\n\n- USS William H Standley CG 32 (used as a target):\n\nSunk June 23 2005 during Talisman saber exercise, hit by several MG rounds from helico and multiples 3” or 5” shells.\n\nUK, early 1960's, 4500+ tons AAW destroyer:\n\n- HMS Glamorgan (war-damage):\n\nHit 12 june 1982 by a shore-based MM-38 Exocet missile (removed from the argentinian destroyer ARA Segui). HMS Glamorgan stationed some 18 nautical miles (33 km) off shore. The first attempt to fire a missile failed. A second attempt was successful and a missile was launched, but it failed to find a target. The third attempt at firing was more successful. The incoming Exocet missile was being tracked on both the bridge and operations room radar by the Principal Warfare Officer and Navigation Officer. Before the missile impact, the ship was moving at high speed, executing a turn fast enough to be able to turn rapidly away from the missile in the limited time available, a few seconds; the Exocet struck the port side adjacent to the hangar near the stern. The turn prevented the missile from striking the ship's side at right angles and penetrating; instead it hit the deck coaming at an angle, near to the port Seacat launcher, skidded on the deck and exploded. This made a 10ft by 15ft hole in the hangar deck and a 5ft by 4ft hole in the galley area below, where a fire started. The blast travelled forwards and down. The missile body, still travelling forwards, penetrated the hangar door, causing the fully fuelled and armed Wessex helicopter to explode and start a severe fire in the hangar. Thirteen crew members were killed and more wounded.\n\n- HMS Devonshire (used as a target):\n\nSunk 17 july 1984. Initially damaged by one or several air launched Sea-Eagle missile, finished off by one or two Mk24 mod 2 Tigerfish torpedo launched by the submarine HMS Splendid.\n\nCanadian, 5000 tons, late 1960’s DDH design:\n\n- HMCS Huron (used as a target):\n\nSunk 14 may 2007 during operation TRIDENT FURY. Planned to use a variety of ships/aircraft to bombard Huron with artillery, missiles, strafing fire, and finally be sunk by a torpedo launched from a submarine. Despite being damaged by a Sea Sparrow missile and several other weapons, it was naval gunfire from sister HMCS Algonquin (DDG 283) that was responsible for sinking the hulk of Huron. Ironically, the main gun used by Algonquin was originally installed on Huron, meaning that Huron was sunk by one of its own weapons.\n\n2000/4500 tons Frigates/Destroyers:\n\nUK, 1980's, 4000 tons, ASW frigates:\n\n- HMS Boxer (used as a target):\n\nSunk august 2004.\n\n- HMS Brave (used as a target):\n\nSunk august 2004 by the submarine HMS Sceptre and the frigate HMS Argyll (ie. Likely hit by a least 1 torpedo, missiles and 4,5” shells.\n\nUK, 1970's, 2800+ tons, frigates:\n\n- HMS Antelope (war-loss):\n\nHit 23 may 1982 by two 454Kg bombs (initially not exploding) dropped by Argentine A-4B Skyhawks. One of the bombs was inaccessible because of wreckage; the other had been damaged and was thought to be in a particularly dangerous condition. 3 attempts by the EOD team to withdraw the fuse of this bomb by remote means failed. A fourth attempt, using a small explosive charge, led to the detonation of the weapon, killing/injuring some guy’s of the EOD team. The ship was torn open from water line to funnel, with the blast starting major fires in both engine rooms which spread very quickly. The starboard fire main was fractured, the ship lost all electrical power, and the commanding officer, Commander Nick Tobin, gave the order to abandon ship. Tobin was the last person to leave the ship, and about five minutes after his departure, the missile magazines began exploding. Explosions continued throughout the night, and the following day Antelope was found to be still afloat, but her keel had broken and her superstructure melted into a heap of twisted metal. Antelope broke in half and sank that day.\n\n- HMS Ardent (war-loss):\n\nSunk 21 may 1982 by several 227 or 454kg bombs hits or near-miss during two main attacks: A first attack scored 2 or 3 direct hit (1 or 2 bombs hit aft near stern/hangar, destroying the Lynx helicon and blowing the Sea Cat launcher 80 ft (24 m) into the air before it crashed back down onto the flight deck; The third bomb run through the aft auxiliary machinery room but failed to explode). The aft switchboard was severely damaged, with the consequent loss of power for some key assets, such as the main gun. The hangar was left in flames. Still in full control of her engines and steering, but virtually defenceless. A second attack scored up to 4 direct or near-miss bombs hits in the port quarter (aft). Of these, 1 or 2 bombs failed to explode but penetrated into the ship, and 1 or 2 exploded in the water nearby (ie. near-miss: without doubt adding additional underwater hull damage and flooding in the forward auxiliary machine room). The Dining Hall was shattered, while communications between the bridge and the Ship Control Centre were cut off, and the ship lost steering. This attack caused many casualties, especially among the damage-control teams working in the hangar. Ardent stopped in the shallow waters of Grantham Sound, the fires in her stern now out of control. Ardent continued to burn throughout the night, accompanied by the occasional explosion, until she sank at 6:30 the following morning.\n\nUK, 1970's, 4000 tons, AAW destroyer:\n\n- HMS Sheffield (war-loss):\n\nHit 04 may 1982 by a AM-39 Exocet missile launched by a argentinian aircraft. Missile hit Sheffield amidships, 8 feet above waterline, on deck 02 (a second missile splashed into the sea half a mile off her port beam). The subsonic missile impact create a hole into the side hull. The 165kg missile warhead did not explode, but the missile fuel initiated many fires into the British destroyer (especially in the Engine room). Fire becomes unstoppable. Over the next 6 days (04-10 may), 5 inspections were made to see if any equipment was worth salvaging. Initially, this damaged ship was intended to be towed/grounded to South-Georgia coast but in fact, the wrecked ship was +/- used as a decoy to lure argentinian aircrafts. Infortunatly, heavy-sea/rough-sea growth and waters flow through the hole in the ship’s side and HMS Sheffield finally capsize on may 10 1082.\n\n- HMS Coventry (war-loss):\n\nHit 25 may 1982 by two or three 454 kg bombs just above the water line on the port side. One of the bombs exploded beneath the computer room, destroying it and the nearby operations room, incapacitating almost all senior officers. The other entered the Forward Engine Room, exploding beneath the Junior Ratings Dining Room where the First Aid Party was stationed and the ship immediately began listing to port. The latter hit caused critical damage as it breached the bulkhead between the forward and aft engine rooms, exposing the largest open space in the ship to uncontrollable flooding. Given the design of the ship, with multiple watertight compartments, two hits virtually anywhere else may have been just survivable. Within 20 minutes Coventry had been abandoned and had completely capsized. 19 of her crew were lost and a further 30 injured. Coventry sank shortly after.\n\nUS, 1970/1980's, 3000 tons frigate design:\n\n- USS Samuel B Roberts FFG 58 (war-damage):\n\nApril 14 1988, damaged by a M-08 naval mine that blew a 5 meters hole into the hull. Engine room flooded. and knocked the two gas turbines from their mounts. The blast also broke the keel of the ship; such structural damage is almost always fatal to most vessels. The crew fought fire and flooding for 5 hours and saved the ship. Ship repaired by april 1989.\n\n- USS Stark (war-damage):\n\nStruck on May 17, 1987 by 2 AM-39 Exocet missiles fired from an Iraqi Mirage F1 fighter-bomber. The fighter fired the first Exocet missile from a range of 22.5 nautical miles (41.7 km), and the second from 15.5 nautical miles (28.7 km), at about the time the fighter was given a routine radio warning by the Stark. The frigate did not detect the missiles with radar (No weapons were fired in defense of Stark. The Phalanx CIWS remained in standby mode, Mark 36 SRBOC countermeasures were not armed, and the attacking Exocet missiles and Mirage aircraft were in a blindspot of the defensive STIR (Separate Target Illumination Radar) fire control system, preventing use of the ship's Standard missile defenses. The ship failed to maneuver to bring its weapons batteries to bear prior to the first missile impact). Warning was given by the lookout only moments before the missiles struck. The first penetrated the port-side hull; it failed to detonate, but spewed flaming rocket fuel in its path. The second entered at almost the same point, and left a 3-by-4-meter gash—then exploded in crew quarters. On fire and listing, the frigate was brought under control by its crew during the night. The ship made its way to Bahrain, after temporary repairs to make her seaworthy, she returned to US, under her own power for full repairs. 37 sailors killed and 21 were injured .\n\n900/2000 tons corvettes:\n\nSouth-Korean, 1200 tons, early 1980’s design:\n\n- Chenoan (war-damage):\n\nMarch 26 2010, sunk by one CHT-02D (Chinese/north-korea built) torpedo (250kg warhead) likely launched by a north-Korean midget sub.
