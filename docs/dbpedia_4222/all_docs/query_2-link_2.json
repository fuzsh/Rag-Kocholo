        "text": "A few months before Operation Rutter was supposed to kick off, planners changed the operation to a frontal assault on the town with infantry and tanks. This led to a gradual reduction in resources committed to the mission—the Royal Navy would not commit capital ships for fire support, the paratroopers were replaced by commandos, and the RAF canceled the bomber support, replacing it with dozens of squadrons of single engine fighters. The plan for Operation Rutter continued evolve in this manner until fortune intervened. Set to go at the end of July 1942, a German air raid happened to pass directly over the loaded flotilla. This led the British, concerned that the Germans would anticipate the raid, to cancel Operation Rutter. However, planners soon revived the mission under a new name: Operation Jubilee. The frontal assault was back on.\n\nOf the many late changes to Operation Jubilee, one of the last was the addition of fifty US Army rangers to the attacking force. The First Ranger Battalion was established in early June 1942 under the command of Major William O. Darby. The rangers were modeled after the British Commandos, even undergoing their training in Achnacarry, Scotland. Eager to get Americans “combat” experience, fifty men were selected to be attached to various units in Operation Jubilee. Most arrived weeks before the raid and were spread out in small groups among the commandos, some arrived days before the operation and were simply dropped off with Canadian units and told to participate. These fifty rangers were specially selected to gain combat experience, joining the ill-fated raid as the first US Army soldiers to set foot on occupied Europe.\n\nForty of the Rangers were attached to Number 3 Commando, with the mission to assault German batteries a few miles to the east of Dieppe at the small town of Berneval. Given the closeness of Dieppe from England, Number 3 Commando was transported in small landing craft escorted by motor gun boats. A few of the craft had to turn back due to mechanical difficulties; worse still, the small flotilla ran into a German coastal convoy. After a short firefight broke up the assault force, the landing at Berneval had to be called off.\n\nUnfortunately, five landing craft, carrying about 100 men, never received word of the cancellation. Included in this force were seven rangers under the command of Lt. Edward V. Loustalot from Franklin, Louisiana. The Americans found themselves fighting to exit the beach with their commando brethren. Once atop the cliffs, they were quickly overwhelmed by sheer numbers of German troops and had to withdraw. Raising up to cover men attempting to return to the beach, Lt. Loustalot was cut down by German machine gun fire, becoming the first American killed in action by German forces on the ground in Europe.\n\nIn the confusion of the landings, two other Americans were killed during the raid. Lt. Joseph Randall and T/4 Howard Henry were killed somewhere on the main assault beaches alongside the Canadian units they were attached to. Not much is known about the specifics of their death. They were strangers in units they had been attached to just days prior. In addition, most of the men they interacted with were killed, wounded, or captured during the bloodbath created by German defenses on the main landing beaches. The four rangers assigned to Number 4 Commando were more fortunate. Tasked with attacking batteries to the east of Dieppe near a town called Varengeville, they were able to neutralize the gun batteries and pull most of the force off the beaches."
