        "text": "San Diego and the Navy have supported each other’s interests for more than a century.\n\nThe focal point is San Diego Bay, a once-shallow and dangerous waterway that they transformed into a premier harbor. It’s now home to the nation’s second-largest naval base. Here’s a snapshot of how the city has helped shape the Navy, and vice versa, during wars and peacetime.\n\n1904: The city convinces the Navy to place a coal depot in San Diego Bay to service the small but growing number of warships on the West Coast. It’s the first step in a long-term plan to get the Navy to build infrastructure that would lead to a major base while also transforming a little-known town into the “Gibraltar by the Pacific.”\n\n1906: The Navy modestly expands its presence by placing a wireless radio station on Point Loma. The distance record for wireless transmissions was then 125 miles, a figure that soars to about 500 miles as the Navy connects with a base in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nNavytown: Special report\n\nNavyTown index: The ships of San Diego’s fleet\n\nOverview: SD booming as fleet modernizes\n\nChronology: San Diego’s Navy century\n\nMemories: Navy vets recall dedication, sacrifice at sea\n\nBook excerpt: Cold War subs’ undersea collision\n\n1906: Ellen Browning Scripps donates $50,000 to create a marine biological institution, which evolves into the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla. Scripps becomes a technical partner for the Navy, advising it on everything from how to get troops ashore for the D-Day invasion of World War II to current projects involving undersea gliders.\n\n1908: The city persuades the Navy’s Atlantic fleet — known as the Great White Fleet — to visit San Diego during its historic circumnavigation of the globe. A huge public turnout follows, stoking the budding relationship between the city and the Navy.\n\nThe Navy also notices that modest dredging is under way to enable its larger ships to enter San Diego Bay.\n\n1910: Aviation pioneer Glenn Curtiss opens a flying school on North Island and offers to train the Navy’s first pilot. Only seven years have passed since the Wright brothers made the first flight in a heavier-than-air machine.\n\n1911: Curtiss cozies up to the Navy, guiding his hydroplane next to the cruiser Pennsylvania in San Diego Bay. The plane is hoisted on and off the ship, illustrating its portability. Historians regard it as the birth of naval aviation. The Navy buys planes from Curtiss.\n\n1912: Backed by San Diego’s pro-Navy Chamber of Commerce, insurance salesman William Kettner is elected to Congress and quickly convinces fellow legislators to help pay for the dredging of San Diego Bay.\n\n1912: William Kettner succeeds by getting others to see the strategic value of stationing warships in the harbor.\n\nThe breakthrough is the first of many for Kettner, who becomes known as the “Million Dollar Congressman” for getting Congress and the Navy to invest in San Diego.\n\nKettner’s crowning moment comes in 1919, when Congress approves plans for a naval training station, a naval hospital, a naval repair base and a fleet landing in San Diego.\n\n1914: Civic leaders get the Navy to rename the cruiser California as San Diego, angering leaders in other West Coast cities that were courting the Navy. The cruiser serves as the flagship of the Pacific Fleet, raising San Diego’s visibility.\n\n1915: Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt visits San Diego, where city officials tell him the Navy can get lots of land at little or no cost to expand.\n\n1919: Although it’s still concerned about the bay’s shallow waters and narrow channel, the Navy begins transferring destroyers to San Diego because of concern about Japan’s expansionism.\n\n1922: The Navy formally creates the U.S. Destroyer Base San Diego at 32nd Street, while pushing the city to dredge more of the bay to allow for larger ships.\n\nAbout this time, the area’s destroyer skippers include William “Bull” Halsey and Raymond Spruance, who become two of the most honored leaders in World War II.\n\n1924: Langley, the Navy’s first “proof of concept” aircraft carrier, begins operating out of North Island. The bay later is a base for the next three carriers — Lexington, Saratoga and Ranger.\n\n1931: Harbor dredging allows for a visit by the 888-foot carrier Saratoga, then the largest ship ever to arrive in San Diego Bay.\n\n1935: Reuben H. Fleet relocates Consolidated Aircraft from Buffalo, N.Y., to San Diego’s Lindbergh Field, where he begins building the PBY “Flying Boat,” an aircraft that becomes important to the Navy and other branches of the military.\n\nThat same year, the Ranger, the first ship built from the keel up as a carrier, arrives in San Diego.\n\n1938: The Saratoga successfully carries out a surprise mock attack on Pearl Harbor, adding to the growing belief that carriers will come to rival battleships in importance.\n\n1940: President Franklin D. Roosevelt shifts most U.S. warships from San Diego and San Pedro to Pearl Harbor because of growing tension with Japan.\n\n1941: Japan attacks Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, drawing the United States into World War II.\n\nThe Saratoga is quickly deployed from San Diego and goes on to play a key role in the battles of Guadalcanal and Iwo Jima, as well as the invasion of Bougainville in the Solomon Islands. It also sinks Ryujo, an important Japanese carrier.\n\n1942: American carrier pilots use the “Thach weave” in combat for the first time during the Battle of Midway.\n\nThe weave is an aerial tactic that improves an aviator’s ability to combat Japan’s primary fighter, the Mitsubishi A6M Zero. The tactic, developed a year earlier at North Island by aviator John Thach, proves to be useful and is adopted throughout the Navy.\n\n1942-45: World War II leads the Navy to expand in San Diego, creating operations such as the Anti-Submarine Warfare School and Naval Amphibious Base. Officials begin using Sweetwater Lake in East County to conduct transducer testing.\n\nThe Coronado Naval Amphibious Base is established, later to become the SEALs’ West Coast home.\n\n1945: The Navy Electronics Laboratory is established on Point Loma, where it gradually achieves breakthroughs, including the development of a low-frequency system for sending information to and from deeply submerged Polaris missile submarines.\n\n1946: The Navy creates Submarine Group San Diego, which is followed three years later by the establishment of Submarine Flotilla 1.\n\n1948: The jet age begins at North Island when it becomes home for its first jet training squadron.\n\n1950: North Korea invades South Korea, starting the Korean War. The San Diego-based carrier Valley Forge conducts the first airstrikes of the war.\n\n1950: The Valley Forge goes on to achieve a distinguished record, but the ship is reclassified as a support carrier in 1954 because it can’t handle the Navy’s shift to faster and heavier jets.\n\nIn September 1950, San Diego warships and Camp Pendleton-based Marines help lead the amphibious landing at Inchon, Korea, a surprise landing that enables Allied forces to recapture the city of Seoul.\n\n1952: The Navy creates Miramar Naval Air Station, which becomes a key pilot training base during the Vietnam War.\n\n1953: Convair introduces the Sea Dart, an experimental seaplane that’s part of an effort to provide the Navy with a supersonic aircraft.\n\n1958: The Navy announces it will open a nuclear warfare school at North Island.\n\n1959: Using sonar largely developed in San Diego, the nuclear-powered Skate becomes the first submarine to surface through the ice at the North Pole.\n\n1960: The Navy sends the two-person research submarine Bathyscaphe Trieste to waters near Guam, where it sets a depth record — descending 37,797 feet in the Challenger Deep region of the Marianas Trench. The sub is co-piloted by Navy Lt. Don Walsh, a San Diego State University alumnus.\n\nA Polaris ballistic missile is fired from underwater for the first time during tests off San Clemente Island. The test would aid in the development of Poseidon and Trident missiles.\n\n1961: The Kitty Hawk becomes the first “supercarrier” to be home-ported at North Island. The channel in San Diego Bay is dredged to 42 feet to allow for passage of the ship, which plays a major role in adding jets to the fleet.\n\n1962: The Constellation becomes the second supercarrier to be home-ported in San Diego.\n\n1963: President John F. Kennedy visits the Kitty Hawk off Southern California and later writes that the ship represents “great force for peace or war.” He is presented with a rocking chair.\n\n1964: The Constellation helps lead attacks on North Vietnam following the Gulf of Tonkin incident, a clash that greatly escalates the Vietnam War.\n\n1965: The Navy’s SEALAB II underwater habitat is placed in the ocean off La Jolla. The divers are assisted by Tuffy the dolphin from the Navy Marine Mammal Program at Point Loma.\n\n1966-67: The Kitty Hawk spends 117 days carrying out one of the longest bombing campaigns of the Vietnam War.\n\n1967: The Navy Marine Mammal Program transfers from Point Mugu to Point Loma, where the Navy studies and trains dolphins and sea lions for security and mine detection.\n\n1969: The Navy Fighter Weapons School opens at Miramar Naval Air Station. The school is created to improve the Navy’s poor record in aerial combat.\n\n1969: The San Diego-Coronado Bridge opens, deepening ties between the Navy, San Diego and Coronado.\n\n1970: The research submarine Dolphin becomes home-ported in San Diego, where it achieves groundbreaking work in sonar, targeting and deep diving.\n\n1974: The Tripoli becomes the first amphibious warship to carry a full squadron of AV-8 Harrier jets.\n\nThe San Diego-based Pintado becomes the first submarine to launch a Harpoon anti-ship missile.\n\n1976: San Diego becomes the home port for the Tarawa, the first in a new class of amphibious assault ships that combine functions that were previously divided among multiple vessels.\n\n1981: During a visit to the Constellation in August, President Ronald Reagan nicknames the aircraft carrier “America’s Flagship,” highlighting the importance of carriers and honoring the ship’s home port, San Diego.\n\nThat same year, the Naval Submarine Base was established on Point Loma.\n\n1983: The battleship New Jersey carries out key test firings of new Tomahawk cruise missiles off San Clemente Island.\n\n1984: A Soviet submarine surfaces in the Sea of Japan and collides with the Kitty Hawk, fanning Cold War tensions.\n\n1987: In July, Operation Earnest Will begins in the Persian Gulf. The Navy begins protecting Kuwaiti-owned tankers from attack by Iran.\n\n1987: The San Diego cruiser Fox helps lead the escort campaign. Tensions soon spike when Iran attacks a tanker ship.\n\nThe San Diego frigate Thach and other warships retaliate by attacking two Iranian oil platforms.\n\n1988: In April, the American frigate Samuel B. Roberts hits an Iranian mine in the Persian Gulf and suffers major damage. The ship is later escorted through the Strait of Hormuz by the San Diego cruiser Vincennes.\n\nThree months later, the commander of the Vincennes shoots down an Iranian commercial airliner, mistaking it for a hostile aircraft.\n\nThe attack kills 290 people and intensifies the national and international debates about America’s role and purpose in the Persian Gulf.\n\n1990-91: The Tarawa is appointed flagship of a 13-ship amphibious task force that helps liberate Kuwait from Iraqi invasion forces during the Desert Shield and Desert Storm operations under President George H.W. Bush.\n\nThe task force rehearses a landing that leads Iraqi forces to mistakenly believe their primary threat would come from the sea instead of over land. The deception helps reduce American casualties during the ground attack that follows.\n\nThe San Diego-based aircraft carrier Ranger plays a major role in airstrikes during this period.\n\nThe assault ship Tripoli strikes a mine, injuring four sailors and badly damaging the vessel. It returned to San Diego in August 1991.\n\n1992: Tripoli puts the first Marines ashore in Somalia during Operation Restore Hope. The submarine Drum hosts the first-ever tour of a U.S. nuclear submarine by senior Russian naval officers and dignitaries.\n\n1994: The Navy moves its experimental stealth ship Sea Shadow to San Diego, where it remained until 2006. Its design influences the design of Burke-class destroyers and littoral combat ships.\n\n1998: The John C. Stennis becomes the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to become home-ported in San Diego.\n\n1999: Michelle Howard is named commander of the Rushmore, becoming the first African-American woman to command a Navy ship.\n\n2001: In October, the U.S. begins Operation Enduring Freedom, a response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11.\n\nThe ships involved in the initial attack include the San Diego-based John Paul Jones, which launches the first Tomahawk cruise missiles fired at Afghan targets, and the amphibious assault ship Peleliu, which delivers the first Marines to Afghanistan.\n\n2003: The warships Boxer, Bonhomme Richard, Anchorage, Cleveland, Comstock, Dubuque and Pearl Harbor leave San Diego Bay for the Persian Gulf, where they participate in the Iraq War.\n\nThey’re joined by the San Diego-based Shiloh and Mobile Bay, which hit Iraqi targets during the early phase of the war while also protecting the aircraft carrier Constellation.\n\n2003: On May 1, President George W. Bush climbs into the co-pilot’s seat of an S-3B Viking at North Island and flies out to the carrier Abraham Lincoln off San Diego, where he announces that “major combat operations in Iraq have ended.” His speech comes as the Lincoln returns from deployment to Iraq, where combat operations would continue until 2010.\n\n2004: The aircraft carrier Midway opens as a museum in San Diego and attracts more than 500,000 visitors during its first seven months.\n\n2011: In May, Navy SEALs enter Pakistan and kill al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. The team transports bin Laden’s remains to the San Diego-based Carl Vinson and buries his remains at sea.\n\n2011: The aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan and other ships provide humanitarian relief to Japan after that country was struck by a catastrophic earthquake and tsunami.\n\n2014: In March, the Navy creates a “Top Gun” school in San Diego for ships. Its core mission is to educate a new generation of ship drivers.\n\n2015: The aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan is scheduled to forward deploy to Japan, where it is scheduled to be replaced by the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nSources: U.S. Navy, San Diego Historical Society, USS Midway Museum, San Diego History Center, Wikipedia.org, Naval History & Heritage Command, “The Military in San Diego” by Scott McGaugh, “San Diego: Home Base for Freedom” by Dan Walker, “The Navy in San Diego” by Bruce Linder, “Boosters and Bluejackets” by Abraham Shragge."
