        "text": "Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023.\n\n“2023 was another very strong year for Merck. I am extremely pleased by the progress we’ve made to develop and deliver transformative therapies and vaccines that will help save and improve lives around the world. We reached more than 500 million people with our medicines last year alone, over half of which were donations, including through our program to treat river blindness,” said Robert M. Davis, chairman and chief executive officer, Merck. “We also made investments of approximately $30 billion in research and development in our ongoing effort to discover, develop and collaborate to propel the next generation of impactful innovations. As we move forward, I’m confident that our strong momentum will continue, underpinned by the unwavering dedication of our talented global team.”\n\nFinancial Summary\n\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) loss/earnings per share (EPS) assuming dilution was a loss per share of $0.48 for the fourth quarter and EPS of $0.14 for the full year of 2023. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.03 for the fourth quarter and $1.51 for the full year of 2023. GAAP loss per share and non-GAAP EPS in the fourth quarter of 2023 include a charge of $1.69 per share related to the collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. GAAP and non-GAAP EPS for the full years of 2023 and 2022 include charges of $6.21 and $0.22 per share, respectively, related to certain collaborations, licensing agreements and asset acquisitions.\n\nNon-GAAP EPS excludes acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, including pretax intangible asset impairment research and development (R&D) charges of $779 million in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 related to gefapixant, and $780 million and $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter and full year of 2022, respectively, primarily related to nemtabrutinib. Non-GAAP EPS also excludes restructuring costs, including costs for the recently approved 2024 Restructuring Program, as well as income and losses from investments in equity securities.\n\nFourth-Quarter Sales Performance\n\nThe following table reflects sales of the company’s top products and significant performance drivers.\n\nFull-Year Revenue Performance\n\nThe following table reflects sales of the company’s top pharmaceutical products, as well as sales of Animal Health products.\n\nFull-year 2023 pharmaceutical sales grew 3% to $53.6 billion. Pharmaceutical sales growth was primarily driven by higher sales in oncology, particularly KEYTRUDA, higher sales of vaccines, reflecting strong growth of combined sales of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 and VAXNEUVANCE, as well as growth in hospital acute care products, including PREVYMIS and BRIDION. Pharmaceutical sales growth in 2023 was partially offset by lower sales of the COVID-19 medication LAGEVRIO, as well as lower sales of JANUVIA and JANUMET, primarily reflecting generic competition in many ex-U.S. markets and lower demand in the U.S., and lower sales of PNEUMOVAX 23 as the market continues to shift toward newer adult pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Pharmaceutical sales growth for the full year of 2023 was 14% excluding LAGEVRIO and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.\n\nFull-year 2023 Animal Health sales grew 1% to $5.6 billion. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, Animal Health sales grew 3%, primarily due to higher pricing. Full-year sales growth was also driven by higher demand for livestock products, led by poultry and swine products, partially offset by lower demand for ruminant products. Sales of BRAVECTO were $1.1 billion in 2023, which represented growth of 4%, or 5% excluding the impact of foreign exchange, primarily reflecting higher pricing.\n\nFourth-Quarter and Full-Year Expense, EPS and Related Information\n\nThe table below presents selected expense information.\n\n$ in millions\n\nGAAP\n\nAcquisition-\n\nand\n\nDivestiture-\n\nRelated Costs3\n\nRestructuring\n\nCosts\n\n(Income)\n\nLoss From\n\nInvestments\n\nin Equity\n\nSecurities\n\nNon-\n\nGAAP2\n\nFourth Quarter 2023\n\nCost of sales\n\n$3,911\n\n$454\n\n$117\n\n$-\n\n$3,340\n\nSelling, general and administrative\n\n2,804\n\n24\n\n29\n\n-\n\n2,751\n\nResearch and development\n\n9,628\n\n790\n\n-\n\n-\n\n8,838\n\nRestructuring costs\n\n255\n\n-\n\n255\n\n-\n\n-\n\nOther (income) expense, net\n\n78\n\n(35)\n\n-\n\n(61)\n\n174\n\nFourth Quarter 2022\n\nCost of sales\n\n$3,881\n\n$482\n\n$38\n\n$-\n\n$3,361\n\nSelling, general and administrative\n\n2,687\n\n39\n\n20\n\n-\n\n2,628\n\nResearch and development\n\n3,775\n\n740\n\n-\n\n-\n\n3,035\n\nRestructuring costs\n\n49\n\n-\n\n49\n\n-\n\n-\n\nOther (income) expense, net\n\n(75)\n\n(69)\n\n-\n\n80\n\n(86)\n\n$ in millions\n\nGAAP\n\nAcquisition-\n\nand\n\nDivestiture-\n\nRelated Costs3\n\nRestructuring\n\nCosts\n\n(Income)\n\nLoss From\n\nInvestments\n\nin Equity\n\nSecurities\n\nCertain Other Items\n\nNon-\n\nGAAP2\n\nYear Ended Dec. 31, 2023\n\nCost of sales\n\n$16,126\n\n$2,018\n\n$211\n\n$-\n\n$-\n\n$13,897\n\nSelling, general and administrative\n\n10,504\n\n86\n\n122\n\n-\n\n-\n\n10,296\n\nResearch and development\n\n30,531\n\n819\n\n1\n\n-\n\n-\n\n29,711\n\nRestructuring costs\n\n599\n\n-\n\n599\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nOther (income) expense, net\n\n466\n\n(47)\n\n-\n\n(279)\n\n573\n\n219\n\nYear Ended Dec. 31, 2022\n\nCost of sales\n\n$17,411\n\n$2,059\n\n$205\n\n$-\n\n$-\n\n$15,147\n\nSelling, general and administrative\n\n10,042\n\n176\n\n94\n\n-\n\n-\n\n9,772\n\nResearch and development\n\n13,548\n\n1,676\n\n30\n\n-\n\n-\n\n11,842\n\nRestructuring costs\n\n337\n\n-\n\n337\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nOther (income) expense, net\n\n1,501\n\n(207)\n\n-\n\n1,348\n\n-\n\n360\n\nGAAP Expense, EPS and Related Information\n\nGross margin was 73.3% for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with 71.9% for the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to the favorable impacts of lower LAGEVRIO sales, which have a low gross margin, lower manufacturing facilities costs and product mix, partially offset by the unfavorable impacts of foreign exchange and higher restructuring costs. Gross margin was 73.2% for the full year of 2023 compared with 70.6% for the full year of 2022. The increase was primarily due to the favorable impacts of lower LAGEVRIO sales, product mix, lower manufacturing facilities costs, and lower revenue from third-party manufacturing arrangements, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.\n\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher administrative costs, including higher compensation and benefit costs, partially offset by lower promotional spending. Full-year 2023 SG&A expenses were $10.5 billion, an increase of 5% compared with the full year of 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher administrative costs, including higher compensation and benefit costs, and higher promotional spending, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange and lower acquisition- and divestiture-related costs.\n\nR&D expenses were $9.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. R&D expenses were $30.5 billion for the full year of 2023 compared with $13.5 billion for the full year of 2022. The increase in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 reflects a $5.5 billion charge for the collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo, and higher development costs due to spending on clinical programs, including newly acquired programs, as well as higher compensation and benefit costs (reflecting in part increased headcount). The increase in R&D expenses for the full year was also due to charges of $11.4 billion in the aggregate for the acquisitions of Prometheus Biosciences, Inc. (Prometheus) and Imago BioSciences, Inc. (Imago). The increase in R&D expenses for the full year was partially offset by lower intangible asset impairment charges in 2023 and charges of $690 million in the aggregate in 2022 for collaboration and licensing agreements with Moderna, Inc. (Moderna), Orna Therapeutics (Orna) and Orion Corporation (Orion).\n\nOther (income) expense, net, was $78 million of expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with $75 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher exchange losses and higher net interest expense, partially offset by net gains from investments in equity securities for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with net losses from investments in equity securities for the fourth quarter of 2022, and lower pension settlement costs. Other (income) expense, net, was $466 million of expense in the full year of 2023 compared with $1.5 billion of expense in the full year of 2022, primarily due to net gains from investments in equity securities in 2023 compared with net losses from investments in equity securities in 2022, and lower pension settlement costs, partially offset by a $572.5 million charge in 2023 related to settlements with certain plaintiffs in the Zetia antitrust litigation.\n\nThe effective tax rate was 40.1% for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with 14.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2023 includes a 29.2 percentage point impact resulting from the charge for the Daiichi Sankyo collaboration. The effective tax rate was 80.0% for the full year of 2023 compared with 11.7% for the full year of 2022. The full-year 2023 effective tax rate reflects an aggregate 65.6 percentage point unfavorable impact, resulting from charges for asset acquisitions (for which no tax benefits were recognized) as well as the charge for the Daiichi Sankyo collaboration.\n\nGAAP loss per share was $0.48 for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with EPS of $1.18 for the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily driven by the charge in 2023 related to the collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and higher restructuring costs, partially offset by a beneficial impact from the tax rate and operational strength in the business. GAAP EPS was $0.14 for the full year of 2023 compared with EPS of $5.71 for the full year of 2022. The EPS decline in 2023 was primarily due to higher charges for certain business development transactions, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and the tax rate, as well as a charge related to settlements with certain plaintiffs in the Zetia antitrust litigation, partially offset by the beneficial impacts of operational strength in the business, better performance from equity investments and lower intangible asset impairment charges.\n\nNon-GAAP Expense, EPS and Related Information\n\nNon-GAAP gross margin was 77.2% for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with 75.7% for the fourth quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP gross margin was 76.9% for the full year of 2023 compared with 74.4% for the full year of 2022. The non-GAAP gross margin improvement in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 was primarily due to the favorable impacts of lower LAGEVRIO sales, which have a low gross margin, product mix, and lower manufacturing facilities costs. The increase in non-GAAP gross margin for the full year was also due to lower revenue from third-party manufacturing arrangements. The non-GAAP gross margin improvement in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.\n\nNon-GAAP SG&A expenses were $2.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher administrative costs, including higher compensation and benefit costs, partially offset by lower promotional spending. Full-year 2023 non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $10.3 billion, an increase of 5% compared with the full year of 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher administrative costs, including higher compensation and benefit costs, and higher promotional spending, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange.\n\nNon-GAAP R&D expenses were $8.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with $3.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $29.7 billion for the full year of 2023 compared with $11.8 billion for the full year of 2022. The increase in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 reflects a $5.5 billion charge for the collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo, and higher development costs due to spending on clinical programs, including newly acquired programs, as well as higher compensation and benefit costs (reflecting in part increased headcount). The increase in non-GAAP R&D expenses for the full year was also due to charges of $11.4 billion in the aggregate for the acquisitions of Prometheus and Imago. The increase in R&D expenses for the full year was partially offset by charges of $690 million in the aggregate in 2022 for collaboration and licensing agreements with Moderna, Orna and Orion.\n\nNon-GAAP other (income) expense, net, was $174 million of expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with $86 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher exchange losses and higher net interest expense, partially offset by lower pension settlement costs. Non-GAAP other (income) expense, net, was $219 million of expense in the full year of 2023 compared with $360 million of expense in the full year of 2022, primarily due to lower pension settlement costs.\n\nThe non-GAAP effective tax rate was 114.2% for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with 15.6% in the fourth quarter of 2022. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2023 includes a 101.1 percentage point unfavorable impact resulting from the charge for the Daiichi Sankyo collaboration. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 35.8% for the full year of 2023 compared with 14.2% for the full year of 2022. The full-year 2023 non-GAAP effective tax rate reflects an aggregate 21.2 percentage point unfavorable impact, resulting from charges for asset acquisitions (for which no benefits were recognized) as well as the charge for the Daiichi Sankyo collaboration.\n\nNon-GAAP EPS was $0.03 for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with $1.62 for the fourth quarter of 2022. The non-GAAP EPS decline in the fourth quarter was primarily due to the charge in 2023 related to the collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by a beneficial impact from the tax rate and operational strength in the business. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.51 for the full year of 2023 compared with $7.48 for the full year of 2022. The non-GAAP EPS decline for the full year was primarily due to higher charges for certain business development transactions, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and the tax rate, partially offset by operational strength in the business.\n\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net (loss) income and (loss) earnings per share is provided in the table that follows.\n\n2024 Restructuring Program\n\nMerck recently approved a new restructuring program (2024 Restructuring Program) intended to continue the optimization of the company’s Human Health global manufacturing network as the future pipeline shifts to new modalities, and also to optimize the Animal Health global manufacturing network to improve supply reliability and increase efficiency. The company recorded charges in its GAAP results of $190 million related to the 2024 Restructuring Program for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023.\n\nPipeline and Portfolio Highlights\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Merck continued to make significant progress advancing its broad portfolio and pipeline across key therapeutic areas, representing continued momentum toward addressing patient needs.\n\nIn oncology, Merck received multiple U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals, including KEYTRUDA plus Padcev for the first-line treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer and WELIREG for the treatment of certain patients with previously treated advanced RCC, among other approvals. The FDA also accepted and granted Priority Review to Merck and Daiichi Sankyo’s Biologics License Application (BLA) for patritumab deruxtecan for the treatment of certain patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The FDA set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action, date of June 26, 2024. In addition, Merck showed meaningful progress in its robust oncology pipeline, initiating Phase 3 trials for four investigational medicines, including bomedemstat (LSD1 inhibitor), nemtabrutinib (BTK inhibitor), MK-2870 (anti-TROP2 antibody-drug conjugate) and MK-5684 (CYP11A1 inhibitor).\n\nIn vaccines, Merck received Priority Review from the FDA for a BLA for V116, the company’s investigational, 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine specifically designed to protect adults, based on results from multiple Phase 3 trials. The FDA set a PDUFA date of June 17, 2024. If approved, V116 would be the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to include serotypes responsible for approximately 83 percent of adult invasive pneumococcal disease in individuals 65 and older, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data from 2018-2021.\n\nIn hospital acute care, the European Commission (EC) approved PREVYMIS for prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in high-risk adult kidney transplant recipients and extended 200-day dosing in adult hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients who are at high risk for late CMV infection and disease.\n\nMerck continued to augment its pipeline through business development, and in January 2024, entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Harpoon Therapeutics, Inc. (Harpoon), for an approximate total equity value of $680 million, further diversifying its oncology pipeline.\n\nNotable recent news releases on Merck’s pipeline and portfolio are provided in the table that follows.\n\nFull-Year 2024 Financial Outlook\n\nThe following table summarizes the company’s full-year financial outlook.\n\nMerck has not provided a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP other (income) expense, net, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, given it cannot predict with reasonable certainty the amounts necessary for such a reconciliation, including intangible asset impairment charges, legal settlements, and income and losses from investments in equity securities either owned directly or through ownership interests in investment funds, without unreasonable effort. These items are inherently difficult to forecast and could have a significant impact on the company’s future GAAP results.\n\nMerck anticipates full-year 2024 sales to be between $62.7 billion and $64.2 billion, including a negative impact of foreign exchange of approximately 2% at mid-January 2024 exchange rates. The negative impact is primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso, which the company expects will largely be offset by inflation-related price increases, consistent with market practice.\n\nThe outlook for operating expenses reflects incremental R&D spending expected to be incurred to advance the development of promising programs related to the acquisitions of Prometheus, Imago and Harpoon, as well as the collaborations with Daiichi Sankyo and Kelun-Biotech.\n\nMerck’s full-year non-GAAP effective income tax rate is expected to be between 14.5% and 15.5%.\n\nMerck expects full-year 2024 non-GAAP EPS to be between $8.44 and $8.59, including a negative impact of foreign exchange of approximately $0.25 per share. In 2023, non-GAAP EPS of $1.51 was negatively impacted by charges of $6.21 per share related to certain acquisitions and collaboration agreements.\n\nIn early January 2024, Merck announced the acquisition of Harpoon, which is expected to close in the first half of 2024, and result in a non-tax deductible charge of approximately $650 million of R&D expense included in non-GAAP results. The impact of the transaction on expected full-year non-GAAP EPS is approximately $0.26 per share, which is included in the 2024 outlook.\n\nConsistent with past practice, the financial outlook does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions.\n\nEarnings Conference Call\n\nInvestors, journalists and the general public may access a live audio webcast of the earnings conference call on Thursday, Feb. 1, at 9 a.m. ET via this weblink.

If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.\n\nRisks and uncertainties include but are not limited to, general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of the global outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19); the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation in the United States and internationally; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development, including obtaining regulatory approval; the company’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of the company’s patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation, including patent litigation, and/or regulatory actions.\n\nThe company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) available at the SEC’s Internet site (www.sec.gov).\n\nAppendix\n\nGeneric product names are provided below.\n\nPharmaceutical\n\nBRIDION (sugammadex)\n\nGARDASIL (Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent [Types 6, 11, 16 and 18] Vaccine, Recombinant)\n\nGARDASIL 9 (Human Papillomavirus 9-valent Vaccine, Recombinant)\n\nJANUMET(sitagliptin and metformin HCl)\n\nJANUVIA(sitagliptin)\n\nKEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab)\n\nLAGEVRIO(molnupiravir)\n\nLenvima(lenvatinib)\n\nLynparza(olaparib)\n\nM-M-R II(Measles, Mumps and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live)\n\nPNEUMOVAX 23 (Pneumococcal Vaccine Polyvalent)\n\nPREVYMIS (letermovir)\n\nPROQUAD(Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella Virus Vaccine Live)\n\nROTATEQ (Rotavirus Vaccine, Live, Oral, Pentavalent)\n\nVARIVAX(Varicella Virus Vaccine Live)\n\nVAXNEUVANCE (Pneumococcal 15-valent Conjugate Vaccine)\n\nWELIREG (belzutifan)\n\nAnimal Health\n\nBRAVECTO (fluralaner)\n\n________________________________ 1 Net (loss) income attributable to Merck & Co., Inc. 2 Merck is providing certain 2023 and 2022 non-GAAP information that excludes certain items because of the nature of these items and the impact they have on the analysis of underlying business performance and trends. Management believes that providing this information enhances investors’ understanding of the company’s results because management uses non-GAAP results to assess performance. Management uses non-GAAP measures internally for planning and forecasting purposes and to measure the performance of the company along with other metrics. In addition, senior management’s annual compensation is derived in part using a non-GAAP pre-tax income metric. This information should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a description of the non-GAAP adjustments, see Table 2a attached to this release. 3 Includes expenses for the amortization of intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments to inventories recognized as a result of acquisitions of businesses, intangible asset impairment charges and expense or income related to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration. R&D expenses include intangible asset impairment charges of $779 million in both the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 related to gefapixant and $780 million and $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter and full year of 2022, respectively, largely related to nemtabrutinib. Also includes integration, transaction and certain other costs associated with acquisitions and divestitures, as well as amortization of intangible assets related to collaborations and licensing arrangements.\n\nMERCK & CO., INC.

The non-GAAP information presented should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, information prepared in accordance with GAAP. (1) Amounts included in cost of sales primarily reflect expenses for the amortization of intangible assets. Amounts included in selling, general and administrative expenses reflect integration, transaction and certain other costs related to acquisitions and divestitures. Amounts included in research and development expenses primarily reflect a $779 million in-process research and development (IPR&D) impairment charge related to gefapixant, which was obtained as part of the 2016 Afferent Pharmaceuticals acquisition, and expenses for the amortization of intangible assets. Amounts included in other (income) expense, net, primarily reflect royalty income related to the prior termination of the Sanofi-Pasteur MSD joint venture. Additionally, other (income) expense, net, for the full year includes a $37 million loss on the sale of a business. (2) Amounts primarily include employee separation costs and accelerated depreciation associated with facilities to be closed or divested related to activities under the company's formal restructuring programs. (3) Reflects a charge related to settlements with certain plaintiffs in the Zetia antitrust litigation. (4) Represents the estimated tax impacts on the reconciling items based on applying the statutory rate of the originating territory of the non-GAAP adjustments. (5) Because the company recorded a net loss in the fourth quarter of 2023, no potential dilutive common shares were used in the computation of loss per common share assuming dilution as the effect would have been anti-dilutive.\n\nMERCK & CO., INC.
