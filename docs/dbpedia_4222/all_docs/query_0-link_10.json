CLICK HERE\n\nYour weekly update direct to your inbox – sign up to follow maltagc70 (see R)\n\n30 August 1942: Rations Cut Again – Meat Only Twice a Week\n\nFrom: Governor Malta To: Air Ministry 30 August 1942\n\nPlease pass to Secretary of State for the Colonies and Chiefs of Staff MidEast please pass to Minister of State Cairo.\n\n1. Unloading and dispersal of supplies from convoy is now complete except for aviation and benzene, fortress can hold out until early December. Aviation spirit position has been reported separately to Chiefs of Staff in HQ Med Sig 0726 of 25/8. Benzine consumption has been reduced to 15,200 gallons per week but even so stocks will only last until mid-November. Benzine can be made to last until target date by drawing on 77 octane but this is likely to be required for blending with aviation spirit. We have 600 tons of 77 octane available, of which 250 tons are held as fortress reserve of MT spirit and 100 tons are needed for consumption by naval and RAF craft.\n\n2. Target date of early December allows for following adjustments of consumption on civil side:\n\n(i) Bread ration for men between 16 and 60 will be increased by 3½ ounces per day to 14 ounces.\n\n(ii) Fat ration will be at half normal ration level during September but I hope to increase it to normal level at beginning of October.\n\n(iii) Regular issues of edible oil will be made at normal ration rates.\n\n(iv) There will be regular issues of coffee with possibly one period skipped.\n\n(v) Regular weekly issues of kerosene will be made as from 1st October but at summer rather than higher winter rate.\n\n(vi) Domestic electricity supply will be restored on 1st October.\n\n(vii) Brewing will be resumed as soon as possible.\n\n(viii) Present reduced rations of sugar and soap will be maintained, sugar being issued twice every three half-monthly periods and soap once very two periods.\n\n3. Victory kitchens now have 60,000 persons registered and 170 kitchens are in operation. Further rapid expansion is possible but supply of vegetables cannot be further increased while potatoes are now almost unobtainable and meat supply is not as great as was expected and is already falling off. In future it will be possible to provide meat on only two days a week instead of five, and this may later have to be reduced to one if registration increases as expected.\n\nIn this situation I have been carefully considering the future of the Victory kitchens. Allowing for small increases in rations now being made, calorie value of rationed foods per day for a man between 16 and 60 who is member of average size family is 1300, or 200 calories below figure normally taken as minimum. Outside rations, very little food is obtainable. Fresh meat, fish and vegetables are all too scarce to be rationed, even if this were possible from other points of view. Marketing of meat and vegetables is now under control of Government and no meat except poultry and rabbits and small amount only of vegetables is being sold on open market. Victory kitchens provide only satisfactory method of distributing evenly what meat and vegetables are available and if we were now to revert to old arrangement under which kitchens provide meals only on surrender of rations allowing majority of meat and vegetable supply to return to open market, effect would be that poorer classes would get very little, while those who are prepared to pay any price would obtain what they wished.\n\n4. I am satisfied that in our present food situation it is essential to continue existing policy of providing one meal a day through kitchens outside rations so as to raise calorie value of diet to about 1800 calories. This can only be done by introducing considerable quantities of imported supplies into the menus. I have decided accordingly that all civil supplies of dried vegetables, dried eggs and cheese shall be allotted to the communal feeding department and that [pasta] shall be issued through kitchens on a substantial scale, estimated to absorb 230 tons of flour per month on an average registration of 150,000 persons. This allotment of flour has been allowed for in calculating target date. Menu will then consist of macaroni and cheese on two days, minestra on two days, meat and vegetables on two days and an egg dish on one day. I anticipate that effect of new policy will be to encourage rapid increase in registration.\n\n5. In spite of increased issues described above, the civil food situation is still causing me considerable anxiety. Rates of rations and general scale of diet remain low. No signs of serious malnutrition have yet appeared but prolonged continuance of present food shortage must have its effect both on health and morale and shortage will be more seriously felt in winter. Anything which can be done by special means at any time before another convoy is run, to supplement diet by importing concentrated foodstuffs or food of small bulk, will help greatly. I will telegraph our immediate requirements of these types of food in the course of the next two days in case any special opportunity occurs to send such supplies.\n\nAIR RAIDS DAWN 30 AUGUST TO DAWN 31 AUGUST 1942\n\nWeather Fine; little or no cloud: visibility 15-20 miles.

The Island’s air and naval forces have starved the Axis of more than half of the supplies they need to continue the battle in North Africa. Rommel originally intended to begin a major offensive against British forces on 26 August but had to postpone due to a shortage of fuel, thanks to the sinking of two tankers in the Mediterranean.\n\nWith a promise that another convoy would set out immediately from Italy, at 2330 hrs on Sunday Rommel launched an attack at Alam el Halfa but came up against a massive minefield and a well-equipped British force under Lt Gen Montgomery. But nine Beauforts and eleven Beaufighters had already set off from Malta to attack the supply convoy, which had been spotted by 69 Squadron photo-reconnaissance pilots. At the same time destroyers, bombers and naval aircraft launched heavy attacks on Axis stores and workshops close to the battlefield.\n\nYesterday Malta-based submarine P 35 sank a southbound 5000 ton merchant vessel and the Island’s bombers stand ready to act immediately to any further attempts to re-supply the enemy. Attacks continued today with Wellington bombers targeting a tanker and Navy Air Service Albacores striking a merchant vessel and escort with torpedoes.\n\nAfter three days of relentless allied bombing and artillery fire and faced with a precarious supply situation Rommel has been forced to call off the attack and withdraw his forces.\n\nAIR RAIDS DAWN 2 SEPTEMBER TO DAWN 3 SEPTEMBER 1942\n\nWeather Fair but cloudy.\n\n0915-1020 hrs; 1015-1055 hrs Five Spitfires 229 Squadron Ta Qali at a time on intercept patrol and sweep: no sightings.\n\n1015-1045 hrs Five Spitfires Hal Far are airborne on patrol: nothing sighted.\n\n1303 hrs Three enemy aircraft are reported approaching Malta.

Aircraft casualties One Hudson tyre believed burst during take-off, crashed and burned out: crew uninjured.\n\nHAL FAR 1720-1830 hrs Five Spitfires carried out a sweep over Sicily and encounter enemy aircraft. 2129-0235 hrs One Swordfish with flares and two Albacores NAS located and attacked a 5000 ton merchant vessel, escorted by two destroyers and a small flak ship, 15 miles north east of Cape Spartivento heading easterly. They located the target just off the toe of Sicily and score hits with two torpedoes, one aft of the funnel and one aft of the bridge, followed by a violent explosion. They leave the vessel down by the stern and belching clouds of black and white smoke. A later photo-reconnaissance report showed the merchant vessel aground close to where it had been attacked.\n\n3 September 1942: Reconnaissance Pilots Praised for Axis Convoy Hits\n\n“The Air Officer Commanding sends personal congratulations to 69 Squadron (Reconaissance) for successful attacks on two successive nights, when Wellingtons scored direct hits on an important tanker heading for North Africa and also near-misses on destroyers. The loss or even the disabling of the enemy tanker should greatly assist the British fighting Rommel.”\n\nAIR RAIDS DAWN 3 SEPTEMBER TO DAWN 4 SEPTEMBER 1942\n\nWeather Fair but cloudy.\n\n0935-1030 hrs Five Spitfires Hal Far are airborne on patrol: nothing sighted.\n\n1405-1510 hrs Four Spitfires 229 Squadron Ta Qali on patrol: no sightings.\n\n1701-1720 hrs Air raid alert.

One Albacore scored a torpedo hit on the ship’s port quarter, while the other scored a direct hit with a 250lb bomb on the destroyer alongside, and straddled the merchant vessel with two other bombs. Photo-reconnaissance later showed that the merchant vessel had a large gap in her starboard side.\n\nLater tonight two Wellington bombers took advantage of intense darkness to attack a small merchant vessel 30 miles east of Point Alice. They dropped a total of eight 500lb bombs on the ship but were unable to observe results, which will await confirmation by photo-reconnaissance.\n\nAIR RAIDS DAWN 4 SEPTEMBER TO DAWN 5 SEPTEMBER 1942\n\nWeather Local thunder; rain with bright periods.

Circus operations, introduced in 1941, involve sending a formation of bombers escorted by a larger number of fighters whose to act as bait and entice German fighters into combat on the RAF’s own terms.\n\nThe Hurricanes, of the Royal Naval Air Service based at Hal Far, took off at 1540 hrs this afternoon, accompanied by twelve Spitfires from Ta Qali. Thick cloud obscured the intended target but S/Lt Pratt dropped his two 250lb bombs on military buildings north east of Gela town.

One section dived to investigate the unidentified aircraft during which Sergeant Cornish crashed into the sea, either shot down or having failed to pull out of the dive. Flying Officer Newman flying V S Spitfire EP190 reported that he was circling an aircraft in the sea; this was the last contact with him. Both pilots failed to return. It is thought that Flying Officer Newman had fallen victim to the guns of Ltn Schiess of Stab/JG53, although another pilot of Stab/JG53 also claimed a Spitfire during the same sortie, this was not confirmed.” (1)\n\nAIR RAIDS DAWN 26 AUGUST TO DAWN 27 AUGUST 1942\n\nDay Two air raid alerts for a total of 56 enemy aircraft: only a few fighters cross the coast.

Following recent photo-reconnaissance reports of increased numbers of Axis bombers in the area, three Spitfire Squadrons – a total of over 30 aircraft – were sent to carry out the high-risk low-level raids on Biscara, Comiso and Gela. 29 Axis aircraft were destroyed on the ground and 10 more in air combat, plus others damaged – for the loss of two Spitfires. Wing Commander Arthur Donaldson recalled the loss of his second in command as they attacked Biscara:\n\n“We maintained complete RT silence so as to arrive unheralded. My Squadron was to attack Biscara. The flak was intense. I looked across at poor old Walter Churchill, and at that very moment he was shot down in flames, crashing in the middle of the aerodrome. I saw a Dornier bomber about to take off and by the time he was in my sights he was airborne. I chased him for about twenty miles. He had smoke pouring out of him and he was losing height; and disappeared below a small hill. I was not able to see him hit the ground, but it was obvious that he was a dead duck.” (2)\n\nAXIS FORCES HARASSED\n\nMeanwhile attacks by Malta-based forces on southbound Axis convoys are hitting home, as war in the Western Desert reaches a critical point. Beauforts and Beaufighters sank a merchant vessel and damaged its escorting destroyer north of Benghazi, with the loss of one Beaufighter. A Malta-based submarine sank a second merchant vessel in a torpedo strike. The attacks are key to deterring a major planned offensive by German forces in North Africa, according to a US news agency:\n\n“An attack in Egypt by Rommel is expected at any time, according to a radio dispatch from the special correspondent of the “New York Times” in the Western Desert. He says that the RAF is attacking streams of German trucks and supplies which are moving up to the front. They are causing death and havoc, but the stream continues to move up, bringing nearer “Der Tag” [The Day] which many observers believe will be an August day.\n\nThere is an air of alertness and expectancy along the El A|amein front: “It may be tonight,” said one British captain. “Our tanks are standing by in case anything happens.” It is not thought that Rommel will delay much longer, unless he has experienced greater supply difficulties than the British observers expected. The British and Dominion forces are taking the utmost precautions to keep themselves informed of Rommel’s movements. They are determined to avert a surprise attack.”The Advertiser, Adelaide, 28 August 1942\n\nAIR RAIDS DAWN 27 AUGUST TO DAWN 28 AUGUST 1942\n\nDay Two air raid alerts for a total of eleven enemy aircraft which approach the Island Spitfires intercept and no aircraft cross the coast.\n\nNight No raids.\n\nMilitary casualties Group Captain Walter Myers Churchill, DSO, DFC, Royal Air Force (Auxiliary Force), 605 Squadron; Flying Officer Percy Johnston, Royal Canadian Air Force, 200 Squadron; Flight Sergeant Eric O’Hara, Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAF VR), 227 Squadron; Sergeant Kenneth Seddon, RAF VR, Navigator with 227 Squadron.\n\nCivilian casualties (see Air Raids 26 to 27 Aug) Mqabba Michael Cachia, age 11; Emmanual Zammit, age 7; Joseph Zammit, age 6.

Beaufighters attacked first, dropping seven 250lb GP bombs and scoring one hit on the stern of the merchant vessel. They also raked the merchant vessel and destroyer with machine guns and cannons from deck level. The destroyer was left smoking from the stern. Beauforts then attacked with torpedoes, scoring three hits on the merchant vessel which blew up and was left ablaze, and sinking with decks awash and back broken. The escorting Cant was destroyed by Beaufighters which also damaged the JU 88.\n\nNight Two Hurricanes made a bombing attack on Gela and Comiso aerodromes. Results were unobserved owing to intense flak. One Beaufighter 89 Squadron attacked the seaplane hangar at Syracuse with machine gun and cannon fire, scoring many hits.

One Beaufighter believed hit by enemy flak while on shipping strike: crew missing.\n\n28 August 1942: Malta Must Survive on Minimum Supplies, Warns Governor\n\nIn a radio broadcast today, the Governor and Commander in Chief warned the people of Malta of further hardships to come. He asked their help to ensure the survival of the Island until a future convoy can reach them:\n\n“Recently we have seen four merchant ships and an oiler reach Malta; this represents the largest number of ships which has arrived in the GrandHarbour since September of last year. No sight could have been more welcome to us all than the arrival of the convoy after so many weeks of anxious waiting…\n\nWhen the last ship of the convoy, the US tanker Ohio, entered Grand Harbour as the sun rose on August 15, everyone in Malta was mindful of how the nine days of united prayer had been answered and was thankful. We are also conscious that, when so many have risked so much and when so many lives have been lost to bring supplies to us from Britain, we also have a duty to perform ourselves. These convoys are very hazardous operations and, were we to be improvident about the supplies which have reached us, we would do a real disservice not only to those who dared all to succour us, but also to ourselves. It is our bounded duty to eke out our available stores to carry us forward as far as possible on the road to victory…\n\nConvoys, such as this last convoy, are magnificent achievements, but they cannot be constantly repeated, and we must now steel ourselves to last out until a new target date. We will play our part, as Malta has consistently played it in the past. Our aim must be to keep our consumption of all foodstuffs and other commodities at the lowest possible level and so put off, for as long as we can, the date when another convoy has to reach our shores.” (3)\n\nAIR RAIDS DAWN 28 AUGUST TO DAWN 29 AUGUST 1942\n\nDay One air raid alert for 14 enemy fighters on patrol.\n\nNight Three air raid alerts for a total of four Italian aircraft, two of which drop bombs in the sea.\n\nMilitary casualties Pilot Officer George Bishop, Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve; Flight Sergeant Donald Leitch, Royal Canadian Air Force; Flight Lieutenant Ernest Magruder, Royal Air Force, 229 Squadron; Flight Lieutenant John Wallis, Royal Air Force, 42 Squadron.\n\nCivilian casualties Nil.\n\nOPERATIONS REPORTS FRIDAY 28 AUGUST 1942\n\nAIR HQ Rodeo attack by 16 Spitfires over south east Sicily.

The match, also attended by the Governor, was organised in aid of the Malta Convoy Fund recently set up to assist the widows and families of those lost during Operation Pedestal. Free seats were allocated to the Merchant Navy for the event. During his opening speech, Major General Scobie paid tribute to the seamen and thanked them for bringing the surviving convoy ships safely into Grand Harbour.\n\nToday’s free match tickets are part of a series of events to show Malta’s appreciation of the ordeal during the Santa Marija convoy experienced by the merchant seamen. Welcomed by enthusiastic crowds everywhere, their itineraries have included a tour of Mdina and a visit to Mosta Rotunda, as well as a demonstration of small arms fire at the Weapon Training School at Ghajn Tuffieha Bay. Despite their exhaustion, a Merchant Navy team managed to hold Sliema Wanderers to a 1-1 draw in a football match at the Empire Stadium in Gzira.\n\nMILITARY SITUATION REPORT WEEK ENDING 29 AUG 42\n\nFrom: Governor & C in C Malta To: C in C Middle East Rpt: The War Office\n\n1.

Unless another convoy reaches the Island by Friday of this week, supplies of food and fuel will run out within days. The minimal stores delivered over recent weeks by submarine and by fast minelayers Manxman and Welshman have been barely enough to meet a few days’ needs. Without immediate help, Malta could fall into enemy hands.\n\n2 August 1942: Cluster Bomb Kills 13 Year Old\n\nA 13 year old boy was killed yesterday in Birkirkara by a German anti-personnel bomb. The village is now the most densely populated in Malta thanks to the many refugees from Grand Harbour who have taken shelter there. In an air raid centred on Ta Qali late on Sunday evening, Birkirkara was showered with butterfly bombs – cluster bombs which are released from canisters holding up to 100 each.\n\nThe Royal Engineers Bomb Disposal Sections were drafted in to clear the dozens of unexploded small bombs reported across the area. At least one remained undetected. Yesterday afternoon a group of boys were playing hide and seek behind rubble walls surrounding the fields outside the village. 13 year old Joe Galea jumped over a wall and landed on one of the bombs which exploded, killing him instantly.

Lt Swales attacked, firing a short burst, followed by S/Ldr Douglas who fired all his ammunition but could not get closer than 400 yards. No strikes were seen but Lt Swales had not finished. He turned on the other Macchi and fired a 5 second burst at 200 yards into the starboard wing and fuselage of the enemy aircraft, which started to smoke. The Italian swooped into a steep dive and Lt Swales followed him down, firing until all his ammunition was spent. The Macchi was last seen at water level, smoking badly.\n\nAIR RAIDS DAWN 4 AUGUST TO DAWN 5 AUGUST 1942\n\nWeather Fine; visibility 10-15 miles.\n\nLuqa working parties are reduced by the withdrawal of 450 men of 1 Brigade.

It had reached the point where bread, an important staple for most people, had become rationed with hardly enough for the average family and its quality greatly reduced by the addition of potatoes and other ingredients. I still remember my mother, with three growing hungry youngsters, bartering a gold ring on the Black Market in exchange for a badly needed loaf of bread – just to put something into our empty stomachs. My mother, like most mothers, often kept herself short just to give us a little extra to eat.…\n\nAs the siege tightened we begin to notice the lean and haggard faces of the men, women and children around us, the young and the old. You begin to notice the start of sunken cheeks and dark shadows under the eyes. You begin to see the thinness of the arms and legs of chidren. You feel general body weakness where the minimum effort saps one’s strength. You see the faces of people of fair complexion beginning to turn a ghostly pale or ashen gray and those of darker complexion into a ghastly greenish hue.\n\nThe pangs of hunger had become so acute that chewing the end tip of my leather belt became a common practice, as with most others. The taste sometimes still lingers. For a while water consumption, when not cut off, helped fill the voids in our stomachs, but you can’t fool the body all the time. Waistlines now had shrunk to the point where, with continued belt tightening the tip of one’s belt was now reaching the small of one’s back…\n\nIt was during a heavy air attack at Marsa Creek, an inlet a short distance from my home, where a freighter was hit sending some of its cargo of flour in great clouds high into the air. Just as soon as the dust had settled, crowds of kids, including my nine years old brother Francis, descended on the scene widely scooping up from the ground, in empty tins and cans, grit, dust and all, as much flour as possible to take home. At this unexpected bounty, little as it was, my mother, completely surprised and overjoyed, quickly added water kneading it into a kind of dough and cooked it. We could not wait until it was ready and when it was, we literally wolfed it down, crunching the dust and grit between our teeth and offering deep thanks to God for his loving beneficence…\n\nThe ravages of the siege with its acute food shortages, continuous bombing and sleepless nights left its mark in the form of early deaths, weakened constitutions, miscarriages and stillborn babies. With weakened immune systems they fell prey to infections and diseases which in normal times would have been easily overcome but became fatal for people so weakened. There were outbreaks of typhoid and of polio, a disease then practically unknown in Malta. Their death certificates may show statements such as ”death from natural causes ” or “death from this disease or that” but really they were war casualties.
