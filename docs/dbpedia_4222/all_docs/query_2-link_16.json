        "text": "The context\n\nConflict in North Africa had been ignited in 1940 by Italy’s invasion of Egypt from its colony of Libya. This threatened Britain’s vital strategic assets, the Suez Canal and Persian oil fields. However, when the Italians were defeated, Germany intervened on behalf of its ally in the spring of 1941.\n\nUnder the bold leadership of General Rommel, the Axis enjoyed startling successes, recapturing Libya and threatening Egypt. Yet, by late 1941, when Rommel’s forces had overstretched their supply lines, they were forced to fall back in the face of a determined British offensive. The following year, a revived Axis effort saw Rommel defeat the British at Gazala and capture Tobruk.\n\nStand at El Alamein\n\nFor a while it seemed that Rommel would link up with the Germans advancing in the Caucasus and so overrun the whole Middle East. The British conducted a chaotic retreat into Egypt, but rallied their battered army and made a stand at the First Battle of El Alamein. This was a position that, unlike others in the desert, could not be turned by a flanking manoeuvre. It bordered both the Mediterranean and the Qattara Depression, a sea of quicksand impassable to mechanised forces.\n\nThe summer of 1942 saw the defeat of Rommel’s final efforts to break through into Egypt. The initiative now lay with the British. They planned another offensive that would finally end the Axis threat to the Middle East.\n\nThe consequences\n\nEl Alamein was the first clear-cut and irreversible victory inflicted by the British Army upon the Axis. Coming after years of frustrating setbacks, this was a boost to British morale. Victory proved that the problems that had plagued the Army for years had at last been overcome and that its equipment, tactics, generalship and fighting spirit were a match for the Axis.\n\nFor Churchill, the victory was vital for re-establishing British prestige before America reduced Britain to the role of junior partner in the western alliance. This was why he had been so anxious to instigate the battle before the start of Operation Torch, the Allied landings on the coast of Algeria and Morocco.\n\nVictory\n\nThe landings began on 8 November and forced the Axis to fight on two fronts. With the Allies also prevailing in the naval and air wars raging in the Mediterranean, the Axis position in North Africa was now untenable.\n\nDespite this, Hitler belatedly ordered a massive re-enforcement, which enabled the Axis to fight a defensive campaign in Tunisia into 1943. Although they fought a tenacious rearguard, the Axis forces were in an impossible position. In May, they were forced to surrender, with the loss of around 240,000 prisoners."
