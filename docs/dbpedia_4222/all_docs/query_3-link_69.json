        "text": "Cone snails are marine gastropods characterized by a conical shell and beautiful color patterns. Cone snails possess a harpoonlike tooth capable of injecting a potent neurotoxin that can be dangerous to humans.\n\nThere are about 600 species of cone snails, all of which are poisonous. Cone snails live in shallow reefs partially buried under sandy sediment, rocks or coral in tropical and subtropical waters. Some species have adapted to colder waters.\n\nMechanisms of Injury\n\nInjuries typically occur when the animal is handled. Cone snails administer stings by extending a long flexible tube called a proboscis and then firing a venomous, harpoonlike tooth (radula).\n\nSigns and Symptoms\n\nA cone snail sting can cause mild to moderate pain, and the area may develop other signs of an acute inflammatory reaction such as redness and swelling. Conus toxins affect the nervous system and are capable of causing paralysis, which may lead to respiratory failure and death.\n\nPrevention\n\nIf you see a beautiful cone-shaped marine snail, it is probably a cone snail. It’s difficult to tell whether a cone snail is inhabiting a given shell, as they are able to hide deep inside them. Since all cone snails are venomous, err on the side of safety, and do not touch it.\n\nFirst Aid\n\nUnfortunately there is no specific treatment for cone-snail envenomations. First aid focuses on controlling pain but may not influence outcomes. Envenomation will not necessarily be fatal, but depending on the species, the amount of venom injected, and the victim’s size and susceptibility, complete paralysis may occur, and this may lead to death. Cone snail venom is a mixture of many different substances, including tetrodotoxin (TTX).\n\nThe prevalence and incidence of cone snail envenomations are unknown but probably rare in divers and the general population. Shell collectors (professional or amateur) may be at higher risk.\n\nClean the wound with fresh water, and provide care for the small puncture wound.\n\nApply a pressure immobilization bandage. Application of heat might help with pain management, but since TTX is a heat-stable toxin, the application of heat will not denature the toxin.\n\nWatch for signs and symptoms of progressive paralysis.\n\nBe prepared to provide mechanical ventilations with a bag valve mask or a manually triggered ventilator.\n\nDo not wait for signs and symptoms of paralysis. Always seek an evaluation at the nearest emergency department. The bite site might be painless and still be lethally toxic.\n\nImplications in Diving"
