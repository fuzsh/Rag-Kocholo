        "text": "Exciting news! üöÄ SkyCell is thrilled to announce the closure of its US$116 million Series D funding round, with US$59 million coming from Tybourne Capital Management and CC Industries, Inc (CCI). This follows a US$57 million equity investment from Catalyst, M&G Investments‚Äô purpose-led private assets strategy. The investment will fuel the continued expansion of SkyCell‚Äôs global footprint, focusing particularly on growth in the US and Asia. SkyCell‚Äôs Chief Financial Officer, Dr. Remo Gerber, commented, ‚ÄúGaining CCI and Tybourne as investors significantly broadens our footprint in the US and Asia and is testament to our high growth based on strong financial fundamentals. Having established technological foundations in cold chain hardware, software, and IoT-enabled tracking, this investment enables us to commercialize our platform into adjacent pharma market segments, significantly expanding our total addressable market beyond cold chain packaging.‚Äù Read the full announcement below: https://lnkd.in/eKzBHHxV... #announcement #fundraising #investors #businessgrowth #Supplychain\n\nüè° Real Estate Game-Changer! ‚ú® Ever wondered if you could handle property deals solo? One of our students just proved it's possible. Started with a contract, faced zero tenant responses, but didn't give up! üöÄ Instead of relying on our fund, they raised their own, showcasing true scaling potential. Success story alert: They even got investors on board and partnered with Veribest for a sweet deal on onboarding fees. Scaling up, setting up funds, and making big moves in real estate! üåü #RealEstateJourney #InvestSmart #ScaleUp #SuccessStories #VeribestPartnership #SyndicationAttorneys\n\nHow Semil Shah increased Haystack‚Äôs check sizes from $25k to $1m+ over time: Fund 1: $25k Fund 2: $50k - $100k Fund 3: $100k - $250k Fund 4: $500k - $1m He borrows the phrase ‚ÄúCrawl. Walk. Run.‚Äù from Chris Douvos to describe this. Crawl: Semil had great deal flow, but needed to prove he could convert that to allocation. He started by writing small checks ($25k) out of his very first fund (which he initially started as a proof of concept to get a job at another VC firm). Walk: Once he proved he could actually participate in the deal flow he was seeing, he then had to prove founders would give him meaningful allocation ($50-500k) while scaling his fund size appropriately. Run: Today on Fund 7, Haystack is consistently investing up to $1m with each Pre-Seed and Seed check (it also helps that he‚Äôs invested in 16 unicorns). Its important to remember this didn‚Äôt happen overnight, but was a long journey and much harder than it appears from the outside. To hear the inside story of how Semil built Haystack, grab a link to our full conversation in the comments üëá\n\nWe did it! SaleSqueze raised $1.5 million in our Seed Round! üöÄ A huge shoutout to our lead investor Underline Ventures and our amazing supporters Robin Capital, Fortech Investments, superangels üòá , Klub20, Xenia Muntean, Christoph Zoeller, and Bjoern W. Schaefer. Your belief in our vision means the world to us! The future of selling complex products online looks bright. ‚ú®Stay tuned for our next steps!

Follow ALT Investor to stay updated! #ALTXtra\n\nOne way to make fundraising easier for foundersüëá 1. Form relationships with several investors that match their thesis. 2. Keep them updated monthly - product updates, growth, movement, product market fit. 3. Disarm them by letting them know you are not currently raising but keeping them in the loop. Then, when it‚Äôs time to raise, It's not a surprise. The conversation is quicker, there's more trust and historical data to digest. We see this strategy working for several of our portfolio companies, play the long game. #founders #founderjourney #founder"
