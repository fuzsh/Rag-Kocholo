        "text": "Ukraine has started receiving Harpoon anti-ship missiles from Denmark and self-propelled howitzers from the United States, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on May 28.\n\n\"The coastal defense of our country will not only be strengthened by Harpoon missiles -- they will be used by trained Ukrainian teams,\" Reznikov wrote on his Facebook page.\n\nHe said Harpoon shore-to-ship missiles would be operated alongside Ukrainian Neptune missiles to defend Ukraine's Black Sea, including the southern port of Odesa.\n\nThe Harpoon is an all-weather, over-the-horizon, anti-ship missile that uses active radar homing and flies just above the water to evade defenses. It can be launched from ships, submarines, aircraft, or coastal batteries.\n\nRussia has blockaded Ukrainian ports, hampering vital grain exports, and used its Black Sea fleet to launch missile attacks against Ukrainian cities.\n\nReznikov said Ukraine had also received a range of heavy artillery pieces, including modified U.S.-made M109 self-propelled howitzers that will allow the Ukrainian military to strike targets from longer distances.\n\nUkraine has said it wants to secure deliveries of U.S.-made long-range M270 multiple-rocket launchers (MLRS) to beef up its defense in the east, where Russia has been mounting an increasingly aggressive offensive backed by indiscriminate artillery fire that has provoked huge damage and killed hundreds of civilians.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nThe former editor in chief of Novaya Gazeta and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dmitry Muratov has called on the Red Cross to intervene to alleviate the situation of Aleksei Gorinov, who is serving a 7-year sentence that rights groups and his supporters say is politically motivated.\n\nGorinov, 63, a former Moscow municipal lawmaker, was sentenced in July 2022 for spreading \"fake news\" about the Russian military because of his stance in opposition to Russia's aggression against Ukraine.\n\nIn November 2023, a new criminal case was opened against him for \"justifying terrorism.\"\n\nMuratov sent the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Mirjana Spoljaric-Egger, a request to assist in providing medical assistance to Gorinov.\n\n\"The consequences of inaction are obvious. I ask you, Ms. Spoljaric, to facilitate the provision of medical assistance and to intervene to stop the torture of Aleksei Gorinov by authorities. I again ask you for an urgent inspection by the Red Cross into places where internationally recognized political prisoners are held in Russia and Belarus,\" Novaya Gazeta quotes Muratov's letter as saying.\n\nNovaya Gazeta writes that Gorinov was not issued a mattress or blanket, does not have hot water or a working toilet, and is deprived of books, letters, and phone calls. The publication says that due to his complete isolation, Gorinov has begun to forget words.\n\n\"He is facing a second sentence -- in a case regarding conversations he had with cellmates in which he allegedly justified terrorism,\" Novaya Gazeta writes, adding that the accusation is based on false testimonies by other prisoners.\n\n\"The word of a criminal against the word of a political prisoner is, of course, more significant; Gorinov will be given an extra sentence. He will certainly not live to see the end of it,\" Novaya Gazeta writes.\n\nGorinov was the first individual to receive a prison term under the article on the dissemination of \"fake\" information about the Russian military, which was added to the Russian Criminal Code after the start of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nGorinov underwent surgery to remove part of one lung in 2016. His support group has repeatedly reported on his health problems in prison.\n\nUkrainian drones set an oil depot in Russia's Rostov region on fire early on August 28, the governor of the southern Russian region, Vasily Golubev, confirmed on Telegram, following earlier reports on Russian Telegram channels.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nA strong explosion occurred before the fire broke out at the depot located close to the village of Molodezhny in Rostov's Kamensky district, reports on Telegram said.\n\n\"In the Kamensky district, as a result of a drone attack, a fire broke out at a fuel depot. There are no casualties. Emergency response forces are involved in the extinguishing the blaze. There is no threat of fire spreading to residential buildings,\" Golubev wrote on Telegram.\n\nGolubev said earlier that four drones had been shot down by Russian air defense systems above his region.\n\nBaza, a Telegram channel with close ties to Russia's security services said debris from two drones ignited a fire at three storage tanks in the Kamensky district.\n\nVideos posted on Telegram purported to show what appeared to be large fuel tanks burning in the dark.\n\nUkraine has not commented on the information, which could not be independently confirmed immediately.\n\nUkraine, whose civilian and energy infrastructure has been battered by relentless Russian strikes since the start of Moscow's unprovoked invasion in February 2022, has in turn resorted in recent months to targeting oil and fuel installations inside Russia that mainly work for the military.\n\nIn another Rostov district, Proletarsk, fuel tanks were reportedly still on fire some 10 days after they were hit by Ukrainian drones.\n\nIn the southwestern Voronezh region, Governor Aleksandr Gusev reported a fire \"near explosive objects,\" likely an ammunition depot.\n\n\"Air defense forces in the Rossoshansk district spotted and destroyed an aircraft-type unmanned aerial vehicle...The fall of fragments of the drone caused a fire near explosive objects. There was no detonation,\" Gusev wrote on Telegram.\n\nHe said there were no casualties among civilians, but the residents of two nearby villages had been evacuated by bus as a precaution,\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian military said it had shot down a Russian Su-25 plane in Kramatorsk, in the eastern region of Donetsk.\n\n\"In the direction of Kramatorsk, our military shot down a Russian Su-25 aircraft that was trying to fire at the positions of units of the Defense Forces. Antiaircraft forces employed \"a well-aimed shot from a MANPADS system,\" to destroy the plane, the military said in a statement.\n\nMANPADS (Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems) are lightweight and highly mobile antiaircraft weapons.\n\nIn Ukraine's southern region of Zaporizhzhya, a Russian drone attack killed three people, two women, and a man, the region's Governor Ivan Fedorov said.\n\n\"Two women aged 83 and 86 and a 61-year-old man died, three more women aged 19, 30, 56, and a 59-year-old man were wounded as a result of a Russian drone attack,\" Fedorov said.\n\nAfghanistan is one of the largest recipients of humanitarian aid from the European Union, EU officials said on August 27, one day after saying it was appalled by a new decree issued by the Taliban-led government further restricting the lives of women.\n\nThe European Union this year has provided 125 million euros ($139 million) to Afghanistan for humanitarian-aid purposes, Balazs Ujvari, European Commission spokesman for budget, human resources, humanitarian aid, and crisis management, said at a European Commission news briefing in Brussels.\n\nIn addition to classic aid distribution, the EU has also organized 35 “air-bridge” flights carrying 1,600 tons of aid since 2021.\n\n“This shows that in a broad variety of areas, we are deploying a variety of humanitarian and civil-protection tools as well to try and alleviate the ongoing difficulties in the country,\" Ujvari said.\n\nEuropean Commission chief spokesman Eric Mamer added that when the EU distributes humanitarian aid, it works with partner organizations, not the government.\n\nNabila Massrali, spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, said the EU reacted very quickly on August 26 to the Taliban’s so-called Law on the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, but at the same time she defended keeping ties with the Taliban.\n\n“When it comes to the engagement with the Taliban, we do maintain contact...to allow the dialogue for political priories of the EU and to ensure that the EU can provide support to the Afghan people, and this is very important,” she said at the briefing. “The EU engagement with the Taliban is not an acknowledgement of legitimacy.”\n\nIn addition to saying it was appalled by the August 26 decree, the EU statement called it a “serious blow undermining the rights of Afghan women and girls, which we cannot tolerate.”\n\nThe decree imposes further restrictive dress codes for women and says that voices of women must not be heard in public, “which effectively deprives Afghan women of their fundamental right to freedom of expression,” the EU statement said.\n\nThe European Union said the decree, issued on the third anniversary of a suicide bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport that killed 13 U.S. soldiers and scores of Afghans during the chaotic U.S. withdrawal, also gives the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice a mandate to enforce it.\n\n“This, together with the restrictions imposed, punishable under Taliban law, violates legal obligations and treaties to which Afghanistan is a state party, including by undermining Afghan people’s right to due process,” the EU statement said.\n\nIt also noted that the decree creates another obstacle to normalized relations and recognition by the international community -- goals that the Taliban publicly aspires to.\n\nTBILISI -- Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili has called the country's upcoming parliamentary elections a \"choice between Europe and Russia\" for the South Caucasus nation.\n\nZurabishvili's statement came after she signed a decree announcing October 26, the last Saturday of October, as the day for the parliamentary polls, saying that voters will have to \"choose between war and peace\" in the election.\n\n\"The day of the decision, the day of choice, the day of survival is coming,\" Zurabishvili said, stressing that the election will be \"existential\" for the former Soviet republic and will \"define the country's destiny for many years to come.\"\n\n\"Nobody in Georgia wants a war, and nobody is planning it.... The choice will be between being Russia's slave or cooperation with Europe,\" Zurabishvili added.\n\nDespite Georgia's longtime aspiration to join NATO and the European Union, the government's relationship with the West has been going downhill in recent years amid Tbilisi's visible turn toward Russia.\n\nBrussels has paused ongoing EU accession negotiations with Tbilisi and the United States has undertaken a \"comprehensive review\" of relations with Georgia over the controversial \"foreign agent law\" that was recently adopted by the Georgian government -- which is ruled by the Georgian Dream party of billionaire former Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili -- amid fierce protests.\n\n\"The choice will be between obedience to Russia via miserable concessions and actual selling the soul to Russia and being an equal state in Europe, promoting our identity, history, talents, and opportunities -- Georgia's adequate representation in a free and peaceful environment. There will not be a second chance,\" Zurabishvili said.\n\nGeorgia's civil society has for years sought to move the country away from the influence of Russia, which still maintains thousands of troops in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two breakaway Georgian regions that Moscow recognized as independent states following a five-day war with Tbilisi in 2008.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Kyiv has conducted its first test of a domestically produced ballistic missile as Russia unleashed a second day of deadly strikes on across Ukraine.\n\nZelenskiy also said at a news conference following a forum in Kyiv on August 27 that the war with Russia would eventually end in dialogue, but that Kyiv had to be in a strong position.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nZelenskiy said he hoped to go to the United States in September to attend the UN General Assembly in New York and meet U.S. President Joe Biden and present a plan to end the war. Kyiv's incursion into Russia's Kursk region is part of that plan, but it also includes other steps on the economic and diplomatic fronts, he said.\n\n\"The main point of this plan is to force Russia to end the war,\" he said, adding that he wants it to be fair for Ukraine.\n\nHe did not elaborate on the next steps but said he would also discuss the plan with Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate running for president, and probably also with former U.S. President Donald Trump, the Republican candidate.\n\nHis announcements came as Ukraine has been pleading with its Western allies to remove their ban on Kyiv using weapons they supplied to attack military targets deep inside Russia in order to prevent Moscow's forces from destroying civilian and energy infrastructure.\n\nUkraine has also said it is working on developing the Hrim-2 short-range ballistic missile system, which is designed to combine the features of a tactical missile system and a multiple rocket launcher.\n\nLast weekend Zelenskiy also confirmed the existence of the domestically produced Palianytsia missile, which he called a \"new class\" of weapon for Ukraine.\n\nZelenskiy spoke hours after at least five people were killed and several more were wounded in a second massive drone and missile attack by Russia on Ukraine in as many days.\n\nIn Russia's Kursk, where fighting has been under way since August 6 when Ukrainian forces launched a shock incursion into Russian territory, Rafael Grossi, the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear agency, visited the Kurchatov nuclear plant amid fears about the atomic installation's safety.\n\nGrossi said after the visit that there was a risk of \"nuclear incident\" at the plant, where the situation was serious.\n\nThe Kurchatov plant is situated some 60 kilometers from the Ukrainian border on the banks of the Seym River, where there has been heavy fighting for the past three weeks.\n\nSeparately, the Ukrainian military's top commander, General Oleksandr Syrskiy, said that his forces now control 1,294 square kilometers and 100 settlements in Kursk. He also said Ukrainian troops have taken a total of 594 Russian prisoners during the ongoing operation in Kursk.\n\nAs Russia launched another wave of strikes, the Ukrainian Air Force said it had shot down a total of 60 drones and 5 missiles early on August 27.\n\nThe fresh wave of attacks prompted an all-out air-raid alert declared for the whole of Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian aviation expert Valeriy Romanenko told RFE/RL that the recent massive air strikes that Russia has launched are meant to exceed the capabilities of Ukraine's antiaircraft missile systems.\n\nRockets fly in a \"bunch\" and appear to air-defense systems be just one rocket, Romanenko said. The air-defense system launches a single rocket, but there is not one but five or six to shoot down.\n\nRomanenko also pointed out that the Russians are using X-101 missiles, which have a range of almost 5,500 kilometers.\n\n\"The Russians take advantage of this and plan trajectories in such a way as to avoid the positions of antiaircraft missile systems as much as possible,\" he told Current Time, the Russian-language network run by RFE/RL. They also use variations in the terrain where possible, programming the rockets to pass undetected behind hills and other topography and make many turns without losing the target.\n\nIn the latest wave of Russian missiles strikes, a hotel in Kryviy Rih in the southern region of Dnipropetrovsk was hit. Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram that a man and a woman had been killed and five people were wounded.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:00:49 0:00\n\nLocal officials also said that two people had been killed in overnight Russian strikes in the southern region of Zaporizhzhya.\n\nIn the northeastern region of Kharkiv, a Russian missile killed one person and wounded another five, regional Governor Oleh Synyehubov said on Telegram.\n\nIn the Khmelnytskiy region, eight Russian drones were shot down, but a person was wounded during the attack, regional Governor Serhiy Tyurin said on Telegram.\n\nAir defense systems shot down all 15 drones that attacked Kyiv, the administration of the Ukrainian capital said, adding that a fire broke out due to falling debris in a forest park in the city's Dnipro district.\n\nVyacheslav Gladkov, the governor or Russia's Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, claimed early on August 27 that the situation was challenging but manageable in the area amid an attempted incursion by Ukrainian troops.\n\n\"According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the situation on the border remains difficult, but under control. Our military is carrying out planned work. I ask you to remain calm and trust only official sources of information,\" Gladkov wrote on Telegram. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine on Gladkov's claim.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) has accused authorities in Kazakhstan of violating international human rights law by \"misusing\" extremism and terrorism legislation to target peaceful government critics and others.\n\nThe rights group said in a 29-page report issued on August 27 that that those placed on Kazakhstan’s Financing Terrorism List face financial restrictions that cause them \"significant hardship\" and lead to \"violations\" of their guaranteed rights.\n\nThe situation \"is particularly egregious when the prosecutions are for alleged nonviolent “extremist” or “terrorist” crimes, that should not be considered crimes in the first place,\" it added.\n\n\"If you participate in peaceful antigovernment protests in Kazakhstan, not only can the government prosecute you as an ‘extremist,’ but it can cut you off financially,\" HRW's senior Central Asia researcher Mihra Rittman said in the report.\n\n\"Kazakhstan should immediately end its pernicious use of extremism and terrorism laws against peaceful critics and others and remove anyone currently on the Financing Terrorism List who has been convicted of nonviolent crimes.”\n\nAccording to HRW, the tightly controlled former Soviet republic's laws do not distinguish between violent and nonviolent extremism and multiple articles in the Criminal Code relating to extremism and terrorism are vaguely worded and overly broad.\n\nThe Central Asian nation's authorities automatically place on the list of groups or individuals financing terrorism or extremism any person convicted on charges that they deem to be \"extremist\" or \"terrorist\" regardless of whether the person instigated, took part in, or financially supported violence.\n\n\"Kazakhstan authorities should revise the criminal code’s provisions on extremism and terrorism so that they have sufficient precision to guarantee legal certainty. Kazakhstan also should not criminalize legitimate exercise of freedoms of speech, expression, and association, or violate other rights protected by international law, HRW's statement said.\n\nIran’s pro-reform President Masud Pezeshkian has appointed lawmaker Abdolkarim Hosseinzadeh as his deputy for rural development and underprivileged areas.\n\nThe appointment, announced late on August 26, makes Hosseinzadeh the first-ever Sunni cabinet member in an Iranian government since the Islamic republic came to power in 1979.\n\nIn his decree, Pezeshkian said he tapped Hosseinzadeh for the job because of his “commitment and valuable experiences.”\n\nPezeshkian tasked his deputy with enhancing the living conditions in villages and “improving the indicators of rural development.”\n\nHosseinzadeh, 44, has been representing the northwestern cities of Naqadeh and Oshnavieh in parliament since 2012.\n\nSunni Muslims make up around 5-10 percent of the population in Shi'ite-majority Iran, according to government estimates. They have very rarely held key posts since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nAfter winning the July 5 runoff presidential election, Pezeshkian said he sought to form a “national unity” government. Members of his team later said that included naming a relatively young cabinet which represented Iran’s ethnic and religious diversity.\n\nBut Pezeshkian came under fire for failing to include members of underrepresented groups, including Sunni Muslims, in his proposed ministerial picks earlier this month.\n\nAll 19 ministerial nominees were approved by the conservative-dominated parliament last week in a move not seen since 2001.\n\nAhead of the vote of confidence in the cabinet, Pezeshkian told lawmakers that he had selected its members in “coordination” with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. This led many to conclude that Pezeshkian’s cabinet had been picked by the supreme leader and lamented what they said were the limits of the president’s powers in Iran.\n\nPezeshkian’s cabinet also includes three women, including Roads Minister Farzaneh Sadeq, who is only the second woman in the Islamic republic’s history to be named a minister.\n\nThe other two women are Zahra Behruz-Azar, Pezeshkian’s deputy for women and family affairs, and Shina Ansari, a deputy to the president and head of the Department of the Environment.\n\nThe Basmanny district court in Russia sentenced former Ukrainian Ambassador to Kazakhstan Petro Vrublevskiy in absentia to six years in prison on August 26 on a charge of inciting ethnic hatred.\n\nEarlier this year, Russian authorities issued an arrest warrant for Vrublevskiy and placed him on the country's registry of terrorists and extremists.\n\nVrublevskiy found himself at the center of a scandal in August 2022 -- about six months after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine -- after he said in an interview with noted Kazakh blogger Dias Kuzairov that \"the more Russians we kill now, the fewer of them our children will have to kill in the future.\"\n\nMoscow and Russian organizations in Kazakhstan then demanded that Astana expel the diplomat for his controversial statement, but Kazakh authorities refused, though they did ask Kyiv to replace him.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in early October 2022 that Moscow was \"outraged\" by the fact that Vrublevskiy remained in Kazakhstan, adding that the Kazakh ambassador to Russia had been summoned over the issue.\n\nIn response, the Kazakh Foreign Ministry said that the tone of Moscow’s request to expel the Ukrainian ambassador was \"dissonant to the character of the allied mutual ties between Kazakhstan and Russia as equal strategic partners.\"\n\nThe Kazakh side also said at the time that Astana and Kyiv have a \"full understanding\" of the situation and that a decision on the diplomat leaving Kazakhstan would be made solely by Kyiv.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy sacked Vrublevskiy in mid-October 2022.\n\nThe Kazakh government under President Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev has been trying to juggle its good ties with Ukraine, its Western allies, and Russia since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhile not openly condemning Russia’s aggression, Toqaev has publicly stated that his country would not recognize Russian-occupied entities in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions.\n\nKazakh businesses last year set up so called \"invincibility\" yurts (traditional nomadic felt tents) in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and several other Ukrainian cities, to provide local residents with food, tea, warmth, and the possibility of charging electronic devices.\n\nWith reporting by Interfax and TASS\n\nAt least 4 people were killed while several others were either wounded or missing on August 27 in a second massive drone and missile Russian attack on Ukraine in as many days that included a strike on a hotel in Kryviy Rih, in the southern region of Dnipropetrovsk.\n\nThe fresh wave of attacks came as Rafael Grossi, the chief of the UN nuclear agency, was expected to visit the Russian nuclear plant in Kursk, where fighting has been under way since August 6, when Ukrainian forces launched a shock incursion into Russian territory.\n\nDnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram on August 27 that a man and a woman had been killed in the overnight missile attack on the Kryviy Rih hotel. \"5 were wounded, a 43-year-old woman is in a severe state,\" Lysak said, adding that the fate of two more people was unknown, and they could still be under the rubble.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:00:49 0:00\n\nLysak said that four high-rise buildings and several shops were also damaged in the attack.

Every leader, every one of our partners, knows the decisive actions required to end this war justly,\" he added, while calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a \"sick creature.\"\n\nThe detention of Pavel Durov, the Russian-born co-founder and CEO of the Telegram messaging app, has been extended by a French investigative judge until August 28 as Moscow expressed outrage over what it said appeared to be \"a direct attempt to restrict freedom of communication.\"\n\nDurov, a billionaire who holds citizenships from Russia, France, the United Arab Emirates, and the Caribbean island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, was detained at Le Bourget airport outside Paris on August 24 and held for questioning. The Paris prosecutor's office said late on August 26 that Durov's detention order was extended for 48 hours, meaning he must be charged or set free by August 28.\n\nFrance's OFMIN, an office tasked with preventing violence against minors, has reportedly issued an arrest warrant for Durov in a preliminary investigation into alleged offenses, including fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, organized crime, and the promotion of terrorism.\n\nTelegram has said that Durov “has nothing to hide” and that it is “awaiting a prompt resolution of this situation.\"\n\nIn Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on August 27 that the allegations against Durov were “very serious” and that “they require evidence that is just as serious” to erase the suspicions of many that the billionaire's arrest was politically motivated.\n\nWithout substantial evidence, \"we are witnessing a direct attempt to restrict freedom of communication and, one might even say, direct intimidation of the head of a large company,” Peskov said.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has tried to allay such suspicion, saying on August 26 that Durov's arrest was solely part of an independent investigation.\n\nIn a post on X, Macron said France “is deeply committed” to freedom of expression but that “freedoms are upheld within a legal framework, both on social media and in real life, to protect citizens and respect their fundamental rights.”\n\nDubai-based Telegram boasts more than 900 million users worldwide. In his first major interview in seven years, which he gave to U.S. conservative media figure Tucker Carlson on April 17, Durov vowed that Telegram aims to be a \"neutral platform\" and not a \"player in geopolitics.\"\n\nCritics in Ukraine, however, say it spreads misinformation and facilitates illegal actions. Some accuse Telegram of having ties to the Russian state and of contributing to its war effort.\n\nDespite its critics, there is “no such decision [to close Telegram] being prepared by the National Security and Defense Council,” Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, a Ukrainian lawmaker from the opposition Holos party and the chairman of the Committee on Freedom of Speech in Ukraine's parliament, said August 26.\n\nYurchyshyn told RFE/RL that Ukraine plans to monitor the situation for now and added that the blocking of Telegram in Ukraine is still possible.\n\n“We understand that the French are considering accusations of promoting terrorism, and this has greatly worried the Russian authorities because communication [on Telegram] is not only about military operations in Ukraine,” Yurchyshyn said.\n\nHe noted that communications about the Wagner Group’s special operations in the Central African Republic or other African countries in which France has influence have also taken place on Telegram.\n\n“That is, most likely, the French special services receive additional information that may be of interest to our special services,” he said.\n\nAccess to Telegram was temporarily restricted by Russia in 2018. The decision was made after the messaging app allegedly refused to provide Russia's FSB security agency with encryption keys from users' correspondence, citing the secrecy of correspondence guaranteed by the Russian Constitution.\n\nThe decision to block was sharply criticized by many Russian public figures, as well as critics of the Russian government. However, independent Russian media reports indicated that Telegram reached a compromise with the authorities and has been sharing some data with the security services for several years, although that has been denied by Telegram.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said on August 26 that the arrest of Pavel Durov, the Russian-born co-founder and CEO of the Telegram messaging app, was not political.\n\n“The arrest of the president of Telegram on French soil took place as part of an ongoing judicial investigation,” Macron said on X. \"It is up to the judges to rule on the matter.\"\n\nDurov was detained at the Bourget airport outside Paris on August 24 and was still being held for questioning on August 26. Telegram issued a statement on X on August 25 saying that Durov “has nothing to hide” and that Telegram is “awaiting a prompt resolution of this situation.\"\n\nFrench media reported that France's OFMIN, an office tasked with preventing violence against minors, had issued an arrest warrant for Durov in a preliminary investigation into alleged offenses, including fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, organized crime, and the promotion of terrorism.\n\n“At the heart of this issue is the lack of moderation and cooperation of the platform (which has nearly 1 billion users), particularly in the fight against pedophilia,” Jean-Michel Bernigaud, the head of OFMIN, confirmed in a LinkedIn post.\n\nDubai-based Telegram boasts more than 900 million users worldwide.
