        "text": "In the months leading up to Pearl Harbor, promising research involves the use of a proximity fuze—one that would detonate a shell near an approaching aircraft, without a direct hit. In January 1942, prototype fuzes are tested at a secret Navy facility located on a Southern Maryland farm. Installed in five-inch anti-aircraft shells and fired vertically into the sky, 52 percent of the shells survive the firing impact and maintain radio transmission during the flight.\n\nThe Lab perfects and fields one of America’s most closely guarded secrets of World War II—the radio proximity fuze. The fuze uses a small proximity sensor to detect when it is near the target, then triggers detonation. The device is judged by historians as one of the three most important developments of the war, along with radar and the atomic bomb. This annotated cutaway photo of the Mk-45 fuze shows its internal structure and key components.\n\nIn late 1944, Director Merle Tuve spots a poster like this hanging in a Navy office. The poster inspires Tuve—who is well aware that he and his team face a challenge to develop a guided missile—to name the program Bumblebee.\n\nIn a letter to the chief of ordnance at the War Department, General George Patton describes the effectiveness of the fuze in ground combat during the Battle of the Bulge in 1944.\n\nOn a June morning—at 3 a.m.—engineers pause to mark the first successful operation of the Ordnance Aerophysics Laboratory wind tunnel in Daingerfield, Texas. Test section design and tunnel operation are under the direction of Al Eaton, standing fifth from right.\n\nJames Van Allen and APL colleagues load captured German V-2 rockets with cameras and other instruments to measure cosmic radiation in Earth’s atmosphere. Launched from White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico, their experiments produce the first images of Earth as seen from space. APL engineer and camera developer Clyde Holliday tells National Geographic in 1950 that the photos show for the first time “how our Earth would look to visitors from another planet coming in on a spaceship.”\n\nThis is humankind’s first view of the curvature of the Earth, a composite of a photo sequence shot approximately 60 miles above the surface by an APL camera installed on a V-2 rocket, launched July 26, 1948.\n\nTo perform the calculations needed for the increasingly complex technologies and analyses being developed at the Lab, APL acquires a Reeves electronic analog computer in 1948, becoming one of the few institutions outside of the government to do so. This early computer easily outperforms mechanical differential analyzers of the time and is used to evaluate and assess the performance of many systems.\n\nAPL is given the high-priority task of rapidly transforming its supersonic test vehicle, STV-3, with its solid rocket motor, into a working interim shipboard weapon system. The successful launch of this fixed-wing control test vehicle lays the foundation for the guidance, flight stabilization, and aerodynamics of future high-speed missiles.\n\nTelemetering—the means by which a remote station can receive data and monitor information from a device—is a new field of paramount importance for the development of guided missiles. A success rate of 99.4% accuracy is achieved during flight tests.\n\nIn January 1953, APL oversees successful at-sea tests of the Terrier aboard USS Mississippi, prompting the Navy to immediately put the missiles into large-scale production. The Terrier missile roars off the aft launcher of USS Mississippi (BB 41), which is modified in 1952 to carry two dual-arm middle launchers to permit testing of Terrier under more realistic at-sea conditions.\n\nCannonball missiles, conceived by APL’s Randolph Rae, are 15–22 inches in diameter and weigh between 150 and 300 pounds. They can be fired at a speed of 500–800 miles per hour. Each of the three Cannonball missiles designed, developed, and built at the Lab carries two types of warheads and is created to destroy oncoming tanks. APL constructs approximately 50 Cannonballs, officially known as the D-40 A, B, and C missiles, between 1953 and 1956. Production of the costly Cannonball is cancelled in the late 1950s as it is deemed both too expensive and too bulky to operate in combat.\n\nAl Eaton’s wind tunnel launch supports the Bumblebee research program to develop a supersonic missile to defend Navy ships. It yields test results confirming Eaton’s explanation of the phenomena that lead to “reverse roll” control failures for the first flight-test vehicles, and provides data validating his proposed solution for the production of Terrier missiles. This is instrumental in the development of the aerodynamic design still in use today, with all control elements at the rear of the missile and small dorsal fins replacing large wings.\n\nTwo young APL physicists, William Guier and George Weiffenbach, develop the first successful method of tracking satellites. Using an available 20-MHz receiver, the physicists carefully observe and record the Doppler shift in signals that Sputnik transmitted. By analyzing the signals and converting them into precise orbital data, APL is able to track Sputnik.\n\nAPL invents the world’s first Doppler-based, all-weather, satellite navigation system: Transit. Wilfred Zimmerman (left), David Moss, and James Smola test a mechanism designed to prevent the Transit 1A satellite from spinning while in orbit. Building on the work of William Guier and George Weiffenbach—two young APL physicists who accurately determined Sputnik’s orbit and developed a method for tracking satellites—the group realizes that if the satellite’s orbit is known, the inverse equation can pinpoint locations anywhere on the Earth’s surface within the satellite’s coverage.\n\nStuart Ball (left) and John Long use Air Battle Analyzer nomographs to correlate horizontal, vertical, and time perspectives of a tactical situation. Created to address naval anti-air-warfare issues, the Air Battle Analyzer is the first computer-supported air defense planning tool. Dr. Mathews C. Waddell considers the feasibility of an experimental model or board upon which all of the information could be charted, logged, and moved about in a kind of game. Spread out, the display covers a third of an office wall, ceiling to floor, and looks much like a plotting board that combat commanders use to follow battles. Folded, it fits well into a mapping case, and is known as the air battle analyzer.\n\nA Polaris prototype streaks skyward from a launcher aboard USS Observation Island off Cape Canaveral. The support ship also houses a complete missile tracking and instrumentation suite and serves as a second home for teams of APL Polaris missile analysts for many years.\n\nJohn Chubbuck (right) with \"the Hopkins Beast\" and Leonard Scheer with \"Ferdinand,\" early APL robots, or \"automatons.\" The APL scientists building robots in the early 1960s want to create a machine that can operate without human assistance in a natural environment, rather than in one constructed especially for it. Based on the state of electronics and artificial intelligence at the time, the robots’ sole purpose is to survive by navigating APL’s hallways. And survive they do: Using touch-sensor systems, the cylindrical Beast and its older, smaller, square-shaped “brother” Ferdinand avoid doorjambs, vending machines, stairs, open doorways, and other obstacles to locate electrical outlets and recharge their batteries.\n\nIn the first peacetime test of the Fleet Ballistic Missile combined submarine system, the submerged USS George Washington fires two Polaris missiles off Cape Canaveral, Florida. According to The APL News, \"The missiles accurately delivered their payloads through space to a target many miles down range. Naval efforts of this significance are historically scarce for this operation married space to sea power. This system will be deployed in the months to come and will significantly add to the ballistic power balance in the Free World.\"\n\nIn the 1960s, APL develops a phased-array radar concept for the Navy that brings together all elements of anti-aircraft warfare. The earliest design grouped together a number of antenna “feeds” via a special microwave lens to transmit and receive multiple signals simultaneously. Through this work, APL also introduces a practical way to filter out clutter and jamming. Most importantly, the Lab’s multifunction phased-array radar is designed to guide twenty U.S. missiles to multiple targets at the same time. Its capabilities are so formidable that the Navy names it Typhon, after the monstrous giant and most deadly being of Greek mythology.\n\nFrom The APL News: \"Women of BGP receive, relay combat orders and maneuver friendly and enemy forces on board in foreground. In adjacent command room, a Naval officer makes decisions which can influence the simulated battle. The women are, left to right, Madeline Smallwood, Pauline Fagan, Myrna Brantley, Opal Walters, and Nancy Ginn. Rear is Clarence Schilt who marks orders on status board.\"\n\nTransit 5A-3 becomes the first satellite to achieve passive gravity-gradient attitude stabilization. APL researchers Richard Kershner and Robert Fischell write in \"Peaceful Uses of Automation in Outer Space\" how using Earth’s gravity field for vertical stabilization of near-Earth satellites has intrigued theoreticians for many years. The writers also acknowledge the obstacles involved, including the very small stabilizing torque available, and lack of a natural damping mechanism.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the Lab designs, builds, tests, and operates numerous satellites for the Transit navigation system. Fully operational in 1964, the system improves the ability of U.S. submarines around the globe to accurately determine their positions. Transit also carries instruments to measure the Earth’s geodetic and magnetic properties and to serve purposes of astronomy. The program pioneers advances in satellite design and operation, including addressing the issue of keeping satellites facing Earth so their signals can be received without interruption. APL also incorporates a de-spinning mechanism similar to a yo-yo to combat the issue of satellites constantly spinning once launched.\n\nSmoke billows below a Polaris missile during a test launch in April 1964, one of only two surface launches ever made in the history of the U.S. fleet ballistic missile program.\n\nThe Beacon Explorer is launched on October 9 from the Pacific Missile Range in California, and contains several experiments for study of the ionosphere and for obtaining geodesy information—data on the size and shape of the Earth.\n\nAPL teams up with the Johns Hopkins medical institutions to establish a formal, collaborative biomedical engineering program. Driving the effort at APL is Research Center Chair (and future Deputy Director) Frank McClure, assisted by Alvin Shulz, Joe Massey, and a cast of many others. Over the years, this partnership allows APL to apply its science, engineering, and systems analysis expertise—acquired primarily in defense and space—to significant problems in biomedical science and health delivery.\n\nOn July 24, 1965, the United States lost its first aircraft to a Soviet-built SA-2 surface-to-air missile system in the skies over Vietnam. The next day, the director of defense for research and engineering asks APL to study the situation and recommend ways to counter this threat. APL completes an assessment in two weeks and recommends changes to tactics and the development of electronic countermeasures. In the years since, APL has played a large role in the design and development of systems to support the Navy EA-6B Prowler electronic warfare aircraft (shown flying over USS John F. Kennedy in the Navy photo), as well as its successor, the EA-18 Growler.\n\nDODGE, the Department of Defense Gravity Experiment, is a satellite sent into orbit to study and demonstrate gravity-gradient stabilization—a procedure to keep one face of the satellite always pointing at the Earth—at near-geosynchronous altitudes. To help make certain that the satellite is pointing toward the Earth, DODGE carries a camera, and by rotating three color filters in front of the lens, it is able to produce the first color picture ever taken of the whole Earth. The photographs are featured in the November 1967 issue of National Geographic.\n\nThe Advanced Multifunction Array Radar (AMFAR) system can electronically send out an antenna beam at any angle in microseconds rather than moving a large, cumbersome radar dish. A prototype of AMFAR built by APL in 1969 is operated successfully on the roof of a building at campus headquarters. AMFAR provides the design basis for the first production system, which the Navy renames the AN/SPY-1 radar system.\n\nShown here is an AN/SYS-1 operator on board USS Somers (DDG-34), performing testing of the experimental automatic detection and tracking system for the control radar processor that demonstrated feasibility of APL concepts. These would serve as the precursor to modern air defense tracking systems.\n\nAPL engineers develop a variable-speed moving walkway transportation system, which can be boarded as an escalator but which accelerates to a cruising speed of five miles an hour. The 40-foot-long prototype is the only working accelerating walkway in the United States.\n\nAPL develops the device for experiments on Skylab, the first U.S. Earth-orbiting laboratory. The litter chair, which resembles something you’d find in a dentist’s office, can be positioned in various angles and spun at various speeds to study the body’s reaction to prolonged weightlessness. It is now on display at the National Air and Space Museum.\n\nAPL has long been at the forefront of drone development, thanks to the efforts of Maynard Hill, a metallurgist who spent much of his time at the Lab in the 1980s designing and developing a series of drones. Shown here in this 1974 photo are (left to right) Maynard Hill (Remotely Piloted Vehicle program manager), Robert Givens, Melvin Newcomer, William Charbonneau, and Raymond Cole. At APL, Hill designs the BQM-147A Expendable Drone, or Exdrone, now known as the U.S. Marine Corps’ Dragon Drone.\n\nIn the 1970s, Lab researchers begin working on prosthetic limbs and control systems for quadriplegics. By 1975, a robotic arm—commanded by a chin-movement controller—allows patient John Craven to perform tasks, including reading and feeding himself. Also pictured are APL’s Woodrow Seamone (left) and Johns Hopkins orthopedic surgeon Dr. Gerhard Schmeisser (right).\n\nA Harpoon missile seeker undergoes testing in the anechoic chamber at APL’s Guidance Systems Evaluation Laboratory (GSEL). The 1967 sinking of the Israeli ship Eilat convinced the Navy that it needed to quickly develop its own cruise missiles. Work subsequently progresses to produce what will become the medium-range anti-ship Harpoon missile and the longer-range Tomahawk cruise missile, both of which become vital precision strike systems for the Navy. APL scientists and engineers play a number of key roles in each program, especially in missile guidance and accuracy.\n\nWilliam Spohn (right) with an illustration showing the basic operation of the TERCOM system, developed for the Tomahawk cruise missile. TERCOM was the key to achieving the accuracy critically needed for the Tomahawk. Also shown are David Kalbaugh (left) and James Walker (seated). To improve the accuracy of conventionally armed Tomahawks, APL created another set of algorithms, needed to effectively use Digital Scene Matching Area Correlator (DSMAC) technology. The algorithms compared images taken by a camera onboard the missile to scenes stored in the missile’s computer.\n\nIn a perfect launch from Cape Canaveral on September 5, Voyager 1 follows its companion spacecraft Voyager 2 (launched August 20) on their multi-million-mile journey to the outer planets, Jupiter and Saturn, and beyond our solar system. Watching liftoff at the Cape are a number of APLers, including some on the technical team here that designed and developed the Low Energy Charged Particle (LECP) experiment, one of the spacecraft’s 11 instruments that will study the planets, their satellites, and the rings of Saturn, as well as the magnetic regions surrounding the planets and interplanetary space.\n\nTo better understand and respond to ever more challenging threats, a Warfare Analysis Laboratory (WAL), comprising representatives from all of the Lab’s technical departments, is established in 1981. WAL staff guide the development of a new warfare analysis process using scenario testing, called WALEX, for Warfare Analysis Laboratory Exercise.\n\nFor APL’s many technical contributions to the vital Tomahawk cruise missile program, the Navy awards a Tomahawk Cruise Missile flag to the Lab. In 1982, the Navy designates APL as the technical direction agent for the program to improve production and performance. From left: Alvin Schulz, APL associate director; Marion Oliver, Tomahawk program manager; Rear Adm. S. J. Hostettler; Carl Bostrom, Lab director; Al Eaton, assistant director and supervisor of the Fleet Systems Department; and Tom Sheppard, associate supervisor of Fleet Systems.\n\nThe Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer Explorers (AMPTE) mission creates the first-ever artificial comet by releasing barium clouds into space to study how charged particles from the solar wind travel through Earth’s magnetosphere. The scene is tense at 3 a.m. on September 11, 1984, in the APL Science Data Center as members of the AMPTE team await news of the first ion release by the German Ion Release Module (IRM) flying on AMPTE. NASA and APL team members crowd around a real-time display—on one of the few personal computers in use at APL at the time. Principal Investigator Tom Krimigis speaks on the phone with the IRM team in Germany. APL designed and built the Charge Composition Explorer, NASA’s contribution to the triple-spacecraft mission.\n\nThe nonreusable syringe, developed by researchers at APL and The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, is listed in the December 1989 issue of Popular Science magazine as one of the top 100 \"Best of What’s New\" in products and developments in science and technology for 1989. The device is developed by APL engineer John Wozniak, in collaboration with Kam Leong, of the JHU Biomedical Engineering Department, and Neal Halsey, M.D., of the University’s School of Hygiene and Public Health. The syringe discourages reuse by the action of a patented insert pressed within the syringe barrel.\n\nAPL alters its design for the experimental interceptor, coming up with a new and radical concept in which a single rocket would launch two spacecraft in orbit. On September 5, 1986, a scant two months over deadline, the experimental Delta 180 carrying the inventive APL-designed-and-built missile sensor package is launched from Cape Canaveral. Less than three hours later, the interceptor scores a direct hit with a test missile. The following year, President Reagan awards a Presidential Commendation to APL for the Delta 180 program.\n\nCEC provides ships in a battle group with an identical radar picture of threats in intense hostile electronic jamming environments, allowing ships to fire and guide surface-to-air missiles against targets using data from the radar systems of other ships or aircraft, even when the firing ship’s own radar cannot detect or track the targets.\n\nThe Trident II, the sixth generation of the Navy’s Fleet Ballistic Missile Program, completes a successful series of test launches from both land pads and submerged platforms. The tests are completed two years early and 12 percent below the Navy’s initial budget estimate. The Trident program started in 1956, with APL’s Submarine Technology Department acting as technical advisor to the program from its inception.\n\nThe Ship Self-Defense System (SSDS) is devised to provide self-protection and combat system capability to non-Aegis ships of the U.S. Navy. The SSDS begins as a proof-of-concept demonstration for the Quick Response Combat Capability Program in 1991. In June 1993, following land-based testing and shipboard installation and integration aboard USS Whidbey Island (LSD 41), SSDS—automatically integrating seven shipboard sensors and three weapon systems—performs a successful, near-simultaneous, fully automatic and coordinated detect-to-fire live engagement of two target “threats” (a towed decoy unit and a remotely piloted jet drone) using the Rolling Airframe Missile and Phalanx gun system.\n\nUSS Arleigh Burke launches at Maine’s Bath Iron Works. The Burke is the first in a line of Burke (DDG 51) Class Aegis destroyers and is named after the World War II hero and former Chief of Naval Operations. Admiral Burke is on hand with his wife Roberta, who christens the ship just before it slips into the waters of the Kennebec River. The Aegis Weapons System aboard Burke is an updated version of the kind first installed on Ticonderoga Class (CG 47) cruisers, of which there are now 12.\n\nImage Credit: U.S. Navy\n\nThe algorithm is developed by Dr. Bankman, who heads the APL research team. Physicist William Christens-Barry of the Theoretical Problems Group designs the mammogram digitization process and contributes to algorithm development. The radiology team—headed by Dr. William Brody, director of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions Department of Radiology—provides expertise in mammogram acquisition and interpretation.\n\nThe Lab first became involved with towed array sonar systems and underwater acoustics in 1970. More than two decades later, APL researchers develop new, mobile acoustic sonar arrays that provide better capabilities for submarine surveillance as adversary subs grow more difficult to easily detect. An experimental single array, more than 3.5 nautical miles long, demonstrates effective open-ocean surveillance operations, while a twin-line array is developed to work in coastal and littoral environments. Shown here are Lab staff members working on arrays in the old Building 12 (one of the Butler Buildings) in 1983.\n\nThe Securities Technology Institute (STI) is founded at APL in late 1994 by the U.S. Department of the Treasury Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP), tasked with developing advanced counterfeit deterrence technologies for future versions of U.S. currency. The program arises in response to advances in reprographic technology and computer graphics (notably color copiers, scanners, and color laser printers), which have greatly increased the tools available to traditional counterfeiters and created a new class of “casual” counterfeiters. These developments increase the threat counterfeiting poses to the integrity of the dollar and to the security of the United States.\n\nThe major exercise combining live action with a pioneering test of computer technology is held at APL in a virtual operating environment. APL’s Warfare Analysis Laboratory (WAL) serves as the sole East Coast \"viewport\" for modeling and simulation activities conducted during a major Navy/Marine Corps fleet training exercise. Known as Kernel Blitz 95, the exercise is \"the first time the Navy has used modeling and simulation to support a live training exercise.\"\n\nAPL serves as technical co-lead for the Navy for an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD), referred to as Mountain Top, in which the existing air defense systems of the Navy, CEC, and a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) experimental airborne radar are integrated to detect, track, and engage cruise missiles beyond the radar’s line of sight. The test involves numerous assets, including this radar station in Kokee State Park, Kauai, Hawaii.\n\nIn 1996, APL embarks on a major Navy initiative to incorporate the most advanced sonar and combat system capabilities during new submarine construction and overhaul, as well as backfitting these capabilities into existing platforms. With APL’s partnership, this initiative fundamentally changes the Navy’s acquisition processes for submarine sonars and combat systems into a modern, agile, and innovative enterprise that saves the nation billions of dollars in legacy acquisition costs.\n\nAPL engineers stand in front of the massive 5,500-pound Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX), the 56th satellite and largest spacecraft ever built at the Lab. Hyperspectral imaging technology allows MSX to show how to identify, detect, and track ballistic missiles during the midcourse incoming flight phase.\n\nThe first launch in NASA’s Discovery Program, the APL-built Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft lifts off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. NEAR—which will eventually be renamed NEAR Shoemaker (to honor the late planetary geologist Gene Shoemaker)—becomes the first spacecraft to orbit an asteroid when it reaches 433 Eros on Valentine’s Day 2000.\n\nThe Navy successfully intercepts a Theater Ballistic Missile (TBM) threat-representative target on January 24, using a demonstration version of the Standard Missile: Standard Missile 2 Block IVA (SM2 Blk IVA). The SM2 Blk IVA builds on the previous missile design by incorporating an imaging infrared (IR) seeker and an advanced fuze using a forward-looking radio frequency (RF) sensor.\n\nAfter nine years in the making, the ACE spacecraft roars from launchpad 17a at Cape Canaveral Air Station in Florida on August 25, at 10:39 a.m. ACE will study energetic particles coming from the sun, interplanetary space, and regions beyond, collecting data to help understand the origin and evolution of our solar system.\n\nAPL’s temperature pill with built-in radio transmitter—made commercially available in 1988—is used by Space Shuttle astronauts. As part of his medical experiments, Senator/Astronaut John Glenn swallows a 3/4-inch-long, silicone-coated capsule that contains a tiny telemetry system, a microbattery, and a quartz temperature sensor.\n\nAPL develops the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics (ESSENCE) disease-surveillance system. The tool allows public health officials to assess a range of data that could indicate a potential danger. Data might include a rise in the number of people making doctor’s appointments, a run on cough medicines at drugstores in particular locales, and more school absences than usual.\n\nThe Advanced Natural Gas Vehicle (ANGV) is publicly introduced on November 4 at the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) amid a swirl of television cameras and government and corporate dignitaries. APL developed the concept and then the prototype of the ANGV with major funding from DoE and additional financial support from several gas utilities. The ANGV had three times the range of current natural gas vehicles and ample trunk space, with performance and safety features similar to a gasoline-powered car, while limiting emissions to a level well below that of gasoline-fueled automobiles.\n\nOver the years, some of APL’s game-changing innovations resulted in commercial products and technologies, including medical devices and software. In 1999, the Lab establishes the formal path to help move technologies that are suitable for nongovernment uses into the marketplace through the Office of Technology Transfer (OTT).\n\nAPL’s expertise in the design, development, testing, and evaluation of passive sonar systems, such as towed sensor arrays, leads to new work to address improvements in data transfer among numerous passive systems to provide submarine crews and commanders with more and better information. APL staff members are shown here during the 2000 Ardent ET-2 sea test of sonar systems at the Navy Atlantic Underwater Test and Evaluation Center, or AUTEC, Range off Andros Island in the Bahamas.\n\nAPL’s Office of Technology Transfer hosts its first Invention of the Year awards ceremony to honor 126 researchers and name the Lab’s leading inventions for 1999. The highest award is presented for development of a sensor to detect spoiling meat; Craig Kelly, George Murray, and Manny Uy earn the honor by crafting a process to create a molecularly imprinted polymer sensor that changes color in the presence of bacterial byproducts produced as meat spoils.\n\nAfter a year in orbit that produces 100,000 images and a range of unprecedented data on a near-Earth asteroid, the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission completes its extraordinary science phase with a \"bonus\" soft landing on the surface of asteroid Eros. Guided skillfully by mission operators and touching down at walking speed, the spacecraft continues to transmit data from the asteroid’s surface for two weeks.\n\nOn December 7, the TIMED spacecraft lifts off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California to explore one of the last frontiers in Earth’s atmosphere.
