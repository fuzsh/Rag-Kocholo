        "text": "I was aware that section 2 does deal with the 4in gun, but this particular extract refers to all dead times, for both claibres, , not just not just the 4in.\n\nWe dont know about the 4.7 twin, but it has the same published rof as the 1936 models. Power ramming still requires hand loading and can involve innefficiencies because of the poor placement of the shell hoppers, so I have to disagree with you. the power rammer might add or improve fireing cycle by 1-2 seconds over the older mounts but that still brings it in at somewhere below 12 rounds per minute. Given that 12 is already an indaequate number, the conclusion whether it be twin mounting or no, remains the same.\n\nIf as I suspect the older models at non-optimal elvations can only fire at around 6 rpm, and power ramming improves that practical rof by say 1-2 secs, then you might get 8 rpm. still within the original estimate for practical rof of 4-8 rpm. 4 for the really old versions, 8 for the newer twins.\n\nSorry, still dont agree with you. Far too rose coloured a view of the RN capabilities in my book.\n\nLook, I've provided abundant data regarding the RoF - 5 rounds in 17 sec for Basylisk in 1930 - 180 salvos from Kimberly at Narvik, most with a 5 sec loading cycle - 15rpm for the 4.7in Mk VIII- 3000 rounds from Illustrious at an average of 12 RPM - 16 RPM from Scylla...all these guns had essentially the same loading tray system, except that the last 4 all have power ramming. It is time for you to get off this pot and accept the facts . There is no rose coloured views here , just a lot of hard digging and research.\n\nand another:\n\nThe day by day hum drum of her \"working up\" period, prior to her joining the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow, would make most uninteresting reading except the mention that she became, by virtue of her latest type radar, exceedingly rapid rate of gunfire (16 round per minute) and high speed, a very efficient ship. An efficiency that was to be a saving grace to her in her hectic times to come.\n\nhttp://www.naval-history.net/WW2Ships-Charybdis.htm\n\nThe RN didn't have pom-poms, 20mm and 40mm bofors guns gathering dust that could be used to quickly augment destroyer AA, but they did have lots of older 3in and 4in guns that were not being used - sorry but that is the way it was. A 3 or 4in gun fired over open sights against an aircraft is no more accurate than any other gun fired with the same method; a pom-pom or bofors would have a much better hit probability because of the high RoF.\n\nA lot of truth in this but the 20mm were added pretty quickly, when would depend on the ship and availablity. I don't disagree with your description of the value of the effectiveness of the single 4in added in some destroyers.\n\nWhat I disagree with, is your position that these were additions to the short range aa guns. All they were were are inaccurate longe range guns, useless against close range fast moving targets.\n\nA slightly amusing aside. There was an obituary in the paper a few months ago. He had served in destroyers during the war and had to live with the somewhat embarrassing nickname 'Annie' all through his naval career. As a young officer he was put in charge of the 4in installed instead of the torpedoes and by absolute fluke shot down a Ju88 with the third shot. Everyone knew this was something close to a miracle and was given the nickname after Annie Oakley. He often said how much he regretted shooting down the Ju88\n\nLook, I've provided abundant data regarding the RoF\n\nAnd all of it, for one reason or another has been misinterpreted.\n\n5 rounds in 17 sec for Basylisk in 1930\n\npeacetime conditions, optimum elevation, no turret elevation or training to worry about. I bet they were a crack gun crew.\n\n180 salvos from Kimberly at Narvik, most with a 5 sec loading cycle\n\nNot in an AA role. and against targets not really moving at least some of the time. Not relevant to what we are discussing\n\n15rpm for the 4.7in Mk VIII- 3000 rounds from Illustrious at an average of 12 RPM\n\nIlustrious was armed with 4.5 in guns. a completely differnt kettle of fish and not a destroyer anyway 12 rpm is still too slow to be effective\n\n16 RPM from Scylla...all these guns had essentially the same loading tray system, except that the last 4 all have power ramming.\n\nScylla was armed with 4.5 inch guns. ive never questioned the rof of the 4.5 gun. Scylla was a cruiser. youve claimed repeatedly that the 4.7 gun had the same loading tray system, but wont recognize or acknowledge that at least one source does not agree with you. Even on the basis of max rof, the 4.5 is rated at 20rpm, whilst the best 4.7s are rated at 12 rpm. how can that be the same?\n\nIt is time for you to get off this pot and accept the facts .\n\nIve accepted the source material youve produced. what I have challenged, is your interpretation of those facts. When you get confronted by legitiamte questions and critiques you try every form of bluff bluster and bullying tactics you can think of. Wont work with me. You have not succeeded in convincing me. So what. I have questions you cant answer IMO. We can and should agree to disagree and leave it at that. its a difference of opinion, nothing more. I dont have to get off anything, and i dont have to move away, or accept anything. Im not losing my temper. Im enjoying the debate and the exchange of ideas to be honest. i am sorry if the discussion is upsetting you, seriously I am, but a tantrum is not reason for me to change my opinion. Ive happily conceded a number of points where I think you are are correct, and thats good. ive not denigrated in any way your source material. In fact im impressed with it. The one area where we have disagreed is in the interpretation of the data. get over it. its just a discussion, and opinions on the known data.\n\nThere is no rose coloured views here , just a lot of hard digging and research.\n\nYes, and I have and wil again commend you on the quality of the material you have produced. Well done. Thats not the issue. its the interpretation of the data. Me not accepting your opinion does not or should not affect how you view that material if you dont want to accept my point of view.\n\nCharybidis was a cruiser, armed with the 4.5 in gun which I have already commented on. a different gun, with a different published max rof, and specifically developed to address the known weaknesses of the 4.7 in weapon. Again, if anything just serves to underline or provide background evidence that the 4.7 was not a good DP weapon, in any of its forms.\n\nAnd all of it, for one reason or another has been misinterpreted.\n\npeacetime conditions, optimum elevation, no turret elevation or training to worry about. I bet they were a crack gun crew.\n\n5 rounds in 17 seconds = a cyclic rate of 17.6 rpm. OK, then an average crew should be able to do 10 - 12 rpm.\n\nNot in an AA role. and against targets not really moving at least some of the time. Not relevant to what we are discussing\n\nKimberly certianly did engage moving targets and did so while moving rapidly herself, and again I reduced the AA rof to 10 rpm in my calculations\n\nIllustrious was armed with 4.5 in guns. a completely differnt kettle of fish and not a destroyer anyway 12 rpm is still too slow to be effective\n\nScylla was armed with 4.5 inch guns. ive never questioned the rof of the 4.5 gun.

Even on the basis of max rof, the 4.5 is rated at 20rpm, whilst the best 4.7s are rated at 12 rpm. how can that be the same?\n\nNavweaps states:\n\nBritain\n\n4.5\"/45 (11.4 cm) QF Marks I, III and IV\n\n(Marks 2, 3, 4 and 5)\n\nTwin mountings of World War II: 12 rounds per minute per gun\n\nI've produced evidence that the gun could fire at an average of 12rpm for very long periods and up to 16rpm.\n\nIve accepted the source material youve produced. what I have challenged, is your interpretation of those facts...\n\nWhile I'm challenging your interpretation of the facts and I supported my contentions with lots of data - I'm not bullying but you'll have to admit that trying to swim upstream against the bull that Navweaps would have us swallow is no easy task.\n\nCharybdis was a cruiser, armed with the 4.5 in gun which I have already commented on. a different gun, with a different published max rof, and specifically developed to address the known weaknesses of the 4.7 in weapon. Again, if anything just serves to underline or provide background evidence that the 4.7 was not a good DP weapon, in any of its forms.\n\nI've produced evidence that the gun could fire at an average of 12rpm for very long periods and up to 16rpm maximum. The 4.7in twin and 4.5in twin gun mountings and loading facilities were almost identical:\n\n4.7in twin - note the fuze setting pedestal located right beside the loading tray.\n\n4.5in twin BD mount (Illustrious)- if the 4.5in BD housing was removing, you'd never be able to tell them apart. The actual loading tray and breech mechanisms are virtually the same, the only real difference is the higher trunnions (pivot point) on the 4.5in twin.\n\nUSS Benham at Eastern Solomons:\n\nBenham opened fire with 5\" anti-aircraft barrage\"; initial range 5,000 yards (altitude 12,750 feet), and 20 m.m. fire.\n\n1714 -- Enterprise observed to be hit by bombs.\n\n1720 -- Ceased firing.\n\nOf the approximate twenty (20) planes making the attack, which came within range of anti-aircraft batteries, nearly all were shot down in the vicinity of the Enterprise. Several of these planes were fired upon by this ship and adjacent ships in formation. About four (4) were seen to attempt to escape and were pursued by our fighters. The Enterprise appeared to be the sole target of the attack except for four (4) dive bombers, who, attempted to bomb the North Carolina, and were promptly shot down.\n\nThere were no casualties to either personnel or equipment of this vessel.\n\nAmmunition expended:\n\n5\"/38 - 109 rounds\n\n20 m.m. - 510 rounds\n\nhttp://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ships/logs/DD/dd397-ESols.html\n\nSome comments - note they they used \"barrage fire\" A JKMN class could have engaged the same target, but would have had to open fire before 6000 yds and she would have been able to place a barrage over Enterprise (which is what happened) that the DBs would have to fly through. Note the small ammo expenditure. This is the same battle where Crenshaw of USS Maury stated that they were unable to engage the IJN aircraft because of the ineffectiveness of the Mk 33 GFCS.\n\nSome more from the same report:\n\nComment on material:\n\nThere were no material failures.\n\nThe main feed pumps are in such a condition, that their reliability is uncertain. Early installation of new main feed pumps, already ordered by Bureau of Ships, is necessary for battle efficiency.\n\nThe main generators overheat excessively in tropical waters, when the load of battle requirements is placed on them. An improved cooling system is urgently required.\n\nThe open-sight for director pointer is inefficient. An improved design is needed to aid in getting director and guns on rapidly moving air targets.\n\nThe temporary installation of number two 20 m.m. gun on the midship deck house, frame 99, enabled that gun to fire effectively, twice as many rounds as guns 1, 3 4.\n\nDuring the greater part of the first eight months of war operations this ship has been one of a carrier screen. This ship has only four (4) 5 inch and four (4) 20 m.m. guns. In both the MIDWAY and SOLOMON (STEWART) battles the need for additional anti-aircraft guns was readily apparent. It is again recommended that additional 20 m.m. guns, or, 40 m.m. guns, be installed; and if necessary for weight compensation, eight ( 8 ) of the sixteen (16) torpedo tubes now carried, be removed.\n\nNote the very light CIWS for Aug 1942 - a JKMN would have a quad pom-pom and 2 - 4 20mm, and a HA 4in single in the same time frame, but even in 1939 the CIWS of a quad pom-pom and 2 x quad .5in was a superior CIWS.\n\n27 AA claims were made, including 5 by the destroyers while the USNI summary states that maybe 15 were shot down by AA. Lundstrom estimates that about 5 IJNAF aircraft, in total, were shot down by AA. Again the clumsiness of the Mk 33 is pointed out.\n\nUSS Benham at Eastern Solomons:\n\nSome comments - note they they used \"barrage fire\" A JKMN class could have engaged the same target, but would have had to open fire before 6000 yds and she would have been able to place a barrage over Enterprise (which is what happened) that the DBs would have to fly through.

One important observation, the USS Benham opened fire at 5000 yards at a target flying at approx 12,500 ft. Looking at the chart you included in posting 123, a JKN/Tribal using the twin 4.7 would have had to cease firing at about 7,500 yards and could only open fire at about 11,000. In other words the chances of being damaged by the 4,7 would be very slim as the destroyer only had about 35 seconds to get the range, and at the point of bomb release the bomber would have been untroubled.\n\nMore interesting stuff from you, I wish I had a spare day or two to go through your books.

In other words the chances of being damaged by the 4,7 would be very slim as the destroyer only had about 35 seconds to get the range, and at the point of bomb release the bomber would have been untroubled.\n\nIn this particular action, very few ships actually sighted the IJN aircraft prior to their dive (they were tracked on radar but lost as about 16000 yds) SOP for the RN would have been an \"umbrella barrage\" over the carrier, which seems to be what happened:\n\nThe Enterprise radar lost track of the enemy group when it came within its minimum range, but, on the basis of previous tracking, radar plot reported at 1709 that \"the enemy planes are directly overhead now!\" In spite of this warning and the excellent visibility, the first plane was sighted after it already had entered its dive. Effective enemy plane camouflage and the fact that the first dives were made on the Enterprise from the port quarter, out of the sun, probably accounted for this belated visual contact. In the case of the Enterprise, the first plane was sighted at 12,000 feet by a 20-mm. battery officer. Although the target was well beyond effective range, he promptly opened fire with one gun, thus calling the ships' attention to the attacker and giving them a point of aim.\n\nHyperWar: The Battle of the Eastern Solomons [ONI Combat Narrative]\n\nI checked the 4.7in engagement drawing carefully, and I get minimum range of about 6000 yds for 12750 ft altitude, but yes, potentially, there would be a few thousand yards where the destroyers would not be able to engage the aircraft with predicted fire, prior to the barrage.\n\nThe opportunities for the Russians to sink ships were pretty restricted. There were plenty of RN ships that didnt sink a single ships either. And three days at sea in the baltic and/or the Baltic is a very long time.\n\nI also know that not sinking a single ship is highly doubtful. For many years it was historical \"fact\" that not a single ship was lost to Soviet Submarines. But Of all places in the Kriegsmarines day by day war diaries (online and comppiled post war) I have found entries that quite a bit of Axis shipping was intersepted and sunk by Russian submarines in all three operational areas. Hayward, in wrinting his book about the Lw operations on the southern front, talks of how the LW was forced to divert resources to combatting Soviet Naval activities. He furthe mentions 9I think, that Soviet destroyers had sunk a number of small Axis (italian I think?) MAS boats based at makeshift bases trying to isolate Sevastopol.\n\nSo whilst i too have seen such statements, and cant be 100% certain about thye actual truth, do have my doubts about the veracity of those claims.\n\nThe italians make another interesting study. I think their overwhelming problem was the faulty leadership at the top,, followed closely by their lack of oil and the poor co-operation with the RA. I do not believe the italians particulalry needed a carrier, but they did need a dedicated naval co-operation unit to support naval operations. They lacked radar, or moree precisely a general fitout of radar and a doctrine on how to use it. Thay did have sonar, from the middle of 1941. They had some patchy equipment, some good, some not so good. Their chief naval guns for DDs were the 120/45 and 120/50 by Ansaldo and OTO, both based on Armstrong designs. The latter weapon came in a twin power mounting, with centralised hoists. The guns were fully enclosed, and spaced only 22 in apart which caused severe dispersion problems. The gun mounts were originally designed as hand cranked, but came in too heavy, so had to be electrically powered. They also started life as hand rammed, but were fitted with a mechanical loader from 1926, which was gradually imporoved over time. However the power rammers were a severe restriction on the operation of the turret, according to Campbell. Apparently the rammers would not operate above 30 degree elevation which meant that the guns (even though rated as elevating to 45 degrees, could not be loaded above 30 degrees. These guns (not the mounts) were a very close relative if somewhat lighter, to the british pattern 4.7in, but had a sustained rate of fire of 7 rounds per minute. hmmmm.\n\nItalian torpedoes were based on the whitehead pattern , and were reliable, on par designs. They has an aerial torp at the beginning of the war far supeior to that in use in Germany, so from 1941 the Germans began using the italian types over their own, until after 1942.\n\nSome accounts say the optics for the Italian guns was not good, but Im pretty sure that claim is bogus. What was missing for these guns were crews properly trained in nightime gunnery Wartime expereience also shows a marked reluctance for Italian destroyers to enter any smokescreen . This affected their performance during several battles.\n\nBoth the 120/50 and the larger 135 mm guns were meant to have a DP functionality, but operational experience showed that they could not fulfil that role. Hmmm again. The larger 5.3 in gun was eventually redesigned for the new carrier Aquila to have AA capability. manufacture AA ammuntion for it, but the gu was originally intended as a DP weapon.\n\nI never said that the RN thought that 40 degs was enough!\n\nWhat I've been saying is that 40degs is not useless and that most air attacks could be engaged by destroyers with 40 deg guns - anyone who takes the time to read Lundstrom and First Team will know that in almost every case USN destroyers with 40 deg elevation could have provided the exact same AA support as they did in 1942. The problem is that most people seem to think that aircraft simply materialized directly over destroyers (but only RN destroyers), and they were helpless if they couldn't shoot straight up! Of course this is complete nonsense.\n\nIt certainly was a sign of desperation, to add single 3in or 4in guns - the problem being that the 20mm oerlikon was not yet in UK or Cdn production, nor was the Bofors 40mm in a naval mounting, and the quad pom-pom was in very tight supply, whereas these 3in and 4in guns were sitting around gathering dust...and so they were hauled out of storage and added to RN Fleet destroyers. Later in the war, most of these ships had the gun removed and replaced by TTs once again along with a greatly strengthened CIWS.\n\nI agree that from Tribals onwards RN DDs had reasonable AA capacity against TBs and level bombers attacking at fairly low altitude but the problem was that the high level bombers, usually not dangerous but IJNAF bombers had fairly effective bombing tactic against ships, after flying through the zone inside which the British early war DDs could fire at them could made the final stage of their attack completely unhindered by fire from those DDs, same goes with the dive bombers. Even late war RN DDs had fairly weak CIWS when compared to USN Fleet DDs Allan M. Sumner and Gearing classes had 12 40mm Bofors and some 12 20mm Oerlikons, those which had landed a TT mounting had 16 Bofors. Even KM DDs after Barbara mods had heavier CIWS than late war RN DDs and as had the late war IJN DDs with 20-28 25mm AAA guns, even if IJN 25mm was fairly light AAA gun and the 3x25mm mount had its problems. Of course KM needed much more AA defence than RN in Europe in 44-45.\n\nJuha"
