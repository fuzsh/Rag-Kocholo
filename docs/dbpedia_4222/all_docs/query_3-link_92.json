        "text": "What happens when an immovable force (i.e regulators) is hit by an irresistible force (i.e autonomous robotaxis)? Innovation wants to move fast while the process to regulatory change or exemption is very slow. As usual the innovators are optimistic that approval is just around the corner, yet there is no deadline for approval and an actual limit on the number of annual exemptions are capped. The irony here is that the safety regulation requires steering wheels and pedals in all vehcles. I guess they couldn't foresee an innovation that conceiving of vehicles that drive without steering wheels and pedals. The challenge for the innovators of course will be getting approval and generating revenue before they run out of investor money. Timing really is everything.\n\nBREAKING: Reuters reports \"Aptiv to cut stake in #robotaxi #tech firm Motional, stop funding.\" Aptiv CEO Kevin Clark said: \"While our Motional JV continues to make progress on their #technology roadmap, we've decided to no longer allocate capital to it.\" ANALYSIS: With Argo gone, and Cruise's #driverless operations suspended (and GM cutting spending), the decision by Aptiv to cut funding likely marks the end for Motional. Of the major developers working on robotaxis, that really only leaves Waymo. That doesn't make Waymo the smartest player, but leaves the company cornered as last to grasp the risks of using public roads to test experimental robotaxi tech using non-consenting subjects as guinea pigs. The problem from here is that when Waymo inevitably harms or kills someone, it will be seen as not considering the risks to other road users. The challenge ahead is how a robotaxi developer can kill or harm anyone, and the event itself not kill the company. Waymo is furiously setting out its stall, attempting to set a narrative that the Waymo Driver is already safer than humans. But consider, humans drive more than 3 trillion miles annually in the US alone. Waymo has cumulatively 7M driverless miles. So claims about comparative safety between Waymo and humans need lots more proof yet. But the policy genie is out the bottle. NHTSA has issued a #ANPRM for impaired driving, covering #distracted, #drowsy and #drunk driving. NHTSA is planning for a long-term goal of making human drivers safer. Robotaxis may continue for a while yet (funding permitting) but the long-term policy solution to the epidemic of deaths on US roads can be seen to be making human drivers safer. That shift has happened in just the last 2 months. A webinar on NHTSA's impaired driving ANPRM was hosted by The Ojo-Yoshida Report Link: https://lnkd.in/dqit6EYX The focus for OEMs now is to install #driver #monitoring #systems #DMS, to detect for distraction and drowsiness, and to monitor that the driver is attentive and engaged in the driving task. OEMs should get the highest performing DMS they can find. It is easy to nickel & dime that decision, but it is a false economy, you'll get what you pay for. Roads will be safer with a step-change in the performance of #AEB. Forget lidar, a better price/performance trade-off comes from imaging radar. That becomes a forward facing sensor for AEB, which detects longitudinal crash risk and brakes the vehicle accordingly. The safest driver is an engaged and unimpaired human, with hands on the wheel, eyes on the road, and mind on the task of driving. NHTSA is starting to understand that. The race is now on for automakers and tier-1s to shift their focus accordingly. Aptiv's JV partner in Motional is Hyundai. Maybe Hyundai will take pole position for advocating for #safety technology to make human drivers safer. https://lnkd.in/d-HSrGM4\n\nMotional delays commercial robotaxi plans amid restructuring Motional, the autonomous conveyance startup borne retired of a $4 cardinal associated task betwixt Hyundai and automotive supplier Aptiv, volition intermission its commercialized operations and hold plans to motorboat a driverless work arsenic it undergoes a restructuring, TechCrunch has learned. The purpose is marque advancement connected exertion and the concern model, portion preserving capital, according to sources acquainted with the changes. The institution told employees Tuesday during an all-hands gathering that the changes volition see layoffs, but did not supply a fig of however galore radical would beryllium affected, according to sources who spoke to TechCrunch connected information of anonymity. Motional is ending its full commercialized operation, which contiguous includes robotaxi rides with a quality information operator down the wheel, successful Las Vegas and Santa Monica, Calif. Instead, the institution is enactment greater resources towards testing, which volition apt see an enlargement to different cities, 1 root acquainted told TechCrunch. Employees were told that the stubbornly precocious outgo of moving a commercialized operations coupled with pricey autonomous conveyance exertion components makes the concern lawsuit challenging today. Motional besides posted a blog post soon aft the gathering ended that outlines its plans. The restructuring comes little than a week aft Hyundai Motor Group invested nearly $1 billion successful Motional arsenic portion of a broader woody that included buying retired a information of associated task spouse Aptiv. About fractional of that amount, $475 million, is going straight into Motional’s coffers. The remaining $448 cardinal was utilized to bargain buy 11% of Aptiv’s communal equity involvement successful Motional. Hyundai’s caller concern puts Motional’s valuation astatine $4.1 billion, according to sources connected the call. That’s astir the aforesaid valuation arsenic Motional had successful 2020. Earlier this year, Motional’s aboriginal was enactment successful uncertainty aft Aptiv announced plans to reduce its ownership interest and halt allocating superior to the task owed to the precocious outgo of commercializing a robotaxi concern and the agelong roadworthy up to profits. Aptiv expects to trim its communal equity involvement successful Motional from 50% arsenic of March 31 to astir 15%, leaving Hyundai with the remaining 85% control. https://ift.tt/9KaXmsL"
