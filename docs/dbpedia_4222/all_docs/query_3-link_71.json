        "text": "The U.S. and other powers are battling terrorist organizations militarily—but also fiscally, cutting off funding sources and intercepting the flow of money into enemy hands.\n\nAs Israeli attorney and activist Darshan-Leitner and New York–based author Katz (The Ghost Warriors: Inside Israel’s Undercover War Against Suicide Terrorism, 2016, etc.) write, the business of espionage is popularly imagined to feature James Bond–like heroes. However, “the day-to-day unreported grind of gathering, analyzing, and acting on intelligence is what allows people to sleep soundly in their beds.” One aspect of this intelligence work, in the case of several terrorist organizations, has been to identify and neutralize the financial brains behind the operation, the men who know the passwords and routing numbers. As is so often the case in matters of terrorism, the Israelis are several steps ahead of everyone else; at the center of the story stands a Mossad officer named Meir Dagan, who assembled a team of talented intelligence workers with an eye to tracking down where the funds for groups like the Islamic State and al-Qaida were coming from. Their operating thesis—that “there were no longer any white-collar jobs in the terrorist organization”—meant that such financial officers were fair game for assassination, and organizations whose accountants were “spectacularly killed,” as the authors gamely note, found it harder than before to recruit successors for men who “were not replaced with a job posting on craigslist.” The narrative centers on Israeli operations, which favor surgical strikes on selective targets, unlike the brute-force American preference for carpet bombing and such; the authors do note, however, that American tactics have increasingly shifted to finding financiers in an effort to “follow the money, devalue the money, seize the money, and kill the money.”\n\nIt’s not exactly le Carré, but solid reporting and analysis meet a good sense of narrative, making this book more fluent and less dismal than its subject might suggest.\n\nA neurosurgeon with a passion for literature tragically finds his perfect subject after his diagnosis of terminal lung cancer.\n\nWriting isn’t brain surgery, but it’s rare when someone adept at the latter is also so accomplished at the former. Searching for meaning and purpose in his life, Kalanithi pursued a doctorate in literature and had felt certain that he wouldn’t enter the field of medicine, in which his father and other members of his family excelled. “But I couldn’t let go of the question,” he writes, after realizing that his goals “didn’t quite fit in an English department.” “Where did biology, morality, literature and philosophy intersect?” So he decided to set aside his doctoral dissertation and belatedly prepare for medical school, which “would allow me a chance to find answers that are not in books, to find a different sort of sublime, to forge relationships with the suffering, and to keep following the question of what makes human life meaningful, even in the face of death and decay.” The author’s empathy undoubtedly made him an exceptional doctor, and the precision of his prose—as well as the moral purpose underscoring it—suggests that he could have written a good book on any subject he chose. Part of what makes this book so essential is the fact that it was written under a death sentence following the diagnosis that upended his life, just as he was preparing to end his residency and attract offers at the top of his profession. Kalanithi learned he might have 10 years to live or perhaps five. Should he return to neurosurgery (he could and did), or should he write (he also did)? Should he and his wife have a baby? They did, eight months before he died, which was less than two years after the original diagnosis. “The fact of death is unsettling,” he understates. “Yet there is no other way to live.”\n\nA moving meditation on mortality by a gifted writer whose dual perspectives of physician and patient provide a singular clarity.\n\n“Quality of life means more than just consumption”: Two MIT economists urge that a smarter, more politically aware economics be brought to bear on social issues.\n\nIt’s no secret, write Banerjee and Duflo (co-authors: Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way To Fight Global Poverty, 2011), that “we seem to have fallen on hard times.” Immigration, trade, inequality, and taxation problems present themselves daily, and they seem to be intractable. Economics can be put to use in figuring out these big-issue questions. Data can be adduced, for example, to answer the question of whether immigration tends to suppress wages. The answer: “There is no evidence low-skilled migration to rich countries drives wage and employment down for the natives.” In fact, it opens up opportunities for those natives by freeing them to look for better work. The problem becomes thornier when it comes to the matter of free trade; as the authors observe, “left-behind people live in left-behind places,” which explains why regional poverty descended on Appalachia when so many manufacturing jobs left for China in the age of globalism, leaving behind not just left-behind people but also people ripe for exploitation by nationalist politicians. The authors add, interestingly, that the same thing occurred in parts of Germany, Spain, and Norway that fell victim to the “China shock.” In what they call a “slightly technical aside,” they build a case for addressing trade issues not with trade wars but with consumption taxes: “It makes no sense to ask agricultural workers to lose their jobs just so steelworkers can keep theirs, which is what tariffs accomplish.” Policymakers might want to consider such counsel, especially when it is coupled with the observation that free trade benefits workers in poor countries but punishes workers in rich ones.\n\nOccasionally wonky but overall a good case for how the dismal science can make the world less—well, dismal."
