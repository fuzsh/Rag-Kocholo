        "text": "Test Breakdown and Analysis\n\nThe missile boat is doing 30 knots, and after 1 minute of running straight, it will start to follow a slow, saw-tooth pattern @ 30 knots. When it reaches waypoint 2, it will engage a target ship ~30km away with its AShMs.\n\nThe Hornet is armed with 2 AGM-65Fs, these missiles have a warhead that's slightly larger than the KDA Naval Strike Missile.\n\nThe first Maverick hits the front of the superstructure (which contains the bridge, and probably all of the command and control facilities and electronics on the ship), before the ship reaches its first waypoint, removing ~40% of its HP. Graphically the area is destroyed; it's just a black, burning heap. The bridge and the FCR (the large white radome (\"Band Stand\") which might also have a surface search mode) for its P-270 missiles is completely destroyed. However, the ship seems mostly unaffected, it hasn't lost any speed, and is still very much under control to follow the waypoints as if nothing had happened. The CIWS and their associated FCR are still operational, and continue to train and fire.\n\nThe second Maverick hits the ship roughly broadside, just under the starboard launch tubes. This drops the health into the red (to about 20%), but apart from a 50% reduction in speed, nothing has changed; the ship still fires off all of its missiles, and continues to follow the waypoints. As far as I can tell the MR-123 FCR and CIWS are still operational (they train at least and return to their default position).\n\nIn reality, that first Maverick would've completely mission killed the ship. Destroying the bridge, (and any other command infrastructure if they're not on the bridge), should've left the ship unable to fight or steer. Such a hit I would've expected to destroy all of the command and control electronics/cabling, including the consoles, displays and computers for all sensors and weapons. I would also expect a large fire to have started in the superstructure and the blast from the warhead to buckle/breach the bulkhead in the compartment behind it (which in turn would leave the sensors mounted above disabled, as the cabling and electronics for them almost certainly runs through this compartment). Given that the Maverick hit near the bottom of the front of the superstructure, I would've also expected the compartment below to be extensively damaged, I'm not sure what this compartment is, but it looks to be in close proximity to where I'd expect an engineering space to be (looking at the angle of the shafts), though that might be another deck below.\n\nSo far I'd expect the ship to be basically dead in the water, with a large fire, the front half of the superstructure basically razed, with the ship completely unable to fight, steer, or maybe even call for help; a near certain mission kill. The only thing I'd expect to be working is the naval gun at most, assuming you can control it from the mount itself, which given the mounting, I wouldn't say is likely but wouldn't be surprised if it did (I know the larger AK130 can be controlled from the turret).\n\nThen there's the second Maverick, it hit the hull, in a dive, just under the launchers. I expect that it would've taken out a probable engineering space, specifically the engine room; this should definitely leave the ship without propulsion, and would probably disable/destroy the ship's electrical supply and hydraulics. Given the proximity to the launchers, I'd expect the missiles inside them and maybe even the launch tubes and hatches to be damaged from vibrations). I'd expect another fire, likely even more severe than the first (with it possibly igniting fuel, and oil). Given the size of the warhead, I would expect it to cause extensive damage to the hull, leading to extensive flooding (from the hull and buckling/cracking, I also wouldn't be surprised if the blast and subsequent fire would damage and compromise the watertight bulkheads). The fire would probably make the flooding very difficult/impossible to control, and there's probably very little chance such a fire would be able to be contained. To top it off, I'd expect the engine room of this ship to be one of, if not the largest internal compartment in the hull, which is now filling with water, while being on fire. The electrical system is almost certainly gone, which means that the crew probably won't be able to pump the water out. All in all, from this hit alone, I would expect the ship to develop a heavy list to starboard and capsize and sink within an hour or so."
