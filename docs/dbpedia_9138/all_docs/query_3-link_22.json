        "text": "As climate-related disasters such as floods, droughts and heat waves increase, prioritizing the involvement of local communities in climate-related initiatives is of paramount importance. While communities face the impacts of climate change directly, they are often not directly involved in policy and decision-making processes that affect their ability to cope with current crises and adapt to changing environmental, economic and social conditions in the future.\n\nFor effective implemention local climate action, it is important to ensure that communities better understand their specific circumstances and play a role in taking the necessary measures necessary to promote change. Collaborative efforts between governments, communities and civil society are encouraged to assess climate risks and develop comprehensive and inclusive solutions tailored to meet local needs.\n\nIn this framework, an important step towards a sustainable future through strengthening local climate action has been taken with the “EU Partnership for Local Climate Action in Türkiye Project”, which has taken an important step towards the preparation of Local Climate Change Action Plans (LCCAPs) in pilot cities.. Antalya, Kahramanmaraş, Ordu, Elazığ, Kastamonu and Isparta were selected as pilot cities for the preparation of LCCAPs. The cooperation with the pilot cities was formalized with the signing of cooperation protocols between the Directorate of Climate Change and the municipalities during the Project Launch Event on 27 September 2023.\n\nFollowing the opening speeches, the signing ceremony was attended by Mr. Muhittin Böcek, Mayor of Antalya Metropolitan Municipality, Mr. Mehmet Hilmi Güler, Mayor of Ordu Metropolitan Municipality, Rüstem Keleş, Secretary General of Kahramanmaraş Metropolitan Municipality, Şükrü Başdeğirmen, Mayor of Isparta and Rahmi Galip Vidinlioğlu, Mayor of Kastamonu.\n\nThe preparation of LCCAPs in Türkiye is seen as an important and urgent measure to respond to the challenges posed by climate change at the local level. The impacts of climate change vary across different geographical regions and cities, affecting various important aspects of urban life and basic services in all municipalities. Moreover, municipalities in Türkiye need improvements in their technical, administrative and financial capacities, resulting in a limited number of municipalities with LCCAPs.\n\nThe Project will continue to strengthen the capacity of municipalities in Türkiye to prepare, implement and monitor local climate change action plans. The selected pilot cities will play a leading role in establishing robust, customized strategies and actions to tackle local climate challenges."
