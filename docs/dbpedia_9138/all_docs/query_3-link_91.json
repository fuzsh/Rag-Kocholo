        "text": "Cagatay Piyadeci, General Manager of Kastamonu Bulgaria AD\n\nCagatay Piyadeci is a mechanical engineer by profession. For 15 years, he has been working at Kastamomu Bulgaria AD, which is part of the multinational company Kastamomu Entegre, a global leader in the production of particle boards, MDF, laminate flooring, worktops and door panels. Before that, he worked for 5 years in the Republic of Türkiye and 11 years in the countries of the former Soviet Union.\n\n1. How did your company get through the pandemic? (And how did you respond to the events, were you able to recover to pre-Covid levels?) The last two years have been challenging for all of us. It was a period full of changes, differences and trials both for the employees and for our partners. Due to the specifics of our production, which is on a continuous cycle, a part of the employees remained at their workplaces, in strict compliance with anti-epidemic measures, while remote work was introduced for others. The pandemic has disrupted many supply chains, both for the basic raw materials and for finished products. Transport prices have also risen significantly. The effects of the pandemic have also led to lasting changes in consumer behavior. Forced to stay at home, they decided to make their living spaces more attractive for the long time they spend there. In general, the consumption of furniture, and therefore of the materials from which it is produced, increased. Despite the challenges, it has been two very successful years for us and Kastamonu Bulgaria has seen growth in its sales.\n\n2. Are the war in Ukraine, energy prices and inflation putting additional pressure on your usual activity? (if so, what mitigation measures are you taking?)\n\nOf course. Our industry is greatly affected by the increase in the prices of energy sources, as well as by the rising inflation worldwide. In the last two years, the price of electricity has increased by more than 5 times, natural gas by more than 4 times, and this directly affects the prices of our products. The price of wood also increased more than 2 times its price. For the last two years, the prices of electricity, natural gas and wood have increased several times, and this directly affects the prices of our products. The increase in the cost of the finished product leads to an increase in the prices to our customers, and hence to an increase in the prices of the furniture. This spiral will eventually lead to a decline in consumption and a reduction in demand.\n\n3. How do you compare with the global woodworking industry in terms of new technologies and equipment?\n\nInvestments are a priority in the management of the company. In recent years, a lot has been done regarding the implementation of the investment program in Bulgaria, related to the realization of new production facilities for the production of our goods. The first stage of the investment worth 52 million euros was completed, which ensured the improvement of product quality and the modernization of the production. The second stage of the investment worth 60 million euros, related to an increase in production capacity, is about to begin. We at Kastamonu define innovation as the new means of growth. Scientific and technological innovations are the engines of modernization and one of the most important factors for the progress and development of our society. At our R&D center in Tecnopark Istanbul, we work on product and process development, increasing productivity, efficient use of resources and advanced technologies.\n\n4. Where do you sell your products and has there been a change in the geography of sales in recent years? Kastamonu Bulgaria has a very well-established distribution network throughout the country. We work with some of the biggest furniture manufacturers as well as DIY stores. The main markets where we sell our products are Bulgaria and our neighboring countries, but we also export production to Italy and Saudi Arabia. During the crisis, due to the extremely high demand for our products, we had to prioritize deliveries to our long-term partners. For this reason, we have not expanded the geographic scope of our markets. In our short-term plans, however, there are investments related to an increase in production capacity and entry into new markets.\n\n5. Do you have a problem with attracting and retaining personnel?\n\nThe lack of qualified personnel continues to be a serious problem for businesses in Bulgaria, and the wood working sector is no exception. The retention of our personnel and their development are one of the main goals of the company. We have always provided a variety of social benefits, and every year we strive to expand their scope. We provide opportunities for career development, a flexible work process, create a motivating work environment, encourage staff to study at universities and annually organize trainings related to increasing the professional qualification and competence of our employees. To attract new qualified staff, we work together with Forestry University. Every year we organize visits of students from Forestry University so that they can touch the high technologies and the innovative products of the company, gain new knowledge and upgrade their skills in a real business environment. This year, for the first time, we launched a global internship program TalenTree, aimed at students in the 3rd and 4th year of universities, with which we want to attract young and talented people.\n\n6. The sector experiences a shortage of primary materials, but this problem appears cyclically over the years. What do you think should be the solution so that the industry does not suffer from a lack of timber?\n\nCurrently, one of the most serious problems in the sector is the provision of raw materials for a continuous production cycle like ours. The lack of wood is directly related to losses of unused production capacity. I believe that the correct way to solve this problem is through an active dialogue between the Chamber of Woodworking and Furniture Industry and the institutions to find an urgent solution. Тhe sustainable forest management and management would ensure the necessary growth of timber. A priority would be to work in the direction of legally limiting the burning of wood in Bulgaria by banning the export of wood and wood chips from our country. This will stop the export of a product with a low added value from Bulgaria and preserve the raw material for the Bulgarian wood processing industry. Afforestation, the use of recyclable materials, finding alternative raw materials and developing new technologies should be among the priorities set in the long-term programs for sustainable development in the sector. As one of the leading companies in the industry, we are engaged and work in this direction together with teachers and students from the Forestry University. In 2019, we also directed our efforts in the field of afforestation, planting 110,000 poplar saplings on an area of ​​nearly 900 acres in the Plovdiv region.\n\n7.What is your forecast for the development of the sector in the next few years?\n\nThe times in which we live are incomparable to any previous period. There are many problems and they are continuing. On the one hand, there is the lack of wood, which is the main raw material for the continuous cycle of our production, and on the other hand, there are the increasing prices of energy sources, of the main raw materials in our industry, the high inflation and stagnation of the markets, which is already felt throughout world. The purchasing power of consumers is going down. The demand for furniture, and hence for the materials from which they are made, is decreasing. I expect the markets in the first quarter of 2023 to remain the same, and then I hope they start to normalize.\n\n“We consider staff for the most valuable asset of the company.”\n\nCagatay Piyadeci was born in 1969. By profession he is a mechanical engineer. 9 years working in “Kastamonu Entegre – Bulgaria”, having previously worked five years in Turkey and 11 years in the former Soviet Union.\n\nDMT: What does it mean for you the reward of BCWFI “Corporate and socially responsible enterprise in 2015?”\n\nC.P.: This award was crucial for us.

What require the creation and investing in new production centers outside Turkey?\n\nC.P.: “For us, the team of Kastamonu Entegre goal is to be among the five largest manufacturers of wood panels in the world. Among the priority our plans appear and Bulgaria, as a member of the European Union gives us access to European markets.\n\nДМТ: Tell us more about an manufacturing center “Kastamonu Entegre” in Bulgaria!\n\nC.P.: In 1948, near the village. Gorno Sahrane, Gabrovnitsa AD started production as a small woodworking business. 1953 started investment in order to expand the scale of the factory, and in 1972 was made the largest modernization. In 1989 it purchased modern technology machinery from Germany, but for various reasons this investment process is not completed until 2000\n\nThe investment in Bulgaria Hayat Holding began with the purchase of Gabrovnitsa AD in 2000. In recent years after becoming property of Kastamonu Entegre – Hayat Holding install laminating press line, line for production of pellets, belt dryer and new electrostatic filter, meeting the latest environmental requirements. This year we built a factory for the production of urea-formaldehyde resin, working in a complex permit to use.\n\nTogether with the products we produce – chipboard, laminated particle board, wood pellet, on markets with that we are working with the products of holding company Kastamonu Entegre such as MDF, Laminated MDF, MDF panels for doors, HDF – lacquered gloss MDF boards Glossmax and Evogloss, worktops, laminated flooring.\n\nMajor markets of Kastamonu Bulgaria are Bulgarian and markets in Europe and Asia. The internal market can be defined as a market with national coverage, as the realization of finished products is carried out at companies whose main activity is the sale of materials for furniture manufacturing and furniture manufacturers. Our company by Bulgarian customers participate highly in furniture exports to the EU, where there is a high level of product quality in terms of technical, aesthetic, design and environmental performance.

Especially in Bulgaria, all requirements for the control of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food and the Executive Forest Agency to implement and support immediately.

Recently we have difficulty in finding suitable employees in Bulgaria, as well as look for trained and experienced staff and recent graduates, young people to train. Our observations are that young people prefer to work in abroad or in big cities.\n\nAnother important issue is the raw material. Given that wood is exported to neighboring countries instead be sold in an initial appearance, let the wood be sold after processing in our factory, it will multiply its value by 3-4 times, and this added value will remain in Bulgaria.\n\nDMT: How do you assess the regulatory framework in Bulgaria and have you encountered problems with it?\n\nC.P.: For us there is no problem when the standards applied in Bulgaria meet the requirements of the European Union.
