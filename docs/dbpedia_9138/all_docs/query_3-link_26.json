The aim of this study is to explore the usage of social media among the DMOs of the top 10 most visited countries by international tourists. The study uses content analysis and semi-structured interviews to examine the usage and impact of social media marketing strategies and identifies a framework of best practice for other national tourism organizations (NTOs) to learn from.

Social media offers DMOs with a tool to reach a global audience with limited resources. The aim of this study is to explore the usage of social media among the DMOs of the top 10 most visited countries by international tourists. The study uses content analysis and semistructured interviews to examine the usage and impact of social media marketing strategies and identifies a framework of best practice for other national tourism organizations (NTOs) to learn from. The study argues that social media usage among top DMOs is still largely experimental and that strategies vary significantly.\n\nCurrently, social media (and) marketing appears to be one of the most popular buzzwords in the tourism industry, especially among destination marketing organizations (DMOs). This study explores various definitions of social media (and) marketing and how this strategy can be implemented within the DMO VVV Hof van Twente. Furthermore, the study elaborates on the findings from a visitor survey and benchmark study and, deriving from these insights, suggests approaches for implementing social media within the organization&#39;s marketing strategy. This study concludes with an overview of limitations and suggestions for future research.\n\nSocial media provides customers and businesses of modern times with an unprecedented growth in ways of communication and interaction. Tourism organisations can benefi t from the limitless opportunities off ered by social media and ideally, evolve their relationship with their customers into a networked process of innovation. While there is a growing number of social media studies in the context of tourism, few researches have addressed the application of social media by tourism providers. Th us, this study employed an exploratory research design aimed at establishing a detailed understanding of current use of social media among National Tourism Organizations (NTOs) of the world’s 193 countries. To this end, data mining was used to identify the social media applications and types that are used by NTOs, and it was followed by content analysis, to investigate NTOs’ strategic use of social media. Th e fi ndings of this study suggest that many NTOs are still not aware of potential and op...\n\nIntroduction: The emergence of digital marketing has brought important changes in several industrial sectors, one of which is the tourism industry. This study aims to determine the role of digital marketing in tourist destinations. Methods: The research method used is descriptive qualitative. Results: The result of this study indicates that there are several digital marketing media used by tourists to get information about tourist objects they want to visit, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social media. Digital marketing also has a very big influence on increasing visits to several tourist destinations. Conclusion and suggestion: The use of digital marketing in the era of the digital economy industry plays a very important role in increasing tourism promotion. Digital marketing is a must because this generation often uses it, whether consciously or not. Digital marketing applications that will be used include websites, social media, online advertising, web forums, ...\n\nDestination Marketing Organizations (DMOs) have to redefine their marketing strategies, in order to meet current challenges in tourism, such as the emergence of new tourism destinations, the intense competition, the change in the motivations and preferences of tourists, as well as the global economic crisis. On the other hand, social media are gaining prominence, as a cost effective marketing tool with high returns. In this respect, the aim of this paper is to investigate the use of social media among 325 municipalities in Greece for destination marketing purposes. The results show that Greek municipalities just begin to recognize the added value of this new marketing trend, since social media exploitation is still very limited and largely experimental. Subsequently, the social media strategy of the Greek Municipality of Ierapetra – 'Visit Ierapetra' – is analyzed and presented. In the analysis, social media usage patterns were identified that could serve as good practices for other municipalities in Greece, at a time when public sector cuts in their funding are requiring them to seek greater value in the way marketing budgets are spent. Findings and discussion of this study are useful to industry practitioners and academic researchers interested in the use of social media in destination marketing.\n\nGlobalization and technological development make information spread easier and faster, particularly through social media. Tourists can get new information just in seconds. Social media can be used as an innovative tool to promote tourism destinations, especially in Indonesia. The use of social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram as a new 'word of mouth' promotions enables tourists to share their holiday experiences, seen by millions of others who want to have the same experience. The purpose of this study is to investigate the development of social media and tourism in Indonesia and to identify the role of social media in promoting tourist destinations in Indonesia. The data of this qualitative study was collected from books, journals and articles. This study finds that social media play a prominent role in promoting tourist destinations in Indonesia."
