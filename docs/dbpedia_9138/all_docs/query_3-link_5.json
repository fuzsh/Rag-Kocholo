        "text": "KASTAMONU fulfills its obligations to improve the level of environmental safety in the plant and its surrounding areas. This is confirmed by the results of the work of the plant’s environmental department for the first half of 2017.\n\nOur company entered the market of Tatarstan in 2014. One would think that with the construction of a large wood-processing plant, the environment would have deteriorated, but as a result of KASTAMONU’s careful strategy, in the last three years reforestation work in the republic has become more intensive. When initially discussing locating the plant at the Alabuga SEZ, special attention was paid to the issue of cooperation with local timber suppliers. For the product to be competitive, it was important to reduce the supply time of raw materials, and suppliers would ideally be located within a radius of no more than 200 km from the plant. This approach has had a positive impact both on the growth of the plant and the conservation of natural resources.\n\nKASTAMONU CEO Ali Kılıç said: \"Since commissioning the second MDF board production line, our demand for raw materials has increased to 1.2 -1.3 million m³. According to the Ministry of Forestry of Tatarstan, the planned logging area in the region today is about 2 million cubic meters of timber per year, which fully covers our needs and the needs of others. The planned logging area is the amount that is obtained as a result of clearing the forests of damaged trees as a result of sanitary cutting. We use timber obtained in this way. It is inexpedient to buy expensive timber, as we have access to cheaper raw materials.This does not affect the quality of the final product, but it does reduce its cost price. So we collect and use all the waste wood, improve the quality of the forest, and also use waste generated by sawmills.\"\n\nThe plant works only with FSC-certified suppliers, and while carrying out logging operations, they also carry out reforestation work on a comparable scale. Compliance with the certification is monitored by the FSC Forestry Council, an independent international organization working under the brand and in cooperation with the World Wildlife Fund.\n\nWhen the production of MDF/HDF boards and laminate flooring was launched in Tatarstan, KASTAMONU developed an environmental program which it carefully adheres to. At the construction stage of the plant, it was decided to use the world's leading technologies to minimize its environmental impact. FSC certification was obtained immediately after the plant was opened. A little later, CE certification was also obtained, which allows the company to sell products in the European Union and compete with European producers.\n\nIn three years, investments in environmental measures have increased significantly; in 2016, 68.207 million roubles were allocated for environmental protection measures (in 2015 – 36.23 million roubles, and in 2014 – 4.44 million roubles), and 42 environmental projects were implemented to protect the environment from pollution (40 in 2015, and 27 in 2014).\n\nThis year the company is continuing to adhere to its strategy to save energy and resources. \"The entire technological process is structured in such a way so as to ensure the minimal amount of waste is produced and raw materials are fully used,\" said Ali Kılıç. The production process leads to the formation of 96 types of waste, and more than 80% of this is utilized by KASTAMONU for production purposes. The plant has specially equipped areas for the separate collection and temporary storage of waste, with special-purpose containers for collecting production and consumption waste. We have entered into agreements with specialized companies to recycle and bury production and consumption waste.\n\nThe company's water supply is centralized under an agreement with Alabuga SEZ, the area in and around the plant is equipped with a runoff water system. There are local treatment facilities for purifying industrial wastewater from plants. Wastewater passes through several stages of purification (mechanical, biological, chemical), and is then used in various areas of the plant as process water, and partially transferred to the waste water system of the Alabuga SEZ.\n\nSince the beginning of 2017, analytical environmental monitoring has been conducted, including an analysis of storm water for 7 indicators, domestic wastewater for 26, and drinking water for 17 sanitary and chemical, and 4 microbiological indicators. The standards for these indicators were not exceeded.\n\nThe work of the KASTAMONU environmental department aimed at the prevention and reduction of environmental pollution and compliance with the requirements of environmental legislation is of particular importance. During the first half of 2017, the department conducted 20 inspections and issued instructions to company units on 34 violations of environmental legislation, all of which have been eliminated. Also in the first half of 2017, 35 company employees received training and certification under the Professional Training of Individuals for the Right to Work with Hazardous Wastes program."
