        "text": "Claimant and Counterclaim-Respondent Exclusive Trim Inc. (\"ETI\"), an American residential door distributor based in Florida, entered into a door skin Supply Agreement on August 24, 2020, with Respondent and Counterclaimant Kastamonu Romania, S.A. (\"Kastamonu\"), a Romanian door skin manufacturer (ETI and Kastamonu are collectively referred to herein as the \"Parties\"). The Agreement required that a minimum number of skins must be purchased in the first year. After the delivery of a portion of the door skins far less than the minimum required, ETI informed Kastamonu that it was getting out of the door-making business and that it would not purchase any more door skins. A dispute subsequently arose between the Parties concerning certain deposits made by ETI, which Kastamonu did not return, and ETI's refusal to purchase and take certain door skins that Kastamonu produced.\n\nKastamonu paid Figli $610,000 for sixteen molds. Kastamonu's payment to Figli is covered by a \"Mold Deposit\" from ETI of $220,000, and a letter of credit from ETI for the remaining $390,000 \"for security of the Mold Purchase Price\" (hereinafter the letter of credit is referred to as \"LOC\") Agmt. ¶ 2(c). Combined, the Mold Deposit and the LOC totaled $610,000, the cost of the molds. The Parties agreed that Kastamonu would return the Mold Deposit and the LOC to ETI once ETI purchased the minimum number of skins:\n\nKASTAMONU agrees to return (i) the payment of Mold Deposit amounting to $220,000 to the BUYER provided that BUYER purchases and pays for 1,000,000 skins of Products during the Initial Term, and (ii) return the Letter of Credit to the Buyer, if BUYER meets with Minimum Purchase Amount and pays for 2,000,000 skins of Products during the Initial Term of this Agreement… KASTAMONU is entitled to retain full amount of the Mold Deposit and/or cash out the Letter of Credit, if the BUYER fails to meet with the purchase and payment of 1,000,000 skins or the Minimum Purchase Amount, respectively during the Initial Term of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing and payment of Mold Deposit and provision of the Letter of Credit by the BUYER, KASTAMONU shall own and retain the ownership of the Molds during the Initial Term, Renewal Term, and thereafter.\n\nId. ¶ 2(d) (the \"Mold Deposit and LOC retention provision\").\n\nThe Agreement states:\n\nAny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The controversy shall be submitted to and settled by three arbitrators. The arbitrations will be selected from the East Coast. The locale will be New York.\n\nId.\n\nOn June 23, 2021, Kastamonu informed ETI that it had in stock 280,000 of ETI's skins which had not been collected by ETI, or paid for. Ex. RE 38 (Email from H. Osmanoglu to L. Graef, copying H. Baybek, A. Alvarez, and C. Montes, dated June 23, 2021). Kastamonu wrote:\n\nAs you know that according to contract we must keep it [ETI's \"Mold Deposit\"] until we produce and sell 2 million pieces from these dies. Now we sell 230,000 pieces and we have 280.000 pieces in stock. If you let us to sell these models to other clients in world wide, we will be able to reach 2 million within a couple of months.\n\nId. Mr. Graef responded \"Hi Hakan: Please proceed selling all 280,000 pieces of Skin asap. Thanks.\" Id. (Email from L. Graef to H. Osmanoglu et al., dated June 23, 2021). The same day, in a separate email, Mr. Osmanoglu wrote again to Mr. Graef: \"there are not 42,000 pieces in our stock, it is 280,000 pieces. We can sell them to Optim or Turkey domestic market no problem.\" Graef 1st WS ¶ 13; and id., Ex. 8 (Email from H. Osmanoglu to L. Graef, copying H. Baybek, and A. Alvarez, dated June 23, 2021)).\n\nOn July 13, 2021, Mr. Graef emailed Kastamonu that in June:\n\nI have requested for you to sell to local and or any markets, all 280,000 skins. I have also requested till the end of July to pay the balance, which you are requesting\n\nHakan, I know that Eugene [Malkin, of ETI] who is no longer with the company was sending the orders, and he went to crazy ordering, I really need your help selling the skins, I'm working to sell the skins, I'm talking to 2 companies, but you know this takes time, I should know in about 2 weeks, but if they buy, I think they will order like 50,000 skins 2 pnl per week.\n\nI just need more time, I can't pay at this moment the 230k you are requesting, I just need a couple more weeks.\n\nEx. RE 43.\n\nAs noted, Kastamonu's payment of $610,000 to Figli for the skin molds was financed by a \"Mold Deposit\" from ETI of $220,000, and a letter of credit from ETI for the remaining $390,000 \"for security of the Mold Purchase Price.\" Agmt. ¶ 2(c). Paragraph 2(d) of the Agreement provided that Kastamonu would return the Mold Deposit and LOC to ETI only if ETI purchases the Minimum Purchase Amount of two million door skins:\n\nKASTAMONU agrees to return (i) the payment of Mold Deposit amounting to $220,000 to the BUYER provided that BUYER purchases and pays for 1,000,000 skins of Products during the Initial Term, and (ii) return the Letter of Credit to the Buyer, if BUYER meets with Minimum Purchase Amount and pays for 2,000,000 skins of Products during the Initial Term of this Agreement… KASTAMONU is entitled to retain full amount of the Mold Deposit and/or cash out the Letter of Credit, if the BUYER fails to meet with the purchase and payment of 1,000,000 skins or the Minimum Purchase Amount, respectively during the Initial Term of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing and payment of Mold Deposit and provision of the Letter of Credit by the BUYER, KASTAMONU shall own and retain the ownership of the Molds during the Initial Term, Renewal Term, and thereafter.\n\nId. ¶ 2(d).\n\nSecond, the Parties agree that the Mold Deposit and LOC provision is not a liquidated damages provision. Kastamonu Reply Pre-Hearing Brief at 11 (\"The clause authorizing Kastamonu to retain the advanced deposit funds does not constitute a 'liquidated damages' provision under New York law\"). I agree. A liquidated damages provision seeks to estimate in advance actual damages:\n\nLiquidated damages are an estimate, made by the parties at the time they enter into their agreement, of the extent of the injury that would be sustained as a result of breach of the agreement (Truck Rent-A-Ctr. v Puritan Farms 2nd, 41 NY2d 420, 424 [1977]). A liquidated damage provision has its basis in the principle of just compensation for loss (id., citing Restatement [First] of Contracts § 339 and Comment).\n\nTrs. of Columbia Univ., 36 N.Y.3d at 74-75. Here, \"Kastamonu and ETI did not attempt to determine their potential damages in the event of a breach.\" Kastamonu Reply Pre-Hearing Brief at 12.\n\nMoreover, liquidated damages are appropriate where the calculation of actual damages \"would be difficult, if not actually impossible\", and therefore parties agree in advance the amount of damages to be paid \"rather than leaving that amount to the calculation of a court or jury.\" Truck Rent-A-Center, Inc., 41 N.Y.2d at 424. Here, however, as Kastamonu argues, the calculation of damages is quite simple:\n\nAny damages for a breach, such as if ETI ordered a quantity of door skins and did not pay for them, could only be determined based on the quantity of door skins that were ordered but not paid for.\n\nKastamonu Reply Pre-Hearing Brief at 12. Thus, there was no legitimate need for a liquidated damages provision, and the Parties did not intend the Mold Deposit or LOC retention provision to estimate damages. I conclude, therefore, that Section 2 is not a liquidated damages provision.\n\nA similar possibility was present in Trs. of Columbia Univ.:\n\nA simple hypothetical further illustrates the penalizing nature of the liquidated damages provision here. According to plaintiff's interpretation of the surrender agreement, if defendant timely made all but the final monthly surrender payment of $15,977.43, defendant's breach would render it liable for $1,020,125.15 plus interest and additional costs. Defendant would be liable for the total amount remaining due under the terminated lease, and defendant would be forced to pay that amount, rather than the final installment, without having had the benefit of the premises which it had surrendered to plaintiff. There is but one way to refer to this outcome: an unenforceable penalty.\n\nTrs. of Columbia Univ., 36 N.Y.3d at 77.\n\nThus, I find that Kastamonu's efforts to mitigate were not reasonable in light of the following:\n\n• the lack of sufficient evidence of pro-active efforts by Kastamonu to reach out to existing or potential customers;\n\n• the delays in responding to Young Doors' inquiries and to sending samples to Young Doors; and\n\n• the statements by Kastamonu's employee Hakan Osmanoglu in the summer of 2020 to ETI that Kastamonu could easily sell all of the skins remaining in under the Parties' Agreement.\n\nSince Kastamonu failed to make reasonable efforts to mitigate its damages, Kastamonu's counterclaim is denied.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, I award as follows:\n\n1. Within thirty (30) days from the date of transmittal of this Final Award to the Parties, Kastamonu Romania S.A., hereinafter referred to as Kastamonu, shall pay to Exclusive Trim Inc., hereinafter referred to as ETI, the sum of $610,000.\n\n2. Kastamonu's counterclaims against ETI are denied.\n\n3. Within thirty (30) days from the date of transmittal of this Final Award to the Parties, Kastamonu, shall pay to ETI the sum of $256,292.00 for ETI's attorneys' fees and $78,659.28 for ETI's arbitration costs and expenses.\n\n4. The administrative fees and expenses of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (ICDR) totaling US$25,750.00 shall be borne by Kastamonu, and the compensation and expenses of the arbitrator totaling US$51,350.00 shall be borne by Kastamonu. Therefore, Kastamonu shall reimburse ETI the sum of US $38,550.00, representing that portion of said fees and expenses in excess of the apportioned costs previously incurred by ETI.\n\n5. Any of the above amounts not paid within thirty (30) days from the date of transmittal of this Final Award shall be subject to nine (9) percent annual simple interest.\n\n6. This award is in full settlement of all claims and counterclaims submitted to this Arbitration.\n\nI hereby certify that, for the purposes of Article I of the New York Convention of 1958, on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, this Final Award was made in New York City, New York, United States of America.\n\nDate: March 9, 2023"
