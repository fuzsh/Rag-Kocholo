        "text": "Ali Kılıç, General Director of KASTAMONU in Russia, described the most promising projects, landmark events, new products and investments.\n\nLet's start with the staff training. The second year KASTAMONU RUSSIA continues its cooperation with the Corporate University of the Alabuga SEZ. How do you assess the results of the interaction?\n\nIn my opinion, the positive effect of our joint work with the university is obvious: firstly, it is the support of the most active, talented, ambitious young managers, which is very important, and secondly, a kind of \"casting\" for those who would like to further join our team. As a university lecturer, I constantly communicate with listeners, we regularly invite young managers to our production facilities - we organize practical courses on the management of industrial enterprises. The Corporate University, of course, helps the partner companies in resolving the personnel issue, I am sure that successful graduates will be able to apply all their knowledge at our enterprise.\n\nKASTAMONU RUSSIA very actively participates in professional exhibitions and forums. What events do you consider the most effective?\n\n40% of products manufactured by KASTAMONU RUSSIA are sold outside of Russia\n\nThe most high-status and significant event, of course, is our participation in the 21st International Economic Forum in St. Petersburg. We held several working meetings and discussed with the colleagues the prospects for the development of the timber industry complex.\n\nProfessional exhibitions were also very successful for us: when participating in the Mebel 2017 largest industry salon, the company for the first time represented a two-storey stand with an area of 270 m² and more than 160 samples of products from the Alabuga-based plant, for the second year in a row we were among the winners of the prestigious ecological rating GoodWood in the \"Manufacturers and Sellers of Floor Coverings\" nomination. For the first time our products appeared in China: within the framework of the joint exhibition stand of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation, we became the participants of the authoritative international exhibition SYLVA WOOD in Shanghai.\n\n2017 ended with the creation of a furniture cluster, where KASTAMONU RUSSIA acts as the anchor company. In your opinion, what are the main advantages of working within the cluster?\n\nPeople living in Russia often repeat the folk wisdom \"One man no man\", thus the joint efforts of employees and enterprises are only beneficial for any industry. The furniture cluster presupposes, first of all, business contacts between enterprises, cooperation, reduction of logistics costs and even specialized training of personnel, and as a result, improvement of the quality and competitiveness of products. It is easier for cluster enterprises to register inventions and trademarks, launch an innovative project or master a new segment of the market. Today, the government of Tatarstan follows the program of production development based on the cluster approach, while the state has developed a whole list of measures to support clusters, and this also contributes to our unification. It is of fundamental importance for KASTAMONU to remain a part of the industry community: developing wood processing and furniture production in general, we are working for the future - we ensure the future expansion of the sales market.\n\nKASTAMONU RUSSIA always pays special attention to environmental issues, what initiatives in this direction have become of priority for the company this year?\n\nI am very pleased with the results of the year in terms of supporting projects related to the environment. Suffice to say that KASTAMONU has become the general partner of the most massive environmental campaign \"Earth Hour\", which is held under the auspices of the World Wildlife Fund. This year, a delegation of journalists from Kazan visited KASTAMONU to personally assess how environmentally safe our production is. The guests were especially impressed with an excursion to the water treatment facilities and a story about our wasteless production. We purify industrial wastewater so thoroughly that after purification this water can be even drunk, not mentioning the reuse in the process. The treatment facilities have been operating for the third year and cost the company more than $ 10 million, but the company does not save on environmental safety.\n\nOne of the secrets of success in business is the expansion and renewal of the product range. What novelties and why did the company launch this year?\n\nThis year, three premium collections of laminated floors with deep embossing and acrylic panels for furniture facades were launched into the batch production. We have already presented new products at the Moscow exhibition Mebel 2017.\n\nOur technologists closely follow the fashion trends in the field of design and architecture, and we, of course, bring to the market potentially popular brands. The range of our laminated floors already includes more than 160 decors, while glossy and acrylic panels - more than 80, and currently we carefully study the feedback of customers and plan to develop a line of new products taking into account the demand.\n\nIn 2017 KASTAMONU first entered the prestigious in terms of design Italian market. What are the objectives of the new division of the company in Europe?\n\n33%\n\nshare of KASTAMONU in the general export of laminate among Russian manufacturers\n\nThe KASTAMONU group of companies has become the owner of GruppoTrombini with two factories for the production of particleboard in northern Italy, we plan to start operating these facilities in 2018. New investments are another step to expand our production capacity in Europe, today the company is represented by 15 plants around the world. Italy is a recognized center of fashion and design, and one of the world's leading furniture manufacturers.\n\nKASTAMONU expects to eventually take about 20% of the Italian market in its segment. Our new acquisition will undoubtedly become a new page in the history of the company and will bring not only dividends, but also the status of one of the largest European producers.\n\nIt is simply impossible to discuss a year of such a large company in the context of one interview. But if you simply list the facts that are the pride of the company this year, what news have particularly pleased personally you during 2017?\n\nI am sure that our entire company is especially proud of the award in the nomination \"Best Project for Import Substitution\", which we received as a result of the contest \"Leaders of Russian Business: Dynamics and Responsibility\". This year we confirmed the validity of the international WKI certificate for wood MDF boards, once again proved the quality and safety of our products and compliance with the highest European standards. Personally, I am very pleased with our constant friendly communication with Russian dealers and distributors who regularly come with excursions to the plant, and this year they gathered at a conference in Moscow and even went together to the Bolshoi Theater.\n\nAnother great new tradition of the company is family excursions to the production, when parents proudly tell the children about their work at the KASTAMONU plant. This year our company launched a very emotional campaign \"Open Your Heart to Gratitude\" - it is important to give really kind, sympathetic and respectable people not only a word. Next year, I'm sure, will be even more dynamic for the company and for the Russian business in general."
