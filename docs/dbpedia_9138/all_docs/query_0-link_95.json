        "text": "Ali Fikri Isik, the author of the book Amedspor: Chaos and Resistance, told Kurdistan Chronicle in an interview that the recent success of the Kurdish team Amedspor is a triumph for all Kurds.\n\nThe team is from Diyarbakir, a city in the southeast of Turkey that serves as the informal capital of the country’s Kurdish minority and is also known by its Kurdish name Amed.\n\nAmedspor secured a 1-0 victory against the Turkish club Kastamonuspor on April 4, extending its reach to the championship at 77 points, whereas Kastamonuspor stayed behind at 71. Jubilant Amedspor fans celebrated the victory both in and outside Diyarbakir with fireworks and traditional Kurdish dancing.\n\n“Amedspor has showcased a stellar performance this season, emerging as early frontrunners in the league and maintaining dominance for an extended period,” football commentator and author Isik told Kurdistan Chronicle.\n\n“The jubilant scenes and grand celebrations witnessed after last week’s match epitomized the thrill of triumphing over a formidable adversary on their home turf, widening the points gap to six. Amedspor stands on the cusp of clinching the championship, and is poised to solidify their title with a victory in one of the remaining matches.”\n\nAs one of the few venues left for Kurdish cultural pride in Turkey in the face of a century of repression – apart from traditional clothing and the promotion of the Kurdish language – football increasingly seems to have taken hold among Turkey’s Kurds in recent years as a means to express identity.\n\nNow, Amedspor’s win is a chance to celebrate something that belongs to them.\n\n“Last year, Bursaspor fans and ultranationalists attacked the Amedspor team, and Amedspor didn’t succeed in the TFF Second League,” Kurdish sports journalist Halil Ibrahim Cengiz told Kurdistan Chronicle.\n\n“But this year they are winning. There are three matches left, and if they win, then they can join the TFF First League. If they also succeed in this, they can go on to the Super League to play against Galatarasray and Fenerbahce. It’s a very big win for Amedspor.”\n\nThanks to the win, Amedspor can now attract much more attention at home and abroad. If the team successfully plays its way into the Turkish Super League, it will be able to play in the UEFA Europa League – and, if they win the championship, the UEFA Champions League.\n\n“This triumph propels Amedspor into the Turkish First League. Beyond this lies the illustrious Turkish Super League. Should Amedspor clinch the championship in the First League next season, it will cement its status as a contender against formidable Turkish giants like Galatasaray, Fenerbahce, and Besiktas,“ Isik said. “The first hurdle is to ascend from the First League to the Super League.”\n\nMuch like Barcelona, Amedspor is more than just a team, Isik notes. It represents a nation. “Thus, the success of Amedspor resonates as a triumph for all Kurds.”\n\n“Amedspor currently stands as a beacon for cultural and social values, solidifying its position as the sporting symbol of a nation. The Kurdish community craves inspiring success stories, and Amedspor delivers just that with its championship victory.”\n\nAmedspor Club President Aziz Elaldi said in a statement following the win that now the “children in the (Kurdish) region are neither Galatasaray nor Fenerbahçe fans anymore. Every child has started to support the Amedspor team.”\n\nThe team itself is one of the official sports clubs of the provincial municipality of Diyarbakir.\n\nBoth the team and municipality have come under attacks politically and physically for years due to their Kurdish background.\n\nThe Turkish government has deposed elected mayors in past decades and appointed trustees to run several Kurdish municipalities, including Diyarbakir. Meanwhile, fans of rival clubs have attacked Amedspor players and fans.\n\nHowever, the government-appointed trustee mayors of Diyarbakir were replaced in the local elections that took place on March 31 by the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Equality and Democracy (DEM) Party candidates Serra Bucak and Dogan Hatun.\n\nIn March last year, Amedspor players were attacked by Bursaspor security personnel and club staff in Bursa. In December, violence erupted during a match between Bursaspor and Diyarbakirspor, another team from Diyarbakir.\n\nNevertheless, violence has erupted between Turkish teams as well. In March of this year, Trabzonspor fans armed with weapons attacked celebrating Fenerbahce players.\n\nHowever, there were no incidents during the latest match, which took place in Kastamonuspor – although Amedspor fans were not allowed to attend the match due to ‘“security concerns.” Amedspor fans watched the matches on big screens in Diyarbakir.\n\nFurthermore, Kastamonuspor welcomed the Kurds in peace, as per the mayor of Kastamonu’s call to fans.\n\n“Amedspor is our rival on the field and a guest in our city. Let’s not forget that sports are about love, friendship, peace and brotherhood,\" Mayor Hasan Baltaci said in a video message on the social media platform X just before the match.\n\nAdditionally, after Amedspor’s win, Kastamonuspor Club President Cengiz Aygun wished “Amedspor success on their way to the First League.”"
