From the beginning of their relationship, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck have prioritized the well-being of their children. They have made sure to maintain a healthy relationship with their children and with Jennifer Garner, the mother of Affleck’s three children. They have a cordial and respectful bond and even attended important events for Violet, Seraphina, and Samuel. Recently, some photos were released showing JLo, Affleck, and Garner attending a boys’ school event in Los Angeles, California.

JLo and Ben were recently spotted with their children and Jennifer’s ex-husband Marc Anthony. The group had reportedly attended their children’s performance, and they all seemed to be in high spirits in the photographs. After the show, Jennifer Garner left with her children Seraphina, 14, and Samuel, 11, followed by Ben and JLo with JLo’s daughter Emme Muñiz, 15.
