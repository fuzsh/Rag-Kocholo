        "text": "As Hollywood prepares to unwrap its assorted films for the holiday season, there is but one question that matters.\n\nWith “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” set to debut in December, does any other film matter?\n\nNo and yes.\n\nNo because that film, the last in what could be called the Skywalker Chronicles, closes the door on that era of tales from a galaxy far, far away. However, more importantly, it’s a series that literally spans generations with the first of the nine films having debuted in 1977.\n\nIt’s the magic from that first film, “Star Wars” and its trilogy partners “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi,” parents passed on to our children — in some cases much to our chagrin. For this final outing, director J.J. Abrams (“Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens”) returns to the director’s chair after ceding it to Rian Johnson for the eighth film in the series. Will it mark a cultural milestone? Sorry, I can’t peer into the future, but it could be intriguing despite the fact other “Star Wars”-related films, “Han Solo: A Star Wars Story,” supposedly stumbled.\n\nBut not everyone is into “Star Wars” and, thankfully, there will be plenty other films from which to choose this holiday season. Some debuted Wednesday or before and others dot the release calendar until the end of the year.\n\nSome of the more intriguing possibilities include “Bombshell,” a film based on true events that transpired at Fox News. There’s an adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Cats” on the menu as well as “1917,” a World War I epic directed by Oscar winner Sam Mendes.\n\nFor Michael B. Jordan fans: he co-stars with Brie Larson in the legal drama “Just Mercy.”\n\nHoliday movies\n\n“Knives Out” (Lionsgate): It’s a family affair as a detective (Daniel Craig) sifts through a shady familial unit in an attempt to learn who killed its patriarch in this comedy — yes, comedy —featuring an impressive cast with Michael Shannon, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis and Lakeith Stanfield.\n\n“Queen & Slim” (Universal Pictures): A couple’s first date goes horribly awry when they’re pulled over by the police. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith star in the leading roles.\n\n“The Irishman” (Netflix): Director Martin Scorsese looks at the rise of organized crime through the eyes of Frank Sheeran (Robert DeNiro), a career criminal who served as a hitman and knew and worked for some of the most notorious crime figures in America. Scorsese. DeNiro. Al Pacino. Joe Pesci. Harvey Keitel. Seriously, is anyone not all in on this one? It’s in theaters, but debuted on Netflix Nov. 27.\n\nFriday\n\n“Honey Boy” (Amazon): A semi-autobiographical film written by actor Shia LaBeouf based on his experiences growing up.\n\n“Marriage Story” (Netflix): Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson star as a couple living on opposite sides of the country who have to contend with their marriage’s slow disintegration and all that entails for them, including how it affects their respective careers.\n\nDec. 6\n\n“The Aeronauts” (Amazon): Oscar nominee Felicity Jones and Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne re-team in the story of a gas balloon pilot (Jones) and the scientist who works with her to ascend to record heights in the mid-19th century. Their pairing makes this worth taking a look.\n\n“Playmobil: The Movie” (DMG Entertainment): A young woman travels to the animated world of Playmobil to find her missing younger brother. The English-language French animated adventure comedy is based on the German building toy Playmobil. My advice: Be afraid of films released at Christmastime that are based on toys.\n\nDec. 13\n\n“A Hidden Life” (Fox Searchlight): Acclaimed director Terrence Malick returns to film. He explores the true story of Franz Jägerstätter, an Austrian farmer who refused to fight for the Nazis during World War II. He faces the prospect of execution for his beliefs and must rely on faith and family to get through.\n\n“Jumanji: The Next Level” (Columbia): The minute the remake from 2017 – “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,” struck box office gold, the sequel was inevitable. Same cast, but whether they can turn in something as satisfying to audiences as the original that’s not just warmed over video game bits and bytes remains to be seen.\n\n“Richard Jewell” (Warner Bros.): Director Clint Eastwood peers into the events surrounding the hero security guard of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.\n\nDec. 20\n\n“Bombshell” (Lionsgate): It tells the story of several Fox News reporters including Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman), Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron) and Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie) who dealt with alleged sexual harassment from network chief Roger Ailes (John Lithgow) and eventually take him on. Directed by Jay Roach of Austin Powers fame.\n\n“Cats” (Universal): For anyone who’s seen the tripendicular trailer, then you know the scenes of celebrities dressed as kitties look a tad bit endearing and make viewers feel as if they’ve entered some alternate universe created internally by mind-altering substances. Of course it’s based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber long-running Broadway production of the same name. The fact it’s directed by Oscar-winner Tom Hooper (“The King’s Speech”), who also adapted “Les Miserables” for the screen in 2012, provides hope.\n\n“Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” (Disney/Lucasfilm): The last in the Skywalker Family Chronicles comes more than 42 years after the original “Star Wars” film debuted and became a cinematic legend spawning — for better or worse, depending on your point of view — the blockbuster film franchise. The film is the subject of too much speculation to attempt to distill a plot. J.J. Abrams returns to direct this installment.\n\nDec. 25\n\n“1917” (Universal): Oscar winning director Sam Mendes (“American Beauty”) directs this story of two British World War I soldiers who undertake a dangerous mission that will save the lives of hundreds of their colleagues if they’re successful.,\n\n“Just Mercy” (Warner Bros.): Michael B. Jordan stars as a young attorney working to free a man wrongly convicted of the murder of an 18-year-old girl in Alabama in 1987. Brie Larson co-stars in this legal drama that puts a mirror to the legal system.\n\n“Little Women” (Columbia): Director Greta Gerwig offers her take on Louisa May Alcott’s classic story about the March sisters, which has been adapted for the screen — both film and television — at least 20 times over the years. The cast includes Meryl Streep, Laura Dern, Emma Watson and Saoirse Ronan.\n\n“Spies in Disguise” (20th Century Fox): Will Smith provides the voice of a suave, debonair spy in this animated film that also features Tom Holland (Spider-Man) as his tech guru.\n\nTBD\n\n“Seberg” (Amazon): This explores the relationship between actress Jean Seberg (Kristen Stewart) and the controversy her relationship with civil rights activist Hakim Jamal (Anthony Mackie) generated in the 1960s. She became the subject of an FBI investigation.\n\n“Ordinary Love” (Bleecker Street): Liam Neeson and Lesley Manville star as a married couple who have to deal with a breast cancer diagnosis putting a road block in their way.\n\n“Les Miserables” (Amazon): Tensions among neighborhood Parisian groups are explored in this French film."
