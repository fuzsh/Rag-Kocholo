        "text": "Ideally, we're all searching for that one person to spend the rest of our lives with—however long that may take. But for some, specifically many Hollywood A-listers, tying the knot more than once (or twice, or three times) is a just a regular part of life. Click through to see which of your favorite celebrities have walked down the aisle several times.\n\nMadonna\n\nMadonna first tied the knot with Sean Penn (1) in 1985 when the two of them were both relatively new on the Hollywood scene. She even dedicated her third album, True Blue, to Penn the year that followed. Their romance only lasted about four years before the singer filed for divorce in 1989. More than a decade passed before Madonna said \"I do\" to English filmmaker, Guy Ritchie (2.) Their marriage lasted eight years before Madonna filed for divorce in 2008.\n\nKim Kardashian West\n\nKim Kardashian West eloped with music producer Damon Thomas (1) in 2000 and they divorced in 2004. Her second marriage was to basketball player Kris Humphries (2) in 2011, and after just 72 days of marriage she filed for divorce. Kim went on to marry her third husband, Kanye West (3) in 2014 and they have a daughter and son together.\n\nReese Witherspoon\n\nReese Witherspoon married her first husband Ryan Phillippe (1) in 1999 and they had two daughters and a son together before divorcing in 2007. Witherspoon married her second husband, Jim Toth (2) in 2011 with whom she has another son.\n\nBritney Spears\n\nBritney Spears had a brief first marriage (it lasted just over two days) to her childhood friend Jason Alexander (1) in January of 2004 after getting hitched in Las Vegas. After the annulment, Spears went on to marry Kevin Federline (2) later that year. They were together until 2007 and have two children.\n\nRyan Reynolds\n\nRyan Reynolds tied the knot with his first wife, Scarlett Johansson (1) in 2008 and they separated in 2010. Reynolds married his second wife, Blake Lively (2) in 2012 and the couple now has two daughters.\n\nJennifer Aniston\n\nJennifer Aniston was famously married to Brad Pitt (1) from 2000 to 2005. Aniston then started dating Jason Theroux (2) in 2011 and the couple wed in 2015.\n\nRussell Brand\n\nRussell Brand tied the knot with his first wife, Katy Perry (1), in 2010 and the two were separated in 2011. Brand then went on to marry his second wife, Laura Gallacher (2), earlier this year.\n\nAngelina Jolie\n\nAngelina Jolie met her first husband, Jonny Lee Miller (1), on set while filming the movie Hackers.
