So I don't really count those,\" Lopez shared in a June 2019 YouTube video prior to her 2022 marriage to Ben Affleck. Her comment was made in reference to her ex-husbands Ojani Noa, Cris Judd and Marc Anthony. She continued: \"It seems like in this life you're always surrounded by people so you're never lonely, but it's very lonely. So, I felt like if I got married, then I would always have somebody, but that's not how life works. That's not how it goes. It's a bad reason to get married.” It was during her decade-long marriage to Anthony that she welcomed her two children, twins Max and Emme. \"I was married to Marc for 10 years with the kids. I was very young the first two times I tried to get married — I'm saying tried to get married,” she said at the time. Lopez and fiancé Alex Rodriguez got engaged in March 2019 and were set to wed in 2020, but their wedding was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The two ultimately split in April 2021.

She married Jeremy Thomas (1994-1995), comedian and actor Tom Green (2001-2002), and Will Kopelman in June 2012. Barrymore and Kopelman welcomed daughter Olive in September 2012 and daughter Frankie in 2014.\n\nThe Santa Clarita Diet star and Kopelman split in 2016 after three years of marriage.\n\nCredit: John Barrett/Photolink/Mediapunch/Shutterstock\n\nPam Anderson\n\nNumber of marriages: 4\n\nThe former Playboy model was married to Tommy Lee (1995-1998), with whom she has sons Brandon and Dylan, Kid Rock (2006-2007) and Rick Salomon (2007-2008). In January 2014, she revealed she and Salomon secretly remarried.\n\nAnderson and Salomon split again in July 2014. Their divorce was finalized in 2015.\n\nWhile the Baywatch alum made headlines in January 2020 for marrying Jon Peters, the twosome split less than two weeks after their alleged nuptials. Anderson later revealed that they never legally tied the knot.\n\n“I wasn’t married,” she told The New York Times that May. “No. I’m a romantic. I think I’m an easy target. And I think people just live in fear. I don’t know what all that was about, but I think fear really played a lot into it.”\n\nCredit: Klein Bruno/ABACA/Shutterstock\n\nNicolas Cage\n\nNumber of marriages: 3\n\nThe National Treasure 3 actor has walked down the aisle three times. He was married to Patricia Arquette (1995-2001), Lisa Marie Presley (2002-2004) and wed his third wife, Alice Kim, in 2004. The couple welcomed son Kal-El in 2005. (He's also dad to son West with ex Christina Fulton).\n\nCage split from Kim in 2016 and moved on with Erika Koike. While the actor and Koike tied the knot in Las Vegas in March 2019, he filed for an annulment four days later. The twosome were granted a divorce that June."
