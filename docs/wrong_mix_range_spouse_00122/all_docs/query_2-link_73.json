        "text": "Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez\n\nJennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck, once known by their couple name \"Bennifer,\" met on the set of Gigli in 2002 and were briefly engaged until their breakup in 2004.\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Affleck said the two still keep in touch. \"We don't have the kind of relationship where she relies on me for advice, … but we do have the kind of relationship where there'll be an email saying, 'Oh, your movie looks great,'\" he said. \"I remember when she got American Idol. I said: 'This was really smart. Good luck.' I touch base. I respect her. I like her. She's put up with some stuff that was unfair in her life, and I'm really pleased to see her successful.\"\n\nDavid Beckham and Victoria Beckham\n\nFamously known as \"Posh and Becks,\" David and Victoria Beckham started dating at their height of their fame in 1997, before tying the knot at a lavish wedding in 1999.\n\nDavid Beckham told Entertainment Tonight in January 2017, after the couple recently renewed their wedding vows, \"We know each other better than anybody. People have talked about, 'Do we stay together because it's a brand?' Of course not. We stay together because we love each other, because we have four amazing children. … Do you go through tough times? Of course. That's part of relationships. It's part of marriages. It's part of having children. It's part of having responsibilities.\"\n\nOrlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr\n\nOrlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr separated after three years of marriage in 2013, but the two have worked to maintain their relationship and remain friends to this day. Kerr is currently engaged to Snapchat SEO Evan Spiegel, while Bloom is dating Katy Perry.\n\nThe supermodel told Cosmopolitan in 2013, \"The worst thing you can do is go looking for a partner. You have to embrace the time you have to yourself and do things that nurture your mind and soul. If the right partner is around, he'll come to you.\"\n\nHumphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall\n\nHumphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall had a love for the ages, beginning when the two starred opposite each other in To Have and Have Not in 1944. Bacall wrote her number on a matchbox for Bogart one day on set, and they were married a short year later. The pair stayed together until his death in 1957.\n\nIn a 2011 Vanity Fair interview, Bacall said, \"I never said [Bogart] was perfect, because God knows he was not. Who would want to be married to somebody perfect? I wouldn't.\"\n\nDavid Bowie and Iman\n\nDavid Bowie and Iman met at a dinner party in 1990 and were married two years later, staying together for 26 years before Bowie’s death in 2016.\n\nIman said shortly before his death, \"I think the secret to a lasting marriage is timing, first of all. … You have to be at the right time in your life that you’re ready for an everlasting relationship, that it becomes first, and a priority in life.\"\n\nTom Brady and Gisele Bundchen\n\nTom Brady and Gisele Bundchen first met in 2006 at a mutual friend's house and were married three years later in 2009. The couple had two wedding ceremonies, the first in Santa Monica and the second in Costa Rica. Together, they have two children named Benjamin and Vivian, as well as Tom's son from a previous relationship, John.\n\nBundchen told Vanity Fair about her relationship with the New England Patriots quarterback, \"You know that feeling of, like, you can't get enough? From the first day we met, we've never spent one day without speaking to each other.\"\n\nMatthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker\n\nSarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick's secret to their long-lasting marriage is keeping quiet about it. The two have been happily married since 1997, but are careful not to let rumors and media coverage come between them.\n\nParker said in a 2013 interview with Harper's Bazaar, \"I love Matthew Broderick. Call me crazy, but I love him. … We can only be in the marriage we are. We're very devoted to our family and our lives. I love our life. I love that he's the father of my children, and it's because of him that there's this whole other world that I love.\"\n\nRichard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor\n\nElizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton fell in love on the set of their movie Cleopatra while both married to other people. The two were married soon after, from 1964 to 1974, before divorcing and getting married again the following year. They eventually split in 1976, but their tumultuous romance was one for the ages.\n\nBurton once wrote a letter to Taylor, saying, \"I find it equally difficult, because of my innate arrogance, to believe in the idea of love. … There is no such thing, I say to myself. There is lust, of course, and usage, and jealousy, and desire and spent powers, but no such thing as the idiocy of love.\"\n\nTaylor, in turn, wrote a letter to Burton with a similar sentiment: \"I wish I could tell you of my love for you, of my fear, my pure animal pleasure of you, my jealousy, my anger at you. … Most of all my love for you and whatever love you can dole out to me. I wish I could write about it but I can only boil and bubble inside and hope you understand how I really feel.\"\n\nTaylor once said in an interview that she didn't \"give a damn\" about most of the men she'd been with, with the exception of Burton. \"Richard is the only one I truly loved and still care about,\" she said. \"I shall miss him until the day I die.\"\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi fell hard for each other in the early aughts, and married in 2008 shortly after California lifted the same-sex marriage ban.\n\nEllen told People in 2014, \"The truth is, and this is corny, I fall more in love with Portia all the time. … It's what anyone experiences when you find that person that gets you, wants to take care of you, wants the best for you. We're really lucky because we know how rare it is.\"\n\nPortia spoke about the importance of marriage for same-sex couples in a 2013 interview with LA Confidential, saying, \"I don't think people understand how important that little ceremony is and what it actually does to people. To my mother, instead of thinking of our relationship as a little bit less than my brother and his wife's relationship in some way, it made them instantly equal in her mind, and Ellen became her daughter rather than someone that I was with or dating. It just made it more like family, and our commitment to each other just strengthened instantly.\"\n\nJohnny Depp and Kate Moss\n\nKate Moss and Johnny Depp met in 1994 at Caf Tabac in New York and shared a passionate relationship for three years. The two were rumored to be engaged when they decided to end their romance in 1997.\n\nMoss spoke about their relationship in a 2012 Vanity Fair interview, saying, \"There's nobody that's ever really been able to take care of me. Johnny did for a bit. I believed what he said. … Like if I said, 'What do I do?,' he'd tell me. And that's what I missed when I left.\"\n\nKirk Douglas and Anne Buydens\n\nKirk Douglas and Anne Buydens married in 1954, and are still going strong more than 60 years later. After their 60th anniversary, Douglas wrote in a Los Angeles Times column, \"Anne never tried to change me, but she never hesitated to speak her mind — usually gently and often with great humor and subtlety. But she did change me and very much for the better.\"\n\nThe column continued, \"A newly engaged friend asked, 'Kirk, why did your marriage last so long?' 'That's easy,' I replied. 'I just told my wife, if you ever leave me, I'm going with you!'\"\n\nRyan Gosling and Eva Mendes\n\nRyan Gosling and Eva Mendes' notoriously private romance began in 2011 when they met while filming The Place Beyond the Pines. They're currently raising two daughters together, and the La La Land actor dedicated his recent Golden Globe award for best actor in a comedy/musical to Mendes' late brother, who passed away in 2016.\n\n\"While I was singing and dancing and playing piano and having one of the best experiences I've ever had on a film, my lady was raising our daughter, pregnant with our second, and trying to help her brother fight his battle with cancer,\" Gosling said at the podium. \"If she hadn't taken all that on so that I could have this experience, it would surely be someone else up here. Sweetheart, thank you.\"\n\nHugh Grant and Elizabeth Hurley\n\nHugh Grant and Elizabeth Hurley met on the set of Rowing With the Wind in 1987 and stayed together for 13 years before parting ways in 2000. The pair has stayed close, however, and call each other best friends even though their romance has ended.\n\nHurley has said of their friendship, \"He will be my best friend for life. You can create fabulous new relationships but it will never be quite the same as that one.\"\n\nDon Gummer and Meryl Streep\n\nMeryl Streep and Don Gummer met soon after the devastating death of her previous boyfriend John Cazale, when Gummer, a friend of her brother's, came to help Streep move out of the apartment she had shared with Cazale. The two were married within the year and are together to this day.\n\nStreep once said about their relationship, \"The secret of a happy marriage is goodwill and a willingness to bend and to shut up every once in a while.\"\n\nJay Z and Beyonce\n\nBeyonce and Jay Z have been the definition of a power couple ever since they collaborated on the rapper's track \"03 Bonnie & Clyde\" in 2002. They got married in 2008, welcomed their first daughter, Blue Ivy, in 2012, and recently announced they are expecting twins in what has become the most liked Instagram post ever.\n\nBeyonce spoke about her relationship with Jay Z in a 2013 Vogue interview, saying, \"Just knowing someone's always going to be honest and tell the truth … [who] can understand exactly what I'm going through — and I can understand exactly what he’s going through.\"\n\nJude Law and Sienna Miller\n\nSparks first flew for Jude Law and Sienna Miller when they met on the set of Alfie. The two were together for a few years until Law had an affair, causing the couple to break up. After getting back together in 2009, the couple amicably called it quits again in 2011.\n\nMiller told Esquire in 2014, \"When something ends in a way like that, it's important if you can, in a way, go back and revisit it and either shut that door or create a new room. So it was a very healthy, cathartic experience. And I think it paved the way for both of us to have great futures with no animosity or drama. Such a huge relief, to heal that. And I'm great friends with him and with his children. I love them, madly. Just huge love and respect for all of them.\"\n\nJohn Lennon and Yoko Ono\n\nJohn Lennon and Yoko Ono first met in 1966 when the Beatle visited the Indica Gallery in London, where Ono was preparing her own art exhibit. The pair began dating two years later, and married in 1969. Lennon and Ono, who had a son together named Sean, remained married until Lennon's death in 1980.\n\nIn an interview for Rolling Stone in 1971, Lennon said, \"We decided that if we were going to do anything like get married that we would dedicate it to peace. And during that period, because we are what we are, it evolved that somehow we ended up being responsible to produce peace.\"\n\nTim McGraw and Faith Hill\n\nFaith Hill and Tim McGraw first met at a Nashville radio station event and didn't become an official item until 1996, when Hill was the opening act on McGraw's tour. The country stars have been married for 20 years and have three teenage daughters.\n\n\"It's always been magic from the first, the first time that we performed together onstage, which was spontaneous combustion,\" Hill once said in an interview with Larry King. \"We fell in love on that tour and sang together night after night, and it was just beautiful.\"\n\nDanny Moder and Julia Roberts\n\nJulia Roberts met cameraman Danny Moder on the set of The Mexican in 2001. They have been married for almost 15 years and have three children named Finn, Hazel, and Henry.\n\n\"I would say, never leave the house without saying goodbye to your wife, and kissing her goodbye,\" Roberts once said in an interview with E!'s Jason Kennedy while giving advice to the then-newlywed reporter. “And never come home and not find her first and say, 'I'm home, hello,' kiss and hug and then go do whatever you have to do.\"\n\nJack Nicholson and Anjelica Huston\n\nJack Nicholson and Anjelica Huston met in 1973 when she came to his house for his birthday party and spent the night, beginning a turbulent but memorable relationship. The couple stayed together through bouts of infidelity, but eventually parted ways in 1990.\n\nHuston once wrote about their relationship in Vanity Fair, \"The front door of a modest two-story ranch-style house opened, and there was that smile. Later, after he became a superstar and was on the cover of Time magazine, Diana Vreeland was to christen it 'the Killer Smile.' But at the time I thought, 'Ah! Yes. Now, there's a man you could fall for.'\"\n\nNeil Patrick Harris and David Burtka\n\nNeil Patrick Harris and David Burtka were together for 10 years and both proposed to each other once before they were finally married in 2014.\n\nHarris wrote in a column for Out magazine in 2012: \"What defines a relationship is the work that's involved to maintain it, and it's constantly changing. Sometimes I'm deeply in love with David and head-over-heels, and sometimes I question whether it's going to work out and is meant to be. It's like a business relationship, as well as a personal one; we have a business together and that’s maintaining our love for one another.\"\n\nBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie\n\nAngelina Jolie and Brad Pitt (often dubbed \"Brangelina\") first met on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith and eventually took their onscreen romance offscreen when they began dating in 2005. The two tied the knot in a sweet ceremony in France in 2014, and just two years later, Jolie filed for divorce. The couple share six children together.\n\nJolie told Elle in 2014 she never thought she would find love before meeting with Pitt. \"You get together and you're two individuals and you feel inspired by each other, you challenge each other, you complement each other, drive each other beautifully crazy,\" she said. \"After all these years, we have history — and when you have history with somebody, you're friends in such a very real, deep way that there's such a comfort, and an ease, and a deep love that comes from having been through quite a lot together.\"\n\nChris Pratt and Anna Faris\n\nAnna Faris and Chris Pratt met and fell in love on the set of Take Me Home Tonight in 2007. Although Faris was still married to Ben Indra during filming, Pratt swears he didn't make a move on the actress until she filed for divorce later that year. They were married in 2009 and have a 5-year-old son named Jack.\n\n\"Anna and I are meant to be together,\" Chris once said. \"Our relationship has made me believe in divine intervention and destiny, just as much as my crazy career and the way I fell into this life. She and I grew up 20 minutes away from each other but never met until we met in L.A.\"\n\nFreddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar\n\nFreddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar's first date was over 17 years ago, and the couple is still going strong. They met on the set of I Know What You Did Last Summer in 1997 and now are happily married with two children.\n\n\"We were fortunate enough to be at the right times in our lives where we both wanted something serious and it worked,\" Prinze said during an interview for AOL Build. \"So we're lucky, but we also work very hard at it. It's not just dumb luck, it's work.\"\n\nBurt Reynolds and Sally Field\n\nBurt Reynolds and Sally Field began dating when they met on the set of Smokey and the Bandit, and though they broke it off a few years later, Reynolds still calls Field the love of his life.\n\nHe confessed that he still misses her in a 2015 Vanity Fair interview, saying, \"There isn't anything — no matter how good it is, or how good it tastes, or how much fun it is — where too much is good for you. It can destroy you. And you have to learn. It's a hard lesson. But you have to learn to back off and do as good as you can in your chosen profession. And don't screw it up. And the best way to screw it up is having too much of a good thing.\"\n\nRyan Reynolds and Blake Lively\n\nBlake Lively and Ryan Reynolds starred opposite each other in Green Lantern in 2011, the same year Reynolds finalized his divorce from Scarlett Johansson. The co-stars coupled up soon after, and were married a year later.\n\nBlake spoke about her marriage with Marie Claire in 2016, saying, \"I knew he would always be my best friend for my whole life. That was the biggest thing to me. I'd never known anything like the friendship that I had with him. I could like him as much as I loved him.\"\n\nSeal and Heidi Klum\n\nHeidi Klum and Seal were married in 2004 and remained together for seven years, eventually ending their relationship in 2012.\n\nBefore their split, Klum told Good Housekeeping in 2011, \"Why does [our marriage] work so well? Maybe it's just because it's real. We love each other. We love our kids. We have fun with each other and in all the stages in our lives we go through together. What I wanted in a partnership is that I could still be who I am. There are many days where I don't want to put on makeup. I want to be loved just as me.\"\n\nBlake Shelton and Gwen Stefani\n\nWhen Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton met on the set of The Voice, both were struggling through a divorce — Shelton with fellow country singer Miranda Lambert and Stefani with Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale. The singers eventually went public with their relationship at the end of 2015, and a wedding is already rumored to be in the works for this year.\n\n\"I'm our biggest fan,\" Stefani told Us Weekly. \"I actually feel like I'm not in my own life, because I'm not. I'm in a different life all of a sudden.\"\n\nThe No Doubt frontwoman added, \"I'm so blessed and I feel like I believe in my path. Now there's all these miracles around me!\"\n\nWill Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith\n\nWill Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith met on the set of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in 1994, when Jada auditioned for the role of Will's onscreen girlfriend. Though she didn't get the part, the pair's romance flourished offscreen, and they married in 1997.\n\nWill Smith said in a 2015 interview with Entertainment Tonight, \"You can't expect it to be easy. It's like our marriage was the most difficult, grueling, excruciating thing that we have ever taken on in our lives. And you know we’re just not quitters.\"\n\nSonny and Cher\n\nSonny and Cher's marriage lasted less than 10 years, but it remains iconic to this day. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Cher described Sonny as someone who treated her more \"like a golden goose than like his wife.\" She went on to say, \"I forgive him, I think. He hurt me in so many ways, but there was something. He was so much more than a husband — a terrible husband, but a great mentor, a great teacher.\"\n\nAaron Taylor-Johnson and Sam Taylor-Johnson\n\nAaron Taylor-Johnson met his wife Sam when he was just 19 years old — and 23 years her junior — on the 2009 set of Nowhere Boy. Though news of their relationship first came under public scrutiny over the large age gap, the two have been married for over four years and have two daughters together.\n\nNocturnal Animals star Taylor-Johnson told The Times magazine in 2015, \"I don't engage with [talk about the age gap]. At an early age when I saw articles, it just f—ed me up. … What does it even f—ing matter about our age? I never noticed it when we fell in love with each other. … I met Sam and I knew I wanted to be with her. And it got clearer, each step. … I wanted kids, we had kids, and I was really into that, taking time off and involving myself in the bubble of her pregnancy.\"\n\nJustin Timberlake and Jessica Biel\n\nJustin Timberlake revealed at a press conference that he had to be pretty persistent to convince Jessica Biel to first go out with him — and his hard work clearly paid off. The pair started dating in 2007 and had an on-again, off-again relationship before finally getting hitched in 2012.\n\nBiel has said of her marriage to the singer, \"It's so funny, it feels like nothing's changed and yet everything's changed. It's kind of that intangible thing, you can't quite put your finger on it, but I guess the idea of having a partner in crime and I guess the word 'husband' is pretty amazing. I'm loving it!\"\n\nKeith Urban and Nicole Kidman\n\nKeith Urban and Nicole Kidman first exchanged numbers at an Australian event, G'Day LA, though Urban didn't reach out to Kidman for four months because he thought she was out of his league. Their first date was in 2005, and they were married one year later.\n\nUrban has said of their marriage, \"Someone said one time, 'If your marriage isn't your priority, you're not married,' and I thought, for me that's so true. So as long as I keep her as a priority, everything else sort of seems to work. And when I don't keep it as a priority, it's … Jenga.\"\n\nDenzel Washington and Pauletta Washington\n\nDenzel and Pauletta Washington show that the third time really is the charm — after three proposals from Denzel, the two were finally married in 1983, and they are still going strong.\n\nOn marriage, Denzel has said, \"I just think that you have to work at it — not give up on each other. It's a commitment. It's not all the honeymoon, it doesn't last forever, so you work at it. And hopefully you're good friends first, that might help!\"\n\nKanye West and Kim Kardashian West\n\nKim Kardashian and Kanye West were longtime friends before they started dating in 2012. The pair finally tied the knot with an elaborate European wedding two years later.\n\nBefore falling for the rapper, Kardashian spoke with British Cosmopolitan about her outlook on love following her split with Kris Humphries, saying, \"I think you have different soul mates throughout your life, that your soul needs different things at different times. I do believe in love. I will always believe in love, but my idea has changed from what I’ve always thought.\""
