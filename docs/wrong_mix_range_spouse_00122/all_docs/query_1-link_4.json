I didn’t plan on it being that way. It hasn’t been easy, you know,” said the actress.\n\nHer third marriage was to Edward Abel Smith, and their love story is still continuing. “I knew that I was going to spend my life with this man. I had fallen head over heels in love with this person who I just met,” Winslet said.\n\n3.

He married Patricia Arquette, Lisa Marie Presley, Alice Kim, Erika Koike, and Riko Shibata, who he is still married to.\n\nWhen it came to Presley, he said, “Oftentimes, when you have 2 people who are very strong and their personalities are rather intense. Sometimes, I mean I’ll even use the word stubborn or not willing to compromise, sometimes you can have a hard time meshing.”\n\nCage couldn’t wait to see his love, Shibata, again when they weren’t living near each other. He proposed to her on FaceTime, as he explained, “We had built this beautiful momentum, and I didn’t want it to stop. Let’s take it to the next level.”\n\n5.

He said, “I love strong, smart women, but I feel inadequate to them.”\n\nHe is also a softie at heart and admitted, “I was always trying to keep from getting hurt. Then one day, they would pack up and leave, taking something more with them than their clothes. They took my happiness.”\n\n7.
