        "text": "James Bond director Sam Mendes has said that his first 007 movie Skyfall is better than the follow-up, Spectre.\n\nOscar-winner Mendes directed 2012's Skyfall, which was Daniel Craig's third Bond outing and perhaps his most critically successful. Mendes then directed Craig's fourth Bond movie, Spectre, but that flick wasn't as successful as Skyfall.\n\nIn a new interview with The Hollywood Reporter talking about Skyfall's 10th anniversary, Mendes said himself that Spectre wasn't as successful as Skyfall.\n\nRelated: Luke Evans praises Daniel Craig for evolving James Bond past womanising\n\n\"These movies are very difficult to write. Those 10 months of downtime, that’s when the script really turned around, because we had the time to go down blind alleys and try things,\" Mendes said.\n\n\"And that time was not afforded to me when we made Spectre. And you can see the difference in the script.\"\n\nMendes continued talking about Spectre: \"I felt there was some pressure. Certainly, Barbara [Broccoli] and Michael [G. Wilson] exerted some pressure on me and Daniel to make the next one, so that makes a big difference. People saying: 'We want you to do it,' and passionately wooing me to do it, was a big thing.\"\n\nRelated: Quantum of Solace originally killed off Judi Dench's M before Skyfall\n\nSkyfall received a score of 92% on Rotten Tomatoes and went on to earn five Oscar nominations, winning two, including best song. Meanwhile, Spectre only received a 63% on Rotten Tomatoes and earned only one Oscar nomination (for best song), although it did win that one.\n\nSpectre was followed up by No Time to Die, which was Craig's last outing as Bond. The movie also killed off Craig's 007. Recently, Craig explained why he wanted Bond to die.\n\n\"One, for the franchise, was that resets start again, which [the franchise] did with me. And I was like, ‘Well, you need to reset again’. So let’s kill my character off and go find another Bond and go find another story. Start at [age] 23, start at 25, start at 30,\" Craig said.\n\n\"The other was so that I could move on. I don’t want to go back. I suppose I should be so lucky if they were to ask me back, but the fact is I need to move on from it.\""
