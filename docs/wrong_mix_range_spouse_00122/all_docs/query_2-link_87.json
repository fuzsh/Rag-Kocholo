        "text": "The MLB pro found himself both literally and figuratively playing the field again after he and RiRi called it quits in 2010. The pair dated for a year and reportedly split due to the singer’s touring schedule, and we’re fully aware that a decade later, her life has only gotten busier! Rihanna and Kemp began dating shortly after the Barbados beauty’s tumultuous split from Chris Brown, and she seemed quite happy with their relationship at its height. “I feel like I smile for real this time,” she told Marie Claire UK of Kemp in 2010. “The smiles come from inside, and it exudes in everything I do. People feel my energy is different. When I smile they can tell that it’s pure bliss and not just a cover up.”\n\nNot only did these two find love while filming 2010’s Scott Pilgrim vs. the World in Toronto, they contemplated eloping in Sin City! During a fall 2016 episode of RuPaul's podcast, What's the Tee?, Plaza casually dropped a major bombshell about her ex, saying, \"I dated [Cera] for a long time… A year and a half. We drove across the country after we shot that movie and almost got married in Vegas.\" The Parks and Recreation star also revealed that Cera was still \"very special\" to her, explaining, \"We love each other. We're still really good friends. He's just a weird little freak and we speak the same language. He's one of the funniest people I know.\"\n\nThis was a summer fling no one saw coming! Efron was spotted packing on the PDA in Sardinia, Italy, in July 2014 with the Fast & Furious actress, who’s nearly 10 years his senior. The two were seen flying into Sardinia Airport in a private jet and were later caught cuddling and kissing on a boat together. Not too long after pics of their romance surfaced, the relationship reportedly fizzled. Efron also dated Sami Miro for two years until April 2016, and we have to admit, we totally forgot about that legit relationship, too.\n\nA-Rod knows his way around a high-profile relationship! Though he’s now engaged to Jennifer Lopez, at the beginning of the decade, the former MLB pro was with Diaz for a little over a year after meeting at the 2010 Super Bowl. The Bad Teacher star reportedly even moved to Miami to be closer to her beau. Alas, they split in June 2011, just one month after the actress spoke publicly about Rodriguez for the first time to Elle U.K., confirming that their relationship was “not a secret anymore.”\n\nThey may have only made a go of it for five months in 2011, but it included romantic trips to Europe, so that seems pretty worthwhile. We’re also guessing this is one of DiCaprio’s last flings before his whole only-dating-models thing, but we know that Lively is now happily married to Ryan Reynolds, with whom she shares three daughters.\n\nIn 2017, Gossip Girl executive producer Joshua Safran gave fans some insight into both the hit teen drama and Lively's relationship with DiCaprio, telling Vanity Fair, \"We learned a lot from Blake. When I think about shooting the L.A. episodes, Blake was dating [DiCaprio] at the time, and she had this thing where she had a doll that she took photos of that she sent to Leo. Blake was way ahead of the curve. It was pre-Instagram. She was documenting her life in photographs in a way that people were not yet doing.\"\n\nIt’s easy to forget that these two weren’t just a brief item but a two-year deal that lasted until March 2011. The pair reportedly first sparked a romance together in 2009, three years after meeting on the set of their horror flick, Case 39. While neither of them was willing to directly comment on the swirling romance rumors, they couldn't help themselves when it came to gushing over one another as scene partners while promoting the film's release in late 2010. \"He’s a great actor, great actor,\" Zellweger told ET at the time. \"I just got so excited, not believing that I was going to go to work with him.\" Though they were tight-lipped about their relationship, it was very real, as Zellweger regularly spent time with Cooper’s family. Following their split, the A Star Is Born star dated Zoe Saldana. They broke up twice, with the second one occurring toward the end of 2012, but have worked together due to their roles the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise.\n\nWhen you break up with Taylor Swift in an infamous 27-second phone call and later marry Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner, it can easily make people forget about the other famous ladies you’ve dated. For Jonas, that includes Twilight alum Greene, with whom he broke up with in 2011 after a year of dating -- and five years later revealed that she was the one he lost his virginity to. He later had a 20-month relationship with Swiss graphic designer Blanda Eggenschwiler that ended in the summer of 2014.\n\nThe Olsen twins have always been mum about their personal lives, but Ashley was in a three-year relationship with the Hangover star that went kaput in 2011. They hit plenty of red carpets during their time together, though, including a glam turn at the 2009 Met Gala. Three years later, Bartha wed Lia Smith and was expecting his first child with his new ladylove.\n\nBack when she was known more for starring on reality shows than running a successful clothing line and lifestyle site, the Hills star dated the Boys actor for three years until June 2011. Conrad rarely spoke publicly about the relationship, but in a blog post a year after their split, she responded to a fan who wanted dating advice with, writing, “I was in a similar place last year. Twenty-five, newly single and helping one of my best friends plan her wedding, so I know how it can feel. It can be hard to feel like you have to start from scratch when you have invested so much time with a person, but shortly after my break up I realized something: I wasn’t losing the chance to have love -- I was getting the opportunity to do it all over again.”\n\nThey only dated for a few months in 2012, but that was the same year the former New York Jets quarterback completed his now-infamous butt fumble. According to TMZ, the Desperate Housewives alum broke up with the football player because he was “upset all the time” because of the Jets’ bad season. Look, it was a rough time for all fans of Gang Green.\n\nParis Hilton wasn’t the first famous lady that Zylka brought home to mom. Back in 2012, he and the Pretty Little Liars star dated for nine months after meeting at a New Year’s Eve party. After the split, the American Horror Story actor reportedly told someone on Twitter that Hale “decided she was too good for him,” then later apologized for his comments. \"Lucy is not only one of the most talented people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing, but also one of the most beautiful, inside and out,” he wrote in a since-deleted tweet. “Anyone who's ever watched, or had the pleasure of meeting her, knows this to be true.\"\n\nRonson is most well-known for dating Lindsay Lohan, but after they broke up, the British DJ dated Foster for nine months before parting in March 2012. According to Us Weekly, the two had different priorities, with Foster wanting to settle down and get married while Ronson was “traveling and leads a different lifestyle,” though the source added that the split “was amicable.\" Foster referenced this relationship on the Barely Famous finale in 2015, saying of then-boyfriend Jensen, “I was a lesbian for a minute, but now I’m all D. Not all D, just love his D.” The reality star has since gotten engaged to businessman Simon Tikhman, sharing details of his proposal in August 2019\n\nHe’s got a thing for older ladies! The \"Sucker\" singer dated the Neighbours alum, with whom he had a seven-year age gap, for 10 months before calling it quits in 2012. Goodrem was reportedly heartbroken over the split at the time, but there doesn’t seem to be chains over their hearts these days. Jonas, who is now happily married to Priyanka Chopra, ran into his ex at a party in L.A. in August 2017 and shared black-and-white pics from the outing alongside the caption, “Good night with good people.” The Kingdom star had previously told an Australian radio station that he had \"nothing but love\" for his ex. Much weirder? Jonas’ older brother, Joe Jonas, would later work with her on The Voice Australia in 2018.\n\nImagine how much hairspray was used while these two were dating! The king and queen of the deep-part bang were together for nine months in 2012. They met after Goulding was asked to record vocals for the producer’s song, “Summit.” During happier times, she even hoped to make an album’s worth of tunes with her beau. “I think in an ideal world we’d love to make a whole record together… but it just so happens that we’re both ridiculously busy,” she told The AP. “When it comes to music, it honestly is really professional. Honestly.” Being busy is reportedly what led to their split, as well as distance, as the “Love Me Like You Do” singer is based in England while Skrillex calls the U.S. home.\n\nThese two were such busy bees that they couldn’t make their romance work, but they gave it the ol’ college try for three years until March 2013. The former America’s Got Talent judge spoke to Redbook about her previous relationships in 2014, explaining, “Every relationship, there was nothing wrong or bad, but there was nothing right. I had one foot out because I didn’t want to get hurt. And I didn’t say what was on my mind because I didn’t want to ruffle any feathers. I needed to be perfect.” When Hough married NHL pro Brooks Laich in July 2017, Seacrest even publicly congratulated his ex on Live With Kelly and Ryan. “I know this family and they are terrific people... Happy to see you happy,” he said of his ex while holding up a newspaper clipping of her nuptials.\n\nBefore she was an awards season darling, King was unceremoniously dumped by her boyfriend of more than two years in 2013. According to Us Weekly, she was shocked when the Cosby Show star “wasn’t feeling it anymore” and asked King and her son (from a previous relationship) to leave the home they shared. “She thought this would really last for good, they were so close as a family,\" a source told the outlet at the time. The pair had known each other for years, having both been child actors in the ‘80s.\n\nThe actress and the English director met while filming Trance, but they weren’t hypnotized by love for long. Dawson made the first move, telling Access Hollywood in October 2010, “From the outside it looks like there's a lot of dissimilarities, but we actually have a lot in common. We're really similar people. He's a very kind man.” They dated for less than a year, mostly in 2012, and didn’t interact while doing press for the film in March 2013.\n\nThis was another set romance that didn’t make it for the long haul. The Mean Girls star met the English actor when they filmed 2010’s Midnight in Paris, but it wasn’t until May 2011 that McAdams confirmed the relationship to People. They broke up after two years together, with a source telling the same outlet that “different visions for the future” led to their separation.\n\nClooney and his wife, Amal, are now #CoupleGoals, but before he settled down with the human rights attorney, the Ocean’s Eleven star dated Keibler for two years through July 2013. A source close to the couple told ET that contrary to some reports, the breakup did not happen because Keibler wanted to get married and have children, adding the split was amicable and Keibler was going to be focusing on her career.\n\nThe country singers got engaged in January 2013 after just a few months of dating, but they called things off that August. They had never announced a wedding date, and this would have been the first marriage for Gilbert, who is now married to Amber Cochran. Kramer had previously been briefly married to actor Johnathon Schaech in 2011 and Michael Gambino in 2014, but has been with husband Mike Caussin since 2015. Back in 2014, the “Bottoms Up” singer only had good things to say about his ex, telling Seattle radio station 100.7, “I love her to death. I care about her... But between she and I, the situation does exist where it just didn't work. And that's the case. Some things happened and it didn't work out. But we still talk. I think the world of her. She's one of the most genuine people I know. And that's the honest to God truth. I think the world of that little girl.\"\n\nHer most famous romance was with retired Yankee Derek Jeter, but she actually dated Evans twice. After first dating in 2007, the two got back together in September 2012 for about a year. \"It didn't make sense for them to be together right now,\" an insider, who also noted that distance was an issue, told Us Weekly in October 2013. This wasn’t the only aughts relationship of Kelly’s that we forgot about -- she also had a short-lived romance with How I Met Your Mother star Josh Radnor in 2017.\n\nThe Twilight star and the American Idol alum wed in July 2011 but separated in February 2014, with their divorce officially finalized in January 2015. At the time of their split, they put out a joint statement saying, \"After much consideration, Nikki Reed and Paul McDonald are ending their marriage. They have been living separately for the past six months due to work obligations… They remain best friends and look forward to their continued journey together.\" Reed has since remarried; she and Vampire Diaries star Ian Somerhalder wed in 2015 and share a daughter, Bodhi.\n\nPost-Lamar Odom but before James Harden and Tristan Thompson, the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star took a break from dating NBA players to kick it with Montana for nearly a year in 2014. In August 2019, the “Slide Rapper” told Haute Living that the two “are always going to remain close.” \"I feel like we had a real dope relationship,\" he said. \"There was no bad blood, nobody did something to somebody that we couldn't come back from. The love was real.”\n\nEven though the Killing actor once shared that his girlfriend was “a hoot,” it was their relationship that got the last laugh. The actors dated for two years before calling it quits in April 2014, and Munn had even traveled to Sweden to meet Kinnaman’s parents during their time together. “There have been a lot of travel changes in their relationship -- their time together has been limited. They used to do everything together,” a source told People at the time.\n\nBefore Big Sean was in the picture, the pint-sized pop star said “Thank U, Next” to Brooks. The two dated started dating in August 2012, broke up in July 2013, and then got back together, but were officially done by August 2014 -- though they were spotted kissing in Los Angeles the following spring.\n\nIt may have been his sense of humor that Seyfried fell for, but no one was laughing after they called it quits on their low-key romance in 2015 after two years together. “The truth is that they actually split up around two months ago and never lived together,” a source told People in September 2015. “They both tried very hard to make it work because they each wanted to eventually have a family but ultimately they weren’t compatible and decided to split up. They are still on good terms and friends.” Two years later, the Mamma Mia! star later eloped with her Last Word co-star, Thomas Sadoski, and they welcomed a daughter, Nina, later that year.\n\nBack when the Aussie singer was mostly on the tween dream radar and PDA-filled pics of him and Miley Cyrus were far from something we could have imagined, Simpson and Hadid were a blonde dream team. They dated for a year before first splitting in May 2014, but got back together shortly after before calling it quits a second time in May 2015. A couple of months later, Simpson revealed that the high-profile relationship had taken a toll on him. “I love my ex-girlfriend, I always will,” he told DuJour. “It was an amicable, mutual decision, and we still talk every now and then, but the highly publicized thing made me uncomfortable. Going out to dinner and there being all this paparazzi and stuff... as soon as we split I had the realization that I was straying away from who I was as a whole person. I want to keep it low key, and focus on my music.” Little did he know what was to come in 2019…\n\nEngagement rumors had been swirling around these two, but alas, ET confirmed that the pair parted ways in June 2015 after eight months together. The “Womanizer” singer told People in March of that year that she was \"the happiest [she's] ever been,\" and that Ebersol got along well with her sons, Jayden and Sean. These days, it’s Sam Asghari who’s bonding with Brit and her boys.\n\nDoes she have a thing for ‘80s singers and he one for blondes? The supermodel and the “Jack and Diane” crooner made it just shy of one year, saying sayonara in August 2016. \"Both the mileage between their homes and their heavy career demands interfered with their ability to maintain the relationship,\" a rep for both told ET at the time. \"They vowed to remain best of friends.\" In November 2015, Brinkley -- who had been through four divorces, including a bitter 2008 split from architect Peter Cook -- was understandably wary of the question of marriage to Mellencamp. \"I'm leery of discussing my relationship because I don't want to jinx it,\" she admitted. \"And I feel like I was so dragged through the press that I [don't want that again].” Well, technically, this didn’t jinx it...\n\nThe pair was dating for a little more than three months before breaking up in March 2016. The Jackass star initially shared news of their romance via Instagram in late December 2015, posting a cute pic of the two captioned, \"I know it's crazy that I became a clean and sober, hybrid-driving, animal-rescuing vegan who's super into meditating, but I'm glad I did. I'm even happier that I get to spend so much time with a shockingly gorgeous and amazingly talented woman who is all of those things.\" Both later deleted all of the pictures they took together from their various social media platforms.\n\nThese two were one of the most notorious reality star couples during their incredibly on-and-off relationship that started while filming Famously Single in 2016 and officially came to an end in July 2017, and yet we basically forgot that it happened by the fall. Pauly D did not, telling Page Six in September 2018 that he had “dodged a bullet” and that his Jersey Shore fam was “so happy that I’m not in that relationship anymore and so am I.”\n\nAfter nearly a year together, the actress and the DWTS pro split in spring 2017, and with it our memory that they ever dated. A source close to Chigvintsev told ET in May of that year that the reason for the breakup was \"nothing dramatic.\" \"Torrey broke up with him about a month or two ago, and Artem is pretty bummed about it,\" the source said. \"Torrey was over the relationship and the distance was a lot for them to handle. She has been in Chicago filming Chicago Med while Artem is in Los Angeles for Dancing. Distance was a main factor.\"\n\nAt this point, the drama between the Jersey Shore Family Vacation star and his baby mama, Jen Harley, has even managed to overshadow his long-term, on-and-off relationship with former MTV co-star Sammi \"Sweetheart\" Giancola. But in between the two tumultuous situations, Ortiz-Magro briefly dated Khloe Kardashian’s BFF. The two met filming the second season of E!'s Famously Single. \"We had a lot in common from the start and it was an instant friendship. The attraction quickly became a mutual romance,\" the couple said in a joint statement to ET in December 2016. \"Our support for one another through this challenging experience made us strong in a very short period of time. We had an opportunity to really get to know each other living in such close quarters.\" But the two were over by February 2017, and the reality star began dating Harley later that year.\n\nThis relationship was so brief and private that despite both being recognizable names, they barely made a blip on the celeb dating radar. The two broke up to little fanfare in December 2018 after a few months of dating. Rumors first swirled that the two were dating when they were spotted together in February of that year."
