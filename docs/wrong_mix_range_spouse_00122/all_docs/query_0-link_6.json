        "text": "Directing any sex scene, Sam Mendes says, is 'a profoundly weird experience', but when the sex scene is between Leonardo DiCaprio and your own wife, it's 'almost impossible' for them to do it if you're in the same room. So for the relevant parts of Revolutionary Road, his first collaboration with Kate Winslet, and the first film Winslet and DiCaprio have made together since Titanic, Mendes moved the monitor screens into another room, and watched from there. The actors would hear him shout from around the corner:\n\n'Leo, don't bang her head so hard against the kitchen cabinets!' And: 'Could you not do it for so long this time?' DiCaprio wanted specifics. 'Like how long?'\n\n'About 45 seconds.'\n\nA meaningful smile from DiCaprio: 'Really? Only 45 seconds?'\n\nMendes laughs as he retells the story. 'I chose to ignore the obvious inference. I said: What's wrong with 45 seconds? That's a long time. Anyone would be lucky...'\n\nI meet Mendes in his office in Manhattan's Meatpacking District. He's been spending the evenings here after simultaneously rehearsing The Cherry Orchard (in a new translation by Tom Stoppard) and The Winter's Tale all day in Brooklyn. The two plays, which star a combination of British and American actors including Simon Russell Beale, Sinéad Cusack, Rebecca Hall and Ethan Hawke , will christen his ambitious Bridge Project, opening in New York in January and at the Old Vic in May. In the back of his office he has an edit suite, where Sarah Flack, the young and eminent editor of his next film, Away We Go, is holed up, waiting for him to emerge from our interview. The room we're in has white bookshelves from the floor to its very high ceiling, generous dark grey sofas and a flat-screen TV. Antique metal letters, culled from an abandoned theatre, have been placed along one wall to spell 'Art' and 'Commerce', the words interlocking, as if their meanings were made to fit.\n\nOnce the boy wonder of British theatre, now the unassuming mini-mogul of a theatrical and motion-picture empire, Mendes, who has lived here for the past five years, is one of the busiest men in New York. Revolutionary Road – which last week was nominated for four Golden Globe awards (for Best Director, Best Actress, Best Actor and Best Motion Picture) – opens in the US on Boxing Day; Away We Go, which was scripted by Dave Eggers and his wife, Vendela Vida, is already being shown to test audiences; the Bridge plays are nearing the end of their rehearsal period; he produced the musical version of Shrek, which has just opened on Broadway; he recently bought the option to Joseph O'Neill's novel Netherland; and – just so you can try to imagine the coordinates of his home life – his wife is in not one but two likely-to-be-Oscar-nominated films at once (one of them his own).\n\nYet Mendes considers this a rather light work schedule. 'I spent 20 years looking for every available opportunity to work, and now… I don't,' he laughs as he dunks a long herbal tea bag into his mug. He and Winslet have a five-year old son, Joe, and Mia, an eight-year-old daughter from Winslet's first marriage. 'Really, spending time with the kids is the defining… You know how it is, I just don't want to go away.'\n\nFor the first four years of his son's life, he only worked on one thing: the Broadway premiere of David Hare's play The Vertical Hour – 'and that was just down the road, with friends'. Now that Joe's at school, he says, 'it's easier to work again', and although Revolutionary Road, in its subject matter, is a relentlessly dark portrait of a marriage, it was also, in its making, a family affair. Winslet first gave him Richard Yates's now cult book – 'an act of faith in itself, given what it's about' – and she and DiCaprio, who have been good friends for a third of their lives, understood each other so well it meant, from Mendes's point of view, that 'a huge amount of rehearsal time was saved'.\n\nYates's beautifully formed book is astute about the postwar era in a way that suggests far greater hindsight (it was published in 1961). Mendes saw, though, that despite this backdrop, the story was centrally about the relationship between Frank and April Wheeler, two people pinned to their time but not unique to it, a couple looking to preserve, or at least identify, some kind of truth in a landscape of heart-breaking conformity. He made a film that was literally faithful to the book, went off to shoot Away We Go – a comic road movie about a diametrically opposed, happy couple – came back and knew that something was missing from Revolutionary Road: 'The longing,' as he puts it, 'the ache.' He sat down and recut it entirely.\n\nWhat becomes of a wunderkind once he hits his forties is a question not everyone could answer with optimism. Mendes was artistic director of a new theatre – the Minerva in Chichester – only a couple of years out of Cambridge; he directed Judi Dench in the West End when he was 24; he founded and ran the Donmar Warehouse for 10 years; and his first film, American Beauty, won five Academy Awards. No small promise to live up to – and in fact, as Mendes tells me in the course of this first meeting, the pressure was so great that when he saw he really might win the Oscar for Best Director 'it felt like the guillotine was poised above my neck'. Yet Mendes has hit a new stride: avowedly changed by fatherhood, he is coming back to the London stage for the first time in years with two powerful plays about dead sons – he has not revisited The Cherry Orchard since his 1989 production with Dench, and only now feels he's beginning to understand it – and he's returning to cinema with a film he calls both his least showy and one of his most personal. In the words of his friend Richard Eyre: 'What was a precocious confidence has become more earned.'\n\nMendes's look and manner might be described as shaggy-chic: a regular uniform of jeans and navy blue jumper, outgrown silvery hair, a scruffy beard several shades darker and still, as Tom Stoppard puts it, 'an enviable way of seeming permanently young'. He gives big bear hugs and warm belly laughs. His ease and self-confidence are legendary. Judi Dench once recalled that she'd told him during Cherry Orchard rehearsals that she'd like to try something, and that the 24-year-old upstart had replied: 'Well, you can try that, but it won't work.' Kevin Spacey, who starred in American Beauty and is now, as artistic director of the Old Vic, one of the masterminds behind the Bridge Project, tells me that Mendes left him similarly stunned.\n\n'The very first day of shooting American Beauty we shot the fast food restaurant sequences,' Spacey remembers when I speak to him on the phone. 'And two days later I walked up to Sam and said: \"So, have you seen the dailies?\" He said yes. I said : \"How are they?\" and he said: 'They're shit.\" And I sort of laughed, and he said: \"No, no, they're shit. They're fucking awful.\" I said: \"What's wrong with them?\" He said: \"Well… I hate the way you're acting, I hate the costume, I hate the location, they couldn't control the light, Peter [Gallagher] and Annette [Bening] should not be walking in, they should be in a drive-thru, and… I like the dialogue. The script is really good. But everything else is wrong, and Connie [director of photography Conrad Hall] feels exactly the same way and we've gone to the studio and we've asked them if we can reshoot the first day.\" I looked at Sam and I said: \"Are you kidding me? This is your first movie, and you're telling the studio you blew the first day?\" He said:\"Yeah. Yeah, I can't live with this.\" And lo and behold the studio agreed, and we reshot the sequence three weeks later and that's the sequence that's in the film.'\n\nWhere, I ask Mendes, does that confidence come from?\n\n'That's a good question,' he replies, 'and I can't actually fully answer it. But I always had it. I'm more fearful now than I was when I was younger. Having kids makes you fearful – I don't know what it is, but it increases your level of vulnerability about a thousand per cent. It just does – you feel worried about your own death, their death, your parents' death… it's not my imagination.'\n\nMendes was born 43 years ago – in the same small Reading hospital where Kate Winslet was born 10 years later. His life was not exactly charmed, but it was self- sufficient. His Portuguese-Trinidadian father and his British Jewish mother divorced when he was three, and Mendes, an only child, grew up near Oxford with his mum, a publisher and now the author of several novels for young adults. It is from her, he says, that he inherited his work ethic.\n\n'I never went to the theatre,' Mendes says, 'we didn't have a lot of money, and theatre wasn't really on the cards until I was about t o study Shakespeare, and then my mum and dad both took me to Stratford.' Instead, his father, who taught English literature at Manchester, would occasionally take his son to the cinema. 'He used to take me to see Woody Allen movies,' Mendes recalls with a smile. 'I remember him trying to get me into Manhattan, which was a double A – 16 and above. And because I was quite small, my dad was always trying to pass me off as a 12-year-old so he could pay half-price. So it's 16 and over and he says: \"One-and-a-half, please,\" and they say, \"Well, you can't have a half, it's a double A.\" And I have to whisper: \"But Dad! I am 16!\"'\n\nHis real film and theatre education came, Mendes says, when he went to Cambridge – by his account something of a surprise in itself. 'I was much more sport-oriented at school, and I wasn't very academic. I came through in my last year at school and got into Cambridge.' Then he adds, philosophically: 'It was the case for me in my twenties, and into my thirties, that I sort of pulled things out of my arse at the very last moment.'\n\nWhen he put on a student production of David Halliwell's play, Little Malcolm and his Struggle Against the Eunuchs, Mendes realised that theatre direction was, as he puts it, 'a combination of lots of different things that I liked: the society of other people, the visual aspect of it – I had originally got into Cambridge to study history of art, and I'd worked in my year off at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice – and weird elements of sports psychology and teamwork.'\n\nHe came to think that former England cricket captain Mike Brearley's book The Art of Captaincy, first published in 1985, had an effect on his choice of career. Mendes was, and apparently still is, an excellent cricketer, and Brearley had compared captaincy to theatre direction on more than one occasion. In Richard Eyre's opinion, some of Mendes's self confidence can be traced both to his isolated childhood – 'being responsible at an early age' – and to 'having authority in a different field. He's always been good at sport – rather rare in our world'. When he left university Mendes was hired at the Chichester Festival Theatre because its director had been informed of his sporting abilities and was sick of losing their annual cricket match to the RSC.\n\n'Here's the thing,' Mendes reflects now, with unprompted honesty, 'I don't think really knew what I was doing for at least 10 years of my career. You know, I think I was just flying by the seat of my pants. I'm very articulate, and I'm able to make things work, by which I mean, make sure the stage picture looks good, the lighting looks good, the music is good, people don't bump into the furniture… you know, you get your money's worth. But that's not the same as having a reason to direct a play. Early on I did O'Casey and Jean-Paul Sartre – I had no right to do those things, I didn't like them very much. But I did them anyway because I thought it would be a good idea at the time. And it took me a while to admit to myself that that wasn't enough, and that I needed to fi nd other reasons to do plays than simply: they might be successful.'\n\nIt's rather touching that Mendes should volunteer this information; it means that, as someone who has always been good at what he does, he understands the risks of competence. Because his style is subtle, and because even his least successful work is well-crafted, it's an important distinction to make. In the theatre, Mendes's work is characterised by a quickness and a clarity and a peerless respect for words – in Stoppard's description, 'always interesting but never crazy'. None of this translates as swagger.\n\nAs for his films, other than their visual grace and their unerringly excellent performances, there's little to link Mendes's four movies – American Beauty, an intermittently surreal take on American suburbia; the sleek Paul Newman gangster film Road to Perdition; Jarhead, which revolves around the idea of wasted troops in a desert war; and Revolutionary Road, a work of virtuosic midcentury intimacy. They are mainstream studio movies (Mendes's company, Neal Street Productions, retains a first-look deal with Dreamworks), with major box-offi ce stars, made by a British theatre director who eschews Hollywood endings and always has fi nal cut. It's an unusual combination: auteurish licence without an auteur's signature – though Dave Eggers suggests that they are all so uncompromising that 'without the big stars, they're very art house-y, in a way'.\n\nWhile many of the directors who've influenced him have had a definite style – Lynch, Kubrick, Polanski, for instance – Mendes purposely aims for the kind of career that challenges him in new directions all the time. 'I don't want to be known for one thing,' he explains. 'I don't want to have an adjective based around my name. 'Lynchian', I know what that is, I know what 'Kubrickian' is, and I know what 'Bergmanesque' means. But there isn't going to be – and I don't want there to be – a 'Mendesian'.\n\nThree weeks after our first meeting, I join Mendes at the Museum of Modern Art, where Revolutionary Road has just been screened, and several cast members are due to speak at a Q&A session afterwards. He is casually hanging around in the foyer with the film's screenwriter, Justin Haythe . We amble through to the auditorium. Only when everyone is seated and the rest of the cast introduced by the moderator do Winslet and DiCaprio make their starrily timed entrances.\n\nI had asked Mendes what he'd discovered about Winslet when they worked together, and he said: 'Quite a lot, really – a surprising amount for somebody I know very, very well. You watch this face that you think you know and expressions pass across it that you've never seen. It's very… exciting.'\n\nTheir approach to their work is so different that Mendes had to shift gears in order to match her. 'I tend to be very focused when I'm working, then I switch off completely. And Kate, when she comes home from work, wants to talk. She wants to tell me about the scene and ask my advice about the following day's scene, and I kind of like that because it gives me a way into her world when she's working.' But now that they were working together, 'I'd want to watch Sky Sports news, and she'd say: \"What are you doing?\" So I thought: \"This is my job, I can't switch off , my job is 24 hours a day.\" In that respect there was a level of sacrifi ce about this,' he laughs. 'I didn't get to see my cricket highlights.'\n\nAt MoMA, Mendes gets a lot of gyp for putting Winslet 'through the wringer' – for casting her in a role of such harshness and difficulty. He says in beguilingly throwaway self-defence that giving a great actress one of the roles of a lifetime does not in his view constitute torture. Winslet says that they're often asked about the sex scenes, but the more difficult parts were when she and DiCaprio had to perform one of Frank and April Wheeler's violent arguments. 'I could just see Sam wanting to come up and give me a little hug,' Winslet smiles, 'and I'd have to go: \"No!\"' Sometimes, she says, when they'd finish for the day, he'd turn to her – the person who had been his wife and not his wife – and say: 'Ah! Are you back now?'\n\nMendes met Winslet in 2001, when he had her in mind for parts in his simultaneous productions of Uncle Vanya and Twelfth Night. Winslet had no interest in the job – her daughter was a baby, and the theatre project required a commitment of a year. But, as she has said on a number of occasions, 'When your agent calls and says Sam Mendes wants to have lunch, you say OK.' (She told this story a few weeks ago at a stage event organised by the New York Times, and Mendes quipped: 'She doesn't say OK any more.') Richard Eyre, who had just directed Winslet in Iris and had overseen several of Mendes's productions at the National Theatre, claims to have 'played Cupid' . 'They both separately asked me my opinion of the other. They were both slightly bashful about it' – perhaps because it came so soon after Winslet's separation from Mia's father, Jim Threapleton, a shift that caused something of a media stir at the time. Since then, Eyre says, 'Kate's been very, very good for Sam – giving him stability and children. He's become less insulated, more gregarious.'\n\nAfter the Q&A, Mendes asks me to meet him during his lunch break at the Cherry Orchard rehearsal the next day. 'Then you can see the actors wandering in and out,' he says. 'Like in a wildlife park. I remember when we were rehearsing at the Other Place in Stratford, these open-topped tour buses would come past. We'd be standing outside having coff ee and we'd hear the tour guide say: \"And those people you can see down there are actors.\"' He laughs. 'Don't feed the actors!'\n\nMendes has never been a 'genius' in the traditional neurotic mould; he's much more like a charismatic magician with a seemingly bottomless bag of very elegant tricks. This in itself can be nerve- racking. Mendes tells me about his very first moment in motion pictures. There he was, with a budget of $15m , several highprofile stars and a veteran cinematographer, yet he had to approach Conrad Hall before the fi rst day of shooting American Beauty and say: 'I know this sounds really stupid, but when do I say \"Action\"?'\n\nHall explained; the moment arrived; Mendes said it. Instantly, he drifted off into a reverie of boyish excitement. 'I'm thinking: \"Oh my God, I just said 'Action'! That's amazing! I'm in Los Angeles, California and I actually said 'Action'!\" And the whole crew is standing there looking at me and I say, \"What?\" I'd forgotten to say \"Cut\".'\n\nBefore the Oscar ceremony that year, someone from the BBC said to Mendes: 'You are aware that it would be a big disappointment if it didn't win?' Mendes thought: 'How is it possible that not winning the Academy Award for my first movie would be considered a disappointment?' But then, as he would put it, he pulled the Oscar out of his arse. He says he's never spoken before about how isolated winning it made him feel. 'It's a huge gift. I mean, it would be churlish of me to say it's not: I was handed a career in movies, really. The difficulty is that you have to not change the way you see yourself, and I'll be honest: it threw me. I became a bit more suspicious of the way people treated me – I didn't know what their motives were always. So I retreated a bit. I didn't have a girlfriend at the time. It was weirdly… lonely.'\n\nNow that his life is no longer about the whizz-kiddish things hecan pull out of anywhere, it's possibleto see that he has a solid set of less spectacular and arguably more impressive gifts. Behind the scenes, Mendes bridges generations and worlds without difficulty: the UK and the US, theatre and film, writers and actors, art and commerce, studio executives and everyone else. He protects people fiercely. Eggers and Vida were amazed that when Mendes promised that they wouldn't have to rewrite anything they didn't want to rewrite, they really didn't. Tom Stoppard is impressed that Mendes's attention to detail in the text is 'on the scale of syllables'.\n\nActors trust him implicitly. Speaking about theatre, he'll say that it's not a director's medium and that he doesn't want to get between the actors and the writing. About film, he'll tell you he doesn't want the direction to get in the way of the actors' relationship with the audience. He erases himself, while in the background he's willing, as he puts it, to 'soak up the shit'.\n\n'There's a political side to it,' Mendes explains, 'and I'm lucky that I'm very thick-skinned, and very tenacious. I don't mind the dance that you have to do in order to get something made – the hoops you have to jump through, the fake smiles you have to adopt. You just have to. No one is entitled to anything: you have to earn it.' One of his predominant talents, in other words, lies in making it seem as though things have happened by osmosis, when really they have happened because of him.\n\nI turn up at the stage door of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Mendes arrives, jovial as ever, and gives me a hug. He shows me the place where they're rehearsing: the actors are milling about a large daylit room covered in randomly overlapping Persian rugs. It looks as though he expects the performers to fall on the floor at any moment, but he says this is a habit of his – the rugs just make people feel more comfortable. Here and there, bits of coloured masking tape mark out certain boundaries, but they rehearse in the centre of the room, without any sense of where the audience might be, so that they're not always thinking about being watched. It's a very graphic representation of the protected environment Mendes offers.\n\n'His rehearsals,' Tom Stoppard says of these latest sessions, 'are very quiet, and very exploratory, and nobody, presumably including Sam, knew where the furniture might be for what seemed like weeks. Whereas nine times out of 10, on your first day of rehearsal you're shown a model of the set. With Sam, there was no model because there was no set – which I found slightly alarming, slightly breathtaking, but fundamentally brave and admirable.'\n\nMendes is good at rewriting such rules. When preparing Revolutionary Road, the cast rehearsed for three-and- a-half weeks, and shot everything in sequence and on location, so that by the end Winslet and DiCaprio were genuinely stifled by the small, claustrophobic house in which they were shooting. 'I've never done so much off -camera work in my life,' DiCaprio said at MoMA of Mendes's theatre ensemble method. 'At the beginning, Leo looked like a movie star,' Mendes tells me, 'and by the end he looked like Gollum. I remember saying: \"That's it, Leo. It's a wrap.\" And he just burst into tears.'\n\nMendes's theatre workshop method had taken so much out of DiCaprio that he had to postpone his next film another two months. Yet later he declared that he'd 'love to do more work like that'.\n\nKevin Spacey says that 'one of the things I've always admired about Sam is that the kind of direction he gives is really accessible for an actor to understand. Also, he knows when to give you a note. There are some directors who talk too much, or give you a note way before you're ready to hear it. He has the skill to observe where you are, and what you need, at a very specific moment.'\n\nVendela Vida tells me that watching him on set was 'amazing, because he has a way of pulling things out of his actors – it's like watching a doctor. Someone's on the operating table, all their organs are out, and he's putting it all back together, helping them see how it all fits, without any breakdowns or drama or tears.'\n\nMendes takes me downstairs to a dressing room so that we can continue our conversation. He bends back over his chair, his spine cricking audibly as he stretches after a good morning's rehearsal, and has mushroom soup delivered for lunch.\n\nHe is so affable, and so articulate, that as an interview subject he can be a little disconcerting: where, you wonder, is the friction, the grit, the mystery? Eventually I become so exasperated with this search that I present the problem to him outright.\n\nHe laughs, of course. 'I have many, many flaws, believe me,' he says, sidling up to a slightly different point. 'I obviously won't list them for you, but if you want to talk to my wife…' (As it happens, his wife declines to elaborate.)\n\nI put the question another way: What's the biggest risk you've ever taken?\n\nWithout missing a beat, he says: 'Getting married. And having children. But professional risk? Oh, doing my first film was a massive risk. Running a theatre was a massive risk. Retrospectively, it all seems to have been a piece of piss – people forget. I took on a theatre, I could have fallen fl at on my arse. I directed in the West End when I was young, I could have fallen fl at on my arse. I directed a movie, I could have fallen fl at on my arse. You know, I've worked fucking hard.'\n\nMendes is governed not by straightforward ease or entitlement, but by the sleight of hand that masks his own determination. As a wrap present for Revolutionary Road, Haythe gave him a signed photo of Björn Borg, because Mendes had told him early on in the proceedings: 'If you're going to direct a film, you'd better make bloody sure you're channelling Björn Borg and not John McEnroe.' Mendes has no recollection of having said this, but he loves the photo, and has it on the bookshelf in his office. It's of Borg on his knees in jubilation – proof that channelling him can mean more things than mere unswerving calm.\n\nAs he leaves to go back into the rehearsal room, Mendes tells me a story about his son. Joe's schoolteacher took him aside the other day, he says, because she wanted to tell him about a conversation she'd overheard between Joe and his best friend, Nicholas. They were standing in the hallway, looking at the trophy cabinet.\n\n'My dad's got one of those,' Joe said, 'it's called an Oscar.'\n\n'What's it for?' asked Nicholas, adding hopefully: 'Soccer?'\n\n'No,' replied Joe, 'it's for farting and burping.'\n\nNicholas nodded. 'Cool,' he said.\n\nMendes laughs proudly. Then he looks briefly worried. 'I don't know when I'm going to break the news to him that it's for a stupid old movie.'\n\nRevolutionary Road opens on 30 January. The Cherry Orchard and The Winter's Tale run in rep from 23 May to 15 August at the Old Vic, London SE1. oldvictheatre.com\n\nMendes's Famous Five\n\nThe Cherry Orchard- 1989\n\nStaged at the Aldwych when Mendes was all of 24, this production played up the comic aspect of Chekhov's play, and was described by Michael Billington in the Guardian as 'light, bright, fast and ironic', the work of 'an accomplished young director'. Judi Dench's portrayal of Ranevskaya drew special praise all round, yet despite its success Mendes now says that only when it ended did he realise 'what an extraordinary play it was, and I sort of felt I was ready to start'. He is revisiting the play now, exactly 20 years later; Mendes's new production will open at the Old Vic in May.\n\nThe Blue Room- 1998\n\nA turning point in Mendes's peerless understanding of the marriage of art and commerce, The Blue Room brought huge crowds to his Donmar Warehouse with the tantalising promise of a near-naked Nicole Kidman. It was, said Susannah Clapp in this paper, 'difficult to see Kidman through the drool that has greeted her appearance' yet her performance, and that of Iain Glen, garnered rave reviews. A free adaptation by David Hare of Arthur Schnitzler's 1897 play La Ronde, Mendes's elegant and witty production was memorably described by the Telegraph's Charles Spencer as ' theatrical Viagra'.\n\nAmerican Beauty- 1999\n\nMendes's spectacularly assured cinematic debut was instantly deemed a 'classic' by Steven Spielberg, and was nominated for eight Academy Awards (it won five). Narrated by a dead man , the film stars Kevin Spacey (with Mena Suvari) as a suburban father undergoing a high octane mid-life crisis, and Annette Bening as his compulsive and distant wife. A biting film with a sleekly noir-ish end, some of its features – such as the floating rose petals of Spacey's imagination and the windchoreographed plastic bag – lost no time in entering the film canon. Made for $15 , the film grossed well over $350m worldwide.\n\nJarhead- 2005\n\nBased on the memoir of former US Marine Anthony Swofford, Jarhead is perhaps Mendes's most risky film. Having followed American Beauty with an all-star gangster movie (Road to Perdition), Mendes turned to the bleak, catharsis-free tale of a group of Marines sent to fight in the first Gulf War. Released two years into the current Gulf war, Jarhead wore its political implications visibly yet lightly. Jake Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard give beautifully nuanced performances as Marines who never get to see action, and the emptiness of their expectant lives turns the film into the exploration of an idea."
