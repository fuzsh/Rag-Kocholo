        "text": "The very best moment of any party is when the band plays a song you love just at the right time, lifts the energy of the room to a perfect pinnacle, and gives you that “this is AMAZING” feeling. For over 20 years, Nightsong has dazzled audiences with incredible moments just like that, earning a reputation as a top band in the region with joyful reviews from clients and event planners alike. Nightsong generates captivating energy on stage from the dynamic chemistry of three talented vocalists combined with so many world-class musicians. Founder and guitarist Bennett Scher’s experience started in New York as a singer-songwriter, publisher and as both a studio and touring musician performing with notable musicians from the bands of Billy Joel, Peter Frampton, Joe Cocker, David Bowie, Whitney Houston, The Doobie Brothers, Bette Midler, and Poco. Over the years, Bennett assembled Nightsong’s lineup to include talented singers and musicians who are equally as accomplished. In addition to wowing audiences at hundreds of private events throughout the years, they have collectively honed their craft by performing live on the stage and screen around the globe, as well as in recording studios all over the country. Nightsong most commonly performs as a 9 piece band consisting of a strong frontline of three captivating lead vocalists (2 female, 1 male), a four-piece rhythm unit full of funk that includes guitar, keyboards, bass, and drums, as well as a soulful two-piece horn section (sax and trumpet). The band maintains ultimate flexibility and can scale down for smaller events as a seven-piece without horns, or add a third horn (trombone) and play as a ten-piece lineup for larger-scale events. In any configuration, Nightsong provides a versatile music variety ranging from current hits of today to yesterday’s classics, delivering with seamless musical transitions and charming crowd engagement, all of which results in a power-packed display of showmanship to excite guests younger and older. Experts at reading the energy of the audience and the overall vibe of the night, the entire band brings the experience to adapt any performance to the unique flow of any event. Talent, energy, personality and professionalism with an awesome commitment to the authentic sound of the music is the reason Nightsong continues to be one of the area’s most popular variety bands. Nightsong has been recognized as a “Best Wedding Vendor” by Washingtonian Magazine in the DC area, and their clients have exclaimed: “They exceeded our expectations…” “All we kept hearing from everyone the whole night is … ‘this band is great!’” “Everyone has been contacting us asking the name of the band …” “We could have closed our eyes and felt that the original artists were there!” “Nightsong was AMAZING!”"
