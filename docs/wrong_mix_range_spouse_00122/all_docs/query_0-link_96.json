        "text": "1. Elizabeth Taylor – eight weddings\n\nTaylor was married to seven men: Conrad Hilton Jr., Michael Wilding, Mike Todd, Eddie Fisher, Richard Burton from 1964 to 1974 and then again from 1975 to 1976, John Warner and, lastly, Larry Fortensky.\n\n2. Jennifer Lopez – four weddings\n\nLopez’s first husband was Ojani Noa, a waiter, whom she was married to from 1997 to 1998. After that, she wed dancer Cris Judd, which lasted from 2001 to 2003.\n\nFamously, she was then engaged to Ben Affleck, though the two never made it down the aisle and split in early 2004. She married Marc Anthony that year, and the two musicians were married until 2014.\n\nLopez was then engaged once again, this time to Alex Rodriguez. They split in April 2021. And now, famously, we are living in the time of Bennifer 2.0, with Lopez and Affleck tying the knot in July in Las Vegas, almost 20 years after Affleck first proposed in November 2002.\n\n“We did it. Love is beautiful. Love is kind. And it turns out love is patient. Twenty years patient,” Lopez wrote in her newsletter.\n\n3. Kim Kardashian – three weddings\n\nKardashian’s first husband was Damon Thomas, whom she married when she was 19 years old in 2000. They divorced in 2004.\n\nIn May 2012, she told British Cosmopolitan, “I think you have different soul mates throughout your life … I just don’t believe in one soulmate now.”\n\n4. Scarlett Johansson – three weddings\n\nThe Black Widow star was married to Ryan Reynolds from 2008 to 2011. She then wed French journalist Romain Dauriac in 2014, before they split for good in 2017. They share a daughter together, Rose.\n\nJohansson then began dating SNL star Colin Jost in May 2017, and they wed in October 2020. They welcomed a son, Cosmo, in 2021.\n\nThe 38-year-old Marriage Story actress spoke about her similarities with her character in the film – she was nominated for an Oscar for her performance as an actress going through a divorce.\n\n“I had some kind of shared experience with the character, or with any person going through a divorce, really,” Johansson told Vanity Fair in November 2019.\n\n5. Angelina Jolie – three weddings\n\nThen, in a legendary move, she married Billy Bob Thornton (and also tattooed his name on her arm and wore his blood in a vial around her neck) in 2000. They were over by 2003.\n\nThe 47-year-old Eternals star then began dating Brad Pitt in 2005, though they didn’t tie the knot until 2014. They legally split in 2019.\n\nJolie’s second ex, Thornton, is on his sixth marriage.\n\n6. Eva Longoria – three weddings\n\nLongoria was first married to fellow soap star Tyler Christopher from 2002 to 2004, right around the time she blew up from Desperate Housewives. Longoria then wed former NBA player Tony Parker in 2007 – their marriage ended in 2011 amid in a cheating scandal between Parker and numerous women.\n\nLongoria married her current husband, José Bastón, in 2016. She gave birth to their son, Santiago, in 2018.\n\n“I’m not a fan of marriage; I like being married to him,” Longoria, now 47, told People in May 2017. “I never thought I would get married again. It’s him, he makes it all worth it.”\n\n7. Janet Jackson – three weddings\n\nJackson’s first marriage to fellow singer James DeBarge was annulled in 1985 after a year of marriage. She was only 18 years old when they were wed.\n\nThe “Rhythm Nation” singer then married René Elizondo Jr. in 1991 – though the public didn’t find out until their divorce was announced in 2000.\n\nIn 2002, she began dating Jermaine Dupri, but they split in 2009 without ever getting married. Jackson, now 56, then began seeing Wissam Al Mana, and the two tied the knot in 2012. They split in 2017.\n\n8. Kate Winslet – three weddings\n\nWinslet’s first husband was director Jim Threapleton. The two were married from 1998 to 2001.\n\nShe then married 1917 director Sam Mendes in 2003. The end of their relationship was plagued with speculation regarding Mendes’ relationship with actress Rebecca Hall – he did end up dating Hall in 2011, but he denied cheating on his wife – and the two split in 2010. Winslet never shared details.\n\n“No one really knows what has happened in my life,” she told the WSJ magazine in 2015. “No one really knows why my first marriage didn’t last; no one knows why my second didn’t. And I’m proud of those silences.”\n\n9. Tom Cruise – three weddings\n\nCruise’s second two marriages are two of the most well-known celebrity relationships of all time – the now 60-year-old was married to Nicole Kidman from 1990 to 2001 and the two co-starred in multiple films together, most famously Eyes Wide Shut.\n\nHis third marriage to Katie Holmes, dubbed “TomKat” by the media, will go down in history. Their marriage lasted from 2006 to 2012.\n\nBut Cruise’s first marriage was to actress Mimi Rogers from 1987 to 1990.\n\n10. Nicolas Cage – five weddings\n\nHe married and divorced Erika Koike in 2019 – Cage filed for annulment only four days after the March wedding, but he was granted a divorce that June.\n\n11. Drew Barrymore – three weddings\n\nHer first husband was a bar owner named Jeremy Thomas. They were married for less than two months in 1994. Her next two marriages didn’t last long either; she was married to comedian Tom Green for less than a year before he filed for divorce in December 2001.\n\nHer next wedding was a little over 10 years later, when she wed Will Kopelman in June 2012. They were divorced in August 2016."
