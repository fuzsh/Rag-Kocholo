        "text": "The Dawson's Creek alum has always tried to keep her relationships quiet, as evidenced by the secret wedding to indie musician Elverum in July 2008. Even their split was kept on the down low, with news spreading in April 2019 that they ended their marriage earlier in the year. Michelle has since married and welcomed her first child with director Thomas Kail. They worked together on FX's Fosse/Verdon.\n\nSometimes couples never make it out of the honeymoon phase. Murphy married film producer/record executive Tracey Edmonds in a New Year's Day ceremony in Bora Bora at the start of 2008. Things allegedly fell apart within days (before they even left the island) and they ended the marriage two weeks later. The comedian is now engaged to Australian model Paige Butcher.\n\nThe Kill Bill badass married Gary, who is 12 years her senior, back in 1990. They divorced two years later, and Gary is now on wife number five, Gisele Schmidt. Uma wed Ethan Hawke in 1998, but they split in 2005.\n\nFor a very brief time, Bradley was married to Crash actress Jennifer. They tied the knot in late December 2006 but called it quits just four months later. “It was just something that happened,” Bradley told Howard Stern (via Us Weekly) in 2011. “The good thing is, we both realized it….Sometimes you just realize it.”\n\nHelen, who you should never forget starred in Twister, wed the controversial Simpsons voice actor in 1999 after dating for five years. They split in 2000 following 17 months of marriage. “Getting over someone is a grieving process,” Hank told Elle in 2012. “You mourn the loss of the relationship, and that’s only expedited by ‘out of sight, out of mind.’ But when you walk outside and see them on a billboard or on TV or on the cover of a magazine, it reopens the wound. It’s a high-class problem, but it’s real.”\n\nThe action star said “I do” to the Oscar-winning actress back in 1995, following a strange courtship that supposedly included a proposal from Nicolas the same day they met. After five years, they announced their separation, and the divorce was finalized in 2001.\n\nNot long after the ink on his divorce papers from Patricia had dried, Nicolas wed Elvis Presley’s daughter, Lisa Marie, who had previously been married to Michael Jackson. Nicolas filed for divorce in 2002 after three months of marriage. “I’m sad about this, but we shouldn’t have been married in the first place,” Lisa Marie said in a statement at the time.\n\nThe supermodel and the tennis legend married in 1997, but after two years, they “Suddenly Split,” as featured on the cover of People. In her 2014 memoir, Brooke detailed the time Andre revealed he’d been addicted to crystal meth during the first part of their relationship: “I was the one who had supported him unconditionally when he told me that he was basically bald and had been wearing hairpieces most of his adult life,” she wrote. “Why should this have been any different?”\n\nAngelina’s marriage to Brad Pitt is well-documented, but it’s often forgotten that her first husband was Jonny, who currently stars as Sherlock Holmes on the CBS procedural Elementary. After appearing in the 1995 movie Hackers together, they got hitched in 1996 with Angelina wearing black rubber pants and a white shirt with Jonny’s name written in her own blood on the back. “It’s your husband,” she explained to the New York Times that year. “You’re about to marry him. You can sacrifice a little to make it really special.” They divorced in 2000, but in May 2014, Angelina called him “still a great friend.”\n\nLong before Jennifer and Ben Affleck’s #Nannygate drama, Jennifer was married to Scandal hunk Scott. They met on the set of Felicity and wed in October 2000, but by March 2003, they had separated. “We didn’t have a shot,” Jennifer later told Allure. “He’s a really good guy, and we just imploded.”\n\nElisabeth met the SNL alum, who is 16 years her senior, in October 2008 when her Mad Men costar Jon Hamm hosted the sketch show. They married a year later but separated after just eight months. Fred later admitted to Howard Stern that he was “a terrible husband,” and Elisabeth cosigned that while talking to New York magazine in 2014. “Looking back, I feel like I was really young, and at the time, I didn’t think I was that young,” she said. “It was extremely traumatic and awful and horrible.”\n\nThe Jurassic Park daddy and the Thelma & Louise star met on the set of their movie Transylvania 6-5000 and went on to appear in two more films together: The Fly and Earth Girls Are Easy. They made things official with a Vegas wedding in 1987 but parted ways in 1990 after Geena filed for divorce, citing “irreconcilable differences.”\n\nMario was married to Ali “Doritos Girl” Landry for less than two weeks in 2004. They had the marriage annulled, and in 2011, Mario publicly copped to having cheated on her before the wedding. “At that point,” he told Howard Stern (via Us Weekly), “I was not ready to settle down. I wasn’t man enough to know how to go about handling it.”\n\nOnly three days after finalizing her divorce from Sonny Bono in 1975, Cher tied the knot with Gregg of The Allman Brothers Band. Nine days later, Cher filed for divorce from him, reportedly because of his issues with heroin and liquor, but they reconciled and stayed together until 1977.\n\nThe Grey’s Anatomy star married her Sideways director (also known for The Descendants and Nebraska) in 2003, but they called it quits in 2005. According to People, it took them more than two years to settle their finances.\n\nBack in 1993, Julia and country singer Lyle had a surprise wedding, with Lyle’s manager telling the Washington Post at the time that “it happened rapidly, very rapidly.” “I feel liberated in a way,” Julia reportedly told Premiere magazine while married. “I feel like this really pleasant calm has descended upon my life.” The calm didn’t last—the couple split after 21 months together.\n\nIt’s hard to forget Kim’s splashy wedding to Kris Humphries (followed by a splashy wedding to Kanye West), but her first husband came into the picture before every Kardashian move was tracked. She and Damon, a music producer, eloped in 2000 and divorced in 2004.\n\nWe’re all still mourning the demise of Will’s marriage to Amy Poehler, but the Parks & Rec star was actually his second wife. He and Adventures in Babysitting actress Penelope were married for less than a month after getting hitched in December 1994.\n\nBefore J. Lo got hot and heavy with A-Rod, she was married to Marc Anthony, and before that, dancer-choreographer Cris Judd. But first came Ojani, then a model/actor, whom Jennifer wed in 1997 and divorced in 1998. In 2016, Ojani appeared on Patti Stanger’s show, Million Dollar Matchmaker."
