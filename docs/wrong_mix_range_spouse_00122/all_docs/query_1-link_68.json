        "text": "It is the kind of audacious interpretation that has earned Mendes a reputation for being one of the foremost theatre directors in the world, brilliant at reinventing and transforming the most challenging texts into blockbuster theatre. This is something on display to dazzling effect in his in-augural season as the artistic director of the Bridge Project, the joint transatlantic classical repertory venture between Mendes, his friend Kevin Spacey of the Old Vic, and Joseph Melillo, the executive producer of BAM. For the venture's maiden voyage Mendes has paired two plays about regret and the passing of time: The Winter's Tale, Shakespeare's troubling, genre-defying play about a king's delusional and destructive impulses, with The Cherry Orchard, Chekhov's tragi-comedy about a bankrupt aristocratic landowner and her brother unable to recognise the arrival of a dangerous new plutocracy even when it's in their own drawing-room. It is a daring double bill that arrives in London this month as part of a world tour. 'There's something about working from the classical repertory that stretches you,' Mendes says of his decision to revive two plays so precariously poised between tragedy and hope. 'You can never be as good as the play, but you come out with your mind expanding.'\n\nDespite the high jinks onstage this afternoon at BAM, an air of tense concentration permeates the rehearsal. Opening night in New York is still one week away and Mendes, who has the look of a man badly in need of a night's sleep, is hoping his Anglo-American cast, which includes such heavy hitters as Simon Russell Beale, Sinéad Cusack, Rebecca Hall, Richard Easton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, will nail the new cuts he has just made to Act II. Timing is on everybody's mind. The ensemble of 20 actors and backstage team have to get a precise feel for how the timing works with the lighting, the props, Catherine Zuber's costumes, the designer Anthony Ward's set, and the composer Mark Bennett's score, which combines both pre-recorded music and live musicians and gives an extra psychological dimension to the play. 'We need it shorter if we can do it,' Mendes says, following a complicated set piece in which Hawke, who plays Autolycus as a pick-up artist and minstrel, sings three ballads while strumming a guitar and opening and closing a suitcase. 'I feel like I'm struggling with the focus thing,' Hawke says, and he and Mendes talk at length about the props – an easygoing give and take that characterises Mendes's directorial style. 'I would rather get it down now,' Mendes says, 'until we get the timing right.'\n\nTo watch the Bridge Project in final rehearsals is to be reminded of the tense few seconds during which an Olympic high-diver steadies himself on the springboard before propelling his body into thin air. To perform two such demanding ensemble plays – and in rotation – requires the kind of rigorous discipline, raft of technical skills and sheer acting muscle power that many casts are simply unable to find. 'Chekhov is like trying to hold water in your hands,' says Mendes, who commissioned Tom Stoppard to create a new translation of The Cherry Orchard for the company, one that draws out the comic elements in Chekhov's play. 'There's no driver of the play. It really is symphonic in the sense that it's like eight instruments playing together, that's when it starts to work. It's very, very difficult to get it to that stage.' Or as Hawke, who plays the student Trofimob, tells me, 'With The Cherry Orchard, you can step off the rope and fall to your death.' He pauses. 'Richard Easton and I have done about six plays together, and Josh Hamilton and I have done about 25 plays together, and we were so excited about this, we were in touch all over the summer. But a couple of weeks in, all of a sudden it really dawned on me, what if it doesn't work? What if it's terrible and we have to take them around the world? I thought, that would be really awful! Now we've got to fly to Singapore, now to Madrid. You assume it will go so well, and that's when you fall on your arse.'\n\nFor Mendes, fear is exactly why he's doing this. 'It was partly my own desire to give myself something that was a little bit scary, because that's what gets me up in the morning. Pressure is no bad thing.' Certainly he, Melillo and Spacey have done nothing if not set the bar high for themselves: their founding mission is nothing less than a 'new model of producing', as Melillo puts it, with the aim of creating a kind of transatlantic theatre in which actors from both the London and New York stage traditions draw on their different skills to initiate two large-scale classical plays over an extended rehearsal period, performing them in rotation at the Academy, the Old Vic and on tour worldwide over an 11-month period.\n\nCrucially, the Anglo-American cast for each season (the venture encompasses six plays over three years) will remain together throughout – an unprecedented situation due to the non-compete rules of the British and American stage actors' unions. The near perfect division between the Americans and the Brits is mirrored all the way through the company to include the designers, producers, creative teams. Before arriving at the Old Vic they will have visited Singapore, New Zealand, Spain and Germany, and will conclude their journey at the ancient theatre of Epidaurus in Greece. 'It's one of those rare experiences where people come together and do things outside of the box,' Kevin Spacey says. 'The idea of touring to other nations, the idea of using culture as a bridge, that countries may go to war but it's culture that unites us – that's very exciting.'\n\nThe story of the Bridge Project began five years ago, when the concept was kicked around over a series of breakfasts and lunches between Mendes and Spacey, as well as lunches and dinners between Caro Newling, Mendes's long-time producing partner since their Donmar Warehouse days, and Joseph Melillo, who had wanted to work again with Mendes ever since his acclaimed 2003 staging of Twelfth Night and Uncle Vanya at BAM. As Spacey recalls, he and Mendes, whose friendship began on the film American Beauty, had been talking about wanting to be challenged again by epic, classical pieces. 'And then Sam sat me down at this breakfast in New York and said, \"We're missing something, we're missing something.\" I said, \"What?\" He said, \"Well, there's something obvious, right in front of us. You're an American living in London running a theatre, I'm a Brit in New York directing plays, there's something to that…\"'\n\nWhen Mendes, now 44, arrived in New York in 2003 he had spent almost 20 years working flat-out; from artistic director of the Minerva theatre in Chichester, just a few years out of Cambridge, to directing Judi Dench in The Cherry Orchard in the West End when he was 24, to the Royal Shakespeare Company and later to the Donmar Warehouse, which he famously founded and ran for 10 years before building a career in films. 'I put everything I had for 10 years into my theatre, and then I was a bit wrung out and a bit uninspired and stale, and took time off, and in that time had a family,' he says, of his hiatus from the theatre. But after directing just one play in the past five years, David Hare's The Vertical Hour on Broadway, he wanted, he says, 'a challenge that was about finding a way to combine the bits of my life that I love into one. I've worked with a lot of these American actors on film, I worked with Richard Easton on Road to Perdition, and Josh Hamilton's in my film Away We Go, and then Simon Russell Beale was in Uncle Vanya and Twelfth Night. I thought, how can I unite two parts of my creative life into one unified thing?'\n\nSo began an epic period of plotting and planning to create a worldwide, not-for-profit repertory company, in which Mendes's production company, Neal Street Productions, the Old Vic and the Academy joined together as producing and financial partners, pooling their resources in what Melillo brands 'a new model for producing'. The backstage logistics have been equally mind-boggling. 'It's like a giant three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle with moving parts that changes over time,' says Nick Schwartz-Hall, the wry-humoured project line producer of the Academy who has been at the sharp end of organising the Bridge Project's world tour. He gives me a long laundry list of bureaucratic nightmares they have had to overcome: work visas, certificates of good health and good conduct in order to perform in Spain, multiple tax codes and budgetary requirements, and shifting exchange rates and hair-raising schedules for the transportation of backstage equipment to the international venues. 'Usually what happens is that the show has been created, it was already successful, and you have a year to figure out how to restage it and how to tour it. We're sitting here today trying feverishly to work out how we're going to take the fresh finished product and get from place to place.'\n\n'I hadn't realised the scale, it was genuinely much bigger than I thought it was going to be,' Mendes admits with a chuckle. It is two weeks after the opening of The Winter's Tale, the Bridge Project has been met in New York with huge acclaim and sell-out audiences, and Mendes is in a relaxed and expansive mood, all signs of fatigue gone. We are sitting in his comfortable, loft-like office tucked away in the Meatpacking District in Manhattan, the city he has called home for the past six years with his wife, the actress Kate Winslet, their five-year-old son Joe, and Mia, Winslet's eight-year-old daughter from her first marriage. Signs of his formidable career as a film director are all around us: there are posters of American Beauty, his debut as a film director that won five Academy Awards; Revolutionary Road, the recent film in which he directed Leonardo DiCaprio and Winslet; and Away We Go, the film scripted by Dave Eggers and his wife, Vendela Vida. 'The scale started becoming clear to me even before we went into rehearsals,' he continues, 'because cross-casting two plays – when every person has to have a part in both – is complicated anyway. Then you have to split it 50:50 between American and British and within that 50:50 supporting:leading. And then within that you have certain useful talents – who can do this, who can do that. It was a bit like a Rubik's Cube.'\n\nWhat added another layer of risk was that Mendes likes to leave creative design decisions until very late in the day and his cast rehearses without a set, in a circle. 'I'm quite eccentric,' he laughs. 'There are a lot of carpets on the floor, everyone has to take off their shoes. There are no cell phones, no newspapers, no discussions, they can't have a script in their hands, everyone has to watch each other work. That can lead to an enormous amount of self-consciousness in the first instance which breaks very quickly. It's weirdly intense, people come out very, very fired up.' Rebecca Hall, who plays Varya and Hermione, says, 'It didn't feel like going into the rehearsal room, it felt like going into a way of life.'\n\nDid Mendes find the Americans and British insecure around each other? 'Oh, riddled with insecurities!' he says. 'The Americans feel they don't have the experience to do Shakespeare, the English feel the Americans will be more au fait with Chekhov and Stanislavsky,' he says. 'But we're lucky in that the company has some witty and forthright people like Ethan, who is very funny about it. I can remember he put up his hand and said, \"I don't know what the f*** I'm doing,\" and everyone laughs and you just get on with it as opposed to people squirrelling away their issues.'\n\nOne such issue was that of accent and diction, a potential stumbling-block for audiences but one that Mendes, Melillo and Spacey firmly believe is redundant. 'My belief is that if people are playing the part properly the audience is not going to be looking for the accent, and that has happened; critically it's almost been ignored,' Mendes tells me with satisfaction. 'It's partly because we made use of it in The Winter's Tale in that Bohemia is basically America and Sicilia is England. But for me the big thing was establishing the company without a question mark hanging over it which says, yes, but, if they'd all been English or all been American it would have been better.'\n\nNo one who knows Sam Mendes ever doubted he could pull this off. 'When Sam says he's going to do something, he does it,' says Simon Russell Beale, a friend of some 20 years whom Mendes called 'my chief collaborator'. 'He wanted to move the stage on the first day of technical rehearsal. He realised it was slightly in the wrong position. He said, \"Do you think I should I do it?\" I said, \"Well, you've already decided. I know that face, I know that voice.\" ' For Russell Beale, who takes on the enormously demanding roles of the king, Leontes, and the peasant-turned-millionaire Lopakhin, 'the attraction was Sam', a view echoed by everyone I talked to. 'I did something that I've never done in my entire professional life, which is to write to a director and say I want to be part of this,' recalls Sinéad Cusack, who had wanted to play Chekhov's Ranevskaya 'for years and years'.\n\nFor the younger actors, many of whom have lucrative film careers, the chance to work with such theatrical heavyweights was too good to miss. 'I did a movie when I was 19 with Sinéad Cusack and Jeremy Irons, and I fell madly in love with her,' Ethan Hawke recalls. 'She's just the kind of actor I want to work with and learn from.' Rebecca Hall, the 26-year-old daughter of Sir Peter Hall, put on hold a burgeoning film career – she was recently in Woody Allen's Vicky Cristina Barcelona and Ron Howard's Frost/Nixon – to play Hermione and Varya. 'It's one thing to see on paper these incredible actors, it's another thing to realise that every day of the rehearsals I was learning something from them,' she says.\n\nFor the co-conspirators of the Bridge Project, watching the company they dreamt up give its first performances has been an emotional experience. 'I sat watching The Winter's Tale and thinking about the ramifications of what this company means, and I think it's incredibly moving,' says Spacey, who will be joining the company as an actor in its third season. (The second season pairs Chekhov's The Three Sisters with As You Like It.) 'I think it sends the right signals to other actors who are also finding success in film that theatre has an extraordinary place, and it is a place where you can create families that will last your whole life. And for me as an American, to have been welcomed to this country and to have had such an incredible run at the Old Vic, and to reunite with Sam who had such a significant mark on my career… It's incredibly important to me, and I can't wait for them to get here.'\n\nCaro Newling, who is deep into the planning for year two, says, 'It's been great to see Sam back on the shop floor, in rehearsal, with actors working on these two plays together, because it's mother's milk to him. He's putting down roots and he's creating something that has longevity.' Mendes himself admits it has been something of a homecoming. 'It's been quite an emotional journey because it feels like I'm back again in that place of creating something new. I said to Kate on the second preview of The Cherry Orchard, \"My God, I've got a company.\"' He pauses, 'For me there's always been that terrible cliche that the theatre's my wife and movies are my mistress. But that's what it feels like. It's how I started and I love it. I said to the company, until I did this I didn't realise there was a part of me missing; now I feel I have it back again.'"
