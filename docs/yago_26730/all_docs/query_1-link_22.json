        "text": "This story follows our Cherokee relatives from the mid 1600s though the Trail of Tears in 1839, and on into Oklahoma where they were relocated. Our family had five generations on the Trail simultaneously. Most of our family still resides in Oklahoma and are members of the Cherokee Nation. This account is told by Norma Sue (Baker) Macy whose 3rd great grandmother died in Kentucky while on the on the Trail of Tears. Some of the families covered here are: Hicks, Moytoy, Carpenter, Miller, Harris, Kearns, Patten, Baker, Macy, Clover and Clinton.\n\nOur family history has more tributaries than the Mississippi River, as do all families. From these many branches, we have chosen to feature a lineage that is very special to us, since our grandmothers were of Cherokee heritage. This is a history of English noblemen, from the middle ages to the time of immigration to the ‘New World’ and the Cherokee people, coming together to blend into what is now our family.\n\nSixteen generations descended from Lord Robert Hicks, born in 1192, before Nathan Hicks was born in Albermarle Parish, Sussex, Virginia. He married Nancy Elizabeth (Broom) Ward, Hicks also called Nan Ye Hi Wolf and Nanye-Hi Ghi Ghau (the last Beloved Woman of the Cherokee). Nancy and Nathan Hicks were my 5th great grand parents. Nancy Elizabeth Ward (Wolf Clan) was descended from the line of influential Cherokee Chiefs, the Moytoy/Carpenters. Two of her grandmothers held the title of “Beloved Woman,” the highest honor bestowed on women by the tribe. Some of Nancy’s ancestry can be traced back to England and France as well.\n\nThe Hicks line is traced back to 1192 in England, but we begin this history in 1720 with Robert Hicks, whose father immigrated to Plymouth Colony. There were thirteen generations preceding Robert and Mary Hicks and those are detailed at the end of this narrative.\n\nRobert Hicks (“Who went to live with the Indians”) was born 1720 in Albermarle, Sussex, Virginia. He died in Sussex, Sussex County, Virginia, on January 22, 1780. He was the husband of Mary (Courtney) Hicks b. 1710, d. 1752. Robert and Mary Hicks were the parents of Nathaniel Hicks. He had one brother and eight sisters. They were: Steven Hicks, Martha Sarah (Hicks) Bass, Amy Hicks, Elinor (Hicks), Nallapy and (second marriage) Rice, Susanna Hicks, Ann Hicks, Jean Hicks, Jane Hicks, and Tabitha Hicks Robert was the son of John Hicks and Rebecca (Rives) Hicks.\n\nNathan and Nancy\n\nNathaniel Hicks\n\nThe son of Robert Hicks and Mary (Courtney) Hicks. He was born in November 6, 1743 in Albermarle Parrish, Sussex, Virginia. He died in 1829 at Spring Place, Georgia, Cherokee Nation East.\n\nHis first marriage was to Nancy Elizabeth Ward (Broom) ‘NanYe-Hi Wolf who was born July 20th, 1736 in Chota, Cherokee nation East. She died at Benton, Polk County, Tennessee in 1822. Nancy and Nathan were married in (1757-1758) in Cherokee Nation East, Overhill, Georgia. (Washington, Tennessee). The children of Nathan Hicks and NanYe-hi made a significant impact on the history of the Cherokee Nation. Two sons, Charles Renatus Hicks and William Abraham Hicks served as Principal Chiefs of the Cherokee Nation, and daughter Elizabeth (Hicks) Fields, was for a time, the wife of the Texas Cherokee Principal Chief Richard Fields.\n\nThis is Emmet Starr’s account concerning the early Hicks family. This excerpt is taken from The History of the Cherokee Indians, page 260:\n\n“Broom’s town was the home of Chief Broom who’s daughter Nancy, a member of the Wolf clan, married Nathan Hicks, a white man. Nathan and Nancy Hicks where the parents of Charles, William and Elizabeth Hicks, who married James Vann, Richard Fields, Eliphas Holt and William Campbell. There were possibly other brother brothers and sisters, but their names are unknown. Charles Hicks was probably born in the decade between 1760 and 1770. It is not known when he was educated as there were no schools among the Cherokees during his boyhood. He joined the church of the United Brethren at Spring Place and was baptized on April 10, 1813 at which time the missionaries, as was their wont, conferred upon him the middle name of Renatus or the renewed; Charles Renatus Hicks.”\n\nNancy Elizabeth Ward Hicks born Broom was also known as Nanye-Hi-Ghi-Ghau Ward and Nannie Ward. Her mother and father were Tame Doe White Owl Raven Kitigusta and Anakwanki Skayagustuegwo “Chief Broom”. She had three marriages, two of which were very early in her life. She was married to “Tsu-la”, Kingfisher of the Deer Clan in about 1751. She was about fifteen years of age at that time. He died in battle in 1755. She then wed an already married white trader named Bryant Ward who soon returned to his white wife in South Carolina. Nancy was about 22 years old when she wed Nathaniel Hicks. The marriage lasted about 15 years and they had six children.\n\nThis is an account of an important event in her life, for which she is renowned. It occurred when she was married to her first husband, Tsu-la also known as “Kingfisher”. As a young mother of two during the Battle of Talliwa against the Creeks, she crouched behind a log, loading the guns for her husband, Kingfisher. She chewed the ends of the bullets to make them cause more damage. When he was killed, NanYe’Hi picked up his gun and continued the battle, rallying the Cherokee to victory.\n\nThe Cherokee made her “The Ghi-ga-u” a Beloved Woman, a position reserved for brave and wise women who served as their people’s guide.\n\nAs a child, Nancy Ward was known as “Tsituna-Gus-Ke” (Wild Rose) “from the delicate texture of her skin which was likened to rose petals.” Her mother, Tame Doe, was a member of the Wolf clan and the sister of Chief Attakullakulla. It is said that Nancy may have learned both the Cherokee and English languages from her mother.\n\nNanYe-Hi, Nancy Elizabeth, was born into a powerful family of the Wolf Clan about 1736 at Chota City of Refuge, Cherokee Nation East. Her father was Skayagustuegwo Fivekiller, a Cherokee-Delaware man also called Chief Broom. He is thought to be related to the famous Delaware leader and peacemaker, Chief Taminand, (b.1625, d.1701) through his birthfather, Fivekiller Taminand.\n\nEarly in her life, Nancy is said to have had a vision of spirits helping her find her way home after she had become lost. Thereafter she became known as “NanYe-Hi” which means “One who is with the Spirit People”.\n\nNancy Elizabeth became a leader within the Cherokee nation and because she held the title of Ghi-gha U, Beloved Woman of the Cherokee, Nancy was allowed to sit in councils and to make decisions, along with the Chiefs and other Beloved Women. She believed in peaceful coexistence with the European Americans and helped her people as a peace negotiator and ambassador. Nancy headed the Women’s council in the Cherokee tribe, which consisted of a representative from each clan, and she sat as a voting member of the council of Chiefs.\n\nIt was believed that the Supreme Beings often spoke to the people through the Beloved Women and they were given absolute power in the question of the fate of prisoners taken in war, a power given only to the Ghi Gha U. Nancy did not hesitate to use this power to save one such prisoner of war, Mrs. Lydia Bean, who had been sentenced to burn at the stake. She took Mrs. Bean into her own home and nursed her back to health after the ordeal. Mrs. Bean taught Nancy new weaving skills and cheese making methods, as well as to farm and raise live stock. Nancy introduced this new ways to her Cherokee People.\n\nNancy encouraged better relationships between the English and the Native Americans, and she was an advocate for women’s rights, both in the Indian Tribes and in the colonies. Because of her experience with war, she may have been influenced to become a peacemaker in her later life.\n\nIn 1772 an English diplomat, James Robertson, visited Nancy in her home at Chota (when she was about 35 years old). He described it as being furnished in a “barbaric splendor,” that befitted her high rank. He pictured her as queenly and commanding.\n\nNancy participated in the Treaty of July 20, 1781, and the Treaty at Hopewell, November 28, 1785, as a principal speaker. She emphasized her never-ending desire to seek peace for her people, and how important it was for the Cherokees to hold on to as much of their land as possible.\n\nNancy Elizabeth (Broom) Ward, Hicks was later in life known by the term of endearment “Granny Ward”. She was a caretaker of children and adopted two children, Meli Ward, (1774 -1825, born at Chota) and William S. Taylor, (1775-1837). Meli was the daughter of an unknown Cherokee warrior and a Cherokee mother and was half sister to Nancy’s children: Little Fellow Hiskitihi and Ka-ti Harlan (Tsu-La was father) and Elizabeth Betsy Hughes (Bryant Ward was father).\n\nWilliam S. Taylor was the biological son of John Taylor and unknown half Cherokeee mother. William married his adoptive sister, Meli, and they had about three children including General William S. Taylor.\n\nAfter 1819, Nancy left Chota and settled on the Ocoee River close to Benton, Tennessee. She operated an inn at Woman Killer Ford until her death in 1822. Near the end of her life, Nancy reportedly had a vision in which she saw “a great line of our people marching on foot. Mothers with babies in their arms, fathers with small children on their backs. Grandmothers and grandfathers with large bundles on their backs. They were marching West and the ‘Unaka’ (white soldiers) were behind them. They left a trail of corpses, the weak, and the sick, who could not survive the journey.”\n\nNancy is buried on a hill nearby near Benton, Tennessee. In 1923, a monument was placed on her grave by a Chattanooga Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.\n\nThe children of Nathan and Nancy were:\n\nSarah Gosaduisga, born 1758\n\nElizabeth Hicks, born 1759, died 1792\n\nMary Hicks, born 1763, died 1835\n\nNathan Wolf Hicks, born 1764, died 1801\n\nCharles Hicks, born January 23, 1767 and died January 20th, 1827, Spring Place, Murray County, Georgia\n\nWilliam Abraham Hicks, born 1769, died 1828\n\nNancy Elizabeth (Broom) Ward, Hicks and Nathaniel Hicks\n\nparted ways before the time of the Revolutionary War.\n\nNathaniel married a second wife later in life, Temperance (Dumas) Hicks.\n\nThey had about two children.\n\nElijah Hicks, born c.1797\n\nElizabeth Betsy Hicks, born 1771\n\nMoytoy/Carpenter Family\n\nTame Doe White Owl Raven Kitigusta was Nancy Elizabeth (Broom) Hicks’ mother. Tame Doe was a member of the Cherokee Wolf Clan and was born around (1708-1710) in Telico and died in 1760 in Chota. She was buried at Coyatee, Cherokee Nation East, Tennessee. She was also known as Catherine Tame Doe Attakullakulla, Nancy Elizabeth, Betsy Owl (Little Carpenter), Tame Doe Raven, Nancy Nanye-hi Moytoy and Nancy Carpenter Moytoy.\n\nTame Doe married Anakwanki Skayagustuegwo ‘Fivekiller’ Kitigusto (also known as Chief Broom) in about 1729. He was Nancy Elizabeth (Broom) Hicks’ father. Tame Doe’s husband, Anakwanki Skayagustuegwo Five Killer “Chief Broom” of the Delaware tribe, was born (1710) in Cherokee Nation East, Broomtown, Tennessee and died circa 1792 in Rockdale, Georgia. He was also known as the Raven of Chota.\n\nAnakwanki Skayagustuegwo Five Killer’s parents were Oshaqua Moytoy, (born Delaware) b.1674, d.1754, and Swan-Wapehti Hop Moytoy (born Shawnee-Powhatan), b.1664, d.1757. When Oshaqua’s parents were killed by Creek Indians he was adopted by Amadoniyi (Moytoy II) and Go-sa-du-isga (Nancy Carpenter). Skayagustuegwo’s father is also referred to as Taminad Five Killer of the Delaware (Turtle Clan, Lenni Lenape). He is also known as Oshaqua Moytoy.\n\nAnakwanki Skayagustuegwo Five Killer’s mother, Swan Wapehti Hop, was adopted by Moytoy II as well, (Young Trader Tom Carpenter and Nancy). Swan’s parents were killed by Catawba raiders. Swan Wapehti Hop’s birth parents wereMisahpelewa “Big Turkey” Hop, Sachem Cornstalk b.1660 and Nonoma, Powhatan a Chalakatha-Hopia woman, Shawnee.\n\nGosaduisga Nancy Quatsie Five Killer of the Shawnee b.1664, in Running Water Tennessee, is the other name for Swan Wapehti Hop, (Skayagustuegwo [Chief Broom] Five Killer’s mother). Anakwanki Skayagustuegwo Five Killer had two sisters, Ounaconoa Muskrat Moytoy and Ahneewakee Muskrat Moytoy.\n\nIt is the custom of the Cherokee people for the grandmothers to name the grandchildren. Swan-Wapehti Hop, also known as Gosaduisga, may have named her granddaughter, (Nathan Hicks and Nancy Elizabeth [Broom] Ward, Hicks’ first child), Sarah Gosaduisga Hicks.\n\nTame Doe Raven had 20 siblings, one of which was Chief Attakullakulla (‘Little Carpenter’ Cherokee Wolf Clan). An interesting comment was made by Attakullakulla during the 1757 treaty negotiations in the time of the French and Indian War. The Cherokee leader, who was Nancy Elizabeth Ward’s maternal uncle, expressed his surprise that no white women were present at the treaty negotiations. “Since the white man as well as the red is born of woman,” he said, “why does not the white man admit women to their councils?”\n\nThe Cherokee had a matrilineal society. This meant children belonged to the mother’s clan, and hereditary leadership and property were passed through the maternal line. Traditionally, women were considered the head of household among the Cherokee, with the home and children belonging to her if she should separate from a husband. Maternal uncles were considered very important in the lives of their nieces and nephews. Cherokee society was also matrilocal, meaning once married, a couple moved in with or near the brides family.\n\nAmatoya Moytoy of Chota, (Moytoy I) b.1640 – d.1730, was a prominent town chief in what is present day Tennessee. He held the hereditary title Ama Matai (pronounced mah-tie). The name matai is from French and ama is the Cherokee word for water. It translates as Water Conjurer. He was also known as Trader Tom and Moytoy I. Amatoya Moytoy’s mother and father were Thomas Pasmere Carpenter and Pride of the Shawnee. In 1680, Amatoya married (in 1680), Quatsy of Tellico b. 1650, d. 1692. She was the daughter of Taminad Munsawghe (1607-1675) and Pride Munsawghe (1615-1679). Other names for Quatsy are: Elizabeth, Que-Di-Si, Oo-yo-sti Otiyu, Polly, or Quali of the Ani’-Wa’ya (Ani’-Way’ya = Wolf Clan) and Locha Quatsy Shawnee Qeu disi Carpenter (born Tellico Wolf Clan).\n\nThe children Amatoya and Quatsy were: Caulunna, the Raven of Chota, Tistoe l, Nancy Nanye-hi Moytoy, Standing Turkey, Chief of the Cherokee, Ailsey Dougherty, of the Wolf Clan, Aganusitsi Quatie “Quatsy”, Amahetai ll Moytoy of Tellico, Go-la-nv Hop-Moytoy, “Raven of Hiwassee”, Oukah-Ulah Skiagusta, Kanagatoga “Old Hop” Moytoy, First Beloved Man of the Cherokee, and Elizabeth Raven-Hop Moytoy.\n\nThomas Pasmere Carpenter (1607-1675) was from a family of English Ship owners. He was born in Plymouth England and came to Jamestown, Virginia in 1627. He was living in a cave near the Shawnee tribe when he met and married Pride Chalakahatha Cornstalk, a Shawnee woman. Her mother, Sachem, was of the Turkey clan and her father, Young Cornstalk, was Wind clan. Pride was born around 1615 and died in 1679 in Running Water, Tennessee.\n\nThomas was called “Cornplanter” by the Shawnee, derived from their sign language that matched as near as possible to the work of a carpenter. The children of Thomas and Pride were Pasmere Carpenter; Mikona “Do Yo Sti” Greenwood, Chalakatha Shawnee; “Rainmaker”, Kishkope Shawnee and Trader Tom, “Water Conjuror” (Moytoy I), who became an important Cherokee town chief. Amatoya, (Moytoy I), was taught by his father, Thomas, to “witch” for water with a willow stick. He had become so adept at water witching that the Cherokee called him “water conjurer” or Ama Matai. He ruled the town of Chota sometime between the beginning of the eighteenth century and 1730.\n\nMany of the descendants of Amatoya Moytoy and Quatsie of Telico went on to become prominent leaders, founding a family that ruled the Cherokee for over a century.\n\nThe Carpenter line of ancestors stretches far back in history to England and France and to the first crusades long before Thomas Pasmere Carpenter immigrated to the new world. Their known history begins with Lord Josselin of Melun, Seine-et-Marne, born in 920, who was married to Princess Jeanne de Melan de Bourbon. The British royal family is included as cousins of the Moytoys, through their kinship to Carpenter Earl of Tyrconell. These families will be detailed at the end of the Hicks history.\n\nCharles was sent to a private school in Virginia by his Virginia-born father. The first generation of native Cherokee lawyers were the mixed blood children of early whites, who were attorneys in the sense of many gentlemen of the southland. They were essentially planters, farmers, and merchants who had read the law in an office or picked up the knowledge from their own experience, observation and study. Foremost among this group was Charles Hicks who was an important figure in the period of transition from the old ways. He actually wrote the first Cherokee law in Broom Town September 11, 1808.\n\nIt is said that Sequoyah (cousin of Charles Hicks) asked Charles to help him to learn to sign his name on his silversmith work. He learned to sound out the syllables and connect them with the letters that they represented. He was then able (c.1821) to compile the Cherokee alphabet syllabary making reading and writing possible.\n\nCharles Renatus Hicks, son of Nathaniel Hicks and Nancy Elizabeth (Broom) Ward, Hicks, married Lydia (Halfbreed) on December 23rd of 1791, at the town of Tamali.\n\nLydia Halfbreed (wife of Charles Hicks) was the daughter of James Stand “Big Chief Gu-U-li-Si ‘Will’ Halfbreed” and Qua-la-yu-ga “Old Hannah Halfbreed” Hannah Crittendon. Lydia’s Indian name was Chow-U-Ka Gahno and was of the Wild Potato Clan. She was born in (1774) in Chikamaugua District, Georgia. Lydia and Charles had two daughters. Nancy Hicks was born 1792 and died January 9, 1866. Their second daughter, Catherine (Hicks) Miller was born in 1793 and died in 1839 on the Trail of Tears in Powderly, Kentucky. Lydia was listed on the Siler Rolls (census) in 1851.\n\nLydia died after 1851 at Fort Gibson, Beaties Prairie, Indian Territory. Lydia Halfbreed was first married to Lenard D. Shaw (date unknown). Then to Chief Charles R. Hicks in 1791. She married William Abraham Hicks, (Charles’ brother) c.1793. They had a son named George Augustus Hicks. Lydia also married Daniel McCoy, James Chisholm, James Foster Jr., and George Chisholm.\n\nLydia Halfbreed came west on the Trail of Tears with many of her family including her mother Hannah Crittendon. Our family had 5 generations on The Trail of Tears at the same time. It is thought that they all traveled in the contingent lead by Catherine’s half brother, George Augustus Hicks, (whose father was William Abraham Hicks). Catherine’s half brother, Elijah Hicks was also a contingent leader of about eight hundred Cherokee people.\n\nThe five generations on the trail consisted of Old Hannah Crittendon, her daughter Lydia (Halfbreed) Hicks, Lydia’s daughter Catherine (Hicks) Miller, and Catherine’s son Avery Vann Miller and his children.\n\nThey departed from Mouse Creek Tennessee on November 5, 1838. It is thought that their contingent consisted of about one thousand people. After many grueling months on the trail, the family arrived at Beaties Prairie, (Ft. Gibson) Indian Territory, on March 15, 1839.\n\nTwo of our family perished on the trail. Catherine died in 1839 in Powderly, Kentucky and the wife of Avery Vann Miller, Nanny Ward, died in 1838 at a place unknown.\n\nCatherine’s grandmother, Old Hannah, survived the Trail of Tears and lived for many years in Indian Territory (present day Oklahoma).\n\nThis description was taken from the book, History of the Moravian Missions Among the Southern Indian Tribes by The Rev. Edmund Schwarze, Ph.D. and paints a picture of great, great, great, great Grandmother Hannah Crittendon. Her Indian name was Old Hanna Gua Li Uka. Hannah was born in 1740 and died in 1860 being 120 years old when she passed away. It is said that she was 96 or so years old when she made the trek on the Trail of Tears.\n\n“Accompanied by the Interpreter, Avery Miller, (the [grand]son in law of Hannah Crittendon), Bahnson made many visits in the homes of members in the Canaan neighborhood, noting especially, a call made on “Hannah,” a remarkable Cherokee character. She was probably, the oldest member ever in the Moravian Church, certainly the oldest ever baptized by Moravian missionaries, having been born in 1740, therefore, at this time, 118 years old. Bahnson writes that the house was the smallest he had ever seen, being 10 x 12 feet, with clay floor and a fireplace. Upon a bed lay Hannah, the oldest person Bahnson had ever seen. (“She was all wrinkles.”) She was very weak but able, at times, to go about on a stick. At the age of 108, she had been baptized by our missionaries and had answered the baptismal questions heartily, with childlike faith and eyes full of tears.”\n\nHannah ‘Gua Li Uka’ Crittendon (my 5th great grandmother) lived to be 120 years old and during that time, experienced monumental change in the lives of the Cherokee people.\n\nThe Hicks/Halfbreed family history is recorded on page 448 of the Dr. Emmet Starr’s History of the Cherokee Indians, published by the Warden Company in 1921 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.\n\nCatherine (Hicks) Miller, b.1793, d.1839, (Wild Potato Clan), daughter of Charles Hicks and Lydia (Halfbreed) Hicks, married (Old) Andrew Miller (#2) (b.1774, d.1818), and had 7 children. Avery Vann Miller, born in 1815, was the first child.\n\nAvery Vann Miller’s siblings were: Elizabeth b.1817, Alfred b.1819, Elmira b.1821-1884, Isabelle b.1823, Lucinda, 1818-1910, and Andrew Jackson Miller (#3) b.1827-1851. This Andrew Jackson Miller was the uncle of Andrew Jackson Miller (#4).\n\nOld Andrew Miller (#2) was murdered 1818 in Tennessee in the Red Clay area by William Manley over a boundary dispute on Catherine’s Indian land. After Catherine was widowed, she moved to Georgia to be close to her mother, Lydia, and married (around 1804-1814) Thomas Gann and had 4 children. They lived on the Hiawassee River in Georgia before Catherine made the trek on the Trail of Tears.\n\nOld (2) Andrew Miller, Avery Vann Miller’s father, was descended from David Miller and Martha Harris, who was born around 1728 and died 1811. She may have been born around Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Her parents were Charles Harris and Jane McCelhenney. The Charles Harris’ family is recorded in “The Empire Builders: Book 1, The Genealogy of the Harris Family” (Harris family records by Jane Montgomery Seaver, 1929, published by American Historical and Genealogical Society). Included in the direct Harris line, is an array of emperors, kings, queens, and nobility including Robert the Bruce, William the Conqueror, and Charlemagne.\n\nDavid Miller was born around 1730 and died in March of 1819. He was the son of oldest (#1) Andrew Miller who died in 1776. Old (#2) Andrew’s birth was recorded in April of 1776 in his grandfather’s will in Mecklenburg, North Carolina. (Will book B, pages 52 to 54).\n\nDavid Miller was a commissioner designated to found the city of Kingston at South West Fort at South West Point in Tennessee. He was Avery Vann Miller’s Grandfather.\n\nAvery Vann Miller, b. December 15th, 1808, d. January 26, 1865, was the son of Catherine (Hicks) Miller and Old (#2) Andrew Miller. Avery’s Indian name was AhWi. He came west on the Trail of Tears with his children and extended family. His wife, Nanny Ward b. 1810, died on the trail in 1839. The children of Avery and Nanny (Ward) Miller were: Joseph Gambold Miller, Sussana Miller, Elmira Miller, David Miller, Martha Jane Miller, and Miller Wart Miller. Avery Vann Miller may have assisted the missionaries while living in Tennessee by translating for them. He may also have interpreted between the Cherokees and the soldiers while on the Trail of Tears.\n\nAvery married Susannah ‘Susie’ Spaniard (census card #1164) about 1840. Susannah was born in 1803 and died on April 25th, 1875. Susie Spaniard’s parents were Frank Spaniard and Hannah Chisholm. Their Indian names were (Ga-lun-ghe) and (N-wa-dee-ya-he). Susie’s Indian name was Wa-tec-nee-ya. She was buried at Hickory Grove Cemetery in 1875 in Indian Territory. It is said that Susie Spaniard donated the land for the cemetery and hers was the first grave there in. Avery and Susannah’s children included: Andrew Jackson Miller (#4), born 21st of July 1845 at Beaties Prairie, Indian Territory. Avery Vann Miller’s sister, Isabelle, married Brig. General Stand Watie, the only Cherokee general in the Civil War.\n\nThe following is an excerpt from a family history of harrowing stories that Martha Jane Patten (also known as Grandmother Reynolds) told to her granddaughter Pearl (Kearns) McCauley around 1935.\n\nPictured: Martha Jane (Patten) Miller circa 1868 from a tin type.\n\n“When the Civil War began, the Kansas Jayhawkers robbed them and they moved to Benton county Arkansas where there was a big spring, and three houses. And nearby was a slash with cypress stumps 3 feet high, and buffalo gnats and gal nippers. There is now a summer resort in this place. On a Thursday in the winter of 1863, their home along with the two others, was burned by northern soldiers (The Missouri militia. The so-called Republicans). They came to the house and asked if this was where Captain Patten lived. When they found that it was his house, the leader said “get down, boys, and burn this house”. Jane, then 12 years of age, went into talk to them. It was between breakfast and dinner time. The soldiers picked up the crocs full of milk and drank their fill, and then just dropped the crocs, letting them break. The baby, Kate, was sitting on the bed the soldiers told Jane to take the baby out of the house. She took one quilt wrapped around the baby. The soldiers then set fire to the bed by getting coals from the stove and folding the quilts over them. They stayed until the house burned down. Her mother was one and a half miles up the road, (the Yeargin girl was sick). She started home, saw the fires, met the soldiers and said” you burned my baby”. They said no, the girl took it out.\n\nThe family moved into a blacksmith shop and built a fireplace. They had no beds so set up all night. They had nothing but the clothes on their back’s. Five families, from three houses, with nothing to eat.\n\nThere was winter snow. They finally got straw in the corners for beds. On Monday, Jane’s mother told her to go back where the house had been to get the pony. Returning with her horse, she met a gang of soldiers riding horseback. They were leading an old poor horse, and offered to trade it for hers. She told them she “wouldn’t be caught dead on that horse.” And besides they stole him. They took her horse but she took off the bridal, and called them all names. One man said “you talk awful sassy to be a little girl”. A gentleman said, you let her alone. Near home she began to cry, her mother ran out to meet her saying, “what is the matter”. She said “those Devils took my horse.”\n\nAnother favorite family story concerns Capt. Jim Patten during the Civil War.\n\n“Father bought a bear skin coat in New Orleans. He had several bullet holes in his clothes, but he was never scratched. A bullet struck at the back of the shoulder and cut a trench across the back of the fur coat. He was never wounded although he had seen men fall on each side.”\n\nAn interesting branch of the Moytoy history has to do with our 5th great grandmother Old Hannah Crittendon.\n\nIt begins with Cornelius Dougherty (Ahneeunkee) who is said to be the first white man who is known to have resided amongst the Cherokee. He married Ailsey Dougherty, of the Wolf Clan, daughter of Chief Moytoy I and Quatsie. She was our 7th great grandmother. Cornelius and Ailsey had a son named Cornelius Dougherty (#2) who was born about 1700 and died at Seneca Old Town on the Keowee, Cherokee Nation East. He married A-nu-wa-gi (Peggy) Moytoy of the Wild Potato Clan.\n\nShe was the Daughter of Amehetai II Moytoy of Tellico and Gosaduisga (Morning Star) of the Wild Potato Clan. A-nu-wa-gi (Peggy) Moytoy was born in 1710 in Gaffney, Cherokee County, South Carolina. She died there about 1742. Cornelius (#2) and Peggy Moytoy had several children including our 6th great grandmother.\n\nJennie (Dougherty) Crittendon (her Cherokee name has been lost) was born about 1725 and died 1826. Jennie Dougherty married Crittendon (first name unknown). They were the parents of Qua-la-yu-ga “Old Hannah” (Crittendon) Halfbreed Gu-U-li-si. Qua-la-yu-ga Hannah Crittendon, who was born in 1740, married Big Chief Gu-U-Li-Si Will Halfbreed. Their daughter was Lydia Halfbreed, Chow-U-Ka Gahno b.1769. Lydia Married Charles Renatus Hicks about 1790 and they had a daughter, Catherine (Hicks) Miller. She later married Charles Hicks’ brother William Abraham Hicks. Lydia and William had a son, George Agustus Hicks. And so…this strand of the Moytoy family gets woven back in to the mainstream of our Moytoy/Hicks lineage. Hannah Crittenden was also our family’s link to Thomas H. Forrest who helped to found Jamestown in 1608. Thomas’ granddaughter, Anne Forrest, married into the Crittenden family as well. Thomas Forrest brought his wife, Margret Foxe, who is said to be the first English “gentle woman” in the New World. The “Nancys” of the Moytoy family are numerous and sometimes confusing.
