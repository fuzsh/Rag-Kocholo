        "text": "Notes\n\nHenri II de Trastamare (13 jan 1334 - 29 - 1379) Enrique de Trastamare, Murdered Pedro, and then became king. (Queen Isabel the Catholic was a descendant of Enrique de Trastamare.)\n\n\"Battle of Navarette-Nájera, 1367\" by Martin Davis.\n\nNavarette (Nájera) is interesting for several reasons. Firstly, it shows the ascendancy of the English bowman over an unusual opponent-- light cavalry. Secondly, it occurred outside the normal sphere of combat for the period (at least as far as we insular British are concerned). Thirdly, it contains some of the great figures of the high chivalric period-- du Guesclin, Chandos, John of Gaunt and the Black Prince. Finally, but for me interestingly, it forms the background to the last part of Conan Doyle's \"The White Company\".\n\nThe 'rightful' king of Castile, Pedro the Cruel, had been deposed by his subjects, led by his half-brother, Henry of Trastamara, who had become the new king, and Bertrand du Guesclin, the renowned French knight. Pedro fled the country and went to see the Black Prince, administering the English provinces around Bordeaux. Edward was incensed by the idea of a king being deposed (I imagine he was also glad of an excuse to stop doing paperwork and organise a fight) and set about recruiting troops [1]. Men from Gascony and Aquitaine answered his call; his younger brother John came from England with 400 knights and a large number of archers the King of Majorca produced some troops; and of course, the 'Free Companies' of mercenaries were always available.\n\nIn February, 1367, Edward set out with his force, through the Pyrenees. He crossed the Ebro at Logroño where he had heard that Henry of Trastamara was only a short distance off, and the Allied army went through the small town of Navarette along the minor road to Najera.\n\nHenry made his stand with the River Najarilla at his back--this seems to me to be a pretty elementary mistake and one wonders why he did it. Still, he wasn't stupid and with du Guesclin advising him there must have been some motive. The most likely explanation to me is that he felt that the strength of his army lay in its cavalry rather than its large numbers of conscript infantry and that these could be used to best advantage on the featureless plain that separates Najera from Navarette. Quite probably the idea of defeat never even occurred to him--his army outnumbered that of Edward and Pedro by about 29,500 to 24,000 and I should think he was quite happy. Battle of Navaratte diagram\n\nBoth sides arrayed their forces in three lines laid out in a comparable manner. The front line of Henry's army was led by du Guesclin in person, with 1500 picked men-at-arms and 500 crossbowmen . To oppose this Edward put his brother John of Gaunt with 3000 infantry and 3000 archers. In Henry's second line were two flanking forces of Spanish light cavalry mixed with a core of heaves. At this time Spain was beginning to experiment with light cavalry--later to develop into the 'genitors' of the Renaissance--for skirmishing purposes; an idea that had dropped out of contemporary European military thinking. The centre of the line was led by Henry himself with the cream of his heavy cavalry, 1500 strong. The Black Prince was also in the second line together with Pedro the Cruel and 4000 infantry, l/2 of them archers. Flanking him were two similar forces under Captal de Buch and Sir Thomas Percy. The third line of Henry's force consisted of 20,000 Spanish infantry of mixed capability, ranging from well armed professionals to reluctant con scripts. On Edward's side, the third line was led by the King of Majorca and the Count Armagnac with 3000 foot and 3000 archers. In all three divisions on Edward's side, the men-at-arms or foot were drawn up in the centre with the archers on either flank. As soon as the Black Prince was satisfied with the dispositions, he ordered his entire army to dismount and had the horses sent to the rear. [2]\n\nDu Guesclin led his vanguard and they smashed into Lancaster's division. The English longbowmen dispersed the Castilian crossbowmen but once the melee had started the press was such that they could con tribute little. Lancaster and du Guesclin remained locked together throughout the remainder of the battle, fighting hand to hand. The Spanish flanking cavalry forces then charged the advancing flanks opposing them. Normally, the heavy contingent held back while the light cavalry harassed the sides of the opposition and probed for a weak spot along the front, seeking to create a gap where the heavy cavalry could drive in a wedge and smash the entire formation. This system had proved very successful--against infantry armed with spears or the slowloading crossbow. Against longbowmen it proved disastrous. As the Spaniards moved along the front, avoiding hand to hand combat and hurling their javelins, they were shot down in droves. Surprised, they drew back to organise--and suffered still more heavily. As they wavered, the heavy cavalry leaders took in charges to restore morale and never even reached the units they were charging. The demoralisation on the Spanish flanks was now complete--the cavalry remaining wheeled about and fled the field leaving Gomez Carillo to be captured.\n\nPercy and de Buch now capitalised on their momentary advantage in the best possible way--by joining up to make a cohesive front. This was done so neatly that I can only imagine that Edward had briefed them to do this before the battle. In any event, they moved in unhurriedly together and managed to link behind du Guesclin's force, still battling Lancaster. The men-at-arms turned inwards to take du Guesclin's men from the rear, while the archers faced out against the inevitable Spanish counter attack. It was not long in coming. Henry realised that the Percy/de Buch line had to be broken. Three times his knights charged; and each time the charge faded to nothing under the withering hail of arrows. Edward moved up his own central division to increase the pressure on du Guesclin. Desperately, Henry ordered up his infantry mass--but again it never came to grips with the forces of Edward and Pedro. Despite the disparity in numbers the archers waited calmly until the infantry were in range and loosed salvo after salvo. The infantry faltered, broke and fled. Realising the battle was lost, Henry went too. The Spanish cavalry were able to scatter but the infantry could only escape over the narrow bridge of Najera. As the fresh third division swept round passed Percy and chased after them, many Spaniards died, both in the press and by drowning. Du Guesclin did not surrender until he realised that the Spanish army had gone. His force had been surrounded throughout the battle, 1/4 of its number were dead, practically all the others injured.\n\nConsequences of the battle\n\nAfter the battle, most of Henry's captains were captured by English, who protected them against Pedro. The own Henry had dissapeared, and was supposed to be dead (he managed to escape to France). Pedro recovered the throne, starting one of his frequent blood baths, while arguing with the black Prince, because of the prize of his help. Edward eventually started to negociate secretly the repartition of Castile between England, Aragon, Navarre & Portugal and returned to Aquitaine. A new rebellion started then. In the meanwhile, Henry had raised a new army and returned to Castile. The final battle between the two brothers took place at Montiel, at 13th March 1369, where Pedro was defeated. The night after, he was treasoned, and died in a personal combat with his half-brother.\n\nAfter the death of Pedro, Henry II fought newly against the English, to recover the lands occuped by them as the price of their help to Pedro I (Biscay). His descendants also took part at the 100 Years War at the French side: Castilian fleets defeated the English one at several battles, like in La Rochelle, in 1372 and 1419.\"\n\nhttp://es.geocities.com/endovelico2001/med/najera.html\n\nTales from Froissart\n\nedited by Steve Muhlberger, Nipissing University\n\nWhy the Prince of Wales waged war on Henry of Trastamara.\n\nIn 1366, King Pedro the Cruel of Castile was deposed by his illegitimate half-brother, Henry of Trastamara. Pedro fled to his cousin, Edward Prince of Wales (the Black Prince), who was then ruling Aquitaine under his father Edward III. Edward committed himself to Pedro's cause. Froissart shows that there was debate about the wisdom and rightness of Edward's actions.\n\nBook I, ch. 231 (Johnes, v. 1, pp. 343-46). [King Pedro is isolated in Corunna, with only a single supporter.]\n\nDon Pedro then demanded from his knight, don Fernando de Castro, complaining of his evil fortune, which was so much against him, what was best to be done. \"My lord, replied the knight, \"before you leave this place, I think it would be proper that you send some person to your cousin the prince of Wales, to know if he will receive you, and to entreat of him, for God's sake, that he would attend to your distress. He is in a manner bound to it, from the strong connection that has subsisted between the king, his father, and yours in former times. The prince of Wales is of such a noble and gallant disposition that, when he shall be informed of your misfortunes, he will certainly take compassion on you: and, if he should determine to replace you on your throne, there is no one, sir, that could oppose him, so much is he redoubted by all the world, and beloved by soldiers. You are now safe where you are; for this fortress will hold you out until some intelligence shall be brought you from Aquitaine.\"\n\n[The prince of Wales agrees to receive Pedro.]\n\nBefore the arrival of don Pedro at Bordeaux, some lords, as well English as Gascons, who had much wisdom and forethought, were of the prince's council, and by inclination as well as duty, thought themselves bound to give him loyal advice, spoke to the prince in words like the following: \"My lord, you have often heard the old proverb of 'All covet, all lose.' True it is, that you are one of the princes of this world the most enlightened, esteemed, and honoured, in possession of large domains and a handsome principality on this side of the sea, and are, thank God, at peace with every one. It is also well known, that no king, far or near, at this present moment dares anger you; such reputation have you in chivalry for valour and good fortune. You ought, therefore, in reason, to be contented with what you have got, and not seek for enemies. We must add likewise, that this don Pedro, king of Castile, who at present is driven out of his realm, is a man of great pride, very cruel, and full of bad dispositions. The kingdom of Castile has suffered many grievances at his hands: many valiant men have been beheaded and murdered, without justice or reason; so that to these wicked actions, which he ordered or consented to, he owes the loss of his kingdom.\n\n\"In addition to this he is an enemy of the church and excommunicated by our holy father. He has been long considered as a tyrant, who without any plea of justice, has always made war on his neighbours; such as the kings of Aragon and Navarre, whom he was desirous to dethrone by force. It is also commonly reported, and believed in his kingdom, and even by his own attendants, that he murdered the young lady, his wife, who was a cousin of yours, being daughter to the duke of Bourbon. Upon all these accounts, it behoves you to pause and reflect before you enter into any engagements; for what he has hitherto suffered are the chatisements of God, who orders these punishments as an example to the kings and princes of the earth, that they such never commit such like wickedness.\"\n\n...But to this loyal advice they received the following answer: \"My lords, I take it for granted and believe that you give me the best advice you are able. I must, however, inform you, that I am perfectly well acquainted with the life and conduct of don Pedro, and well know that he has committed faults without number, for which at present he suffers: but I will tell you the reasons which at this moment urge and embolden me to give him assistance. I do not think it either decent or proper that a bastard should possess a kingdom as an inheritance, nor drive out of his realm his own brother, heir to the country by lawful marriage; and no king, or king's son, ought ever to suffer it, as being of the greatest prejudice to royalty. Add to this, that my lord and father and this don Pedro have for a long time been allies, much connected together, by which we are bounden to aid and assist him, in case he should require it.\" These were the reasons that instigated the prince to assist the king of Castile in his great distress, and thus he replied to his council. No one could afterwards make the smallest change in his determination, but every day it grew firmer.\n\nChapter 233 (Johnes, v. 1, pp. 349-50). ...When it was publicly known through Spain, Aragon and France, that the intentions of the prince of Wales were to replace don Pedro in the kingdom of Castile, it was a matter of great wonder to many, and was variously talked of. Some said, the prince was making this expedition through pride and presumption; that he was jealous of the honour sir Bertrand du Guesclin had obtained, in conquering Castile in the name of king Henry, and then making him king of it. Others said, that both pity and justice moved him to assist don Pedro in recovering his inheritance; for it was highly unbecoming a bastard to hold a kingdom, or bear the name of king. Thus were many knights and squires divided in their opinions."
