        "text": "“Wine enhances friendship, conversation, health, and romance. It illuminates great and ancient human traditions of local culture and global commerce. We see winegrowing as an art—a collaboration between human beings and nature. This idea has been the cornerstone of our culture. Over time, we believe that wine, through its own mystery and magic, can delight, enrich, and inspire.”\n\nH. William Harlan – Founder\n\nRoyal Tokaji’s Essencia is wine world’s richest and rarest gem. Once only accessible\n\nto nobility, this legendary wine is fermented liquid gold that very slowly extracts\n\nfrom bins of individually hand-picked grapes raisined by botrytis.\n\nOnly the 6th vintage released since 1990, Essencia deserves its own ritual.\n\nA hand made crystal spoon allows you to savour each drop.\n\nSince the origins in 1874, each generation of Cellar Master selects in the House’s cellars the oldest\n\nand greatest eaux-de-vie (Brandy) for Louis XIII. Today, Baptiste Loiseau is selecting the house’s\n\nbest eaux-de-vie to age, some of which could be used in the Louis XIII blend in 100 years."
