Some of the best gatherings are those spent with friends celebrating special occasions.\n\nOver the weekend, I attended a birthday luncheon for designer Andy Yu. Chef and restaurateur, David Burke, prepared a wonderful menu for 10. It included \"clothesline\" bacon and pastrami salmon, popovers, dressed oysters, lobster dumplings, burrata salad, tuna and salmon tartare, halibut t-bone, and several delectable desserts. I also made a delicious lemon and Armagnac pound cake for the party. It was a wonderful feast and a most delightful celebration.\n\nEnjoy these photos."
