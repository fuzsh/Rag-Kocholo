        "text": "Avana Lilly\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\nPublished in\n\nAva’s Notebook\n\n·\n\n8 min read\n\n·\n\nMar 8, 2021\n\n--\n\nThe early life of the Infanta Catalina, a series on Queen Catherine of Aragon.\n\nWe have all heard of Catherine (Catalina) of Aragon. Wife of King Henry VIII of England. Sadly that is what she’s most remembered for by history. Being the dismissed first wife of a tyrant. Catalina was however a woman who was, so much more than just who she married. First, though let’s go over some basics on Henry. Just to refresh our memories and get him out of the way for now.\n\nCatherine, was the first of Henry’s six wives. They were married for 24 years. As I stated before, most of us are only taught that little about her. A trophy wife who was poorly treated and dismissed because she didn’t give her king a surviving son. Well and so that Henry could marry the current object of his lust and affection Anne Boleyn.\n\nWe weren’t taught about her accomplishments. That she was humanitarian, a strategist, a warrior, the first ever female ambassador in europe and one of the first English queens to support a woman's right to an education. How she was determined her daughter Mary would receive the same privileged education she had and wanted the same for all women.\n\nIn 1523 the Queen commissioned her friend and advisor, humanist Juan Luis Vives, to produce a book entitled ‘The Education of a Christian Woman’. In the book Vives advocated for education for all women, without regard of social class or ability and offered practical advice.\n\nWe were never told about her charity work or that she reigned and ruled England alone for 6 months as sovereign, whilst Henry was away war making in France. It was never mentioned that during that time she successfully fought and repelled an attack on English soil. WITHOUT a husband present to tell her how to do so.\n\nTo have done so much for her king and country. Catherine’s treatment by her husband Henry was abysmal. She wasn’t just rejected, but sent away to live the last of her days in what basically imprisonment and isolation. Mostly out of his anger that she didn’t just go quietly and make things easy for him and give him his way.\n\nHenry made sure she payed the price for this defiance and her convictions till the end of her life. She died mostly alone in a drafty castle with a bare bones staff. Having not seen her only child, her beloved Mary, since she was sent away nearly 3 years earlier. Gee what a swell guy.\n\nI would wager there had to be some fear on his part that she might plot a rebellion against her disloyal husband. He knew she was beloved by the people and that in all honesty her claim to the English throne through the Lancaster’s was as strong if not stronger than his own. Her line traced through legitimate heirs. His did not.\n\nNow that that is out of the way, let’s take a little time trip, and see how this whole thing started. First stop Madrid, Spain December, 1485.\n\nCatherine’s Birth and Lineage\n\nCatherine was born as the Infanta Catalina de Aragon y Castilla or Infanta Catalina de Trastámara y Trastámara at the Archbishop’s Palace of Alcalá de Henares near Madrid, on the night of December 16th 1485.\n\nShe was the youngest daughter and last child of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile, the Reyes Católicos (The Catholic Monarchs.) Now let’s get to Catherine’s previous mentioned links to the English throne.\n\n*Bear with me for this next part. Royal family trees can be complicated. Mostly because the lack of branching. They are more like a family sticks, not many forks in the line. Well that and they all seem to have the same name.\n\nFrom her mother’s side\n\nCatherine of Aragon> Isabella I Castile (mother)>King John II of Castile (grandfather)> Catherine of Lancaster (great grandmother) >Prince John of Gaunt (Great- Great- Grandfather) > King Edward III of England ( Great-Great-Great Grandfather). Lancaster link Number one..\n\nCatherine of Aragon > Isabella I Castile (mother) > Isabella of Portugal (Grandmother) > John the Constable of Portugal (Great Grandfather) > Phillipa of Lancaster (Great-Great-Grandmother) > Prince John of Gaunt (Great- Great- Grandfather) > King Edward III of England ( Great-Great-Great Grandfather). Lancaster link Number two.\n\nCatherine of Aragon clearly had considerable English royal heritage herself.\n\nWhew that was rough. Everyone still with me here. What a ride!\n\nArguably, Catherine’s own royal descent was more legitimate than Henry’s was. As for his line, is traced through the illegitimate offspring of King Edward III’s son John of Gaunt. Catherine was descended from Gaunt’s legitimate heirs.\n\nWhile Gaunt was a common ancestor of both Catherine and Henry. Henry’s line traced through the children of Katherine Sywnford, John’s third wife. These children however were illegitimate. Being born before their parents marriage while their mother (Sywnford) was still their fathers mistress. These offspring were later legitimized but declared ineligible for the throne.\n\nCatherine came from a long line of royals. She was born and raised to be a Queen. A noble from her lineage, looks, to her education and the way she carried herself. Can you tell I’m totally Team Catherine?\n\nThe Early Years\n\nAt the time of the Infanta’s birth Spain was in the midst of war. Her early years where spent with her parents, following their army around Spain. Catherine was described as a pleasant child, being very small and plump. She had fair skin and pink cheeks, reddish-gold hair and big blue eyes. As a grown woman it was said her beauty was irrefutable.\n\nHer parents, The Catholic Monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella, had set out to fulfill their ambition to complete the Christian Reconquista of Spain. The task of removing the last of the Moors from their kingdoms.\n\nThe Moors had been driven into their last stronghold, the Kingdom of Granada on the south coast. The Spanish army, King and Queen included, pursued them. Her mother insisted the children were brought along for the the journey, so she could monitor them and their education.\n\nIt was during these years the tiny Infanta learned the art of war, and the importance of strategy. She watched her mother and father intently. Both were strong strategist. Isabella especially.\n\nFrom her mother she learned how to plan a battle, and how to prepare for a war on all fronts. Isabella was as much a warrior and strategist as she was a Queen.\n\nIt was also from her that the Catalina would learn one of her greatest attributes. How to rally your troops, to connect with your people. As Queen this would be something Catherine would excel at.\n\nJanuary 2, 1492, Granada finally surrendered in a staged ceremony witnessed by Catherine and her siblings, who were in attendance for their parents long fought for victory. The defeat of the Moors however didn’t take the royal family off the road and into a permanent residence. Not quite yet anyway.\n\nHer parents, decided to take royalty on the road. Continuing to travel around Spain even after the war ended. They took their traveling act on tour throughout their kingdoms, administering justice, asserting royal authority and further establishing themselves in the eyes of their people.\n\nI have to image it to be a very dramatic scene as they rolled into town. A cross between a royal circus, a traveling judge and a medicine all rolled into one. Can you just imagine all the handshaking, ship christening and baby kissing that took place during those years, oh my!\n\nIt was not until a few years later, that this roving band of gypsy monarch decided to settle. They finally chose to establish a more permanent Court at the Alhambra, the shining jewel of Granada. It still stands today and is considered one of the most exquisite palaces in Europe."
