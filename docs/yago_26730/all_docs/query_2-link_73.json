        "text": "It’s a time-honored tradition for fans of English history to squabble over their opinions on various topics, but perhaps none more decidedly than Henry VIII and his six wives. With the topic in the cultural consciousness due to shows like The Tudors and The Spanish Princess as well as stage productions like Six (now on Broadway as well as the West End!), you can easily see everyone lining up behind their favorite figures of the era. It’s hard not to find yourself in one of the queens’ camps — they are all too refreshingly complex and fascinating in a world that largely ignores the presence of women.\n\nAs a result, it’s pretty hard to choose a favorite. They all have traits to admire and trials that can be lessons to us, and as such I find myself flitting between who to admire at any given time — which is exactly why shows like Six compel us not to choose at all. Having said that, my first Tudor love and the woman who introduced me to the time period at large was Catherine of Aragon. Henry’s first and longest serving queen, Catherine came from an illustrious family line, was twice married, and served her new country as a variety of roles during her time as both a Dowager Princess of Wales and as Queen of England. I’ve broken down her life into the five main reasons why she is a strong candidate for the most interesting of Henry’s queens.\n\nShe was the daughter of a fierce Queen Regnant\n\nInfanta Catalina was born in December of 1485 to Queen Isabella of Castile and King Ferdinand of Aragon. Isabella was an early pioneer of female rulership in Europe, as she maintained power over Castile in her own right after a long war over the succession. Isabella also chose her own husband, so you can imagine that growing up as the daughter of a strong queen with an immense amount of power over her own decisions would have been atypical and probably very empowering, despite the fact that Catalina would have considerably less bargaining power. As early as 1489, the 4 year old princess was already being promised away in an English treaty. As a descendant of the 14th century English nobleman John of Gaunt, son of Edward III, Catherine had a strong blood connection to England and even had the red hair often seen in English royalty. She was the perfect choice for a future queen of England, as she was from a strong European house and had, arguably, a stronger claim to the throne of England than Henry VII himself, whose claim came through an illegitimate line.\n\nShe married into the English royal family twice and spent the intermediary period as an ambassador\n\nIn 1501, just shy of her 16th birthday, Catalina made her journey to England to meet and marry Arthur, Prince of Wales. She would never see Spain or her parents again. They were married on 14th November (incidentally my birthday 495 years removed) despite never having met before. She was now Catherine of Aragon, Princess of Wales, wife and future queen.\n\nIf you know anything about Catherine, you probably know that this marriage wasn’t to last. After traveling to Ludlow Castle to set up their household in Wales, Arthur became sick and died in April of the following year. At just 16 years old, Catherine was a widow and the dowager princess, now stuck in a country waiting to find out if she would be allowed to return to Spain. After a life spent anticipating her role as the English queen, this would have been a tough pill to swallow. Her father Ferdinand and father-in-law Henry VII fought back and forth over what should be done about her dowry, making her a bargaining tool and prisoner of England. She was forced into increasingly poor accommodation and had to sell her belongings to pay for her household. Her life remained uncertain for 7 years, but she didn’t spend all her time waiting. In 1507, she became the first female ambassador to Spain.\n\nDuring these years, she became closer to the new heir, her brother by marriage Henry. Six years her junior, Henry was charming, handsome, and now due to take the throne. There was interest in forming a match between them so that the issues over the dowry would be resolved, though Henry VII was reluctant. As his death became imminent though, he permitted the match to take place, and a special dispensation was given from the Pope for Catherine and Henry (biblically considered siblings as the concept of “in-laws” did not exist) — though Catherine would argue that it was more of a precaution than a necessity, as she claimed to have never slept with Arthur.\n\nHenry, 18, and Catherine, 23, were married in 1509 and had a joint coronation as King and Queen.\n\nShe served as regent and commanded the army in Henry’s absence\n\nHenry had dreams of being a warrior king like Henry V had been, so he took the opportunity in 1513 to go on campaign to France against Louis XII. Catherine, left in England, was named regent and ruled in her husband’s name. The Scottish king, thinking the absence would make for a weaker England, decided to attack in the north. Catherine, the daughter of Isabella, had grown up amid Spain’s conflicts, so she rose admirably to the occasion and was had executive decision making power in the command of the army.\n\nThe Battle of Flodden that September left the Scottish King James IV and many of his noblemen dead. Catherine was so invigorated by their great victory that she even considered sending James’s body to her husband in France, but “our Englishmen’s hearts would not suffer it”. Instead, they sent the bloody coat he had been wearing when he died.\n\nShe fought for her crown when she realized that her marriage was in peril\n\nCatherine struggled to provide Henry with an heir. She had six pregnancies, but only one produced a child that lived into adulthood: their daughter Mary. While their initial marriage had been loving and affectionate, the strain over many failed pregnancies soured Henry’s opinion of his wife. He had several mistresses, including Bessie Blount and Mary Bolyen. But it was Anne Boleyn who caught both the eye of Henry and history in a lasting capacity. Eventually, he would decide to replace his wife with Anne, though the process of doing so would be drawn out over seven years.\n\nCatherine appeared in court before papal legates who would decide on the validity of her marriage. She knelt before Henry, making an impassioned speech in her defense. She reminded him of her loyalty to him, and stated before him, the cardinals, and the witnesses that she came to his bed a virgin and was thus his true wife. As Henry’s main argument in pursuit of the annulment was that her previous marriage to Arthur went against the Church and had led to their lack of a male heir, her pious refutation of this point was very persuasive. Combined with the mic-drop of immediately walking out after saying her piece, this testimony was historically memorable (and also pretty badass!).\n\nHenry would eventually split from Rome and create his own church in order to grant himself a divorce, but Catherine considered herself wife and queen unto death.\n\nShe fiercely loved and fought for her daughter, the first crowned Queen of England\n\nCatherine lost the battle over her husband, dying in 1536 (though strangely, her equally interesting rival would last only months longer before a quick fall from grace). Staunch Elizabethans might even say she lost the war, as Anne’s progeny would have a longer and more successful reign. But Catherine fought for her daughter’s rights as Henry’s true-born daughter, and though Mary would have many years of struggles as a bastard child, she would eventually take the throne as England’s first Queen Regnant. Her tenure was short and marred with religious dissent, but she stuck obstinately to the faith of her mother, her Spanish relations, and the England of her youth.\n\nCatherine was the daughter of a warrior queen, worked tirelessly for years in unknown circumstances to ensure her own marriage and crown, defended her adopted country from attack as regent, fought to keep her position when her marriage came under threat, and gave birth to the first Queen of England in her own right. The Queens of England and Great Britain are considered some of the country’s best: Elizabeth I, Victoria, Elizabeth II… But it started with Mary and her formidable mother Catherine.\n\nKayden Rodger is passionate about public history.
