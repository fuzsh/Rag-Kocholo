        "text": "HAMILTON, Canada -- Britain's David Millar claimed the first major title of this year's world cycling championships in Hamilton with a stunning ride in the men's individual time trial.\n\nThe Cofidis rider is renowned as one of the best in the world against the clock and showed his mettle with a 51 minutes 17.29 seconds timing over the 41.6 kilometre course.\n\nAustralia's Michael Rogers took the silver and Uwe Peschel of German claimed the bronze medal, but both were over a minute adrift.\n\nIt was Millar's day from the moment he took the lead at the first time check, extending his advantage over Commonweath Games time trial winner Rogers to one minute 25 seconds by the finish of the two-lap course.\n\nThe 26-year-old had come into the event as one of the favorites after winning the final time trial stage of this year's Tour de France and missing out on the earlier prologue stage when his chain fell off.\n\nHis triumph was capped when he caught his minute and a half man, Spain's Ididro Nozal, at just over halfway, the ONCE man having beaten Millar twice in the time trial stages of the Tour of Spain.\n\n\"'Today it was just perfect,\" said the new world champion, who admitted he had been feeling below-par in training since the Tour of Spain finished.\n\n\"I want to be the Olympic time trial champion next year,\" added Millar who will also be riding in the men's individual road race on Sunday.\n\nBritain's last gold medal winner in the men's championships was Chris Boardman, who took the inaugural time trial title in 1994.\n\nClick Here to try 4 Free Trial Issues of Time!"
