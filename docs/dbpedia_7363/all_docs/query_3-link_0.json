In 1996 at Atlanta, he did not finish the individual road race and placed 12th in the team time trial. At the World Championships he won three silver and one bronze medal in this event, and he also won six national titles.\n\nPeschel rode all well-known international tours and was awarded the Silver Bay Leaf in 1993, Germany’s highest sports award. He later became manager of a pro cycling team and organized several cycling tours with his own company Prosport Bodensee."
