        "text": "David Millar of Britain and Michael Rogers of Australia finished 1-2 in the men's elite individual time trial Thursday at the world road cycling championships in Hamilton, Ont.\n\nMillar, a specialist in the event who won the time trial final at this year's Tour de France, clocked the 41.3 kilometre race in 51 minutes and 17.29 seconds.\n\nRogers, 23, capped a breakthrough season with the silver medal in 52:42.38 while Uwe Peschel of Germany, another Tour de France entry, was third in 52:42.94.\n\n''Everything else was a prologue to this,'' punned the Scottish-born Millar, 26, in the post-race news conference. ''For some reason I have a sense of relief about winning this. I've wanted the title for a long time.''\n\nVeteran Eric Wohlberg of Levack, Ont., competed with a cast on his left wrist but buoyed by a sizeable crowd which included several family members he placed 25th in 54:46.88.\n\nWohlberg, 38, broke his wrist here at the national championships in June and a couple of small bones in the palm are healing slowly.\n\nRELATED:\n\n2003 world road cycling championships\n\nElite Men Time Trial Results\n\nTV schedule\n\n''Being injured cost me some important races over the summer,'' said Wolhberg, the eight-time defending Canadian time trial champion. ''But I've been dealing with it the best I can. This is a very difficult course. You can pre-ride it all you want but until you go full throttle you don't know how much carnage it will inflict on you.\n\n\"I suffered in a couple of spots but I sustained a pretty high workload throughout race.''\n\nCanadian national team coach Yuri Kashirin said Wohlberg did a superb job.\n\n''It's a big disadvantage with the cast,'' said Kashirin. ''He has to steer the bike through the ups and downs of the course and always push at 100 per cent. But he's a positive guy with a great attitude. For the road race he'll be ready for whatever situation may arise and give his all.''\n\nJean-Francois Laroche of Magog, Que., placed 39th. He was a late replacement for Roland Green of Victoria who withdrew due to illness.\n\n''It was certainly a great experience to race at the elite level for the first time,'' said Laroche, 23, an impressive 11th in in the under-23 road race at last year's worlds. ''It's a big step to compete against the very best in the world. My time was decent considering I only found out last Monday night I would be racing this event.''\n\nGermany leads the medal standings at the halfway point of the competition with two gold, a silver and bronze. Russia, Spain and Britain each have a gold.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Canada's women's elite road race team held a news conference to promote Saturday's race.\n\nSue Palmer-Komar competing at her 10th world road cycling championships says the 2003 Canadian team is the most talented she's ever been with.\n\n''I think this is the best chance we've ever had to win a gold medal,'' said Palmer-Komar, who has raced alongside many great Canadian riders in her career such as Clara Hughes, Alison Sydor and Linda Jackson. ''This is the first time we'll have Genevive (Jeanson) on the team and that's going to make us even stronger.''\n\nJeanson, the 22-year-old rising star from Lachine, Que., who was fifth in the time trial Wednesday, Lyne Bessette of Knowlton, Que., Canada's top-ranked international rider and local resident Palmer-Komar form the nucleus of the squad that will battle the Russian, German and Spanish superpowers.\n\nAmy Jarvis-Moore of Mississauga, Ont., Manon Jutras of Montreal and Erinne Willock of Victoria will play vital roles in keeping their teammates in contention.\n\nThe message was made clear that a full team effort will be required to get a Canadian on the podium.\n\n''The course is suited for climbers and a lot of power and fitness is required to go along the top,'' said Palmer-Komar, 36, a silver medallist at a World Cup road race earlier this year. ''Strong all around riding is required to do well here.''\n\nCanada has won two bronze medals in women's road race at the world championships. Sydor in 1991 and Jackson in 1996.\n\nCompetition continues Friday with the road races for the junior women at 9 a.m. and men's under-23 which follows at noon."
