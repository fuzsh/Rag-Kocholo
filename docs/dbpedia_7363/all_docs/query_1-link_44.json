        "text": "Michael Phelps, born in Baltimore, Maryland on June 30, 1985, is widely recognized as one of the greatest swimmers and most decorated Olympians of all time. Phelps's passion for swimming was ignited at a tender age of seven, largely inspired by his sisters who were competitive swimmers. His early exposure to the sport, coupled with his natural talent, led him to join the North Baltimore Aquatic Club where he trained under coach Bob Bowman, a relationship that would prove pivotal in shaping his career. Phelps's first taste of international competition came at the age of 15 when he competed in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, making him the youngest American male swimmer to participate in the Olympics in nearly seven decades. Although he didn't win a medal, his performance was impressive enough to hint at the bright future that lay ahead. It was the 2004 Athens Olympics that catapulted Phelps into the spotlight. He clinched six gold and two bronze medals, setting a new standard in competitive swimming. This was just the beginning of his record-breaking spree; in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Phelps won an unprecedented eight gold medals, surpassing Mark Spitz's record of seven golds in a single Olympics. Beyond his Olympic success, Phelps has also made his mark in other major swimming competitions. He has won numerous World Championship titles and broken several world records. Phelps announced his retirement after the 2012 London Olympics but made a comeback in the 2016 Rio Olympics where he added five more gold medals and one silver to his collection. His total Olympic haul stands at a staggering 28 medals, 23 of which are gold, solidifying his status as the most successful Olympian ever. Phelps's dedication towards his sport, his exceptional skill and his ability to consistently perform at the highest level have left an indelible mark on the world of swimming. He remains an inspiration for aspiring athletes across the globe.\n\nMark Andrew Spitz (born February 10, 1950) is an American former competitive swimmer and nine-time Olympic champion. He won seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, all in world record time. This was an achievement that lasted for 36 years until it was surpassed by fellow American Michael Phelps, who won eight golds at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Between 1968 and 1972, Spitz won nine Olympic golds, a silver, and a bronze, in addition to five Pan American golds, 31 Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) titles and eight National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) titles. During those years, he set 35 world records, two of which were in trials and unofficial. Swimming World Magazine named him World Swimmer of the Year in 1969, 1971, and 1972. He was the third athlete to win nine Olympic gold medals.\n\nJacqueline Joyner-Kersee (born March 3, 1962) is an American retired track and field athlete, ranked among the all-time greatest athletes in the heptathlon as well as long jump. She won three gold, one silver, and two bronze Olympic medals, in those two events at four different Olympic Games. Sports Illustrated for Women magazine voted Joyner-Kersee the Greatest Female Athlete of All-Time. She is on the Board of Directors for USA Track & Field (USATF), the national governing body of the sport.Joyner-Kersee is an active philanthropist in children's education, racial equality and women's rights. She is a founder of the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Foundation, which encourages young people in East St. Louis to pursue athletics and academics. She partnered with Comcast to create the Internet Essentials program in 2011, which costs $9.95/month for low-income Americans and offers low-cost laptops and 40 hours/month of high-speed internet service. Since its inception, it has provided internet access to 4 million Americans.Joyner-Kersee is one of the most famous athletes to have overcome severe asthma.\n\nClara Hughes, (born September 27, 1972) is a Canadian cyclist and speed skater who has won multiple Olympic medals in both sports. Hughes won two bronze in the 1996 Summer Olympics and four medals (one gold, one silver, two bronze) over the course of three Winter Olympics. She is tied with Cindy Klassen as the Canadian with the most Olympic medals, with six medals total.Hughes is one of the few athletes who have competed in both the Summer and Winter Olympic games. Hughes is one of only five people to have podium finishes in the Winter and Summer versions of the games, and is the only person ever to have won multiple medals in both. Hughes was the first Canadian woman to win a medal in road cycling at the Olympics, winning two in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.As a result of her success in multiple sports and her humanitarian efforts, Hughes was named to both the Order of Manitoba and as an Officer of the Order of Canada. She is involved with Right To Play, which is an athlete-driven international humanitarian organization that uses sports to encourage the development of youth in disadvantaged areas. After winning her gold medal in 2006, she donated $10,000 to Right to Play. Throughout her career Hughes received a number of other awards, trophies, and accolades. She was named Female Athlete of the Year by Speed Skating Canada in 2004 for long track. In 2006, she received the International Olympic Committee's Sport and Community Trophy. She was then named to the 2006 List of Most Influential Women in Sport and Physical Activity by the Canadian Association for Advancement of Women and Sport (CAAWS). In the summer of the year 2010, it was announced that she would receive a star on the Canadian Walk of Fame and on November 15, 2010, she was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nOle Einar Bjørndalen (born 27 January 1974) is a retired Norwegian professional biathlete, often referred to by the nickname, the \"King of Biathlon\". With 13 Winter Olympic Games medals, he is second on the list of multiple medalists behind Marit Bjørgen who has won 15 medals.

Bjørndalen first competed in the Olympic Games at the Lillehammer 1994 Winter Olympics, held in his home country of Norway. He obtained his first major victory on 11 January 1996 in an individual competition held in Antholz-Anterselva, Italy.
