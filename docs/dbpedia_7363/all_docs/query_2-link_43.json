Attempts to findwater had not met with success until efforts\n\nwere made by the Administration ta bore for water at great depths\n\nwith a vieiv to opening up the Corridor for development. It was necessary\n\nto bore to a depth of over 1,000 feet before the operations proved success-\n\nful. Twenty-two boreholes. yielding good supplies of potable watcr,\n\nwere the result of these efforts. It was considered that a portion of the\n\nland thiis iinproved should be made available to the Aminuis inhabitants\n\n-hence the proposed exchange.\n\n2.

At the ince~tion of the Man-\n\ndateit was necessary to reassemble Herero who wereicattered over the\n\nTerritory, and to establish them in reserves2. Among the reserves\n\nestablished for them, were Aminuis and Epukiro in the Gobabis district,\n\nwhich were set aside by Government Notice No. 122 of 1923(S.W.A.)\n\n\\Vhile the said reserves were being prepared for occupation, the prospec-\n\ntive inhabitants were first assembled at farms such as Aukeigas, and\n\nfrom there, and elsewhere in the Territory, moved to other farms,\n\nincluding Otjimboudona and Scheidthof, dong the road to the afore-\n\nmentioned reserves. The Herero who were on their way to Aminuis and\n\nEpukiro were accommodated on these farms purely temporarily, and\n\nhad to wait there until the Aminuis and Epukiio reserves were ready\n\nfor occupation. At the time when Hosea Kutako and his followers were\n\ntemporarily accommodated as aforestated ou Aukeigas and Otjimbondo-\n\nna, neither of these farms was a Native reserve. Hosea Kutako is thus\n\nincorrect in saying \". . our first Native Reserve was at Augeikas ...\" '.\n\n(Italics added.) He is also incorrect in stating that \". . .the Govemment\n\nremoved us from it in order to give the land to the Europeans\" '.In\n\nfact the said farm was not after their~d~oarture therefrom eiven out\n\nfor liiiropcnii si.ttlemcnt nt ;IIt.rciiiliiied un:illocnted land fora niimbi:r\n\nuf yens until it\\vasproclairncd nrL..;erv,:foroccupntiun I)!.Dnm:iiii 1932.\n\n'Thest:,temeiit: \"\\Ve \\ver<rlien civcn 0tiimbonduri:i from \\i,liich we\n\nwere removed in order to make room for European farmers\" ', is also\n\nincorrect.

Everything possible was done to facilitate these moves and JO\n\nminimize the loss of livestock on the \\rray. In any event, the earl!er\n\nmoves, which were over long distances. could hardly be compared with\n\nthat which would have been involved if the proposed exchange had been\n\naccepted.

The farm Hoachanas, 14,253 ha in extent, is inhabited by a\n\nnumber of Red Nation Nama and some other Natives.\n\nIn order to understand the petitioners' contentions, a short history\n\nof Hoachanas is necessar\n\nIn August I~OI, the &man Colonial Office authorized the creation\n\nof a reserve of not more than 50,000 ha., in and around Hoachanas, for\n\nthe Red Nation Nama. Nthough demarcated during 1903, the proposed\n\nreserve was apparently never proclaimed as such. This may have been\n\ndue to the outbreak of the Herero-Nama rebellion in 1904, during\n\nwhich the Red Nation Nama also rose against the German Government.\n\nOn 26 December 1905, an Imperia1 Ordinance providing for the\n\nexpropriation of Native properties in South West Africa was enacted.\n\nBy virtue of powers vested in him by this Ordinance, the German\n\nGovernor issued a Notice on 8 May 1907 confiscating, inter alia. the\n\nproperty, movable and immo\\~able,of the Red Nation Nama of Hoacha-\n\nnas *.\n\nThe German authorities thereupon proceeded to dispose of portions\n\nof the area originally demarcated for the proposed reserve.\n\nThe farm Hoachanas was thus German property which, Save for the\n\nportions disposed of by the Germans as aforestated, accmed to Respond-\n\nent in its capacity as Mandatory at the inception of the Mandate.\n\n12. A small number of the Red Nation Nama who had not taken\n\npart in the rebellion were allowed by the German Administration to\n\nremain on Hoachanas and to graze their stock on the farm on payment\n\nof grazing fees. These Nama were stiil on the farm when Respondent\n\nassumed control of the Territory.\n\nDuring the first fewyears of the Mandate. Respondent treated Hoacha-\n\nnas as a temporary reserve for its inhabitants. The Native Reserve\n\nCommission of 1921. appointed to investigate and report, inter alia, on\n\nthe setting aside of land for the Native population of the Territory,\n\nrecommended the creation of Native reserveç and, at the same time.\n\nrecommended the closure of certain small temporary reserves, including\n\nHoachanas. The Commission snggested that land at Tsesshould be made\n\navailable for the then residents of Hoachanas 2. Because of practical\n\ndifficulties at the time, this suggestion coiildnot be carried out.\n\n13. Although the Red Kation Nama who had occupied the farm\n\ndwing the last years of the German regime had been granted only\n\ntemporary occupation and grazing rights, the Administration at different\n\ntimes promised the said occupants that they could remain on the farm\n\nand exercise such rights for the rest of their lives. The Administration\n\nhas consistently honoured these promises.\n\n' Vide Die deutrche I(olonio1-Cesetrgebung.

In 1956the Administration decided that positive steps should be\n\ntakeii to end the .temporary arrangement described above, and to pro-\n\nvide the inhabitants of Hoachanas with a permanent homc. A committee\n\n\\vas nppointed to investigate the matter of acquisition of land for this\n\npurpose. This conimittee inspected and commented favourably on the\n\nfarm Itzawisis. The said farm is larger than Hoachanas, and adjoins\n\nthe Nama reserve Rerseba, as well as the Tses reserve. where a number\n\nof Nama are resi~lent. It is close to two rnilway sidings, and medical\n\nservices are more readily available, than at Hoachanas. ridam had beeii\n\nbuilt and a borehole, yielding n good water supply, had been equipped\n\nwith the necessar!l plant.

The proposed move to ItzaGsis was motivated by a desire on\n\nthe part of the Administration to provide the temporary inhabitants of\n\nHoachanas with a permanent home, which could be properly developed,\n\non land adjoining reserves permanently occupied by fellow Nama. It\n\nmust be noted that, although the small number to whom life rights of\n\ngrazingon Hoachanas had been granted, were,in the interests ofthe whole\n\ngroup, exhorted to move with the others, no attempt was ever made or\n\ncontemplated to move them against their mill.\n\n17. Kespondent denies the aiiegation that it has \"reduced\" any \"agri-\n\ncultural lands\" of the farm Hoachanas. and further denies the allegation\n\nby the petitioners that Itzawisis \\vas \"useless land which is just good for\n\nthe purpose of grave yard\" '. At the time when the move to Itzawisis\n\n\\vas proposed, the grazing and the prospects of augmeiiting the water\n\nsupply werc good. Al1 the efforts subsequently made to improve the\n\nwater supplies were, Iiowever, disappointing, and a most severe and pro-\n\nlonged period of drought followed. It was found that in sevcre drought\n\nconditions the ivater supplies on Itzawisis would be insuficient for the\n\npurpose of snstaining al1 the inhabitants of Hoachanas. The Adminis-\n\ntration lias therefore decided to defer the removal of illegal residents\n\non Hoachanas until satisfactory water supplies, sufficient also during\n\nsevere pcriods of drought, have been developed at Itzawisis, or until\n\nother arrangements have been made to provide the inhabitants of\n\nHoachanas with an area for their permanent occupation.\n\nParagraph B.4: Extract from a Communication Dated 27 November\n\n1957 rom Hosea Kutako ta the Secretary-General of the United Nations '\n\n18. The following allegations are made by Headman Hosea Kutako\n\nin this extract:\n\n(a) that he and his followers were removed from their lands to the\n\npresent Native reserves to niake room for European settlement;\n\n(b) that the said removal was effected by force. and that the Govern-\n\n' 1.p. iug.\n\n2 Videpara. 12,supra.10 SOUTH WEST AFRICA\n\nment burnt down their houses and cut offthe water supply, rendering\n\nthe people homeless;\n\n(c) that the \"average person\" (apparently intended to denote an adult\n\nmale as head of a family) in a reserve possesses 15 head of cattle\n\nand about 20 goats with which he has to maintain a family; and\n\nthat he isnot allowed to have more than three oxen;\n\n(d) that cultivation of crops for human consumption is practically\n\nnon-existent, and that the Government does not allow the water in\n\nthe reserves to be used forirrigation purposes;\n\n(e) that the inhabitants live on milk only, but that even this is not\n\nsufficientto maintain a family because cream has to be sold to obtain\n\nmoney with uihich to buy clothing;\n\n.., that water is so scarce in the reserves that inanv ~e,.leli.e six to\n\nse\\.cii i1iilc.îa\\i.n!.from rlie w;iter, \\i.liiclitlic)'Iiavc to transport. ;and\n\n\\i.hich issometiinej inudilv and ~iiidrinkable '.\n\n19. Kespondent denies that the Herero were removed to the present\n\nXative reserves from land which belonged to them. Amongst the con-\n\nsequences of the :rgo4-1go7rebellion was the confiscatioii of al1Herero\n\nproperty north of the Tropic of Capricorn Z.They were further pio-\n\nhibited from keeping large stock. At the inception of the Mandate the\n\nHerero therefore liad no lands of their own, and it was entirely to their\n\nadvantage that they were reassembled and giveii new homes in reserves\n\nset aside for them.\n\n20. Respondent denies tliat the rcmoval of the Herero to the reserves\n\nset aside for them was accoinplished by force. Respondent further\n\ndenies that their ivater supplies were cut off, or that their Iiouses were\n\nbumt doivn in order to effect such removal. On one occasion a firm\n\nwaming of forcib!e expulsioii was necessary in respect of a few dissen-\n\ntients aniongst a groiip that had been housed temporarily on a farm\n\ncalled Okatumba. which was not a Native reserve; but the warniiig\n\nserved its purpose, and actual force was not required. The group was\n\nfirst accommodated on Okatumba in 1916. In 1924 they were required\n\nto move to the Epukiro Reserve, which had meanwhile been opened up\n\nfor them. They tiad previously, at Respondent's invitation, inspected\n\nEpukiro aiid had expressed complete satisfaction. When the time for\n\nmoving came, the majority complied without difficulty, but a dissentient\n\nrninority of 108 remained, raising a complaint about the opening up of\n\nwater at Epukiro. Upon being satisfied that the excuse was not genuine.\n\nthe Administrator cansed the aforesaid warning to be issued. A full\n\naccount of the in(:ident was given in Respondent's annual report to the\n\nCouncil of the League in 1924 3.\n\n21. The allegations by Headman Hosea Kutako as to the number of\n\nlivestock owned I>yXatives at the time when his petition \\vas drafted,\n\nare grossly incorrect. It is not certain whether the alleged figures refer\n\nto the stock in al1 the Native reserves in the Police Zone, or whether\n\nthe figures refer to the Aminuis lieserve alone, as the words \"in the\n\nreseri,e\" (singular) are used, whilst the petition as a whole purports to\n\n' 1, p.1%.\n\n-rial.de-para.

Apart from a substantial number of stock sold out of\n\nhand, the organized stock sales in the reserves yielded 1q54.866\n\n(f;227,433)during 1956 and K500.036 (&250.018)during 1957. The sale\n\nof cream by the inhabitants of the reserves yielded K88.984 (L44.492)\n\nduring the financial year 1956-1957 '.\n\nIf the figures given by Headman Kutako were, however, intended to\n\nrelate to the position wlthin the Aminuis Reserve only, they were also\n\ngrossly incorrect. During 1956 there were 30,618 head of large stock and\n\n1,678 head of small stock, owned by approximately 700 stock owners\n\nwithin the Reserve, which then had a total population of approximately\n\n2,800-i.e., 44 head of large stock and 2 head of small stock per owner.\n\nThe number of large stock increased to 37,430 in 1959, and to 47,048 in\n\n1963. The number of small stock in 1959 and 1962 were 10,490 and\n\n25,367. During the first half of 1963 two organized stock sales in the\n\nreserve yielded Rroo,591 (&50,29510s.).\n\n22. With regard to thc alieged restriction on the number of oxen\n\nallowed. the position is as follows: The government notices relevant\n\nto the pFeservation of soi1and the control of stock in reserves contain\n\nno provisions which restrict the number of oxen which a stock-owner\n\nmay owii or keep in a reserve. The regulations promulgated by Govem-\n\nment Notice Xo. 68 of 1924 (S.W.A.) provide that a stock-owner may\n\nnot, without the Administrator's permission. keep more than roo head\n\nof large stock and 300 head of small stock in a reserve. These restrictions\n\nwere introduced to protect tlie ioterests of al1stock-owners in reserves.\n\nWithout such a measure of control overstocking would become a serious\n\nproblcm, and the iiiterests of the smaller stock-owners could be subjected\n\nto those of the richer ones.\n\n23. With regard to the allegation that \"thcpeople live on milk only\" ',\n\nRespondent States that the Herero people have traditionally and always\n\nlived on a diel consisting principally of milk. And, as to the statement\n\n\"... even the milk is not sufficient to maintain a family because they\n\nhave t? sel1 cream to get money with which to buy clothing\" '.the\n\nsuggestion of starvation due to an insufficiency of milk is unfounded.\n\nThe stock figues and income statistics qiioted above are self-explana-\n\ntory. Quite apart from income derived from the sale of stock and cream,\n\nmany inhabitants of the reserves also derive income from wages as\n\nemployees ontside the reserves.\n\n24.

In the absence of ipecific allegations explaining in which way\n\nconditions of life are alleaed to be scandalous. Res~onAent is not in a\n\nposition to deal specificall$ witli the charge made.\n\nRespondent noies, however, that the petitioii from which only the\n\nabove extract is quoted by Applicants, contains a number of statements\n\nregarding the alleged conditions of iife of Ovambo workers, whicli\n\nstatements Applicants-presumably because they themselves can attach\n\nno credence thereto-have chosen not to include in their charges. So,\n\nfor example, the petitioner refers to an alleged indiscriminate and\n\nwholesale murder of Ovambo workers in the following terms:\n\n\"The Ovambo farm boys were decreased by their farm employers\n\nby shootings Some Ovambo victims were forced to dig their own\n\ngraves; man). of Ovambo corpses were burned to ashes by farmers\n\nand thus were concealed; Ovambo corpses were thrown in deep dry\n\nwells; some Clvambo corpses were hiddeii uiider big heaps of cattle\n\nmanures.

COUNTER-MEMORIAL OF SOUTH AFRICA 13\n\nscandai\".ns of life for Ovambo Native labour in South West Africa are a\n\n28. Respondent denies that any system of forced labour exists in\n\nthe Territory. If recruits accept work with certain mining conceriis,\n\nthey forthwith enter into contracts with their prospective employers.\n\nIn the case of otlier work, e.g., ori farms or as domestic servants in\n\nurban areas, it is often impossible to specify the particular employer at\n\nthe time when the prospective employee is recruited in Ovambolaiid.\n\nIn such cases the recruits enter into preliminary agreements with the\n\nrecmiting agency, Xew S.W.A.N.L.A.. to accept work of an agreed type\n\nwith employers to whom they may be allocated, at iiot less tliaiiri\n\nspecified wage. Before leaving for Grootfontein, the nearest railhead to\n\nOvamboland, the preliminary agreement is fully explained to the recruit\n\nbv the Bantu Affairs Commissioneror his assistaiit. niid anv recruit who\n\nopportuiiity of rcfusiiig to t~ke such \\r,ork.li tl,e sr& oilerid, lins cvL.ry\n\n~\\ft<:r;irriv;il nt Cri)otfuiir~iii. the récruiti ii.11not::tlre.itli.

Contracts between the employees and the employers are then\n\ncompleted, if the former agree. The terms of the contracts are explained\n\nto the recmits, and al1contracts are attested by the Uantu Affairs Com-\n\nmissioner or his assistant, who inquires from the employee whether\n\nhe is satisfied with the agreement. The recmit has every opportunity\n\nofrefusing to assent to the said contract.\n\ncruits eventually \"sneak away\", Respondent says that only a sinall-\n\npercentage of recruits leave their employers hefore the expiration of\n\ntheir contracts. So, e.g., out of :itotal ' of 35.oG3extra-territorial :iiid\n\nnorthern Natives employed in the Police Zone on contract during 1959,\n\n1.143 (Le., approximately 3 per cent.) left their employment before the\n\nexpiration of their contracts and without such contracts having been\n\ncancelled. The petitioner's allegation in this regard is a gross exaggera-\n\ntion.\n\nParagraph B.6: Extract from a Communication Dated 3 August 1957\n\nfrom Mr. Toivo Herman Ja Toivo and Eighty Other Ovambo, Io the\n\nChairman of the Trusteeship Council\n\n30. This paragraph also deals with the system of labour recmitment,\n\nwhich was the subject of the preceding paragraph. With regard to the\n\nfirst sentence of the extract here in issue. Respondent denies that the\n\ncontract system is \"compulsory\". as is aiieged. Contracts are entered\n\ninto voluntarily, asexplained in paragraph 28 above.\n\n31.With regard to the \"demand\" that evcry young man should be\n\nfree to choose and serve his master as long as they understnnd each\n\nother. Respondent States that, as far as choice of employer is concerned,\n\nPolice Zonein ig~g.i.e.including those previously ernployed whaîe contracts hadhe\n\nbeen extended.*4 SOUTH WEST AFRICA\n\na maximum effort is made by the recruiting organization to place a\n\nprospective employee in employment of his choice. It is in the interests\n\nalso of the organiz;ition to do so. Recmits are not assigned to employers\n\nwhom they do not wish to serve. Al1Native labour contracts must be\n\niii writing. and before a contract is coiicluded tlie namc of the employer\n\nis disclosed to the prospective cmployee, and the terms of the contract\n\nare fuiiy esplaincc1 to him by the Bantu Affairs Conimissioner or his\n\nassistant. Any recmit may refuse to enter into a contract.\n\n32. As far as tlie duration of service is coiicemed, the special cir-\n\ncumstaiiccs müke it impossible to permit Natives an unfettered discre-\n\ntion. In thc first place, they are allowed into the Police Zone only for\n\na saecified oeriod. viz.. the contract aeriod. which mav not exceed a\n\nniakimum period.'fised'in consultation with the northerh tribal author-\n\nities been fixed at one veap. In the case of fürm labour there is ~rovision\n\nfor an alternative 18months contract, and al1contracts may be êxtended\n\nbv mutual consent for furtlier i~criodsof six months each UD to a total of\n\n24 months in the case of mariied, and 30 months in tlie &se of single,\n\nmen. In the second place, tmployers making use of contract labour of\n\nnorthern and extra-territorial Katives are obliged to provide the latter\n\nwith freerail and Ilus facilities from the place of recmitment to the place\n\nof employmcnt and, on the termination or cancellation of the contract,\n\nwith similar faciliries, frec of charge, to the place of recmitment. Em-\n\nployer~would not be prepared toundertake tliis responsibility if employ-\n\nees were allowed an unfettcred discretion to terminate their contracts at\n\nwill. Furthermorc, the task of ensuring that al1recniits are returned t?\n\ntheir homes after espiry of the contract period, as demancled by their\n\ntribal authorities. would beconie impossible if cmployces were permitted\n\nto chanc..their eino.ov.eiit at willwithin their coiitract period.

The \"demand\" that inarried wonieii inust be alloive<lto accom-\n\npaiiy their husbarids to their place of employment and that unmarried\n\nwomen must he permitted to enter the Police Zoiie to look for work,\n\nconflicts with the policy of the tribal authorities in the iiorthern areas.\n\nA matrilineal system is in operation in those territories, and the tribal\n\nauthorities are particularly concerned that their women should remain\n\nin their homelands to prevent detribalization. Furthermore, by remain-\n\ning at home, the women are able to carry on the traditional farming\n\nactivities and to provide for their families during the absence of their\n\nhusbands. Consequently, at the request of the northern tribal authori-\n\nties, women arc not permitted to accompany their husbands who take\n\niip employmerit in the Police Zone. For the same reason unmarried\n\nwomen are not permitted to seek cmployment in the Police Zone.\n\n34. The \"demaiids\" of tlie petitioners are, in the circumstances, either\n\nbased on incorrect facts, or otherwise represent a minority view which\n\nis in conflict with the specific policy of the tribal authorities in the\n\nnorthern areas.

In reply to the allegation set out in(a) above, Respondent admits\n\ntliat the franchise has been granted to Europeans who are 18 years old.\n\nliespondent further admits tliat the participation of tlie Natives in\n\nthe affaus of the Territory does not include the right of franchise as far\n\nas the election of representatives forthe Legislative Assembly or for the\n\nSouth African Parliament is concerned. This matter is dealt with else-\n\nwliere in this Counter-Memorial3 and need not be discussed here agaiii.\n\n40. Respondeiit does not fully understand the statements referred to\n\nin paragraph 38 (6) above. The allegatioii certainly canriot refer to any\n\ndistinction made in the Territory as a whole betweeii Natives who were\n\nadults during the German regime, on the one hand, and al1otlier Xatives,\n\non tlie other. Xo !suchdistinction exists. The allegation must have been\n\nintended by the Rev. Markus Kooper to refer to a iiiiique situation\n\nwhich obtains only in Hoachaiias. As an act of goodwill, officialsof the\n\nAdministration g;ive an undertaking to the inhabitants of Hoachanas\n\nwho had been given grazing rights on that property during the Ge~maii\n\nregime that they would, during their lifetime, be permitted to reside on\n\nHoachanas and exercise grazing rights thereon '.\n\nDuring consult:itions with the inhabitants of Hoachaiias concerniiig\n\ntheir proposed move to Itzawisis 5 one meeting was held spccifically for\n\nthe purpose of obtaining the views of those residents to whom the afore-\n\nmentioned undertaking had beeii given.

The reason for\n\nspecial consultation of the group to which the above undertaking had\n\nbeen given, was at al1times obvious.\n\n41. Respondent denies that the menibers of the indigenous popula-\n\ntion of the Territory, or any section thereof, are regarded as \"non-\n\noriginals\" or \"strangers\", or that any voice in the country of their birth\n\nis refused tliem. The existing systems under which non-Whites partici-\n\npate in the government of their own people are described elsewhere\n\nin this Counter-Memorial ',and need not be dealt with here agriin.\n\n42.

Inasmuch as the extract here in issue gives no particulars relating\n\nto the complaint of low wages, and since Applicants themselves do not\n\ncornplain of low nages in their Memorials, Respondent does not propose\n\nto deal with the petitioners' vague and general allegation in this regard,\n\nSaveto say that. 1.0the best of Respondent's knowledge. wages in South\n\nWest Africa compare favourably with those paid in other parts of Africa.\n\nParagraph C.4: Extract from a Communication Dated 20 Juoe 1958from\n\nJohannes Dausab et al. to the Secretary-General '\n\n48.

Regarding the allegations set forth in sub-paragraphs (a) and\n\n(d) above, Kespondent respectfully refers to its reply to similar allegü-\n\ntions by the Applicants in Chapter Vof the Mernorials '.\n\n50. Respondent does not propose to deal with the vague and general\n\nallegations as set forth in sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 48 above.\n\nTheyare baseless, and are denied.\n\n51.With regard to the allegation set out in paragraph 48 (c)above,\n\nRespondent states that the offices referred to by the petitioners were\n\ncreated and are maintained for the,specific purpose of serving the best\n\ninterests of the indigenous population. The progress of the indigenous\n\npopulation has to no small degree been facilitated by the efforts of the\n\nCliief Xative Comniissioner, the \\Velfare Officers and Location Super-\n\nintendents. On the whole the relations between these officials and the\n\ngroups served by them are of the most cordial, and the fact that the\n\npetitioners in this instance speak otherwise, indicates that they are\n\neither voicing a mioority view or acting in bad faith, with ulterior\n\npolitical motives.

The petitioners' complaints concern the\n\nsystem of government of the said community through an advisory\n\nboard. This system is alleged to depart from the \"patriarchal law and\n\nfundamental principles\" of the community, which may. so it is feared.\n\njeopmdize the community's future existence and \"right of self-determi-\n\nnation\".\n\n53.

After the Mandate had'come into existeiice, the Administrator\n\nof South West Africa, acting on behalf of the Union Government,\n\ncommenced negotiations with the Rehoboth Basters which, in 1923,\n\nculminated in an Agreement betwecn Respondent and the elected Kaad\n\nof the community, on behalf of the Basters '.\n\nIn terms of the Agreement the South African Government acknow-\n\nledge the right and title of the liehoboth community to the Rehoboth\n\nGebiet,and granted to the commuiiity the right of local self-government\n\naccording to the laws of the community, and subject to the provisions\n\nof the Agreement itself. It was agreed that certain laws of South West\n\nAfrica would be applied to the Gebietand that the Adrninistrator would\n\nhave the right to apply other laws from time to time. after consultation\n\nwith the Raad of the community. In the event of a dispute between the\n\nAdministrator and the Raad in relation to any inatter arising from the\n\nAgreement, the Raadwould have the right to petition the South African\n\nParliament itself '.\n\n56. Soon after the conclusion of the Agreement it became evident\n\nthat the majority of the Burgherswere dissatisfied,demanding nothing\n\nlessthan full independence for the Gebiet.The result was a state of near\n\nchaos, and in December 1924 the Administrator was forced to intervene.\n\nHe suspended the powers, functions and duties of the Kafitein(Capta!n),\n\nVolksraad (Parliament), judges and magistrates of the community,\n\nvesting them in the magistrate of Rehoboth. who was to exercise such\n\npowers. functions and duties in accordance with the laws of the com-\n\nmunity then in force, and in conformity with the provisions of the\n\nAgreement of 1gz:j.It was hoped that by this action law and order would\n\nbe restored in the Gebiet.Unrest continued, however, and in April 1925\n\nthe Administrator was forced to declare martial law to avert imminent\n\ncivil war. In contravention of martial law a number of Basters and\n\nHerern took up ms, with the result that troops were despatched to\n\nRehoboth. The irisurgents surrendered without a shot being fired. A\n\nnumber of insurgents were arrested and charged, but those who\n\nwere convicted were almost immediately thereafter released under an\n\namnesty proclaimed by Proclamation No. II of 1925 (S.W.A.) 5.\n\nIbid., para89.

In 1928an Advisory Board of six Baster members was constituted\n\nto advise the magistrate of Rehoboth in his administration of the affairs\n\nof theGebiet1.Three members of the Board were elected by the B~<rglsrs\n\nof Rehoboth, and three werenominated by the Administrator. Since 1935\n\nal1six members of the Board have been elected by the Burghersof Reho-\n\nboth.\n\nThe Board, although de jure purely an advisory body, plays an im-\n\nor tant role in the administration of the Gebiet. Even the ~etitioner\n\nhrr. Jacobus Beukes commented as follows on the ~oard's' function\n\non another occasion: \"... whatever the Council (Advisory Board)\n\ndecides, whether good or bad, is final'.\"\n\nIn practice the Board virtually exercisesfull self-governing powers in\n\nall interna1 affairs, subject only to the laws of the land that have been\n\napplied to the Gebiet The function of the magistrate, in practice, is to\n\nguide the Board as far as heis able.\n\n58. In view of the role which the Board in fact plays in the adminis-\n\ntration of the Gebiet,extended powers of local self-government for the\n\nKehoboth community have been under consideration for a nnmber of\n\nyears. Inasmuch as requests had from timeto thne been made by different\n\nAdvisory Boards for the restoration of the 1923 Agreement, it was\n\ndecided by Respondent that, as a first step towards the grant of in-\n\ncreased powers of self-government, the Agreement of 1923 should be\n\nrestored toits original fieldofapplication. It must be noted that although\n\ncertain provisions of the Agreement were suspended by Proclamation\n\nNo. 31 of 1924(S.W.A.) ',the Agreement itself was never cancelled.\n\nMost ofits provisions arestillin force.\n\n59. On 13 May 1961 the Administrator informed the Board that the\n\nAgreement of 1923 could be restored, if the Community so desired, and\n\nthat thereafter there would be no objection to an amendment of the\n\nAgreement. The assurance was further given that the Administration\n\nwould continue to assist the community in al1spheres.\n\nThe Board decided that the burghersof Rehoboth should be requested\n\nto make their own decisions about the Agreement. It was thereupon\n\ndecided that the magistrate, together with the members of the Board,\n\nwould conduct a series of meetings throughout the Gebiet to explain\n\nthe whole situation to the burgl~ers.Fifteen meetings were thereafter\n\nheld, during which it transpired that the majority of the burghers,re-\n\ngarded restoration of the 1923 Agreement with a measure of suspicion,\n\npreferring to postpone the matter to draft a new agreement. The bur-\n\ngherswere specifically informed that the choice was entirely their own:\n\nif they chose restoration of the 1923 Agreement. it would be regarded\n\nas a great step in the direction of further development; on the other\n\nhand, ifthey rejected the proposa1for restoration of the 1923Agreement.\n\nthey could approach the Administration witli alternative suggestions.\n\nOn IO June 1961the community, by an ovenvhelming vote. rejected the\n\n' PVOCN. o. 9of1928 (S.W.A.), iThe LotusofSouthWerf Africn 1928,pp. 38-52.\n\nWhose petition iç the firofthe two here under consideration.\n\nStntement dated 26Mar. 1957,inG.A.,O.K..Twelfth SessSup.

In fact.\n\nthe old location liad been found unsatisfactory for a long time, and\n\nplans to improve or to remove it had been discussed repeatedly. It was\n\nfelt that an attempt to improve the existing location would not be good\n\nenough, and that a completely new township with modern iacilities\n\nshould be plannecl. The considerations underlying this view were the\n\nfollowing:\n\n(a) The intention was to establish a mode1 township, designed on\n\nmodem lines, and providing for arespectable modeoflifeand healthy\n\nliving conditions.The new houses were to be larger thau those in the\n\nold location; they were to be built on larger plots, and the snbdivi-\n\nsion of plots, or building of more than one house on one plot, as\n\nhad heen thepractice in the old location, was not to be allowed.\n\nAs faras space was concemed, replanning of a new township on\n\nthe site of th<:old location was impossible. The old site would have\n\naccommodated only a quarter of the inhabitants after replanning,\n\nand the considernbly larger area needed for the proper planning of\n\nthe new township, with sufficient ground for wider streets, schools,\n\nplaying fields, parks, etc., did not exist there. Furthermore, there\n\nwould have been rio possibility of satisfactory and economic\n\nfuture expansion of the township.\n\n(b) A scheme of providing new housing for the Native inhabitants of\n\nbuilt one bv .one,as and when old huis were demolished.

A large\n\nnumber of f:unilies would have been honieless for considerable\n\nperiods if a new housing scheme were to have been undertaken on\n\nthe site ofth,: old location.\n\n(c) The Native P.dvisory Board, the body representing the inhabitants\n\nof the location, were duly consulted, and there was no doubt that\n\nthe majority of the location residents preferred the establishment\n\nof anew towriship. In ~qgj, for example, the Board presented to the\n\nMinister of Native Affairs an address in which he was asked to use\n\nhis influence with the Municipal Council to expedite the removal to\n\na new site.\n\nIn 1954 the Executive Committee decided to grant the Munici-\n\npality of Windhoek a loan of R2.500.000 (~r,zjo,ooo) for the\n\nestablishment of a new Xative township.\n\n68. The Municipal Council considered various sites for the new town-\n\nship,and after the site at Katutura had been chosen as the most suitable\n\nin al1respects, the Native Advisory Board was again consulted, and it\n\nagreed to the site chosen.\n\nIt may be added, furthermore, that neither Hosea Kutako! nor an).\n\n0th spokesmen of the location residents, had at any time during which\n\nthe matter was iunder consideration, and when a decision could still\n\nhave been revoksd, requested the authorities to build houses at the\n\nold site instead or'erect<nga new township.

More particularly, there is no provision\n\nthat \"the whole area of the location must be fenced\", nor that there\n\nmust be \"only one gate leading to the town\" '. In fact, at no time has\n\nKatutura been fenced in. It is, however, necessary to erect stock-proof\n\nfencing along certain stretches of the boundaries, for example, along a\n\nboundary which is contiguous to a highway, or along the boundaries of\n\nadjoining farms. Furthermore, there are no entrance gates to Katutura.\n\n71. The next group of allegations is that whenever a person leaves\n\nor enters the location he or she must be searched by a policeman at the\n\nproduced, which permit must specify reasons for leaving the location be\n\nor entering it.

It is correct that in the Katutura township at Windhoek ethnic\n\ngrouping is maintained as far as ispracti.abl..Such ethnic grouping is in\n\naccordance with the traditions O the indigenous population, and ex-\n\nperience has shown that the vast majority of the non-White people\n\nprefer to live in an ethnicdy grouped community. So, for example,\n\nethnic grouping developed in the old location at Windhoek as a result of\n\npersona1 choice of the inhabitants, and without the authorities in any\n\ngrouping within locations Esis an important factor in the elimination of\n\ngroup friction and that it facilitates constructive participation by the\n\ninhabitants in the administration of their townships.\n\nThere is, however, absolute freedom of movement between ethnic\n\ngroups within a location, and the allegation: \"When a person wishes to\n\ngo from the Ovambo to the Hererosection he must apply for a permit and\n\nstate the purpose of his visit\" ' is without foundation.\n\n74.
