        "text": "Australia's Michael Rogers was awarded the 2003 time trial world title by the International Cycling Union (UCI) after British rider David Millar decided not to appeal his drug-related disqualification.\n\n\"The final classification is modified with immediate effect,\" UCI said in a statement.\n\n\"The title of world champion as well as the gold medal and the rainbow jersey of this discipline are attributed to the Australian rider Michael Rogers.\"\n\nThe silver and bronze medals go to German riders Uwe Peschel and Michael Rich, respectively.\n\nMillar was given a two-year suspension by his national cycling federation, after telling a French judge he had used EPO.\n\nHe voluntarily withdrew from the British Olympic team and was barred from this summer's Tour de France.\n\nFrench police raided Millar's home in Biarritz, France, in June as part of a doping investigation into his pro team, Cofidis, and found two used syringes.\n\nMillar, 27, told a French judge he used the banned blood-boosting hormone EPO on three separate occasions, once in 2001 and twice in 2003.\n\nHe said the pair of syringes had contained the EPO he used before winning the world championship in Hamilton, adding he kept the syringes as a reminder of how desperate he had become.\n\nHowever, he had turned his back on doping at the start of this year, Millar said.\n\nMillar will be required to hand over the medal and the jersey to UCI, which in turn will award the trophies to Rogers.\n\nMillar could have opted to take his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\n\nEPO, or erythropoietin, is a hormone naturally produced by the body but available as a genetically engineered product.\n\nEPO artificially increases the level of red blood cells and enhances aerobic and endurance capacity."
