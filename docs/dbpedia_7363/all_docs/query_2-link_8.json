        "text": "ZURICH, Switzerland -- Swiss cyclist Oscar Camenzind, who retired after testing positive for the banned drug EPO before the Athens Games, has been formally banned from the sport for two years, the Swiss Olympic Association has announced.\n\nThe scandal around the 1998 world road race champion came to a head just before last month's Olympics, prompting the Swiss cyclist to retire from the sport before authorities could suspend him from competition.\n\nThe ex-Phonak team member had tested positive for the blood-boosting drug erythropoietin (EPO).\n\nUnder Swiss rules, anyone who tests positive is banned with immediate effect, even before the result of a second sample.\n\nThe Swiss Olympic Association said Camenzind was suspended as of August 19 and would be fined 10,000 Swiss francs ($7,868).\n\nHe was ordered to pay costs.\n\nRogers named champion\n\nAustralian Michael Rogers has been named world time-trial champion in place of David Millar, after the Briton's disqualification for a positive dope test.\n\nCycling's ruling body (UCI) said Millar had decided not to contest his disqualification from the 2003 world championships after he later admitted taking doping products at the time of his victory at the event in Canada.\n\n\"The title of world champion as well as the gold medal and the rainbow jersey of this discipline are attributed to the Australian rider Michael Rogers,\" a UCI statement said.\n\nThe silver medal goes now to Uwe Peschel and the bronze to another German, Michael Rich.\n\nMillar was placed under official judicial inquiry by a French magistrate in July after empty syringes which had contained EPO were found by police in his home in Biarritz.\n\nHe was banned from July's Tour de France and sacked by his team, Cofidis.\n\nClick Here to try 4 Free Trial Issues of Time!"
