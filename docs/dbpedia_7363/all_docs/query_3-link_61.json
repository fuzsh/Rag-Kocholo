        "text": "Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics (PCCP) is a journal for high quality research in physical chemistry, chemical physics and biophysical chemistry. As PCCP is co-owned by 19 chemistry, physical chemistry and physics societies from around the world, you can reach a wider readership when you publish in this journal. Each Owner Society is committed to delivering a trusted and valuable experience to the scientific community.\n\nThis year, we’re celebrating the 25th volume of PCCP. A lot has changed since our first issue – PCCP was launched by four international chemistry and physical chemistry societies, but over the years, another 15 learned societies joined this journal. In 2023, our community is now represented by an internationally renowned editorial board, comprising of 14 associate editors carefully selected by our 19 Owner Societies. With their support, we have published 45,000 articles from over 120 countries to date.\n\nA quick look at the difference from 1999 to 2023:\n\n“I was thrilled to be involved in the launch of PCCP and to be working in partnership with the four founding societies and their member communities. At launch, there was much excitement for PCCP to become the one umbrella journal for the publication of the best research in all fields within physical chemistry and chemical physics. From the very first issue, PCCP received amazing support from authors, reviewers and readers, and I am proud to have had a role in helping the community to establish this unique and multidisciplinary journal.”\n\nSusan Weatherby, Launch Editor for PCCP in 1999\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nPCCP has always been a home for work from across the breadth of physical chemistry, chemical physics and biophysical chemistry, in both experimental and theoretical fields. Based on our experience with computational and quantum chemistry, PCCP now warmly welcomes research in the areas of quantum computing, machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence.\n\nYou can now read and publish tutorial reviews in PCCP. Learn about the first PCCP tutorial review, written by 2023 Tilden Prize winner Julie MacPherson and colleagues. If you have a great idea for a tutorial review, please visit our homepage for further information.\n\nWe have recently published some exceptional themed collections, and we have open calls for new themed collections on topics from “Molecular dynamics in the gas phase” through to “Physical chemistry of the energy transition”.\n\nIn 2024, we invite you to join us for the PCCP 25th anniversary symposium in Amsterdam on 1–2 May. The programme features internationally renowned speakers from our editorial and advisory boards, as well as the PCCP Owner Societies. It will be a chance for you to network with the community, be part of some exciting discussions, and celebrate 25 years of PCCP.\n\nDiscover more about PCCP in our video and explore our latest issue.\n\nWe are delighted to announce that the Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics (PCCP) themed issue Stability and properties of new-generation metal and metal-oxide clusters down to subnanometer scale is now online and free to access until the end of September 2023.\n\nThis collection brings together theory, fundamental-oriented research in vacuum and superfluid helium droplets, including metal clusters of astrochemical relevance, and the most applied-oriented research of metal and metal oxide clusters in solution, covering subnano- and nano-meter ranges.\n\nGuest Edited by María Pilar de Lara-Castells, Cristina Puzzarini, Stefan Vajda, M.

Please get in touch if you have any questions about this themed collection or PCCP.\n\nWe are delighted to announce that the Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics (PCCP) themed issue Recent Advances in Modelling Core-Electron Spectroscopy is now online and free to access until the end of July 2023.\n\nCore electron spectra have been extremely useful probes of the local atomic and electronic structure and dynamics of materials, due to their local, element-specific nature. These phenomena include X-ray photoemission (XPS), X-ray absorption (XAS), X-ray emission (XES), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). The theoretical treatment of these processes requires diverse modelling techniques for excited states, dynamic response, and thermodynamic behavior which are material-specific and capture the effects of many-electron interactions and inelastic processes. In recent years, there has been a rapid development of these approaches which have become highly quantitative, driven in part by complementary advances in computation and experimental precision.\n\nGuest edited by John J. Rehr, David Prendergast and Johannes Lischner, this collection showcases research in all aspects of the theory and computational techniques relevant to core-electron spectroscopy.\n\nRead the full issue online\n\nIt includes:\n\nEditorial\n\nRecent advances in modelling core-electron spectroscopy\n\nJohn J.
