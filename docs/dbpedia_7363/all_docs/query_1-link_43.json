        "text": "David Millar looked set to lose his world time-trial title after he allegedly admitted he used banned drugs when he won the championship in Canada last October.\n\nIf Millar is stripped of his gold medal then Australian Michael Rogers, runner-up in 2003, would take the title.\n\nUwe Peschel would move from bronze to silver and fellow German Michael Rich would move from fourth to bronze.\n\nThe 27-year-old Scot reportedly made the confession to police investigating his Cofidis team, according to a transcript obtained by sports daily l'Equipe.\n\nHis lawyer has already said the rider admitted to police he had used the banned blood booster erythropoietin (EPO) in 2001 and 2003.\n\n\"Under normal cvircumstance we cannot use confidential testimony from a police enquiry,\" an International Cycling Union official told AFP.\n\n\"But if Millar confirms what he said, either publicly or at a court hearing, it's not necessary to wait for a verdict in the proceedings.\"\n\nHowever, it could be some time before any action is taken as the UCI official said British cycling's governing body would first have to open an investigation.\n\nThere have been cases of riders being banned or stripped of titles without a positive drugs test.\n\nJerome Chiotti of France was stripped of his 1996 world Mountain Bike title after he admitted to doping.\n\nMillar was placed under judicial investigation for illegal possession of toxic products after police found empty capsules of Eprex, a commonly used form of EPO, in his flat in Biarritz.\n\n\"I'd dreamed of becoming world champion and I'd achieved it but I cheated,\" he allegedly told police.\n\nHe said he had kept the empty capseules to remind him of what he had done.\n\n\"I wasn't proud of using drugs, I wasn't happy. I'd become a prisoner of the person I'd become.\"\n\nHe said he had found it difficult living up to expectations when he joined Cofidis in 1997 but his team management never tried to persuade him to use drugs.\n\nHe claims it was his former Cofidis team-mate Massililiano Lelli of Italy and Euskaltel team doctor Jesus Losa, who supplied him with EPO when he failed to cope with the demands of life on the road.\n\nBut he admitted his earnings had risen to 800,000 euros ($1.36 million) a year after his drug-fuelled successes.\n\nCofidis have been under investigation since seven of its riders were charged with doping offences.\n\nThey have all left or been sacked by the team since.\n\nAFP"
