        "text": "Klaus Ampler started his succesful career in the late 1950s. His sporting highlight was winning the Internationale Friedensfahrt in 1963, for which he was chosen GDR Sportsman of the Year. In 1968 Ampler participated in the Olympic Games in the 100 kilometer team time trial, finishing 13th, as Axel Peschel unfortunately had a tire defect after 8 kilometers and therefore weakened the team.\n\nKlaus Ampler ended his career in 1970 and afterwards coached the GDR-road team, who won Olympic gold in 1980, but also coached his son, Uwe Ampler, who became Olympic Champion in the same event in 1988, and who was a multiple GDR champion in road and track cycling. He also worked as a sports reporter and ran a wholesale bicycle shop, but went bankrupt in 1996.\n\nIn 2005 Klaus Ampler fell ill with Alzheimer’s disease, which led to his death in 2016 in a nursing home at the age of 75."
