        "text": "GYMNASTICS\n\nA solid performance by Shannon Miller in the compulsory round Sunday put the United States in position to upset the heavily favored Unified Team.\n\nMiller led in the individual competition with 39.636 points. The Unified Team's Svetlana Boginskaya, a four-time medalist in '88, was second at 39.625.\n\nThe Unified Team had 197.507 points, a half-point ahead of the United States. Romania was third with 196.982. The team medals will be determined Tuesday after the optional finals.\n\nOne of the meet's favorites, American Kim Zmeskal, fell from the beam while executing a back handspring. She came back to score well in her final three events but was in danger of failing to qualify for the all-around finals. Olympic rules limit three competitors from each country in the all-around finals, and Zmeskal trails teammates Miller, Betty Okino and Kerri Strug.\n\nVOLLEYBALL\n\nAfter the United States men rallied for a 15-8, 11-15, 10-15, 17-16, 16-14 victory over Japan, Japanese coach Seiji Oko protested that U.S. player Bob Samuelson should have received a red card for misconduct at match point in the fourth set, which would have resulted in victory for the Japanese.\n\nThe protest was upheld and a decision on the match will be made today. Officials could decide to replay the entire game, restart from the point of the rules violation or let the result stand.\n\nWRESTLING\n\nDennis Koslowski stayed on course for another medal by posting two big victories in the preliminaries, including an upset of the defending champion in the 220-pound class.\n\nKoslowski, 32, trying to become America's first two-time medalist in Greco-Roman, started the day with a stunning 2-0 upset over 1988 gold medalist Andrzej Wronski of Poland. Koslowski hit a two-point gut wrench midway through the bout and remained in control until the final buzzer. Koslowski later edged South Korea's Song Sung-Il 1-0.\n\nAmerican Rodney Smith defeated Spain's Pedro Villuela 6-1 at 149{ pounds. Smith got a bye in the second round.\n\nDefending Olympic champion Jon Ronningen of Norway spoiled what would have been a perfect day for the Americans by beating Shawn Sheldon 5-0 in the 114{-pound class. Sheldon dropped to 1-1. Another loss eliminates him.\n\nBASEBALL\n\nTeam USA opened play in the first official Olympic tournament with a 4-1 victory over host Spain.\n\nThe University of Miami's Jeff Alkire threw a three-hitter and struck out 10 in 7 innings. Designated hitter Michael Tucker hit a two-run homer in the second.\n\nSpain's pitchers gave up five hits but walked 11, hit a batter, threw four wild pitches and made two errors.\n\nIn other games, Cuba returned after boycotting the past two Games and crushed a good Dominican Republic team 8-0. Also, Taiwan defeated Italy 8-2, and Japan ripped Puerto Rico 9-0.\n\nBOXING\n\nThe two Americans who fought advanced. Light-flyweight Eric Griffin, a two-time world champion at 106 pounds, beat the Dominican Republic's Fauston Mercedes 14-2, and welterweight Pepe Reilly stopped Spain's Victor Baute with a four-punch combination with 1:05 left in the 147-pound bout.\n\nThere was a chorus of boos from the crowd when the fight was stopped, but Reilly was leading 23-9 and there was no question Baute was hurt.\n\nGriffin's quest for a gold may have been made easier when Puerto Rico's Nelson Dieppa, a projected medalist, was upset by Bulgaria's Daniel Bojinor.\n\nMeanwhile, Fana Thwala was the first black South African to compete in these Games when he was beaten 9-0 in the 106-pound class by Spain's Rafael Lozano. Thwala is believed to be the first black to compete for South Africa in the Olympics since 1904.\n\nAfrican National Congress leader Nelson Mandela watched the fight. Mandela on Thwala: \"I think he didn't use his right hand as much as he should have.\"\n\nDIVING\n\nChina's Fu Mingxia, 13, scored 361.770 points on six qualifying dives to lead 11 other competitors into today's final in women's 10-meter platform diving.\n\nAmerican Mary Ellen Clark _ who lives in Fort Lauderdale _ finished second, with 329.850 points, and American Ellen Owen rallied from 24th place after four rounds to finish fifth with 299.520.\n\nThe finals will consist of eight dives, including four required dives and four optionals.\n\nCYCLING\n\nGermany won the men's 100-kilometer team time trial in 2 hours, 1 minute, 39 seconds. Italy finished second, a minute behind. France took the bronze in 2:05:25.\n\nThe four-member American team finished 16th out of 30 teams. The Americans had to endure two flat tires and a bike change.\n\nThe German team was made up of two former East Germans _ Bernd Dittert and Uwe Peschel _ and two former West Germans _ Christian Meyer and Michael Rich.\n\nAustralia's Kathryn Watt came from behind in the women's 81-kilometer road race, finishing in 2:04:42 in 95-degree heat. Favorite Jeannie Longo of France finished 20 seconds later to win the silver. The Netherlands' Monique Knol was another second behind for the bronze. Jeanne Golay, who lives in Fort Lauderdale, had the highest American finish _ sixth.\n\nTRACK AND FIELD\n\nPortuguese marathoner Rosa Mota announced she wouldn't defend her Olympic title because of health problems.\n\nMota, 34, said in a statement she was \"not in the necessary physical condition to live up to expectations.\" The medical problems were unspecified.\n\nWEIGHTLIFTING\n\nBulgaria's Ivan Ivanov won gold in the flyweight (114 pound) category of the weightlifting competition. China's Lin Qisheng took the silver and Romania's Traian Ciharean the bronze.\n\nIvanov won world titles in 1989, '90 and '91.\n\nThere were no Americans in the flyweight category.\n\nSHOOTING\n\nSouth Korea's Yeo Kab-soon won the women's air rifle gold, the first medal of the 1992 Games. The silver went to Bulgaria's Vesela Letcheva and the bronze to Yugoslavia's Aranka Binder.\n\nAs a consequence of sanctions, the Olympic banner was raised in place of the Yugoslav flag during the medal ceremony. Binder refused to attend a news conference afterward.\n\nThe Unified Team's Konstantine Loukachik won the men's free pistol gold medal. The silver went to China's Wang Yifu, and Sweden's Ragnar Skanaker won the bronze. American Darius \"Doc\" Young was fourth.\n\nLoukachik, 16, was five years younger than anyone else in the finals. Young, at 54, is the oldest U.S. Olympian.\n\n_ WIRE REPORTS"
