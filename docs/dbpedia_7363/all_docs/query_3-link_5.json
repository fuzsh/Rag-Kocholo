Anna Wilson (Ka) s.t.\n\nRace Reports\n\nMiguel Indurain reasserted his authority in the world of time trial cycling on Saturday when he won the Olympic title in the 52 km solo test on the Buckhead circuit.\n\nThe Spaniard clocked one hour four minutes five seconds -- 12 seconds faster than his second-placed compatriot Abraham Olano, world road race champion.\n\nBritain's Chris Boardman took the bronze, finishing 31 seconds slower than Indurain.\n\nAmerica's best hope for a medal, Texan Lance Armstrong, finished a disappointing sixth, more than two minutes behind Indurain.\n\nIndurain suffered a major setbak earlier this year when he was unexpectedly defeated in the Tour de France, a race he has won five times.\n\nWith his reputation as world number one at stake, he arrived in Atlanta determined to set the record straight.\n\nBoardman kept the Spanish pair in check in the first half of the trial.\n\nBut after holding Indurain at 18 seconds his advantage vanished rapidly and the Spaniard was ahead by seven seconds with 20 km remaining.\n\nThen Olano closed in to snatch the silver in the final kilometers to give Spanish cycling their first and only Atlanta medals.\n\nBoardman said: ``I was beaten by a great man, a nice person, and an outstanding champion. It is always disappointing to be third, but I have to be content. I could not go any faster.\n\n``I started too fast. It was a mistake really. Then I missed a bend and lost some momentum. On the last lap I just went flat out.''\n\nBefore the race he had warned that Atlanta's changeable weather could affect performances, and the organizers challenged the elements by splitting the 40 riders into groups of 10.\n\nThere was almost an hour's delay between each group starting and finishing, and the second bunch had to ride through heavy rain on one part of the course. But the faster men who started later had sunshine all the way.\n\n``Every fear I had about this course proved true,'' said Boardman. ``It was dry for some, yet others had to face a heavy storm.''\n\nIndurain abandoned hi-tech equipment for this ride, using a bike equipped with normal wire spokes, and admitted later that he was not at his best.\n\n``I won this with my head as much as my legs. Losing the Tour did not affect me. I prepared for this time trial as though I had won the Tour.\n\n``The Tour is important because of its history but the Olympics are important because of their dimension.''\n\nHis future plans have still to be settled. ``First, I will ride the San Sebastian Classic. After that I will decide whether to contest the world road championships in October or race in the Tour of Spain.''\n\nIndurain has twice won the Giro d'Italia and has five triumphs in the French tour but has yet to shine in his home tour.\n\nTalk of him retiring at the end of the year is rife but no one in his camp will discuss it, least of all Indurain.\n\nIn women's cycling, Russian Zulfia Zabirova surprised the dominant French by beating their favorite, Jeannie Longo, in her quest for an Olympic double in the women's time trial on Saturday.\n\nZabirova, 22, posted 36 minutes and 40 seconds to beat Longo by 20 seconds over 26 kilometers of the Buckhead circuit with Clara Hughes of Canada taking the bronze.\n\nLongo, 37, began France's golden run by winning the women's road race on the opening day of the cycling program, and after the track racing they had four golds.\n\nShe celebrated the golden double in the world championships last year in Colombia, winning the road race and the time trial and bringing her world title tally to 10.\n\nHughes, a world championships silver medallist last year, clocked 37:13, but the bronze medallist in that event, Australia's Kathy Watt, was fourth, 40 seconds slower.\n\nAmerican Linda Brenneman finished 12th, more two minutes behind Zabirova.\n\nMore Reports\n\nSpanish cyclist Miguel Indurain is the kind of racer who can frustrate his rivals. First he thrashes them, then he's nice about it...infuriatingly nice.\n\n``Indurain makes me sick because he's actually a really nice guy,'' joked Britain's Chris Boardman after being beaten into bronze by the Spaniard in Saturday's inaugural Olympic time trial.\n\n``You can't actually work yourself up, there's no hate involved, no anger. He's a really nice bloke and a true champion.''\n\nBoardman paused. ``Luckily he's retiring at the end of the year,'' he added\n\nThat last phrase sounds like wishful thinking rather than inside information. The 32-year-old Spaniard, winner of five successive Tours de France from 1991-1995, says he's taking every race as it comes.\n\nAnd after losing this year's Tour to Denmark's Bjarne Riis, it must be satisfying to be winning again.\n\nIndurain is calm, mentally tough, not obsessed with his own personal glory. Tour veterans say he worries more about making sure the crops are picked on the family farm in Navarra than with where his next title is coming from.\n\nPhysically, he's little short of miraculous. His cardiovascular system, in particular, has been labelled superhuman -- a resting heart rate of around 30 beats per minute, a lung capacity of eight litres, and a heart capable of pumping 50 litres of blood per minute for hours at a time.\n\nIn the mountain stages of the Tour de France -- the sport's gruelling endurance section -- Indurain can take his pulse rate up to 150 beats per minute and drop it back to 60 on the descent within half a minute.\n\nAll of which came in useful in steamy Atlanta on Saturday. The temperature was already 30 degrees Celsius (86 Farenheit) when the race started with 84 percent humidity.\n\nWhile Boardman cooked on the 52.2 km (32.4 mile) four-lap course -- his body temperature up to 41 Celsius (106 Farenheit) and his pulse rate over 190 beats per minute -- Indurain and his compatriot Abraham Olano remained cool.\n\nHe improved his time by a few seconds on every lap and then lopped off 11 seconds on the f\n\ninal lap for a 12-second win over Olano. ``The Tour de France is important to me because it's a part history,'' Indurain said. ``The Olympic Games are important because of their dimension. In that sense nothing else can match them.''\n\nCycling Summary\n\nMiguel Indurain, beaten in his attempt to win a record sixth Tour de France, resumed normal service at the Olympics by powering to victory in the time-trial. The Spaniard's triumph, after French and Italians had dominated the other cycling events, exposed the much-vaunted threats from Australia and the United States as simply that -- empty threats.\n\nIndurain led a Spanish one-two with the man he had guided to the world road race title in Colombia last year, Abraham Olano, while Britain's Chris Boardman had to settle for bronze in the humid heat of Atlanta.\n\nIndurain was his usual low-key self after becoming an Olympic champion on Saturday. \"The Tour's finished and I did the best I could,\" he said. \"Today I did what I could and it turned out well.\n\n\"After what I have done in past years, I don't have anything to prove to anyone.\"\n\nZulfiya Zabirova of Russia won the women's event ahead of Frenchwoman Jeannie Longo, winner of last week's road race.\n\nFor Longo it was just reward. The ten-time world cycling champion needed four Olympic attempts to finally claim the gold\n\nIt had been a long and often painful road to Olympic glory for 37-year-old Longo, who is known as the Joan of Arc of French cycling.\n\nSwiss rider Pascal Richard won the men's road race after outsprinting Dane Rolf Sorensen at the line, with Britain's Max Sciandri bringing up the rear.\n\nHowever, Europe's success only served to highlight the wretched performance of the Australian favourites -- riven by in-fighting off the track and failing to deliver the goods when the bickering stopped.\n\nThe trouble started when the Australian Cycling Federation found themselves being hauled before the Court of Arbitration for Sport by Kathy Watt.\n\nWatt, given the all-clear in April to ride the pursuit, was kicked out the event by ACF officials after Lucy Tyler-Sharman put in some sensational times just before the Olympics.\n\nThe court made the ACF reinstate Watt, but the Australian rider bungled the event. She scraped into the second round as the last qualifier and had the humiliation of being lapped by future gold medallist Antonella Bellutti.\n\nTeam leader Michael Turtur decribed the events as a disaster, while cycling coach Charlie Walsh said: \"There's a girl sitting the grandstand ... who could have won the gold medal.\"\n\nTyler-Sharman, watching the debacle in the stands, was so distressed she claimed to be on the point of giving up to do power-lifting.\n\nConsolation took the form of a points race bronze medal, but she admitted: \"Kathryn Watt's selfishness was a motivating factor today.\"\n\nBut if Watt made a humiliating exit from the track events, she was not alone.\n\nShane Kelly, the world champion, world record holder, Olympic silver medallist and runaway favourite for the 1km trial, never even started his event.\n\nKelly's foot slipped out of the pedal clasp as he powered down for the off, and he was left standing astride his bike.\n\nHe summed up the situation neatly: \"I stuffed up.\""
