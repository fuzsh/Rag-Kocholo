        "text": "Motor Racing\n\nThe owners of Silverstone, the British Racing Drivers' Club, have made a multi-million pound offer to Formula One commercial rights holder, Bernie Ecclestone, to promote the British Grand Prix until 2007.\n\nBRDC chairman Ray Bellm talked to Ecclestone and a government representative from the East Midlands Development Agency (EMDA) in London yesterday. The offer is thought to be short of the £10 million annual fee demanded by Ecclestone, but sufficient to ensure that no profit would accrue to the BRDC.\n\n• Jenson Button's exit strategy from BAR advanced a pace yesterday with the formal lodging of a contract by Williams with Formula One's in-house arbitration service the Contracts Recognition Board.\n\nThe move followed a fortnight of negotiations that failed to resolved the dispute between BAR and Williams, both of whom claim his services for 2005. It is hoped that the CRB will rule on the legitimacy of the respective contracts within a fortnight, ending a saga that has rumbled on for more than a month.\n\nYachting\n\nRussell Coutts, sacked six weeks ago from the Swiss Alinghi by America's Cup holder Ernesto Bertarelli, has been fiercely criticised by the bio-tech billionaire. Bertarelli says the most successful America's Cup skipper in history is driven only by money.\n\n\"One day he entered my office, furious, telling me that he was paying way too much tax, that I had poorly advised him,\" he said. \"Russell Coutts's salary ranks among the top 20 in Switzerland. He is as well-paid as the greatest football stars of today. \"\n\nCoutts claims breach of contract is at the root of their 12-month dispute. Yesterday Bertarelli appointed tactician and Coutts's great friend Brad Butterworth to the position of vice-president of the Alinghi sailing team.\n\nGolf\n\nFormer European tour player Paul Affleck led the way after the opening round of the £48,000 Welsh Professional Championship over the new venue of Vale of Llangollen yesterday. Affleck had halves of 34 and 32 for a six-under-par score of 66.\n\nHe goes into the second and penultimate round this morning one stroke clear of Glamorgan's young professional Peter Hunt with three men including the West Region PGA captain, John Peters, a further two strokes back in third spot\n\nSpeedway\n\nDavid Norris's storming season has been ended by multiple leg injuries he suffered in a horrifying crash during Eastbourne's Elite League draw with Swindon at Arlington.\n\nThe inspirational Eagles captain, who rode for Britain in the World Cup last month, has suffered a broken tibia, fibula and ankle and now faces a race to be fit for the start of next season.\n\nHockey\n\nNikki Hudson, the double Olympic gold medallist, will play for National League Division One side Woking this season.\n\nHudson, one of the world's best strikers who recovered from knee surgery in time to play for Australia in Athens, will join boyfriend Ian Jennings at the club. Jennings is to coach the women's team, who will now be favourites for promotion.\n\nCricket\n\nThe Queenslander played eight matches for Middlesex last season, taking 45 wickets, and he will join compatriot Mike Hussey at Chester-le-Street as Durham's second overseas player.\n\nBowls\n\nThe sedate atmosphere at Victoria Park in Leamington Spa was broken last night when, in the women's World Championships, a Guernsey trio appealed against an umpire's decision they claimed had cost them their match against the defending champions, New Zealand.\n\nGuernsey, 16-11 up at the time, and seemingly heading for a famous victory, were visibly shaken when they were denied the shot, dropped a treble, and New Zealand went on to win by two shots, 18-16.\n\nThe appeals committee, decreed that the result should stand.\n\nAn unscheduled defeat for Ellen Falkner and Amy Monkhouse by the Canadian pair could not prevent the England duo reaching the quarter-finals, and Shirley Page's English triple came through the group games with a 100 per cent record.\n\nCycling\n\nAustralia's Michael Rogers was awarded the 2003 time trial world title by the International Cycling Union yesterday after British rider David Millar decided not to appeal against his drug-related disqualification.\n\nThe silver and bronze medals go to German riders Uwe Peschel and Michael Rich, respectively."
