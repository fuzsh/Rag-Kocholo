        "text": "Scotland's David Millar swept irresistibly to a time-trial gold medal here at the world road cycling championships yesterday, completing the 26-mile (41.6km) course more than 85sec clear of Michael Rogers of Australia in second and Germany's Uwe Peschel in third.\n\nBut the 26-year-old time-trial specialist, who started favourite to win a world champion's rainbow jersey in the absence of Lance Armstrong, Jan Ullrich and last year's winner Santiago Botero, admitted he had almost worried himself out of his triumph when he arrived in Canada exhausted and anxious about his form.\n\n\"I knew everyone expected me to win. I was scared to death,\" Millar said. \"Since the Tour of Spain [in which he claimed a stage victory] I felt terrible. [But] this morning I went for a ride and for the first time in 10 days I felt good. It was: 'Yes! Thank you!'.\" Millar was the second last of the 44 riders to start and made a theatrical appearance with his completely black, purpose-built time-trial bike shrouded in a hotel sheet and carried into the start area by a British team official. Moments later, Millar rushed in separately on a conventional machine.\n\nUnder unseasonably warm conditions, Millar exacted sweet revenge on Isidro Nozal, who had twice got the better of him in last month's Vuelta, giving the Spaniard a 1 minute start and passing him en route to an unbeatable 36sec lead at the 20km stage. Chris Boardman took this title in 1994 and, like the Englishman, Miller wants to be Olympic champion too. \"One of the reasons I wanted to win was because I wanted to be on the start ramp at the Olympics as the reigning world champion,\" he said."
