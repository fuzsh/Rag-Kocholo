        "text": "Dirk Nowitzki, a towering figure in the world of basketball, was born on June 19, 1978, in Würzburg, Germany. From an early age, his athletic prowess was apparent, but it wasn't until he picked up a basketball that he truly found his calling. Following in the footsteps of his basketball-playing sister and father, Dirk's journey into the sport started at DJK Würzburg, a sports club in his hometown. Nowitzki's professional career began with the Dallas Mavericks in the National Basketball Association (NBA) after being selected as the 9th overall pick in the 1998 NBA Draft. Overcoming initial struggles, he established himself as one of the league's finest players, revolutionizing the power forward position with his unique blend of scoring ability and finesse. Throughout his career, he earned numerous accolades, including 14 All-Star appearances, an MVP award, and a Finals MVP honor when he led the Mavericks to their first championship in 2011. Off the court, Nowitzki is known for his philanthropy. He established the Dirk Nowitzki Foundation, which aims to provide education, health, and well-being for children around the globe. He's also noted for his loyalty, having spent his entire 21-season NBA career with the Mavericks, making him one of the few players in league history to have played for a single team for over two decades. Dirk Nowitzki's legacy transcends basketball, leaving a lasting impact not just on the sport, but also on the communities he has served.\n\nMagdalena \"Lena\" Neuner (since her 2014 marriage legally Magdalena Holzer, born 9 February 1987) is a retired German professional biathlete. She is the most successful woman of all time at Biathlon World Championships and a two-time Olympic gold medalist. At the age of 21, she became the youngest Overall World Cup winner in the history of the International Biathlon Union (IBU). With 34 World Cup wins, Neuner is ranked second all-time for career victories on the Biathlon World Cup tour. She has won the Overall World Cup title three times, in 2007–08, in 2009–10 and her final season in 2011–12. Neuner retired from the sport in March 2012, citing a lack of motivation and her desire for a normal life. Neuner started biathlon when she was nine years old and won five junior world championship titles from 2004 to 2006. She made her World Cup debut in 2006 and won her first World Cup race in January 2007. One month later, she claimed three gold medals in her first appearance at the Biathlon World Championships. In the 2007–08 season, Neuner won the Overall World Cup and once more claimed three titles at the 2008 World Championships. After a less successful winter in 2008–09, she participated in her first Winter Olympic Games in 2010, winning the gold medal in both the pursuit and the mass start, and silver in the sprint race. Neuner also claimed the 2009–10 Overall World Cup title. At the 2011 World Championships, she won three more gold medals. In her final winter on the World Cup tour, Neuner won two more titles at the 2012 World Championships and claimed the Overall World Cup for a third time. During her seven World Cup seasons, Neuner won 34 World Cup races and achieved 63 podium finishes. As part of Germany's World Cup team, she won ten relay races and three mixed relay events. During six appearances at Biathlon World Championships, Neuner claimed 17 medals: twelve gold, four silver and one bronze. In addition, she has won seven junior world championship titles. Neuner was known as one of the fastest cross-country skiers in biathlon. She had been noted for her volatile shooting performances in the standing position, particularly in the early years of her career, often at the expense of better results. Neuner has lived in the Bavarian village of Wallgau since birth. At the age of 16, she joined the German Customs Administration to become a member of the government-funded Customs-Ski-Team. Since winning three world championship gold medals in 2007, Neuner is one of her home country's most popular female athletes. She was named German Sportswoman of the Year in 2007, 2011 and 2012."
