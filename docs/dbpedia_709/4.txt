Maximilian Wengler (14 January 1890 – 25 April 1945) was a German general serving during World War II and recipient of the coveted Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grade Oak Leaves and Swords was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.

Wengler took command of the 83. Infanterie-Division on 27 March 1945 in the area of Gotenhafen. The division, after escaping the encirclement of the city, fought its way to Oxhöfter Kämpe and Pillau-Neutief. Here Wengler and numerous men of his staff were killed by an aerial bomb on 25 April 1945. His wife had also been killed by aerial bombardment in the winter of 1944/45.
