Her Spouse

Emperor Ai of Han 漢哀帝 (25 BC – 15 August 1 BC), name Liu Xin (劉欣 Liú Xīn), was an emperor of the Chinese Han dynasty. He ascended the throne when he was 20, having been made heir by his childless uncle Emperor Cheng, and he reigned from 7 to 1 BC.

The people and the officials were initially excited about his ascension, as he was viewed by them (as well as Emperor Cheng) to be intelligent, articulate, and capable. However, under Emperor Ai, corruption became even more prevalent, and heavy taxes were levied on the people. Furthermore, Emperor Ai was highly controlled by his grandmother Consort Fu (consort of his grandfather and his predecessor’s father Emperor Yuan), who demanded the title of Grand Empress Dowager—even though she had never been an empress previously and therefore did not properly hold that title, and this led to the unprecedented and unrepeated situation of four women possessing empress dowager titles at the same time—Empress Wang Zhengjun (Emperor Cheng’s mother and Emperor Yuan’s wife), Empress Zhao Feiyan (Emperor Cheng’s wife), Consort Fu, and Consort Ding (Emperor Ai’s mother).

Consort Fu’s control of the political scene extended until her death on February 2 BC, including an episode where her jealousy of Consort Feng Yuan—another consort of Emperor Yuan’s (and therefore her romantic rival) and a grandmother of the future Emperor Ping—resulted in Consort Feng being falsely accused of witchcraft and subsequently being forced to die by suicide. During Emperor Ai’s reign, he also stripped the Wang clan (Empress Wang’s clan), which had been powerful during Emperor Cheng’s reign, of much of their power, and substitute members of the Fu and Ding clans in their stead (which, ironically, caused the people, who were not enamored with the Wangs initially, to long for their return to power as they associated the departure of the Wangs from power with Emperor Ai’s incompetence in administration).

In an unpopular act, Emperor Ai had his prime minister Wang Jia (王嘉, unrelated to the Wang clan mentioned above) put to death for criticizing him, an act that made him appear tyrannical. Emperor Ai’s shortcomings quickly led to the demoralization of the people towards the government and the acquisition of power by Wang Mang, in a backlash, after Ai died in 1 BC.
