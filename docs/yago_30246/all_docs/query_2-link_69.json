        "text": "China\n\nImperial China began in 221 B.C., during the time of the Roman Republic, and lasted until the 20th century. The Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties ruled in parts of China before 221 B.C. According to tradition, these dynasties stretch back to the 27th century B.C. During the Neolithic period, the Chinese already knew how to make silk and carved amulets out of jade. The Zhou Dynasty ruled during the Bronze Age. Their rule was seen as a golden age to succeeding generations. Writing became widespread during the Bronze Age (mid-2nd millennium B.C.). Chinese records date back to the 8th century B.C. (2)\n\nPaper was developed during Han times. Hemp paper existed since at least 109 A.D. Cai Lun created a way to mass produce paper from tree bark, hemp, and linen before 121 A.D. By the 3rd century A.D., paper had largely replaced bamboo, wood, and pieces of silk as a writing material. Paper spread to Korea and Japan in the 7th century and reached Europe (through Central Asia and the Arabs) in the 12th century. (2)\n\nQin Shihuangdi became the First Emperor in 221 B.C. In the process of establishing his power, he burned the books of previous regimes. His dynasty, the Qin Dynasty ruled from 221 to 207 B.C. The Qin capital was at Xianyang, which was destroyed when Xiang Yu killed the entire Qin family. China's Han Dynasty lasted from 206 B.C. to 220 A.D. and was the height of the Silk Road. During the period of the Western Han rulers, the capital was in Chang'an (modern Xi'an). Wang Mang ruled between the Western Han rulers and the Eastern Han rulers. After Wang Mang died, Chang'an was destroyed during the fighting that followed. Guang Wudi, founder of the Eastern Han, moved the capital to the eastern city of Luoyang.\n\nBetween 220 and 907 A.D., China went through the Three Kingdoms (when the north became the Wei kingdom, the west became the Shu Han kingdom, and the south became the Wu kingdom), a period of division with Northern and Southern Dynasties, and reunification under the Sui (581 to 618) and the Tang (618 to 907). From 907 A.D. to 1368, China faced the instability of the Five Dynasties, peace under the Song (960 to 1279), and then Mongol invasions. The period from 1368 to 1911 saw the end of Imperial China under the Ming (1368 to 1644) and Qing dynasties (1644 to 1911). (1, 2)\n\nNote: Where there are two names, the family name is listed first.
