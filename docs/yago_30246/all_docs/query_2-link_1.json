        "text": "Zhao Feiyan (45 BC — 1 BC), also named Zhao Yizhu, was quite famous for her stunning beauty and excellent dancing skills in the history of China.\n\n​\n\nFrom a civilian to the queen of Emperor Cheng of Han (51 BC — 7 BC), and then the Empress Dowager respected by the Emperor Ai of Han (27 BC — 1 BC), Zhao Feiyan relied not only on her exceptional gorgeousness but also her schemes, political talent, and insight.\n\n​\n\nHowever, destiny didn’t always favor her.\n\nA Gorgeous Dancer Who Captivated the Emperor\n\n​\n\nZhao Feiyan and her sister Zhao Hede were born into a poverty civilian family, so they were sent to a princess’ mansion, where they learned to sing and dance.\n\n​\n\nOne day, the current Emperor Cheng of Han Liu Ao came to the princess’ place and fell in love with Zhao Feiyan at first sight.\n\nHe was obsessed with her exceptional dancing skill and beauty and immediately took her back to the royal palace.\n\n​\n\nLater, the emperor was told that Zhao Feiyan’s younger sister, Zhao Hede, was even more beautiful. Then he welcomed Hede to his palace as soon as possible and nominated her as honored imperial consort.\n\n​\n\nZhao Feiyan was very slender and beautiful and could dance in a delicate golden tray. She and her sister’s talents deeply attracted the emperor, who spent most of his free time with them.\n\n“Romantic Rivals”\n\n​\n\nHowever, Zhao Feiyan was not satisfied, even though she already got an honorable royal title, countless treasures, and the emperor’s love and attention.\n\n​\n\nShe and her sister started to compete with their strong “romantic enemies”.\n\n​\n\nEmperor Cheng of Han had a male lover named Zhang Fang, and they were indeed in love before.\n\nAfter Empress Dowager Wang demoted Zhang Fang to a remote place, they kept sending each other love letters.\n\n​\n\nEmpress Xiao Cheng Xu (? — 8 BC), the current queen of the emperor, was a beautiful, decent, highborn girl.\n\nShe married Liu Ao at a young age, and in the first ten years of their marriage, she almost got the emperor’s full attention and love.\n\nAfter their little son and daughter passed away young and the queen grew older, the emperor started to like other women.\n\nHowever, she was still the honored queen, let alone came from the Xu Clan (Emperor Liu Ao’s grandmother’s clan).\n\n​\n\nBan Jieyu (48 BC — 2 BC) was the emperor’s favorite woman after the queen.\n\nBesides her outstanding appearance, she was also a talented poet and literature in the history of China.\n\n​\n\nShe never abused her power and kept persuading the emperor to care more about his empire and to stay self-disciplined and benevolent.\n\nHence, Empress Dowager Wang, the emperor, and officials all liked and respected Ban.\n\nElimination of Competitors: Zhao Feiyan's Rise in the Han Dynasty Court\n\nZhao Feiyan and her sister demanded that the emperor stop writing to Zhang Fang. Afterward, Zhang Fang never heard from the emperor again until his death.\n\n​\n\nA few months after Zhao Feiyan and her sister came to the royal palace, she reported to Empress Dowager Wang that the current queen had been implementing witchcraft to curse the Wang Clan and the emperor, and Ban Jieyu was an accomplice as well.\n\n​\n\nIt was unclear whether Queen Xu tried to curse the Wang Clan or the Zhao sisters, but Xu did use witchcraft.\n\n​\n\nHence, Xu was abolished. She tried everything to get her crown back in the next few years, including bribery; after being found out, she was forced to commit suicide.\n\nHowever, Ban Jieyu defended herself excellently when the emperor inquired about her.\n\nShe insisted that if deities and ghosts are intelligent and perceptive, they won’t listen to evil people’s prayers; if they are not, then it’s even more useless to do those things.\n\n​\n\nThe emperor was persuaded. But Ban was aware that Zhao Feiyan and her sister would do more things to attack her in the future.\n\n​\n\nSo, Ban applied to move into Empress Dowager Wang’s palace to serve her and left the emperor to the Zhao sisters.\n\n​\n\nAfter the emperor passed away, Ban applied to guard his mausoleum until she passed away.\n\nQueen Zhao Feiyan and Her Reign in the Royal Palace\n\n​\n\nAfter those romantic rivals were gone, Zhao Feiyan told the emperor she wanted to be the queen.\n\n​\n\nHowever, Empress Dowager Wang disagreed since Zhao came from an ordinary family.\n\n​\n\nHence, Zhao Feiyan bribed Empress Dowager Wang’s nephew, who could speak good things for her.\n\n​\n\nThen, the emperor awarded Zhao’s father a high rank, noble title. Two months later, he finally nominated the “highborn” Zhao Feiyan as his queen and promoted her sister Zhao Hede.\n\n​\n\nFeiyan and Hede had no babies during more than ten years of their being with the emperor; other imperial concubines didn’t have any live kids either.\n\n​\n\nSome believed Hede, maybe Feiyan herself included, killed two babies of the emperor.\n\nQueen Zhao Feiyan's Political Investment\n\n​\n\nWhen the emperor got older but childless, many officials started suggesting he adopt a boy from another royal clan as the heir.\n\n​\n\nZhao Feiyan seized this opportunity and recommended Liu Xin, the emperor's nephew, who played an essential role in making him the crown prince.\n\n​\n\nOne year after the heir was settled, Emperor Liu Ao suddenly died in Zhao Hede's bed.\n\n​\n\nLiu Ao had been strong and healthy; hence, his sudden death aroused suspicions and critics against Hede.\n\nMost people believed that she seduced the emperor to eat or do something unusual, which led to his departure.\n\n​\n\nThen, Zhao Hede knew she had no choice and committed suicide.\n\nPosthumous Reputation in History and Literature\n\n​\n\nAfter Zhao Feiyan's death, her former political enemy, the Wang Clan, criticized her and her sister Zhao Hede for seducing Emperor Liu Ao, having killed the emperor's babies, and being involved in political issues that jeopardized the Han Empire's reign.\n\n​\n\nZhao Feiyan seduced her husband, implemented schemes to get herself the queen's crown, and recommended Liu Xin, a qualified emperor, to the Han Empire.\n\n​\n\nBut there's no concrete evidence for the rest of the crimes that people accused her of.\n\n​\n\nHowever, ironically, about a decade later, the righteous regent Wang Mang usurped the throne, ended the Han Dynasty and established his new empire.\n\n​\n\nGradually, more gossip and stories of the Zhao sisters were made up in novels, including that they cheated on the emperor, faked pregnancy, stole a baby from out of the royal palace, and how they used pills to stay beautiful and allure, etc.\n\n​\n\nThe truth probably will be buried in history forever. But without a doubt, Zhao Feiyan was stunningly beautiful, exceptionally great at dancing, and quite intelligent and decisive in seizing opportunities to get what she wanted."
