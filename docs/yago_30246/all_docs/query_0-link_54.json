        "text": "Wu Zetian (624 — 705), also named Wu Zhao, was the only legitimate female emperor in the history of China.\n\n​\n\nShe not only crowned herself and changed the name of the empire but also furthered its prosperity and improved the well-being of its citizens.\n\nShe was a challenger of the System of Military Aristocracy Clans and one of the best representatives of Feminism.\n\n​\n\nAs the first and only woman who obtained great centralized power and sovereignty, her love life was also colorful.\n\n​\n\nWu Zetian was never a moral model and had failed many people, but she had never let herself down.\n\nInfidelity with the Crown Prince While Married to the Emperor\n\n​\n\nWu Zetian's father was a businessman who had donated money to support a general rebelling against the Sui Dynasty.\n\n​\n\nAfter this general won and established the Tang Dynasty, Wu Zetian's father was awarded a political position and a noble title.\n\n​\n\nHer father departed when she was 11; afterward, she and her mother were poorly treated by other family members.\n\n​\n\nWhen Wu was 13 years old, she was selected as Emperor Taizong of Tang's imperial concubine because of her beauty.\n\n​\n\nHowever, she wasn't quite appreciated by the emperor. A few years later, she still had no kids and was never promoted.\n\n​\n\nNo one knew when Wu Zetian and the crown prince Li Zhi started their romantic relationship, which was never discovered.\n\nLife in a Temple as a Widow\n\nEmperor Li Shimin departed when Wu Zetian was 25 years old.\n\n​\n\nAccording to Empire Tang’s tradition, the late emperor’s concubines would be sent to an imperial temple if they never had kids.\n\n​\n\nSo Wu started her simple life in the Gan Ye Temple, where she was supposed to spend the rest of her life reading and writing scriptures in peace.\n\n​\n\nAt that time, her former lover Li Zhi, the favorite son and crown prince of Emperor Li Shimin, had already ascended to the throne and had a noble queen, Empress Wang, and some beautiful concubines.\n\n​\n\nLi Zhi (628 — 683), now Emperor Gaozong of Tang, was young and ambitious; as one of the best emperors of the Tang Dynasty, he governed the empire well and lived a happy life.\n\nUsurping the Crown from the Current Queen\n\n​\n\nOne year later, when Emperor Li Zhi was visiting this imperial temple, he again saw Wu Zetian, his former lover.\n\n​\n\nDuring this meeting, Li Zhi was reminded of her charm and their past experiences together.\n\nWu Zetian made the new emperor madly fall in love with her again and decided to welcome her back to the royal palace.\n\n​\n\nVery soon, she gave birth to her first son and got promoted.\n\nGradually, Emperor Li Zhi got tired of his decent queen and other beautiful concubines, those whom his remarkable parents strictly selected.\n\nAfterward, the emperor and Wu began to plan to abolish the current Empress Wang and gave Wu the queen's crown for political and personal reasons.\n\n​\n\nHowever, powerful officials strongly disagreed with abolishing Empress Wang, a decent and beautiful girl from an honorable clan that the great Emperor Li Shimin chose.\n\n​\n\nSince then, Li Zhi and Wu Zetian became political allies based on their love and used this as an excuse to challenge the aristocratic military families that the current queen represented.\n\n​\n\nA few years later, this intelligent and determined couple finally gained the queen's crown for Wu Zetian, banished those opponent ministers, and severely weakened the dominant clans of the Tang Empire.\n\nUnfortunately, Emperor Li Zhi frequently suffered headaches since his 30s.\n\nTherefore, as his great love and sincere political ally, Empress Wu gradually got involved in political decisions.\n\n​\n\nThey also held the grand Feng Shan ceremony on Mount Tai together, like some other great emperors in the history of China.\n\n​\n\nLi Zhi and Wu Zetian had four sons and two daughters.\n\nTheir first son, a brilliant and elegant prince, passed away at a young age.\n\n​\n\nThe second son, a decent prince and excellent artist, was banished to a remote city and later forced to commit suicide after displeasing Wu.\n\nSeizing the Imperial Throne from Her Sons\n\n​\n\nWhen Empress Wu was 59, her husband, Emperor Li Zhi, passed away, and their third son ascended to the throne.\n\n​\n\nBut soon, she found that this son was too timid and irrationally obsessed with his queen.\n\n​\n\nSo, Wu abolished him and nominated her fourth son as the new emperor.\n\n​\n\nThis decision didn't satisfy her either.\n\n​\n\nThen, she half-imprisoned the new emperor in his palace and was in actual charge of the empire herself, which made many people from the royal clan unsatisfied and started to rebel.\n\nEmpress Wu Zetian sent 300,000 soldiers to defeat them and murdered large numbers of people from the royal Li clan, except her kids.\n\nEnthronement of Empress Wu Zetian\n\n​\n\nSix years later, Empress Wu changed the empire's name from Tang to Zhou and claimed herself as the new emperor.\n\n​\n\nHer brilliant prime minister Di Renjie (630 — 700), persuaded Wu to nominate her son as the crown prince instead of her nephew, who only shares the same family name with her.\n\n​\n\nThis ensured that the throne would revert to the royal House of Li after Empress Wu passed away.\n\n​\n\nTherefore, her fourth son was nominated as the crown prince; but soon, he abdicated it to his older brother, the third son of Empress Wu.\n\nHer son named the dynasty back to Tang and became the next emperor, the Emperor Zhongzong of Tang.\n\n​\n\nIn the same year, Wu Zetian passed away and was buried with her second husband, Emperor Li Zhi, the love of her life.\n\n​\n\nHowever, her funeral followed a queen's ceremony instead of an emperor's.\n\n​\n\nAs she commanded, a blank tombstone was established in front of her cemetery, meaning that people could say whatever they wanted to comment about her.\n\nA Deviant Woman and An Exceptional Emperor\n\nEmpress Wu Zetian was frequently criticized for her deviant behaviors because she barely did what a \"good\" woman would do, based on virtue standards of more than 1000 years ago.\n\n​\n\nAs a concubine of great Emperor Li Shimin, she wasn't faithful nor appreciated; instead, she had an affair with the emperor's beloved son and slaughtered many princes of his royal clan years later.\n\n​\n\nAs the queen of her second husband, Emperor Li Zhi, she did not behave nor stay away from politics and power, like other moral Chinese empresses in history; she, on the contrary, had been actively involved in governance and tried her best to be influential and to seize power.\n\n​\n\nAs an empress dowager, she didn't assist her sons to be good emperors; instead, she took over the throne from them and sometimes even imprisoned them, which made her kids stay in unstable and nervous situations frequently.\n\n​\n\nAs a lover, she never covered up for her handsome male concubines; whoever endangered her ruling or broke the law was executed as long as they were found out.\n\nAs an emperor, however, Wu Zetian was quite excellent and further developed the empire and reached prosperity.\n\n​\n\nThis first and only female emperor in Chinese history commanded the respect of all men, kneeling before her as the most honorable monarch, thanks to her exceptional governance skills and outstanding achievements.\n\n​\n\nAs a woman born into an ordinary official’s family, she was a much better sovereign than many male emperors who were better educated and ascended to the throne legitimately.\n\n​\n\nUnlike all other emperors in history, she was the only one with a blank tombstone; after all her legendary experiences and accomplishments, she chose silence."
