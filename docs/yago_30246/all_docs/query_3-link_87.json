        "text": "The Shangguan Family and the Sun God Department, currently had a cooperative relationship.\n\nThe Sun God Department has long since become the number one tribe in the Southern Wasteland, with millions of clans, and a total of eight large cities in the Southern Wasteland, with the northern three cities owned by the Shangguan Family, and the remaining five, of which the Sun God Department has already accounted for two.\n\nAs a true superior, Shangguan family is actually happy to see these barbarians fight to death.\n\nThe benefits from war were never huge.\n\nHowever, further south of the Southern Wasteland was the territory of the Demon Race, and there were Demons living in the Southern Wasteland as well, and for the barbarians to fight themselves out of existence and for the situation to change drastically was not what the Shangguan Family wanted to see.\n\nTherefore, before Chu Bai brought people to the Southern Wasteland, the Northern Three Cities, in addition to collecting money and goods and supporting some puppets, were more focused on monitoring.\n\nPeacefully they didn’t have to worry, the barbarians just weren’t that kind of honest nature.\n\nOf course anyone who dared to start a large-scale war would definitely be the first to be suppressed.\n\n……\n\nIn general, no one has ever looked beyond the lives of the lower classes.\n\nWhy did the Sun God Tribe’s power expand so quickly?\n\nThe Divine King Tribe?\n\nPart of the reason.\n\nMore actually, it was the barbarian people who saw their well-fed compatriots.\n\nWhen Chu Bai pulled the Sun God Ministry up, the first thing that was reversed was the prodigal nature of the barbarians.\n\nHe gave them houses, divided fields, and built a school …… to give them the concept of home.\n\nWith a home and bonds, the bloodline of fighting can be suppressed.\n\nAs for the Northern Three Cities not suppressing the Sun God Department, but instead there were moves to support it, it was naturally Little Green Boat’s hand.\n\nShangguan Qingzhou this holy son when the baleful, because afraid to step in the dust of the previous holy son, the great river and mountains do not want, far away from home, to the safest and possibly the most dangerous Demon King City to run.\n\nHowever, the negative was the positive, allowing him to embrace a big thick leg.\n\nIt proved to be too difficult for him to make waves within the family with his age and cultivation.\n\nSo he was going to hold on tight and treat that man’s affairs as his own.\n\nAnd this time, he had gone up to the Holy Mountain, again in response to his brother-in-law’s summons.\n\nBrother-in-law Chu Changge had asked him to come by name, so Shangguan Qingzhou had come with his ass on the line.\n\nBut . .\n\nOn top of the holy mountain hall, which was more like a sea of flowers, Shangguan Qingzhou didn’t see Chu Bai’s figure, and there was only a beautiful young girl who was teasing the flowers and butterflies.\n\nThe palace maiden of the Blessed Life Academy?\n\nThose eighteen Shangguan Qing Zhou had seen, not the one in front of him.\n\nAnd in terms of face value, this one seems to beat the previous eighteen.\n\nThe young girl said, “Little Saint Son, didn’t your family teach you that looking carelessly will make your eyes go blind?”\n\n“!!!”\n\nThis spoke like the elders of the family.\n\nSo Shangguan Qingzhou subconsciously shortened his body and saluted, saying respectfully, “This senior, the kid is here to find my brother-in-law, please take it easy if you have offended.”\n\nYoung lady: “Well, it’s fine, he’s the one to take the blame, if he doesn’t want to take the blame, he’ll naturally gouge out your eyes.”\n\nThis.\n\nThe young girl continued, “Since you call him brother-in-law, just call me …… senior, it is me who let you go up the mountain.”\n\nThis!\n\nIt’s the elder of the brother-in-law’s family?\n\nLin Wan Er said, “I, ah, am the woman he snatched from the Great Zhou Palace.”\n\nShangguan Qingzhou: “Pfft! .”\n\nBlind Jiepao guessed for half a day, and one sentence directly broke his defense.\n\nIt was all said that it was hard to survive at his age and cultivation.\n\nIt has been confirmed that the saint’s son is not a high-risk status, so those uncles, brothers, brothers, nephews and so on who watched the fire from the other side of the river before have become people who strongly hope that Shangguan Qingzhou will become the former saint’s son.\n\nThe Shangguan family honored the strongest, and it was common for saints to accept challenges.\n\nBut his small body really can’t withstand the fire of many parties.\n\nIf he hadn’t borrowed the Phoenix Academy’s elixir to show his sainthood in front of people, his current situation would only be worse than miserable.\n\nNowadays, Shangguan Qingzhou is most afraid of the saint’s sister and the great saint official adults pinch up, followed by his bull brother-in-law and then out of what moths.\n\nLook, look, this is not out of it.\n\nGreat Zhou Palace robbery, the son of Zhou’s daughter-in-law, brother-in-law a brother-in-law, we can not first from the princess to grab the start?\n\nLooking at the opposite side of the child Sima like expression, Lin Wan Er smiled to the mouth, “Rest assured, I’m not a person of the Zhou family, but the Zhou Emperor see me have to call me a mother.”\n\n“.”\n\n“.”\n\nShangguan Qingzhou only felt a blackness before his eyes.\n\nHe didn’t want to stay any longer.\n\nZhou Tianzi his mother, this is clearly the rhythm that the more you know, the faster you die!\n\nThe flower butterflies flew away, Lin Wan’er stretched a big waist, waved her hand, and a seat woven with wood and rattan appeared behind Shangguan Qingzhou.\n\n“Scared you? Shouldn’t you be waving a flag when you hear your big brother perform such a feat?”\n\nAs she spoke, Lin Wan’er also sat down, her posture elegant to the extreme.\n\nShe had been the Empress Dowager of Cining Palace for so many years that she could do every detail impeccably.\n\nFetching a cup of flower tea and sipping it to herself, Lin Wan’er said, ”I’m looking for you to come here today to ask you to cede the three cities in the north.\n\nIf you can’t do it, then go back and find the adults at home to discuss it, the Sun Tribe has been fighting for a while and needs to recuperate for a while, and that dead man of mine thinks that the territory is too small and slows down the development.\n\nWell, that’s it.\n\nI have told you what I should tell you, go back how to say, you think for yourself.”\n\nShangguan Qingzhou, nodded.\n\nEmpress Lin waved her hand, “Go back.”\n\nShangguan Qingzhou walked at least three times as fast as he came.\n\nThis made Lin Wan’er can’t help but once again lament, “Men, unreliable, Chu Changge, still thought how big the guts, showing half a face and then hiding for a small half a year.”\n\nRegarding herself, regarding Chu Bai and Southern Desert, what exactly did Lin Wan Er think?\n\nThe first two she understood in her heart, the last one belonged to mutual benefit.\n\nShe could suppress the Southern Wasteland’s qi, and in turn the stronger the Southern Wasteland’s qi was, the more it would help her cultivation.\n\nWhen she thought about it, when she was in the palace, part of it was to look favorably on the contemporary Zhou Heavenly Prince, but more for her own cultivation.\n\nBut a qualification pull crotch little girl are from a mortal cultivation to the peak of the God of Transformation, and she herself only from the early stage of the Cave Void perfect promotion to the middle stage of the Cave Void.\n\nThis kind of progress was really too slow and far below expectations.\n\nAlthough breaking through to the middle stage of Cave Void had increased her lifespan by an unknown number of thousands of years, it was still too slow.\n\nA long, long time ago, Lin Wan’er felt that as long as her lifespan was long enough, sooner or later she would be able to become the number one in the world and laugh at the Heavenly Vault.\n\nBut what the hell was it that the higher one’s cultivation level was, the more one’s longevity physique dragged one’s cultivation back?\n\nLin Wan Er really want to drill into the mountains, a breath of closed for a hundred thousand years.\n\nDue to her luck, she couldn’t hide it again.\n\n“……”\n\nWaving her hand, Empress Dowager Lin no longer thought about the troublesome things and looked towards the barbarian people who made their daily pilgrimage towards the Sacred Mountain on time and said, “The Southern Wasteland is not as large as the Great Zhou, and the population is not as large as the Great Zhou, but most of the qi luck is concentrated on this mountain, and it may be possible that by occupying only half of the Southern Wasteland province, the qi luck enhancement I can enjoy would not be weaker than that of being inside the palace.”\n\nAlso.\n\nThe harem is a ball cage.\n\nAnd here, she was free.\n\nAnyway, Chu wouldn’t dare to come back.\n\nChu Bai flipped his car.\n\nHe is confident in his confidence.\n\nHe had always thought that Grand Sovereign Ning was a man of her word, but he had never thought that if she said she would go home at night, then she would definitely return.\n\nAs a result, Chu Bai alone jerked string drinking to two days, did not see the figure of Ning Wanqiu.\n\nTonight, Chu Bai had prepared Immortal Brew for the sake of Da Ning Ning joining the Chu Family, and the wine jar had been buried in the soil of an acre of Immortal Fields for a long time.\n\nJerking off and drinking, the first half was serving the second half, logical.\n\nSince no one went home, Chu Bai drank two more times a day, getting slightly drunk, while later saying painfully, “Ningning, ah Ningning, you’re really good, don’t ever go home if you can!” Chu Bai wasn’t drunk and knew that he couldn’t use the Great Dream Avatar or simply teleport out to find the door.\n\nThe Moon Shadow Cave was spacious and bright, but it was a bit pathetic when the late night was silent and Chu Bai was the only one at home.\n\nFinishing the skewer and sending back the remaining half altar of wine, he had planned to sleep.\n\nFor some reason he thought of Lin Wan’er, the Empress Dowager of Great Zhou, who had taken over the nest, and decisively exerted his divine ability to give Nana a dream.\n\nIn the past few months, Lin Wan’er is still very honest, the situation in the Southern Wasteland is becoming clearer and clearer, and the Sun God Department has no rivals.\n\nIn this regard, Chu Bai was satisfied and again intended to sleep.\n\nBut just lay down once again came temper.\n\n“Damn it, why is it that I’m locked up and she can act as a bully on top of old me’s holy mountain?”\n\nNo, have to add some blockage to her.\n\nThinking of this, Chu Bai decisively cast the Great Dream Divine Power again!\n\nIt wasn’t true that Lin Wan’er didn’t have good feelings nor hatred towards him, the karma between the two wasn’t weak.\n\nIn addition, the optional couple list +1 is hanging on the system, so this time, it will surely be successful.\n\n“Whoosh”.\n\nThe Empress Dowager’s bedchamber.\n\nLin Wan’er, who was in cultivation, opened her eyes, furrowed her willow leaf brows, looked at herself, then at her surroundings, and realized that her Yuan Shen had been brought to a mysterious space.\n\nThe space was disguised as the Empress Dowager’s Bedchamber.\n\nHow could Lin Wan’er not be able to tell the real from the fake when she was living in her own place?\n\nAs for the Yuan Shen\n\nOne’s current state was very much like a Yuan Shen leaving one’s body, and it was equally amazing.\n\nLin Wan’er had the confidence to shatter this space with a single strike, but coming so suddenly, she was very much like looking at the other party’s intentions.\n\nThen, she saw a white, chubby little guy floating over, his little body shaking as if he was drunk, pointing at himself, “Tie, Dog Empress Dowager, didn’t expect it, hahaha!”\n\nLin Wan Er: “…”\n\nLin Wan Er knew who he was, surname Chu name Bai character Chang Ge.\n\nThis was his divine ability, no wonder it was weak.\n\nHe was planning to scare himself?\n\nOh.\n\nThe white fat little YuanYing is still shaking there, clearly coming to be funny.\n\nHowever, “Tie, Lin Wan’er, Lao Zi kindly brought you out of the palace, and you’re actually occupying my home and won’t leave, 80,000+ year old demon woman, you!”\n\n“Bang.”\n\nLin Wan Er kicked and directly sent Chu Bai flying.\n\nWhat was outside the bedchamber?\n\nThere was nothing outside.\n\nBut since it was a dream, there was a way forward.\n\nChu Bai was deformed by a kick, but to say he was injured was not.\n\nGetting up from the darkness, shaking his head, the wine instantly woke up most of the time.\n\nChu Bai also looked at himself, small arms and legs white and fat.\n\n“Crap, how come I’m in the state of YuanYing, the script isn’t written like this!”\n\nAt the same time, the sound of hurried footsteps came from behind him.\n\nChu Bai in his YuanYing state was as big as a doll and was no more than two feet tall.\n\nThe Lin Wan’er who was catching up, on the other hand, was a one to one reduction, standing at a height of one meter six, and was imposing.\n\nThis was equivalent to a newborn baby versus an adult, with a zero percent chance of winning!\n\nChu Bai scattered his legs and ran.\n\n“What’s going on, this is gross?”\n\nThe Great Dream Avatar wasn’t like this, it wouldn’t pull the YuanYing into the middle of the dream world!\n\nAnd with the divine ability he cast, he should be able to go home at any time after playing off.\n\nNow he couldn’t, there was a will that was fighting against him, and that cargo Lin Wan’er didn’t want to let him go!\n\nSo it was still necessary to quit drinking!\n\nEvery day with his wife paste paste, why is the whole thing to get beaten up this kind of oolong.\n\n“Lin Wan’er, Empress Dowager Lin, Empress Dowager, just now I was the one who drank too much and spoke out of turn, please be merciful, Empress Dowager!” Chu Bai shouted.\n\nMercy, it didn’t exist.\n\nLin Wan’er took several big strides, grabbed Chu Bai, first a burst of punches and kicks, and then she carried him back to the bedchamber.\n\nWith four eyes facing each other, it was still Lin Wan Er who carried Chu Bai to his eyes.\n\n“Chu Changge.”\n\nCurrently, Lin Wan’er was the state of the Hundred Flower Fairy, “How did you know that I’m over 80,000 years old?”\n\nChu Bai with a swollen nose: (∞)?\n\nLin Wan’er: “I asked you how you could tell I was heeling.”\n\nChu Bai: “What?”\n\nSeeing him play dumb, Empress Dowager Lin was about to punch someone again.\n\nChu Bai was indeed playing dumb, but he also saw the right moment to launch an attack towards Lin Wan’er’s wrist.\n\n“Ka-ching,” was a bite.\n\nHere, both of them had no cultivation, and from this perspective, it was instead considered to give Chu Bai a chance of survival.\n\nThe two pinched together.\n\nLin Wan’er was an inch long and an inch strong, while Chu Bai utilized the advantage of the YuanYing’s shortness and flexibility to wander around.\n\nHe is slippery, but unfortunately the strength attribute is too weak, lying on someone’s back to give a set of combinations similar to a massage.\n\nLin Wan Er is also a hole virtual ancestor level characters, have not seen the fight also use the mouth bite, close entanglement, can not let go of the natural to suffer losses.\n\nHowever, she wanted to win is not difficult, full power to hit a punch, surnamed Chu will lose.\n\nHowever, without realizing it, the body of the two began to shimmer.\n\nLin Wan Er was a lime green light and Chu Bai was a black and white taijitu, followed by a seven-colored rainbow.\n\nThe light of the two collided together.\n\nChu Bai was bounced off and Lin Wan’er took two steps back.\n\nBeing in the dream realm did not know no fatigue, so Chu Bai’s idea was to fight for a little while longer and then make peace.\n\nBut after flying out, he became energized.\n\nChu Bai laughed three times, “Sure enough, it’s still my territory I’m in charge of!”\n\nHowever, Lin Wan’er was just like him, and actually grew more and more courageous.\n\nA lime green light and a nine-colored light just hovered and intertwined together.\n\n……\n\nThe following day.\n\nEmpress Dowager Lin woke up on the Sacred Mountain, again frowning and puzzled.\n\nLast night was not a dream.\n\nShe had fought Chu Changge for at least ten thousand rounds.\n\nAs an outsider, if she couldn’t convince Chu Changge, don’t think she could cultivate here without fear.\n\nBut that was not the point.\n\nThe point is …… that her cultivation level has increased.\n\nDue to her physique, Lin Wan’er’s cultivation progressed extremely slowly, without a year and a half, she shouldn’t be able to feel any progress.\n\nIt was just one night.\n\nEven in a battle between life and death, being able to clearly perceive the improvement was equally outrageous.\n\nAnd what they did last night wasn’t considered between life and death, even if Lin Wan’er wanted to lay her hands on her, she wouldn’t be able to beat Chu Changge to death.\n\nSuddenly, an electric light crossed from her mind, “It’s Divine Soul Dual Cultivation? ……”\n\nDual cultivation, dual cultivation, indeed walking the Yin-Yang Avenue.\n\nThe more superficial ones were the harvesting of yin to replenish yang, physical body dual cultivation, and the high-end dual cultivation was precisely the legendary divine soul dual cultivation!
