        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Chinese myth of creation centres around a figure who was part-woman, part-snake — the goddess Nuwa. It is appropriate, therefore, that she should take her place as the first character to be featured in this collection of illustrations, 100 Celebrated Chinese Women, by Lu Yanguang.\n\nNuwa, who is said to have fashioned China’s primeval ancestors from mud,could hardly have foreseen how the future would unfold for her creations. The society which sprang up on her divine land did not always exalt women as goddesses. For many thousands of years, women who sought influence over their own lives and those of others, were often forced to make brutal and sometimes, fatal choices.\n\nDuring the early dynasties, women who rose to political power did so by seducing emperors: Meixi and Daji enchanted and dominated their emperors; and are credited with destroying empires through their wanton and barbaric self-indulgence. The precedents which they set enhance the myriad tales about the life of Yang Guifei, reputedly the most beautiful woman to have walked on Earth. Her charms brought Emperor Xuanzong to his knees, a crime for which she lost her life.\n\nFew women voluntarily sought the peril of being an imperial concubine. For many, the battle was fought simply for some control over their own lives. In a society where Confucianism, the dominant ideology, instructed that a woman should obey her father, husband and eventually, her son; it is not surprising that a woman’s bid for freedom forms one of the more common historical and literary themes. So it is that Zhu Yingtai would rather die than marry against her will, whilst Eighth Madam was driven to an act of brutal self-mutilation and Shentu Xiguang to a series of bloody murders, all in order to fend off the advances of unwelcome suitors.\n\nWomen who broke free from social restrictions include scholars, great warriors and well-known revolutionaries. In Song Dynasty times, such heroines were epitomised by historical characters such as the military general Lady She Saihua and the ninja assassin Hongxian. This role was later filled by women like the military commander Hong Xuanjiao and the revolutionary Qiujin.\n\nI have mentioned only a handful of the characters who appear in 100 Celebrated Chinese Women. There are many others: teachers, poets, politicians and women remembered solely for their virtuous adherence to Confucian social ethics.\n\nAlthough some of the women portrayed here are fictional and the existence of others supported by little reference in historical records, many have become the focus of folk tales. Cai Zhuozhi’s commentary offers a valuable glimpse into the relevance of these women to their own and future generations.\n\nI have attempted to reflect accurately the thoughts and opinion of the author throughout my translation. The information and dates which I have added are intended to give a greater sense of historical perspective to readers unfamiliar with the stages of China’s vast dynastic past.\n\nThe history of a nation is best told through the lives of its people. In 100 Celebrated Chinese Women, a glimpse of China’s past can be seen through the experiences, often tragic and violent, of women who have come to represent different aspects of the societies and eras in which they lived.\n\nKate Foster\n\nAbout the Illustrator\n\nLu Yanguang was born in Kaiping, Guandong province in 1348. He is presently director of Guangzhou Art Gallery, vice-chairman of Guangzhou Artists’ Association and chief editor of Guangzhou Art Studies.\n\nHis published works since 1985 include Lu Yanguang’s Album of illustrations,Selected New Works of Lu Yanguang’s illustrations, Album of Lingnan Scenery and Legends,100 Chinese Women, I00 Chinese Emperors, 100 Chinese Gods, 100 Chinese Scholars and 100 Chinese Monks.\n\nA renowned artist, Lu Yanguang started his career by drawing illustrations and cartoons. Instead of the traditional Chinese style of brush painting, each character in this collection is a combination of the old – the dynastic eras of ancient China, and the new – Lu Yanguang’s refreshingly artistic technique of xiuxiang hua (portraits in decorative style). His illustrations are characterised by a strong sense of speed and rhythm.\n\nAbout the Translator\n\nKate Foster was born in Leeds in 1968. She graduated from the University of Durham, UK in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in Chinese and Management Studies.\n\nAn avid traveller who has been to East Africa, Europe, the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan, her other interests include drama, music and literature.\n\nPresently, she lives and works in Hong Kong.\n\nThe 100 Women\n\nNüwa\n\nNüwa is the goddess who separated the heaven from the earth, creating the Divine Land (China). She is the original ancestor of the Chinese nation. According to legend, Nüwa was also the younger sister of Emperor Fuxi (said to have lived during the third millennium BC) and she herself was an empress.\n\nThe historical records say:\n\n“Nüwa had the surname Feng; she had the body of a snake, a human head and the virtue of a divine being. She is also known as Mixi.\n\nThe name Nüwa first appears in one of the Elegies of Chu entitled Tian Wen:\n\n“If she became empress, who appointed her? If Nüwa had a form, who created her?”\n\nNüwa loved peace and delighted in making things. She moulded figures from the yellow earth and gave them life and the ability to bear children: this is how humanity was created. When demons fought a terrible war, they broke the pillars which held the heavens up. The firmament cracked open and the human world was put in mortal peril. To save the lives of those she had created, Nüwa worked unceasingly, melting down the five-coloured stones to mend the breach. When the firmament was whole again, Nüwa, exhausted by her toil, lay down on the earth and was transformed into a vast mountain range. In this way, she nurtured the growth of the Chinese nation by providing a rich and fertile land. This well-known tale is known as Nüwa Mends The Firmament.\n\nAmongst China’s ethnic minorities, another story has survived concerning how Emperor Fuxi came to take his sister Nüwa as his bride. This tale is known as A Brother And Sister Marry.\n\nThe ferocious God of Thunder was captured by Fuxi’s father and imprisoned deep within a mountain cave. No one was allowed to visit him. Fuxi and Nüwa could no longer bear to hear the Thunder God’s pitiable entreaties for water, but they dared not bring him any water. Eventually, the two of them shed tears which the god drank out of their cupped hands. The Thunder God was so strengthened by the tears that he burst out of his mountain prison. To repay Fuxi and Nüwa for their part in the rescue, the Thunder God pulled a long canine tooth from his mouth and gave it to them saying:\n\n“In three days, mankind will suffer a terrible calamity. You may use this tooth to keep yourselves safe from harm.”\n\nHaving said this, the Thunder God leaped into the sky and disappeared.\n\nThree days later, the sky was filled with thunder and lightning. A tremendous storm broke out. Rain fell incessantly and the flood waters rose; huge waves swept across the earth and the entire human race was destroyed. As the flood began, the Thunder God’s tooth transformed itself into a boat. Safe aboard this vessel, Fuxi and his sister rode the waves and drifted with the tides. Only when the waters had subsided did Fuxi and Nüwa realise that they alone had survived the desolation. When they had grown into adults, Fuxi and Nüwa became husband and wife in order to bear descendants and establish a new human race.\n\nThis second story reflects the custom of intermarriage between blood relations in ancient China. It also shows why Nüwa is known as the mother of the Chinese nation.\n\nQueen Mother of the West\n\nThe Queen Mother of the West originally had the surname Yanghou. Her own name was Hui or Wanji and her great name was Taixu. She was probably a well-known person from Gansu or Shaanxi province. From her name, people have come to visualize her as a white-haired old crone; the old mother of all celestial maidens.\n\nIn line with this view, modern tales have portrayed her both as a majestic and an unreasonable woman. But in ancient books, she appears as an intriguing beauty and remains forever in the first flush of youth due to her discovery of the pill of immortality.\n\nHistorical annals record that the Queen Mother of the West appeared as a virtuous, compassionate and ageless beauty during the reigns of Huangdi, King Mu of the Zhou Dynasty and Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty.\n\nIn the Eastern Sea section of The Canon of Mountains and Seas, it says: “On Snake Witch Mountain, there is someone who holds a sceptre and lives on the eastern side, although some say she lives on tortoise mountain.(1) She is the Western Queen Mother. She stands on the terrace carrying a victory staff. To her south are three green birds which gather food for her. This is to the north of Kunlun void.” The “victory staff’ is not a walking stick but a decorative ornament woven from fragrant grass. It is possible that: later generations took this staff for a walking stick and therefore conjured her to be a an old hag.\n\nFrom the tomb of King Xiang of Wei, certain “records on bamboo” were excavated, including a section entitled King Mu of Zhou. It reads: “In the seventeenth year, the king travelled west to Kunlun. He saw the Queen Mother of the West that year for she was invited to the court as a distinguished palace guest .\n\nThis means that when King Mu travelled to the Kunlun mountains, he found that the Queen Mother of the West was celebrated as a local deity. On his return, he began to worship her at his Chao Palace.\n\nIn the Biographies of the Immortals, Wang Shizhen of the Ming Dynasty penned a song in her honour when she attended the feasts hosted by King Mu:\n\n“White clouds in the sky,\n\nThe forest grows on\n\nits own accord,\n\nThe road is endless,\n\nBetween the mountains and the water,\n\nShe who will never die,\n\nCan still return.”\n\nFrom this it can be assumed that the Queen Mother of the West was well-known. Kunlun mountains are in western China and as leader of all the celestial maidens of the western region, she was respected as a mother — the mother of all Living creatures. Perhaps the name “Queen Mother of the West” is derived from these legendary aspects.\n\nDuring the reign of Han Emperor Wu ( 140-86 BC), the Queen Mother of the West boarded her chariot of purple clouds and travelled to the imperial palace with an entourage of celestial maidens, her green birds flying in front to clear the path.\n\nEmperor Wu watched in awe and then rushed outside to greet his guests. During the feast held in her honour, she commanded her celestial maidens to sing and dance. Taking out seven flat peaches, she offered them to Emperor Wu. Having eaten one of the peaches, the emperor was about to discard the seed when the Queen Mother of the West took it from him saying: “These trees bear fruit only once every three thousand years, the peach stones are not for the world of man.” With that, she ordered her entourage to bring the seed back to Heaven.\n\nEmperor Wu saw that she had the power to give orders to the celestial maidens and consequently believed that she must also be the dowager mother of all celestial beings.\n\nIt is also said that she was the wife of Great Emperor Yu, the Eastern Emperor, and that together, they presided over the entire Heavenly Court.\n\nSunü\n\nIn remote antiquity, within the land surrounding Chengdu to a distance of three hundred li(1), there was once a girl who used music to benefit mankind; a celestial maiden who had power to promote prosperity and growth. This girl is also the earliest example of a female master of the qin(2) in China’s historical records.\n\nAccording to legend, Sunü was Huangdi’s(3) maid and she perfected the art of the se(4.) The qins made by the Paoxi tribe had fifty strings. When Huangdi asked Sunü to play a Paoxiqin, he found the sound clamorous and discordant.\n\nHuangdi therefore ordered Sunü to remove twenty-five strings. When she played the instrument again, the music was sweet and soothing. Huangdi commanded Sunü to reside in Chengdu and play the qin the whole year round because his cherished son, Houji, was buried in the fields surrounding Chengdu. Houji, a god of agriculture, had loved to listen to Sunü play the qin when he was alive.\n\nSunü plucked the qin gently, creating melodies and throughout the four seasons, the fields of Chengdu seemed to be covered with a glorious brocade; one hundred different crops sprang up unaided; water was plentiful and the grass lush; nothing withered in winter or summer and one hundred beasts lived side by side in harmony. In winter, the music from the qin would stir a warm breeze; in summer, it would summon refreshing showers. The sound of the qin transformed the region into a land worthy of the name “Land of Plenty”(5)\n\nIn Qingcheng Mountain, which is near to Chengdu, there is a place called ‘Jade Girl Cave” Legend has it that Sunü would visit this cave to rest. It is said that even today, Sunü is present in the open fields of Sichuan.\n\n1. 1 li= 0.5 km\n\n2. An instrument similar to the zither.\n\n3. Huangdi, the Yellow Emperor of the Legendary Era.\n\n4. A se is a kind of qin which has twenty-five strings.\n\n5. “Land of Plenty” or “Tianfu zhi guo” is a traditional name for Sichuan province of which Chengdu is the capital.\n\nFufei\n\nThe legendary Emperor Fuxi had a daughter who was very delicate and sickly. Fragile and lonely, she was like a tender sapling swaying in the breeze. All who knew her believed that she would be a great beauty one day, yet her father paid her little attention.There were two reasons for his indifference: firstly, Fuxi had many daughters. Secondly, he preferred plump, robust women like his sister and his wife, Nuwa.\n\nFuxi’s daughter, free to roam in the very bosom of nature, gradually matured to womanhood with the almost imperceptible passage of time. Although she. had a pure heart to match her great beauty, Fuxi’s daughter was often melancholic.\n\nOne day, she came to the banks of the Luo River, a tributary of the Yellow River, The girl’s loveliness and sorrowful expressions intrigued the Luo River so much so that it began to woo her. Ripples appeared on the water and mist, like fine gauze, rose up from the surface and created the illusion of countless enchanting scenes. The girl saw river banks crowded with blossom trees; cliffs soaring skywards from deep, still pools; tiny rivulets like silver threads; mountainous waves, craggy peaks, gorges and long stretches of sandy beaches. Mesmerised, Fuxi’s daughter gave herself to the water’s embrace and was pulled down into its depths.\n\nAfter some time, Fuxi noticed that one of his daughters was missing and went in search of her. Arriving at the Luo River, he noticed a slight ripple on the water. To his astonishment, he saw a woman of matchless beauty rise up and hover above the surface. Fixing her gaze on him, the lady gave a slight smile. Fuxi recognised her as his daughter, but only now was he aware of her flawless beauty. He chastised himself for having neglected to love her as a father should. The girl, however, could not be separated from the river. Fuxi, to make amends for his past behaviour, gave his daughter the title Luoshen, meaning Goddess Of The Luo.\n\nWhen the Yellow River Deity made a tour of his domain, he met and fell in love with the Goddess and took her as a concubine, naming her Luofei or Concubine Luo. The name Luofei became Mifei because her father’s alias was Mixi.\n\nMifei is celebrated in Chinese literature as a woman of physical and spiritual beauty. Countless verses singing her praises have been composed, such as Sima Xiangru’s Shanglin Fu , Yang Xilong’s Ganquan Fu, Xie Lingyun’s Chenfei Fu, Li Gang’s Lianhua Fu, Song Zhiwen’s Qiulian Fu, Li Shangyin’s Dong A Wang, Wen Tingyun’s Lianhua Shi, Wang Daokun’s Luoshui Bei and Caozhi’s Luoshen Fu from which the following excerpt is taken:\n\n“Gazing upon her from a distance;\n\nBright as the sun\n\nOver rosy morning clouds.\n\nStep nearer, look more closely,\n\nShe shimmers like a lotus\n\nAbove the waves.\n\nNeither thick-set nor frail,\n\nNeither tall nor short\n\nHer shoulders seem scripted,\n\nHer waist narrow\n\nAs if bound.\n\nThe graceful curve of her long neck\n\nReveals the white flesh of her throat.\n\nThere is no need for perfume here,\n\nNo need for leaden powder.”\n\nMomu\n\nThere are many women who are remembered for their extraordinary beauty, but few are celebrated for their extreme ugliness. The reputation of a beauty may last thousands of years but the same is true for an ugly lady. Momu was one exceptionally ugly woman who has been revered in Chinese literature.\n\nMomu lived during the reign of Huangdi, the Yellow Emperor. She was born with a startling appearance: her head was shaped like a hammer, her cheekbones were high and protuberant, and her cheeks were sunken. Her eyes were tiny and triangular, her mouth too large and her overall complexion was dark. On top of these facial defects, she was hunch-backed and clubfooted. When strangers saw her, they would scurry away. Poor Momu spent most of her childhood being bullied or ignored.\n\nDespite this cruel treatment, Momu grew up to be kind-hearted, diligent and sensible. Her sincerity, honesty and efforts to make others happy won people over gradually. Those around her began to look beyond her physical appearance and came to accept and love her. Despite her good nature, Momu still had not received any marriage enquiries by the age of twenty. People who knew her would sigh and say:\n\n“That poor ugly girl, she’ll never find a husband. ”\n\nOne day, when Huangdi was touring his domain, he came across a group of peasant girls picking mulberry leaves. Suddenly, one of the girls cried out and fell to the ground. Her hand had been bitten by a snake. Her friends became hysterical and none knew what to do.\n\nAs the emperor watched, a young girl of hideous appearance came onto the scene. When she realised what had happened, she quickly told two of the girls to go and fetch some fresh water. Then, she gave the other girls a list of medicinal herbs and told them to find the herbs and bring them back. Tearing a strip of cloth from her skirt, she deftly made a tourniquet which she tightened around the girl’s arm. Finally, taking a hairpin from her hair, she opened up the wound, knelt over the girl, and sucked out the poison.\n\nHuangdi told his men to see if they could be of help while he continued to observe the ugly girl. He was astonished by her courage, the way she took command and how people followed her instructions. When he enquired who she was, he was told chat she was the “ugly girl Momu”\n\nTo everyone’s surprise, Huangdi took Momu back to his palace, She was put in charge of all the palace ladies, a role which Momu performed successfully.\n\nHuangdi always took several concubines with him whenever he toured his realm. On one of these tours, his favourite concubine, Liezu, fell ill and died. The emperor wanted to have Liezu buried and revered as an ancestor. The elaborate preparations for this ceremony were supervised by Momu. Not only was Momu able to arrange fitting sacrifices and a funeral bier, her hideous appearance was believed to keep evil spirits at bay.\n\nEvidence of how Momu was revered can still be found today. If you look above the doorways of some peasant homes, you may well see a painting, or a mask depicting a woman of extraordinary ugliness. This is a likeness of Momu and its purpose is to ward off evil spirits.\n\nCannü, the Silkworm Girl\n\nSichuan was the seat of ancient China’s silkworm rearing region. The founding monarch of Sichuan was called Cansi, which means silk, and his greatest achievement was to teach his subjects how to rear silkworms and spin silk. However, it is not he who is revered by the people as the “Silkworm Deity”. That privilege was given to a common country girl who is known only as Cannü, which means “silkworm girl”.\n\nAccording to legend, during the reign of Emperor Gaoxin, Sichuan was inhabited by many different clans. Each clan had its own territory and as there was no central leader, the region lacked a sense of unity. Conflicts often arose between rival clans.\n\nIn this turbulent region lived an attractive girl who had just reached marriageable age. Her father was abducted during one of the many battles. More than a year passed by and still, there was no word from him. The girl, with only her father’s horse to comfort her, missed him so much that she became gravely ill. Her mother, fearing that she may lose her daughter as well, made a proclamation:\n\n“Whoever brings my daughter’s father home will have her hand in marriage!”\n\nAll the young men in the area were enamoured of this girl and, prompted by her mother’s promise, searched far and wide for her lost father. None was able to find him. Then one day, the horse struggled free of its rope and galloped off into the distance. Several days later, the animal returned, carrying the girl’s father home safely.\n\nIt was obvious that the horse had run off to look for his master and so the local people declared that the animal must have a soul. As a reward, the master gave his horse extra fodder but the horse behaved in a most peculiar manner. At first it refused to eat and drink, and then, each time the girl walked past, it would rear its body and cause a commotion. The girl’s father became suspicious and asked his daughter if she knew the reason for its strange behaviour. Unable to hide the truth, the girl told her father about her mother’s promise.\n\nThe man was outraged by what his daughter had told him and shouted:\n\n“Who will bethroth their daughter to a beast?”\n\nWhen the horse heard these angry words, it began to whine and kick. The girl’s father was furious. Snarling and gnashing his teeth, he killed the animal. When the horse had died, the animal was skinned and its hide hung in the doorway to dry in the sun.\n\nOne day, as the girl passed by the doorway, the horse’s hide rose up, enveloped the girl and carried her off to the sky. Finding his daughter gone, her father went in search of her. After searching for ten days without success, he noticed a curious object hanging in a huge mulberry tree. Stepping closer, he discovered that it was the horse’s hide, which had changed into a cocoon. Inside the cocoon was his daughter who had transformed into a silkworm.\n\nAfter this, a girl was often seen riding through Sichuan on horseback. She would stop from time to time and teach the people how to raise silkworms and grow mulberry trees as these worms feed on their leaves. When asked, she would say: “Heaven has conferred this task on me so that I may never forget what it is to be just.” She is the fabled Silkworm Girl.\n\nThe Princess of Xiang\n\nIn the area where the Xiang River flows through the “Lotus Country”, there is a place called Jiuyi Shan(1) The sides of this mountain are thick with emerald green bamboo which nod and sway in the breeze. Local people have a tender affection for this plant as its spotted pattern evokes the memory of an age-old love story.\n\nThe bamboo is known as Xiangfeizhuz(2). Legend has it that the spots splashed on the stalk of the plant for eternity were the tears of the two Princesses of Xiang.\n\nThe Xiang Consorts or Princesses were E’huang and Nuying. They were the daughters of King Yao and grew up on the banks of the Xiang River, planting rice and gathering lotuses, work which they loved to do. King Yao appointed them Princesses of Xiang and they governed the Xiang River region.\n\nYao was a wise king. Amongst his subjects was a young man called Shun whose father was old and blind; and whose stepmother was reckless and deaf. Shun had one half-brother called Xiang, who was an idle fellow but the apple of his mother’s eye. Shun himself was a diligent and capable young man who attended to his father’s needs and kept the home in good condition. King Yao observed the fine character of this competent young man and appointed him to administer the locality. He also gave the hands of his two precious daughters to Shun in marriage.\n\nEach day E’huang and Nuying tilled the fields and looked after Shun’s father. They also assisted their husband in his administrative duties.\n\nShun earned the ardent support of the people under him and King Yao made him his successor, eventually abdicating in his son-in-law’s favour. When Shun became king, E’huang became queen and Nuying was appointed concubine. Shun consulted his ladies over all matters of grave national importance and his subjects had the highest esteem for their wise council.\n\nUnfortunately, King Shun fell ill and died in the wilds of Cangwu while on a tour of inspection. When the two sisters heard the news, they were inconsolable. Their bitter tears fell upon the bamboo and, stroking the stalks, they made a dying wish:\n\n“May these stems forever bear the inscription of our eternal grief.”\n\nThen, for the sake of their lost love, they threw themselves into the Xiang River and drowned.\n\nWhen future generations gazed at this bamboo, they still recalled the wise and virtuous king and the two loyal Princesses of Xiang.\n\n1. Jiuyi Shan is also known as Nine-Maze Mountain due to the presence of nine streams. It was said that the similarity of the terrain around these rivers had caused travellers much confusion, from Classical Chinese Myths.\n\n2. Xiangfeizhu literally means “bamboo of the Xiang Consorts”; it is now translated as “mottled bamboo”.\n\nChang’e\n\nChang’e was originally called Changxi but as the characters for “er” and “xi” had similar pronunciation in classical Chinese, later generations have confused the two. She is said to have been the daughter of Emperor Ku. As a young girl, she was already extremely beautiful, but she was also known to be taciturn, proud and aloof.\n\nAccording to legend, during the reign of King Yao, ten suns appeared in the sky. The heat from these suns dried up the land, withered the plants and threatened the lives of men and beasts. King Yao had in his service, an archer of great skill named Houyi who used his bow and arrows to shoot down nine of the suns, thus saving the earth from destruction. As a result of this deed, Houyi became a hero. King Yao was prepared to reward Houyi with whatever he desired. For many years Houyi had loved Chang’e but her formidable pride and noble birth had forced him to admire her from afar. However, seeing that King Yao was sincere and would fulfil his dearest wish, Houyi plucked up courage to request for Chang’e’s hand in marriage. The king happily obliged.\n\nAfter taking Chang’e as his wife, Houyi treated her like a priceless treasure, doing all he could to please her, and showered her with tender affection. Chang’e, however, treated her husband with cold indifference. The truth was that Chang’e thought herself to be the most beautiful woman on earth and firmly believed that not even the most eminent of men would be worthy of her respect.\n\nIn order to guard against the calamity of the ten suns from being repeated in history, the Queen Mother of the West gave Houyi a pill of immortality. When Chang’e learned of this priceless gift, she thought to herself:\n\n“Surely only a divine and radiant maiden like myself deserves to be immortal!”\n\nAnd so, one night, unknown to Houyi, Chang’e stole the magic pill and swallowed it down whole. Much to her surprise. no sooner had she taken the pill than she began to float upwards immediately. She drifted out of the window and up through the sky all the way to the desolate and deserted Palace Of The Moon.\n\nTo teach Chang’e a lesson, the Queen Mother of the West transformed her into a toad. This is the toad which sits in the Palace Of`The Moon and pounds the medicine for another pill of immortality with a pestle. Innumerable springs and autumns have passed since Chang’e’s flight into exile. Yet on the drifting moon, in the boundless sky, the toad, once a beautiful woman, is still pounding steadily away at the medicine which will never crumble. Spurned by gods and humans, it wearily raised its wooden pestle.\n\nChang’e had her wish granted; to gaze down from an exalted height for all eternity and scoff at the muddled lives of ordinary men. However, one wonders, does she now perhaps regret her former pride!\n\nYaoji\n\nYaoji is said to be the daughter of Chidi, a deity of South China. Her name, Yao, means Precious Jade, which in Chinese mythology would imply that she was an exquisite girl. There is a belief that those who are born beautiful are often ill-fated: Yaoji was destined never to reach old age. Following her untimely death, her body was buried in the south side of Wushan.(1)\n\nAt one time, King Huai of Chu went on a pleasure trip to the Gaotang Plateau by Yunmeng Lake (in present-day Hebei). Feeling tired, he lay down on a terrace to sleep. In his dream, he met a young girl who called herself “the woman of Wushan”. The girl recognised the heroic bearing of King Huai and, taking pity on his solitude, lay down and shared her mat and pillow with him. The two became deeply enamored with each other. When time came for them to part, the girl told the king:\n\n“My home is on the south side of Wushan, by a craggy precipice near the peak. I am the rose-tinted cloud that you see in the morning, and the fine twilight rain. Morning and evening, I shall hover here for eternity, waiting for you.” This dream maiden was Yaoji. When King Huai awoke from this illusory joy, he felt a tragic sense of loss. Unable to forget the ethereal image, he had a temple constructed on the spot where he had slept and called it the Temple of the Morning Cloud. The prayers and sacrifices in this temple were dedicated to Yaoji.\n\nSong Yu, a Chu man of letters, was so moved by this tale that he composed a grandiose and sentimental poem called Gao Tang Fu, which is still popular today.\n\nThe legacy and popularity of this story is clearly visible in the many idioms it spawned, such as: The Gaotang Dream , The Passion Of Clouds And Rain, Clouds And Rain Of Wushan(2). All these refer to the intimate relations between a man and a woman.\n\nAnother reference to Yaoji is made in the Song Dynasty work, The Taiping Miscellany. In this version, it is said that she was the daughter of the Queen Mother of the West and was also known as Yunhua Furen or Madam Cloud Splendour. She is reputed to have met King Yu(3) of Xia at Wushan and taught him how to control the floods which ravaged the land. Researchers were, however, unable to conclude whether these two girls were the same person. Celestial consorts of old often took delight in helping mankind and in this respect, the two girls are certainly alike.\n\n1.Wushan or “Witch Mountain” has long been associated with various celestial maidens.\n\n2.Indeed “Clouds and Rain” has become a synonym for love-making.\n\n3.Yu, the great legendary founder of the Xia Dynasty, is credited with subduing the Great Flood.\n\nMeixi\n\nWhen King Jie of Xia(1) led a punitive mission into the state of Shi, the people of Shi gave him a tribute gift; a woman called Meixi. King Jie took her back with him for his harem.\n\nIt is true that the harem of King Jie housed innumerable beauties and all of them were gentle and refined in accordance with the fashion of the court. Meixi was obviously very different from these ladies. Her home, the state of Shi, was a backward and barbarous nation and Meixi had the wild and unruly nature of her homeland. Her manner was forthright and her dressing masculine. She always carried a great sabre at her waist and would come and go as she pleased. King Jie, a notorious womaniser, was attracted by Meixi’s untamed spirit and together they indulged in wanton pleasures. He pillaged his country for women of every description to add to his harem. Singers, dwarfs and jesters were gathered at the court to provide constant entertainment. King Jie even ordered that a landscape be created with a “lake of wine” and a great “forest of meat”. All these were built with Slave labour and when the lake was completed, the king and Meixi would sail around on a little boat. Court officials were ordered to throw themselves into the lake and, urged on by the beats of a drum, they would drink with great abandon. Many unfortunate subjects would drink themselves into a stupor and drown in the lake. When Meixi saw a body sinking, she would clap her hands with joy. King Jie paid little attention to the administration of his country. On the few occasions that he did attend a government session, Meixi was always at his side, giving confusing and unreasonable advice.\n\nA revolt led by the dukes and marquises created an opportunity for King Tang to overthrow the dynasty. King Jie’s army refused to put up any resistance and was easily beaten. Meixi and King Jie were put in their tiny boat and cast into the high seas.\n\nBlack clouds enveloped them as the sky became dark and thunderous. The boat was tossed around by mountainous waves. Looking up to the heavens in remorse and despair, King Jie held on to Meixi who struggled free from his grip. Suddenly, she looked at him straight in the eye with a coldness which was quite out of her character and asked in a slow deliberate voice: “How does it feel to lose a nation?”\n\nA huge wave crashed over the boat; Meixi was swept away. Struck by the next monstrous wave, the vessel capsized; boat and king disappeared without a trace.\n\n1. King Jie, the legendary last emperor of the Xia Dynasty (2100-1600 BC), is said to have reigned from 1818-1766 BC.\n\nDaji\n\nMeixi speeded the downfall of the Xia Dynasty.The Shang or Yin Dynasty(1) which succeeded the Xia was also destroyed by a legendary femme fatale, Daji (d. 1122BC). Daji was the daughter of the King of Su. When King Zhou of Yin ( 1154-1122 BC)carried out a punitive expedition on the state of Su, he received Daji as a tribute from her father.\n\nA bewitching beauty and a shrewd woman, Daji soon became King Zhou’s favourite. According to the Biographies of Eminent Women, King Zhou indulged in merry-making and after Daji’s arrival at the court, he seldom let her stray from his side. Her influence became paramount; were she to praise a courtier, he would undoubtedly experience a meteoric rise in status and more likely than not, end up being a member of the nobility. On the other hand, those unfortunate enough to receive a word of criticism would be executed on King Zhou’s orders. These indiscriminate promotions and executions would be carried out on the spot.\n\nThe decadence of the Yin court far exceeded that of the Xia Dynasty under King Jie and Meixi. The palace would resound with music as Daji dazzled the king with dances of erotic abandon. She ordered that a “lake of wine” and a “forest of meat” be built in which men and women were commanded to wander about naked and indulge in amorous pleasures,\n\nAs the shameless excesses of the court increase the lives of the common people were plunged further into misery and suffering. The population seethed with discontentment. King Zhou, aware of his subjects dissatisfaction, invented a “roasting torture” in the hope that this would silence dissent. A large copper pole, liberally smeared with grease, was erected in the market place. A fire would be lit at the base of the pole. The unfortunate offender would then have to hug the top of the pole with a all his might to prevent himself from falling into the fire. The criminal’s hands, feet and belly would begin to burn and scorch. Finally, drained of strength and unable to endure the pain any longer, the victim would inevitably release his hold and be engulfed by the fire raging below.\n\nDaji delighted in the “roasting torture” and would always be present to enjoy the spectacle. When each victim finally gave up and was consumed by the flames, Daji would explode with raucous laughter.\n\nOn one occasion, an uncle of the king, named Bigan, reprimanded his nephew, saying: “You heed only the words of that woman and you do nothing but damage pour reputation as a king. Take my word – disaster is bound to strike!”\n\nDaji learned of his complaint and, with a smile on her lips, told him: “I have heard that the hearts of great sages are remarkable in that they have seven apertures.Today I have a mind to find out if that is true!” Bigan’s chest was ripped open there and then.\n\nWhen King Wu of Zhou led his army against Yin, King Zhou’s forces refused to fight in his defence. Realising that the situation was beyond hope, King Zhou threw himself into a fire and burned to death.\n\nKing Wu captured Daji and decapitated her. Displaying her severed head for all to see, he stuck a white flag in it which read: “The woman who killed King Zhou!”\n\n1. The dynastic title of the Shang Dynasty (1600-1100 BC) was changed to Yin around 1400 BC and so it is also known as the Yin Dynasty, King Zhou was the last emperor of Yin.\n\nFuhao\n\nThe first woman to appear in China’s written history is Fuhao, wife of Shang Dynasty sovereign Wuding (1324-1265 BC). Many bones and tortoise shell inscriptions from the Shang Dynasty bear her name; not only because she was the wife of the king, but also because she was a prominent political and military figure in her own right.\n\nDuring Shang times, religious sacrifices and divination were considered essential political activities. Sacrifices were offered to Heaven, Earth and ancestors. Among other things, spirits were believed to help ensure the success of military expeditions, ward off sicknesses, keep misfortunes at bay and guard against all kinds of calamities. Religious rites were always presided over by members of the slave-owning class; the highest echelon of society. The most prominent member of this class was Fuhao, who frequently oversaw these ceremonies on behalf of the king.\n\nA large number of the Shang Dynasty bronzes unearthed in China, including the first food vessel, were inscribed with the characters, “Fuhao”. It can be surmised that she must have occupied an exalted position during her lifetime.\n\nExcavations of Shang ruins have also unearthed many tortoise shells which bear inscriptions, believed to be written by Fuhao herself, indicating that she had practiced divination.\n\nDuring Shang times, the nation’s main concerns were si (sacrifices to the gods), and rong (military affairs).There is extensive documentation of Fuhao’s decisive role in the military campaigns of the Shang. Under orders from King Wuding, she led Shang troops against the Tu tribe in the north, the He tribe in the south-west, the south-eastern state of Yi and the state of Qiang in the north-west.\n\nOne oracle inscription reads : “Fuhao’s 3,000) gathered, and 10,000, a great expedition…” This refers to the campaign launched against the state of Qiang, in which Fuhao commanded a regular army of 3,000 and an additional force numbering 10,000 soldiers. Fuhao, therefore, rode at the head of an army of 10,000, a colossal military force at the time. Four copper battle axes engraved with her name have been recovered from her tomb in Anyang, Henan province – two big and two small. Such axes were used by the Shang to symbolise extensive military authority and power.\n\nFuhao was extremely wealthy. Like other great statesmen, she governed her own fiefdom and possessed a large collection of treasures: bronze ware, jade artifacts and cowrie shells; all of which were symbols of wealth and power. She also owned many slaves. Her tomb contained more than 400 bronzes, 7,000 cowrie shells and 16 human sacrifices.\n\nKing Wuding outlived Fuhao. After her death, he frequently offered sacrifices to her spirit, requesting her help in overcoming his enemies. After his death, his descendants did not place Fuhao in his tomb with his other concubines. Her grave remained apart and she was worshipped in her own right,\n\nThe Shang Dynasty’s slave society had a tradition of matrilineal and matriarchal customs which undoubtedly helped Fuhao to wield power openly. However, with the widespread acceptance of the feudal patriarchal system, women were subjected to the rule of gods, ancestors and their husbands. Apart from the few who usurped the throne, no Chinese woman, other than Fuhao, has ever played such a decisive role in state affairs.\n\nBaosi\n\nIt is strange that imperial concubines were blamed for the destruction of three consecutive dynasties: the Xia, Shang and Zhou. It’s stranger that all three of these beauties came from minor states which were defeated by the kings who took them to be their concubines, the empires of which these beauties subsequently ruined.\n\nBaosi (d. 771 BC) was the favourite of King You, the last emperor of the Western Zhou Dynasty. Because of his obsession for her, the Western Zhou Dynasty was destroyed.\n\nThe state of Bao was a small country. It sent a group of pretty slave girls to King You in an attempt to win his friendship. Amongst the slaves was Baosi. She caught the eye of the king immediately for he was fascinated by her look of cold indifference. The king’s harem was a gaggle of sycophantic ladies who would do anything to please him. In contrast, this ice maiden appeared particularly seductive. Baosi bore the king a son, Bofu. The king, overjoyed, made her his empress and her child the crown prince. His existing wife, Empress Shen, and her son, Crown Prince Yijiu, were cast out.\n\nBaosi had ascended to the nobility in a single bound. She enjoyed a life of luxury but still she never smiled. King You tried everything he could to make her smile but to no avail. It was said that Baosi’s maids once remarked that her rare smile was unlike those of ordinary women for it contained a multitude of emotions and charms. Hearing this, King You came up with a plan. He ordered that the warning beacon be lit and the war drum sounded. Hearing the alarm, the dukes and marquises thought that enemies were invading the country. In great haste, they gathered their troops and reported to the king. Inside the city, the people remained calm, but those outside were thrown into a flurry of panic and confusion. When Baosi saw the commotion, she smiled coolly; King You was ecstatic. When the dukes and marquises came to him for instructions, the king said:\n\n“There is no invading army, all I wanted to do was to make Baosi laugh!”\n\nFrom then on, King You would light the beacon and raise the war alarm according to his whims and fancies. The noblemen would summon their troops only to be told to return home. After this had happened several times, the dukes and marquises grew weary of putting up with such ridicule and refused to respond to the king’s summons.\n\nNot long after, the father of the deposed Empress Shen, in collusion with a minority tribe from the western regions, staged an invasion. King You raised the war cry but no one came to save him. In desperation, he fled the city with Baosi, only to be put to death at Lishan.\n\nThis foolish monarch who “lit the beacon to mock dukes and marquises” was not widely mourned. Baosi, however, emerged relatively free of guilt.\n\nZhinü, the Girl Weaver\n\nGaze up to where the heavenly river (the Milky Way) traverses the night sky and you will see a constellation of five small stars on the east bank. This is Vega, the star of Zhinü, the Girl Weaver. Opposite her, on the distant west bank is Altair, the star of Niulang, the Cowherd, shining brilliantly through the ages – lonely, waiting.\n\nThe legend of Zhinü is the first recorded story in which a common working woman came to be symbolised as a deity. According to legend, Zhinü was the daughter of Tiandi, the Emperor of Heaven. She was envious of the blissful and harmonious life of mortals who laboured each day; men tilling the fields, women spinning and weaving cloths. As soon as she could, she descended secretly to Earth where she married the honest and industrious Niulang from the Li clan. Every day, Zhinü worked at her loom, weaving cloths of such exquisite beauty that everyone wanted to own it. After some time, Tiandi discovered that his daughter had run away from the heavenly court and he was furious. In a rage, he ordered his celestial guards to go down to Earth and bring her back. With the help of a divine ox, Niulang managed to follow his wife right up to the sky, only to find himself cut off from her by the heavenly river. Unable to cross to the east, he reluctantly admitted defeat and stayed alone on the west bank.\n\nBack in her father’s palace, Zhinü wept constantly and grew thinner and weaker by the day. Still, her father turned a blind eye to her suffering. One day, the Queen Mother of the West saw Zhinü, like a fading blossom, standing by a window facing west, gazing steadily into the distance. On hearing the young girl’s story, the Queen Mother of the West was so moved that she wept. She went to Tiandi and pleaded on the girl’s behalf. Tiandi eventually relented and gave the lovers permission to meet, but only for one day each year.\n\nAccording to the seventh day of the seventh month of the Chinese calendar, as evening approaches, thousands of magpies bearing twigs in their beaks would fly up to the heavenly river and form a bridge. From both banks, Niulang and Zhinü would rush impetuously towards each other and meet in the middle, pouring out their heartfelt feelings for each other.\n\n“In the distance is the Cowherd star,\n\nAcross the shimmering river sits his maid.\n\nDelicately raising her fair hand\n\nShe works with her loom.\n\nAll day long she weeps\n\nHer tears falling like rain.\n\nThe river is clear and shallow,\n\nHow many times have they crossed\n\nand returned?\n\nMeeting above the water\n\nwith hearts so full of emotions\n\nThey need no words”.\n\nZhinü, who followed her heart, is\n\nburdened with a bitter destiny.\n\nNiulang can find comfort thus:\n\n“Delicate clouds frolic,\n\nShooting stars tell of regret,\n\nThe silver river is remote and hazy.\n\nGolden wind, dew of jade, they meet by chance,\n\nA sight too lovely for the mortal world.\n\nEmotions flow like water,\n\nA dream-like meeting time,\n\nThe magpie bridge, the pathway back\n\nIs a sight too cruel for words.\n\nIf our mutual love is everlasting,\n\nLet’s not fear that we’re not together,\n\nAll day long.”\n\nOver thousands of years, the story of the Cowherd and the Girl Weaver has been told in every household. People gaze up at the river of stars, their hearts harbouring one thought: the hope that the lovers will be reunited soon.\n\nConsort Fan\n\nFirst there was Bo’le, and then “the horse that runs one thousand li.” Yet for the emperors of ancient times, if men like Bo’le were hard to find, women were even more so. The emperor’s harem was usually filled with ladies taught to smile and flatter; few would take the risk of offering straightforward and honest advice.\n\nConsort Fan, a concubine of King Zhuang of Chu, appears in Biographies of Eminent Women in the section entitled Wise and Virtuous. Her wise counsel contributed a great deal to King Zhuang’s success as a statesman. King Zhuang was inordinately fond of hunting, often abandoning important affairs of the state to go on expeditions. Consort Fan begged him to stop but he would not listen, so the determined lady stopped eating meat. King Zhuang doted on Consort Fan. When he saw her refusing food, he began to lose interest in hunting and gradually turned his attention to matters of the state.\n\nWithin a short time, King Zhuang became so absorbed in state affairs that he frequently forgot to eat and sleep. Consort Fan noticed the king’s deep absorption in his work and sought for an opportunity to offer him some tactful advice.\n\nAs King Zhuang returned to his palace late one night, Consort Fan asked him: “Aren’t you exhausting yourself, coming home so late night after night?” King Zhuang answered contentedly: “I shall never feel weary as long as I have a wise man with whom I can discuss my affairs.” Consort Fan was surprised: “Who is this wise man'” “Yu Qiuzi!” said the king.\n\nWhen Consort Fan heard the name, she laughed despite herself. King Zhuang looked at her with astonishment but she spoke up with fervour: “I have served you for eleven years and have spared no efforts to look for able men to assist you. I have even sent envoys to Zheng and Wei to enlist the wisest men to be your counsellors. Yet never have I wished to monopolise your favour as I feared that my personal considerations may distract your attention on state matters.\n\n“Yu Qiuzi, however, has been your prime minister for a decade and all the men he has recommended to you throughout that time have been members of his own clique. Don’t you see that he is deceiving you? He is in fact, preventing wise men from coming forward to offer counsel. Where then is his loyalty? Where is his virtue?”\n\nKing Zhuang listened but hesitated to reply. He later told Yu Qiuzi of Consort Fan’s accusations. The prime minister felt so ashamed that he resigned, recommending Sun Shu’ao to take his place and assist King Zhuang in the ruling of the state.\n\nDu Sanniang\n\nThe most intelligent people are those of humble birth. Moke Huixi records a journey made by Confucius through the state of Wei which proved the truth of this saying.\n\nDuring the Spring and Autumn Period, Confucius, seeking an official appointment, took Zigong and Zilu with him to the state of Chen. En route, they travelled through the state of Wei where the scenery was very pleasant. Mulberry and willow trees lined their path.\n\nConfucius was in a happy mood and he began to recite: “The branches in the south are gentle and graceful, those in the north long …” His verses were interrupted suddenly by the song of a woman picking mulberry leaves by the side of the road. She sang: “The master travelling to Chu will certainly run out of provisions.” Confucius did not reply but began to walk with a slower step. The woman continued her song: “He will not know how to thread the bright pearl with nine holes, but he can return and ask the woman who plucks mulberry leaves.”\n\nConfucius had no idea as to how to interpret these words, nor did he seek an explanation. Eventually he did indeed face near starvation between Cai and Chen. Confucius and his disciples arrived at Chen. The Marquis of Chen had heard that Confucius was a sage and decided to put him to the test. Taking out a pearl, he said: “This is a bright nine-hole pearl. Inside it are nine holes, on the surface only two at opposite ends. Please thread this pearl for me.” Confucius was baffled. To gain a little time, he said: “Please give me three days to think of a solution, by which time I shall certainly have threaded it.” The Marquis of Chu consented.\n\nReturning to their lodgings, Confucius and his disciples pondered over the problem. Suddenly Confucius ordered Zigong to get his horse ready. He said: “Do you remember the woman who was gathering mulberries? She had great foresight. I am sure she knows the answer. Zigong, you must go and ask her for her advice!”\n\nZigong rode all day and night until he arrived at the country lane in the state of Wei. When he got to the area where the mulberries grew, there was no sign of the woman. Looking around, he could only see four mounds of mud between the trees. They were more than one chi apart from each other. Zigong asked himself what the scene could signify:\n\n“Mulberry trees have wood, mud is earth, could it be that her surname is Du?” At her side are three more mounds, could her name be “Sanniang?” Zigong asked a woodcutter for directions. Following his instructions, Zigong found Du Sanniang.\n\nZigong told her about the dilemma and she laughed, saying: “It is not difficult. Just take a silk thread and tie it around an ant. Coat the thread with oil so that it is slick and smooth and then let the ant crawl through the small hole in the middle of the pearl, slowly releasing the silk thread. If the ant stops moving forward, blow a little smoke into the hole to encourage it. That is how you thread a pearl with nine holes.”\n\nZigong thanked Du Sanniang and rushed back to inform Confucius. Confucius followed her advice and, sure enough, was able to pass the silk thread through the pearl.\n\nSome time later, Confucius asked Zigong: “Did you ask the woman how she came to know that we would encounter difficulties; and the problem of the nine-hole pearl'”\n\nZigong replied: “She should easily have known that Cai and Chen had several successive years of bad harvest. Threading the pearl with nine holes is a test which the Marquis of Chen likes to use to mock wise men. She must have heard of it.” Having listened attentively to these words, Confucius said: “The wisest people are those of lowly birth! You should never belittle women!”\n\nA Woman Advisor in the Wilds of Chu\n\nDuring the Spring and Autumn Period (770 – 476BC), there were more than one hundred schools of thought in China, each with its strong following. Eloquent men, adept in the art of reasoning, used their persuasive powers to advise rulers which school was the best. Many gained official titles in the process. It was not only men who used their skills to protect their country. History books record the case of A Female Advisor in the Wilds of Chu, in which a woman spoke out fearlessly and by doing so, saved her country.\n\nDuke Jian of the state of Zheng sent one of his senior officials as an envoy to the state of Chu. As this was an urgent task, his carriage was driven as swiftly as the wind, scattering all those in its path like startled chickens. Eventually, he came to a narrow track in the Chu wilderness. Ahead of him, and travelling in the same direction, the official saw a cart driven by a woman. He spurred his horse to overtake the cart, but as he drew alongside, there was a sharp crack and his carriage came to an abrupt halt. The wheel hubs of the two vehicles were jammed together, causing the wheel axle on the official’s carriage to snap.\n\nThe official was livid. He jumped down from his carriage brandishing a horse whip, intending to flog the woman. However, she appeared quite composed. She sat quietly, frowning coldly at her would-be assailant who was cursing her at the top of his lungs and threatening to attack her with his whip. Eventually she spoke: “When a man has erred, he neither vents his anger on others nor does he find a scapegoat for his mistake. No gentlemen would ever abuse a widow. Look at the way you are behaving! Are you a gentleman? If you want to whip me, then do so! It is pitiable that a man wearing the mantle of high office should be so devoid of propriety!”\n\nCowed by this rebuke, the official was speechless. Blushing with shame, he meekly laid down his whip. Offering profuse apologies, he begged the woman to allow him to ride with her to the Chu capital and she consented. During the journey, the woman learnt of the official’s mission. She said: “The state of Zheng is too weak, squashed as it is between Chu and Jin. When Jin invades, you will have to sign a treaty with the enemy at your city walls. When Chu invades, you will have to sign a treaty with it too. Every year you will suffer – under Jin in winter, and Chu in summer. Yet the country does not lack the power or the means to defend itself. It is because the men who wield power in your government have loose morals and are idle. They form factions, fight and kill one another, and so cripple their country. The state of Zheng must appoint virtuous and able men who can stabilise the court, otherwise nothing you do will have any effect. You will be driven to destruction by the constant demands of Jin and Chu!”\n\nHaving said this, the woman stepped down from the cart and walked away. When the official returned home, he told Duke Jian all that the woman had said. Duke Jian saw the truth behind her words and from that day, he began to appoint worthy and loyal men to official posts. He also began to take personal charge of his court and government.\n\nThus a woman from Chu helped to ensure the survival of Zheng. It is said that she was a widow from the Zhao clan of Chu.\n\nMadam Li\n\nDuring the Spring and Autumn Period, the king of Lirong (a non-Chinese tribe) had two attractive and vivacious daughters who often helped their father with his political duties. In 672 BC, Duke Xian of Jin attacked and annexed Lirong, taking the two sisters as his concubines.\n\nDuke Xian already had two concubines and one favourite had borne him three sons and a daughter. The eldest boy, Shensheng, had been designated crown prince. After the duke had acquired Madam Li and her younger sister, he no longer paid any attention to his former favourites. Both sisters bore the duke children. In 665 BC, Madam Li gave birth to a son, Xiqi. Her sister also bore a son, named Zhuozi. The two sisters became the duke’s favourites.\n\nMadam Li was highly ambitious. She wanted her own son to be appointed crown prince. Hence, she and her sister bribed two of the duke’s favourite officials, Liangwu and Biwu, to help them get rid of Crown Prince Shensheng. The two courtiers fabricated slanderous rumours about the prince and ensured that they reached the ears of the duke. Duke Xian believed what he heard and consequently he despatched Shensheng to serve in Quwo. Shensheng’s allies were sent to assist him in governing Puzhou (in present-day Shaanxi). Having thus sent them away, Duke Xian kept Xiqi and Zhuozi close by his side. Shensheng proved himself to be a wise and virtuous ruler, winning great popularity among the people of Quwo. Feeling threatened by his success, Madam Li continued to collaborate with treacherous court officials, spreading malicious rumours to malign Shensheng. Duke Xian was eventually provoked into banishing his son.\n\nOnce, when Duke Xian was out hunting, Madam Li sent a letter to Shensheng. In it she said that Duke Xian had seen his former favourite, Shensheng’s dead mother, in a dream. The duke wished that Shensheng would offer sacrifices to his mother’s spirit and, after the ceremony, the sacrificial wine and meat should be sent to the duke as a tribute. Shensheng believed that the sentiments expressed in the letter were genuine and complied fully with the request. When she received the sacrificial foods, Madam Li laced them with poison. Presenting them to the duke, she told him that the food, a gift from Shensheng was poisoned. This meant that Shensheng must have sent it with the intention of murdering his father. The duke was outraged. Accused of trying to poison his own father, Shensheng committed suicide.\n\nJust as the evil plot came to pass, Duke Xian met with a sudden and unexpected death; Madam Li and her sister had lost their protector and their shield. Before long, there was a popular uprising. Xiqi and Zhuozi were put to death by powerful courtiers. Madam Li and her sister were flogged to death by the rebels in the hall of their palace, their dreams of seeing a son enthroned were shattered.\n\nThe Lady of Xi\n\n“Though born apart, may we die together.” “In heaven we shall be a pair of love birds, On earth, two branches intertwined.” These solemn vows are familiar to lovers everywhere.\n\nSuch pledges are usually associated with the fervent passion of youth. And yet, history books tell us that the first to utter these words was not a young girl extracting a promise in her lover’s embrace but rather, a middle-aged woman, a mother of two, known as the Lady of Xi.\n\nThe Lady of Xi was the wife of a marquis of Xi who lived during the Spring and Autumn Period (770 – 476 BC). When King Wen of Chu annexed the state of Xi, the marquis was imprisoned and his wife taken to the Chu palace where she was forced to become a concubine. King Wen and the Lady of Xi had two sons named Du’ao and Chengwang. Although she lived a luxurious life befitting the king’s favourite, the Lady of Xi did not utter a single word for the eight long years when she was in the Chu palace. King Wen ordered her to speak many times but the Lady resolutely maintained her silence.\n\nOne day, taking advantage of the king’s absence from the palace, the Lady of Xi finally managed to seek out her long-lost husband who had been forced into slavery. Dressed in the poorest of rags, he gazed at his wife, consort to the king, and his heart was filled with conflicting emotions. The Lady of Xi, however, spoke with uncompromising determination:\n\n“Though we were born apart, May we be buried together.” With that, she took out a dagger and cut her throat. Her husband followed suit.\n\nWhen news of the double suicide reached the king, he sighed with grief and said: “Now I understand why she would never speak a single word to me.”\n\nTo fulfil her dying wish, he had the couple buried side by side. The descendants of the Lady of Xi revered her for her great loyalty, built a temple in her memory and called it Peach Blossom Temple. This name was chosen because the Lady’s favourite flower was the peach blossom, whose beauty she was said to resemble. Thus the Lady of Xi also became known as the Lady of the Peach Blossom which reflects the delicacy of the flower, its radiance and splendour.\n\nConsort Xia\n\nAccording to the annals of history, Consort Xia was the most infamous adulteress of the Spring and Autumn Period (770 – 476BC). Three times a queen, seven times married, she had love affairs with six powerful officials and countless other men.\n\nThe daughter of Duke Mu of Zheng, Consort Xia was so called because her first husband was a senior official from the state of Chen named Xia Yushu. According to legend, Consort Xia was charming, with an attractive plump figure and delicate skin. Unfortunately, many of the men with whom she had been intimate met with violent and unnatural deaths and so Consort Xia came to be looked upon as something of a bane.\n\nWhen Xia Yushu was an official of the Chen court, Consort Xia had adulterous affairs with two of his colleagues, Kong Ning and Yi Xingfu. These shameless men brazenly wore robes which were gifts from Consort Xia to court and openly boasted of their amorous involvement with her. When Duke Ling of Chen heard of her reputation, he made an excuse to visit Consort Xia and also became involved with her.\n\nOne day, Duke Ling, Kong Ning and Yi Xingfu sat feasting in Xia Yushu’s home. During the revelry, Duke Ling mocked Yi Xingfu, saying: “Consort Xia’s son, Zhengshu is growing up to look a lot like you!” Xia Yushu was furious when heard this. That night, he lay in wait for Duke Ling and killed him with an arrow as he walked home. King Zhuang of Chu used this murder as an excuse to declare war and annexed the state of Chen.\n\nKing Zhuang fell victim to Consort Xia’s spell as soon as he saw her and decided to have her as his concubine. However, an official named Qu Wu protested vehemently, saying that the king’s subjects would not tolerate his involvement with such a wanton woman. Hence, King Zhuang gave up his plan. When General Zifan of Chu saw Consort Xia, he too became infatuated. Qu Wu again warned him against being involved with her.\n\nEventually King Zhuanfi betrothed Consort Xia to a regional official of Chu named Xianglao. When the state of Chu went to war with the state of Jin, Xianglao was sent on a military expedition. While he was away, Consort Xia had an affair with his son. Xianglao was killed in battle but his body could not be brought home for burial. King Zhuang instructed Consort Xia to return to the state of Zheng and ask her brother Duke Xiang to mediate with Jin for the return of Xianglao’s body. Consort Xia set off on her journey.\n\nQu Wu, who had seemed so loyal, had in fact lusted after Consort Xia since he first set eyes on her and planned to abduct her. The journey from Chu to Zheng proved a golden opportunity for him to carry out his scheme. He kidnapped her and the two disappeared without a trace. When General Zifan of Chu found out what had happened, he was so filled with bitter resentment that he killed Qu Wu’s entire family.\n\nThere are those who said that Consort Xia’s immoral behaviour should not be blamed for the misfortunes which happened; rather it was the dukes and officials whose evil intentions so often led to disaster. They should have heeded the timely advice of Xieye, an official of the state of Chen, who had warned: “When dukes and officials are immoral, what do you expect the people to do? You should restrain yourselves.”\n\nNüxu\n\nThe great statesman, Qu Yuan is remembered as an imaginative, eloquent, virtuous and selfless man dedicated to his country. Nüxu, his elder sister, who was his advisor and guide, is a more obscure historical figure although her wisdom and ability were certainly not inferior to her younger brother’s.\n\nAccordingly to legend, Qu Yuan once fled from the chaos which prevailed in the court and returned to his native village. Strolling by a mountain stream, he explained to his sister that King Huai of Chu (328 – 299BC) had heeded an unfounded slanderous report about him and consequently refused to adopt his plan to ally with the state of Qi against the state of Qin. As he was speaking, they heard the sound of a heated squabble. Looking up, they saw a group of washer-women standing by the brook, quarrelling over the large flat stones that they used for washing their laundry. Nüxu glanced at her brother and then stepped forward to investigate. Casting her eyes about, she saw a smooth flat stone, large as a reclining ox, and asked the women: “There are so few stones and so many of you. Why don’t you use this stone for your laundry!”\n\nOne of the women replied that they had attempted to move the stone nearer to the water long ago but to no avail. Nüxu thought over the matter for a moment, then said: “I shall move it for you. Come back tomorrow and you will be able to use this stone for your washing.”\n\nAfter the women had gone, Qu Yuan paced around the stone three times, before regarding his sister with a quizzical expression: “Even a man would not be able to move this rock towards the water single-handedly. How are you going to do so?”\n\nNüxu laughed: “No one can move the rock towards the water, but I can move the water to the rock.”\n\nQu Yuan was a little taken aback. Nüxu said: “Let’s come back tomorrow and see what will have happened.” They walked on together.\n\nWhen they returned the following day, the reclining ox stone was planted firmly in the middle of the stream just as Nüxu had said it would be. The washer-women scrambled round the sides working and chattering jubilantly. Qu Yuan walked over to have a closer look. The stone had been moved no more than two zhang (about 6.6m) from the stream, but the short distance was enough to render it useless. Nüxu had dug a hole where the stream flowed close to the stone. The force of the water and the sloping terrain had enlarged the hole so that water from the stream flowed towards, and surrounded the reclining stone.\n\nPointing at the stone, Nüxu said to her brother: “You want King Huai to support your plan to ally with Qi and oppose Qin to deliver our state from danger but the king will not be moved. In this, you are like the washer-women who wanted to use the reclining ox stone but discovered that it was too far from the water. It was not within the power of men to move the stone into the water, but there was another way to solve the problem – bring the water to the stone. This water is symbolic of the desires and will of the people.”\n\nQu Yuan understood his sister’s reasoning. In great haste, he contacted all the wise and able men of Chu and persuaded them to send petitions to the king to support his case. Flooded by their pleas, King Huai understood where public sentiment lay and sent orders that an alliance be formed with Qi against Qin.\n\nNie Ying\n\nNie Ying lived during the Warring States Era (475- 221 BC) and was the elder sister of a famous assassin named Nie Zheng. Although natives of the state of Han, they were forced to flee from their enemies. They eventually found refuge in the city of Tu in the state of Qi where they lived a secluded life with their aged mother.\n\nYan Sui, a minister of the state of Han, was an honest and forthright man who often came into conflict with the treacherous Han Kui and the latter finally drove Yan Sui out of the state. Yan Sui wandered from country to country, seeking a man who could kill Han Kui and save his country from ruin. When he arrived at Qi, he heard of Nie Zheng’s great courage and decided to pay him a visit. Yan Sui offered Nie Zheng two hundred pieces of gold if he would carry out the assassination, but he refused politely, saying that he was still needed at home to look after his mother. Yan Sui accepted this refusal with grace and bade Nie Zheng a courteous farewell.\n\nNot long after, Nie Zheng’s mother fell sick and died. Having observed a suitable period of mourning, Nie Zheng began to ponder over Yan Sui’s dilemma and told his sister: “Each man has only one life and the fiery passion of youth should be offered to one’s country. I have deep respect for Yan Sui. He is honourable and honest. Now that I am no longer bound by other responsibilities, it is time that I carry out his orders.\n\nConsequently, Nie Zheng went in search of Yan Sui who was overjoyed to hear of his change of heart.\n\nNie Zheng travelled to the state of Han alone and rode his horse right into the imperial palace. Han Kui was in one of the palace halls, discussing state affairs with many eminent officials. Nie Zheng galloped up to him and killed him with his sword. Then he used the same sword to slash the skin from his own face, gouge out his eyes and finally cut his throat. The palace guards carried Nie Zheng’s corpse to the town square to be displayed alongside with a notice which read:\n\n“A reward of one thousand taels of gold to anyone who can identify this man.” The proclamation met with no response.\n\nWhen Nie Ying heard of the mysterious assassin, she realised at once that it was her brother who had mutilated his face to prevent his family from suffering the consequences of his action. She travelled to the state of Han with great haste. Grieving, she embraced Nie Zheng’s corpse and cried: “This man is Nie Zheng, a native of the city of Zhi in the state of Han. I am his elder sister and I shall not, merely for the sake of my own safety, allow my younger brother to die without a name!”\n\nNie Ying then went on to cite the many examples of Han Kui’s treachery and praise the heroic deeds of Nie Zheng. Having finished her eulogy, she committed suicide by her brother’s side.\n\nThus, through the brave sacrifice of his sister, Nie Zheng’s name has been remembered up to modern times.\n\nRuji\n\nThere were two women in ancient China who became famous for having stolen from their husbands. One was Chang’e who swallowed the pill of immortality and flew to the moon; the other was Ruji who stole the king’s seal. However the verdict passed by later generations on these two “female thieves” is noticeably different.\n\nRuji was the favourite concubine of King Anli of Wei and a close friend of the king’s younger brother, Lord Xinling.\n\nLord Xinling was a virtuous man and a generous host, attributes which had won him great reputation among his fellow courtiers. He saw his most important task as safeguarding the security of the state of Wei. When King Anli reached the twentieth year of his reign, Duke Zhao of Qin led a military expedition against the state of Zhao, besieging the city of Handan. Lord Xinling’s elder sister was married to Lord Pingyuan, the younger brother of King Hui of Zhao. Consequently, when Zhao sent an urgent request for assistance, the state of Wei was quick to respond. An army of one hundred thousand men, under the leadership of General Jin Bi, was despatched from Wei to the rescue of Zhao. When Duke Zhao of Qin learnt of the approaching army, he threatened the King of Wei:\n\n“For the state of Qin to conquer Zhao is as easy as blinking the eyes. If there are dukes and princes who dare to rise in defence of Zhao, we shall use our armies to punish these offending noblemen once we have subdued Zhao!”\n\nFrightened by the military might of Qin, King Anil hurriedly despatched an envoy with a command to recall General Jin Bi and his troops.\n\nLord Xinling, having sworn to die for Zhao if necessary, was placed in an awkward situation because of the king’s change of heart; he was forced to march to Zhao with only the few troops under his personal control. Before leaving, he met with the sage, Hou Ying to discuss his plans. Hou Ying told him:\n\n“Ifyou can persuade someone to steal the king’s seal, you will be able to send an order commanding General Jin Bi to lead his troops and save Zhao. “But who would do it!” Lord Xinling asked in desperation.\n\n“Ruji.”\n\nThe tiger seal, a stamp to signify imperial authorisation for deployment of troops, was split into two parts; one of which was in the possession of General Jin Bi, the other was concealed in the king’s bedchamber. The king’s favourite concubine, Ruji, had the freedom to enter the bedchamber whenever she pleased and therefore could easily find an opportunity to steal the seal. But would she agree to be part of the plan! Hou Ying said:\n\n“For three years Ruji had sought for her father’s murderer in vain. When she solicited your help, you took it upon yourself to seek revenge on her behalf. This is a favour I think she will be happy to repay.\n\nSo Lord Xinling told Ruji about his plan and Ruji, out of gratitude and knowing him to be a man of integrity, agreed to steal the seal. Lord Xinling sent a messenger to collect it and forged a command from the king ordering General Jin Bi to rescue Zhao. Unfortunately, the general grew suspicious, discovered the deception and therefore, refused to carry out the order.\n\nRuji’s act of theft gained praise from future generations, whereas Chang’e’s theft was universally condemned. Perhaps this is because Ruji’s theft was for a noble cause.\n\nXishi\n\nXishi (497 BC) was a legendary beauty of ancient China. She has been described as “equally charming in both heavy and light makeup”, “as appealing when she frowns as when she smiles”. Of her figure it has been said that “were she plump, you would admire her plumpness, were she thin you would admire her for being slender”. She is celebrated as a woman of extraordinary natural beauty with a universal appeal. Although many have praised Xishi’s looks, there is but little mention of her notable virtue – she had a great love for her country and her people.\n\nXishi was the daughter of a tea trader from Ningluo Mountain village in the Zhuji county in Zhejiang Province. This comprised a part of the ancient state of Yue.\n\nWhen the state of Yue was vanquished by the state of Wu, the King of Yue, Gou Jian was forced to serve the Prince of Wu for three years. On his release, King Gou Jian slept on brushwood and drank gall before each meal to remind himself of the humiliation his country had suffered. He commissioned men to search far and wide for a woman whom he could send as a tribute to Prince Fuchai of Wu. Xishi, whose beauty was much talked of even from early childhood, was selected for this task and sent to the capital.\n\nKing Gou Jian approved of the choice and had Xishi dressed in fine robes. He had her trained in royal court etiquette. Gou Jian ordered his minister Fan Li to take Xishi to the Prince of Wu as a tribute gift from Yue. During the journey, Xishi fell deeply in love with the wise minister. Fan Li also grew to admire this courageous lady who was willing to give her life for her country. Consequently, before they parted, they made a secret pledge of undying love.\n\nThey arrived at the capital of Wu and the prince welcomed Xishi with open arms. He was enchanted by her appearance and doted on her. Gradually he began to neglect his political duties, preferring to idle away his time with Xishi. He frequently took her out on carriage rides to the noisy and prosperous sections of the city. On these rides, he liked to boast to those around him that he had won the heart of the most beautiful woman in the world. He would add: “If you want to look at her, you’ll have to present me with some gold coins!” In this way, he also managed to enrich his coffers.\n\nXishi, however, never lost sight of her mission. Her aim was to bewitch the Prince of Wu so that his subjects would grow restless and his friends would desert him. The political chaos that ensued would enable the King of Yue to invade the state of Wu, recompensing him for his former humiliation.\n\nHeaven grants the wishes of men. The King of Yue finally annexed the state of Wu. Following the death of Prince Fuchai of Wu, Xishi disappeared from public life. She lived in relative obscurity with Fan Li who became a successful trader.\n\nThis story is unique in the history of feudal China as no one has ever found fault with Xishi, even though she had caused the downfall of the state of Wu.\n\nDongshi\n\nSometimes nature has a cruel sense of humour. The village at Ningluo Mountain was home to the unrivalled beauty, Xishi. Her neighbour to the east was a girl of unparalleled ugliness, named Dongshi.\n\nIn all fairness, Dongshi’s ugliness was not in the same category as Momu’s. Rather, she was uncommonly plain. To make matters worse, she spent all her time by Xishi’s side, imitating her every move.\n\nA story about her, recorded in Zhuangzi, never fails to raise a smile:\n\nWhenever Xishi was worried or angry, she would put her hand to her heart and frown; an innocent gesture which would arouse feelings of affectionate sympathy in all who saw her.\n\nDongshi would try to imitate this endearing gesture. Feigning sorrow, she would raise her hand to her heart and knit her eyebrows. But when Dongshi did this, her queer appearance was enough to scare the villagers out of their wits. It is said that when people from wealthy families saw her, they would rush back to their houses, bolt their doors and would not venture out again. When poor people saw her, they would gather their families and run as far away as they could.\n\nWhen she looked at people, they would run away and poor Dongshi never understood why. Dongshi was only aware of how attractive Xishi looked when she frowned, but she never stopped to think why people found Xishi’s look of distress so appealing.\n\nWhat Dongshi failed to realise is that only what is natural is beautiful. Today, the phrase “Dongshi knitting her eyebrows” is used to refer to the ugliness and absurdity of crude imitation.\n\nWuyan\n\nChina’s historical annals bear witness to the existence of a wise and virtuous woman of startling appearance who lived long after Momu. Her surname was Zhongli, her first name Chun, yet later generations named her after her town of origin, Wuyan, in the state of Qi.\n\nWuyan was thin and dark. She walked with a stoop, her long arms out of proportion with her stumpy legs. Her scrawny neck, with its large Adam’s apple, supported an oval head with sunken cheekbones, a low forehead and flat upturned nose. Large teeth protruded fiercely from her mouth. Although she was more than thirty years old, she was still not married.\n\nAt that time, King Xuan of Qi was involved in a grand plan to build a great palace to be used for dancing and singing. The palace was being built with forced labour, and girls were rounded up to be trained to sing and dance. The king paid no regard to the distress of his people over such a plan.\n\nThe king’s messenger, searching through Wuyan for potential palace ladies, found that all the women had either fled from town or gone into hiding. Only Wuyan remained and she readily offered to go to the capital and serve the king. The messenger was, however, reluctant to take her, fearing that her extraordinary appearance would frighten King Xuan to death. Wuyan calmed his fear: “I have made myself up to look like this, it is only a disguise. Take me to the king and I shall show him what I am really worth.\n\nAs he could find no one else, he had no choice but to believe Wuyan and take her back to the capital with him.\n\nWhen King Xuan first set eyes on Wuyan, he almost jumped out of his skin: “I told you to choose beauties, not ugly ones!”\n\nThe messenger knelt down: “Your Majesty, this woman told me she has the ability to change her appearance and this is just one of the forms she assumes.” King Xuan was intrigued : “Let’s see how you can change.” Wuyan replied: “Great king, please listen to me first. When I have finished, you will see how I have changed; perhaps you too will have changed.\n\nThen Wuyan began to spell out all the maladies which afflicted the state of Qi, indicating clearly the terrible consequences that could befall a bad government. As King Xuan listened, he broke out in cold sweat. Having listened a little longer, he began to see that Wuyan was not that repulsive after all, in fact she became quite pleasing to his eyes.\n\nThe king no longer looked at Wuyan as “an inferior person brought to make up the numbers”, but a woman whose advice, though harsh, was just and good. He immediately ordered that work on the palace and the search for girls be stopped. He took charge of his government, ready to welcome criticisms and turned a deaf ear to slander. The king felt that Wuyan would be able to contribute a great deal to the future of his nation and so he made her empress. These events, told far and wide, became a popular tale.\n\nIn modern times, describing a girl as “Momu Wuyan” is seen as derisive, showing the superficial understanding of these characters. Although ugly, both women became celebrated as mothers of their countries. The saying should therefore be viewed as a compliment.\n\nZhuang Tianshi\n\nTo be a wife is difficult, to be the wife of a philosopher doubly so. The reason for this is that philosophers often adopt attitudes which may not be practical. In ancient China, their thought was often based on the concept of “me alone” and “have no faith in others”. This lack of trust could cause a great deal of harm.\n\nZhuangzhou was the quintessential Taoist philosopher who lived during the Warring States Era (475-221 BC). His philosophy further mystified the concepts of “man” and “self’. As for his opinion of his wife, that may be judged from the tale below.\n\nOne day, as Zhuangzhou was taking a stroll, he came across a woman fanning a fresh grave-mound vigorously. He learned that the woman was recently widowed and was desperate to remarry. As her late husband’s grave was not totally dry, she feared that she would be the object of ridicule. Therefore she was attempting to speed up the drying of the earth. Zhuangzhou thought about this matter for a long time.\n\nWhen he returned home, he told his wife, Zhuang Tianshi, of all that he had seen, adding: “When one’s alive, everyone speaks of their profound love, after death everyone wants to fan your grave. Having said this, he stared at his wife, examining her closely. Zhuang Tianshi loved and respected her husband. She showed him great consideration and was used to his volatile disposition. It did not occur to her that he was suspicious of her love for him.\n\nThe following day, Zhuangzhou suddenly died. He had used a Taoist technique called “using the qi to fake death” but Zhuang Tianshi was unaware of this and believed that tragedy had struck. She cried herself into a stupor and managed to arrange a fitting burial.\n\nZhuangzhou was known far and wide and many people came to pay their last respects. One day, a rowdy debonair man arrived.He was also a Taoist and saw at once that Zhuangthou had faked his own death. He said to Zhuang Tianshi: “All he needs is a set of brains and fresh air, then he will come back from the dead.\n\nShe went down on her knees and begged for his help. The man continued: “I can certainly revive Zhuangzhou, but you must thank me with your body. Zhuang Tianshi was so agitated that she barely heard his words as she grabbed an axe. With a few blows, she managed to break open the lid of the coffin. Her intention was to open the coffin for ventilation and then commit suicide to give her brains to Zhuangzhou.\n\nWhen she lifted the lid, Zhuangzhou sat bolt upright. Inside the coffin, he had listened intently to the muffled conversation but only picked up the phrases “brains” and “thank me with your body”. Seeing Zhuang Tianshi standing over him with the axe and a strange man beside her, he flew into a fury: “You’re striking the lid of my coffin with an axe. You can’t wait to fan my grave!”\n\nZhuang Tianshi did all she could to make him understand but he dismissed her words as excuses. Zhuang Tianshi cried endlessly. The more she thought about it, the more she knew that she had been grossly wronged. Unable to go on with life, she hanged herself.\n\nAfter Zhuang Tianshi’s death, people came to pay their respects and found Zhuangzhou sitting in a corner of the room, beating a drum and singing to demonstrate his enlightenment!\n\nMengmu (Mother Meng)\n\nMeng Ke’s scholarly attainments and virtue won him the respect of the people. They revered him as a sage and called him Mengzi. His mother, Mengmu, was his first teacher.\n\nWhen Mengzi was a young boy, his family lived next to a graveyard. Together with the other neighbourhood children, he would play games imitating the ceremonial and burial rites they often saw. Mengmu grew anxious when she saw this and moved to another house next to the marketplace. There Mengzi began to observe the merchants; bartering and trading, cunning men who haggled over every ounce, and he began to mimic them in his play. Mengmu found this behaviour equally inappropriate and so moved house once again, this time taking up residence close to a private school. When Mengzi heard the clear voices of the eager students reciting their lessons, he too, wanted to study. Only then was his mother content to settle down. This story is known as “Mengmu moved house three times”.\n\nDuring his youth, Mengzi attended the private school. He played truant on one occasion. Mengmu was busy weaving cloth when she saw her son sneaking home. She called him over, took hold of the piece of finished cloth and cut it into half. She said: “If you fail to complete your studies, you will be like this severed strip of cloth – fit for nothing!”\n\nMengzi felt deeply ashamed, and eventually grew up to be a learned man. This is the story of how Mengmu “used her wits to teach her son a lesson”. The next story took place after Mengzi had already established his reputation.\n\nOne day, his wife went into an inner room to change her clothes. Without thinking, Mengzi barged into the room and saw his wife in a state of undress. He was intensely displeased, so he decided to send her back to her parents in disgrace. When Mengmu heard this, she chided her son: “You didn’t knock, nor did you request permission to enter, you just barged into the room! It is your fault. How can you falsely accuse your wife?”\n\nMengzi realised that he was in the wrong, so he apologised to his wife and implored her to stay. This is the story of how Mengmu “lectured her son in an inner room.”\n\nWhen Mengzi was a minister of the state of Qi, he was frustrated as he found it difficult to use and develop his abilities to the fullest. He wanted to make the long trip back to his native home where he could find fulfillment. At the same time, he was concerned that his mother, by then old and infirm, would not be able to weather the arduous journey.\n\nMengmu told her son: “The Book of Changes tells us that women must manage the household and should not dabble in the affairs of the world. It also says that women must abide by the “Three Obediences and Four Virtues”: When they are young, they must obey their parents; when they marry, they must obey their husbands and when they are old, they must obey their sons. You have a great future before you and you must be bold to seize opportunities which come by! You must not be held back by your concern for me. I can still follow you wherever you go!” This story is known as “Mengmu exhorts the Three Obediences and Four Virtues”. Mengmu was a virtuous mother – the above stories indeed merit deep contemplation.\n\nZhuangzhi\n\nDuring the later part of the Warring States Era (475-221 BC), King Qingxiang ruled over the state of Chu. Under his control, the state suffered a terrible decline in fortune, yet the king still lived a leisurely life. He came and went as he pleased, constantly surrounded by a swarm of fawning sycophants, whilst loyal virtuous men such as Qu Yuan suffered demotion and exile. The state of Qin sent an envoy, Zhang Yi, to Chu. His mission was to persuade King Qingxiang to take a pleasure trip some 500 li to the south. Qin hoped to take advantage of his absence to destroy Chu.\n\nKing Qingxiang, completely oblivious to the impending danger, was full of enthusiasm and set off for the trip. Reaching the southern outskirts of the city, King Qingxiang and his men suddenly came across a small banner planted in the road. A young girl knelt and pleaded for an audience with the king. King Qingxiang was intrigued by her request for an audience and had her summoned to him. The girl was still a child, no more than twelve years old, yet she had an air of seriousness about her. She said to him: “I have a secret to tell you. There is a ‘great fish without water’ and a ‘dragon with no tail’. The walls crumble and are about to collapse, yet the king himself does not know. King Qingxiang had to admit that he did not know what she was referring to.\n\nThe girl proceeded to explain: “The ‘great fish without water’ is the king who will travel 500 li to the south for pleasure. While he is there, he will suffer a swift and great calamity: he will lose his hold on power and will have no way to regain his position, like a fish out of water. ‘A dragon with no tail’ refers to a great king who has seen the passing of forty springs and autumns but still has not appointed an heir to the throne. A country without a crown prince, without good and loyal men, is one which courts disaster. As the king is unaware ofthis, all I can say is that the walls crumble and are about to collapse, yet the king does not know.\n\nKing Qingxiang was astonished and immediately asked what calamity she was referring to, whereupon the girl told him of the evil schemes of the state of Qin. She then went on to list the five ills which plagued the state of Chu: “The first ill is that magnificent palaces are being built everywhere. The second is that costly brocades hang on the walls of these palaces while the common people do not have clothes of even the roughest cotton to wear. The third ill is that the court is opulent and extravagant; the might of the nation is on the decline. The fourth is that the people suffer thirst and starvation while the wealthy ensure that even their horses have more food than they can eat. The fifth and final ill is that corrupt officials guide the king while virtuous men are denied opportunities to offer their advice. Burdened by these five problems, disaster will strike our country.\n\nKing Qingxiang finally began to realise the truth after listening to her. He immediately ordered his troops to turn back and return to court but the city gates were blocked for the defending army had already started fighting. Before the rebel forces could have a chance to establish a foothold, King Qingxiang attacked the city with his remaining troops and only with great difficulty was he able to regain the capital.\n\nKing Qingxiang learned much from this bitter experience. He was indebted to the young girl for her criticism and was so impressed with her that he made her a lady.\n\nThe girl was Zhuangzhi. The daughter of a minor official, she had heard about the affairs of the state from her father and his friends. From their daily conversations, she came to know all about the Chu government and to understand the dangers confronting the country should the king go on a long journey to the south. Consequently, Zhuangzhi resolved to dissuade the king from going on the trip. She told her mother of her plan but her mother became anxious: “My daughter, you are only a child. Is it safe for you to remonstrate against your elders!” But Zhuangzhi had no thought for her own safety and was more determined than ever to make a petition to King Qingxiang.\n\nAfter being appointed to nobility, Zhuangzhi was frequently at the king’s side “preaching frugality and love for the people” and offering ideas which King Qingxiang often accepted. Consequently, during this time, the state of Chu began to enjoy a change of fortune.\n\nMeng Jiangnü\n\nThis is a solemn and tragic tale familiar to people all over China.\n\nDuring the Qin Dynasty (221-207 BC) there lived a youth named Fan Qiliang, who had been conscripted to build the Great Wall. Unable to endure the back-breaking labour, he ran away.\n\nOne day, Fan Qiliang scrambled up a tree and entered the backyard of landowner Mengchao. He inadvertently met with the landowner’s daughter, Meng Jiangnü.\n\nThe two young people felt strongly attracted to each other. Meng Jiangnü boldly revealed her innermost emotions but Fan Qiliang was more cautious: “How can I, an escaped criminal, think of marrying you who have grown up delicate and refined within the shelter of these luxurious courtyards!”\n\nIn response, Meng Jiangnü vowed her undying devotion and brought Fan Qiliang to see her father, who, after some persuasion, consented to the match.\n\nA few days after the marriage, Fan Qiliang was captured and sent back to the Great Wall. The lonely Meng Jiangnii gazed out of her window and longed for the return ofher husband. Winter arrived without any news of him. Meng Jiangnü thought to herself: “I have made you these warm clothes but there is no one to bring them to you. I will go myself.”\n\nWhen Meng Jiangnü arrived at the Great Wall, she searched high and low, asking everyone she met if they knew her husband. She soon learnt that the harsh conditions had killed him some time back, and that his corpse was buried within the Great Wall. Grief-stricken and exhausted, Meng Jiangnü fell to her knees and wept.\n\nMeng Jiangnü cried for many days and nights. Then suddenly a huge section of the Great Wall collapsed, revealing the bones of thousands of men. Without ceasing her bitter lamentation, Meng Jiangnü bit her fingers until they bled. One by one she let the drops of her blood fall on the bones until, finally, one of the drops was soaked up thirstily. That was how she knew where her husband’s remains were.\n\nAfter Meng Jiangnü had given her husband a proper burial, she threw herself into the Zi River and drowned. Her story has come to symbolise the sufferings of those who are forced to live under the rule of tyrants and despots.\n\nThis tale first appeared during the Tang Dynasty, but is set during the reign of the self-styled “First Emperor to Unify China”, Qin Shihuang of the Qin Dynasty, a merciless tyrant who ordered the construction of the Great Wall, using slave labour from all over China.\n\nYu Meiren\n\nIt was late in the evening of a cool autumn night. In the surrounding darkness, men raised their voices, singing songs of Chu. The air resounded with music. Xiang Yu the Conqueror, sat huddled in his heavy cloak. He inclined his head and listened intently to the familiar melodies.\n\n“To think that so many of my noble warriors of Chu are now in the Han camp! ” He thought of his army of three thousand soldiers who had followed him from their homeland east of the Jiangdong. He remembered the night when they vanquished the Qin, killing more than one hundred thousand enemy soldiers. And now he recalled the great fire in A’fang Palace, the feasting and drinking at Swan Gate…\n\n“Don’t think of these things!”\n\nHe angrily gulped down a cup of wine;\n\n“I cannot return to the east defeated!”\n\nXiang Yu the Conqueror, sprang to his feet, his hand on his sword. Another image flashed across his mind – his beloved concubine, Yu Meiren (d. AD 202) who was always at his side, as loyal as his black mare. Dejected, he slumped back, still clutching the hilt of his sword. The songs from Chu permeated the night air.\n\n“Very well, I shall sing too!”\n\nHe raised his voice to the chorus of soldiers, invisible in the gloom:\n\n“With my strength I have uprooted mountains,\n\nWith my spirit, I have conquered the world.\n\nBut time is against me now,\n\nMy horse can no longer gallop.\n\nMy horse cannot break through,\n\nIs there no way out!\n\nOh Yul Oh Yul\n\nWhat will be your fate!”\n\nFor a moment, the rich alto voice of a woman rose and mingled with the voices of the men:\n\n“The Han army has seized my homeland;\n\nAll around I hear the songs of Chu.\n\nThe spirit of my king is broken,\n\nAnd I, a lowly concubine\n\nCan no longer find the will to live.”\n\nThe tall and graceful shadow of a beautiful lady brushed past. Soft, supple hands gently prised apart the coarse calloused fingers which gripped the sword; they trembled slightly, searching for the hilt, and then suddenly grasped it tightly. There was a swish as the weapon was drawn from its scabbard, and a chilling glint of metal flashed in the moonlight. In a moment, the sword fell to the ground, the blade smeared with warm fresh blood.\n\nXiang Yu the Conqueror cried out: “Yu Meiren…”\n\nHis voice was hoarse with grief. Dramatic to the last, she had given her answer to his despair.\n\nMeng Guang\n\nFor thousands of years, Meng Guang has been considered to be the paragon of wifely virtue; a woman of plain appearance but with great moral integrity.\n\nDuring the Later Han Dynasty (AD 947-950) there lived in Pingling County, a learned and capable scholar called Liang Hong, styled Boluan. Liang Hong was a man who embraced poverty and shunned official appointments, and was greatly admired by all his neighbours. Local families regularly offered their daughters to him in marriage but he refused to consider their proposals.\n\nIt so happened that in the same district, lived a girl named Meng Guang, styled Deyao. The daughter of a country squire, Meng Guang was a homely girl. Nevertheless, she had strict ideas about what she wanted in a husband. Consequently, at the age of thirty, she remained unwed.One day her father, in exasperation, asked her who her ideal man would be. Her answer was simple: “I want to marry a man like Liang Hong.”\n\nWhen news of this reached Liang Hong, he replied: “Well, let her marry me!”\n\nThe time for the wedding arrived and Meng Guang travelled to his home in her finest clothes. For seven days and seven nights, he showed no interest in his new bride. No longer able to endure his indifference, Meng Guang knelt before him and asked:\n\n“I have heard that you are a person of great moral character who has taken a long time to marry. Well, so have I. Now that you here married me, please tell me what it is about me that offends you.”\n\nLiang Hong replied:\n\n“Your expensive clothes and heavy makeup disgust me! The only woman I would be willing to share my life with would be one who wears only a thorn hairpin and a plain cotton dress!”‘\n\nIt was then that Meng Guang understood everything. She put on a coarse cotton dress, discarded her makeup, bound up her hair and did all the menial and laborious tasks. Only then was her husband satisfied.\n\nSome time later, the couple went to live in the mountains of Baling. They passed their days by growing crops, playing the qin, singing and studying.\n\nAfter this, they travelled all over the country, earning their livelihood wherever they went. During this time, Liang Hong worked as a thresher. Every evening, when he returned home, Meng Guang would place the food she had prepared on a tray. She would then offer this tray to him by raising it to the level of her eyebrows to symbolise her deep love and respect for her husband.\n\nTo this day, the phrase “holding the tray level with the eyebrows” is used to characterise married couples who treat each other with love and respect.\n\nEmpress Lü\n\nThere are those who lust for power and court applause, who are unprepared to exercise authority only from beh"
