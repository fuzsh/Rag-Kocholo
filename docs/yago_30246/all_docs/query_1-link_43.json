        "text": "\"Linda, after today's grand wedding, you will be the Empress, the mother figure to the whole nation. From now on, you must not act recklessly or impulsively. The dignity of the Royal Family must not be tarnished. You should know there are still many who covet your position as Empress. Ah, with your temperament, I truly believe that you are not suited for a life within these high walls, where the rules are too many and one could lose their life if they are not careful.\"\n\nLady Shangguan looked at her daughter, Shangguan Linlang, who was radiant in her phoenix crown and wedding robe, with a face full of worry. For some reason, on this joyous day, instead of feeling a hint of happiness, Lady Shangguan felt a vague sense of unease in her heart as if something was amiss, yet she couldn't put her finger on what it was.\n\n\"Alright, Mother, rest assured, I'm not a three-year-old child. I know what I can and can't do, and I won't let anyone catch me in a mistake that easily. Besides, I am still the Commander of the Three Armies. Have you ever seen me make a mistake in the years of leading troops into battle? Just relax, with my martial prowess, few in this world can match me. If they want to deal with me, they will have to weigh their own capabilities.\"\n\nShangguan Linlang walked up to Lady Shangguan, took her arm, and began to comfort her in a soft and gentle voice. Thinking that she was finally going to marry the man she loved—the young and promising Emperor Han Ziye of Yulong Country—Shangguan Linlang was so excited she could hardly contain herself.\n\n\"Alright, my lady, I think you're just reluctant to part with Linda, that's why you're behaving like this. The Imperial Palace is not a Dragon Pool Tiger Den, and besides, Han Ziye has publicly promised that no one else but our daughter will be his Empress. Our Shangguan Family has not exerted a small effort to keep his throne secure over the years; he definitely will not fail our daughter. You can be at ease.\"\n\nProtectorate General Shangguan Haotian, usually blunt in speech due to his military background, thumped his chest and solemnly assured his sensitive wife.\n\n\"General, when you are outside, you must always be mindful of your behavior. The Emperor is still the sovereign of a nation. Even though he has treated us with great respect multiple times, we should not overstep our bounds. How can you address him by name so casually? You two, father and daughter, have been on the battlefield for too long; everything you do or say lacks refinement. Our daughter has also been taught by you to be so bold, what good is it for a girl to be so fearless?\"\n\nWith this diversion, Lady Shangguan's worries were somewhat alleviated, and she seized the opportunity to start berating the two inconsiderate members of her family. Shangguan Linlang and Shangguan Haotian looked at each other and pursed their lips in silence, then pretended to listen obediently.\n\n\"My lady, master, miss, the Emperor has arrived and is in the front hall,\" Lady Xu, Shangguan Linlang's nurse, suddenly rushed into the young miss's chamber and respectfully announced to the three people inside.\n\n\"Wow, Brother Ziye is here! Mother, I'm going to see Brother Ziye first, and I'll come back to listen to your nagging later.\" As soon as Shangguan Linlang heard that Han Ziye had arrived at the General's Mansion, she scooped up her long skirt and ran towards the front hall. In the blink of an eye, she had disappeared, her impetuous air making Lady Shangguan shake her head repeatedly.\n\n\"Look at that, your 'good' daughter, completely unaware of what modesty means, and it's all because you spoil her. Where in her is the dignified and steady demeanor befitting an Empress? I'm worried sick about how she will deal with the Empress Dowager,\" Lady Shangguan said after Shangguan Linlang had run off, aiming her complaints once again at Shangguan Haotian.\n\n\"Alright, my lady, the Royal Family is not so unreasonable. Our daughter is by no means an ordinary girl. If she were constrained within the doors of her home, how could Han Ziye have taken a fancy to her? This is her strong point, not a complete lack of virtue. I believe the Empress Dowager will also come to see the good in our Linda. She is straightforward and sincere, far better than those cunning maidservants by more than a hundredfold,\" spoke Protectorate General Shangguan Haotian, who held his daughter as the apple of his eye.\n\n\"Right, right, right, your daughter is the best,\" Lady Shangguan said, too tired to argue further with her stubborn husband. It didn't matter how much she talked; Shangguan Haotian would still take Linda's side, and they had often covered for each other in front of her over the years.\n\n\"My lady, you wrong me. In my heart, you are still foremost, and even though our daughter is wonderful, she will eventually marry and leave.\" Seeing that Lady Shangguan had finally stopped nagging about him and his daughter, Shangguan Haotian joked with her.\n\nWhile the Shangguan family was in high spirits, Han Ziye stood alone quietly in the front hall, pondering something in his heart. The young Emperor exuded a strong sense of solitude, as if keeping others at bay from his own world.\n\n\"Brother Ziye, you've come,\" Shangguan Linlang called out joyfully from a distance when she saw Han Ziye, who was standing with his back to her. She ran towards him while happily calling out to the person inside.\n\nHearing this voice that couldn't be more familiar, Han Ziye's entire body suddenly stiffened, his fists clenching at his sides as if he were making some difficult decision. But after a moment, he relaxed his hands, reverting to his usual carefree demeanor.\n\n\"Linda, you're here. Why did you run so quickly? Look, there's a thin layer of sweat on your forehead.\" Han Ziye looked at the stunningly beautiful woman in a vermillion bridal gown in front of him with an adoring gaze.\n\n\"I wanted to see you as soon as possible. I missed you so much, Brother Ziye. Will you think less of me for not being demure? Just now, my mother was scolding me for not behaving properly. Brother Ziye, do you think you'll grow to dislike me someday?\"\n\nShangguan Linlang, without any pretense, naturally wrapped her arms around Han Ziye and then asked him with grave seriousness. Having been nagged by Lady Shangguan for so long, she also feared what she would do if she were not the woman Han Ziye fancied? She had loved Han Ziye for so many years, already used to him, and had never considered what her world would be like if she couldn't be by his side one day.\n\n\"Silly girl, you are you, and there's no need to deliberately imitate others. If you ever become affected and artificial, I'd probably find it even more intolerable,\" Han Ziye was silent for a while, then reached out to gently stroke Shangguan Linlang's hair before responding softly.\n\n\"I knew it. Brother Ziye wouldn't be so superficial as to scorn me. But aren't we getting married in a little while? Why did you come to our mansion at this time? According to my mother, it's improper. It's said to be bad luck for the bride and groom to meet too early.\"\n\nHaving received Han Ziye's assurance, Shangguan Linlang felt as sweet inside as if she had eaten honey. Suddenly recalling the words her mother had repeated in her ear, her brows furrowed, and she forthrightly questioned Han Ziye.\n\nHan Ziye, who had never considered the formalities to be significant, found it amusing that Shangguan Linlang, of all people, would care about such trivial matters of etiquette. He sneered inwardly, but his expression remained unchanged. He did not answer Shangguan Linlang's question; instead, he changed the subject, \"Linda, would you like to go to a fun place? It's a spot I found especially for you. I'm sure you'll like it.\"\n\n\"Brother Ziye, our wedding time will be upon us soon. Can we wait until after our ceremony to go?\"\n\nAs soon as she heard about a fun place, Shangguan Linlang was tempted, but remembering the earnest admonitions from her mother, she hesitated. If her mother found out she was running around with Han Ziye so close to the wedding, she'd probably get an earful.\n\nHan Ziye's plan had never considered that Shangguan Linlang would flatly refuse his invitation. A gleam of deep thought flashed in his eyes before he swiftly composed himself, as if the peculiarity had never occurred.\n\n\"I didn't know Linda was so eager to marry me, haha. In that case, after our wedding, I will take you there. Remember, this is a secret between just the two of us, Linda. You mustn't divulge it to anyone, including Uncle Shangguan and Auntie, understand? Otherwise, Brother Ziye will be unhappy,\" Han Ziye said, gently caressing Shangguan Linlang's hair as he teased.\n\n\"Yes, day and night, all I think about is looking forward to the day I can marry Brother Ziye. In this world, I only wish to marry you, so don't tease me. I promise not to reveal our little secret to anyone. I'm also looking forward to finding out what the secret is,\" Shangguan Linlang replied with a blushing face.\n\nShangguan Linlang's sudden confession caught Han Ziye off guard, and something inside him stirred. However, he quickly adjusted his demeanor. He couldn't allow himself to be affected, especially by the Female Commander of the Three Armies, whose presence was in itself an insult to him.\n\nSince she was so willing to marry him, Han Ziye thought he might as well oblige her. After all, it could very well be Shangguan Linlang's last wish, since he was determined to send her to Hell. From the beginning, there was no chance for love between them, only the prospect of mutual destruction. The thorn in his throat, he was determined to remove it, no matter what. Even if it was for the stability of his own throne, Shangguan Linlang must die.\n\n\"Then Brother Ziye will head back to prepare for the wedding. I'll see you later, Linda.\"\n\nWith that, Han Ziye left without looking back, and Shangguan Linlang couldn't grab his sleeve in time. She could only watch his figure getting farther and farther away. For some reason, the typically unemotional girl suddenly felt a sense of melancholy, as if she was about to lose something precious. She could only watch helplessly as Han Ziye disappeared from her sight."
