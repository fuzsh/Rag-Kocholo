She ruled for 15 years during the Tang Dynasty and was one of China’s most impactful and divisive emperors.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information on Empress Wu, or you can download our 29-page Empress Wu worksheet pack to utilize within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nBACKGROUND AND EARLY LIFE\n\nWu Zhao was born on February 17, 624 CE, to a wealthy family in Wenshi County, Shanxi Province. She was the daughter of a Tang Dynasty chancellor, Wu Shiyue.\n\nHer father encouraged Wu to read and write and develop intellectual skills at a very young age. Wu also learned to play music, write poetry, and give public speeches.\n\nIn 638 CE, she was chosen as one of Emperor Taizong’s concubines when she was 14 years old. Taizong gave her the name ‘Mei-Niang,’ which means ‘beautiful girl’. Her responsibilities ranged from daily tasks like laundry to more specialized skills such as poetry reading and music playing.\n\nTaizong was impressed with Wu’s intelligence and hired her as his secretary, where she was constantly involved in high-level state affairs. She was given the title of cairen; the 5th ranked imperial consort.\n\nMany young men at court were drawn to her, including Prince Li Zhi, Taizong’s son.\n\nAfter Taizong died in 649 CE, his concubines were sent to Ganye Temple and had to shave their heads, including Wu. This was a standard procedure after an emperor’s death, where his concubines were compelled to leave the court and begin a new life if other emperors could not use them.\n\nHowever, when Li Zhi became emperor and named Gaozong, he brought Wu back to court as a concubine, although he already had others and a wife.\n\nRISE TO POWER\n\nBy the early 650s CE, Wu had become Emperor Gaozong’s official concubine, with the title of zhaoyi – the highest ranking of the nine concubines of the second rank, despite being legally required to remain in the temple as a nun.\n\nLady Wang, Gaozong’s wife, and Xiao Shufei, his former first concubine, were jealous of Wu. Lady Wang had no child, while Lady Xiao had a son and two daughters. Likewise, Wu had a son, Li Hong, in 652 CE, and another son, Li Xian, in 653 CE.\n\nLady Wang and Lady Xiao, however, were not threatened as Gaozong had already chosen a successor; his chancellor, Liu Shi, was Lady Wang’s uncle, and Gaozong named Liu Shi’s son, Li Zhong, as his heir.\n\nIn 654 CE, Wu had a daughter, but the child died soon after birth. Wu accused the wife of the Emperor Gaozong, Empress Wang, of murder. Wang was the last person to be seen in the area, and she had no other excuse. Wu also implicated Lady Xiao and Lady Wang’s mother as witchcraft practitioners; they were found guilty of all the accusations.\n\nGaozong exiled Lady Xiao, disposed of his wife, and her mother was prohibited from entering the palace. The removal of Lady Wang’s uncle, chancellor Liu Shi, from his position eliminated his son as Gaozong’s heir.\n\nIn 655 CE, Wu became Emperor Gaozong’s new empress consort. She was assured that her sons would be the Emperor’s successor.\n\nEMPRESS CONSORT\n\nLady Wu was a modest, reserved emperor’s wife in public, yet she held real power. She carefully expelled all enemies from the court, and she killed Lady Wang and Lady Xiao.\n\nWu effectively ruled China as the emperor from 660 CE on. Although she did not hold that title, she was the driving force behind the operation and managed imperial affairs while pregnant with her daughter, Taiping, in 665 CE.\n\nWu saw no reason why women couldn’t engage in the same activities and occupy the same positions as men as she had been brought up by her father to believe she was equal to men.\n\nOne example of her influence would be that she led a group of women to Mount Tai (an ancient ceremonial center) in 666 CE, where they performed rituals that had previously only been carried out by men. Additionally, in 668 CE, she planned military operations against Korea that were so successful that they reduced Korea to the rank of a vassal state.\n\nBoth of these had nothing to do with Emperor Gaozong. Gaozong required reports to be read because he had a disease that affected his eyes. Wu either told him whatever she wanted to him hear and then made her own decisions, or she told him the truth and still took independent action.\n\nIn 674 CE, Gaozong adopted the title Tian Huang (Emperor of Heaven), while Wu modified hers to Tian Hou (Empress of Heaven). They ruled as divine monarchs until Gaozong’s passing in 683 CE. Wu became empress dowager, and her first son Li Zhe became Emperor Zhongzong.\n\nWhen Zhongzhong showed signs of disobeying his mother, Empress Dowager Wu deposed and exiled him.\n\nWu’s youngest son, Li Dan, succeeded him as Emperor Ruizong. Ruizong remained a virtual prisoner, attending no imperial functions and never being transferred to the imperial quarters.\n\nIn 690 CE, Wu deposed her son and declared herself huangdi, or “Empress Regnant.”\n\nTHE NEW DYNASTY\n\nWu proclaimed herself Emperor Zetian, the new ruler of China. She was the first and only woman to occupy the Dragon Throne and rule in her own right. She chose the name Zetian, which translates to “Ruler of the Heavens.” She wished to make it clear that a new type of ruler and a new order had come to power in China.\n\nShe started by changing the state’s name from Tang to Zhou. The Chinese Empire was known as the Zhou dynasty from 690 to 705.\n\nWu eliminated many of her rivals, whether real, potential, or perceived. Her methods included execution, suicide, and direct murder. She ordered the imprisonment of any Tang Dynasty royal family members to ensure the safety of her new rule.\n\nConfucianism was a set of ideas that many people in ancient China adhered to. These ideas held that women should stay at home and care for their families and that women could not hold power. To get around this, Wu declared Buddhism the state religion.\n\nShe declared herself to be an incarnation of the Maitreya Buddha, going by the name Empress Shengsen. To support this, Wu ordered that the largest Maitreya statues in the Longmen Caves outside of Luoyang face be sculpted to resemble her.\n\nWu established an undercover police force and spied in court nationwide. With early notice of any plots in the works provided by this spy system, she was able to deal with any threats to her rule before they materialized into actual issues. She also placed copper mailboxes outside imperial government buildings to encourage citizens to report on others in secret.\n\nEmpress Wu used her intelligence to change the organizational structure of the government and got rid of anyone she thought was not performing their duties, which led to lower spending and higher efficiency. She replaced them with intelligent and talented bureaucrats, making no consideration for their connections or family backgrounds.\n\nIn order to further distinguish her Zhou Dynasty from the Tang, she developed new characters for the Chinese writing system that are now referred to as Chinese Characters of Empress Wu or Zetian Characters. Wu intended for these characters to take the place of 10 to 30 of the more established characters and to alter the way her people wrote and thought. Some of these are:\n\nREIGNS AND REFORMS\n\nMany of Empress Wu’s public reforms were well-received, as suggested by the people themselves, by establishing direct communication between the people and herself. This aided her in gaining and retaining support for her rule.\n\nShe improved the public education system by appointing devoted teachers and rearranging the bureaucracy and teaching strategies.\n\nUnder Wu’s leadership, agricultural output reached an all-time high. She improved the department of agriculture and the taxation system by rewarding officials who produced the most crops and levied the fewest taxes on their constituents. She ordered to write and distribute farming manuals. She formed teams to map the terrain, construct irrigation ditches to aid in crop growth, and redistribute the land to give everyone an equal share of the land to farm. She also reformed the military by requiring commanders to pass military exams, which were given to civil servants. The exam was designed to assess intelligence and decision-making, and candidates were personally interviewed rather than appointed solely based on family connections.\n\nThe military campaigns she sent out expanded and secured the country’s borders. She was also able to reopen the Silk Road, which had been closed due to the plague of 682 CE. Wu also reclaimed lands that had been invaded and distributed them so that they were not all held by aristocrats.\n\nREMOVAL AND DEATH\n\nWu’s grip on power began to weaken in 697 CE when she started spending more time with her young lovers, known as the Zhang Brothers than on ruling China. They were despised by the court and senior officials, many of whom warned the empress of their nefarious activities. She ignored these warnings, and as her health deteriorated, she increasingly relied on the Zhang brothers’ care.\n\nIn 704 CE, Wu’s behavior was no longer tolerated by court officials, and the Zhang brothers were executed. Wu was forced to abdicate the throne for her exiled son Zhongzong and his wife Wei to succeed her. She died a year later, on December 16, 705, at the age of 82.\n\nEmpress Wu was buried alongside Gaozong in a tomb in Qian County, Shanxi Province. As was customary, a massive stele was built outside the grave, but the marker remains blank. Despite all of her reforms and the prosperity she brought to the country, Wu was remembered primarily for her crimes against friends and family members. She was not considered worthy of an inscription.\n\nEmpress Wu Zetian is remembered today as one of China’s greatest rulers. The Chinese TV series Women of the Tang Dynasty (2013), which starred actress Hui Yinghong as Wu Zetian, was a huge success, attesting to the continued fascination with China’s first and only female ruler.\n\nEmpress Wu Worksheets\n\nThis fantastic bundle includes everything you need to know about Empress Wu across 29 in-depth pages.
