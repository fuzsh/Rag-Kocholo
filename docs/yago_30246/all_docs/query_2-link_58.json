        "text": "T'ang Dynastyera saw monumental shifts from north China plain to Yangtze River Basin (which becomes major food-producing region) and southern coastal areas, creating new centers of population, production, and trade. The Tang era produced renewed urban expansion; renaissance in the arts, scholarship, and invention; institutionalized education and civil service exams for the (shi) scholar-bureaucrat testing knowledge of imperial dynasties, painting, calligraphy, poetry, law, mathematics, and astronomy. The Tang were also receptive to foreign contacts. (See Paul Brians' Lecture 21: Sui, T'ang, & Song (Sung) Dynasties)\n\nReviving Confucianism, Tang Emperor Tai-zong (626-649) played the role of the perfect Confucian ruler: responsible, self-critical, and attentive to the counsel of his Confucian advisors.\n\n668: Conquest of Korea(...and later Tibet & part of Sinkiang). The Tang expanded the boundaries of China through Siberia in the north, Korea in the east, and what is now Vietnam in the south. They also extended their control into modern-day Afghanistan of the Silk Road (Oliver Wild, 1992: the most significant trade commodity of which was not silk, but religion. Buddhism came to China from India along the northern branch of the Silk Road. See pictures of the region).\n\nChinese prose, as well as poetry, flourished during the Tang dynasty. Poetic skill was required for success on the civil examinations for young men aspiring to become scholar-bureaucrats in the imperial system. Literary skill was also a means of social advancement.\n\nLI PO (701-762)\n\nIn reaction against the highly artificial \"literary\" prose of the era, and in the midst of mid-Tang era political and cultural turmoil, one prose master Han Yü (768-824) advocated a \"neo-classical\" stylethat is, a return to simple and straightforward writing in the classical style, and the return to Confucian values, rather than simply memorizing their content and forms. Han Yu championed \"old style prose\" free of stylized formality. As a result of Han Yü's influence, political and philosophical treatises, informal essays, and tales of the marvelous (ch'uan-ch'i) were all written in the \"neoclassical\" style, and encouraged the development of longer and more complex prose narratives. In this style, tales of supernatural encounters with ghosts and amorous fox-women, as well as human romances of daring in love and boldness of action set in the world of courtesans, represent some of the early specimens of Chinese literary fiction.\n\nSome Tang era court women, at times of a freer climate, gained reputations as poets and as a culture of romance developed at the end of the 8th century, female characters appeared as heroines in stories, not just as exemplars of virtue. The imaginative possibility of romantic love and free choice took hold, though the social realities of arranged marriage and sexuality as a means to power remained the social and political reality.\n\nSee the Earliest Printed Book (CE 868)\n\nThe first Song emperor decided to be guided by the principle of wenemphasizing civil, rather than military, government, cultural values and \"literature.\" He was a strong supporter of scholarly projects, commissioning large compilations and preservations of Tang classical literature and tales that would otherwise have been lost. Song \"Neo-Confucianism\" (Dao-xue, or \"the study of the [Confucian] way\") stressed taking the creed to \"heart,\" calling for a more personal commitment to Confucian values, measuring ones attitudes and behaviors against the values in the Confucian Classics, and developed into an elaborated philosophy and personal religion. These \"neo-Confucianist\" attitudes encouraged multiple and divergent interpretations of the Classics, rather than single authoritative interpretation of consensus. Buddhism and Daoism waned but their influence can be seen in the ways the Song reshaped Han- and Tang-era Confucianism.\n\nPrinting, which existed but was not widely used during the Tang era, was institutionalized in commercial and imperial printing shops, providing uniform if not always carefully edited, editions of the Confucian Classics and the collected Daoist scriptures to be used throughout the empire. Printing of books made of light paper revolutionized access to and storage of old and new literary works. (SeeChinese Use of Paper.) The Song government was less aristocratic than the Tang, opening the way wider to less aristocratic aspirants on the basis of loyalty to the state rather than of family connections and patronage.\n\nThe \"old prose style\" of Tang-era Han Yu was enthusiastically taken up by the Song. New styles of informal prose were explored in effort to convey more of the naturalness and ease of speech. Ou-yang Xiu (1007-1072) represented the new kind of writer and intellectual of the Song period: more learned, possessed of broader interests, and an excellent judge of talent who promoted new political and literary figures of merit, rather than family connection. His poetry and prose established the lucid, balanced, genial Northern Song style. Ou-yang Xius informal writing of random notes on thoughts, experiences, and current events, and fragmentary reminiscences delivered with casual grace, such as Remarks on Poetry (Shi-hua) created a new genre of literary criticism.\n\nSee Guanyin (or Kuan-yin, the Buddhist god/goddess of mercy) of the Water Moon, Northern Song/Tangut, ink and color on silk scroll, dated to CE 968, from the Dunhuang Buddhist complex controlled by the Tangut people, for whom Buddhism is still the dominant religion. After approximately the mid-Tang, institutional Buddhism held much less appeal for the Chinese intelligentsia and upper classes. In Song society and afterwards, Buddhism was increasingly appropriated by native traditions, most obviously Neo-Confucianism, and was progressively weakened. Men of quality now rejected the Buddhist priesthood for themselves or their sons, and once-great temples fell into disrepair. Buddhism among the peasant masses tended to fuse with Daoist and folk-religious elements into an almost undifferentiated popular religion.\n\nWhile Buddhism ceased to be a major movement, it continued to influence Chinese arts, language, thought. Ch'an Buddhism had always stressed the immediacy of the spoken word and vernacular speech over the \"dead letter\" of Buddhist scripture. The most important uses of the written vernacular came in producing written versions of oral arts traditions in the Song era urban culture. There in the entertainment quarters existed a rich world of performance literature enjoyed by commoner and elite alike.\n\nA revival of interest in the few extant examples of the ancient tradition of storytelling stimulated skillful storytelling during this period of spectacular literary achievement, and storytelling became a popular form of entertainment. The stories told by the professional entertainers, each of whom specialized in a certain type, including Buddhist sutras, chivalric romances, popular history. Another category of storyteller specialized in xiao-shuo (now translated as \"fiction\"): love stories, stories of heroic bandits, crime stories with a Confucian magistrate as detective. These popular storytelling genres were written down and printed in storybooks, called hua-pen, which later inspired longer Chinese novels. Out of another performance genre of musical narratives mixing verse and prose emerged theater.\n\nWhile not intended to be written down, Southern Song commercial publishers, always on the look out for new material, discovered the appeals of such performance literature, and in the Song Dynasty era began a continuous tradition of written vernacular literature in print for later generations to enjoy, emulate, and develop.\n\nChinese Calendar:Illustrations from Muniutu, 1609, woodblock edition, British Library, Oriental and India Office Collections, 1997: \"The two illustrations show the herdboy and the ox, a much-loved traditional theme in Chinese painting, illustration and decorative arts. They are reproduced from an edition of the Muniutu in the Library's Chinese collection. This Chan (Zen) Buddhist text relates in text and ten pictures the taming of an ox as an allegory of subduing the 'self'.\"\n\n\"Traditionally, the Chinese calendar was based on a cycle of sixty years, calculated by combining the Ten Heavenly Stems with the Twelve Earthly Branches in sequence. Thus, from Chinese New Year's day, which this year [1997] falls on 7 February, the year will be designated dingchou, and also referred to as the year of the ox. According to one story (there are several versions), the ox owes its place as the second of the Twelve Animals to its nature. When leading the Twelve to the Buddha's deathbed it allowed the rat to ride on its back. However, it was beaten to the Buddha's bedside by the wily rodent, which jumped down and scampered ahead as they drew close. The person born in an ox year is characterised as one who tends to grumble but who, nevertheless, is big-hearted and long-suffering.\n\n\"The twelve animals are those which, according to legend, were the first to arrive at the Buddha's deathbed. In order they are the rat, ox, tiger, hare, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, cockerel, dog and pig. Accordingly, the Buddha linked each of these with a year. The twelve year cycle was also integrated with the five elements - wood, metal, earth, fire and water - and other symbols, such as the five colours. The animals were only linked in this way with the five elements to form the sixty year cycle during the period of the Tang dynasty (618-907). \""
