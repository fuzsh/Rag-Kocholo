Larger forces predominate. Yet biog­ raphy provides important access to world history. It shows how individuals helped shape the society around them. Biography also offers concrete illustrations of larger patterns in political and intellectual life, in family life, and in the economy. The Longman Library of World Biography series seeks to capture the individuality and drama that mark human character. It deals with individuals operating in one of the main periods of world history, while also reflecting issues in the particular society around them. Here, the individual illustrates larger themes of time and place. The interplay between the personal and the gen­ eral is always the key to using biography in history, and world history is no exception. Always, too, there is the question of personal agency: how much do individuals, even great ones, shape their own lives and environment, and how much are they shaped by the world around them? Peter N. Stea rn s\n\nAuthons If reface\n\nWhat’s in a Source? Wu Zhao (624-705), the only woman to become emperor of China, was a nonesuch, a singular and striking figure. Fraught with drama, murder, intrigue, mysticism, deception, sex, and madness, her story is both wildly improbable and highly com­ pelling: a fiercely ambitious woman’s stunning ascent from her early years of provincial obscurity as the second daughter of a lumber merchant to her enthronement as emperor of the vast Chinese nation. Though Chinese history is filled with empresses, the wives of ruling emperors, and even powerful dowagers, widowed empresses who sometimes held sway over weak sons who sat on the throne, neither any woman before her nor any woman since has occupied this position at the very apex of po­ litical power. Tracing the tangled course of her life sheds vital light on the nature of court, society, and gender relations, and on the roles of ritual, symbol, and aesthetics in imperial politics in traditional China. The biographer who would tell this story must sift through a tremendous volume of material written on Wu Zhao, sources both primary and secondary, Confucian and Buddhist, Chinese and Western. Despite this abundance of material, as an histori­ cal figure Wu Zhao remains difficult to grasp. Standard histo­ ries, annals compiled by court order to chronicle the events of the past dynasties, often present her as an illegitimate, ruthless usurper who, surrounded by male favorites, ruled through nepo­ tism and terror. Flowery rhetoric written by her propagandists depicts her as a benevolent and sagacious maternal figure, a de­ vout Buddhist monarch, nurturing the children of her empire.\n\nVarious legends and myths of nebulous origin further cloud the picture. In these diverse sources one often finds glaring inconsis­ tencies. Even today, details pertaining to the most fundamental aspects of Wu Zhao’s life remain uncertain: Scholars still argue over when and where she was born. Researchers revisit the many questions that continue to swirl around Wu Zhao: Did she murder her own sons because they impeded her path to the throne? Was Li Hsien Wu Z hao’s son or the son of her elder sis­ ter? Did Wu Zhao poison her husband, Emperor Gaozong? Was her belief in Buddhism sincere? Was her Buddhist monk-adviser really her lover? H ow did a woman rise to become emperor in a patriarchal, Confucian society? What was the intent behind the Blank Stele erected upon Wu Z hao’s death? This biography at­ tempts to answer all of these questions. The three main sources that provide the better part of the material for this biography are standard histories: Liu X u ’s Old Tang History (completed in 945), Ouyang X iu ’s New Tang H is­ tory (completed in 1060), and Sima Guang’s Comprehensive Mirror for the Advancement o f Governance (completed in the 1080s). The Old Tang History contains a basic annals, a yearby-year, month-by-month account of significant events, ap­ pointments, and court events during her reign. It also includes biographies of Wu Zhao’s kinsmen and political allies like her monk-lover Xue Huaiyi. The New Tang History contains two separate accounts of Wu Zhao, the first a basic annals and the second in “ Biographies of Empresses and Consorts.” I also drew heavily upon court chronicles from 648 to 705 in the Compre­ hensive Mirror—records that are supplemented by important commentaries. Written more than two hundred years after Wu Zhao’s death, the standard histories, the Old Tang History, the New Tang History, and the Comprehensive Mirror issue from an era when politics and customs—especially customs regarding women— all changed radically. Liu X u ’s harsh verdict, delivered at the end o f his account of her reign was: “ Empress Wu’s conspiracy to seize the position of Empress Wang by choking the breath from her own swaddling infant; her mincing and pickling of enemies,\n\ngrinding their bones into dust—who would not claim this to be egregious?” Students familiar with Western history might be surprised at the nature of Chinese standard histories. Unlike Western histo­ ries, these sources contain a great deal of what is represented as dialogue between rulers and officials. For instance, the Compre­ hensive Mirror contains an extensive discussion between Wu Zhao and her court ministers in which the officials tried to dis­ credit the old empress’s favorites, the Zhang brothers, while convincing her to expediently cede her throne back to her son Li Xian. On the eve of exile, one minister warned Wu Zhao, “ Though I’m old and there’s only one chance in ten that I’ll return alive, there will m ost certainly come a day when Your Majesty will think o f me again.” “And when will that be?” Wu Zhao queried. “ On the day these two little brats [the Zhang brothers] bring about the calamitous end of your dynasty!”\n\nSet down in the Comprehensive Mirror almost four centuries after the debate occurred, this dialogue is not a simple tran­ scription of an argument in Wu Zhao’s court. The biographer must always recall that official history had a political purpose. Court historians carefully doctored, crafted, and refined these dialogues with the aim of contrasting the moral integrity of principled ministers with the oily sycophancy of their backbit­ ing opponents. The Comprehensive Mirror includes the fiery speech of such an “ upright” minister, who browbeats Wu Zhao, saying, “ The legitimacy of your rule is built upon the founda­ tion of the House of Tang. Yet though in terms of his years and his virtue the Crown Prince is in full bloom, Your M ajesty has forgotten the deep bond of gratitude between mother and son and jealously keeps hold of his precious throne. H ow do you have the face to visit the ancestral temple of the House of Tang?” H ow reliable are these official sources? At times, these offi­ cial sources are patently unreliable. The Comprehensive Mirror described how Wu Zhao smothered her own newborn infant then blamed the child’s death on Empress Wang, who earlier had dandled the child for a few minutes. Did Wu Zhao feign\n\nhorror when she and Gaozong discovered their tiny child dead? Was a scribe concealed behind the curtains of the nursery taking notes as these horrific events unfolded? The biographer must be a detective. Later in the same text, during the trial of Empress Wang, the infant’s death is not even mentioned. Empress Wang was deposed not on the grounds of being a murderer, but largely because she had given Gaozong no heir. This leaves the reader to question whether the incident ever occurred at all. Fortunately, there are many sources outside of these three main histories that can help provide a more nuanced and bal­ anced perspective. Court records from Wu Zhao’s era are collated in the Essential Documents o f the Tang, a wide-ranging topical collection of important official documents from the Tang dynasty (618-907) compiled by Wang Pu in the late tenth century. The Complete Collection o f Tang Documents, compiled by Dong H ao in the mid-Qing dynasty (1644-1911), contains an array of documents contemporary to Wu Zhao, from elegant epitaphs to edicts announcing new reign eras to court memorials to prefaces for ceremonial manuals. The Complete Anthology o f Tang Poetry contains both verse written for and poems written by Wu Zhao. Buddhist documents remain from her era, contained both in the vast Taisho Tripitika—a massive compilation of Buddhist sutras, treatises and laws—and among the scrolls found in the Dunhuang caves. Local histories like Song M inqiu’s Treatise on Henan, written in the first half of the Song dynasty (960-1279), include accounts of events that occurred in Luoyang during Wu Zhao’s lifetime. Unofficial sources like the Taiping guangji, compiled by Li Fang during the early Song dynasty, also offer a rich repository for stories relating to Wu Zhao and her reign. These sources contain many documents attributed to Wu Zhao herself, and many others written by her supporters and propagandists. The Complete Collection o f Tang Documents alone provides four chapters of imperial edicts, imperial orders, essays, memorials, and epitaph inscriptions, all purportedly written by Wu Zhao. I also draw heavily on Regulations for Ministers, a largely unexplored but very important political treatise, and The Complete Anthology o f Tang Poetry, which contains 46 of her poems.\n\nEssential Documents o f the Tang is a rich source for cere­ monies like the feng and sban rites, Buddhist prohibitions, and the construction and renaming of Buddhist temples. I have also drawn on Du You’s Comprehensive Institutions, a history from the late Tang that proved a valuable repository of court music and a useful source for the intense debate on the proper number of ancestral temples. Given the often-biased nature of the official histories, I have also looked to less obvious and orthodox sources. Unofficial sources like the Taiping guangji, a collection of miscellany from the Song dynasty, provide valuable popular perspectives and con­ tain fragments of many sources close to Wu Zhao’s period such as the Chaoye qianzai, D a Tang xinyu, and Sui-Tang jiahua. Some of the many episodes lifted from the Taiping guangji in­ clude the Royal Astrologer’s warning to Taizong that a “ female emperor” would supplant the Tang, descriptions of Buddhist master painter Weichi Yi’s works, and Di Renjie’s interpretation of Wu Z hao’s dream about a parrot with broken wings. Also included are stories of Ming Chongyan showcasing his magical talents for Gaozong, the sudden emergence of M ount Felicity, and the presentation of a clumsily wrought three-legged sunbird at Wu Z hao’s court. Some stories strain the limits of. credulity, such as the tale of the mysterious golden toad with the character “Wu” on its back in imperial vermilion or the story of a wildman who drank an entire crockpot of bean sauce in a single draught. The Taiping guangji also contains a seditious poem about the two flames and a mysterious ditty about a single strand of hemp cutting down the Heavenly Pivot. While the three main histories contain a negative bias against Wu Zhao, flowery praise written by literary masters to legitimize Wu Z hao’s political authority is just as problematic. When Wu Zhao established her own dynasty, one of her rhetoricians, Chen Z i’ang, gushed, “ As Sage Mother and Emperor o f the people, Your Majesty is benevolent and filial, reverent and honored, di­ vine and enlightened,” as recorded in the Complete Collection o f Tang Documents. Buddhist propaganda like the Commentary on the Great Cloud Sutra contains prophecies of a Buddhist monarch who would “ reign over the territory of a country with the body of a woman.” In his commentary on the Flower Garland\n\nSutra, Wu Zhao’s Buddhist supporter Fazang wrote, “ Saintly and divine, she [is] . . . infinitely good and infinitely beautiful, she displays the Ten Goodnesses beyond all limits.” On the in­ scription of the Coiling Dragon Terrace Stele that Wu Zhao erected for her parents, talented aesthete Li Qiao described the miraculous birth of the woman emperor’s father amidst fivecolored mists and auspicious vapors. This inscription, found in the Complete Collection o f Tang Documents, reflects an obvious effort on Wu Z hao’s part to exalt her own genealogy. Local histories also provided useful material. The Treatise on Henan focused upon place names in Luoyang, helped provide details about Phoenix Viewing Tower, the site of Wu Z hao’s death in 705. The Dengfeng County Annals contain stories about Wu Z hao’s poetry outing to Stony Torrents. Some sources contain rather dubious if colorful local lore, such as the story from Legends o f Mount Song of Wu Zhao hearing the bird warning against women drinking alcohol. Thus, a biographer is left to weigh the conflicting materials, blending the biased official histories, the Buddhist propaganda and prophecies, the fulsome memorials, and the tall tales from unofficial sources into a coherent narrative of Wu Zhao’s life and political career. While based on primary sources, this biog­ raphy does not contain footnotes or citations. I also avoided the tedious practice of prefacing each event or quote with, “ accord­ ing to the Comprehensive Mirror and Essential Documents o f the T an g . . . ” or “ the accounts in the Old Tang History and the Taiping guangji differ from the records in the New Tang History in that . . . ” At the end of this volume, A Note on the Sources provides further information on the way sources are employed. The Glossary indicates where in the historical records one can find major characters, peoples, and places.\n\nAcknowledgments The guidance and wisdom of several prominent scholars from mainland China, specifically Hu Ji and Zhao Wenrun, both professors in the Department of History at Shaanxi Normal University in X i’an, have proved invaluable in the writing of this biography. Both scholars were very gracious with their time\n\nand insights. Cheng Zheng of the Shaanxi Academy of Fine Arts, author of The Three Hundred Li Museum: Stone Carvings o f the Eighteen Tang Tombs, generously traveled with me to both Shunling, the tomb of Wu Z hao’s mother, and Qianling, the fu­ nerary park where both Gaozong and Wu Zhao are buried, dis­ cussing numerous legends and tales relating to each venue. Special thanks are due Suzanne Cahill, whose timely advice on early drafts greatly helped in shaping this project. Linda Cooke Johnson, too, offered valuable counsel, both in her con­ scientious editing and in helping frame the “Author’s Preface” and “Notes on the Sources.” A debt of gratitude is also due the other scholars chosen by Longman to review the draft of this biography, particularly Pamela Sayre, who took the time to edit the entire manuscript. I would also like to offer special thanks to Kami Smith, Ashleigh Dean, and Chris Sylvester for their gener­ ous assistance in editing the manuscript and offering valuable suggestions; and to David Wilson in the Center for Instructional Research and Technology at the University of North Florida, whose technical virtuosity was invaluable in preparing maps and charts. And thanks to Steven Robinson for allowing me to use his photograph of Fengxian Temple. Finally, I must thank Chengmei, my wife, and Viola Luolan, my daughter, for their encouragement, support, and ceaseless efforts to keep the irrepressible Liu Hurricane out of my study.\n\nA Note Regarding Names With the exception of Li Hsien, whose name is written in the Wade-Giles system of romanization to distinguish him from his younger brother (or, rather, half-brother) Li Xian, all Chinese names herein have been written in pinyin. I have used the Chinese name for Mochuo, the Turkish khan who plagued Wu Zhao in the late 690s and first years of the eighth century, rather than Bag Chor or Qapaghan, as he is otherwise known. I have used Sanskrit names of Buddhist monks like Siksananda and Bodhiruci, rather than render them in pinyin. Chinese emperors are almost always known by posthumous temple names rather than personal names. Herein, I use posthu­ mous temple names for the first three Tang emperors, Gaozu\n\n(High Progenitor), Taizong (Grand Ancestor), and Gaozong (High Ancestor). However, in Wu Z hao’s case and for her two sons, Li Xian and Li Dan, both of whom serve as emperor in the course of the narrative, I have chosen to use their personal names. I use Wu Z hao’s self-determined personal name rather than her posthu­ mous title because to call her Empress Wu, Wu Zetian or Empress Conforming to Heaven simply serves to recast her, following Confucian “rectification of names,” as a lesser being and to deni­ grate her remarkable career. I keep the personal names of Li Xian and Li Dan because using their personal names rather than more solemn and formal posthumous names reflects their junior status, not only as sons to a redoubtable mother but in the eyes of history.

Certainly, Gaozong was aware o f his limitations and of the capability of Wu Zhao, her keen wit, her surpassing intelligence, and her political acumen. During G ao­ zong’s life, however, Wu Zhao never wielded total authority, nor did she independently command the imperial court. Rather, Gaozong and Wu Zhao developed a genuine partnership, shar­ ing the ponderous responsibility of imperial authority. As with most partnerships, the two members of the imperial couple were not always in perfect accord. At times, they worked at cross purposes and had serious conflicts. Almost invariably, Wu Zhao won these struggles of power and will. G aozojigJiadjJrjuX i^m stitutiaa.

The histories record a solar eclipse as the imperial cortege left Bingzhou in 660 and headed to Luoyang, recently designated the Eastern Capital. This is the his­ torians’ way of saying that the male Emperor, the sun, had\n\nfallen under the umbra of the Empress. N ot long after the impe­ rial train reached Luoyang, Gaozong was stricken by a serious illness that would plague him for decades to come. Assailed by fever, his humors out o f kilter, the young Emperor’s head swelled, his eyes lost focus, and he became dizzy and disori­ ented. It appears that Gaozong had a stroke. Unable to attend to his public duties as Emperor, he called upon the person he trusted most, Wu Zhao, to assist him. At this time, there was little alternative; they could not very well place the responsibili­ ties of state upon the eight-year-old Crown Prince Li Hong. This opened up the opportunity for Wu Zhao’s direct involve­ ment in the public, male arena. Once she entered this arena, she did not leave. Until Gaozong’s death in 683, she often sat be­ hind a curtain in the audience hall and jointly deliberated upon administrative decisions with her husband. With her broad learning, intelligence, and consummate skill in understanding and manipulating people, Wu Zhao proved a very capable politician. Still, Gaozong was not her puppet, and she never singlehandedly dominated the court. During her first decade as Em­ press, there is little evidence to show that she played a major hand in military affairs and foreign policy, such as the massive campaigns against Korea in the 660s. Instead, she shared politi­ cal authority with Gaozong. Because both made decisions and wielded political influence, people of the time called the couple the “Two Sages.” Back in antiquity, the first two kings of the Zhou dynasty, the classical era from which Wu Zhao would later draw her dynastic name, were also known as the “Two Sages.” Confucian scholars have harshly criticized Wu Zhao, citing her public political involvement as evidence that she was a woman of bald ambition who coveted power. Alternatively, one could argue that she was motivated by a desire to relieve G ao­ zong’s burden, a wife bent on protecting her ailing husband from the mental and emotional strain of his lofty office, while carrying out his wishes and policies. Gaozong was certainly not an invalid. Though his spells of illness were intense and recurring, they generally only lasted several weeks to a month. Less than two months after he fell ill\n\nin Bingzhou, he was back in the saddle, out on a hunt to the southwest of Luoyang. In 661, Gaozong wanted to personally command the campaign against Korea, but Wu Zhao, con­ cerned that the hostile northerly climate would prompt a recur­ rence of his illness, dissuaded him. Curiously, on this occasion and others, she influenced her husband by court memorial rather than private plea. Still, neither Gaozong’s illness nor their shared political du­ ties hindered their intimacy. In 662, Wu Zhao bore another son, Li Dan, and roughly two years later, at forty, she had a daugh­ ter, the Taiping Princess. She tenderly doted upon this last and youngest girl child, their only surviving daughter. Wu Zhao believed in prophecies and omens—particularly those that betokened her rising fortune. In 663, reports surfaced that a qilin, a Chinese unicorn, had been sighted to the northeast of Luoyang and, a few days later, that the beast had left an impres­ sion of its hoof before the newly constructed administrative and ritual heart of Luoyang, Hanyuan Palace. The qilin—Japanese Kirin Beer takes its name from this mythic creature—is a color­ ful hybrid with a dragon’s scales, a horse’s hooves, a wolf’s brow, and the tail of an ox. Believing that the auspicious ener­ gies of the extraordinary creature could be channeled into a name that redounded to her greater glory, she sponsored an edict that changed the reign name of the following year to Uni­ corn Virtue. In 665, the Royal Astrologer Li Shunfeng, the self­ same man who 17 years earlier had made a prophecy about a “ female ruler” in Taizong’s Inner Palace, designed a new “Uni­ corn Virtue calendar, which the Two Sages officially imple­ mented. Perhaps Wu Zhao had learned that this man’s advice had prevented Taizong from killing one-third of the imperial harem en masse, herself included! In this case, the omen, the appearance of an auspicious crea­ ture, was harmless, but sometimes her belief in the occult took on a more ominous aspect. As her father had back in Sichuan, she sometimes summoned magicians and miracle workers. In 664, Guo Xingzhen, a D aoist practitioner of the magical arts, began to visit her frequently in the Inner Palace. He was skilled in a sort of black magic used to overcome one’s enemies, arcana\n\nnot dissimilar to that which Wu Zhao had accused her former rival, Empress Wang, of using against her. Particularly within the walls of the imperial palace, use of such dark magic was a crime punishable by death. The Tang Code of laws states, “When sorcery is directed toward the emperor, all involved shall be punished by decapitation.” A eunuch reported Guo Xingzhen’s visits to the Inner Palace to Gaozong, who was infuriated. He secretly summoned Shangguan Yi, one of the few chief ministers not in Wu Zhao’s camp, to ask his advice. The minister replied, “ The August Empress is arrogant and unrestrained. Within the four seas, all are gravely concerned. I humbly request that you depose her.” Impulsive Gaozong, still in a pique, assented and ordered him to draft the edict. Once again, Wu Zhao was saved by the alacrity of her wide network of eyes and ears. The news reached her swiftly, and she rushed to find her husband sitting with a draft of the edict in hand. Confronted by his wife, in a trice Gaozong’s terrible re­ solve melted, softening into weak indulgence. Holding up the edict with cringing deference, he prevaricated, “This was never my intention. This is all due to Shangguan Yi’s instruction.” With that, he tore the edict of deposal to pieces. Her faithful ally X u Jingzong, ever prepared to precipitate the fall of his mistress’ enemies, wasted no time in presenting Gaozong a memorial implicating his fellow chief minister in a desperate plot to restore exiled former Crown Prince Li Zhong. According to his clever memorial, a decade earlier, the eunuch who had “ fabricated” the story of Wu Z hao’s sorcery had been a domestic in the household of the former Crown Prince at the same time Shangguan Yi had been Li Zhong’s adviser. In a des­ perate ploy to restore the old order, Shangguan Yi and the eu­ nuch had hatched this vile scheme to malign Wu Zhao by ac­ cusing her of practicing black magic. Gaozong unquestioningly accepted X u Jingzong’s interpretation of events. By imperial edict, Shangguan Yi’s estate was confiscated, he was impris­ oned, and shortly thereafter he died. His son, too, was impli­ cated and dispensed with in prison. Curiously, Shangguan Yi’s i nfa n t granddaughter, Wan’er was spared and made a palace\n\nslave. Later this tiny girl would grow up to be a talented essay­ ist, poet, and official under Wu Z hao’s administration. N ot surprisingly,- a chill of terror gripped the court in the af­ termath of Shangguan Yi’s death. Those considered Shangguan Yi’s political allies were demoted and sent away from the capi­ tal. Gaozong’s ministers were increasingly hesitant to speak openly or to criticize any imperial decision. A year later, he turned to his ministers and asked them, in a manner that almost reflected hurt, “ With an open heart I seek your remonstrance, yet why is it that no one comes forward to remonstrate?” Li Ji, the sole member of the “ old guard” who had supported Wu Zhao’s bid to become Empress, answered with oily elegance, “ Because of Your M ajesty’s perfect goodness, there is no matter about which us humble ministers might remonstrate.” As news arrived in the provinces that the men who had sup­ ported him to become Crown Prince were being driven from court and killed, star-crossed Li Zhong had become progres­ sively taken by paranoia, dressing in his wife’s clothing and concealing himself. Eventually, word of his madness circulated in court, and he was downgraded to commoner and exiled to the deep Southland. There, when his alleged role in Shangguan Yi’s plot became known, he was forced to commit suicide. In respect to her own kinsmen, Wu Zhao had two contradic­ tory aims. On one hand, she wished to dissociate herself from past empresses and dowagers notorious for using their influence to stock the court with family members. On the other, she wanted to elevate the fortunes of the Wu clan, both living and dead, for she would lose face if all her kinsmen had neither rank nor title and were perceived as graceless and inelegant bump­ kins. To this end, she elevated her parents at every opportunity. However, her wish to raise up the living Wus was complicated by her pronounced dislike for her closest Wu kinsmen, her older half brothers and their children. To mark the felicitous occasion of her ascent to Empress, she invited her entire clan to a celebratory feast. At this juncture, her elder brothers and one nephew were serving as vice-ministers in the court. Recalling her shabby treatment at the hands of her\n\nWu in-laws in Bingzhou during her husband’s funeral, Wu Zhao’s mother Madame Yang, now grandly titled Lady of Rong, drunkenly exulted, “ Do the lot of you still recall the old days? How do you like things now?” Playing the role of the ideal Confucian minister with gusto, a cheeky grandnephew, whose official duty was keeping imperial bodyguards in good fettle, pointedly countered, “ A real official is appointed on the basis of merit, not family connections. That sort of station brings disaster, not honor.” The word for “ honor” he used in this rhetorical flourish was rong, the same as that in her title, Lady of Rong. The implication that her titles and status were dishonorable filled Wu Zhao’s mother with a seething rage, and after the banquet was over, the cantankerous grand dame insisted that her daughter settle scores that she might get back some of her own. On the pretext that she wished to avoid the appearance of nepotism, Wu Zhao had her half brothers and nephews de­ moted to provincial posts. This explains the timing of Wu Z hao’s Admonitions on Maternal Relatives. She could, in a sin­ gle swoop, banish loathed family members from the capital and present herself as a conscientious Empress bent on keeping her family from meddling in court politics. N ot acclimated to a re­ gion that most northerners found miasmal, one of her step­ brothers died not long after taking office among the mountains and swamps of the southwest. Wu Z hao’s younger sister died early on, but her relationships with her elder sister and her sister’s children proved both intri­ cate and prickly. Her elder sister’s husband, an official in the Ministry of Justice, died young, leaving her widowed with two children. When Wu Zhao entered Gaozong’s harem, this eye­ catching young widow frequently visited the Inner Palace, earn­ ing from the Emperor both an affectionate sobriquet, “ Beauty of the State,” and a title, Lady of Han. During Wu Zhao’s three successive pregnancies as Lady of Luminous Deportment, the Lady of Han became Gaozong’s favorite, Wu Zhao’s sexual body double. While this caused some sisterly tension, their combined sororal efforts prevented Gaozong from straying from Wu Zhao’s apartments during this critical juncture.\n\nThe Lady of Han passed away in the mid 660s. With grow­ ing interest, Gaozong had watched her daughter from her mar­ riage to-thefbffieial in the Ministry of Justice blossom into a lovely, nubile woman. After her mother’s death, Gaozong in­ vested this young woman as the Lady of Wei. On the pretext of visiting her aunt, the Empress, this beauty entered the Inner Palace with ever greater frequency and enjoyed Gaozong’s sex­ ual attentions. Thus, Gaozong bestowed his imperial favor upon Wu Z hao’s niece, Wu Z hao’s elder sister^ and Wu Zhao herself. The calculating Wu Zhao watched their rapture with growing alarm, knowing all too well that once Gaozong be­ came consumed with passion and lust these overheated emo­ tions would dictate his decisions. So when the middle-aged li­ oness, who had recently borne her sixth child, learned that Gaozong was considering bringing the young nymphet formally into the Inner Palace, she did not hesitate to act. In 666, after Gaozong returned from the grandest of imperial sacrifices, the feng and shan rites, at M ount Tai, Wu Zhao’s nephews, who as provincial officials had accompanied the impe­ rial progress, held a congratulatory banquet. Wu Zhao’s mother, M adame Yang, allowed her detested in-laws to use her residence to host the festivities. Mistakenly, the two nephews believed their decade serving as petty officials in the provinces had cooled the wrath of their aunt Wu Zhao and great-aunt, and that now, after hobnobbing with the Emperor and court officials on the journey to Mount Tai, their time had arrived, that they were on the verge of being recalled to court and wreathed in honors. Mother and daughter worked tandem. Wu Zhao saw this gala event as an opportunity to eliminate her younger rival. The Lady of Rong was a vindictive woman with a good memory who had long sought an occasion to destroy the grandnephews who twice had insulted her. Among the noble and beautiful in attendance was the Lady of Wei. Secretly, if we take the histories at their word, Wu Zhao added a toxic supplement to the meat filling of her dumplings, causing the young woman to die, suddenly and agonizingly. Im­ mediately, the Empress pointed an accusatory finger at the hosts, her nephews. After a summary trial they were found guilty and\n\nexecuted. Posthumously, she changed their surnames from Wu to Viper, to distance herself, to sever any kin ties, and to avoid taint­ ing her precious name with their noxious and unlucky presence. One is left to imagine a scenario in which Wu Zhao executed this sinister design, or, indeed, whether or not the Lady of Wei’s untimely death truly was her doing. Perhaps, without attracting undue notice, the Empress casually wandered, clutching the deadly vial, through the milling ruck of kitchen domestics, until she found the platter earmarked for the Lady of Wei and then, deftly peeling back a loose dumpling wrapper, slipped the poison in unobtrusively. Unlikely, because at a Chinese meal individual dishes are not served. Rather, a variety of platters are placed on the table, and people help themselves. Perhaps they were seated close together and, with affected sweetness, the Empress picked up the fatal dumpling with her own chopsticks and proffered it to the Lady of Wei as a token of her friendship and esteem, a great honor the young woman could hardly decline. This seems implausible as such a scenario would likely implicate Wu Zhao. More probably, one of Wu Zhao’s close subordinates, a serving girl or attendant, did her mistress’ bidding. N ot yet feeling entirely vindicated, the Madame Yang asked her daughter to find a pretext to arrest Mrs. Shan, the wife of her eldest grandnephew, a woman she felt had treated her with par­ ticular contempt in the past. On a fabricated charge, Mrs. Shan was beaten with a whip of thorns until she died a grisly death, with patches of rent flesh dangling from her exposed bones. Wu Zhao’s remaining stepbrother, the last of Wu Shiyue’s living sons, was quietly killed in exile. To deflect suspicion of her involvement and to install a new Wu clan heir to attend to her father’s sacrifices, she bestowed the Wu surname and the honorific hereditary title Duke of Zhou upon Helan Minzhi, the brother of the deceased Lady of Wei. Confucian historians bent on vilifying Wu Zhao have manufac­ tured a scene in which she, at the funeral of the Lady of Wei, watched suspiciously as a tearful and distraught Gaozong com­ miserated with this younger brother of his dead favorite. When the youth glanced coldly in her direction, she said to herself, “This brat suspects me.” In this version of events, this single telling glance, coupled with her jealously at the youth’s moment\n\nof shared grief with Gaozong, was more than ample fodder to spark in Wu Zhao an enmity toward the young man. And once her hatred Was-kindled, it generally was doused only after her enemy’s life was extinguished. Wu Z hao’s decision to make Helan Minzhi a Wu and Duke of Zhou after the funeral suggest this story was fabricated. Fur­ thermore, she supported the young man’s rise in court, placing him in charge of scholarly projects, collating histories and classi­ cal texts along with some of the most celebrated scholars of the day. Ungrateful, genuinely suspicious of and angry at Wu Zhao, dashing Helan Minzhi was much more interested in womaniz­ ing than in classical scholarship. The profligate seduced and ravaged the palace girls attending Wu Z hao’s daughter, the Taiping Princess. Then, ignoring the scandal, he raped a consort that Wu Zhao and Gaozong had handpicked for their firstborn, Crown Prince Li Hong. When his grandmother, the Lady of Rong, died in 670, rather than wearing appropriate mourning garments, the wayward Helan Minzhi continued to revel, hiring singing girls and entertainers. Giving him one last chance, Wu Zhao put him in charge of overseeing the construction of a Bud­ dhist statue that might offer her mother blessings in the after­ life. Flouting her orders, he appropriated the funds for further carousing and drinking. Thus he revenged his sister. Unable to further countenance such blatant disrespect to her recently deceased mother, Wu Zhao wrote a memorial outlining these crimes. Helan Minzhi was stripped of the Wu name and his noble titles and exiled to the distant southwest. Along the way, he hung himself from a tree branch with his horse’s reins. On the whole, Wu Zhao not only showed no particular favor to her Wu kinsmen, but for the most part she truly loathed them. Though some have remarked on her preternatural de­ tachment from human emotion, she was not detached in the least. Her relations with family members were not informed by abstract political ideals of the proper role for maternal relatives; they were intensely personal and emotional. Wu Zhao did, however, to the very end, remain a filial daughter, dutiful to both parents. When her mother passed away in 670, she was wracked with a deep sadness. With both\n\nher siblings and parents gone, she was stricken by keen pangs of loneliness. Her mother was posthumously elevated to Loyal and Chaste Lady of Lii. By imperial mandate, all court officials and eminent women of state were ordered to go to her residence and shed tears of mourning. Her father was also bestowed with new honorific titles. She even transported his remains from dis­ tant Bingzhou so that her parents might be reunited in death. She constructed her mother’s funerary park, Shunling, on the scale of an imperial tomb near the city of Xianyang, where it re­ mains in the shadow of the modern-day X i’an-Xianyang Inter­ national Airport. The locals treat the tomb of M adame Yang with great respect. The walls are gone, and local peasants live, weed, plant, harvest, and shepherd milking goats among the 1,300-year-old statuary. Today date orchards and fields of veg­ etables surround the stone figures of stalwart ministers and aus­ picious animals flanking the spirit path that leads to the briarcovered tumulus where she is interred. These regal tomb guardians are seen as benevolent, luckbringing protectors. The massive pair of one-horned beasts are reputed to have scared off local brigands. Lucky rams secure both the blessing of Wu Z hao’s mother in the netherworld and the good fortune of country folk in this world. By far the most lore surrounds the stone lions. One legend claims that ever since the lions were carved, no hail has stricken the region. In one re­ lated local tale, a stone lion once rescued a carter from a mur­ derous bandit. Though the petrified man never saw the lion strike, the telltale blood of the robber adorned the stone lion’s mouth like lipstick of gore. The lion gently told the carter, “ If no further bad men come along, please smear my lips with oint­ ment from time to time.” It is also said that if there is a drought in the region, all the common folk need to do is send young maidens to wash the pair o f ten-foot-tall lions under the moon and stars. A local rhyme attests to the efficacy of this cleansing in alleviating a drought: Wash the lion’s head, water down the streets shall flow. Wash the lion’s body, soaking rains make the crops grow.\n\nAnd even today, in the vicinity of Shunling, when young wives want a son or barren women want to conceive, they rub the\n\ngenitals of the male lion. Over the many centuries, myriad hands of hopeful countrywomen have worn the genitals a pol­ ished b la c k .'*'- '—_ As one of the Two Sages, Wu Zhao never shied from the po­ litical stage. In 662, when the titles of administrative bureaus and court officials were changed, she simultaneously changed the titles of the consorts within the Inner Palace. Though in the­ ory, this bureaucracy of women was not related to the bureau­ cracy of the central government, this measure created a seeming connection between the two. She altered the titles to make them sound as though they were “ bureaucratic,” akin to those of the ministers in the outer court. In the place of the old titles like Beauty, Talent, or Lady of the Precious Bevy, that clearly defined women as sexual companions for the Emperor’s pleasure, mid­ ranking concubines now bore titles such as Recipient from the Inner Chamber, Recipient of Edicts, or Guardian Immortal. These official-sounding titles suggested that women in the harem had formal duties like ministers in the outer court. Tacitly, this move helped to normalize her own increased political presence. The greatest and most public ceremonies of state performed during Gaozong’s 34 years as Emperor were the feng and shan sacrifices at M ount Tai, the easternmost of China’s five sacred mountains. These extraordinary rites were only performed in times of great peace and prosperity, when a worthy sovereign might broadcast to the empire and to neighboring lands a sense of cosmic harmony and order. These ceremonies publicly con­ firmed that Heaven had bestowed upon the ruler, or in this unique instance, rulers, the mandate to govern. Assuming a humble posture of ritual obeisance, the ruler offered sacrifices to Heaven and Earth to reciprocate the celestial blessings and terrestrial bounty they had so generously bestowed. Such styl­ ized modesty belied the grandiose and elaborate scale of the feng and shan ceremonies staged by the Two Sages. The rarest of imperial rites, the feng and shan have been per­ formed by only seven rulers in Chinese history. Often rulers were thwarted by long-winded court debates over proper cere­ monial form, adverse climatic or cosmic signs, barbarian inva­ sions, or a ruler’s fear that he was unworthy. Even during the\n\nreign o f Taizong, the rites were discussed at length, yet never performed. Xu Jingzong had long encouraged Gaozong to perform these rites, both as a means to glorify his Empress and for the Emperor to place his own indelible mark upon history. After Tang armies subjugated the Western Turks in the early 660s, Gaozong had expanded the Tang empire from the Eastern Sea all the way to Persia. The empire reached its greatest extent with the conquest o f Koguryo in 668, though Tang forces were overextended and the periphery was not solidly garrisoned. Other court ministers joined X u Jingzong in urging Gaozong to carry out the grand rites. Midway through 664 he agreed, and a date was finally fixed for the first lunar month of 666. Though Wu Zhao sorely desired to participate, traditionally the Empress had no part in the feng and shan. Previously, the Em­ peror had played the central role while high officials performed secondary and tertiary rites. However, since no one had per­ formed the rites in centuries, the ceremonial procedures were not clear. As the procession headed to Mount Tai, Wu Zhao presented a formal petition to her husband requesting that she take part in the rites. Her timing was impeccable. H ad the request come ear­ lier, the issue of her participation would have been bandied about the outer court, creating a brouhaha and delaying the ceremonies. This formal petition sheds light on the nature of the Two Sages’ polity. The fact that she memorialized Gaozong showed that, at least in ceremonial form, she still recognized him as superior. In one segment of the petition, which showcases a brilliant balance of stylized humility and ornate prose, Wu Zhao argued: “ Heaven and Earth have their fixed positions. The virtues of obdurance and pliancy are distinct. Both classics and commen­ taries contain examples of how, in performing rites and cere­ monies, these differences are well heeded. According to ancient regulations, the shan sacrifices to the earth deity and to deceased imperial ancestresses at the square jade altar should be performed by high ministers. Yet according to the Confucian rites, this mixing of men and women is improper. Fortunately, the ritual protocol is not yet fixed. In extending ceremonial honors to for­ mer empresses, how can we use ministers and officials o f the outer court? For the Empress to present secondary offerings at\n\nthe jade altar is in accordance with the square orientation of the earth god. Presenting fragrant foods to the gods and ancestors in jade bowls is inrtrnth a duty for women of the inner apartments. I hereby petition that I lead the wives of high court officials to present libations and offerings in the shan rite.” In essence, Wu Zhao argued that as the shan rite would fea­ ture a sacrificial offering to Earth and to the deceased wives of the first two Tang emperors, it was her duty as First Lady of the empire and as a dutiful daughter-in-law to honor Earth and her illustrious ancestresses-in-law. After all, symbolically, the Earth is the Emperor’s mother and Heaven his father. And in Chinese dualism, female essence and a square shape are associated with Earth, while the male essence and circle are aligned with Heaven. Following her logic, were the male ministers to present the sec­ ondary sacrifices, it would violate ritual etiquette. The female role was not only necessary in the name of Confucian propriety, but it also conformed to natural harmony, helping keep the fe­ male yin and male yang essences in balance. Thus, in the name of the ritual decorum of Confucianism, the very ideological system that denigrated her on the basis of her gender, she justified her appearance in the rites. Concluding with a modest flourish, she deftly added, “ Though the light from a firefly or a candle is not great, it still adds radiance to the sun and m oon.” Swayed, Gaozong issued an imperial edict proclaiming, “When the shan sacrifice is presented, the Empress shall offer the secondary sacrifice.” Also at the prodding of his fellow “ Sage,” Gaozong made an eleventh-hour change in the ceremo­ nial accoutrements, exchanging stalks of grain and earthenware gourds for plush cushions and ornamental spouted tripods. Hu­ mility and understatement might have reflected Gaozong’s virtue, but grandiose ornament and ceremony better served Wu Zhao’s efforts to amplify her public visibility. Thus, on the lunar New Year of 666, Gaozong performed the feng sacrifice to Heaven at a circular three-story altar several miles south of Mount Tai. The shan sacrifice to Earth took place on the third day. Gaozong provided the primary offering to the earth spirits at an octagonal yellow altar set on a square plat­ form, with eight sets of stairs leading down. The square shape and yellow color were symbols of Earth. Wu Z hao’s moment\n\nhad finally arrived. When the Emperor’s offering was complete, those in charge withdrew. Behind silken canopies carried by eu­ nuchs, she ascended the altar to present secondary offerings. As she had suggested, women of the imperial harem and wives of high-ranking ministers then performed tertiary offerings. Atop the altar, they poured libations into ritual vessels and serenaded the earth gods. At a distance, furtively laughing in their sleeves, Confucian officials ridiculed the spectacle. Nonetheless, by inte­ grating not only herself, but wives of court officials, imperial kinswomen, and the women of the Inner Palace, Wu Zhao rede­ fined these ancient rites to create a prominent role for women. The feng and shatt sacrifices concluded with the Altar of Au­ diences ceremony at which Gaozong held court from a square altar in front of the temporary palace at the foot of M ount Tai and received the congratulations of his ministers. On the round­ about return trip the entourage stopped in the hometown of the renowned sage Confucius, bestowed upon him the title Grand Preceptor, and sacrificed a lamb in his honor. Several weeks later at the birthplace of Laozi, Gaozong showed his veneration for the founder of Daoism, and reputed first ancestor of his Li clan, by granting him the title Superior August Emperor of Mysterious Origin. Both Wu Zhao and Gaozong understood that it was important not to alienate either the Confucian or the Daoist establishment. The logistics of the feng and sban rites were staggering. The imperial entourage numbered in the thousands, extending for miles and miles. The journey took four and a half months and covered more than 2,000 miles. The entire breadth of the horizon was clustered with the yurts of foreign chieftains and emissaries from “ as far east as Korea, and as far West as Persia.” Their mounts and livestock—horses and camels, and vast flocks of cat­ tle and sheep—clogged the roadways. Also accompanying the Two Sages were the women of the imperial harem, attendant palace eunuchs close in tow, the full complement of Palace Guards, provincial officials and the entire array of court officials, civil and military. A veritable army of cooks and menial servants was required to attend to basic concerns like food and lodging. At Mount Tai, countless workers scrambled to construct massive earthworks according to the prescribed ceremonial regulations.\n\nFor their part, Gaozong and Wu Zhao took great pains to make the rites inclusive. By design, the ceremonies primarily honored-the H eaven and Earth, rather than imperial ancestors. Towns the procession passed through were granted a year’s tax relief. Accompanying officials were given promotions and new titles. Local elderly men and women were granted prestige ti­ tles. Gaozong feted the empire with a week-long thanksgiving feast. The performance of the feng and shan sacrifices was a shared political triumph, exalting both Emperor and Empress. The Two Sages ascended eternal and imposing M ount Tai, straddling the divine realm and the earthly world, prostrating themselves before the gods while symbolically joining their company. The years following the feng and shan sacrifices, however, tarnished the luster o f the grand ceremonies. The two capitals in the Yellow River heartland were stricken by snowless winters and solar eclipses, crop-withering droughts and catastrophic floods, plagues of locusts and unseasonable hail, all of which hurt the livelihood of the peasant masses. People of this era be­ lieved that nature reflected Heaven’s approval or disapproval of a ruler’s governance. Natural catastrophes were Heaven’s way of censuring an immoral ruler. Seriously alarmed, Gaozong and Wu Zhao sought to regain Heaven’s favor by following longstanding Confucian prescrip­ tions to display austerity and good governance. To help bring timely rain during a parching drought in 670, the Two Sages changed the name of the reign era, shunned the primary imper­ ial palace and reduced sentences o f prisoners, in case the griev­ ances of the unjustly accused had prompted Heaven’s ire. M eat was rationed within the palaces and the use o f grain to ferment alcohol was forbidden. The rulers summoned scholars to delib­ erate upon the proper form of rites and music in securing the blessing of Heaven. Wu Zhao offered to abdicate, a stylized act of ritual humility. Perhaps it was an effort to cast herself as a latter-day Cheng Tang, a mythic ruler from distant antiquity who, during a seven-year drought, cast himself upon a burning heap of kindling as a living sacrifice. In the case of Cheng Tang, a timely rain fell on the parching lands before the worthy king\n\nwas immolated. Usually, of course, such ceremonial abasement before Heaven was reserved for the Emperor rather than the Empress. Gaozong refused her offer. The Two Sages tried further measures to restore popular goodwill and create harmony between the natural and human worlds. They ordered charity grain to be distributed from state granaries. In 673, they prohibited fishing with nets and forbade people to use hunting rings to surround and kill beasts. Still, the ill omens continued. The kite’s tail ornament, designed to ward off fire, fell from the roof of the ancestral temple. To further placate angry spirits and ancestors, all frivolous music was sus­ pended. To secure harmony between the world of men and the realm of nature, twelve elegant ritual songs were composed with titles like “ The Four Seasons” and “ The Eight Winds,” and played in all of the great temples and shrines countrywide. Wu Zhao had further cause for concern. Her stalwart sup­ porter X u Jingzong, who had been the most powerful minister at court for 13 years, retired in 670 and died in 672. In his ab­ sence, other court ministers harshly criticized X u and, with Gaozong’s approval, began to rewrite his national annals on the grounds that they were untruthful. Wu Zhao’s old enemy, Grand Uncle of State Changsun Wuji, was posthumously reha­ bilitated and buried near the tomb of his liege, Taizong.\n\nCelestial Empress and Grand Dowager Celestial Sovereigns In the autumn of 674, Gaozong and Wu Zhao announced new titles, Celestial Sovereign and Celestial Empress, honorific ap­ pellations with no precedent in Chinese history. Their titles were chosen purposefully, assumed only after the two rulers had bestowed grander titles upon the two deceased Tang emper­ ors and their respective empresses. To conceal this exercise in self-aggrandizement in a guise of Confucian modesty, Wu Zhao maintained that “ Celestial” was chosen not for self-glorification, but out of filial regard, to avoid repeating the lofty titles used to honor their ancestors. They then announced the advent of Highest Origin, a new reign era to match their newly crafted genealogy. To understand the resonance of the “ Celestial” titles, it is im­ portant to recall that the Li imperial family claimed descent from the venerable founder of Daoism, Laozi. Whereas Confu­ cianism is concerned largely with this-worldly ethical and social matters, Daoism is full of prophecies, mysticism, magic, and recipes for immortality. In Daoist circles, the Celestial Sovereign was a powerful mythic emperor. Daoist prophecies of the time contained cryptic rumblings of the second coming of this “ Ce­ lestial Sovereign.” Gaozong, as Emperor and a descendant of Laozi, was a perfect candidate. As “ Celestial Empress,” Wu\n\nZhao also symbolically joined the company of Daoist sages and immortals. Later that same year, Wu Zhao publicly promul­ gated Twelve Decrees. In one, the Celestial Empress pro­ claimed, “The divine achievement of the empire issues entirely from Laozi, the August Emperor of Mysterious Origin. I humbly petition that from the imperial princes on down all shall study the works of Laozi.” In a remarkable break from Confucian tradition, Laozi’s famous work, the Daodejing, for­ mally became a text that scholars were required to study for the civil service examinations. The Twelve Decrees Wu Zhao issued in 674 were more sym­ bolic than real, not so much true decrees as an effort to project the image of the two Celestial Sovereigns as ideal Daoist rulers who sought to succor the common people. In a perfect Daoist state, an Emperor governs not by waging war, implementing laws, issuing edicts and punishing wrongdoers, but through ef­ fortless action. Harmonizing with the dao, the pattern of nature and Heaven, the ruler does not allow worldly designs to inter­ fere with planting and harvest, thus enabling the peasants to pursue their livelihood. To encourage agriculture and silk weav­ ing, she urged a lightening of taxes and corvee labor. Claiming that the empire needed to be transformed by the dao rather than by weapons, she called for a large scale disbandment of troops. She ordered an extension of cultivable lands near the palaces, formerly forbidden ground. She prohibited extravagant Buddhist construction and wasteful public works. She sought to increase channels by which common folk and lesser officials might communicate with the throne, and forbade slander. She also honored good officials with rank and reward. Collectively, these decrees broadcast an image of simple, frugal, and virtuous government that was not consistent with the realities of the court. These reforms did not mark a genuine and substantive shift to Daoism. The court continued to operate on Confucian principles of government, and Buddhism still flourished in court and country. Despite their rhetoric of fiscal thrift, Gaozong and Wu Zhao were inclined to extravagance. In addition to grand rites of state like the feng and shan, they erected several new palaces and\n\nfrequently traveled back and forth between the two capitals. Outside the capitals, they built summer palaces in the moun­ tains. Gaozdng-often went on imperial hunts. Furthermore, with ongoing border wars on several fronts in the mid-670s—west in Tibet and northeast in the recalcitrant Korean protectorate— dramatic military de-escalation was not a real option. Wu Z hao’s most enduring and efficacious decree was the measure that ordered the length of mourning for the mother to equal that for the father. According to Confucian rites, the pre­ scribed mourning period for one’s father was three years, while the mother was only mourned for one year if the father was still alive. Very possibly in honor of her recently deceased mother, Wu Zhao decreed that the periods of bereavement for both par­ ents should be the same. She wrote, “The rites of the ancients are not set in stone. Though in one’s heart the mother and father are revered with equal esteem, according to practice the father is mourned for three years, while one wears mourning garments for their mother for but a single cycle. This is not long enough. Even birds and beasts recognize their mother. Truly beyond fathom are the depths o f nourishment and kindness that moth­ ers offer their children. A mother grows tired and careworn raising her young. I hereby petition that the mourning period for the mother henceforth be three years.” Despite opposition to what some saw as a subversion of the fundamental natural and human principle of male superiority and female sub­ servience, her regulation of equal mourning became accepted ritual practice. Gaozong’s illness worsened. Fatigued by court duties, he of­ ten summered at the Palace of Nine Perfections in the mountains west of Chang’an. Dizzy and feeble, he summoned legendary physicians, enticing them away from their rustic mountain dwellings with gifts of mansions and splendid teams of horses. Still, his condition continued to deteriorate. Increasingly, in the early 670s, routine court matters were left to Crown Prince Li Hong, now in his early twenties. Though Li Hong may have timidly clung to his parents when he was young, as he came of age he developed into an independent-minded young man with\n\na strong sense of justice. He was widely admired by the popu­ lace, Gaozong held him in high esteem, and the ministers of the court saw him as a modest, serious, and respectful youth with a deep regard for Confucian learning. Li Hong was particularly sympathetic to women. At sixteen, he petitioned the throne to spare the wives of army deserters from the Korean campaigns. In 671, the Crown Prince discov­ ered that two of his half-sisters, the daughters of Pure Consort X iao, were sequestered in a desolate corner of the Inner Palace. In court, he demanded that they be freed and allowed to marry. After his public appeal, Wu Zhao found partners for the cast­ off princesses. In the summer of 675, the Crown Prince accompanied his parents, the Celestial Sovereigns, to the Imperial Park, just north of Luoyang. On this outing, at the youthful age of twenty-three, he died suddenly in a palace on the park’s western fringe. In the Old Tang History, it is simply recorded that Li Hong died while in the Imperial Park. However, the New Tang History, written two centuries later, contends that the “ Celestial Empress murdered the Imperial Prince” and also that “The two daughters of Pure Consort X iao were secreted away in side apartments of the palace and at nearly forty were still unmar­ ried. Crown Prince Hong advocated on their behalf to the Em­ peror. Furious, the Empress poisoned the Crown Prince.” An­ other Northern Song history, the Comprehensive Mirror for the Advancement o f Governance, relates the same story involving the two spinsters, and adds, “ When the Celestial Empress acted with arrogance and presumption, the Crown Prince, on several occasions, wrote memorials opposing her. . . . people of the time believed that the Celestial Empress poisoned him.” Though the story of the vicious, power-hungry mother poi­ soning her promising, virtuous son served as a tidy Confucian parable, neither of the motives ascribed to Wu Zhao by histori­ ans rings true: her desire to usurp the throne and her anger over the Crown Prince marrying off Pure Consort X iao’s daughters. Both Wu Zhao and Gaozong had groomed Li Hong to be Heir Apparent. Time and again, they placed him in charge of court matters. Furthermore, if Wu Zhao truly harbored ambitions to\n\nusurp the throne, Li Hong was hardly her only obstacle: Gaozong was still alive and she had three other sons. Though some histories claim that*Li H ong’s concern for his half-sisters infuri­ ated Wu Zhao, causing a rift between mother and son, the inci­ dent involving the Pure Consort’s daughters occurred four years before his eventual death. Wu Zhao was clement in her own way; in her mind, the sins of the parent did not always extend to the child. Just as she would allow the granddaughter of her bitter enemy Shangguan Yi to become her personal secretary, so Wu Zhao herself petitioned Gaozong to elevate the two princesses in rank and allowed them to marry. Curiously, this request appears in the New Tang History, the very source that most strongly accuses Wu Zhao of murdering her own son. The Crown Prince had inherited his father’s frail constitu­ tion. Official eulogies including Gaozong’s personal “ Edict to bestow upon the Crown Prince the posthumous title Filial and Respectful Emperor” all contain references to his illness. Sickly and weak, the Crown Prince had long suffered from tuberculo­ sis. In one eulogy it was written, “ from the moment his tiny in­ fant hands could grasp the evil-warding scepter, the Crown Prince suffered from a heavy respiratory illness.” On the outing to the Imperial Park, at a moment when Li Hong seemed to be feeling better than usual, Gaozong confided in his fragile son that he was considering abdicating the dragon throne to him. Fraught with anxiety, Li Hong was overwhelmed by a sudden attack of his illness. As Gaozong’s edict puts it, “ his old malady became increasingly severe.” Shortly thereafter, Li Hong ex­ pired. After his death, the Crown Prince was buried with rites befitting an emperor and given the posthumous title his parents had chosen. Almost immediately, Gaozong appointed his second son Li Hsien Crown Prince. While this new Crown Prince lacked Li Hong’s charisma and sense of justice, he had shown great apti­ tude in Confucian learning as a youngster and thus had gained among the ministers a reputation as an ardent patron of classi­ cal scholarship. Rapidly, he built a coterie of skillful Confucian rhetoricians.\n\nThough Li Hsien’s scholarly ability impressed Gaozong, the young prince was untried and had not yet won his father’s full confidence. Early in 676, still grieving deeply for Li Hong, feel­ ing beleaguered and ill, Gaozong summoned his ministers to discuss the unusual possibility of retiring and abdicating to the Celestial Empress Wu Zhao. Appalled at the suggestion, one minister remonstrated, “ The Son of Heaven administers the outer and the Empress controls the inner. The Emperor is to the Empress as the sun to the moon. Each celestial body has its set place and they do not mutually contend—this is the way of Heaven. If this proper sense of place is lost, the result will be chaos. H ow can Your Majesty take the empire, the bequest of your grandfather Gaozu and your father Taizong, and pass it on to the Celestial Empress?” Another minister quickly seconded: “ My colleague has spo­ ken words of absolute loyalty. It would be wise for Your Majesty to heed them!” The point was clear. Wu Z hao’s most ardent supporters had retired from the court or died. Shortly afterward, both of these high-ranking ministers became tutors of Crown Prince Li Hsien, joining his growing faction of supporters in court. Curiously, many of his backers were scions of the great aristocratic clans whose influence Wu Zhao had so deftly pruned a generation earlier. It is certainly no quirk of fate that in 676, the very year G ao­ zong offered to abdicate to Wu Zhao, a phoenix, sovereign of all avians and an auspicious symbol of female authority, was purportedly sighted in Chenzhou, prompting the inauguration of a new reign era called Phoenix Regulator. That same year, Wu Zhao urged Gaozong to perform the feng and shan rites for a second time. Gaozong agreed, but a series of border incursions by the Tibetans in the southwest prevented the plan from being put into action. Even more telling, however, Wu Zhao went alone to the Gate of Brilliant Prosperity in 678 to hold an audi­ ence with all of the court officials and leaders of foreign states. There is no indication that Gaozong was ill on this occasion. Perhaps because of the uncertainties surrounding her— Gaozong’s failing health, her enemies in court, and the issues with succession—the year 676 marked a change in Wu Zhao’s\n\nattitude toward the imperial throne. Even though Gaozong had aborted his proposed abdication, the Celestial Sovereign’s pro­ posal left a deepimpression upon the Celestial Empress. Gaozong, who clearly had no problem with the idea of a female emperor, had seriously considered installing her in his stead, and the court had not dismissed her accession as laughable. Now a seasoned politician attuned to the pulse of court and state, it no longer seemed so farfetched or absurd that she might one day occupy the throne. Still vigorous at fifty and as sharp-minded as ever, unconvinced that her three remaining sons possessed the mettle to rule, Wu Zhao first began to seriously mull the possibility of setting herself upon the throne. Though weary Gaozong did not pursue the possibility of enthroning Wu Zhao further, the vacil­ lating ruler had effectively named not one, but two, heirs appar­ ent: his wife and his son. Naturally, this ambivalence set ironwilled Wu Zhao and ambitious Li Hsien at odds. Though some ministers boisterously opposed her accession, most of the court, either scared of her terrible vindictive nature or convinced that she could effectively govern, had remained silent. They were wise to hold their tongues. Like her mother, Wu Zhao bore longstanding grudges against all who had slighted, attacked, or betrayed her. A decade later, though the official who had first spoken against her had passed away, she targeted the man’s grandson, having the young man executed on a fabri­ cated charge. As the youth was led to his death, he spewed an unending stream of heaven-rattling curses at Wu Zhao. To avoid further untimely outbursts, she initiated a new practice: gagging prisoners en route to execution. Furious at the grandson’s cheek, she ordered his body dismembered. She then commanded that the offending family’s tombs be exhumed, their coffins smashed, and their bodies burned to ashes. Wu Zhao knew that the very idea o f a woman ruler was anathema to most court ministers. But Confucian values, a rich and inexhaustible source of normative authority, pervaded soci­ ety, culture, and politics. These values, she had learned during her two decades of political involvement, were not immutable, cast in stone. They were framed in language and interpreted by men. Media, men, and language could all be reshaped. A consummate\n\npolitician, Wu Zhao possessed the skill to make this cumber­ some liability, a system that rejected her on the basis of gender, into an asset. In modern parlance, one might call this ability “ spin,” and when it came to this sort of political spinning, in the imperial court, the most intricate of webs, she proved a most adept spider indeed. Thus, during Gaozong’s protracted illness, she cast herself as a good Confucian wife, becoming in­ volved in the outer court solely to protect the property and es­ tate of her husband’s family. As when she maneuvered her way into the feng and shan rites, she presented her motivation in terms of her ardent desire to follow proper ritual protocol, rather than as an effort to exalt her person. Though Wu Zhao was well versed in Confucian rites and eti­ quette, she could not manage this manipulation all alone. As her support in court dwindled, she gathered together a private band of brilliant literary and poetic minds, talented scholars of low rank, who, because they were allowed to enter the Inner Palace through the northern Xuanwu Gate to consult with her, became known as the Scholars of the North Gate. These men served as her unofficial advisers, compiling tomes of Confucian scholar­ ship geared toward consolidating Wu Z hao’s political authority. The Celestial Empress’ consultation with the Scholars of the North Gate on contemporary political matters deeply vexed court ministers. Because the Scholars “ participated in and ren­ dered decisions on matters of court,” their presence divided and undermined the authority of high officials. These outsiders helped establish Wu Zhao as a patron o f Confucian learning at the same time that they enabled her, and Gaozong at times, to make decisions of state, while circumventing normal channels of administration. This extra-bureaucratic group compiled and edited treatises on ideal Confucian behavior, like Biographies o f Exemplary Women, and commentaries on the classics of antiquity, such as Essentials on the Book o f Music. They wrote manuals of statecraft like New Admonitions for the Hundred Officials, Statutes for Maintain­ ing Urban Control, and New Prohibitions from Phoenix Hall. They also authored massive compilations like the Compendium o f Literature and the Ocean o f Characters, a famous dictionary. Rather than merely collating classical knowledge, this group\n\nconsciously mustered and retooled past legal and administrative texts to support Wu Z hao’s sovereignty. The great volume of high-caliber Confucian scholarship that resulted from their am­ bitious efforts marked Wu Zhao as an enthusiastic patron of Confucianism, rather than an opponent. Unfortunately, almost all of these works have disappeared. In the late 670s, with Li Hong dead and Gaozong’s illness becoming ever more severe, the tensions over the question of succession grew with each passing day. Wu Zhao made one fi­ nal effort at rapprochement with Li Hsien, having her Scholars of the North Gate compile Orthodox Patterns for Princelings and Biographies o f Filial Sons, presumably to guide and shape his behavior. However, Crown Prince Li Hsien paid little heed: Rather than defining his role as obedient princeling and filial son, his own band of scholars produced works that cast him as one ready to assume the mantle of a Confucian monarch. N ow in his early twenties, Li Hsien had no intention of dwelling in his mother’s shadow. In the terms he and his minions sought to reestablish, women did not cast the shadows: They were the shad­ ows, dwelling in the yin umbrage of the male’s substantive yang. The most poignant root of this mother-son power struggle was not political, but deeply emotional and personal: Li Hsien was not Wu Zhao’s son. H e was really the son of her elder sister, the Lady of Han, who, as a young widow in the early 650s, had frequented Wu Z h ao s apartments and enjoyed Gaozong’s sex­ ual attentions. In her ruthless three-way intramural struggle for favor and status with Pure Consort X iao and Empress Wang, Wu Zhao passed off her elder sister’s child as her own; a second son could only help strengthen her position. According to offi­ cial records, in the final month of 654, a mere eight months af­ ter she bore the daughter she allegedly smothered, Wu Zhao birthed Li Hsien prematurely, along the road to Taizong’s tomb, where Gaozong was to honor his deceased father. In the seventh century, premature children born while traveling in the dead of winter had little chance of survival. The palace servants knew better; during the imperial progress, the Lady of Han had secretly given birth to this boy child in Wu Z hao’s apartments. When Li Hsien was scarcely a month old, before a full-fledged scandal\n\ncould develop, to make it appear as though the new princeling was Wu Zhao’s legitimate son, Gaozong gave him a princely ti­ tle. Nonetheless, rumors persisted. When Li Hsien was appointed Crown Prince in 676, these long dormant rumors that he was a bastard born o f Wu Zhao’s elder sister resurfaced and spread rampantly through court and country. As long as such talk was not openly circulated, Wu Zhao and Li Hsien could, in form and etiquette, act as mother and son. However, the untimely revival of these ugly rumors both humiliated the Celestial Sovereigns and injured the pres­ tige of the newly-appointed Crown Prince. Li Hsien’s scornful reception of her Biographies o f Filial Sons seemingly validated these rumors. His casual dismissal of her scholarly instruction was tantamount to saying, “ I’m no son of yours. I owe you no filial reverence.” Wu Zhao, in turn, sought an opportunity to destroy Li Hsien. In 679, she found her chance. Both Wu Zhao and G ao­ zong held Ming Chongyan, a renowned mystic, in high esteem. On one occasion, Gaozong hid two courtesans in an under­ ground cellar and ordered them to play music. When Ming Chongyan entered, Gaozong said, “ I often hear such mysterious strains of music issuing from this ground. Can you tell me if it is auspicious?” Ming Chongyan replied that it was indeed auspi­ cious and pinned two peach charms on the ground above the hidden chamber. Suddenly there was silence. Gaozong laughed and summoned forth the courtesans. The girls said that they had seen two open-mouthed dragon’s heads appear above them and had been too terrified to continue. Gaozong was delighted, aware that Ming Chongyan had grasped his ruse all along. Later, he and Wu Zhao questioned Ming Chongyan about their chil­ dren. The magician remarked that both of their younger sons were favored with noble and kingly features, but that the visage of the Crown Prince revealed that he was unfit for the throne. When Li Hsien heard this, he was wracked with anxiety. Shortly afterward, under mysterious circumstances, Ming Chongyan was murdered along the road. While overseeing the court, the Crown Prince was unable to crack the case or even to find any leads. Wu Zhao suspected that he was behind the murder.\n\nMeanwhile, the Crown Prince, fond of music and women, had an affair with one of his mother’s household domestics, lav­ ishing silk and gpld-upon the woman. Though a court minister brought the relationship to Gaozong’s attention, the Celestial Sovereign dismissed it as a piffling matter. The Celestial Em­ press, however, was very interested in this matter and ordered several officials to undertake a thorough investigation. In the course of their search, they turned up several hundred sets of black armor hidden in the stables of the Crown Prince’s palace, evidence that most of those in court saw as a sure sign that he was plotting to usurp the throne. To further incriminate Li Hsien, his mistress confessed that the Crown Prince had been involved in the murder of M ing Chongyan. Gaozong, who had always been fond of Li Hsien, badly wanted to pardon him. However, Wu Zhao, confident that she had the backing of the court, now took the moral high ground afforded by wielding hardline Confucian principle, saying, “Heaven and Earth will not tolerate a son who harbors rebellious designs, so how can the intent of the Crown Prince to eradicate his own flesh and blood be forgiven so lightly?” To display evidence of Li Hsien’s treachery to the common people, the armor was burned pub­ licly south of Heaven’s Ford Bridge, in the heart of Luoyang. The Crown Prince was demoted to commoner status and taken to Chang’an, where, along with his three sons, he was secreted in an out-of-the-way palace. Those considered his accomplices and associates were rounded up and summarily killed, Li Hsien was removed to a prefecture in northern Sichuan. His sons lived in confinement for almost two decades, where, at the behest of their step-grandmother, they were subjected to a regimen of beatings and torture. Only one of these grandsons outlived Wu Zhao. To his death, he bore the scars of his terrible sequestration. He could always predict the coming of rain, prompting a stunned young cousin to remark, “ You must have magic powers!” He sadly explained, “I have no powers. It’s just that when I was hidden along with my father in a secret palace, every year I would receive several beatings, so that I was badly scarred. When it’s about to rain, there is a dull ache in my spine.”\n\nWith the death of Crown Prince Li Hong in 675 and the deposal of Crown Prince Li Hsien in 680, a somber mood descended upon the court. When Li Xian, next in line as heir apparent, was appointed Crown Prince, ministers and scholars did not rally around him as they had around Li Hsien. In times of flux, ministers often wait to see which way the political winds blow before casting their lot. By the time Li Xian was appointed Crown Prince, the Emperor’s health had deteriorated to the point where he often could not hold court. Li Xian, as he was being groomed to become the next Emperor, sometimes supervised the court in his father’s absence. During Gaozong’s final years the Celestial Sovereigns fre­ quently visited the hot springs near M ount Song and stayed at Fengtian Palace, their newly constructed mountainside summer escape. When the erection of this summer palace was proposed, for the first time in more than a decade a voice of remonstrance was heard in court. Li Shan’gan objected, admonishing Gaozong that the erection of this extravagant summer palace was most untimely: “ Over the past several years, vegetables and millet have almost completely failed to ripen, causing people everywhere to perish of starvation. The Four Barbarians are encroaching upon the borders, keeping soldiers and chariots in constant action. Your Majesty should humbly and silently consider a way to make these disasters abate, rather than rashly expanding construction of palaces and halls, giving weary laborers no rest. There are none in the empire who do not despair!” Though the Celestial Sovereigns ignored his advice, they were troubled. In 682 and 683, with Gaozong dying, a fresh outbreak of natural disasters led many to believe that the co­ rulers had forfeited the M andate of Heaven. The surging Luo River wrecked Heaven’s Ford Bridge and inundated four city blocks. In Shandong to the east, great floods caused massive damage and death, leaving starving throngs of itinerant wretches in their wake. After the spring planting, ten million rabbits materialized out of the mist to devour the newly-planted shoots, then receded into thin air. The floods were followed by months of parching drought. An earthquake caused villages to crumble. A pestilence killed tens of thousands of head of cattle.\n\nTeeming caterpillars and swarms of locusts descended to de­ vour any crops that still remained. Roving bands of brigands looted and killed JBeople resorted to cannibalism. In the streets of the two capitals, the dead pillowed atop one another. By edict, Gaozong ordered able court officials to help bury the dead. In the southwest, availing themselves of the chaos, the Tibetans re­ peatedly raided the borders. The sun was blood red. Night after night, an ill-omened comet, a sign of imminent disaster, was seen traversing the sky. The Mandate of Heaven was an important political concept in dynastic China. When a ruler was virtuous and concerned with the well-being of the common people, Heaven rewarded the ruling family with good harvests and a harmonious empire. If, however, a ruler was self-indulgent and extravagant, con­ scripting common folk to build lavish palaces without heeding the natural cycles of planting and harvest, Heaven would pun­ ish him by revoking the mandate. Natural disasters were Heaven’s punitive vehicle, a means to convey its anger with the ruling dynasty. Wu Zhao and Gaozong were both highly sensi­ tive to this political principle. As they had in the early 670s, the Celestial Sovereigns took measures to regain Heaven’s sanction, such as shunning the main palace and revising the sentences of prisoners. Amid these grim catastrophes, the Celestial Sovereigns des­ perately sought to bolster waning public morale and broadcast good tidings. State granaries were opened, and grain was sold at low prices or charitably distributed to the starving masses. They recalled military support staff from the borderlands, allowing them to return to their families. This effort at compassion went horribly awry, however, as many of those summoned home died of hunger along the route, collapsing on the roadside. In any event, Fengtian Palace was built, and in the summer of 682 they headed for the mountains. Hoping to find some rem­ edy for the Emperor’s ever-worsening illness, a cure for his mor­ tality, they consulted with Daoist ascetics like Pan Shizheng, a master of self-cultivation, breath control, and longevity. G ao­ zong once asked Pan Shizheng what the mountain had that he needed. The Daoist responded, “The mountain has clear springs\n\nand pine trees—what, then, does it lack?” Gaozong sighed ad­ miringly, mulling the stark contrast between simple mountain life and the ceaseless vexation of his imperial office. On these sojourns, Wu Zhao sought opportunities to perform ceremonies that might at once secure the good will of Heaven and further exalt her image as Celestial Empress. On the slopes of M ount Song, she erected stone plaques to honor two Daoist goddesses, the Mysterious Jade Woman and the Queen Mother of the West, a powerful divinity known to dwell among fellow immortals in a lofty mountain citadel. As the Mysterious Jade Woman was the mother of the Tang’s dynastic ancestor Laozi, paying homage to her was a means of revering her in-laws’ an­ cestors. She also honored the mother of Qi, the wife of Yu the Great, the famous flood-queller and founder of the mythic X ia dynasty in the third millennium B.C. According to legend, pur­ sued by her unruly husband, this woman had turned into a stone that split open to birth Qi. On one of the slopes of Mount Song, one can still find the Stone o f Q i’s mother. By honoring these female divinities, Wu Zhao affiliated herself with them. Mount Song began to emerge as an important ritual center, anticipating its pivotal role in Wu Zhao’s authority. Despite the ritual measures they took to placate a disapprov­ ing Heaven, it cannot be said that the Celestial Sovereigns were particularly sensitive to the suffering of the populace. In addition to Fengtian Palace, Gaozong and Wu Zhao had two other leisure palaces constructed for their frequent retreats. During these years of extreme scarcity, Wu Zhao once more urged Gaozong to perform the feng and shan sacrifices, an absurd suggestion given the grim state of affairs. The constant Tibetan incursions and spate of natural disasters made it clear that this was not an era of greater peace, a fact that court ministers vigorously pointed out. Consequently, the plans were shelved. However, not all of the Sovereigns’ extravagances were built at the expense of the taxpayers. In order to have a famed archi­ tect build a Hall of M irrors, they raised 200,000 strings of cash by selling manure from the well-fed chargers of the imperial sta­ bles. Concerned that in the eyes of posterity this ignoble venture might befoul the name of the dynastic house, Gaozong remarked\n\nto a senior minister, “ The profit is great indeed. But I fear that future dynasties will say that the men of the House of Tang were sellers of horse .dung. This is not a lofty reputation.” Manure sales were suspended, but the Hall of Mirrors was built. After Gaozong led the senior minister on a tour of the completed hall, the minister commented disapprovingly, “According to proper ceremony, just as there are not two suns in Heaven, there cannot be two rulers on Earth. Ju st now, I saw myriad images of the Son of Heaven on each of the four walls! This is highly inauspicious!” Swayed by his argument, Gaozong ordered the hall razed. The Celestial Sovereigns doted on their youngest children, Li Dan and the Taiping Princess, who remained largely sheltered from the political turmoil. Wu Zhao showed special favor to­ ward her daughter. As an eight-year-old in 672, the Taiping Princess was ordained a Daoist nun. Five years later, to avoid marrying a Tibetan chieftain, she was nominally made abbess of a Daoist temple. In 681, the marriage of the seventeen-yearold Taiping Princess into the aristocratic Xue family prompted a gala celebration, with festive torches lighting the broad av­ enues of Luoyang. However, when Wu Zhao discovered that the brothers of her new son-in-law had consorts from lowly backgrounds, she exclaimed with outrage, “ H ow can my daughter possibly keep the company of these country bumpkins for sisters-in law! ” Such haughty sentiment reveals that, nearing sixty, she now styled herself a full-fledged member of the aris­ tocracy that had once spurned her. Her snobbery goes a long way toward debunking the romantic image, a myth perpetuated by some modern Communist historians, of Wu Zhao as a champion of the impoverished commoner. In 683, when the Taiping Princess had her first son, Wu Zhao ordered a local amnesty in Luoyang. Whereas annual in­ come for princes did not exceed tax and grain revenues of one thousand households and the income for princesses was set at 350 households, the Taiping Princess was later granted a huge allowance of 3,000 households. In 682, when Crown Prince Li X ian’s new son turned one month old, the infant was named Imperial Grand Heir. The proud\n\ngrandparents announced a new reign era, declared a general amnesty, and threw the empire a three-day thanksgiving feast. Confucian histories and have tried to show that Wu Zhao plotted Gaozong’s demise or tried to keep him incapacitated. These histories contain the story of a pair of celebrated doctors who proposed the use of needles to drain Gaozong’s blood in order to relieve his extreme swelling and hypertension. The story implies that Wu Zhao, fearing her husband really might be cured, rounded on the physicians and threatened them with death for suggesting that Gaozong’s imperial countenance be marred in such a manner. Ailing Gaozong nonetheless begged to be bled, and once it was done his condition improved. There­ upon Wu Zhao did a theatrical about-face and exclaimed, “ Heaven has bestowed these masters of medicine upon m e!” The accounts describe this sudden reversal of attitudes to make manifest her cunning hypocrisy. There were also popular rumblings that Wu Zhao was behind her husband’s illness. A story circulated concerning a pharma­ cologist invited to cure Gaozong. He was digging a hole to set up a medicine stove to prepare ingredients, when suddenly a golden toad with the vermilion “Wu” of Wu Zhao’s surname on its back, a creature of the moon and the female yin essence, jumped out of the ground. The creature was placed in the pond in the Imperial Park. Later, a palace servant found a similar toad, something Gaozong found both unsettling and highly in­ auspicious. That night, the servant was violently murdered. The story of the toad’s reported interference with preparations for Gaozong’s cure indicates a popular sense that Wu Zhao treach­ erously sought to sabotage efforts to treat her husband. As ver­ milion was reserved for imperial edicts, the color of the Wu character supposedly revealed her ambition to usurp the throne. There is, however, no reason to see these stories as anything other than standard Confucian defamation and colorful popu­ lar rumor, respectively. There is no tangible evidence that Wu Zhao sought to injure or incapacitate Gaozong. N or did she have motive. To a great extent, her position was dependent upon his. In his absence, her fate was uncertain.\n\nGrand Dowager: Taking Over Court and Issuing^Edicts On a chill day in Luoyang during the final month of 683, Gaozong finally succumbed to his illness. Though his imperial will instructed that Crown Prince Li Xian be named Emperor before the coffin immediately after his death, there was an awk­ ward interval of five days before the young man’s formal coro­ nation. This was, in part, Wu Zhao’s doing. The provision of her husband’s will that most interested her read: “ Great matters of state that can not be decided, both civil and military, shall be determined by the Celestial Empress.” During the interval, a chief minister named Pei Yan memorialized that as a new Emperor had not been formally installed, the Celestial Empress needed to oversee the court and attend to matters of state. For a quarter century, Wu Zhao had been involved in deci­ sions o f state. N ow as Grand Dowager, as the widowed Empress was known, she was at sixty an energetic and vital force with no intention of quietly retiring from the political stage. F a m i l i a r with her presence, many officials operated on the premise that as Gaozong’s wife she was no longer a member of the Wu family, but the matriarch of the imperial Li clan. They expected her, as a dutiful wife, to look after the family estate, the empire, and upkeep the ancestral temples of the imperial family. N ot only had she gained a taste for administration, she genuinely styled herself as the protectress and First Lady of the Tang empire. Thus, from the very moment of Gaozong’s death, Wu Zhao sought to justify and maintain her political involvement. She had shared political authority with her husband and now contrived to do the same with her son. Her son, Li Xian, was not as tractable as she had hoped. Im­ mediately after his coronation, he installed his primary consort, a woman of the prestigious Wei family, as Empress Wei. Empress Wei was an ambitious woman who held sway over Li Xian. Within mere days, Li X ian appointed his father-in-law chief minister and elevated his brothers-in-law to important posts. When Pei Yan steadfastly opposed, Li Xian declared furiously, “If I wish to give the empire to Wei Xuanzhen, what is there to\n\nstop me? How much easier then to grant him the position of chief minister?” Pei Yan rushed to inform the Grand Dowager. Wu Zhao gathered the court officials, who on this occasion were in unanimous accord with her, to help force her wayward son off the throne. Pei Yan and several generals led a group of imperial bodyguards, and Li Xian, after a brief and ignominious two-month stint as Emperor, was promptly deposed and demoted to Prince of Luling. As he was led off, Li Xian petulantly asked his mother what his crime was. She responded, “ You wished to hand the empire to Wei Xuanzhen. H ow is that not a crime?” He was dragged off and secreted in another part of the palace. After three decades as Empress, seeing her weak-willed son treating the imperial office in such a cavalier fashion, she did not hesitate to use her influence to rally the court and remove her own child from the throne. In fact, Li Xian never really intended to turn the throne over to the Wei family; he merely intended to convey the message to a meddling court minister that his imperial prerogative was not to be questioned. More significantly, in the eyes of Wu Zhao and the court, his preoccupation with winning his wife’s favor showed that his priorities were sadly askew, that the frivolous young Emperor was entirely out of touch with the grim realities of the time. Li Xian had inherited an empire in crisis. During Gaozong’s final years, the catastrophic spate of floods, wither­ ing droughts, pestilential epidemics, and plagues o f locusts, in tandem with a renewed series of border raids by Turks and Ti­ betans, had left the Tang dynasty in a precarious state. A strong, experienced hand was needed to rein in the chaos. In Wu Z hao’s mind, only one person was capable and qualified for the job— she herself. More than anything else, the ardent back­ ing she received from the court loudly attested to Li X ian’s gross incompetence. In essence, her son’s careless remark pro­ vided the Grand Dowager with the necessary pretext to remove him from power. Li Xian had not been groomed from birth to rule the empire but had been suddenly thrust into the spotlight after the death of his brother Li Hong and the exile of his half-brother Li Hsien. During two years of intense preparation under the guid­ ance of the most sagacious ministers in court, he showed little\n\nindication that he possessed the outstanding ability and wit needed to rule. Twenty-one years after he was deposed in 684, he once again was-set on the throne. During his second tenure as Emperor, as in his first, he proved a weak and inept ruler. While his father and mother shared power and worked for a common purpose, he slavishly fawned upon, indulged, and feared his wife. In return, she cuckolded and humiliated him. On one occasion early in this second stint as Emperor, he in­ vited Wu Zhao’s rakish nephew, Wu Sansi, into the Inner Palace and tallied the score as Empress Wei and the man played backgammon, their feet entwined beneath the table. When this affair between Empress Wei and Wu Sansi grew into a widely known scandal, he ignored the growing din of lewd rumors, punishing those who dared broach the subject. Other episodes from this later tenure likewise illustrate his flippant approach to governance. To amuse his wife, he invited officials into the In­ ner Palace and staged tug-of-war contests between the ministers and imperial concubines. He set up a simulated marketplace, ordering his concubines to play vendors and visiting nobles to play traveling merchants. At one wine-saturated feast he singled out an unmarried and unwitting official and staged a farcical wedding, where, to the great amusement of the company, the new bride who emerged from behind a bamboo screen was Em­ press Wei’s former wet nurse, an aged southern barbarian slave woman. In short, Li Xian was an empire-wide laughingstock who possessed neither self-respect nor respect for the imperial office that he held. Wu Zhao moved quickly in an effort to silence potential ri­ vals. In the spring of 684, immediately after Li Xian was de­ posed, she named her youngest son Li Dan Emperor. Li Xian was banished from the capital and kept under close watch. His father-in-law Wei Xuanzhen was demoted to a faraway provin­ cial post. The senior princes, remaining sons of Gaozu, the first Tang ruler, were given lofty titles and rich sinecures, but no real authority. Gaozong’s sons by other women were moved to dif­ ferent prefectures several times, lest they develop cliques touting them as the rightful heirs to the House of Tang. Mere days after Li Dan’s ascent, she dispatched a general to keep exiled former\n\nCrown Prince Li Hsien under surveillance. In short order, the zealous official drove the harried Li Hsien to commit suicide. Without express authorization from Wu Zhao, the military offi­ cer would never have dared be so brazen. Though she blamed the death on the general and exiled him to the provinces, the man was later recalled and restored to his former rank. From this juncture on, there was no longer any pretense about the seasoned Grand Dowager sharing power with an inex­ perienced and politically naive son.
