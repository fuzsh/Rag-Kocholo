This unit traces the debates about reform from the mid-nineteenth into the early twentieth century, as arguments for more radical reform, including revolution, increased. Includes background readings, two primary-source readings (Feng Guifen's \"On the Adoption of Western Learning\" [PDF] and Yan Fu's \"Learning from the West\" [PDF]) and brief discussions of Liang Qichao's ideas on democracy and Sun Yatsen's \"Three People's Principles.\" Also see the Religion, Philosophy, Thought section, above, for more readings by these and other reformist thinkers.\n\nChu Chengbo's 1895 memorial to Qing emperor Guanxu (1871-1908, r. 1875-1908)\n\n Excerpts from Reforming Men's Minds Comes Before Reforming Institutions [PDF]\n\nKang Youwei's 1898 memorial to Qing emperor Guanxu (1871-1908, r. 1875-1908)\n\n Excerpts from Comprehensive Consideration of the Whole Situation [PDF]\n\nReform Imperial Edict of 1901 (Issued by the Empress Dowager Cixi, 1835-1908)\n\n Reform Edict of the Qing Imperial Government (January 29, 1901) [PDF]\n\nInternational Relations: China and Europe (Macartney Embassy, Opium War)\n\n Macartney and the Emperor\n\nThe Qing dynasty's restrictions on foreign trade increasingly frustrated Europeans, especially the British.

This unit includes an introductory note to teachers with suggestions for teaching about Macartney's mission; a student reading discussing European contact and trade with China prior to and on the eve of Macartney's mission to China; and the primary-source reading Two Edicts from the Qianlong Emperor, which were the Qianlong emperor's responses to the Macartney mission.
