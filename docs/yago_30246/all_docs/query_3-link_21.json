        "text": "In ancient Chinese history, a man could have a wife and many concubines as long as he could afford it.\n\nTherefore, Polygamy was quite common in noble and wealthy families.\n\nMost women followed the system in a patriarchal society, except for Queen Dugu Jialuo, who strongly opposed the Polygamy system her entire life.\n\nDugu Jialuo or Qieluo (544 — 602), respected as Queen Dugu or Empress Wenxian, was very intelligent and influential.\n\nShe had been quite helpful in assisting her husband, Yang Jian, in establishing the Sui Dynasty and was the love of his life.\n\nFurthermore, renowned as a devoted monogamist and challenger of polygamy, Queen Dugu Jialuo was also known for her bouts of jealousy.\n\nHer father found his old friend’s son was quite brave and intelligent, so he chose this decent young man named Yang Jian as his beloved little daughter Dugu Jialuo’s husband.\n\nHowever, her father was forced to commit suicide after he failed in a big political struggle.\n\nAfter this, her clan was largely declined and surpassed by their political enemy.\n\nFortunately, Yang Jian's father, the old friend of Dugu's late father, was an exceptional general who kept winning on the battlefield; Yang Jian's brothers also married other noble girls from powerful clans.\n\nTheir power and protection helped Yang Jian and Dugu survive through difficult times.\n\nYears later, Yang Jian and Dugu's first daughter's husband ascended to the throne, after which Yang Jian obtained more power through his talent and ambition.\n\nThis made the new king feel threatened and unhappy, so he commanded his queen Lihua, the daughter of Yang and Dugu, to commit suicide.\n\nThen Dugu Jialuo came to the king by herself. After a long conversation, she changed the king's mind and saved her daughter Lihua's life.\n\nLihua then had a lovely daughter and granddaughter, whom she cherished deeply. In 1957, the mausoleum of Queen Dugu's great-granddaughter was discovered, yielding a trove of extremely valuable artifacts.\n\n​\n\nUnearthed Artifacts of Queen Dugu's Great Granddaughter — National Museum of China\n\n(Photo by Dongmaiying)\n\nSeizing Opportunity and the Establishment of the Sui Dynasty\n\nSoon, this king, Dugu and Yang Jian’s son-in-law died suddenly and left the country to a 6-year-old new king.\n\nThen Yang Jian gained support from some powerful officials and was respected as the regent.\n\nBut at the same time, many powerful clans still refused to follow his command and tried their best to attack him.\n\nEncouraged by Dugu, Yang Jian snatched the throne, claimed himself as the new king, and named his new empire Sui.\n\nAfter he was enthroned as the Emperor Wen of Sui, Dugu became Queen Dugu.\n\nGreat Love Shared by Queen Dugu and Emperor Wen of Sui\n\nAfterward, Dugu assisted and encouraged her husband to expand the Sui Empire and unify the nation.\n\nEmperor Yang Jian published many innovative policies, and Dugu played an important role in constituting them.\n\nDugu was considered the real soul mate of Yang Jian.\n\nUnless her husband was required for work, they always spent their time together. She would see him off to work, welcome him back home, and assist him with complex political problems, among other things.\n\nTheir closeness and love were noted in historical documentation.\n\nLike ordinary civilian couples, they also lived a frugal life. Dugu barely asked for fancy clothes or jewelry, and neither did her husband.\n\nQueen Dugu: The Fierce Opponent of Polygamy\n\nYang Jian had promised Dugu to only have children with her. As expected, they did follow this vow and raised five boys and five girls together.\n\nHer husband trusted her entirely because she was always decent and politically appropriate.\n\nWhen her brothers committed crimes, she refused to indulge her clan and pardon them; instead, she asked her husband to execute them juristically.\n\nShe also saved many innocent people from her husband’s outrageous and suspicious decisions in his later years.\n\n​\n\nQueen Dugu barely abused her power nor crossed the line.\n\nHowever, she had severe problems with those people with many women.\n\nSome contributive generals and officials were demoted or abolished by Queen Dugu because they kept too many concubines.\n\nDugu also disliked her first son, the crown prince, when she saw he didn’t love his wife but was obsessed with his beautiful concubines.\n\nAn Unfaithful Affair of the Emperor\n\nWhen they were older, Yang Jian saw a beautiful young woman in the royal palace who was also the granddaughter of one of his biggest enemies. Then he slept with this gorgeous descendant of his former rival.\n\nQueen Dugu was quite furious and then killed this girl out of jealousy.\n\nIn ancient Chinese culture, men could have as many concubines as they could afford, and the emperors were encouraged to have even more.\n\nHence, her jealous behavior has been criticized frequently.\n\nHer husband was upset initially and ran out of the royal palace. But soon, he returned and forgave Dugu for having taken away the innocent girl’s life.\n\nThe Departure of Queen Dugu and Her Grand Memorial Ceremonies\n\nA few years after this affair, Queen Dugu departed; her posthumous title was honored as Empress Wenxian, meaning intelligent and virtuous.\n\nThe most powerful and brilliant prime minister of the Sui Dynasty, who led Sui's army to unite the nation, was sent to manage Dugu's funeral and construct her tomb.\n\nEmperor Yang Jian, who had been quite frugal and barely wore fancy clothes in his entire life, this time, held a series of grand memorial activities and built a vast and luxurious memorial palace for her (over 600,000 square meters).\n\nAbout one year after Dugu's death, her husband also passed away and was buried with her.\n\nBesides the influential Sui Dynasty they built together, and a series of political achievements, this splendid couple's beautiful and sincere love stories have been eulogized for over a thousand years."
