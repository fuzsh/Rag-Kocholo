        "text": "Dec 26, 2011 © Ulrich Theobald\n\nEmperor Han Xuandi æ¼¢å®£å¸ (r. 74-49 BCE), personal name Liu Bingji åç å·², later changed to Liu Xun åè©¢, courtesy name Ciqing æ¬¡å¿ or Mou è¬, was a ruler of the Former Han dynasty åæ¼¢ (206 BCE-8 CE). He was a great-grandson of Emperor Wu and a grandson of Liu Ju åæ, Crown Prince Li æ¾å¤ªå­. Emperor Zhao's æ¼¢æ­å¸ (r. 87-74 BCE) direct successor was Prince Liu He åè³, who was demoted for his improper behaviour after only one months of rule. Instead, Liu Bingji was chosen as the new emperor, in spite of his humble way of life.\n\nHis parents had been discarded from the imperial house in the context of a sorcery affair at the court of Emperor Wu, but Liu Bingji was saved by censor Bing Ji ä¸å and grew up like a commoner and knew the life of the common people. At that time he also became accustomed with both the laissez-faire concept of the Huang-Lao school é»è and that of a harsh penal law of the legalists. With the age of 18 sui, he was first given the title of Marquis of Yangwu é½æ­¦ä¾¯ and was then made emperor.\n\nHe was suggested to marry the daughter of the powerful minister and regent Huo Guang éå , but he preferred to make a girl of humble origin his consort, Empress Xu è¨±çå. Yet the wife of Huo Guang soon poisoned Empress Xu, so that Huo's daughter would become empress.\n\nIn 68 BCE Huo Guang died, which enabled Emperor Xuan to personally take over regency. He made Liu Shi åå¥­, his son with late empress Xu, heir apparent.\n\nIn 66 BCE the members of the Huo family planned to overthrow Emperor Xuan, but the attempt failed, and a lot of persons of the Huo were executed, including Huo's wife. Empress Huo committed suicide and was replaced by a new consort, Lady Wang çæ°. Emperor Xuan's own fate during his childhood was only reveiled to him in 63 BCE, and he highly rewarded the people that once had helped him and his family to escape execution. Bing Ji, now Censor-in-chief (yushi dafu å¾¡å²å¤§å¤«), was made Marquis of Boyang åé½ä¾¯.\n\nEmperor Xuan convoked a Confucian conference in the Shiqu Hall ç³æ¸ é£ where the differences between the old-text and new-text classics were to be discussed. The emperor personally supervised the conference because he was inspired by the Confucian concept of a benevolent government. He relaxed corporal punishment and lowered taxes, and so helped increasing the economical output in the empire.\n\nIn the Western Territories è¥¿å, he established a protectorate (duhufu é½è­·åº) that secured this region against the steppe federation of the Xiongnu åå¥´. Their khan (chanyu å®äº) Huhanya å¼ééª declared his submission and sent tributes to the Han court.\n\nEmperor Xuan was buried in the tomb mound Duling æéµ. He was succeeded by his son Liu Shi, known as Emperor Yuan æ¼¢å å¸ (r. 49-33 BCE).\n\nSource:"
