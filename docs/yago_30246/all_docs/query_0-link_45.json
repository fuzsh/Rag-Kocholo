        "text": "In June 11 date, Hetao battlefield. 六月十一日,河套战场。 Achievement of Beast Tide attack, stems from the expectations of all people, when detailed Information when Xiao Chaogui will investigate, reported to Command Unit, callously like Bai Qi, dull at the scene. 兽潮袭击的成果,出乎所有人的预料,当萧朝贵将侦查到的详细情报,上报给指挥部时,冷酷如白起,也不禁呆愣当场。 „Was this too also skillful?!” Bai Qi some cannot believe that „skillful that Beast Tide comes, the good refusing stubbornly deathtrap just causes to be in commotion, really hears something never heard of before.” “这也太巧了吧？！”白起都有些不敢相信,“兽潮来的巧,还好死不死地刚好引起炸营,真是闻所未闻。” Ouyang Shuo said with a smile: „This is the day perishes Peacock King Dynasty, General, the day with does not take, instead by its fault.” Ouyang Shuo has not thought that common talisman, establishes this grade of distinguished merit unexpectedly. 欧阳朔笑道:“这是天亡孔雀王朝,将军,天与不取,反受其咎啊。”欧阳朔也没想到,一张不起眼的符箓,竟立下这等奇功。 Thinks so, Bloody Romantic also is really the Great Xia lucky star. 这么看,血色浪漫还真是大夏福星。 Bai Qi hear word, both hands holds the fist in the other hand, solemn said: „Insignificant General understands that this arranged army, exploits a victory Chasing Strike, must give enemy army layer on layer to strike, by the enmity of report beforehand looting.” 白起闻言,双手抱拳,郑重说道:“末将明白,这就安排军队,乘胜追击,务必给予敌军重重一击,以报之前的洗劫之仇。” „This is right.” Ouyang Shuo joyfully. “这样才对。”欧阳朔欣然。 Bai Qi said: „Also asked Your Kingship to help the Insignificant General helping hand, summoned Royal City Imperial Army to go to battle, hits enemy army one to be caught off guard.” 白起跟着说道:“还请王上助末将一臂之力,召唤王城禁军出战,打敌军一个措手不及。” For does not bring to the attention of Great Zhou King Dynasty, summoned Great Han Imperial Army, naturally the later the better, but looked like in Bai Qi, at present is the best opportunity, could not delay. 为了不引起大周王朝的注意,召唤大汉禁军,自然是越晚越好,只是在白起看来,眼下已是最佳时机,拖延不得。 Early, is but electing. 早一点,也是无奈之选。 After all only by the strength of Dragon Rising Army, even if bitter experience of Peacock King Dynasty main forces under Beast Tide drops sharply, but frontier also has 500,000 becomes main forces of organization system, Dragon Rising Army is unable with it resisting with all one's strength. 毕竟仅以龙骧军之力,即便孔雀王朝大军在兽潮下遭遇重挫,可边境还有五十万成建制的大军,龙骧军无法与之力敌。 Most is a tie. 最多是一个平局。 If adds on the 320,000 Great Han cavalry, situation completely will be different, Great Xia military strength one with enemy army quite, but by Dragon Rising Army with brave of Great Han cavalry, the strength contrasts to invert. 如果加上三十二万大汉铁骑,情况就将完全不一样,大夏兵力一下跟敌军相当,而以龙骧军跟大汉铁骑之骁勇,战力对比一下颠倒。 Ouyang Shuo not hesitant, complied with the request of Bai Qi, said with a smile: „Walks, goes to outside the city!” 欧阳朔没有犹豫,答应了白起的请求,笑着说道:“走,去城外！” „!” “诺！” Quick, the group arrive at outside Paungbyin City. 很快,一行人就来到庞宾城外。 At this time, is responsible for monitoring Paungbyin City Peacock King Dynasty main forces, had known the news that last night the army was attacked, the army high alert, prepared to go to rescue Peacock King at any time. 此时,负责监视庞宾城的孔雀王朝大军,已经得知昨晚军队遇袭的消息,全军高度戒备,随时准备前去救援孔雀王。 Saw with own eyes that is stationed goes out of town in Paungbyin City Dragon Rising Army, does not dare to neglect, the entire battalion alerts. 眼见驻扎在庞宾城的龙骧军出城,更是不敢怠慢,全营戒备。 Ouyang Shuo has not paid attention, rapidly completes the summon. 欧阳朔也没理会,迅速完成召唤。 Also on flash's matter, the Paungbyin City suburb flashes through the intermittent dazzling white light, when the white light diverges, appears the 320,000 Great Han cavalry, the scene incomparably shocks. 前后也就一瞬间的事情,庞宾城郊外闪过阵阵耀眼白光,等到白光散去,现出三十二万大汉铁骑,场面无比震撼。 Is a veteran, facial expression arrives around Ouyang Shuo complex, holds the fist in the other hand saying: „Great Han General Shangguan Jie, follows orders to command troops to come to reenforce, whatever King of Xia dispatches!” 为首一员老将,神情复杂地来到欧阳朔跟前,抱拳说道:“大汉将军上官桀,奉命率部前来增援,任凭夏王差遣！” Royal City Imperial Army that Gaia to let summon, put in the battlefield rapidly, did not present other accidents, stipulated that Imperial Army that was summoned, will put in summoner's order unconditionally, did not sell at a discount carries out. 盖亚为了让召唤来的王城禁军,迅速投入战场,不出现其他变故,规定,被召唤来的禁军,将无条件付出召唤者的命令,不打折扣地执行。 Like the war of previous Najja City, even if Peacock King makes Royal City Imperial Army work as the cannon fodder intentionally, Imperial Army also has no alternative, can only suppress the resentment in the psychology. 就像此前的奈加城之战,即便孔雀王故意让王城禁军当炮灰,禁军也无可奈何,只能将怨气憋在心理。 Only then, will erupt in a particular case. 只有在特定情况下,才会爆发出来。 Ouyang Shuo sees from is not Wei Qing, in the eye flashes through a disappointment, he is familiar with History, to some Shangguan Jie this person but actually also understanding. 欧阳朔见来自不是卫青,眼中闪过一丝失望,他熟读历史,对上官桀此人倒也有些了解。 Shangguan Jie, character few uncles, the young then imperial guards time gate court attendant, is famous for the ability, successively holds the Weiyang stable command, too the servant, to wait on the Mid Grade duty, when Emperor Wu of Han Liu Che is seriously ill does obeisance is General of the Left, seals the Anyang marquis, with Huo Guang with receiving Gu command. 上官桀,字少叔,年少时任羽林期门郎,以才力著称,历任未央厩令、太仆、侍中等职,汉武帝刘彻病重时拜为左将军,封安阳侯,与霍光同受顾命。 View its personal history, Shangguan Jie, although is General of the Left, does not have in the armed forces the informed and experienced experience, has held an office in Imperial Court, Emperor Wu of Han sends this person to come the Commander army, obviously is also very angry. 观其履历,上官桀虽为左将军,却无军中历练经历,一直都在朝中任职,汉武帝派此人来统领军队,可见也是非常恼怒的。 After Emperor Zhao takes a seat, Shangguan Jie with the Huo Guang on terms, Shangguan Jie son Shangguan An married the Huo Guang daughter is a wife, two become the relations by marriage, the relations are quite close. 昭帝即位后,上官桀本来与霍光关系良好,上官桀的儿子上官安更是娶了霍光的女儿为妻,两家结为姻亲,关系极为密切。 When Huo Guang goes out, Shangguan Jie replaces the Huo Guang processing government affairs frequently. 霍光外出时,上官桀常常代替霍光处理政务。 Afterward because child of Shangguan An Shangguan Jie subjects to a penalty, favors Ding Wairen to seek government position failure and other event for the Hubei county Grand Princess male, Shangguan Jie and Huo Guang relate become as incompatible as fire and water. 随后因为上官桀之子上官安受罚、为鄂邑长公主的男宠丁外人求官职失败等事件,上官桀与霍光关系变得水火不容。 The Emperor Zhao Yuan phoenix first year September, Shangguan Jie unites Imperial Censor Doctor Sang Hongyang, Yan King Liu Dan and other human desire to give a banquet to murder Huo Guang, soon the matter defeats, the Shangguan Jie fathers and sons were killed. 昭帝元凤元年九月,上官桀联合御史大夫桑弘羊、燕王刘旦等人欲设宴谋杀霍光,不久事败,上官桀父子被杀。 Ouyang Shuo notes, Shangguan Jie looked that his look somewhat moves aside. 欧阳朔注意到,上官桀看他的眼神有些躲闪。 Like Ouyang Shuo, the nature one wants to understand intelligently reason, History is complicated quite deep Huo Guang with Shangguan Jie, at this time in the Great Xia assignment, is ranking the position of Liaojin Viceroy high, the scenery is infinite. 聪明如欧阳朔,自然一下就想明白了其中的缘由,历史跟上官桀交缠颇深的霍光,此时正在大夏任职,高居辽金总督之位,风光无限。 In comparison, Shangguan Jie does not have mixed feelings is strange. 两相比较,上官桀的心情不复杂才怪呢。 Reason that Ouyang Shuo remembers Shangguan Jie, besides the relations of Huo Guang, is Shangguan Jie the legendary experience of granddaughter Shangguan Empress, making him be interested. 欧阳朔之所以记得上官桀,除了霍光的关系,还有就是上官桀的孙女上官皇后的传奇经历,让他颇感兴趣。 The Shangguan six years old entered the palace to be the imperial concubine , over one month, on confers title Shangguan are Empress, were Huaxia historical youngest Empress. 上官氏六岁就进宫做了婕妤,又过了一个多月,就册立上官氏为皇后,是华夏历史上最年幼的皇后。 Emperor Zhao of Han was the Emperor Wu youngest son, in the witchcraft trials, Crown Prince Liu Ju committed suicide, Emperor Wu of Han was dejected, before the point of death confers title Emperor Zhao was new Crown Prince. 汉昭帝是武帝幼子,巫蛊之祸中,太子刘据自杀,汉武帝心灰意冷,直到临死前才册立昭帝为新的太子。 After Emperor Wu died, Emperor Zhao ascended the throne under supporting of feudal official succeeds to the throne, eight years old. 74 B. C., reigned only 14 year Emperor Zhao dead of illness in Chang'an, the year only 21 year. 武帝死后,昭帝在众臣的拥立下登基继位,年仅八岁。公元前74年,在位仅十四年的昭帝就病逝于长安,年仅二十一岁。 After that under Huo Guang and other Chancellor preside over, adopts Changyi king Prince He is the Emperor Zhao son, standing is sovereign Crown Prince, following the Emperor position, Venerable Shangguan for sovereign Empress Dowager. 其后,在霍光等大臣主持下,过继昌邑王刘贺为昭帝儿子,立为皇太子,继皇帝位,尊上官氏为皇太后。 Prince He reigns only 27 days, because of dissolute and unrestrained, does not guarantee State to be abandoned is the common people, known as Han deposed emperor. 刘贺在位仅27天,就因荒淫无度、不保社稷而被废为庶人,史称汉废帝。 After Prince He was abandoned, under Huo Guang preside over, adopts Liu Xun to Emperor Zhao for the son, for Emperor Xuan of Han, Shangguan still for sovereign Empress Dowager. 在刘贺被废之后,又是在霍光的主持下,将刘询过继给昭帝为儿子,是为汉宣帝,上官氏仍为皇太后。 But Emperor Xuan of Han Liu Xun in the witchcraft trials, commits suicide Crown Prince Liu Ju's Sun Zi (grandson), was raised in the imperial concubines quarters, History is this kind of samsara, gets out of trouble, as if returns to the beginning once more. 而汉宣帝刘询正是在巫蛊之祸中,自杀太子刘据的孙子,被养育于掖庭,历史就是这样一个轮回,兜兜转转,仿佛再次回到起点。 Perhaps because of the bitter Classic on Medical Problems experience of childhood, making Emperor Xuan of Han have the opportunity to understand the folk hardship, during reigning makes determined efforts, selects and employs the mertorious, the virtuous feudal official upright and law-abiding official pours forth, famous has the Qilin Pavilion 11 hero. 或许是因为童年的苦难经历,让汉宣帝有机会了解民间疾苦,在位期间励精图治,选贤任能,贤臣循吏辈出,著名的有麒麟阁十一功臣。 Emperor Xuan of Han is Huaxia historical famous Xian, during reigning, national Politics Pure Brightness, the well-off society and Economy prosperous, four foreign admire, „proclaimed resurgence known as filial piety”, Shi Jia said that the Western Han national strength governed powerfully in it. 汉宣帝是华夏历史上有名的贤君,在位期间,全国政治清明、社会和谐、经济繁荣、四夷宾服,史称“孝宣中兴”,史家称西汉国力在其治下最为强盛。 In formulate a Western Han dynasty that the temple number and posthumous name are famous strictly, Liu Xun is four has one of the official temple number Emperor, other three were Gaozu of Han Liu Bang, Emperor Wen of Han as well as Emperor Wu of Han. 在以制定庙号、谥号严格而著称的西汉一朝,刘询是四位拥有正式庙号的皇帝之一,其他三位是汉高祖刘邦、汉文帝以及汉武帝。 49 B. C., Emperor Xuan of Han passed away, Emperor Yuan of Han took a seat, 40 year Shangguan Huang Empress Dowager was honored as too sovereign Empress Dowager, until 37 B. C. Beng Shi, died at the age of 50 two years old. 公元前49年,汉宣帝驾崩,汉元帝即位,四十岁的上官皇太后被尊为太皇太后,直至公元前37年崩逝,享年五十二岁。 Shangguan Empress is after Empress Lu, Empress sovereign Empress Dowager that second holds court administers the affairs of state, is actually not the victor of Dynasty Court struggle, is not the female Lord who the hand grasps the power control world, but is the grass that suspends with the wind, the words that is not obedient, have Dangerous that was abandoned to be killed and killed secretly anytime, remains a widow for 37 years. 上官皇后是继吕后之后,第二位临朝听政的皇后皇太后,却不是朝廷斗争的胜利者,不是手握大权主宰天下的女主,而是一颗随风摆的小草,不听话的话,随时有被废杀、被暗害掉的危险,守寡37年。 From the status, Shangguan had under the entire day the female to earnestly seek, but unavailable honor, seemed like anything has, regulations anything did not have. 从名分上来看,上官氏拥有了全天下女子渴求而不可得的荣誉,看似什么都有,实则什么都没有。 Six years old are Empress, the 15 year make sovereign Empress Dowager and 40 to make too sovereign Empress Dowager, are childless, the daughter-in-law granddaughter-in-law full house of adopting, when for her, eight -year-old father ancestor younger brother was put to death, when the 15 year has been the widow, the 24 year the maternal line was put to death, since losing besides the Little Aunt mother is waste, Huo Chengjun all blood relations. 六岁为皇后,十五岁做皇太后、四十做太皇太后,无儿无女,过继来的儿媳孙媳满堂,但对她来说,八岁时父祖弟弟被诛杀,十五岁就做了寡妇,二十四岁时母系被诛杀,自从失去除了小姨妈废后霍成君之外的所有血亲。 These things abrasioned her childhood to be joyful, left her is the hidden bitterness and loneliness of deep palace, Shangguan in that palace, was bundled stubbornly by the thing of system, until dying. 这些东西磨掉了她的童年快乐,留给她的不过是深宫的幽怨与寂寞,上官氏在那座宫殿里,被一个名叫制度的东西捆得死死的,直到死去。 Ouyang Shuo looks at this History, has endless emotion. 欧阳朔看罢这段历史,也是感慨不已。 At present sees Shangguan grandfather Shangguan Jie, this „chief criminal who” delivers Shangguan Empress to enter the palace, feeling that a space and time fluctuates. 眼下见到上官氏的祖父上官桀,这位送上官皇后进宫的“罪魁祸首”,直有一种时空变幻的感觉。 Ouyang Shuo is Ouyang Shuo, a god, recovers slightly, after accepting gifts, is sideways, resigns Bai Qi, said: „General Shangguan hear of Bai Qi General mix then.” 欧阳朔到底是欧阳朔,稍微一愣神,就回过神来,受礼之后,侧身,让出白起,说道:“上官将军听白起将军调配即可。” „!” “诺！” Shangguan Jie pays a visit Bai Qi, is the establishment high and low conductor relations. 上官桀跟着拜见白起,算是确立上下指挥关系。 After connection, Ouyang Shuo returns to city immediately, all hands over the matter of battlefield by Bai Qi is responsible. Immediately, Bai Qi on the according to front General Commander name, has issued a series of military orders. 交接过后,欧阳朔当即回到城中,将战场之事悉数交由白起负责。当即,白起就以前线总指挥的名义,发布了一系列军令。 Fifth Corps is going out of town immediately, encircles the Peacock King remnants of defeated troops, strives to cut to kill Peacock King. 着第五军团立即出城,围剿孔雀王残部,争取斩杀孔雀王。 Under the Beast Tide attack, over 400,000 Peacock King Dynasty main forces has been not much left, moreover was scattered thoroughly, is the thrashing a drowning dog best opportunity, so long as the Fifth Corps dispatcher is appropriate, when may wipe out this unit. 在兽潮袭击下,四十余万孔雀王朝大军已经所剩无几,而且彻底被打散,正是痛打落水狗的最佳时机,只要第五军团调度得当,当可全歼此部。 But by the energy of Corps Head Xiao Chaogui, when will not be disappointing, Fifth Corps loses seriously, the army thinks up and down also already hated to the marrow of the bones to Peacock King Dynasty main forces, morale does not need to be worried. 而以军团长萧朝贵之能,当不会让人失望,第五军团损失惨重,全军上下想必也早就对孔雀王朝大军恨之入骨,士气是一点都不用担心的。 So in fine weather and favorable geographical position the person gathers, once succeeds, is equal to cutting a Peacock King Dynasty arm. 如此天时地利人合,一旦成功,就等于斩去孔雀王朝一臂。 Dragon Rising Army remaining four Corps, under the Bai Qi centralized dispatcher, the 320,000 Great Han cavalry who coordinating Ouyang Shuo just to summon, launches the general attack to Peacock King Dynasty main forces. 龙骧军剩下的四个军团,则在白起的统一调度下,配合欧阳朔刚召唤出来的三十二万大汉铁骑,对孔雀王朝大军发起总攻。 First met with a disaster, is stationed in Paungbyin City Peacock King Dynasty main forces, under Shangguan Jie conductor, the 320,000 Great Han cavalry acts as Vanguard, such as the ocean waves throw generally toward enemy army. 首先遭殃的,就是驻扎在庞宾城的孔雀王朝大军,在上官桀的指挥下,三十二万大汉铁骑充当先锋,如海浪一般朝敌军扑去。 Opposite Peacock King Dynasty main forces in that moment that the Great Han cavalry was summoned, the complexion blanch that frightens, wants not to think that immediately breaks camp the evacuation. 对面的孔雀王朝大军在大汉铁骑被召唤出来的那一刻,就吓的脸色发白,想都没想,立即拔营撤离。 What a pity, they again quick, quickly Fast as Lightning Great Han cavalry. 可惜,他们就算再快,也快不过风驰电掣的大汉铁骑。 War begins, the National War situation reverses from this. 大战再起,国战形势由此逆转。 ............ ………… Huaxia Region, Great Han King Dynasty, Luoyang. 华夏区,大汉王朝,洛阳。 In the splendid Majestic Wei Yang palace, on ice-cold Dragon Chair, the year the middle ten days Emperor Wu of Han complexion has been pale, both hands such as the hawk grasps general, closely grips the Dragon Chair both sides arm rest, both eyes blood red, wants to select the person to bite. 富丽堂皇的未央宫中,冰冷的龙椅上,年过中旬的汉武帝脸色铁青,双手如鹰抓一般,紧紧地握住龙椅两侧扶手,双眼血红,直欲择人而噬。 „Goes too far, goes too far simply!” “欺人太甚,简直欺人太甚！” Like Emperor Wu of Han, cannot think proud before this certainly, because unexpectedly is proud, is not willing to lower the head to Great Xia King Dynasty, is King Dynasty causes so the trouble. 骄傲如汉武帝,此前绝想不到,竟然会因为骄傲,不愿向大夏王朝低头,为王朝惹下如此祸端。 That moment that 320,000 Imperial Army was transmitted, the Emperor Wu of Han heart was cool, according to the past convention, Imperial Army, once were transmitted, can be delivered, feared that is ten less than one. 三十二万禁军被传送走的那一刻,汉武帝心都凉了,按以往惯例,禁军一旦被传送走,能被送回来的,怕是十不足一。 This to Great Han King Dynasty, is simply fatal. 这对大汉王朝而言,简直是致命的。 The retaliation of Great Xia is really ruthless, making Emperor Wu of Han angry, has no alternative. Great Han King Dynasty is majestically located Central Plains, all around powerful enemy observes the situation, once Imperial Army is not, will be ripped the smashing by the enemy immediately. 大夏的报复真是又狠又准,让汉武帝愤怒无比,却又偏偏无可奈何。大汉王朝雄踞中原,四周强敌环视,一旦禁军不在,立马就会被敌人撕成粉碎。 To Wilderness, this is the normal matter. 对荒野而言,这是再正常不过之事。 Puts the only way out in front of Great Han King Dynasty, to some side influence surrender, only then saves the life, is only by the Emperor Wu of Han mental disposition, even if dies, will not surrender. 摆在大汉王朝面前的唯一出路,就是向某一方势力投降,方可保全性命,只是以汉武帝的秉性,就算是死,也不会投降。 Not so, Emperor Wu of Han will not lower the head to Ouyang Shuo. 非如此,汉武帝也不会不向欧阳朔低头了。 Message that at present Imperial Army was transmitted, but also was blocked stubbornly, but the paper cannot wrap up the fire eventually, once the news travels, Great Han King Dynasty feared that can not strike bursts. 眼下禁军被传送走的消息,还被死死封锁,可纸终究包不住火的,一旦消息传开,大汉王朝怕是会不击自溃。 On ice-cold Dragon Chair, one generation of Heroic Lord, Han's Valiant Great Emperor, facial expression bleak and desolate. 冰冷的龙椅上,一代雄主,汉武大帝,神情萧索。 ............ ………… In June 16 date, Hetao battlefield. 六月十六日,河套战场。 The short five days of time, Peacock King Dynasty main forces was hit retreats in defeat again and again, cannot resist. Was good runs away the birth day because of Peacock King, after main armed forces converged, slightly stands firm the situation. 短短五天时间,孔雀王朝大军就被打得节节败退,根本招架不住。好在孔雀王逃出生天,跟主力部队汇合之后,才算稍稍稳住形势。 Even if so, is unable to reverse losing battle. 即便如此,也无法扭转败局。 To consume the 320,000 Great Han cavalry in the battlefield, attack of Bai Qi not only firm, and callous, the war projects on the later period, has not counted the sacrifice, must create huge killing to Peacock King Dynasty main forces. 为了将三十二万大汉铁骑消耗在战场,白起的攻击既坚决,又冷酷,战争打到后期,已是不计牺牲,务必对孔雀王朝大军造成巨大杀伤。 „This group of lunatics!” “这群疯子！” Under Great Xia Pursuing the Fight till the End, the Peacock King complexion is pale, clenches teeth, exposes the fierce and ambitious true colors, ordering the army to evacuate Hetao Province, extinguished thoroughly to the Hetao Province ambition. 在大夏的穷追猛打之下,孔雀王脸色铁青,一咬牙,展露枭雄本色,下令全军撤离河套行省,彻底熄了对河套行省的野心。 This time, Peacock King is really giving away the bride whilst also losing one's army, lost seriously did not say that was unable to overcome, even if city, dingily returned to the home. 这一次,孔雀王真是赔了夫人又折兵,损失惨重不说,还没能打下哪怕一座城池,就灰溜溜地逃回国内。 After this war, Peacock King will reduce in the Tianzhu Region prestige inevitably greatly. 经此一战,孔雀王在天竺区的威望势必大减。 South Gupta King Dynasty obtains the news of Peacock King Dynasty withdrawal of troops, accomplished nothing under surrounding of Imperial Guard Army, does not have two words, evacuates speedily, vanishes in the boundless sea rapidly. 南面的笈多王朝得到孔雀王朝撤军的消息,本就在禁卫军的围堵下无所作为,没有二话,一溜烟跟着撤离,迅速消失在茫茫大海。 Is slow, feared that must be counter-encircled by Great Xia Army. 再慢一点,怕是要被大夏军反包围。 King of Gupta Akbar worthily is Azure Insignia senior member, attacks is not positive, retreats that to call one to slide, has not waited for Indian Ocean Fleet to recover, returned to Tianzhu Region. 笈多王阿克巴不愧是湛蓝徽章的资深成员,进攻不怎么积极,撤退那叫一个溜啊,没等印度洋舰队回过神来,就已经回到天竺区。 Makes the person praise without cease seriously. 当真让人赞叹不已。 As Gupta King Dynasty withdraws troops, National War that Tianzhu Region initiates on own initiative, just arrived in mid June, finished on tiger's head but actually a snake's tail. The result comes out, unavoidably is shocking. 随着笈多王朝撤军,天竺区主动发起的国战,刚到六月中旬,就虎头蛇尾地结束。结果出来,不免让人大跌眼镜。 Lets also in behind that the person cannot think. 更让人想不到的还在后面。 Peacock King Dynasty main forces must remove, Great Xia actually does not comply, had not finished while National War, immediately arranged Great Han cavalry Chasing Strike, outrageously enters in Peacock King Dynasty, raises foul wind and blood rain. 孔雀王朝大军要撤,大夏却是不答应,趁着国战还没结束,当即安排大汉铁骑一路追击,悍然杀入孔雀王朝境内,掀起一场腥风血雨。 Among the hosts and visitors, already exchanged ownerships. 主客之间,已然易主。 To Great Xia, the Great Han cavalry is Suicide Squad, naturally must display the afterheat, must come big sweeping to Peacock King Dynasty frontier, destroys its Village, snatches its belongings, thinks the revenge. 对大夏而言,大汉铁骑就是一支敢死队,自然要发挥余热,务必对孔雀王朝边境来一次大扫荡,毁其村落,抢其财物,以为复仇。 „How Peacock King Dynasty copes with us, wants double also to go back.” Ouyang Shuo said. “孔雀王朝怎么对付我们,都要双倍还回去。”欧阳朔如是说。 Goal that Ouyang Shuo does this, naturally is not the pure revenge, one is to consume the Great Han cavalry, is the Southeast Warzone following Military motion puts down barrier ; two to further destroy the Peacock King Dynasty border defense taking advantage of this, damages the Peacock King Dynasty confidence, contains rising of Peacock King Dynasty. 欧阳朔这样做的目的,自然不是单纯的复仇,一则是消耗大汉铁骑,为东南战区接下来的军事行动扫平障碍；二则是借此进一步摧毁孔雀王朝的边防,打击孔雀王朝的信心,遏制孔雀王朝的崛起。 Only then hit to hurt Peacock King Dynasty, Peacock King will not have the different kind thoughts. 只有将孔雀王朝打疼了,孔雀王才不会起别样心思。 Again a little, if can weaken the Peacock King Dynasty strength, making it drop to with the Gupta King Dynasty same level level, then Tianzhu Region competition structure, will welcome the new variable. 再有一点,如果能借此削弱孔雀王朝的实力,使其跌落至跟笈多王朝同等水平,那么天竺区的竞争格局,就将迎来新的变数。 Two tigers contend, again did not have the energy with Great Xia confront. 两虎相争,就再没有精力跟大夏对抗了。 Then, can maximum limit maintain the peace of Hetao Province frontier, was Great Xia solves internal hidden danger to win the precious time. 如此一来,才能最大限度地维护河套行省边境的安宁,为大夏解决内部隐患赢得宝贵的时间。 When National War Month finished, except summon Royal City Imperial Army, Peacock King Dynasty at least lost 400,000 main forces, was equal to that Collective Army is defeated thoroughly, moreover frontier changes into Ruins. 等到国战月结束,除召唤的王城禁军,孔雀王朝至少损失了四十万大军,等于是一个集团军彻底覆没,而且边境化为废墟。 Before making war, Peacock King has not thought certainly that finally can be this kind of result. 开战之前,孔雀王绝没想到,最终会是这样一个结果。\n\nTo display comments and comment, click at the button"
