Liu Zhao (79 — 106), respected as Emperor He of Han, was a very controversial monarch of the Eastern Han Dynasty (25 — 220).

​

He was an excellent emperor with splendid accomplishments that made his empire reach another peak.

Still, he also was the one who left a substantial potential peril that caused the prosperous empire to collapse gradually in the next century.

A Child Emperor Under the Control of His Adoptive Mother

​

When Liu Zhao was little, he was adopted by a childless queen named Dou.

Afterward, his birth mother was framed and committed suicide, and her entire clan perished.

​

When he turned 9, his father passed away.

Hence, he ascended to the throne as a child emperor, his adoptive mother Dou was respected as the empress dowager, and her clan obtained all power.

​

Gradually, more people from Dou's clan were promoted to important positions, which made her clan quite powerful, especially after her brother Dou Xian defeated the Xiongnu for good.

Power and Conspiracies of the House of Dou

​

Soon, the House of Dou included a powerful empress dowager, an excellent marshal in charge of the army, some royal princesses, and many noble lords.

​

While on the other side was the lonely teenage emperor Liu Zhao; he had no idea who among his officials was loyal to him or the House of Dou.

​

Though his ancestors tried very hard to avoid the powerful clan of the empress dowager, this still happened inescapably.

​

The powerful and contributive general Dou Xian (? — 92), brother of Empress Dowager Dou, was an exceptional marshal but arrogant.

After the southern part of the Xiongnu allied with the Han by marriage, the northern force kept fighting and further expanded during Wang Mang's reign (9 — 23).

​

Dou Xian led Han's army, allied with the southern Xiongnu, and defeated the northern part several times.

​

When the northern Xiongnu wanted to surrender, the southern Xiongnu instigated the negotiation to fail, so Dou Xian led his army, attacked, and chased the rest of the forces westward far away until they disappeared.

​

From that time on, in the Han Empire's documents, this aggressive and strong nomadic regime that had fought with the Han for hundreds of years was finally defeated and perished for good in the history of China.

Afterward, Dou Xian was given countless privileges and power.

​

However, he didn’t know that nothing could keep expanding or when to be humble and modest.

​

He occupied many farmlands illegally, including a royal princess’ property, kept many professional assassins, and murdered a lord from royal Liu’s clan out of jealousy and those who disagreed or displeased him.

​

Soon, Dou Xian and his followers planned to assassinate Liu Zhao and rebel, but the emperor was informed.

Toppling the House of Dou with the Aid of the Eunuchs

​

Though he was still a kid, Liu Zhao gradually realized that he was just a puppet emperor, while the House of Dou obtained the actual dominance.

​

However, most of his relatives were members of the House of Dou, and most ministers and generals were following or maybe secretly supporting this clan.

Besides, Liu Zhao’s every move was monitored as well.

​

That way, the only group that Emperor Liu Zhao could easily reach and trust was the eunuch, those imperial servants who had been serving him.

Liu Zhao asked some eunuchs, and his royal guards ambushed a palace carefully.

He tricked Dou Xian and his leading followers to come under the name of celebrating their military success.

​

Afterward, Liu Zhao captured Dou Xian's followers and removed his military power; then, he commanded Dou Xian and other influential people of the Dou clan to commit suicide.

​

In the end, Liu Zhao was told about how his adoptive mother, Dou, framed up and murdered his birth mother and her entire clan; but he didn't demote or punish Empress Dowager Dou.

​

After she passed away, she was buried with Liu Zhao's father, using the ceremony of an empress dowager.

An Excellent Teenager Emperor Liu Zhao and His Reign

​

Now Liu Zhao was a 13-year-old emperor who was already quite strong and decisive.

​

Afterward, he kept working diligently, as other good monarchs had done in the history of China. He cared about civilians, lowered taxes, encouraged agriculture, and selected qualified officials to ensure the government operated efficiently.

​

He also further expanded his realm and made peace with nearby regions.

​

Liu Zhao passed away when he was 27; that year, the population of the Han Empire surpassed 53 million, and people were living in peace and wealth.

​

He left the Han Empire to a baby emperor of only a few months old and his beautiful and intelligent queen Deng Sui.

Therefore, maybe Liu Zhao's decision wasn't entirely wrong; things that wronged the dynasty in the following century were more about people.

​

But Liu Zhao's reign was indeed a turning point for the Han Dynasty in the history of China.

After his departure, till the Han dynasty ended over a century later, none of the following emperors obtained actual centralized power.

​

Instead, nearly most of the following emperors of the Han Dynasty after Emperor He of Han had repeated the same fate, which they ascended to the throne at a very young age when the empress dowager and her clan, or eunuch group, were in charge of almost everything.

​

Some emperors tried to fight, while others just lived with the flow, but none of them could achieve as much success as Liu Zhao did.

​

Since then, the Han Dynasty gradually declined.
