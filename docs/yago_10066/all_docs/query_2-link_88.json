I wanted to write a profile about an uptown icon known as Kurtis Blow for a black publication. A Harlemite, he had become the first solo rap artist to land a record deal with a major label, the first to enjoy commercial success, and the first to embark on a national and international concert tour. Well, it seemed like a no-brainer to me. But the editor of the magazine, a heavyset, rather self-important product of the black middle class, looked at me with disdain. We’re not gonna cover rap, he said. It doesn’t deserve the ink.\n\nBack in the early days, it wasn’t just the black media who didn’t care. Somewhere in my files I still have a copy of an article I penned in 1982 titled A Consumer Guide to Rap, an introductory piece about the 12-inch singles of Blow Eddie Cheeba, and the Treacherous Three. I submitted it optimistically to The New York Times, who rejected the piece with a note: \"too specialized for the Times audience.\"\n\nI remember receiving hostile reactions from many editors when I tried to write about it, as if hip-hop were an infection that could be cured by simply ignoring it. Others were polite in their disdain, however equally disinterested. But an editor here and there would show me love when I pitched a rap piece, particularly those in the world of alternative weeklies like The Village Voice and New York Rocker. By the early 1980s you could (just barely) feed yourself writing about rapping DJs, break dancing, and 12-inch singles.\n\nWhen I began writing about hip-hop, there were no publications like Vibe, The Source, or XXL. No 106 & Park existed to broadcast images of rappers in action. No national ad campaigns featured rap music, hip-hop slang or style. In fact the culture now known internationally as hip-hop didn’t even have a name. It was just a series of seemingly miscellaneous expressions that involved rhyming, dancing, spray painting, and music.\n\nThe first few times I wrote about hip-hop it seemed like, at best, a fad. Some viewed it as just some weird thing coming out of the neglected hoods of outer-borough New York at a time when the city was beat down and broke. The thing that kept me coming back to it didn’t live in its expressions alone. Sure, the break dancing was amazing and the dance beats, as we used to say, were da joint. But the spirit of invention that emanated from the scene was what was so captivating. With limited resources, no institutional support, and little interest from most adults, hip-hop was driven by a will to create and a desire to party that would, ultimately prove unstoppable.\n\nMy contribution to this collection comes from a time when much of my energy was being spent chronicling the massive crossover success of Michael Jackson, Prince, Whitney Houston, and other pop stars of the day. However, my obsession revolved around the evolution of hip-hop, which was happening right in front of my eyes, to the delight of my ears. I befriended Russell Simmons through my roommate, who coproduced Kurtis Blovv’s first hits, and was amazed at how his development from club promoter to record producer/manager unfolded. I later did a profile of Simmons for Essence magazine, but only after The Village Voice and other progressive mainstream publications had validated him.\n\nSo it is with great pride that I can—along with a small group of others who are also featured in this anthology—now call myself a pioneering hip-hop writer. Now a whole generation of aspiring scribes can cut its teeth writing about MCs, multimillion-dollar stars, and the monumental range of issues that hip-hop has raised about America, capitalism, violence, misogyny, sex, and poverty The pieces in this book reflect both the growth of the music and the spectrum of reactions to that growth. So this is a document not merely of artists and their records, but also a window into the popular dialogue that hip-hop has made possible. Whether you love hip-hop culture or are struggling to understand it, these collected texts are a road map to a journey that, despite the haters, continues on and on to the break of dawn.\n\nNelson George / Brooklyn / October 2003\n\nIntroduction\n\nMy torrid love affair with hip-hop began when I was a young girl growing up in the Inwood section of Upper Manhattan. I was transfixed by the graffiti art of Fab 5 Freddy Lee Quinones MARE, and the Manhattan Subway Kings, who were native to my neighborhood. I was overwhelmed by Red Alert’s raspy voice on 98.7 Kiss FM, spinning the freshest joints at the time, and by the dancing’s acrobatics and fierceness. While my neighborhood was fairly popular, or rather infamous, due to the graffiti, gang violence, break dancing that was ever present in the park adjoining the Dyckman projects, and the occasional film crew, we were clueless that hip-hop would one day leave the ghetto to go live with the Jeffersons. Not even when the larger-than-life TV star Lorenzo Lamas bum-rushed my babysitter’s block to shoot a scene using real gang members—the Ball Busters—as extras for the saccharine Body Rock flick did I think that hip-hop would survive this cheesy marauding by Hollywood. While I did notice the occasional tourist snapping photos of the graffiti art that enveloped Inwood Park’s baseball fields in the early eighties, neither my peers nor I imagined that our love of the genre, this pedagogy of the oppressed, would morph into a billion-dollar industry. I was wrong.\n\nMy foray into writing came in front of the mic as a spoken-word artist—a hair over a decade ago—when New York City was burgeoning with a raw underground rendering of what would become a Def Poetry jam. Spoken-word artists were, like the journalists of the decade, using rap music and hip-hop culture as a societal reflector because the genre was, in turn, defining our generation. The contradictions that existed in rap music and its participants (including yours truly), the misogyny, sex, love, hate, the schisms, were among the topics we used to move the crowd. Poets often shared the stage with rappers like The Fugees, Mos Def and Talib Kweli, Freestyle Fellowship, The Roots, and some of their forefathers like Gil Scott-Heron and The Last Poets. Some of us parlayed our thoughts into long-form, some of us became authors, and others, HBO fixtures.\n\nThis was the beginning of hip-hop journalism—a genre unto itself that would afford many of us poets-cum-journalists a way to marry our love of words and the music into potentially lucrative careers. Twenty-five years after the release of Sugarhill Gang’s Rapper’s Delight, the first Billboard-charted rap single—but certainly not the first rap record—there is even an argument to be made for hip-hop writing’s adoption as a sixth element of the culture—behind deejaying, emceeing, dancing, graffiti, and fashion—due to its critical role in archiving and reporting the history, present, and undoubtedly the future of hip-hop. It would also be fair to say hip-hop journalism is, in fact, an extension of rap music. As a verbal art form, the writings are illustrations of vivid landscapes—some sensational, some introspective, some fantastical, some of which are slices of inner-city blues, and many of which are recanted with lyrical mastery—that are narratives all the same.\n\nThis medley of literary biscuits, collected in And It Don’t Stop, is more than just a reader, or an accessory of must-have articles for your library. It’s a critical journey exploring an unprecedented relationship between artist and journalist—church and state—and includes some of the very first hip-hop features, along with controversial articles that created rifts between hip-hop artists and the journalists who covered them, as well as those indelible writings that recorded our modern tragedies—loss of icons and loss of focus as senseless violence and the horror of AIDS infiltrated the music and culture. This is the first book to chronicle hip-hop journalism, and it does so by showcasing and celebrating the writing from the various periods of what is now known as hip-hop, rather than simply reflecting back on the movement with the ease of twenty-twenty hindsight. These articles are not removed from the context of the times they report on; these articles are the context. But most importantly for many hip-hop aficionados, including yours truly who feel hip-hop’s most popular element, rap music, has run away from its creative and critical beginnings, And It Don’t Stop is a reminder of hip-hop’s remarkable staying power and still untapped potential.\n\nSo, we begin with the all-but-forgotten humble beginnings of hip-hop. The graffiti artist, the breaker, the deejay and the emcee. Graffiti artists became the first djalis, or storytellers, of this New World of hip-hop by using New York subway cars as a means of sounding the alarm that heralded the arrival of an infectious new force. That force, later christened hip-hop, was spawned from New York City’s concrete jungles in the 1970s to become the ultimate expression of black youth resistance to poverty and oppression. First in the South Bronx and then throughout each of New York’s five boroughs and beyond, hip-hop was further embodied in the breaker’s psychedelic dance movements, the deejay’s rhythmic party beats, and the emcee’s poignant and stirring lyrics.\n\nFrom the outset it was clear that this hip-hop was no fad. It was instead the rumblings of a movement—strong enough and necessary enough to evade all efforts to quiet its call, including not only Mayor Edward I. Koch’s declared war on our beloved djalis, but also President Reagan’s failed Reagan Revolution, which, while intending to bring to the inner cities the great confident roar of American progress and growth and optimism, in fact did little to give our crack-infested urban centers the necessary face-lift. Hip-hop would survive these early attacks and grow like an errant vine to overtake America’s sound garden and at once become the needed didactic response, if you will, to the schisms plaguing the direct descendants of the Civil Rights generation.\n\nHip-hop, like rock music in the 1960s, morphed into the dominant rebel yell of youth culture in New York City Chuck D, front man for Public Enemy one of the most influential and dynamic groups of our history-in-the-making, said it best in a controversial statement after the release of their classic album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, in which he dubbed hip-hop the black CNN. He believed that rap music related what was happening in the inner city in a way that mainstream media could not project or even understand. Hip-hop journalism built on the tradition of hip-hop as a societal reflector. The hip-hop journalists not only understood, but were themselves participants also aching to be understood. This collection is then a slice of the rousing perspective of journalists who sent dispatches from hip-hop’s epicenter, who took their roles as historians, chronicling the culture, defining the tenets that made this genre become such a powerful voice, and pointing out its contradictions and its potency at once, quite seriously\n\nBy the time Rapper’s Delight was released, hip-hop, which was initially being covered as just listings and blurbs in the black press, had surprised us all and gone pop, sprouting up and out of every crevice of the planet where youth culture expresses itself through art, music, dance, and fashion. And as with most things that go POP! in American culture, what started out primarily as a black and Latino subculture has been uprooted and co-opted by mainstream marketers who neatly package everything from soft drinks to game shows and fast food. The mainstreaming of hip-hop has made it almost impossible to distinguish it from a commercial jingle. Still hip-hop has done more for our generation—whose core demographic is now in its thirties and forties—than what even basketball has done for kids in the inner city. For better or for worse, the wild success of rap music has created not only a handful of coveted positions for the lucky few who have managed to flex their lyrical mastery in front of the mic, it has also created positions in recording, publishing, fashion, film, and journalism,.\n\nToday would-be hip-hop journalists are faced with a challenge to explore the substance beneath the surface. While the writings about hip-hop in the alternative press legitimized the music because it helped identify it to the masses in the eighties, and helped our generation define itself within its social and political paradigms in the nineties, we are now being faced with the task of covering more interesting aspects than what the mainstream predicates. And while we’re ushering in the new millennium, writing about hip-hop still has the potential to be used as a conduit for change. Journalists should take a cue from what has been written in the previous decades and add to the discussions cemented by the writers featured in this collection, as well as that of their peers, to use hip-hop as a powerful tool for a new age of thinkers.\n\nThe articles featured here are also a matter of passion versus, if you will, access. Now that hip-hop has been repackaged to be made accessible to every young, white mall rat in Middle America who is buying into the negative, inflated stereotypes affirmed by the artists themselves, mainstream media have adopted widespread coverage of the feral child ignored at birth. The articles featured in the following pages are a humble attempt to capture moments that have contributed to shaping the culture and propelling the various subcultures it’s influenced, like new jack swing, hip-house, and hip-hop soul, for instance, into the mainstream. It’s important to capture these lyrical portraits, these moments that helped shape the new pop culture—hip-hop—because not doing so is to ignore a significant volume of American history.\n\nThis collection is also an ode to the writers who inspired me, and countless other would-be journalists, to fuse their love of words with a commitment to the art form unconditionally regardless of how it oftentimes did not love us back. I honor every single contributor who participated in the creation of this joint for the vivid telling of how it really is and was.\n\nIt’s been long overdue.\n\nRaquel Cepeda\n\n1980s:\n\nLooking for the Perfect Beat\n\nIn the 1970s, hip-hop culture arose in and out of the Bronx—where Kurtis Blow claimed the people were fresh, by way of its innovative B-boys, rappers, DJs, and graffiti maestros cultivating their art. Its proud adoptive father Afrika Bambaataa eventually christened the culture hip-hop, a term that first appeared in print in an article written by Steven Hager, Afrika Bambaataa’s Hip-Hop, etching Bambaataa’s place in the testament of the movement.\n\nBy the time the multiplatinum classic record Rapper’s Delight by the Sugarhill Gang proved commercially viable in 1979, a rainbow coalition of journalists, photographers, filmmakers, producers, fashionistas, and promoters was conspiring in documenting and defining the art form. When the general public got a whiff of just how funky the B-boy (and B-girl) was, he became the media darling and an essential prop to any fresh party. The graffiti documentary Style Wars, and films like Wild Style, the Hollywood co-opted Flashdance, Beat Street, Breakin’, Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo, and later, the Russell Simmons—produced krush Groove, propelled break-dancers, graffiti artists, and rappers to celebrity status not just in the States, but all over the world.\n\nTheir global popularity soon led to a demand for a showcasing of the culture on foreign ground, which was met when the first international rap tour, plucking a group of talented young blacks and Latinos from the streets of New York City, journeyed to Europe’s hot spots. Attempting to re-create in writing the booming club scene abroad, writer and editor David Hershkovits accompanied the tour only to end up documenting the cultural divide that gaped between the entertainers and their global audience, and at the same time the universality of the music and the dancer, in his article London Rocks, Paris Burns, and the B-Boys Break a Leg, for the now defunct Sunday News Magazine insert for the New York Daily News.\n\nHershkovits, a fixture in the psychedelic melting pot of the downtown New York scene in the 1980s where the art world and B-boys would collide harmoniously on the dance floor, was also an editor who encouraged other writers, like Steven Hager, to pursue their curiosity about the burgeoning hip-hop scene. Along with Hager, Bill Adler, dance critic Sally Banes, Nelson George, and other early journalistic pioneers, Hershkovits made the first attempts to truly define what hip-hop culture was and its potential as an international force with which to be reckoned. What particularly defined this nascent hip-hop culture in the 1980s was the club and party scene. One of the most popular attractions in the Bronx, other than the zoo, was Sal Abbatiello’s Disco Fever. Some fifteen subway stops north of Studio 54, Disco Fever, as Bill Adler wrote in 1983 in his article The South Bronx Was Getting a Bad Rap Until a Club Called Disco Fever Came Along, had emerged as the headquarters of rap music. So important were the DJs at the Fever that if they didn’t spin your record, felt Russell Simmons, your joint was just wack. And who would know better than Simmons, who was already being touted a mogul by The Wall Street Journal at twenty-seven, as reported by Nelson George in his article Rappin’ with Russell.\n\nSimmons would eventually be responsible for making rap music equal big business, and the bigger the business the more dire the need for competent and accurate coverage. This need for coverage soon cemented an unprecedented closeness between the artists and those who wrote about them. Hip-hop personalities weren’t as accessible or on the World Wide Web, and the genre wasn’t synonymous with pop culture at this time, so journalists covering this insular scene had to parlay in the cut with the artists they wanted to write about.\n\nSignaling the possibilities of this new relationship between hip-hop artists, their handlers, and the writers who covered them, Bill Adler went from writing about the art form and participants like Russell Simmons to becoming someone to be covered himself. Nelson George was soon writing about his journalistic peer, and his lifelong contribution to hip-hop, as Adler morphed from hip-hop writer to director of publicity for Rush Artist Management and Def Jam Recordings in 1984, becoming Simmons’s second full-time employee. Adler also has the distinction of being the only writer of this period to still be almost exclusively immersed in hip-hop culture, penning an authorized Run-D.M.C. biography, and founding a New York City—based gallery devoted to showcasing hip-hop photography.\n\nBy the mid-eighties, rap was becoming bigger business, giving those who wrote about it much more to do. Graffiti art and breaking gave way to rapping with the crossover success of artists like Run-D.M.C., whose collaboration with Aerosmith on Walk This Way in 1986 marked rap’s arrival on Music Television, better known as MTV, exposed rap to an audience of rock enthusiasts, and led to the debut of YO! MTV Raps in 1988. L.L. Cool J, the Beastie Boys, Slick Rick, EPMD, and 3rd Bass then muscled aside the pioneers with their mainstream appeal and corporate sponsorship.\n\nBy the mid-eighties seminal groups like KRS-One’s Boogie Down Productions and the controversial Public Enemy, like no other collectives before (or since), also began using rap music not only as a method to entertain, but to educate the masses—edutainment, as described by KRS-One, ironically paving the way for both the innate anger in the rap expression of South Central, Los Angeles, and the pan-Afrocentric Native Tongues Movement. Public Enemy’s Chuck D became a media obsession because of his brutally honest depictions of life in the inner cities at the mercy of policemen and other social ills, and the contradictions that plagued his group. John Leland, who began writing about hip-hop in 1982, had a special relationship, if you will, with Chuck D. Giving us a hint about what would become a running theme of tension between artists and the writers who critiqued their music, Leland managed to tick Chuck D off with a record review he had penned for The Village Voice, which resulted in threats. The article featured in this section represented the first time the two had met since the one-sided war of words had begun.\n\nWhile the dance and graffiti art of hip-hop became less popular as the hybrid sound of A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, Jungle Brothers, Black Sheep, Brand Nubian, Queen Latifah, and others was embraced, rap music’s colorful, sometimes erratic creators were by the late eighties proving to be the stuff great stories were made of, both in print and in the films of young directors like Spike Lee, and later John Singleton and Albert and Allen Hughes. By the end of the decade, journalists, and those aspiring to be, had found the perfect beat to coverin hip-hop.\n\nHowever, there would not have been a platform to set it off had it not been for the trailblazing efforts of the journalists with the vision, who announced to the world that this wild child had been born. And because of their efforts, featured in the following pages, everybody knew its name was hip-hop.\n\nPhysical Graffiti\n\nBreaking Is Hard to Do\n\nSALLY BANES\n\nChico and Tee and their friends from 175th Street in the High Times crew were breaking in the subway and the cops busted them for fighting.\n\nWe’re not fighting. We’re dancing! they claimed. At the precinct station, one kid demonstrated certain moves: a head spin, ass spin, swipe, chin freeze, the Helicopter, the Baby.\n\nAn officer called in the other members of the crew, one by one. Do a head spin, he would command as he consulted a clipboard full of notes. Do ‘the Baby’ As each kid complied, performing on cue as unhesitatingly as a ballet dancer might toss off an enchainement, the cops scratched their heads in bewildered defeat.\n\nOr so the story goes. But then, like ballet and like great battles (it shares elements of both), breaking is wreathed in legends. This guy in Queens does a whole bunch of head spins in a row, more than ten; he spins, stops real quick, spins …\n\nYeah, but he stops. Left just goes right into seven spins, he never stops.\n\nThere’s a ten-year-old kid on my block learned to break in three days.\n\nThe best is Spy Ronnie Don, Drago, me [Crazy Legs], Freeze, Mongo, Mr. Freeze, Lace, Track Two, Weevil …\n\nSpy he’s called the man with the thousand moves, he had a girl and he taught her how to break. She did it good. She looked like a guy\n\nSpy man, in ’78—he was breaking at Mom and Pop’s on Katonah Avenue in the Bronx, he did his footwork so fast you could hardly see his feet.\n\nI saw Spy doing something wild in a garage where all the old-timers used to break. They had a priest judging a contest, and Spy was doing some kind of Indian dance. All of a sudden, he threw himself in the air, his hat flew up, he spun on his back, and the hat landed right on his chest. And everyone said, ‘That was luck.’ So he did it once more for the priest, and the hat landed right on his chest. If I didn’t see it, I would never have believed it.\n\nThe heroes of these legends are the Break Kids, the B Boys, the Puerto Rican and black teenagers who invent and endlessly elaborate this exquisite, heady blend of dancing, acrobatics, and martial spectacle. Like other forms of ghetto street culture—graffiti, verbal dueling, rapping—breaking is a public arena for the flamboyant triumph of virility wit, and skill. In short, of style. Breaking is a way of using your body to inscribe your identity on streets and trains, in parks and high school gyms. It is a physical version of two favorite modes of street rhetoric, the taunt and the boast. It is a celebration of the flexibility and budding sexuality of the gangly male adolescent body It is a subjunctive expression of bodily states, testing things that might be or are not, contrasting masculine vitality with its range of opposites: women, babies, animals; and death. It is a way of claiming territory and status, for yourself and for your group, your crew But most of all, breaking is a competitive display of physical and imaginative virtuosity a codified dance-form-cum-warfare that cracks open to flaunt personal inventiveness.\n\nFor the current generation of B Boys, it doesn’t really matter that the Breakdown is an old name in Afro-American dance for both rapid, complex footwork and a competitive format. Or that a break in jazz means a soloist’s improvised bridge between melodies. For the B Boys, the history of breaking started six or seven years ago, maybe in the Bronx, maybe in Harlem. It started with the Zulus. Or with Charlie Rock. Or with Joe, from the Casanovas, from the Bronx, who taught Charlie Rock. Breaking means going crazy on the floor. It means making a style for yourself. In Manhattan, kids call it rocking. A dancer in the center of a ring of onlookers drops to the floor, circles around his own axis with a flurry of slashing steps, then spins, flips, gesticulates, and poses in a flood of rhythmic motion and fleeting imagery that prompts the next guy to top him. To burn him, as the B Boys put it.\n\nFab 5 Freddy Love, a graffiti-based artist and rapper from Bedford-Stuyvesant, remembers that breaking began around the same time as rapping, as a physical analogue for a musical impulse. Everybody would be at a party in the park in the summer, jamming. Guys would get together and dance with each other, sort of a macho thing where they would show each other who could do the best moves. They started going wild when the music got real funky— music by groups like Super Sperm and Apache. As the beat of the drummer came to the fore, the music let you know it was time to break down, to free style. The cadenced, rhyming, fast-talking epic mode of rapping, with its smooth surface of sexual braggadocio, provides a perfect base for a dance style that is cool, swift, and intricate.\n\nBut breaking isn’t just an urgent response to pulsating music. It is also a ritual combat that transmutes aggression into art. In the summer of ’78, Tee remembers, when you got mad at someone, instead of saying, ‘Hey man, you want to fight?’ you’d say ‘Hey man, you want to rock?’ Inside the ritual frame, burgeoning adolescent anxieties, hostilities, and powers are symbolically manipulated and controlled.\n\nEach segment in breaking is short, from ten to thirty seconds—but packed with action and meaning. The dancing always follows a specific format: the entry, a stylized walk into the ring for four or five beats to the music; the footwork, a rapid, circular scan of the floor by sneakered feet while the hands support the body’s weight and the head and torso revolve slowly—a kind of syncopated pirouette; the freeze, or stylized signature pose, usually preceded by a spin; the exit, a return to verticality and to the outside of the circle. The length of the combination can be extended by adding on more footwork-spin-freeze sequences. The entry the footwork, and the exit are pretty much the same from dancer to dancer—although some do variations, like Freeze from the Breakmasters crew, who stuffs a Charleston into his entry, and then exits on pointe. But it is largely in the freeze that each dancer’s originality shines forth, in configurations that are as intricate, witty, obscene, or insulting as possible. A dancer will twist himself into a pretzel. Or he will quote the poses of a pinup girl. He might graphically hump the floor, or arch up grabbing his crotch. Someone else might mime rowing a boat or swimming or emphasize acrobatic stunts like backflips and fish dives. Sometimes two breakers team up for a stunt: imitating a dog on a leash, or a dead person brought back to life by a healthy thump on the chest. According to Rammelzee, a DJ who’s gotten too tall to break, the set of sequences adds up to a continuing pantomimic narrative. It is each dancer’s responsibility to create a new chapter in the story. Like if you see a guy acting like he’s dead, the brother who went before him probably shot him.\n\nWhen you choose your moves, you not only try to look good; you try to make your successor look bad by upping the ante. That’s one way to win points from the crowd, which collectively judges. Going first is a way to score a point, but so is coming up with a cool response, chilling out. Through the freeze, you insult, challenge, and humiliate the next person. You stick your ass in his direction. You hold your nose to your spine, signaling a move so good it hurts. But the elegant abstract dancing that couches these messages counts, too. B Boys from the Bronx and Manhattan look down on the up rock prevalent in Brooklyn, a mere string of scatological and sexual affronts without the aesthetic glue of spinning and getting down on the floor.\n\nNaming and performing the freezes you invent are ways of laying claim to them, though some poses are in the public domain. A lot of breakers are also graffiti artists, and one way to announce a new freeze is to write it as graffiti. Speed and smoothness are essential to the entire dance, but in the freeze humor and difficulty are prized above all. You try to put your head on your arm and your toenails on your ears, says Ken of the Breakmasters. Hard stuff, like when I made up my elbow walk, says Kip Dee of Rock Steady When you spin on your head. When you take your legs and put them in back of your head out of the spin.\n\nDuring the summers the B Boys gravitate to the parks, where DJs and rappers hang out. Younger kids learn to break by imitating the older kids, who tend to outgrow it when they’re about sixteen. Concrete provides the best surface for the feet and hands to grip, but the jamming is thickest in the parks, where the DJs can bring their mikes and amplifiers. During the winters, breakers devise new moves. Crazy Legs, of Rock Steady claims the W, in which he sits on doubled-back legs, was an accident.\n\nOnce I was laying on the floor and I kicked my leg and I started spinning, says Mr. Freeze, of Breakmasters. But inventing freezes also demands the hard daily work of conscious experiment. You got to sweat it out. You don’t stop, even when you sleep. I have breaking dreams, several B Boys have told me. I wake up and try to do it like I saw it. Kip Dee dreamed he spun on his chin, but I woke up and tried it and almost broke my face.\n\nPart of the macho quality of breaking comes from the physical risk involved. It’s not only the bruises, scratches, cuts, and scrapes. As the rivalry between the crews heats up, ritual combat sometimes erupts into fighting for real. And part of it is impressing the girls. They go crazy over it, says Ken. When you’re in front of a girl, you like to show off. You want to burn the public eye, because then she might like you.\n\nSome people claim that breaking is played out. Freddy Love disagrees. The younger kids keep developing it, doing more wild things and more new stuff. We never used to spin or do acrobatics. The people who started it just laid down the foundations. Just like in graffiti—you make a new style. That’s what life in the street is all about, just being you, being who you are around your friends. What’s at stake is a guy’s honor and his position in the street. Which is all you have. That’s what makes it feel so important, that’s what makes it feel so good— that pressure on you to be the best. Or to try to be the best. To develop a new style nobody can deal with. If it’s true that this stuff reflects life, it’s a fast life.\n\nThe Village Voice / April 22, 1981\n\nAfrika Bambaataa’s Hip-Hop\n\nSTEVEN HAGER\n\nNever one to let Black History Month slip by without commemoration, Afrika Bambaataa held his third annual party celebrating the occasion on February 25, 1982. As usual, the festivities were staged at the Bronx River Community Center, a squat, fortresslike structure located in the heart of the southeast Bronx. An impressive list of prominent rappers, DJs, and MC groups, including Kool Here, Grandmaster Flash, the Treacherous Three, Grand Wizard Theodor, and the Cold Crush 4, had promised to drop by and perform. The concert was free, and like most rap music extravaganzas, it was expected to be a loose, informal, and unpredictable affair. For this reason, few audience members would have been shocked if many of the advertised performers failed to appear—which, in fact, is exactly what happened. Around noon, a sound system was installed in the center’s gymnasium, and a few hours later dance music began blasting out of a pair of five-foot speaker columns. Almost immediately a smattering of young black males began drifting into the gym, most of whom lounged against a back wall and stared at the stage.\n\nIt would be difficult to designate a precise moment when the concert officially began. It’s fairly easy however, to pinpoint the moment the concert first stopped. That happened at 7:15, shortly after a gun fight broke out just outside the center’s main entrance. The shots sounded surprisingly innocuous—like a string of firecrackers, said one observer—and most of the audience never heard them because they were dancing to I Want You Back by the Jackson Five. It didn’t take long, however, for news of the fight to reach every corner of the gym, causing the crowd to grow restless and uneasy The mere sight of a revolver at an event like this is usually enough to send everyone stampeding for the exits, in which case the show would be over.\n\nNo one knew exactly what had happened but a lot of wild rumors were spreading. Everyone’s worst fears"
