        "text": "Stanley Nelson might not be a household name, but few individuals can rival the significant role he has played in teaching Americans about our own past. Over the past thirty years, millions have seen his prize-winning documentaries which, collectively, tell the story of African American life in the twentieth century: he has made films about Marcus Garvey, the civil-rights movement, the Black Panthers, the history of Black journalists and entrepreneurs, and the complicated lives of Miles Davis and Michael Vick. In 2021, he and Traci Curry co-directed “Attica,” a bracing exploration of the 1971 takeover of an upstate New York prison by inmates demanding humane living conditions. Nelson received a Directors Guild of America Award for “Attica,” and it has been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.\n\nNelson was born in New York City in 1951, as the second of four children. His father was a dentist, who also taught at New York University; his mother was a librarian. The Nelsons were part of an emergent Black middle class. He attended the New Lincoln School, a progressive private school in Manhattan. His family spent summers in Oak Bluffs, an African American enclave of Martha’s Vineyard. It was there that he began dabbling with film, making Super 8 home movies of their summer vacations.\n\nHe spent time at various colleges in the early seventies before deciding to study film. In 1976, he graduated from the City College of New York and talked his way into an entry-level job with the pioneering Black filmmaker and producer William Greaves. Greaves sent Nelson to work on various documentary shoots that the young apprentice felt wholly unqualified for. Nelson had intended to make feature films. But he slowly mastered the craft of vérité storytelling. In 1987, he wrote and produced “Two Dollars and a Dream: The Story of Madame C. J. Walker,” a documentary about the vast empire that Walker built by providing beauty products to African American women. Over the succeeding decades, Nelson continued telling stories about the struggles and triumphs that defined African American history—a history with which he was intimately familiar. One of his most moving films remains “A Place of Our Own,” from 2004. Combining penetrating interviews with his father, poetic meditations on the Black bourgeoisie, and his old Super 8 footage from the sixties, the documentary is an essayistic excavation of his family’s fraught history, as well as the enduring symbolism of their family home in Oak Bluffs.\n\nIn 2002, Nelson received a MacArthur “genius” grant. Inspired by Greaves, he has used his own successes to create opportunities for others, primarily through his work with Firelight Media, a nonprofit that he and his wife, Marcia Smith, launched in order to provide support for documentary filmmakers of color. One of the films competing with “Attica” for this year’s Oscar for Best Documentary Feature is Jessica Kingdon’s “Ascension,” which took shape as part of Firelight’s Documentary Lab fellowship program.\n\nOther than “A Place of Our Own,” Nelson doesn’t consider his films to be personal. Yet, his works, such as his retelling of Emmett Till’s murder and his chronicling of the Attica uprising, manage to uncover small, sometimes forgotten, spaces of hope in the American past. These are the spaces where the presence of Nelson the storyteller can be felt. From the 1619 Project to debates around critical race theory, the current political climate seems particularly inhospitable to deep engagements with history. “It’s important that we know our history,” he explained to me, “so that we understand how we got to this moment. We’ve gotta keep fighting.” He spoke from his home in Harlem. This interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nYou were twenty when the inmates at Attica took over the prison. What memories do you have of the events unfolding?\n\nIt was headline news that the prisoners had taken over Attica, and, because they had taken hostages, law enforcement was not coming in. I remember the kind of sinking feeling when [the authorities] retook the prison, and the leaking out of how many people died.\n\nFor later generations, the uprisings at Attica became a symbol of the horrors of American prisons and the inequalities baked into the criminal-justice system. Did people understand it that way at the time? Or were people tuning in mostly because of how wildly unprecedented and possibly frightening it was?\n\nAt the time, we saw the racial makeup of the prisoners. It was obvious that they were mostly Black. We never thought that they were gonna get out and wreak havoc on the general public. It was more that this was an isolated, strange incident, with the suspense of what was gonna happen. The way it ended up was totally surprising to people. . . . Everybody thought it would be negotiated to an end or they would somehow retake the prison in a more peaceful manner. I don’t think anybody thought forty-some-odd people were gonna be murdered inside the prison.\n\nYou grew up in the fifties and sixties, and a lot of your documentary work reflects on moments that you experienced as a young person just going about day-to-day life—the struggle for civil rights, the rise of Black Power, Attica. Were you aware at the time that you were living through such an unusual stretch of history?\n\nI was aware that these were historic times. In some weird way, all times are historic. But I remember coming home from school, at thirteen and fourteen, you know, and it would be on TV during the day—the dogs and the hoses, the marches and the speeches. And, with the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, you couldn’t help but realize that there was something different about that time. It was an awareness of how divided this country was. There were some positive outcomes, sure. But, you know, the signing of the Voting Rights Act took five minutes. It followed years of struggle.\n\nBefore pursuing film, you went on a bit of a circuitous path after high school.\n\nI graduated from high school in 1969. It was a tumultuous year. The Vietnam War was on. Even back in 1966, I think, people didn’t know. They were, like, O.K., I’m drafted, I’ll serve my country. I was very lucky ’cause, by 1969, we realized that the war was literally Hell and that we didn’t want to go. So, college at first was a safe haven. It was harder to get drafted. And I had gone to private schools, so everybody in my class went to college.\n\nBut when I got to college I didn’t know why I was there. I did not really think about what I was gonna do. It’s hard for anybody who wasn’t around at that time to understand, but so many people felt that the world was not going to be the same—that there was a real revolution going on, and that the result of this revolution would be a changed world. If you had told me that, in 2022, there would still be guys wearing suits and ties and wing-tip shoes running the government, I would’ve said, “No, you’re crazy—the whole world is gonna change, and it’s not gonna be that way.”\n\nSo eventually you did start taking film courses.\n\nI was interested in films about African Americans, and ways that we could make films that were not about, you know, “pimps and whores,” which were the films coming out of the blaxploitation movement. My father’s a dentist, my mother’s a librarian, that was not the world that I knew. I felt that there was a lot of room to make fiction films about the world that I knew, the world that most African Americans knew.\n\nIn film school, we started watching a lot of foreign films. I got a job at the City College newspaper as the movie reviewer, so I could go into any theatre I wanted to review films. I would write that, you know, just maybe, the Japanese films, the Italian films have as much to do with our lives as African Americans as the Hollywood films. I was very moved by them.\n\nA friend and I were walking down Broadway at 108th Street at nine-thirty one night. There was a dollar theatre and it was showing “The Murder of Fred Hampton.” For some reason, we went up to the box office—the guy was packing up ’cause the movie had already started—and we said, “Hey, we wanna see this movie. . . . Can we just go in? We don’t have a dollar.” And he was, like, “O.K.” So we went in and saw “The Murder of Fred Hampton.” It was a documentary, but it had an attitude. It was not a narrator saying, “There’s the Black Panthers, and there’s the police, and they both have opinions. . . .” It was not that. It was “This guy was murdered by the vicious police.” I was, like, Whoa, film can do that? It opened my head and it was just accidental that I walked into this theatre.\n\nHow aware were you of Fred Hampton prior to this?\n\nI knew about Fred Hampton. The same friend of mine, we were in high school together, and we went to the Black Panther office in Harlem. We stood across the street and watched the people going in and out, and we were, like, [laughs] “Uh, nope.”\n\nSo you were intrigued, but you weren’t . . .\n\nI was, like, I don’t think I’m ready. The Black Panthers were a 24/7 kind of thing. It wasn’t like you went there after work. And, by that time, they were under siege. But we admired the Panthers because they were younger, they were a Northern movement, they were talking about things we were concerned about. The civil-rights movement was a Southern movement. For a lot of people in my generation, it kind of felt like nonviolence had gone as far as it could go. And the [civil-rights] movement was led by suit-and-tie-wearing preachers. We were headed in a different way.\n\nAfter you graduated film school, you wound up working with William Greaves, the pioneering African American filmmaker and producer. How did that come about?\n\nI was looking around for a job after I got out of college. There was a production book that had all the production companies. I was just going through it, knocking on doors, asking for a job. People would look at me like I was nuts. They’re not gonna hire this Black guy, you know?\n\nI called my mother from a phone booth because I wanted to go over to her house to get a free meal after a day of looking for jobs. And she says, “You know, I’m looking at this article in the New York Post about this Black filmmaker—you should go knock on his door.” And it had his address, and his address was, like, across the street from the phone booth.\n\nSo I went over to Bill’s office. I said, I’m just out of film school, I’m looking for a job. And he said, “No, no, no, I can’t hire you.” And I said, “Wait a minute! There’s this program called CETA. CETA will pay me and you don’t have to pay me for six months, you know?” [The Comprehensive Employment and Training Act was a jobs-training act that grew out of the Works Progress Administration; at the time that Nelson was searching for work, CETA subsidized apprenticeships for people interested in community-focussed jobs in the arts.] And that’s how I got the job.\n\nI remember when I saw Greaves’s “Symbiopsychotaxiplasm.” I was just thinking . . . I did not know you were allowed to do this. What did you learn from him?\n\nI learned a lot just by him throwing me in. Bill knew how to edit—he would shoot some of his films himself. You had to really immerse yourself in it, and the more things you learned to do, the better.\n\nHe was a Black man—like, maybe the only African American man in the country—who had his own production company. He had an office on Fifty-Seventh and Broadway, and he had a house in the country. He was an African American man who was raising a family—he and his wife had two daughters—and making it work. I saw how hard he had to work and how invested in this thing he had to be. I learned so much about what you need to do to make films and to keep it going.\n\nIt sounds like what he taught you wasn’t just technical, like how to make something, but also how to build something sustainable and provide opportunities for others.\n\nYeah. I mean, Bill provided a ton of opportunities for a whole generation of African American filmmakers because he was the only one. This program, CETA, gave me my entry into the business. And these programs have disappeared. That’s one of the reasons we founded Firelight Media and the Documentary Lab. We’re really proud of the work we’ve done with other filmmakers. “Ascension” is a film that came out of the lab. It’s totally nuts.\n\nWhen I’m scrolling through Netflix and I’m looking for something to watch, there’s just so many documentaries. As a viewer, there’s an impression that now is a very good time to be a documentary filmmaker because there seems to be an insatiable appetite for nonfiction stories. Is this also how you’re experiencing it as a filmmaker, or through your work at Firelight?\n\nPeople call it the golden age of documentaries. It’s the golden age for some. It’s a good time for me because I’ve been making docs for a long time and I’m established. But we’ve had filmmakers in the Doc Lab who’ve won Peabodys and duPonts, and they have problems getting through the door to talk about their second or third films. Especially for people of color, it’s thought that you were lucky that you found one really good story. Documentary filmmaking has become much more of a business, and so many of the streamers and networks are looking for a guaranteed return. They’re not ready or willing to take the risk of a second- or third-time filmmaker. We actually started a thing called the William Greaves Fund to help people make their second or third films.\n\nYour career has revolved around centering the Black experience in American history, often by looking at moments that you witnessed firsthand. As you’ve developed your craft as a documentary filmmaker, I’m wondering how closely your films mirror your own experience of an event, the way you learned about things as they were happening.\n\nI’ve been fortunate enough and honored enough to tell these big stories. And I feel like what I’m trying to do is not have the story be about me but have the story just be about the story. Many of the stories that we’ve done end on a very hopeful note. “The Murder of Emmett Till” ends on them standing up to the powers that be in Mississippi. “Freedom Riders” ends with the changing of the laws. “Freedom Summer” ends with the Voting Rights Act.\n\nI actually thought “Jonestown” ended on a hopeful note, too. One of the last voices is of a survivor of the massacre reflecting on how, in the beginning, they tried something positive. And in “Attica” there’s a sense that the inmates, too, were trying to do something.\n\nYeah, I think that both films started with something very positive. When we screen “Attica,” you know, I talk to the audience about how the ending is so devastating. But don’t forget, the first day of Attica, as the former prisoners talk about the exuberance in the yard—don’t forget that’s part of it. These men, the most powerless of the powerless . . . they took over the prison because they wanted to make a change.\n\nThat’s one of the reasons why we were so interested in Jonestown. We heard a radio broadcast on NPR on one of the anniversaries. The former members who had survived were talking about what they had been trying to build, and the love, and they were talking about how wonderful it was, and how they had tried. That’s one of the reasons why we started looking at Jonestown, because it was so different from how it’s remembered in history as these nine hundred crazy people who committed suicide.\n\nYour films generally don’t rely on omniscient narration. I’m curious about your approach as an interviewer. A lot of pressure falls on people saying things you can use. How much of the film is taking shape as you are listening to someone talk? Are you kind of fixated on what they’re saying? Are you thinking about how some phrase might resonate with something someone else said last week? [The interviews for “Attica” were conducted by the film’s co-director, Traci Curry.]\n\nAll of that, and also, What am I gonna have for lunch? [Laughs.] I find interviewing to be really, really exhausting. At the end of a day of interviewing, I’m exhausted. You’re thinking about what they’re saying, you’re thinking about how it’s gonna fit into the film. You’re thinking about the person that is in front of you: Are they comfortable? How do you read their eyes and their body movement? My mind has to work on three or four different levels. How is this gonna cut in?\n\nWhen I did “Jonestown,” we interviewed a guy who was one of the survivors. He saw his whole family die. And, when we were interviewing, you know, I started at the beginning, the day he joined. And, um, it was really bad. He was not a good interview. And then, when I asked him to talk about the day, you know, like, what happened on that day, he nailed it. Because he was waiting to talk about that. I felt like I should have realized that. I should have gone to that first. It’s a part of what’s going on in the room. Read the person, understand the emotions that are going on there. You’re trying to think about so many things at the same time.\n\nYou mention these pockets of hope that you always find in the past. Does that influence your view of everyday life today, the historic moments we find ourselves in now? That there’s always some sort of joy to hold onto, there’s always some reason to look at the broader time line of history?\n\nThere’s always hope. Look, life is good. We’re alive and we can push for change. Young people know that there’s something wrong. They just don’t know how to fix it. I think most people have to understand that the civil-rights movement was not made up of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcolm X—it was made up of the people that were walking behind them. When I was growing up, you know, it was, like, “What are you doing Saturday? Oh, you’re going to a march? O.K., I’ll go, too.” I think that’s happening again. I have three kids and they were all involved in the George Floyd protests."
