        "text": "As a multitalented creative force, equally adept at absurdist comedy and soul-searching drama, Tim Blake Nelson carved out a successful career as a writer, director and accomplished actor. Despite years spent struggling to find his footing on screen, Nelson was a successful playwright and stage performer, earning awards and critical acclaim for his work, including \"Eye of God\" and \"The Grey Zone.\" He began to make strides on television in sketch comedy shows like \"The Unnaturals\" (HA!-CTV, 1990-92) and \"Hardcore TV\" (HBO, 1993), but ultimately steered himself towards features. It was not until his breakout performance playing a doltish escaped convict in \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" (2000) that he finally began to gain proper notice. He earned praise all around for directing a film version of \"The Grey Zone,\" a unique look at the Holocaust as seen through the eyes of Jews who helped the Nazis. Alternating small indie films with higher-profile supporting roles in films ranging from political thriller \"Syriana\" (2005) and Steven Spielberg historical epic \"Lincoln\" (2012) to superhero flops \"The Incredible Hulk\" (2008) and \"Fantastic Four\" (2015), Nelson also worked steadily on TV, co-starring in short-lived comedy drama \"CHAOS\" (CBS 2011) and miniseries \"Klondike\" (Discovery 2014) and appearing in an arc on \"The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\" (Netflix 2015- )."
