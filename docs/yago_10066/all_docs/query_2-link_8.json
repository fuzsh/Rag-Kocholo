        "text": "History has focused on Henry Aaron in recent decades, and rightfully so. As one of the true immortals of the game, his dignity and courage in the face of racism and long odds should be celebrated. Aaron was able to break the most sacrosanct record in sports despite the ill wishes (including death threats) of thousands of people, sadly.\n\nYet, in this tide of history, Willie Mays and what he really meant to baseball has grown fuzzy, even forgotten.

When baseball was King. The National Sport. When every little kid woke up, got the sports section in the newspaper and poured over the box scores from the night before. I would guess papers don't even carry these anymore because you have the internet. That was my religion. I knew every player's batting average, home runs and pitcher's won loss record and era.

The man himself is still so full of charisma and offers great insight to his life and career, along with many other former players and media members and family and historians of the game. The stats speak for themselves about his greatness on the field, but perspective is everything, and his story is one that was tied to the Civil Rights movement and integration of baseball in important ways. Mays has always been one of \"the greats\" that I only knew because of his place in the record books. Seeing archival black and white game footage and interviews was wonderful, and walking…"
