        "text": "(AllHipHop News) Veteran author, cultural critic and filmmaker Nelson George will debut his new hip-hop themed documentary this weekend.\n\nNelson George is the director behind “A Great Day In Hip Hop Revisited,” which will make its world premiere at the 23rd Annual Urban World Film Festival.\n\nThe documentary centers around a legendary day in Harlem on September 29, 1998, when photographer Gordon Parks gathered hundreds of MCs, DJs, and dancers for the cover of XXL magazine.\n\nGordon Parks decided to recreate his classic 1959 photo, “A Great Day in Harlem, featuring jazz greats like Count Basie, Thelonius Monk, Dizzy Gillespie, and others.\n\nFor the hip-hop version, Gordon Parks gathered rappers like Schoolly D, Rakim, Russell Simmons, Fab 5 Freddy, A Tribe Called Quest, Slick Rick, Fat Joe, and others.\n\nOver 150 artists took their picture in front of the same building as the Jazz greats in Harlem on 126th Street, between Fifth and Madison Avenues.\n\nThe premiere of “A Great Day In Hip Hop Revisited” is one of 78 official selections and 7 spotlight titles that will be highlighted during the 23rd Annual Urban World Film Festival.\n\n“Each year we strive to expand our programming slate to expose stories, themes, and characters that have been under-represented in our world. This year is no exception,” said Gabrielle Glore, Festival Director & Head of Programming, Urbanworld Film Festival.\n\n“What is most exciting to see is the continued elevation of quality manifested across our content creators’ work, as we celebrate their creativity and craft,” Gabrielle Glore added."
