        "text": "The changing face of Black film has been a roller coaster too fast to keep up with. There are outliers within cinematic history, but when looking at a successful period of movies that centered on the Black experience, one can look to the 1990s.\n\nIn the ’90s, there were pockets of success that fueled optimism Hollywood had made space for Black filmmakers to tell their specific stories involving life on the streets and what it’s like to be Black and live amongst violence and poverty. Some of the titles that reflect this era of film include Juice, Boyz n the Hood, Menace II Society, Above the Rim and South Central among many more. These films became a success in the U.S.; even thought they they were produced for relatively small amounts of money, they often made over their budgets. While not marketed much overseas, the movies still had enormous impact on Black and cinematic culture.\n\nThe popularity and mainstream feel seemed to fade out after the release of Hype Williams’ 1999 film Belly. Sure, the early 2000s produced some hits like Baby Boy, ATL and Paid in Full, but the decade didn’t produce the type of films that reached broader audiences. The question: Did those types of movies see a decline, or did they grow out of favor with studios and audiences? With the decision-makers at the time overwhelmingly white and male (unlike now, with more people of color in executive roles), there was no one around to advocate for these films the way folks would do now.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe current changing society has put the onus on studios to embrace diversity and inclusion, which again has created numerous success stories. However, the narrative of these films has changed. How do we make the state of intersectionality in cinema permanent?\n\nThese are the questions asked on our Deadline panel: Scene 2 Seen Presents: The Past, Present and Future of Black Cinema.\n\nFor this discussion, I’ve assembled a panel of filmmakers and critics who can speak to the time period:\n\nAllen Hughes’ major leap into the entertainment industry came with his and twin brother Albert’s jolting debut as the 20-year-old creators-directors of Menace II Society. His other films with Albert include Dead President, From Hell and The Book of Eli, along with documentaries American Pimp and The Defiant Ones, the latter the stories of Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre. Allen is currently directing and exec producing with Nelson George Dear Mama, a definitive, comprehensive five-part documentary series on the late hip-hop icon Tupac Shakur and his mother/activist Afeni Shakur. They have the full cooperation of the Shakur estate including access to all of his music and poetry.\n\nCheryl Dunye is a renowned director, writer and producer who first emerged as part of the Queer New Wave of young filmmakers in the early ’90s with her first feature film The Watermelon Woman, winning the Teddy Award for Best Feature at the 1996 Berlin Film Festival. The film, now considered a classic, was recently inducted into the Library of Congress’ National Film Registry and resides in the permanent cinema collection at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Dunye is more recently known for her directing work on OWN’s Queen Sugar and David Makes Man, Showtime’s The Chi, CBS’ All Rise and Netflix’s upcoming seasons of Umbrella Academy and Bridgerton. Outside of Watermelon Woman, she has written and directed a number of films including The Owls, Mommy Is Coming and Black Is Blue.\n\nNelson George is an author and filmmaker passionate about documenting African American life and culture. His connection to cinema started with an investment in Spike Lee’s debut film She’s Gotta Have It. Subsequently, he co-wrote the screenplays to the early ’90s feature films Strictly Business and CB4. George directed the HBO film Life Support starring Queen Latifah; the Lifetime movie The Real MVP; and the documentaries Brooklyn Boheme for Showtime, The Announcement for ESPN, Finding the Funk for VH1 and A Ballerina’s Tale about dancer Misty Copeland for IFC. In addition to Dear Mama he is working on a doc on baseball great Willie Mays for HBO."
