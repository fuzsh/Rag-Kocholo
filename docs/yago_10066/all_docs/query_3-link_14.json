        "text": "Nelson George is probably best known for his graceful and penetrating writing on African-American music and film. In the late '80s and early '90s, his \"Native Son\" column in the Village Voice was mandatory reading for anybody interested in the intersection between race relations, urban life and popular culture.\n\nBut George has done more than just write about art — he’s been a curator and producer, too. He recognized Spike Lee’s talent early and was one of the initial investors in \"She’s Gotta Have It,\" the director’s feature-length debut. \"Brooklyn Boheme,\" a documentary he wrote and narrated, aired on Showtime last year. The film chronicled the rise and triumph of the African-American arts scene in his beloved Fort Greene neighborhood — a scene in which he was an active participant.\n\nStarting Friday, George is turning his attention to our side of the river, and he comes bearing celluloid. A summer 2012 tour through the New Jersey Performing Arts Center convinced him that the Newark venue was the perfect location for a series devoted to concert films.\n\n\"I knew about shows there, but I’d never been there,\" says George, 55. \"I was knocked out by the facility. It’s an amazing place.\"\n\nThe series of documentaries, which begins tonight with a showing of the 1973 film \"Save the Children,\" will be hosted by George himself. All the movies will be shown in NJPAC’s Victoria Theater, and after each, George will host a panel discussion. Speakers will include radio personality and Newark activist Mtume, George Clinton, Melvin Van Peebles, Bill Charlap, Stanley Crouch and others selected to shed light on provocative subject matter. These are films that chronicle moments in the development of African-American music; each also explores the complex, evolving ways in which audiences interact with performers.\n\n\"So many young people have access to clips and downloads of older artists,\" says George, \"but they don't normally watch them on a big screen. This is a way where you can almost feel like you're seeing these performers in concert.\"\n\nBLAST FROM THE PAST\n\n\"Save the Children\" documented a massive charity show held to benefit the Black Exposition in Chicago, an event that brought together heads of black-owned businesses across the country. Organized by Jesse Jackson’s Operation PUSH, the concert featured (among others) the Jackson 5, Marvin Gaye, Nancy Wilson and Roberta Flack.\n\n\"Wattstax,\" which was released the same year, celebrates both the influential Stax label and the Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts, a center of African-American political and cultural ferment.\n\n\"Jazz on a Summer’s Day,\" a classic 1960 concert film, took viewers to the Newport Jazz Festival and captured performances by Thelonious Monk, Dinah Washington, Chuck Berry and Mahalia Jackson.\n\n\"Krush Groove,\" the definitive movie about ’80s hip-hop, caught the movement in the hours before it went mainstream.\n\n\"The penetration of hip-hop in our culture is something that we now take for granted,\" says George. \"But in ’85, at the time of ‘Krush Groove,’ it was still fighting to prove itself.\n\n\" ‘Krush Groove’ gives you the feeling of hip-hop at that time. For instance, the movie actually covers the Fat Boys. They’ve kind of fallen out of the official story of hip-hop, and people forget that they were a huge band. And it gives you Run-D.M.C. at the height of their powers.\"\n\n\"Wattstax,\" too, freezes a moment in time. The Watts neighborhood had become infamous as the cradle for the urban unrest that had swept across cities in the late ’60s. Watts rioted in ’65 — two years before the National Guard occupied the burning Springfield-Belmont neighborhood of Newark. But despite the negative associations, inner city Los Angeles became the seat of African-American musical culture in the early ’70s. Motown moved to L.A., \"Soul Train\" began filming and Hollywood was in the early stages of the Blaxploitation era. Black Southern California was in the midst of a renaissance, and \"Wattstax\" captures that energy.\n\n\"The film has a strong political subtext,\" says George. \"Actually, it’s not just subtext, it’s right there in the text. A lot of the most memorable footage isn’t even the concert. They shot around Los Angeles and South Central. It’s a great capsule look at where black culture was at the time.\"\n\nTHE REAL EXPERIENCE\n\n\"Jazz on a Summer’s Day\" is busy with big figures. Just about everybody at the 1958 Newport Festival was a heavyweight — including Louis Armstrong and his All-Stars, who were by then grand old lions of American popular entertainment.\n\nGeorge found himself compelled by the footage of Armstrong in the movie: He knew about Armstrong the public figure but had never seen Armstrong the musician in action. His fascination was not dissimilar to the thrill young viewers now get when they see musical heroes on YouTube for the first time.\n\n\"It’s a classic film not just because of the music,\" George says. \"It captures jazz right before the point when it was beginning to fracture. In the ’60s, jazz would get avant-garde, and that turned a lot of people off. But in 1958, it was still what you’d think of when you think of classic jazz.\"\n\nDespite the overwhelming talent onstage, the film is as much about the audience as it is about the musicians, George says. \"We take these big festivals for granted now. Newport was one of the first great concert experiences, and part of the film looks at that experience.\n\n\"How do people comport themselves at a concert series in the ’50s, before the rock revolution kicks in? It’s a document of the way we once consumed music.\"\n\nFor George, the film series is an opportunity to experience all these sounds with the power and color they were meant to have. On the big screen, jazz, soul, funk and early hip-hop approximate the gritty grandeur of live performance.\n\n\"We have a generation of people who’ve grown up listening to music through little white buds. It is really sad that somebody who had a good component set and was listening to vinyl in 1980 could be hearing music in higher fidelity than people do now. In many cases, people aren’t hearing the music at the same level of complexity.\n\n\"I’m hoping we get a nice mix of people who are older and remember these movies and these movements, and maybe we introduce a lot of young people to some great music, too.\"\n\nNelson George Film Series\n\nWhere: Victoria Theater at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center,\n\n1 Center St., Newark\n\nWhen: \"Save the Children\" Friday; \"Krush Groove,\" March 1; \"Wattstax,\" April 5; \"Jazz on a Summer's Day,\" May 10.
