Followed by an intimate conversation with featured performer and ballet legend Misty Copeland and executive producer Nelson George. Moderated by NYWIFT CEO Cynthia Lopez.  In homage to Black silent films of the 1920s, filmmaker Lauren Finerman directs a poignant story about a young woman named Rose (Misty Copeland), who has had to place her dreams on hold to care for her mother, Gloria (Christina Johnson), living with dementia. A potent subtext to the film is the housing affordability crisis that's devastated the Bay Area. As Rose struggles to keep a roof over their heads, she watches the neighborhood around her fade away much like her mother's memory, until the mysterious Sterling (Babatunji Johnson) helps to highlight the power of community and the strength found through unity, bringing Rose renewed hope for the future.",
