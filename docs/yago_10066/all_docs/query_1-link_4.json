        "text": "Reflections on HBO Film Life Support, starring Queen Latifah\n\nShowcasing Raw Realities\n\n“40 is my number, 50 is my name, if ya’ don’t believe me you can kiss my little…”\n\nAs the world turns, timeless films remain relevant. Specific scenes shape our perspective about life. Emmy Nominated film, Life Support released on HBO in 2007 during Pisces season. The film starred Queen Latifah (Ana), Tracee Ellis Ross (Tanya), Wendell Pierce (Slick), and other phenomenal African American actors and actresses.\n\nBrooklyn-Native Director & Writer, Nelson George, prophetically captures the rawness of Brownsville, Brooklyn, NY while filming Life Support. The lively streets of Brooklyn are not always nice, and George captures the essence through each character’s story.\n\nAs I researched, every article I read on “Life Support” was produced by a White writer. (African American Reporter Fred Brown did a news segment on the film and Life Force Inc.) A film with a majority Melanated cast should have articles written by Melanated writers.\n\nLife Support is loosely based on the true story of Andrea Williams, an HIV survivor, and an HIV/AIDS Outreach Worker in Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn, NY. According to Ms. Williams, “The movie is as close as to reality as you can get.”\n\nAna yearns to be in Kelly’s (Rachel Nicks) life due to her absence struggling with substance abuse. Throughout the film, Ana battles with watching Kelly grow up and resent her.\n\nIn one scene, Ana speaks on her youngest daughter Kim, being in gymnastics like Kelly, and Kelly snarly responds, “Mmhm, one class Mom, you forgot to pick me up.” Kelly often replies with snappy remarks, understanding this will hurt her mother’s feelings. Honestly, I can relate to Kelly not feeling understood while hurting. Kelly resents Ana because of the carelessness and neglect she endured as a child.\n\nAmare (Evan Ross) was my favorite character throughout the film. Amare struggled with his reality as a homosexual teenager diagnosed with HIV. As a 13-year-old Southern gay teenager, I fell in love with his character off-top. He became an LGBTQ representative for me.\n\nUnfortunately, Amare battled with depression and substance abuse.\n\nHis upbringing was far from a Manhattan Fairytale.\n\nKelly and Amare grew up in Brownsville, Brooklyn projects as childhood best friends. Their parents were addicted to shooting cocaine. As a child, Amare’s parents transitioned due to AIDS, and Kelly’s grandma stepped in when her mother dropped the ball. Essentially, Amare and Kelly only had each other.\n\nLet’s Kill The HIV/AIDS Stigma\n\nDisclaimer: Life Support was released in 2007. Certain terminology or statistics in the movie may be outdated or insensitive to the LGBTQ community and/or people living with HIV or AIDS.\n\n“We Struggle, and Not Only With the Virus, [But We Also] Struggle With the Government, We Struggle With Those Who Judge Us, We Struggle With Those Who Ignore Us, Who Fear Us, We Even Struggle With Those We Love…”\n\n— Ana, Life Support\n\nHIV is not a homosexual virus and AIDS is not a homosexual disease. Certain patriarchal celebrities insinuate otherwise, but we like facts over here. A person can come in contact with HIV through the exposure of blood, needle sharing, sexual intercourse, breastfeeding, etc. (Cdc.gov). With medication and a healthy lifestyle, a person affected by HIV can become undetectable.\n\nAccording to AIDS Foundation Houston, 59% of their clients living with HIV identify as heterosexual. In fact, Ana & Slim were heterosexual and so were Amare’s parents.\n\nNationwide, there are 1 in 7 people living with HIV that are unaware (AFH, 2020). Statements such as, “My man don’t like wearing jimmy hats”, can discourage us from protecting ourselves to please our partner. Ain’t nothing scarier than going to get tested after raw doggin’ in these streets, but I digress.\n\nPeople living with HIV or AIDS can face the unbearable. Contrary to popular belief, “There is no look.” Furthermore, a person living with HIV/AIDS may be uncomfortable telling their partner about their sexual health due to their reaction.\n\nFor instance, Ana encouraged a pregnant client to confess to her husband that she was HIV positive, and when she did, he murdered her. Although honesty is the best policy, so is your safety.\n\nI often thought of Amare and his need for a support system where he could truly be himself. Organizations such as The Normal Anomaly (based in Houston, TX), and AIDS Foundation Houston provide support, resources, and a platform for the LGBTQIA+ community and people living with HIV/AIDS.\n\nFamily and Friendships are not Perfect\n\nLife Support will take you on a journey and remind you that we are all flawed. We all ‘eff up in this lifetime. I strive for accountability, change, and forward movement, but how many times do I fall short?\n\nAmari’s parents were emotionally unavailable and battled with their own demons. His older sister, Tanya, recalls childhood moments of “having to steal shit,” just to survive in their environment. Amare never forgave his parents, therefore he never healed from the pain caused by them. Instead, his pain spiraled into promiscuous lust with a down-low married man (with children) and addictions.\n\nKelly held on to her childhood pain as well, which reflected in her conversations with Ana, “I ain’t da’ one that gave you da’ virus Ma’, go get with Slick on that!”\n\nChildren who experience childhood trauma can have major mental health risk factors, which can offset depression, suicidality, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and aggressive behavior.\n\nPlease reach out to culturally competent community-based organizations in your area if you feel alone, ill, or threatened."
