Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has been married to his wife Tana for 25 years. Check out photos of the couple from throughout their marriage here.

Gordon Ramsay may be well-known for his culinary skills, but the celebrity chef also has a tender relationship with his wife of 25 years Tana Ramsay. The ‘Hell’s Kitchen’ star and his wife first met at a New Year’s Eve party, when Tana was engaged to another man. It definitely wasn’t love at first sight, but the future star chef would grow on her when he started to store his motorcycle at a flat she shared with a friend of his. The couple eventually got married in December 1996.

Even though Gordon is usually in the spotlight, Tana has shown off some of her own cooking skills. She’s the author of five cookbooks. She’s also appeared on some of Gordon’s shows and even had a brief run on the British reality show Dancing On Ice.

Throughout their quarter-of-a-century together, Tana and Gordon have had five kids: Megan, 23, Holly, 21, Jack, 21, Matilda, 19, and Oscar, 2. Despite having a big happy family, Tana has been open about suffering from a miscarriage in 2016.
