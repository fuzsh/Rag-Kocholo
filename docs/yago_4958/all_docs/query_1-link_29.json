        "text": "The way most women feel about Tana Ramsay depends largely upon how they feel about her husband, Gordon. If you're one of those who thinks that the chef is a sexist, foulmouthed bully with a wonky face and silly hair, she probably has your deepest sympathy. But you may be in the minority. The terrible truth is that many women find Ramsay oddly attractive, even if they can't quite explain why. These women are doubtless rather envious of poor Tana - and are likely to grow more so when they read her new book, Tana Ramsay's Family Kitchen. It's one of those sleek volumes that seems to offer up not only recipes, but a whole lifestyle. On the cover, Mrs Ramsay looks healthy and happy - a smiley cheerleader for a certain brand of four-wheel-drive domesticity. Inside, it's worse. Look at her children, all four of them, as cute as candy - not to mention their colourful after-Boden wellies, their cosy duffle coats, their adorable little knitted sweaters. In most of the pictures, they appear to be rushing round the kitchen making just the right amount of mess with Mummy's cake mixture. Oh dear. It all looks intimidatingly perfect.\n\nMention this to Tana, and she shudders at the thought. When she first started writing recipes for a weekly magazine, the impulse was: 'If I can do it, anyone can.' And now that she has written a book, nothing has changed. The last thing she wants is to present herself as a vision of perfection. 'I wanted to simplify everything right down,' she says. 'The recipes come from me and my mum, from friends and family, not some home economist. That's because I was determined that it should be real, that it be full of things that people can actually do. I wasn't at all interested in telling people the ideal.' She is not, she is keen to point out, what you might call a foodie. You will not find her poaching quails' eggs of an evening - though, of course, like anyone, she loves to eat out. In fact, before she had children, when Gordon was working late in his kitchen, she barely cooked at all. 'Girls can survive on a slice of toast when they're on their own, can't they?' she says. 'Or whatever's in the fridge. I only began to get interested after my children were born. Suddenly, it was important to me - what I was putting in their mouths. Then, when I started writing things down, I realised that I knew a lot more than I first thought.'\n\nHer book is divided into sections, from breakfast to store cupboard to party food. The recipes are healthy without being too pious, and designed with the chaos of children in mind (cups of soup for cold days, ice cream for hot; there is even a recipe for play dough). None of them requires hours of preparation. But Tana's own favourites are those she can serve the children at tea time, and then adjust for Gordon and herself later: yes, she does cook for them both, and presumably puts up with any stick that may come her way. Gordon has, she says, been completely supportive about the book, for all that he likes to joke about how it isn't cooking at all (ask him about her book, and he'll make inverted comma signs in the air). Does she fear other people will say that she is just cashing in on his name? She's quite straightforward about this. 'I'd be stupid if I thought that Gordon wasn't the reason I'd been asked to do it. But I can either dwell on that, and worry what people are going to say, or I can get on with it.'\n\nThe Ramsays live in a house of embassy proportions in Wandsworth, southwest London: you may have seen it on the telly (it looms large in Gordon's Channel 4 series, The F-Word; in series one, he kept chickens in its football pitch-sized back garden, and in series two, some pigs). The legend goes that the kitchen upstairs - which cost some £500,000 to install and features a professional oven - is Gordon's domain, with Tana confined to 'an MFI job' deep in the basement. This, she tells me, is a myth. She uses the main kitchen too, and, in fact, there are gadgets that Gordon has no idea how to use, including the coffee machine. Mention his fondness for slagging off the kitchen skills of women (his favourite moan is that most of us can't, or won't, cook), and she rolls her eyes. 'He does it to get a rise out of people,' she says. 'React, and you're giving him the response he's after. You're egging him on. The other night, we were at a party. He was talking to two women. I could see it in their eyes: they had no idea how to take him. Afterwards, I heard one of them say to the other: \"He must be on coke or something to get that worked up\".'\n\nIn person, Tana is very pretty, very brown and very slim (a runner, her greatest luxury is to pound the streets). Hard not to feel like a blob in her presence. But the over-riding impression she leaves is of her loyalty to her husband. No sooner has she had a critical thought about him, than she is berating herself out loud for her selfishness. The two of them, however, could not be more different - or at least, could not be from more different backgrounds. While Gordon grew up mostly on council estates, and suffered at the hands of his abusive father, Tana's childhood sounds to have been idyllic. Her father was a successful businessman (these days, he is the CEO of Gordon Ramsay Holdings), and she and her siblings grew up on a Kent farm within commuting distance of London, where he worked during the week. Her mother kept chickens and sheep. 'We didn't care about things like clothes,' she says. 'I was a real tomboy. It was amazing. We'd clear out of the door at nine o'clock in the morning, and didn't come back until we were hungry. With my own children, I'm obsessed with knowing where they are, who they're with. You have to be. But it's so sad.'\n\nBy the time she was 17, the family had moved back to London. She took A-levels at Holland Park comprehensive, and then worked for her father before training to be a Montessori teacher. She met Gordon when she was in her early twenties; she was living with a friend of his, Tim, a sous chef at Le Pont de la Tour. Gordon used to keep his motorbike at Tim's flat in Butler's Wharf and, one night, when he went to pick up the key, it was Tana rather than Tim who answered the door. Tim was away; by this point, his and Tana's relationship was pretty much over. Gordon seized his moment. They talked all night and, as the dawn broke, he took her out on his bike.\n\nThey've been a couple ever since (they married in a Chelsea church in 1998, when she was just 21) - though she was cautious at first. 'When he asked me to go and visit him in the South of France, where he was working, I said: \"Ask me again in the morning.\" I wasn't about to make decisions on the spur of the moment. I'd only just split up with Tim. And when I did go to France, nothing happened.' So she was a good girl? 'I was a very good girl.'\n\nShe spent much of her courtship completely exhausted, but not at all for salacious reasons. 'I would work, come home, sleep, and wake up again when Gordon finished work. We'd meet up in the small hours. That was the only way we could be together, and we really wanted to be together.' It was a strange, nocturnal life. But even now, she will always drink tea with him when he gets home at 2am. Apparently, Gordon rarely travels with a front-door key.\n\nTheir early married life was not particularly easy. For one thing, she struggled to become pregnant. 'I suffer from polycystic ovaries, and Gordon has a low sperm count, which is probably down to the kitchen - the hours, the stress, the heat. So we had IVF, which made me feel like a complete failure.' Then, no sooner had she got pregnant (Megan was born in 1998) than Gordon suffered a crisis at work. Unhappy and in dispute with the restaurant group which ran his Michelin-starred restaurant, Aubergine, he was desperate to start again on his own. The only trouble with this plan was that it necessitated the Ramsays selling their house and moving back into rented accommodation. 'It was a hard time, quite uncertain. I do remember that he was worried about telling me. He wanted to protect me, but my attitude was: no, talk to me. It was a question of sorting out our priorities. What was more important: the short term, or the long term? Our security, or his unhappiness? What was very clear was that things couldn't continue as they were.\n\n'The thing is, he was never someone who made me feel as though he couldn't handle it. That's one of the things that I love about him. He's so capable, and that can make you feel amazing. I never saw him as a risk. Gordon has always made me feel so safe. He's physically very big, so when he puts his arms around you, you do feel safe. If I call him at work, the first thing he'll say is: \"What's the matter?\" The second thing will be: \"Don't worry.\" It's hugely comforting. When he says something, he means it. So, yes, we talked late into the night but never once did he make me feel scared. I want to see him fulfilled. There's nothing worse than seeing someone you love unfulfilled. A life full of regret would be terrible.' She thinks for a minute, and then says: 'Those cars of his [he is keen on flash cars]. I hate those things, but if he wants to buy a new one, bugger it. If that's what he wants. I think they're the biggest waste of money, they make so much noise and attract so much attention, and his driving scares me to death; I sit there with my feet pressed to the floor. But it would be really selfish of me to say no.'\n\nDid she always believe that he would be a success? (According to one recent report, the Ramsay name is worth more than £60 million; he is also in possession of more Michelin stars than any other British chef.) 'I hoped. Especially when we were living in a tiny rented flat, and I was expecting twins.' The twins - she found out that she was expecting Jack and Holly when Megan was just 11 months old - were not a total surprise; she had been having more IVF, after all, and there are twins in her family. Their imminent arrival, however, seemed to galvanise her husband into working even harder.\n\nMeanwhile, she spent the next nine months covered in bruises because she suffers from a blood disorder which meant that, during pregnancy, she had to inject herself twice a day if she was to avoid blood clots. But Matilda, who was born in 2002, was a surprise, and was conceived without outside help. 'I was so happy. I felt: I can do it. I did this by myself.'\n\nRamsay is on the record as saying that he would like a fifth child, but she is not keen. 'I already find it hard to split myself evenly between them. They're all so different. Megan is very sensitive, Holly and I tend to lock horns. I don't think I would have the patience to have another one, and also I'm not very good with babies. I love this stage - talking to them, and jumping in the car and taking them to Cornwall. They can all do everything now. I couldn't handle taking them all out and having to leave a baby at home with a nanny.' She prefers to be a nanny-free zone. 'Gordon will accuse me of being disorganised. But I think I'm quite organised. I run this house. Four children. I work. The difference between us is that he's good at delegating. If he asks me to do a job, even though I know that there are at least four people I could pass it on to, I don't. I want to do everything. That's especially true with the children. I have this idea that there are some things only I can do.'\n\nBut how does she feel about the impact of Gordon's fame on their children? They feature prominently in her book, and have also appeared in The F-Word, chasing chickens and bathing prize pigs. 'It went against everything I thought I'd do when I got them involved in The F-Word. But I'm very proud of them, and it has meant that they've seen more of Gordon than ever. It's also given them an understanding of what his life's about. So I'm pleased.\n\n'I had various rumblings from school - that they should have taken off uniforms so the school couldn't be recognised. I'm sorry about that. The trouble was no one came to me and said so; it was just gossip. Of course I worry that they could come in for criticism, but they've had a great time, and Gordon has loved having them along.'\n\nDoesn't she worry it will turn their heads? 'Well, I'm incredibly strict with them. I think Gordon's mum thinks I can be too harsh. I'm harder on my kids than a lot of people, but I have to be. If anyone heard me, they'd take them away. I have smacked bottoms. They've been warned, so I've had to carry out threats. When Gordon and I go away, just the two of us, to the Maldives, [the couple do this every year] I remember all the things I've said, and I think: how could I? But I want them to be independent, and Gordon wants them to have that hunger in life. Is that a bad thing?'\n\nWhich brings us back - again - to Gordon. Outsiders will wonder how she continues to put up with a man who not only spends so much time away from home (he is about to open a restaurant in New York), but who seems to take such horrible pride in making misogynistic pronouncements (women at work, he once said, are always taking time off for 'morning sickness and women's troubles'; childbirth is like being 'stuck in a room with a thousand skinned rabbits', which is one reason why he was not present at the birth of any of his children; he has even had a go at the mothers standing outside the gates of his children's school ('Tight top, hair pulled back, tracksuit bottoms pulled up so tight that you can see the pig's trotters').\n\nShe sighs. Other women often try to sympathise with the fact that she lives with a man who makes a big deal out of the fact that he's never changed nappies, or done the school run. But she seems not to give a fig. In her way, perhaps she is as old-fashioned as the man she married. That, or she knows better than to rock the boat. 'I think: what's the big deal? It works for them [having a hands-on husband], and I'm not criticising it. But it's not what I want. It's not my style. I can manage, and I always have.'"
