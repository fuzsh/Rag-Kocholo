        "text": "It's a boy for \"Hell's Kitchen\" and \"Masterchef\" star Gordon Ramsay!\n\nThe celebrity chef, 52, announced on Instagram Thursday that he and wife Tana Ramsay, 44, had welcomed their newest bundle of joy earlier that afternoon. He shared multiple photos from the hospital, showing Mom, Dad and the baby looking happy and healthy.\n\nAnd the couple had the cutest way of announcing his name.\n\n\"After 3 baftas and one Emmy... finally we have won an Oscar, please welcome Oscar James Ramsay.\"\n\nThough the baby just arrived, he already has his own Instagram account. Ramsay tagged @oscarjramsay in his announcement post. No photos from the newborn yet, though his profile picture is a shot with Gordon and Tana.\n\nOscar is the fifth child for the Ramsays, who have been married since 1996. He joins Meghan, 20, twins Jack and Holly, 19, and Matilda, 17.\n\nThe good news comes just under three years after Ramsay revealed that Tana had had a miscarriage at five months.\n\n\"We're together healing as a family, but we want to thank everyone again for all your amazing support and well wishes. I'd especially like to send a big thank you to the amazing team at Portland Hospital for everything they've done,\" he wrote in 2016.\n\nREAD MORE"
