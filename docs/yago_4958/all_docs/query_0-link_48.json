        "text": "Gordon and Tana Ramsay celebrated their 27th wedding anniversary with some epic throwback snaps on Thursday.\n\nThe pair tied the knot on December 21, 1996 in Chelsea, London and their daughter Holly, 23, made sure to take a look at where it all began to mark the occasion.\n\nHolly posted one photo of Gordon, now 57, and Tana, now 49, on their wedding day, along with another showing the famous chef rocking some curtains and a striped suit, while Tana opted for a colourful leather jacket.\n\nA slightly more recent one showed Tana – who re-posted the images to her own Instagram account – in a silk dress, while the pair both went for all-black ensembles in a further shot.\n\nThe trip down memory lane came after Gordon and Tana announced they’d welcomed their sixth baby together last month.\n\nThe Hell’s Kitchen star shared some pictures from the hospital as they held their new bundle of joy.\n\nHe wrote: ‘What an amazing birthday present please welcome Jesse James Ramsay, 7lbs 10oz whopper!!\n\n‘One more bundle of love to the Ramsay brigade!! 3 boys, 3 girls…. Done,’ Gordon insisted.\n\nTana also shared the adorable family snaps with the latest addition.\n\nShe admitted: ‘It’s been a nerve wracking 9 months but we’ve made it and we have been blessed with this little bundle. Ramsay family definitely complete.\n\n‘Jesse James Ramsay we love you so much.’\n\nGordon and Tana already have Megan, 25, twins Holly and Jack, 23, Tilly, 22, and youngest son Oscar, four.\n\nThe baby announcement comes after Gordon spoke about having more kids on multiple occasions.\n\nHe admitted he was worried about having another child at his age earlier this year.\n\nGordon made the comments on the Dish podcast with Nick Grimshaw and Angela Hartnett, discussing the complication of the sheer number of children, joking they would need ‘two buses’ to go out to dinner or get to school.\n\n‘I’m going to be the oldest f****r at school,’ he complained.\n\n‘”Who’s your grandad?” And what about sports day, and the egg and spoon race? What am I going to do?’\n\nDespite all of this, he confessed he would ‘love another one’ but said at the time that ‘five is enough for now.’\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Gordon Ramsay to blame for Hugh Jackman’s sweaty hangover"
