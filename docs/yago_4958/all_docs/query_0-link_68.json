        "text": "Gordon Ramsay and his wife Tana Ramsay welcomed their sixth child into the world yesterday. The pair announced that the 49-year-old gave birth to a baby boy named Jesse James Ramsay on Saturday in an adorable joint post on social media.\n\nCelebrity chef Gordon, 57, looked proud as ever as he kissed the top of his son's head, while the youngster was bundled up. In another snap, Tana was pictured beaming at the camera whilst cradling the newborn tot in the hospital.\n\nRevealing their son had been born on or close to Gordon's birthday, he wrote: “What an amazing birthday present please welcome Jesse James Ramsay, 7lbs 10oz whopper!! One more bundle of love to the Ramsay brigade!! 3 boys, 3 girls... Done.”\n\nOver on her own Instagram page, however, Tana admitted that being pregnant again had been a worrying time after she sadly miscarried their son Rocky five months into her pregnancy back in 2016, reports in the Mirror.\n\nShe said: “It’s been a nerve wracking 9 months but we’ve made it and we have been blessed with this little bundle.” Tana confirmed there would be no more kids for the couple, adding: “Ramsay family definitely complete. Jesse James Ramsay we love you so much.”\n\nJust a few months ago, while still pregnant with Jesse, Tana penned a heartfelt message during Baby Loss Awareness Week in June posting a family portrait with Gordon and their other children, twins Holly and Jack, 23, Tilly, 22, and Megan, 18,\n\nTana wrote: “A happy picture taken of us celebrating Megan’s 18th, I was just under 20 weeks pregnant. Little did we know, a few days later I would be holding our little boy Rocky – born with a strong heartbeat, but too little to survive.”\n\nShe continued: “Although it’s 7 years today, it still feels like yesterday. We all miss you every day. We love you Rocky, forever in our hearts. I couldn’t do this without my family, you are all everything to me xxx.”\n\nJoin the Daily Record's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\nMichelin-star TV chef Gordon also reflected on the trauma of losing little Rocky, which he said was “really tough” on the family, but has since brought them even closer together. \"Losing Rocky was really tough, and then just being there and watching the trauma unfold, it's just this life-changing moment,\" Gordon told People magazine in a recent interview.\n\nMeanwhile, fans and the couple’s celebrity pals were quick to comment on their happy news of their new son. The Beckhams were one of the first, as Victoria wrote: “Congratulations xxx we love you all xx.” Actor and comedian Dawn French said: “Oh. How lovely.”\n\nFellow chef and dad-of-five Jamie Oliver, wrote: “Wow super mum congratulations! Jesse James,” as his wife Jools added: “Fantastic happy news so exciting big hugs from us all.” Spice Girl Emma Bunton commented: “Love you guys!! xxx”\n\nGino D'Acampo commented: \"FANTASTICO, still plenty of lead in that pencil!!!! Congratulazioni.\" While Christian Horner added: \"Congratulations guys,\" and Amanda Holden added: \"Fabulous news.\"\n\nLoose Women star Judi Love commented: \"Congratulations to you all my sweetie,\" while Supernanny Jo Frost echoed: \"Congratulations to you all.\"\n\nAdam Peaty, who is dating Gordon’s daughter Holly, commented: “Congratulations,” while the chef’s former Gordon, Gino and Fred: Road Trip co-star Fred Sirieix added: “Wow! Congratulations, See you soon.”\n\nJoin the Daily Record's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages."
