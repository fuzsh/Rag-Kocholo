        "text": "LONDON, ENGLAND: Gordon Ramsay, the celebrity chef needs no introduction. He is a chef, television presenter, writer, and even restaurant owner. However, very little is known about his wife Tana Ramsay whom he married in 1996.\n\nBorn on August 23, 1974, Cayetana Elizabeth 'Tana' Ramsay is an English TV presenter and cookbook author.\n\nShe was born in Croydon in South London and was raised on a farm in Kent.\n\nShe's a trained Montessori teacher. In 2010, she appeared on ITV show 'Dancing With The Stars'.\n\nShe has also been a presenter of UK TV's food show Market Kitchen. In 2013, she also appeared on 'Gordon Ramsay's Home Cooking'.\n\nApart from these shows she has featured in 'MasterChef', 'Hell's Kitchen' and even her daughter Matilda's show on CBC, 'Matilda and Ramsay Bunch. She also opened a salon called 'All About the Girl' in London's Wandsworth district in 2011 which offered various beauty treatments. After 12 years of owning the salon, she passed it ownership to Townhouse and its founder Juanita Huber-Millet.\n\nThe couple has six children, as of now. The first daughter, Megan was born in 1998, followed by twins Holly and Jack in 2000, followed by daughter Matilda in 2001, son Oscar in 2019, and finally son Jesse in 2023.\n\nTana Ramsay is close friends with Victoria Beckham.\n\nHow did Gordon Ramsey meet Tana Ramsay?\n\nThe couple first met at an early '90s New Year's Eve party although Tana was dating someone else at that time. As Tana was engaged to someone else she did not show interest in the budding chef. They reconnected a few years later at a flat Tana shared with a mutual friend- Gordon was storing his motorbike there and in no time they started dating. They finally got married on December 21, 1996. Nearly 25 years later, Tana slipped into her wedding gown and shared a video on Instagram.\n\nGordon Ramsay welcomed their sixth child in November 2023\n\nThe Ramsay family got a bit bigger as the couple welcomed their sixth child in November 2023, a son named Jesse James. The chef took to Instagram to share the news with the world. The image shared by Gordon showed him giving a little peck on Jesse's forehead as the newborn's mother held him gently wrapped in a towel.\n\nDid Tana Ramsay face fertility issues?\n\nThe couple suffered a pregnancy loss in 2016 and in 2019 their son, Oscar was born. It was a really hard time for Tana to go through, with the birth of Oscar all her piled-up emotions were released."
