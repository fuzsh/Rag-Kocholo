        "text": "Gordon Ramsay has shared news that he and wife Tana Ramsay have welcomed a baby.\n\nHe shared the news on Instagram, as he captioned two beautiful pics: “What an amazing birthday present – please welcome Jesse James Ramsay, 7lbs 10oz whopper!! One more bundle of love to the Ramsay brigade!! 3 boys, 3 girls…. Done.”\n\nGordon Ramsay, 57, and Tana, 49, already had five children: Megan, 25, twins Holly Ramsay and Jack, 23, Matilda aka Tilly, 22, and Oscar, four.\n\nThe couple suffered a miscarriage in 2016.\n\nRead more: Gordon Ramsay and daughter Tilly team up for appearance on Celebrity Gogglebox as fans thrilled\n\nNo sooner had Gordon shared his happy news on Instagram than he was inundated with congratulations and well wishes from celebrity friends as well as fans.\n\nBaby blessings for Gordon and Tana Ramsay\n\nCo-star Fred Sirieix wrote: “Wow! Congratulations. See you soon x”\n\nFellow chef James Martin said: “Congrats x”\n\nThe nation’s PE teacher Joe Wicks posted: “Absolutely wonderful news. Congratulations mate. Love to the family.”\n\nGordon celebrated his birthday on November 8, so their new son is indeed an amazing present.\n\nBack in January, Gordon pranked everyone by joking that Tana was expecting.\n\nHe appeared on Heart Breakfast with Jamie Theakston and Amanda Holden and seemingly announced the pregnancy before backtracking, revealing it to be a joke.\n\nHe added: “Tana would like another baby and I’m like ‘no, no, no, no’. It’s already hard enough thinking about when I go to take Oscar to school, ‘Hey, what’s your grandad’s name?'”\n\nPerhaps that conversation got him thinking again though!"
