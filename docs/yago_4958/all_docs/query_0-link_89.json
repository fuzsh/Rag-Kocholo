        "text": "TV chef Gordon Ramsay and his wife Tana are celebrating the arrival of a new addition to their family.\n\nGordon, who had just celebrated his 57th birthday, shared that the birth of his son, Jesse James Ramsay, was the best present he could have hoped for.\n\nREAD MORE| Lots of help and no heavy lifting – Robert De Niro on having a child at the age of 80\n\nOn social media the Michelin-starred chef said that his sixth child, who was born weighing 3,5kg, will definitely be their last.\n\n“One more bundle of love to the Ramsay brigade!! 3 boys, 3 girls…. Done,” Gordon shared.\n\nIt's a sentiment that his wife, Tana (49), a cookbook author and TV presenter, wholeheartedly supports.\n\n“Ramsay family (is) definitely complete,\" she wrote in a post.\n\nAt the start of their 27-year marriage they struggled to conceive and even went through in vitro fertilisation, but two years later they welcomed their first child, Megan (now 25).\n\nBy 2001 their brood had grown to four, including twins Jack and Holly (23), and Matilda (22).\n\nIn 2008 Tana admitted that she and Gordon were surprised at the rapid rate at which their family had expanded.\n\n\"We knew we wanted a large family,\" she said. \"But for it to happen that close together is amazing. When I discovered I was expecting Tilly, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God, how am I going to manage?' But you do.\"\n\nSeven years ago the Ramsays were expecting their fifth child but Tana miscarried at just under 20 weeks.\n\nIn a recent post, Tana shared that she still mourns the loss of little Rocky.\n\n“Born with a strong heartbeat, but too little to survive. Although it’s seven years today, it still feels like yesterday,” she wrote.\n\n“We all miss you every day. We love you Rocky, forever in our hearts. I couldn’t do this without my family, you are all everything to me.”\n\nGordon also reflected on the loss of Rocky during an interview with People magazine, saying it had brought the whole family closer.\n\nIn 2019 they announced the birth of Oscar (now 4), who Gordon joked was his last hope of having one of his family members following in his footsteps in the culinary world. But now he also has Jesse to pin his hopes on.\n\nWhen Tana shared the photo of Jesse on her Instagram, she revealed that it has been a nerve-wracking nine months. She said she feels blessed with “this little bundle”.\n\nREAD MORE| Couple wins landmark case for parents to share 4 months of maternity leave\n\nTilly also shared the news of her sibling's birth on social media, adding that she’s “feeling so lucky to have another amazing brother and to be a big sister again!”\n\nMeanwhile Holly called her mom a \"rockstar\", adding that her heart is so full following Jesse's arrival.\n\nTwo months ago, before it was even known that Tana was pregnant, Gordon told People magazine that Tana wanted “another one”.\n\n\"I’m going to be at school celebrating sports day with a f**king walker! ‘Hey, who's your granddad?' 'That's my dad, actually',\" he joked. \"So, I'm not too sure how many knee, hip replacements they'll get by the time they get to 21, but I'm going to try.\""
