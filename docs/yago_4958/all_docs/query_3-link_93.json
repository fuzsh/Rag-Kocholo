'That's my dad, actually.' So I'm not too sure how many knee-hip replacements they'll get by the time they get 21, but I'm going to try.\"\n\nThe British celebrity chef laughed at his wife's reason for having another baby, \"she says she doesn't want Oscar growing up on his own,\". \"On his own?\" Ramsay exclamated with great surprise \"He's at school every day, and he's got his four siblings! So, oh man, watch that space. . .. I'm f---ed.\"\n\nTana Ramsay adds \"I'm one of four, Gordon's one of four, so it's sort of second nature to me,\" she said while Gordon began describing their kids' personalities \"Jack's a Royal Marine commando, off defending the country in some of the most extreme conditions,\"\n\nRamsay is proud their children's academic achievements\n\nHe also opened up about how proud he is of their children's academic achievements \"Megan's an incredible police officer. Holly's gone into fashion. Tilly's studying at university for her degree. Tana and I came from a family with no degrees.\"\n\nMeanwhile, he added that Oscar was a cool kid, \"He's only 4, but he's grown up rapidly because of his four older siblings.\""
