        "text": "British chef Gordon Ramsay might have made a name for himself as the bad-tempered host of a number of television shows, including Kitchen Nightmares.\n\nBut behind the scenes, the foul-mouthed TV chef is a loving husband to his wife of 27 years, Tana, and a devoted dad to six surviving children.\n\nThe birth of Jesse James, when Ramsay was 57 and his wife was 49, followed the heartbreaking loss of a baby boy in 2016. Another baby boy, Oscar, followed three years later, before they completed their family, which also includes four adult children.\n\nSo who is Tana Ramsay, and what made her fall for the brash young chef?\n\nREAD MORE: Matchbox Twenty's Rob Thomas' 25-year marriage to wife Marisol has endured heartbreak, long distances and health battles\n\nTana was born on August 23, 1974, the youngest of four kids, and spent much of her childhood in Kent.\n\nWhen she was 17, the family, which included mum Greta and businessman dad Chris, moved to London.\n\nAfter finishing school, she trained to be a Montessori teacher and was engaged to someone else when she met her future husband at a New Year's Eve party, thought to be around 1992.\n\nHowever, far from being impressed Tana reportedly thought Gordon was a \"complete arrogant arse.\" It was only some time later that the two started dating.\n\nREAD MORE : 'We were just kids': Inside Oscar nominee Cillian Murphy's 28-year love story with wife Yvonne\n\nThey married December 21, 1996, when Tana was 21 and Gordon was 30.\n\nTwo years later, Ramsay opened Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in Chelsea, with the help of financial backing from Tana's dad.\n\nThe couple settled into a traditional version of domestic life. He worked while she stayed home raising the four children they had in quick succession – first Megan, who was born in 1998, followed by twins, Holly and Jack, in 1999, and Matilda, now known as Tilly, in 2001.\n\nAll were born following IVF after Tana was found to have polycystic ovarian syndrome while Gordon had a low sperm count from working in a hot kitchen.\n\nTV stardom followed after Gordon appeared on two British shows, Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares and Hell's Kitchen, the latter he created. US versions of both TV shows followed.\n\nWhile caring for her brood, Tana found time to become a cookbook author three-times over.\n\nBut it was not all smooth sailing for the couple. By the time a profile on Tana came out in The Guardian in 2008, they had weathered a couple of storms in her marriage – the first when her husband boasted that he had never changed a nappy and the second when allegations were made that her husband had been conducting an extra-marital affair for seven years.\n\nTana never openly addressed the allegations, but publicly stood by her husband.\n\n\"There is nothing Gordon can't say to me or I can't say to him,\" she said at the time.\n\n\"We have been through some really difficult times, but we dealt with it as a family.\n\n\"We believe in being completely open; we were aware we needed to let the kids ask us anything, and it made us all a lot stronger.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gordon expressed his disappointment over having hurt his wife.\n\nIn 2016, the couple announced they were expecting their fifth child, but when Tana was five months pregnant she went into labour. She gave birth to a baby boy, Rocky, but he did not survive.\n\nIn June 2023, Tana shared a throwback photo of that time to Instagram, writing, \"A happy picture taken of us celebrating Megan's 18th, I was just under 20 weeks' pregnant. Little did we know, a few days later I would be holding our little boy Rocky – born with a strong heartbeat, but too little to survive. Although it's seven years today, it still feels like yesterday. We all miss you every day. We love you Rocky, forever in our hearts. I couldn't do this without my family, you are all everything to me.\"\n\nGordon also spoke about the loss, telling People, \"There's no book that guides you through that loss, and so losing Rocky was really tough. Watching the trauma unfold, it's this life-changing moment.\"\n\nHe also found a silver lining in the situation. \"We wouldn't have had Oscar had we not lost Rocky. There was no substitute – far from it – but it brought us a bond that you'd never experience in a normal situation,\" he said.\n\nThe couple chose to keep their latest pregnancy a secret, surprising the public when they announced his birth in November 2023 on their Instagram accounts.\n\n\"It's been a nerve wracking nine months, but we've made it and we have been blessed with this little bundle,\" Tana wrote. \"Ramsay family definitely complete. Jesse James Ramsay we love you so much.\"\n\nGordon uploaded the same photo, writing, \"What an amazing birthday present please welcome Jesse James Ramsay, 7lbs 10oz whopper!! One more bundle of love to the Ramsay brigade!! 3 boys, 3 girls… Done.\"\n\nHe later described the arrival as \" Really extraordinary, just blessed\" and added, \"I'm also sure I'll be the oldest dad at the drop-off at school, so I'll keep my cap and glasses on.\"\n\nA month after Jesse James' birth, Gordon Ramsay took to Instagram on December 22 to wish his wife a happy wedding anniversary alongside a photo from the big day.\n\n\"Happy 27th wedding anniversary to this amazing woman, wife, mother, thank you for everything you do, love you,\" he wrote."
