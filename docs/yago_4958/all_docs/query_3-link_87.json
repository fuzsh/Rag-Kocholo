        "text": "GORDON RAMSAY has revealed his wife Tana, 49, has given birth to their sixth child.\n\nThe celebrity chef, 57, shared his delight on Instagram this evening, calling it an \"amazing birthday present\".\n\nSharing a picture of Tana in her hospital bed with their newborn, he said: \"What an amazing birthday present please welcome Jesse James Ramsay, 7lbs 10oz whopper!! One more bundle of love to the Ramsay brigade!! 3 boys, 3 girls…. Done.\"\n\nThe new mum appeared to have kept her pregnancy under wraps as neither she nor Gordon publicly confirmed they were expecting another child.\n\nFans were delighted for the couple, rushing to the comments to leave their well wishes.\n\nCelebrities such as Marvel actor Jeremy Renner, ex-footballer Frank Lampard and Strictly star Amy Dowden all sent the couple congratulatory messages.\n\nAdam Peaty, the boyfriend of their daughter Holly, wrote underneath the post: \"Congratulations.\"\n\nAs First Dates star Fred Sirieix added: \"Wow! Congratulations, see you soon x.\"\n\nFitness expert Joe Wicks commented: \"Absolutely wonderful news. Congratulations mate, love to the family.\"\n\nGordon shared a series of snaps of Tana cradling little Jesse lovingly just moments after giving birth.\n\nAt one point, he planted a sweet kiss on the tot's head as Tana looked overjoyed having welcomed the bundle of joy into the world.\n\nIn another snap, Jesse could be seen on his mother's chest wearing a small hat as she gazed down at him.\n\nThe couple are already parents to five other children - Megan, Matilda (who's known as Tilly), twins Jack and Holly, and Oscar James.\n\nHolly and Tilly paid their parents a visit in hospital and were pictured being introduced to the newborn for the first time.\n\nThey each cradled their little brother and Tilly planted kisses on his head.\n\nGordon and Tana married in 1996 and have gone on to build a beautiful family together.\n\nTheir eldest daughter, Megan, graduated from Oxford in June 2019 with a degree in psychology and splits her time between England and Los Angeles.\n\nThe family's latest arrival comes over four years after they welcomed baby number five, Oscar.\n\nHe was born 18 years after the pair's fourth child Tilly with newborn Jesse sharing a 25 year age gap with his eldest sister Megan.\n\nBack in 2016 the couple suffered heartache after Tana had a late miscarriage and lost son Rocky.\n\nOpening up about their loss in 2016, Gordon told the Daily Mail's Weekend magazine: \"We were devastated but thankfully we’re through the worst of it now.\n\n\"We’d been so excited and proud... and then there was this awful shock. Losing the baby brought us all so much closer.\""
