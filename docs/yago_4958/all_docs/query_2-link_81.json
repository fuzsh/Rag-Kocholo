        "text": "Tana Ramsay, wife of renowned TV chef Gordon Ramsay, has opened up about her feelings of \"guilt\" following a miscarriage she suffered. The couple were devastated in 2016 when Tana miscarried at 20 weeks.\n\nThree years later they welcomed their son Oscar, now five. However, Tana revealed that the young boy often asks about his older \"brother in the sky\".\n\nIn a recent podcast appearance the 49-year-old questioned if she could have \"done something differently\", admitting that she and Gordon, 56, will never fully recover from their loss. \"I still suffer so much guilt,\" she confessed, pondering whether she \"should have known something.\" Try WalesOnline Premium for FREE by clicking here for no ads, fun puzzles and brilliant new features.\n\nREAD MORE: Gavin & Stacey actress Joanna Page rules out doing one thing in final episode\n\nREAD MORE: Dan Walker reveals he has been battling an injury for nine weeks\n\nWhile speaking to Lorraine Candy and Trish Halpin on the Postcards from Midlife podcast the mother-of-six shared: \"I still suffer so much guilt. Did I, should I have known something? Should I have done something differently? It's one of those things that some days you're absolutely fine and you can kind of justify it.\"\n\nTana further expressed: \"Other days, for some reason, whether it's because you're overtired or something triggers you, I can have a day where I just feel really emotional. You don't expect to be holding a baby knowing that they're not going last more than an hour. That is always gonna be something I can never, never get over.\", reports the Mirror.\n\nGordon and Tana Ramsay, parents to Megan, 26, twins Holly and Jack, 24, Tilly, 22, Oscar, five and Jesse, 18 months, have shared a poignant insight into their family life. Tana revealed that their youngest son, Oscar, often talks about his older sibling Rocky, who tragically passed away. \"Even Oscar now, he talks about Rocky, his brother in the sky or his star,\" she said.\n\nTana continued: \"And he'll come out with things like 'I really don't like him being there. Why can't he just come here? ' One of the hardest times actually was after I had Oscar, and he must have been about three weeks old. And I had a day where I felt so emotional. I think it was the guilt that I didn't think that I felt enough about Rocky because I've been excited with a new baby. And that threw me, and I remember Gordon saying to me, it was always going to hit you like this now, because we've been so in this bubble. And then suddenly you think, I felt unfair that I hadn't sort of been thinking enough or sad. You can never know what's around the corner with grief, and we've never had anything like that.\""
