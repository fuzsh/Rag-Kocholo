Joking about becoming a father at 57, he told Entertainment Tonight, \"Really extraordinary, just blessed. I'm also sure I'll be the oldest dad at the drop-off at school, so I'll keep my cap and glasses on.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Ramsay announced on his Instagram that he'd welcomed his sixth baby. \"What an amazing birthday present please welcome Jesse James Ramsay, 7lbs 10oz whopper,\" he wrote in his caption. \"One more bundle of love to the Ramsay brigade!! 3 boys, 3 girls…. Done.\"\n\nTana shared the same photos on her own Instagram account. \"It’s been a nerve wracking 9 months but we’ve made it and we have been blessed with this little bundle,\" Tana wrote in her caption. \"Ramsay family definitely complete. Jesse James Ramsay we love you so much.\"\n\nJesse’s birth was a surprise to Ramsey’s fans, as the news of the pregnancy was completely under wraps.\n\nGordon is known for his harsh demeanor on TV, such as on shows like ‘Gordon Ramsay's 24 Hours to Hell and Back’. However, in September 2023, he told People Magazine that his kids have \"brought the emotion\" out of him.\n\n\"Tana’s super fierce, an ex-Montessori school teacher. So, I’m the softie,\" he said. Tana added, \"He is, believe it or not, incredibly sensitive — he’s a crier.”\n\nAccording to wealth website Celebrity Net Worth, Gordon is worth an estimated £181 million. However, he will not be leaving all of his inheritance to his kids so as not to spoil them.\n\n\"It's definitely not going to them, and that's not in a mean way, it's to not spoil them. The only thing I've agreed with Tana is that they get a 25% deposit on a flat, but not the whole flat,\" he shared with the Telegraph in 2017.\n\nRead more: How to avoid creating gender stereotypes in children"
