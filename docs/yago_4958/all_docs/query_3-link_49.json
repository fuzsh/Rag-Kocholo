        "text": "Gordon Ramsay is well known for his explicit language in the kitchen, but what you may not know is that the tempered chef also plays the role of doting father.\n\nSpeaking to People, Gordon confirmed that, “The kids have brought the most emotion out of me.” It’s not a side to the chef that we often see.\n\nGordon Ramsay’s children have definitely softened the Hell’s Kitchen chef over the years. But who are they, and what are they doing now?\n\nIs Gordon Ramsay still married to Tana Ramsay?\n\nIn 1996, Gordon married Cayetana Elizabeth “Tana” Ramsay, who at the time was a Montessori school teacher. Two years later, the 31-year-old chef opened his first restaurant in 1998, receiving three Michelin stars for the self-titled establishment. During this time, Gordon and Tana welcomed their first child.\n\nHow many biological children does Gordon Ramsay have?\n\nGordon and Tana have had six children together since 1998, with their most recent son born in November 2023.\n\nHow old is Gordon Ramsay?\n\nGordon Ramsay is 57 years old, and his wife Tana is 49. He was 31, when they welcomed their first child into the world.\n\nWho are Gordon Ramsay’s kids?\n\nMegan Jane Ramsay\n\nBorn in 1998, Megan Ramsay is the eldest of the Ramsay children. Preferring to steer clear of the spotlight, the 25-year-old went on to study psychology at Oxford Brooks University where she graduated in 2019.\n\nAlthough Gordon has been revealed as a big softy when it comes to his children, that doesn’t seem to translate to their dating lives. In 2021, when Megan began reconnecting with her ex-boyfriend, the chef admitted to not liking him very much. “He was ok to begin with, a little bit wet. You want a man to date your daughter and he was just a little bit pathetic,” Gordon said at the time.\n\nHolly Anna Ramsay\n\nNot long after becoming parents for the first time, Gordon and Tana welcomed twins Holly and Jack in 2000.\n\nHolly Ramsay, 23, went on to attend Ravensbourne University in London where she studied fashion, and also did some work as a model. Holly has amassed her own following with her popular podcast 21 & Over, where she advocates for mental health.\n\nJack Scott Ramsay\n\nJack Ramsay is Holly’s fraternal twin, and is the spitting image of his father. In 2020, after completing his degree, Jack joined the Royal Marines.\n\nGordon took to Instagram, proudly writing “Can’t tell you enough how proud I am of this young man Jack Ramsay you’ve made me feel like the proudest father today congrats on joining the royal marines what an amazing achievement.”\n\nMatilda Ramsay\n\nFondly known as “Tilly”, Matilda Ramsay is the couple’s fourth child, and arguably the most recognised. Not only does she share the same birthday as her father, but out of all of Gordon Ramsay’s children, Tilly seems to be the only one with the same passion for food and presenting!\n\nMatilda has had her fair share of on-screen roles, presenting the Matilda and the Ramsay Bunch cooking show, and competing on the 13th season of Masterchef Australia. However, most recently the 22-year-old signed on as a regular judge on the ninth season of Masterchef Junior alongside her father.\n\nSpeaking to People in February of 2024, Matilda spoke of her experience working alongside Gordon.\n\n“We laugh, he makes me laugh all the time. We annoy each other, don’t get me wrong. We tease each other constantly.\n\n“I grew up watching him leave for work in the morning and come home in the afternoon and I’d always say, ‘Oh, what did they cook today? What did you try? How was this? How was that?’ So now actually doing it with him and living those stories he used to tell me,”\n\nOscar James Ramsay\n\nUntil recently, Oscar Ramsay was the youngest of Gordon’s children. The four-year-old was welcomed into the world with a hilarious Instagram post from Gordon: “After 3 BAFTAS and one Emmy… finally we have won an Oscar.”\n\nAlthough he’s only young, Oscar has already amassed quite the following on social media. His big sisters Tilly and Holly manage his account, ensuring all his followers are being kept up to date with his busy schedule.\n\nJesse James Ramsay\n\nThe sixth Ramsay child made their entrance into the world very recently in November 2023. Gordon cryptically hinted at Jesse arriving on the same day as his birthday, much like his big sister Tilly."
