        "text": "We usually see Chef Gordon Ramsay either cursing someone out on television or cooking up a storm in the kitchen. However, this week, he shocked fans by revealing he had been in a \"really bad\" cycling accident.\n\nRamsay, who admitted he's lucky to be alive, was cycling in Connecticut when the collision occurred. Thankfully, he was wearing a helmet.\n\nIn a video posted to Instagram, the 57-year-old showed a massive purple bruise on his torso and shared images of a crushed helmet and torn clothing.\n\n\"Hey guys, it’s Gordon. I’d like to share a very important message with you all. You know how much I love cycling and triathlons and Ironman [races] etc and this week, unfortunately, I had a really bad accident and it really shook me and honestly I’m lucky to be here.\n\n\"Those incredible trauma surgeons, doctors, nurses in the hospitals looked after me this week, they were amazing but honestly, you’ve got to wear helmets.\n\n\"I don’t care how short the journey is. I don’t care … these helmets cost money, but they’re crucial, even with a kid’s short journey, they’ve got to wear a helmet.\n\n\"Now, I’m lucky to be standing here. I’m in pain. It’s been a brutal week. And I’m sort of getting through it.\"\n\nRamsay's hands were visibly shaking during the video. However, he reassured everyone that he was \"doing OK\" and hadn't broken any bones or suffered any major injuries, though he admitted he was \"a bit bruised up, looking like a purple potato.\"\n\nRamsay has established himself as one of the world's most recognisable chefs, with over 17 million followers on Instagram. Originally from Johnstone, near Glasgow in Scotland, he has risen through the ranks to achieve success in Hollywood, thanks to his numerous television shows.\n\nHere's everything we know about his personal life.\n\nGordon Ramsay’s wife.\n\nGordon Ramsay and Tana Ramsay married in 1996 and have been together since. They have six children together, three girls and three boys.\n\n“We’re together healing as a family, but we want to thank everyone again for all your amazing support and well wishes,” he wrote.\n\nTana later became pregnant again, giving birth to their fifth child, a second son, in April 2019.\n\nFour years later in 2023, Tana gave birth to the couple's youngest child, Jesse, which came as a complete surprise to fans as they kept the pregnancy under wraps.\n\n\"It’s been a nerve-wracking nine months but we’ve made it and we have been blessed with this little bundle,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"Ramsay family definitely complete.\"\n\n\"[My money is] definitely not going to them [my kids], and that’s not in a mean way; it’s to not spoil them,” he told The Telegraph last year.\n\n\"I’ve never been really turned on about the money. That’s not my number one objective, and that’s reflected in the way the kids are brought up.\"\n\nHe also revealed that the children never fly first class with him.\n\n\"They don’t sit with us in first class,\" he told The Telegraph.\n\n\"They haven’t worked anywhere near hard enough to afford that. At that age, at that size, you’re telling me they need to sit in first class? No, they do not. We’re really strict on that,\" he explained.\n\n\"I turn left with Tana and they turn right and I say to the chief stewardess, ‘Make sure those little f**kers don’t come anywhere near us, I want to sleep on this plane.' I worked my f**king arse off to sit that close to the pilot and you appreciate it more when you’ve grafted for it.\"\n\n\"I’ve been super lucky, having that career for the last 15 years in the US. Seriously, it has earned a fortune and I’ve been very lucky, so I respect everything I’ve got,\" he added.\n\nThis story was originally published on June 18, 2021, and has since been updated with new information.\n\nFeature image: Instagram/@megan__ramsay\n\nLove watching TV and movies?
