        "text": "Gordon Ramsay has been in a long and happy marriage with his wife, Tana, but over the years many people have noticed one thing missing in their relationship - his wedding ring.\n\nNow the 57-year-old Kitchen Nightmares star has shared exactly why that is. Appearing on What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, Gordon was quizzed about his love life.\n\nThe American TV host asked: \"Are you married, Gordon?\" Lisa Vanderpump, who was also on the show, answered for the chef as she said: \"Yes! He has six kids.\"\n\nAndy appeared to be puzzled as he readdressed the sweary restaurateur, adding: \"But you don't wear a ring?\" Gordon offered an explanation as he said: \"No because I lost it once in a bowl of pasta.\"\n\nThe host said that he asked because he noted that there was \"chemistry\" between the show's guests. Andy said: \"I think you two might hook up tonight!\"\n\nGordon added that Lisa is his \"work wife\", after co-starring together on USA show Food Stars. Lisa added: \"He's a pain in my a*** but he's absolutely iconic.\"\n\nWho is Gordon Ramsay's wife?\n\nTana and Gordon first met in 1992 when she was actually dating one of his best friends, the head chef at Le Pont de la Tour.\n\nReportedly, she found him quite arrogant when she met him for the first time. However, they reportedly met a second time at a flat which she shared with a friend and he convinced her to go out with him before they officially started dating.\n\nThe couple married in December 1996 and went to Hawaii for their honeymoon. Their marriage got off to a dramatic start when the airline lost all their luggage, forcing them to wear the same clothes for a week.\n\nThey went on to have six children together - Matilda (Tilly), Megan, Holly, Jack, Oscar and Jesse. Oscar was a rainbow baby, as the couple experienced a miscarriage in 2016, which Tana has been very candid about through the years.\n\nTana had been pregnant for five months when they suffered the loss. They named the baby Rocky."
