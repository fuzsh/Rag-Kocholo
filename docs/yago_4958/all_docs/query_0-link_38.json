He'll sort of say to me, 'Am I even in this family? Because you know you've just done this that and the other, and you didn't even ask'.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I'm like, 'Well because I'm not used to asking, I don't need to ask you to do it, because you're not usually [here], you haven't been here for two weeks'. So that's quite tricky.\"\n\nElsewhere on the podcast, the 49-year-old revealed that Gordon has been at home more since lockdown, a shift which she's been relishing.\n\n\"Having him around so much more, it does make it really lovely and I think that being older, both of us value those moments,\" she explained, before later adding: \"Everything feels calmer… There's more of a respect for each other.\"\n\nGordon, 57, has been married to Tana since 1996. Together they share six children: Megan, 25, twins Holly and Jack, 24, Matilda, 22, Oscar, four, and newest addition, Jesse.\n\nThey kept details of their latest pregnancy under wraps, with Tana announcing Jesse's arrival in a sweet Instagram post back in November 2023.\n\nSharing their joyous baby news with the world, Tana wrote: \"It's been a nerve-wracking 9 months but we've made it and we have been blessed with this little bundle. Ramsay family definitely complete. Jesse James Ramsay we love you so much.\"\n\nGordon also revelled in the exciting news, writing on Instagram: \" What an amazing birthday present please welcome Jesse James Ramsay, 7lbs 10oz whopper. One more bundle of love to the Ramsay brigade!! 3 boys, 3 girls…. Done.\"\n\nDuring an interview with People, Gordon reiterated that they have no plans to expand their family.\n\nThe star explained: \"This morning, Oscar said, 'Wouldn't it be nice if Jesse and I had a little sister?' And I spat my Cheerios out. So yeah, I had to get up from the table and walk away.\""
