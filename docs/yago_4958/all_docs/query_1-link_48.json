        "text": "Gordon Ramsay's children are bonding with their new baby brother.\n\nTo celebrate Thanksgiving, Ramsay shared an adorable clip of his newborn son cuddling with one of his older siblings.\n\nIn the sweet video, the proud older brother calls the newborn \"cute\" and \"gorgeous\" before giving him a hug and kissing the top of his head.\n\n\"Brothers in arms , bonding as brothers should do , happy thanksgiving sending love from all the Ramsay’s,\" the celebrity chef wrote on Instagram.\n\nRamsay announced the birth of his six child with his wife, Tana Ramsay, on Nov. 11 in an Instagram post.\n\nHe shared a series of photos of his “amazing birthday present” with his followers, beginning with a snap of him kissing his newborn’s head as his wife cradled their son against her chest.\n\nRamsay, who celebrated his 57th birthday on Nov. 8, followed the sweet photo with two pictures of just his wife and their son cuddling in the hospital bed.\n\n“What an amazing birthday present please welcome Jesse James Ramsay, 7lbs 10oz whopper!!” he wrote. “One more bundle of love to the Ramsay brigade!! 3 boys, 3 girls…. Done.”\n\nTana Ramsay shared the same photos on her Instagram, including a snap of their son, Oscar, meeting his little brother.\n\n“It’s been a nerve wracking 9 months but we’ve made it and we have been blessed with this little bundle,” she wrote. “Ramsay family definitely complete. Jesse James Ramsay we love you so much.”\n\nThe couple received plenty of congratulatory notes in the comment section for their new bundle of joy.\n\n“Congratulations,” Jeremy Renner commented.\n\nHugh Jackman wrote, “Congrats mate!”\n\n“Absolute magic!! Congratulations!!!” Daphne Oz said in the comments. “So much love to the whole family.”\n\nGordon and Tana Ramsay wed on Dec. 21, 1996. In addition to their newborn son, the couple are also parents to five older children: Megan, 25, twins Holly and Jack, 23, Tilly, 22, and Oscar, 4.\n\nHere's everything to know about Gordon Ramsay's six children.\n\nMegan Ramsay\n\nGordon and Tana Ramsay welcomed their first child, daughter Megan, on May 16, 1998.\n\nMegan is often featured on her parents’ Instagram pages, though she doesn’t appear to have a social media presence of her own.\n\nGordon Ramsay celebrated his eldest daughter’s accomplishments on Instagram in June 2019, marking her college graduation from Oxford Brookes University. In the caption, he shared that she was the first member of the family to receive a college degree.\n\nSince graduating, Gordon Ramsay told People in September 2023 that his eldest daughter is a police officer.\n\nOver the years, Megan has achieved quite a few accomplishments, including running the TCS London Marathon for Great Ormond Street Hospital. Ahead of her run in April 2023, she received a little help from her mom to prepare, which Tana Ramsay shared on Instagram. In the post, the proud mom captured a photo of her handiwork on Megan’s braids and wished her daughter the “best of luck.”\n\nIn October 2023, Megan appeared on an episode from Season 20 of “Hell's Kitchen” when her dad hosted her 21st birthday party at the restaurant.\n\nIn a funny moment, during a 2022 appearance on “The Kelly Clarkson Show,” Gordon Ramsay told a hilarious story about how he interrupted Megan’s dinner date with her boyfriend, though he did preface the story by telling host Kelly Clarkson that he “did something really bad” the previous week.\n\n“Megan started seeing her ex-boyfriend again and his name’s Byron,” he explained. “He was OK to begin with. A little bit wet. You want a man to date your daughter and he was just a little bit pathetic.”\n\nHe said that he snagged Byron’s phone number from his other daughter, Tilly, though she told him not to do anything with this piece of information. While he assured him he’d only use the number for emergencies, he waited for the perfect moment to take advantage.\n\n“So I waited to find out when they’re having dinner together and I FaceTimed him,” he said. “He sort of answered the phone, [his phone] was shaking. I said, ‘Byron, it’s me, not your future father-in-law, you little f---!’”\n\nUltimately, Megan interrupted the exchange and cut her father off before he continued to wreak havoc on her date night.\n\nHolly Anna Ramsay\n\nThe couple welcomed twins on Dec. 31, 1999, daughter Holly Anna and son Jack Scott.\n\nHolly and Jack are a dynamic duo and the two have shared similar interests, including running the London marathon together for the first time in April 2018. After the race, Holly reflected on the experience on Instagram, thanking her brother for his support during their training.\n\nShe also actively shares moments of her life on social media, including sweet snaps with her father, despite him criticizing some of her home cooking.\n\nHolly had a short-lived podcast called “21 & Over with Holly Ramsay” in 2021, which focused on mental health, including her own struggles. In her first episode, she spoke to with therapist Talitha Fosh about a range of personal topics, including growing up in the public eye, social media, and struggles with depression.\n\nShe also opened up about being a victim of sexual assault twice when she was 18. After her first year of college, she spent three months in a psychiatric hospital and was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and PTSD.\n\nHolly has also used social media to publicly share insights about her mental health journey, including her sobriety. In December 2021, she reflected on marking one year of being sober, writing that she “chose to take a break from alcohol because it wasn’t improving my mental health.”\n\nWhen she hit two years of sobriety, Holly shared another candid post on Instagram to reflect on her journey and shared her gratitude for her support system and platform. She added, “I feel lucky to be able to use my voice to raise awareness and break the stigma around mental health.”\n\nJack Scott Ramsay\n\nGordon and Tana Ramsay also welcomed son Jack Scott on Dec. 31, 1999.\n\nAfter running the London marathon with his twin sister in 2018, he ran it again the following year, receiving love and support from his mom on Instagram for the occasion.\n\nIn 2019, Jack appeared on the reality TV series “Born Famous,” which followed the children of celebrities as they are given an opportunity to see what life would be like if they weren’t tied to fame through their family.\n\nJack went on to join the Royal Marines in October 2020. His father celebrated the news on social media, with Gordon Ramsay writing in part on Instagram, “Can’t tell you enough how proud I am of this young man Jack Ramsay you’ve made me feel like the proudest father today.”\n\nThe father-son duo discussed their relationship during a June 2019 interview on British GQ's YouTube channel.\n\nJack reflected on one lessons he has learned from his dad, telling the outlet, “I always got the sense of, with you, you work hard to play hard. Sometimes I think you work harder, maybe too hard sometimes.”\n\n“You leave the house at 6 a.m., you don't come back until I'm in bed having finished homework and school,” Jack added. “But like you said, we have quality time together. We go for drives, we play sports. It's that balance that I find, you always get it 100% spot on.”\n\nMatilda Elizabeth “Tilly” Ramsay\n\nThe couple welcomed their fourth child, daughter Matilda Elizabeth — affectionately called Tilly — on Nov. 8, 2001.\n\nTilly has followed in her father’s footsteps as a TV presenter and chef. She made several appearances on both “MasterChef Junior” and “Hell’s Kitchen” over the years, and appeared on “Gordon Ramsay’s Home Cooking” in 2013 alongside her father.\n\nBy 2015, Tilly started to host her own TV show called “Matilda and the Ramsay Bunch,” which ran for five seasons from April 2015 to July 2019. She also would appear with her father on ITV’s “This Morning” for their regular cooking segment, “Big Chef Little Chef” and competed on Season 19 of “Strictly Come Dancing.”\n\nTilly was also announced as a judge on “MasterChef Junior” in October 2023, Deadline reported.\n\nOutside of her work on television, Gordon Ramsay told People that she is also studying to get her college degree as well.\n\nAfter working alongside her father for several years, Tilly has developed a playful relationship with her dad.\n\nShe's not been afraid to call out his cooking online, sharing with the internet that she prefers her mom's culinary skills. Tilly has also pranked her father, cracking a raw egg on top of his head before making her swift getaway.\n\nOscar James Ramsay\n\nGordon and Tana Ramsay welcomed their fifth child, son Oscar James, on April 4, 2019.\n\nThe couple announced they were expecting Oscar in January 2019, three years after they experienced pregnancy loss.\n\nOver the years, Tana Ramsay has been candid about her 2016 pregnancy loss when she was 5-months along.\n\nIn November 2020, she reflected on this period of time to the U.K. outlet Metro. Despite his on-screen persona, she said that her husband was able to bring her comfort during in the aftermath of her loss.\n\n“Gordon was amazing,” she explained. “He’s always been one to talk about everything. He…never made me feel that, ‘Oh, you know, maybe we shouldn’t talk about it.’”\n\nJune marked seven years since her pregnancy loss, with the author sharing an emotional post on Instagram as she reflected on the lingering grief.\n\n“Although it’s 7 years today, it still feels like yesterday,” she wrote in part. “We all miss you everyday. We love you Rocky, forever in our hearts. I couldn’t do this without my family, you are all everything to me.”\n\nEven as a toddler, Oscar inherited his father's signature scowl. Gordon Ramsay told People that his son was “a cool kid,” adding, “He's only 4, but he's grown up rapidly because of his four older siblings.”\n\nJesse James Ramsay\n\nThe couple welcomed their sixth child, son Jesse James, in November 2023.\n\nNeither Gordon nor Tana Ramsay shared that they were expecting their youngest child, though he told People in September that his wife wanted another child because she didn’t want their son Oscar “growing up on his own.”\n\nTana Ramsay told the outlet that she always wanted a big family, explaining, “I’m one of four, Gordon’s one of four, so it’s sort of second nature to me.”\n\nIn addition to his parents celebrating his arrival, he also got plenty of love from his older sisters Holly and Tilly.\n\n“Welcome to the world Jesse James,” Holly wrote on Instagram alongside a photo holding her newborn brother at the hospital. “I’m a big sister again and my heart is so full. @tanaramsay you are a rockstar.”\n\nOn her Instagram, Tilly shared two snaps holding baby Jesse, giving him a kiss on his forehead in both.\n\n“Welcome to the world Jesse James Ramsay!!” she wrote in the caption. “Feeling so lucky to have another amazing brother and to be a big sister again!!”"
