        "text": "It's unclear exactly when Jesse was born.\n\nTana Ramsay, 49, also shared photos on her Instagram page, including a photo of their son Oscar meeting Jesse.\n\nShe wrote in the caption that it had \"been a nerve wracking 9 months but we've made it and we have been blessed with this little bundle.\"\n\nShe added: \"Ramsay family definitely complete. Jesse James Ramsay we love you so much.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nA representative for Ramsay did not respond to a request for comment from Insider sent outside of regular working hours.\n\nGordon and Tana Ramsay, who have been married since 1996, are also parents to Megan, 25; Jack and Holly, 23; Matilda \"Tilly,\" 22; and Oscar, 4.\n\nTana Ramsay previously experienced a miscarriage — in June she posted a family photo on Instagram to commemorate the loss.\n\n\"A happy picture taken of us celebrating Megan's 18th, I was just under 20 weeks pregnant,\" she wrote. \"Little did we know, a few days later I would be holding our little boy Rocky - born with a strong heartbeat, but too little to survive.\"\n\nSpeaking to People in September, Gordon Ramsay teased that the family could be expanding soon, saying his wife wanted \"another one\" as she \"doesn't want Oscar growing up on his own.\"\n\nRamsay then joked about the downsides of being a father again as he approaches his 60s.\n\n\"I'm going to be at school celebrating sports day with a f---ing walker!\" he said. \"'Hey, who's your granddad?' 'That's my dad, actually.'\n\n\"So I'm not too sure how many knee hip replacements they'll get by the time they get 21, but I'm going to try,\" he added."
