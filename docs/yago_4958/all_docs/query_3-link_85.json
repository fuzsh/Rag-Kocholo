        "text": "Gordon Ramsay’s wife Tana Ramsay has revealed it’s been a “nerve-racking nine months” as she gave birth to her sixth child at the age of 49.\n\nThe cookery book author and celebrity chef Gordon, 57, announced the happy news they had welcomed a son on Saturday. The new mum beamed at the camera as she cuddled the newborn as proud dad Gordon kissed the top of his bonnet-covered head.\n\nRevealing the tot had been born on or close to his own birthday on November 8, Gordon posted: “What an amazing birthday present please welcome Jesse James Ramsay, 7lbs 10oz whopper!! One more bundle of love to the Ramsay brigade!! 3 boys, 3 girls... Done.”\n\nBut over on her own Instagram page, Tana shared being pregnant again had been a worrying time for her after she sadly miscarried son Rocky five months into her pregnancy in 2016. She told her 295,000 followers: “It’s been a nerve wracking 9 months but we’ve made it and we have been blessed with this little bundle.”\n\nShe said there would be no more kids for her and Gordon now and added: “Ramsay family definitely complete. Jesse James Ramsay we love you so much.” Just a few months ago, while she was still pregnant with Jesse, Tana penned a heartfelt message to the baby she lost during Baby Loss Awareness Week in June.\n\nPosting a family portrait with Gordon and their other children, twins Holly and Jack, 23, Tilly, 22, and Megan, 18, Tana wrote: “A happy picture taken of us celebrating Megan’s 18th, I was just under 20 weeks pregnant. Little did we know, a few days later I would be holding our little boy Rocky – born with a strong heartbeat, but too little to survive.”\n\nTana continued: “Although it’s 7 years today, it still feels like yesterday. We all miss you every day. We love you Rocky, forever in our hearts. I couldn’t do this without my family, you are all everything to me xxx.”\n\nMichelin-star TV chef Gordon also reflected on the trauma of losing little Rocky, which he said was “really tough” on the family, but has since brought them even closer together. \"Losing Rocky was really tough, and then just being there and watching the trauma unfold, it's just this life-changing moment,\" Gordon told People magazine in a recent interview.\n\nHe said the family had thrown an \"incredible celebration\" and that \"everything was going fine\" despite Tana having \"always struggled with her bloods.\" But sadly, things took a turn for the worst in the cookbook author's second trimester when she and Gordon learned that Rocky was not going to make it.\n\n\"And all of a sudden it just changes within 24 hours,\" he admitted. \"So, I think if anything it bought the whole family together, closer, Jack's still got the little dog tag with Rocky.\" After losing Rocky, Tana and Gordon welcomed their fifth child, a son called Oscar James in April 2019 who is now four years old – and with the new arrival of son Jesse, they are now a family of eight.\n\nFans and the couple’s celebrity pals were quick to comment on their happy news. Their close pals the Beckham were one of the first, with Victoria writing: “Congratulations xxx we love you all xx.” Actor and comedian Dawn French said: “Oh. How lovely.”\n\nFellow chef and dad-of-five Jamie Oliver, wrote: “Wow super mum congratulations! Jesse James,” as his wife Jools added: “Fantastic happy news so exciting big hugs from us all.” Spice Girl Emma Bunton commented: “Love you guys!! xxx”\n\nGino D'Acampo commented: \"FANTASTICO, still plenty of lead in that pencil!!!! Congratulazioni.\" While Christian Horner added: \"Congratulations guys,\" and Amanda Holden added: \"Fabulous news.\"\n\nLoose Women star Judi Love commented: \"Congratulations to you all my sweetie,\" while Supernanny Jo Frost echoed: \"Congratulations to you all.\"\n\nAdam Peaty, who is dating Gordon’s daughter Holly, commented: “Congratulations,” while the chef’s former Gordon, Gino and Fred: Road Trip co-starFred Sirieixadded: “Wow! Congratulations, See you soon.”\n\nThe couple, who married in 1996, are already parents to five other children - Megan, 24, twins Jack and Holly, 23, Tilly, 22, and Oscar, 4. Gordon, who already shares a birthday with his youngest daughter Tilly, recently spoke about Tana’s determination to have another baby.\n\nIn an interview in September, Gordon told Dish podcast hosts Nick Grimshaw and Angela Hartnett that his 49-year-old wife wanted to expand their brood, but he wasn’t so sure. “I’ve got a little secret… Tana wants another one,” he teased, with listeners unaware that Gordon’s wife was actually heavily pregnant at the time.\n\nHe confessed he was reluctant to become a dad again, as he worried that other parents in the playground would mistake him for his child’s granddad. “It’s like going to school, going out for dinner in two buses. And secondly, I’m going to be the oldest f***er at school. ‘Who’s your grandad?’” he quipped.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads"
