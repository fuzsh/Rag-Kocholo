This will help raise vital funds for the hospital to support some of the UK’s most seriously ill children.\n\nEvery day at Great Ormond Street Hospital, doctors and nurses battle the most complex illnesses, and the brightest minds come together to achieve pioneering medical breakthroughs. Thanks to the generous support of our restaurant guests during November and December, we can help to fund pioneering research, medical equipment, and children and family support services, so that the 600 seriously ill children that arrive at GOSH every day have the best possible future.\n\nIf you would like to support us, you can donate to GOSH Charity via the Gordon and Tana Ramsay Foundation.\n\nA note from Gordon and Tana:\n\nWe know how important family is – especially during difficult times.\n\nWith your help, we want to support the thousands of children and their families who come to the hospital each year, at a time when they need our support the most.\n\nPlease donate to Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity through The Gordon and Tana Ramsay Foundation today."
