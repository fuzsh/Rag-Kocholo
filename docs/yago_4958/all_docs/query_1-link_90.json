        "text": "Gordon Ramsay's four adult children have all moved home.\n\nThe celebrity chef and his wife Tana have six children together - Megan, 26, twins Holly and Jack, 24, Tilly, 22, Oscar, five and Jesse, eight months - and Tana revealed that despite previously moving out, all of their kids now reside under the roof of their London home.\n\nSpeaking to Lorraine Candy and Trish Halpin on the Postcards from Midlife podcast, Tana said: \"They left home, and they've all come back. They moved out of our house three years ago to renovate.\n\n\"By the time we finished the project and moved back in three weeks ago, everyone has a bedroom again. They've all moved home. Holly lives in Nottingham, but she's always coming back to London and obviously wants a bedroom with her boyfriend [swimmer Adam Peaty].\"\n\nTana added that luckily for the whole family, baby Jesse is good at \"sleeping through noise\". She said: \"Luckily when someone's sneaking in at three in the morning [and] the dog is barking like crazy, doors are slamming, he sleeps... They just have to revolve around him really.\"\n\nTana, 49, revealed she is the main chef at home and revealed that surprisingly, Gordon, 57, isn't fussy about what he eats but the older children are.\n\nShe said: \"Gordon eats anything. He's so easy to cook for. He wants the plainest most simple home cooking. They're all so fussy. Holly won't eat dairy at the moment. Tilly eats fish, but not meat. They never used to be like this, so the little ones are the easiest. All the kids are quite demanding, but I love it.\"\n\nTana also expressed her \"guilt\" after suffering a miscarriage in the same interview. The TV chef and Tana were left heartbroken in 2016 when she suffered a miscarriage at 20 weeks. Three years after their heartbreak, they welcomed son Oscar. But in a candid admission, Tana revealed that the youngster often asks about his older \"brother in the sky\".\n\nThe doting mum questioned whether she could have \"done something differently\" while sharing that she and Gordon will never get over the heartbreak. \"I still suffer so much guilt,\" she said, before going on to ask whether she \"should have known something.\"\n\n\"I still suffer so much guilt. Did I, should I have known something? Should I have done something differently? It's one of those things that some days you're absolutely fine and you can kind of justify it,\" she candidly confessed."
