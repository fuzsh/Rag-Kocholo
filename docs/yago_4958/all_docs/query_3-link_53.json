        "text": "Tana Ramsay has spilled the beans on hubby Gordon's \"really bad\" bike crash in the States.\n\nShe revealed the telly chef was lucky to dodge any broken bones. Chatting on the Postcards From Midlife podcast, Tana dished out the deets to Lorraine Candy and Trish Halpin about Gordon's gnarly injuries that had the hosts gasping.\n\n\"It was horrendous,\" she admitted, spilling the tea on the extent of Gordon's bruises which got a serious reaction from the presenters. Despite the rough tumble, Tana's counting her blessings that he's on the mend, saying: \"Luckily he is ok. How he didn't break anything, I don't know. The bruising has been huge, as you saw, but it just reminds us all we're not invincible.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Adam Peaty 'needs stitches' after 'fight with Team GB swimmer over ex-WAG quip'\n\nREAD MORE: Join the Daily Star Soaps WhatsApp for all the latest spoilers and exclusives\n\nThe Ramsays have had a proper wake-up call about safety on their cycling jaunts after the scare. Tana gave the lowdown on their passion for pedalling, admitting: \"We both love cycling. It's so dangerous, but it's so fun. It's low impact.\"\n\n\"It just reminds us to wear a helmet and just have to be careful. He seems quite perky about it,\" the mum-of-six told the Express. Just a few weeks ago, Gordon took to social media to share \"an important Father's Day message\", raising awareness about the importance of wearing helmets.\n\nThe renowned Hell's Kitchen chef revealed his shocking bruise under his chef's jacket and told followers how he'd been swiftly taken to hospital, reports the Mirror.\n\nIn his heartfelt post, Ramsay thanked the \"incredible trauma surgeons, doctors, and nurses\" at Lawrence and Memorial Hospital, while singling out the helmet as the life-saving device that he was most thankful for\".\n\nAddressing fans directly in the video, he disclosed: \"I'm lucky to be standing here. I am in pain, it's been a brutal week, but I am sort of getting through it.\"\n\nHis battered body, which he amusingly compared to \"looking like a purple potato\", miraculously escaped any serious injuries or broken bones. Ramsay emphatically urged his followers: \"You've got to wear a helmet,\" regardless of the shortness of their journey or the expense of a suitable helmet because they are \"I don't care how short the journey is. I don't care that these helmets cost money, they're crucial.\"\n\nTo wrap up his safety-themed Father's Day greeting, the famous chef wished his fans well while reemphasising his essential message: \"I want to wish you all a happy Father's Day, but please, please, please wear a helmet. If I didn't, honestly, I wouldn't be here now.\""
