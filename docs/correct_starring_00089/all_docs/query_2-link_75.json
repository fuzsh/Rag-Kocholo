        "text": "Classic Arnold makes fun of himself.\n\nGeared for teenagers from a bygone era but this film still holds up. Kids and adults will enjoy, especially if Arnold fans for whom the humor is intended. Good villains and acting is above par. Story is broken and perhaps inconsistent at times and is perhaps due to it’s “magical” elements and this idea of a parallel universe that is being played out in a movie within a movie Huh?. Well I think if one simply buys into this story idea it makes for a more enjoyable ride and even a second viewing. This film can seem AVERAGE by today’s standards but I am a fan of the actors so I boost my rating to GOOD :)\n\nOne of my favorite Arnie films\n\nLast Action Hero I just caught this movie on TV a couple weeks ago and remembered why I loved it so much. This is one of the most original Arnie films ever made. A boy who absoultely loves Jack Slater movies gets a magic ticket that takes him through the movie screen and into the Slater movies. Last Action Hero features great action scenes that are a little overdone (but that's a good thing) and some of the funniest banter between Arnie and his little sidekick. Last Action Hero is original, action packed, and full of laughs. Final Verdict: 5/5 Rent or Buy?: Buy this movie now, you won't be dissapointed. IF YOU FIND THIS REVIEW HELPFUL PLEASE REMEMBER TO VOTE. Thank you."
