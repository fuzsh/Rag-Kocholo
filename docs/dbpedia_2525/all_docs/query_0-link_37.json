He has performed chamber music with artists such as Marc Destrubé, Kristian Bezuidenhout, Elizabeth Wallfisch, and Sergiu Luca. Previously, while living in Europe, he worked with ensembles such as as Fiori Musicali-Barockorchester Bremen, The Harp Consort, Ensemble Aperto, and Confetti Musicali, often as continuo cellist, taking part in numerous recordings and tours. Currently he is based in Rochester, NY, where he is Co-Director of the period-instrument ensemble Publick Musick and performs with other organizations such as Pegasus Early Music and NYS Baroque.\n\nEqually accomplished as a modern cellist, Chris is a core member of the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra and has also been a member of the Austin Symphony and the Austin Lyric Opera Orchestra (including as Interim Principal and Acting Principal Cello). He is regularly invited to the Victoria (TX) Bach Festival as both a modern and baroque cellist, and has been principal cellist of both the VBF Orchestra and baroque ensemble.\n\nAlso sought after as a pedagogue, he currently teaches at the Eastman Community Music School, has been on the faculty of Texas State University-San Marcos and the Rochester Institute of Technology, and has given numerous workshops and master classes at colleges and universities including the University of North Texas, the University of Virginia, Luther College, and SUNY-Fredonia.\n\nA native of the San Francisco Bay Area, he holds a B.A. from the University of Chicago, an M.M. from the Cleveland Institute of Music, and a D.M.A. from the Eastman School of Music. His major teachers have included Alan Harris, Marc Johnson, Catharina Meints, Pieter Wispelwey, Steven Doane, and Jaap ter Linden, with whom he studied as a Fulbright Scholar at the Akademie für Alte Musik Bremen.\n\nA native of Germany, Theresa Salomon came to New York in 1993. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung has described her interpretations as “of the highest standard” and praised her “crystal-clear intonation” and “rhythmic precision.” She has performed in numerous international festivals, such as Festival Presence, Paris; Gulbenkian Festival, Lisbon; Prague Spring Festival; Ostfriesland Festival, Germany; Connecticut Early Music Festival; Staunton Chamber Music Festival, Virginia; and Ostrava Days for New Music, Czech Republic, where she was a soloist with the Janáček Philharmonic.

Currently he is the Associate Organist and Choirmaster of Christ Church Cathedral, Nashville, TN and Instructor of Organ and Harpsichord at Vanderbilt’s Blair School of Music. In addition to his organ-related studies with David Higgs, he completed a Master’s Degree in harpsichord performance in the studio of William Porter and a minor field in Collaborative Piano under Jean Barr. He particularly enjoys collaborative work and frequently answers calls to accompany both ensembles and soloists on a wide range of repertoire. He has appeared as a soloist with the Oak Ridge Symphony Orchestra, Knoxville Symphony Orchestra, and Rochester’s Philharmonic Orchestra.

In her junior year of high school she began lessons on the baroque violin with Boel Gidholm; the following year she joined the Schola Cantorum of the Eastman School of Music, with which she performed Gregorian chant and Renaissance and baroque motets for the weekly Office of Compline. She spent one academic year at the Jacobs School of Music in Bloomington, Indiana, during which time she performed regularly with the Bloomington Bach Cantata Project and with Tonos del Sur, an ensemble dedicated to the performance of the earliest music published in Latin America.\n\nElizabeth is now entering the second year of her bachelor’s degree at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis in Basel, Switzerland, studying medieval vielle with Baptiste Romain and baroque violin with Leila Schayegh.
