The Chapel Choir was incorporated in its current form in 1954 and in 1975 Dr Stuart Campbell was appointed University organist and director of the Chapel Choir. Stuart was to hold the position until his retiral in 2000, the year of this recording. The post is now held by Dr Katy Lavinia Cooper who features here as an undergraduate choral scholar.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the usual business of services, weddings and broadcasts, Stuart’s time in charge saw the choir travel extensively to the Czech Republic, England, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Switzerland. The repertoire on &quot;We Were Glad&quot; had been performed prior to recording on a typically memorable German tour.",

        "text": "1.\n\nElegi abjectus esse in domo Dei mei, magis quam habitare in tabernaculis peccatorum. Quia misericordiam et veritatem diligit Deus: gratiam et gloriam dabit Dominus.\n\n2.\n\nAlma Redemptoris Mater quae pervia coeli porta manes, et stella maris, succure cadenti, surgere qui curat populo: tu quae genuisti, natura mirante, tuum sanctum Genitorem, Virgo prius ac posterius, Gabrielis ab ore sumens illud Ave, peccatorum miserere.\n\n3.\n\nIn convertendo Dominus captivitatem Sion, facti sumus sicut consolati. Tunc repletum est gaudio os nostrum, et lingua nostra exultatione: tunc dicet inter gentes, Magnificavit Dominus facere cum eis. Magnificavit Dominus facere nobiscum; facti sumus laetantes. Convertere, Domine, captivitatem nostram, sicur torrens in Austro. Qui reminant in lacrimis, in exultatione metent. Euntes ibant et fiebant, mittentes semina sua, venientes autem venient cum exuhaüone, portantes manipulos suos.\n\n4.\n\nThou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. The eternal gifts of Christ the king, the apostles' glory, let us sing; and all with hearts of gladness, raise due hymns of thankful love and praise. For they the church's princes are, triumphant leaders in the war, in heavenly courts a warrior band, true lights to lighten every land. Theirs is the steadfast faith of saints and hope that never yields or faints, and love of Christ in perfect glow that lays the prince of this world low. In them the Father's glory shone, in them the will of God the Son, in them exults the Heavenly Ghost, through them rejoice the heavenly host. To you, redeemer, now we cry, that you would join to them on high your servants, who this grace implore, for ever and for evermore. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.\n\n5.\n\nRejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice. Let your moderation be known unto all men.The Lord is at hand. Be careful for nothing: but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\n6.\n\nThey that put their trust in the Lord shall be ever as the Mount Sion, which may not be removed, but standeth fast for ever. The hills stand about Jerusalem: even so standeth the Lord round about his people, from this time forth for evermore.\n\n7.\n\nLord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word. For mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou hast prepared before the face of all people. To be a light to lighten the Gentiles and to be the glory of thy people Israel. Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost; as it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.\n\n8.\n\nSing we merrily unto God our strength; make a cheerful noise unto the God of Jacob. Take the psalm, bring hither the tabret: the merry harp with the lute. Blow up the trumpet in the new moon: even in the time appointed, and upon our solemn feast day. For this was made a statute for Israel: and a law of the God of Jacob.\n\n9.\n\nl sing of a maiden that is makeless King ofall kings to her son she ches. I sing of a maiden that is makeless King of all kings to her son she ches. He came all so still. There his mother was Like Dew in April That falleth on the grass. He came all so still To his mother’s bower Like Dew in April That falleth on the grass. He came all so still There his mother lay Like Dew in April That falleth on the grass. Mother and maiden was never none but she, Well may such a Lady God’s mother be. I sing of a maiden that is makeless King of all kings to her son she ches.\n\n10."
