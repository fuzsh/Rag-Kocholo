        "text": "If you missed this excellently performed program of Sebastien de Brossard’s Grands Motets when it was originally released on Astrée in 1997, waste not a moment acquiring this reissue on the recently-formed Laborie label. While primarily recognized as an ecclesiastic, lexicographer, and bibliophile (his many literary accomplishments include compiling the first French music dictionary as well as authoring the celebrated Catalogue des Livres de Musique), Brossard also was an exceptionally gifted composer–a fact that many observers have unfairly downplayed due to his lack of formal training. To compensate, Brossard instead learned nearly everything from years of voraciously collecting and assimilating musical manuals and treatises from throughout Europe, influences that often give his works a fascinating freewheeling edge.\n\nBrossard displays this unique wherewithal throughout these gorgeous motets. Tutti and solo passages often vary widely–such as in the spectacular “Cor mundum…” of the Miserere. At times he’ll introduce German and especially Italian stylistic elements, such as the madrigal-like “Oui Seminant” movement of In Convertendo Dominus. The polyphonic splendour of the broadly paced “Momento, Domine, David” movement of the Canticum Eucharisticum rivals the finest similar efforts by Charpentier, Couperin, LaLande, or any of Brossard’s better-known contemporaries. These are only a few of many moments that attest to Brossard’s rich and varied expertise.\n\nLaborie’s sonics are identical to Astrée’s–exceptionally clear yet warmly resonant, and ideal for these works. The original texts and translations are also intact, though unfortunately the type is minuscule and the design makes the English and Spanish especially difficult to read. Regardless, this is a must for all French Baroque vocal/choral music fans and is highly recommended."
