The programme, illustrating the transition from sorrow to joy and from darkness into light, was recorded in the splendid Chapelle Royale of the palace of Versailles. When Haïm, Le Concert d’Astrée and the soloists who appear on this recording performed all three works in Dijon, where Rameau was born, Forum Opéra – noting that Haïm’s conducting “excelled as much through its vigour as its poetry” – described “a concert from which one emerged with a profound sense of happiness”."
