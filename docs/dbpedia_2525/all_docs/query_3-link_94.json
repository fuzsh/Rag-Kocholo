Using as points of departure the progressions into Milan of Charles V (1541), Philip II (1548), Margarita of Austria (1598), and Mariana of Austria (1549), the obsequies in Milan for Charles V (1559), Anna of Austria (1581), and Philip III (1621), and the Milanese celebrations for the birth of the future Philip IV (1605), this chapter explores the use of music and musical entertainments in expressing Habsburg sovereignty in Milan.",
