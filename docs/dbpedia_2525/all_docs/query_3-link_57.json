        "text": "DE MENDACIO Translated by H. Browne. From Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, First Series, Vol. 3. Edited by Philip Schaff. (Buffalo, NY: Christian Literature Publishing Co., 1887.) Materiae pertractandae difficultas. [1.1] Magna quaestio est de mendacio, quae nos in ipsis quotidianis actibus nostris saepe conturbat: ne aut temere accusemus mendacium, quod non est mendacium; aut arbitremur aliquando esse mentiendum, honesto quodam et officioso ac misericordi mendacio. Quam quaestionem tam sollicite pertractabimus, ut quaeramus cum quaerentibus: utrum autem aliquantum inveniamus, nihil nobis temere affirmantibus, lectori bene attendenti satis indicabit ipsa tractatio: latebrosa est enim nimis et quibusdam quasi cavernosis anfractibus saepe intentionem quaerentis eludit; ut modo velut elabatur e manibus quod inventum erat, modo rursus appareat, et rursus absorbeatur. Ad extremum tamen sententiam nostram velut certior indago comprehendet. In qua si ullus error est, cum ab omni errore veritas liberet, atque in omni errore falsitas implicet; nunquam errari tutius existimo, quam cum in amore nimio veritatis et reiectione nimia falsitatis erratur. Qui enim seuere reprehendunt, hoc nimium dicunt esse: ipsa autem veritas fortasse adhuc dicat: Nondum est satis. Sane quisquis legis, nihil reprehendas, nisi cum totum legeris; atque ita minus reprehendes. Eloquium noli quaerere: multum enim de rebus laboravimus, et de celeritate absoluendi tam necessarii quotidianae vitae operis; unde tenuis, ac prope nulla fuit nobis cura verborum. 1. There is a great question about Lying, which often arises in the midst of our every day business, and gives us much trouble, that we may not either rashly call that a lie which is not such, or decide that it is sometimes right to tell a lie, that is, a kind of honest, well-meant, charitable lie. This question we will painfully discuss by seeking with them that seek: whether to any good purpose, we need not take upon ourselves to affirm, for the attentive reader will sufficiently gather from the course of the discussion. It is, indeed, very full of dark corners, and has many cavern-like windings, whereby it oft eludes the eagerness of the seeker; so that at one moment what was found seems to slip out of one's hands, and anon comes to light again, and then is once more lost to sight. At last, however, the chase will bear down more surely, and will overtake our sentence. Wherein if there is any error, yet as Truth is that which sets free from all error, and Falsehood that which entangles in all error, one never errs more safely, methinks, than when one errs by too much loving the truth, and too much rejecting of falsehood. For they who find great fault say it is too much, whereas perhaps Truth would say after all, it is not yet enough. But whoso readest, you will do well to find no fault until you have read the whole; so will you have less fault to find. Eloquence you must not look for: we have been intent upon things, and upon dispatch in putting out of hand a matter which nearly concerns our every day life, and therefore have had small pains, or almost none, to bestow upon words. Ioci non sunt mendacia. [2.2] Exceptis igitur iocis, quae nunquam sunt putata mendacia: habent enim evidentissimam ex pronuntiatione atque ipso iocantis affectu significationem animi nequaquam fallentis, etsi non vera enuntiantis: quo genere utrum sit utendum perfectis animis, alia quaestio est, quam modo enodandam non suscepimus: exceptis ergo iocis, prius agendum est, ne mentiri existimetur qui non mentitur. 2. Setting aside, therefore, jokes, which have never been accounted lies, seeing they bear with them in the tone of voice, and in the very mood of the joker a most evident indication that he means no deceit, although the thing he utters be not true: touching which kind of discourse, whether it be meet to be used by perfect minds, is another question which we have not at this time taken in hand to clear; but setting jokes apart, the first point to be attended to, is, that a person should not be thought to lie, who lies not. Quid sit mendacium. Ad mendacium an in loquente voluntas fallendi requiratur vel sufficiat. [3.3] Quapropter videndum est quid sit mendacium. Non enim omnis qui falsum dicit mentitur, si credit aut opinatur verum esse quod dicit. Inter credere autem atque opinari hoc distat, quod aliquando ille qui credit, sentit se ignorare quod credit, quamvis de re quam se ignorare novit omnino non dubitet, si eam firmissime credit; qui autem opinatur, putat se scire quod nescit. Quisquis autem hoc enuntiat quod vel creditum animo, vel opinatum tenet, etiamsi falsum sit, non mentitur. Hoc enim debet enuntiationis suae fidei, ut illud per eam proferat, quod animo tenet, et sic habet ut profert. Nec ideo tamen sine vitio est, quamvis non mentiatur, si aut non credenda credit, aut quod ignorat nosse se putat, etiamsi verum sit: incognitum enim habet pro cognito. Quapropter ille mentitur, qui aliud habet in animo, et aliud verbis vel quibuslibet significationibus enuntiat. Unde etiam duplex cor dicitur esse mentientis, id est, duplex cogitatio: una rei eius quam veram esse vel scit vel putat, et non profert; altera eius rei quam pro ista profert sciens falsam esse vel putans. Ex quo fit ut possit falsum dicere non mentiens, si putat ita esse ut dicit, quamvis non ita sit; et ut possit verum dicere mentiens, si putat falsum esse et pro vero enuntiat, quamvis reuera ita sit ut enuntiat. Ex animi enim sui sententia, non ex rerum ipsarum veritate vel falsitate mentiens aut non mentiens iudicandus est. Potest itaque ille qui falsum pro vero enuntiat, quod tamen verum esse opinatur, errans dici et temerarius: mentiens autem non recte dicitur; quia cor duplex cum enuntiat non habet, nec fallere cupit, sed fallitur. Culpa vero mentientis est, in enuntiando animo suo fallendi cupiditas; sive fallat cum ei creditur falsum enuntianti; sive non fallat, vel cum ei non creditur, vel cum verum enuntiat voluntate fallendi, quod non putat verum. Quod cum ei creditur, non utique fallit, quamvis fallere voluerit: nisi hactenus fallit, quatenus putatur ita etiam nosse vel putare ut enuntiat. 3. For which purpose we must see what a lie is. For not every one who says a false thing lies, if he believes or opines that to be true which he says. Now between believing and opining there is this difference, that sometimes he who believes feels that he does not know that which he believes, (although he may know himself to be ignorant of a thing, and yet have no doubt at all concerning it, if he most firmly believes it:) whereas he who opines, thinks he knows that which he does not know. Now whoever utters that which he holds in his mind either as belief or as opinion, even though it be false, he lies not. For this he owes to the faith of his utterance, that he thereby produce that which he holds in his mind, and has in that way in which he produces it. Not that he is without fault, although he lie not, if either he believes what he ought not to believe, or thinks he knows what he knows not, even though it should be true: for he accounts an unknown thing for a known. Wherefore, that man lies, who has one thing in his mind and utters another in words, or by signs of whatever kind. Whence also the heart of him who lies is said to be double; that is, there is a double thought: the one, of that thing which he either knows or thinks to be true and does not produce; the other, of that thing which he produces instead thereof, knowing or thinking it to be false. Whence it comes to pass, that he may say a false thing and yet not lie, if he thinks it to be so as he says although it be not so; and, that he may say a true thing, and yet lie, if he thinks it to be false and utters it for true, although in reality it be so as he utters it. For from the sense of his own mind, not from the verity or falsity of the things themselves, is he to be judged to lie or not to lie. Therefore he who utters a false thing for a true, which however he opines to be true, may be called erring and rash: but he is not rightly said to lie; because he has not a double heart when he utters it, neither does he wish to deceive, but is deceived. But the fault of him who lies, is, the desire of deceiving in the uttering of his mind; whether he do deceive, in that he is believed when uttering the false thing; or whether he do not deceive, either in that he is not believed, or in that he utters a true thing with will to deceive, which he does not think to be true: wherein being believed, he does not deceive though it was his will to deceive: except that he deceives in so far as he is thought to know or think as he utters. [3.4] Quamquam subtilissime quaeratur utrum cum abest voluntas fallendi, absit omnino mendacium. 4. But it may be a very nice question whether in the absence of all will to deceive, lying is altogether absent. Mentiri num aliquando prosit aut liceat. [4.4] Quid enim si quisque falsum loquens, quod falsum esse existimat, ideo tamen facit, quia putat sibi non credi, ut eo modo falsa fide absterreat eum cui loquitur, quem sentit sibi nolle credere? Hic enim studio non fallendi mentitur, si mendacium est enuntiare aliquid aliter quam scis esse vel putas; si autem mendacium non est nisi cum aliquid enuntiatur voluntate fallendi, non mentitur iste, qui propterea falsum loquitur, quamvis noverit vel putet falsum esse quod loquitur, ut ille cui loquitur non ei credendo non fallatur, quia eum sibi non crediturum vel scit vel putat. Thus, put the case that a person shall speak a false thing, which he esteems to be false, on the ground that he thinks he is not believed, to the intent, that in that way falsifying his faith he may deter the person to whom he speaks, which person he perceives does not choose to believe him. For here is a person who tells a lie with studied purpose of not deceiving, if to tell a lie is to utter any thing otherwise than you know or think it to be. But if it be no lie, unless when something is uttered with wish to deceive, that person lies not, who says a false thing, knowing or thinking it to be false, but says it on purpose that the person to whom he speaks by not believing him may not be deceived, because the speaker either knows or thinks the other will not believe him. Unde si appareat fieri posse ut aliquis propterea falsum dicat, ne fallatur ille cui dicitur; existit aliud e contrario genus, propterea verum dicentis ut fallat. Qui enim verum ideo loquitur, quia sentit sibi non credi, ideo utique verum dicit ut fallat; scit enim vel existimat propterea falsum putari posse quod dicitur, quoniam ab ipso dicitur. Quamobrem cum ideo verum dicit ut falsum putetur, ideo verum dicit ut fallat. Quaerendum ergo est, quis potius mentiatur: utrum ille qui falsum dicit ne fallat, an ille qui verum dicit ut fallat; cum et ille sciat vel putet falsum se dicere, et iste sciat vel putet verum se dicere. Iam enim diximus eum qui nescit falsum esse quod enuntiat, non mentiri, si hoc putat verum; eumque potius mentiri, qui etiam verum enuntiat, cum falsum putat: quia ex animi sui sententia iudicandi sunt. Whence if it appear to be possible that a person should say a false thing on purpose that he to whom it is said may not be deceived, on the other hand there is this opposite case, the case of a person saying the truth on purpose that he may deceive. For if a man determines to say a true thing because he perceives he is not believed, that man speaks truth on purpose that he may deceive: for he knows or thinks that what is said may be accounted false, just because it is spoken by him. Wherefore in saying a true thing on purpose that it may be thought false, he says a true thing on purpose to deceive. So that it may be inquired, which rather lies: he who says a false thing that he may not deceive, or he who says a true thing that he may deceive? The one knowing or thinking that he says a false thing, and the other knowing or thinking that he says a true thing? For we have already said that the person who does not know the thing to be false which he utters, does not lie if he thinks it to be true; and that that person rather lies who utters even a true thing when he thinks it false: because it is by the sense of their mind that they are to be judged. De illis itaque non parua quaestio est, quos proposuimus: unum qui scit aut putat se falsum dicere, et ideo dicit ne fallat; velut si aliquam viam noverit obsideri a latronibus, et timens ne per illam pergat homo cuius saluti prospicit, et eum scit sibi non credere, dicat eam viam non habere latrones, ad hoc ut illac non eat, dum ideo credit latrones ibi esse, quia ille dixit non ibi esse, cui non credere statuit, mendacem putans; alterum autem qui sciens aut putans verum esse quod dicit, ad hoc tamen dicit ut fallat; tamquam si homini non sibi credenti dicat latrones in illa via esse ubi reuera eos esse cognovit, ut ille cui dicit per illam viam magis pergat, atque ita in latrones incidat, dum putat falsum esse quod ille dixerit. Quis ergo istorum mentitur; ille qui elegit falsum dicere ne fallat, an ille qui elegit verum dicere ut fallat? ille qui falsum dicendo egit ut verum sequeretur cui dixit, an iste qui verum dicendo egit ut falsum sequeretur cui dixit? An forte ambo mentiti sunt; ille quia voluit falsum dicere, iste quia voluit fallere? An potius neuter eorum mentitus est; ille quia voluntatem habuit non fallendi, et ille quia voluntatem habuit verum dicendi? Non enim nunc agitur quis eorum peccaverit, sed quis mentitus sit. Cito enim videtur ille peccasse, qui verum dicendo egit ut homo incideret in latrones: ille autem non peccasse, vel etiam bene fecisse, qui falsum dicendo egit ut homo perniciem devitaret. Concerning these persons therefore, whom we have set forth, there is no small question. The one, who knows or thinks he says a false thing, and says it on purpose that he may not deceive: as, if he knows a certain road to be beset by robbers, and fearing lest some person for whose safety he is anxious should go by that road, which person he knows does not trust him, should tell him that that road has no robbers, on purpose that he may not go by it, as he will think there are robbers there precisely because the other has told him there are none, and he is resolved not to believe him, accounting him a liar. The other, who knowing or thinking that to be true which he says, says it on purpose that he may deceive: for instance, if he tells a person who does not believe him, that there are robbers in that road where he really knows them to be, that he to whom he tells it may the rather go by that road and so fall among robbers, because he thinks that to be false, which the other told him. Which then of these lies? The one who has chosen to say a false thing that he may not deceive? Or the other who has chosen to say a true thing that he may deceive? That one, who in saying a false thing aimed that he to whom he spoke should follow the truth? Or this one, who in saying a true thing aimed that he to whom he spoke should follow a falsehood? Or haply have both lied? The one, because he wished to say a false thing: the other, because he wished to deceive? Or rather, has neither lied? Not the one, because he had the will not to deceive: not the other, because he had the will to speak the truth? For the question is not now which of them sinned, but which of them lied: as indeed it is presently seen that the latter sinned, because by speaking a truth he brought it about that a person should fall among robbers, and that the former has not sinned, or even has done good, because by speaking a false thing he has been the means of a person's avoiding destruction. Sed possunt exempla ista converti, ut et ille aliquid gravius eum pati velit quem falli non vult; multi enim vera quaedam cognoscendo sibi intulerunt perniciem, si talia fuerunt ut eos latere debuerint: et iste aliquid commodi velit adipisci eum quem vult falli; nonnulli enim qui sibi mortem intulissent, si aliquid mali quod vere contigerat de caris suis cognovissent, falsum putando sibi pepercerunt; atque ita falli eis profuit, sicut aliis obfuit vera cognoscere. But then these instances may be turned the other way, so that the one should be supposed to wish some more grievous suffering to the person whom he wishes not to be deceived; for there are many cases of persons who through knowing certain things to be true, have brought destruction upon themselves, if the things were such as ought to have continued unknown to them: and the other may be supposed to wish some convenience to result to the person whom he wishes to be deceived; for there have been instances of persons who would have destroyed themselves had they known some evil that had really befallen those who were dear to them, and through deeming it false have spared themselves: and so to be deceived has been a benefit to them, as to others it has been a hurt to know the truth. Non ergo id agitur, quo animo consulendi aut nocendi, vel ille falsum dixit ne falleret, vel iste verum dixit ut falleret: sed exceptis commodis aut incommodis eorum quibus locuti sunt, quantum ad ipsam veritatem falsitatemque attinet, quaeritur quis eorum, an uterque, neuterue mentitus sit. Si enim mendacium est enuntiatio cum voluntate falsum enuntiandi, ille potius mentitus est qui falsum dicere voluit, et dixit quod voluit, quamvis ne falleret dixerit: si autem mendacium est quaelibet enuntiatio cum voluntate fallendi, non ille, sed iste mentitus est, qui etiam verum dicendo fallere voluit: quod si mendacium est enuntiatio cum voluntate alicuius falsitatis, ambo mentiti sunt; quia et ille suam enuntiationem falsam esse voluit, et ille de vera sua falsum credi voluit: porro si mendacium est enuntiatio falsum enuntiare volentis ut fallat, neuter mentitus est; quia et ille habuit voluntatem falsum dicendo verum persuadere, et iste, ut falsum persuaderet, verum dicere. Aberit igitur omnis temeritas atque omne mendacium, cum et id quod verum credendumque cognovimus, cum opus est enuntiamus, et id volumus persuadere quod enuntiamus. Si autem vel quod falsum est verum putantes, vel quod incognitum est nobis pro cognito habentes, vel quod credendum non est credentes, vel cum id non opus est enuntiantes, tamen non aliud quam id quod enuntiamus persuadere conamur: non abest quidem temeritatis error, sed abest omne mendacium. Nulla enim definitionum illarum timenda est, cum bene sibi conscius est animus, hoc se enuntiare quod verum esse aut novit, aut opinatur, aut credit, neque velle aliquid, nisi quod enuntiat, persuadere. The question therefore is not with what purpose of doing a kindness or a hurt, either the one said a false thing that he might not deceive, or the other a true thing that he might deceive: but, setting apart the convenience or inconvenience of the persons spoken to, in so far as relates to the very truth and falsehood, the question is, whether both of them or neither has lied. For if a lie is an utterance with will of uttering a false thing, that man has rather lied who willed to say a false thing, and said what he willed, albeit he said it of set purpose not to deceive. But if a lie is any utterance whatever with will to deceive; then not the former has lied, but the latter, who even in speaking truth willed to deceive. And if a lie is an utterance with will of any falsity, both have lied; because both the former willed his utterance to be false, and the latter willed a false thing to be believed concerning his utterance which was true. Further, if a lie is an utterance of a person wishing to utter a false thing that he may deceive, neither has lied; because both the former in saying a false thing had the will to make a true thing believed, and the latter to say a true thing in order that he might make a false thing believed. We shall be clear then of all rashness and all lying, if, what we know to be true or right to be believed, we utter when need is, and wish to make that thing believed which we utter. If, however, either thinking that to be true which is false, or accounting as known that which is to us unknown, or believing what we ought not to believe, or uttering it when need is not, we yet have no other aim than to make that believed which we utter; we do not stand clear indeed of the error of temerity, but we do stand clear of all lying. For there is no need to be afraid of any of those definitions, when the mind has a good conscience, that it utters that which to be true it either knows, or opines, or believes, and that it has no wish to make any thing believed but that which it utters. Utrum sit utile aliquando mendacium, multo maior magisque necessaria quaestio est. [4.5] Sed utrum sit utile aliquando mendacium, multo maior magisque necessaria quaestio est. Utrum ergo mentiatur quisquis fallendi non habet voluntatem, vel etiam id agit ne fallatur cui aliquid enuntiat, quamvis enuntiationem ipsam falsam habere voluerit, quia ideo voluit ut verum persuaderet; et utrum mentiatur quisquis etiam verum volens enuntiat causa fallendi, dubitari potest. Nemo autem dubitat mentiri eum qui volens falsum enuntiat causa fallendi: quapropter enuntiationem falsam cum voluntate ad fallendum prolatam, manifestum est esse mendacium. Sed utrum hoc solum sit mendacium, alia quaestio est. 5. But whether a lie be at some times useful, is a much greater and more concerning question. Whether, as above, it be a lie, when a person has no will to deceive, or even makes it his business that the person to whom he says a thing shall not be deceived although he did wish the thing itself which he uttered to be false, but this on purpose that he might cause a truth to be believed; whether, again, it be a lie when a person willingly utters even a truth for the purpose of deceiving; this may be doubted. But none doubts that it is a lie when a person willingly utters a falsehood for the purpose of deceiving: wherefore a false utterance put forth with will to deceive is manifestly a lie. But whether this alone be a lie, is another question. Opinio affirmans mentiendum esse nonnunquam. [5.5] Interim de hoc genere, in quod omnes consentiunt, inquiramus: utrum aliquando sit utile falsum aliquid enuntiare cum voluntate fallendi. Nam qui hoc sentiunt, adhibent testimonia sententiae suae, commemorantes Saram cum risisset, angelis negasse quod riserit; Iacob a patre interrogatum, respondisse quod ipse esset Esau maior filius eius; Aegyptias quoque obstetrices, ne infantes Hebraei nascentes interficerentur, etiam Deo approbante et remunerante mentitas; et multa eiusmodi exempla eligentes, eorum hominum mendacia commemorant, quos culpare non audeas, atque ita fatearis aliquando esse posse non solum reprehensione non dignum, sed etiam dignum laude mendacium. Addunt etiam, quo non solos premant divinis Libris deditos, sed etiam omnes homines sensumque communem, dicentes: Si quis ad te confugiat, qui mendacio tuo possit a morte liberari, non es mentiturus? Si aliquid aegrotus interroget quod ei scire non expedit, qui etiam te non respondente possit gravius affligi; audebisne aut verum dicere in perniciem hominis, aut silere potius quam honesto et misericordi mendacio valetudini eius opitulari? His atque talibus copiosissime se arbitrantur urgere, ut si consulendi causa exigit, aliquando mentiamur. Meanwhile, taking this kind of lie, in which all agree, let us inquire, whether it be sometimes useful to utter a falsehood with will to deceive. They who think it is, advance testimonies to their opinion, by alleging the case of Sarah, who, when she had laughed, denied to the Angels that she laughed: of Jacob questioned by his father, and answering that he was the elder son Esau: likewise that of the Egyptian midwives, who to save the Hebrew infants from being slain at their birth, told a lie, and that with God's approbation and reward: and many such like instances they pick out, of lies told by persons whom you would not dare to blame, and so must own that it may sometimes be not only not blameworthy, but even praiseworthy to tell a lie. They add also a case with which to urge not only those who are devoted to the Divine Books, but all men and common sense, saying, Suppose a man should take refuge with you, who by your lie might be saved from death, would you not tell it? If a sick man should ask a question which it is not expedient that he should know, and might be more grievously afflicted even by your returning him no answer, will you venture either to tell the truth to the destruction of the man's life, or rather to hold your peace, than by a virtuous and merciful lie to be serviceable to his weak health? By these and such like arguments they think they most plentifully prove, that if occasion of doing good require, we may sometimes tell a lie. Opinio negans esse unquam mentiendum. [5.6] Contra, illi quibus placet nunquam mentiendum, multo fortius agunt, utentes primo auctoritate divina, quoniam in ipso Decalogo scriptum est: Falsum testimonium ne dicas; quo genere complectitur omne mendacium: quisquis enim aliquid enuntiat, testimonium perhibet animo suo. Sed ne quis contendat non omne mendacium falsum testimonium esse appellandum; quid dicturus est ad id quod scriptum est: Os quod mentitur occidit animam? quod ne quis arbitretur exceptis aliquibus mentientibus posse intellegi, alio loco legat: Perdes omnes qui loquuntur mendacium. Unde ore suo ipse Dominus: Sit, inquit, in ore uestro: Est, est; Non, non; quod autem amplius est, a malo est. Hinc et Apostolus cum exuendum veterem hominem praeciperet, quo nomine omnia peccata intelleguntur, consequenter ait, in primis ponens: Quapropter deponentes mendacium, loquimini veritatem. 6. On the other hand, those who say that we must never lie, plead much more strongly, using first the Divine authority, because in the very Decalogue it is written You shall not bear false witness; under which general term it comprises all lying: for whoso utters any thing bears witness to his own mind. But lest any should contend that not every lie is to be called false witness, what will he say to that which is written, The mouth that lies slays the soul: and lest any should suppose that this may be understood with the exception of some liars, let him read in another place, You will destroy all that speak leasing. Whence with His own lips the Lord says, Let your communication be yea, yea; nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than these comes of evil. Hence the Apostle also in giving precept for the putting off of the old man, under which name all sins are understood, says straightway, Wherefore putting away lying, speak ye truth. Exempla pro mendacio ex Veteri Testamento allata discutiuntur. [5.7] Nec illis quae de ueteribus Libris mendaciorum exempla prolata sunt, terreri se dicunt; ubi quidquid gestum est, figurate accipi potest, quamvis reuera contigerit: quidquid autem figurate fit aut dicitur, non est mendacium. Omnis enim enuntiatio, ad id quod enuntiat, referenda est. Omne autem figurate aut factum aut dictum hoc enuntiat quod significat eis quibus intellegendum prolatum est. Unde credendum est illos homines qui propheticis temporibus digni auctoritate fuisse commemorantur, omnia quae scripta sunt de illis, prophetice gessisse atque dixisse: nec minus prophetice eis accidisse, quaecumque sic acciderunt, ut eodem prophetico Spiritu memoriae litterisque mandanda iudicarentur. 7. Neither do they confess that they are awed by those citations from the Old Testament which are alleged as examples of lies: for there, every incident may possibly be taken figuratively, although it really did take place: and when a thing is either done or said figuratively, it is no lie. For every utterance is to be referred to that which it utters. But when any thing is either done or said figuratively, it utters that which it signifies to those for whose understanding it was put forth. Whence we may believe in regard of those persons of the prophetical times who are set forth as authoritative, that in all that is written of them they acted and spoke prophetically; and no less, that there is a prophetical meaning in all those incidents of their lives which by the same prophetic Spirit have been accounted worthy of being recorded in writing. De obstetricibus autem, quia non eas possunt dicere prophetico Spiritu significandi futuri veri gratia, aliud pro alio renuntiasse Pharaoni, etiamsi aliquid ipsis nescientibus quod per eas actum est significavit, pro gradu suo dicunt approbatas et remuneratas a Deo. Qui enim nocendi causa mentiri solet, si iam consulendi causa mentiatur, multum profecit. Sed aliud est quod per se ipsum laudabile proponitur, aliud quod in deterioris comparatione praeponitur. Aliter enim gratulamur cum sanus est homo, aliter cum melius habet aegrotus. Nam in Scripturis ipsis iustificata etiam Sodoma dicitur in comparatione scelerum populi Israel 9. Et ad hanc regulam dirigunt omnia mendacia quae proferuntur de ueteribus Libris, nec reprehensa inveniuntur, vel reprehendi non possunt, ut aut indole proficientium et spe approbentur, aut significationis alicuius causa non sint omnino mendacia. Mentiendi exemplum ex Testamento Novo nullum suppetere. Timothei circumcisio non per simulationem facta. Petrus libenter correctus a Paulo. As to the midwives, indeed, they cannot say that these women did through the prophetic Spirit, with purpose of signifying a future truth, tell Pharaoh one thing instead of another, (albeit that Spirit did signify something, without their knowing what was doing in their persons:) but, they say that these women were according to their degree approved and rewarded of God. For if a person who is used to tell lies for harm's sake comes to tell them for the sake of doing good, that person has made great progress. But it is one thing that is set forth as laudable in itself, another that in comparison with a worse is preferred. It is one sort of gratulation that we express when a man is in sound health, another when a sick man is getting better. In the Scripture, even Sodom is said to be justified in comparison with the crimes of the people Israel. And to this rule they apply all the instances of lying which are produced from the Old Books, and are found not reprehended, or cannot be reprehended: either they are approved on the score of a progress towards improvement and hope of better things, or in virtue of some hidden signification they are not altogether lies. [5.8] Et ideo de libris Novi Testamenti, exceptis figuratis significationibus Domini, si vitam moresque sanctorum et facta ac dicta consideres, nihil tale proferri potest, quod ad imitationem prouocet mentiendi. Simulatio enim Petri et Barnabae non solum commemorata, verum etiam reprehensa atque correcta est. Non enim, ut nonnulli putant, ex eadem simulatione etiam Paulus apostolus aut Timotheum circumcidit, aut ipse quaedam ritu Iudaico sacramenta celebravit; sed ex illa libertate sententiae suae, qua praedicavit nec Gentibus prodesse circumcisionem, nec Iudaeis obesse. Unde nec illos astringendos ad consuetudinem Iudaeorum, nec illos a paterna deterrendos censuit. Unde illa verba eius sunt: Circumcisus quis vocatus est? non adducat praeputium. In praeputio quis vocatus est? non circumcidatur. Circumcisio nihil est, et praeputium nihil est; sed observatio mandatorum Dei. Unusquisque in qua vocatione vocatus est, in ea permaneat. Quomodo enim potest adduci praeputium quod praecisum est? Sed non adducat dixit, non ita vivat, quasi praeputium adduxerit; id est, quasi in eam partem quam nudavit, rursus tegmen carnis attraxerit, et quasi Iudaeus esse destiterit; sicut alibi dicit: Circumcisio tua praeputium facta est. 8. For this reason, from the books of the New Testament, except the figurative pre-significations used by our Lord, if you consider the life and manners of the Saints, their actions and sayings, nothing of the kind can be produced which should provoke to imitation of lying. For the simulation of Peter and Barnabas is not only recorded, but also reproved and corrected. For it was not, as some suppose, out of the same simulation that even Paul the Apostle either circumcised Timothy, or himself celebrated certain ceremonies according to the Jewish rite; but he did so, out of that liberty of his mind whereby he preached that neither are the Gentiles the better for circumcision, nor the Jews the worse. Wherefore he judged that neither the former should be tied to the custom of the Jews, nor the Jews deterred from the custom of their fathers. Whence are those words of his: Is any man called being circumcised let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised. Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called. How can a man become uncircumcised after circumcision? But let him not do so, says he: let him not so live as if he had become uncircumcised, that is, as if he had covered again with flesh the part that was bared, and ceased to be a Jew; as in another place he says, Your circumcision has become uncircumcision. Et hoc non tamquam cogens dixit Apostolus, aut illos manere in praeputio, aut Iudaeos in consuetudine patrum suorum: sed ut neutri in alteram cogerentur; potestatem autem haberet quisque manendi in sua consuetudine, non necessitatem. Neque enim si vellet Iudaeus, ubi nullum perturbaret, recedere a Iudaicis observationibus, prohiberetur ab Apostolo; quandoquidem consilium in eis permanendi ad hoc dedit, ne superfluis perturbati Iudaei, ad ea quae saluti essent necessaria non venirent. Neque ab illo prohiberetur si vellet quisquam Gentilium ideo circumcidi, ut hoc ipsum ostenderet non se detestari quasi noxium, sed indifferenter habere tamquam signaculum, cuius utilitas iam tempore praeterisset: non enim, si salus ex eo iam nulla esset, etiam exitium inde metuendum fuit. Ideoque et Timotheus cum in praeputio vocatus esset, tamen quia de Iudaea matre ortus erat, et ostendere cognatis suis debebat ad eos lucrifaciendos, non hoc se didicisse in disciplina christiana, ut illa sacramenta quae Legis ueteris essent abominaretur, circumcisus est ab Apostolo: ut hoc modo demonstrarent Iudaeis, non ideo Gentes non ea suscipere, quia mala sunt et perniciose a patribus observata; sed quia iam saluti non necessaria post adventum tanti sacramenti, quod per tam longa tempora tota uetus illa Scriptura propheticis figurationibus parturivit. And this the Apostle said, not as though he would compel either those to remain in uncircumcision, or the Jews in the custom of their fathers: but that neither these nor those should be forced to the other custom; and, each should have power of abiding in his own custom, not necessity of so doing. For neither if the Jew should wish, where it would disturb no man, to recede from Jewish observances, would he be prohibited by the Apostle, since the object of his counselling to abide therein was that Jews might not by being troubled about superfluous things be hindered from coming to those things which are necessary to salvation. Neither would it be prohibited by him, if any of the Gentiles should wish to be circumcised for the purpose of showing that he does not detest the same as noxious, but holds it indifferently, as a seal, the usefulness of which had already passed away with time; for it did not follow that, if there were now no salvation to be had from it, there was destruction to be dreaded therefrom. And for this reason, Timothy, having been called in uncircumcision, yet because his mother was a Jewess and he was bound, in order to gain his kindred, to show them that he had not learned in the Christian discipline to abominate the sacraments of the old Law, was circumcised by the Apostle; that in this way they might prove to the Jews, that the reason why the Gentiles do not receive them, is not that they are evil and were perniciously observed by the Fathers, but because they are no longer necessary to salvation after the advent of that so great Sacrament, which through so long times the whole of that ancient Scripture in its prophetical prefigurations did travail in birth withal. Nam et Titum circumcideret, cum hoc urgerent Iudaei, nisi subintroducti falsi fratres ideo fieri vellent, ut haberent quod de ipso Paulo disseminarent, tamquam eorum veritati cesserit, qui spem salutis euangelicae in circumcisione carnis atque eiusmodi observationibus esse praedicarent, et sine his nemini Christum prodesse contenderent: cum contra nihil prodesset Christus eis qui eo animo circumciderentur, ut ibi esse salutem putarent; unde est illud: Ecce ego Paulus dico vobis, quia si circumcidamini, Christus nihil vobis proderit. Ex hac igitur libertate Paulus paternas observationes observavit, hoc unum cavens et praedicans, ne sine his salus christiana nulla putaretur. Petrus autem simulatione sua, tamquam in Iudaismo salus esset, cogebat Gentes iudaizare; quod verba Pauli ostendunt dicentis: Quomodo gentes cogis iudaizare? For he would circumcise Titus also, when the Jews urged this, but that false brethren, privily brought in, wished it to be done to the intent they might have it to disseminate concerning Paul himself as a token that he had given place to the truth of their preaching, who said that the hope of Gospel salvation is in circumcision of the flesh and observances of that kind, and that without these Christ profits no man: whereas on the contrary Christ would nothing profit them, who should be circumcised because they thought that in it was salvation; whence that saying, Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. Out of this liberty, therefore, did Paul keep the observances of his fathers, but with this one precaution and express declaration, that people should not suppose that without these was no Christian salvation. Peter, however, by his making as though salvation consisted in Judaism, was compelling the Gentiles to judaize; as is shown by Paul's words, where he says, Why do you compel the Gentiles to live as do the Jews? Non enim cogerentur, nisi viderent eum sic eas observare, quasi praeter illas salus esse non posset. Petri ergo simulatio libertati Pauli non est comparanda. Et ideo Petrum amare debemus libenter correctum, non autem astruere etiam de Pauli auctoritate mendacium: quia et Petrum coram omnibus in rectam viam reuocavit, ne Gentes per eum iudaizare cogerentur; et ipse suae praedicationi attestatus est, qui cum putaretur hostis paternarum traditionum, eo quod nolebat eas imponere Gentibus, non aspernatus eas ipse more patrio celebrare, satis ostendit hoc in eis Christo adveniente remansisse, ut nec Iudaeis essent perniciosae, nec Gentibus necessariae, nec iam cuiquam hominum salutares. For they would be under no compulsion unless they saw that he observed them in such manner as if beside them could be no salvation. Peter's simulation therefore is not to be compared to Paul's liberty. And while we ought to love Peter for that he willingly received correction, we must not bolster up lying even by the authority of Paul, who both recalled Peter to the right path in the presence of them all, lest the Gentiles through him should be compelled to judaize; and bore witness to his own preaching, that whereas he was accounted hostile to the traditions of the fathers in that he would not impose them on the Gentiles, he did not despise to celebrate them himself according to the custom of his fathers, and therein sufficiently showed that this has remained in them at the Coming of Christ; that neither to the Jews they are pernicious, nor to the Gentiles necessary, nor henceforth to any of mankind means of salvation. Auctoritatem mentiendi non magis communis vitae quam Scripturarum exemplis astrui posse. [5.9] Quod si auctoritas mentiendi nec de antiquis Libris proferri potest, vel quia non est mendacium quod figurate gestum dictumue recipitur, vel quia bonis ad imitandum non proponitur quod in malis, cum proficere coeperint, in peioris comparatione laudatur; nec de Novi Testamenti libris, quia correctio potius quam simulatio, sicut lacrymae potius quam negatio Petri est imitanda. 9. But if no authority for lying can be alleged, neither from the ancient Books, be it because that is not a lie which is received to have been done or said in a figurative sense, or be it because good men are not challenged to imitate that which in bad men, beginning to amend, is praised in comparison with the worse; nor yet from the books of the New Testament, because Peter's correction rather than his simulation, even as his tears rather than his denial, is what we must imitate: Mendacium esse iniquitatem, et mortem animae afferre, nec proinde admittendum pro cuiusquam salute temporali. [6.9] Iam illis exemplis, quae de communi vita proferuntur, multo confidentius asserunt non esse credendum. Prius enim docent iniquitatem esse mendacium, multis documentis Litterarum sanctarum, et eo maxime quod scriptum est: Odisti, Domine, omnes qui operantur iniquitatem; perdes omnes qui loquuntur mendacium. Aut enim, ut solet Scriptura, sequenti versu exposuit superiorem; ut quoniam latius solet patere iniquitas, intellegamus nominato mendacio tamquam speciem iniquitatis significare voluerit: aut si aliquid interesse arbitrantur, tanto peius est mendacium, quanto gravius positum est perdes, quam odisti. Forte enim odit aliquem Deus aliquanto mitius, ut eum non perdat: quem vero perdit, tanto uehementius odit, quanto seuerius punit. Odit autem omnes qui operantur iniquitatem: at omnes qui loquuntur mendacium etiam perdit. Quo constituto, quis eorum qui haec asserunt commovebitur illis exemplis, cum dicitur: Quid si ad te homo confugiat, qui mendacio tuo possit a morte liberari? then, as to those examples which are fetched from common life, they assert much more confidently that there is no trust to be given to these. For first they teach, that a lie is iniquity, by many proofs of holy writ, especially by that which is written, You, Lord, hatest all workers of iniquity, you shall destroy them that speak leasing. For either as the Scripture is wont, in the following clause it expounds the former; so that, as iniquity is a term of a wider meaning, leasing is named as the particular sort of iniquity intended: or if they think there is any difference between the two, leasing is by so much worse than iniquity as you will destroy is heavier than you hate. For it may be that God hates a person to that degree more mildly, as not to destroy him, but whom He destroys He hates the more exceedingly, by how much He punishes more severely. Now He hates all who work iniquity: but all who speak leasing He also destroys. Which thing being fixed, who of them which assert this will be moved by those examples, when it is said, suppose a man should seek shelter with you who by your lie may be saved from death? Illa enim mors quam stulte timent homines, qui peccare non timent, non animam, sed corpus occidit, sicut Dominus in Euangelio docet; unde praecipit ne ipsa timeatur: os autem quod mentitur, non corpus, sed animam occidit. His enim verbis apertissime scriptum est: Os autem quod mentitur, occidit animam. Quomodo ergo non peruersissime dicitur, ut alter corporaliter vivat, debere alterum spiritaliter mori? Nam et ipsa dilectio proximi ex sua cuiusque terminum accepit. Diliges, inquit, proximum tuum tamquam te ipsum. Quomodo ergo quisque diligit tamquam se ipsum, cui ut praestet vitam temporalem, ipse amittit aeternam? quandoquidem si pro illius temporali vita suam ipsam temporalem perdat, non est iam diligere sicut se ipsum, sed plus quam se ipsum: quod sanae doctrinae regulam excedit. Multo minus igitur aeternam suam pro alterius temporali mentiendo amissurus est. Temporalem plane vitam suam pro aeterna vita proximi non dubitabit christianus amittere: hoc enim praecessit exemplum, ut pro nobis Dominus ipse moreretur. For that death which men are foolishly afraid of who are not afraid to sin, kills not the soul but the body, as the Lord teaches in the Gospel; whence He charges us not to fear that death: but the mouth which lies kills not the body but the soul. For in these words it is most plainly written, The mouth that lies slays the soul. How then can it be said without the greatest perverseness, that to the end one man may have life of the body, it is another man's duty to incur death of the soul? The love of our neighbor has its bounds in each man's love of himself. You shall love, says He, your neighbor as yourself. How can a man be said to love as himself that man, for whom that he may secure a temporal life, himself loses life eternal? Since if for his temporal life he lose but his own temporal life, that is not to love as himself, but more than himself: which exceeds the rule of sound doctrine. Much less then is he by telling a lie to lose his own eternal for another's temporal life. His own temporal life, of course, for his neighbor's eternal life a Christian man will not hesitate to lose: for this example has gone before, that the Lord died for us. Ad hoc enim et ait: Hoc est mandatum meum, ut diligatis invicem sicut et ego dilexi vos. Maiorem dilectionem nemo habet, quam ut animam suam ponat pro amicis suis. Non enim quisquam est ita desipiens, ut dicat aliud quam saluti sempiternae hominum consuluisse Dominum vel faciendo quod praecepit, vel praecipiendo quod fecit. Cum igitur mentiendo vita aeterna amittatur, nunquam pro cuiusquam temporali vita mentiendum est. Enimuero isti qui stomachantur et indignantur, si nolit aliquis mendacio perimere animam suam, ut alius senescat in carne; quid, si etiam furto nostro, quid, si adulterio liberari possit aliquis de morte? ideone furandum est, aut moechandum? Nesciunt enim ad hoc se cogere, ut si laqueum ferat homo et stuprum petat, confirmans quod sibi collum ligabit, nisi ei concedatur quod petit, consentiatur propter animam, sicut ipsi dicunt, liberandam. Quod si absurdum et nefarium est, cur animam suam quisque mendacio corrumpat, ut alter vivat in corpore; cum si suum corpus propterea corrumpendum daret, omnium iudicio nefariae turpitudinis damnaretur? To this point He also says, This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. For none is so foolish as to say that the Lord did other than consult for the eternal salvation of men, whether in doing what He has charged us to do, or in charging us to do what Himself has done. Since then by lying eternal life is lost, never for any man's temporal life must a lie be told. And as to those who take it ill and are indignant that one should refuse to tell a lie, and thereby slay his own soul in order that another may grow old in the flesh; what if by our committing theft, what if by committing adultery, a person might be delivered from death: are we therefore to steal, to commit whoredom? They cannot prevail with themselves in a case of this kind: namely, if a person should bring a halter and demand that one should yield to his carnal lust, declaring that he will hang himself unless his request be granted: they cannot prevail with themselves to comply for the sake of, as they say, saving a life. If this is absurd and wicked, why should a man corrupt his own soul with a lie in order that another may live in the body, when, if he were to give his body to be corrupted with such an object, he would in the judgment of all men be held guilty of nefarious turpitude? Proinde non est in ista quaestione attendendum, nisi utrum iniquitas sit mendacium. Quod cum supra commemoratis documentis asseratur, videndum est ita quaeri utrum pro alterius salute mentiri aliquis debeat, ac si quaereretur utrum pro alterius salute iniquus esse aliquis debeat. Quod si respuit animae salus, quae non potest nisi aequitate servari, et se ut praeponamus non solum alterius, sed etiam nostrae saluti temporali iubet; quid restat, inquiunt, quo dubitare debeamus nunquam omnino esse mentiendum? Non enim dici potest esse aliquid in temporalibus commodis, salute ac vita corporali maius aut carius. Unde si nec ipsa praeponenda est veritati, quid obiici potest propter quod mentiendum esse contendant, qui aliquando putant oportere mentiri? Therefore the only point to be attended to in this question is, whether a lie be iniquity. And since this is asserted by the texts above rehearsed, we must see that to ask, whether a man ought to tell a lie for the safety of another, is just the same as asking whether for another's safety a man ought to commit iniquity. But if the salvation of the soul rejects this, seeing it cannot be secured but by equity, and would have us prefer it not only to another's, but even to our own temporal safety: what remains, say they, that should make us doubt that a lie ought not to be told under any circumstances whatsoever? For it cannot be said that there is anything among temporal goods greater or dearer than the safety and life of the body. Wherefore if not even that is to be preferred to truth, what can be put in our way for the sake of which they who think it is sometimes right to lie, can urge that a lie ought to be told? Nec pudicitiae corporalis causa mentiendum. Libido quid sit. [7.10] Pudicitia quippe corporis, quia multum honorabili persona videtur occurrere, et pro se flagitare mendacium, ut si stuprator irruat qui possit mendacio devitari, sine dubitatione mentiendum sit: facile responderi potest, nullam esse pudicitiam corporis, nisi ab integritate animi pendeat; qua disrupta cadat necesse est, etiamsi intacta videatur; et ideo non in rebus temporalibus esse numerandam, quasi quae inuitis possit auferri. Nullo modo igitur animus se mendacio corrumpit pro corpore suo, quod scit manere incorruptum, si ab ipso animo incorruptio non recedat. Quod enim violenter non praecedente libidine patitur corpus, uexatio potius quam corruptio nominanda est. 10. As concerning purity of body; here indeed a very honorable regard seems to come in the way, and to demand a lie in its behalf; to wit, that if the assault of the ravisher may be escaped by means of a lie, it is indubitably right to tell it: but to this it may easily be answered, that there is no purity of body except as it depends on integrity of mind; this being broken, the other must needs fall, even though it seem intact; and for this reason it is not to be reckoned among temporal things, as a thing that might be taken away from people against their will. By no means therefore must the mind corrupt itself by a lie for the sake of its body, which it knows remains incorrupt if from the mind itself incorruptness depart not. For that which by violence, with no lust foregoing, the body suffers, is rather to be called deforcement than corruption. Aut si omnis uexatio corruptio est, non omnis corruptio turpis est; sed quam libido procuraverit, aut cui libido consenserit. Quanto autem praestantior est animus corpore, tanto sceleratius corrumpitur. Ibi ergo servari potest pudicitia, ubi nulla nisi voluntaria potest esse corruptio. Certe enim si stuprator corpus inuaserit, qui nec vi contraria possit, nec ullo consilio vel mendacio devitari, necesse est fateamur, aliena libidine pudicitiam non posse violari. Quapropter quoniam nemo dubitat meliorem esse animum corpore, integritati corporis integritas animi praeponenda est, quae in aeternum servari potest. Quis autem dixerit integrum animum esse mentientis? Etenim libido quoque ipsa recte definitur: Appetitus animi quo aeternis bonis quaelibet temporalia praeponuntur. Nemo itaque potest conuincere aliquando esse mentiendum, nisi qui potuerit ostendere aeternum aliquod bonum obtineri posse mendacio. Sed cum tanto quisque ab aeternitate discedat, quanto a veritate discedit; absurdissimum est dicere, discedendo inde posse ad boni aliquid aliquem pervenire. Aut si est aliquod bonum aeternum quod non complectatur veritas, non erit verum: et ideo nec bonum erit, quia falsum erit. Or if all deforcement is corruption, then not every corruption has turpitude, but only that which lust has procured, or to which lust has consented. Now by how much the mind is more excellent than the body, so much the more heinous is the wickedness if that be corrupted. There, then, purity can be preserved, because there none but a voluntary corruption can have place. For assuredly if the ravisher assault the body, and there is no escaping him either by contrary force, or by any contrivance or lie, we must needs allow that purity cannot be violated by another's lust. Wherefore, since no man doubts that the mind is better than the body, to integrity of body we ought to prefer integrity of mind, which can be preserved for ever. Now who will say that the mind of him who tells a lie has its integrity? Indeed lust itself is rightly defined, An appetite of the mind by which to eternal goods any temporal goods whatever are preferred. Therefore no man can prove that it is at any time right to tell a lie, unless he be able to show that any eternal good can be obtained by a lie. But since each man departs from eternity just in so far as he departs from truth, it is most absurd to say, that by departing therefrom it is possible for any man to attain to any good. Else if there be any eternal good which truth comprises not, it will not be a true good, therefore neither will it be good, because it will be false. Ut autem animus corpori, ita etiam veritas ipsi animo praeponenda est; ut eam non solum magis quam corpus, sed etiam magis quam se ipsum appetat animus. Ita quippe erit integrior et castior, cum eius potius immutabilitate, quam sua mutabilitate perfruetur. Si autem Loth cum ita iustus esset, ut angelos etiam hospites suscipere mereretur, stuprandas filias Sodomitis obtulit, ut feminarum potius ab eis corpora quam virorum corrumperentur; quanto diligentius atque constantius animi castitas in veritate servanda est, cum verius ipse corpori suo, quam corpus virile femineo corpori praeferatur? But as the mind to the body, so must also truth be preferred to the mind itself, so that the mind should desire it not only more than the body, but even more than its own self. So will the mind be more entire and chaste, when it shall enjoy the immutability of truth rather than its own mutability. Now if Lot, being so righteous a man that he was meet to entertain even Angels, offered his daughters to the lust of the Sodomites, to the intent, that the bodies of women rather than of men might be corrupted by them; how much more diligently and constantly ought the mind's chasteness in the truth to be preserved, seeing it is more truly preferable to its body, than the body of a man to the body of a woman? Neque mentiendum studio servandi alios ad vitam aeternam. [8.11] Quod si quisquam putat, ideo cuiquam pro alio esse mentiendum, ut interim vivat, aut in his rebus quas multum diligit non offendatur, quo possit ad aeternam veritatem pervenire discendo: non intellegit primo nullum esse flagitium, quod non eadem conditione suscipere cogatur, sicut iam superius demonstratum est; deinde ipsius doctrinae auctoritatem intercipi et penitus interire, si eis quos ad illam perducere conamur, mendacio nostro persuademus aliquando esse mentiendum. Cum enim doctrina salutaris, partim credendis, partim intellegendis rebus constet; nec ad ea quae intellegenda sunt perveniri possit, nisi prius credenda credantur: quomodo credendum est ei qui putat aliquando esse mentiendum, ne forte et tunc mentiatur cum praecipit ut credamus? Unde enim sciri potest utrum et tunc habeat aliquam causam, sicut ipse putat, officiosi mendacii, existimans falsa narratione hominem territum posse a libidine cohiberi, atque hoc modo etiam ad spiritalia se consulere mentiendo arbitretur? 11. But if any man supposes that the reason why it is right for a person to tell a lie for another is, that he may live the while, or not be offended in those things which he much loves, to the end he may attain unto eternal truth by being taught: that man does not understand, in the first place, that there is no flagitious thing which he may not upon the same ground be compelled to commit, as has been above demonstrated; and in the next place, that the authority of the doctrine itself is cut off and altogether undone if those whom we essay to bring thereunto, are by our lie made to think that it is somewhiles right to lie. For seeing the doctrine which brings salvation consists partly in things to be believed, partly in things to be understood; and there is no attaining unto those things which are to be understood, unless first those things are believed, which are to be believed; how can there be any believing one who thinks it is sometimes right to lie, lest haply he lie at the moment when he teaches us to believe? For how can it be known whether he have at that moment some cause, as he thinks, for a well-meant lie, deeming that by a false story a man may be frightened and kept from lust, and in this way account that by telling a lie he is doing good even in spiritual things? Quo genere admisso atque approbato, omnis omnino fidei disciplina subuertitur; qua subuersa, nec ad intellegentiam pervenitur, cui capiendae ista paruulos nutrit: atque ita omnis doctrina veritatis aufertur, cedens licentiosissimae falsitati, si mendacio velut officioso alicunde penetrandi aperitur locus. Aut enim temporalia commoda, vel propria vel aliena, veritati praeponit, quicumque mentitur; quo quid fieri potest peruersius? aut cum veritati adipiscendae opitulante mendacio vult facere idoneum, intercludit aditum veritati; volens enim cum mentitur esse aptus, fit cum verum dicit incertus. Quamobrem aut non est credendum bonis, aut credendum est eis quos credimus debere aliquando mentiri, aut non est credendum bonos aliquando mentiri: horum trium primum perniciosum est, secundum stultum; restat ergo ut nunquam mentiantur boni. Which kind of lie once admitted and approved, all discipline of faith is subverted altogether; and this being subverted, neither is there any attaining to understanding, for the receiving of which that discipline nurtures the babes: and so all the doctrine of truth is done away, giving place to most licentious falsehood, if a lie, even well-meant, may from any quarter have place opened for it to enter in. For either whoso tells a lie prefers temporal advantages, his own or another's, to truth; than which what can be more perverse? Or when by aid of a lie he wishes to make a person fit for gaining the truth, he bars the approach to truth, for by wishing when he lies to be accommodating, it comes to pass that when he speaks the truth, he cannot be depended upon. Wherefore, either we must not believe good men, or we must believe those whom we think obliged sometimes to tell a lie, or we must not believe that good men sometimes tell lies: of these three the first is pernicious, the second foolish; it remains therefore that good men should never tell lies. Mendacium censent quidam adhibendum quo removeat homo stuprum quod ipse ab alio pateretur. [9.12] Sic ista quaestione ex utraque parte considerata atque tractata, non tamen facile ferenda sententia est: sed adhuc diligenter audiendi qui dicunt, nullum esse tam malum factum, quod non in peioris devitatione faciendum sit; pertinere autem ad facta hominum, non solum quidquid faciunt, sed quidquid etiam cum consensione patiuntur. Unde si exstitit causa ut eligeret christianus thurificare idolis, ne consentiret stupro quod persecutor ei, nisi faceret, minabatur; recte videntur quaerere cur non etiam mentiretur, ut tantam illam turpitudinem devitaret. Ipsam enim consensionem, qua se stuprum pati mallet, quam thurificare idolis, non passionem dicunt esse, sed factum: quod ne faceret, elegit thurificare. Quanto igitur mendacium proclivius elegisset, si mendacio posset a sancto corpore tam immane flagitium removere? 12. Thus has the question been on both sides considered and treated; and still it is not easy to pass sentence: but we must further lend diligent hearing to those who say, that no deed is so evil, but that in avoidance of a worse it ought to be done; moreover that the deeds of men include not only what they do, but whatever they consent to be done unto them. Wherefore, if cause have arisen that a Christian man should choose to burn incense to idols, that he might not consent to bodily defilement which the persecutor threatened him withal, unless he should do so, they think they have a right to ask why he should not also tell a lie to escape so foul a disgrace. For the consent itself to endure violation of the person rather than to burn incense to idols, this, they say, is not a passive thing, but a deed; which rather than do, he chose to burn incense. How much more readily then would he have chosen a lie, if by a lie he might ward off from a holy body so shocking a disgrace? Refellitur argumentum illorum, et exemplum. [9.13] In qua propositione ista sunt quae merito quaeri possunt: utrum talis consensio pro facto habenda sit; aut utrum consensio dicenda sit quae non habet approbationem; aut utrum approbatio sit, cum dicitur: Expedit hoc pati potius quam illud facere; et utrum recte ille fecerit thurificare quam stuprum pati; et utrum mentiendum esset potius, si ea conditio daretur, quam thurificandum. Sed si talis consensio pro facto habenda est, homicidae sunt etiam qui occidi maluerunt quam falsum testimonium dicere; et quod est homicidium gravius, in se ipsos. Cur enim hoc pacto non dicatur, quod ipsi se occiderint; quia elegerunt hoc in se fieri, ne facerent quod cogebantur? 13. In which proposition these points may well deserve to be questioned: whether such consent is to be accounted as a deed: or whether that is to be called consent which has not approbation: or whether it be approbation, when it is said, It is expedient to suffer this rather than do that; and whether the person spoken of did right to burn incense rather than suffer violation of his body; and whether it would be right rather to tell a lie, if that was the alternative proposed, than to burn incense? But if such consent is to be accounted as a deed, then are they murderers who have chosen rather to be put to death than bear false witness, yea, what is worse, they are murderers of themselves. For why, at this rate, should it not be said that they have slain themselves, because they chose that this should be done to them that they might not do what they were urged to do? Aut si gravius putatur alium occidere quam se ipsum, quid si haec conditio martyri proponeretur, ut si nollet de Christo falsum testimonium dicere atque immolare daemonibus, ante oculos ipsius alius non quilibet homo, sed pater eius occideretur, rogans etiam filium ne id perseuerantia sua fieri permitteret? Nonne manifestum est, illo in testimonii fidelissimi sententia permanente, solos homicidas futuros fuisse, qui patrem eius occiderent, non illum etiam parricidam? Sicut ergo huius tanti sceleris particeps iste non esset, cum elegisset patrem suum potius ab aliis interfici, etiam sacrilegum, cuius anima raperetur ad poenas, quam fidem suam falso testimonio violare: sic talis ille consensus non eum faceret tanti flagitii participem, si male facere ipse nollet, quidquid alii propterea fecissent, quia ipse non faceret. Or, if it be accounted a worse thing to slay another than himself, what if these terms were offered to a Martyr, that, upon his refusing to bear false witness of Christ and to sacrifice to demons, then, before his eyes, not some other man, but his own father should be put to death; his father entreating him that he would not by his persevering permit that to be done? Is it not manifest, that, upon his remaining steadfast in his purpose of most faithful testimony, they alone would be the murderers who should slay his father, and not he a parricide into the bargain? As therefore, in this case, the man would be no party to this so heinous deed, for choosing, rather than violate his faith by false testimony, that his own father should be put to death by others, (yea, though that father were a sacrilegious person whose soul would be snatched away to punishment;) so the like consent, in the former case, would not make him a party to that so foul disgrace, if he refused to do evil himself, let others do what they might in consequence of his not doing it. Quid enim tales persecutores dicunt, nisi: Fac male, ne nos faciamus? Qui si vere, nobis facientibus, non fecissent, nec sic eis nostro scelere suffragari deberemus. Nunc vero quando iam faciunt, cum ista non dicunt, cur nobiscum potius, quam soli turpes atque nocentes sint? Non enim consensus ille dicendus est; quia non approbamus quod faciunt, semper optantes, et quantum in nobis est prohibentes ne faciant, factumque ipsorum non solum non committentes cum eis, sed etiam quanta possumus detestatione damnantes. For what do such persecutors say, but, Do evil that we may not? If the case were so, that our doing evil would make them not to have done it, even then it would not be our duty by doing wickedness ourselves to vote them harmless; but as in fact they are already doing it when they say nothing of the kind, why are they to have us to keep them company in wickedness rather than be vile and noisome by themselves? For that is not to be called consent; seeing that we do not approve what they do, always wishing that they would not, and, as much as in us lies, hindering them that they should not do it, and, when it is done, not only not committing it with them, but with all possible detestation condemning the same. Aliena peccata non ei imputanda qui illa posset leviore suo peccato impedire. Peccantibus non consentire qui eos non vult peccando cohibere. Vitare peccatum quisque debet levius potius quod suum, quam quod gravius alienum. [9.14] Quomodo, inquis, non cum eis facit, quando illi hoc non facerent, si ipse illud faceret? Hoc modo frangimus ianuam cum effractoribus, quia si non eam clauderemus, illi non frangerent: et occidimus homines cum latronibus, si scire contingat hoc eos esse facturos; quia si nos praevenientes eos occideremus, illi non occiderent alios. Aut si fateatur nobis aliquis parricidium se facturum, nos cum eo facimus, si cum possumus eum priusquam faciat, non interficimus, quando aliter eum vel cohibere vel impedire non possumus. Totidem enim verbis dici potest: Fecisti cum eo, quia hoc ille non fecisset, si tu illud fecisses. Ego utrumque malum fieri nollem: sed id tantum cavere potui ne fieret, quod erat in mea potestate; alterum autem alienum, quod meo praecepto exstinguere non potui, meo malefacto impedire non debui. 14. How, do you say, is it not his doing as well as theirs, when they would not do this, if he would do that? Why, at this rate we go housebreaking with house-breakers, because if we did not shut the door, they would not break it open: and we go and murder with highwaymen, if it chance we know that they are going to do it, because if we killed them out of hand, they would not kill others. Or, if a person confess to us that he is going to commit a parricide, we commit it along with him, if, being able, we do not slay him before he can do the deed when we cannot in some other way prevent or thwart him. For it may be said, word for word as before, You have done it as well as he; for he had not done this, had you done that. With my good will, neither ill should be done; but only the one was in my power, and I could take care that this should not be done; the other rested with another, and when by my good advice I could not quench the purpose, I was not bound by my evil deed to thwart the doing. Non ergo peccantem approbat, qui pro alio non peccat; et neutrum placet ei qui utrumque nollet admitti: sed illud quod ad se pertinet, etiam potestate non perpetrat; quod autem ad alterum, sola voluntate condemnat. Et ideo proponentibus illam conditionem atque dicentibus: Si non thurificaveris, hoc patieris; si respondisset: Ego neutrum eligo, utrumque detestor, ad nihil horum vobis consentio: inter haec verba atque talia, quae certe quoniam vera essent, nulla eius consensio, nulla approbatio teneretur; quaecumque ab eis passus esset, illi deputaretur iniuriarum acceptio, illis commissio peccatorum. Debuitne igitur, ait quispiam, stuprum perpeti potius quam thurificare? Si quaeris quid debuerit, neutrum debuit. Si enim dixero aliquid horum debuisse; aliquid horum approbabo, cum improbem utrumque. Sed si quaeritur quid horum potius debuit evitare, qui utrumque non potuit, sed alterutrum potuit: respondebo, suum peccatum potius quam alienum; et levius potius quod suum, quam gravius quod alienum. Ut enim salua diligentiore inquisitione interim concedam gravius esse stuprum quam thurificationem: illa tamen ipsius erat, illud alienum factum, quamvis id ipse perpeteretur; cuius autem factum, eius et peccatum. It is therefore no approving of a sinner, that one refuses to sin for him; and neither the one nor the other is liked by him who would that neither were done; but in that which pertains to him, he has the power to do it or not, and with that he perpetrates it not; in that which pertains to another, he has only the will to wish it or not, and with that he condemns. And therefore, on their offering those terms, and saying, If you burn not incense, this shall you suffer; if he should answer, For me, I choose neither, I detest both, I consent unto you in none of these things: in uttering these and the like words, which certainly, because they would be true, would afford them no consent no approbation of his, let him suffer at their hands what he might, to his account would be set down the receipt of wrongs, to theirs the commission of sins. Ought he then, it may be asked, to suffer his person to be violated rather than burn incense? If the question be what he ought, he ought to do neither. For should I say that he ought to do any of these things, I shall approve this or that, whereas I reprobate both. But if the question be, which of these he ought in preference to avoid, not being able to avoid both but able to avoid one or other: I will answer, His own sin, rather than another's; and rather a lighter sin being his own, than a heavier being another's. For, reserving the point for more diligent inquiry, and granting in the mean while that violation of the person is worse than burning incense, yet the latter is his own, the former another's deed, although he had it done to him; now, whose the deed, his the sin. Quamvis enim gravius sit homicidium quam furtum; peius est tamen facere furtum, quam pati homicidium. Itaque si cuiquam proponeretur, ut si furtum facere nollet, interficeretur, hoc est, committeretur in eum homicidium; quia utrumque evitare non posset, id evitaret potius quod suum peccatum esset, quam quod alienum. Nec ideo et illud eius fieret, quia in eum committeretur, et quia id posset evitare, si suum vellet admittere. For though murder is a greater sin than stealing, yet it is worse to steal than to suffer murder. Therefore, if it were proposed to any man that, if he would not steal he should be killed, that is, murder should be committed upon him; being he could not avoid both, he would prefer to avoid that which would be his own sin, rather than that which would be another's. Nor would the latter become his act for being committed upon him, and because he might avoid it if he would commit a sin of his own. Annon mentiendum ut vitetur immunditia corporalis. [9.15] Totus itaque huius quaestionis nodus ad hoc adducit, ut quaeratur utrum alienum nullum peccatum, quamvis in te commissum, tibi imputetur, si leviore tuo peccato id possis evitare, nec facis; an excepta est omnis immunditia corporalis. Nemo enim aliquem immundum fieri dicit, si occidatur, aut mittatur in carcerem, aut in vinculis habeatur, aut flagelletur, caeterisque tormentis et cruciatibus affligatur, aut proscribatur damnisque afficiatur gravissimis usque ad ultimam nuditatem, aut spolietur honoribus atque ingentes accipiat contumelias per quaecumque conuicia: quidquid horum quisque iniuste passus fuerit, nemo est tam demens qui eum immundum fieri dicat. At si fimo perfundatur, aut si tale aliquid ei per os infundatur vel inculcetur, patiaturue muliebria; omnium fere sensus abhorret, et constupratum atque immundum vocant. 15. The whole stress, then, of this question comes to this; whether it be true universally that no sin of another, committed upon you, is to be imputed to you, if, being able to avoid it by a lighter sin of your own, you do it not; or whether there be an exception of all bodily defilement. No man says that a person is defiled by being murdered, or cast into prison, or bound in chains, or scourged, or afflicted with other tortures and pains, or proscribed and made to suffer most grievous losses even to utter nakedness, or stripped of honors, and subjected to great disgrace by reproaches of whatsoever kind; whatever of all these a man may have unjustly suffered, no man is so senseless as to say that he is thereby defiled. But if he have filth poured all over him, or poured into his mouth, or crammed into him, or if he be carnally used like a woman; then almost all men regard him with a feeling of horror, and they call him defiled and unclean. Ita igitur concludendum est, ut quaecumque aliena peccata, exceptis iis quae immundum faciunt in quem committuntur, non evitet quisque peccatis suis, neque pro se, neque pro quoquam, sed ea sufferat potius fortiterque patiatur; et si nullis peccatis suis ea debet evitare, neque mendacio: illa vero quae ita committuntur in homine, ut eum faciant immundum, etiam peccatis nostris evitare debeamus; ac per hoc nec peccata dicenda sint, quae propterea fiunt ut illa immunditia devitetur. Quidquid enim ita fit, ut nisi fieret, iuste reprehenderetur, non est peccatum. Ex quo conficitur ut nec illa immunditia vocanda sit, quando evitandi eam nulla facultas est: habet enim etiam tunc quod recte agat qui eam patitur, ut patienter ferat quidquid non potest evitare. Nullus autem recte agens immundus fieri potest quolibet contagio corporali. Immundus est enim ante Deum omnis iniquus. Mundus ergo est omnis iustus; etsi non ante homines, tamen ante Deum, qui sine errore iudicat. Proinde nec cum ea patitur, data evitandi potestate, contactu ipso immundus fit; sed peccato, quo ea cum posset noluit evitare. Nullum enim peccatum esset, quidquid propter illa evitanda factum esset. Propter haec igitur evitanda quisquis mentitus fuerit, non peccat. One must conclude then that the sins of others, be they what they may, those always excepted which defile him on whom they are committed, a man must not seek to avoid by sin of his own, either for himself or for any other, but rather he must put up with them, and suffer bravely; and if by no sins of his own he ought to avoid them, therefore not by a lie: but those which by being committed upon a man do make him unclean, these we are bound to avoid even by sinning ourselves; and for this reason those things are not to be called sins, which are done for the purpose of avoiding that uncleanness. For whatever is done, in consideration that the not doing it were just cause of blame, that thing is not sin. Upon the same principle, neither is that to be called uncleanness when there is no way of avoiding it; for even in that extremity he who suffers it has what he may do aright, namely, patiently bear what he cannot avoid. Now no man while acting aright can be defiled by any corporal contagion. For the unclean in the sight of God is every one who is unrighteous; clean therefore is every one who is righteous; if not in the sight of men, yet in the sight of God, Who judges without error. Nay, even in the act of suffering that defilement with power given of avoiding it, it is not by the mere contact that the man is defiled; but by the sin of refusing to avoid it when he might. For that would be no sin, whatever might be done for the avoiding of it. Whoever therefore, for the avoiding of it, shall tell a lie, sins not. Mendacia quae alios laedunt, non admittenda ut immunditia corporalis vitetur. [9.16] An aliqua etiam mendacia excipienda sunt, ut satius sit hanc pati, quam illa committere? Quod si ita est, non quidquid factum fuerit ut illa immunditia devitetur, non est peccatum: quandoquidem sunt quaedam mendacia quae gravius sit admittere, quam illam pati. Nam si aliquis ad stuprum quaeratur, qui possit occultari mendacio, quis audet dicere nec tunc esse mentiendum? At si tali mendacio possit latere, quod alterius famam laedat, eius immunditiae falso crimine ad quam patiendam ille quaeritur; tamquam si dicatur quaerenti, nominato aliquo casto viro atque ab huiusmodi flagitiis alieno: Vade ad illum, et ipse tibi procurabit quo libentius utaris, novit enim tales et diligit; atque ita iste ab eo quem quaerebat, posset averti: nescio utrum alterius fama mendacio violanda sit, ne alterius corpus aliena libidine violetur. Et omnino nunquam pro aliquo mentiendum est, eo mendacio quod alterum laedat; etsi levius laeditur, quam ille, nisi ita mentireris, laederetur. Quia nec panis alienus inuito, quamvis valentiori, auferendus est, ut alatur infirmior; nec innocens inuitus virgis caedendus est, ne alius occidatur. Plane si velint fiat; quia nec laeduntur, cum ita volunt. 16. Or, are some lies, also, to be excepted, so that it were better to suffer this than to commit those? If so, then not every thing that is done in order to the avoiding of that defilement ceases to be sin; seeing there are some lies to commit which is worse than to suffer that foul violence. For, suppose quest be making after a person that his body may be deflowered, and that it be possible to screen him by a lie; who dares to say that even in such a case a lie ought not be told? But, if the lie by which he may be concealed be one which may hurt the fair fame of another, by bringing upon him a false accusation of that very uncleanness, to suffer which the other is sought after; as, if it should be said to the inquirer, Go to such an one, (naming some chaste man who is a stranger to vices of this kind,) and he will procure for you one whom you will find a more willing subject, for he knows and loves such; and thereby the person might be diverted from him whom he sought: I know not whether one man's fair fame ought to be violated by a lie, in order that another's body may not be violated by lust to which he is a stranger. And in general, it is never right to tell a lie for any man, such as may hurt another, even if the hurt be slighter than would be the hurt to him unless such a lie were told. Because neither must another man's bread be taken from him against his will, though he be in good health, and it is to feed one who is weak; nor must an innocent man, against his will, be beaten with rods, that another may not be killed. Of course, if they are willing, let it be done, because they are not hurt if they be willing that so it should be: [10.16] Sed utrum etiam volentis fama falso stupri crimine laedenda sit, ut ab alterius corpore stuprum avertatur, magna quaestio est. Et nescio utrum facile reperiatur quomodo iustum sit volentis famam falso stupri crimine maculari, quam ipso stupro corpus inuiti. but whether, even with his own consent, a man's fair fame ought to be hurt with a false charge of foul lusts, in order that lust may be averted from another's body, is a great question. And I know not whether it be easy to find in what way it can be just that a man's fair fame, even with his consent, should be stained with a false charge of lust, any more than a man's body should be polluted by the lust itself against his will. Mendacium in doctrina religionis nunquam adhibendum. [10.17] Sed tamen si talis optio proponeretur ei qui thurificare idolis, quam muliebria perpeti maluit, ut si illud vellet evitare, famam Christi aliquo mendacio violaret; insanissimus esset, si faceret. Plus etiam dico, quia insanus esset, si alienae libidinis evitandae causa, ne id in eo fieret quod nulla sua libidine pateretur, Christi Euangelium falsis Christi laudibus infalsaret; magis evitans alienam corruptionem in corpore suo, quam in doctrina sanctificationis animarum atque corporum corruptionem suam. Quamobrem a doctrina religionis, atque ab eis omnino enuntiationibus, quae propter doctrinam religionis enuntiantur, cum illa docetur et discitur, omnia penitus mendacia removenda sunt. Nec ulla omnino causa inveniri posse credatur, cur in rebus talibus mentiendum sit: quando nec ideo in ea doctrina mentiendum est, ut ad eam ipsam quisque facilius perducatur. Fracta enim vel leviter diminuta auctoritate veritatis, omnia dubia remanebunt: quae nisi vera credantur, teneri certa non possunt. Licet igitur vel dissertori ac disputatori atque praedicatori rerum aeternarum, vel narratori vel pronuntiatori rerum temporalium ad aedificandam religionem atque pietatem pertinentium, occultare in tempore quidquid occultandum videtur: mentiri autem nunquam licet; ergo nec occultare mentiendo. 17. But yet if the option were proposed to the man who chose to burn incense to idols rather than yield his body to abominable lust, that, if he wished to avoid that, he should violate the fame of Christ by some lie; he would be most mad to do it. I say more: that he would be mad, if, to avoid another man's lust, and not to have that done upon his person which he would suffer with no lust of his own, he should falsify Christ's Gospel with false praises of Christ; more eschewing that another man should corrupt his body, than himself to corrupt the doctrine of sanctification of souls and bodies. Wherefore, from the doctrine of religion, and from those utterances universally, which are uttered on behalf of the doctrine of religion, in the teaching and learning of the same, all lies must be utterly kept aloof. Nor can any cause whatever be found, one should think, why a lie should be told in matters of this kind, when in this doctrine it is not right to tell a lie for the very purpose of bringing a person to it the more easily. For, once break or but slightly diminish the authority of truth, and all things will remain doubtful: which unless they be believed true, cannot be held as certain. It is lawful then either to him that discourses, disputes, and preaches of things eternal, or to him that narrates or speaks of things temporal pertaining to edification of religion and piety, to conceal at fitting time whatever seems fit to be concealed: but to tell a lie is never lawful, therefore neither to conceal by telling a lie. Mendacia etiam removenda quae aut alteri obsunt, aut ipsi mentienti. Mentiens et mendax differunt. [11.18] Hoc primitus et firmissime constituto, de caeteris mendaciis securius quaeritur. Sed consequenter etiam videndum est, removenda esse etiam omnia mendacia quae aliquem laedunt iniuste: quia nulli est iniuria vel levior inferenda, ut ab alio gravior repellatur. Nec illa sunt admittenda mendacia, quae quamvis non obsint alteri, nulli tamen prosunt, et obsunt eis ipsis qui gratis mentiuntur. Ipsi enim proprie mendaces dicendi sunt. Interest enim inter mentientem atque mendacem. Nam mentiens est etiam qui mentitur inuitus: mendax vero amat mentiri, atque habitat animo in delectatione mentiendi. Iuxta ponendi sunt et qui de mendacio volunt placere hominibus, non ut alicui faciant iniuriam vel inferant contumeliam; iam enim supra hoc genus removimus; sed ut suaves sint in sermonibus suis. Isti ab illo genere in quo mendaces posuimus, hoc differunt, quod illos mentiri delectat, gaudentes de ipsa fallacia: istis autem placere libet de suaviloquio, qui tamen veris mallent placere; sed quando non facile inveniunt vera quae grata sint audientibus, mentiri eligunt potius quam tacere. 18. This being from the very first and most firmly established, touching other lies the question proceeds more securely. But by consequence we must also see that all lies must be kept aloof which hurt any man unjustly: because no man is to have a wrong, albeit a lighter one is done to him, that another may have a heavier kept from him. Nor are those lies to be allowed, which, though they hurt not another, yet do nobody any good, and are hurtful to the persons themselves who gratuitously tell them. Indeed, these are the persons who are properly to be called liars. For there is a difference between lying and being a liar. A man may tell a lie unwillingly; but a liar loves to lie, and inhabits in his mind in the delight of lying. Next to such are those to be placed who by a lie wish to please men, not that they may do wrong or bring reproach upon any man; for we have already before put away that kind; but that they may be pleasant in conversation. These, differ from the class in which we have placed liars in this respect, that liars delight in lying, rejoicing in deceit for its own sake: but these lust to please by agreeable talk, and yet would rather please by saying things that were true, but when they do not easily find true things to say that are pleasant to the hearers, they choose rather to tell lies than to hold their tongues. Difficile est tamen ut isti totam narrationem falsam aliquando suscipiant; sed plerumque veris falsa contexunt, ubi suavitas eos deserit. Haec autem duo genera mendaciorum non obsunt credentibus, quia nihil de doctrina religionis veritatisque falluntur, aut de ullo commodo vel utilitate sua. Sufficit enim eis ut iudicent fieri potuisse quod dicitur, et fidem habeant homini quem non debent temere existimare mentientem. Quid enim obest, si credo patrem aut auum alicuius virum bonum fuisse, etiamsi non fuit; aut usque ad Persas militando pervenisse, etiamsi a Roma nunquam recessit? Ipsis autem mentientibus valde obsunt: illis quidem, quia sic deserunt veritatem, ut fallacia laetentur; istis, quia se malunt placere, quam verum. Yet it is difficult for these sometimes to undertake a story which is the whole of it false; but most commonly they interweave falsehood with truth, where they are at a loss for something sweet. Now these two sorts of lies do no harm to those who believe them, because they are not deceived concerning any matter of religion and truth, or concerning any profit or advantage of their own. It suffices them, to judge the thing possible which is told, and to have faith in a man of whom they ought not rashly to think that he is telling a lie. For where is the harm of believing that such an one's father or grandfather was a good man, when he was not? Or that he has served with the army even in Persia, though he never set foot out of Rome? But to the persons who tell these lies, they do much harm: to the former sort, because they so desert truth as to rejoice in deceit: to the latter, because they want to please people better than the truth. Mendacium quod et nulli obest et alicui prodest an adhibendum. [12.19] Istis generibus sine ulla dubitatione damnatis, sequitur genus mendacii tamquam gradatim ad meliora surgentibus, quod beneuolis et bonis uulgo tribui solet, cum ille qui mentitur, non solum alteri non obest, sed etiam prodest alicui. De isto genere est tota contentio, utrumne sibi obsit, qui sic prodest alteri, ut faciat contra veritatem. Aut si veritas illa sola dicenda est, quae ipsas mentes intimo atque incommutabili lumine illustrat; facit certe contra aliquod verum, quia etsi falluntur corporis sensus, contra verum tamen facit, qui dicit aliquid ita esse, vel non ita, quod ei nec mens nec sensus nec opinatio sua fidesue renuntiat. Utrum ergo non sibi obsit, qui hoc modo alteri prodest; an illa compensatione non obsit sibi, qua prodest alteri, magna quaestio est. Si ita est, consequenter etiam sibi prodesse debet per mendacium quod nulli obest. Sed ea connexa sunt, et istis concessis necessario trahuntur quae multum conturbant. Si enim quaeratur quid obsit homini copiis superfluis redundanti, si de innumeris millibus frumentorum amittat unum modium, qui tamen modius possit ad necessarium victum prodesse furanti; consequens erit ut et furtum sine reprehensione fieri possit, et falsum testimonium sine peccato dici. Quo quid dici potest peruersius? An vero si alius furatus esset illum modium, et tu videres, interrogatusque esses, mentireris honeste pro paupere, et si id pro tua paupertate facias, culpaberis? quasi amplius alium quam te diligere debeas. Utrumque ergo turpe atque vitandum est. An mendacia quaedam honesta, quae nonnulli prosunt et nulli obsunt. 19. These sorts of lies having been without any hesitation condemned, next follows a sort, as it were by steps rising to something better, which is commonly attributed to well-meaning and good people, when the person who lies not only does no harm to another, but even benefits somebody. Now it is on this sort of lies that the whole dispute turns, whether that person does harm to himself, who benefits another in such sort as to act contrary to the truth. Or, if that alone may be called truth which illustrates the very minds of men with an intimate and incommutable light, at least he acts contrary to some true thing, because although the bodily senses are deceived, yet he acts contrary to a true thing who says that a thing is so or not so, whereof neither his mind nor senses nor his opinion or belief gives him any report. Whether therefore he does not hurt himself in so profiting another, or in that compensation not hurt himself in which he profits the other, is a great question. If it be so, it should follow that he ought to profit himself by a lie which damages no man. But these things hang together, and if you concede that point, it necessarily draws in its train some very embarrassing consequences. For should it be asked, what harm it does to a person rolling in superfluous wealth, if from countless thousands of bushels of wheat he lose one bushel, which bushel may be profitable as necessary food to the person stealing it; it will follow that theft also may be committed without blame, and false witness borne without sin. Than which, what can be mentioned more perverse? Or truly, if another had stolen the bushel, and you saw it done, and were questioned, would you tell a lie with honesty for the poor man, and if you do it for your own poverty will you be blamed? As if it were your duty to love another more than yourself. Both then are disgraceful, and must be avoided. [12.20] Sed fortassis exceptionem addendam quis putet, ut sint quaedam honesta mendacia, quae non solum nulli obsunt, sed etiam nonnullis prosunt, exceptis his quibus crimina occultantur et defenduntur: ut ideo sit illud turpe mendacium, quod quamvis nulli obsit, et prosit pauperi, furtum tamen occultat; si autem ita nulli obesset et prodesset alicui, ut etiam nullum peccatum occultaret atque defenderet, turpe non esset. Velut si quispiam pecuniam suam te vidente absconderet, ne per furtum aut vim amitteret, atque inde interrogatus mentireris; neque obesses cuiquam, et ei prodesses cui opus erat illud occultum, et nullum peccatum mentiendo texisses. Non enim quisquam peccat abscondendo rem suam, quam timet amittere. Sed si propterea non peccamus mentiendo, quia nullius peccatum tegentes, et nulli obsumus, et alicui prosumus, quid agimus de ipso peccato mendacii? Ubi enim positum est: Ne furtum feceris; ibi positum est: Ne falsum testimonium dixeris. Cum ergo singula prohibeantur, cur falsum testimonium tunc est culpabile, si furtum tegat, vel aliquod aliud peccatum; si autem nulla defensione peccati per se ipsum fiat, non est culpabile, cum ipsum furtum per se culpabile sit, et caetera peccata? An occultare peccatum mentiendo non licet, facere licet? 20. But haply some may think that there is an exception to be added; that there be some honest lies which not only hurt no man, but profit some man, excepting those by which crimes are screened and defended: so that the reason why the aforesaid lie is disgraceful, is that, although it hurt no man, and profit the poor, it screens a theft; but if it should in such sort hurt nobody and profit somebody as not to screen and defend any sin, it would not be morally wrong. As, put the case that some one should in your sight hide his money that he might not lose it by theft or violence, and thereupon being questioned you should tell a lie; you would hurt no man, and would serve him who had need that his money were hidden, and would not have covered a sin by telling a lie. For it is no sin if a man hide his property which he fears to lose. But, if we therefore sin not in telling a lie, for that, while covering no man's sin, we hurt nobody and do good to somebody, what are we about as concerning the sin itself of a lie? For where it is laid down, You shall not steal, there is also this, You shall not bear false witness. Since then each is severally prohibited, why is false witness culpable if it cover a theft or any other sin, but if without any screening of sin it be done by itself, then not culpable, whereas stealing is culpable in and by itself, and so other sins? Or is it so that to hide a sin is not lawful; to do it, lawful? Mentiri annon semper sit falsum testimonium dicere. [12.21] Quod si absurdum est, quid dicemus? An falsum testimonium non est, nisi cum quisque ita mentitur, ut aut crimen confingat in aliquem, aut alicuius crimen occultet, aut quoquo modo quemquam in iudicio premat? Videtur enim testis iudici necessarius ad causae cognitionem. Sed si hactenus testem Scriptura nominaret, non diceret Apostolus: Invenimur et falsi testes Dei, si testimonium diximus adversus Deum, quia excitaverit Christum, quem non excitavit. Ita enim ostendit falsum testimonium esse mendacium, etiamsi in cuiusquam falsa laude dicatur. 21. If this be absurd, what shall we say? Is it so, that there is no false witness, but when one tells a lie either to invent a crime against some man, or to hide some man's crime, or in any way to oppress any man in judgment? For a witness seems to be necessary to the judge for cognizance of the cause. But if the Scripture named a witness only so far as that goes, the Apostle would not say, Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ: whom He raised not up. For so he shows that it is false witness to tell a lie, yea, in falsely praising a person. Falsum testimonium et mendacium. [13.21] An forte tunc dicit falsum testimonium qui mentitur, cum aut peccatum alicuius vel fingit vel tegit, aut alicui obest quoquo modo? Si enim mendacium quod adversus vitam cuiusquam temporalem dicitur detestabile est; quanto magis quod adversus vitam aeternam? sicuti est omne mendacium, si in doctrina religionis fiat. Et ideo falsum testimonium vocat Apostolus, si quis de Christo, etiam quod ad eius laudem videtur pertinere, mentiatur. Si autem mendacium sit, quod neque cuiusquam peccatum aut confingat aut tegat, nec a iudice quaeratur, et nulli obsit et prosit alicui; nec falsum testimonium esse, nec reprehensibile mendacium? Or perhaps, does the person who lies then utter false witness when he either invents or hides any man's sin, or hurts any man in whatever way? For, if a lie spoken against a man's temporal life is detestable, how much more one against eternal life? As is every lie, if it take place in doctrine of religion. And it is for this reason that the Apostle calls it false witness, if a man tell a lie about Christ, yea, one which may seem to pertain to His praise. Now if it be a lie that neither invents or hides any man's sin, nor is answered to a question of the judge, and hurts no man, and profits some man, are we to say that it is neither false witness, nor a reprehensible lie? An mentiendum ne prodatur vel homicida, vel innocens quaesitus ad mortem. [13.22] Quid ergo, si ad christianum homicida confugiat, aut videat quo confugit; et de hac re interrogetur ab eo qui ad supplicium quaerit hominem hominis interfectorem? mentiendum est? Quomodo enim non tegit peccatum mentiendo, cum ille pro quo mentitur, peccatum sceleratum admiserit? An quia non de peccato eius interrogatur, sed de loco ubi lateat? Ergo mentiri ad tegendum cuiusquam peccatum, malum est; mentiri autem ad tegendum peccatorem, non est malum? Ita sane, ait quispiam: non enim tunc peccat quisquam, cum evitat supplicium; sed cum facit aliquid dignum supplicio. Pertinet autem ad disciplinam christianam, ut neque de cuiusquam correctione desperetur, neque cuiquam poenitendi aditus intercludatur. Quid, si ad iudicem ductus de ipso loco ubi se ille occultet interrogeris? dicturus es, aut: Non ibi est, ubi eum scis esse; aut: Non novi et non vidi, quod nosti et vidisti? Dicturus ergo es falsum testimonium, et occisurus animam tuam, ne occidatur homicida? An usque ad conspectum iudicis mentieris, iudice autem quaerente iam verum dices, ne sis falsus testis? Ipse igitur hominem proditione occisurus es. 22. What then, if a homicide seek refuge with a Christian, or if he see where the homicide have taken refuge, and be questioned of this matter by him who seeks, in order to bring to punishment a man, the slayer of man? Is he to tell a lie? For how does he not hide a sin by lying, when he for whom he lies has been guilty of a heinous sin? Or is it because he is not questioned concerning his sin, but about the place where he is concealed? So then to lie in order to hide a person's sin is evil; but to lie in order to hide the sinner is not evil? Yea, surely: says some one: for a man sins not in avoiding punishment, but in doing something worthy of punishment. Moreover, it pertains to Christian discipline neither to despair of any man's amendment, nor to bar against any man the way of repentance. What if you be led to the judge, and then questioned concerning the very place where the other is in hiding? Are you prepared to say, either, He is not there, when you know him to be there; or, I know not, and have not seen, what you know and hast seen? Are you then prepared to bear false witness, and to slay your soul that a manslayer may not be slain? Or, up to the presence of the judge will you lie, but when the judge questions you, then speak truth that you be not a false witness? So then you are going to slay a man yourself by betraying him. Etiam proditorem quippe divina Scriptura detestatur. An forte proditor non est, qui iudici interroganti verum indicat; esset autem proditor, si quemquam ad exitium ultro deferret? Quid, si de iusto atque innocente ubi lateat sciens a iudice interrogeris, qui tamen ad mortem a maiore potestate iussus est rapi, ut ille qui interrogat exsecutor sit legis, non conditor? an ideo non erit falsum testimonium quod pro innocente mentieris, quia nec ille iudex, sed exsecutor interrogat? Quid, si ipse conditor legis interroget, aut quilibet iudex iniquus ad supplicium quaerens innocentem? quid facies? falsus testis, an proditor eris? An ille erit proditor, qui iusto iudici latentem homicidam ultro detulerit; et ille non erit, qui iudici iniusto ubi lateat innocens quem quaerit occidere, interroganti indicaverit eum qui se fidei eius commiserat? An inter crimen falsi testimonii et proditionis dubius incertusque remanebis? An tacendo, vel profitendo te non esse dicturum, certus utrumque vitabis? Cur ergo non hoc facias, priusquam ad iudicem venias, ut caveas etiam mendacium? Evitato enim mendacio, omne testimonium falsum effugies; sive omne mendacium sit falsum testimonium, sive non omne: evitato autem falso testimonio quod tu esse intellegis, non effugies omne mendacium. Quanto ergo fortius, quanto excellentius dices: Nec prodam, nec mentiar? Surely the betrayer too is one whom the divine Scripture detests. Or haply is he no betrayer, who in answer to the judge's interrogation gives true information; but would be "
