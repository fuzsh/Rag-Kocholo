        "text": "The important thing here is to make a distinction between the gerund and the gerundive. The gerund looks exactly like the masculine or neuter singular forms of gerundive, but they are two different things. Gerundive is also known as passive future participle, and this alternative name describes its use quite well. Gerund is more like the infinitive; infinitive is only used in nominative and accusative functions, and other cases are covered by gerund and supine. The gerund is a noun, the gerundive is an adjective, so to say.\n\nIn your example convertendo is a gerund. In convertendo means literally \"in turning\", and is more naturally translated here as \"when turning\". Here gerund (as infinitive or supine would) describes the action of turning in general, not really referring to present tense â€” or any other tense.\n\nI hope this makes the situation clearer. Let me know if there is something more you would like to have explained about this."
