        "text": "In recent decades, the music of Jan Dismas Zelenka (1679-1745) has been the object of increasing interest to scholars and performers of eighteenth-century music. Zelenka was one of a contingent of Bohemian musicians working at the Dresden court during the first half of the eighteenth century, when connections between the Province of Bohemia and the Saxon city were strong. The repertoire of sacred music accumulated and performed for Dresden&#39;s Catholic court church during Zelenka&#39;s career represents one of the crowning artistic achievements of that court. However, a detailed study of the complete set of Zelenka&#39;s Ave regina coelorum settings (ZWV 128) has not yet been undertaken.\n\nJan Dismas Zelenka (1679-1745) enjoyed a long and productive career at the court of Dresden, arriving in 1710 or 1711 to take up a position as violone player and later moving to duties associated with the roles of Kapellmeister or vice-Kapellmeister, 'Kirchen-Compositeur' (principal church composer to the court) and curator of the royal music library. He maintained strong relationships with members of the Dresden royal household during the reigns of Friedrich August I (also known as King August II of Poland and August the Strong) and later Friedrich August II (later King August III of Poland). The conversion of Friedrich August I to Catholicism in 1697 paved the way for a resurgence of musical activities for Catholic liturgies and devotional practices in Dresden. As a Catholic from Bohemia, Zelenka was well placed to help spearhead the musical life of the Catholic court church in Dresden. Particularly significant was the marriage in 1719 of the Electoral Prince Friedrich August to the Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria who brought to Dresden a strongly developed devotional outlook formed by her Habsburg upbringing. As electoral princess and later as queen in Dresden, Maria Josepha exercised enormous influence on the provision and performance of Catholic sacred music. Zelenka counted as one of the most highly regarded musicians at court and seems to have had a close personal association with Maria Josepha, which may have influenced his approach to various works including his six settings of the Marian antiphon 'Ave regina coelorum' (ZWV 128). From late in Zelenka's career (1737), these settings are now available in a modern edition prepared by Frederic Kiernan. All except one of these settings (number 4) is a first edition. Certain challenges were before Kiernan as he undertook this edition. The sole surviving source for these settings comprises the score and a single violin part (for setting number 2). The original performing parts are lost. Located at the Sächsische Landesbibliothek-Staats-und\n\nModern scholarly interest in Jan Dismas Zelenka (1679–1745) tends to focus on his compositional activities, while an understanding of his contribution as a contrabassist to the Dresden Hofkapelle dur- ing his first decade of service to Saxon Elector and King of Poland Augustus the Strong (1670–1733) remains substantially incomplete. This article examines how this second decade of the eighteenth cen- tury saw significant change to the Dresden bass section and orchestra as a whole, through a move away from engaging multi-instrumentalists to those specializing on a single instrument, the arrival of a new wave of internationally trained personnel and transition to new instrument types. Archival sources of the Dresden court record many details about individual employment and changes to the Hofkapelle’s size and administration from its reestablishment in 1709 (after being briefly disbanded). Drawing on these primary sources, this article reconstructs aspects of the careers of Zelenka and his colleagues in the contrabass section, and concludes that Zelenka’s activities as a contrabassist in Dresden should be viewed as a key part of a larger plan by the court to modernize the orchestra.\n\nThe music inventory of the Knights of the Cross with the Red Star from 1737 belongs to the paradigmatic sources both within research of “the musical culture of eighteenth-century Bohemia” (to cite the title of Barbara Ann Renton’s dissertation) and the exploring of rich terrain of music inventories from Czech lands started with the Jiří Fukač’s founding work about this immense source discovered by him. Paradoxically, Fukač’s edition of the Knights of the Cross inventory remains unpublished, while all subsequent studies drew from his typescript rather from the original source. What picture does the inventory provide of music culture in Prague of the time? And what place does Jan Dismas Zelenka and his compositions occupy in this context? The article aims to search for possible answers to these questions by analysing data from the column “Productio”, which has received minimum attention since Fukač’s effort."
