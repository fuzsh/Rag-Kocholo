        "text": "Among the art treasures of Dresden is a collection of music manuscripts that in part goes back to the repertoire of the Dresden Hofkapelle, which was founded more than 450 years ago and became world famous in the 18th century. Looking through the contents of âSchrank No.IIâ, the former repository of the Dresden court chapelâs repertoire, one discovers about 140 instrumental compositions by Telemann from the time between about 1710 and the 1750s. The selection presented in this album again contains a number of musical discoveries that easily match the artistic standard of the Musique de table.\n\nAll the Boccherini works presented in this recording are comparatively late. They were written in the 1780s, when the composer had already lived in Spain for many years after his travels in Europe, and represent Boccheriniâs classical, mature style. The album opens with his Sinfonia Concertante in D major (G 516; Op.37 No.2) that after the Second World War was presumed lost. In fact the manuscript had been brought to the USSR with other trophy music scores. After being preserved for many years in the Manuscript Department of the Glinka State Central Museum of Musical Culture, it was finally identified and restored to life.\n\nJoseph WÃ¶lfl, who has gone down in history as âBeethovenâs rivalâ, wrote operas, ballets, piano and chamber music â and three symphonies. The third has been preserved only in the form of a piano reduction. The two others, that are not yet familiar to the general public, have been recorded for the first time.\n\nThe transformation of an instrumental piece into a dance was not an extraordinary occurrence for the French Baroque theatre. In this domain it was common to sing a Chaconne or to dance an aria, court performances envisaged vocal numbers together with dances. For that reason, the appearance of Jean-FÃ©ry Rebelâs âchoreographed symphoniesâ merits special attention: apparently these pieces were the first ballets without singing. The famous French magazine Diapason gave us 5 âdiapasonsâ for this albumâthe highest score!\n\nAfter his successes in Italy and later England Johann Christian Bach gained a reputation as one of the most authoritative musicians of the second half of the 18th century. Of course any mention of âthe famous Bachâ referred to the junior Bach, not his father. The album opens with his Sinfonia Concertante in G major (C 45, T 286/4) that is listed as missing. In 2004 it was discovered and subsequently identified by Moscow music scholar Pavel Lutsker. This recording is a world premiere.\n\nGeorg Philipp Telemann wrote more than a hundred orchestral suites. The majority of these diverse and beautifully orchestrated pieces remain unknown to the wider audience. We intend to fill the gap over the next few years by recording all the composer's works in this genre. The Pratum Integrum Orchestra and soloists from leading European music ensembles practising authentic performance will participate in the project.\n\nIn the first album: Suites in D Minor (TWV 55:d2), E Minor (TWV 55:e3) and B Minor (TWV 55:h1).\n\nTelemann is one of the first composers â if not the first â to have made the genre of orchestral overture a vessel for the most diverse styles, a collection of heterogeneous elements of dance and character pieces, of description and imitation. The next generation saw Telemann as the most significant composer of overtures, who in their eyes eclipsed even the French in their own national genre. This is the third album of orchestral suites by G. P. Telemann, which again represents music little known to the public.\n\nThe second album with compositions of Austrian classical composer Joseph WÃ¶lfl (see also CM 0022005). It would be no exaggeration to say that WÃ¶lflâs quartets Op.30 (1805) are among the best of his chamber works. They are recorded for the first time by soloists of Pratum Integrum orchestra, performing on period instruments: Dmitry Sinkovsky (violin), Sergei Filchenko (violin), Sergei Tischenko (viola) and Pavel Serbin (cello).\n\nThe first monographic album devoted to an outstanding Russian composer of XVIII century Maxim Berezovsky. It contains the secular works, among those â a recently discovered Sinfonia in C major (the earliest Russian symphony). Six out of eight presented works have been recorded for the first time.\n\nWho is Giovanni Benedetto Platti? Today it is only a name, and an unknown name at that. One of many. In the 21st century, our acquaintance with Platti is just beginningâand it promises to be a moving and fascinating one.\n\nThe second album with Georg Philipp Telemannâs orchestral suites contains his Six Ouvertures a 4 ou 6, which the composer united into a set and published in Hamburg in 1736. The Pratum Integrum orchestra used the original printed score for its interpretation. It was considered lost, but recently a copy has been found in the archives of the Russian State Library in Moscow. Soloists of the Zefiro ensemble, historic horn players Dileno Baldin and Francesco Meucci took part in this recording. Four out of six suites were recorded for the first time ever.\n\nThis 18th-century opus is usually performed in a modernized version, which differs significantly from the authorâs intention. With the aim to reconstruct the initial shape of this composition, the Pratum Integrum orchestra has offered its interpretation of literary and musical text of the melodrama. For the first time in 200 years, a horn orchestra participated in performing Orfeo (such orchestras were popular in Russia from mid-18th until mid-19th century, but later fell out of prominence). Among the performers are stage actors Alexey Ivashchenko and Maria Shorstova, and the Horn Orchestra of Russia from St. Petersburg."
