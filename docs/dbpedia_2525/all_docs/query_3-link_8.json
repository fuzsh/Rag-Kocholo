        "text": "Cori spezzati or ‘choirs broken’ polychoral antiphony was a key influence in reshaping Renaissance practices into an identifiably distinct Baroque style. This article traces proto-antiphonal influences to Adrian Willaert’s groundbreaking polychoral Salmi spezzati and its refinement afterward.\n\nRoots of Polychoral Antiphony\n\nThe Common Origin Story\n\nPolychoral antiphony was for centuries said to have been a single composer’s invention in a single work at a single place: Adrian Willaert’s 1550 Vespers Psalms at Basilica San Marco in Venice. This origin story was taught and perpetuated in the writings of Gioseffo Zarlino (1517-1590), Willaert’s successor at San Marco who based his influential modal theory on Willaert’s collection of motets and madrigals titled Musica nova.\n\nSet in a range of modes, these Salmi spezzati di Messer Adriano—as titled in publication—draw from the cycle of Psalms 109-147 used in the Vespers liturgy, leading to their common reference as Palmi vesperales. Each is assigned a specific recitation tone and mode, as listed with Latin titles and Psalm numbers.\n\nConfitebor tibi Domini, Psalm 110, Primi toni (first tone or mode, Dorian).\n\nCredidi propter quod locutus sum, Psalm 115, Quarti toni (fourth, Hypophrygian).\n\nDe profundis, Psalm 129, Quinti toni (fifth, Lydian).\n\nDomine probasti me, Psalm 138, Octavi toni (eighth, Hypomyxolydian).\n\nIn convertendo Dominus, Psalm 125, Sexti toni (sixth, Hypolydian).\n\nLaudate pueri Dominum, Psalm 112, Primi toni.\n\nLauda Hierusalem, Psalm 147, Secundi toni (second, Hypodorian).\n\nMemento Domine David, Psalm 131, Octavi toni.\n\nSlowly but surely musicologists have chipped away at the common story of the origins of this set of works. In an original organization of this research, I trace in the following sections six unique and separate expressive influences to polychoral antiphony, and specifically to Willaert’s set of broken-choir Psalms (see Chart 1).\n\nChart 1. Expressive influences on Willaert’s benchmark Salmi spezzati.\n\nMusical: Willaert’s Lineage\n\nPerhaps the most crucial precursor to polychoral antiphony is the mastery of joining and separating multiple polyphonic voices in counterpoint that Willaert brought to Venice from his Franco-Flemish cultural upbringing and musical training. Polychoral antiphony is a natural next step in an evolution dating back to Dufay, Ockeghem, and Josquin canonical structures, especially double canons involving multiple parts simultaneously weaved together.\n\nTo check for clues of proto-polychoral techniques, I offer the example of Willaert’s motet ‘Dulces exuviae’ (Fig. 1). This work reflects the Renaissance fascination with ancient Greece and Rome with its secular Latin text from Virgil’s Aeneid of the Trojan hero’s love affair with Dido, queen of Carthage, and her lamentful reflection on her life before committing suicide. Portions Willaert set in aligned rhythms are sensitive to the structure, speech pattern, and harmonic coloring of the text, all characteristics associated with the general Venetian style he fostered. Polyphonic lines expound on text using age-old devices of rising and falling melodic contours–highlighted in darker lines and boxes in Figure 1–and quick rhythmic figures exposed against longer open spaces that serve to refocus attention to each individual voice in turn. Expanded and compressed voice spacing between lines presents a source of tension and release apart from harmony, and expresses the particular inflection and intensity of Willaert’s physical delivery of text—even in small nuances such as “Dulces” and “dum facta.” In performance, this requires a leanness of tone and deliberate shifting in the weight and dynamic intensity of the voice to carry out its natural acoustic effects and nuanced expressions.\n\nFigure 1. Expressive shape analysis: Adrian Willaert Dulces exuviae, opening excerpt.\n\nGoing a next step in interpreting the work’s expression, a brilliant mix of color and physical emotionality comes into view. A hesitant sweetness is painted by A-minor (i.e. Ionian) to C-major (i.e. Aeolian) harmonies on “Dulces,” and tightened voice spacing and lengthened and intertwined dotted rhythms across C, Dm, and its A-major secondary dominant paint a bright yet drifting and internally twisted remains of a life. The polyphonic texture, freer rhythms, cross-voice imitation, and voice-leading shifts of mode of the second phrase fill the fates of the gods with an airier, loftier quality. The flat-line “Accipite” is a chant-like holy recitation on a soul literally suspended in animation, the recitation repeated in earnest angularity and followed by rising and falling pleas for absolution from life’s cares.\n\nExceptional craftsmanship—sensitive, deeply expressive, poignant, and unexaggerated—are worthy of Zarlino’s tribute of Willaert’s creations as the quintessential Renaissance expressive art and worthy of the credit granted him for influencing the rise of a unique Venetian style. They do not, however, display obvious proto-polychoral characteristics to his 1550 Psalm settings. The closest examples in Dulces exuviae are two instances of 3:1 voice pairings on “Accipite hanc animam” and “Acipite animam,” the first isolating a lingering solo Alto line against STB and the second distinguishing an early lone entrance in uppermost voice against a rhythmically aligned lower voices, these examples posing no advancement on paired voicing he brought with him to Venice.\n\nFurthermore, a search through Willaert’s greater musical output isolates his eight broken-choir Psalm settings as exclusive examples of their type. Even his Franco-Flemish echoes and imitations between pairs of voices are more prevalent in secular compositions than his sacred, and used more for purposes of color and range contrast.\n\nMusical: Regional Roots\n\nHowever, the story of the rise of antiphony has changed in the past century with new ventures looking deeper into the music and other archives of Italian churches. By 1975, Anthony Carter had compiled a list of 93 spezzati choral Psalm and canticle settings other than Willaert’s eight, coming from Padua, Treviso, and other locations centered around Northern Italy.[1]\n\nThe conclusion is that Willaert’s eight Salmi spezzati had merely bettered the awkward homegrown techniques of earlier experiments. As he did with madrigals Willaert took a native Italian form of musical expression and set an historic new benchmark.\n\nArchitectural: Acoustical Roots\n\nSecond we explore the role attributed to St. Mark’s Basilica in Venice in the development of antiphony. Evidence of earlier antiphony in other Northern Italy cathedrals already discounts any claim that antiphony was invented in Venice. The question remains whether the unique design of choir lofts in St. Mark’s dictated certain antiphonal practices.\n\nIn a 1981 review of church records, David Bryant did uncover a long unchanging custom of liturgical double-choir performance, seemingly as cast in stone as the building itself, of one choir of a single solo voice per part set against a fuller choir singing Psalms for Vespers, Compline, Terse, and other Hours of solemn feasts.[2] However, records go on to cite choir performances from organ and choir lofts, a two-storied pulpit, a hexagonal pulpit, on newly made platforms, and in procession. The conclusion is that the structural design of St. Mark’s did not influence any one particular development of antiphony.\n\nLiturgical: Expressions of Church Traditions\n\nIn an alternate survey of church records likewise published in 1981, James Moore further attributes antiphonal music to another feature of St. Mark’s—its historical liturgical practices.[3] Laura Moretti reports in 2004 the discovery of an eyewitness account of a performance of Vespers Psalms at St. Mark’s prior to Willaert’s 1527 arrival in which Psalms were sung back and forth in solo plainsong and from solo plainsong to a professional choir singing in ad lib fauxbourdon polyphony.[4] This ‘false bass’ style of parallel vocal lines was from two to three generations before, and its continuation represents St. Mark’s as a place of long-held custom.\n\nThe conclusion here is that Willaert’s choral antiphony was merely an extension of existing practices. This is the better explanation, too, why the practice continued at St. Mark’s well after the rise of instrumental concerti, sacred symphonies, and other Baroque developments. The custom itself is a reason double-choir singing remained a custom.\n\nTextual: Roots in Poetic Form\n\nThe roots of antiphony in church traditions runs deeper than events at St. Mark’s, however. By the evidence of Northern Italy polychoral experimentation, antiphonal Psalms was the custom in the entire region. Looking deeper yet is its root word antiphon, which designates an ancient form of speaking or singing verses responsively one after the other, and also a text in the form of a response with a history strongly linked to responsive Psalms and canticles.\n\nPsalms were formed to be alternated between speaker and congregation, cantor and choir, or lean first choir chant and fuller second choir response. Psalms written in call and response form lend naturally to antiphonal singing, with cori spezzati a natural next step in the progression, and supported by the fact that Psalms were a chief source of texts for Venetian and Venetian-influenced double-choir compositions. Even Willaert’s decision to set eight Psalms in divided choirs was merely a practical matter of suiting the music to the form of the text.\n\nPolitical: Expressions of Hierarchical Power\n\nThe new evidence of an eyewitness account of plainsong chanting back and forth sheds light on a particular power structure involved in Psalm singing. Solo recitation occurs due to the leadership role granted to a single person, or two when the liturgical, scriptural, or musical practice requires. Choral singing is granted only for particular Mass services, portions of a Mass, or Offices. In the case of Willaert’s Salmi spezzati the shift to a choir of solo singers against a choir of fuller numbers represents a significant change in power structure at St. Mark’s.\n\nSuch a power shift is precisely what Venice itself represented. Those in power sought to use polychoral singing as a representation of its structure as a representative republic. In a 2010 doctoral dissertation, revealingly titled “Singing the Republic,” Masataka Yoshioka explains how Venice forged a polychoral culture in society and politics.[5] The metaphor is one of groups in harmony, the arrangement of two choirs singing antiphonally well fit to Venice itself. Venice leaders promoted rituals and practices that furthered their republican ideals, which is to say that they presented the mystique or myth of Venice for outward appearance, reputation, and influence. So again, Willaert is shown to have contributed musical expressions of forces already in motion.\n\nIndividual: Expressions of Psychoacoustic Solutions\n\nThere is a crucial conclusion remaining that fits the collective evidence coming into the history-changing appearance of Willaert’s Salmi spezzati. What he provided was the best-ever solutions to hearing Psalms being chanted and sung in large cathedrals.\n\nConfirming the origin story of Willaert’s singular role, the lineage he brought to Venice was one of classic, universal solutions to psychoacoustic problems. Read again the expressive shape analysis of Dulces exuviae and you will note how carefully he applied psychoacoustic principles in shaping each of his intimate reflections of the text. His contributions were deemed great because of his ability to have an audience hear, comprehend, and be moved by the expression carefully shaped into his music.\n\nConfirming the origin story of St. Mark’s architecture, polychoral singing solves several problems of a large cathedral. First, choirs have greater carrying power to be heard all around, which explains the upgrade from solo cantor to multiple-voice choirs. Second, multiple choirs singing in multiple locations solves problems of hearing in different locations across the cathedral. As found through modern acoustical and audience response measures,[7] St. Mark’s is a reverberant space with good clarity from any location, though different singing locations provide an optimal listening experience for different areas of the church. Suggesting conscious and deliberate design and political influence, the best place to hear singing is with the choir in the south pergola and the audience in the chancel, where the service is conducted and only the clergy, dignitaries, and choir are allowed. Even more telling is the single-best acoustical ‘sweet spot’ at the chair of the Doge ruler of the republic, and the worst being in the nave where the congregation stands or sits. Shifting locations to sing serves as a visible display of republican ideals, suits the changing needs and designs of scripture and liturgy, and represents a consideration of different parties’ ability to hear.\n\nAcoustic measures further suggest why composers experimented in polychoral techniques across the region, because of the unique perceptual problems posed by each cathedral’s acoustics. Acoustics of cathedrals and sections of cathedrals ranged from those best for slow chant—anything more is incomprehensible—to those well suited for complex polyphony, with poor conditions improved with the dampening effect of a crowd, tapestries, or other sound absorbing material. Perhaps regional composers’ solutions, optimized to the cathedral involved, were only awkward when attempting to refit them to other acoustic spaces. Suffice it to say, solutions at St. Mark’s have had historical appeal in varying acoustical situations, though not commonly today.\n\nThe Central Masterpiece of Polychoral Antiphony\n\nThe backstory now set, it comes time to see the music itself, in notation. But then comes the problem of finding the music in print, as it was not displayed in any scholarly source from which I’ve drawn these stories, which I found has a reason. In a 1969 edition of Willaert’s eighth Psalm setting, Memento Domine David, editor Joan Long describes how she could only find incomplete sets of partbooks between the 1550 printing and a 1557 collection.[8] Music was not printed as in a modern choral score with all parts aligned on a single page, but instead each line in the polyphony was printed in a separate partbook. To publish the work, Long reconstructed missing parts in the style of Willaert, and it is due to her contribution that our look at the music is possible.\n\nThe opening single line is an incipit, following a practice mostly left unwritten in choral Mass movements of a priest or cantor singing a starting fragment of the text and tune ahead of the choral entrance (Fig. 2, top). It is ambiguous whether the line is written for a single male voice in a one-voice-per-part choir or even if performed by a member of a choir. It does present a hierarchical role of leadership fitting church tradition.\n\nIn line with the first page excerpt, across the great majority of the work Willaert assigned a single verse of text to a single choir in normal polyphony. Note the opening crescendos and text declamation shaped by the rise in the opening line, singly by the second voice and then by a pair of lower voices. The top-most voice’s flat shape shifts expressive priority to metrical/rhythmic accent and the melodic accentuation by other voices, leaving it the least important voice in shaping expression at the opening. Four psychoacoustic solutions are notable that would aid hearing expressive gestures in reverberant spaces:\n\nWide leaps for stronger syllabic and word accentuation.\n\nStepwise rise and descent for subtler text declamation and shifts of color and dynamics.\n\nContrary and parallel motion between voices to add counterweight and volume to text emphasis and color.\n\nIsolation of individual and paired expressive gestures between longer rhythmic values in other voices.\n\nFigure 2. Expressive shape analysis: Long’s reconstructed Memento Domine David, opening and closing excerpts.\n\nWith a brief overlap of shared harmony in the transition, the alternating choir enters across the distance much as an elided second polyphonic complex would in normal polyphony. It is only in the closing section that both choirs join together (Fig. 2, bottom), which altogether create a voluminous and active climactic ending through added expressive devices of (e) a greater rate and number of elided polyphonic complexes, (f) staggered cross-voice expansions between changing pairs of voices, and (g) longer cascades of falling and rising scales. The two choirs are distinguished by slower activity in choir I and quicker action in choir II the same as individual lines in single-choir polyphony are distinguished. In such a complex sound environment in difficult acoustics, Willaert groups sounds by shared motion, harmonic color, text color and shape, and location, and isolates distinct expressions choir to choir, line by line, and expressive gesture to expressive gesture.\n\nThe Continuing Saga\n\nIn light of accumulated evidence, the fate of Venetian polychoral antiphony seemed already sealed by existing architectural, liturgical, textual, political, and musical influences, and primed for Willaert’s individual benchmark-setting contribution (again, see Chart 1). Moving forward to ensuing generations, prior trends make the conscious reshaping of polychoral expressions that much clearer (see Chart 2).\n\nChart 2. Expressive influences beyond Willaert’s benchmark Salmi spezzati.\n\nDissemination: Next Generation Influence\n\nBuried in accumulating facts is yet another realization to be made that the reputation of Willaert’s works is partly due to music dissemination. Whereas homegrown experiments in polychoral antiphony remained undetected until centuries later when uncovered in the archives of Northern Italian cathedrals, Willaert’s are consistently cited with utmost care as the earliest known double-choir responsorial works. Zarlino carried on a tradition of performing them because they were the only works of this sort available in print for some years. In turn, preparing choirs in performance made him intimately familiar with their construction, expressive interpretation, and emotional affect on multiple congregations across time. He knew of their enduring qualities because he endured in performing them and promoting them in his published modal theory. Taking circumstances to their greater historical affect, these works’ prime recognition in fostering Venetian polychoral antiphony was carried forward by their exposure to generations of performing musicians, attendees at performances, and music theorists.\n\nOne final point of dissemination is the role of Venice as a center of music culture and instruction. The essential characteristics of Willaert’s style he passed on to students Cipriano de Rore (ca. 1515-1565) and Andrea Gabrieli (ca. 1532-1585), and to Zarlino and other Italians who took over the reigns from the Franco-Flemish in making the Italian style most influential in late Renaissance and early Baroque. It is partly because he passed his lineage to new generations that his works were recognized through history.\n\nPsychoacoustic I: Local Innovations\n\nWillaert’s student Andrea Gabrieli expanded upon antiphony in his motets. His 1587 Concerti setting of the Christian nativity scene, Quem vidistis, pastore? (Fig. 3), has an appropriate question-and-answer formal structure. Choirs join together, overlap, and take turns as in a natural conversation. Furthering the lineage of Josquin and Willaert, expansion and contraction of textures spread across the vertical distance between both choirs, acoustically filling the space with more volume and intensity of sound than possible from a single choir’s location as in Willaert’s Memento Domine David. Similarities with Willaert’s Dulces exuviae (Fig. 1) include a single exposed line against a three pairing and expressive gestures exposed between longer spaced rhythms in other voices.\n\nFigure 3. Expressive shape analysis: Andrea Gabrieli Quem vidistis, pastore? barlines revealed as an ill-fit to free alternation of rhythmic modes so carefully shaped to expressive speech patterns.\n\nIn his expansions of antiphony are certain new psychoacoustic insights. Note in Figure 3 how both choirs are integral in filling out modal harmonies, with pitch members of vertical chords assigned at different ranges in each choir and only doubled as staggered entrances and separate phrases intertwine. Common harmonies emanating from both choir locations would have listeners fuse sound into one single mass, yet by the common rhythmic motion and textual vowel colors of paired voices within or across choirs, listeners are able both to combine and isolate separate elements within the mesh of polyphonic and homophonic textures. In simpler words, voice pairings exclusive to a single choir have us locate separate sounds, and pairings of voices from both choirs have us unify the like-moving voices across the spatial distance.\n\nClassic: Rome Antiphony\n\nFrom Venice and the surrounding region, polychoral antiphony spread across and beyond Italy. It was foremost a part of the output of Roman composers Costanzo Festa (c.1490-1545) and Palestrina, and it may have been during Lasso’s short turn in Rome that the Franco-Flemish composer was introduced to polychoral techniques.\n\nPalestrina demonstrated a unique classic solution of polychoral textures. In his Stabat Mater (Fig. 4), classic features of regular, short, clear-cut phrases prevail–such phrases well suited to singers as “breathable” or singable within a single breath. Careful text declamation and expression are shaped through shifting duple-triple rhythmic divisions, expanding-contracting voice spacing, and voice-leading into modal ‘chord’ colors. (For more about Palestrina’s Stabat Mater and Richard Wagner’s Romantic arrangement of it, go here.)\n\nFigure 4. Expressive shape analysis: Palestrina Stabat Mater, opening excerpt.\n\nCross-Cultural I: Cosmopolitan Expansion\n\nOrlando di Lasso (1532-1594) was a composer who more than any other achieved international fame within in his own lifetime. Born in Franco-Flemish Netherlands, active in Italy where he was acquainted with Willaert and Gabrielli, and residing in Bavaria from 1556 to 1557 and Munich from 1560 until his death, he assimilated diverse international musical styles into his own. A prolific composer of some 2,000 works, his output in secular genres includes French chanson, Italian villanella and madrigal, and German lieder in the older tenor cantus firmus style, motet-like imitative style, chanson-like rapid syllabic declamation, and equal-voiced madrigal style. In sacred genres he composed 50 Masses, more than 500 motets—which he favored, was best known for, and brought to a new historic high point—and 100 Magnificats. His late Masses for six to eight voices are masterworks of expression, especially three for double choir with techniques picked up in Italy and likewise made his own: Missa Bell’Amfitrit’altera, Missa Vinum bonum and Missa Osculetur me. Meanwhile back home, his Flemish contemporaries were still spinning seamless intertwined polyphony, especially in eight voices, and still considering it the higher art.\n\nMissa Osculetur me is built or parodied from his own motet of 1582, Osculetur me (Fig. 5), a setting of a text from the biblical Song of Songs that translates, “Let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth.” The motet is in a double-choir texture with general moods and melodic expressions shifting choir to choir in ways suggested by text in an ongoing exchange of dialogue. Only on occasion do choirs antiphonally echo or imitate the same passages, as on “Trahe me post te” shown in Figure 5.\n\nFigure 5. Lasso Osculetur me motet excerpt.[i]\n\nQuite unlike Palestrina, Lasso set phrases in irregular, uneven, and at times long-breathed lengths, perhaps with a section for a single choir divided into short-breathed phrases of a mere word or two, as on “Ideo.” The texture is deceivingly vertical, its linear construction revealed by the entrance of one or more voices staggered, unaligned internal rhythms and melismas, and homorhythmic phrase starts that break back into offset rhythmic melismas, all noticeable in Figure 5.\n\nLasso’s practice was to parody the model material most precisely to begin the Kyrie. Then he selectively distributed the set of motives from the motet under the Latin. The antiphonal “Trahe me post te” is recast in almost every movement of the Mass, especially so in the second Kyrie where the final statement is unexpectedly raised a third with an added soprano entry isolated by an offset rhythm. Elsewhere he rewrote or extended the music of the model in sophisticated parody treatment in the quartet that begins at “Crucifixus,” and the opening bars of the Sanctus and the Agnus Dei. The Benedictus seems to be newly composed altogether.\n\nSimpler secular works, such as Lasso’s Echo Song, O la, o che bon eccho (Fig. 6), made polychoral antiphony accessible to most any sizable mixed-voice choir and immediately appealing to the masses. As in Willaert’s benchmark polychoral solutions, choirs are grouped together momentarily by common harmonies in moments of overlap, and yet are hearable separately by tapering phrase starts or endings, and by placing greatest rhythmic, melodic, metrical, and textural emphasis on exposed moments between. As was both Willaert’s and Palestrina’s practice in chordal textures, Lasso shaped each section of broken text with classical expansion of contrary-motion arches and contours.\n\nFigure 6. Expressive shape analysis: Lasso O la, o che bon eccho! opening excerpt.\n\nPsychoacoustic II: Monteverdi’s Path of Discovery\n\nFrom here we return to Venice and to Claudio Monteverdi, now two generations removed from Willaert. Monteverdi is a key figure bridging the lines of discussion across the evolution from classic polyphony to antiphony. His adaption of polychoral antiphony is but one part of the expressive, harmonic, concerted ‘second practice’ that he declared as a new era.\n\nIt is in Monteverdi’s long innovative career that a natural development of musical expression toward this new era is evident. Pulling but a single example from each of Monteverdi’s first six of nine published books of madrigals (Fig. 7), notice the logical shifts from:\n\nPairs of voices set against pairs of voices, to multiple voices set against multiple voices, to multiple voices in one choir set against multiple voices in a second choir;\n\nLinear construction of paired voices within polyphonic textures, to vertical construction of blocked voices in mixed polyphonic/homophonic textures, to linear construction of individual or paired voices ‘accompanied’ by vertically-constructed chordal blocks of voices; and\n\nUnaccompanied voices to voices harmonized by basso continuo, and then in a leap of insight and innovation in Vespers to add instrumental ‘voices’ to double choral voices for new and unique unified colors, add new contrasting colors within a choral texture in a vocal melodic style over basso continuo, and contrast choral voices in a vocal style with instrumental voices in an instrumental melodic style.\n\nFigure 7. Monteverdi’s polyphonic pairings to polychoral/polytimbal forces, linearity to verticality, vocal style to distinct instrumental style.[ii]\n\nMonteverdi’s shifting expressive language reflects a growing awareness of psychoacoustic principles in how listeners group and separate sounds in a complex acoustical environment. Voices shaped to move rhythmically together are grouped into a single harmonic and timbral color, and voices shaped to move rhythmically apart are isolated as distinct timbral colors. Voices moving rhythmically together yet on different fragments of text are heard separately based on three psychoacoustic devices: unique staggered entrance points help listeners track each line by their ‘first arrival’ or ‘first look’ at each, isolation by pitch location is enhanced by distinct vowel color or timbre separation, and voices arriving from different locations are isolated by the timing and direction of their arrival to our interaural or binaural hearing.\n\nIn a nutshell, advancements in music to this point reflect unprecedented new awareness that sounds we group together as one (a) come from the same source location, (b) start, continue, flow, vary, and end together, (c) occur in the same pitch range, and (d) relate in acoustic overtones to a single harmony and timbre; and that sounds we separate as distinct (a) arrive from different source locations, (b) start and end at different times or do not flow or vary together, (c) are in different pitch ranges, and (d) are unrelated in overtones and instead relate to different harmonies or timbres. By the evidence of expressive textural shaping presented in this chapter, separation and grouping of voices by spatial location requires a standing order of singers top voice on one side to lowest voice on the other, either right to left or left to right, and at least some distance between double choirs.\n\nChoral music notation of the Renaissance evidences a burgeoning awareness of previously untapped psychoacoustic principles. First, thick-thin and open-closed chord spacings are employed to isolate and combine sounds in increasingly complex textures. Leaner open chords allow the necessary space to ‘peer through’ to hear distinctions, whereas thicker closed chords draw sounds into a single perceived mass. Leaner textures, being quieter and less vibrantly intense by the fewer number of exposed voices, lend to a perception of sound being farther away, whereas thicker and fuller textures are naturally louder by intensity and quantity of sound and give the impression of sound being close or coming closer. Such mastery of new devices represents a growing human consciousness passed down for all times through the mere notation of choral music.\n\nCross-Cultural II: Expansion Outside of Italy\n\nFrom Italy, polychoral antiphony spread from Palestrina to Spain through his student Tomás Luis de Victoria and others in Rome during the Spanish occupation. It then spread to Vienna and Prague through Jacob Handl-Gallus (1550-1591) and compatriots, and on to Germany via Orlando di Lasso (ca. 1530-1594) in Munich, Hans Leo Hassler (1564-1612) who studied with Andrea Gabrieli, Michael Praetorius (1571-1621) who studied under Andrea Gabrieli and was a lifelong friend of Giovanni, Heironymus Praetorius (1560-1629), Heinrich Schütz who studied under Giovanni Gabrieli and Monteverdi, Johann Hermann Schein (1586-1630), and Samuel Scheidt. Reprints of antiphonal music in Germany, as was the case with Quem vidistis, pastore? in Nürmberg, further demonstrate the Venetian school’s spread, influence, and popularity in Germany. Polychoral antiphony spread deep into the Baroque era in the works of Antonio Vivaldi, Johann Sebastian Bach, George Friderick Handel, and other substantial Austro-German composers.\n\n[1] Carter, Anthony F., “The Psalms of Willaert and His North Italian Contemporaries,” Acta Musicologica 47, Fasc. 2 (July-December 1975), 270-283, retrieved December 17, 2016 from http://www.jstor.org/stable/932213.\n\n[2] Bryant, David, “The ‘cori spezzati’ of St Mark’s: Myth and Reality,” Early Music History 1 (1981), 165-186, accessed December 17, 2016, http://www.jstor.org/stable/853747.\n\n[3] Moore, James H., “The Vespero delli Cinque Laudate and the Role of Salmi Spezzati at St. Mark’s,” Journal of the American Musicological Society 34 (1981), 249-78.\n\n[4] Moretti, Laura, “Architectural Spaces for Music: Jacopo Sansovino and Adrian Willaert at St Mark’s,” Early Music History 23 (2004), 153-184, translated by Hugh Ward-Perkins, retrieved December 17, 2016 from http://www.jstor.org/stable/3874768.\n\n[5] Yoshioka, Masataka, “Singing the Republic: Polychoral culture at San Marco in Venice (1550-1615)” (doctoral dissertation, University of North Texas, 2010), UMI No. 3452005.\n\n[6] Marrocco, W.
