        "text": "Although the activities of the Concert Spirituel are usually studied through the concert programs compiled by Constant Pierre in 1899 and emended by Antoine Bloch-Michel in 1975, the data they provide about individual pieces of music are sketchy. Eight inventories of Concert Spirituel music, two published here for the first time, are more specific. They generally give title and composer, and they also include works that were acquired but not performed. The Concert Spirituel did not have a single music library: instead, each entrepreneur built his own, treating it as a commercial asset that could be leased to his successors. Changes in repertoire usually ascribed to changing musical taste (the querelle des bouffons in the 1750s and the révolution musicale circa 1770) can be linked to these lease agreements (which kept older works in the repertoire) and to refusals to make these agreements, which caused old music to be replaced with new works. Taken together, the inventories form a chronicle of changing musical taste in Paris from 1734 to 1778. Appended to the article are transcripts of the Paris Opéra’s 1748 inventory of Concert Spirituel music, and a newly discovered inventory of music that Pancrace Royer assembled between 1748 and 1755. The latter is particularly valuable for studying the early history of the concert symphony in France, since it contains a list of the French, Italian, and German symphonies that Royer played.\n\nThe querelle des bouffons was nearly over when Pancrace Royer, a French composer with a fondness for Italian music, made his contribution: a choral version of Pergolesi’s Stabat mater that became one of the most frequently played pieces in the history of the Paris Concert Spirituel. Other choral arrangements followed by Hiller, Vogler, Eybler, Salieri, and Lvov. Royer’s score, had it survived, could have told us much about why the Stabat appealed to broader audiences than had La serva padrona. A choral version of the Stabat survives in Lyon, written in the hand of Nicolas-Antoine Bergiron de Briou, who was active in the Concert de Lyon for almost half a century. Is it a copy of Royer’s work? Two newly identified chorus parts from the Concert Spirituel music library suggest that it is, but there are discrepancies that cannot, as of yet, be explained. My research on the filiation issue generated insight into a broader question: how did French arrangers modify the new Italian style to make it more attractive to French audiences? The adjustments were remarkably few: restructuring the work to fit into a familiar genre; increasing contrast between movements by inserting choruses; replacing alien castrato voices with more familiar ones; cutting out phrase repetitions; deemphasizing fast movements in sacred music, and shortening a lengthy work. These changes gave the galant style a broader base in France, and within twenty years, the long reign of seventeenth-century operas and motets came to an end there."
