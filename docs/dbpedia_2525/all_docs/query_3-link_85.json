        "text": "On January 7, 1811 the Prince Regent issued a specific call to the music master Marcos Portugal, who had remained in Lisbon despite already having been summoned to Rio de Janeiro in 1809 2.\n\nSon of Manuel António da Ascensão and Joaquina Teresa Rosa, Marcos António da Fonseca Portugal was born in Lisbon on March 24, 1762. His birth name was Marcos Antonio da Ascensão. He studied at the Patriarchal Seminary of Lisbon from 9 years old, having as teachers composers João de Sousa Carvalho and probably José Joaquim dos Santos, Father Nicholas Ribeiro Passo Vedro and António Leal Moreira, all teachers of the seminary at the time. He composed a \"Miserere\" at the age of 14. He first presented to the public, in 1780, at the Holy Patriarchal Church, two antiphons \"a canto dórgão\": \"Salve Regina\" and \"Sub tuum Præsidium\". At 20 he was already organist of the Patriarchal, with the salary of 12$500 per month. On July 23, 1783 he was admitted to the Brotherhood of St. Cecilia. The following year he was appointed conductor of the Teatro do Salitre, for which he composed farces, eulogies, interludes and modinhas 3. On September 1, 1787, he was also named composer of the Patriarchal, with his monthly salary increased to 50$000. 1782 marks the beginning of his collaboration with the royal family, as the Queen Mary I ordered him one \"Mass with instrumental\" for the Feast of St. Barbara, celebrated in the chapel of the Palace of Queluz. In 1792 he was awarded a scholarship to further his studies in Italy, where he remained for eight years. During this period, he wrote at least 21 operas, mostly comic and farcical, which garnered huge success throughout Europe, for in addition to the premieres in theaters for which they were written, in Ferrara, Florence, Milan, Naples, Venice and Verona, there were representations in Vienna, Paris, London, Dublin, St. Petersburg, Berlin, Dresden, Hamburg, Hannover, Leipzig, Nuremberg, Corfu, Barcelona, Madrid, Lisbon and Oporto 4.\n\nIn 1800 he returned to Portugal and besides retaining the position of composer of the Patriarchal Cathedral, he was named solfeggio master of the Royal Patriarchal Seminary and music master of the Royal Theater of São Carlos 5. He composed for the São Carlos opere serie, and just one opera buffa: \"L'oro non compra amore\". His music was required in most celebrations and events in the several Royal Chapels and Palaces, particularly Queluz and Mafra, where the court resided since late 1805 until the departure to Brazil two years later. In the years 1806 and 1807, he composed many works dedicated to the male voices of Franciscan monks, and the for the unique set of six organs in Mafra Basilica. Thirty of these works have survived and at least 11 were later reworked for mixed voices and the orchestra of the Royal Chapel of Rio de Janeiro 6. He remained in Lisbon on the occasion of the departure of the royal family to Brazil, in 1807. In that year, he presented an opera to General Junot, in the São Carlos theater, for which he was accused of unpatriotic activities 7. But another of his compositions was a cantata dedicated to the Prince Regent, and the final hymn was sung for many years as the Portuguese national anthem.\n\nThe composer left his hometown on March 6, 1811, on board of the frigate Princesa Carlota, which at the end of a three months journey, on June 11 arrived in Rio de Janeiro 8. Apparently, he was warmly received by the Prince. On June 23, four decrees were issued 9 stipulating in detail his income and benefits as music master of Their Royal Highnesses. Three days later, on June 26, it was celebrated in the Chapel Royal \"a solemn mass for the expulsion Napoleon's troops from Portugal of \" in Pontifical celebrated by the Dean with the assistance of the Bishop and First Chaplain. The music was probably the \"Mass the great instrumental to the Royal Chapel of Rio de Janeiro\", composed in Lisbon in 1810 and brought to Rio de Janeiro by the composer.\n\nAlthough, according to the disaffected Luís dos Santos Marrocos, he had \"fumos mui subidos\" (usually snobbish and unpleasant), his mythical first encounter with Nunes Garcia was apparently cordial 10. The priest, challenged to play a Haydn sonata on the harpsichord, after playing the piece received a hug and the statement: \"Beautiful! You are my brother in art! Surely you'll be a friend to me!\" 11.\n\nOn September 1811 Nunes Garcia delivered to the inspector of the Royal Chapel a \"Report of the works composed by José Maurício Nunes Garcia up to September 6, 1811\" 12, which contained about two hundred compositions, including those composed to the Cathedral of Rio de Janeiro. Nothing states, in this document, it was an account for his dismissment.\n\nOn October 9, Marcos Portugal was appointed inspector of the theaters, with his detailed obligations stated in a communication of the Earl of Aguiar 13. A few days later, he suffered a brain attack 14. which must have not been very serious, because on December 17 he conducted a \"Te Deum\" in the Mass which was baptized the infant Sebastião Gabriel, son of the Infanta Maria Teresa and Infant D. Pedro Carlos. Godparents were Queen Maria I and the Prince Regent. In the evening, to celebrate the Queen's birthday, it was sang in the Teatro Regio the opera \"L'oro non compra amore\" in premiere in Brazil. The work was composed for the Teatro São Carlos in 1804. Most of the singers were Italian, except two: the Brazilian singers João dos Reis Pereira, bass, and Joaquina da Lapa, nicknamed \"Lapinha\", soprano.\n\n1 FRANCISCO, C. S.

I think Sunday. - I will not wait for Sunday. Come tomorrow, I will call José Maurício. Bring some new piece for piano. Look that the Prince calls him the new Marcos. [...] - The next day, in fact, the two artists met in the afternoon in São Cristóvão, one of them full of triumphs and glories, of course arrogant, surrounded by the immense prestige given by ovations from audiences all over the civilized world, playing the role of uncontested authority and supreme arbiter; the other, José Maurício, a mulatto, poor, shy, completely unknown personally out of a limited circle, oblivious to the influence of the great centers of Europe, helpless of the example and the hearing of the masters, without ever having left the colony and even his native land, delivered to his own inspirations and having achieved the little he had at the cost of a lot of natural talent, refined study and painful ruminations, counting only with small resources in every way for the sake of expanding his artistic nature. [...] The princes were already seated in a room that flaunted not a modest harpsichord but a superb English manufacturing piano, surrounded by the court people especially invited to this unexpected exhibition. [...] After the due reverences, unfolded Marcos Portugal with calculated solemnity a piece of music he brought and handed it to José Maurício, asking him if had he ever heard about that author. It was one of the most difficult sonatas of Joseph Haydn. With missing and stuttering voice, the priest replied that, since very young, he knew much of the eminent master's repertoire, to whom he had a special devotion. And indeed, in his lectures on art, he would classify Haydn above Handel, side by side with Mozart and just below Beethoven, which he used to refer as divine. [...] - So, Mr. José Maurício, commanded the princess Dona Carlota, make us hear such a great great novelty. - I never played this sonata, objected the priest, and Your Highness... - But they say you play music at first sight, as anyone reading letter round... Sit down, sit down at the piano. There was no way back. The artist obeyed, and at the first chords, there was complete silence. The sonata had begun. In the beginning, José Maurício if not hesitated was at least lukewarm in playing. Gradually, however, he was back to saving calm. In focusing he called to himself all his energy and reacted against the shock that darkened his eyes and held his hands, overcoming all the difficulties of the exquisite work, already forgotten the place where he was and body and soul delivered to the wonderful harmonic deductions of the illustrious German whose pages he played with expression and ease increasingly pronounced. [...] Many, facing Marcos Portugal, read in the proud master's face a succession of impressions that gradually were overwhelming him, initially cold, disdainful, ironic, right after attentive, surprise, and finally filled with this expansive enthusiasm which thetruly artistic soul could not suppress, or obscure, and breaks out with irrepressible force in the loyalty to their rapture. José Maurício saw but nothing. He was all with Haydn. [...] Clarified the motives at four or five voices closely to the end of that fugato style of astounding richness and exuberance, Marcos Portugal had not hand to contain himself, and stood, perhaps in spite of his feet, and dying the last and vigorous sounds of the sonata, rushed to one that suddenly was made his equal and, amidst the warm applause of the princes and the Court, pressed him in his arms with great effusion. - 'Beautiful, cried he, gorgeous! You are my brother in art; surely you shall be to me a friend!'\" TAUNAY, Visconde de. José Maurício Nunes Garcia. São Paulo: Ed. Companhia Melhoramentos de São Paulo, 1930. pp. 17-20.\n\n11 Musicologist Marcelo Campos Hazan asserts that this encounter is a mythical construction of the Viscount of Taunay.
