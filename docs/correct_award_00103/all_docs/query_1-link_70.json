But what does it take for a work to be referred to as universal? And what can the Nobel Prize tell us about how we have viewed ourselves over time? How has the portrayal of the self and existence been shaped and influenced by various social changes?\n\nAn open conversation featuring:\n\nâAnders Olsson, writer, professor of literature at Stockholm University, former permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy.\n\nâCarin FranzÃ©n, professor of literature at Stockholm University.\n\nâIsabelle StÃ¥hl, writer and doctoral student in history of ideas at Stockholm University. She has also studied philosophy at SÃ¶dertÃ¶rn University and has a Masters degree in history of ideas from Stockholm University.\n\nModerator:\n\nâGabriella AhlstrÃ¶m\n\nOpen Lectures at the TranstrÃ¶mer Library is a joint project between the Stockholm Public Library and Stockholm University. Our lectures are always free and open to everyone."
