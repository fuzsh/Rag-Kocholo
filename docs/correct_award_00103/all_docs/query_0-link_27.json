And for writing?\n\nAn open conversation with researchers at Stockholm University ahead of this yearâs Literature Prize announcement.\n\nModerator: Karin Gyllenklev, journalist and presenter at Sweden Radio.\n\nThe conversation will take place live, with an opportunity for the audience to ask questions, but it will also be recorded as a podcast for later broadcasting."
