        "text": "July 19, 2024\n\nDeirdre Bair, may she rest in peace, was the first biographer to be permitted by the Master to attempt to infiltrate the impenetrable mist of obfuscation with which he purposefully had always surrounded himself. She was at the time an American former graduate student who lionized his enlightened aura.\n\nShe sees Beckett from the outside, being a little wet behind the ears.\n\nSure, she digs, and in fact was the first to publicly talk of Beckett's certified unstable mental health during and after the War. Beckett's ultimate authorized biographer, James Knowlson, dismissed such claims, though doubtless Bair, in the seventies had able access to interviews with Beckett's wartime confrères.\n\nHers is an extroverted biography. Perhaps she dug too deep for the writer's liking.\n\nIn it, for instance we learn of Beckett’s brief fling with the heiress Gloria Vanderbilt, terminated abruptly by Beckett, apparently, as her sophisticated lifestyle may have driven him close to his Dark Side, of which he was petrified.\n\nIn my understanding of his tight-lipped silence on that affair, Beckett's short piece First Love (1946) seems to be a radically symbolic and transmogrified treatment of that ill-fated liaison.\n\nÀ saint manqué, he always placed a very high value on his privacy.\n\nNeither extremely outgoing or In-dwelling, Beckett - when elderly - placed more faith In fixer-upper physical labour than public literary work, for release.\n\nIn his extremely brief work Neither, composed at a later time frame (1976), he spoke of his life as something shadowy. To me THAT'S most revealing. The horrors of WWII had altered him.\n\nWe must always move, his narrator says, between inner shadow and outer shadow, at our more centrist moments touching on an ineffable Neither.\n\nThat Neither, says his narrator, is our ultimate destination.\n\nAt almost 73, I must agree. The Neither is almost ultimate rest: almost but never quite.\n\nIt is neither:\n\nFrom nor toward -\n\nThere the dance is -\n\nA condition of complete simplicity\n\nCosting no less than everything. (Eliot, Four Quartets)\n\nBeckett really paid not less than everything -\n\nLiving his long, harried life in a state of acute anxiety, fear and trembling.\n\nFebruary 23, 2012\n\nI remember loving this biography which is detailed and insightful. However one reviewer on amazon (UK) says she 'fails to admit to herself the true extent of Beckett's insanity' - maybe, I don't know.\n\nmore notes from my 1983 diary/notebook:\n\ngot up to Joyce advising Beckett to use the particular and the personal. Lucia, disintegrating, starting to pay attention to ‘Sam’.\n\n(later) Beckett coming out in ’baby anthrax’ in Dublin, teaching, writing ‘More Pricks than Kicks’ then off to London.\n\n(later) read until 3:30am – he has written Murphy, lived in London, back to Dublin, trip to Germany, finally off to Paris. Catalogue of illnesses, boils etc… getting through the war, writing Watt.\n\n(later) As I read through the biography I seem to know the details already, and, of course, I do from his prose works, More Pricks, the Trilogy, Murphy are all autobiographical… to an extent.\n\nJanuary 4, 2012\n\nPersevere! This book has a tough beginning, but how else could it be? It's a reflection of his early life.\n\nThe book blossoms the way his life and work did, lightening immensely as he found his own literary voice, and then a measure of success, and then SUCCESS! Even without SUCCESS! his life would be a compelling read. It was filled with oddities, like meeting his life-mate after he's stabbed by a stranger (a pimp), on the streets of Paris. Although she's a musician, she's had nursing experience (!) so was able to keep him from bleeding out until he could get to a hospital.\n\nCommon wisdom says the work required to reveal a brilliant diamond is justified by the result. The short excerpts from Beckett's works, and quotes, and letters deliver a taste of his mature wit. His humor and words were spare, with just enough twist to stop you cold with appreciation. Once he stripped away the remnants of his influential mentor, and wrote with his own 'voice' his work became compelling.\n\nEarly in the book I found some elements of his childhood so depressing that I put the book down and picked up a romance novel, for relief. Fortunately for me, I returned to Beckett, pushed through the sad bits and found I was rooting for him, involved, fascinated, a little repulsed, but thoroughly captivated and impressed by his mastery and wit.\n\nDeirdre Bair took a tough Subject, and did him justice. I'm intrigued now, enough that I want to read his works, and see his plays. She's a fine, fine writer.\n\nJanuary 5, 2020\n\nYou'd have to be a fan of Beckett to tackle a book this size, and if you are, it will be worth it. Sam was quite the character, loyal, prickly, obnoxious. If you got on his good side, a friend for life, otherwise... His mother was a real piece of work, and the love/hate relationship he had with her probably colored many of his other relationships as well. A fascinating story.\n\nMarch 10, 2024\n\nWhile insightful at times, this biography seems bloated by a bit too much minutiae. Written without Beckett's help but with his approval, biographer Deirdre Bair has certainly done her homework. However, as with any \"first biograpy,\" subsequent efforts that adopt different strategies are bound to challenge its authority. Nonetheless, for those who are familiar with the work but not the man, this gives an intriguing glimpse into the influences that resulted in one of the most compelling bodies of work of the 20th century. For example, while interpretations are hardly worth the paper they're printed on (except to the individual doing the interpreting), it is helpful to note that Beckett's seminal dramatic masterpiece, \"Waiting for Godot,\" was written in the wake of WWII, when Beckett's entire milieu in his adopted home of Paris had not only been disrupted but permanently dismantled. This sense of having waited for something that will never recur may, it could be argued, have been one of any number of potential influences that bubbled up, whether consciously or not, as Beckett was writing \"Godot.\" Similar observations abound throughout the book.\n\nBair has focused heavily on Beckett's early life and middle period, giving the reader progressively less about the passing years as the mid-70s approach. This may be due to a paucity of information, but it feels as if the writer's energies may have been on the wane. Or, perhaps, she was trying to parallel Beckett's own progression from floridity to terseness as his ouvre progressed. And, of course, there is the lack of any information about the last decade of his life for the simple reason that he was still alive and active when this was written and published, despite his prognostications surrounding his own mortality. That having been said, the most glaring omission in a book that traces out the development of Beckett's work in a fair degree of detail is the absence of even a cursory bibliography of his \"major\" or \"notable\" works. In today's day and age, this is a trivial matter, and a Google search quickly rectifies this deficit. But in 1978, it may have been frustrating for readers.\n\nJuly 15, 2021\n\n'I first decided to become a writer when I heard Jung give a lecture about a little girl who had died a schizophrenic'because she had never been born, really'\".---Samuel Beckett. The late Deirdre Bair pulled off the impossible, writing a biography of Beckett with his cooperation. (This is a man who was tracked down in a cave in Tunisia to be informed he had won the Nobel Prize in Literature.) As anyone who has read his plays or novels could tell you, Beckett the man was as mysterious and shadowy as his characters.\n\nSeptember 29, 2017\n\nAn excellent, sensitively-written biography of the great Irish playwright. Strong on his early and middle years but I felt it tapered off towards the end and the last 25-30 years were rushed through. It was the only weakness.\n\nDecember 3, 2019\n\na wonderful detailed biography that kept me engaged and wanting to read more and more\n\nAugust 23, 2021\n\nAn incredibly thorough and insightful account of one of the most important writers of the twentieth century. It really does feel like you see the man behind the legend.\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\nI honestly cannot imagine this biography being any better than it is. Incredible job by Bair.\n\nMarch 12, 2022\n\nIn depth and fascinating, agonising and slow. Perfect for a Beckett biography\n\nMarch 30, 2008\n\nI read this book cuz I was doing a report on Samuel Beckett at the suggestion of my brother. I put on Isotope 217 and Radiohead's Kid A on repeat and read this book cover to cover in a matter of days. The angsty teenage blues found their antidote in this obsessive compulsive walker who had a posionous relationship with his overbearing mother. Deirdre Bair does biographies so good!\n\nSeptember 12, 2013\n\nI started reading this after finishing \"Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett\" by James Knowlson. I was so impressed by Knowlson that I was anxious to see if another biographer could come close to his insight and access. While this is an easier read than Knowlson's book I missed the detail of his efforts and found Bair's a bit flat and to the point. Good in detail but lacking insight.\n\nJuly 11, 2011\n\nThis was a decent biography-- but Deirdre clearly is feeling a bit of hero worship and doesn't get into some of the gritty details of Beckett's life. Read Knowlson's bio instead for an overwhelming amount of detail.\n\nWant to read\n\nJune 19, 2008\n\nsamuel beckett is a complete mystery to me...i loved endgame...but everything else he's written just makes me itchy...\n\nJuly 3, 2008\n\nAn EXCELLENT Bio of Beckett! I'm not a Bio reader, and this is very readable and interesting.\n\nSeptember 10, 2011\n\nProbably the best of the Beckett biographies, and I think I've read them all.\n\nAugust 22, 2011\n\nI would recommend this to any aspiring writer. I really like how he handled his career. It's also amazing how quickly he went from being a sad loser to Nobel prize. Crazy Crazy life.\n\nAugust 11, 2012\n\nSuperb, illuminating biography of the great Irish writer.\n\nNovember 7, 2012\n\nSuperior to Damned to Fame, but obviously less complete."
