        "text": "Pay-What-You-Can Performances Jan. 26 – 28 2023 with\n\nOpening/Press Performance Jan. 29 at 2:30pm.\n\nWashington, DC—The Washington Stage Guild continues its 2022-2023 season, a “Season of Transitions,” with Endgame by Samuel Beckett, directed by Alan Wade. Performances begin January 26 – 28 with four Pay-What-You-Can previews and run until February 19, 2023 at the Washington Stage Guild’s home, The Undercroft Theatre in the Mount Vernon Place United Methodist Church, 900 Massachusetts Avenue, NW. Opening/Press performance is Sunday, January 29 at 2:30pm.\n\nABOUT THE PLAY\n\nA quartet of characters inhabit a nearly empty room, surrounded by nothing, it seems. Do they want it to end, or can they go on with their limited lives? A pinnacle of Samuel Beckett’s characteristic raw minimalism, Endgame is a devastating distillation of the human essence in the face of approaching death. This profound and eerie masterpiece from the Nobel Prize recipient is considered by many critics to be his greatest single work.\n\n“We are so pleased to turn from one Nobel laureate, Major Barbara’s George Bernard Shaw, to another, Samuel Beckett,” says Artistic Director Bill Largess. “He has been an occasional presence on our stage since the Helen Hayes Award nominated performance by June Hansen in Happy Days (directed by Alan Wade) and has been a character in two productions—Lucia Mad and last season’s Sam & Dede, in which Beckett was played by Wade himself!”\n\n“Many literary critics have called Samuel Beckett’s Endgame his ‘masterpiece,’ states director Alan Wade. “Beckett said it was his play that he ‘disliked the least.’ That characterization rather typifies Beckettian humor which I hope will play an appropriate role in the Stage Guild’s production.”\n\nABOUT THE PLAYWRIGHT\n\nSamuel Beckett (1906-1989) is widely recognized as one of the greatest dramatists of the 20th century. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1969. Beckett is most renowned for his play Waiting for Godot, which launched his career in theatre. He then went on to write numerous successful full-length plays, including Endgame in 1957, Krapp’s Last Tape in 1958, and Happy Days in 1960. He received his first commission for radio from the BBC in 1956 for All That Fall. This was followed by a further five plays for radio, including Embers, Words and Music and Cascando. Like no other dramatist before him, Beckett’s works capture the pathos and ironies of modern life yet still maintain his faith in man’s capacity for compassion and survival, no matter how absurd his environment may have become.\n\nWashington Stage Guild has previously produced Beckett’s play Happy Days in 1990.\n\nABOUT THE TEAM\n\nThe cast of Endgame includes Bill Largess (Hamm), a founding member of WSG and the current Artistic Director. His WSG credits include Man & Superman, his own adaptation of Dante’s Inferno, as director, Murder in The Cathedral and Pygmalion, performing in an evening of Beckett plays at the 2000 International Beckett Festival, and appearing at nearly every D.C.-area theatre company, as well as nationally. His work has been nominated five times for Helen Hayes Awards. The cast also features Matty Griffiths (Clov), a freelance actor and director and former Executive Director/Founder of City Artistic Partnerships who recently appeared in Gwen & Ida (Nu Sass), Clothes for a Summer Hotel(Rainbow Theatre Project), and Driving Miss Daisy (Anacostia Playhouse); David Bryan Jackson (Nagg), returning to WSG having appeared previously in Candida, The Old Masters, Magic, The Best of Friends and Lord Arthur Savile’s Crime, and recently performed in A Number (Edge of the Universe Players 2/Capital Fringe) and Birds of North America (Mosaic Theater Company); Rosemary Regan(Nell), making her first appearance with WSG after a career that has wandered all over the DC area, including James Joyce’s ‘The Dead’ (Scena Theatre), An Inspector Calls (Shakespeare Theatre Company), Optimism! Or, Voltaire’s ‘Candide’ (Spooky Action Theater), and a variety of roles at Studio Theatre; and R. Scott Williams (Hamm alternate at Saturday evening performances), who is pleased to return to WSG following previous adventures in Mrs. Warren’s Profession, All Save One, Opus, Lord Arthur Savile’s Crime, and performances with Shakespeare Theatre Company, Olney Theatre Center, Theatre Alliance, and over 600 performances of Shear Madness at the Kennedy Center.\n\nEndgame is directed by Alan Wade, who previously directed several Stage Guild productions including the 1990 production of Beckett’s Happy Days featuring June Hansen. Mr. Wade’s one-man show I, from the prose of Samuel Beckett premiered at Chicago’s Victory Gardens Theatre in 1977 and was then performed in Baltimore and Boston. His latest audiobook narration for Audible is Watson and Holmes by E. B. Dawson.\n\nThe production team includes Joseph B. Musumeci, Jr. (Scenic Design), Marianne Meadows (Lighting Design), Stephanie Parks (Costume Design), Marcus Darnley (Sound Design), and Arthur Nordlie (Production Stage Manager).\n\nDATES & TICKETS\n\nEndgame by Samuel Beckett runs January 26 to February 19, 2023 with performances Thursday at 7:30pm, Friday at 8pm, Saturday at 2:30pm & 8pm, and Sunday at 2:30pm.

The ensemble theatre company’s acclaimed repertoire of neglected classics, unfamiliar works by familiar playwrights, and stimulating new plays from around the world is presented in a style that is the Guild’s own—direct and clear, with a strong commitment to adhering to the author’s intent.\n\n###"
