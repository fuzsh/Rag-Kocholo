        "text": "Perhaps the only new part about the most recent Nobel Prize controversy is that it was public and not private.\n\nFifty years after Samuel Beckett, author of Waiting for Godot, won the 1969 award, the behind-the-scenes papers have been released.\n\nAccording to these documents, committee members were hesitant to give Beckett the prize because of his “bottomless contempt for the human condition.”\n\nThe Guardian shares plenty of dramatic detail about how Beckett’s advocates ultimately won over the other judges, a year after he had been rejected for the prize.\n\nRelated posts"
