        "text": "Samuel Beckett (13 April 1906 – 22 December 1989) was an Irish novelist, dramatist, short story writer, theatre director, poet, and literary translator.\n\nLife and Career\n\nSamuel Beckett was born on April 13, 1906, in Dublin, Ireland, into a Protestant Anglo-Irish family. He was the second son of William Frank Beckett, a quantity surveyor, and May Barclay Beckett. He attended Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland.\n\nIn 1923, Beckett began his studies at Trinity College Dublin, where he pursued a bachelor’s degree in French and Italian. He continued his studies at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. He was introduced to the works of James Joyce during this period, and Joyce became a significant influence on Beckett’s writing.\n\nBeckett taught English in Paris for a brief period and eventually settled in the city, immersing himself in the literary and artistic circles. He began publishing essays and reviews and developed close friendships with prominent writers and artists.\n\nDuring World War II, Beckett joined the French Resistance in 1942, working as a courier and assisting in the hiding of weapons. His experiences during this time influenced his later works, particularly the themes of existentialism and despair.\n\nBeckett’s early works include novels like “Murphy” (1938) and “Watt” (written in the late 1940s but not published until 1953). However, he gained international fame with his play “Waiting for Godot,” written in French as “En attendant Godot” (1952). This play is a cornerstone of the Theatre of the Absurd, presenting a bleak and existential view of human existence.\n\nBeckett’s works often explore themes of existentialism, human suffering, and the absurdity of life. Some of his notable plays include “Endgame” (1957), “Krapp’s Last Tape” (1958), and “Happy Days” (1961). These plays are characterized by minimalist settings, repetitive dialogue, and a sense of despair.\n\nIn 1969, Beckett was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his “writing, which—in new forms for the novel and drama—in the destitution of modern man acquires its elevation.”\n\nBeckett continued to write and experiment with form throughout his career. His later works include the prose trilogy “Molloy” (1951), “Malone Dies” (1951), and “The Unnamable” (1953).\n\nSamuel Beckett passed away on December 22, 1989, in Paris, France.\n\nAward and Legacy\n\nSamuel Beckett was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his groundbreaking contributions to literature, particularly for his works that, in new forms for the novel and drama, explored the destitution of modern man and achieved literary elevation.\n\nBeckett’s influence on the Theatre of the Absurd is profound. His plays, especially “Waiting for Godot,” served as a catalyst for the movement. The Theatre of the Absurd, characterized by its exploration of existentialism and the absurdity of human existence, found its voice in Beckett’s works.\n\nBeckett’s innovative use of language and form has left an indelible mark on literature. His exploration of despair, existentialism, and the human condition continues to resonate with readers and scholars.\n\nBeckett’s works have been adapted into various forms of media, including film and radio. His influence extends beyond literature into the broader cultural landscape.\n\nAcademic interest in Beckett’s works has led to the establishment of Beckett studies, a field of literary criticism dedicated to the analysis and interpretation of his writings. His works are regularly studied in literature courses around the world.\n\nBeckett’s plays are regularly performed globally, attesting to their enduring relevance. “Waiting for Godot” remains one of the most frequently staged plays in the world."
