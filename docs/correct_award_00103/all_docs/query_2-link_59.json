        "text": "The Guthrie Theater (Joseph Haj, Artistic Director) today announced the cast and creative team for “On Beckett,” an Irish Repertory Theatre production produced by Octopus Theatricals.\n\nConceived and performed by Bill Irwin, “On Beckett” explores the work of Irish writer Samuel Beckett — one of the most influential theater voices of the past century — with a primer in clowning along the way. The show begins previews Saturday, February 17 on the McGuire Proscenium Stage and will play through Sunday, March 24. Single and group tickets are on sale now through the Box Office or online at guthrietheater.org. Accessibility services (ASL-interpreted, audio-described and open-captioned performances) are also available on select dates.\n\nTony Award-winning actor and master clown Bill Irwin has spent a lifetime captivated by Samuel Beckett. The depth of his devotion for the famed Irish writer plays out onstage in a nonstop display of jovial verbal and physical comedy that has become Irwin’s signature. With little more than a microphone and a podium, Irwin lets the audience in on the creative process of engaging with Beckett’s undeniably rich language, exploring passages from “Texts for Nothing,” “The Unnameable,” “Watt” and “Waiting for Godot.” Audiences will fall in love with Irwin’s unique and endearing approach to Beckett’s work.\n\n“On Beckett” premiered at Irish Repertory Theatre in New York City on October 3, 2018. The production was originally developed at American Conservatory Theater (A.C.T.) in San Francisco. David Roberts of Theatre Reviews, Limited called it “one of the most profound experiments to be conducted on an off-Broadway stage.” Charles McNulty of the Los Angeles Times commented, “A better guide to playing Beckett would be hard to find. And when it comes to the clowning elements, a masterclass is in session.” Howard Sherman of The Stage declared, “The show is never dry, never pedantic and never anything less than compelling.”\n\nThe one-person cast of “On Beckett” features Bill Irwin (Guthrie debut) as himself.\n\nThe creative team includes Bill Irwin (Creator/Performer), Charlie Corcoran (Scenic Designer), Martha Hally (Costume Consultant), Michael Gottlieb (Lighting Designer), M. Florian Staab (Sound Designer), Chris Luner (Tour Production Manager), Lisa McGinn (Stage Manager), Avery Reagan (Tour Lighting Supervisor), Alex Brock (Tour Audio Supervisor) and Mara Isaacs(Executive/Creative Producer) for Octopus Theatricals.\n\nSamuel Beckett (Author) was an Irish playwright, poet and novelist awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1969 for his penetrating and uncompromising exploration of the human condition. Born near Dublin, Ireland, he grew up as a gifted athlete, and he studied music and languages at Trinity College. He also traveled extensively abroad, and shortly before World War II, he made his permanent home in Paris. During the German occupation of France, he joined the underground anti-fascist resistance. A keen awareness of humankind’s predicament defines Beckett’s literature, but his outlook doesn’t yield a bleak negativism. Rather, he achieves a supreme convergence of the poetic, the tragic and the comic. Waiting for Godot (1952), Endgame (1957) and Happy Days (1960) are considered masterpieces of 20th-century theater.\n\nBill Irwin (Creator/Performer) is a Tony Award-winning actor, director, writer and clown. Original works include “The Regard of Flight;” “Largely New York” (Four Tony Nominations); “Fool Moon; Old Hats,” “The Happiness Lecture” and others. He has played in many Broadway, Off-Broadway and regional stage productions, including “On Beckett;” “The Iceman Cometh;” “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf” (Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play); “The Goat, or Who is Sylvia?;” “Waiting For Godot” (2009 for a Drama Desk Award nomination); “Endgame;” “The Tempest;” “Texts for Nothing;” “Garden of Earthly Delights;” “Accidental Death of An Anarchist;” “Showboat” and the Tony Award-winning Fool Moon, which he created with David Shiner and Nancy Harrington.\n\nOn television, Irwin appears as Mr. Noodle of “Elmo’s World” and Carey Loudermilk of “LEGION.” He created “The Regard of Flight” (PBS) with Doug Skinner, Michael O’Connor and Nancy Harrington. Film credits include “Rachel Getting Married,” “The Grinch Who Stole Christmas,” “Eight Men Out,” “Interstellar,” “Stepping Out,” “Unsilent Picture” and more.\n\nIrwin was an original member of Kraken, a theatre company directed by Herbert Blau, and was also an original member of the Pickle Family Circus of San Francisco with Larry Pisoni and Geoff Hoyle. Irwin is the grateful recipient of MacArthur, Guggenheim, Fulbright and National Endowment for the Arts Fellowships."
