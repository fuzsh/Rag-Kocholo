        "text": "Samuel Beckett: biography\n\nSamuel Beckett's BiographyBirth:13th April 1906Death:22nd December 1989Father:William Frank BeckettMother:Maria Jones RoeSpouse/Partners:Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnil (1961-1989)Cause of death: Emphysema (and possibly Parkinsons)Famous Works:\n\nEndgame\n\nMolloy\n\nWaiting for Godot\n\nNationality:IrishLiterary Period:Postmodernism\n\nSamuel Beckett was born on 13 April 1906 in the Foxrock suburb of Dublin, Ireland. His mother, Maria Jones Roe, worked as a nurse, and his father, William Frank Beckett, was in the construction business. Beckett suffered from severe depression during his childhood, which would later influence his writing.\n\nIn 1923, Samuel Beckett attended Trinity College Dublin, where he studied Romance languages (French, Italian and Spanish). After he graduated, he moved to Paris, where he worked as an English teacher. While in Paris, Beckett met the Irish writer James Joyce and joined his circle. In 1930, he returned to Ireland to work as a lecturer in French at Trinity College, but he resigned soon after that.\n\nBeckett travelled around for a few years, spending time in different countries in Europe until he settled in Paris in 1937. As a citizen of a neutral country, he was able to remain in Paris even during the city's German occupation. Beckett was part of the underground resistance group for a while before he eventually moved to the unoccupied part of France, where he remained until the end of the war. The years during World War II were some of the most fruitful years in Samuel Beckett's literary career in which he wrote essays, short stories, poems, and three novels.\n\nIn 1945, Samuel Beckett returned to Paris and was awarded for his work in the resistance. He wrote poetry, prose, and his most well-known play, Waiting for Godot. The play's first performance was a great success that made Samuel Beckett's name recognisable. He continued to write, but, despite his fame, he lived a very private life with his wife, Suzanne Deschevaux-Dumesnil. In 1969, when he received the Nobel Prize for Literature, Beckett accepted it but refused to travel to Stockholm to take it in person.\n\nSuzanne died in July 1989 and was soon followed by her husband. Samuel Beckett died from emphysema on 22 December 1989. It is thought that he might have had Parkinson's disease as well. He died in a nursing home in Paris and was buried next to Suzanne in the Montparnasse Cemetery.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Samuel Beckett wrote a number of poems, short stories, novels, and plays in both English and French.\n\nSamuel Beckett: plays\n\nSamuel Beckett's major works as a dramatist are the plays Waiting for Godot and Endgame (1957).\n\nWaiting for Godot (1953)\n\nWaiting for Godot is an absurdist black comedy in two acts. It was originally written in French and titled En attendant Godot. Beckett himself translated it into English. It premiered on 5 January 1953 at the Théâtre de Babylon in Paris.\n\nThe play follows the two main characters, Vladimir and Estragon, as they wait for someone called Godot; however, Godot never appears. Vladimir and Estragon are engaged in a constant conversation, revealing that they're not aware of why they exist on this Earth and hope that Godot has some answers for them. The action of waiting for Godot gives Vladimir and Estragon purpose in an existence that is full of more questions than answers.\n\nFor each one who begins to weep somewhere else another stops. The same is true of the laugh.\n\n(Pozzo in Act 1)\n\nEndgame (1957)\n\nEndgame is a one-act absurdist tragicomedy that was originally written in French and titled Fin de Partie. It was translated to English by the author. The play premiered on 3 April 1957 at the Royal Court Theater in London.\n\nEndgame follows a blind man, Hamm, and his servant, Clov, as they wait for something they call 'the end'. Like Waiting for Godot, Endgame is centred around waiting and discussing the meaning of existence.\n\nThe end is in the beginning and yet you go on.\n\n(Hamm in Act 1)\n\nNovels\n\nBeckett's most famous three novels, Molloy (1955), Malone Dies (1951) and The Unnamable (1953), are often referred to as 'the Trilogy'. Like most of his works, they were originally written in French. 'The Trilogy' doesn't follow a linear plot. Instead, the books deal with questions regarding human consciousness and the meaning of existence.\n\nBeckett's other novels include:\n\nMurphy (1938)\n\nMercier and Camier (1946)\n\nWatt (1953)\n\nPoems\n\nSamuel Beckett wrote a number of poems in both English and French. Beckett translated his French poems into English, just as he did with his plays and novels. During his lifetime, Beckett published six poetry collections; two more collections were published posthumously — the last one, The Collected Poems of Samuel Beckett, came out in 2012.\n\nIn Beckett's last poem 'What is the Word' (1988), which he wrote in the hospital not long before he died, Beckett explores his struggle to find the language to express what he felt in the last days of his life. This could be interpreted more generally as our collective human struggle to express ourselves through words.\n\nHave a read of 'What is the Word' below. How would you interpret the poem?\n\nfolly –\n\nfolly for to –\n\nfor to –\n\nwhat is the word –\n\nfolly from this –\n\nall this –\n\nfolly from all this –\n\ngiven –\n\nfolly given all this –\n\nseeing –\n\nfolly seeing all this –\n\nthis –\n\nwhat is the word –\n\nthis this –\n\nthis this here –\n\nall this this here –\n\nfolly given all this –\n\nseeing –\n\nfolly seeing all this this here –\n\nfor to –\n\nwhat is the word –\n\nsee –\n\nglimpse –\n\nseem to glimpse –\n\nneed to seem to glimpse –\n\nfolly for to need to seem to glimpse –\n\nwhat –\n\nwhat is the word –\n\nand where –\n\nfolly for to need to seem to glimpse what where –\n\nwhere –\n\nwhat is the word –\n\nthere –\n\nover there –\n\naway over there –\n\nafar –\n\nafar away over there –\n\nafaint –\n\nafaint afar away over there what –\n\nwhat –\n\nwhat is the word –\n\nseeing all this –\n\nall this this –\n\nall this this here –\n\nfolly for to see what –\n\nglimpse –\n\nseem to glimpse –\n\nneed to seem to glimpse –\n\nafaint afar away over there what –\n\nfolly for to need to seem to glimpse afaint afar away over there what –\n\nwhat –\n\nwhat is the word –\n\nwhat is the word\n\nWhat are the main themes in Samuel Beckett's works?\n\nSamuel Beckett instilled a fair amount of philosophy in his works: the meaning of existence, communication and language, and the passing of time are three main themes that Beckett explores in his writing.\n\nThe meaning of existence\n\nHave you ever felt like you're in the middle of an existential crisis? If so, you are not alone. Many people have, and this is why so many can relate to the questions Beckett raises.\n\nThe meaning of existence is one of the main themes in Beckett's works. The dramatist was an existentialist, and his fictional works are influenced by the ideas of French philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus.\n\nExistentialism is a philosophical movement that was prevalent in Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries. Existentialist philosophers and writers address and explore the meaning of existence, the human search for purpose, and the anxiety that existence has no meaning in an absurd world. Existentialism proposes the view that conscious reality is too complex to have a single specific meaning. Thus, the individual perceptions and choices are of value.\n\nIn his plays, Beckett explores human beings' desperate need for purpose. In Waiting for Godot, that purpose is the arrival of Godot and the overarching anxiety is that he is not coming, which, in turn, makes the characters feel stuck in a meaningless existence.\n\nCommunication and language\n\nThe language used in Beckett's plays is very repetitive. This is done, in parts, to show the miscommunication of the characters. They use long sentences, forget what they have said and heard, and repeat themselves.\n\nAs a result, they struggle to connect with each other. This is because neither Vladimir and Estragon in Waiting for Godot nor Hamm and Clov in Endgame talk to each other because they want to. They only have conversations with each other because they are stuck, and the exchange of language is the only thing that reminds them that they are alive.\n\nThe passing of time\n\nThe passing of time is a recurring theme in Beckett's works. It is a theme connected to existentialism that raises the question of what people do with the time they have and how they come to terms with the fact that their time is limited. Both in Waiting for Godot and in Endgame, time passes in a very tangible way and, while the time passes in both plays, the different stages of waiting are presented.\n\nIn Waiting for Godot, Vladimir and Estragon have hope that Godot will come eventually, and they find ways to pass the time so that it doesn't weigh on them.\n\nIn Endgame, on the other hand, the characters have waited for the 'end' for so long that they have become worn down by their despair at the realisation that time would always pass and nothing would ever change.\n\nWhy is Samuel Beckett important to English literature?\n\nSamuel Beckett is a key figure in the Theater of the Absurd, a post-World War II genre in drama influenced by existentialism.\n\nThe Theater of the Absurd (or Absurdist drama) is a genre of drama that was started by European playwrights in the 1950s. Plays in this genre are 'absurd' and seemingly illogical. The purpose of the plot is not the classic conflict and resolution but an expression of existentialism that asks questions about the meaning (or lack thereof) of human existence. Plays categorised within the Theater of the Absurd usually have a round narrative structure, meaning that they end in the same way they started.\n\nThe Theatre of the Absurd questions the meaning of existence and, especially in Beckett's dramas, puts an emphasis on the human failure to overcome absurdity. In all of his works, he depicts people who are trapped in absurd, meaningless patterns from which they fail to escape from.\n\nIt is understandable that questions of meaning and existence began to appear after such a devastating event as the Second World War. What makes Samuel Beckett's works and legacy important is that he took that idea, presented it, and proposed a unique view on it. To put it simply, Beckett wrote about the human condition, creating undefined characters in undefined places asking the questions that every person, no matter where they're from or what they do, asks.\n\nSamuel Beckett - Key takeaways\n\nSamuel Beckett was an Irish dramatist, poet, writer, theatre director and literary translator. He was an existentialist and one of the key figures in the Theater of the Absurd. Beckett was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1969\n\nSamuel Beckett was born on 13 April 1906 in Dublin, Ireland. He died from emphysema on 22 December 1989 in Paris, France.\n\nIn his works, Samuel Beckett explores the human condition and the absurdity of existence.\n\nSamuel Beckett's most famous plays are Waiting for Godot (1953) and Endgame (1957).\n\nThe main themes in Beckett's works are the meaning of existence, communication and language, and the passing of time."
