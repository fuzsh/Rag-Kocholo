Samuel Beckett (1906-1989) was an Irish avant-garde novelist, playwright, theatre director, and poet, who lived in France for most of his adult life. Writing in English and French, Beckett was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in 1969, “for his writing, which – in new forms for the novel and drama – in the destitution of modern man acquires its elevation.”

Beckett’s best-known play, En attendant Godot (Waiting for Godot) (1953), is a comic study of philosophical uncertainty; like much of his work, it focuses on the absurdity of human existence. Samuel Beckett is widely recognized as one of the most important European writers of the 20th-century. Beckett is praised for his influence on modern literature and his ability to impress, shock, and confound.
