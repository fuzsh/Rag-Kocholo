        "text": "The United States is comprised of fifty states and a national capital district, as well as a number of territories and possessions around the world. Because their names are commonly used and some of them are fairly long, they are often abbreviated in written documents and on mailing addresses.\n\nStateAbbreviations.us features a table of U.S. States, Districts, Territories, and Possessions, along with their standard and postal service abbreviations and their state capitals. Each State name contains a link to its official state government website. Each row of the State table also includes access to a state map. Each District, Territory, or Possession name contains a link to its official government or tourism website. To find state locations, view the state abbreviations map, which shows the lower 48 states plus Alaska and Hawaii, as well as their two-letter postal abbreviations. Click on the illustration at right for a simplified view of the 50 states and their postal abbreviations.\n\nUS State Abbreviations - State Capitals - State Links\n\nUS States, Capitals, and Government Links StateStandard\n\nAbbreviationPostal\n\nAbbr.Capital City Alabama Ala.ALMontgomery Alaska AlaskaAKJuneau Arizona Ariz.AZPhoenix Arkansas Ark.ARLittle Rock California Calif.CASacramento Colorado Colo.CODenver Connecticut Conn.CTHartford Delaware Del.DEDover Florida Fla.FLTallahassee Georgia Ga.GAAtlanta Hawaii HawaiiHIHonolulu Idaho IdahoIDBoise Illinois Ill.ILSpringfield Indiana Ind.INIndianapolis Iowa IowaIADes Moines Kansas Kans.KSTopeka Kentucky Ky.KYFrankfort Louisiana La.LABaton Rouge Maine MaineMEAugusta Maryland Md.MDAnnapolis Massachusetts Mass.MABoston Michigan Mich.MILansing Minnesota Minn.MNSt. Paul Mississippi Miss.MSJackson Missouri Mo.MOJefferson City Montana Mont.MTHelena Nebraska Nebr.NELincoln Nevada Nev.NVCarson City New Hampshire N.H.NHConcord New Jersey N.J.NJTrenton New Mexico N.M.NMSanta Fe New York N.Y.NYAlbany North Carolina N.C.NCRaleigh North Dakota N.D.NDBismarck Ohio OhioOHColumbus Oklahoma Okla.OKOklahoma City Oregon Ore.ORSalem Pennsylvania Pa.PAHarrisburg Rhode Island R.I.RIProvidence South Carolina S.C.SCColumbia South Dakota S.D.SDPierre Tennessee Tenn.TNNashville Texas Tex.TXAustin Utah UtahUTSalt Lake City Vermont Vt.VTMontpelier Virginia Va.VARichmond Washington Wash.WAOlympia West Virginia W.Va.WVCharleston Wisconsin Wis.WIMadison Wyoming Wyo.WYCheyenne\n\nUS District, Territory, and Possession Abbreviations and Capitals\n\nUS Districts, Territories, and Possessions SubdivisionStandard\n\nAbbreviationPostal\n\nAbbr.Capital City American Samoa n/aASPago Pago District of Columbia D.C.DCWashington Federated States of MicronesiaFSMFMPalikir Guam GuamGUHagatna Marshall Islands n/aMHMajuro Northern Mariana Islands n/aMPSaipan Palau PalauPWKoror Puerto Rico P.R.PRSan Juan Virgin Islands V.I.VICharlotte Amalie\n\nThe standard, or traditional, abbreviations, were widely used on mailing addresses and in other contexts before the two-letter postal abbreviations were introduced. Use the standard state abbreviations, with periods and spaces as shown, for all purposes other than postal addresses. The United States Post Office instituted two letter state abbreviations along with five digit zip codes in 1963. These postal abbreviations should only be used in mailing addresses. When abbreviating the name of a state in a mailing address, use uppercase letters, with no space between the letters.\n\nRelated US Regional and Travel sites\n\nOnline Atlas for United States travel and tourism information.\n\nState Capitals for maps and info about each U.S. state capital.\n\nState Maps for printable road maps of each state in the USA.\n\nCopyright 2003-2024 Zeducorp.\n\nAll rights reserved.\n\nAbout Us.
