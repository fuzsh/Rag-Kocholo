        "text": "Answer: The capital of Arizona is Phoenix.\n\nPhoenix, the capital of Arizona, is not only the state’s political center but also its largest city, embodying the dynamic growth and vibrant culture of the American Southwest. Founded in 1867 and incorporated as a city in 1881, Phoenix has evolved from a small agricultural community to a sprawling metropolis, known for its year-round sun, desert beauty, and outdoor activities. The city’s name reflects its vision of rising from the ruins of a former civilization, much like the mythical phoenix bird.\n\nSituated in the heart of the Sonoran Desert, Phoenix is surrounded by majestic mountains and is blessed with warm temperatures, making it a haven for outdoor enthusiasts. The city offers a diverse array of attractions, from the Desert Botanical Garden, showcasing the region’s native plant life, to the Phoenix Art Museum and the Heard Museum, which celebrate both contemporary art and the heritage of Native American cultures.\n\nPhoenix serves as a major economic hub in the Southwest, with industries ranging from technology and manufacturing to tourism. Its downtown area has seen significant revitalization, offering a mix of entertainment, dining, and shopping options. The city also hosts major sports teams and a variety of cultural and recreational events throughout the year. As the capital of Arizona, Phoenix stands as a testament to the state’s growth, diversity, and the resilience of its people."
