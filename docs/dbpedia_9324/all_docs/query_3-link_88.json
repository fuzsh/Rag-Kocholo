        "text": "Arizona is a state located in the southwestern region of the United States. The capital and largest city is Phoenix. Other big cities in Arizona include Tucson, Mesa, and Chandler. Arizona was the 48th state admitted to the union on February 14, 1912. Arizona borders New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, California and touches Colorado at one of its corners. It is also bordered by parts of Mexico. Residents are known as Arizonans.\n\nHumans have lived in Arizona for at least 20,000 years. Native American tribes that inhabited Arizona included the Hopi, Zuni, Navajo, and Apache.\n\nArizona became a state on February 14, 1912 and the 48th state admitted into the union. Marcos de Niza, a Spanish Franciscan, explored the area in 1539 and met its original native inhabitants. Spain founded towns at Tubac in 1752 and Tucson in 1775.\n\nWhen Mexico achieved its independence from Spain in 1821, what is now Arizona became part of the Mexican Territory Nueva California. During the Mexicanâ€“American War in 1847, the U.S. occupied Mexico City and forced the newly founded Mexican Republic to give up its northern territories, including what later became Arizona.\n\nArizona is located in the western United States as one of the Four Corners states. Of the state's 113,998 square miles (295,000 km2), approximately 15% is privately owned. The remaining area is public forest and park land, recreation areas and Native American reservations.\n\nArizona is best known for its desert landscape, which is rich in cactus plants. It is also known for its climate, which presents exceptionally hot summers and mild winters. Mountains and plateaus are found in more than half of the state.\n\nArizona is also home to the Grand Canyon which is considered to be one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World. The Grand Canyon is a colorful, steep-sided gorge, carved by the Colorado River, in northern Arizona. The Canyon was created by the Colorado River cutting a channel over millions of years, and is about 277 miles (446 km) long, ranges in width from 4 to 18 miles (6 to 29 kilometers) and has a depth of more than 1 mile (1.6 km).\n\nIn 2019, the United States Census Bureau estimated Arizona's population was 7,278,717. English is the most-spoken language (72.9%), followed by Spanish (20.8%), Navajo (1.5%), German and Chinese (including Mandarin (0.4%)), Tagalog, Vietnamese, Other North American indigenous languages (especially indigenous languages of Arizona), and French (0.3%), and finally, Arabic, Apache, and Korean (0.2%).\n\nIn 2010, 73.0% of people in Arizona were White/Caucasian, 4.6% were Native American, 4.1% were black, 2.8% were Asian, and 0.2% were Native Hawaiian and other Pacific islander.\n\nCesar Chavez - Civil rights leader\n\nDavid Henrie - Actor on the television series Wizards of Waverly Palace\n\nDanica Patrick - NASCAR driver\n\nLinda Ronstadt - Pop singer\n\nBarry Goldwater - Former senator and presidential nominee"
