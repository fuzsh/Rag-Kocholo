        "text": "Arizona State Flag\n\nThe state flag consists of alternating red and yellow rays that represent the 13 original colonies and the western setting sun. The red and yellow are based on the colors of the Spanish flag that Coronado carried into the region. The bottom half of the flag is the same color blue found in the U. S. flag. The copper star identifies Arizona as the largest copper producing state in the union.\n\nArizona State Seal\n\nArizona's main enterprises and attractions are represented in the seal. In the background of the seal is a range of mountains with the sun rising behind the peaks. At the right side of the mountains is a water storage reservoir and a dam, with irrigated fields and orchards. There are cattle grazing on the right, a quartz mill and a miner with a pick and shovel on the left. Above the drawing is the Arizona state motto, Ditat Deus, (Latin for \"God Enriches\").\n\nArizona March Song\n\nArizona has two state songs, the \"Arizona March Song\" was written in 1915 by Margaret Rowe Clifford with music by Maurice Blumenthal. Rex Allen, Jr. wrote a song titled \"Arizona.\" It was adopted in 1982 as an alternate state song.\n\nState Flower\n\nBlossom of the Saguaro Cactus. The pure white waxy blossom of the giant saguaro cactus was designated the state flower of Arizona in 1931. It blooms on the tips of the saguaro cactus during the May and June months.\n\nState Gemstone\n\nTurquoise was designated the official gemstone of Arizona in 1974. It's a blue-green, waxy-surfaced stone used for centuries in Southwest Indian Jewelry. It can be found throughout the Southwest and is composed of hydrous oxide of aluminum and copper.\n\nState Neckwear\n\nThe bola tie was designated the official neckware of Arizona in 1973. A bola (sometimes referred to as a bolo tie) is a type of necktie consisting of a piece of cord or braided leather with decorative metal tips secured with an ornamental clasp or slide. It's usually made by silversmiths and leather makers in almost every size and shape, most often with silver and turquoise.\n\nState Tree\n\nThe Palo Verde was designated the official state tree of Arizona in 1954. \"Palo Verde\" is Spanish for \"green stick.\" They bloom in the spring (late march to early May) with brilliant yellow-gold flowers.\n\nState Bird\n\nThe cactus wren measures 7 to 8 inches in length, and its back is brown with white spots, and its throat is lighter colored with black spots. Its bill is curved down and there's a white line over each eye. Cactus wrens eat insects, seeds, and fruit. They often build their nests inside a cactus to protect them from predators.\n\nState Mammal\n\nThe ringtail was designated the state mammal of Arizona in 1986. Ringtails are cat-sized carnivores resembling a small fox with a long raccoon-like tail. The tail is about the length of the head and body with 14-16 black and white bands and a black tip.\n\nState Reptile\n\nThe Arizona ridge-nosed rattlesnake was recognized as the official state reptile of Arizona in 1986. First known to science in 1905, this small brown snake is one of the most primitive rattlesnakes found in this country.\n\nState Fish\n\nThe Apache trout was designated the state fish of Arizona in 1986. It is found nowhere else in the world besides the coldwater streams in the White Mountains of Arizona.\n\nState Butterfly\n\nThe newest of state symbols, the two-tailed swallowtail became the state butterfly in 2001. This butterfly has yellow and black wings with a wing span between three and a half up to five inches in length."
