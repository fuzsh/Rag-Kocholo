        "text": "Located in downtown Phoenix, the Arizona State Capitol draws on several architectural styles, including federal and classical elements. Its symmetry, windows, roofline, and center entrance call forth architecture from the so-called Federal era of the 1780s through the 1930s. The dome and column reflect classical stylings of ancient Greece and Rome. The materials for the building are largely indigenous to the region, including locally-sourced copper and granite.\n\nCompleted in 1901, the State Capitol served as the center for territorial government before statehood. In 1912, the building then became the main hub of state government for many years until the State Legislature moved to an adjacent building in 1960 and the Governor's Office relocated in 1974. In 1978, the Capitol was opened as a museum with the inauguration of Governor Bruce Babbitt.\n\nLack of funding shaped the development of the Capitol building. The original plans called for making the it a replica of the US Capitol building in Washington DC. The territory planned for an elaborate dome and a larger footprint. The cost of constructing an extensive dome exceed the budget of the territory, so the territorial government commissioned a smaller copper dome instead. The plans changed several times before the building was finally completed.\n\nCuriously, the Arizona State Capitol is the only state capitol that lacks a cornerstone. Cornerstones are usually the first stone set in construction of a building's foundation. The cornerstone is typically a symbolic masonry stone that stands out from the rest of the building. This ceremonial stone is largely a Judeo-Christian tradition that traces its roots back to the Old Testament."
