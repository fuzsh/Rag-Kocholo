Budget-controlled funds are set by a state set formula or legislative appropriations and the amount that a school district may spend is dependent on that formula. The school district is legally permitted to budget or spend up to the budget limit. Budget-controlled funds include, Maintenance and Operations (M&O), District Additional Assistance (DAA or Unrestricted Capital), Bond, Overrides for both M&O and DAA, Classroom Site Fund and Adjacent Ways. The legislature establishes a formula for the budget which is the amount the district may spend for expenditures in those funds. To receive the cash to fund these accounts, the district must levy the local taxpayers. The County Treasurer (district bank) requires the district to have available cash in the bank to process warrants (checks).\n\nRebuttals to Recent Claims\n\nClaim: SUSD blames declining enrollment on birth rates, instead of dissatisfaction.\n\nEnrollment Data: Enrollment information was obtained for entry and exit dates. Withdrawal codes were examined. Students who graduated, obtained a GED, were incarcerated, moved out the state or country, or passed away were not included. Students who left to be homeschooled, dropped out, were dropped for excessive unexcused absences, left the district, or left without a record of what new school they were going to were retained for analysis. Note that students moving within the state of Arizona but out of SUSD boundaries are included in this total and could not be filtered out. Therefore, this chart is the upper range of students who have left as a result of parental dissatisfaction. The percentage of enrolled students who left for a reason that could possibly be connected to parental dissatisfaction was calculated for school years 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024.\n\nFact: The percentage of students leaving SUSD due to parental dissatisfaction has decreased over the past 3 school years.\n\nStay in the know!
