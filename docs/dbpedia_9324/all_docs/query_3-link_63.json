It is blossoming with new residential, retail, light industry, places to stay and play to play.\n\nBagdad\n\nBagdad lies on Bridle Creek in west-central Yavapai County, one of the four original counties.

Jones then laid out the remaining 80 acres as the Jones addition to the town site. Jones built numerous buildings. They took up residence in the town in 1927. Mr. And Mrs. Jones kept an abiding interest in the cultural and moral development. They donated land for religious, education, and fraternal institutions.

The post office for Agua Fria was discontinued in 1895. According to post office rules, an office couldn’t reopen under its old name. Therefore, when the post office was re-established in 1898, the name Dewey was selected. There is some question as to whether it was named for Rear Admiral Dewey or for a pioneer settler in the vacinity. It is to be noted also that the name of the railroad station was and still is Cherry Creek, but this name was in use elsewhere as a post office, and so couldn’t be used.\n\nDolan Springs\n\nDolan Springs is a quiet western town that is a hub to many attractions in Arizona and southern Nevada.
