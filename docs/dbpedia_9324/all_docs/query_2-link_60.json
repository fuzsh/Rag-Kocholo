Reception girls were friendly and welcoming. We had dinner and breakfast in the Dubliner, both very good and good value for central DC. We would usually make a point of NOT eating in Irish Bars on holiday. Special shout out to Patrick, thanks for looking after us so well. Would 100% recommend the Pheonix Park Hotel.\n\nReviewed by Nins64 on via TripAdvisor\n\nBeautiful Hotel\n\nRating: 5 out of 5 stars\n\nBeautiful historical Hotel! Delicate and clean rooms with comfortable beds and a nice bathroom. Complimentary hot drinks in the lounge on the 2nd floor is a big plus. The location is perfect within a short walking distance from Union Station. Short distance to all historical attractions, buildings and museums. The Dubliner offers good food and good atmosphere to a good price for all meals. Very nice!\n\nReviewed by Hege on Hotels.com on via Hotels.com\n\nGreat location: friendly, helpful staff.\n\nRating: 5 out of 5 stars\n\nGreat location, albeit a bit traffic noisy on weekday mornings. Short walk to Union Station. Very friendly reception team who handled an a/c problem in my room speedily and efficiently. Fun Irish bar & restaurant too.\n\nReviewed by Marc on Hotels.com on via Hotels.com\n\nVery Surprised\n\nRating: 5 out of 5 stars\n\nWas very surprised. Just had a NOT so pleasant experience at a Hilton a couple weeks before, so I was very uneasy about what this experience would be like. Kind staff that's greets you and gives you the pertinent information without you having to ask. Restaurant on first floor. No room service. But that was ok for me. Hallways were clean. Elevator small but there were 2 and they seemed safe and clean. The Room was on the smaller side, but small and comfortable. Good for two people. Very clean room and bathroom. This one actually felt like a 4star hotel. Only like 5min walk from union station. No complaints. I will definitely stay again. Only thing I will say just to nit pick. And this goes for all hotels. Get smart tvs. This makes the guest entertainment very easy and simple because of the different streaming apps.\n\nReviewed by Karriem on Expedia on via Expedia\n\nGreat Place to Stay\n\nRating: 5 out of 5 stars\n\nIt was a great stay! The staff were all friendly and very helpful. Every request was met with a smile and a solution. The location is so convenient for all modes of transportation for all parts of the city and Surrounding areas.\n\nReviewed by Thomas on Hotels.com on via Hotels.com\n\ngreat central location, very clean rooms\n\nRating: 5 out of 5 stars\n\nvery convenient location by the train station, within walking distance to the capitol. a pub downstairs for some drinks and food. clean and quiet rooms.\n\nReviewed by Tomasz, pl on via Booking.com\n\nVery good location in Washington\n\nRating: 5 out of 5 stars\n\n- The quality and kindness of the staff - tea, coffee, chocolate available on the 1st floor -- the cleanliness and quality of the room - the restaurant on the ground floor is very good value (although the service is not exceptional) - the immediate proximity of transport\n\nReviewed by sandrine, fr on via Booking.com"
