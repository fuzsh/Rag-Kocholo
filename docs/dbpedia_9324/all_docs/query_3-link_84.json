        "text": "The billionaire purchased 24,000 acres outside of Buckeye in Arizona and an additional 2,800 acres in Buckeye.\n\nBy Kelsi Maree Borland | March 05, 2020 at 04:00 AM\n\nA few years ago, Bill Gates has announced plans to build a smart city outside of Buckeye in Arizona. Through his subsidiary Mt. Lemmon Holdings, the billionaire spent $80 million to purchase more than 24,000 acres of land with plans to build a smart city, which will include housing, schools, offices and retail. Since the purchase, there has been limited information on the development of the project.\n\n\"In November 2017 the media reported that a company associated with Bill Gates purchased 24,800 acres in the Southern Valley between Buckeye and Tonopah for $80 million,\" James DeCremer, principal at Avison Young in Phoenix, tells GlobeSt.com. \"Gates' company plans to create a \"smart city\" called Belmont on the site, which will be similar in size to Tempe, Arizona. According to the Arizona real estate investment company involved in the deal, Belmont Partners it will be 'a forward-thinking community with a communication and infrastructure spine that embraces cutting-edge technology, designed around high-speed digital networks, data centers, new manufacturing technologies and distribution models, autonomous vehicles and autonomous logistics hubs.'\"\n\nIn addition, the company has also acquired additional acreage in Buckeye. \"In October, Gates was also a recent investor in more than 2,800 acres of land in Buckeye,\" says DeCremer. This could be an addition to the firm's current plans in the market.\n\nContinue Reading for Free\n\nRegister and gain access to:\n\nBreaking commercial real estate news and analysis, on-site and via our newsletters and custom alerts\n\nEducational webcasts, white papers, and ebooks from industry thought leaders\n\nCritical coverage of the property casualty insurance and financial advisory markets on our other ALM sites, PropertyCasualty360 and ThinkAdvisor\n\nAlready have an account?
