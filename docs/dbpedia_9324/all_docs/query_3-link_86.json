        "text": "USA / Arizona / Phoenix /\n\nWorld / USA / Arizona / Phoenix World / United States / Arizona\n\ncity, capital city of state/province/region, county seat\n\nCity with an estimated population of 1,567,924 in 2008; largest city in Arizona and largest state capital in the United States. State capital and county seat of Maricopa County. Occupied by the Hohokam for nearly a thousand years before European exploration but abandoned between 1300 and 1450 due to dessication of the area. Some native settlement remained thereafter. Explored by the Spanish in the 1600s and 1700s; passed to Mexican control in 1821 and American possession in 1848. First settled by Jack Swilling in 1867, who built irrigation channels over the ancient native irrigation system. A settlement grew here that was originally known as Pumpkinville after the pumpkins that grew on the sides of the canals. After several name changes, the town was finally named Phoenix, after the mythical creature that is born from ashes, as the town was built on the ruins of a previous native settlement.\n\nThe city grew and was incorporated by the territorial legislature in 1881. The territorial capital was moved here in 1889 due to its central location. It remained capital when the territory became a state in 1912. The city grew as a tourist destination and retirement location in the mid-20th century.\n\nwww.phoenix.gov\n\nNearby cities:"
