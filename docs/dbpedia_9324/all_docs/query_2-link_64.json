        "text": "Key challenges and barriers to revitalization\n\nSouth Phoenix is sandwiched between the city’s central business district to the north and an enclave of economically better-off neighborhoods abutting the sprawling South Mountain Preserve nature area to the south. Despite this advantageous location, adequate transportation options and significant commercial or housing development are lacking. A recent federally-funded study of transportation conditions in the community cited numerous challenges that have historically held back the region, including “land use industrialization, poor housing conditions, lack of infrastructure investments, and lack of access to health resources and opportunities.”[8]\n\nHousing is rapidly becoming more expensive\n\nPhoenix’s relative affordability, particularly in its housing market, has helped lure a steady influx of new residents to the region over the past several decades. But, as in many American cities, an affordability crisis is becoming a major concern, potentially threatening one of the city’s primary economic advantages. Even with its steady population growth, Phoenix was able to position itself as a hub of affordability where home ownership was within reach for many Americans. Twenty years ago, the median household income for Phoenix’s persistent-poverty communities was $40,600, and the median home value was $104,100 (inflation-adjusted to 2019 dollars), which made home ownership attainable for many low-income residents. In 2019, median household income stood at only $36,800 while home values had increased to $140,500. The last five years have seen steep increases in housing costs across the city’s footprint: according to the Zillow Home Value Index, the value of a home citywide reached $433,700 in mid-2022, about double what it was five years earlier. While the steepest uptick is likely driven by the pandemic housing market, continued rapid population growth seems to suggest that this problem will continue to grow as a concern for the city’s residents, its most low-income in particular.\n\nHome ownership rates are lower in South Phoenix compared to the rest of the metro area, however, and most residents are renters. The growing affordability crisis across housing types has been decades in the making, with one study finding that over the past 30 years Phoenix has produced just 220,000 new housing units despite seeing its population grow by 820,000.[9] In metro Phoenix, which is among the top 10 metro areas facing the most severe affordable housing shortages, only 20 rentals are available for every 100 extremely low-income renters.[10] Since 2019, the average rent in the Phoenix metro area has increased by a substantial 28 percent—the fifth highest rate nationwide—and is a significant burden for the residents of South Phoenix.[11] Conversations with representatives of local development organizations in mid-2022 brought to light a broad need for more affordable housing, but its delivery has been slow in a state where the ability of cities to require low-income housing in developments is restricted. While housing development has boomed in many parts of the metro area, approved projects tend to cater to the higher end of the market."
