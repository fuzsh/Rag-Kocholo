        "text": "If you ask us, Phoenix, Arizona, is one of the most wonderful places to live or travel! There’s so much to see and do, not to mention the beautiful scenery and culture it consists of. There also happens to be a lot to know about this wonderful place, so we’re breaking down the history of Phoenix, Arizona for you today.\n\nIf you’re visiting Phoenix or surrounding towns, book a ride with All Valley Transportation so we can help you explore and make the most of your time here.\n\nIt’s hard to believe Phoenix was anything different than the beautiful city it is today, but it wasn’t always this way. It also has an early Native American history that’s incredibly interesting, so let’s start there.\n\nIn the beginning\n\nThe first settlers in the Phoenix, Arizona territory are known as The Hohokam tribe. They made the Phoenix area their home for over 2000 years and were able to make the Salt River Valley inhabitable. They did this by creating an irrigation system that reached over 135 miles. Some of the canals they created are still in use today!\n\nThe Hohokam tribe ended up vanishing in 1450 A.D. for unknown reasons. However, it can be assumed it was because of an extended drought when they needed to move on.\n\nAfter the Hohokam tribe left the area, the Akimel O’odham, Tohono O’odham, and Maricopa tribes began to take over the area. They lived in smaller villages and grew their food to survive.\n\nFounding years\n\nAfter the early settlement, The United States took over the Phoenix area in 1848. Phoenix itself was later founded in 1867 by John W. Swilling. Swilling saw the dry soil in the area and realized the land could be farmed. It was relatively free of rocks and was far from snowy and heavy frost areas. All that was needed was water to make it happen.\n\nHe ended up establishing what is known as the Swilling Irrigation Canal Company. Swilling then moved to the Salt River Valley to begin digging a canal. It wasn’t long after, in March 1868, that water started to flow through the canal. This allowed them to create crops that summer and start a whole new life in the magical place of Phoenix.\n\nThe name\n\nYou might be wondering why Phoenix was named Phoenix in the first place!\n\nDarell Duppa is one of the settlers who was a part of Swilling’s mission and is responsible for the name. He devised it based on the idea of a mythical phoenix rising from the ashes. He predicted the city of Phoenix would emerge from its previous civilization’s ruins and grow into something magnificent.\n\nYou can also learn about the city government and Phoenix city council here.\n\nGrowth\n\nFebruary 14, 1912, was an exciting day for Phoenix. Arizona officially became a state today, and Phoenix was also named its capital. As the city continued to grow, so did the technological advances that helped to move the city forward.\n\nCurious about the biggest stadiums in Phoenix?

This dam was essential for providing the water and electricity that helped power the city. At the time, it was the biggest dam in the world.\n\nAs technology grew, so did the population in Phoenix. By 1920 its population consisted of 30,000 people. 1920 also marked the year the Heard Building went up, seven stories tall, and a major addition to the city.\n\n(Curious what Phoenix looked like in the 1930’s? Local channel 12 news shares some neat photos here.)\n\nMuch of the economy’s success at the time was due to the Theodore Roosevelt Dam, which helped produce things like citrus, cattle, and cotton.\n\nIf you’re planning a visit to the Grand Canyon, this article covers your transportation options.\n\nPost-World War II\n\nPhoenix took on even more changes at the end of World War II as the population only continued to grow. Many of the veterans at Phoenix military bases returned there with their families. They realized its potential and what a great place it was to be.\n\nTechnological advances continued to influence the economy as Phoenix became an industrial city. This was also the time things like air conditioners began to take effect. Citizens quickly found an affordable way to cool residential homes and make for an even better living experience. It was also necessary, as temperatures in Phoenix skyrocket in the summertime.\n\n1973 was also a noteworthy year as the Central Arizona Project began construction. This project brought a stable water supply to Phoenix, making the city a better place to live.\n\nHere are some fun things to do in downtown Phoenix.\n\nPhoenix today\n\nIf you ask us, Phoenix is now a city that’s nothing short of fantastic and it deserves its stellar reputation.\n\nToday, the population of Phoenix is over 4.7 million people and is the United States’ fifth largest city spanning over 520 square miles.
