        "text": "Cities in Arizona - Quick Facts, History & Geography\n\nArizona Fun Quick Facts\n\nHere are some Arizona quick facts that provide some insight into this great state. Arizona was accepted to the Union on February 14, 1912 and was the last contiguous state to be admitted. In total, there are 91 cities and towns in Arizona. Phoenix is both the capital of Arizona and the largest city in Arizona with a population of 1,658,422. It is also the largest city in Arizona by land mass and also has the largest impact as far as economic growth is concerned. Behind Phoenix, the largest cities in Arizona are Tucson, Mesa, Chandler, Gilbert and Scottsdale. The state nickname of Arizona is \"The Copper State\". The Sonoran Desert is the hottest desert and Phoenix is the hottest city in the United States. Arizona is the 6th largest state by land area and the 14th largest state by population with more than 7.3 million residents. Famous people from Arizona include Joe Jonas, Emma Stone and Hailey Bieber\n\nThe Well-Documented History of Arizona\n\nLong before any European explorers discovered Arizona, it was home to ancient civilizations like the Apache and the Navajo tribes. In fact, many ruins, rock art and other artifacts are still visible today. Arizona would eventually fall under Mexican rule, but in 1848 Arizona was ceded to the United States. Fast forward to the 19th century where prospectors and cowboys quickly discovered that Arizona offered a bounty of treasure. This led to the famous mining boom where towns Wild West towns like Bisbee, Tombstone and Hackberry became famous. A version of these ghost towns still exist today and have become popular tourist destinations.\n\nThe Breathtaking Geography of Arizona\n\nNot many other states can replicate the stunning geography of Arizona and it all starts with the Grand Canyon. By far the largest canyon in the United States, the Grand Canyon is 277 miles long, 18 miles wide and 6,093 feet deep. Arizona is also home to multiple mountains that offer incredible landscapes and leisure activities. Of course, a large portion of the cities in Arizona are covered in desert. The Sonoran Desert and the Mojave Desert are the most prominent and in total cover almost one half of the entire state. The states that border Arizona include California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico. The total size (land area) of Arizona is 113,594, which makes it the 6th largest state in the U.S.\n\nThinking About Relocating to Arizona?\n\nArizona is a land of opportunity, with many people relocating to various distinct cities in Arizona. With that in mind, it might be fair to refer to Arizona as retirement central, though it is much more than just a retirement community. If you look at a map of Arizona cities, you'll see the major cities of Phoenix, Tempe, Tucson and Flagstaff. These Arizona cities are growing at a faster rate than most cities across the country. There are major hotels and lots of excellent restaurants in these major cities, with Phoenix quite obviously offering the best of these, since it is one of America's largest cities now. Phoenix also has four major sports teams for entertainment, while it also features a host of different apartment and home options.\n\nOne thing that you will constantly hear about Arizona cities is that they have great weather. Though many are concerned about the heat during the year, they must recognize that it is a desert heat or more aptly, a \"dry\" heat. It's not the type of heat that comes with unbearable humidity, so it is something that most people should be equipped to handle. The job markets out west have not struggled quite as much as the ones on the east coast, and the school systems are typically considered quite strong in the big cities. As far as public transportation is concerned in Arizona, Phoenix has initiated a light rail to service its residents.\n\nAnyone seriously considering moving to Arizona, should be aware of the higher than average crime rates across the state. On average, Arizona has a crime rate that is about 20% higher than the national average. The map of Arizona cities can help you find the city you're looking for, while the crime map can help you determine if the city is a safe place to live. On a more positive note, the cost of living in most Arizona cities is below the national average as housing and other key expenditures are fairly affordable."
