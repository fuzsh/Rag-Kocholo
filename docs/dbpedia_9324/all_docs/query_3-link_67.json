        "text": "The United States acquired most of the area of Arizona from Mexico in 1848. The United States acquired additional area, comprising the southern part of Arizona, from Mexico in 1853 as part of the Gadsden Purchase. Arizona Territory was organized from the western part of New Mexico Territory on February 24, 1863. Part of Arizona Territory north and west of the Colorado River was added to the state of Nevada in 1866, resulting in generally the same boundary as the present state of Arizona.\n\nAlthough the territory had not yet been legally established, census data are available for Arizona beginning with the 1860 census. For an explanation of the revision to the 1860 population of Arizona, see Richard L. Forstall, Population of States and Counties of the United States: 1790-1990, Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1996, page 14.\n\nData for the legally established state of Arizona are available beginning with the 1920 census.\n\nAMERICAN INDIAN AREAS\n\nArizona has 21 federally recognized American Indian reservations; 4 with associated off-reservation trust lands in the state.\n\nMETROPOLITAN AND MICROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS AND RELATED STATISTICAL AREAS\n\nArizona has six metropolitan statistical areas and five micropolitan statistical areas.\n\nCOUNTIES\n\nThere are 15 counties in Arizona. Each county is governed by a board of supervisors.\n\nCOUNTY SUBDIVISIONS\n\nThere are 80 county subdivisions in Arizona. They are all census county divisions (CCDs), which are delineated for statistical purposes, have no legal function, and are not governmental units. CCDs were first established in Arizona for the 1960 census. Prior to 1960, the minor civil divisions used in the census include supervisorial districts, election precincts, justice precincts, school districts, land-survey townships, and Indian reservations.\n\nPLACES\n\nArizona has 451 places; 90 incorporated places and 361 census designated places (CDPs). The incorporated places consist of 45 cities and 45 towns. The minimum population threshold required for incorporation is 1,500.\n\nCENSUS TRACTS/BLOCK GROUPS/BLOCKS\n\nArizona has 1,526 tracts, 4,178 block groups, and 241,666 blocks.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS\n\nFor the 111th Congress (January 2009-January 2011), Arizona had eight congressional districts. For the 113th Congress (January 2013-January 2015), Arizona has nine congressional districts as a result of reapportionment based on the 2010 Census.\n\nSCHOOL DISTRICTS\n\nArizona has 104 elementary school districts, 15 secondary school districts, and 99 unified school districts.\n\nSTATE LEGISLATIVE DISTRICTS\n\nThere are 30 state senate districts and 30 state house districts in Arizona.\n\nURBAN AREAS\n\nArizona has 69 urban areas; 9 urbanized areas and 60 urban clusters.\n\nZIP CODE TABULATION AREAS\n\nThere are 408 ZIP Code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) in Arizona.\n\nYear North Latitude West Longitude 20106 33° 22′ 06″ 111° 51′ 52″ 20006 33° 22′ 25″ 111° 49′ 43″ 19905 33° 21′ 08″ 111° 46′ 13″ 19804 33° 19′ 29″ 111° 43′ 06″ 19703 33° 17′ 09″ 111° 41′ 15″ 19603 33° 15′ 41″ 111° 30′ 19″ 19503 33° 22′ 11″ 111° 31′ 55″ 19402 33° 20′ 24″ 111° 49′ 26″ 19302 33° 18′ 40″ 111° 44′ 02″ 19201 33° 21′ 03″ 111° 12′ 55″ 19101 33° 24′ 18″ 110° 59′ 38″ 19001 33° 34′ 20″ 111° 15′ 58″ 18901 33° 15′ 51″ 111° 25′ 39″ 18801 33° 17′ 36″ 111° 25′ 32″\n\n1 Source: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Fourteenth Census of the United States, 1923\n\n2 Source: U.S. Census Bureau, recomputation for historical county level data which relied upon aggregate county level population data with an estimated county centroid resulting in a possible error of up to one mile.\n\n3 Source: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Centers of Population for States and Counties, 1974\n\n4 Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Geography Division, recomputation from archived national block group/enumeration area data resulting in a possible error of up to 1,000 feet.\n\n5 Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Geography Division, recomputation from archived national block group data resulting in a possible error of up to 1,000 feet.\n\n6 Source: U.S. Census Bureau, computation from national block-level data"
