The Arizona State Capitol, located in Phoenix, Arizona, has a rich history as it once housed the territory and state legislature, along with various executive offices. Today, these offices have been relocated to surrounding buildings, and the building itself has been transformed into the Arizona Capitol Museum. This transition allows visitors to delve into the history of Arizona in a unique and immersive way.

Exhibits at the Arizona Capitol Museum

The Arizona Capitol Museum offers a comprehensive look into the history and culture of Arizona. Exhibits range from the early days of the state to the present, covering a variety of topics. These include Arizona's state symbols, historical figures, natural history, the role of the state, and the history of Arizona's appointment to statehood. The museum also features the USS Arizona and photographs by Edward S. Curtis, providing a diverse and enriching experience for visitors.

Architecture of the Arizona State Capitol

The Arizona State Capitol building is a testament to Arizona's natural resources and climate. Constructed largely from native materials like granite and featuring a copper dome, the building is a symbol of the state's rich natural resources. The design of the building is optimized for Arizona's desert climate, with thick masonry walls that insulate the interior, skylights, and round clerestory windows that keep the heat away from the chambers' plenary halls. This unique architectural design adds to the overall experience of visiting the museum.
