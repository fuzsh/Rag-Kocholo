Inspector Di Salvo is assigned to the case and focuses his investigations on St. Theresa's, the exclusive school where Angelo boarded. Three of the murdered girl's classmates, Franca, Paola and Virgina (who call themselves \"The Inseparables\"), receive threatening poems from an individual using the name \"Nemesis\". Bizarre \"accidents\" start to befall the girls: Franca is injured when someone causes her horse to bolt and Virgina nearly breaks her neck on marbles left at the top of a staircase. But Di Salvo is determined to find the killer, even if it means using unorthodox methods. He is aided by Angelo Russo's little sister Emily, whose helpful clues lead to a boutique owned by a dubious character and a vice ring where \"rich influential men pay well for teenage favours\" ...",

        "text": "Spooktober IV: Morte all'italiana\n\nThe movie in which Fabio Testi makes a suspect confess by riding a rollercoaster.\n\nThe last entry in Dallamano’s (which sadly he couldn’t direct as he passed away) loosely linked series of films dealing with schoolgirls and teenagers in peril—earlier on in the marathon, I already reviewed the second installment, What Have They Done To Your Daughters?.\n\nAnd just like that movie, there’s a pretty good blend of gialli with poliziotteschi, with this one leaning more into the latter. Some have complained that Fabio Testi looked bored, but I liked his weary personality; it makes the few moments he gets violent even more effective. The mystery is intriguing, yet I agree with some of the critics…\n\nThis is considered to be the third part of Massimo Dallamano's \"Schoolgirls in Peril\" series, despite that the director only has a co-writers credit here. It begins with a dead body, apparently killed with a massive dido, and then proceeds to the central location - an all girls boarding school. You'd be forgiven for thinking this is going to be another ultra sleazy late Giallo effort along the same lines as Play Motel etc; but it isn't. It's actually rather tame. There's no gory murders and only a handful of sleazy elements. That's not to say it's all bad! The mystery is actually quite absorbing and well put together. The plot does get a bit choppy but the film keeps…\n\nI had no idea until after watching this, that this was intended for Massimo Dallamano to direct, which would've seen him complete a trio of hard hitting hybrids of giallo and poliziotteschi dubbed the \"Schoolgirls in Peril\" trilogy, including What Have You Done to Solange? and What Have They Done to Your Daughters? All sharing themes involving young girls, vice and murder. He died before he got the chance unfortunately.\n\nI've only seen the other two once a long time ago so it looks like I'll be working my way backwards through these, but having watched this it does feel very much in line with what I remember of the other two.\n\nWhen a murdered schoolgirl is pulled out from…\n\nGiallo January 2024\n\nFive stars for Fabio Testi's beige cardigan sweater. I'm totally obsessed with it and would totally wear it with a beige turtleneck. I would not look anywhere as good as Testi does, but it is my aesthetic.\n\nFour stars for the film itself. I may be overrating it a bit, but my investment in this story was pretty high, even if it feels like an unfinished piece. Testi plays the police chief (we are in poliziotteschi mode here) investigating the murder of a school girl who seems to have been involved in some sort of sex ring (I had to work in ring somehow because the film does not, much less the full title--Red Rings of Fear).…\n\nA surprisingly good \"school girls in trouble\" style gialli that is very similar to What Have You Done to Solange? and What Have They Done to Your Daughters?, so much so that 10 minutes in I thought I'd seen it already and made a mistake. Those two films are pretty well known gialli and one even stars this movie's Detective, and cardigan lover, Fabio Testi, but now having seen all three I think this is the best of the bunch. The plot is tighter and more to the point and the Ortolani score is a good mix of jazzy bombast and moody suspense. The cinematography is well done with some surprising inventiveness, such as in a tense \"teachers going to…\n\n“Hey! Don’t look at the ass, look at the cat!”\n\nWhen you see six writers attributed to a piece you’re about to watch, you gotta be ready for the worst. Fortunately it wasn’t as bad as it should have been, but you still end up with a Goofy Giallo.\n\nGirls and faculty from a boarding school are being targeted and killed.\n\nFabio Testi plays the detective, perpetually angry and somewhat befuddled in his Starsky sweater. Playing it tough, he’s more of a psycho terrorizing the potential suspects. Check out the shakedown scene on the roller coaster! Or when he storms the dorms, wakes everyone up screaming “Who killed Angela Russo?!” Like that’s going to get results. Fortunately Angela’s little sister is…"
