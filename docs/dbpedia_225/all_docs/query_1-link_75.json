        "text": "ALIAS JESSE JAMES (1959) - Woody Allen often said that in his early films he was just trying to be Bob Hope. It is pretty obvious while watching this movie - you can see that what Bob Hope was doing was pretty similar to what Allen would do. So why was Allen funny and Hope not? I credit Allen's writing, which he said was inspired by trying to impress college educated girls that he was better educated than he was. Norman Z. McLeod directed this silly tale which was dedicated to the door-to-door insurance salesmen who made America great. First we have to accept that at one point Jesse James, played by Wendell Corey, traveled to New York City, and even though he was recognized and became front page news, was not bothered by local authorities. He met incompetent insurance salesman Bob Hope in a bar where he exchanged a bag full of cash for an $100,000 insurance policy to be paid out to future wife Rhonda Fleming. Hope's boss saw this policy as potentially destroying the company, so Hope was ordered to go out and make certain that Corey didn't die. In Missouri, Corey hatched a plot to disguise Hope as Jesse James, murder him and then collect the insurance policy. Naturally, all of Corey's attempts failed, and Fleming fell in love with Hope. Hope foiled Corey's attempt to marry Fleming by spiking the punch with \"magic mushrooms\", but finally the big showdown happened back in town. Being unable to pull a Winchester from the rifle rack in the sheriff's office, Hope drags the whole rack out into the street and succeeds in firing all of the rifles at once - which is a trick similar to what the Scotish family does in defending the farm in SETTE PISTOLE PER I MACGREGOR seven years later. Earlier, Hope pulled a trick which was echoed in PER UN PUGNO DI DOLLARI - he wore an armor breast plate under his shirt before a gunfight. As the James gang attacked, Hope fought back - not knowing that a host of Western guest stars showed up to help him - Hugh O'Brian from Wyatt Earp, Ward Bond from Wagon Train, James Arness from Gunsmoke, Roy Rogers (who seemed to have killed a man, which he never did on his TV show), Fess Parker from Davy Crockett, Gail Davis from Annie Oakley, Gary Cooper, Jay Silverheels from The Lone Ranger and non Western star but frequent Hope sidekick Bing Crosby. Finally, Corey and brother Frank, played by Jim Davis, were arrested and Hope made president of the insurance company. The film ended with Fleming visiting Hope in his office after he told a client that he had insurance for everything. After we see that they now have six children with another on the way, Hope commented that you can't get insurance against everything. Also in the cast were Mike Mazurki, Gloria Talbot as an Indian princess who never got a reward for saving Hope, and Glenn Strange as a member of the James gang. This was a production of Hope Enterprises that was able to reuse some footage from the 1939 JESSE JAMES just as THE TRUE STORY OF JESSE JAMES had done.\n\nAMERICAN OUTLAWS (2001) - THE TRUE STORY OF JESSE JAMES keeps looking better and better. Who in 2000 thought it was the right time for another bullshit movie about Jesse James - and one which has an happy ending? It is appropriate that the legal disclaimer reports that this is a work of fiction and any resemblance to persons living or dead is coincidental. Unlike the 1939 JESSE JAMES movie, this one mentions the James brothers as members of Quantrill's Raiders, but pretends that they laid down their weapons when they heard that the war was over. With action scenes seemingly inspired by John Woo movies, Colin Farrell makes Jesse into a old time Batman. Just as in the 1939 flick, Jesse becomes an outlaw because of the deeds of the evil railroad men. This time the villains are personified as Terry O'Quinn and his boss Harris Yulin. Tossing away the bullshit about \"Remington\" agents, Timothy Dalton plays Allan Pinkerton himself, taking on the James case personally. Most of the film is taken up with comedic banter featuring one-upsmanship between the James and the Younger brothers. Ali Larter appears as Zee, who won't marry Jesse until he gives up the outlaw life - but then fires a cannon to stop a train carrying her husband to trial in Washington D.C. Some critics thought this was an attempt to follow the success of YOUNG GUNS, but that film paid some attention to history.\n\nTHE DARK (2005) - It is nice to see Sean Bean play a nice guy in this. On the other hand, why would anyone want to make a movie in which for most of its running time Maria Bello is in torment, and then end it with a bummer. Thankfully, director John Fawcett would redeem himself later by co-creating the Orphan Black TV series. For a bit, this looked like it would be a remake of POLTERGEIST with a mother going into the beyond to rescue her daughter. But it isn't.\n\nDARK TIDE (2012) - This film seems more interested in being a tourist advertisement for nature reserves in South Africa than in being a thriller. There are gorgeous shots of huge seal populations and cautionary messages about swimming with the sharks. But, being a shark movie, people get killed. Alot of the action takes place at night and in attempting to get realistic lighting, the filmmakers fail to make the attacks visable. Who the hell were the military like scuba divers that suddenly show up in the middle of the movie inorder to be killed while searching at night for something? If they were connected to the stupid rich guy who dragged the reluctant shark expert Halle Berry out to \"Shark Alley\" I missed the information. Former actor John Stockwell showed a lot of promise at the beginning of his directing career with CRAZY/BEAUTIFUL and BLUE CRUSH. Hopefully this and SEAL TEAM 6: THE RAID ON OSAMA BIN LADEN aren't where his career is heading.\n\nINVASION U.S.A. (1985) - Sure it is stupid. But is it fun? No, just irritating. The special effects and stunt guys get a real workout on this movie, which has a lot of explosions, but director Joseph Zito fails to create any decent action sequences. The screenwriters lose points for creating an annoying female journalist character, played by Melissa Prophet, but gain back some points by not having her become a romantic interest. Was Tom Savini brought in to do Special Effects Makeup on the woman getting a straw slammed up her nose?\n\nIT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY (2010) - In 2004 author Ned Vizzini checked himself into a psychiatric hospital having had suicidal thoughts. In 2006, he turned that experience into a Young Adult novel, which was made into a movie by writer/directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck. Three years later Vizzini gave up his battle and killed himself at the age of 32. But that's not the material for the movie. In the movie, 16 year old Keir Gilchrist feels the weight of the world and so he seeks help at an hospital. They sign him up for a five day observation stay, but as the juvenile wing is undergoing renovation, he is put into the adult ward. Viola Davis is the doctor who helps him to realize that he must resist pressure to be something he doesn't want to be and to figure out what he wants to do. Viewers can pretty much figure out the message of the movie from the very beginning, but the storytellers try to maintain interest with all of the characters in the ward. Zach Galifianakis gets the most screen time, but Gilchrist also gets a romance with Emma Roberts. It's nice to see Jeremy Davies play a good guy, and our hero's parents are played by Lauren Graham and Jim Gaffigan. Author Ned Vizzini appears as the ward's music therapist who leads everyone in a fantasy performance of \"Under Pressure\" by David Bowie and Queen. Zoë Kravitz appears as the girl in school about whom Gilchrist obsesses and the viewer can certainly understand why. A few years later, Boden and Fleck directed CAPTAIN MARVEL for the MCU.\n\nROADHOUSE 66 (1984) - Driving along Route 66 to California, Judge Reinhold ignores hitchhiker Willem Dafoe until local thugs from Kingman, Arizona shoot a hole in his radiator. Dafoe offers to help Reinhold in exchange for a lift, but then they both find themselves stuck in Kingman. On the plus side, both find ladies to love - Kaaren Lee and Kate Vernon. On the negative side, the local thugs cause even more trouble. It all comes to a climax with a classic car race, in which the main villain, Alan Autry, sabotages Reinhold's drive by dropping scorpions onto his seat. Luckily, Dafoe is also in the race. After picking up Reinhold on the road, Dafoe looks to be winning when Autry pulls a pistol. Reinhold causes Dafoe to swerve, which sends Autry crashing into desert rocks. We don't get an update on Autry's condition before our heroes drive out of town in new cars with their ladies. A big plus is that Nelson Riddle's \"Theme from Route 66\" plays over the end credits. If you've been wanting to see Willem Dafoe sing \"Marie Marie\", this is the movie for you. John Mark Robinson gave up being an actor to direct this movie."
