        "text": "Le 06 May 2013\n\nPar Lionel Grenier\n\nTraduction par Lionel Grenier\n\nFollowing his first appearances on stage, Saverio Marconi played the brother of Fabio Testi’s character in Go Gorilla Go (Vai Gorilla, 1975) by Tonino Valerii. Two years later, he found recognition with Padre Padrone, the film directed by the Taviani brothers that won the Palme d’Or at Festival de Cannes.\n\nIn 1979, he obtained the part of Perlante in Contraband by Lucio Fulci and worked again with Fabio Testi at the same time. Until the mid-80’s, Saverio Marconi continued to appear on the big screen before focusing fully on the stage.\n\nHow were you hired for the part of Perlante in Contraband?\n\nLucio had seen my movies and he called me. We met, and he was immediatly convinced that the part was for me.\n\nHow was Lucio Fulci with you. He had a strong character. I guess you didn’t know him before…\n\nEverybody used to say that he had a very difficult personality, but he was always cordial with me. We got along very well immediatly. He understood that I had great esteem for him.\n\nIn Contraband, you acted again with Fabio Testi after having played his brother in Go Gorilla Go, a film by Tonino Valerii. How was working with him on the set?\n\nGo Gorilla Go was undoubtedly my first important part in a movie. Working again with Fabio was a true pleasure, and we have stayed friends after the shooting.\n\nPerlante dies violently, as his throat explodes. The scenes with special makeup effects often are painful for actors. How was with you?\n\nI’m a little bit annoyed when I remember this scene, because the first take was not good and that was my fault. I died too quickly, and as we shot the scene in slow motion, the effect wouldn’t be great. So they put me make-up once again, and the second take was the good one : this is the one you see in the movie.\n\nWhat is the memory of Fulci you keep today?\n\nI remember a man of great culture, with a rare sense of cinema: a master!"
