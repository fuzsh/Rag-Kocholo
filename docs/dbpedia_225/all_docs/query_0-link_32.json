        "text": "Landschlacht, Switzerland, Tuesday 17 September 2019\n\nDamn that man!\n\nOne man’s writings has had and continue to have a major effect on my life and this has been reflected in my travels and I have already spoken of the man previously in this blog.\n\nAbove: Charles Dickens, New York, 1867\n\n(Please see Canada Slim and the Dickensian Moment – first published as “Goodbye, Charles” on 9 June 2015.)\n\n(As one of the shortest and woefully inadequate posts I have ever written, expect to see an updated version of “Goodbye, Charles” as soon as possible and the addition of another post that continues the chronicle of my first travels in Europe last described in Canada Slim and the Promised Land – first published as “That which survives 3: The promised land“.)\n\nIt was he who made me decide to first enter Britain via Broadstairs.\n\nAbove: Dickens House Museum, Broadstairs\n\nIt was he who compelled me to convince my good friends Samantha and Iain to visit his birthplace in Portsmouth.\n\nAbove: Charles Dickens Birthplace Museum, Portsmouth\n\nIt was he who inspired me to first find the courage to write.\n\nIt was he whose footsteps I was determined to trace during my visit to London in the last week of October 2017.\n\nMy wife had purchased for us two London Passes, offering free entry to over 60 attractions, as well as free public transport on buses, on the Tube, and on trains.\n\nShe strongly suggested I use mine as much as possible during the time when she was attending her medical conference.\n\n26 October was the first day that I would have a chance to view London on my own.\n\nI had, following the Passbook alphabetically, already visited the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Manhir that morning, so my next goal was the Charles Dickens Museum in the Bloomsbury district.\n\nAbove: BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir\n\n(For previous posts on London, please see….\n\nCanada Slim….\n\nand the Paddington Arrival\n\nand the Street Walked Too Often\n\nUnderground\n\nand the Outcast\n\nand the Wonders on the Wall\n\nand the Calculated Cathedral\n\nand the Right Man\n\nand the Queen’s Horsemen\n\nand the Royal Peculiar\n\nand the Lamp Ladies\n\nand the Uncertainty Principle\n\nand the Museum of Many\n\nand the Breviary of Bartholew\n\nand the Body Snatchers\n\nand the Freudian Slippers\n\nand the Mandir of Nose Hill )\n\nLondon, England, 26 October 2017\n\nFew cities are as closely associated with one writer as London is with Charles Dickens (1812 – 1870).\n\nThe recurrent motifs in his novels have become the clichés of Victorian London (though Dickens was active and successful before Queen Victoria came to the throne) – the fog, the slums and alleys, the prisons and workhouses and the stinking river.\n\nDrawing on his own personal experience, Dickens was able to describe the workings of the law and the conditions of the poor with an unrivalled accuracy.\n\nAbove: Charles Dickens, 1850\n\nBorn in Portsmouth (Please see Canada Slim and the Dickensian Moment.), Dickens was the second of eight children.\n\nHis father, John Dickens, was a clerk who worked for the Navy and had set up home in Portsmouth with his wife Elizabeth.\n\nAbove: Old Portsmouth\n\nIn 1817 John was posted to the dockyard in Chatham.\n\nJohn and his family took a full part in the life of the community.\n\nThey were friendly with neighbours and with the family of a local landlord.\n\nCharles and his sister Fanny were frequently set up by their father atop a table in the Mitre Inn to entertain the tavern with songs and ballads of the day.\n\nIt was in Chatham that Charles began his education.\n\nAbove: Chatham Dockyard\n\nHis widowed aunt Mary Allen married for a second time while the Dickens family were in Chatham.\n\nAbove: 2 Ordnance Terrace, Chatham (Dickens’ home: 1817 – 1821)\n\nThis was to a widowed doctor, Matthew Lambert, who had a son Matthew, a little older than Charles and became a great influence upon this early part of Charles’ life, for it was Matthew who introduced Charles to the wonders of the theatre.\n\nThis was the beginning of a lifelong passion.\n\n“I tried to recollect whether I had ever been in any theatre in my life from which I had not brought away some pleasant association, however poor the theatre, and I protest, I could not remember even one.”\n\nIn fact, Charles always had a great relish for bad theatre.\n\n“Allow me to introduce myself—first negatively.\n\nNo landlord is my friend and brother.\n\nNo chambermaid loves me.\n\nNo waiter worships me.\n\nNo boots admires and envies me.\n\nNo round of beef or tongue or ham is expressly cooked for me.\n\nNo pigeon pie is especially made for me.\n\nNo hotel advertisement is personally addressed to me.\n\nNo hotel room tapestried with great coats and railway wrappers is set apart for me.\n\nNo house of public entertainment in the United Kingdom greatly cares for my opinion of its brandy or sherry.\n\nWhen I go upon my journeys, I am not usually rated at a low figure in the bill.\n\nWhen I come home from my journeys, I never get any commission.\n\nI know nothing about prices, and should have no idea, if I were put to it, how to wheedle a man into ordering something he doesn’t want.\n\nAs a town traveller, I am never to be seen driving a vehicle externally like a young and volatile pianoforte van, and internally like an oven in which a number of flat boxes are baking in layers.\n\nAs a country traveller, I am rarely to be found in a gig, and am never to be encountered by a pleasure train, waiting on the platform of a branch station, quite a Druid in the midst of a light Stonehenge of samples.\n\nAnd yet—proceeding now, to introduce myself positively—I am both a town traveller and a country traveller, and am always on the road.\n\nFiguratively speaking, I travel for the great house of Human Interest Brothers, and have rather a large connection in the fancy goods way.\n\nLiterally speaking, I am always wandering here and there from my rooms in Covent Garden, London—now about the city streets: now, about the country by-roads—seeing many little things, and some great things, which, because they interest me, I think may interest others.\n\nThese are my chief credentials as the Uncommercial Traveller.”\n\nIn The Uncommercial Traveller, he revisited Rochester where he enjoyed the somewhat shaky productions he saw there.\n\nHe does not spare the company:\n\n“Many wondrous secrets of Nature had I come to the knowledge of in that sanctuary:\n\nOf which not the least terrific were, that the witches in Macbeth bore an awful resemblance to the Thanes and other proper inhabitants of Scotland, and that the good King Duncan could not rest in his grave, but was constantly coming out of it and calling himself somebody else.”\n\nAbove: High Street, Rochester\n\nJohn Dickens’ job entitled him and his family to regard themselves as middle class, but the middle classes had little money behind them if things went wrong or if they couldn’t support their large families in seizing the opportunities they had anticipated.\n\nProsperity could unravel very quickly.\n\nBy the time John was recalled to London in 1822, the debts were considerable and his new post meant a drop in salary.\n\nAbove: John Dickens (1785 – 1851)\n\nSuch was the family situation in 1823 that the young Charles, age 11, had to go out to work, finding employment in a boot-blacking factory, Warren’s Blacking Warehouse, on the north bank of the Thames, near the site of the modern Charing Cross Station.\n\nCharles and his colleagues had to cover pots of boot polish (blacking) and paste on to them paper labels.\n\nHe was paid six shillings a week.\n\nGreat numbers of children in early 19th century England would have done similar work – and many, much, much worse.\n\n“It was a crazy, tumbledown old house, abutting, of course, on the river, and literally overrun with rats.\n\nIts wainscotted rooms and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, and the sound of their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and the decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again.\n\nThe counting house was on the first floor, looking over the coal barges and the river.\n\nThere was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work.”\n\nThis episode affected Charles profoundly.\n\nHe thought his parents had given up on him.\n\n“It is amazing to me how I could have been so easily cast away at such an age.\n\nIt is amazing to me, that, even after my descent into the poor little drudge I had been since we came to London, no one had compassion enough for me … to suggest that something might have been spared, as certainly it might have been, to place me at any common school ….\n\nNo one made any sign.\n\nMy father and mother were quite satisfied.\n\nThey could hardly have been more so, if I had been 20 years of age, distinguished at a Grammar School and going to Cambridge.”\n\nAbove: Cambridge University coat-of-arms\n\nOn 20 February 1824 John Dickens was arrested and imprisoned in Marshalsea Debtors’ Prison.\n\nAbove: Marshalsea Prison Gate\n\nCharles was deeply ashamed of his family’s circumstances and hurt further when his mother forced him to keep his blacking job even after his father’s release.\n\nAbove: Elizabeth Dickens (1789 – 1863)\n\nThis influenced Dickens’s view that a father should rule the family, and a mother find her proper sphere inside the home:\n\n“I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back.”\n\nHis mother’s requesting his return was a factor in his dissatisfied attitude towards women.\n\nRighteous indignation stemming from his own situation and the conditions under which working-class people lived became major themes of his works, and it was this unhappy period in his youth to which he alluded in his favourite, and most autobiographical, novel, David Copperfield:\n\n“I had no advice, no counsel, no encouragement, no consolation, no assistance, no support, of any kind, from anyone, that I can call to mind, as I hope to go to Heaven!“\n\nIn the end, a number of circumstances brought an opportunity for change.\n\nJohn inherited some money, began receiving a pension from the Navy and started working as a journalist, thus enabling the family to dispense with the few shillings Charles was adding to the family income.\n\nDickens got to school eventually.\n\nHe spent two years at Wellington House, which he remembered with little affection.\n\nHe did not consider it to be a good school:\n\n“Much of the haphazard, desultory teaching, poor discipline punctuated by the headmaster’s sadistic brutality, the seedy ushers and general run-down atmosphere, are embodied in Mr Creakle’s Establishment in David Copperfield.”\n\nWhen he left, at age 15, he was ready for work.\n\nAn acquaintance of the family found Charles work as a lawyer’s clerk with the firm of Ellis and Blackmore, which lasted 18 months.\n\nDickens worked at the law office of Ellis and Blackmore, attorneys, of Holborn Court, Gray’s Inn, as a junior clerk from May 1827 to November 1828.\n\nAbove: Gray’s Inn Square, London\n\nCharles was a gifted mimic and impersonated those around him: clients, lawyers, and clerks.\n\nHe went to theatres obsessively—he claimed that for at least three years he went to the theatre every single day.\n\nHis favourite actor was Charles Mathews and Dickens learnt his monopolylogues (farces in which Mathews played every character) by heart.\n\nAbove: Charles Matthews (1776 – 1835)\n\nThen, having learned Gurney’s system of shorthand in his spare time, he left to become a freelance reporter.\n\nAbove: Example of Thomas Gurney (1705 – 1770) shorthand\n\nA distant relative, Thomas Charlton, was a freelance reporter at Doctors’ Commons and Dickens was able to share his box there to report the legal proceedings for nearly four years.\n\nAbove: Doctors’ Commons in the early 19th century\n\nThis education was to inform works such as Nicholas Nickleby, Dombey and Son, and especially Bleak House—whose vivid portrayal of the machinations and bureaucracy of the legal system did much to enlighten the general public and served as a vehicle for dissemination of Dickens’s own views regarding, particularly, the heavy burden on the poor who were forced by circumstances to “go to law“.\n\nCharles had family in journalism.\n\nHis father wrote occasional pieces, but Charles also had a maternal uncle, John Henry Barrow, who in 1828 launched The Mirror of Parliament.\n\nIt was not long before Charles was part of Barrow’s parliamentary reporting team and was soon striking out writing for other publications, including the radical newspaper The True Sun.\n\nSometime before 1830, Dickens fell in love with a young woman called Maria Beadnell, the daughter of a banker.\n\nThe relationship between them flashed on and off for around four years, despite hostility from her parents, interference from friends and Maria’s own capricious nature.\n\nThe letters that survive show how thoroughly Dickens was absorbed in pursuing her.\n\nMaria’s parents disapproved of the courtship and ended the relationship by sending her to school in Paris.\n\nWhen the end finally came, he wrote to her, claiming:\n\n“I have never loved and I can never love any human creature breathing but yourself.”\n\nAbove: Maria Beadnell (1810 – 1886)\n\nShe is thought to be the model for the character Dora in David Copperfield.\n\nAbove: David Copperfield and Dora Spenlow\n\nMany years later, Dickens got a letter from Maria out of the blue and a short correspondence between them began in which he proclaimed the intensity of his original feelings for her.\n\nThe tone of these letters soon changed after he arranged to see her and she turned out to be “toothless, fat, old and ugly” (her words).\n\nAbove: Miriam Margoyles as Maria Beadnell Winter\n\nThe Maria romance is interesting because of the marked contrast it makes with Dickens’ engagement and marriage.\n\nCatherine Hogarth, the daughter of his boss at the Evening Chronicle, could hardly have been a more different young woman.\n\nAt least Dickens looked at her in a completely different way.\n\nHis letters to her are affectionate but occasionally overbearing, as if he was asserting himself to ensure that no more nonsense got in the way of his own ambition.\n\nHe was particularly careful to outline the primacy of his work and its demands.\n\nHis commitments at this time were extremely heavy.\n\nCatherine and Charles married on 2 April 1836 and went for a week’s honeymoon to Chalk in Kent (during which, true to form, Dickens was busy with The Pickwick Papers).\n\nAbove: Catherine Hogarth Dickens (1816 – 1879)\n\nIn August 1834 Charles was given a permanent position on The Morning Chronicle, a liberal paper, to report on all parliamentary matters.\n\nThis included elections (there were two in 1835) and political meetings – all around the country, before there were railroads.\n\nDeadlines were nevertheless overwhelmingly important and Dickens experienced many freezing, wet stagecoach journeys, bouncing about, writing on his knees, racing back to London to get his account in before the rival reporters on The Times.\n\nDickens’ first published piece of creative work appeared in the Monthly Magazine in 1833.\n\nIt was called “A Dinner at Poplar Walk“.\n\nThe publication had a circulation of 600 and the young author wasn’t paid, but he knew what it all meant.\n\nAbove: Monthly Magazine (1796 – 1843) issue, 1 February 1810\n\nIn the preface of the cheap edition of The Pickwick Papers, Dickens tells us that he practically smuggled the piece into the magazine’s offices:\n\n“It was dropped stealthily one evening at twilight, with fear and trembling, into a dark letter box, in a dark office, up a dark court in Fleet Street.”\n\nThe piece’s emergence into print was an occasion of some emotion:\n\n“I walked down to Westminster Hall and turned into it for half an hour, because my eyes were so dimmed with joy and pride, that they could not bear the street and were not fit to be seen there.”\n\nMore pieces for the Monthly Magazine followed.\n\nThese were comic stories, which owed a lot to the theatrical farces so common on the London stage.\n\nIt was at the end of one of these pieces, published in May 1834, that he signed his name as “Boz“, the nom de plume by which he first began to establish his reputation and indeed his brand.\n\nBoz being a family nickname he employed as a pseudonym for some years.\n\nDickens apparently adopted it from the nickname “Moses“, which he had given to his youngest brother Augustus Dickens, after a character in Oliver Goldsmith’s The Vicar of Wakefield.\n\nAbove: Augustus Dickens (1827 – 1866)\n\nWhen pronounced by anyone with a head cold, “Moses” became “Boses“—later shortened to Boz.\n\nAs “Boz“, Dickens began to collect readers.\n\nHe was given further opportunities to please them.\n\nDickens began to write occasional pieces for the Morning Chronicle in addition to his reporting.\n\nThese were his “sketches” – informal surveys of parts of London, London themes or observations of London people, held together by a conversational tone rather than a narrative: a Londoner talking to Londoners.\n\nWhen an evening sister paper to the Morning Chronicle was launched, Dickens obtained a salary to continue his writing explorations in the same vein.\n\nAbove: London, 1886\n\nThe increasing exposure brought Dickens to the attention of Harrison Ainsworth, a writer not much read today, but a real star of the literary scene at this time.\n\nAinsworth admired Boz‘s work and introduced Dickens to his own publisher John Macrone.\n\nAbove: William Harrison Ainsworth (1805 – 1882)\n\nSoon a collected volume of the newspaper and magazine pieces with drawings of George Cruikshank, the leading illustrator of the day, was published in February 1836.\n\nSketches by Boz sold so well that a second edition was needed that year and two more in 1837.\n\nAs the first edition of Sketches by Boz emerged in 1836, Dickens was approached by the publishers Chapman and Hall.\n\nThey came with an idea that had been proposed to them in turn by a well-known illustrator, Robert Seymour.\n\nThe plan went like this:\n\nSeymour would produce a series of engravings depicting the amusing mishaps attending a club of Cockney sportsmen – men from the new middle classes, with money to spend on the aristocratic pursuits of previous generations: hunting, shooting and fishing.\n\nThese illustrations would be published as a monthly serial.\n\nWould Dickens care to write some text to help string the images together?\n\nFourteen pounds a month might be possible.\n\nNo one really knows what or how much Dickens saw in this offer at the time.\n\nHe liked the money.\n\nHe was told that serials were a “low, cheap form of publication” that would ruin him.\n\nThe fact that he kept all his other irons in the fire suggests that he did not count too much on the new venture establishing his reputation.\n\nBut that is exactly what it did.\n\nHe claims, in the preface to The Pickwick Papers, that he recognized that the idea wouldn’t do:\n\n“I objected, on consideration, that although born and partly bred in the country I was no great sportsman, that the idea was not novel, and had already been much used, that it would infinitely better for the plates to arise naturally out of the text, and that I should like to take my own way….”\n\nAt first sales were disappointing, but by the end of its run in November 1837, The Pickwick Papers was selling 40,000 copies per month, it had been adapted for the stage many times over and the words of its characters seemed to be on everyone’s lips – as was the name of its young author.\n\nAfter their 1836 wedding, Charles took Catherine to a set of chambers he was renting in Furnival’s Inn, one of the inns of court, the traditional home of English law practice and accommodation for many non-lawyers too.\n\nAs The Pickwick Papers started bringing in a more secure income, Charles set his sights on more substantial living quarters.\n\nThese turned out to be at 48 Doughty Street, into which Catherine and Charles moved with their son Charley in March 1837.\n\nAbove: 48 Doughty Street, London\n\nThey took in Catherine’s younger sister Mary Hogarth, who had supported Catherine during her first pregnancy.\n\nIt was not unusual for a woman’s unwed sister to live with and help a married couple.\n\nDickens became very attached to Mary.\n\nShe inspired characters in many of his books.\n\nMary is seen as the inspiration for Rose Maylie in Oliver Twist.\n\nShe is also seen as the inspiration for Little Nell in The Old Curiosity Shop.\n\nNell had many traits that Dickens associated to Howarth, including describing Nell as “young, beautiful and good“.\n\nOther characters believed to have been inspired by Mary include:\n\nKate Nickleby, the 17-year-old sister of the hero of the novel Nicholas Nickleby\n\nAgnes Wickfield, the heroine in David Copperfield\n\nRuth Pinch from Martin Chuzzlewit\n\nLilian, the child who appears in Trotty Veck’s visions in The Chimes\n\nDot Peerybingle, the sister in The Cricket on the Hearth.\n\nAbove: Mary Hogarth (1819 – 1837)\n\nUnlike Mary, Dickens’ wife Catherine does not appear to have been the inspiration for any of his characters.\n\nBloomsbury is a district in the West End of London, famed as a fashionable residential area and as the home of numerous prestigious cultural, intellectual and educational institutions.\n\nIt is bounded by Fitzrovia to the west, Covent Garden to the south, Regent’s Park and St. Pancras to the north, and Clerkenwell to the east.\n\nBloomsbury is home of the British Museum, the largest museum in the United Kingdom, and numerous educational institutions, including the University College London, the University of London, the New College of the Humanities, the University of Law, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and many others.\n\nAbove: The British Museum, London\n\nBloomsbury is an intellectual and literary hub for London, as home of world-known Bloomsbury Publishing, publishers of the Harry Potter series, and namesake of the Bloomsbury Set, a group of famous British intellectuals, including author Virginia Woolf and economist John Maynard Keynes, among others.\n\nAbove: Virginia Woolf (1882 – 1941)\n\nBloomsbury began to be developed in the 17th century under the Earls of Southampton, but it was primarily in the 19th century, under the Duke of Bedford, which the district was planned and built as an affluent Regency era residential area by famed developer James Burton.\n\nThe district is known for its numerous garden squares, including Bloomsbury Square, Russell Square and Tavistock Square, among others.\n\nNotable residents of Bloomsbury have included J.M. Barrie (Peter Pan), Charles Darwin, Charles Dickens, Ricky Gervais, Vladimir Lenin, Bob Marley, Catherine Tate (Donna Noble, Doctor Who) and William Butler Yeats.\n\nAbove: Vladimir Lenin (1870 – 1924)\n\nDespite a plethora of blue plaques, Bloomsbury boasts just one literary museum, the Charles Dickens Museum, the only one of the writer’s fifteen London addresses to survive intact.\n\nDoughty Street was a well-to-do gated Georgian street when Dickens – flush with the success of his first two published works – moved here in 1837.\n\nThe family lived in this light and airy house for two years, during which he completed Oliver Twist and Nicholas Nickleby and worked on Barnaby Rudge.\n\nCatherine gave birth to two children in the bedroom here.\n\nOn Saturday, 6 May 1837, Charles took Catherine and Mary to the theatre.\n\nThey returned home in good spirits, enjoyed some supper and a drink together and went to bed at one in the morning.\n\nA few moments later Charles heard a cry from Mary’s bedroom and hurried in to find her still in her day clothes and visibly ill.\n\nCatherine came to see what was wrong.\n\nCharles said afterwards that they had no idea there was anything seriously the matter with Mary, but that they sent for medical assistance to be on the safe side.\n\nWhatever Dr. Pickthorn did had no effect, yet still there seemed no cause for alarm.\n\nMary was, after all, only 17 years old and until then had been in perfect health.\n\nFourteen hours went by before Mary sank under the attack and died – died in such a calm and gentle sleep, that although Charles had held her in his arms for some time before, when she was certainly living (for she swallowed a little brandy from his hand) Charles continued to support her lifeless form, long after her soul had fled to Heaven.\n\nThis was about 3 o’clock on Sunday afternoon.\n\n“Thank God she died in my arms and the very last words she whispered were of me.“, Charles told fellow reporter and friend Tom Beard.\n\nBefore Charles laid Mary’s body down he was able to remove a ring from her finger and put it on one of his own.\n\nAnd there it stayed for the rest of his life.\n\nAbove: Mary’s bedroom, Charles Dickens Museum\n\nMary’s death is fictionalized as the death of Little Nell in The Old Curiosity Shop.\n\nThe building at 48 Doughty Street was threatened with demolition in 1923, but was saved by the Dickens Fellowship, founded in 1902, who raised the mortgage and bought the property.\n\nThe house was renovated and the Dickens House Museum was opened in 1925, under the direction of an independent trust, now a registered charity.\n\nAbove: Study, Charles Dickens Museum\n\n48 Doughty Street is presented as far as possible in its inhabited state, the idea being to give the impression that the Dickens family is still resident.\n\nMuch of the house’s furniture belonged, at one time or another, to Dickens, and the house also owns the earliest known portrait of the writer (a miniature painted by his aunt Mary Allen in 1830).\n\nAbove: Charles Dickens\n\nPerhaps the best-known exhibit is the portrait of Dickens known as Dickens’s Dream by R. W. Buss, an original illustrator of The Pickwick Papers.\n\nThis unfinished portrait shows Dickens in his study at Gads Hill Place surrounded by many of the characters he had created.\n\nThe painting was begun in 1870 after Dickens’s death.\n\nAbove: Dickens’ Dream, Robert William Buss\n\n(Gads Hill Place in Higham, Kent, sometimes spelt Gadshill Place and Gad’s Hill Place, was the country home of Charles Dickens.\n\nToday the building is the independent Gad’s Hill School.\n\nThe house was built in 1780 for a former Mayor of Rochester, Thomas Stephens, opposite the present Sir John Falstaff Public House.\n\nGad’s Hill is where Falstaff commits the robbery that begins Shakespeare’s Henriad trilogy (Henry IV: Part 1, Henry IV: Part 2 and Henry V). )\n\nAbove: Gad’s Hill Place, Rochester\n\nOther notable artefacts in the Museum include numerous first editions and original manuscripts as well as original letters by Dickens, and many personal items owned by Dickens and his family.\n\nThe only known item of clothing worn by Dickens still in existence is also displayed at the Museum.\n\nThis is his Court suit and sword, worn when Dickens was presented to the Prince of Wales in 1870.\n\nThe Charles Dickens Museum also owns the adjacent house, #49, where they stage special exhibitions, house the bookshop and have a lovely café with free Wifi.\n\nThere runs within both London and Rochester (where Charles spent the last years of his life) a Dickens Trail.\n\nOn London’s Dickens Trail, there is:\n\nthe Old Curiosity Shop (currently a shoe shop) on Lincoln’s Inn Fields, the inspiration of Dickens’ novel of the same name\n\nthe atmospheric Inns of Court (once the headquarters of the Knights Templar) which feature in several Dickens novels\n\nNancy’s Steps, where Nancy tells Rose Maylie Oliver’s story in Oliver Twist\n\nthe evocative dockland area east of Shad Thames where Bill Sykes (also of Oliver Twist) had his hide-out.\n\n(This dockland area, known as China Wharf – today very photogenic with its stack of semicircular windows picked out in red – was once dubbed “the very capital of cholera“.\n\nIn 1849, the Morning Chronicle described it thus:\n\n“Jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class, ballast heavers, coal-whippers, brazen women, ragged children, and the very raff and refuse of the river, the visitor makes his way with difficulty along, assailed by offensive sights and sounds from the narrow alleys which branch off.”\n\nThis was the location of Dickens’ fictional Jacob’s Island, a place with “every imaginable sign of desolation and neglect“, where Bill Sykes met his end in Oliver Twist.)\n\nAbove: China Wharf, London\n\nCharles John Huffam Dickens (7 February 1812 – 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic.\n\nHe created some of the world’s best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era.\n\nHis works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and, by the 20th century, critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius.\n\nHis novels and short stories are still widely read today.\n\nDespite his lack of formal education, he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed readings extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer and campaigned vigorously for children’s rights, education and other social reforms.\n\nAbove: Charles Dickens, 1842\n\nDickens’s literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers.\n\nWithin a few years he had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire and keen observation of character and society.\n\nHis novels, most published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication.\n\nCliffhanger endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense.\n\nThe instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience’s reaction, and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback.\n\nFor example, when his wife’s chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities, Dickens improved the character with positive features.\n\nHis plots were carefully constructed and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives.\n\nAbove: Charles Dickens, 1850\n\nMasses of the illiterate poor chipped in ha’pennies to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring a new class of readers.\n\nHis 1843 novella A Christmas Carol remains especially popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre.\n\nOliver Twist and Great Expectations are also frequently adapted and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London.\n\nHis 1859 novel A Tale of Two Cities (set in London and Paris) is his best-known work of historical fiction.\n\nThe most famous celebrity of his era, public demand saw him undertake a series of public reading tours in the later part of his career.\n\nDickens has been praised by many of his fellow writers—from Leo Tolstoy to George Orwell, G. K. Chesterton and Tom Wolfe—for his realism, comedy, prose style, unique characterisations and social criticism.\n\nHowever, Oscar Wilde, Henry James and Virginia Woolf complained of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing and a vein of sentimentalism.\n\nAbove: Dickens’ chair, Charles Dickens Museum\n\nThe term Dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters.\n\nThere is much in Charles Dickens’ life before and up to his residency at 48 Doughty Street that I can relate with.\n\nCharles came from a large family, as did I, but like the titular hero of Oliver Twist it was not until later in my life did I come to realize that I was neither an orphan (nor an only child) as far as my biological heritage went.\n\nMy first work during my school years was labour intensive like Charles’ was.\n\nWhile his was labouring in a blacking factory, mine was summer employment as a farmhand.\n\n(A position I occasionally returned to when financing my travels.)\n\nLike Charles, I spent much of the early years of my life outdoors when I wasn’t reading voraciously.\n\nThe boy Charles read Tobias Smollett and Henry Fielding and The Arabian Nights.\n\nI read Charles Dickens, Robert Louis Stephenson and the adventures of the Hardy Boys.\n\nCharles was separated from his family by mounting debts and living beyond one’s means.\n\nIt is said that these were the cause of my biological parents’ break-up and it was the prevention of these to my foster parents that led to my being taken in for the provincial support the government provided for my care.\n\nUnlike Charles, I was never small for my age and I would by the age of 14 surpass Charles’ adult height of 5’9″ to reach my current height of 6’4″, but, like Charles, I had felt that I was a “not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy“.\n\nAfter my secondary and post-secondary studies, I, like Charles, worked as a clerk, but what for him would be a brief two years would be for me always a position to return to between my travels.\n\nI have worked as a clerk for a customs broker, federal government departments and for a registered charity.\n\nMore akin to George Orwell, I would later work as a teacher and a restaurant worker, but in a Dickensian vein, I have written (sometimes for money, sometimes for exposure) for local newspapers and school publications.\n\nI have never achieved great fame, but then neither have I greatly sought it to the extent that Dickens did.\n\nWhat I have always admired about Dickens and his works are:\n\nhis humour, satire and keen observation of character and society.\n\nhis carefully constructed plots wherein he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives.\n\nhis realism, comedy, prose style, unique characterisations and social criticism.\n\nhis walking which led to his descriptions of the neglected and forgotten corners of London.\n\n“Cities, like cats, will reveal themselves at night.“, wrote the poet Rupert Brooke.\n\nLondon’s own Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare, William Blake and Thomas De Quincey were all night time perambulators, but of those who walk the streets at night the supreme nightwalker was Charles Dickens.\n\nIn Great Expectations (1861), Pip at one point visits Miss Haversham in her home in Kent in order to inform her and her ward Estella, with whom he is still madly in love, that he has finally discovered the identity of his benefactor, the convict Magwitch.\n\nPip confirms that, because he knows Miss Haversham was not responsible for his transformation into a gentleman, he realizes that she and Estella have all along treated him not as their protegé but “as a kind of servant, to gratify a want or whim“.\n\nIt is on this occasion, too, that Estella admits she is to be married, as Pip feared, to the odious and oafish aristocrat Bentley Drummle.\n\nThus discarded, and in a deeply disconsolate state of mind, Pip escapes from Satis House and, as the afternoon light thickens, hides himself for a time “among some lanes and bypaths“.\n\nThen, in a moment of decision, he strikes off “to walk all the way to London“.\n\n“I could do nothing half so good for myself as tire myself out.”, he decides.\n\nIt is “past midnight” when he eventually crosses London Bridge.\n\nFour years later, Dickens made roughly the same journey on foot, in reverse.\n\nOne night in October 1857, when he was in his mid-forties, Dickens retired to bed in the family home in Bloomsbury, but found himself completely unable to get to sleep.\n\nHe had suffered from intermittent insomnia throughout his adult life, but on this occasion he felt particularly agitated.\n\nHe did not feel at home at home.\n\nSo at 0200 Dickens climbed out of bed, dressed in warm clothes and set off through the gaslit streets of the city.\n\nDickens had written more than two decades earlier:\n\n“The streets of London, to be beheld in the very height of their glory, should be seen on a dark, dull, murky winter’s night.\n\nWhen the heavy, lazy mist, which hangs over every object, makes the gas lamps look brighter.”\n\nIn the damp silence of the autumn night, beneath the scuffing sound of his boots on the stone pavements, Dickens would have heard the gas whispering its secrets in the softly rasping pipes.\n\nHeading south in the direction of the Thames, Dickens walked through London directly to Gad’s Hill Place, his country residence in Kent.\n\nLike Pip’s journey through the night, it was a distance of some 30 miles.\n\nCatherine and Charles had been….prolific – ten children – “the largest family ever known with the smallest disposition to do anything for themselves” as Dickens later described them – and 15 novels, each published in monthly (or weekly) installments, which were awaited with baited breath by the public.\n\nThen in 1857, at the peak of his career, Dickens fell in love with the actress, Ellen Ternan.\n\nCharles was 45, Ellen just 18.\n\nAbove: Ellen Ternan (1839 – 1914)\n\nOn the evening of his nightwalk, Catherine and Charles quarrelled.\n\nThey were becoming inrcreasingly estranged, partly because of his relationship with Ellen.\n\nFor this reason, Charles visited Tavistock House, their home at this time, only rarely.\n\nAbove: Tavistock House, London\n\nCharles spent most of the autumn of 1857 at Gad’s Hill Place.\n\nWhen he needed to be in central London, he tended to stay in a bachelor flat at the offices of his periodical, Household Words.\n\nIt was shortly after Charles insisted on partitioning the bedroom he shared with Catherine so that they could sleep separately.\n\nThe nighttime journey on foot to Gad’s Hill Place, driven by an acute sense of anguish and guilt, took Dickens little more than seven hours.\n\n(According to present day Google Maps, the same journey normally takes 9.5 hours.)\n\nAbove: Google Maps logo\n\nDickens was a fast walker, who took pride in the fact that he could sustain a pace of at least four miles an hour across long distances.\n\n(In my walking days my average pace was 3 mph and on a descent 5 mph.)\n\nAbove: Canada Slim, The Dutton Advance, 6 March 1991\n\nHis friends frequently complained of the speed and impatience with which he walked.\n\nAbove: Charles Dickens\n\nEdward Johnson, one of his biographers, wrote:\n\n“Sometimes his perspiring companions gave way to blisters and breathlessness.”\n\nCharles himself was boastful of his feats as a pedestrian.\n\nHe professed in 1860:\n\n“So much of my travelling is done on foot that if I cherished betting propensities, I should probably be found registered in sporting newspapers as the Elastic Novice, challenging all 11-stone mankind to competition in walking.”\n\nNo doubt he secretly harboured dreams of bettering Captain Barclay, a celebrated athlete who, in 1809, when pedestrianism first became a sporting activity, walked a thousand miles in a thousand hours for a thousand guineas.\n\nAbove: Captain Robert Barclay-Allardyce (1779 – 1854), the celebrated pedestrian\n\nIn the late 1850s, Dickens remained a fit man precisely because he insisted on walking, both in London and in the countryside, whenever he could find the opportunity.\n\nEven so, he was increasingly afflicted with ill health at this time.\n\nHis symptoms included neuralgic and rheumatic pains.\n\nHis feet also troubled him.\n\nAccording to biographer Claire Tomalin:\n\n“First his left foot, and then his right, took to swelling intermittedly, becoming so painful that during each attack he became unable to take himself on the great walks that were essential part and pleasure of his life.”\n\nDickens had gout, though he was reluctant to accept the idea, claiming instead that he contracted the pain because he had incautiously walked in snowy conditions.\n\nThis did not deter him from walking in all conditions, clement or inclement.\n\nG.K. Chesterton, identifiying a “streak of sickness” in Dickens, which he detected in the novelist’s “fervid” intelligence, nonetheless confirmed that “he suffered from no formidable malady and could always through life endure a great deal of exertion, even if it was only the exertion of walking violently all night.”\n\nAbove: Gilbert Keith Chesterton (1874 – 1936)\n\nFor John Hollingshead, who had been apprenticed to Dickens on Household Words, and who therefore saw a good deal of him in the 1850s, this proclivity for “violent walking” was itself a malady.\n\nHollingshead recalled in retrospect that “when Dickens lived in Tavistock House he developed a mania for walking long distances, which almost assumed the form of a disease.”\n\n“When he was restless, his brain excited by struggling with incidents or characters in the novel he was writing, he would frequently get up and walk through the night over Waterloo Bridge, along the London, New Kent and Old Kent Roads, past all the towns on the old Dover High Road, until he came to his roadside dwelling (Gad’s Hill Place).\n\nHis dogs barked when they heard his key in the wicket-gate.\n\nHis behaviour must have seemed madness to the ghost of Sir John Falstaff.”\n\n(Gad’s Hill Place stood opposite the Falstaff Inn, formerly a notorious haunt of robbers and highwaymen.)\n\nAbove: John Hollingshead (1827 – 1904)\n\nIt is likely, then, that Dickens conducted his 30-mile nightwalk to Kent on more than one occasion.\n\nBut Dickens’ celebrated feat on that night in October 1857 was less about overcoming physical afflictions than capitulating to his psychological ones.\n\nThis was a flight both from his everyday life and from his self.\n\nFrom an early age Charles had been running away from something, or walking “fast and far” from something.\n\n“Going astray“, he called it.\n\nIn an article entitled “Going Astray“, printed in Household Words in 1853, Dickens described how he had “got lost one day in the City of London” as an 8-year-old child and roamed and strayed and strolled through London’s precincts all day and into the night, until he found a watchman.\n\n“I have gone astray since, many times, and farther afield.“, Dickens concludes with a certain sad pride.\n\nChesterton argued that Dicken’s originality and genius resided in the fact that he possessed, “in the most sacred and serious sense of the term, the key of the street.”\n\n“Few of us understand the street.\n\nEven we step into it, as into a house or a room of strangers.\n\nFew of us see through the shining riddle of the street, the strange folk that belong to the street only – the street-walker or the street Arab, the nomads, who generation after generation, have kept their ancient secrets in the full blaze of the sun.\n\nOf the street at night many of us know even less.\n\nThe street at night is a great house locked up.\n\nBut Dickens had, if ever man had, the key of the street.\n\nHis stars were the lamps of the street.\n\nHis hero was the man in the street.\n\nHe could open the inmost door of his house – the door that leads into that secret passage which is lined with houses and roofed with stars.”\n\nNight Walks, first published in All the Year Round in 1860 and then reprinted in The Uncommercial Traveller in 1861, was Dickens’ finest, most haunting piece of non-fictional prose.\n\nAt once impressionistic and replete with intensely related detail, it relates his experiences on the streets of the capital between half past midnight (0030) and the moment when “the conscious gas begins to grow pale with the knowledge that daylight is coming.”\n\nA sense of solitude echoes through his sentences, empty and hollow as the midnight streets through which he walks.\n\n“When a church clock strikes, on homeless ears in the dead of the night, it may be at first be mistaken for company, but as the spreading circles of vibration echo out into eternal space, the mistake is rectified and the sense of loneliness is profounder.”\n\nDickens confesses to have discovered a lonely sense of community in the cold depths of the London night, among men defined by “a tendency to lurk and lounge, to be at street corners without intelligible reason“.\n\n“My principal object being to get through the night, the pursuit of it brought me into sympathetic relations with people who have no other object every night of the year.”\n\nThese are the everyday casualities of life in the capitalist metropolis – the victims of unemployment, addiction and other symptoms of social and spiritual alienation.\n\nThe homeless must conquer time and defend themselves against its blank emptiness, from minute to minute, moment by moment, the shame, desertion, wretchedness and exposure of the great capital, the wet, the cold, the slow hours and the swift clouds of the dismal night.\n\nFor the police, the proof of a home, a legal nocturnal place to stay, is the precondition for the recognition of existence.\n\nSo the situation of homelessness, roaming the night without aim, without rest, represents exclusion from society.\n\nIt is a form of non-existence, non-being, the outer limits of society’s psychological and sociological borderland, the hinterland of humanity, the dark hollow interior of human nature.\n\nLondon is a city where 55% of people are not ethnically white British, nearly 40% were born abroad, and 5% are living illegally in the shadows.\n\nEvery week 2,000 migrants unload at Victoria Coach Station, tens of thousands of migrants arriving here every year.\n\nBut who can trust statistics?\n\nYou will never understand what it means to be a beggar until you have slept on the streets.\n\nThey sleep in front of the glare of shop windows, for the light lends a sense of safety.\n\nCrackheads and Roma, street life, disorientation, a jumble of faces, an eternal rumble of traffic, where working girls sell their bodies and throw in their souls for free, the rhythm of the streets, a never sated drumbeat.\n\nUte (my wife) and I on London evenings are one of many after-dinner couples strolling along.\n\nI hear others with their contempt and disgust regard the beggars who congregate upon the concrete like lost church mice, like mangy parasites, cosmopolitan cockroaches, best belittled than assisted.\n\nThey are the invisible, because we choose to ignore them.\n\nThey are painful reminders of our privileged life that they cannot imagine having or, if once had, reacquiring.\n\nThey are the old and the prematurely aged, shuffling and stumbling, snuffling and sniffing, pleading for pennies from those whose hearts are void of compassion.\n\nWashed-up soiled souls marooned, listless and almost lifeless, easy prey to those who would use them for cruel sport, they lie beneath walls smeared in blood and feces upon flattened cardboard boxes that soften the sidewalk.\n\nHuman rubbish amidst human refuse, they are gaunt faces with sunken eyes, needing to beg to survive, to live, to exist, but to beg is to break the law.\n\nWhat is earned is confiscated.\n\nLaw and order trumps love and outreach.\n\nThey see the beggar as an offense not as a fellow human being.\n\nThose without homes are an invisible city deliberately unseen by the lucky with lodgings.\n\nCharles Dickens’ home is remembered as I hold my wife’s hand tightly to lend ourselves courage to encounter what we do not comprehend.\n\nCharles feared poverty, was obsessed with money, felt that unease that only those who have raised themselves out from poverty can truly understand.\n\nBut his talent, hard work, perseverance and good fortune never required a return to a hand-to-mouth, payment-to-payment survival.\n\nHe encountered the homeless and destitute during his night walks but was never reduced to joining their ranks.\n\nAbove: Charles Dickens\n\nMy wife and I have London lodgings during our sojourn here and a warm comfortable flat awaiting our return to Switzerland.\n\nI too have known a poverty of sorts, though my begging was limited to government assistance and hitching rides and seeking emergency overnight shelter in the places where rides left me.\n\nIn my long-distance walking days I slept wherever I could and rarely needed the tent I carried upon my backpack.\n\nLike those migrants of London for whom hope remains despite their desperate circumstances, I worked where and when I could, sometimes in the safety of the law, sometimes not.\n\nThough I have never been much of an evening perambulator I have nonetheless encountered the homeless in more than a few cities I have visited.\n\nI see it regularly amongst the Roma in Konstanz and I give as prudently as I can when I encounter the beggar Bruno in St. Gallen.\n\nI remember the helpless and hapless of London and Paris, Seoul and Istanbul, Naples and New York.\n\nAbove: The Old Beggar of Bordeaux, Louis Dewis, 1916\n\nI think of Oliver Twist.\n\n“Advancing to the master,

place.\n\nTake the eminent Canarian author Alberto Vásquez-Figueroa as an example of the first.\n\nAlberto’s grandfather was an architect.\n\nAlberto’s father was born in Guadalajara while Alberto’s grandmother was there.\n\nAlberto’s mother, the daughter of a local farmer, was born on Isla de Lobos, one of the Canary Islands.\n\nAlberto himself was born on 11 October 1936 in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, although he had not yet reached one year old when his family was exiled for political reasons to Spanish Africa, since his father was a Socialist Republican during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nThere Alberto spent his childhood.\n\nHis father was released, but he was admitted to hospital for several years because of tuberculosis.\n\nWhile Alberto was in Africa, his mother died.\n\nAlberto’s care was picked up by his uncle, the civil administrator of the military fort in the Spanish Sahara where they lived.\n\nHis uncle provided Alberto books to read, especially beloved adventure novels, by authors such as Joseph Conrad (Heart of Darkness), Herman Melville (Moby Dick) and Jules Verne (Around the World in 80 Days), which would later become Alberto’s preferred genre.\n\nSince his youth, Alberto visited the Sahara and would later describe the culture of the desert region in his writing.\n\nAt 16 Alberto returned to Tenerife to study, working as a scuba instructor in the Cruz del Sur Diving School, along with Jacques Cousteau, where he would remain for two years.\n\nAlberto worked on the rescue of bodies in Lake Sanabria after the Vega de Tera Dam burst, destroying the town of Ribadelago.\n\nAbove: Monument to the victims of Ribadelago\n\nHe attended the studios of the Escuela Oficial de Periodismo de Madrid in a 1962 and worked in the Destino specials.\n\nHe was a war correspondent in La Vanguardia, for TVE (Televisión Española) and for the program A toda plana with de la Cuadra Salcedo and Silva.\n\nAs a correspondent, he documented revolutionary wars in countries such as Bolivia, the Dominican Republic and Guatemala.\n\nHe later wrote his first novel, Arena y viento (Sand and Wind) and in 1975, he published as many as 14 to 15 novellas such as Ébano.\n\nHis other works include Tuareg and El perro as well as the sagas Cienfuegos, Bora Bora, Manaos and Piratas.\n\nÉbano was cinematized in 1979 by director Richard Fleischer and renamed Ashanti.\n\nAshanti (also called Ashanti, Land of No Mercy) is a 1979 action adventure film.\n\nDespite its impressive cast and setting (on location in the Sahara and in Kenya, Israel and Sicily), it was widely panned by critics upon release.\n\nMichael Caine was reportedly very disappointed with the project and claims it was his third worst film.\n\nAshanti is an action adventure film, set against the background of modern-day slave trading, with a man who determinedly takes on a perilous journey in order to find his beautiful wife, who has been kidnapped by brutal slave traders.\n\nDavid and Anansa Linderby (Caine and supermodel Beverley Johnson respectively) are doctors with the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nOn a medical mission carrying out an inoculation programme, they visit a West African village.\n\nWhile David takes photographs of tribal dancers, Anansa goes swimming alone.\n\nShe is attacked and abducted by slave traders led by Suleiman (Peter Ustinov), who mistake her for an Ashanti tribeswoman.\n\nThe police can do nothing to find her and David has almost given up hope when he hears rumours that Anansa has been kidnapped by Suleiman to be sold to Arab Prince Hassan (Omar Sharif).\n\nThe African authorities deny that the slave trade even exists.\n\nSo David must find help in a shadowy world where the rescuers of slaves are just as ruthless as the traders themselves.\n\nAs David tracks her across Africa and the Sahara desert, he is helped by a member of the Anti-Slavery League (Rex Harrison), a mercenary helicopter pilot (William Holden) and Malik (Kabir Bedi) a tribesman who is seeking revenge on Suleiman.\n\nAlberto’s novel Tuareg was cinematized in 1984 by director Enzo G. Castellari.\n\nTuareg is a thriller novel that was his most critically and commercially successful, with global sales in excess of 5,000,000 copies.\n\nIt was adapted into a 1984 movie starring Mark Harmon, Tuareg – The Desert Warrior.\n\nThis is the first book in the Tuareg trilogy, followed by Los Ojos del Tuareg and El Último Tuareg.\n\nOne day, two old men and a boy appear in Gacel Shayah’s camp in the Sahara.\n\nHe, a noble inmouchar observing the millennial tradition of the desert, shelters travelers.\n\nBut he fails to protect them.\n\nPeople in dusty military uniforms violate the ancient hospitality law.\n\nThey kill the boy and take one old man away.\n\nGasel Shayah remembers the great commandment of the Tuareg people:\n\nYour guest is under your protection.\n\nTherefore, he must seek vengeance.\n\nAlberto’s novel Iguana was cinematized in 1988 by Monte Hellman.\n\nIguana is a 1988 American adventure drama/thriller film starring Everett McGill in the main role.\n\nThe movie is based on the life of a real Irish sailor called Patrick Watkins.\n\nThe movie was mainly shot on location in Lanzarote.\n\nThe film takes place at the beginning of the 19th century.\n\nOberlus (Everett McGill), a harpooner on a whaling ship, is regularly subjected to ridicule and abuse by other sailors.\n\nThe right half of his face is bizarrely disfigured and covered with hummocky outgrowths, which leads him to being nicknamed Iguana.\n\nOne night, after a brutal beating, Oberlus escapes to the uninhabited Hood Island.\n\nHe is soon discovered by a team led by Captain Gamboa (Fabio Testi).\n\nGamboa brutally tortures Oberlus and ties him up for further punishment, but Iguana manages to escape and hides himself in a cave.\n\nThe ship leaves the island and Gamboa orders that sailor Sebastian (Michael Madsen) be tied to a post on the coast as punishment for letting Iguana escape.\n\nOberlus finds Sebastian and proclaims himself “King of Hood Island” and Sebastian his first slave, forcing him to cook his food.\n\nDeclaring revenge upon the world, Oberlus enslaves two other sailors thrown ashore after the shipwreck.\n\nHe keeps his captives in a cave with a disguised entrance.\n\nAfter some time, a ship holding Carmen (Maru Valdivieso) and her fiancé Diego (Fernando De Huang), is moored near the island.\n\nOberlus takes them prisoner.\n\nOberlus kills Diego and makes Carmen his concubine.\n\nThe captain of the ship, assuming Carmen and Diego to have died in the storm, does not look for them, but sails away.\n\nOne day, Oberlus notices the arrival of his former whaling ship.\n\nAt night, he climbs on board, kills two sailors on the deck, takes Gamboa prisoner, and sets the ship alight, having previously locked the hull.\n\nGamboa fights Oberlus, but is killed by him.\n\nResigned to her fate, Carmen tells Oberlus that she is pregnant with his child.\n\nMonths later, the captain of the ship Carmen and Diego arrived on, returns with a group of armed sailors.\n\nThey begin their search and Oberlus has to flee to the other end of the island with pregnant Carmen and his surviving prisoners.\n\nOberlus plans to sail away with Carmen on the boat.\n\nCarmen gives birth, but Oberlus takes the child, claiming that he will allow him to suffer.\n\nWith the child in his arms, he enters the sea, intending to drown himself and the child.\n\nAlberto’s novel Garoé (the name of a sacred tree in the Canary Islands) won the 2010 Historical Novel Prize Alfonso X El Sabio, valued at €100,000.\n\nHe has also published an autobiography entitled Anaconda.\n\nHe is also a screenwriter and film director and has made such films as Oro rojo (Red Gold).\n\nAlberto currently resides between an attic apartment in the Madrid neighbourhood of Argüelles and a home on Lanzarote.\n\nI am not sure if that home is in the village of Haría in the north of the island of Lanzarote, but I suspect it might be, for Alberto once described Haría as the most beautiful village in the world.\n\nAlthough this description is a tad exaggerated, Haría really does have a pretty bucolic setting, in a palm-filled valley punctuated by splashes of brilliant colour from bougainvillea and poinsetta plants.\n\nBut we were not searching for Alberto and had we passed him on the streets we would not have recognized him.\n\nInstead we were looking for a local legend, Lanzarote’s favourite son, César Manrique.\n\nMy wife and I spent our mini-vacation tracking down buildings across the Island of Lanzarote that César designed.\n\nWe hoped to understand why this place and this man remain inseparably intertwined in the hearts and minds of those who come here and those who knew him.\n\nCésar Manrique defined Lanzarote.\n\nTo understand César Manrique is to understand Lanzarote.\n\nWe came to learn.\n\nWe began in Haría where his story ends.\n\nLanzarote, Canary Islands, Spain, Monday 3 December 2018\n\nMuch like César, our first discovery of Lanzarote was Arrecife.\n\nFor us it was the international airport north of Arrecife the day previously.\n\nOn this day we drove our rented car, from our hotel in Costa Teguise (See Canada Slim and the Royal Retreat of this blog.), past an aquapark and golf grounds, through the town of Tahiche (more on this town in a future post), through Nazaret and Teguise (See Canada Slim and the Pirates of Teguise of this blog.), through Los Valles and past a windpark to arrive at Haría.\n\n(Los Valles, a quiet agricultural hamlet between Teguise and Haría, is situated in a valley at the foot of the Famara Massif.\n\nLos Valles was founded by refugees from the village of Santa Catalina, which has been destroyed during the eruptions of 1730 – 1736 of Mount Timanfaya.\n\nThe pretty, white village church of Ermita de Santa Cantalina stands at the bottom of the valley on the side of the highway.\n\nImmediately after you pass the restored Casa de los Perazas, one of the oldest buildings on Lanzarote.\n\nThe road begins to climb steeply passing the Mirador Los Valles.)\n\nCésar Manrique Cabrera was born in Arrecife on 24 April 1919, the son of Francisca and Gumersindo Manrique.\n\nCésar’s father was a food merchant and his grandfather a notary public.\n\nCésar preceded his twin sister Ampara by just a few minutes.\n\nHe had another sister and a brother.\n\nGumersindo came from Fuerteventura and emigrated to Lanzarote.\n\nThe Manriques were a typical middle class family, without financial burdens.\n\nIn 1934, Gumersindo bought property in Caleta de Famara and built a house next to the ocean.\n\nThis house left a visible impression on César that lasted his lifetime.\n\nUte and I on our first day spent a few hours on Famara Beach and like César did we remember it with joy:\n\n“My greatest happiness is to recall a happy childhood, five-month summer vacations in Caleta and Famara Beach with its eight kilometres of clean and fine sand framed by cliffs of more than 400 metres high that reflected on the beach like a mirror.\n\nThat image has been engraved in my soul as something of extraordinary beauty that I will never forget in all of my life.”\n\nCésar would fight in the Spanish Civil War as a volunteer on dictator Franco’s side.\n\nHis experience of the War was atrocious and he refused to talk about it.\n\nIn the summer of 1939, once the War was over, César returned to Arrecife, still wearing his military uniform.\n\nAfter greeting his family, he went up on the flat roof, took off his clothes, angrily stepped over them, sprayed them with petroleum and burned them.\n\nCésar attended the University of La Laguna to study technical architecture, which he would abandon after two years.\n\nIn 1945 he moved to Madrid and studied art at the Academia de Bellas Artas de San Fernando where he graduated as a teacher of art.\n\nIn 1953, César began painting abstracts, which in Franco’s Spain was tantamount to treason, and one year later he exhibited his works alongside those of his friends Manuel Manpaso and Luis Féito.\n\nBy the late fifties César had made a name for himself in Madrid.\n\nThere followed exhibitions in major cities of Europe, Japan and America, which gave him international renown.\n\nIn the fall of 1964, following the advice of his cousin Manuel Manrique, a New York psychoanalyst and writer, César lived in New York City until 1966.\n\nHe was the guest of Waldo Diaz-Balart, a Cuban painter, who lived in the Lower East Side, at a time when this was a neighbourhood of artists, journalists and bohemians.\n\nThrough César’s cousin Manuel’s friendship with the Director of the Institute of International Education, which was sponsored by Nelson Rockefeller, a generous grant allowed César to rent his own studio and produce a number of paintings which he exhibited with success in the prestigious New York gallery of Catherine Viviano.\n\nWhile in New York, he wrote his friend Pepe Dámaso:\n\n“More than ever I feel true nostalgia for the real meaning of things.\n\nFor the pureness of the people.\n\nFor the bareness of my landscape and for my friends.\n\nMy last conclusion is that Man in New York is like a rat.\n\nMan was not created for this artificiality.\n\nThere is an imperative need to go back to the soil.\n\nFeel it.\n\nSmell it.\n\nThat’s what I feel.”\n\nIn his unpublished diary, César wrote of his homesickness for Lanzarote.\n\nAt the time he was still undecided as to where to set up his permanent studio.\n\nIn 1968, César travelled straight from New York City to Lanzarote, which he found exactly as he had left it in 1945.\n\nHe felt Lanzarote needed him.\n\nHe made himself the Island’s champion.\n\n“When I returned from New York, I came with the intention of turning my native island into one of the most beautiful places on the planet, due to the endless possibilities that Lanzarote had to offer.”\n\nThe Canarian Island was then just beginning to develop a tourism industry, but César promoted a model of sustainability in an attempt to protect Lanzarote’s natural and cultural heritage.\n\nThis Manrique model was a determining factor in Lanzarote being declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 1993.\n\nIn parallel with his commitment to the Island, César opened his creative work up to other forms of artistic expression.\n\nHe developed a new aesthetic ideology, dominated by art-nature / nature-art.\n\nHe began a dialogue of respect for the natural surroundings in which values of local traditions blended harmoniously with modern designs.\n\nWell versed in many forms of creative expression, a very real desire for integration with the surrounding natural landscape underlies César’s body of artistic work as a whole.\n\n“One of the fundamental preoccupations which has guided my artistic work has been to try to achieve harmonious integration of the forms and ideas of painting, sculpture and spaces into nature.\n\nI believe that this way, of integrating the greatest possible number of artistic elements – colour, texture, dimension, ambience, proportion – leads to a greater aesthetic enjoyment and quality of life.\n\nIt is necessary to create and act in freedom, to break with formulae and extend the concept of art to everyday human life, to create non-hostile spaces modelled on the integration of art into nature and nature into art.“\n\nThat César’s ideas were carried out on Lanzarote is all thanks to the man’s tireless energy, persistence, immense abilities and international fame.\n\nWithout César Manrique, Lanzarote would scarcely be what it is today.\n\nIt is his influence and his work that have shaped the Island.\n\nCésar shaped planning policy on the whole island and his influence can be seen everywhere.\n\nHe began with a campaign to preserve traditional building methods and a ban on roadside hoardings.\n\nHe convinced the authorities to impose a universal ban on advertising and ensure that telephone and high voltage cables were laid underground.\n\nA multifaceted artist, César turned his flair and vision to a broad range of projects, with the whole of Lanzarote becoming his canvas.\n\nCésar was a painter, sculptor, architect, ecologist, monument preserver, construction advisor, urban development planner, landscape and garden designer.\n\nCésar’s work is full of vitality, colour and light.\n\nThere is nothing gloomy in either his paintings or sculptures or in the buildings he designed.\n\nTogether with his friend from his youth, José Ramirez Cerdá, who was president of the Cabildo Insular (island government), César skillfully put his architectural projects into operation.\n\nLuis Morales, an employee of the Cabildo, was a sympathetic partner in all this.\n\nAs a practical builder, Morales had the skills to execute Manrique’s plans.\n\nAbove: Flag of Lanzarote\n\nCésar encouraged the traditional cubic form of architecture.\n\nA house is capable of growth.\n\nThe Lanzarotenos start with one or two rooms.\n\nAs a family grows, they add cubes of one or two storeys, arranged around a central courtyard and the water tank.\n\nCésar’s idea was harmony with nature and the continuation of natural processes.\n\nHe wanted to preserve Lanzarote tradition and achieve a landscape-related architecture in proportion to the natural surroundings.\n\nHe believed in a humane architecture where nature should be spared and not choked with buildings.\n\nTourism threatened to sweep away everything before it, but César’s ceaseless opposition to such unchecked urban sprawl touched a nerve with Lanzarote locals and led to the creation of an environmental group known as El Guincho, which has had some success in revealing – and at times reversing – abuses by developers.\n\nAs we drove through villages across the Island, we could see how traditional stylistic features still remain.\n\nThe standard whitewashed houses are adorned with green-painted doors, window shutters and strange onion-shaped chimney pots.\n\nThe entire Island is a testimony to César’s influence and ever-enduring spirit.\n\n“The awareness of the miracle of life and its brevity have made me see clearly that we are impoverished by the tragic sentiment of our existence.\n\nThe only important reality is the great mystery of life and of man with his inexhaustible imagination and his infinite ways of acting.\n\nWe must observe and learn from the energies of life.“\n\nThose who knew César only superficially ignored the streak of puritanism that ruled his conduct.\n\nHe was a frugal man.\n\nHe didn’t drink or smoke or allow others to smoke next to him.\n\nHe regularly went to bed very early and got up at dawn and began work in his studio very early.\n\nIn all César carried out seven major projects on the Island and numerous others elsewhere in the archipelago and beyond.\n\nAt the time of his death, he had several more in the works.\n\nIt was the buildings that my wife and I were determined to visit on our five-day sojourn on Lanzarote.\n\nWe wanted to see how César’s life-affirming architecture relates to the Lanzarote landscape.\n\nWe were confused by descriptions that suggested that César’s buildings were generous but at the same time deeply modest.\n\nGuidebooks wrote that César, with great aesthetic powers and unerring taste, had created places for the muses, of contemplation, of meditation, which radiate joy and tranquillity, places endowed with humanity.\n\nIt was written that César had striven to discover the beautiful and make it visible to everyone, but not simply beauty for beauty’s sake, but a unity of truth and intrinsic originality.\n\nWe wanted to see this for ourselves.\n\nTo speak of harmony with nature we need to speak of the landscape of Lanzarote.\n\nOn arriving in Lanzarote one feels transported in time, whisked back to the beginnings of the world, a fresh, clean world, in which the Traveller himself is the hero of discovery.\n\nHere are seas of lava, enchanted grottos, columns of steam seeping from the bowels of the planet, magnificent multicoloured stone walls, threatening volcanoes, waves that furiously smash upon tortured cliffs that loom like giants frozen for all time in their march to the sea and eternally punished for such audacity, lurking lagoons that appear suddenly among the rocks, pockets scooped from deadly lava where livelihood-sustaining vines thrive to produce unsurpassable wine, golden beaches of skin-caressing sands, transparent blue waters….\n\nAnother world, another time, a unique place.\n\nHere are peaceful, flower-bedecked whitewashed villages and a heritage of hardy people who overcame, will always overcome, the desolation that civilization commits and the fury of nature defied.\n\nFrom lava and ash, drops of dew defiantly defended have been clawed from nature’s clutches and cultivated.\n\nYet these sturdy island warriors are kind, hospitable people who shelter guests in comfort and compassion.\n\nCivilization’s constants are also found on Lanzarote, but they blend rather than blind the visitor to the natural delights of the Island.\n\nBy far the most beautiful place in the archipelago, Haíra lies within a sea of palm trees and has the charm of a small sheltered oasis.\n\nHaría is a place to relax, a Utopia where the locals set the tone.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, locals traditionally planted a palm tree to celebrate a birth (two for a boy, one for a girl), thus resulting in today’s tourist viewing a palm-filled valley upon a barren Island.\n\nHaría has many positive qualities: magnificent flora, an abundance of trees.\n\nThe mind can manage this place so peaceful, so tranquil, as the body sits comfortably under wide spreading canopies of leaves.\n\nNo one, except children in haste, runs in Haría.\n\nOne strolls here.\n\nThe soul quietly smiles at the serenity.\n\nThe central pedestrian avenue, Plaza León y Castillo, is shaded by lush leafy laurel and eucalyptus trees and cast-iron lanterns above benches where children play and seniors meet watching tourists gorge themselves at the Plaza’s open-air restaurant.\n\nThis is also the site of a superb Satuday morning craft and produce market.\n\nFrom the town hall up the street about 100 metres, the Traveller comes to the municipal arts and crafts centre, the Taller de Artesania Municipal.\n\nHandicrafts are available throughout the week at the Taller de Artesania Reinaldo Dorta Déniz (to give its full name) on Calle Barranco de Tenesia, a town hall-backed craft workshop where local artists produce macramé, silverware, ceramics, dollmaking, embroidery and some charming pieces made of palm leaves and reeds, where one can watch the crafters at work before buying.\n\nIt is open Tuesday to Sunday 1000 – 1330 and 1600 – 1900, Monday only 1000 to 1330.\n\nThe Mercado Municipal de Abastos, adjacent to the arts and crafts centre, is a small market here with a health-conscious attitude, with fruit, vegetable, meat and fish counters.\n\nThere is also a food stall here where the locals are tempted with tapas.\n\nIt is open Monday to Saturday 0900 – 1400.\n\nHaría does not boast any monuments of particular historical or architectural importance, for the history of this municipality is of little relevance.\n\nTheirs is a past marked by poverty, foreign invasions and mass emigrations.\n\nA 1587 account of the neighbourhood mentions a fountain and 100 people, a time when it was the only village on the Island besides the capital of Teguise.\n\nIn 1590, there were no more than 1,000 people on the Island, of which 250 were military, as well as 40 horses.\n\nPopulation scarcity was due to three raids carried out for 16 years by Moorish and Turkish pirates.\n\nOne of the most devasting pirate attacks was that of the troops of Morato Arráez, who, in August 1586, burned down all the palm trees.\n\nFortunately they grew back again.\n\nWhat is immediately outstanding is the good taste of the town’s buildings and the way they blend into the landscape.\n\nSome stately Andalusian-style houses date back to the 19th century when Haría at times played an important role in island politics.\n\nAt the far end of the Plaza Leon y Castillo stands the modern parish church of Our Lady of the Incarnation.\n\nThe church was built in 1619 although it has suffered numerous setbacks over time.\n\nThe most significant was the storm of 1956, which left only the tower standing.\n\nInside the church five fine lovingly-carved arches support the ceiling.\n\nIn front of the church is the La Tegala Cultural Centre, a more than 100-year-old house which has already served as a barracks, a shop and a workshop.\n\nA visit to the Diocese of the Canaries’ Museum of Popular Sacred Art in Plaza León y Castillo is recommended for the abundance of wonderful works springing from the imagination of the people of Lanzarote.\n\nAt the Plaza de la Constitución, the small square next to the Plaza Leon y Castillo, stands the classical town hall also containing the local police station.\n\nAround the corner is the beautiful city library with its rich selection of Canarian historical and cultural materials.\n\nOn the square there is a small rest area with benches, above the large cistern Aljibe which has been converted into a meeting and exhibition hall.\n\nSince the advent of tourism in the early 1980s Haría has flourished, but the tourists come not only for the celebrated beauty of the town or for the Sacred Art Museum or for the handicraft workshops, but they come to see the Casa Museo César Manrique on Calle Elvira Sanchez.\n\nBut before we remember the dead, let us honour the living while we can.\n\nBehind the Museum one can, if lucky, witness an artist at work in a garage.\n\nThat craftsman is Don Eulogio Concepción Perdomo, signposted as “Cesteria“.\n\nThis man, the only and last basket weaver on the Island, is now over 80.\n\nIn patient manual labour Perdomo makes, from the strong fronds of Canarian date palms, stable baskets of various sizes and the famous Lanzarote conical-shaped hats.\n\nWe witness him making a small fruit basket, which takes more than an hour to produce, costs about €20.\n\nI call his name and shake his hand.\n\nDoes he know of his fame?\n\nDoes he understand just how important he is?\n\nA palm-fringed property was the final home of Lanzarote’s favourite son and has been opened as a shrine to his memory.\n\nThis is a house frozen in time, complete with César’s clothes in the closet and personal art collection adorning the walls.\n\nIt is an intimate and personal view of César in his domestic surroundings.\n\nIt is a strikingly beautiful home situated in a lush palm grove in a charming village that is itself a showcase of Lanzarote’s traditional lifestyle.\n\nThis relatively new attraction of Haría, César’s last home, was opened in the summer of 2013.\n\nSurrounded by date palms and tucked away and back from the street, César’s home is a pleasure to stroll through.\n\nThe entrance fee is steep but the Museum is well laid out.\n\nRarely does one experience such harmonious living space with such a feel-good factor.\n\nWithin this spacious property, within the context of the comfortable and tasteful decor are many personal items, including painting items and incomplete works.\n\nThe living room with a large fireplace and heavy wooden ceiling, the light-flooded dining room, the bedroom with high panelled ceiling, and, as always with César, an extravagant bathroom that opens with glass fronts to the outside, César designed his home with much love, a house that was far from completion when he died.\n\nThe Casa Museo César Manrique is open every day from 1030 to 1800 (last entry 1730).\n\nIt is in Haría where César was lain to rest, when at the age of 73, still in good health and full of vitality and the joy of living, he was killed in an automobile accident on 25 September 1992, next to the present site of his Fundacion.\n\nThe irony of fate that he would meet his death in a car accident is rich as he loathed the massive amount of vehicles.\n\nAbove: Painted BMW from 1990 Art Basel exhibition, Casa Museo César Manrique, Haría, Lanzarote\n\nCésar’s final resting place in Haría’s cemetery is located at the exit to Arrieta atop a low hill.\n\nHis simple grave is located on the left in front of the small chapel.\n\nCésar’s differs fundamentally from the other graves which are made of stone slabs and crosses.\n\nHis is a flat oval bordered by lava stones under a palm tree and adorned with succulents and cacti.\n\nThe carving “C. Manrique 1919 – 92” testifies that here lies Lanzarote’s loyal son.\n\nFrom the forecourt of the cemetery there is a beautiful view of the valley below.\n\nIn retracing his life in reverse chronology, I am reminded of a text he wrote to describe himself and his view of life:\n\n“I have never followed the signs indicating the road to Utopia.\n\nUtopia, I do presently believe, is an inner path.\n\nMy enthusiasm, in any case, is the sole force that can guide me approximately.“\n\nStarting from César’s endpoint is appropriate.\n\nFor it is in Haría we view not the celebrity César, not the artist César, but the man César, a man as common as we all are, mortal and preoccupied with all the minutae that comprise a life lived daily.\n\nTo fully appreciate César’s impact on the Island one must journey out of Haría, away from a traditional Lanzarote, to a Lanzarote of the future built upon five volcanic bubbles of a lava flow 6km north of Arrecife, César’s birthplace.\n\nThe Taro de Tahíche is a dormant remnant of the 1730 eruption of the volcano Timanfaya on the northwest corner of the Island, and it is upon this that the Fundación César Manrique sits.\n\nFrom the Fundación and the overview of all that César Manrique was and did, the Traveller is encouraged to explore Lanzarote through César’s eyes and creations:\n\nthe Jameos del Agua\n\nthe Monumento al Campesino\n\nthe Restaurante El Diablo\n\nthe Mirador del Río\n\nthe Castillo San José\n\nthe Jardín de Cactus\n\nIt is at the Fundación and at the aforementioned half-dozen Manrique creations that the Traveller senses how César’s life-affirming architecture relates to the Lanzarote landscape:\n\nGenerous and yet deeply modest.\n\nWith great aesthic imagination and impeccable taste César created monuments for muses, cathedrals of contemplation, monoliths of meditation, jubilees of joy, temples of tranquillity, havens of humanity.\n\nHe sought what was beautiful and brought to this beauty his strength of purpose and crystalline originality.\n\nIn Lanzarote posts to come his creations and the Island that inspired them will be patiently revealed.\n\nI hope that you will enjoy learning of them as I shall enjoy the experience of sharing them with you.\n\nAbove: Undiscovered Planets, César Manrique\n\nSources: Wikipedia / Google / Fernando Gómez Aguilera, César Manrique in His Own Words / Wolfgang Borsich, Lanzarote and César Manrique: Seven Buildings / Lucy Corne and Josephine Quintero, Lonely Planet Canary Islands / Jorge Echenique and Andrés Murillo, Lanzarote / Eberhard Fohrer, Müller Lanzarote / Raimundo Rodriguez, Lanzarote\n\nLandschlacht, Switzerland, Tuesday 23 July 2019\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to everything.\n\nIn less than a fortnight I shall board a train to Romanshorn, followed by a ferry across the Lake of Constance (Bodensee) to Friedrichshafen then a train to Lindau, another to Kaufbeuren, another to Füssen and finally a bus to Schwangau to join my wife for a long weekend break.\n\nAbove: Schwangau\n\nThis entails taking the second earliest departing train at 05:55 from our local station and a journey of five and a half hours to be reunited with the wife on holiday for her birthday at a spa resort in the Allgäu region of Bavaria.\n\nI do not enjoy spas, wellness centres, health farms, but I do enjoy my wife’s companionship.\n\nThe things we do for love.\n\nIt is this romantic compulsion, this sweet surrender of one’s will for the beautiful harmony found with another person that makes me recall some compromises I have made for my better half on some journeys we have made together.\n\nUnlike my wife whose ambition is fixed once she has determined to do something, I rarely kick when her female perogative decides that what I planned will now not happen.\n\nI have wanted to climb the Tour Eiffel in Paris, drive to Roscommon in Ireland, and stop more often en route from Freiburg im Breisgau to Bretagne, but her jaw was set, her foot was put down, her nerve defiant.\n\nUltimately life somehow went on without the tower ascent, the Irish detour or the frequent French stops, but my childish petulence of wishes denied is still remembered.\n\nSuch pettiness a husband can harbour!\n\nThere was another such moment last year on our northern Italian vacation….\n\nHighway 45 between Gardone Riviera and Limone sul Garda, 6 August 2018\n\nBarely 3 km east of Gardone, the road passes through the twin comune of Toscolano-Maderno, which straddles the delta of the Toscolano River.\n\nToscolano is predominantly an industrial centre while Maderno is exclusively a tourist centre, stretching in a picturesque gulf with a wonderful promenade among villas and gardens and a decent beach.\n\nAbove: Toscolano – Maderno\n\nAccording to a legend, the ancient, mysterious town of Benaco, sunk into Lake Garda owing to an earthquake in 243, was built near Toscolano.\n\nA memorial tablet on the bell tower of Chiesa San Andrea (St. Andrew’s Church) in Maderno bears a dedication of the Benacensi to Marcus Aurelius.\n\nThe Orto Botanico “G.E. Ghirardi” is a botanical garden operated by the University of Milan, and located on via Religione, Toscolano-Maderno.\n\nThe garden was established in 1964 as the Stazione Agricola Sperimentale Mimosa under the direction of Professor Giordano Emilio Ghirardi.\n\nIn 1991 it became part of the University of Milan, and today primarily cultivates plants of interest for medicine and pharmaceutics, but also supports research in transgenic plants, rice, etc.\n\nCollections include Camptotheca acuminata, Eschscholzia, Nicotiana, Nigella, Scutellaria, and Solanaceae.\n\nA car ferry crosses from here to Torri del Benaco on the eastern shore of Lake Garda.\n\nThe valley behind the comune has a tradition of paper-making dating from the 4th century.\n\nFollowing the riverside road up into this beautiful, wooded valley brings the traveller past many disused paper mills to the Fondazione Valle delle Cartierie, with a well-presented museum offering an insight into the processes and importance of the industry.\n\nToscolano-Maderno is a Shangri-la for shady walks or sumptious picnics, but this day we have no time for a stroll nor food in the car for a sit-down meal.\n\nWe are on the way to Riva del Garda, our next night’s stop, the weather is sweltering and all we dream about is the AC promised at the Hotel ahead.\n\nWe left this morning after two nights in Sirmione, spent much of the day exploring Gardone Riviera and still had some distance to travel.\n\nI was complacent, quiet and uncomplaining.\n\nWe arrived at Gargnano, said to be the prettiest village on Lake Garda.\n\nTraffic ran above and inland from the town, leaving old Gargnano mostly noise-free.\n\nThe narrow difficult road north of town means tour buses don’t bother trying to reach Gargnano.\n\nIt is more workman’s base than tourist resort.\n\nAbove: Gargnano\n\nNonetheless Gargnano has a few claims to fame:\n\nThe naval operations on Lake Garda in 1866 during the Third Italian War of Independence (20 June – 12 August 1866) consisted of a series of clashes between flotillas of the Kingdom of Italy and the Austrian Empire between 25 June and 25 July that year, as they attempted to secure dominance of the lake.\n\nThe Austrian fleet, based on the eastern bank of the lake, was larger, more modern and better-armed than their Italian counterpart, and successfully maintained control of the waters, hindering the movement of Italian troops.\n\nAbove: The Austrian Steamer Hess\n\nAt the outset of the war, the border between Austria and Italy ran down the middle of the lake.\n\nThe Brescia region to the west lay within Italy while Verona and the lands east of the lake were Austrian.\n\nAustria controlled Riva del Garda at the northern tip of the lake, as well as the important fortress of Peschiera del Garda on the west bank of the River Mincio at its southern end.\n\nPeschiera was part of the so-called ‘Quadrilateral‘ of strong core Austrian defences, leaving the exposed eastern shore of Lake Garda an area of potential weakness, vulnerable to Italian infiltration.\n\nThis might have involved a strike from the north end of the Lake up the valley of the Chiese River to threaten Trento and cut off the supply lines of the Austrian forces in the Veneto.\n\nIt might also have involved a landing of forces behind Peschiera to threaten Verona.\n\nAbove: Peschiera\n\nOn the Italian side, the buildup of Austrian naval strength caused concerns about a possible Austrian attack across the lake towards Brescia.\n\nAt the start of hostilities of 25 June, the Austrians immediately sailed out to threaten Salò and prevent any movement of Italian troops.\n\nOn 30 June, the Austrian ships bombarded the railway station at Desenzano, a supply and communications point for the Italian Volunteer Corps of Giuseppe Garibaldi, but caused only minor damage.\n\nAbove: Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807 – 1882)\n\nMore substantial action took place on 2 July, at 5 am, when four Austrian gunboats, including the Hess and Franz Joseph, bombarded the centre of Gargnano, where there was a strong concentration of Garibaldi’s forces.\n\nThe bombardment caused extensive damage to homes, one dead and eight wounded among the defending volunteers of the 2nd Regiment.\n\nThe Austrian flotilla was eventually compelled to withdraw under fire from an Italian battery commanded by Captain Achille Afan de Rivera.\n\nAbove: Captain Rivera (1842 – 1904)\n\nOther skirmishes took place on the lake every few days.\n\nOn 6 July, Italian volunteers forces, equipped with nine long-range guns borrowed from a coastal battery at Maderno, ambushed the Austrian gunboat Wildfang at Gargagno.\n\nThe gunboat was hit twice, for no losses for Garibaldi’s army.\n\nAt the same time, the Italian flotilla sailed out from Salo to chase the armoured gunboat Wespe, on patrol off Maderno.\n\nThe Austrian vessel managed to disangage after receiving support from Speiteufel and Scharfschütze.\n\nItalian sources claim that the Wespe was forced to seek shelter at Malcesine.\n\nAbove: Malcesine\n\nThe next significant combat occurred on 19 July when the Italian paddle steamer Benaco head out from Salo for Gargnano towing the sailboat Poeta, both ships carrying reinforcement troops and loaded with supplies for the volunteers in the mountains of Valvestino and Tremosine.\n\nThe Benaco was suddenly attacked by two Austrian gunboats, the Wildfang and Schwarzschűtze, which forced it in to shore near Gargnano, where most of the crew, troops and supplies were landed during the night.\n\nThe next morning Austrian whalerboats were able to capture the abandoned Benaco, still with a small gun and some rifle ammunition in her holds, and tow it away as a prize to Peschiera.\n\nOne of the whalerboats capsized under Italian fire, but was eventually recovered by the Austrian flotilla.\n\nThree Austrian sailors were wounded, while heavy shelling on Gargnano killed two Italian volunteers.\n\nThe Poeta managed to sail away, only to sink shortly after off San Carlo.\n\nA second convoy from Salo, consisting in another sailboat escorted by the Italian flotilla, was forced back two days later by the Austrian gunboats Speiteufel, Uskoke and Wespe.\n\nThe Benaco was handed back to the Italian government at the end of the hostilities.\n\nAbove: Flag of the Kingdom of Italy (1861 – 1946)\n\nThe final action of the war took place at the north end of the Lake.\n\nAfter skirmishes on the Lake on 24 July, Manfroni learned that the Austrian army had abandoned Riva del Garda, which was one of his key supply points.\n\nTo prevent the town falling to Garibaldi, he steamed north and occupied the fortifications in the town with his marines, and on 25 July his forces were able to hold off Garibaldi’s volunteers until nightfall.\n\nAbove: Moritz Manfroni von Montfort (1832 – 1889)\n\nAt 10 p.m. the Hess arrived with a telegram confirming that a ceasefire had been declared between Austria and Italy.\n\nAbove: Flag of the Austrian (Habsburg) Empire (1804 – 1867)\n\nGiovanni Beatrice known as Zanzanù (1576 – 1617) was an Italian bandit of the Republic of Venice .\n\nHe was one of the most heinous bandits of the Serenissima responsible, with his band, between 1602 and 1617, of about 200 murders, according to the testimony of the bandit and assassin Alessandro Remer of Malcesine , who was hired in 1609 by a group of merchants from Desenzano del Garda to exterminate the Zannoni band.\n\nFrom the 22 sentences of bans pronounced by the Venetian magistrates against Beatrice, from 1605 to 1616, the murders clearly attributed to him did not reach 10 and those that were committed in the years 1605 – 1609 were against those who had killed his father.\n\nThis is the image that emerges from the judicial sources that testify both the numerous sentences imposed against him, and the activity of the ruthless bounty hunters aiming to obtain prizes and benefits offered by the Republic of Venice in exchange for his killing.\n\nAbove: Giovanni Beatrice (aka Zanzanù)\n\nIn fact, a more accurate examination of the same sources allows us to outline the figure of a man who became an outlaw to defend his honor and that of his family.\n\nA bandit who soon became legendary for the abuses and injustices that were committed against him.\n\nThe vicissitudes of the life of this man and the extreme complexity of the social relations within which they took place are emblematic of the transformations that affected Europe, determining the figure of the traditional bandit and of the conflicting dynamics that animated it, in that the outlaw was considered a dangerous enemy of social tranquility.\n\nGiovanni Beatrice (or Beatrici), nicknamed by the locals “Zanzanù” or “Zuan Zanone” (Giovanni Zanone), was born in Gargnano in 1576, to Giovanni Maria Beatrice of the “Zanon” family and his wife, Anastasia.\n\nHis wife Caterina had numerous children: Anastasia born in 1598, Margherita in 1599, Pietro Antonio in 1601, Anastasia in 1602, Elisabetta Antonia in 1604, Giovan Maria in 1608.\n\nHe acted with a band of accomplices, known as the “degli Zannoni“, and a dense network of connivances, even high positions, in the Riviera di Salò, territory of the Republic of Venice , and in the Upper Garda of the episcopal principality of Trento, killing, stealing and extorting anyone.\n\nIn a short time with his criminal enterprises Zanzanù became the terror of the population and the concern of the Veneto supervisors.\n\nAbove: Flag of the Republic of Venice (697 – 1797)\n\nThe first news of Beatrice dates back to 24 March 1602, when in Bogliaco, during a military parade of the “cernide“, the Venetian popular militia, of which he was a part, wounded by stabbing – with the complicity of his uncle Giovanni Francesco Beatrice called “Lima” – Francesco Sette of Maderno, the son of Riccobono, a bitter rival of his family and killed a friend of the Seven who had intervened in defense.\n\nThe two fugitive assassins were subsequently banished from all the territories of the Serenissima, but despite this they enjoyed high protection as guests of Giovanni Gaudenzio Madruzzo, captain of the Rocca of Riva del Garda and related to the prince bishop of Trento, Carlo Gaudenzio Madruzzo.\n\nAbove: Bogliaco\n\nThis first and convulsive period was marked by the killing of his father Giovan Maria, which took place in 1605 by some of his enemies.\n\nA period that he would remember for the rest of his life:\n\n“The father of I, Giovanni Zannoni of the Riviera of Salò, the ordinary son of those who descend to the lake, and from whom he derived the food of all his poor family, while he lived quietly, founded a solemn peace with a signed oath, over the sacrament of the altar, was wickedly slain by someone of the Riviera.\n\nFor this so inhumane and barbarous act, being sure of the cruelty of men, induced by desperation, I resolved to avenge such a serious offense and to secure my own life, having taken the path of arms, I avenged with the deaths of the enemy the loss of the father and the privation of the way of supporting my family, for which operations I was banished and persecution continued, I responded with new vendettas.”\n\nThe whole affair, which had as its decisive and ruthless protagonist the young Zanzanù, is in fact understandable only in the light of a harsh conflict in the years 1602 – 1605 between the Beatrice di Gargnano and the Sette families of Monte Maderno.\n\nA conflict that most likely originated from a rivalry, for reasons of honor, between the sons of Giovan Maria Beatrice and those of Riccobon Sette, a wealthy landowner of Vigole in Monte Maderno.\n\nHowever the wounding of Francesco Sette by Giovanni Beatrice did not constitute itself as the triggering element of the struggle without quarter which in the following years would see the two families facing each other.\n\nIn 1603 both Riccobon and Francesco Sette suffered the repercussions carried out by the administrator of Salò and the Venetian magistrates against their respective son and brother Giacomo.\n\nFor the protection and aid granted to Giacomo, Riccobon Sette ended up in prison in Salò, while his brother Francesco was in turn forced to leave the State.\n\nAbove: Salò\n\nThe situation precipitated at the beginning of the spring of 1603, when Giacomo Sette was killed in Armo on 14 April by his accomplice, Eliseo Baruffaldo di Val Vestino, who took his head to Salò for the ritual recognition.\n\nThese were perhaps the events that led Riccobon Sette to restore peace with the Beatrice of Gargnano.\n\nThe peace act was stipulated in August 1603 in the monastery of San Francesco di Gargnano, by Fra Tiziano Degli Antoni, a common friend of both parties.\n\nThe Beatrice were represented by Giovan Maria himself, while the archpriest of Gargnano, Bernardino Bardelli, brother-in-law of Riccobon Sette, was engaged for the opposing faction.\n\nRiccobon Sette, in fact, was still in prison, while his son Francesco was banished.\n\nHowever, the killing of the latter by some bounty hunters precipitated the situation.\n\nAbove: Monastery of San Francesco di Gargnano\n\nOn 16 June 1604 Riccobon Sette, still in prison in Salò , addressed the representatives of the Magnifica Patria, lamenting the loss of his two children and the difficult situation in which he found himself.\n\nUpon leaving prison the opposition between the two families was rekindled.\n\nThe murder of Giovan Maria Beatrice by assassins sent by the archpriest of Gargnano pushed the conflict to extremes.\n\nIn the years 1605 – 1607 Beatrice in fact carried out several coups against his adversaries and enemies, always managing to escape the numerous ambushes by the bounty hunters on his trail.\n\nIt was not so for two of his companions, Eliseo Baruffaldo and Giovan Pietro Sette. known as Pellizzaro, who in November 1606 were killed by some bounty hunters and some enemies of the Beatrice whom the Provveditore General in the Mainland, in all secrecy, had sent on their trail.\n\nThe two were killed on 11 November 1606 in a night ambush stretched over the mountains of Gargnano, and their severed heads displayed in the square of Salò.\n\nThe spiral of violence that followed the feud between the two families helped to define the image of Zanzanù, especially starting from the years 1608 -09, when he was now unable to defend himself by resorting to the ordinary ways of justice.\n\nHe was thus credited with many crimes of which he was certainly not responsible (such as robberies and thefts).\n\nHe remembered, in 1616 in a plea directed to the Council of Ten:\n\n“I confess to being guilty of many notices, but all for private crimes and none for the slightest of public and state affairs, nor with conditions excluded from the present I am not even entitled to compensate anyone, but let me be quite right in saying that, since many excesses have been committed by others under my name, of those who are out of hope of being able to free me, I have never cared to get rid of them.”\n\nOn 13 February 1609 in Tremosine, Zanzanù attacked, robbed and injured the doctor Oliviero, killed Gabriele Leonesio and stole an arquebus in a house.\n\nEscaping to Limone sul Garda, on the night of February 13, he fell in an ambush at the port of Riva del Garda, where the band led by his uncle Giovanni Francesco “Lima” was targeted by the bandit Alessandro Remer of Malcesine who intended to claim the bounty.\n\nGiovanni Beatrice was saved by jumping into the lake and swimming, while his brother Michele Zanon, Bernardo and Giovanni Battista Pace, known as “Parolotto“, of Salò were killed.\n\nGiovanni Francesco “Lima“, although wounded in the thigh, managed to take refuge in Limone sul Garda, where he was, the next day, shot and then barbarously beheaded.\n\nAbove: Limone sul Garda\n\nThe most striking action of Giovanni Beatrice took place on 29 May 1610, when he was involved, according to the accusations of the Venetian magistracy, in the murder in the Cathedral of Salò of the Brescia magistrate Bernardino Ganassoni, podestà of the place, who was attending the solemn mass in honor of Saint Herculaneum.\n\nThe murder was carried out by Antonio Bonfadino who shot point-blank, and despite the presence of the escort soldiers he managed to escape.\n\nAbove: Salò Cathedral\n\nIn the following days Beatrice tried to approach the Brescian representatives who came to Salò during the process.\n\nTo them the bandit reported that, in exchange for a pardon, he would reveal the main culprits of the killing of Ganassoni.\n\nGiovanni Beatrice’s involvement in the murder of the podestà Bernardino Ganassoni was in reality the work of the convergence of interests of administrator Giovan Battista Loredan, merchant Alberghino Alberghini and inquisitor Oltre Mincio Leonardo Mocenigo.\n\nLoredan was worried that the motives that led to the murder of the podestà would emerge, so the involvement of the feared bandit would in fact make the procedural position of Martin Previdale and the other defendants definitively unrecoverable with him and with the same mayor.\n\nThe merchant Alberghino Alberghini, present in Salò in early June 1610 , together with the band of bounty hunters led by Alessandro Remer, pursued the same goal, aiming in turn to involve the two brothers Bonifacio and Ambrogio Ceruti.\n\nArriving on the Riviera in the first days of October 1610, Leonardo Mocenigo promptly endorsed the work of Loredan condemning to the scaffold one of the false witnesses involved in the trial.\n\nAmong the mountain shelters, in the cave called “Cùel Zanzanù“, in the locality of Martelletto, near Droane, in Val Vestino, they killed and plundered, according to the report by administrator Lunardo Valier of 15 April 1606 and sent to the Senate of Venice, on 29 September 1611, the wealthy Stefano Protasio of Toscolano with ten accomplices.\n\nDespite the harsh repression carried out by Antonio Mocenigo, captain of Brescia, against banditry prevailing in the Riviera of Salò, through executions, the confiscation of property and banning from the Serenissima, Beatrice continued undaunted in his criminal exploits.\n\nBetween 1602 and 1609 the band “Zanoni” robbed the “cavallari” (travellers on the public road), assaulted boats on Lake Garda laden with goods, tyrannized the rural population, robbed the “mountains of mercy” of Manerba del Garda and Portese taking away 6,000 scudi and killed, according to estimates by bandit Alessandro Remer of Malcesine, about 200 people.\n\nAbove: Manerba del Garda\n\nHunted by the admini"
