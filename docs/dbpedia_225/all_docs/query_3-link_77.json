        "text": "This shit is pure metal. A poliziottesco film starring the always handsome Fabio Testi as an angry disgraced cop who takes the law into his own hands by recruiting a team of other rogue cops, pissed off citizens, and even criminals to take down “the racket”: local scumbags who’ve been intimidating (a very polite way of saying “raping and murdering”) local business owners into buying their protection. The gratuity of both the physical and sexual violence honestly rivals a lot of the grimier American exploitation flicks, but the emphasis is never on the horror of it all—it’s about justifying righteous murder & mayhem when faced with corrupt murder & mayhem.\n\nBullets fly, cars flip, random things explode, and cops and criminals…\n\nExplosive Poliziotteschi from Enzo G. Castellari. The Big Racket depicts pure corruption; a world under the control of violent gangs. A place where victims are too afraid to even call the police. Might is right taken to the extreme! Only Fabio Testi's righteous police inspector stands in their way. This one really delivers everything you could ever want from a film like this - gunplay, fist fights, explosions and more besides, but with a real nasty edge on top. A couple of harrowing rape scenes take things to the extreme. Castellari is clearly in his element with this one. The plot riffs on his earlier crime films such as High Crime and Street Law and he directs the hell out…\n\nI had high hopes for this Enzo G. Castellari poliziottesco joint and it somehow surpassed them within the first few minutes with an ultra-cool opening credits sequence! Fabio Testi is Police Inspector Nico Palmieri a bad ass cop who will bend every rule trying to get a gang of criminals off the streets of Milan. The gang of criminals in question will go to any length and commit horrific acts of violence to force the local businesses in paying up for protection. When one shopkeeper agrees to testify against this sadistic gang they rape his daughter, Palmieri decides to put together his own rag-tag gang of vigilantes. Some very strong characters here one of which I local sharpshooter who is…\n\nEnzo Castellari's The Big Racket is such a vicious bomb of poliziotesschi action, my expectations were royally stomped. Quite possibly one of the best Euro-crime Bangers I've ever seen!\n\nFabio Testi is a bad-ass cop trying to stop a ruthless crime ring from taking over Milan. This organized filth unit runs a racket of vandalizing businesses and then forcing them to pay up for \"protection\" or else a further hellstorm of sadistic violence will rain down on them.\n\nCastellari fleshes this gritty crime-ripper out with some startling twists as the plot hurdles in unpredictable directions, adding nuanced characters into the fold and giving the narrative some serious heft in the process. It's a daring beast of a story that's foaming…\n\nThere are no unmitigated surprises in this Enzo G. Castellari directed and co-written poliziottesco, but his professional approach in delivering first-grade violent action based entertainment upgrades The Big Racket from the general entries of the genre.\n\nIt's unquestionably an incredible sordid and angrily nihilistic film as Fabio Testi as Inspector Nico Palmieri finds himself combatting a sadistic gang of criminals terrorising the Italian capital. The dialogue certainly is not of the highest quality; nevertheless, there's undeniable fun when Palmieri finally takes matters into his own hands after his continual frustrations of trying to operate within a corrupt legal framework.\n\nPalmieri’s gathering of a ragtag squad and the ensuing confrontation as they set about dealing with them in vigilante fashion united…\n\n“There are things you don’t do with sirens blazing.”\n\nThe kids are not alright. They’re trashing stores, blowing up vans and then exhorting the shopkeepers into paying for protection. Nicola (Fabio Testi) tries to stop them but has his car rolled off a cliff for his trouble. The other problem is that the harder Nicola tries to stop the increasingly bold band of lowlifes and suited-up crime lords, the more people get killed. A skeet shooting champion’s wife, a store owner’s daughter, a gung-ho kid. When he’s finally fired by the corrupt police department for digging too deep (and having too many shootouts), he gathers a troop of castaways and cutouts for one last stand against the brutal racketeers. So…\n\nThe Years of Lead – Book Out Now!\n\n\"Nothing's sacred any longer with these delinquents running around!\"\n\nSocietal Despair: Frustration with the futility of trying to do good in an evil world\n\nFabio Testi is a police inspector in an Italian city being terrorized by an extortion racket. Residents are struggling just to get by already without the added worry of paying protection money to the very people they need protection from. Fabio wants to help, wants to shut down the whole crime ring, not just arrest some petty gangsters doing the mafia's dirty work, but he feels held back by the limitations of the methods permissible for the police. Legal resistance just isn't good enough, so he keeps pushing…\n\nFabio Testi fights organized crime and limp dick bureaucracy while rocking turtle necks and wool pea coats in this stylish hard hitting film by Enzo Castellari. The first 5 minutes are of slow motion awesomeness. The last 10 are ultra satisfying violence. Everything in the middle is a hard boiled, brutal, \"fuck you\" to decency, scored to the psych-rock sounds of Guido and Maurizio de Angelis.\n\nWhat do I mean by brutal? Let me tell you a little anecdote.... (spoilers)\n\nAround the 3/4 mark Testi and his police force have the main gang surrounded and are ready for battle but they don't know that the baddies have them surrounded as well. A massive gun battle ensues and my wife, Laila,…"
