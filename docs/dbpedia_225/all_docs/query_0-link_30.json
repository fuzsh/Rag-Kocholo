This information, if complete and accurate, not only facilitates the planning of military operations but enables commanders in the field to judge the enemy’s local capabilities and to make their decisions accordingly. The purpose of this text is to furnish intelligence officers with a detailed picture of the basic composition and disposition of the Italian Army. The first part, comprising sections I to IV, is for general orientation on the structure of the Army and its high command, the types of units and their organization, and the other Italian militarized and auxiliary formations. The second part, consisting of sections V to VII, is the Order of Battle proper, giving specific data on the names, numbers, composition, location, and commanders of all identified units of the Italian Army. This latter type of information is of course constantly changing, and it is therefore intended to issue sectional or complete revisions of the book at suitable intervals. More details on the basic organization of uliits, means of identi- fication, symbols, and abbreviations will bo found in the forth- coming Technical Manual on the Italian Armed Forces and the MIS Special Series publication on Italian military abbreviations, signs, and symbols. All intelligence personnel concerned with the Italian Army should become thoroughly familiar with the contents and arrange- tfteiit of this book so that they can perform their duties more intelligently and can use the great mass of factual data given here as quickly and efficiently _asj)ossible. m Approved For Release 2004/04/15 : CIA-RDP83- 0041 5R01 2400260003^ D003^2 Approved For Release 2004/04/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R01 2400260003-2 ™ FOREWORD It will be seen that the information on many points is frag- mentary or doubtful.

ITALIAN HIGH COMMAND 1. Introduction. Within certain limitations due to differences in political organi- zation of the two countries, the Italian military system is very similar to the German. It is obvious that the interrelation of the Armed Forces of the Axis Powers has been in effect for some time, at least sufficiently to have permitted the modeling of various principles of organization of the one upon those of the other. The Armed Forces (Forzo Armate) of the Italian state are re- garded as a single service and comprise the following branches: the Royal Army (Regio Esercito), the Royal Navy (Regia Ma- rina), the Royal Air Force (Regia Aeronautical , the Royal Customs Guards (Regia Guardia di Finanza), and the Fascist Militia (Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurczza Nazionalc — MVSN) or Blackshirts (Camicie Nere — CCNN). 2. Supreme Command of the Armed Forces. The King is the Supremo Commander of all armed forces (Comandante Supremo delle Forze Armate dello Stato). In time of peace he delegates his powers to the Ministers of War, Navy, and Air; in time of war a Supreme Commander is appointed by Royal Decree with the approval of the Council of Ministers. Hitherto MUSSOLINI, as Head of the Stato and Minister of War, Navy, and Air, could determine the selection of the Supreme Commander and exercise direct control over the. Armed Forces both in peace and in war. In addition MUSSOLINI was Chairman of the Supreme Commission of Defense (Commissione Suprema di Difesa), an inter-ministerial and Armed Forces council re- sponsible for the coordination of all policies and practices of total 1 Approved For Release 2004/04/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R012400260003-: Approved For Release 2004/04/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R01 2400260003-2 2 ORDER OF BATTLE OF THE ITALIAN ARMY war. Its membership comprises the highest officials of the State and the ranking members of the Armed Forces, The Supreme. Commander appointed bears the. title of Chief of the Supreme General Staff (Cupo di Stato Muggiore Generate) and is selected from the ranking officers of any branch of the Armed Forces. Theoretically, he was the technical adviser of MUSSOLINI in all matters concerning t lie coordination of de- fense and the conduct of land, sea, and air operations. In the exercise of his functions he works in conjunction with the Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Forces. To facilitate tills coordination, he has his own staff (Stato Maggiore Gcnerale), which functions as liaison between himself and the various sendees through the respective ministries and general staffs, 3.

Selected from the general officers of the Aimy, lie is appointed bv lioyal Decree on approval of the Council of Ministers. lie serves under the Chief of the Supreme General Staff and functions as technical adviser to the Minister of War in time of peace. In time of war ho exercises his appointed functions at the headquarters of the armies in tho field. He communicates directly with army and field commanders, com- manders of corps areas, and inspectors of the various arms and sendees. He is assisted by the Deputy Chief of Staff (Sottocapo di Stato Maggiore). Tho Army General Staff consists of three sections, each ad- ministered by an Assistant Chief of Staff appointed by Royal Decree: (1) Operations (Sottocapo di Stato Maggiore per lo Opernzioni), which supervises territorial and colonial operations, training, records, and intelligence; (2) Administration (Sottocapo di Stato Maggiore Intcndente), which supervises organization, mobilization, transportation, and services; and (3) Territorial Defense (Sottocapo di Stato Maggiore per la Difesa Terri toriolc), which is responsible for all defense, including coast defense as far t RESTRICTED Approved For Release 2004/04/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R01 2400260003-2 Approved For Release 2004/04/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R01 2400260003-2 Approved For Release 2004/04/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R01 2400260003-2 ITALIAN HIGH COMMAND Approved For Release 2004/04/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R01 2400260003-2 4 ORDER OF BATTLE OF THE ITALIAN ARMY as concerns the Army but excluding frontier defense.

Corps (Corpo di State Maggiore) and the General St tiff Service (Servizio di Stato Maggiore). Tho head of the General Staff Corps is tho Chief of the Army General Staff. After n three-year course at the Staff College and upon recommendation of a board from the General Staff Corps, officers selected for the Army General Staff are reassigned for one year to the headquarters of a line unit. On successful completion of this assignment, l her are posted to the General Staff Service and servo as heads of the various staff departments of a unit headquarters, assisted by attached and complementary officers who may be temporarily employed. On promotion, an officer must serve with a unit of his own arm for two yearn, after which lie is again as- signed to the General Staff Seivice. On promotion to u rank equivalent to that of Lieutenant Colonel, and subject to having fulfilled his duties satisfactorily, an officer is transferred to the General Staff Corps. There are normally 48 Colonels and 178 Lieutenant Colonels in the Corps, while the number of officer's in the Service is unlimited. All chiefs of staffs in liigher forma- tions are members of the General Staff Corps. Since these officers remain in close collaboration witli the parent hotly, tho Chief of the Army General St a If (and through him the Clrief of the Supreme General Staff) is kept in very close touch with the daily conduct of the war. 4.

BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE ITALIAN ARMY 5. Introduction. For practical reasons— in order to facilitate mobilization, pre- pare the nation for total war, and especially to free field unit commanders from territorial and administrative responsibilities— the Itnlian Army is divided into Field Units ( vnitd di campagna ) and Territorial Units (enti trrntonaU). The Field Army is under the direct control of the Chief of the Army Staff and his staff at field headquarters, who devote themselves primarily to military operations. All other matters are entrusted to the Under Secre- tary of Vt ar (usually a high ranking army officer) and the Assistant Chief of Staff for Territorial Defense. A permanent home struc- ture is set. up in peace time and carries over, with accelerated and more extensive functions, in time of war. 6. Regional Organization. Army Commands are represented in peace time by tlie Army Generals designated to command armies in time of war ( Generali designali d’Armata). These commanders are responsible under the Minister of War and the Chief of the Army Stuff for all military administration and preparations for war in the areas allotted to them. In time of war, they may he given effective command of an army. The rank of Army General Designate continues to exist in time of war. Army Corps Areas were responsible in peace time for all troops, services, headquarters and other military establishments within the Corps Area. The headquarters of tlie Corps were stationed within definite areas which were also designated Territorial De- fense Commands (Comando di Difexa Territvriale) . There wero 16 of them at tlie outbreak of war, as follows: 9 Approved For Release 2004/04/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R01 2400260003-2 Approved For Release 2004/04/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R0124Q0260003-2 BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE ITALIAN ARMY 7 I Torino IX Bari II Alessandria X Napoli III Milano XI Udine IV Bolzano XII Palermo V Trieste XIII Cagliari VI Bologna XIV Treviso VII Firenze XV Genova VIII Roma XVI (unknown) They are numbered concurrently with the Corps whose head- quarters and components they contained in peace time. There were in addition corps headquarters for four independent corps — Armored at Mantova, Alpine at Trento, Cavalry ( Celere ) at Padova, and Semi-Motorized at Cremona- — which were in effect staffs to control the training and organization of the specialized units. They did not have a corresponding Territorial Defense Command. Since the Commander of the Corps Area would on mobilization depart with his corps -to join the Field Army, his main concern was the training and equipment of the corps in preparation for war. All administrative matters were assigned to a deputy, nor- mally a Reserve Officer unsuited for active field service but quali- fied by seniority and experience for the post. Each Territorial Defense Command thus became responsible in time of war for the continued provision of trained manpower and administrative services for the corps which had originally come from that area and for those subsequently organized in it. In addition, due to the particularly exposed situation of the Italian peninsula, each was made responsible for local antiaircraft, coastal, antigas, rail- road, and other defenses. These Corps Areas were originally divided into varying numbers of Military Zones, of which thero were twenty-eight in all, corresponding to the number of divi- sions of the conscript army. These were in turn subdivided into Military Districts (Distretti Militari) .

Training begins at an early age and carries through most of the Italian’s life. Training in youth organizations is under the control of tho GiovontCt Italiana del Littorio (GIL) and is divided into, the following subdivisions: Figli della Lupa from birth to 8 years of age Balilla from 8 to 14 years of age Avanguardisti from 14 to 16 years of age Giovani Fascisti from 16 to 18 years of age Premilitari from 18 to 21 years of age The Balilla and tho Avanguardisti are given the first rudiments of military instruction and are organized on the basis of the ancient Roman legionary system. .Compulsory military training begins at the age of 18, when youths are subjected to intensive preparatory courses and exercises for their future conscript service. During this period, youths are selected for eventual enrollment in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the various specialist and NCO schools. Instruction is carried out under the direction of the GIL and is imparted during specified periods by officers of the Fascist Militia, Reserve Officers, and NCOs. Actual control of youths for military purposes begins at the age of 1 1 when a Libretto personale is issued, in which is kept an exact record of the individual’s physical, political, and military history. At the age of 18 his name is posted on a draft list ( lista di leva ) and he is assigned for premilitary training to a unit of the GIL.

Except in particular eases, the normal period of service in peace time was for 18 months, from April of the year following that in which the twentieth birthday fell to October of the next year. Postmilitary training was compulsory until the age of 32 and reserves were periodically recalled to the colors for refresher courses, particularly in the cases of specialists and NCOs, At present, nearly all able-bodied men between tiro ages of 20 and 30 arc serving in the Armed Forces, with premilitary and post- military service under direct control of the Armed Forces on a war -basis within the organizations for territorial defense. Noncommissioned officers of the rank of sergeant and above ( sottvjficiali ) are volunteer long-service professional soldiers.

Regular Officers ( Ufficiali in Scrvizio Permanent e Effeliivo): drawn from the Military Academics at Turin and Modena, with additional training at service schools. Additional officers are drawn from among Reserve Officers and exceptionally qualified senior NCOs. b. Reserve Officers ( Ufficiali di Complement <>): Youths who attain a certain standard of education are compelled by law to carry out their conscript service as Reserve Officers. They form the main source for junior officers on* mobilization. After seven months of intensive instruction at special service schools, the re- mainder of their conscript service is performed with units of the line. Reserve Officers are subject to a certain amount of com- pulsory training in the field and are used as instructors in pre- military and postmilitary training.

Replacement Training System. The organization in the Italian Army for the production of new units and for the supply of replacements is very similar to the German Ersatz system. Every unit of the Field Army is rein- forced as necessary from the depot of the unit in Italy.’ The rate of forming reserve units depends on circumstances and is fairly elastic. Normally, the unit of first line reserves is one degree smaller than the field, unit which it serves; each infantry or artillery regiment usually ha„s a reserve battalion. When a division is engaged in active operations, the process is speeded up and second line formations equal to the field units are formed. In such cases, the second-line units a, re temporarily termed “bis” (duplicate) units and may bear the same number as the first-line unit. Certain types of units — Alpini, motorized infantry and artillery, and tank units — continuously form reserve formations, limited only by the need for special training and the ability to equip them. The numbering of replacement units or new formations does not follow a- rigid scheme. Normally, reserve units take numbers in the series already existing for their type of unit within the larger formation to which they arc attached. For instance, an infantry replacement company might be numbered 13, when there are already 12 first line companies in the regiment. In addition, it might be attached to a battalion of the normal regiment and thus be called the 13th Company, 4th Battalion of the parent regiment. When four companies have been formed (13, 14, 15, 16), they may become a reserve ( complemenio ) battalion of the regiment and take on the number of the regiment, while the companies them- selves may be renumbered 1, 2, 3, 4. Thus, the 13tli Co., 4th Bn, 27th Regt, may become as a reserve unit the 1st Co, 27th Bn, serving the 27th Regt. Confusion may easily arise in the case where the renumbered company docs not associate itself with the reserve battalion, but directly with the parent formation: the 3d Co, 27th Regt may be either a regular component of the 1st RESTRICTED Approved For Release 2004/04/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R01 2400260003-2 / J Approved For Release 2004/04/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R01 2400260003-2 ]2 0Rl>Elt OK BATTLE OK THE ITALIANS' ARMY Bn in tin; field or tlio reserve, unit in the 27th Bn at the training depot. In addition, oilier reserve battalions attached to the same division may carry the divisional number. The composition of reserve battulions often varies from the normal organization. Thus the 27lh Bn may include rifle, MG, and antitank companies, since it may be serving as a reserve unit for the various types of units in the regiment. These reserve units arc intended as depots for personnel rather than for weapons and have only a skeleton armament. It would therefore be exceptional to find them in an operational role. However, it may be assumed that reserve units which have been renum- bered and formed into independent units, or which are being grouped with other units to form a new division, will be fully equipped with weapons. With minor variations, the same system of replacement units applies to nil combat units of corps and armies as well as to divisions. Although usually adhered to, it is not rigidly followed under exceptional circumstances. If a division in tiie field engaged in combat has absorbed all replacement personnel from its own depot, replacements will be sent from depots of other units. It may likewise absorb independent and fully formed new units. This lends to confusing identifications in the field through the personnel of these units continuing to wear the gorget patches (mostriv#) of their parent formations. Particular situations obtained in Russia and during the African campaigns. In Russia the German system of march battalions was adopted with certain modifications. A unit of infantry replacements bore the number of the regiment to which it was going and, when sufficiently large in numbers, it was organized into a march regiment, bearing the number of the division. Thus, the 3d Heggimento di marcia, including the 37th Battaglione di marcia, served as n replacement unit for the 37th and 38th In- fantry Regiments of the 3d RAVENNA Division. In the same way, the Alpine Divisions were served by march regiments RESTRICTED Approved For Release 2004/04/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R01 2400260003-2 Approved For Release 2004/04/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R01 2400260003-2 BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE ITALIAN ARMY 13 numbered 102, 103, 104, corresponding to the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Alpine Divisions, with the march battalions numbered the same as the particular regiments they were feeding. In the case of Bersaglieri regiments, the principle of numeration is not clear. The only replacement unit identified was the 120th Roggimonto Bersaglieri di marcia, with three march battalions, and was presumably destined to reinforce the 3d and 6th Bersaglieri Regiments of the 3d Cavalry Division. In Africa, due to the pressure of the situation, complete units wore sent over which were either incorporated in tlioir entirety into already existing regiments or were split up by companies among several existing battalions. In general, the regular system of numbering was fol- lowed, but there were several cases in which the march bat- talions had no number. It should be kept in mind that march battalions do not necessarily feed the regiment at whose depot they were formed and whose number they bear. In general, it may be said that reinforcements of other, arms are also called reggimento di marcia, that they have numbers from 100 upwards, and that rarely can a connection bo observed be- tween the number of such a unit and the field unit for which it may be destined, although the march unit may boar the number of the unit at whoso depot it was formed. There was one case of a Divisione di marcia, the 8th, consisting of personnel of all arms going as replacements to the Eighth Army in Russia.

Introduction Organization of units in the Italian Army is remarkably fluid and clastic. Tables of Organization are rarely followed in prac- tice and arc often frankly abandoned in favor of substitute formations loosely called raygruppamenli, a term applied to collections of homogeneous units as well as to combat teams or task forces of a more self-contained nature with components of the various amis and services. 10. Numbering of Units. All Italian divisions except coastal divisions bear both a name and a number, either of which may be used alone in referring to that unit. Infantry divisions of all types arc numbered in a continuous series, from 1 to 65, excluding 8, 34, 35, 39, 40, 43, 45, and 40; 101 to 105; and 151 to 159. The SI’EZIA Air-Borne Division was numbered 80 and the parachute divisions, 184 and 185. Numbers 131 through 134 were allotted to armored divisions, while 130 was also originally intended to be armored. Cavalry divisions were numbered 1, 2, and 3; Alpine divisions 1 through 0; and coastal divisions in the 200 series through 220. \"When no calls are being made for replacements on a division depot and trained infantry and artillery personnel have been formed into second-line regiments, a new division may be formed. The two infantry regiments assume the name and numbers of the regiments of one of the disbanded World War brigades. The. artillery regiment is allotted a new number in the regular series and this number is taken for the whole division. In this way, reserves at the depots of the 43d and 44th Infantry Regiments were expanded into two regiments (the 121st and 122d) and formed the MACERATA Brigade. At the same time the reserves at 14 Approved For Release 2004/04/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R01 2400260003-2 Approved For Release 2004/04/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R01 2400260003-2 ORGANIZATION\" OF UNITS 15 the 36th Artillery Regiment depot were formed into the 153d Artillery Regiment. The combination of the new units with appropriate divisional troops became the new 153d M ACER AT A Division. a. Infantry regiments, with the exception of Alpini and terri- torial defense units, are numbered in one continuous series up to 94, after which the numbering becomes erratic. They are arranged in pairs in divisions: the 1st and 2d RE Regiments are in the 13th RE Division. However, many infantry regiments and all cavalry regiments have names different from that of the division. There are 66 regiments with numbers between 100 and 383, of which 12 are the extra regiments of triangidar divisions. Such extra regiments are in the 300 series; they have a number whose last two digits are the same as one of the original divisional regiments. For example, the 29th PIEMONTE Division has the 3d, 4th and 303d Infantry Regiments. Five nondivisional regiments have been identified: the 100th, 101st, 102d, 202d, and 265th. Within the regiments, battalions arc numbered from 1 to 3 and companies from 1 to 12 consecutively. Complement or reserve battalions bear the same number as the regiment which they supply. The three Sardinian Grenadier Regiments (GRANATIERI DI SARDEGNA) are numbered from 1 to 3. The two Savoyan Grenadier Regiments (GRANATIERI DI SAVOIA), destroyed in Italian East Africa, were numbered 10 and 11. b. Alpini regiments, although numbered in sequence from 1 to 11, are not grouped in sequence when forming part of a division. There is no 10th Regiment, this number being reserved for an association of former Alpini 'officers and men. Alpini battalions have names but no numbers. The complement or reserve bat- talions of the regiments have names which usually start with the prefix VAL or MONTE. Alpini companies are numbered con- secutively in one series throughout the ten regiments. Those in fiormal battalions are numbered up to 79; in MONTE battalions RESTRICTED Approved For Release 2004/04/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R01 2400260003-2 Approved For Release 2004/04/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R01 2400260003-2 16 0HUI.I1 OF BATTLE OF THE ITALIAN ARMY between SO and 200; in VAL battalions from 200 upwards. They are frequently, but not invariably, numbered in sequence within a battalion. For example, the 1VKEA Alpine Battalion has companies 38, 39, and 40; the VAL CAMON1CA has 250, 251, and 252; but 1NTKA has 7, 24, and 27, while MONTE ROSA has 112, 134, and 135. e. BermglierL are normally picked troops of high quality. There were originally Lwleve infantry regiments, numbered from 1 to 12, and an armored car regiment, the 18th. Two regiments, the 30th and the 120th, were actually replacement units. Battalions have distinctive numbers, which hear no relation to the regiment to which they belong, but companies arc numbered consecutively throughout the regiment. d. Artillery regiment# usually beur the same, number as the formation to which they were originally allotted, but there are many exceptions. The original five army artillery regiments, numbered from 1 to 5, were not assigned to armies of the same number, in fact, mmy artillery raggnippnmenti were formed from them to reinforce armies in active operations, but even in these cases the numbers of the two units did not correspond, since the number of the raggruppamento was allotted in keeping with their particular numbering progression. In the case of corps artillery regiments, new forma lions were made by adding a zero to the number of the parent regiment. The latter is usually the same ns that of the corps. The battalions of the army and corps artillery regiments are distinctively numbered, but in an elastic and variable maimer, occasionally showing a semblance of system as in the 5th Corps Artillery Regiment with the 12th, 20th, 112th, and 120th Battalions. The highest known number of regular divisional artillery is 205. Although the battalions and batteries usually follow a regular progressive system of numbering within the higher unit, battalions numbered as high as 75 and batteries as high as 150 have been found. Other artillery units are numbered in separate scries.

Autonomous battalions attached to corps have numbers between 200 and 300. Self-propelled armored artillery battalions are in the 550 and 560 series. Some heavy self-propelled antitank battalions have been identified in the 160 scries. Organic antitank battalions arc usually numbered the same as the division but are often attached to other divisions. Antitank companies, both organic and autonomous, are consecutively numbered, the highest found being 355. e. Cavalry regiments bear names and numbers, the latter in a regular sequence. There arc two independent groups, the C A VALLE GGERI DI SICILIA and the CAVALLEGGERI DI SARDEGNA, and throe light tank groups, named SAN GIUSTO, SAN MARCO, and SAN MARTINO. The battalions of cavalry regiments arc numbered in two continuous series through- out all the regiments. The 1 to 20 series was originally intended for mounted battalions, and the 51 to 60 for dismounted battalions. With few exceptions, cavalry battalions are now all dismounted and are either autonomous or attached to other formations. /. Armored divisions are numbered in the 130 series. The tank regiments of these divisions bear the same number as the division, with a complement regiment at the regimental depot bearing a number 100 lower. For instance, the 132d ARIETE Division had as first-line the 132d Tank. Regiment and. at its depot the 32d. In the case of the 131st CENTAURO, the 131st Tank Regiment was detached to Sicily in command of the tank battalions on the. island,, while the 31st Tank Regiment went with the division .The 1st, 3d, and 4tli Tank Regiments are simply training and administrative depots. Medium battalions wore numbered in a continuous series from 8 to 20. The four R35 battalions were numbered 1, 2, 101, and 102. Light battalions are numbered in sequence within each regiment from 1 upwards. Companies are numbered in sequence within each battalion. g. Engineer units follow no regular system.

Corps engineer regi- ments invariably bear the same number as the corps to which they belong, but the numbering of their battalions is variable. Mixed engineer battalions attached to divisions usually bear the division number or a number related to it. Their components, particu- larly the pioneer company, often have the divisional number. Signal companies assume independent numbering in series up to and over 100. h. The two parachute divisions were the 184 th NEMBO, with the 184tli and 185th Regiments, and the 185th FOLGORE, with the 18Gth and 187th Regiments. i. Coastal divisions have only numbers, all in the 200 series, the highest identified being the 226th. Coastal regiments arc numbered between 1 and 178, and battalions as high as 581, with no correspondence between the two series. Coast artillery bat- talions have been found numbered as high as 600, but the greatest percentage fall between 125 and 225. j. Smaller organic units, including mortar and machine gun battalions, usually bear the same number as the division to which they were originally assigned. However, due to the fluid condi- tion of Italian organization and the frequent reinforcement of higher formations by attachment of units, it is hardly ever pos- sible to locate the position of a division in an area by the identi- fication of only one of its components. Particular care must be exercised against locating the actual position of a division by the identification of its reserve units. 11. Army Group ( Gruppo d’Armate) and Army (Armata). , In peace, army groups and armies, with the exception of the Army of the Po, are represented only by the headquarters of the Army Generals designated to command them in war.

In North Africa the raggruppamento was the corps artillery pool; in the case of some corps in the Balkans and Russia the raggruppa- mento appears to include all the corps artillery in the field, the parent regiment existing only at the depot in Italy; in other cases the raggruppamento has been detached from its corps and sent to a different theater. There are also a number of raggruppamenti which have no corresponding corps artillery regiment. 13. Divisions. a. Ordinary Infantry Division. These are called binary (divisions binaria ) owing to the incor- poration of two infantry regiments instead of the old three regi- ment (ternaria) organization. As from 1 March 1940 a Black- shirt Militia Legion of two battalions was attached to infantry divisions, partly, it is believed, to increase the amount of infantry in the division and partly to include Blackshirt troops with regular army formations. The Legion is, however, described as an inde- pendent mobile unit to be used as shock ( assalto ) troops. During the Albanian campaign the weakness of the binary division be- came evident. Divisions which had suffered heavy losses had to be reformed with whatever infantry was available or even by merging with another division. Now that infantry divisions in the Balkans have been brought up to strength, some have been given a third infantry regiment. It is not yet clear whether thfs is a reserve or whether it means a change in establishment. The following is the normal organization of the ordinary in- fantry division: Headquarters Two Inf Regts 541791—43 3 RESTRICTED Approved For Release 2004/04/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R01 2400260003-2 Approved For Release 2004/04/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R01 2400260003-2 26 ORDER OF BATTLE OF THE ITALIAN ARMY Arty Regt AT Co Mortar Bn (81 mm) Pioneer Co Tg and Ilad Co Med Co Supply and MT Cos Militia Legion The normal strength of the division is approximately 12,500 including some 1,350 Blackshirts. b. Assault and Landing Division ( divisione da sbarco e d’assalto). A new form of organization adopted in 1941 and believed to have affected only three divisions, the 1st SU PERGA, 4th LIVORNO, and 20th FRIULI. Of these the 1st SUPERGA was destroyed in Tunisia. This unit had undergone training in combined operations at Leghorn fthe Italian combined opera- tions center) and Gaeta and in mountain warfare at Castelforte. For these special tasks, certain specialized units such as assault engineers, rock-climbers, and flame-throwers were incorporated into the division. To fit smaller units for independent operations heavy support weapons in the infantry regiment are decentralized from regi- mental to battalion control and light support weapons from bat- talion to company control. c. Semi-Motorized Infantry Division ( divisione janteria auto- traspariabilc). This division differs from ordinary infantry divisions in that it may have motorized artillery, no Blackshirt Legion, and two mortar battalions iii the field if not on table of organization.

Three, the 16th PISTOIA, 101st TRENTO, and 102d TRIESTE, were destroyed in Africa in 1942 and 1943. The 10th PIAVE in. Italy, the only remaining motorized division, does not appear to possess a Borsaglicri Regiment. e. Mountain Infantry Division (divisions di fanteria da mon- tagna) . . Mountain divisions differ from Alpini divisions and are infantry divisions especially adapted for operations in mountainous countries where full use cannot ho made of horse-diawn artillory and motor transport. The only difference in the organization of a mountain division as compared with an ordinary infantry division is in the artillery regiment. All guns can bo transported in horse- drawn wagon-loads or on pack animals. The artillery regiment consists of: Headquarters Two 75/13 howitzer battalions (pack) 75/13 howitzer battalion (horse-drawn in loads) Strength: 2,791 men. MT: 142. Animals: 910 f. Alpine Division ( divisione alpina). Essentially mountain divisions with personnel drawn from Alpine regions. Alpine regiments are self-contained with de- tachments of artillery, engineers, and auxiliary services per- manently attached. This makes the regiment self-supporting and capable, of independent action for a considerable period. Decentralization is further extended to Alpine battalions and companies which may be detached from their parent units and regrouped with artillery units into raggruppamenti. This is facilitated by the existence of independent transport even down to company level.

The mam components arc two horsed cavalry regiments and one cyclist Bersaglieri regiment. The cavalry regiments are virtually mounted infantry. The Bersaglieri regiment has col- lapsible bicycles and could be semi-motorized if necessary. The artillery regiment has two motorized batteries and one pack battery, and the division includes a support group of light tank squadrons. This semi-mechanized division was designed pri- marily for warfare in terrain which, though mountainous, permits use of semi-mechanized formations in a reconnaissance or support role. Fire-power has been sacrificed to this end and it is not designed for defense. There are indications thut efforts have been made to mechanize the divisions completely; but this has been hindered by shortage of trained personnel and equipment and by demands being made on the divisions. Their motorized artillery batteries went to Libya. One division was sent to Russia with a re-formed horse- artillery regiment; and was later reinforced by a reserve motorized artillery regiment. A. Armored Division ( divisions corazzata). The armored division as designed before the war with a mixture of light and medium tanks, none heavier than 11 tons and the majority and 5 tons, was incapable of more than light assault. Armored divisions have changed radically in composition under German influence with an improved type of medium tank, the introduction of self-propelled (semovente) guns, and heavier divisional support weapons. In addition to a tank regiment of at least three battalions the division now has a semi-motorized Bersaglieri regiment, a divi- sional artillery regiment of six battalions (two self-propelled), and probably an armored car unit.

Parachute Division. There have been only two Italian parachute divisions. The three original parachute regiments were formed into a division, probably mainly for purposes of administration. The 185th FOLGORE was destroyed in Africa where it had been operating; as ordinary infantry. The 184th NEMBO is now being trained in Italy, with an organization probably according to the original plan, as follows: Headquarters Two parachute regiments Parachute artillery regiment (47 mm AT guns) Parachute motorcycle company Parachute mortar company (81 mm) Parachute mixed engineer company Services j. Coastal Division. Coastal divisions, which at first appeared to be merely adminis- trative collections of coastal and territorial battalions for coast and home defense, have now assumed a more definite organization.

(2) Infantry regiment v issault and Landing Division. Has no 81 mm mortar and 47 mm AT companies. These weapons have been decentralized to battalion support companies, while the lighter weapons in turn have been assigned to the rifle companies. Thus both battalions and companies are better equipped for independent operations. (3) Grenadier regiment ( reggimento granathri). Only the three Sardinian Grenadier regiments, numbered from one to three, remain. The two Savoy Grenadier regiments stationed in Italian East Africa, numbered ten and eleven, have been destroyed. A grenadier regiment has the same organization as an ordinary infantry regiment. (4) Se ini -motorized division infantry regiment.

(7) Alpine regiment. May contain two, three, or four battalions, though three is the normal number. The battalion is the highest Alpine unit which has a fixed organization. In addition to its first-line units each regiment has formed at its depot a number of second-line battalions which may be distinguished by the fact that their names always begin with VAL or MONTE.

Armored Units . (1) Tank infantry regiment (reggimento fanteria carrista). One tank regiment, composed of from three to five tank battal- ions, was normally assigned to each armored division. The tank regiments of Italy’s three armored divisions, the 31st, 132d and 133d Regiments, were destroyed in Africa. The J31st Tank Regiment, formerly the depot regiment of the 131st CENTAURO Division and equipped with French tanks (R 3b), was separated from the division and sent to Sicily. The 32d and 33d Tank Regiments (depot) served ns holding depots for the reserve and training battalions of their first-lino divisional regiments. The 1st, 3d, and 4th Tank Regiments exist as training depots and as depots for forming new' battalions. (2) Tank infantry battalion (battaglione fanteria carrista). Three to five battalions assigned to each tank regiment. (3) Light tank groups.

OTHER MILITARIZED AND AUXILIARY ORGAN- IZATIONS 15. Fascist Militia ( Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazio- nale or MVSN). The militia, popularly known as Blackshirts ( Camicie Nere, CONN) is a purely Fascist party organization whose primary function is the defense and support of the Fascist regime. In 1923 the militia was declared an integral part of the armed forces of the state, while retaining its identity as an independent force. , Blackshirts were organized under a GHQ at Romo under Mus- solini, with a Chief of Staff as the executive commander. The latter in war comes under the direct orders of the Chief of the General Staff. Territorially, the Militia is organized into 14 Zone Commands in Italy, corresponding roughly to an army corps area in peace time. No militia zone commands exist overseas. a. Ordinary Militia. (1) Groups of Legions. Thirty-three such groups exist as . administrative headquarters in Italy. (2) Legions (. Administrative ). F These are depot legions established in Italy and responsible for raising and training operational battalions for service with the army. Each administrative legion bears a name and a number. The names may be of places (e. g. CREMONA), or of men (e. g. MUSSOLINI) , or of qualities (e. g. FEDELISSIMA) . (3) Legions ( Divisional or Operational) . In theory, divisional Blackshirt legions, containing at least two operational battalions, are intended to be an organic part of infantry divisions. In practice, however, this organization has 43 Approved For Release 2004/04/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R01 2400260003-2 APPro*fd For 24°02600°3-2 broken down. Many battalions have bad to be withdrawn from first-line divisions owing to their lack of trainbig and poor lighting qualities; others were transferred from one division to another with great frequency; and finally others were formed into inde- pendent raggruppamenti. This was virtually a return to the militia organization which was officially abandoned when the battalions were incorporated hi to the army. Divisional legions generally bear the name and number of one of their constituent battalions. (4) Blackshirt Raggruppamenti. These consist of a variable number of groups of operational battalions. Two 8uch raggruppamenti, G ALB I ATI and DIA- MANTI, were disbanded at the conclusion of the Greek cam- paign; 23 MARZO and 3 GENNAIO were destroyed in Russia; the 30th Raggruppamento in Sardinia and the 10th Raggrup- pamento in Yugoslavia still exist. (5) Blackshirt battalion ( battaglione d’assalto or battaglione CONN). An operational unit, composed of volunteers, for service with the Army. In March 1940, 132 Militia battalions were incorporated into the Army, 82 being assigned to 4 1 infantry divisions. Each pair of battalions attached to infantry divisions generally con- stitutes a divisional legion. Operational battalions bear the name of their parent (adminis- trative) legion and a number. (6) “M” ( Morte ) Blackshirt battalions. Operational battalions selected for special training and service abroad as independent units, not attached to infantry divisions.

Special Militias. (1) Antiaircraft and Coast Defence Militia ( Milizia Artiglieria Controaerei, MAC — formerly known as DICAT— and Milizia Artiglieria Marittima, MAM — formerly known as MIL- MART). Although administered from a single headquarters ( Comando Milizia Contraerei e Artiglieria Marittima), those two militia organizations normally operate separately. The Ministries of War and Navy are responsible for technical equipment and maintenance. In war, units of both the militias operate under the control of local Territorial Defense Headquarters. Both MAC and MAM are composed of men between the ages of 18 and 20, or over tho age of 37, or who are unfit for active service. (a) Antiaircraft Artillery {MAC). , The AA defenses of the Army and of the country itself are separate, the MAC being responsible only for the latter. The MAC comprises a Central AA Militia school, 5 groups of legions, and 22 legions. Each legion contains 4 battalions of 4 batteries each' of 4 AA guns (76/40 and 76/45) and 2 heavy MGs. A battery has 3 officers and 134 enlisted men. (b) Coast Defense Militia {MAM) . Responsible for manning coast defense batteries; comprises a headquarters, 3 groups of legions, 14 legions, and a school.
