        "text": "Fabio Cannavaro (born 13 September 1973) is an Italian professional football coach and former player. He is the current head coach of Serie B club Benevento. A centre-back, he spent the majority of his career in Italy. He started his career at Napoli before spending seven years at Parma, with whom he won two Coppa Italia titles, the 1999 Supercoppa Italiana, and the 1999 UEFA Cup. After spells at Internazionale and Juventus, he transferred (along with manager Fabio Capello) from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2006, with whom he won consecutive La Liga titles in 2007 and 2008. After returning to Juventus for one season in 2009–10, he joined Al-Ahli in Dubai, where he retired from football in 2011 after an injury-troubled season. He is regarded as one of the best defenders of all time.\n\nFabio Borini (Italian pronunciation: [ˈfaːbjo boˈriːni]; born 29 March 1991) is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Milan and the Italy national team. He started his career at Bologna, before moving to Chelsea in 2007. In 2011, Borini joined Championship side Swansea City on loan, and eventually signed for Roma, before moving to Liverpool in 2012. He spent the 2013–14 season on loan at Sunderland, and after a season back at Liverpool he joined Sunderland permanently in August 2015. Borini made his senior international debut in 2012, and was an unused member of the Italian squad that reached the Euro 2012 final.\n\nFabio Fognini (born 24 May 1987) is an Italian professional tennis player. He has a career-high ranking of world No. 9 achieved on 15 July 2019. He is currently ranked in the top 50 in the world by the Association of Tennis Professionals. Fognini's most successful surface is red clay, upon which he has won eight of his nine ATP singles titles, most notably at the 2019 Monte-Carlo Masters, as well as having reached the quarterfinals of the 2011 French Open. Together with Simone Bolelli, Fognini won the 2015 Australian Open doubles championship, becoming the first all-Italian men's pair to win a Grand Slam title in the Open era.\n\nFábio Alexandre da Silva Coentrão (born 11 March 1988) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays for Rio Ave F.C. and the Portugal national team. Mainly a left back, he can also operate as a left winger and occasionally as a defensive midfielder. After starting playing professionally with Rio Ave, he signed for Benfica at 19, going on to be loaned several times before becoming an important member of the first team, as a left-back. In 2011, he joined Real Madrid. A Portuguese international since 2009, Coentrão represented the nation in two World Cups and one European Championship."
