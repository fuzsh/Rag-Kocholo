        "text": "A selection of films starring Fabio Testi.\n\nCONTRABAND\n\nDir. Lucio Fulci, 1980.\n\nItaly, 97 min.\n\nIn Italian with English subtitles.\n\nSUNDAY, APRIL 3 – 5:00 PM\n\nSATURDAY, APRIL 9 – 7:30 PM\n\nTUESDAY, APRIL 19 – 7:30 PM\n\nSATURDAY, APRIL 30 – 10:00 PM\n\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE\n\nFabio Testi stars as Luca Di Angelo, an idealistic family man and cigarette smuggler in the treacherous Naples underworld. But when a rival gang massacres his brother and abducts his wife, Luca triggers a psychotic mob war that goes far beyond mere revenge.Get ready for a crime saga unlike anything you’ve ever seen before as director Lucio Fulci (ZOMBIE) unleashes the most gut-splattering, brain-blasting, flesh-frying scenes of cruelty and carnage imaginable. This is CONTRABAND!\n\nCHINA 9, LIBERTY 37\n\nDir. Monte Hellman, 1978.\n\nItaly/Spain, 102 min.\n\nIn English.\n\nSATURDAY, APRIL 2 – 10:00 PM\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 7 – 10:00 PM\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21 – 7:30 PM\n\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE\n\nFabio Testi plays Clayton Drumm, on his way to the gallows when he’s offered a chance to live in exchange for killing Matthew Sebanek (Warren Oates), a miner who refuses to sell his land to the railroad. The arrangement becomes complicated when Clayton and Matthew become friends, and more complicated still when Clayton and Matthew’s wife Cather (Jenny Auguttter), fall for each other. With the railroad’s gunmen hot their heels, enemies become friends, then enemies again, then uneasy friends again, then ambiguous frenemies in this western from Monte Hellman, director of TWO-LANE BLACKTOP, COCKFIGHTER, THE SHOOTING and RIDE IN THE WHIRLWIND.

Before you can say “The Postman Always Rings Twice,” passions are inflamed, suspicions raised, double crosses abound and things generally go poorly for everyone is this seedy 70’s Euro-noir, also starring Howard Ross and Barbara Bach.\n\nVAI GORILLA\n\na.k.a.
