The deals were announced at the annual tech event LEAP in the capital city of Riyadh and will support the development of tech startups, the Saudi Press Agency reported. AWS, as Amazon’s cloud business is known, said its plans include spending $5.3 billion to create a new infrastructure region that’ll open in 2026 and help train local developers.

Its investment is a boon for the kingdom’s efforts to attract foreign investment and its plan to become a technology hub for the Middle East.
