RIYADH: US tech firm IBM is one of the recent organizations to inaugurate its regional headquarters in Riyadh following the implementation of Saudi Arabia’s directive to attract more companies to the Kingdom.

A range of firms, including Northern Trust, Bechtel, and Pepsico from the US, as well as IHG Hotels and Resorts, PwC, and Deloitte from the UK have moved their Middle East bases to the Saudi capital to capitalize on the growing economy.

The Kingdom had previously announced that it would not award any deals to any foreign company or commercial entity with a Middle Eastern base outside Saudi Arabia starting from Jan. 1, 2024.

Welcoming the move from the US tech firm, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Investment Khalid Al-Falih said: “IBM’s decision to establish their regional headquarters in Riyadh is testament to Saudi Arabia’s success in developing a conducive business environment and ecosystem that complements our world-class ICT infrastructure.”

Arvind Krishna, chairman and CEO of IBM, expressed the company’s commitment to the Kingdom, stating: “Today, we are reinforcing our longstanding commitment to the Kingdom as we inaugurate our regional headquarters in Riyadh. Transformative technologies like hybrid cloud and AI are instrumental in solving the most pressing challenges.”

The firm’s base in Riyadh will serve as a hub for the company’s efforts to enhance Saudi Arabia’s tech landscape, as the company has been actively involved in collaborating with the government and various businesses in the Kingdom.

The Kingdom has outperformed its target for attracting regional HQs, with over 180 companies established in the area as of November 2023, surpassing the initial goal of 160 by the end of 2023.

IBM’s move indicates its dedication to reinforcing Saudi Arabia’s tech sector with services in hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence aligning with the Vision 2030 economic development plan.

Hybrid cloud is a computing approach that combines on-site servers and private and public cloud services for flexible and efficient data and application management.

The Ministry of Investment hosted IBM executives on Nov. 30, 2023, and presented the company with the regional HQ license.

RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund generated an average annual shareholders’ return of 8.7 percent by the end of 2023, highlighting its significant role in the Kingdom’s ongoing economic diversification.

As the nation advances its Vision 2030 agenda, PIF’s performance underscores its pivotal position in reducing the country’s dependence on oil revenues, a core objective of the initiative’s framework.

The Vision 2030 plan, launched in 2016, aims to transform Saudi Arabia’s economy by reducing its reliance on oil, fostering new industries, and attracting foreign investment.

Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of PIF, emphasized the fund’s mission, highlighting 2023 as a time of significant progress and broad achievement.

He said: “During a year of progress and widespread achievement, PIF has continued to deliver on its mandate as the driving force of Saudi Arabia’s sustainable economic transformation and diversification.”

Al-Rumayyan noted the unveiling of new giga-projects, the launch of portfolio companies across various sectors, and the establishment of landmark partnerships.

Central to this effort is PIF, which has been instrumental in channeling strategic investments into key sectors, thereby driving the Kingdom’s transition toward a more diversified and sustainable economic model.

PIF’s annual report for 2023 revealed that its assets under management, known as AuM, surged by 29 percent, reaching SR2.871 trillion ($765 billion) by year-end.

This figure climbed to over $3.47 trillion by July this year, indicating sustained growth.

PIF’s international AuM grew by 14.3 percent, reaching SR586 billion by the end of 2023, reflecting its expanding global footprint and efforts to diversify its investment portfolio across various international markets.

Domestically, PIF has been a key driver in the growth of critical sectors, creating over 730,000 direct and indirect jobs by the end of 2023 — a figure that rose to more than 763,000 by the first quarter of this year.

These efforts have supported high-value employment and strengthened the private sector, a crucial element in Saudi Arabia’s economic transformation.

The fund’s diversified portfolio spans a wide range of industries, including 23.1 percent of investments in energy, 17.0 percent in real estate, 9.4 percent in information technology, and 7.3 percent in financials.

A critical aspect of the fund’s domestic strategy is the Saudi sector development, which has been instrumental in advancing the Kingdom’s economic diversification for over five decades.

The SSD pool focuses on fostering growth in promising domestic industries through direct and indirect investments in emerging sectors and companies.

In 2023, the portfolio, encompassing over 100 companies valued at more than SR943 billion, achieved a remarkable 101 percent increase in AuM compared to the previous year.

Looking ahead, the fund’s investments are expected to play a vital role in achieving the Kingdom’s economic goals by 2025, the report said.

This includes contributing SR1.2 trillion to cumulative non-oil gross domestic product, creating 1.8 million jobs and ensuring a 60 percent contribution to local content through PIF and its portfolio companies.

The fund aims to attract SR1.2 trillion in cumulative non-governmental interest, including domestic and foreign direct investment, across 13 strategic sectors, including aerospace and defense, automotive, entertainment, and metals and mining.

The shares, which will be listed and traded on the Main Market of the Saudi Exchange, include 20 percent — or 1.5 million shares — reserved for retail investors.

This move will help the firm raise capital, enhance share valuation, and reduce capital while maintaining corporate identity and improving its reputation to attract and retain employees.

According to a market study by Euromonitor International, the Saudi fragrance market is projected to increase at an 11.3 percent compound annual growth rate from 2023 to 2027, reaching SR13.4 billion ($3.57 billion) by 2027.

This will be driven by increasing disposable incomes, women’s empowerment, and tourism, including Hajj and Umrah.

He added: “As we prepare to list on the Saudi Exchange, we are poised to begin a new chapter that integrates our rich legacy with innovation and strategic expansion.”

It reported a 30.4 percent revenue increase in 2023, with revenues rising from SR442.5 million in 2021 to SR767 million in 2023, reflecting a 31.7 percent CAGR. Its profit margin improved to 66.6 percent in 2023, up from 61.7 percent in 2021.

“This listing is driven by a strategic ambition to diversify our investor base and strengthen our business operations to accelerate our growth and expansion strategy both locally and internationally,” said Waleed Al-Majed, managing director and CEO at Al Majed for Oud.

The intention to list Al Majed for Oud Co. on the Saudi Exchange comes as the Kingdom’s IPO market continues to expand.

A PwC report from May highlighted Tadawul’s leading role in GCC IPOs, with the primary market hosting three offerings that raised $667 million and the secondary market generating $57 million from six deals.

RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s holdings of US Treasury bonds increased to $140.3 billion in June, reflecting a 26.73 percent year-on-year rise.

Data from the US Treasury Department showed the Kingdom maintained its position as the 17th largest holder of these securities, which are known for their stability and liquidity.

Saudi Arabia and other nations invest in these bonds for their safety, diversification benefits, and alignment with their economic relationships with the US.

The Kingdom is the only Arab nation among the top 20 holders of US Treasury securities.

Saudi Arabia’s June holdings were also up month on month, with the May figure standing at $136.3 billion.

This increase highlights Saudi Arabia’s expanding influence in global financial markets and its strategic use of sovereign wealth to bolster its economic standing. The rise in US Treasury holdings aligns with the Kingdom’s financial strategy to diversify investments beyond oil revenues.

This growth in Saudi Arabia’s holdings reflects a broader pattern seen across the Gulf Cooperation Council nations, where other member states have also maintained substantial investments in US Treasury securities.

The UAE held $65.2 billion in US Treasury bonds as of June, demonstrating a slight decrease from the $66.5 billion it held in May.

Kuwait has maintained a steady presence in the US Treasury market, with its holdings standing at $50.8 billion in June.

This figure is consistent with previous months, indicating a stable investment strategy that prioritizes steady returns and minimal risk exposure.

Oman and Qatar, though smaller in scale compared to their GCC counterparts, also contribute to the region’s collective investment in US Treasury bonds.

Oman’s holdings were recorded at approximately $7.6 billion in June, while Qatar’s holdings reached around $7.4 billion during the same period.

Bahrain also participated in this trend, though its holdings are more modest. As of June, its investments in US Treasury bonds were valued at $1.2 billion.

The data collected is primarily from US-based custodians and broker-dealers. Since American securities held in overseas accounts may not be attributed to the actual owners, the department said, the data may not provide a precise accounting of individual country ownership of treasury securities.
