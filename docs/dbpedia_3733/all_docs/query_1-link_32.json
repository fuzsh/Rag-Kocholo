        "text": "Since being issued a Space Investment License on 25 Oct 2023 during the Foreign Investment Initiative (FII) 7th Edition, ASPACE has attracted widespread attentions in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. The Ministry of Investment of Saudi, the Saudi Space Agency, and more than 50 KSA and Middle Eastern media, including Saudi Press Agency, Al Riyadh, Saudi News, Witnaat, Aawsat News, and Al Arabia, have reported on ASPACE.\n\nThe Saudi Press Agency reported that Dr. Mohammed bin Saud Al-Tamimi, the CEO of the Saudi Space Agency, expressed his view that ASPACE's investment in the Kingdom is a significant milestone for the company, and that he anticipates positive impact in the space industry within the Kingdom and the enhancing of the overall satellite manufacturing base in the region. He also highlighted the company's commitment to advancing space technology not only within GCC countries but also to the global.\n\nThe Ministry of Investment of Saudi stated that “the Saudi Vision2030, set forth ambitious targets for the space sector, backed by the Saudi Space Agency, has proven the sky is not the limit, and invites the private sector to work with the Kingdom on making its ambitions a reality.”\n\nAl Riyadh, Saudi News, Witnaat, Aawsat News, and Al Arabia reported that ASPACE will establish the first Advanced Satellite Manufacturing Centre in Saudi.\n\nThe attention and coverage of Saudi and Middle Eastern media have strengthened the regional influence of ASPACE, which is of great significance for building a Saudi space industry city!"
