        "text": "Riyadh: The Saudi Press Agency (SPA) officially announced the establishment of its pioneering News Training Academy. The groundbreaking initiative was unveiled on Thursday during the Human Capacity Development Initiative conference held in Riyadh, under the esteemed patronage of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nSPA's foray into the realm of media education marks a significant milestone, aimed at enhancing the skills and expertise of professionals in the field. The first phase of the academy's operations has already commenced with the forging of strategic partnerships with both local and international organizations, as stated in a press release issued by SPA.\n\nAmong the local collaborators are esteemed institutions such as the Technical and Vocational Training Corporation, the Prince Mohammad bin Salman College of Business and Entrepreneurship, and the Institute of Public Administration, among others. These partnerships are integral to the academy's mission of localized knowledge dissemination and the transfer of best practices.\n\nMoreover, SPA's new academy is set to benefit from collaborative endeavours with over 30 international news corporations, positioning itself as a regional powerhouse for news content production and distribution. With a focus on enhancing news skills and meeting market demands, the academy's curriculum spans five key domains, including journalism and news, technology and artificial intelligence, leadership and journalism ethics, media partnerships, and news awareness.\n\nDesigned to cater to a diverse audience encompassing journalists, photographers, media professionals, technicians, students and officials in media-related roles, the academy's programs are tailored to address the evolving landscape of media and journalism.\n\nIn a strategic alignment with the vision of fostering media excellence, Sky News Arabia Academy, a subsidiary of International Media Investments (IMI), has inked a strategic MoU with SPA during its participation in the Human Capability Initiative 2024 (HCI) conference. This partnership highlights Sky News Arabia Academy's commitment to supporting professionals across all media sectors in honing their skills in media and television presentation, content creation, and more.\n\nOver the next three years, SPA and Sky News Arabia Academy will collaboratively elevate existing training programs to meet future challenges and emerging trends in the media landscape. The partnership aims to implement joint initiatives focusing on innovation and media excellence while fostering an environment conducive to growth and development.\n\nExpressing pride in the partnership, Ahmed Aal Rabeea, Chairman Office in charge at Sky News Arabia, emphasized the shared commitment to empowering media professionals and content creators in the region. He underlined the significance of collaboration in equipping future generations of media talents “by providing them with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in this vital sector, which is constantly witnessing rapid changes”.\n\nThe signing of the MoU is part of Sky News Arabia Academy's broader initiative to establish partnerships across the Arab world, providing aspiring journalists and professionals with invaluable training opportunities and expertise.\n\nThe launch of SPA's news training academy signifies a pivotal moment in Saudi Arabia's media landscape, heralding a new era of excellence and innovation in journalism and news dissemination."
