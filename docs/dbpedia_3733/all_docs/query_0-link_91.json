        "text": "Saudi-led air strikes have killed at least 44 people in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, rebels say.\n\nThe strikes targeted the headquarters of Yemen's armed forces - controlled by Houthi rebels - and injured more than 100 people, the rebel news agency said.\n\nOn Saturday, Saudi Arabia shot down a Scud missile fired by rebels.\n\nUN-brokered peace talks are due to take place in Geneva on 14 June aimed at ending weeks of conflict which have killed more than 2,000 people.\n\nThe majority of those killed in Sunday's air strikes were soldiers who were at the headquarters to collect their pay cheques, Saba news agency said.\n\nThe compound was shaken by four explosions while several nearby homes in the central Tahrir district were also destroyed.\n\nSince 26 March, Saudi Arabia has been targeting the Houthi rebels in a series of US-backed air strikes.\n\nThe rebels and their allies have responded with cross-border attacks against the kingdom.\n\nBut the rebels' use of a Scud missile was the first such deployment of a ballistic missile in the conflict.\n\nIt was intercepted by a Patriot missile battery near the kingdom's south-western city of Khamis Mushait, the state Saudi Press Agency said.\n\nThe city is home to the King Khalid air base, the largest facility in that part of Saudi Arabia."
