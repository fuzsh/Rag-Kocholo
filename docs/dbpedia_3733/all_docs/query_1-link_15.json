        "text": "RIYADH: US tech firm IBM is one of the recent organizations to inaugurate its regional headquarters in Riyadh following the implementation of Saudi Arabia’s directive to attract more companies to the Kingdom.\n\nA range of firms, including Northern Trust, Bechtel, and Pepsico from the US, as well as IHG Hotels and Resorts, PwC, and Deloitte from the UK have moved their Middle East bases to the Saudi capital to capitalize on the growing economy.\n\nThe Kingdom had previously announced that it would not award any deals to any foreign company or commercial entity with a Middle Eastern base outside Saudi Arabia starting from Jan. 1, 2024.\n\nWelcoming the move from the US tech firm, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Investment Khalid Al-Falih said: “IBM’s decision to establish their regional headquarters in Riyadh is testament to Saudi Arabia’s success in developing a conducive business environment and ecosystem that complements our world-class ICT infrastructure.”\n\nArvind Krishna, chairman and CEO of IBM, expressed the company’s commitment to the Kingdom, stating: “Today, we are reinforcing our longstanding commitment to the Kingdom as we inaugurate our regional headquarters in Riyadh. Transformative technologies like hybrid cloud and AI are instrumental in solving the most pressing challenges.”\n\nThe firm’s base in Riyadh will serve as a hub for the company’s efforts to enhance Saudi Arabia’s tech landscape, as the company has been actively involved in collaborating with the government and various businesses in the Kingdom.\n\nThe Kingdom has outperformed its target for attracting regional HQs, with over 180 companies established in the area as of November 2023, surpassing the initial goal of 160 by the end of 2023.\n\nIBM’s move indicates its dedication to reinforcing Saudi Arabia’s tech sector with services in hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence aligning with the Vision 2030 economic development plan.\n\nHybrid cloud is a computing approach that combines on-site servers and private and public cloud services for flexible and efficient data and application management.\n\nThe Ministry of Investment hosted IBM executives on Nov. 30, 2023, and presented the company with the regional HQ license.\n\nRIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund generated an average annual shareholders’ return of 8.7 percent by the end of 2023, highlighting its significant role in the Kingdom’s ongoing economic diversification.\n\nAs the nation advances its Vision 2030 agenda, PIF’s performance underscores its pivotal position in reducing the country’s dependence on oil revenues, a core objective of the initiative’s framework.\n\nThe Vision 2030 plan, launched in 2016, aims to transform Saudi Arabia’s economy by reducing its reliance on oil, fostering new industries, and attracting foreign investment.\n\nYasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of PIF, emphasized the fund’s mission, highlighting 2023 as a time of significant progress and broad achievement.\n\nHe said: “During a year of progress and widespread achievement, PIF has continued to deliver on its mandate as the driving force of Saudi Arabia’s sustainable economic transformation and diversification.”\n\nAl-Rumayyan noted the unveiling of new giga-projects, the launch of portfolio companies across various sectors, and the establishment of landmark partnerships.\n\nCentral to this effort is PIF, which has been instrumental in channeling strategic investments into key sectors, thereby driving the Kingdom’s transition toward a more diversified and sustainable economic model.\n\nPIF’s annual report for 2023 revealed that its assets under management, known as AuM, surged by 29 percent, reaching SR2.871 trillion ($765 billion) by year-end.\n\nThis figure climbed to over $3.47 trillion by July this year, indicating sustained growth.\n\nPIF’s international AuM grew by 14.3 percent, reaching SR586 billion by the end of 2023, reflecting its expanding global footprint and efforts to diversify its investment portfolio across various international markets.\n\nDomestically, PIF has been a key driver in the growth of critical sectors, creating over 730,000 direct and indirect jobs by the end of 2023 — a figure that rose to more than 763,000 by the first quarter of this year.\n\nThese efforts have supported high-value employment and strengthened the private sector, a crucial element in Saudi Arabia’s economic transformation.\n\nThe fund’s diversified portfolio spans a wide range of industries, including 23.1 percent of investments in energy, 17.0 percent in real estate, 9.4 percent in information technology, and 7.3 percent in financials.\n\nA critical aspect of the fund’s domestic strategy is the Saudi sector development, which has been instrumental in advancing the Kingdom’s economic diversification for over five decades.\n\nThe SSD pool focuses on fostering growth in promising domestic industries through direct and indirect investments in emerging sectors and companies.\n\nIn 2023, the portfolio, encompassing over 100 companies valued at more than SR943 billion, achieved a remarkable 101 percent increase in AuM compared to the previous year.\n\nLooking ahead, the fund’s investments are expected to play a vital role in achieving the Kingdom’s economic goals by 2025, the report said.\n\nThis includes contributing SR1.2 trillion to cumulative non-oil gross domestic product, creating 1.8 million jobs and ensuring a 60 percent contribution to local content through PIF and its portfolio companies.\n\nThe fund aims to attract SR1.2 trillion in cumulative non-governmental interest, including domestic and foreign direct investment, across 13 strategic sectors, including aerospace and defense, automotive, entertainment, and metals and mining.\n\nRIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index rose on Monday, gaining 41.63 points, or 0.35 percent, to close at 12,023.03.\n\nThe total trading turnover of the benchmark index was SR8 billion ($2.13 billion), as 142 of the listed stocks advanced, while 81 retreated.\n\nThe MSCI Tadawul Index increased by 2.93 points, or 0.20 percent, to close at 1,492.19.\n\nThe Kingdom’s parallel market Nomu surged by 80.08 points, or 0.31 percent, to close at 25,792.09. This comes as 38 of the listed stocks advanced while as many as 29 retreated.\n\nThe best-performing stock of the day was Buruj Cooperative Insurance Co., with its share price surging 9.99 percent to SR22.02.\n\nOther top performers included Red Sea International Co. and Al-Baha Investment and Development Co., with share prices rising by 9.97 percent to SR32 and 8.33 percent to SR0.13, respectively.\n\nSaudi Reinsurance Co. and Ash-Sharqiyah Development Co. also recorded positive trajectories on Aug. 19.\n\nThe worst performer of the day was Riyadh Cement Co., with its share price falling by 4.30 percent to SR25.60.\n\nThe Company for Cooperative Insurance and Arabian Pipes Co. also saw significant declines, with their shares dropping by 2.01 percent and 1.70 percent to SR165.40 and SR139, respectively.\n\nOther worst performers included Almarai Co. and Naseej International Trading Co.\n\nOn the announcement front, Thimar Development Holding Co. signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding on Aug. 18 with Madar Al Khair Trading Co. to acquire up to 50 percent of Madar Al Khair, which has over 50 years of experience in livestock trading, fresh meat, and related industries.\n\nIn a statement on Tadawul, Thimar Development Holding Co. said that this partnership aligns with its strategic goals and the Kingdom’s vision for food security.\n\nFunding for the acquisition will be sourced from an upcoming capital increase and other financing options. The memorandum will become binding pending the completion of due diligence.\n\nThimar is focused on diversifying investments for high returns with low risks and will announce further developments as they arise.\n\nRIYADH: Saudi perfume manufacturer Al Majed for Oud Co. plans to launch an initial public offering on the Kingdom’s main stock market, releasing 30 percent of its issued share capital.\n\nA company statement revealed that the IPO will offer a maximum of 7.5 million shares. Of these, 2.25 million will be allocated to public funds.\n\nThe shares, which will be listed and traded on the Main Market of the Saudi Exchange, include 20 percent — or 1.5 million shares — reserved for retail investors.\n\nThis move will help the firm raise capital, enhance share valuation, and reduce capital while maintaining corporate identity and improving its reputation to attract and retain employees.\n\nThis comes as the fragrance market is expanding rapidly due to rising consumer preferences, higher disposable incomes, tourism growth, and increased digital adoption.\n\nAccording to a market study by Euromonitor International, the Saudi fragrance market is projected to increase at an 11.3 percent compound annual growth rate from 2023 to 2027, reaching SR13.4 billion ($3.57 billion) by 2027.\n\nThis will be driven by increasing disposable incomes, women’s empowerment, and tourism, including Hajj and Umrah.\n\nMajed Ali Othman Al-Majed, chairman of Al Majed for Oud, said: “For over six decades, Al Majed for Oud has grown to become a major player in the regional oud and perfume industry. Our dedication to tradition and quality has allowed us to earn the trust and loyalty of our customers.”\n\nHe added: “As we prepare to list on the Saudi Exchange, we are poised to begin a new chapter that integrates our rich legacy with innovation and strategic expansion.”\n\nOne of the leading players in the Kingdom’s oud and perfume market, the company is expanding within the Gulf Cooperation Council region and offers over 650 products across 132 brands through 286 stores as of Dec. 31, 2023.\n\nIt reported a 30.4 percent revenue increase in 2023, with revenues rising from SR442.5 million in 2021 to SR767 million in 2023, reflecting a 31.7 percent CAGR. Its profit margin improved to 66.6 percent in 2023, up from 61.7 percent in 2021.\n\n“This listing is driven by a strategic ambition to diversify our investor base and strengthen our business operations to accelerate our growth and expansion strategy both locally and internationally,” said Waleed Al-Majed, managing director and CEO at Al Majed for Oud.\n\nThe intention to list Al Majed for Oud Co. on the Saudi Exchange comes as the Kingdom’s IPO market continues to expand.\n\nA PwC report from May highlighted Tadawul’s leading role in GCC IPOs, with the primary market hosting three offerings that raised $667 million and the secondary market generating $57 million from six deals.\n\nRIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Riyadh Air has secured a multi-year agreement to become the official airline partner of Concacaf, the FIFA Confederation for North, Central America, and the Caribbean.\n\nThe deal aims to enhance the airline’s presence in global sports and support Concacaf’s national and club competitions across the Americas.\n\nUnder the partnership, the Public Investment Fund-owned carrier will be involved in Concacaf’s men, women, and youth football events, reinforcing its role in the football community.\n\nThe collaboration supports Riyadh Air’s goal of enhancing connectivity and contributing to football’s development. It also aligns with Saudi Arabia’s broader ambitions, including its bid to host the FIFA World Cup 2034, further establishing the Kingdom’s prominence in global sports and beyond.\n\nOsamah Al-Nuaiser, senior vice president of marketing and corporate Communications at Riyadh Air, said: “Our partnership with Concacaf will bring passionate football fans closer to thrilling games and action in countries and territories in the Concacaf region.”\n\nHe also underscored the airline’s commitment to supporting football through its partnership with Concacaf. As the “Official Airline Partner,” the airline emphasizes its role in promoting and advancing the sport’s growth.\n\nThe partnership increases the national carrier’s visibility and supports its goal of enhancing travel experiences through digital integration. It also expands Riyadh Air’s involvement in football, building on its earlier sponsorship with Athlético de Madrid, announced in August 2023.\n\n“This partnership with Riyadh Air marks an exciting new chapter for Concacaf. Their global vision will support us in elevating all aspects of football in Concacaf, from grassroots programs to our world-class tournaments,” said Philippe Moggio, general secretary of Concacaf.\n\nHe continued: “We are excited about the opportunities this partnership will create, connecting fans across continents and inspiring them to passionately follow the beautiful game.”\n\nThe Saudi carrier is set to begin operations in 2025 and plans to serve over 100 destinations worldwide by 2030, aiming to enhance Saudi Arabia’s role as a key global travel hub.\n\nRiyadh Air’s deal with Concacaf follows the announcement of the governing body’s multi-year partnership with PIF signed on Aug. 15. This agreement aimed to enhance football across North and Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nThe partnership will support football development at all levels and improve Concacaf’s tournaments for men, women, and youth.\n\nIt aligns with major upcoming events, including the Concacaf Champions Cups, the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup, and the 2026 FIFA World Cup, co-hosted by Canada, Mexico, and the US.\n\nThe agreement emphasizes strengthening football development initiatives and expanding access to the sport for youth across all 41 Concacaf member federations.\n\nRIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s holdings of US Treasury bonds increased to $140.3 billion in June, reflecting a 26.73 percent year-on-year rise.\n\nData from the US Treasury Department showed the Kingdom maintained its position as the 17th largest holder of these securities, which are known for their stability and liquidity.\n\nSaudi Arabia and other nations invest in these bonds for their safety, diversification benefits, and alignment with their economic relationships with the US.\n\nThe Kingdom is the only Arab nation among the top 20 holders of US Treasury securities.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s June holdings were also up month on month, with the May figure standing at $136.3 billion.\n\nThis increase highlights Saudi Arabia’s expanding influence in global financial markets and its strategic use of sovereign wealth to bolster its economic standing. The rise in US Treasury holdings aligns with the Kingdom’s financial strategy to diversify investments beyond oil revenues.\n\nThis growth in Saudi Arabia’s holdings reflects a broader pattern seen across the Gulf Cooperation Council nations, where other member states have also maintained substantial investments in US Treasury securities.\n\nThe UAE held $65.2 billion in US Treasury bonds as of June, demonstrating a slight decrease from the $66.5 billion it held in May.\n\nKuwait has maintained a steady presence in the US Treasury market, with its holdings standing at $50.8 billion in June.\n\nThis figure is consistent with previous months, indicating a stable investment strategy that prioritizes steady returns and minimal risk exposure.\n\nOman and Qatar, though smaller in scale compared to their GCC counterparts, also contribute to the region’s collective investment in US Treasury bonds.\n\nOman’s holdings were recorded at approximately $7.6 billion in June, while Qatar’s holdings reached around $7.4 billion during the same period.\n\nBahrain also participated in this trend, though its holdings are more modest. As of June, its investments in US Treasury bonds were valued at $1.2 billion.\n\nThe data collected is primarily from US-based custodians and broker-dealers. Since American securities held in overseas accounts may not be attributed to the actual owners, the department said, the data may not provide a precise accounting of individual country ownership of treasury securities."
