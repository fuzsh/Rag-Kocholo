        "text": "The Northern Borders Region is located in the northeast of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The region gained its importance from The Trans-Arabian Pipeline (Tapline), which dated back to the late 1940s and was implemented by Saudi Aramco in partnership with major international oil companies like \"Chevron\" and \"Texaco.\" Under that partnership, the Tapline Company was established. It constructed the Tapline, extending from the Arabian Gulf to the Lebanese Sidon Port on the Mediterranean coast. The construction of the Tapline, with a length of 1,664 km, required the presence of oil pumping stations along this line.\n\nBeing the only university in the Northern Borders Region, Northern Border University enjoys a unique position in higher education in Saudi Arabia, which is why it holds the name of this precious region. The university plans are inspired by the region's rich values, culture, history, and location. It also ensures that its Strategic Plan 2020-2025 goes along with the region's rich natural resources, Vision 2030, and with the New University System, guided by the strategic priorities of the Northern Borders Region's Emirate.\n\nThe Middle College for Girls was established in 1402 AH and served as the foundation of Northern Border University. In 1408 AH, The Middle College for Girls was turned into The Teachers' College, awarding Bachelor's degrees to its students for the first time. The College of Science in Arar and Rafha's Community College were established to be two branches of King Abdulaziz University in 1426 AH.\n\nThe university offers a number of master's programs in various scientific and theoretical disciplines. It seeks to keep pace with Vision 2030 by developing postgraduate programs that meet the needs of the labor market by the best practices of teaching and learning to reach competitive scientific outputs at all levels."
