        "text": "KSARAP will be hosted by the RGA and will implement safety activities in association with local experts, using local research and resources, with the support of iRAP and its international partners.\n\nDrawing on the globally-recognised and freely-available iRAP methodology and investment planning tools, and with connections to training and iRAP partners worldwide, KSARAP will help to develop evidence-based policy and systematically manage safety on existing roads and new road designs.\n\nPutting the RSS2030 Strategy into action, the RGA is currently performing the world’s largest iRAP assessment, covering a network of some 73,000km of roads to understand risk for road users and produce Star Ratings and Investment Plans that will guide life-saving infrastructure improvements and build local road safety capacity.\n\niRAP Chief Executive Officer Rob McInerney said, “Local leadership is the key to life-saving success in our partnerships across 100 countries and KSARAP will bring together government agencies, traffic authorities, road safety organizations, and private stakeholders from across the Kingdom to address the national burden of road trauma.\n\n“Supported by the iRAP methodology and tools, global partnerships and innovation, KSARAP will help to create 3-star or better roads nationally and support policy that embeds road safety for generations to come.”\n\niRAP’s Star Rating methodology provides an objective measure of the level of safety which is ‘built-in’ to the road for vehicle occupants, motorcyclists, bicyclists and pedestrians. Five-star roads are the safest while one-star roads are the least safe.\n\nFor more information:\n\nKSARAP Brochure in English and Arabic\n\nOn the safety of KSA’s roads, the road attributes that matter and the Business Case for Safer Roads, visit https://irap.org/safety-insights-explorer/\n\nNews Coverage:\n\nSaudi Press Agency – https://www.spa.gov.sa/N2009224\n\nSaudi Gazette – https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/638435\n\nBNN World -https://bnn.network/world/saudi-arabia/saudi-arabia-opens-regional-office-for-international-road-assessment-programme/\n\nLeaders News – https://www.leaders-mena.com/general-authority-for-roads-opens-regional-office-of-irap-in-riyadh/\n\n– Ends –\n\nMedia enquiries:\n\nFor Roads General Authority (RGA):\n\nEng Mohammed Al-Abood\n\nHead of Traffic Engineering and Safety Department\n\nEmail: eng.alobood@mot.gov.sa\n\nMob: +966 555337715\n\nFor iRAP\n\nJudy Williams, Global Programme & Communications Manager\n\nEmail: judy.williams@irap.org\n\nMob: +61 400 782 204\n\nAbout RGA\n\nRoads General Authority (RGA) is a regulatory authority under Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Transport and Logistic Services that is responsible for overseeing the country’s construction, operation and maintenance of roads. It was established in accordance with the National Transport and Logistics Strategy by the Cabinet of Saudi Arabia in August 2022.\n\nAbout iRAP\n\niRAP is a registered charity with a vision for a world free of high-risk roads. iRAP works in partnership with governments, road authorities, mobility clubs, development banks, NGOs and research organisations to support safety assessments, capacity building, and safety performance tracking. iRAP tools have been used in more than 170 countries to Star Rate more than 1.5 million kilometres of roads and designs, assess risk at more than 1,300 schools, and influence the safety of more USD$100 billion of road infrastructure investment. Nearly 1.8 million km have been crash-rate risk mapped and more than 63,000 people have been trained globally. The iRAP tools underpin the UN Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021-2030 and Global Road Safety Performance Targets."
