The move is intended to limit “economic leakage” and boost job creation, the unidentified official said.\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has pushed a $800bn strategy to double the size of the city and turn it into a global hub. While earlier steps included incentives to move, recent announcement is an implicit threat — setting up firms to lose out on billions of dollars of deals unless they relocate their regional headquarters.\n\nThrough the regional headquarters attraction program of multinational companies, these firms now have direct access to the local economy, gaining financial and geographic opportunities. The programme also provides direct and indirect benefits for Saudi nationals, residents, and businesses, offering local talent employment opportunities. Every job attracted through the programme is estimated to create 2.5 jobs indirectly in the base economy.\n\nFahd Al-Rasheed, CEO of the Royal Commission for Riyadh City (RCRC), said: “The RHQ companies will bring new expertise, research and development as well as innovation in a wide range of sectors, resulting in knowledge transfer in the medium to long term, and improvement in the local talent pool. By 2030, the programme will contribute $18bn to the local economy and create around 30,000 new jobs.”\n\n“As an attractive city for MNCs, their employees, and their families to relocate, Riyadh is at the center of the regional headquarters attraction programme of multinational companies. We are undergoing a rapid transformation, as we look to double the city’s population and increase its economic footprint threefold by 2030\n\nAlthough the country is diversifying from oil and gas, the petrochemical industry is still an excellent place to invest within Saudi Arabia. National estimates show a need for investment in traditional energy and natural-gas-related energy products at tens of billions of dollars each.\n\nWant more evidence of Saudi growth and investment potential? The Saudis have created a designated “investment zone” called NOEM that is due to attract over $500 billion in funding and provide another direct alternative when it comes to investing capital in the region. What’s involved? Saudi media names energy and water, mobility and biotechnology as relevant sectors. There’s also some food production planned, along with work in technological and digital sciences, advanced manufacturing, media and entertainment"
