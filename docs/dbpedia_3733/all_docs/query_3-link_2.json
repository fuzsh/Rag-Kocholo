        "text": "Speech by His Excellency the Minister of Culture and Information\n\nChairman of the Board of Directors of Saudi Press Agency\n\nDr. Adel bin Zaid Al-Toraifi\n\nWithin the media workflows, the Saudi Press Agency represents a major and important source for news. It occupies a leading place in dealing with events and follow-up and coverage of their developments for the public through its networks and correspondents at home and abroad, making it occupy an influential position at home and dominate the course of the flow of news about the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia abroad and seeks to engage and influence the broadcast of news among major international agencies in developed and developing countries.\n\nIn the midst of global political, economic and social events, the Saudi Press Agency is characterized by credible and stability in its news, analyses and views within the new international media order and seeks to reach the highest ranks of the great technological development in the media technology and underline the influential role in the midst of these transformations experienced by the countries of the world.\n\nThe Saudi Press Agency, SPA, has become a leading influential media source at the local and external levels as it reaches all segments of society at home and abroad to highlight the great and influential role of the kingdom and convey its point of view about the issues and events on the Arab, Islamic and international arenas and reach geographic areas that some other media fail to reach due to the advancement of the equipment it uses in the transmission of news. It has succeeded in its news broadcast in six languages including Arabic, English, French, Persian, Russian and Chinese.\n\nThe Saudi Press Agency has entered a new phase required by the modern age through its active participation in the new media and its presence in the social networking sites which has contributed to the increase in the number of its followers and spread of its message and increase of its impact. It posts its news on Twitter in Arabic, English and Persian languages and also posts photos on Instagram.\n\nSince the establishment of SPA in 1390 H./1971 G., it has been working to keep up with the great development that has been witnessed by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and to broadcast news and views about the important issues with professionalism and high credibility at both the local and international news. SPA is characterized by relying on Saudi experienced teams of editors, photographers, technicians and administrators at its main headquarters and at its offices within the kingdom as well as in a number of Arab capitals and in some world capitals.\n\nThe Saudi Cabinet's decision, which was issued on 7 Rajab 1433 H., to turn the Saudi Press Agency to be a General Commission, was a new beginning to SPA in order to promote its media presence and develop its human and technical capacities, in addition to the previous breakthroughs it has achieved, as part of the media system.\n\nThe media outlets, including the Saudi Press Agency, enjoy the support and encouragement of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, Crown Prince and Deputy Crown Prince. I pray to Almighty Allah to help all of us to achieve the goals we aspire for in our dear, great homeland, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ."
