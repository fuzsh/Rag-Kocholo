        "text": "RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s state news agency announced on Thursday the launch of its first news training academy.\n\nThe Saudi Press Agency’s initiative came as part of the Human Capacity Development Initiative conference, held in Riyadh under the patronage of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nThe first phase of the academy’s work has seen the signing of partnerships with local and international organizations, SPA said in a press statement.\n\nLocal partnerships include the Technical and Vocational Training Corporation, the Prince Mohammad bin Salman College of Business and Entrepreneurship, the Institute of Public Administration, the Human Resources Development Fund, the Sky News Arabia Academy, and the Austrian International Center for Qualification and Quality.\n\nSPA’s new academy will benefit from the agency’s partnership with more than 30 international news corporations.\n\nThe agency said it will work towards localizing knowledge, transferring best practices, and becoming a regional hub that produces and distributes news content.\n\nThe academy aims to develop advanced news skills, meet market requirements, and promote the transfer of knowledge, technology, and modern tools for journalistic and news work, in addition to enhancing a deep understanding of news issues and global challenges.\n\nIt will also offer training programs in five domains: journalism and news, technology and artificial intelligence, leadership and journalism ethics, media partners, and news awareness.\n\nThe newly established academy’s programs are directed at journalists, photographers, professionals, and technicians in the fields of media, media students, and media affairs officials in various entities.\n\nLONDON: Member of Scottish Parliament John Mason was expelled on Saturday from the Scottish National Party with immediate effect following a “completely unacceptable” social media post about the ongoing Israeli onslaught on Palestine’s Gaza Strip.\n\nIn response to an X comment by former SNP MSP Sandra White criticizing Israel’s conduct in Gaza, Mason denied that the Israeli military’s actions in Gaza amounted to “genocide.”\n\nHe wrote: “There is no genocide. If Israel wanted to commit genocide, they would have killed ten times as many.”\n\nWhite had replied to a post by The Herald saying, “We know what Israelis hope to achieve they are already committing Genocide in Gaza. Talk? You mention Talk whilst innocent children are being massacred.”\n\nThis came after the SNP’s foreign affairs spokesperson in Westminster, Brendan O’Hara, wrote to MSP Angus Robertson voicing his anger over the culture secretary’s meeting with Israel’s Deputy Ambassador to the UK Daniela Grudsky Ekstein.\n\nMason then revealed that he had also met with the Israeli diplomat.\n\nMason said he was “disappointed” by his suspension, but a spokesperson for the SNP Chief Whip responded: “To flippantly dismiss the death of more than 40,000 Palestinians is completely unacceptable.\n\n“There can be no room in the SNP for this kind of intolerance.”\n\nThe Scottish party’s spokesperson added that the SNP Group would meet to discuss stripping Mason of the whip, with a recommendation of a fixed-period suspension for his “utterly abhorrent comment.”\n\nOn Oct. 7, the Israeli military launched a wide-scale operation in the Gaza Strip, annihilating entire cities in the besieged enclave, killing at least 40,000 people, at least 25,000 of whom were women and children, and displacing more than 90 percent of the population multiple times.\n\nIn December, South Africa submitted to the International Court of Justice a case accusing Israel of committing “genocide” against Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nThe international monitor Human Rights Watch, alongside other humanitarian and human rights groups, warned that the Israeli government was deliberately starving civilians in Gaza as a tool of war.\n\nSAO PAULO: Media platform X said on Saturday it would close its operations in Brazil “effective immediately” due to what it called “censorship orders” from Brazilian judge Alexandre de Moraes.\n\nX claims Moraes secretly threatened one of its legal representatives in the South American country with arrest if it did not comply with legal orders to take down some content from its platform. Brazil’s Supreme Court, where Moraes has a seat, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe X service remains available to the people of Brazil, billionaire Elon Musk’s platform said on Saturday.\n\nEarlier this year, Moraes ordered X to block certain accounts, as he investigates so-called “digital militias” that have been accused of spreading fake news and hate messages during the government of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nMoraes opened an inquiry earlier this year into the billionaire after Musk said he would reactivate accounts on X that the judge had ordered blocked. Musk has called the Moraes’ decisions regarding X “unconstitutional.”\n\nAfter Musk’s challenges, X representatives reversed course and told Brazil’s Supreme Court that the social media giant would comply with the legal rulings.\n\nLawyers representing X in Brazil in April told the Supreme Court that “operational faults” have allowed users who were ordered blocked to stay active on the social media platform, after Moraes had asked X to explain why it allegedly had not fully complied with his decision.\n\nLONDON: Over 100 journalists have sent a letter to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urging the Joe Biden administration to impose an arms embargo on Israel, in response to what they view as the continued attacks on Palestinian reporters in Gaza.\n\nThe letter, signed by 113 journalists, seven press freedom organizations, and 20 news outlets, accuses the US of complicity in Israel’s actions due to its unwavering support for Tel Aviv.\n\n“Since October 7, 2023, Israel has killed more than 160 Palestinian journalists. This is the largest recorded number of journalists killed in any war.\n\n“While Israel’s indiscriminate bombing of the densely populated Gaza means no civilians are safe, Israel has also … repeatedly documented deliberately targeting journalists,” the letter stated.\n\n“Israel’s military actions are not possible without US weapons, US military aid, and US diplomatic support. By providing the weapons being used to deliberately kill journalists, you are complicit in one of the gravest affronts to press freedom today.”\n\nThe letter also accused Tel Aviv of suppressing media coverage of its actions in Gaza.\n\nThese efforts include internet outages, military censorship imposed on both domestic and international journalists, barring foreign reporters from entering Gaza, and banning Al Jazeera from the country under the pretext of national security.\n\n“Israel’s deliberate targeting of journalists follows a longstanding pattern by the Israeli government to suppress truthful reporting on its treatment of Palestinians and its war in Gaza,” the letter stated.\n\nThe appeal underscores the seriousness of Israel’s actions against journalists, which have been widely documented long before the current conflict began on Oct. 7.\n\nIt stresses that targeting journalists is a war crime under international law. And notes that US law prohibits aiding foreign forces involved in human rights violations, pointing to Israel’s record of extrajudicial killings of journalists as a clear breach.\n\nThis appeal is the latest in a series of largely ignored calls to action.\n\nIn April, more than two dozen Palestinian journalists urged American journalists to boycott the annual White House correspondents’ dinner.\n\nIn July, over 60 organizations demanded that Israeli authorities allow free and unrestricted media access to Gaza, citing the “unreasonable and untenable burden” placed on local journalists to document events.\n\nThis news coincides with a report from the International Federation of Journalists revealing that reporters covering the conflict are dying at a rate significantly higher than other professions.\n\nThe report indicates that over 12 percent of Gazan journalists have been killed, suggesting that the “unusually high” mortality rate points to media workers being deliberately targeted by the Israeli military.\n\nLONDON: Meta has announced that it has shut down CrowdTangle, a tool widely used by researchers, watchdogs, and journalists to monitor social media posts in real time.\n\nThe decision comes at a critical juncture, with new reports revealing Meta’s ongoing struggles to moderate content in Hebrew, and just months before the US presidential election.\n\nThe discontinuation of CrowdTangle, which Meta had announced earlier this year, has sparked protests from researchers and nonprofits, including the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council, Human Rights Watch, and New York University’s Center for Social Media and Politics.\n\nThese organizations have urged Meta to delay the shutdown by six months, arguing that the tool is crucial for studying the impact of social media on public discourse.\n\nIn a joint letter they said that Meta “has a responsibility to ensure that the public, independent researchers, journalists, and policymakers can study and address the impact that platforms and their algorithms are having.”\n\nMeta responded earlier this week, saying that CrowdTangle was being discontinued because it had become “hard to maintain” and “does not provide a representative picture of what is happening on our platforms.”\n\nThe company plans to replace CrowdTangle with the Meta Content Library, a new tool that is believed to offer more extensive data, including the ability to analyze comments.\n\nHowever, access to this tool will be limited to researchers affiliated with nonprofit institutions, who must apply through a third party partnered with Meta.\n\nNews publishers and other groups with commercial interests will not be eligible for access.\n\nThe letter said: “This decision jeopardizes essential pre- and post-election oversight mechanisms and undermines Meta’s transparency efforts during this critical period, and at a time when social trust and digital democracy are alarmingly fragile.”\n\nMeta originally acquired CrowdTangle in 2016 to enhance content insights for publishers tracking content across platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube.\n\nCrowdTangle became a key tool over the years for tracking the flow of information on social media, including viral falsehoods that led to real-world harm.\n\nIts shutdown coincides with a new scandal facing Meta. Reports on Thursday revealed the company’s ongoing difficulties in moderating content related to the Israel-Palestine conflict, particularly in Hebrew.\n\nArab News earlier this month reported that, despite recent internal policy changes, Meta’s lack of sufficient investment had led to a spike in violent and harmful content, primarily in Hebrew.\n\nA former Meta employee highlighted inequities in Meta’s policies governing hate speech related to Palestine, noting that fear of retaliation for raising concerns about content related to the conflict suggested the company’s priorities were “not about actually making sure content is safe for the community.”\n\nOne internal document revealed that Meta’s policies required the removal of statements like “boycott Jewish shops” and “boycott Muslim shops” but allowed the phrase “boycott Arab stores.”\n\nKARACHI: Pakistan’s economy could lose up to $300 million due to Internet disruptions caused by imposition of a national firewall, the Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) said in a press release on Thursday.\n\nIslamabad is implementing an Internet firewall to monitor and regulate content and social media platforms, according local media reports. The government denies the use of the firewall for censorship.\n\nAli Ihsan, senior vice chairman of P@SHA, said the imposition of the firewall has already caused prolonged Internet disconnections and erratic VPN performance, threatening a “complete meltdown of business operations.”\n\n“These disruptions are not mere inconveniences; but, a direct, tangible and aggressive assault on the industry’s viability – inflicting an estimated and devastating financial losses estimated to reach $300 million, which can further increase exponentially,” he said in the statement.\n\nPakistan’s telecommunication authority and Pakistan’s Minister of State for Information Technology Shaza Fatima Khawaja did not immediately respond.\n\nEarlier this month, Khawaja told local media that the government did not plan to use firewalls as a form of censorship.\n\nPakistan has already blocked access to social media platform X since the February elections in which jailed former prime minister Imran Khan won the most seats despite a crackdown and ban on his party.\n\nThe government has said the blocking was to stop anti state activities and a failure by X to adhere to local Pakistani laws. Rights activists say the blocking of X is designed to stifle critical voices and democratic accountability in the country.\n\nIn its statement, P@SHA said that the government’s lack of transparency around the firewall had “ignited a firestorm of distrust” among Internet users and Pakistan’s global IT clients who fear their proprietary data and privacy will be compromised.\n\nP@SHA demanded an “immediate and unconditional halt to this digital siege” and called on the government to engage with the industry to develop a cybersecurity framework.\n\nPakistan recorded $298 million in IT exports in June, up 33 percent from the year before. During the fiscal year that ended in June, IT exports were worth $3.2 billion, up 24 percent from $2.5 billion in the fiscal year 2023."
