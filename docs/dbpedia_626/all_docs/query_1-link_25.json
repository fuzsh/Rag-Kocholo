        "text": "Beishanlong’s name means “grand pass dragon” and was shown walking through the mountains. And was shown being met by other Chinese dinosaurs. “I see very tacky” he said. “How dare you set foot on these grounds” said Monolophosaurus. “Look at you paphetic fools” said Beishanlong.\n\n“Graveling at the feet of Zhejiangosaurus the magnificent” he said. “You are not fit to speak his name” said Lanzhousaurus. “I am not fit big teeth” he said. Lanzhousaurus snarled. Beishanlong pointed at Zhejiangosaurus. “I thought him by his side I loved him like a brother” he said. “And he betrayed me” he added.\n\n“And now I will destroy everything he has created” he yelled out. “Go” said Monolophosaurus. Soon they were all fighting the Chinese ornithomimid. Lanzhousaurus even hit him hard with her feet. Which stunned him. “How’s that for some big teeth” she said. But then Ambopteryx and Sinocephale came at attacked everyone.\n\n“I will not let you destroy Zhejiangosaurus’s memory” said Monolophosaurus. “Why not” said Beishanlong. “He destroyed mine”. Then Sinocephale was approached by Shantungosaurus. “Sinocephale it is me your bestie” Shantungosaurus said. But only for her to be head bashed constantly by Sinocephale.\n\n“Ooh ooh ohh whoaaaa” she yelped out. Sinocephale then rammed Shantungosaurus into everyone hitting Lanzhousaurus. “Sorry lanzhousaurus” she yelled. “Sorry sorry sorry sorry” she yelled hitting Velociraptor. Shantungosaurus accidentally kicked Lanzhousaurus in the jaw making her flip backwards.\n\n“sorry” she yelled. Monolophosaurus was hit by Beishanlong’s tail and flew back. “Monolophosaurus” said Lanzhousaurus as she ran to his aid. “Alright alright you win” said Beishanlong. They all chuckled before they were each given a handshake. “Friends” asked Beishanlong. “Friends” said the dinosaurs."
