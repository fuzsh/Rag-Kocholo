It is what Dr. Malcolm said in the intro of the third level of Chaos Theory.\n\nThe concept of Jurassic World is on the possibility of humans and dinosaurs coexisting in one another. Dr. Malcolm made such prediction at the end of the film Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and Charlotte Lockwood said so in a recording in Jurassic World: Dominion."
