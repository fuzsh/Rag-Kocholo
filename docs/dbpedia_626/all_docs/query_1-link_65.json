        "text": "I’m in Utah digging up dinosaurs! But also, one of the last big chunks of my PhD thesis has just been published online at the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology. They are generously allowing free access to the paper through the end of August, so head on over and grab a copy while it’s free! This time, I’m taking all of the knowledge gained from my previous taxonomic revisions, adding in some more taxa, and doing a revised phylogenetic analysis building on previous analyses to see how everyone shakes out and to learn a little bit more about ankylosaurid biogeography. I’ll cover some of the taxonomic stuff over the next few posts, and finish off with the big picture of ankylosaurid evolution.\n\nPinacosaurus!\n\nI’ve talked previously about the ankylosaurs of Mongolia, but I’ve also had the opportunity to study some of their friends from across the border in China. In particular, I got to see lots of specimens of Pinacosaurus, both from the Alag Teeg bonebed in Mongolia, and from Bayan Mandahu in China. Because Pinacosaurus specimens are relatively abundant and usually well preserved, there has already been lots of descriptive work on this taxon, including on the skull (and here, and here), hands and feet, and general postcrania.\n\nBaby Pinacosaurus are so teeny tiny! This one is from Bayan Mandahu and was collected during the Canada-China Dinosaur Project back in the 1980s.\n\nI’ve discussed just a few new points about Pinacosaurus, especially about how we tell the two species of Pinacosaurus apart. Pinacosaurus grangeri is known from lots of specimens, almost all of which are juveniles; it has relatively short horns at the back of its skull, a constriction in the snout between its nose and its eyes, and a notch in the rough ornamentation above each nostril. Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus is known from just one specimen (also a juvenile), and it has long squamosal horns, no constriction in its snout, and no notch in the ornamentation above each nostril (it looks like it does on one side, but I think this is just damage given that it is not present on the other side). Both species are known from Bayan Mandahu, and so it is reasonable to ask whether or not these could represent the same taxon – given the differences in skull morphology, I suspect we’re not looking at intraspecific variation here, although more specimens of P. mephistocephalus would be very helpful in this regard!\n\nCrichtonsaurus becomes Crichtonpelta"
