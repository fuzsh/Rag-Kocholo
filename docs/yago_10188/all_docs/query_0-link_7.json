        "text": "Storming into EastEnders in the 90’s, the Jackson family certainly made their mark on Walford and Albert Square.\n\nThe “classic problem family”, Carol Jackson, her partner Alan Jackson, and Carol's four children, Bianca, Sonia, Robbie, and Billie, had their fair share of dramatic storylines.\n\nREAD MORE: 'I watched EastEnders for the first time and it was basically Shakespeare rewritten for 2022'\n\nBut the actors who played them have had their own dramas outside of the show - from scandals and co-worker relationships and stints on Strictly.\n\nHere’s what the EastEnders Jackson family is up to now:\n\nPatsy Palmer - Bianca Jackson\n\nPatsy Palmer joined EastEnders as Bianca Jackson at the age of 21 and instantly became a fan favourite.\n\nA staggering 22 million people tuned in to watch as Bianca married Ricky Butcher and she became known for her shouts of “Rickay!”\n\nPatsy first left EastEnders in 1999 but returned in 2008 and did another six years on the show before leaving again in 2014.\n\nShe appeared on Strictly Come Dancing in 2005 and The Masked Singer in 2020.\n\nIn February 2020, EastEnders announced she would be returning as Bianca later in the year but the scenes were cancelled due to COVID.\n\nPatsy, who is also a DJ, currently lives in Malibu with her husband Richard Merkell, a taxi driver, and three children.\n\nMost recently, she caused controversy by posting pictures of herself at a ‘freedom march’ against mandated vaccines in America. In one picture, she held a sign reading “Not anti vax WE ARE ANTI MANDATE.”\n\nNatalie Cassidy - Sonia Jackson\n\nSonia is the only original Jackson family member remaining on the show.\n\nNatalie was just ten when she made her EastEnders debut, and she famously played the trumpet so well on the show that producers asked her to play badly.\n\nShe was on the show from 1993-2007 and 2010-2011, and has remained since 2014.\n\nShe also appeared on Strictly Come Dancing in 2009.\n\nNatalie got engaged to Marc Humphreys, an EastEnders cameraman in 2014.\n\nShe has two children, Eliza, 11, and Joanie, five.\n\nEliza was recently named \"one of the best junior bakers\" in the 2021 edition of Junior Bake Off.\n\nDean Gaffney - Robbie Jackson\n\nFirst appearing as troublemaker Robbie at the age of 15, Dean was on EastEnders from 1993 to 2004, later returning in 2010, 2015 and 2017.\n\nHe appeared in I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! In 2006.\n\nBut Dean was axed from EastEnders in 2019.\n\nHe was married to Sarah Barge for 22 years but there were rumours of affairs and the couple split in 2017. They have twin daughters together, Chloe and Charlotte, who are now 25.\n\nDean also raised eyebrows when he dated a model just two years older than his twin daughters for three years.\n\nHe became a grandfather at the age of 43 last year.\n\nLindsey Coulson - Carol Jackson\n\nLindsey appeared as Carol in 1993-1997, 1999, and 2010 for EastEnders’ 25th anniversary.\n\nShe left again in 2015, saying \"I've had a fantastic time playing the formidable Carol Jackson and although I'll miss everything about EastEnders, I feel the time is right for me to move on\".\n\nShe later appeared in Clocking Off, Doctor Who, Bulletproof and The Bay.\n\nLindsey has two children with husband Harry Harris, who also happens to be Patsy Palmer’s brother.\n\nHoward Antony - Alan Jackson\n\nGiving the family their ‘Jackson’ name, Alan was mum Carol’s partner on EastEnders.\n\nAntony appeared as Alan from 1993 to 1997 and did another brief stint on the show in 2010.\n\nHe decided to leave EastEnders, apparently growing unhappy with his character’s storylines.\n\nSpeaking about Alan’s split from Carol, he said: \"I was frustrated with Alan talking so much nonsense. I thought 'Why are you investing time in Frankie when the woman you've been with for nine years wants you back?’\n\n\"As an actor it was a difficult pill to swallow”\n\nHe later starred in Doctors and The Defender and reportedly went on to become a drama teacher at a London school.\n\nDevon Anderson - Billy Jackson\n\nDevon was just six years old when he first appeared as Billy in EastEnders and he remained on the show until 1997.\n\nBilly was recast in 2004 for Sonia’s wedding but Anderson returned to reprise the role in 2010 before being killed off.\n\nDuring his break from EastEnders, Anderson appeared in the Spiceworld film as a competition winner and took on roles in Kerching!, Hollyoaks and Doctors.\n\nHis most recent television appearance was in an episode of Casualty in 2018.\n\nHe now co-hosts the Well Seasoned podcast."
