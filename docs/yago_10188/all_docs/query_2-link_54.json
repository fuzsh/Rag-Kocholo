        "text": "EastEnders welcomed back Liam Butcher on Friday night’s episode.\n\nTiffany Butcher ( Maisie Smith ) was out for drinks with adopted sister Whitney Dean ( Shona McGarty ) when the pair were surprised by a bottle of champagne being sent to their table at Ruby’s nightclub but the surprise benefactor was their brother: Liam Butcher, now played by recast actor Alfie Duggan.\n\nJust as this had occurred, Tiff’s estranged husband Keegan Baker (Zack Morris) had decided to fight for his marriage to her after having committed adultery with her friend Dotty Cotton (Milly Zero).\n\nHowever, when Keegan visited Tiff’s house to speak to her he got a shock when he found her antagonistic brother, Liam.\n\nSo, as Liam makes his big Walford comeback, just what is his history on Albert Square?\n\nWho is EastEnders' Liam Butcher?\n\nLiam Butcher made his debut as a baby on EastEnders in 1998 when he was born prematurely in the Queen Vic pub on Christmas Day to parents Ricky Butcher ( Sid Owen ) and wife Bianca Jackson ( Patsy Palmer ).\n\nWhen Bianca departed Walford in 1999, Liam left with his mother and only appeared sporadically until Bianca gave Liam to Ricky to care for and he appeared on the show with Ricky as a small child between 2002 and 2004 until they left Walford.\n\nLiam returned, played by actor James Forde, in 2008 with his mother Bianca and siblings: step-sister Whitney Dean, half-sister (later revealed to be full-sister) Tiffany Butcher, and half-brother Morgan Jackson.\n\nDuring this stint on the show, viewers saw Liam struggle at school and was diagnosed with dyslexia. He was later denied a place at Walford High secondary school but later worked hard to go to King Edward V school.\n\nHe is the witness of numerous storylines in his family, including his step-dad Tony King being exposed as sexually abusing Whitney, his uncle Billie Jackson dying by alcohol poisoning, his mother Bianca being sent to prison twice, and the departure of his dad Ricky from Walford.\n\nLiam received his biggest storyline in 2013 when he became involved in a gang as part of a storyline the show did with charity Comic Relief.\n\nNot attending school and engaging in criminal activity, Liam fell under the wing of gang leader Kane and rejected his distraught mother Bianca.\n\nEventually, Liam is blamed when the gang is arrested for their behaviour and is stabbed by Kane.\n\nDespite surviving the stabbing, Liam was scared to report on them to the police but eventually does so and his actions result in them going to prison and him feeling safe on the Square again.\n\nLiam soon falls for fellow troublesome teen Cindy Williams and the pair develop a romance, with Liam losing his virginity to Cindy.\n\nHowever, drama developed when Cindy learned she was pregnant but it was actually TJ Spraggan, the son of Bianca’s new boyfriend, who was the father.\n\nLiam also supported his grandmother Carol Jackson as she battled with breast cancer and remained in Walford despite Bianca leaving with boyfriend Terry, taking Tiff and Morgan with her.\n\nAfter pursuing a new romance with Cindy, Liam supported her when she gives her baby Beth to TJ’s family to raise.\n\nAfter giving Beth away, Cindy’s guardian Ian Beale kicked Cindy out of his house and Liam took her in.\n\nCindy then revealed a shocking truth to Liam - that Ian’s son Bobby killed Lucy Beale - prompting Ian to try and bribe the pair into leaving Walford.\n\nWhen Carol learned something more is going on, Liam and Cindy blackmailed Ian for £100,000 to stay quiet about the murder.\n\nEventually, they decide against the blackmail, and depart Walford with recurring payments from Ian's wife Jane Beale, to go and live with Ricky in Germany.\n\nSo, with Liam and Cindy having received a somewhat happy ending together, what brings him back to Walford?\n\nHere is all the latest news on Liam as actor Alfie Duggan takes on the role.\n\n*EastEnders airs on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays on BBC One with previous episodes available on BBC iPlayer."
