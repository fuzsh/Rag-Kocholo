        "text": "BIANCA Jackson remains one of EastEnders' most memorable characters.\n\nHaving been at the heart of some of the show's biggest storylines since first appearing, here is everything you need to know about her time in Albert Square.\n\nWho was Bianca Jackson on EastEnders?\n\nBianca Jackson was introduced to viewers in 1993 and quickly became a fan favourite.\n\nHer character is known for her vibrant personality, strong-willed nature, and memorable storylines.\n\nShe pulled in over 22 million viewers for her marriage to Ricky Butcher in 1997 - one of the biggest soap audiences ever.\n\nBianca stayed on the soap for another two years before leaving in 1999.\n\nShe then made a brief appearance in the 2002 special EastEnders: Ricky and Bianca, followed by a full-time return in 2008.\n\nThe character remained on the soap for another six years before leaving again in 2014.\n\nShe returned briefly in 2019.\n\nHow many children does Bianca Jackson have?\n\nBianca is the daughter of Carol Jackson and David Wicks, who both left Walford in 2014.\n\nShe’s also the granddaughter of Pat Evans, Pete Beale, Jim Branning and Reenie Branning – none of whom appear on the soap anymore.\n\nThe character has four children; Liam Butcher, Tiffany Butcher, Morgan Butcher, and adopted Whitney Dean.\n\nHow was Bianca Jackson related to Sonia on EastEnders?\n\nBiancas is the half-sister of Robbie, Joe, Karen, Sonia and Billie.\n\nTheir all share Carol as a mother from her previous relationships.\n\nWho played Bianca Jackson on EastEnders?\n\nBianca was played by actress Pasty Palmer.\n\nPatsy was born Julie Anne Harris on May 26, 1972, in Bethnal Green, London.\n\nShe made her screen debut in the television programme The Gentle Touch in 1984.\n\nLike many other EastEnders stars, Patsy appeared on Grange Hill in 1986 and 1987.\n\nShe went on to have small roles in BBC's Tricky Business (1989), Making News (1990), Clarissa (1991), Love Hurts (1992), Drop The Dead Donkey (1993), and The Bill (1993).\n\nIn 2023, Palmer took part in the fifteenth series of Dancing on Ice.\n\nShe was paired with Matt Evers and the pair were fourth to be eliminated.\n\nSpeaking on This Morning about taking part in DOI, Patsy said: “I wanted to challenge myself and get out of my comfort zone.\n\n\"I thought I'd just go for it\"\n\nWhy did Bianca Jackson leave EastEnders?\n\nPatsy explained she was leaving EastEnders to spend more time with her family and concentrate on new projects.\n\nDespite her repeated comebacks, the actress has never been afraid to criticise the soap.\n\nIn 2018, Pasty revealed she had not watched the soap for many years and that it was a \"big mistake\" to increase the number of episodes.\n\nShe told The Sun: \"I haven’t watched EastEnders for six years, so when I go back I have no idea who anyone is. There’s all new people there,\" she told The Sun.\n\n\"When I was on set I was talking to one of the writers and I said they should never have had EastEnders go three or four times a week. It was a big mistake in my book.\""
