        "text": "Name: Carol Jackson\n\nRoom: Moonbeams II\n\nBio: Hello. My name is Carol Jackson. I am originally from Chicago, but I’ve been in St. Louis long enough to call this city my home. I am a mother of a son and a daughter, five grandchildren and seven great grandchildren. I have an Associates degree in Informational processing and I have a child development associate.\n\nI was employed by District 189 for thirteen years as a Teacher’s Assistant for a federally funded program called Project Follow Through. This program was aimed at preparing children for first grade and was an intensely researched method of direct instructions. I was responsible for teaching the language component of this program and the responsible for follow up in English and math. I was lead teacher for Child Care Connection (Just us Kids and Rainbow Castle) for eighteen years with infants, six weeks to twelve months.\n\nI joined University City Children’s Center August 20, 2012 and I am in the Moonbeams II room. I feel really blessed to be part of this organization. I enjoy showing love, attention and helping them to develop trust. It is a joy to watch their faces when they learn something new, and I also learn from them. I enjoy watching their personalities emerge.\n\nMy hobbies are reading, dancing, shopping, traveling , listening to music. I am also very active in my church."
