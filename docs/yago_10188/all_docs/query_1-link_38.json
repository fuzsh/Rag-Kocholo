        "text": "Come out and enjoy an acoustic evening with Billy Dean on Friday, August 23 at 7:00 pm.\n\nClick here for more ticket information and more event information.\n\n__\n\nBilly Dean’s first big break came when he won Best Male Vocalist on Star Search, hosted by Ed McMahon. His success on the show led to his signing with Capitol Records and the release of his debut album Young Man in 1990. Buoyed by the singles “Only Here for a Little While” and “Somewhere in My Broken Heart,” Young Man became Billy’s first of many Gold records.\n\nHis second and third albums, Billy Dean and Fire in the Dark, were also certified as Gold Records and featured the Billboard-charting singles, “You Don’t Count the Cost,” “Only the Wind,” “Billy the Kid,” “If There Hadn’t Been You,” “Tryin’ to Find a Fire in the Dark,” “I Wanna Take Care of You,” “I’m Not Built That Way” and more.\n\nThroughout his 25+ year career, Billy has released 11 albums and has been recognized with several awards and nominations. In 1992, he was nominated for a Grammy for Song of the Year for “Somewhere in My Broken Heart,” which went on to win Song of the Year at the American Country Music Awards. That same year, Billy was named Top New Male Vocalist of the Year at the Academy of Country Music awards and nominated by the Country Music Association for the Horizon Award. Four years later, Billy won a Grammy for Amazing Grace, A Country Tribute to Gospel, an album featuring Martina McBride, Allison Krauss, the Charlie Daniels Band, and others. In 2017, Billy was inducted as a member of the Florida Artist Hall of Fame.\n\nA modern-day American Troubadour, Billy Dean has performed and toured with some of the industry’s biggest country music stars including the Judds, Kenny Rogers, Clint Black, Alan Jackson, Wynonna Judd, and others."
