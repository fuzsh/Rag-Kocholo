        "text": "Bumping into Kathy in the market, Sonia asked: “What’s all this?”\n\n“Your dad’s showing Billy how it’s done,” the cafe owner replied.\n\n“He’s certainly got the gift of the gab, he’s managed to wear you down,” Sonia quipped.\n\nBut Kathy pointed out Terry had managed to “wear down” Sonia too.\n\n“Yeah, I can’t wait for Bex to meet him now,” Sonia said. “Although I do have to tell mum he’s back first.”\n\nAt the beginning of the year, the nurse took some time off and flew over to India to visit Bex.\n\nWill the news of Terry’s arrival lead to Bex coming home and meeting him?\n\nAfter a long hiatus, EastEnders fans are desperate for Carol to return as one tweeted: “Bring back Carol Jackson #EastEnders.”\n\n“An #EastEnders Carol Jackson return needs to happen. Even if it's only for a few episodes,” another wrote.\n\n“Bring back Carol and Bianca right now #Eastenders,” someone else shared.\n\nEastEnders continues on BBC One on Monday at 8.05pm."
