        "text": "Carol \"Carrie\" Lynne (Wright) Jackson, 66, passed away on June 6, 2024, after a fierce battle with endometrial cancer. Carrie was born on October 7, 1957, to Helen and Kenneth Wright, in Toppenish. She was the youngest of three kids.\n\nThe family laid down roots in Union Gap when she was 6. Mom spoke fondly of her childhood in Zillah and Union Gap, and the friends she made playing in the neighborhoods growing up.\n\nShe welcomed her first child in 1976 at the age of 18, and her second in 1986. Being a young mom didn't stop her. Carrie attended the Upstairs School and graduated on time from Eisenhower, as a new mother, in 1976. She went on to attend Yakima Business College and began working for WSU Cooperative Extension, working there for 39 years, before retiring.\n\nCarrie met Jim Jackson in 2001 and asked him out for coffee, where they hit it off. They married later that year, and they've been together ever since, rarely leaving the others side. Jim was the love of her life and worked hard to give her the life she'd always wanted. Carrie most enjoyed spending time with Jim and their families, especially their grandchildren. Kids in our family always felt comfortable and safe with Carrie, and often gravitated toward her. \"Grauntie\" became a nickname adopted for her because of her dual grandma-auntie role for so many in our family. She cherished her travels to visit family in Chicago, Arizona and San Francisco.\n\nCarrie liked staying up on current events (a lifelong Democrat), chatting on the phone, cuddling her pets, buying the perfect gift or accessory for someone, giraffes, and especially Disney movies.\n\nCarrie is preceded in death by her father, Kenneth Wright. She leaves behind her husband of 22 years, Jim Jackson, mother, Helen Wright, sister, Denise Wright, brother, Mike (Debbie) Wright, son, Kenny Wright, daughter, Stephanie (Nate) Goesch, grandchildren, Tyler (Carly) Wright, Alyssa Wright (Lincoln Cash), Rainer and Rhiannon Goesch, one great-grandchild, Luke Wright, her nephew, Lamont (Janava) Wright and children, many other nieces and nephews, and her dog, Sophie.\n\nGrauntie was the cornerstone of our family. She was always ready to love and be kind first and showed us all the beauty that can come from that.\n\nPlease join us for the Celebration of Carrie's Life that will be held ono Saturday, June 29, 2024, at 1:00pm, at Shaw & Sons Funeral Home (201 N. 2nd Street, Yakima, WA).\n\nShaw & Sons Funeral Home is caring for the family. Memories and condolences can be shared at www.shawandsons.com."
