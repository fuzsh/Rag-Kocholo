        "text": "Aaron was only six years old when Andrew Jackson purchased him in 1791. Hannah was younger than 12 when she was acquired by Jackson. As was common practice, Aaron and Hannah were most likely named by their original owner and not provided with surnames. They took the surname “Jackson” following emancipation.\n\nHannah initially served as Rachel Jackson’s “personal companion;” later, she became head of the “house servants.” Aaron trained as a blacksmith, which was an important position on the plantation. The two married around 1820 and raised 10 children, all of whom lived to adulthood. Their names were Byron, Rachel, Charlotte, Moses, Mary, Martha, Abraham, Ned, Margaret Ellen and George Washington.\n\nEntrusted with The Hermitage\n\nWhile Andrew Jackson, Jr. and his wife Sarah were in Mississippi, from 1858 until 1860, they entrusted care of The Hermitage to Hannah and Aaron. Hannah was present at the death of both Rachel and Andrew Jackson.\n\nDespite the seemingly close relationship between Hannah and Aaron and the Jackson family, Hannah and her daughter Martha fled The Hermitage to Nashville to gain their freedom during the Civil War before the enslaved community had actually been freed. In Nashville, Hannah worked as a midwife and Aaron as a huckster. Aaron died in 1878, and Hannah died in 1894.\n\nOwners often crafted the personal names of their slaves to distinguish them from other enslaved individuals with the same name since they were rarely given surnames. Such was the case with Hannah (1770-1846), who was purchased along with her daughter Betty (1793-1870) by Andrew Jackson in 1794. She became “Old Hannah,” as she was nearly twice the age of “House Hannah.”\n\nOld Hannah had two more children, Squire (b. 1799) and George (b. 1800). Originally, she was the Jackson family’s cook and then cared for the poultry in her later years. Though we do not know the father(s) of her children, Old Hannah’s family grew at one time to make up more than 20 enslaved at The Hermitage.\n\nCharles Carter to Andrew Jackson, July 8, 1794. At LOC. https://www.loc.gov/item/maj023846/ Not transcribed/published in PAJ.\n\nBetty inherited the cook position from her mother in 1820. She held this position until about 1850. She was once noted for making maple syrup. Rachel brought Betty as her personal maid to Florida when Jackson was the first Military Governor there in 1821. Ned was listed as Betty’s husband in 1829, but from what is known about his age, he could not have been the father of her son, Alfred. Ned was a carpenter, but little else is known about him. He was noted in an 1867 newspaper article as being in poor health. Neither Betty nor Ned is listed on the 1870 U.S. census.\n\nBetty’s son Alfred was probably born in the First Hermitage kitchen quarters around 1812. He held various positions at The Hermitage and assisted with the horses and maintained the wagons and farm equipment. Alfred also may have been a jockey, racing some of Andrew Jackson’s thoroughbreds at local racetracks in his pre-teen years.\n\nAs a freeman, Alfred became a tenant farmer on The Hermitage. He raised food and produced a small amount of cotton and butter for sale. He also worked as a handyman and tour guide for the Ladies’ Hermitage Association when the house opened as a museum in 1889. Alfred lived at The Hermitage longer than any other person, white or black. Upon his death in 1901, his funeral was held in the center hall of the mansion surrounded by his family and members of the Ladies’ Hermitage Association, who respected him for his immense contributions to The Hermitage.\n\nAlfred is buried in The Hermitage garden, near Jackson’s tomb. Although his headstone reads “Faithful Servant of Andrew Jackson,” Alfred was enslaved under a watchful eye most of his life and lived to see his freedom.\n\nAlfred Jackson Talks to the Jackson Tutor\n\nIn 1848, Andrew Jackson, Jr. hired Roeliff Brinkerhoff to tutor his two sons and his wife’s nephews. As they walked the grounds one evening, Brinkerhoff encountered a gloomy Alfred. Alfred said to him, “You white folks have easy times, don’t you?”\n\nBrinkerhoff countered by pointing out the benefits of Alfred’s situation, such as a kind master and a pleasant home. He even told Alfred, “Freedom had its burdens, as well as slavery.”\n\nAt this, Alfred looked at Brinkerhoff and asked, “How would you like to be a slave?” Brinkerhoff had no answer.\n\nAlfred Jackson’s Family\n\nAlfred married Gracy Bradley, Sarah Jackson’s enslaved personal maid, brought from Washington D.C. following Andrew Jackson’s presidency. Accounts relate Alfred and Gracey were unofficially married in the mansion in late 1837 or early 1838. They had two children, Augustus and Sara. Following emancipation, Alfred and Gracy officially married in the mansion on April 28, 1866. A dinner followed the ceremony. By the 1880s, they had moved into a log dwelling that over time became known as Alfred’s Cabin. Gracy passed away in 1887. Gus, Sarah and their families lived in The Hermitage neighborhood/Nashville area."
