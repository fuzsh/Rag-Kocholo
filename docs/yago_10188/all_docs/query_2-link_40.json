        "text": "ST\n\nstevek2 19 February 2010 5:36pm\n\nbe funny to see the queen vic clock actually saying the same time as our clocks, if it works that is.\n\nhave you ever noticed the subtle lack of clocks on soaps, and when you see them they never have a second hand or work, they say the same time for the entire duration of a three minute scene\n\napparently they've timed the movement between the studios and the square so that character have time to actually get from A to B so we won't see anybody leave the vic then promptly appear outside and walk across the square\n\nremember the corry live episode where everybody left the rovers except for ken and Peter who stayed behind and did a scene together to give everybody else time to run from the studio onto the street set (which is a lot smaller than the eastenders lot)\n\nthey'd not be able to do an emmerdale live unless it was all indoors or outdoors\n\nthey could have done a live brookside as it was all done on the one set\n\nanyway two and a half hours to go\n\nPermalink\n\nCR\n\nCritique 19 February 2010 6:27pm\n\nIt would be nice to see a few mistakes tonight, one of the few reason's I'll be watching, and the fact that I might as well anyway, also, seeing as it'll be most likely light in the square, the clock thing won't work, as it would be dark at the time, when it'll be light on the square.\n\nPermalink"
