        "text": "EastEnders' Jackson family offered up one of the most memorable families ever to appear on the soap back in the 90’s, as they offered up their fair share of dramatic storylines.\n\nBut while some actors remain on the series to this day, many have gone on to forge some dramatic storylines of their own in real life.\n\nThe actors who played them have had their own dramas outside of the show - from scandals and co-worker relationships and stints on Strictly.\n\nREAD MORE: EastEnders legend exit 'sealed' as Ricky Jr learns he's father of pregnant Lily's baby\n\nHere’s what the EastEnders Jackson family is up to now:\n\nPatsy Palmer - Bianca Jackson\n\nShe drew in one of the show’s most-watched episodes ever when Patsy Palmer’s character, Bianca Jackson married Ricky Butcher and became known for her trademark shouts of “Rickay!”\n\nPatsy became a fan favourite when she joined the show at just 21-years-old back in 1993 before departing in 1999.\n\nShe returned in 2008 and did another six years on the show before leaving again in 2014.\n\nBianca was all set for another comeback last year for Whitney Dean’s murder trial but the Covid pandemic put a stop to that.\n\nShe has since appeared on Strictly Come Dancing in 2005 and The Masked Singer in 2020.\n\nRecently actress Patsy made headlines after storming off Good Morning Britain - via Zoom - because they mentioned her being a former addict while she was trying to plug her new business.\n\nShe later went on a rant about the show on social media.\n\nAs well as having her second child a year after her exit, she starred in animal series Battersea Dogs Home and detective drama McCready and Daughter as well as being a guest host on GMTV.\n\nPatsy now lives in Malibu, California with her husband Richard and their children Fenton, Emilia and Bertie. She has reportedly started a new career as a DJ.\n\nNatalie Cassidy - Sonia Jackson\n\nActress and long-standing cast member Natalie Cassidy was one of the youngest stars to ever appear on the series when she joined the soap at just 10-years-old playing Sonia Jackson.\n\nHer high profile storylines included her teenage pregnancy, coming out as bisexual and supporting her daughter Bex through her suicide bid.\n\nNatalie has played Sonia for three stints - 1993 to 2007. 2010 to 2011 and finally returning in 2014 for good.\n\nSonia, who is the only original Jackson family member remaining on the show, got engaged to Marc Humphreys, an EastEnders cameraman in 2014 and has two children, Eliza, 12, and Joanie, six.\n\nNatalie went on to release a best-selling fitness DVD but later admitted she regretted it because it fed into her yoyo dieting.\n\nIn 2010 she had her own Channel 4 reality series called Becoming Mum and she also appeared on Strictly Come Dancing in 2009.\n\nDean Gaffney - Robbie Jackson\n\nFirst appearing as troublemaker Robbie at the age of 15, Dean was on EastEnders from 1993 to 2004, later returning in 2010, 2015 and 2017.\n\nWhile Robbie’s on-soap behaviour saw him become a pretty big trouble maker, Dean’s off-set behaviour got him into even more trouble.\n\nHitting the headlines for partying too much, the star made a name for himself as a womaniser.\n\nHis character was written out of the soap in 2019 after Dean was found to have begged a woman for racy pics on Facebook, asking to see her \"boobs and bum\".\n\nHe said he respected the decision but branded it \"harsh\", adding: \"Sometimes in life you have to hold your hands up and admit what you've done wrong and own your s**t.\"\n\nDean has enjoyed a wild love life over the years and has boasted about bedding more than 1,000 women.\n\nDean has twin daughters, Chloe and Charlotte, from his marriage to ex-partner Sarah Barge, who Dean met when he was 15.\n\nDean allegedly had a series of affairs when he was with Sarah and their relationship fell apart after photos emerged of the actor with a hairdresser, Sasha Levy in 2007.\n\nLindsey Coulson - Carol Jackson\n\nThe matriarch of the Jackson family, actress Linda Coulson’s take on Carol saw her portray a fierce and determined mother-of-four, whose kids all had different dads.\n\nLindsey originally appeared between 1993 and 1997 then returned briefly in 1999.\n\nShe went on to have roles in Clocking Off, Judge John Deed, New Tricks and Doctor Who.\n\nHer character returned as part of the soap's 25th anniversary and was immediately given a major storyline when son Billy died of alcohol poisoning.\n\nHer high profile storylines saw affairs, the death of her son and a cancer battle.\n\nActress Lindsey quit the soap after her third stint in 2015, leaving the show behind for good.\n\nShe went on to star in The Level, Bulletproof and The Bay.\n\n“I've had a fantastic time playing the formidable Carol Jackson and although I'll miss everything about EastEnders, I feel the time is right for me to move on,\" she said at the time.\n\nShe later appeared in Clocking Off, Doctor Who, Bulletproof and The Bay.\n\nLindsey has two children with husband Harry Harris, who also happens to be Patsy Palmer’s brother.\n\nHoward Antony - Alan Jackson\n\nGiving the family their ‘Jackson’ name, Alan was mum Carol’s partner on EastEnders.\n\nAntony appeared as Alan from 1993 to 1997 and did another brief stint on the show in 2010.\n\nHe decided to leave EastEnders, apparently growing unhappy with his character’s storylines.\n\nSpeaking about Alan’s split from Carol, he said: \"There are those above me who make decisions for my character and they're not always ones I like. There were certain aspects of the Frankie story I didn't like,\" he explained.\n\n\"I was frustrated with Alan talking so much nonsense.
