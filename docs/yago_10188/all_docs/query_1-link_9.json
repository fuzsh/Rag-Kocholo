        "text": "Michael Jackson, pictured at left in 1984, is allegedly the father of singer Brandon Howard, pictured at right in a 2011 music video. The late King of Pop reportedly knew Howard's mother Miki Howard and their alleged relationship inspired the hit song \"Billie Jean.\"\n\n(The Associated Press; YouTube video still)\n\n\"Billie Jean\" is not Jacko's lover -- but she was his father's. A man claiming to be Michael Jackson's illegitimate son Thursday provided a DNA test showing the King of Pop is the biological father of 31-year-old singer Brandon Howard with 99.9 percent accuracy. Howard's mother is Miki Howard, who was nicknamed \"Billy\" in the '80s and allegedly inspired MJ's 1982 song with the line \"the kid is not my son.\" Miki's husband Augie Howard, a backup singer on \"Off the Wall,\" insists he's Brandon's father but a source claims it was neither. MJ's father Joe Jackson is now suspected of being Brandon's father, after he reportedly represented Miki in the '80s and helped her get a role in Janet Jackson's 1993 movie \"Poetic Justice.\" Actor Corey Feldman, however, told the New York Daily News he believes Brandon is MJ's son because the two look and act alike. Meanwhile, TMZ suspects the DNA test is fake, because the \"DNA Lab\" in Ireland that provided the results doesn't appear to exist. On top of that, the company's logo is identical to an image used in the movie \"Terminator: Salvation.\" Watch a 2011 music video by Howard, who performs as B Howard, and judge for yourself:\n\nIthaca native Juan Pablo Galavis' language barrier is causing problems again. This season's \"The Bachelor\" retweeted a fan on Twitter making fun of mentally handicapped people: \"Not every r----d can read, but look at you go, little buddy... you crayon eating bastard you!\" The Latin hunk tweeted \"JAJAJAJA LOVED IT\" before deleting the post and apologizing. \"In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect,\" he wrote. The drama follows his controversial comments in January when he said a gay \"Bachelor\" wouldn't work because homosexuals are more \"pervert in a sense,\" and blamed that on English as his second language too.\n\n» Read more at E! News.\n\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman's final major film has a release date: \"God's Pocket\" will open in theaters on May 9 and then be released through video on demand outlets May 14. Hoffman stars as Mickey, who tries to cover up the accidental death of his stepson Leon.

LiLo was promoting her upcoming OWN reality show when Fallon asked her to play a modified version of the card game War -- whoever wins each hand gets to dump ice cold water on the loser. Fallon got Lohan wet first, but she ultimately won thanks to the power of Oprah.\n\nMore Buzz:\n\n» Duke porn star Belle Knox tells Piers Morgan she loves what she's doing (DMail)\n\n» Kanye West, Big Sean, Rick Ross make surprise appearance on 'Arsenio' (ET)\n\n» Linkin Park release new single 'Guilty All the Time' featuring rapper Rakim (MTV)\n\n» Bruce Springsteen documentary 'High Hopes' coming to HBO April 4 (Billboard)\n\n» Jared Leto on Jennifer Lawrence: \"I'm starting to wonder if it's all an act' (E!)\n\n» Ashton Kutcher: Being a one-night stand guy is 'a little gross' (NY Daily News)\n\n» 'The Jungle Book' live action film signs on Idris Elba as Shere Khan (SlashFilm)\n\n» Before she was famous: Lupita Nyong'o starred in racy Kenyan soap opera (DM)\n\n» Marvel releases 4 minutes of 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' (BuzzFeed)\n\n» How to make Rust Cohle's beer can men for a 'True Detective' finale party (Esq)\n\n» Whitney Houston's daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown poses in a tiny bikini (E!
