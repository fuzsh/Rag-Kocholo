        "text": "Poor David Platt. This is not a sentiment you hear very often. Or will ever read again, come to that. But the predicaments blighting the Coronation Street rebel without t'cause are myriad.\n\nHe has lost the love of his life, Tina – the hottest fox in soap. He is working for his gran, in the least fashionable \"hurr salun\" in Manchester. And he is living with his mum – Gail, a simpering, smothering harridan with the facial expression of a pigeon sucking a lemon.\n\nNow he also has to cope with the unusual emotion of being wracked with guilt having run over his best/only friend, Graeme. (Clumsy!)\n\nDavid claimed he lost consciousness and – for once – it seems he was telling the truth. To his considerable dismay, he has been diagnosed with epilepsy (or \"ep-ull-ep-ser\" as Audrey calls it).\n\nNow, it's always commendable when a soap picks up an issue about which to educate the public. But speaking as someone who has been prone to this type of blackout himself, I can't say David Platt would have been my first choice as poster boy for the condition. He is, after all, evil incarnate. Plus, it's unfair. Malaria gets Cheryl Cole. Alzheimer's has Terry Pratchett. And I am now faced with the prospect of people asking, \"Oh, you've got epilepsy? What, like DAVID PLATT?\" Thanks!\n\nElsewhere, the countdown to The Big Cull – in which several characters are due to be culled – is underway.\n\nPersonally, I have high hopes that Ashley the Smurf butcher will go, along with wife Claire, Lloyd's erotic dancer friend Mona Lisa, and John Stape, the greasy teacher embroiled in a ludicrous never-ending story about adopting the identity of Colin Fishwick.\n\nA \"C\"-shaped wreath has mysteriously been left on the steps at Underworld – where Stape disposed of Colin's body.\n\n\"C for Carla?\" wondered Maria.\n\n\"Well I can't think of anything else,\" said Michelle.\n\nI could. Actually, this made quite a good game – better than watching the actual episode. I thought of cancer, Conservatives, Chelsea, carrots. In fact, all the worst things in life begin with C.\n\nHappily, Becky's irritating sister Kylie is moving to Ayia Napa, now that she has found love with the latest of Corrie's Funny Foreigners, Dimitri.\n\n\"Hello, nice to meet you,\" Dimitri grinned. \"How do you it? Yes, I do it very well too.\"\n\nAny hopes that Kylie's annoying son Max is going with her though have been foiled by Steve and Becky's plan to buy him – for a ridiculously pricy £20,000.\n\nThere are so many children in soap nowadays, I'm tempted to have a whip round to make sure Kylie takes him with her.\n\nJanine has the right idea. Last night in EastEnders, she abducted Stacey's \"bay-bay\" – the second time Lily has gone missing (a New Personal Best for a soap baby). \"And how are you thinking of getting Lily to France without a passport ?!\" demanded Ryan, who woz officially Gob-Smacked. \"We can stick her in the boot,\" Janine shrugged. \"This is ridiculous !\" Ryan cried. \"I agree!\" screamed Juneeeeen. Well, it is EastEnders.\n\nIt's been a miserable time even by Walford's standards. Billy Mitchell struck out with a woman who called him \"skidmark\". Phil has – tragically – stopped taking crack, the most entertaining thing on TV this year, like watching a cross between Mr Baxter from Grange Hill and Smee from Peter Pan getting off his face.\n\nAs expected, the Kat & Alfie Show has taken over – with Shane Richie building every line of dialogue into two minutes of sweaty \"Cor blimey guv'nor\" patter and Jessie Wallace looking like Ting Tong from Little Britain and cackling at the end of every sentence.\n\nThen there was the sudden – and inexplicable – death of peripheral character Billie Jackson, who has contributed more dead than he did when he was either a junior gang banger or when he – somewhat surprisingly – joined the army.\n\nMostly, his death was a storyline for Billie's muvver Lindsey Coulson to get her teeth into. This involved much sobbing and wailing, a flirtation with suicide involving pills and vodka (the sign of the devil in this show) and a failed attempt to cop off with Billie's mate, Connor.\n\nConnor and his mates turned up for the funeral on their BMXs wearing baseball caps and hoodies with red bandannas over their faces. They looked like The Warriors if they were taking part in the Tour de France and about as menacing as Blazin' Squad. A suitably laughable send off.\n\nThe best acting and stories are in Emmerdale – home of dissolute alcohol-swilling teenagers, pensioners in funny hats, farmers with alarming facial hair, and gun-toting murderers. And that's just the women. Emmerdale also has the most exciting lovers in soap – Cain and Charity Dingle, the Burton and Taylor of t'Woolpack. This week, Cain has been entertaining himself (and us) by getting out his toolbox and re-enacting the torture scene from Reservoir Dogs, keeping his victim bound and gagged in a barn (where else?)\n\n\"This takes the flaming biscuit!\" flounced Charity, his kissing cousin. It all served to resolve the murder of Mark Wylde – a tale of adultery, bigamy, incest, and Jersey farming. \"I fell in love with my own brother!\" wailed Maisie, one of the statistically improbable bevy of semi-naked beauties who live in the village. \"Everything started to unravel after that,\" agreed her mum, Amanda Donohoe, the real killer.\n\n\"The family that kills together, stays together eh?\" smirked Cain.\n\nHe's not wrong."
