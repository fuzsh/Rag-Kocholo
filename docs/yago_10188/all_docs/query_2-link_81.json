She loved seafood, the Ravens and family cookouts. She was an outstanding cook. She was known for her famous quiches and a variety of other dishes. Her cheerful demeanor and kind spirit made her a motherly figure to everyone, always looking out for others.\n\nCarol had a kind spirit. She was humble and had a sweet nature about her. She will be dearly missed by all who knew her. She was a true friend and a child of God."
