        "text": "The actress' mother, the late Carrie Fisher, played Princess Leia in the famed film series\n\nThe force is as strong as ever in the late Carrie Fisher‚Äôs family!\n\nDaughter Billie Lourd celebrated Star Wars Day on Saturday, May 4, by sharing two photos of herself and her 1-year-old daughter, Jackson Joanne, holding a lightsaber together at Savi‚Äôs Workshop inside Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California.\n\n‚Äú‚ìÇÔ∏èüÖ∞Ô∏èüå± ‚úùÔ∏è‚ôäÔ∏èüìß 4Ô∏è‚É£‚úùÔ∏è‚ôäÔ∏è,‚Äù the actress, 31, captioned her Instagram post. She and husband Austen Rydell are also parents to son Kingston Fisher, 3.\n\nLourd previously marked the annual fan holiday in 2023 by sharing a photograph of her mom, who died in 2016 at the age of 60, during her posthumous Hollywood Walk of Fame induction.\n\nRelated: Billie Lourd Shares Emotional Tribute to Mom Carrie Fisher 7 Years After Death: 'She Is with Me Every Day'\n\nLourd, who starred as Lieutenant Connix alongside her mom as Princess Leia in the Star Wars sequel films, told PEOPLE a day before May the 4th which film in the franchise is her favorite.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to say Empire [Strikes Back],‚Äù Lourd said. ‚ÄúEmpire was my mom‚Äôs favorite movie, and I think it‚Äôs mine. But A New Hope is so classic, too. And [Return of the] Jedi ‚Äî it‚Äôs Jabba! I have to follow suit with my mom, and that was her favorite. I think it was her favorite to do and [just] her favorite.‚Äù\n\nRelated: Billie Lourd and Mom Carrie Fisher Share Same 'Favorite' Star Wars Film: 'I Have to Follow Suit!' (Exclusive)\n\nIn December, Lourd paid tribute to Fisher on the seventh anniversary of her death with a throwback photo shared on Instagram.\n\n‚ÄúIt has been 7 years since my mom died (but who‚Äôs counting?? Me I guess?) Every anniversary brings a different iteration of my grief,‚Äù she wrote in her caption. ‚ÄúSome infuse me with rage, some make me cry all day long, some make me feel dissociated and empty, some make me feel nothing, some make me feel guilty for feeling nothing, and some make me feel all of those things all at once.‚Äù\n\nNever miss a story ‚Äî sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n‚ÄúThis year, when I woke up I felt grateful ‚Äî or griefull, if you will,‚Äù Lourd continued. ‚ÄúGrief has infused my life with a sense of appreciation I had never had before. It makes me soak up every moment of joy as if it were my last.‚Äù\n\nRelated: The Sweetest Photos of Carrie Fisher Behind the Scenes on' Star Wars'\n\nShe added: ‚ÄúToday I was holding my daughter while she was napping in my arms and my eyes welled up with tears of joy. I laughed at myself then cried more ‚Äôcause I was laughing. I felt my momby's presence like the warmth of the sun on your skin on a hot summer day. The kind of warmth where you unknowingly close your eyes and take a slow breath through your nose and grin.‚Äù\n\nLourd also shared at the time how she tells her two children about Fisher.\n\n‚ÄúI miss her every day but the cliche is also true ‚Äî she is with me every day ‚Äî she infuses my joyful moments with even more joy,‚Äù she concluded. ‚ÄúAs I tell my son, she lives in the stars ‚Äî and she damn sure makes my life sparkle. Sending my love to all my griefers out there. And hoping everyone can feel a little sparkle of griefull among all the feelings grief inevitably brings.‚Äù\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
