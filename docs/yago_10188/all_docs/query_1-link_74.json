In English, the name means ‘strength’ or ‘determination.’ It is also believed to be a diminutive or feminine version of the English name William. William, in turn, is taken from the German name “Willehelm,” which is a combination of the elements “willo,” meaning ‘will’ or ‘desire’ and “helm,” meaning ‘helmet’ or ‘protection.’ The name, therefore, means ‘resolute protector’ in German.\n\nBillie is also a surname in certain cultures or regions. As a family name, it could be a variant of the Czech and Slovakian names Bílý, Bilý, Bíly, and Billý or the anglicized version of the Russian and Ukrainian name Bily.
