        "text": "Initially joining the Jackson Five as a percussionist, Marlon became complimentary dancer to Michael and lead vocalist during the Motown years, as well as heartthrob to many female fans during the 80âs.\n\nOn the heels of writing the iconic 80âs song, âBodyâ with The Jacksons, he released one solo album in 1987 called Baby Tonight.\n\nNine out of ten songs were written and (co) produced by Marlon himself! His wife Carol can be heard on many songs, and on one song (\"Life\"), their three children can be heard as well. Marlon's single âDonât Goâ climbed to second place in the US Top R& B charts.\n\nBy the 1990s, Marlon began to pursue multiple business ventures. He founded the Major Broadcasting Cable (MBC) Network in 1999, in Atlanta with Alvin James, which was the first minority-owned and operated cable network. Marlon and his business partners brought the network to more than 15 million homes in a three-year span. In 2004, the network became known as the Black Family Channel and was sold in 2007.\n\nIn 2008, Marlon and two business partners founded The Motherland Group, LLC. The Motherland Group, LLC is the first African-American owned company to bring awareness and recognition to the ancient city of Badagry, located forty miles Northwest of Lagos, Nigeria. As President and CEO, Marlon drives the vision âto develop a historical resort for travel, education, and tourism,â unparalleled in the tourism industry today.\n\nContinuing his philanthropic and humanitarian efforts, Marlon and wife, Carol, established the Direct Community Assistance Program in 1990. As part of this mandate, his family prepares and distributes meals to the homeless in San Diegoâs downtown district on a weekly basis.\n\nMarlon started The Marlon Jackson Study Peace Foundation in 2015 to promote peace and unity in communities worldwide. Study Peace Foundation creates new programs designed to engage young people and adults to live in peaceful environments.\n\nMarlon is working on a special documentary tentatively called The Man, The Music, The Mystery, \"about a guy who was one of the greatest managers and managed one of the greatest bands in the world but never got the recognition. And his name happens to be Joseph Jackson,\" Marlon said, about the late Jackson patriarch."
