        "text": "Billie Origin and Meaning\n\nThe name Billie is a girl's name of English origin meaning \"resolute protection\".\n\nBillie is a tomboy nickname name, part of the growing trend for using boyish nicknames for girls and now destined for stardom along with its most famous contemporary bearer, music sensation Billie Eilish.\n\nTo track its path from blue to pink, Billie was 100% male in 1880, was 55% female just a decade later, in the girls' Top 100 by 1928, and is now overwhelmingly female.\n\nBillie is a possible retro choice for fans of jazz great Billie Holiday, born Eleanora, and a very contemporary choice for teen singer Billie Eilish -- born Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell. Other conceivable namesakes are The Wizard of Oz's Glinda--Billie Burke (born Mary William), silent screen star Billie Dove (born Bertha), actresses Billie Whitelaw and Billie Piper (born Lianne) and tennis legend Billie Jean King (born Billie). Another cultural reference is the Michael Jackson hit song 'Billie Jean.'"
