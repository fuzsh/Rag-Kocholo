        "text": "Lourd has other reasons to celebrate, too. Her movie Ticket to Paradise (2022) has proven a smash hit on Netflix, and she was recently cast in Alex Winter’s “modern noir”, Adulthood. She will also be starring in Gia Coppola’s The Last Showgirl alongside Pamela Anderson.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about Billie Lourd, the glamorous mum of two and only grandchild of Hollywood royalty Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher.\n\nBillie Lourd followed her mum Carrie Fisher into the Star Wars world\n\nFun fact: the cast and crew didn’t even know she was Fisher’s daughter until she slipped up one day and called her “mum” on set.\n\nBillie Lourd and Austen Rydell made sure Billie’s late mum was included in their wedding\n\nThe American Horror Story star first met her now husband in 2011 at NYU, per Vogue, but they didn’t start dating until 2016. The pair broke up for a time, but reconnected in 2017 and had their first child, Kingston Fisher Lourd Rydell, in 2020, per People. Two years later, they got married and welcomed their second child, Jackson Joanne Lourd Rydell.\n\nShe decided to ditch bras like her mum\n\nIn 2022, Lourd told People that she wasn’t a fan of her mum going about her day not wearing a bra, but has since reconsidered her stance: “I used to get mad at my mum for not wearing a bra. And now I sometimes don’t have the energy to put on a bra.” She added that, in retrospect, her mum was probably just too tired to put on a bra, and she now questions why her younger self was “hating on her for it”?\n\nShe doesn’t have a relationship with her aunts and uncle\n\nJoely Fisher, her aunt, had posted on Instagram ahead of the occasion that for “some bizarre, misguided reason, our niece has chosen not to include us in this epic moment in our sister’s career”. Similarly, Todd Fisher, Lourd’s uncle, shared with TMZ that it was “heartbreaking and shocking” to be “intentionally omitted”.\n\nHowever, Lourd clapped back in a statement saying, “The truth is I did not invite them to this ceremony. They know why.” She added that her mum’s siblings “chose to process their grief publicly and capitalise on my mother’s death, by doing multiple interviews and selling individual books for a lot of money”. However, “to be clear – there is no feud. We have no relationship”.\n\nShe loves introducing her kids to their cinematic family history\n\nNeither Lourd’s mother nor her grandmother, Debbie Reynolds, were alive to see her have children of her own. However, the Booksmart actress is still making sure that they are a part of her kids’ lives.\n\n“I feel so lucky that even though they won’t get to meet my mum, they will get to know a piece of her through Leia,” she said in her speech as her mother was posthumously honoured with her “long overdue” star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nEarlier this year, she also watched Reynolds’ iconic movie musical Singin’ in the Rain (1952) with her son Kingston, and shared the precious moment on her Instagram Stories."
