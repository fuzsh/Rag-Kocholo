        "text": "Sometimes it feels like a nice touch, and a choice that the characters would realistically make. Such as Peter and Lucy being named after Pete and Lou, Martin naming his son Arthur, Sharon naming her son Dennis.\n\nI agree the weird ones are like Peggy Taylor - Louise and Peggy were hardly close. Abi Branning Jnr has never quite sat right either.\n\nHayley naming her daughter Cherry after Alfie's dead mum was an odd one as well.\n\n2\n\nIt feels overdone because it comes with the businesses named after, the benches named after, and so on.\n\nIn real life people do name things after relatives, and you do often sit down on a park bench or a riverside bench, a beachfront bench, to find it dedicated to ‘Margaret, who loved this park’ or ‘John, who loved this view and led the 1986 campaign to keep our beach pristine’ or whatever. It’s the onslaught in soap that makes it stand out, and then on top of the tribute names (Peggy’s) and the punning play on word names (Beale’s Anything, Angies Den), there are babies named after grans nickname. It feels a bit much.\n\nIt’s probably not unrealistic. Lots of people are named after a grandparent, either as their name or a middle name.\n\nIt could be worse - at least the Brits haven’t followed the pretentious American habit of naming people things like John Smith III. Maybe the downside of not having royalty is that everyone thinks they’re royalty, even while pretending to disavow anything associated with it, while telling you they’re called ‘John Smith III’. Unless you personally knew or at least know of John Smith I and John Smith II, it’s meaningless pretension.\n\n0\n\nCorrie of course used to have Bet Lynch, Betty Turpin and Liz McDonald all derivatives of Elizabeth.\n\nKevin Wester has had two girlfriends called Molly.\n\nMike Baldwin and Michael Rodwell/Rodwin or whatever Gail's partner was called\n\nLuke Strong and Luke Britton\n\nBeth Sutherland and Bethany Platt\n\nBrookside is the only time I can think of two people with the same name\n\nAnd two lots of two people too! The two Jackies, then Mike Dixon and Mick Johnson.\n\nCorrie even changed Alex (as in Michelle’s long lost son) to Ali so he wouldn’t be like the occasional character who worked in the cafe.\n\n(Appreciate they’re not named after people, but the thread has gone off in a tangent)\n\nMick and Mike are different names though. Jacqui and Jackie are spelled differently but sound the same. I can't think of any other occasion with two so characters with the \"same\" name.\n\nJacqui and Jackie are different derivatives of Jacqueline, so really the same just like Phill and Phil or Sue and Su.\n\nYep, but if you knew a Mick and a mike, you could say you're going to meet Mick and people would know who you're going to see. If you knew a Jackie and a Jacqui and said you were off to meet \"Jackie\" people wouldn't know who.\n\nI can't think of any other instance of two characters having the same name. Even bet/Betty and Liz are very different names.\n\n0\n\nCorrie of course used to have Bet Lynch, Betty Turpin and Liz McDonald all derivatives of Elizabeth.\n\nKevin Wester has had two girlfriends called Molly.\n\nMike Baldwin and Michael Rodwell/Rodwin or whatever Gail's partner was called\n\nLuke Strong and Luke Britton\n\nBeth Sutherland and Bethany Platt\n\nBrookside is the only time I can think of two people with the same name\n\nAnd two lots of two people too!

When was the last little girl or baby Jacqueline/Jackie you met?\n\nThere were two in my class - one with a unique spelling I recall - something like Jacklyn, which she corrected me on when I gave her a Christmas card with it written the normal way. It seems to be a very 20th century name - probably very modern, unusual, glamorous in the 20’s and 30’s, peaked in the 60’s for obvious reasons, then tapered down through the 70’s and 80’s. Since then, virtually none. Surely due for a revival any year now.\n\n0\n\nCorrie of course used to have Bet Lynch, Betty Turpin and Liz McDonald all derivatives of Elizabeth.\n\nKevin Wester has had two girlfriends called Molly.\n\nMike Baldwin and Michael Rodwell/Rodwin or whatever Gail's partner was called\n\nLuke Strong and Luke Britton\n\nBeth Sutherland and Bethany Platt\n\nBrookside is the only time I can think of two people with the same name\n\nAnd two lots of two people too!

Jack is obviously popular now, but like you, I can't imagine a boy being called Jackie now\n\nI can imagine it for a boy more than a girl in the 2020’s. For a boy it’s kind of cute and unusual. For a girl it used to be glamorous, classic but casual, associations with style and Onassis level money, and will be back again no doubt, but isn’t right now. I can’t imagine Jacqueline or its derivatives have appeared on many female birth certificates since the 80’s.\n\n0"
