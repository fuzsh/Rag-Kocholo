        "text": "Bianca Jackson is still one of the most iconic characters to ever grace EastEnders' Albert Square and she even has one of the most recognisable lines, “RICKAYYYY”.\n\nShe first arrived in Walford 30 years ago, so here's what the Walford resident and soap star is doing now.\n\nWho is Patsy Palmer?\n\nPatsy, whose real name is Julie Anne Merkel, is well known for her big break when she joined the cast of EastEnders in 1993.\n\nHowever she has been acting since 1983 and starred in The Bill, The Catherine Tate Show and Grange Hill as Natasha between 1985 and 1987.\n\nWho was Patsy Palmer in EastEnders?\n\nShe portrayed mouthy Bianca Jackson, and oh, how we miss her.\n\nWhat happened to Bianca Jackson?\n\nWhat didn't happen to Bianca?\n\nAfter she arrived in Albert Square in 1993, she flirted and tried to kiss David Wicks but then discovered that he's her biological father. She had an affair with Dan Sullivan - aka her mum's fiancé - and had a turbulent relationship with Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen).\n\nBianca left Walford in 1999 but three years later, she had a one night stand with Ricky and fell pregnant with Tiffany Butcher- although, Ricky was unaware of his second child.\n\nShe then returned to Walford in 2008 with her stepdaughter Whitney Dean, Liam Butcher, Tiffany and Morgan Jackson-King.\n\nShe discovered that her fiancé Tony King was a paedophile and had been sexually abusing Whitney, she grieved after her brother Billie Jackson died from alcohol poisoning and was arrested after attacking Connor Stanley (Billie's best friend) who had an affair with Carol.\n\nShe briefly returned in 2019 to attend Whitney and Callum Highway's (Tony Clay) disastrous wedding. The last we heard of Bianca, she and her mum Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) visited Tiffany in Germany.\n\nDid Ricky and Bianca end up together?\n\nUnfortunately, despite their love overcoming a lot, including affairs and getting married twice, Ricky and Bianca didn’t get their happy ever after. Although we think they were always meant to be.\n\nIs Patsy Palmer returning to EastEnders?\n\nWhen she appeared on The One Show in January 2023, she was asked whether she would return and she said, \"We have a job to do currently on Sunday [Dancing on Ice[... so.”\n\nIt was a bit awkward, to say the least, so we don’t think she’s in a hurry to go back to Albert Square.\n\nWhat is Patsy Palmer doing now?\n\nAfter quitting EastEnders to 'crack Hollywood', Patsy has a boujee life in LA, she's a DJ, hangs out with Luca Bish and she's launched her wellness brand Good and Proper Hair.\n\nPatsy has also appeared on Strictly Come Dancing (which was for Children in Need in 2005), The Masked Singer and Dancing on Ice.\n\nHow old is Patsy Palmer?\n\nPatsy is 51 years old. She was born on 26 May 1972.\n\nIs Patsy Palmer married?\n\nYes, she has been married to her husband Richard Merkell since 2000.\n\nShe was previously married to film director Nick Love.\n\nDoes Patsy Palmer have social media?\n\nShe sure does. You can follow her on Instagram @patsypalmerofficial. She also has Twitter@patsypalmerx."
