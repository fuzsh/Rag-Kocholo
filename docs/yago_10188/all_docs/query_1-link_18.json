        "text": "The King of Pop’s kids are all grown up.\n\nMichael Jackson welcomed three children before his death.\n\nThe “Thriller” singer became a dad in February 1997 when his then-wife, Debbie Rowe, gave birth to son Prince followed by daughter Paris in April 1988.\n\nAfter the former couple divorced in April 2000, a surrogate gave birth to Michael’s son Blanket in February 2002.\n\nThe legendary performer died of acute propofol intoxication in June 2009. He was 50 years old.\n\nPrince and Blanket celebrated what would have been Michael’s 65th birthday in August 2023 with a rare joint appearance in Las Vegas, while Paris said via her Instagram Stories that she “owe[s] everything” to her late father.\n\nMeet the members of Michael’s family below.\n\nMichael Joseph “Prince” Jackson Jr.\n\nWhen Prince, whose real name is also Michael, was born in February 1997, Macaulay Culkin and Elizabeth Taylor became his godparents.\n\nIn a statement at the time, the new dad gushed, “Words can’t describe how I feel. … I have been blessed beyond comprehension, and I will work tirelessly at being the best father that I can possibly be.”\n\nThe “Billie Jean” singer had custody of Prince and Paris following his and Rowe’s split. The siblings, along with Blanket, lived with their grandmother Katherine Jackson after Michael’s death.\n\nPrince received a degree in business administration from Loyola Marymount University in May 2019. While a student there, he co-founded the Heal Los Angeles charity with a friend.\n\nThe motorcycle aficionado, who often makes YouTube videos about his rides, honored his late dad with a massive calf tattoo in April 2017.\n\n“I don’t think it’s anything you ever get over,” he told the Los Angeles Times of his grief the previous year. “It’s always going to be a part of your life that’s missing.”\n\nParis-Michael Katherine Jackson\n\nRowe gave birth to Paris in April 1998, with the model giving rare insight into their mother-daughter relationship during a 2021 “Red Table Talk” appearance.\n\n“It’s just cool having her as a friend,” she said. “It’s very chill, which I love. That’s the perfect word to describe it.”\n\nParis has followed in her dad’s musical footsteps by being a member of several bands and releasing multiple EPs and one full-length album. She also has pursued modeling and acting with roles in “American Horror Story” and other projects.\n\nIn addition to her career milestones, Paris has made headlines for her mental health struggles.\n\nThe actress told Rolling Stone in 2015 that she attempted suicide “multiples times” before the age of 15. She was hospitalized again that same year and sought treatment in 2019.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nAs for her love life, Paris chose not to label her sexuality in a 2020 “Unfiltered” episode, saying she has “dated more than just men and women.”\n\nPrince “Blanket” Michael Jackson II\n\nBlanket was born via gestational carrier in February 2002 — and started going by the name Bigi in 2015.\n\nTwo years later, Katherine surrendered guardianship of the “Beat It” singer’s youngest child, and he was subsequently looked after by his cousin Tito Joe “TJ” Jackson."
