        "text": "Having famous parents must definitely be a trip, but for some celebrity kids, their extended family includes even more famed individuals — including these famous kids who were bestowed with celebrity godparents.\n\nPerhaps the most well-known celebrity kid-godparent duo is Miley Cyrus and Dolly Parton, but did you know that the iconic director Steven Spielberg is godfather to not one but two ultra-famous actresses who are icons in their own right? Or that Marisa Tomei and Lisa Bonet‘s friendship, developed on the set of the 1980s sitcom A Different World, has turned into a lifelong bond that includes Tomei being godmother to all three of Bonet’s kids?\n\nThe most recent major celeb godparent news is the bombshell dropped in Netflix’s Harry & Meghan: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry asked Tyler Perry to be their daughter’s godfather after they forged an extremely special bond during the Sussexes’ incredibly intense departure from the royal family and the UK at large.\n\nThe three had never spoken until Perry reached out to Meghan ahead of her nuptials to Harry in 2018, and although they were but acquaintances at the time of the Sussexes’ move to North America in 2020, Perry offered them his home when they needed a safe place to stay during the COVID-19 pandemic, away from the constant intrusion of paparazzi. They’ve remained extremely close ever since, and that closeness reached its peak after Lilibet Diana’s arrival in 2021.\n\nRetelling the story for the docuseries, Perry explained that he, Meghan, and Harry frequently check in with each other: “We’ll call and we’ll chat and we’ll talk about silly things, but [during one call] they were pretty serious on the phone and I go, ‘Okay, what’s going on?’ They said, ‘Well, we’d like for you to be Lili’s godfather.’ I go, ‘Whoa.’ I had to take a minute to take that in,” Perry shared. “And I thought, ‘I’d be honored. I’d be absolutely honored.'”\n\nHe (semi) jokingly added, “I got off the phone, took it all in, and then called them back, and I go, ‘Uh, hold on a second — does that mean we gotta go over there and do all of that in the church with [the royal family] and figure that all out, because I don’t wanna do that. Maybe we can do a little private ceremony here and let that be that, and if you have to do it there, then that’s okay.”\n\nFrom Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Lee Curtis to Nicole Richie and Michael Jackson, read on for more famous godparent-kid connections.\n\nA version of this story was published in January 2023."
