In that sense, \"sport\" is an endearment for someone of good nature.\n\nStand By MeBen E.

They put it in hot rotation right away, making the song even more popular.\n\nMy WayFrank Sinatra\n\nAccording to Frank Sinatra's daughter, he hated \"My Way,\" but had to sing it at every show when it became his signature song.\n\nVideo GamesLana Del Rey\n\nThe game Lana Del Rey sings about in \"Video Games\" is World of Warcraft - her ex used to play it all the time.\n\nRick AstleySongwriter Interviews\n\nRick Astley on \"Never Gonna Give You Up,\" \"Cry For Help,\" and his remarkable resurgence that gave him another #1 UK album.\n\nSongs About MoviesSong Writing\n\nIron Maiden, Adele, Toto, Eminem and Earth, Wind & Fire are just some of the artists with songs directly inspired by movies - and not always good ones.\n\nChrissie Hynde of The PretendersSongwriter Interviews\n\nThe rock revolutionist on songwriting, quitting smoking, and what she thinks of Rush Limbaugh using her song.\n\nWho's Johnny, And Why Does He Show Up In So Many SongsSong Writing\n\nFor songwriters, Johnny represents the American man. He has been angry, cool, magic, a rebel and, of course, marching home."
