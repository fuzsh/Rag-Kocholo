        "text": "Lindsey Coulson is \"proud\" to have been part of the first mixed-race couple on 'EastEnders'.\n\nLindsey Coulson\n\nThe 60-year-old star's character Carol Jackson was married to Alan Jackson (Howard Antony) in the 90s, and the pair have son Billie Jackson (Devon Anderson) together, and she is pleased to have been a part of the \"breakthrough moment\".\n\nShe said: \"I am proud to have been part of the first mixed race couple on 'EastEnders'. That was quite a breakthrough moment in the 90s.\"\n\nLindsey's latest 'EastEnders' stint came to an end in 2015 and she is now working with Noel Clarke and Ashley Walters on 'Bulletproof' - portraying Sarah Tanner - and the star also feels \"proud\" to work alongside the pair.\n\nShe added: \"I've got a lot of respect for them and I think they have for me. They are individuals who've really had to push their way through this industry.\n\n\"It's been hard for them as two young black men, but they've got so much integrity. I'm proud to be on a show with two black men as the leads, but also because they are two wonderful human beings.\"\n\nBut it doesn't look like Carol will be back in Albert Square anytime soon, as Lindsey admitted she doesn't have any desire to learn \"that amount of lines again\".\n\nShe added to OK! magazine: \"It was the right time to leave because I'd done everything that was true to that character.\n\n\"I enjoy my life now and I don't want to go back to that pace. I don't want to be learning that amount of lines again.\""
