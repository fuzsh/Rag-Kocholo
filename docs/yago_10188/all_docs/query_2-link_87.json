        "text": "Patsy Palmer is set to dazzle Albert Square once more as she reclaims her role as Bianca Jackson in EastEnders. The 52-year-old star, who first appeared as the fiery Bianca in 1993 and has since taken on multiple comebacks, is scheduled for another return to Albert Square this year, setting the stage for a thrilling encounter with her on-screen father David Wicks (played by Michael French), who is also poised for a Walford comeback.\n\nThe soap's official account broke the news, sharing an image of Patsy clad in Bianca's signature look and revealing, \"Albert Square is set to get a whole lot noisier in the coming months as Bianca Jackson returns to Walford once again, but unbeknownst to her, dad David Wicks is also hot on her tail... #EastEnders\".\n\nBianca's first foray into the lives of Walford residents was back in 1993 and after Patsy's initial exit in 1999, she made a triumphant return in 2008, sticking around for six years. In 2019, she popped back into view for Whitney's almost-wedding to Callum Highway (Tony Clay) and was meant to come back in 2020 but Covid-19 put those plans on hold.\n\nREAD MORE: ITV Good Morning Britain fans rush to 'switch off' as they issue complaint over Katie Price coverage\n\nREAD MORE: GMB's Ed Balls replacement 'confirmed' after deluge of Ofcom complaints\n\nHowever, earlier this year she did make an appearance, with her character Bianca being the one to suspect Sonia Fowler's (Natalie Cassidy) partner Reiss Colwell (Jonny Freeman) had ulterior motives, though her concerns were dismissed at the time, leading to a spiral of events after her departure in June.\n\nAfter the news was announced fans immediately took to social media platform X to share their thoughts. One person wrote: \"This will be fun,\" while a second said: \"It makes sense her to return with David returning soon but I also wish that Carol could return.\"\n\nIn relation to Michael French's return, he expressed last month his \"honoured\" sentiment about reprising his role as David after 10 years. In a recent statement he expressed his gratitude: \"I feel honoured to be asked to reprise the role of David Wicks once again. It may only be a brief visit, but we know from his past that David never fails to create a lot of drama in a very short time.\"\n\nAs EastEnders approaches its 40th anniversary milestone, showrunners are excited for the return of the \"legendary\" figure. Chris Clenshaw, the executive producer, couldn't hide his enthusiasm: \"David Wicks is undoubtedly one of EastEnders' most beloved rogues, and we are thrilled to welcome the talented Michael French back to the legendary role as we lead up to the show's 40th anniversary.\""
