She worked at the Victoria General, the IWK, Cloverdale Infusion Clinics and most recently with Public Health.\n\nCarol loved animals, especially cats. She rescued three strays, Jack, Joey and Fluffy, and brought them into her comfortable loving home. She loved gardening, going to the beach, traveling, crafts, quilting, baking and was quite handy with most power tools. She also loved sports, especially hockey and baseball.
