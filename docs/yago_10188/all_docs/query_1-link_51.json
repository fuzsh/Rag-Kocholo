        "text": "Larger-than-life gender reveals can be traced back to at least 2008 — a blogger seems to have come up with the idea and it took off.\n\nShe regrets it now, but she might get a kick out of this one.\n\nCouple Uses John Deer Excavator for Gender Reveal Assist\n\nThere are a few epic things at play here: There's the pregnant woman, of course, her man with a beer in hand, a giant John Deere excavator and even a dog. It's got all the makings of a great country song.\n\nThe video starts out with the couple standing in front of the huge excavator — you can hear the crowd already yelling and excited, even before the excavator moves an inch.\n\nThen, it starts: The excavator, with its bucket up in the air, filled with a powder — either blue or pink – begins a fast 360-degree turn. The bucket of the excavator passes overhead once and creates an edge-of-your-seat moment.\n\nThe big reveal happens on the second go-round: The bucket drops blue powder over their heads!\n\nIt's to be noted that the man does not ever drop his beer throughout the chaos of the reveal.\n\nHe does, however, go into a quarterback position, as if he's taking a snap from the center, then drops back like he is looking for an open receiver, then scrambles left and right. You can barely see him through the blue smoke, which makes it extra cool.\n\nThe father-to-be then picks up his baby mama and starts carrying her around as if she had just caught the touchdown pass that he fake threw.\n\nThe comments section is filled with people noticing that the man never dropped his beer, and that the little boy on the way is surely going to be a football star, based off dad's actions after learning he was having a boy."
