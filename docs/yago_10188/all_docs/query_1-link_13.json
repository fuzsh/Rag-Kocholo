On Thursday afternoon Digital media entrepreneur, Alki David and his media company disclosed sets of DNA results from Michael and Howard saying that they are a match. What they did not disclose was what lab the results came from. Through much digging and research, the answer was ; the lab that the “results” came from is ripped from Terminator Salvation. The logo on the results is the same logo that was used for promotional purposes of the movie. And unsurprisingly, a DNA lab named “DNA Lab” does not even exist.

Brandon Howard, a 31-year-old singer, may just be Michael Jackson's secret son. The crooner, who has a striking resemblance to the late legend, took a DNA test from a dental imprint revealing a 99.9 percent match to the King of Pop. Dr. Joseph Goodman, a Beverly Hills dental surgeon, revealed the alleged results, and claimed he obtained a sample of Jackson's DNA from a dental device that had belonged to the \"Thriller\" singer and was purchased by Goodman at auction.
