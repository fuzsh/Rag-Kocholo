        "text": "“White folks, some young white folks, they run away from America,” Joe Brown, the father of James Brown, once said. “Black folks, they run all over, up North, everywhere, tryin’ to get into America.” These days, waist-deep in the defiant hip-hop era, it’s easy to forget the nineteen-fifties, when black artists, held back, in various ways, from the new pop America, looked on as white performers appropriated their music and took it to the masses. In 1956, Pat Boone’s anodyne version of “Tutti Frutti” was in stores and on the radio at the same time as Little Richard’s lubricious original, and ended up outcharting it. Artists in niche markets always dream of “crossing over” and making it big in the mainstream. During the next few decades, numerous artists left the grittiness and, in many ways, the truth of their culture behind, as crossover ambition intoxicated and, some have argued, overwhelmed black music. (The critic Nelson George has described the process as a “cultural suicide.”) For better or for worse, Michael Jackson, whose 1982 album “Thriller” remains the best-selling record in history, fulfilled this ambition more spectacularly than any black performer before or since.\n\nAmerican in the best sense, “Thriller” contains multitudes, from rock (“Beat It”) and pop (“P.Y.T.”) to soulful schmaltz (“The Girl Is Mine”) and easy listening (“Human Nature”). At the album’s center is Jackson’s greatest song, “Billie Jean.” Its protagonist has been accused of fathering a son with a young woman; his denials (“The kid is not my son!”) are undercut both by the facts (“His eyes were like mine”) and by that relentless bass line tiptoeing around the morally compromised speaker. (The song is loaded with portents. What then seemed to be paranoia would, in time, take on a different cast, when Jackson was accused of another kind of sexual indiscretion. And, later, Jackson would maintain that he had fathered two kids who didn’t look like him at all.) But Jackson is also engaging in an early bit of mythmaking. “I am the one,” he sings, “who will dance on the floor in the round.” Gasping out the words of the second line in triplets—“whowilldance onthefloor intheround”—he was reminding his audience of who he was: a young star whose whole life had been lived on a stage, in the round.\n\nJackson started on the outside. He was born into a working-class family in Gary, Indiana, in 1958. His mother, Katherine, a Jehovah’s Witness, was the emotional center of the household, but her passivity in the face of her husband’s violence toward their children seems to have marked Jackson as decisively as the violence itself. Joseph Jackson, whose rhythm-and-blues band, the Falcons, disbanded in the early years of his marriage, is not the first father to have channelled his thwarted creative aspirations into his children, but he had more success than most. We tend to think of success stories like the Jacksons’ as a kind of movie montage—giddy scenes of rehearsals, driving to shows, playing before bigger and bigger crowds. But Joseph, who had grown up in Arkansas, was also trying to get into America, and for him the trip was grim and determined; the reality was an angry father driving five boys into unknown and potentially dangerous territory. (The Jackson 5 played everywhere, from supermarkets to strip clubs.) Order was maintained with a regimen of beatings and whippings, and, later, at their motels, Michael saw his father disappearing with new female acquaintances, and pretended to sleep when his older brothers brought groupies back to the rooms they shared. Family members, specifically his father, would tease him about his acne and call him Big Nose.\n\nBy the time the Jackson 5 landed an audition for Motown Records, in 1968, the label had perfected the art of crossover. Berry Gordy, a onetime boxer and auto worker, who founded the label in 1959, understood what black performers needed to leave behind in order to get ahead in mid-century America. His label’s charm school molded and dressed the artists, and kept their images clean. In the classic Motown simulacrum, the women were supper-club elegant—the exemplar being Diana Ross. The men were emotional—sometimes titanically so, like Levi Stubbs, of the Four Tops—but they were slickly outfitted in suits, and never threatening. Gordy tended to shy away from politics as well; no Motown act played at Woodstock or Monterey, and it’s hard to think of a song about Rosa Parks or lynchings. Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye shrugged off these rules later in their careers, but the label’s social timidity set the tone for black pop for years after.\n\nGordy knew what he was doing: Motown sold probably more than a billion records. The Jackson 5 was his last great signing of the classic era. The group’s first four singles—“I Want You Back,” “ABC,” “The Love You Save,” and “I’ll Be There”—went to No. 1. Jackson’s ineffable presence—this tiny man was able to lecture a female on the vicissitudes of love one minute and tell her “Show us what you can do!” the next—fascinated audiences. The Jackson Brothers learned the business, occasionally the hard way. The contract their father signed with Gordy gave them a fraction over one per cent of what their records earned. Michael also learned how to stick to the company script. A writer for the magazine Soul marvelled at the way “an eight-year-old boy. . . became a man when a microphone was in his hand.” In fact, the singer was ten at the time. Motown had deemed little Michael not little enough, and promptly shaved two years off his age. Jackson, a quick study, showed no qualms about repeating his new age to journalists.\n\nHe was less receptive to another industry lesson: that pop stardom has a short half-life. The Jackson 5’s novelty wore off, and Motown’s interest waned. In 1975, the act moved to CBS (later Sony), leaving behind both brother Jermaine—who’d married Gordy’s daughter—and their name, another casualty of the contract that Joseph had signed. The royalty rate was better than Motown’s, but the Jacksons, as the new ensemble was called, managed little more than a few disco-lite hits. In any case, Michael had bigger plans, and, despite his family’s resistance, he put together a solo deal with the label. It was the key transitional moment in his life.\n\nThat any aspect of his career has been neglected seems hard to believe, and yet Jackson may be the most underappreciated pop songwriter of his era. “Off the Wall,” his début as an adult solo artist, was recorded with Quincy Jones, a man of exquisite taste and impeccable hepcat pedigree as a producer, arranger, and composer. Jackson needed a hit single to establish himself as a mature star. As Jones was collecting material from other songsmiths, Jackson wrote the hit for himself. “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough,” a seamless piece of dance pop, is neither imitative nor straightforward. It sports a distinctive plucked guitar riff and a restless bass line, to which Jackson added a new, androgynous falsetto. Jones didn’t create the hit for him. The home demo that Jackson prepared shows that his conception of the song was close to the finished product; he even invited his younger siblings Randy and Janet to bang on bottles to accent the driving percussion track. “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough” was a No. 1 hit, and “Off the Wall” went multiplatinum. This was 1979, the year of Jackson’s first nose job.\n\nThe success of “Off the Wall” left Jackson unsatisfied. His next album, he determined, would have to be bigger. For the “Thriller” sessions, Jackson sketched out a moody R. & B. number, with crisp, emphatic drums and an irresistible chorus. As with “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough,” the home demo of “Billie Jean” is a strikingly accurate template of the final version. The song dazzled just about everyone who heard it, in the winter of 1983; it went to No. 1, and stayed there for seven weeks. This was another example of Jackson’s prowess as a high-stakes clutch hit writer. (Jackson, by my count, has solo writing credit on nine No. 1 songs.) Shortly after, during his seismic performance of “Billie Jean” at the “Motown 25” TV special, he introduced his moonwalk dance step to the world. The song’s video became one of the first by a black artist to be played regularly on the newly launched MTV. “Thriller” spawned seven Top Ten hit singles and remained No. 1 on the Billboard album chart for thirty-seven weeks.\n\nJackson wasn’t content with popularity alone, though. As the royalties rolled in, he and his attorney, John Branca, won a hard-fought campaign to buy the music-publishing catalogue that included the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by the Beatles; Jackson paid forty-seven and a half million dollars. In the nineteen-nineties, he merged his company with Sony, and the new operation, rechristened Sony/ATV, grew steadily in value over the years and was recently estimated to be worth more than a billion dollars. Fabled blues and soul artists, former Motown colleagues, his glowering father: all must have looked on in awe. Jackson had achieved a popular success, and a measure of economic autonomy, that previous black artists could never have dreamed of. The crossover was complete. He had made it into America.\n\nOne of the cruelties of stardom is that you never know when you’ve reached your apogee. For Jackson, decline set in almost as soon as “Thriller” fell out of the No. 1 spot, in April, 1984. It lasted a quarter of a century, which is to say, the rest of his life. Randall Sullivan, a former Rolling Stone contributing editor best known for “LAbyrinth,” an investigation into the police corruption surrounding the murders of the rap stars Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur, does his best to capture the complexities of a sad tale. His new, nearly eight-hundred-page biography, “Untouchable: The Strange Life and Tragic Death of Michael Jackson” (Grove), is chaotically organized and overlong. But it details thoroughly both the bad decisions that led Jackson to ruin and the increasingly foggy world from which he made them.\n\nBy the mid-eighties, Jackson had become the biggest black star ever, in part by shedding conventional images of blackness. It is true that he continued to work with black musicians and never explicitly repudiated his musical heritage. The racial overtones in the long-form video for the single “Thriller,” for example, are unavoidable; made up as a ghoul, Jackson seems to be tacitly ridiculing stereotypes of menacing black behavior, in what proves, in the end, to be an entirely wholesome entertainment. In 1986, however, when Jackson learned that he had vitiligo, a skin condition that produces blotches on the body, his response was to bleach his skin and pancake his face with white makeup. His infantile voice, androgynous manner, ever-whitening skin, and de-Africanized features and hair became a grotesque literalization of the crossover aesthetic.\n\nBut little about Jackson is that simple. He may also have been erasing from his body the face of the father who beat him. That some childhood trauma was driving a destructive urge to alter his appearance through plastic surgery seems likely. By the first decade of this century, Jackson’s cheeks had a skeletal hollowness and his jawline was suddenly square; his mouth had been outlined with a permanent lipstick-like tattoo and he had lemurine black liner around his eyes; the broad African nose on the cover of “Off the Wall” had become a dainty protrusion. Sullivan unearths a pathetic cultural tie-in: the minuscule ski jump of a nose that Jackson so determinedly sought was that of a child actor, Bobby Driscoll, best known for dying young, but only after lending his voice and his face to Disney for Peter Pan in the classic animated movie. He wore a prosthetic during the last years of his life. At that point, according to Sullivan, all he had was “a pair of nostrils surrounded by a rim of shrivelled, shrunken, discolored cartilage.”\n\nStill, Jackson had accomplished what he’d set out to do—not just conquer the world but, in a sense, merge with it. In the late eighties and early nineties, however, with the rise of hip-hop, the crossover era was fading. The most high-profile of the new rap artists—N.W.A., Public Enemy, Snoop Dogg—refused to play to the perceived tastes of a mainstream audience. Instead, they were proudly black, highly sexualized, violent (in some cases sociopathically so), and, all in all, decidedly uningratiating to whites—who nonetheless bought their records by the bushel. Public Enemy’s Chuck D. went so far as to attack the most sacred of all white rock stars (and, not incidentally, the paragon of white appropriation of black music): “Elvis was a hero to most / but he never meant shit to me.” Jackson brought in rappers for cameos on his later records, but the results were decidedly non-street. He tried it on the lead single from “Dangerous” (1991). “It don’t matter if you’re black or white,” he insists in the chorus. That wasn’t how the hip-hop world saw things; Jackson was suddenly off-message.\n\nHis experiments in sexual liminality were more troubling. In the summer of 1993, Sullivan recounts, Jackson was on tour in Asia, promoting “Dangerous,” when the news broke that the parents of a thirteen-year-old boy, Jordan Chandler, had accused the singer of sexually molesting their son. In retrospect, the allegations seem inevitable. Jackson had been busing underprivileged and sick children out to his Neverland ranch, in Santa Barbara County, California, which doubled as an amusement park, to play and, in some cases, spend the night. Jackson always maintained that these sleepovers, during which he openly shared his bed with young boys, were entirely innocent. “If I am guilty of anything,” he said, in the persecuted, messianic tone that began creeping into his public utterances at the time, “it is of giving all that I have to give to help children all over the world; it is of loving children of all ages and races; it is of gaining sheer joy from seeing children with their innocent and smiling faces; it is of enjoying through them the childhood that I missed myself.” Jackson ended up settling out of court with the Chandler family for more than twenty million dollars.\n\nThe question of Jackson’s sexuality remains fraught. Clearly, his abusive upbringing didn’t help. As a child star, he sang about worldly things, but without carnality. Despite glimmers of maturity during his solo career—few can look at the cover of “Off the Wall” and not see genuine erotic appeal—he seemed to regress to a pre-sexual moment. His moves and his mien became first feline, then feminine. (This transformation didn’t go unnoticed in the black community; Louis Farrakhan called Jackson “sissified.”) In the eighties and early nineties, Jackson tried to play the P.R. game and make his personal life seem conventional, embarking on high-profile “dates” with Madonna and Brooke Shields, but at a certain point, whether he was tired of the act or felt that his celebrity allowed him to do as he wished, he seemed to recuse himself from grownup romantic life and become a soi-disant savior of children.\n\nIn 1994, when the child-molestation furor was at its height, Jackson married Elvis Presley’s daughter, Lisa Marie. Sullivan’s book does little to challenge the general impression that this was anything other than a ploy on Jackson’s part to distract the public from his P.R. implosion. Presley apparently came to feel the same way, but not before she got to sit by as Jackson told Diane Sawyer in a television interview that he believed that there was nothing wrong with sharing a bed with children. Several months later, Presley filed for divorce.\n\nIn 1996, Jackson got married again, to a woman named Debbie Rowe, a nurse who worked for one of his plastic surgeons. The pair met cute—Rowe had tenderly cared for the star after Jackson spilled a harsh skin-bleaching agent on his scrotum—and soon began having children, though not in the conventional sense. Prince was born in 1997, Paris a year later; both are white, and neither bears much resemblance to either parent. A third child, Blanket, arrived in 2002. Jackson claimed to be his father through artificial insemination, but he never revealed who the mother is. It’s an open question whether Jackson ever had sex with anyone—man, woman, or child. Sullivan believes the singer died a virgin. When he and Rowe divorced, in 1999, Jackson was given full custody of the children.\n\nBy this time, Jackson was falling deep into debt. Ever since he bought the Beatles’ catalogue, in the mid-eighties, the singer had acquired a reputation as a savvy businessman. The evidence here lays this idea to rest. Sullivan’s book is, among other things, a record of staggering financial profligacy and wrongheadedness. We read, for example, of a trip Jackson made to Paris, in 1996, to meet a Saudi prince with whom he unveiled plans for “a ‘family values’ global entertainment empire whose projects included plans to create a theme park home for all British bovines afflicted with mad cow disease.” Before long, Jackson is touching down in Warsaw, “where he announced the $500 million World of Childhood amusement park he planned to build with the cooperation of the Polish government.” In the nineties, he worked with business advisers to market a new sports cola called, simply, Mystery Drink.\n\nMeanwhile, Jackson lived, and spent, like a deranged royal. At Neverland, general upkeep—“from carpenters to snake handlers,” as Sullivan puts it—cost four million dollars a year. Jackson spent twice that on travel and antiques. One of his many financial advisers was shocked to discover that, in December, 2000, Jackson had continued to rent an entire floor of the Four Seasons in New York, where he’d been staying with his entourage, during a monthlong trip back to Neverland for the holidays. Asked why he didn’t vacate the rooms and save himself several hundred thousand dollars, Jackson replied, “What were we supposed to do with our stuff?” He went through advisers, collaborators, and managers cavalierly, from a producer of gay porn to a fat Bahraini sheik, from a Florida billionaire to one of Marion Barry’s former press secretaries, with an assortment of record-industry weasels and various other frauds floating in and out of his life as well. Finally, the Nation of Islam shows up. “This was a huge mistake,” one of Jackson’s associates said. “It was worse than Sony,” said another.\n\nNone of this financial distress was necessary; all Jackson had to do was go to work. Whether paralyzed by the grandiosity of his visions or simply incapacitated by the prescription drugs to which he’d become addicted, the singer played only two tours, about a hundred and fifty shows, in the last two decades of his life. The money he left on the table during this period—the Age of the Supertour—was immense. The Rolling Stones grossed nearly a billion dollars from just two tours in the two-thousands.\n\nHe did find time to open his home to the British journalist Martin Bashir. The result, an odd, transfixing TV documentary, “Living with Michael Jackson,” which aired in 2003, ranks with the Sex Pistols’ decision to make the focus of its first U.S. tour a swing through the Deep South as the most unhelpful marketing decision in the history of popular music. Besides evading the question of his children’s race and insisting that he’d had only a couple of plastic surgeries, Jackson again said that there was nothing wrong with his habit of sharing his bed with children. He even paraded some of them before the camera. The Santa Barbara County district attorney, who had not forgotten the settlement in the 1993 molestation case, got behind a new family with allegations who would commit to testifying against the singer. Jackson was put on trial for various charges relating to sexual activities with minors and, after a fourteen-week circus, acquitted on all counts.\n\nJackson deserves to have that exoneration noted. Still, his behavior with children went far beyond the bounds of propriety, if “propriety” is the word for what was violated when the thirtysomething singer routinely shared a bedroom with the twelve-year-old Chandler boy. Jackson obviously drew in the families with his seductive and glamorous world, and pushed the limits once he did. Sullivan’s snapshot of the Chandler family close to twenty years after the settlement—Jackson fans have been hounding the son for years, and the father committed suicide in 2009—is the book’s bleakest point, which is saying something.\n\nAfter the trial, Jackson left Neverland for good. Chased by demons, he travelled the world with his children and a dwindling entourage, spending money compulsively. Once in a while, he managed to damage his image further, as when he was discovered, in a head scarf, using a women’s rest room in Dubai. He wound up in Las Vegas, with one final whimsy in mind—the purchase of a sprawling estate whose price was far outside his ability to pay. One of his last managers—a Lebanese-American fixer named Dr. Tohme Tohme—finally convinced the star of the obvious: that his financial problems would at least be stabilized if he would just partake of the vast riches to be had from performing live. It was this advice that set in motion preparations for the comeback-and-farewell extravaganza tour, “This Is It.” Jackson was to play fifty concerts at the new O2 Arena in London, beginning in the summer of 2009. The shows sold out immediately.\n\nPerhaps the greatest, most persistent source of torment in Jackson’s life was his family. From the start of his child solo career, there was resentment at home; once the Jacksons realized that they had a golden goose in their midst, they resorted to all manner of emotional blackmail to leverage Michael’s disproportionate commercial appeal for their own benefit. Exacting pressure on Michael was made easier by the fact that, even after “Thriller” topped the charts, the biggest pop star on the planet continued to live at home, in the family’s Encino mansion. Sullivan makes it clear that Jackson couldn’t say no to his mother, and the rest of the family systematically exploited this weakness. After “Off the Wall,” Jackson was persuaded to forgo a solo tour in favor of one with his brothers; similar arm-twisting came to bear following the release of “Thriller.” His family, over Jackson’s objections, brought in the boxing promoter Don King to run the affair. The result, the so-called Victory Tour, was a mismanaged mess and a P.R. disaster. After that, Jackson largely cut himself off from everyone in his family save his mother. This made for ugly public scenes in which relatives would arrive wherever Jackson was staying, demanding of the security that they be let through the gates, while the star refused to see them.\n\nPredictably, the family dysfunction continued after Jackson’s death. In 2003, the singer had dispensed with John Branca’s services, seemingly for good, and told all who would listen how much he distrusted the attorney. Shortly before his death, on the eve of the London shows, however, Jackson supposedly met with Branca again, and after Jackson’s death Branca produced a will in which he was designated a co-executor of the estate. The will was petulant. Jackson left forty per cent of his estate to his mother, and forty per cent to his kids in a separate trust, with the rest going to unnamed charities. Everyone else got stiffed. His mother was given guardianship of the three children.\n\nAccording to Sullivan, Branca seems to have kept the will from Jackson’s subsequent lawyers; that and other irregularities have driven Katherine and various family members to distraction, and they have challenged Branca on several fronts. But the Jacksons have always run their affairs poorly—most of Michael’s brothers eventually declared bankruptcy, as did his parents—and often act at cross-purposes. The chances of the remaining Jacksons interfering with Branca’s stewardship of the estate are slim. (Branca refused to answer questions about his handling of the will on the record, but it seems fairly obvious that he, or someone in his office, is one of Sullivan’s chief confidential sources.) Tellingly, Jackson gave his executors “absolute discretion” in distributing Katherine Jackson’s portion to her—mostly, it seems, to prevent his mother from channelling the money to the rest of the family. Sullivan’s portrait of Jackson’s octogenarian mother being forced to beg a music-industry attorney for funds from her dead son’s estate is poignant—but it’s also payback for her challenges to a will that is quite clear about Jackson’s intentions. Only from the grave was he finally able to say no to his mother.\n\n“No man achieves immortality through public acclaim,” said Bob Dylan, who had the opportunity to consider such things up close. From the point of view of celebrity and popularity—the point of view that truly mattered to him—Jackson may well have been the most successful entertainer ever. His life and career remain sensational to all of us who marvelled as the black music that has run as a counterpoint to the past century—through gospel, jazz, the blues, soul, and hip-hop—resolved itself to play, for a time, perfectly in tune with a nation. Still, there’s little doubt that Jackson lost something self-defining along the way. He ended up a shade, and, besides the music, all that he really left behind—an ambiguous legacy, and a tarnished name, to some rich white kids—was just the final, meaningless step in the ultimate crossover.\n\nAfter a rehearsal for the “This Is It” shows in downtown L.A. on the night of June 24, 2009, the singer came home to a rented mansion. Soon the entire operation would pack up and head for London; there, Jackson knew, he would have to stand on a stage again and decisively show his children—and the world—that he could still live up to his legend. Drained from the rehearsal, Jackson probably took a shower; when he got out, he looked in the mirror at a face that had no nose, at a pinched mouth permanently outlined in pink, at the thin remnants of what was once a thick Afro. He went to bed but couldn’t sleep. The night was not easy; he was awake until the morning, badgering his personal hundred-and-fifty-thousand-dollar-a-month physician to direct ever-increasing I.V. flows of hypnotic drugs into his system.
