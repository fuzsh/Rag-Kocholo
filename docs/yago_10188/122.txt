It’s been 13 long years since EastEnders’ Billie Jackson (Devon Anderson) tragically passed away on screen. The youngest son of Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) is best remembered for his cute afro as a tot to his troubled relationship with Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty).

He's the younger brother to Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) and grandson to Pat Butcher (Pam St Clement) and who can forget the gut-wrenching scenes as his mum Carol made her way home through the Square to find him dead having choked on his own vomit following a drunken party?

Since leaving Walford behind, actor Devon Anderson - who played the role of Billie on and off between the ages of six and 23 - has turned his attention to an entirely new career.

Having seemingly left acting behind (his last role was in an episode of Casualty back in 2018), Devon now hosts his own podcast – as well as sporting a brand-new look.

On Instagram, the once baby-faced star can now be seen flashing much longer locks and a pretty impressive beard.

And we love it.

Devon also appeared in Hollyoaks as Sonny Valentine and even popped up in Spice World way back when – yes, really.

But now it seems he is concentrating on his podcast, WellSeasoned which he hosts alongside musician Shak Omar.

His Instagram shows lots of clips from the show that is described as "Saucy, spicy and sometimes a likkle bit salty," where the duo chat amongst themselves as well as interviewing influencers and reality stars.

So far on the show they've welcomed the likes of Love Island's Michael Griffiths and Big Brother 14 star Sallie Axl.
