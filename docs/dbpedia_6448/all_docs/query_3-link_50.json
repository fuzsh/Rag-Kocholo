        "text": "Eight outstanding contributors to Mountaineer athletics make up the 34th class of honorees in the West Virginia University Sports Hall of Fame, announced by Vice President and Director of Athletics Wren Baker.\n\nThe 2024 class includes Anthony Becht (football), Chris Brooks (men’s basketball), Bob Donker (men’s cross country and track & field), Bette Hushla (swimming), Mark Landers (baseball), Rasheed Marshall (football), Adrian Murrell (football) and Liz Repella (women’s basketball). This class brings the total number of inductees to 237.\n\nInduction ceremonies will take place Saturday, Sept. 21, prior to the West Virginia-Kansas football game.\n\nAnthony Becht, who played football from 1996-99, finished his Mountaineer career second in tight end receptions (83) and tight end receiving yardage (1,178). In 1999, Becht was voted MVP by his teammates and won the John Russell Memorial Award from the WVU coaching staff as the team’s top lineman. He earned All-Big East Second Team honors, played in the Senior Bowl and was a Football News honorable mention All-American.\n\nHe had five touchdowns on the year with 35 receptions for 510 yards. Becht recorded five catches for a career-high 105 yards against Boston College, the first 100-yard game by a WVU tight end since 1995 and had two touchdowns against Navy. A native of Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania, Becht had 29 receptions for 393 yards with four touchdowns as a junior in 1998, earning All-Big East Second Team honors. Becht had a career-best six receptions against Missouri in the 1998 Insight.com Bowl. As a sophomore, he had nine receptions for 135 yards and one touchdown and had 10 catches for 140 yards and one touchdown as a freshman.\n\nFor his career, Becht played in 46 games, had 83 receptions for 1,178 yards and scored 11 touchdowns.\n\nBecht was selected as the 27th overall pick in the first round by the New York Jets in the 2000 NFL Draft. He played 11 seasons over 12 years at tight end in the NFL for the Jets, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, St. Louis Rams, Arizona Cardinals and Kansas City Chiefs. From 2000-10, he played in 161 straight games, trailing only Brett Favre and Peyton Manning in that span.\n\nIn the NFL, he started 140-of-176 games played, finished with 199 receptions for 1,621 yards and had 22 touchdowns. Becht set career highs of 40 receptions and 356 yards in 2003 for New York and caught a career-best six passes, including a 1-yard touchdown at Miami.\n\nFollowing his playing career, Becht worked as a college football analyst for ESPN and is a host for the New York Jets Gameday. He coached tight ends in the NFLPA Collegiate Bowl for seven years before accepting the same position with the San Diego Fleet of the Alliance of American Football in 2019. Becht served as a Trust Captain for the NFLPA Trust from 2015-20 and the Legends Community Southeast Coordinator from 2020-23.\n\nBecht is currently the head coach of the St. Louis BattleHawks of the United Football League, where he led the team to a 7-3 record, which was the most wins among rookie head coaches in 2023. In 2024, the BattleHawks also finished with a 7-3 record and lost in the XFL Conference Championship game.\n\nA graduate of West Virginia with a bachelor’s degree in marketing, Becht and his wife, DeeAnn, have two children, Rocco and Olivia.\n\nThe late Chris Brooks, who holds the school record for career field goal percentage, was a first team All-Atlantic 10 Conference forward during his career from 1988-91 under coach Gale Catlett. A native of the Bronx, New York, Brooks was the first McDonald’s All-American to sign with Mountaineer basketball in 1986 after starring at Oak Hill Academy in Mouth of Wilson, Virginia. He was considered the nation’s fifth-best recruit by the Chicago Sun Times and was also a Parade Magazine All-America choice who arrived at WVU with considerable fanfare.\n\nBrooks was the first big-name, nationally-known New York City recruit to come to WVU in the mid-1980s, opening the door for more Big Apple area standouts to play for the Mountaineers before they joined the Big East in 1995.\n\nAfter sitting out his freshman season in 1987, Brooks became an immediate starter on West Virginia’s NIT squad in 1988, teaming with Darryl Prue and Tyrone Shaw in WVU’s frontcourt. In 1989, the 6-foot-6 forward helped the Mountaineers to a 26-5 record, a first place regular-season finish in the Atlantic 10 and a first-round NCAA Tournament victory over Tennessee. He averaged 12.5 points and 5.2 rebounds per game, while shooting 61.3% from the floor for the 17th-ranked Mountaineers that season.\n\nBrooks only attempted one 3-point shot during his junior year in 1990 at Duquesne, a game-winner over the Dukes. One of the most explosive leapers in school history, Brooks’ best year statistically came in 1991 when he averaged 16.7 points and 8.0 rebounds while shooting a school-record 66.3% from the floor.\n\nHe made 12-of-13 field goal attempts in a game against Marshall in 1990, another school record. Brooks scored a career-high 37 points against Massachusetts on Feb. 12, 1991, and pulled down a career-best 15 rebounds over Old Dominion on Dec. 18, 1990.\n\nBrooks’ 1,661 career points rank 12th all-time at WVU while his 755 rebounds rank 15th. He averaged 13.7 points and 6.2 rebounds in 121 career games. Once his college career ended, Brooks played briefly overseas. Brooks, born in London, England, died at the age of 54, in January 2021.\n\nBob Donker became the first three-time, single-season All-American in school history during his cross country and track career from 1991-95. The Georgetown, Ontario, native earned All-America honors in cross country, indoor track and outdoor track in 1993-94. Donker earned his first All-America honor by finishing 24th at the 1993 NCAA Cross Country Championships. He followed that with a seventh-place finish in the 5,000-meter run at the 1994 NCAA Indoor Track & Field Championships. Donker earned his third All-America honor in the same academic year with a fifth-place finish in the 5,000-meter run at the 1994 NCAA Outdoor Track & Field Championships.\n\nHe earned his fourth All-America honor in 1995 at the NCAA Indoor Track & Field Championships with a sixth-place finish in the 5,000-meter run. At the end of his career, he was one of four Mountaineers to earn All-America honors in two sports. In addition to his All-America honors, Donker captured first place in the 5,000 meters at the Penn Relays to become WVU’s first male winner in 100 years. He earned three consecutive Atlantic 10 Conference individual championships in cross country from 1991-93, making him the only three-time winner in league history. Donker helped lead WVU to two Atlantic 10 team championships in cross country.\n\nHe was named the Atlantic 10 Male Student-Athlete of the Year, was a three-time selection to the All-Atlantic 10 Cross Country team and won the McCoy Award as the top track & field athlete in the state of West Virginia in 1994. Following his WVU career, Donker was the Canadian indoor 3,000-meter track champion in 1995 and represented Canada at the Pan American games in Argentina in 1995. Donker’s running career ended in 1996 due to a moving accident.\n\nDonker currently works in the sporting goods industry, and he and his wife, Heidi, have three daughters, Sofie, Maja and Lily. They spent the last 20 years living in Oslo, Norway, and Donker is currently on an ex-pat assignment living in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nPioneering athlete Bette Hushla was among the first women to compete in intercollegiate athletics at West Virginia University in 1965 when she was a member of the Mountaineer men’s swimming and diving team. That was seven years prior to the passage of Title IX and nine years before WVU began sponsoring women’s sports teams. A native of Williamson, New York, Hushla arrived on campus in 1964 – four years after rifle’s Marilee Hohmann became the first female athlete to perform on a Mountaineer athletic team in 1961.\n\nHushla was a champion AAU swimmer competing in the Rochester, New York, area for her sports-minded parents, Fred and Beatrice Hushla. Her father worked at Eastman Kodak as an industrial engineer and once served as national chairman of the U.S. Luge Committee. Hushla’s swimming exploits included owning the world’s fourth-fastest time in the 100-yard backstroke with her long-course clocking falling three-tenths of a second shy of the winning time in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.\n\nShe represented the U.S. three times in swimming competitions in Canada and hoped to qualify for the U.S. Olympic Trials in either 1964 or 1968. However, because aspiring female athletes were unable to compete collegiately, Hushla’s opportunities were limited. Familiar with West Virginia University as a result of having some relatives living in the Mountain State and wanting to obtain a music degree to become a concert pianist, Hushla opted to attend WVU to study music and to compete on the men’s swimming team.\n\nShe performed as an unattached athlete as a freshman in 1964, and then when new coach Jack Lowder took over the men’s program the following year, he asked Hushla to join the squad after researching her times and realizing that he didn’t have any back strokers on campus. Hushla’s lone season at WVU in 1965 was noteworthy and controversial, winning six of the eight races she entered, leading to her profile in Sports Illustrated’s “Faces in the Crowd” section before qualifying for the Southern Conference championships held in Williamsburg, Virginia, on March 3, 1965.\n\nUnfortunately, three days prior to the meet, the Southern Conference ruled Hushla ineligible because she was a female, resulting in a firestorm of controversy. WVU’s Dean of Women, Betty Boyd, organized a student protest that garnered more than 2,000 signatures in one day and was sent via telegram to the league’s headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. Her plight became a national news story with columnists from Boston to Los Angeles taking up Hushla’s cause. Bud Collins, writing in the Boston Globe, said, “The case of Miss Hushla, a 19-year-old sophomore at West Virginia, is clearly one for the Supreme Court. The Constitution seems to disapprove of decrees such as the one issued by Southern Conference Commissioner Lloyd Jordan regarding Miss Hushla.”\n\nAlthough Hushla remained in school, eventually earning her history degree in 1967, she never stepped foot in a swimming pool again for the rest of her life. She taught school in West Virginia for a short time, was briefly married, then moved to New Jersey to operate a small business and raise her daughter, Mattie, who died of cancer in 2011 at age 43.\n\nAccording to her younger sister, Marianne Ly, writing in her self-published tribute “Remembering Bette,” Hushla was “a gifted musician, voracious reader, dedicated co-worker, a friend to those in despair, a five-time cancer survivor and a lover of cats and all animals.” She succumbed to complications from COVID-19 on April 28, 2020, in Trenton, New Jersey. Hushla is survived by her younger sister, Marianne, and one nephew, Alex.\n\nMark Landers, one of the top first basemen to ever play at WVU from 1991-94, earned All-American honors and was the 1994 Atlantic 10 Player of the Year. In his senior year, Landers batted .416 with 91 hits, 19 home runs and 81 RBI. He ranked 11th nationally in RBI and slugging percentage and 20th in batting average. Landers had three five-hit performances, the most by any Mountaineer. As a junior, he led WVU in batting average (.376), hits (68), home runs (10) and RBI (59).\n\nIn 1994, he earned All-America second team honors by the ABCA and All-America third team honors by the NCBWA and Collegiate Baseball. Landers was the Atlantic 10 Tournament MVP, All-Atlantic 10 First Team Selection, All-East Region First Team and All-ECAC First Team. At the time, he was one of only five Mountaineers to be named National Player of the Week (Collegiate Baseball: May 16, 1994).\n\nLanders led the way in 1994 with a then-school and Atlantic 10 record 40-win season and guided three WVU teams to Atlantic 10 postseason tournaments and one NCAA Tournament. Landers still holds the school record for home runs (19) in a season (along with Jedd Gyorko). At the end of his career, he held the school record for most hits (91) in a season, doubles (57) in a career, RBI (81) in a season, RBI (167) in a career, total bases (170) in a season and extra base hits (89). He had 61 career multiple-hit games in 193 games played and finished with 32 home runs.\n\nThe Charleston, West Virginia, native tallied 1,465 career putouts and held the school records for fielding percentage (.997) in a season and in a career (.987) when he left WVU. Landers had six RBI on four different occasions and had two home runs in games against George Washington and St. Bonaventure (twice). He finished his career starting 189-of-193 games played with a career .341 batting average.\n\nLanders, who attended Capital High, was drafted in the 28th round by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 1994 MLB Draft. He graduated from WVU with a bachelor’s degree in education and currently lives in Deland, Florida, with his wife of 29 years, Brandy, and son Davin (22).\n\nRasheed Marshall was a four-year letterwinner and three-year starter at quarterback from 2001-04. The Pittsburgh native posted 24 victories and helped WVU to four bowl games (2000 Music City, 2002 Continental Tire, 2004 Gator and 2005 Gator Bowls). Marshall finished his career with a Big East record 2,040 rushing yards (breaking Donovan McNabb’s mark) and 24 touchdowns and passed for 5,558 yards and 44 touchdowns. His 68 touchdowns set the WVU career mark at the time, and he was second in career rushing (2,040) by a quarterback and in total offense (7,598) and fourth in passing yards (5,558).\n\nAs a senior, Marshall rushed for 861 yards and four touchdowns and threw for 1,886 yards and 19 touchdowns. For his efforts, he earned Big East Offensive Player of the Year and ECAC Player of the Year honors. Marshall broke Michael Vick’s Big East quarterback rushing record with 666 yards during his sophomore season.\n\nMarshall ran for a career-best 110 yards and passed for 138 yards against Connecticut in 2004, which was the first double 100-yard performance at WVU since Major Harris in 1987. He had two rushing touchdowns in three games in 2002, threw for a career-best 271 yards against Syracuse in 2003 and recorded four touchdown passes against East Carolina in 2003 and UCF in 2004. Marshall’s longest play from scrimmage was a 93-yard touchdown pass to Travis Garvin against No. 3 Virginia Tech in 2003. For total yards, he had a career-high 324 yards against Boston College in 2004.\n\nHe was a fifth-round pick by the NFL’s San Francisco 49ers as a wide receiver in the 2005 NFL Draft.
