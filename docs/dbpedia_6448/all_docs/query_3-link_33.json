The transcript may contain errors and is not a substitute for watching the video.\n\nChristopher Penn 0:00\n\nHey it’s complaints Week.\n\nIn this episode, let’s talk about a complaint I receive a lot.\n\nFrom time to time as I create content, I will get feedback from people, usually on political topics, advising me in fairly coarse language to stay in your lane.\n\nThis is almost universally bad advice for everybody, not just for me, not just for content creators, but for everybody.\n\nFor two reasons.\n\nOne, the obvious reason and a good piece of advice is don’t take criticism from people for with whom you would not seek advice, right? If you wouldn’t go to this person to ask advice, ignore criticism from them as well.\n\nBut the bigger picture is this idea of staying in your lane of do the thing that I expect you to do, right? So if someone is watching videos, or content from me, their expectation is probably stuff around marketing, or data, etc.\n\nAnd probably not stuff around politics.\n\nHowever, if you step back and look at the bigger picture, like for example, My undergraduate degree is in political science, I have a degree in political science with a focus on stateless transnational terrorism, that was a mouthful back in the 90s.\n\nTurns out, that was actually would have been a good field to go into.\n\nBecause for years after I got my degree was 911.\n\nBut needless to say, politics is in my lane, I literally have a degree in it.\n\nBut it’s not what I’m known for.\n\nAnd that’s okay, as content creators.\n\nAnd as, frankly, human beings.\n\nYou should feel free, particularly on channels you own, maybe not so free on like, you know, the company channel where you’re representing more than just yourself, but certainly on your own personal accounts, you should feel free to express the whole of your being not just one aspect.\n\nMaybe you do have a political perspective, maybe you do have a religious perspective, a cultural perspective, a gender based perspective, whatever that is.\n\nStaying in your lane implies, putting away all those other things that are part of you that are part of who you are.\n\nAnd that’s really bad advice.\n\nFor two reasons.\n\nOne, it’s creatively stifling.\n\nOne of the things that I view as one of my more useful skills is the ability to take ideas from one domain to another, if I can take an idea from this domain, which is may not be related to say marketing, and move it into marketing.\n\nI can bring more value into marketing, because it’s something new, it’s something fresh.\n\nFor example, I bring a lot of ideas from biostatistics into marketing, because things like survivability in biostatistics easily translate into things like campaign effectiveness in marketing, right, it’s you’re still measuring the survival of something except that in the marketing side, the stakes are a whole lot lower.\n\nI bring a lot of quantitative ideas from finance into marketing, things like a moving average convergence, divergence indicator.\n\nThat’s a stock market technique.\n\nBut it works really well, with certain types of marketing data, actually works better with marketing data than it does with stock data a lot of the time.\n\nIf I stayed in my lane, if I took these, these people’s advice, I wouldn’t know to do that.\n\nI wouldn’t think to do that.\n\nI wouldn’t think that was an appropriate way to add value.\n\nWhen I talk about things like bodily autonomy, like everyone, regardless of gender, should have bodily autonomy.\n\nOther people should not be coercing you to do things with your body that you don’t want to do.\n\nUnderstanding the motivations of people which is a lot of psychology, guess what that translates into marketing.\n\nNow you may or may not want to hear about bodily autonomy and that’s fair if you don’t want to hear me or any creator talking about a topic unsubscribe or just skip that episode or on so on and so forth.\n\nThat’s totally fine.\n\nIt’s just as it’s a creators, right to create whatever they want, obviously, within whatever boundaries they have with their employer, if that’s applicable.\n\nIt’s your Right, as a member of the audience to say, you know, not my thing today, I’m not I’m not interested in this one just sort of pass on it.\n\nAnd I think that’s part of where\n\nChristopher Penn 5:13\n\npeople have gotten lost.\n\nPeople have gotten lost in realizing their own power to say, and I want, Scott shut us off, I’m gonna do something else in my time.\n\nAnd that’s a skill that’s going to be really, really important in the next in the coming years and decades.\n\nas technologies continue to improve as our ability as marketers as our ability as creators, to deliver more and more immersive content to people improves, we, as the audience have to have the willpower, the self awareness and the self respect, just push the off button, say, you know, Next, click, rather than violently react to content that we’re not being we’re not compelled to consume, not paid to consume.\n\nAnd it may not benefit us.\n\nThere are plenty of episodes of podcasts that I tune into that I’ve skipped like, yeah, that’s not interested in this one.\n\nIs there’s content of every kind.\n\nEvery now and again, this this, there’s one like, yep, that’s not.\n\nThat’s not for me.\n\nAs creators, one of the things we can do to help our audiences is Mark stuff, label it.\n\nWhen I did the piece on abortion rights.\n\nI said, Hey, this is a political piece of big letters.\n\nThis is a political piece.\n\nSo that if that wasn’t your thing, you knew upfront, this is not my thing.\n\nClick Next.\n\nAnd so I have, I have relatively little sympathy for folks who see the warning and then get upset that it was a piece of content that upset them, even though it came with a warning.\n\nSo that’s today’s mind reading.\n\nStay in your lane is bad advice.\n\nIt’s bad advice.\n\nIt’s condescending advice to but it’s bad advice.\n\nBecause outside of your lane is where all the good stuff is that you can bring into your lane, make your lane wider, and make you a better creator, a better marketer, a better human being.\n\nAnd people dispensing that advice.\n\nFor the most part, that advice is pretty safe to ignore.\n\nRight? Unless it’s somebody you really respect Hey, and I’ve thoroughly trusted to say, tell me when I’m going off course.\n\nWhat that advice in in the spam bin, you know, just just let it go.\n\nAnyway, that’s today’s mind reading.\n\nThanks for tuning in.\n\nI’ll talk to you soon.\n\nIf you’d like this video, go ahead and hit that subscribe button.\n\nYou might also enjoy:\n\nAlmost Timely News: Recipes vs. Principles in Generative AI (2024-03-03)\n\nMind Readings: Hacking Social Media Algorithms\n\nYou Ask, I Answer: Reliability of LLMs vs Other Software?\n\nMind Readings: You Need Passwords for Life in the Age of Generative AI Fraud\n\nYou Ask, I Answer: Retrieval Augmented Generation vs Fine-Tuning?\n\nWant to read more like this from Christopher Penn?
