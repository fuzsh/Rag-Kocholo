        "text": "Top Lobbyist For Controversial Anaheim Hills Housing Development Has Deep Ties to Aitken Family\n\nTom Daly with Mayor Ashleigh Aitken and his wife Debbie at the State of the City Address on June 6, 2024.\n\nBy DUANE J. ROBERTS\n\nEditor & Publisher\n\nTom Daly, a lobbyist retained by SALT Development, a Utah-based real estate firm that is planning to build 498 luxury apartments, single-family estates, and commercial space on ecologically-sensitive land in Anaheim Hills, has deep ties to the family of Mayor Ashleigh Aitken.\n\nBesides the fact Daly has been an advisor to the mayor, campaign finance records reviewed by The Anaheim Investigator show he was a member of the Democratic Foundation of Orange County, the political machine Wylie Aitken, her father, used to wield his influence over local politics.\n\nDaly’s relationship with the Aitkens goes back to the mid-1990s. It was Wylie who told the OC Weekly that he first met Loretta Sanchez through him. Yet not much is known about his links to the Democratic Foundation then because some public records of that era no longer exist.\n\nBut Form 460s that were later filed with the California Secretary of State reveal that the former state assemblyman pumped $15,050 into the Democratic Foundation from 2014 to 2018, even paying their $1,100 annual membership dues. He also gave them $4,000 in 2002.\n\nFrom the Secretary of State.\n\nAdditionally, other records disclose that Wylie himself wrote out big checks to help Daly in his bids for public office. Between the years of 2012 and 2017, he contributed about $6,500 to his state assembly campaigns, usually in dollar amounts ranging from $1,000 to $2,500.\n\nThough the elder Aitken “retired” as chairman of the Democratic Foundation in 2009, he still maintained a tight grip on the group through close allies like Dan Jacobson, a Tustin-based attorney, and Michael Penn, his son-in-law, who has been married to Ashleigh since 2002.\n\nNumerous photographs in the possession of The Investigator make it clear Daly was a featured guest at events sponsored by the Democratic Foundation. At one, he can be seen seated at a table not far from Penn. Across from them is Carrie Nocella, an executive with the Disneyland Resort.\n\nMayor Aitken isn’t the only person on the city council whom Daly has ties with. For example, he backed Councilman Stephen Faessel when he first ran for his seat. And Mayor Pro Tem Norma Campos-Kurtz’s resume states she was his district director for seven years when he served in the legislature.\n\nWylie Aitken with Daly in 2017.\n\nDaly also isn’t the only lobbyist for SALT Development. Peter Mitchell first began representing this firm in 2019. However, in paperwork filed with the city clerk since that time, not only does he continue to report them as being a “potential client,” but insists they never pay him for his services.\n\nMitchell is no stranger to the political arena. He is a consultant for several law enforcement unions, including the Anaheim Police Association. Perhaps it should be noted that the latter spent $92,556 to help Mayor Aitken get elected in 2022, according to campaign finance records.\n\nFurthermore, data from the Secretary of State shows the California Statewide Law Enforcement Association, which has 7,000 members, made a $2,500 contribution to the “Daly for Insurance Commissoner 2026” committee last year. Their website lists Mitchell as a consultant.\n\nThe Dalys with Berenice Ballinas, the Mayor’s Chief of Staff, and Peter Mitchell.\n\nSALT Development’s proposal for their 76-acre site in Anaheim Hills has been met with fierce opposition. Residents argue it will increase traffic, pose a serious fire risk, and have a harmful impact on wildlife. They further claim it will “change the character of neighborhoods” surrounding it.\n\nIn response, the firm says that only half of the land will be developed, the rest being kept as open space. Potential fire risks will be mitigated by adding a dozen hydrants and removing excess vegetation. Moreover, public access to the nearby Deer Canyon Park Preserve will be improved.\n\nFor the record, The Investigator emailed questions to both Daly and Mitchell. With respect to the latter, we wondered why he has spent the past five years working for SALT Development for free and asked if he ever expects to be compensated. So far Mitchell has ignored us.\n\nBut Daly, to his credit, did send us a reply. Responding to a question we posed about whether or not his pre-existing relationships with Mayor Aitken, her family, and other council members might have played a role in the firm’s decision to hire him, he wrote as follows:\n\nI was hired to join this project team, which will bring first-class housing and many community benefits, because I am deeply knowledgeable of Anaheim’s planning history as well as our current planning priorities. And I’m certainly aware of our pressing housing needs.\n\nAs an Anaheim native, I represented the community as an elected official for thirty-seven years. Fourteen of those were at our City Hall, where I participated in many complicated public hearings on housing proposals.\n\nI know literally thousands of residents, including the entire city council and city staff.\n\nHidden in Plain Sight: Controversial Disney Executive Sits on Chapman U Board Chaired by Mayor’s Husband\n\nMichael Penn and his wife Mayor Ashleigh Aitken celebrating his appointment as chair of Chapman University’s Board of Governors in February 2023.\n\nBy DUANE J. ROBERTS\n\nEditor & Publisher\n\nLast September, Noah Biesada and Spencer Custodio, two reporters for the Voice of OC, came very close, albeit indirectly, to exposing the Aitken family’s curious relationship with Carrie Nocella, the director of External Affairs for the Disneyland Resort. In an article entitled, “Will Mickey Mouse Continue to Cast a Big Shadow Over Anaheim’s Election Campaigns?,” they wrote about the controversial Disney executive at length.\n\nBut in their story, they included what on the surface looks like a seemingly mundane fact about Nocella: “She currently teaches a class at Chapman University titled ‘Legislative Advocacy & Lobbying,’ according to her LinkedIn page.” Perhaps they felt Nocella’s latest teaching gig was inconsequential, so they never followed up on it. However, that tidbit of information contained a valuable lead: Chapman University.\n\nHad Biesada and Custodio run with the ball, they would have discovered Nocella serves on that university’s Board of Governors, a body that guides the educational mission of the school. Its current chair is Michael Penn, the husband of Mayor Ashleigh Aitken. And with a little more digging, they would have learned that she was appointed to it in 2018 while Wylie Aitken, the mayor’s father, was chair of the Board of Trustees.\n\nNames highlighted from a PDF file posted on the university’s website.\n\nIn our previous article, The Anaheim Investigator revealed that between 1991 and 1993, both Mayor Aitken and Nocella attended Rosary Academy, a small, elite Roman Catholic all-girls college-prep school located in Fullerton. Moreover, we also reported that the mayor, for whatever reason, inexplicably purged all messages which made reference to Nocella’s name from her personal Facebook account early in 2023.\n\nUpon graduating with a diploma in 1995, Nocella went to Chapman University on a vocal talent scholarship where she pursued a bachelor’s degree in legal studies, with a minor in political science. While there, she got elected president of their student government after being encouraged to run by her father, who did the same during his college days. “It was really cool following in Dad’s footsteps,” she told the Orange County Register.\n\nBetween 1997 and 1998, Nocella was an intern with the Campaign to Re-Elect Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez, where she did “campaign strategy, labor outreach and strategy, fundraising, and event planning.” Besides the fact Sanchez was Chapman University alumna, her biggest benefactor was Wylie Aitken, a wealthy tort lawyer, who nurtured her rise to power with money, legal assistance, and political support.\n\nWylie Aitken and Sanchez in 2010.\n\nAfter completing her studies at Chapman University, Nocella packed up her bags and headed to Northern California to attend the McGeorge School of Law, which is located on the Sacramento campus of the University of the Pacific. She earned a juris doctor degree from them in 2002 and, upon passing the state bar exam, became an attorney, working at a wide variety of different positions in both the public and private sector.\n\nIn 2007, Nocella returned to Orange County and took up a government relations job with the Disneyland Resort. She later worked alongside Matthew Hicks, the son-in-law of Democratic State Assemblyman Tom Daly and his former district director. Hicks would eventually jump ship and be hired by Henry Samueli, a Newport Beach billionaire who owns the Anaheim Ducks. He is currently vice-president of Public Affairs for ocV!BE.\n\nFor a two-year period, Nocella was also an adjunct professor at the Chapman University School of Law, teaching a course in legislative advocacy. “The class was amazing,” said Kyndell Gaglio, a former student of hers who is now an attorney. “We had a slew of guest speakers–heavy hitters from the community such as State Senator Lou Correa, Anaheim Mayor Curt Pringle and Orange County Supervisor Bill Campbell.”\n\nNocella and Sanchez in 2015.\n\nNo story about this matter is complete without addressing the influence that Wylie Aitken and his wife, Bette, wielded over Chapman University. For more than two decades, not only was this couple among their biggest donors, showering them with hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, but they were a catalyst in bringing about major changes to its law school, helping transform it into a world-class institution.\n\nIn a Facebook message that Aitken Aitken & Cohn, his law firm, posted in 2020, they reported he was “a key figure in supporting the founding of Chapman University Fowler School of Law and the Wylie Aitken Trial Courtroom, which is a state-of-the-art national courtroom.” They also added both he and his wife helped establish the Bette and Wylie Aitken Family Protection Clinic and Center for Lawyering and Advocacy Skills.\n\nBut Aitken’s involvement with the university wasn’t just limited to philanthropy. In 2004, he became a member of their Board of Trustees; twelve years later, he was made chair. Now at the zenith of his power, the lawyer was now in a position to make critical decisions about things other than management of the school’s finances–such as recommend or approve who gets appointed to other boards and committees.\n\nFrom the Facebook page of Aitken Aitken & Cohn.\n\nIn October 2018, Nocella was installed on the university’s Board of Governors, a body which guides the educational mission of the school. Bylaws then stated only the Board of Trustees can approve this appointment. Because meeting minutes are kept secret, it is not known who supported the Disney executive. However, the politician she had done an internship for had been a trustee since 2001: Sanchez. And Wylie was now chair.\n\nMichael Penn, who married Ashleigh Aitken in 2002 and began working at her father’s law firm soon thereafter, was already executive vice-chair of the Board of Governors when Nocella joined. Penn, who was appointed to it in 2014, graduated from the Chapman University School of Law with a juris doctor degree in 2004. After serving eight years (of which four were with Nocella), Penn finally became chair in February 2023.\n\nUnlike some board members, Nocella has attained rare celebrity status at the university. Not only has her work for the Disneyland Resort been viewed positively, but she has even been featured in videos used to communicate with the student body. Furthermore, Dr. Daniele Struppa, the school’s president, poses in photos with her at their annual event which lauds The Walt Disney Company for being a top employer of alumni.\n\nStruppa and Nocella in 2023.\n\nFor matter of record, The Investigator did email questions about Nocella to three key people named in this article: Loretta Sanchez, Wylie Aitken, and Michael Penn. Both Sanchez and Aitken replied within hours of us sending it. But Penn never responded. We got an automatic message which stated he would be out of the office until early January. However, it said he would check messages over the holidays. That was two weeks ago.\n\nWhen The Investigator asked Sanchez about the internship Nocella did for her campaign in the late 1990s–an experience that the Disney executive boasts about on her page on LinkedIn–and if she had any knowledge of Wylie ever meeting her, the former congresswoman told us that she didn’t remember. “I have no recollection of Carrie as an intern nor do I know how she met Wylie,” she told us.\n\nWith respect to Nocella’s appointment to the university’s Board of Governors in 2018, Sanchez stated she wasn’t involved in the nominating process and didn’t know how it worked: “The Governors are a different set of people than the Trustees. I’m not on the Nominating Committee for the Trustees so I really don’t even work on nominating Trustees let alone Governors. I do not know how Governors are selected.”\n\nAs to the extent of her relationship with Nocella, Sanchez told us most dealings were through her work as a congresswoman. “I would see Carrie at many community events as she or her staff were pretty active in the community,” she said. “Once in a while I would sit down to a meeting with her. One example was during the Unite HERE strike which I was attempting to help settle. I have not spoken to Carrie for four or five years.”\n\nNocella’s internship with Sanchez is listed on her LinkedIn page.\n\nThe Investigator also posed some of the exact same questions to Aitken, pretty much asking him point blank if he had ever met Nocella while she was performing her duties as an intern for the congresswoman’s political campaign. “I do not recall her working in the Sanchez campaign,” he told us. “We had a lot of good campaign volunteers and I may have met her but have no recollection.”\n\nNot only did Aitken deny that he did anything to help get her installed on the Board of Governors, but he downplayed how much power he exercised as chair of the Board of Trustees: “I did not have any involvement in her appointment to the Board of Governors and until that happened I was not aware she was a Chapman grad. The role of the Trustees is mainly ministerial.”\n\nWhen queried about the extent of his relationship with Nocella, he said as follows:\n\nMy relationship is at best distant since my understanding is as being allegedly involved in the ‘cabal’ she was not supportive of my daughter’s candidacy though I was aware of her title and role with Disney. In light of her relationship with Sidhu and Murray etc and other council members I would assume she was not excited that I was selected to be the chief negotiator with the Angels at the request of Tom Tait. As you know I was removed by Sidhu after his election and he named himself as chief negotiator. How did that go?\n\nBut whether or not Nocella backed his daughter’s candidacy apparently wasn’t that important to certain members of Aitken’s clan. For example, Penn, his son-in-law, has been longtime “friends” with Nocella on LinkedIn. Almost four years after Harry Sidhu beat his wife in the mayoral race, he “liked” an article written about the Disney executive she herself shared on that social media website in March 2022.\n\nFrom Penn’s LinkedIn page.\n\nGiven that evidence suggests Penn has closer ties to Nocella than Ashleigh, The Investigator is not surprised he didn’t reply to the question we sent him via email. In our third article about this matter, to be published at a later date, we will explore another angle to this story which reveals, among other things, that his dealings with the Disney executive appear to predate her 2018 appointment to the university’s Board of Governors."
