        "text": "SEAN PENN His Life and Times. By Richard T. Kelly. Illustrated. 472 pp. Canongate. $24.\n\nFlattery gets you everywhere and everything in Hollywood. As Richard T. Kelly discovered, it even gets you Sean Penn, the prickly movie star who's made an art of shunning the limelight while being married to the most famous woman in the world, starring in high-profile movies, winning high-profile awards and publishing an open letter in The Washington Post begging President Bush to listen to Gershwin, read Saroyan and not rain down bombs on Iraq.+\n\nThe president tends not to read newspapers, so he probably missed the letter. Or maybe he's not a fan. The same cannot be said of those who contributed to Kelly's book \"Sean Penn: His Life and Times,\" which could have been titled \"Sean Penn's Family and Friends Think He's Brilliant.\" \"I think Sean was as good as he's ever been in that film,\" says R. D. Call of his friend's performance in \"State of Grace.\" \"It's one of Sean's best pieces of work,\" says Art Linson of the actor's work in a film Linson produced, \"Casualties of War.\" \"I obviously wanted the best actor in America, as I thought,\" says Tim Robbins of Penn's turn in his film \"Dead Man Walking.\" Penn's friend Woody Harrelson meanwhile just wishes \"everybody could see that playful, joyful, fun-loving -- and truly genius -- character.\"+\n\nKelly's very long book reads like a celebrity roast, minus the roasting. It has a claustrophobically clubby vibe. Kelly writes that his subject's \"abilities as an actor require no endorsement from critics: his fellow practitioners, I'd argue, are the best judges in this field.\" Among the practitioners called forth to testify are Jack Nicholson, who starred in two films directed by Penn, \"The Crossing Guard\" and \"The Pledge,\" and for whom Penn's son, Hopper Jack, is named. The Hopper part is for Dennis Hopper, who doesn't like \"The Pledge,\" but considered it \"a privilege\" to direct Penn in the film \"Colors.\"\n\nConstructed along the same patchwork lines as the oral history \"Edie: An American Biography,\" this book weaves together a selective take of the actor's life and times. Kelly's cut-and-paste biography unfolds chronologically, grouped into clusters like 1978-81, when Penn was studying with the acting teacher Peggy Feury, baby-sitting for the future actor Balthazar Getty and honing his chops in plays and movies. Thereafter follow the Madonna years -- the good (1983-85), the bad (1985-87) and the very ugly (1987-89) -- when Penn married, battled and finally divorced the pop star, along the way becoming a figure of great and pathetically easy tabloid sport.+++\n\nPenn's parents were actors who married after appearing in \"The Iceman Cometh\" at the Circle in the Square in 1957. Leo Penn had moved from California to New York because, he explained, he had been blacklisted, though he wasn't sure anyone had actually named his name. (In fact, he may have hit a wall as a screen actor. Either way, the blacklist would become an important part of the Penn family story.) By the late 1950's, the young family was back in California and Leo had started on a long career in television, directing programs like \"Marcus Welby, M.D.\" His wife, Eileen Ryan Penn, had quit acting to raise their children, the future musician Michael, middle child Sean and baby Christopher.\n\nThe Penns didn't seem different from other comfortably middle-class families save for the fact that the family business was show business. There's no suggestion there was trouble in their SoCal paradise, no family demons to feed the middle son's talent or his well-documented temper. As a teenager, Penn surfed, made the high school tennis team, fooled around with guns and shot Super-8 movies with neighborhood buddies Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez. Later, he studied acting, performed on stage and delivered a classic performance as the zonked surfer Spicoli in \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" (1982). He got married, grew famous, punched a couple of photographers, divorced, married again, had children, won awards and, a few months ago, reached 44, an age more proper to a midcareer retrospective at the local cinematheque than a biography.++\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
