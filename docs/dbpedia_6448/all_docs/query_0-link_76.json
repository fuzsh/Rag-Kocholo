        "text": "Sherira Gaon's Epistle has been the most important source for the study of Babylonian Jewish history, and yet scholars have often relied too heavily on this work. This article argues that Sherira Gaon's Epistle must first be situated in its contemporary context, which reveals the many historiographical assumptions about the past that Sherira shared with both Arabic and Syriac historiography from the same period. In particular, analysis of Sherira's account of the Arab Conquest shows that it is not a historically accurate report of the past. Instead, Sherira is indebted to widespread assumptions of his time that viewed the Conquest as a watershed moment. Moreover, his celebrated account about an encounter between Ali ibn Abi Talib and the Jews of a certain town conforms to other apocryphal conquest accounts, composed in order to secure the material and cultural capital derived from such reports.\n\nThis thesis presents research into a topic previously unexplored in academic discourse: the Aramean national identity movement begun in 2007 by a small community of Maronite Christians who are citizens of Israel. This ongoing movement is characterized by reclamation of the Syriac Aramaic language, promotion of military and national civil service for Christians in Israel, formation of secular organizations to promote Aramean identity, and re-evaluation of the Jewish people and the State of Israel. The study examines these characteristics within a broad context, which includes not only the surrounding Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Israeli politics, but also the modern Aramean/Assyrian/Syriac nationalist movements that have developed in the Middle East and the diaspora, as well as Christian history and Christian-Muslim relations in the Middle East. As such, this study draws on sources from the disciplines of history, political science, the social sciences, religious studies, and Syriac studies, as well as on media coverage of the movement and on gleanings from interviews by the author with leaders and participants of the movement. This thesis was submitted in 2017 to Jerusalem University College in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Arts in Middle Eastern Cultures and Religions, and it was approved by readers Rev. Dr. Petra Heldt and Dr. George A. Kiraz.\n\nThis article discusses early Islamic identity based on Arabic inscriptions and other contemporary evidence, which is analyzed with the help of the social identity theory. It will be argued that this evidence tallies with Fred Donner’s hypothesis of the somewhat late articulation of markedly Islamic identity. Circa one hundred published Arabic inscriptions dated to the 640s–740s CE are collected in the Appendix and form the main set of evidence used in the article. The epigraphic material is compared with other material evidence as well as the Qurʾān. It is argued that Arabic inscriptions form an important, but still underused, corpus for the study of early Islamic history. This is because people who were outside the scholarly and political elite produced much of the epigraphic corpus; Arabic inscriptions, then, proffer information for researching aspects of social history. According to the epigraphic corpus, distinctly Islamic identity began to be articulated in the first decades of the eighth century CE, with an emphasis on specific rituals and the Prophet, as well as with the appearance of the words “Muslims” and “Islam” as references to the religious group."
