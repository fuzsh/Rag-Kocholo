        "text": "Penn History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nThe ancestry of the name Penn dates from the ancient Anglo-Saxon culture of Britain. It comes from when the family lived near an area that was referred to as the Penn. The surname Penn is a toponymic surname which described where the original bearer held land. In this case the surname was originally derived from the Old English words penn, meaning an area that housed stray animals and penn which referred to a hill. 1\n\n\"Pen is a Celtic topographical word, signifying 'a conical top, generally in a range of hills, as Penchrise-pen, Skelfhill-pen, &c.'. But there are several parishes, &c., to which this signification does not apply, in the counties of Buckingham and Stafford.\" 2\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Penn family\n\nThe surname Penn was first found in Buckingham at Penn, a parish, in the union of Amersham, hundred of Burnham. 3\n\nPenn is also a parish, in the union, and N. division of the hundred, of Seisdon in Staffordshire and while this parish dates back to the Domesday Book when it was known as Penne, 4 it is the former that traditionally most of the family hails.\n\nIndeed, the family of William Penn (1644-1718), founder of the Province of Pennsylvania (today, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania) traces their origin to Penn, Buckinghamshire. 2 5\n\nEarly rolls provide a glimpse of various spellings and areas of ancient Britain that at one time were the family's ancient homesteads. Warin de Penne was listed in the Pipe Rolls for Staffordshire in 1176 and a few years later, Walter de la Penne was found in the Pipe Rolls for Berkshire in 1196. John ate Penne was listed in Cornwall in 1297; Adam son of Penne was listed at Wakefield, Yorkshire in 1277; and John Penn(e) was listed in the Subsidy Rolls for Sussex in 1327 and the Subsidy Rolls for Essex. 6\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Penn family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Penn research. Another 95 words (7 lines of text) covering the years 1327, 1621, 1644, 1670, 1674, 1681, 1696, 1718, 1720, 1741 and 1788 are included under the topic Early Penn History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nPenn Spelling Variations\n\nSpelling variations in names were a common occurrence before English spelling was standardized a few hundred years ago. In the Middle Ages, even the literate spelled their names differently as the English language incorporated elements of French, Latin, and other European languages. Many variations of the name Penn have been found, including Penn, Pen, Penner and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Penn family\n\nDistinguished members of the family include\n\nSir William Penn (1621-1670), an English admiral\n\nSpringett Penn (1674-1696) English-born, second son\n\nWilliam Penn, Jr. (1681-1720), the eldest surviving son of William Penn\n\nPenn Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Penn is the 1,417th most popular surname with an estimated 22,383 people with that name. 7\n\nMigration of the Penn family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Penn family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt. More information about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nPenn migration to the United States +\n\nFamilies began migrating abroad in enormous numbers because of the political and religious discontent in England. Often faced with persecution and starvation in England, the possibilities of the New World attracted many English people. Although the ocean trips took many lives, those who did get to North America were instrumental in building the necessary groundwork for what would become for new powerful nations. Some of the first immigrants to cross the Atlantic and come to North America bore the name Penn, or a variant listed above:\n\nPenn Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nRobert Penn, (b. 1598), aged 22 who arrived aboard the ship \"Abigaile\" in Virginia in 1620\n\nChristian Penn, who settled in Plymouth in 1621\n\nChristian Penn, who arrived in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1623 aboard the ship \"Anne\" with Oldham family 8\n\nMr. James Penn who arrived in Salem, Massachusetts in 1630 aboard the ship \"Ambrose\" as part of the Winthrop Fleet 9\n\nMrs. Katherine Penn who arrived in Salem, Massachusetts in 1630 aboard the ship \"Ambrose\" as part of the Winthrop Fleet 9\n\n...

By 1838, the British New Zealand Company had begun buying land from the Maori tribes, and selling it to settlers, and, after the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, many British families set out on the arduous six month journey from Britain to Aotearoa to start a new life. Early immigrants include:\n\nPenn Settlers in New Zealand in the 19th Century\n\nThomas Penn, aged 31, a gardener, who arrived in Wellington, New Zealand aboard the ship \"Soukar\" in 1874\n\nEliza Penn, aged 30, who arrived in Wellington, New Zealand aboard the ship \"Soukar\" in 1874\n\nThomas W.

They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 14\n\nPenn Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nMr. Francis Penn, (b. 1613), aged 22, British settler traveling aboard the ship \"Matthew\" arriving in St Christopher (Saint Kitts) in 1635 15\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Penn (post 1700) +\n\nWilliam Penn (1644-1718), English Quaker and founder and \"Absolute Proprietor\" of the Province of Pennsylvania (the future U.S. state of Pennsylvania), son of Admiral Sir William Penn\n\nAdmiral William Penn (1621-1670), English admiral and general at sea, father of founding father William Penn; the elder hailed from Bristol and was second son of Giles Penn, a merchant and sea-captain trading to the Mediterranean\n\nGranville Penn (1761-1844), English author, second surviving son of Thomas Penn\n\nDallas Penn (1970-2024), American fashion designer, musician and internet personality\n\nThomas Penn (1702-1775), 3rd Chief proprietor of Pennsylvania, second son of William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania\n\nJohn Penn (1729-1795), American Lieutenant Governor of the Province of Pennsylvania from 1763 to 1776\n\nSean Justin Penn (b. 1960), American two-time Academy Award-winning and Golden Globe Award winning film actor and director\n\nArthur Penn (1922-2010), American filmmaker best known as the director of \"Bonnie and Clyde\" (1967)\n\nIrving Penn (1917-2009), American photographer known for his portraiture and fashion photography\n\nMichael Penn (b. 1958), American singer and songwriter and the brother of actors Sean Penn and Chris Penn\n\n...

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Dum clarum rectum teneam\n\nMotto Translation: May I keep the line of right as well as of glory.\n\nSuggested Readings for the name Penn +\n\nThe Storm Gathering: the Penn Family and the American Revolution by Lorett Treese.\n\nThe Penn Ancestors of Corine Penn Christian: Descendant of Abram Penn, 2nd of the Penn Family of Virginia by Mary Christian.\n\nCitations +\n\nArthur, William , An Etymological Dictionary of Family and Christian Names.
