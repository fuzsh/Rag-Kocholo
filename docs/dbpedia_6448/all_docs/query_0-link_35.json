        "text": "Expand AllClick here for a more accessible version\n\nAging Our Way, PA: A Plan for Lifelong ​Independence​​\n\n​\n\nThe future of Pennsylvania provides a unique opportunity to develop and execute a plan that will make the Commonwealth longevity-ready, age-inclusive, and prepared to benefit from of the many contributions older adults provide. Pennsylvania’s population of residents aged 60 and over is increasing, reflecting a national trend (Figure 1). This trend, along with a declining statewide birth rate and longer life expectancies, means that Pennsylvanians over the age of 60 will soon outnumber those under the age of 20.1\n\nFigure 1: Projection of 60+ Population and Aging Distribution within 60+ ​(2020-2050)​​​\n\nThe older adult population is also incredibly diverse – geographically, racially, culturally​, and socioeconomically. This diverse, growing population of older adults contributes to the Commonwealth every day in limitless ways as employees and employers, consumers, volunteers, mentors, caregivers, and more. Our communities must be equipped with the resources and support needed to age the way we envision.\n\nIn January of 2023, Governor Josh Shapiro assumed office and introduced the initiative of developing a Master Plan for Older Adults to respond to these emergent trends as part of his first budget address. Executive Order 2023-09 (EO 2023-09​), signed on May 25, 2023, by Governor Shapiro, formalized the project by directing the Secretary of Aging to lead the plan development, appointing the Pennsylvania Long-Term Care Council (LTCC) as a steering committee, and commissioning other state agencies to support this project.2 Governor Shapiro set an ambitious deadline for Aging Our Way, PA’s completion by February 1, 2024, ahead of his next budget address.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Aging (PDA) began the Multisector Plan for Aging (MPA) effort immediately after the Executive Order was signed, using the guidelines set by the Center for Health Care Strategies (CHCS) and recommendations from The SCAN Foundation and AARP. An MPA, also known as a Master Plan for Aging, is a general term for a state-led planning process that convenes multiple departments and agencies designed to foster cross-sector collaboration and improve the infrastructure and coordination of services for older adult populations.3 This term originated through the collaboration of a collective of organizations and funders that are working to mobilize financial, social, and intellectual capital to restructure state and local policies and convene a wide range of cross-sector stakeholders to address the needs of Pennsylvanians as we age. The latter collective includes the Center for Health Care Strategies (CHCS), The SCAN Foundation, West Health, the May & Stanley Smith Charitable Trust, the John A. Hartford Foundation, among others.\n\nMPAs allow states to plan for the rapidly growing population of older adults and people with disabilities, as well as the various compounding demographic shifts like increasing racial and ethnic diversity, increasing rates of solo-aging, and greater longevity among the oldest of the older adult cohort. MPAs consider the entirety of institutional infrastructure that directly or indirectly affects older adults and residents with a disability, including state, local, and federal policies and programs, as well as non-profit and private industry practices. Several states are actively developing and implementing MPAs.​ ​​\n\nOur Focus & Vision​​​\n\nAging Our Way, PA will provide a unified and realistic plan to guide every older adult, family, and stakeholder through a shared vision of how we, as individuals, determine to age our way with dignity, self-determination, and the supports and services we need to remain independent. In drafting this plan, the Commonwealth is committing to a future in which Pennsylvanians have the resources needed to continue to be vital, active, and respected members of our communities.\n\n​​In this vision for the future, Pennsylvania will serve as a model for the nation, and prove that a community is only as strong as its commitment to inclusivity, respect, equity, and support for all of its residents. By embracing the AARP's Eight Domains of Community Livability framework (Figure 2) used by many of the states, cities and communities in the AARP Network of Age-Friendly Communities, we commit to creating a state where every Pennsylvanian, especially older adults, can experience happiness, dignity, and fulfillment.​​​​​\n\nFigure 2: The 8 Domains of Livability​\n\n​\n\nThis plan is designed to establish priorities that will transform the aging services system to promote health, well-being, and independence over the next 10 years and beyond. These priorities are built on a stakeholder driven approach utilizing information gathered from older adults themselves, community advocates, experts and professionals across various fields, and other external stakeholders. The strategies and tactics informed by this engagement process support and prioritize the vision of an age-friendly Pennsylvania over the next decade and beyond.​​\n\nTo highlight the impact of the plan and the issues that an age-friendly Pennsylvania can address, we are presenting a series of scenarios, to illustrate the imperative nature and value of this plan. These characters are neither real people, nor are they intended to be stereotypes. Rather, they capture individual experiences and perspectives that have been gathered directly from older adults, caregivers, people with disabilities, or other stakeholders. This approach was designed to ensure that the characters are not only respectful and accurate, but also deeply rooted in authenticity. We are grateful to the many individuals and organizations whose contributions and input substantiate and shape these characters. The scenarios are a valuable tool for practicing empathy, emphasizing person-centeredness, and illustrating the remarkable diversity of circumstances that Pennsylvanians encounter throughout their lives as they age. Moreover, these characters are a reminder of who this plan is designed both by and for and allow for a deeper understanding of the individuals that the Commonwealth serves.​\n\nOur Approach & Core Tenets​​\n\nPDA leveraged the framework developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and adapted by AARP for the United States to support the advancement of livable communities. This framework includes Eight Domains of Livability to assess the characteristics of a community or state that make it more accessible to the 60+ population (with benefits for all residents) described in detail below. The availability and quality of these domains are known to positively impact the well-being of older adults and help make communities more livable for people of all ages across the world.\n\nPDA relied on Pennsylvania's Aging Network to lead community engagement to gain an understanding of the current realities of aging. Pennsylvania's Aging Network includes the 52 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) and associated Senior Community Centers (SCCs). The AAAs possess a deep understanding of the latest programs, funding opportunities, and policy changes at the local level, ensuring that older adults receive the most current and relevant information and support. Through these Listening Sessions, stakeholders provided insights that define the ideal experience for an older Pennsylvanian as outlined by these 8 Domains:\n\nRespect and Social Inclusion: Pennsylvania is characterized by inclusivity and appreciation for the contributions, wisdom, and experiences of older adults. Stereotypes and prejudices will be actively challenged, ensuring that older Pennsylvanians of all backgrounds are valued members of their communities, free from discrimination based on age, ability, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or other characteristics.\n\nHousing: Older adults live where they choose, in well-maintained structures, universally functional quarters, in safe neighborhoods, and hospitable communities. Alternative and affordable options and adaptations are readily available to meet changing needs and desires for housing. Older adults can choose a housing option that includes appropriate housing design and close proximity to services and amenities such as grocery stores, libraries, and community centers. Affordable options are readily available to give older adults peace of mind and financial security.\n\nTransportation: Older Pennsylvanians can move throughout their community and never feel isolated due to a lack of transportation options or mobility-impairment. Pedestrian modes of travel, which may be aided by mobility devices like wheelchairs, walkers, and scooters, are enjoyable and facilitated over smooth and well-maintained sidewalks. Pedestrians are not impeded by cracked pavement, overgrown roots, snow and ice coverings, or other hazards. Drivers are responsive to the rules around crosswalks. Older adults are practicing safe driving, agree to driving exams as appropriate, and are freshly aware of alternative means of mobility. If an older adult is not comfortable operating a personal vehicle, they can depend on reliable, timely, accessible, and useful transit options with stops that provide shelter from the elements, a place to sit, and are well-placed near community resources.\n\nOutdoor Spaces and Buildings: Our public community spaces like playgrounds, state parks, libraries, places of worship, and businesses will be vibrant, clean, accessible, and comfortable, offering inviting and safe atmospheres that encourage physical activity, social interaction, local shopping, and activity in shared community spaces.\n\nCommunication and Information: Older Pennsylvanians and their caregivers know where and how to receive immediate, accurate information, warm referrals, help in navigating available resources, and ongoing support. Information reaches everyone, can be understood by anyone, and is offered in different forms to meet the abilities, preferences, and needs of older Pennsylvanians. Older adults who choose to use technology can confidently use their favorite devices and securely access widespread broadband.\n\nSocial Participation: A thriving culture offers older Pennsylvanians numerous opportunities for social engagement and recreation. Essential community spaces host workshops, art exhibitions, games, and other options for socialization with people of the same and different ages and backgrounds. These opportunities help counter the loneliness and social isolation many older adults experience as part of their daily lives.\n\nCivic Participation and Employment: Older Pennsylvanians are encouraged and supported in their endeavors to contribute to the workforce or engage in volunteer opportunities. Businesses and organizations recognize the wealth of experience and knowledge older individuals bring, pay fair wages for time and expertise, and accommodate requests for flexibility that enable workers to be effective in their positions.\n\nHealth and Community Supports: Comprehensive, holistic healthcare services promote physical, behavioral, financial, social, and emotional wellness, prevention, and early intervention. The network of public and private providers offers high-quality community supports and health services that are affordable and readily available. Older adults and caregivers are informed and empowered to heal and thrive in the manner that they choose, that best suits their preferences and circumstances.\n\n​This plan, from its initial development and continuing throughout its future evolution, is anchored by five core tenets:\n\nTransparency and inclusion involving significant stakeholder- and public-facing engagement as well as a strong communication plan.\n\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion embedded in all phases of development, addressing disparities and promoting equity and inclusion regardless of a person's age, gender and gender expression, sexual orientation, race, color, religion, national origin, disability, veteran status, socioeconomic status, geographic location, genetic information, and other differences not yet identified.\n\nPrinciples of person-centered planning, valuing older Pennsylvanians and Pennsylvanians with disabilities holistically with careful consideration to each person's unique needs and preferences.\n\nCreation of a living document that will evolve through the 10-year span of the plan based on the changing needs and preferences of older Pennsylvanians and Pennsylvanians with disabilities.\n\nA reframe of how we think about, talk about and value older adults and people with disabilities to recognize the momentum, experience, longevity, economic contributions, and wisdom of older adults and people with disabilities and how these individuals add energy, vitality, and possibility to Pennsylvania.​​\n\nRooted in Community Engagement​​​\n\nSince the inception of this project through EO 2023-09​, a comprehensive process (Figure 3) was outlined to organize project activities, especially gathering and interpreting data from various sources to identify and develop the priorities, strategies, and tactics defined in the plan. The Department committed to incorporating the expressed perspectives, needs, and direction of stakeholders into this plan and its ongoing evolution. Stakeholder input was gathered through multiple means and channels to ensure that as many stakeholders as possible had the opportunity to provide feedback. Review the Acknowledgments section for a list of our partners and collaborators.\n\nPDA, in partnership with the statewide network of AAAs and the Pennsylvania Association of Area Agencies on Aging (P4A), sponsored over 200 Listening Sessions, holding at least one session in each of Pennsylvania's 67 counties to gather more input from an individual or group either engaged with or affected by older adult and disability related services, programs, and infrastructure. Stakeholders were also invited to submit comments by mail, an online form, or e-mail.\n\nThis complementary, multi-pronged approach to stakeholder engagement provided 9,920 points to engagement that allowed the PDA staff to understand the needs and perspectives provided. PDA, through academic and community partners, including the University of Pittsburgh, issued a Needs Assessment to document the baseline for older adult and disability services, infrastructure, and programming and to identify clear gaps or barriers that need to be addressed by the plan. The Needs Assessment included a randomized, representative sample of 900 older adults and older adults with disabilities to present a more objective understanding of perspectives and barriers related to older adult quality of life. The Needs Assessment survey was also offered publicly in digital and printed forms and distributed to stakeholders, community partners and their networks to broaden the understanding of perceived barriers to older adults in accessing services and infrastructure. Nearly 7,000 people completed this survey.\n\n​​\n\nFigure 3: Aging Our Way, PA Development Process​​\n\n​Anchored in Cooperation​​\n\n​PDA staff analyzed and interpreted all the stakeholder data received through the Listening Sessions and the Needs Assessment and identified common themes across the eight AARP domains: access and availability, affordability, health and safety, awareness, and quality. These findings were presented to the Steering Committee as Summary Reports for each of the eight domains. The Steering Committee was led by the LTCC as directed in EO 2023-09, and included commonwealth agency staff as appointed by their respective secretaries, Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), and supporting consultants.\n\nSteering Committee members reviewed and further analyzed the data presented by PDA staff and their academic partners. After further iterative analysis, the Steering Committee members met throughout the months of October and November of 2023 to translate the data into eight domain-focused recommendation reports. These recommendation reports included priorities, strategies, and measurable and actionable tactics that PDA used for the creation of the Aging Our Way, PA plan.\n\nThis plan builds upon an existing community infrastructure and parallel improvement efforts across the state. Many state agencies, boards, and commissions administer plans, policies, and programs that have direct and implicit impact on the lives of older adults, people with disabilities, and family caregivers. Therefore, including members of the interagency workgroup on the Steering Committee was instrumental in ensuring that this work was not done in silos but a collective effort.\n\nPDA will continue engaging with each of these agencies to coordinate efforts, formalize collaborative partnerships, elevate common goals, and align the execution of strategies in concert.\n\n​George is a 95-year-old widower and a father of seven. He is a retired master welder with the Bethlehem Steel Corporation and a Korean War combat veteran. George lives with his daughter, a registered nurse, who currently owns the house George built in the 1950s with money he received through the GI Bill and where he raised his family. George can still drive and to ensure his safety and the safety of others, he voluntarily takes a driver’s exam every year. He has a history of cardiac problems and suffered a massive heart attack that resulted in a double bypass surgery. George’s doctors diagnosed him with congestive heart failure, but he has not experienced any changes in cognition or thinking skills. George’s primary sources of income are Social Security, a pension, and a small amount of savings. He is unwilling to consider and does not think he needs nursing home services. His other children agree, although his daughter who lives with him worries about his overall health and safety when he is at home alone and when he is driving. He occasionally experiences loneliness and depression and often reflects on the number of people in his life he has lost.\n\nThe Aging Our Way, PA plan will help veterans like George, by bolstering the continuum of community supports on which we all rely as we age.​​\n\n​Our Priorities\n\nAging Our Way, PA is a 10-year strategic plan designed to help transform the infrastructure and coordination of services for Pennsylvanians as we age. The recommendations provided by the Steering Committee were synthesized into 5 Priorities, 36 Strategies, and 156 Tactics that identify necessary and actual change to create an age-friendly and longevity-ready Pennsylvania.\n\nAging Our Way, PA is a living document that is designed to be refreshed and advanced as priorities shift based on stakeholder needs and tactics are executed over the next ten years and beyond. Any changes will be published as needed, through regular implementation updates and progress evaluations.\n\nAging Our Way, PA will be advanced through 5 Priorities:\n\nUnlocking Access: We will design and offer equitable, affordable, and available options and opportunities that older adults may choose from for healthy and engaged lives, regardless of ability; socioeconomic status; racial, ethnic, linguistic, or cultural backgrounds; or geographical location.\n\nAging in Community: We will remediate barriers that prevent older adults from remaining in their own homes, maintaining familiar surroundings, staying connected to their communities, and living in secure dwellings.\n\nGateways to Independence: We will promote unhindered mobility by designing trasnportation systems that allow older adults' safe, convenient, and autonomous use of transportation services.\n\nCaregiver Supports: We will build a comprehensive catalogue of supports and enhancements that provide caregivers with help at home, respite, training, and navigations tools.\n\nEducation & Navigation: We will lead an extensive, coordinated network of community and academic partners to raise public awareness of services for older adults, provide information that reaches everyone and is understandable by all, ensure timely and streamlined connection to assistance with any need, and resolve the challenging problems that older adults face in their daily lives.​\n\n​\n\n​Strategies & Tactics\n\nThe strategies identified are critical approaches to advance the implementation of each priority. The tactics are specific and measurable actions to direct resources that address the barriers faced by stakeholders, including policy proposals, new programs or program changes, research proposals, proposed new and changed legislation, or funding requests, to support each strategy.​\n\n​ As we age, attaining the appropriate services, infrastructure, and resources becomes increasingly challenging, due to systemic drivers and health disparities within the older adult population. Regardless of ability, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, language, culture, location, or age, people should have access to ample and accessible options that allow us to age in the way we choose. Living with a disability should never impede active and fulfilling involvement in our communities. Resources to prevent and treat depression, anxiety, addiction, and other mental illnesses should be readily accessible within our communities.​Cultural and language competency is essential to effective communication and outreach, especially for historically marginalized groups who may encounter language and cultural barriers when accessing critical information related to housing, transportation, health services, and employment opportunities. This priority aims to dismantle barriers, fostering a respectful and inclusive environment for older adults across diverse backgrounds and needs, unlocking various aspects of community life. Addressing the Unlocking Access priority will empower older adults to engage and access resources available to have healthy and fulfilling lives.​​\n\n​Maria became a caregiver when her sister, Rosa, was diagnosed with cancer. Already busy with a full-time job, Maria needed to keep her job because neither she nor Rosa had health insurance. She even obtained a second job just to pay for rent, medicine, and put food on the table. She also had to pay for an aide for Rosa. As a Latina woman who doesn’t speak English well, Maria found it extremely challenging to find resources for her and her sister because of the lack of language access. When Rosa passed away, Maria was left overwhelmed with grief, paperwork, funeral expenses, medical bills and her own health challenges. She has been meeting with a support group to help her work through these feelings. Because of her experience supporting her sister, Maria wants to become a professional caregiver She believes she could provide good quality, compassionate care to other older adults, just as she did for Rosa.\n\nAging Our Way, PA will support multicultural Pennsylvanians with language-appropriate resources and services, including mental health, housing, transportation, employment, and social opportunities.​​\n\nUnlocking Access will be advanced through 10 Strategies and 30 Tactics:\n\nImproving access and availability of long-term services & supports (LTSS) among vulnerable populations​\n\n1. Expand and fund the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program within the Pennsylvania Department of Aging (PDA) for individuals receiving home- and community-based services (HCBS).\n\n2. Establish and maintain an appropriately staffed Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD) office within PDA.\n\n3. Review and amend provider licensure requirements that impede long-term care facility admission for older adults living with dementia.\n\n4. Review licensure requirements for skilled nursing facilities (SNF), Assisted Living Residences (ALRs), Personal Care Homes (PCHs), and administrators with respect to older adults living with dementia and amend policies and requirements to ensure facilities promote a culture of safety and reduce barriers for admission to facilities providing dementia-capable care.\n\n5. Author a Long-Term Care Patient Bill of Rights that will protect the rights and dignity of older adults in the long-term care system, especially historically marginalized people.4\n\n6.

Review licensure requirements for skilled nursing facilities (SNF), Assisted Living Residences (ALRs), Personal Care Homes (PCHs), and administrators with respect to older adults with LTSS needs and behavioral health issues, including substance use disorder and those leaving the justice system, and modify policies and requirements to ensure facilities promote a culture of safety and reduce barriers for admission to facilities when needed and preferred.\n\nCreating opportunities for more payment flexibility in LTSS\n\n8. Expand the Quality Investment Pilot (QIP) Program, and use data from this program to support the development of value-based payment mechanisms.5\n\n9. Support and improve long-term care facilities by expanding the Long-Term Care Resiliency, Infrastructure Supports, and Empowerment (LTC RISE) program.6\n\nReviewing service coverage in Medicaid\n\n10. Reestablish chore services as a benefit in Community HealthChoices (CHC).7\n\nExpanding access to supplemental services\n\n11. Advocate for Medicare to include coverage of dental, vision, and hearing services.\n\nIncreasing access to nutritious food\n\n12. Advocate for expanded funding for home delivery of the Senior Food Box program8 to meet the demand.\n\n13. Expand access to mobile farmers markets across the Commonwealth, particularly for older adults in communities with limited access to fresh nutritious foods.\n\n14. Expand awareness among older adults and throughout the Aging Network of eligibility for nutrition-related programs, such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Senior Food Box Program, and the Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program.9\n\nAddressing behavioral health barriers\n\n15. Advocate for mental health parity in Medicare and explore opportunities for advocacy with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to address parity in Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans.10\n\n16. Explore the use of community mental health block grant funds to bridge access gaps, especially in rural areas, to connect older adults to behavioral health services, including addiction services, telehealth, and in-home monitoring.\n\n17. Increase access to behavioral health providers for long-term care recipients of nursing facility services, personal care, and assisted living.\n\n18. Advocate for Medicare coverage of mental health crisis intervention, mobile mental health therapy, peer support services/certified peer specialists, and targeted case management.\n\n19. Increase access to evidence-based resources and training related to detecting and reducing the risk of suicide in older adults.\n\nBridging the digital divide and expanding digital literacy\n\n20. Advocate for increased funding for digital literacy programs available to older adults and individuals with disabilities through the Bureau of Library Development, and utilize libraries and Senior Community Centers as host sites.\n\n21. Collaborate with the Pennsylvania Broadband Development Authority (PBDA) to expand broadband access to rural Pennsylvanians by implementing the PBDA Digital Equity Plan.11\n\n22. Create grants for programs that provide older adults with devices, training, and technical support for digital connectivity.\n\nIncreasing accessibility of community spaces\n\n23. Establish grants for rural libraries to offer social engagement opportunities and expand availability of accessible meeting spaces.\n\n24. Incentivize the integration of Universal Design principles and Smart technologies in new and existing Senior Community Centers.\n\nOffering language and accessibility\n\n25. Create and distribute a comprehensive accessibility guide and assessment tool for outreach and communication, including parameters for multiple languages, accessible formats, print and digital media, and dissemination channels to ensure cultural and linguistic sensitivity.\n\n26. Expand accessible voting sites that allow for older adults and individuals with disabilities to participate in all elections.\n\n27. Fund the expansion of volunteer poll translator recruitment to ensure that polling locations have translators available to assist older adult voters.\n\nPromoting inclusive social opportunities\n\n28. Create more opportunities for intergenerational community-building, social participation, and food growth through the support of new and existing urban agriculture projects.\n\n29. Ensure social engagement opportunities are designed to be inclusive and equitable for diverse individuals.\n\n30. Develop a statewide online platform that offers virtual health and wellness programming, connection to information and resources, and opportunities for virtual social engagement.12\n\nAging in Community is the idea of creating supportive, inviting, inclusive, and accessible communities where older adults can live comfortably and feel valued. This concept is broader than just remaining in our own homes, or “aging in place,” which can be challenged by our changing needs as we age. Most homes are not designed for accessibility, and it can be difficult to introduce necessary design features after construction. It is especially difficult to adapt older homes to improve accessibility. It can be expensive to pay for these modifications and eligibility criteria can limit access to assistive programs, especially for “near poor” older adults – individuals with income levels between 100% and 125% of the federal poverty level and those on strained, fixed incomes.13 Providing direct care services at home is vital to enable older adults to age in their communities and stay connected to friends and neighbors. Home- and community-based care is often more cost-effective than residential care.\n\nRemaining socially connected as we age gives everyone a sense of belonging, purpose, and increased self-worth, and is one of the primary contributing factors to aging well. Keeping employment opportunities attractive and available to older adults also helps to address existing and anticipated workforce shortages.\n\nAAAs, SCCs, Older Adult Daily Living Centers, and Living Independence for the Elderly (LIFE) programs are part of the continuum that offer a broad range of services that we may need as we age. This priority elevates a comprehensive approach to create a state where older adults can thrive within their homes and communities, in the way that they choose. This priority is a commitment to ensure that aging is not a journey endured in isolation but embraced as an integral part of vibrant, interconnected community life.​​\n\n​Annette is an active leader in her community, a retired teacher, and a mother of three. She resides in the home she owned with her late husband. Annette is in good health and volunteers as a teacher’s aide at the school where she used to work and as a member of her church’s steward board. Annette really loves her neighborhood and is close to the few friends she has left. She still drives and often takes care of friends who do not have loved ones nearby to help, yet she could use some help as well. Annette can barely pay her mortgage and the rest of her bills, and sometimes relies on her church for support with food. Annette’s daughter has asked her repeatedly to move in with her, concerned for her mother’s safety and the declining conditions of the neighborhood. Annette cannot afford housing in safer areas, does not want to be a burden to her daughter, and doesn’t want to give up her independence. Lately, she feels her age has made her a target. Because she is hard of hearing, Annette has noticed some people either disregard her or assume she has a decline in mental capacity. This has made getting basic assistance even more difficult, and Annette has been constantly questioned about her capacity and ability to take care of herself.\n\nKeep reading to understand how the Aging Our Way, PA plan will help community members like Annette to age in community​.​​\n\n​Aging in Community will be advanced through 13 Strategies and 73 Tactics:\n\nIncreasing the capacity and capability of the Aging Network\n\n31.

However, as we age, we often encounter challenges in finding suitable transportation, hindering our autonomy to participate in daily activities, access essential services, and maintain social connections. Gateways to Independence seeks to alleviate the challenges voiced by community members by fostering an environment where older adults have a spectrum of transportation options tailored to their specific needs. This includes accessible public transit, door-to-door services, community-driven transportation, and routine driver safety education for older adults that use personal vehicles. As we age, maintaining mobility and access to transportation becomes increasingly crucial for our overall well-being and continued engagement within our communities. These barriers are frequently much steeper for people living in urban areas and those who have mobility-impairing disabilities. Community members expressed concerns over little-to-no public transit in rural areas, limitations of where public transit will take passengers, behavior of other passengers when using public transit, and the accessibility of public transit vehicles for individuals with disabilities. By repairing the cracks, bridging the gaps, eliminating inconveniences, and enhancing infrastructure, older adults can live more independently, fostering connections and enabling them to participate fully in their communities.​\n\nFranny had a spinal cord injury in her early 20s, but she has never let her spinal cord injury stop her from accomplishing her goals. Now age 61, Franny is married, has three children, and works full-time at an advertising agency. She has made use of personal assistant services and has a responsive and helpful service coordinator. Franny values her independence, but her mobility level decreased due to physical changes in her 40s. Driving has become exhausting for Franny. She typically drives to work because the city where she lives doesn’t enforce maintenance of the sidewalks and many of them are impassable for a wheelchair. Franny doesn’t want to use the bus because it is not reliable or flexible enough for her to get to work on time. Uber and Lyft claim to have accessible options, but the app won’t let her select an accessible vehicle. Even though Franny only lives four blocks from her office, the service would cost $28 round trip. She still has four more years until she retires. She has been thinking about getting reevaluated for different driving adaptations. Franny remains eligible for Community HealthChoices (CHC) through the Medical Assistance for Workers with Disabilities (MAWD) program, and she is involved in the local Center for Independent Living (CIL). With the assistance of a service coordinator and using available programs, Franny is now accessing home adaptations and an evaluation from a certified driving specialist to update her adaptive equipment. She was also reassessed for an additional 11 hours a week of attendant services. A lifetime of navigating resources and programs has enabled Franny to take advantage of existing programs as her needs have changed.\n\n​Gateways to Independence will be advanced through 5 Strategies and 21 Tactics:\n\nEnsuring driver safety for older adults\n\n104. Encourage older adults and individuals with disabilities to seek vehicle modifications needed to maintain use of vehicles, including those necessary for employment.\n\n105.

Develop and implement or improve ADA, accessibility, and dementia-friendly trainings for transit authority employees.\n\n110. Improve coordination between transit providers, the Veterans’ Administration (VA), and VA medical facilities to address gaps in access to services for veterans, including veterans in rural areas.\n\n111. Provide resources to modernize the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) van program and develop a fleet replacement schedule.36\n\n112. Conduct research to investigate and evaluate the Shared Ride program, rideshare programs, and other third-party options for their effectiveness in meeting the needs of older adults, or as cost-effective alternatives to buses or vans on low travel days and after hours.\n\nIncreasing coordination between transportation stakeholders\n\n113. Advocate for local coordination, zoning changes, and other mechanisms to support transit-oriented development of retirement and older adult living communities.\n\n114. Conduct an evaluation and develop toolkits which may include innovative ideas for county and municipal governments to maintain and improve public transit services.\n\n115.

Enhance awareness of competitive rural transportation grants available through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and related technical assistance available through PennDOT.42\n\n124. Evaluate the funding and distribution of Pennsylvania Lottery funds for the Shared Ride program to maximize efficiency and impact.​\n\nCaregiver Supports focuses on strengthening the direct care workforce and supporting care partners by cultivating better systems of support, education, and assistance to ensure more sustainable, competent, and exceptional care for older adults. Caregivers and care partners play an undeniably life-sustaining and necessary role tending to the well-being of older adults. Some of us do not always recognize the hard and compassionate work that caregivers do. They are older adults supporting spouses, partners, friends, and other loved ones. Caregivers are supporting our adult children with intellectual or developmental disabilities. They are raising our grandchildren and caring for our neighbors. Despite their invaluable contributions, the emotionally and physically demanding work of caregivers is neither adequately recognized nor supported in ways that ensures that this high-quality care is sustainable. Like many states, Pennsylvania is confronted with a shortage of direct care workers and staggering job turnover rates. Low wages, minimal onboarding, and limited growth prospects stifle the recruitment and retainment of a well-trained, consistent direct care workforce. The inadequate supply of direct care workers multiplies the difficulties families face as they piece together supports and services for their loved ones. ​\n\nGina, 51, is the mother of four children. She is very close to her parents and lately has noticed that her parents’ health and abilities are changing. Gina meets every new challenge, condition, and adjustment head on, and brings an irreplaceable sense of comfort and stability that enables her parents to maintain their autonomy and happiness. Recently, Gina’s mother has been displaying signs of dementia, which has been demanding more time and attention from Gina. Her patience and composure have been tested as she feels the strain of her caregiving responsibilities. It has not been easy. She wants to continue providing the best care possible for her parents, but the current system of supports and services falls short, leaving her overwhelmed and frustrated. Gina has tried to look for help to give her a little bit of time to catch up, but home care is expensive and unreliable, and she has to re-explain the complexities her parents’ individual needs to each care aide. Gina’s dedication to her parents’ care has come at the expense of her own personal life. Gina can no longer hold a full-time job to support her family and is feeling a swell of negative emotions – irritability, exhaustion, and guilt. Gina dreams of a day to herself, to be more than just a constant caregiver: a day to catch up on laundry, clean up around her home, and perhaps find a moment to simply relax. Gina is a caregiver, a mother, a daughter, and a wife. She is someone who has given so much to those around her that she has lost sight of her own needs. Gina needs some help so that she can continue doing the hard work that her family counts on.\n\nKeep reading to understand how the Aging Our Way, PA plan will help Pennsylvanians like Gina to manage caregiving responsibilities.​\n\n​Caregiver Supports will be advanced through 2 Strategies and 6 Tactics:\n\nStrengthening the direct care workforce\n\n125. Update and develop an implementation plan for the 2019 Blueprint for Strengthening Pennsylvania’s Direct Care Workforce, starting with recommendations to enhance wages, benefits, training, and development of a career ladder.43\n\n126.

Develop a statewide Caregiver Toolkit, including information on supports and resources and a caregiver screening tool.\n\n129. Expand existing opportunities for education, training, and case management for caregivers.\n\n130. Explore the establishment of a tax-free savings and incentives account for caregivers.​\n\nPennsylvania is already home to a wealth of valuable resources, programs, and offerings that older adults want and need. However, these resources are underutilized due to barriers like fragmented information sources, technological discomfort, language disparities, and concerns about scams. State, local, and community programs need to reach older adults with crucial information related to housing, transportation, social and employment opportunities, and health and community services.\n\nCommunity members are interested in a trusted, well-known contact point connected to a live person for accurate information, smooth referral and handoff, and follow up. Every older adult has unique and sometimes complex circumstances that call for person-centered guidance and planning that puts the needs and desires of the individual at the center of the plan, prioritizing what matters most to the individual lives of older adults, people with disabilities, and caregivers. All Pennsylvanians want to experience customer service that ensures timely, quality assistance across interconnected needs rather than seeking assistance for every need within fractured systems, through distinct services and resources in separate jurisdictions. ​\n\nThis priority includes tactics to better ensure that Pennsylvanians’ information will be secure and protected and that they will have the knowledge, competency, and tools to engage with the digital world safely, independently, and purposefully. Education & Navigation focus includes leading and coordinating research among academic and community partners to gain knowledge and a deeper understanding of the most complicated social and cultural problems that challenge an older adult’s ability to live actively and be engaged in their communities.​\n\nLionel, 70, has never married, and he does not have any children. While he has a history of behavioral health challenges and would benefit from help around his house, he doesn’t believe he could afford any services. Because of his financial strain, Lionel has sometimes forgone refilling prescriptions to pay for food. Lionel’s doctor recommended that he connect with the county agency and provided Lionel with the phone numbers to get connected to supports. Lionel would like to talk to a real person, but when he called to find assistance with meals, prescriptions, and housekeeping, no one answered the phone. A recorded message required him to push a number to reach the department he wished to speak with; Lionel became frustrated and hung up the phone. Lionel also contacted the county mental health agency. A live person answered the phone, but due to Lionel’s age and insurance (Medicare), the agency referred him back to his doctor. Lionel’s neighbor connected him with a local food bank since he has difficulty buying food after paying his other bills. Lionel used the food bank once but found it challenging to manage the large food box on the public bus. Lionel’s journey to find services to stay in his home would have been smoother if he could have one number to call, answered by a live person to help him navigate the human services system.\n\nAging our Way, PA will help remove barriers and streamline access to services and ongoing support systems.​\n\n​Education & Navigation will be advanced through 6 Strategies and 33 Tactics:\n\nAugmenting navigation\n\n131. Establish at least one dedicated navigator in every AAA equipped with standardized training in case management, information and referral tools, customer service, and resources related to health services and community supports, housing, social engagement, and transportation.\n\n132. Refresh the PA Link program by conducting a comprehensive program evaluation, redesigning a local and statewide No Wrong Door System, establishing channels for information and referral, managing a statewide resource database for case management, exploring outreach systems for follow-up and assistance, and launching a public awareness campaign.44\n\n133.

Conduct ageism and ableism education and training for all Commonwealth employees and contractors, members of the General Assembly, and the PA Judiciary and their staffs.\n\n150. Develop and distribute an educational guide on voting rights, health care options and other community supports for previously incarcerated older adults returning to their communities, as well as their caregivers.\n\n151. Develop and distribute marketing and educational materials to increase voting measures in assisted living, home care, and nursing homes.\n\n152. Distribute existing resources for victims of abuse and neglect, including intimate partner or family member abuse, that contains resources for immediate help and assistance in multiple languages.\n\n153. Expand education and training between public partners, community organizations, and stakeholders on alternative voting methods such as emergency ballot requests and mail-in ballots.\n\n154.

Add PDA as owner and DCED and DHS as partners.48​​​​\n\n​Next Steps​​​\n\nAging Our Way, PA is a commitment to older Pennsylvanians, and must be more than words on paper or a plan on a shelf. To achieve this, we have outlined several key next steps that will bring this plan to life and ensure that we are empowered to age our way and live in age-friendly towns, cities, counties, and regions across the Commonwealth.\n\nCoordination, Collaboration, and Accountability\n\nOur commitment to the success of Aging Our Way, PA is dependent on the coordination and collaboration among our agency partners and private stakeholders. Everyone has a role to play and responsibility to uphold as we implement this plan. Appropriate mechanisms will be established to implement and execute each tactic outlined in the plan.\n\nTransparency, Monitoring, and Reporting\n\nPDA pledges to conduct regular data monitoring, track tactic progress, and openly report plan impacts to the public through a publicly accessible dashboard.\n\nCost Avoidance and Savings\n\nWhere possible, tactics in this plan will be used to divert older adults from needing higher cost services such as those paid by the Pennsylvania Medicaid program while supporting the expressed desire by individuals to age in their homes and communities.\n\nEvaluation, Community Engagement, and Improvement\n\nWe continue active engagement with our community members across the state to ensure that the voices of all older Pennsylvanians and caregivers, including the most marginalized, are incorporated into the plan. As a living document, the priorities will shift, the strategies will evolve, and the tactics will be developed to reflect the relevant needs of older Pennsylvanians.​​​​\n\n​Acknowledg​​ments​​​\n\nOlder adults, Caregivers, and Care Partners\n\nJason Kavulich, Secretary of Aging\n\nKevin Hancock, PDA\n\nGabby Szymanski, PDA\n\nNathan Lampenfeld, PDA\n\nJessie Pierce, PDA\n\nKaren Leonovich, P4A\n\nBrenda Appel, P4A\n\nTeresa Osborne, AARP\n\nBill Johnston-Walsh, AARP\n\nHoward B.
