        "text": "Chris Penn found dead\n\nActor Chris Penn Dead At 40\n\nPOSTED: 8:49 pm PST January 24, 2006\n\nUPDATED: 9:01 pm PST January 24, 2006\n\nLOS ANGELES -- Actor Chris Penn, brother of Sean Penn, was found dead Tuesday at a condominium near the beach in Santa Monica, police said.\n\nPolice said they discovered the 40-year-old actor's body around 4 p.m. Lt. Frank Fabrega said there were no obvious signs of foul play.\n\nSean Penn's publicist, Mara Buxbaum, issued a statement saying that \"the Penn family would appreciate the media's respect of their privacy during this difficult time.\"\n\nChris Penn's body was found inside the four-story condominium complex after police were called by someone from within the building, Fabrega said.\n\nAn autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause of death, authorities said.\n\nChris Penn's credits included \"Mulholland Falls,\" \"Rumble Fish,\" \"All the Right Moves,\" \"Footloose\" and \"Rush Hour.\" He also played Nice Guy Eddie Cabot in the 1992 Quentin Tarantino crime drama \"Reservoir Dogs.\"\n\nHis late father, Leo Penn, directed television shows. His mother, Eileen Ryan, is an actress whose credits include \"I Am Sam,\" \"Magnolia\" and \"Parenthood.\" Another brother is musician Michael Penn.\n\nChris Penn's latest film, \"The Darwin Awards,\" was scheduled to premiere Wednesday at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nCarek1230 said:\n\nWow, it takes THAT long for toxicology results to come through? On TV all those CSI type shows make it seem like they get the info so easily and quickly in these cases. The poor family will have to wait that much longer until they have answers. That is so sad. And age 40 is much too young to die.\n\nthats cuz its in the script !\n\nit CAN take up to 6 weeks I would guess. but im sure a high profile actor like him his goes all the way to the front...\n\ni dunno if those things have realease times for family and then another for public interest.\n\npeople.com\n\nCostars and crewmembers of The Darwin Awards remembered the late Chris Penn at the movie's Sundance premiere on Wednesday.\n\nThe 6', 4\", 310-lb. Penn, 40, was found dead in his Santa Monica condominium on Tuesday. The cause remained undetermined despite an autopsy performed Wednesday just hours before the Sundance premiere.\n\n\"It's very sad for all of us,\" Darwin costar Wilmer Valderrama told PEOPLE about Penn's death. In the film, which stars Winona Ryder and Joseph Fiennes and is based on the Web site that lists gross real-life examples of human folly, Penn appears as a driver who makes the fatal mistake of pulling on to very thin ice.\n\n\"Winona stood up tonight after the screening and talked about how amazing he was and how much we all loved him,\" said Valderrama. \"She wanted to acknowledge what had just happened, and it was very sweet.\"\n\nValderrama called Penn \"an incredibly talented actor and just a very wonderful person. It's so sad. We all feel it's a very big loss.\"\n\nAfter the screening, Ryder said of Penn during a question-and-answer session: \"I really hope people go back and watch his movies, because he was such a fantastic actor, and he is going to be so missed. ... Not just Sean Penn's little brother, you know? He was Chris Penn.\"\n\nToxicology tests have been ordered on Penn, which Los Angeles County coroner's spokeswoman Brenda Shafer said is \"just normal procedure for someone who's 40 and has not seen their doctor.\"\n\nPenn's body was discovered in a bed inside his residence, located in a four-story condominium complex near the beach, said Capt. Ed Winter of the county coroner's office. Penn's housekeeper called authorities to the condominium complex, Winter said.\n\nPenn, with more than 50 credits to his name, appeared in such films as Reservoir Dogs, At Close Range, Mulholland Falls, Short Cuts and Footloose.\n\nThe California-native hailed from a show-business family: In addition to his Oscar-winning brother Sean, his brother Michael is a musician; his father, Leo, was a TV director; and mother Eileen Ryan is an actress who appeared in the films I Am Sam and Magnolia.\n\nSean Penn, 45, is said to have gone into seclusion since learning of his brother's passing."
