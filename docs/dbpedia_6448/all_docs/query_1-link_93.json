We strive to create an inclusive culture that celebrates difference and is strengthened by contributions from people of all races, religions, countries of origin, genders, ages, sexual orientations, physical abilities, learning differences, and socioeconomic backgrounds. We aspire to support and retain a student body, faculty and staff who are representative of the multiple communities and publics with which we collaborate and work. A diverse community at the Weitzman School enhances our ability to prepare the next generation of artists, architects, landscape architects, planners, and preservationists to become leaders and innovators in a multicultural society.\n\nLearn about past, present, and future initiatives in the section of this website dedicated to Inclusion & Belonging.\n\nGenerations of designers, planners, preservationists, and artists have chosen to pursue their passion at Penn. Here are some of the factors in their decision:\n\nInfluence\n\nGenerations of Weitzman graduates have shaped their profession through their practice and scholarship, and the School continues to train the future leaders of design’s many fields.\n\nPhiladelphia\n\nOne of the most affordable cities of its size in the Northeast, Philadelphia is replete with history, architectural and landscape landmarks, and diverse neighborhoods. Its arts and music scene rivals that of Austin, Montreal, and Seattle.\n\nInterdisciplinary Study\n\nThe Weitzman School is unique among U.S. graduate institutions in bringing together architecture, landscape architecture, city and regional planning, historic preservation, and the fine arts; students are encouraged to take classes across disciplines.\n\nMaking a Difference\n\nWeitzman’s architecture department was originally established in 1890 with the express purpose of improving the built environment for Philadelphians. Still at the heart of Weitzman's curriculum are community-based, site-specific studios, and students can receive funding and guidance for social impact projects through PennPraxis.\n\nA School within a University\n\nWeitzman students enjoy access to all 12 Schools at the University, including Wharton, Engineering, and Social Policy. Dual degree offerings and certificates add further breadth to study at the Weitzman School.\n\nMeaningful Research\n\nWeitzman faculty and students work on socially relevant initiatives led by PennPraxis, the Center for Environmental Building Design, the Center for the Preservation of Civil Rights Sites (CPCRS), the Center for Public Art & Space (CPAS), the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, the Penn Institute for Urban Research (IUR), The Ian L. McHarg Center for Urbanism and Ecology, and the Center for Archectural Conservation (CAC).\n\nPragmatism\n\nThe Weitzman School retains the commitment of inventor Benjamin Franklin, Penn’s first president and longtime trustee, to applied research. Art and design are understood as acting in dialogue with society for the betterment of humanity.\n\nCommunity\n\nRelationships are at the heart of the Weitzman experience, and they’re built outside the studio as well as in. Along with Happy Hour and the annual Beaux Arts Ball, programs initiated by Student Affairs, Student Council and student groups like Penn Women in Architecture help form bonds for a lifetime."
