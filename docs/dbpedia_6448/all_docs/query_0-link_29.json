Chris Penn apparently collapsed and died in Santa Monica today.\n\nChris Penn was in many films in the '80s, including a leading role in the Cameron Crowe-scripted flick about high school life THE WILD LIFE. The other Cameron Crowe-scripted flick about high school life starring a Penn, FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH became very well known while this one fell through the cracks. He also had small roles in RUMBLE FISH, FOOTLOOSE and BEST OF THE BEST.\n\nDespite his work in the '80s, it wasn't until he hooked up with Quentin Tarantino in his first big film that he really broke out. He played Nice Guy Eddie in RESERVOIR DOGS and will be quoted for generations. He also appeared in the Tarantino-scripted TRUE ROMANCE. He went on to become a well-used character actor in films like RUSH HOUR and STARSKY & HUTCH.\n\nHe was only 40 years old. My thoughts are with his friends, family and fans."
