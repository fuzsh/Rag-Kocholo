It may be out of date and no longer relevant.\n\nAlmost Timely News: Practical Use Case and Examples of Generative AI (2022-12-11) :: View in Browser\n\nüëâ Get my new 2023 marketing planning forecast, free for a limited time ¬ª\n\nWatch This Newsletter On YouTube üì∫\n\nClick here for the video üì∫ version of this newsletter on YouTube ¬ª\n\nClick here for an MP3 audio üéß only version ¬ª\n\nWhat‚Äôs On My Mind: Practical Use Case and Examples of Generative AI\n\nWe‚Äôve all been abuzz this year about the power and potential of generative AI ‚Äì AI that creates stuff for us. From DALL-E and Stable Diffusion creating award-winning artwork to ChatGPT answering questions and building content, we‚Äôve seen no shortage of mind-blowing demonstrations about the capabilities of AI.\n\nAnd yet‚Ä¶ at the end of the day, an awful lot of people see these, think they‚Äôre amazing party tricks‚Ä¶ and don‚Äôt know what to do with the technology. Therein lies the great challenge of AI. It‚Äôs so powerful and so new that people are having a hard time wrapping their brains around what the technology makes possible in practical, sensible ways. So today, let‚Äôs look at a couple of very practical use cases that you can implement immediately at very low or no cost. The tools I‚Äôll be using are OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3 Playground, and GoCharlie.ai.\n\nUse Case 1: A/B Testing\n\nHere‚Äôs a snapshot of my Public Speaking page, where I try to convince people to hire me as a public speaker. Almost all of us feel‚Ä¶ well, a little awkward writing sales copy to convince others to hire us.\n\nWouldn‚Äôt it be great to get someone or something else to do that? Enter AI. Using the OpenAI GPT-3 Playground, I gave the AI some parameters as a prompt:\n\nWrite a public speaking landing page designed to convince the reader to hire Christopher Penn as a keynote speaker at their event. Incorporate the following facts:\n\nChristopher Penn is a 5-year, 5-time IBM Champion with expertise in data and artificial intelligence\n\nChristopher Penn is an internationally sought after marketing keynote speaker\n\nChristopher Penn is a Google Certified Professional in Google Analytics 4 and other Google Marketing Platform technologies\n\nChristopher Penn is a bestselling author of ‚ÄúAI for Marketers‚Äù, ‚ÄúLeading Innovation‚Äù, and a dozen other books.\n\nInclude a testimonial from sales leader Jerry Acuff: ‚ÄúIf you need a marketing keynote speaker, you better call Christopher Penn‚Äù\n\nFocus on Christopher Penn‚Äôs ability to teach audiences practical takeaways and proven strategies in marketing, AI, data science, and analytics\n\nFocus on Christopher Penn‚Äôs ability to help event planners get rave reviews for their events from attendees\n\nWrite the landing page copy in 750 words in a warm, professional tone in the first person from Christopher Penn:\n\nThis is a fairly straightforward prompt that gives the software a lot to work with, a lot of details it can incorporate. Let‚Äôs see what it spits out:\n\nWelcome! My name is Christopher Penn, and I‚Äôm an internationally sought-after marketing keynote speaker.\n\nI‚Äôm a 5-year, 5-time IBM Champion with expertise in data and artificial intelligence. I‚Äôm also a Google Certified Professional in Google Analytics 4 and other Google Marketing Platform technologies. I‚Äôve written bestselling books like ‚ÄúAI for Marketers‚Äù, ‚ÄúLeading Innovation‚Äù, and a dozen other books.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a keynote speaker for your next event, you‚Äôve come to the right place. As a professional speaker, I specialize in helping event planners get rave reviews from attendees. I‚Äôm passionate about teaching audiences practical takeaways and proven strategies in marketing, AI, data science, and analytics.\n\nI have a proven track record of helping my clients succeed. In fact, sales leader Jerry Acuff recently said, ‚ÄúIf you need a marketing keynote speaker, you better call Christopher Penn.‚Äù I‚Äôm confident that I can bring the same success to your next event.\n\nIf you hire me as a keynote speaker, I will help you make your event a success. I‚Äôll provide attendees with a valuable experience that they‚Äôll remember and talk about for years to come. My message will be tailored to fit your audience‚Äôs interests and needs.\n\nI‚Äôm experienced in speaking at conferences, conventions, seminars, and other events. I‚Äôm comfortable speaking to both large and small audiences. I‚Äôm also available to do virtual speaking engagements.\n\nMy goal is to make sure your event is a success. I will work with you to ensure that you get the results you‚Äôre looking for. I‚Äôm committed to providing valuable insights and strategies that your audience can use to improve their business and personal lives.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a keynote speaker who can provide a memorable and powerful experience, I‚Äôm your person. Please contact me today to discuss how I can help make your event a success.\n\nI can tell you for a fact I would not have written the copy for the page like this. But you know what? My opinion doesn‚Äôt matter. What matters is whether this delivers results. After fact-checking and final human approval, it‚Äôs ready for use. Now what? Now in a tool like Google Optimize, I add this landing page copy as the variant, as the test condition, with the existing copy as the control.\n\nThat‚Äôs a practical, useful application of the technology ‚Äì to write copy we might not otherwise write, and then test it to see how it performs versus our own copy.\n\nUse Case #2: Transformation\n\nWe‚Äôve spent the last 5 years pivoting our content creation to other formats, especially video. I‚Äôve argued for the use of video since smartphones became affordable primary video cameras, capable of shooting ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù video; there‚Äôs no excuse any longer for marketers not to be creating video.\n\nHowever, just because something starts out as video doesn‚Äôt mean it should stay as video. Now, with AI tools, we can transform our video back into text. Take this fireside chat I did with my friend Jay Baer. It‚Äôs a terrific video; Jay had a lot to share, a lot of useful information. However, that information is locked in video format.\n\nSo let‚Äôs take it and stuff the video into GoCharlie.ai‚Äòs content repurposing engine:\n\nWhat does it spit out?\n\nLook at that beauty. A bulleted list of key points from the video, automatically split into different logical sections. I can take that, pair it with the transcription, and I‚Äôve got fantastic content for a landing page. Or I can rewrite it into different formats.\n\nThink about that for a second. Have you been on a podcast or a livestream, and that content is just sitting locked away in a rich media format? Use a tool like this to extract that and get the content back on your website in a more accessible way.\n\nThese two use cases are practical, doable today with relatively low cost tools.\n\nFTC Disclosure: My company, Trust Insights, is an affiliate of GoCharlie, and thus I indirectly benefit financially if you do business with them.\n\nGot a Question?
