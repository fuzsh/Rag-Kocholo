        "text": "Origin\n\nPenn : 1: English: habitational name from either of two places called Penn (in Buckinghamshire and Staffordshire) both of which are named with Brittonic penn ‘head’ often used in hill-names.2: English: topographic name or metonymic occupational name from Middle English pen(n) ‘enclosure animal pen fold’ (Old English penn) for someone who lived by or worked at a fold. Examples of this surname are formally difficult to distinguish from those in 1 above.3: English: from a pet form of the female personal name Pernel see Parnell.4: English: variant of Pinn.5: Cornish: shortened form of Penna.6: South German: unexplained.7: Germanized form of Sorbian P'eń: from Lower Sorbian p'eń ‘tree stump trunk’ probably a nickname for a short stocky person.8: Breton (mainly Finistère; also Le Penn): variant of Pen and in North America (also) an altered form of this.9: Americanized form of some similar (like-sounding) Jewish surname.10: In some cases probably also an Americanized form of Slovenian Pen.11: Americanized form of the Chinese surname 彭 see Peng 1.\n\nBethmann : German:: 1: from a pet form of the personal name Bertram.2: occupational name for a tax collector of the bede penninc a tax requested from freemen in the Middle Ages.\n\nBooth : English (northern): topographic or occupational name from Middle English bothe (Old Danish bōth) ‘temporary shelter such as a covered market stall or a cattle-herdsman's hut’. The latter sense was predominant in the Pennines of Lancashire and Yorkshire where there were many cattle farms or vaccaries and whose subdivisions were known as ‘booths’. The principal meaning of the surname there was therefore probably ‘cattle herdsman’ ‘man in charge of a vaccary’ and thus identical with Boothman. Elsewhere it may have denoted a shopkeeper who owned a temporary market stall but no evidence has been found to confirm this use of the surname. In the British Isles the surname is still more common in northern England where Scandinavian influence was more marked and in Scotland where the word was borrowed into Gaelic as both(an).\n\nBoothman : English (northern): occupational name from Middle English both (Old Danish bōth) ‘temporary shelter such as a covered market stall or a cattle-herdsman's hut’ + man. In the Pennine uplands of northern England where booths were subdivisons of vaccaries or cattle-rearing establishment the name probably denoted a herdsman who looked after cattle perhaps a man in charge of a vaccary. Elsewhere the surname might have denoted a shopkeeper but evidence for this lacking. Alternatively the name can also be an occupational name for a servant of a man surnamed Booth.\n\nBreadmore : from Middle English brod brad ‘broad wide’ (Old English brād) + mere ‘mere lake pool’ (Old English mere) or mor ‘moor wasteland marsh’ (Old English mōr). The name may be topographic for one who lived by a large lake or moor or toponymic from a place so named such as Bradmore (Notts) a lost Bradmore in Honington (Warwicks) Bradmore in Penn (Staffs) or Broadmoor in Wotton (Surrey).\n\nCampodonico : Italian (Genoa): habitational name from a place so called in the Apennines.\n\nCampoli : Italian: habitational name from any of various places in central and southern Italy named with Campoli or Campolo from Latin campulus ‘little field’ as for example Campoli Appennino in Frosinone province or Campoli del Monte Taburno in Benevento.\n\nDarry : 1: from Anglo-Norman French darree ‘pennyworth’ (Old French denree). Compare French Danré Danrée (Dauzat). 2: see Derry.\n\nDarst : Pennsylvania German variant of Durst or of Dorst.\n\nDella Penna : Italian: nickname from penna ‘feather’.\n\nDenyer : English (Surrey and Sussex): perhaps a nickname from Middle English denier ‘penny object of little value' (Old French denier) perhaps denoting an impoverished man.\n\nDerry : 4: English: variant of Darry from Anglo-French darree ‘pennyworth’ (Old French denree) a nickname for a merchant or tradesman.1: English: topographic name for someone who lived by or worked in a deer enclosure from Middle English der ‘deer’ (Old English dēor) + hay ‘enclosure’ (Old English (ge)hæg).2: English: perhaps from an unrecorded Middle English female personal name Dery Diry possibly representing Old English Dēorgifu from dēore ‘dear’ or dēor ‘animal; violent’ + gifu ‘gift’. Alternatively the name may be from Middle English diri a nonsense word.3: English: in Devon and Cornwall alternatively a variant of Dear from the Old English personal name Dēora where the unstressed final vowel developed to -y in local dialect.5: Irish: Anglicized form of Gaelic Ó Doiridh the name of an eccesiastical family from Donegal meaning ‘descendant of Doireadh’. Derry is often confused with Deery.\n\nDisbrow : English (Cambridgeshire): variant of Desborough a habitational name from any of the places in Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire called Desborough. The first is named from Old English dweorge-dwostle ‘penny-royal’ + beorg ‘hill’; the second from the Old English personal name Dēor + burh ‘fortress stronghold’. This form of the surname is now rare in Britain.\n\nDorning : 1: Irish: variant of Dornan.2: Probably an altered form of German Dornig which is probably a nickname for someone with a sharp tongue from an adjectival derivative of Middle High German Middle Low German dorn ‘thorn’. The suffixes -ig and -ing were often interchanged in Pennsylvania German and elsewhere. The name may also refer to a sloe bush.\n\nFarthing : English:: 1: from the Middle English personal name Farthein Farthing Ferthing (Old Norse Farthegn late Old English Færthegn) composed of the elements far ‘ship passage’ + thegn ‘warrior nobleman or retainer’.2: habitational name from a place called in Middle English with ferthing (Old English fēorthing ‘fourth part quarter’). Until 1960 when it was withdrawn this was the name of the smallest British coin worth one quarter of a penny. The same word was also used to denote a measure of land normally one quarter of a virgate or other larger unit. The term is frequent in minor placenames in Sussex and is also found in Somerset and Devon.\n\nFecher : German: occupational name for a surveyor of fish pens from a noun derivative of Middle High German vach ‘compartment division’ in fishing an area of water penned off with logs.\n\nGathergood : from Middle English gad(e)ren ‘to gather’ + god ‘goods possessions wealth’ (Old English gaderian + gōd) apparently denoting someone with acquisitive thrifty or miserly habits. Compare Abraham Cathermonie (‘gather money’) 1193 in Rievaulx Cartulary; Adam Gaderpeynye (‘gather pennies’) 1285 in Assize Rolls (Lancs); Willelmo Gadergold (‘gather gold’) 1379 in Poll Tax (Tidcombe and Marten Wilts).\n\nGolec : 1: Polish: nickname from golec from goły ‘naked’ also ‘penniless’ in various possible senses: it could denote a naked or hairless (bald or clean-shaven) man and also someone penniless totally destitute a naked wretch.2: Croatian and Slovenian: nickname from Croatian dialect and Slovenian golec ‘the beardless one’ from gol ‘beardless’ (also ‘naked’) or a topographic name for someone who lived on a treeless ground derived from gol ‘treeless’. As a nickname it may also have the meaning ‘poor man’ (compare above and Golik). Compare Goltz.\n\nGolik : 1: Polish and Croatian; Czech (Golík): nickname from Polish goły Czech dialect golý and Croatian gol ‘naked hairless’ in Polish also ‘penniless’ (compare Golec). The homonymous Sorbian cognate Gólik is found in Germanized forms only (see Gulich).2: Jewish (from Ukraine): nickname from Russian golik ‘beggar ragamuffin’. Compare Polish name above.\n\nGruver : Possibly an altered form of German Gruber reflecting the Pennsylvania German pronunciation.\n\nHalfpenny : 1: English: nickname probably for a tenant whose feudal obligations included a regular payment in cash or kind (for example bread or salt) of a halfpenny. The tenants of Halfpenny Field in Elm (Cambridgeshire) for example had to pay a halfpenny per acre for the maintenance and repair of nearby Needham Dyke.2: Irish (Louth and Meath): shortened Anglicized form of Gaelic Ó hAilpín see Halpin.\n\nHalpenny : 1: see Halfpenny. 2: in Ireland adopted by folk etymology for Ó hAilpín; see Halpin.\n\nHelbling : South German: from Middle High German helbling ‘halfpenny’ applied as a nickname for a weak man or for someone who paid this amount in rent or taxes or for a stingy person.\n\nHelling : 1: English: variant of Hellen and Ellen.2: English: habitational name from Healing in Lincolnshire though its survival as a modern name is doubtful. The placename derives from the Old English personal name Hægel + the Old English groupname suffix -ingas.3: German and Dutch: nickname from Middle Low German hellin Middle Dutch hellinc hallinc ‘halfpenny’. Compare Helbling.4: German and Dutch: habitational name from any of various places called Helling or Hellingen (compare Heling) or in the north a topographic name from Middle Low German and Middle Dutch hellink hellinge ‘shipyard’.\n\nIdiens : apparently a late variant of Iddins. Compare Margt. Idiens 1758 Willm. Iddens 1761 in IGI (Trysull Staffs); William Iddens William Iddiens 1780 in IGI (Wombourne Staffs); Richard Iddens 1800 Richd. Idins 1811 James Harvey Penn Idens 1812 Ellen Iddiens 1830 Benjamin Idiens 1832 in IGI (Dudley Staffs).\n\nInkpen : from Inkpen (Berks) which is recorded as Ingepenne in 1167 and Yngelpenne in 1235–6. The place-name derives from Old English *ing ‘peak’ alternating with *ingel ‘peak’ (itself a derivative of *ing) + penn ‘small enclosure fold’.\n\nKilpin : from Kilpin (ER Yorks) which is recorded as Celpene in 959 (in a copy of about 1200). The place-name probably derives from Old English celf ‘calf’ + penn ‘enclosure’.in the S Midlands post-medieval examples may alternatively be variants of Culpin.\n\nLa Penna : Italian (also Lapenna): variant of Penna with the addition of the definite article la.\n\nMale : 1: Welsh: from the personal name Mael (literally ‘prince’).2: English (of Norman origin): nickname from Old French mail ‘mallet club mace’ or Middle English (Old French) maille ‘ring (of chain mail) armour’ or Old French maille ‘speckle stain’ or Middle English maille (Old French maaille) ‘coin worth half a penny’ or from a shortened form of Anglo-Norman French amel Old French esma(i)l ‘enamel’ (compare Mailer). Any of these terms might have been used to characterize an individual's behaviour occupation or appearance.3: English: nickname Middle English (Old French) male ‘bag pouch’ also ‘stomach belly’ perhaps given to someone who wore a distinctive pouch or bag or who made such bags (compare the Middle English occupational term malemakere) or to someone with a prominent belly.4: English (of Norman origin): variant of Madle a nickname from Old French Middle English masle madle (also Middle English male) ‘man adult’ or adjectivally ‘male masculine’.5: English: in Lancashire perhaps a variant of Meale either a nickname from Middle English mele ‘meal ground cereal’ perhaps for a maker or seller of meal (compare Millman) or a topographic name from Middle English mele ‘sand-hill’ (Old Norse melr) as found in such placenames as North Meols (Lancashire) Ravensmeols in Formby (Lancashire) and Great Meols (Cheshire) (compare Meil).6: Slovenian: nickname for a physically small man from a derivative of mal ‘small little’ (see Mal 1).

Compare Mele.\n\nMentiply : possibly a local variant of Moneypenny.\n\nMinchinton : perhaps from Minchington in Sixpenny Handley (Dorset) which is recorded as Munecheneton in 1307. The place-name means ‘farmstead of the nuns’ from Old English myncen ‘nun’ (genitive plural myncena) + tūn ‘farmstead estate’.\n\nMoneypenny : English (Lancashire): probably a nickname either for a rich man or ironically a poor one from Middle English many mony ‘many’ + peny ‘penny’ (see Penny).\n\nMonypenny : see Moneypenny.\n\nOfford : 1: English (East Anglia and London): habitational name from Offord Cluny and Offord Darcy in Huntindgonshire. The placename derives from Old English upp ‘up upper’ + ford ‘ford’.2: English: alternatively from a lost place called Offord near Pennyford in Wootton Wawen Warwickshire. The placename derives from the Old English personal name Offa + Old English worth ‘enclosure’.\n\nOlpin : English: habitational name from Owlpen in Gloucestershire. The placename derives from the Old English personal name Ola + penn ‘pen fold’.\n\nPainting : 1: in SW England a variant of the Hants name Penton and perhaps Pennington each of which had medieval spellings such as Penyng(e)ton. Penton (near Andover Hants) is spelled Peinton in a conveyance dated 1317 in Somerset Archives DDWHb/2688. Compare the 1327 Farmington (Gloucs) example of de Peynton cited below with John de Penynton 1327 in Subsidy Rolls (Fairford Gloucs). Penyn- has been reduced to Pen- and Peyn- and in the surname final -on has often been altered to -in and -ing. No evidence been found to support a derivation from Paignton (Devon) which does not seem to have given rise to a medieval surname. 2: for the name in the W Midlands see Painton. 3: in Lincs and Norfolk perhaps a variant of Pointon from Pointon (S Lincs) although the change from -oy- to -ey- is unexplained and is not recorded for the place-name. Pointon is not far from Moulton and Weston (Lincs) where the surname Peynton is recorded in 1381.alternatively a variant of Panton (from Great Ponton Lincs) although the -ey- spelling is difficult to explain. Great Ponton is also not far from Moulton and Weston.\n\nPainton : English (Berkshire and Staffordshire):: 1: variant of Painting a name chiefly found in Oxfordshire which is itself either a variant of Penton Pennington Pointon or Panton.2: variant of Pointon.\n\nPannaman : 1: from Middle English pan(i)er(e) pannier ‘basket’ + -man either for one who made or sold panniers or who transported goods in panniers; compare Panner (2). 2: from Middle English peni-man pani-man ‘penny man’ probably for a miser.

Compare Pennyfather.\n\nPannebaker : Americanized form of German Pannebäcker Pannebacker or Pfannebecker occupational names for a maker of roof tiles or a tiler (see Pennypacker) and possibly also of their Dutch cognate Pannebakker.\n\nPannifer : see Pennyfather.\n\nParnell : English: from the Middle English female personal name Pernel Parnell (Old French Peronel(le)) from Latin Petronilla a feminine pet form of the Latin personal name Petronius. Petronilla was the name of a supposed early Christian saint and martyr. This surname was also brought to Ireland from Cheshire in the 17th century by a family who had been supporters of Cromwell's Parliamentarians during the English Civil War. Charles Stewart Parnell who founded the Irish Parliamentary Party in 1882 was a descendant of this family. See also Pennell.\n\nPelland : Altered form of Breton (mainly Côtes-d'Armor) Pellan: habitational name from Pellan the name of several places in Brittany from penn ‘tip edge’ and lann ‘moor’.\n\nPellen : 1: perhaps a variant of Pellant. Some examples may belong under (2) or (3). 2: possibly in some cases of Dutch origin from Middle Dutch pellen pellijn ‘court or ceremonial dress; gaudy attire’ applied to a flamboyant dresser. 3: from a place so named in Finistère or Morbihan a contracted form of Penn al Lenn ‘the tip of the pond’. 4: from the Welsh personal name Pellen.\n\nPellington : probably a late variant of Pennington as suggested by Redmonds Dictionary of Yorks Surnames.\n\nPember : English: perhaps a variant of Pamber a habitational name from a place in Hampshire named Pamber from Old English penn ‘fold enclosure’ + beorg ‘hill’.\n\nPemberton : English: habitational name from a place in Greater Manchester called Pemberton from Celtic penn ‘hill head’ + Old English bere ‘barley’ + tūn ‘enclosure settlement’.\n\nPembro : from Pembroke often spelled Pennbro in the medieval period and Penfro in Modern Welsh.

Alternatively perhaps a cognate of French Payen (compare Pean). Compare also Pene 2 and Penn 8.4: Slovenian: nickname or ethnic name of the same origin as German Böhm (see Boehm) meaning ‘Bohemian’ (i.e. ‘Czech’). Alternatively from an old short form of the personal name Pernhart an old South German variant of Bernhard (see Bernard).5: Cambodian: written ប៉ែន of Chinese origin (see Bin 1).\n\nPence : 1: Americanized form of German Penz or Benz. Compare Hartpence.2: English (Yorkshire Cheshire and Staffordshire): nickname from Middle English pense plural of peni ‘penny’.

The Cornish places named Penhale derive from Middle Cornish *pen hal ‘moor's head marsh's head’ (pen ‘head top end; promontory’ hal ‘moor marsh’); Pennal (Merioneths) has the same meaning. Penheale derives from Middle Cornish pen + hel ‘hall’.\n\nPenicud : see Pennicott.\n\nPeninger : German: variant of Penninger. This surname is very rare in Germany.\n\nPenington : English (Lancashire): variant of Pennington. This form of the surname is rare in Britain and Ireland.\n\nPeniston : English (Yorkshire): habitational name from Penistone near Sheffield (Yorkshire) or less likely Penistone in Stainmore (Cumbria). The Yorkshire placename is of uncertain etymology but may derive from Proto-Welsh penn ‘head’ + the Old English placename forming suffix -ing (genitive -inges) + Old English tūn ‘farmstead estate’. The etymology of the Cumbrian placename is uncertain.\n\nPenistone : from Penistone (WR Yorks) which is recorded as Peningston in 1298 or less likely Penistone in Stainmore (Westm). The WR Yorks place-name is of uncertain etymology but may derive from Proto-Welsh *penn ‘head’ + the Old English place-name forming suffix -ing (genitive -inges) + Old English tūn ‘farmstead estate’.

The placename probably derives from Old English penn ‘fold enclosure’ or perhaps Celtic penn ‘head’ + Old English lēah ‘wood woodland clearing’. It is perhaps also a variant of Pendley. This surname is rare in Britain and Ireland.\n\nPenlington : probably a variant of either Pennington or Pendleton through confusion of the two names. Compare Edward Penington 1714 Richard Pendlington 1716 in IGI (Nantwich Cheshire); Tho Pendleton 1630 Tho Penlington 1640 John Pennington 1747 in IGI (Bunbury Cheshire); Eliz. Pendleton 1605 Margaret Pennington 1767 in IGI (Frodsham Cheshire).\n\nPenna : 1: Cornish: perhaps a hypocoristic form (with the Cornish suffix -ow) of a name in Pen- such as Pentec ‘fair head’ (Cornish pen ‘head’ + tec ‘fine fair’) or a similarly formed Cornish hypocoristic form of the Middle English female personal name Penne a short form of Pernel (Penn 3).2: Italian (mainly southern): probably a topographic name for someone who lived on a hill or peak or generally in an elevated location penna (from Latin pinnus ‘pointed’) a common element of placenames. Compare La Penna.3: Possibly also an American shortened form of Greek Pennas: from the vocabulary word penna ‘quill pen’ + occupational suffix -as hence a metonymic occupational name for a clerk or scribe. This is also the Greek feminine form of the surname.\n\nPennacchio : Italian: from pennacchio ‘plume of feathers’ (from Latin pinnaculum) applied as a nickname for someone who wore a plume of feathers perhaps a dignitary or knight or as a metonymic occupational name for someone who made such ornaments.\n\nPennachio : Altered form of Italian Pennacchio.\n\nPennack : see Pennock.\n\nPennamon : African American: altered form of English Penniman.\n\nPennant : Welsh and English: habitational name from Pennant (Denbighshire Cardiganshire) or from any of several minor places called with Welsh pennant ‘head of the valley’.

This form of the surname is rare in Britain and Ireland.\n\nPennell : English (especially southeastern):: 1: metronym from the Middle English female personal name Pennel (an assimilated form of Parnell).2: habitational name from Penn Hall in Pensax (Worcestershire) or from either of two places called Penhill in Devon and Yorkshire or possibly from Pendle in Lancashire. All of the placenames probably derive from British penn ‘head’ + Old English hyll ‘hill’.\n\nPennella : Italian: from pennello ‘pennant banner standard’ used for a standard-bearer or for a maker or seller of such items; alternatively from the same word used in the sense ‘river bank’ perhaps applied as a topographic name.\n\nPennells : variant of Pennell with post-medieval excrescent -s.\n\nPennels : see Pennells.\n\nPenner : 1: English (Middlesex and Warwickshire): occupational name from a derivative of Middle English pennen ‘to confine impound’ perhaps for one who impounded stray animals; compare Pinder Pounder.2: North German (including Lower Rhine): occupational name from Middle Low German penner ‘owner of a salt-boiling pan’.3: German: habitational name for someone from Penna near Leipzig.4: East German: name of Salzburg emigrants in East Prussia a topographic name derived from Middle High German biunte ‘separate part of land or enclosure belonging to a village’.\n\nPennewell : English: variant of Pennywell.\n\nPenney : English: variant of Penny.\n\nPenneycard : see Pennicott.\n\nPenniall : from Middle English peni-ale pani-ale ‘penny ale’ (Old English penig + ealu) for a thin ale costing a penny a gallon; the name probably signified a brewer or seller of ale.\n\nPennicard : see Pennicott.\n\nPennick : English (Essex): variant of Pennock.\n\nPennicott : 1: apparently from Middle English peni ‘penny’ + cod ‘bag wallet’ (Old English peni(n)g codd) perhaps meaning ‘money bag’ and used either for a wealthy man or in a pejorative sense for a miser. Compare Aluric Penipurs about 1057 in Winton Domesday (Winchester Hants) ‘penny purse’. Alternatively any or all of the following post-medieval bearers may belong under (2). 2: from Pennicott in Shobrooke (Devon) which is recorded as Pinecote in 1262 and Pynnecote in 1274. The place-name derives from the Old English personal name Pinna + Old English cot ‘cottage hut shelter’. 3: occasionally a variant of Pincott (1).\n\nPennie : Scottish (Aberdeenshire): variant of English Penny.\n\nPennill : see Pennell.\n\nPenniman : English: occupational name for the servant (Middle English man) of someone called Penny.\n\nPenning : 1: English Dutch and North German: from early Middle English penning Low German penning Middle Dutch penninc ‘penny’ (see Penny) a topographic name (from a field name) or a nickname referring to tax dues of a penny.2: South German: from the short form Panno of an ancient Germanic personal name derived from a word meaning ‘ban order command’.3: English: from a Middle English personal name Pening Pining presumably representing an unrecorded Old English name a pet form perhaps of Penda or of names like Pendhere and Pendwulf.\n\nPenninger : 1: German: habitational name for someone from any of several places called Penning.2: Altered form of German Pfenninger.3: Dutch and Flemish: from an agent derivative of Penning 1.\n\nPennings : English (Surrey and Staffordshire): variant of Penning with post-medieval excrescent -s.\n\nPennington : English (mainly Lancashire and Cumbria):: 1: habitational name from Pennington in Furness (Lancashire) which derives from Old English pening ‘penny’ + tūn ‘farmstead estate’ or from Pennington in Leigh (Lancashire) which probably derives from the Old English personal name Pinna + the Old English groupname suffix -ingas (genitive -inga-) + Old English tūn.2: habitational name from Pennington (Hampshire) or from Penton Grafton or Penton Mewsey (both Hampshire); see Penton. All have the same etymology as Pennington in Furness; see 1 above.\n\nPennino : Italian: from a diminutive of Penna or in southern Italy a topographic name from Sicilian pinninu ‘steeply sloping terrain or street’.\n\nPennisi : Italian (mainly eastern Sicily): habitational name from Pennisi a district of Acireale in Catania province.\n\nPennison : 1: Altered form of French (mainly Vendée) Pénisson: derivative of panis ‘millet’ (see Panis) used as a nickname for a grower or seller.2: English (London): from the Middle English personal name Penny + -son. This surname is rare in Britain and Ireland.\n\nPenno : O. J. Padel suggests it may be a hypocoristic form (with the Cornish suffix -ow) of a name in Pen- such as Pentec ‘fair head’ (Cornish pen ‘head’ + tec ‘fine fair’) attested in Roger Richard and William Pentec about 1230-5 in Cornish Deeds (Pydar Hundred) or Pengwyn ‘white head’ (Cornish pen + gwyn) attested in John Pengwyn 1514 in Cornish Deeds (Saint Columb Major Pydar Hundred Cornwall). Apart from the Saltash example below all the earliest bearers of Penno(w) etc. are located in places in Pydar Hundred.alternatively perhaps a variant of Penn (3) a pet form of the Middle English female personal name Pernel (see Parnell) + the Cornish hypocoristic suffix -ow. Since Parnell is an especially common surname in Devon and Cornwall it is reasonable to suppose that Pernel was used as a given name there.\n\nPennock : 1: English (mainly North Yorkshire): perhaps from an unrecorded Middle English personal name Penoc which might be a pet form of Old English Pǣgna of uncertain origin.2: Welsh: perhaps a nickname from Middle Welsh pennoc ‘big- headed’ ‘with a large head’ possibly ‘headstrong’.\n\nPenny : English:: 1: from Middle English peni peny ‘penny’ (Old English pening penig) applied as a nickname possibly for a person of some substance or for a tenant who paid a rent of one penny. This was the common ancient Germanic unit of value when money was still an unusual phenomenon. It was the only unit of coinage in England until the early 14th century when the groat and the gold noble were introduced and was a silver coin of considerable value. There is some evidence that the word was used in Old English times as a byname. This surname is also found in Ireland. Compare Halfpenny Farthing Grote and Shilling.2: alternatively a variant of Penning or Penn.\n\nPennycad : see Pennicott.\n\nPennycard : see Pennicott.\n\nMore\n\nSource : DAFN2 : Dictionary of American Family Names 2nd edition, ©2022 by Patrick Hanks and Oxford University Press\n\nFANBI : The Oxford Dictionary if Family Names in Britain and Ireland, ©2016, University of the West of England\n\nFANBI : The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain, ©2021, University of the West of England"
