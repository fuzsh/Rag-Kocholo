        "text": "Sean Penn's mother Eileen Ryan died on Sunday at her home in Malibu, a representative for the star announced.\n\nThe legendary actress, who appeared in over 60 television shows and films over her decades-long career, was mother to actor Sean, 62, musician Michael Penn, 64, and late actor Chris Penn, who died in 2006 at age 40 from cardiomyopathy.\n\nShe was married to actor and director Leo Penn from 1957 until his death in 1998.\n\nThe oldest of Ryan's three sons, Michael tweeted alongside fa photo of his mother and a broken heart emoji on Monday: 'We lost mom yesterday.'\n\nThe stage-trained actress would have turned 95 in one week on October 16.\n\nHer stage name Eileen Ryan comes from her real first name Eileen and her mother's maiden name Ryan.\n\nEileen often attended red carpet events with Sean and his friends, such as Julia Roberts, while she also made appearances in several of his movies including I Am Sam.\n\nBorn in New York in 1927, Eileen was the daughter of Rose Isabel, a nurse, and Amerigo Giuseppe Annucci, a dentist.\n\nIn 1957 she married Leo Penn, an actor and active union member, who was blacklisted from the late 1940s to the late 1950s.\n\nThe couple remained together for over 40 years, until Leo's death in 1998.\n\nThe entertainer's first television appearance was on the drama series Goodyear Television Playhouse in 1955.\n\nBefore that she appeared on Broadway, making her debut in 1953's Sing Till Tomorrow at age 25 and later acting in Comes a Day in 1958.\n\nEileen steadily showed up on TV shows and was often directed by her husband on episodes of shows like Bonanza, Cannon, and Little House on the Prairie.\n\nHer other television credits include The Twilight Zone in 1960, along with guest roles in hit '90s shows E.R., Ally McBeal and NYPD Blue.\n\nShe and their son Sean also shared a professional life, working together on The Indian Runner, All the King's Men, and I Am Sam, among others.\n\nBut before sharing the screen with her son, she paused her acting career to be a full-time mom for some years."
