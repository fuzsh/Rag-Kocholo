        "text": "NEVER MIND THE torrential downpour or the twilight darkness on this Saturday afternoon in New York. Disregard, too, the fact that he's nearly drenched in his hooded navy sweatshirt, blue Levis and black cowboy boots, and that he charges in and out of stores and restaurants with a bulk and a low center of gravity befitting his roots as a former high school wrestler. On screen or off, wet or dry, Chris Penn already seems hazily recognizable.\n\nFor one thing, he is the younger brother, by five years, of Sean Penn, though both are quick to dispel any notions of sibling rivalry. ''If you don't have it,'' says Sean, ''you don't even know how somebody could. We're fine.'' And Chris adds: ''Even if, God forbid, I wasn't his brother, I'd much rather be his brother than not. I love my brother.''\n\nChris Penn, at age 31 the veteran of some two dozen movies, has arrived in town from South Carolina, where he is shooting ''Liar'' with Tim Roth. Mr. Penn is spending a day working out at a gym, shopping and bar hopping in lower Manhattan before attending to matters like a forthcoming premiere for his latest movie, ''The Funeral.''\n\n''Hey, aren't you -- Sean Penn's little brother?'' asks one of three men at Cha Cha's cafe in Little Italy who offer to buy him a drink."
