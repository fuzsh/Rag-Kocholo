        "text": "⚠️⚠️AI Content Detected!!⚠️⚠️ That’s what my client told me, leaving me embarrassed.🥶 Had I used it? Yes, for the first time!!😅 I never believed in using AI. \"Just kills your purpose to write, your creativity.\" But then this particular project forced me to use, to brainstorm with better ideas So I did my homework to humanize AI content (more on this later) But when time came to verify whether my humanized content’s AI or not, it was confusing! Some tools qualified my content as Non-AI, and others still called it guilty of being AI. Interestingly, these tools also declared my client’s reference sample as AI. 🤣 I did mention to him, indirectly, but gotta focus on my work, else… So, after some research, I came across these tools that will effectively help you detect AI content. Let me share with you. 1. Writer: This is my go-to tool. Very basic. I found it effective. The best thing is, it shows results in % than just saying, AI or Non-AI. But this is not my stand-alone tool. 2. Content @Scale: I would say this is my primary go-to tool. It offers an amazing character limit. You can re-use as much. The best thing is that it’ll highlight the part of the sentence that sounds AI, in various color shades -- indicating the % of AI. Isn't that cool? 3. CopyLeaks: I WAS a fan of this! It’s extension just makes it easy! Unfortunately, it just says AI or non-AI 😥. But I found it quite accurate. The problem is, it has limitations in daily usage. But if you want % accuracy, try its trial. After that, you need to purchase it.😥 I’m just talking about the free ones here, but we would love to read your highlights in the comment box if you have a \"higher experience\". Honestly, I was not impressed with GPTZero or Sapling which are popular suggestions on the Google search. Neither did their reviews impress me. But here’s the bomb: My other client stated (they deal with AI daily), none of these are accurate. 😵💫 Yea, everyone claims 98% or more accuracy. I guess purchasing is the best option if you're looking for something serious. Conclusion: 1. It's good to leverage AI tools for brainstorming purpose and borrow ideas. But if you rely further, your content can be guilty of AI. 2. Detect AI using the above tools for accurate results. 3. Keep the content original. And don’t forget to share your experiences, and insights on AI detection. Until then... Asta la vista!🫡 P.S: My friend got amazing outreach using AI on LI. I'm confused, any comments?...😥 P.P.S: Here's a random pic I clicked this morning. Looks like the kitty slept all night, caught on camera! Stay connected! Stay wise! #ai #contentwriting #linkedingrowth\n\nFrom now on, I'll be labelling my content as #AI, or not! I love AI and I love using new AI tools that allow me to do things that I couldn't possibly do without them, or to simply save me time. I use AI frequently for content development, but I have to say this is principally for planning content or finding alternative words, headlines or other components for what I write. I have nothing against using AI to create content - and, for example, I create a lot of images via AI - so long as the finished copy is fit for purpose. The new wave of #GenAI content tools can prove to be extremely valuable, but there are risks with mass producing content without proper scrutiny, in particular in the business world. Meanwhile - in my book at least - claiming that you wrote something because you requested an AI output, is not much different to briefing someone else to write your copy. The original idea may be yours, but you still didn't write the copy! I strongly believe that #transparency is the key to the ethical and responsible use of AI, and so I already try to label any AI-generated content that I produce as such. However, I'm now going to take this one step further and begin to use more explicitly labelling of my content. Here's my list of labels!

So, a word of caution. It's vital that you confer with true experts and trusted human-generated sources when you create content. Of course, there are evident benefits of AI in terms of productivity, and I think it's great to lean on AI for inspiration, but if you're using it to create content without applying your human logic, research or creativity, you're potentially putting out misinformed, carbon-copy content that won't rank well and won't be supporting your audience or demonstrating your expertise.

As the boundaries between AI and human creations blur, he emphasizes the importance of fast-tracked media literacy. And, embracing \"fake by default«. That resonated with me. »Fake by default« fundamentally reshapes our worldview. Let me explain: »Fake by default« first found with Google in 2008, initially addressed intentionally wrong internet content or even just colored hair. But within the context of todays generative AI in media and heavily blurred lines between fact and fiction, its implications are far-reaching. 🪝 Human-made clickbait, tabloid-style headlines and accompanying images have proven effective. With generative AI now crafting content coupled with feedback loops, autonomous adaptation occurs at lightning speed based on clicks, consumption, and likes. Already around in digital advertising, and with 90% of distributed content soon to be AI-generated, we should anticipate a heightened human response in everything we encounter. 👩🏽🤝👨🏼 Let's factor humans into this: Our brains process the bulk of information we see unconsciously. Scroll through Instagram, and it's undeniable—cats and dogs are unbelievably cute. Stereotypes solidify over time, fueled by platform algorithms that maximize engagement, fostering biased reality bubbles through reinforced learning. What if AI produces fully personalized content, tailored to individual viewpoints and tonalities, making it even more appealing? Welcome to the era of AI mass customization, where mundane content is a thing of the past! 25 ago (when Prof. Peter Kabel and I last met - remember me?), the lines between right and wrong, true and false, were clearer. Today, trusted sources drown in a sea of new contenders, their content susceptible to enhancement by AI. 🧠 Can our brain deal with »fake by default«? Our brain works on a »true by default« basis. It excels at spotting exceptions to the known rules and then switches to power-save mode. The brain not designed to consciously process the overwhelming amount of media content we consume today for its truthfulness. And media literacy, though crucial, probably will never become a subconscious subroutine to filter out fake content. In the case of AI content labelling I sense we are in need of a broad discussion. ❓How do we deal with fictional bits of AI generated content? ❓Must or can viewpoints or biased selections of information be labelled? ❓Is \"wrong until proven right\" in news socially sustainable? Now, I'll go and give my cat 🐱 a pat in the »true by default« analog world 🌍. Feel free to leave a cat emoji in the comments if »fake by default« resonates with you too! 🙏🏼 Thanks for your attention."
