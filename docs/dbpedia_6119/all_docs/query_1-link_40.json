The game's basic premise, gameplay, visual, audio and characters from the 8-bit version are very similar to the arcade game, but the layout is completely different. There are over nine different missions - some which are inspired loosely by the arcade game - filled with several obstacles like pitfalls, conveyor belts, helicopter gunfire, and teleport platforms. There are a few new moves and weapons like hyper-uppercuts, jumping-knee-pads and incendiary bomb -s as well as new enemies labeled Right Arms and Ninjas. There are also story scenes at the beggining of each mission with text explaining the latest storyline developments. The game has an additional end boss not see in the the Arcade version plus a much happier ending.\n\nIn Japan, Palsoft made a Mega Drive Genesis port of Double Dragon II based on the Arcade game that was not very good, while Naxat Soft made their own PC Engine version using the NES game as a basis.\n\nVAPS Arcade/Coin-Op Double Dragon II The Revenge Census\n\nThere are 15,071 members of the Video Arcade Preservation Society / Vintage Arcade Preservation Society, 9,590 whom participate in our arcade census project of games owned, wanted, or for sale.
