        "text": "Double Dragon (Melbourne House) Game No. 251 Voting 5.27 points, 22 votes Company Mastertronic Publisher Melbourne House Musician Charles Deenen HVSC-File MUSICIANS/D/Deenen_Charles/Double_Dragon.sid Release 1988 Platform C64 Genre Arcade, Beat'em Up Gamemode Single player\n\n2 players (simultaneous) Operation Media Language Information Followers:\n\n* Double Dragon II - The Revenge\n\n* Double Dragon III - The Rosetta Stone,\n\n* Double Dragon (Ocean)\n\nDescription[edit | edit source]\n\nThe Double Dragon game series belongs to the most well-known and oldest Beat'em Up games. The first part was at first developed for the arcade machine by Technos Japan Corporation in 1987.\n\nIn general it is about beating yourself alone or in pairs through the levels in the role of the twins Billy and Jimmy Lee and at the end rescue a girl named Marian who had been kidnapped by a Street Gang, the Black Warriors. A speciality of the game is, that in the two-player mode you have to fight against each other in the end about who gets the girl.\n\nYou fight with fists, legs and with any possible item that is lying around or that you nick from your opponents. With the items you can either hit the enemy (baseball bat, whip) or throw the items at them (knife, barrel, box, rock).\n\nDesign[edit | edit source]\n\nThe conversion to the C64 comes across negatively in several aspects. The animation of the sprites is very reduced and between the upper and lower half is a small gap. Music is only available in the title screen, the FX are unworthy of the C64. The enemies have the intelligence of a rock. They do not appear when they should, e.g. Ling does not come through her door and Abbo comes through the wall. Furthermore, they all look the same. Jeff is not there. From the weapons only the baseball bat and the whip are left, which in addition are completely the same. From the special moves the throw was left out. Billy and Jimmy's repertoire is limited to the hairgrab-kick, a punch, a kick and a useless headbutt. The two player mode is there, but the fight about Marian does not take place. Except for the passable background graphics there is not much left from the machine...\n\nHints[edit | edit source]\n\nControls\n\nfire button = left or right fist punch (in viewing direction)\n\nJoy right + fire = footkick forward.\n\nJoy right + fire = If you stand very close to an opponent, a \"hairgab-kick\" is done. A bad punch...\n\nJoy backward + fire = headbutt\n\nJoy left/backward + fire = whirlwind kick\n\nJoy left + fire = elbow kick backward\n\nJoy forward + fire = jump\n\nJoy forward/left = jump back\n\nJoy forward/right = jump forward\n\nEnemies\n\nLopar\n\nAbobo (intermediate boss)\n\nWilliams (punk)\n\nLinda Lash (female punk with whip)\n\nChintai\n\nWilly (end boss)\n\nSolution[edit | edit source]\n\nJoystick to permanent fire and you will play through the game without problems. More than the punch is not needed in this game.\n\nCheats[edit | edit source]\n\nVoting[edit | edit source]\n\nVoting of the C64-Wiki users (10=the best vote): 5.27 points at 22 votes (rank 952).\n\nYou need to be logged in to cast a vote.

Apart from the fact, that the graphics and the movements of the sprites have nothing in common with the original, also all features of the machine were left out. Enemies, weapons, special moves are missing, the end fight in the two player mode is omitted. The sound is below every critic. There is no highscore list, not even an end evaluation. There are better ones for the C64...\".\n\nTheRyk: \"The music is the only thing I really like. Fighting is damn tough due to the poorly coded controls and the limitation of possible moves. Additionally, the scrolling is halted until you finish an enemy. Due to that, you sometimes have to fight two opponents simultaneously with very limited manoeverability which means you have very little chance of survival, e.g. on the roof in level 2. This is really no good beat'em up game, actually even Target Renegade is more playble. I cannot rate the Mastertronic trash game Double Dragon higher than so-so 4 points, appreciating there is at least a 2 player mode, though it's not significantly better than the solo game.\"\n\nMiscellaneous[edit | edit source]\n\nIn 1991 the game was re-issued (see Double Dragon (Ocean)).\n\nFollower\n\nDouble Dragon II - The Revenge (1989)\n\nDouble Dragon III - The Rosetta Stone (1991)\n\nCover\n\nHighscore[edit | edit source]\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nWikipedia: Double_Dragon\n\nC64Games.de - Game No. 46\n\nLemon64 - Game No. 752\n\nGamebase64.com - Game No. 2277\n\nC64.com - Game No. 626\n\nTest Report No. 738 on Kultboy.com\n\nZZap64 test report\n\nDouble Dragon V1 (MH) at GTW\n\nDouble Dragon Dojo"
