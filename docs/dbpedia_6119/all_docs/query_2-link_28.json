        "text": "Let the countdown to Chinese New Year begin!\n\nAccording to the lunar calendar, Chinese New Year — also called the Spring Festival — falls on Feb. 10 and celebrates the year of the Wood Dragon.\n\nIn comparison to western astrology, which uses a solar calendar based on the position of the sun, Chinese metaphysics consultant Vicki Iskandar tells PEOPLE that the Chinese zodiac uses both solar and lunar calendars, which is based on phases of the Moon.\n\n\"Seasonal celebrations and festivals such as the Lunar New Year follow the lunar calendar,\" says Iskandar, who's also the author of The Chinese Five Elements Oracle. The date is determined each year based on when the moon turns new in China, which falls one day after the new moon rises in the United States on Feb. 9, 2024.\n\nWhile the Lunar New Year follows the lunar calendar in Chinese astrology, Iskandar explains that \"a new astrological year falls on Feb. 4 each year according to the solar calendar.\" This calendar is used by Chinese astrologers to calculate a person’s natal chart.\n\n\"Babies born between Feb. 4, 2024 to Feb. 3, 2025 will have the Wood Dragon as the animal sign of their birth year,\" says Iskandar. \"Since the astrological year starts on Feb. 4 each year, those born between Jan. 1 to Feb. 3 will still have the previous year’s animal sign as their zodiac sign.\"\n\nChinese zodiac signs are represented by 12 animals, in comparison to Western astrology signs which were named after constellations in the sky. Also, a person's Chinese zodiac sign is divided on a year-by-year basis rather than a month-by-month basis Western astrology; they also are assigned an element (wood, earth, fire, metal or water) based on their birth year.\n\n\"A person’s Chinese zodiac sign is determined by his or her date of birth,\" explains Iskandar. \"So a person born in the year of the Rabbit [last year's sign] will always have the Rabbit as their zodiac sign.\"\n\nTo learn what the Year of the Dragon could be for you based on your Chinese zodiac signs, per Vicki Iskandar's predictions, read on!\n\nDragon (1940, 1952, 1964, 1976, 1988, 2000, 2012)\n\nFor those born in the year of the Dragon, 2024 is your year! Many changes and opportunities may arise in 2024 as the Grand Duke Jupiter visits your sign.\n\n“The year one encounters the animal sign of their birth is usually a life-changing one, and it often coincides with Jupiter return in one's natal chart,” writes Iskandar in her prediction blog.\n\nThe Dragon as a Yang Earth sign possesses resilience and confidence, and are “naturally lucky and successful” due to their intelligence and strong intuition.\n\nIskandar warns of “self-sabotaging behaviors,” though, as the Dragon is afflicted with the “Double Dragon Penalty,” which can cause “self-doubts and self-defeating thoughts and actions” as a result.\n\nSince 2024 is a Dragon return year, Iskandar notes you’ll “have the power to turn your life around for the better” if you stay positive and believe in yourself. She recommends keeping a bird charm on you for good luck.\n\n“It’s a good idea to carry a charm or symbol of the Bird or the Rooster as the Dragon’s secret friend this year for protection,” writes Iskandar, noting a Phoenix as one of her top suggestions.\n\nSnake (1941, 1953, 1965, 1977, 1989, 2001, 2013)\n\nFor those born in the year of the Snake, this is your prep year! As a sign that embraces change, Iskandar stresses the importance of visualizing “where you’d like to be in 2025” as the Year of the Dragon “brings excitement” which “many positive stars in your chart.”\n\nOnce you can visualize what you want the future to look like, then Iskandar notes you’ll be able to “start taking the steps now to get you there.” She adds that you’ll also want to start getting ready for your Snake return year.\n\n“Since the Snake shares the same Southeast palace as the Dragon in the Bagua map, visited by star 2 of illness, prioritize your health,” writes Iskandar. “As a Yin Fire sign, the Snake’s energy level and emotions can be up and down – check in often with yourself and rest to recuperate.”\n\nHorse (1942, 1954,1966, 1978, 1990, 2002, 2014)\n\nFor those born in the year of the Horse, 2024 is a year to listen. Iskandar notes that this Yang Fire sign had a “sociable” 2023 “with the Rabbit as the Horse’s Peach Blossom star,” which means that the year of the Wood Dragon “is poised to be a quieter year” for Horse signs.\n\nWith the Dragon leaving the Horse alone, Iskandar predicts the Horse will get “a chance to create their own stories this year and carve their own path.” She says your natural “charismatic and optimistic” nature will benefit you with this endeavor.\n\nIskandar recommends doing “thorough research” and reading contracts “carefully” before “committing to a project or a financial commitment.” This is because a “hostile star 7 visiting the South palace where the Horse is located in the Bagua map,” she writes.\n\nFurthermore, Star 7 is also associated with speaking, which is why Iskandar considers 2024 “a great year for those who’d like to train to be a better public speaker.” Keep outting in the work,” she predicts the “rewards will come in 2025.”\n\nSheep (1943, 1955, 1967, 1979, 1991, 2003, 2015)\n\n2024 may require a bit of problem solving for those born in the year of the Sheep — but don’t worry, you’re capable!\n\nComing off a year of “harmony and support” as an “ally of the Rabbit” in 2023, Iskandar predicts the year of the Dragon “is poised to be a bumpier, slower year for the Sheep.”\n\nThis is because the Dragon “squares the Sheep,” she writes. Fortunately, Iskandar mentions that this Yin Earth sign “is highly resourceful and can find solutions to any problem.”\n\nIskandar suggests turning to your peers to “collaborate instead of competing with those who can help you.” She also recommends keeping a pen and paper on you to jot down ideas that may arise.\n\n“Inspiration comes easy this year with star 9 of joy and prosperity visiting the Southwest sector where the Sheep resides in the Bagua chart,” Iskandar notes. “As a star of relationship, star 9 helps you find partners and allies.”\n\nMonkey (1944, 1956, 1968, 1980, 1992, 2004, 2016)\n\nFor those born in the year of the Monkey, take advantage of 2024 as Iskandar predicts “a more harmonious year as an ally of the Dragon.” This is because the Dragon can provide “support and grounding” to the “fast-paced” Monkey.\n\n“As a travel star and a Yang Metal sign, the Monkey is swift and doesn’t hesitate to step outside of the comfort zone,” writes Iskandar. “This is an ideal year to keep expanding your boundaries. Rely on your sharp instinct in taking a leap into the unknown.”\n\nIskandar highlights that metal is the element “that controls Wood,” which gives the Monkey “the power and the skills to make 2024 — the Year of the Wood Dragon — one of your best years.”\n\nShe also stresses the importance to “follow what excites the heart,” as star 9 of “joy and prosperity” is in the Southwest sector where the Monkey resides in the Bagua chart. Star 9 is “associated with the Fire trigram and the heart,” Iskandar writes.\n\nRooster / Bird (1945, 1957, 1969, 1981, 1993, 2005, 2017)\n\nFor those born in the year of the Rooster, things will feel much calmer. Now that the Dragon is here, Iskandar notes that this sign — which is also symbolized by the Bird — “can take a sigh of relief” this year.\n\n“As the sign opposite the Rabbit, the Bird was under heavy pressure from the Grand Duke in 2023,” she writes, “which may have affected important relationships as both the Rabbit and the Bird are Peach Blossom stars.”\n\nThe Bird is the Dragon’s “secret friend,” a unique dynamic that can be especially beneficial since the Bird “is now the most favored sign of the zodiac.” But the Dragon isn’t your only friend!\n\nIskandar predicts that “everyone will want to be your friend” in 2024. As a Yin Metal sign, she explains how the Bird “loves being the center of attention.”\n\nElsewhere in her prediction, Iskandar writes that “sacrifices” made in 2023 are likely to “pay off in the next two years” because of you’ll have the support of your ally, the Snake, in 2025.\n\nBut don’t put all the work on your ally, as Iskandar emphasizes you should “use your sharp mind and laser-like focus to design the life you envision.” Plus, she points out the additional support from the Heaven and Earth, presenting “many opportunities to make your mark.”\n\nUse this year to “take advantage of this great momentum and be proactive in collaborating with your allies,” writes Iskandar. “Align your dreams and visions with the right actions and doors will keep opening for you.”\n\nDog (1946, 1958, 1970, 1982, 1994, 2006, 2018)\n\nFor those born in the year of the Dog, big changes are near! “The Dog has enjoyed growth and plenty of support in the past two years as an ally of the Tiger and secret friend of the Rabbit,” writes Iskandar.\n\nNow, Dogs can expect a “transformative” and “pivotal” year, according to Iskandar’s predictions. This is in part due to the Dog being opposite the Dragon, which can be why you feel like you’re at a “crossroads in one or more aspects of life.”\n\nIn order to combat this, Iskandar suggests “initiating your own changes instead of fighting them.” She also notes that the Dragon and Dog are both Yang Earth signs, so to “be mindful in your movements and keep a high awareness of your surroundings.”\n\nWith star 4 of studies visiting the Northwest sector where the Dog resides in the Bagua map, Iskandar notes “there may be opportunities to further your studies.” Furthermore, there may be opportunity if you’re looking for love.\n\n“Those who are single may date more during the year as star 4 is also a star of romance and seduction,” writes Iskandar. However, she stresses the important to “practice discernment if you’re already partnered as the star can also cause affairs.”\n\nPig (1947, 1959, 1971, 1983, 1995, 2007, 2019)\n\nFor those born in the year of the Pig — also symbolized as a Boar — you’re in luck, according to Iskandar! Fortunately, she writes the “blessed couple of years” you had in 2022 and 2023 “continues in 2024.”\n\nHowever, Iskandar notes that you may “start feeling some growing pressures on the work front.” That means, this is a year “to solidify your position” now!\n\nWhy? Because Iskandar predicts the Snake will “oppose your sign” in 2025, which she explains can bring “once-in-a-lifetime opportunities as well as challenges to overcome.”\n\nA helpful suggestion is to “visualize where you’d like to be in 2025 and start taking the steps to get there in this year of the Dragon,” writes Iskandar. “As a travel star, the Pig thrives in a fast-paced environment and is comfortable with change.”\n\nRat (1948, 1960, 1972, 1984, 1996, 2008, 2020)\n\nFor those born in the year of the rat, 2024 is your year to bounce back! Iskandar explains that your sign went through \"a half clash\" with the Rabbit in 2023 which \"affected various relationships and partnerships.\"\n\nNow, Iskandar predicts that the Rat \"can expect a more supportive 2024\" as an ally of the Dragon. But don't completely brush aside 2023, as the lessons learned during that year will help the Rat \"refine their interpersonal skills to improve\" those relationships that might've been affected.\n\n\"Work in the spirit of collaboration and use your clever mind to expand your influence, you have the Dragon power backing you!\" Iskandar writes. \"This year the universe puts you in a positive light, and the more you put in, the more you will get in return.\"\n\nNow is the time to \"be proactive and strategic,\" adds Iskandar, noting that star 8 of wealth is \"visiting the North palace where the Rat is located in the Bagua map.\" This way, you can better \"monetize opportunities coming your way.\"\n\nOx (1937, 1949, 1961, 1973, 1985, 1997, 2009, 2021)\n\nFor those born in the year of the Ox, get ready to put your head down and work. \"With hard work and dedication,\" Iskandar predicts \"success is in store\" in 2024!\n\nBoth the Dragon and the Ox are known for their resilience and consistency,\" she writes. If you were born in an Ox year, Iskandar explains that the Dragon year may \"be a relief\" after an \"unpredictable year\" of the Rabbit.\n\nThough it may seem difficult, Iskandar emphasizes that you \"trust\" that \"all your hard work will be rewarded... especially in 2025 the year of the Snake, an ally of the Ox!\"\n\nThe Ox's biggest supporter comes from the \"heavenly realm,\" she explains of the astrological significance. This is due to \"star 6 of power and authority (associated with the Heaven trigram) visiting the Northeast sector where the Ox resides in the Bagua chart.\"\n\nTake advantage of this movement! \"Connect to the spirit within whenever you need guidance from your inner wisdom,\" writes Iskandar. \"Your tenacity and strength will empower your moves.\"\n\nTiger (1938, 1950, 1962, 1974, 1986, 1998, 2010, 2022)\n\nFor those born in the year of the Tiger, pack your bags! As the travel star of the Dragon, Iskandar notes that you \"can expect to travel more\" in 2024.\n\nWhether the purpose of your getaway is for personal or professional reasons, Iskandar predicts that the Tiger \"will be going places near or far\" — though she warns, \"Keep a high awareness of your surroundings.\"\n\nThis is because the Tiger is a \"fast-paced\" travel star that \"loves to be on the move,\" but may find that \"the pace of the Dragon to be too slow\" and will have to slow themselves down in order to let everyone around them catch up.\n\nAs a Yang Wood sign (the first of the ten heavenly stems), Iskandar writes that the Tiger is \"naturally always ahead of the times.\" She explains, \"As the Tiger shares the same Northeast palace in the Bagua map with the Ox, visited by star 6 of power and authority, believe in your own originality.\"\n\nLastly, Iskandar is sure to note that \"what you start in 2024 may be what your community needs later, they just can’t see it yet.\" She adds, \"You're the one uniquely blessed with the foresight and creativity.\"\n\nRabbit (1939, 1951, 1963, 1975, 1987, 1999, 2011, 2023)\n\nIf you were born in the year of the Rabbit, now's the time for you to relax! In comparison to 2023, Iskandar writes that the year of the Dragon is expected to be \"a much quieter year\" for you.\n\nBut just as you take that \"sigh of relief,\" Iskandar emphasizes that you \"celebrate your wins from 2023 as the year of the Dragon stars and use those wins as a stepping stone toward something even bigger!\"\n\nAs a Yin Wood sign, Iskandar notes that the Rabbit is \"visionary and able to turn the mundane into extraordinary, original works.\" Take advantage of that during this time, especially as you come off the new phase you began in 2023.\n\n\"Now is a time to grow and nurture the seeds you planted in 2023,\" write Iskandar. \"Follow your curiosity to keep opening up your consciousness.\"\n\nShe explains, \"With star 1 of wisdom and future prosperity occupying the East sector where the Rabbit is in the Bagua map, focus and invest on a long term vision.\""
