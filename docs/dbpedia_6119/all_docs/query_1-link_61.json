        "text": "The Virtual Console on Nintendo 3DS may not have a lot of games, but at least Nintendo is doing some cherry-picking of the best games of the era (between the black-and-white Game Boy and the Game Boy Color there were nearly 1000 games released in the U.S. alone).\n\nOne of the currently available downloadable classics that I dumped many an hour into back in the day is Double Dragon, a reasonably competent version of the quintessential beat-em-up. Besides being a decent way to waste $4 and a few hours while you're waiting for the next good 3DS game, it's an excellent time to abuse the hell out of the Virtual Console's \"restore point\" feature.\n\nDouble Dragon comes from the \"Oh no, our game is only 20 minutes long so let's make it impossible\" school of classic game design. You can get halfway through the game without breaking a sweat, punching and kicking street thugs into the pavement with reckless abandon. (As a kid I found that the most efficient way to dispatch them was to punch twice and then kick twice, a combination that immediately kills every low-level enemy.)\n\nBut somewhere around the mid-point of Mission 3, where you have to fight a giant musclebound Abobo on a tiny ledge with no room for maneuvering and every possibility of you simply falling to your instant death, Double Dragon starts throwing up every possible barrier to your success. If you do beat him, congratulations, now you just have to do the whole second half of this level without dying or you go all the way back to the beginning.\n\nOf course, the second half of this level includes jumping across moving platforms, something that your hero does with all the effortless grace of a hippopotamus on NyQuil. This Abobo fight turns out to mark the end of Double Dragon the beat-em-up and the beginning of Double Dragon the most awful platforming game ever.\n\nBut there is hope: The Virtual Console, like any good emulator, lets you save and restore your game wherever you like. So you can just mark your progress right before the Abobo fight or anything. It's still a difficult game, but now it's beatable with a reasonable amount of effort.\n\nThe promise of going back to games that absolutely stymied me as a child and that are now completable makes the black-and-white Virtual Console make a little more sense. Not only do I not feel bad about it, I feel like cheating finally evens the odds.\n\nThe 21 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nElvis, Brittany Runs a Marathon, and American Fiction are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Amazon Prime Video this week.\n\nThe 30 Best Shows on Apple TV+ Right Now\n\nSunny, Constellation, and Bad Monkey are among the best shows on Apple TV+ this month.\n\nThe 36 Best Shows on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nThe Boys, Batman: Caped Crusader, and Fallout are just a few of the shows you should be watching on Amazon Prime Video this week.\n\nWe Tried 30 Popular Energy Drinks. Here’s How They Rank\n\nThe future is here, and it is jacked up on B vitamins, red dye, and taurine. These are the best energy drinks to get from tired to wired.\n\nThe 21 Best Movies on Apple TV+ Right Now\n\nFancy Dance, The Velvet Underground, and The World’s a Little Blurry are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Apple TV+ this month.\n\nThe 51 Best Movies on Netflix Right Now\n\nWicked Little Letters, Lumberjack the Monster, and Godzilla Minus One are just a few of the movies you should watch on Netflix this month.\n\nThe 40 Best Shows on Max (aka HBO Max) Right Now\n\nHouse of the Dragon, The Sopranos, and Industry are just a few of the shows you need to be watching on Max this month."
