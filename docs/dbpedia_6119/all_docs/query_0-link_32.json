        "text": "Street Fighter, electronic fighting game series, originally released as an arcade game in 1987 by the Japanese game manufacturer Capcom Company. The popular arcade game gave rise to an entire genre of fighting games and spawned a multitude of sequels and spin-offs.\n\nThe first Street Fighter was a side-scrolling kick-and-punch game, similar to Double Dragon or Final Fight. The main player controlled Ryu, and a second player could join in by controlling Ken; together they fight their way through challengers using martial arts moves. With the release of the groundbreaking Street Fighter II: The World Warrior in 1991, the formula shifted to player-versus-player round-based combat. Players selected characters from a roster of fighters with unique styles from around the world. Special moves were available by keying in directional pad and button combinations, which added an extra level of skill to the game."
