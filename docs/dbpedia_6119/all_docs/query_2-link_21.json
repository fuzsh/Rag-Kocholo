        "text": "Double Dragon Revive is a new 3D game in the veteran beat ‘em up series published by Dragon Ball FighterZ and Guilty Gear Strive developer Arc System Works and developed by AEW Fight Forever maker Yuke's.\n\nThe Japanese developer announced Double Dragon Revive with the release of a teaser trailer, below, that shows off the new 3D visuals.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nDouble Dragon Revive features returning characters and familiar gameplay in which you pick up weapons scattered throughout the stages and use area gimmicks to defeat enemies. Here’s the official blurb:\n\nThe Double Dragon series has defined the belt-scroll action genre ever since it hit the arcades in 1987. Now it returns as Double Dragon Revive, thanks to the passionate support of retro game fans over the years!\n\nThe game provides a modern belt-scroll action experience with exhilarating gameplay making full use of Arc System Works’ experience with fighting game development.\n\nDouble Dragon Revive is set for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and Steam in 2025. A physical edition is set for PS4 and PS5, with digital on PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X and S, and Steam. There is no Xbox One or Nintendo Switch version.\n\nDouble Dragon was a mainstay on arcades and consoles through the late '80s and and early 90s, appearing on a multitude of platforms and at one point teaming up with the Battletoads (it's true). It's revered as one of the most influential beat 'em ups of all time, with classics like Final Fight and Streets of Rage following in its footsteps.\n\nArc System Works acquired the rights to Double Dragon and fellow classic beat ‘em up series Kunio-Kun (River City) from Technos Japan Corp in 2015. Since then, it has released multiple games in the aforementioned series. Chief among them is Double Dragon 4, which was made in collaboration with the series’ original director Yoshihisa Kishimoto, and its anime-influenced spin-off River City Girls.\n\nWhile the former received poor reviews, the latter garnered critical acclaim. What’s more, River City Girls 2 featured Double Dragon leads Billy and Jimmy Lee as playable DLC characters. A roguelike spin-off, titled Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, released in 2023 to average reviews.\n\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
