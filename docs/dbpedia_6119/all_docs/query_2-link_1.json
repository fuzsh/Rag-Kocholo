        "text": "For other uses, see Double Dragon (disambiguation).\n\nDouble Dragon is an American-Canadian-Italian animated series based on the video game series of the same name. It was produced by DIC Animation City, Bohbot Entertainment and Italian studio Reteitalia, S.p.A., in association with Spanish network Telecinco, and ran for 26 half-hour episodes from 1993 to 1994.\n\nOverview[]\n\nThe premise of the show had the protagonist brothers separated at birth, with Billy raised by an elderly martial arts master known as the Oldest Dragon, and his brother Jimmy raised by the evil Shadow Master as his second-in-command, the Shadow Boss. As a result, the Lee brothers oppose each other as adults, but Jimmy is betrayed by the Shadow Master and joins his brother as a \"Dragon Warrior\". During the course of the series, the brothers recruited allies in their war against the Shadow Master (voiced by Jim Byrnes) and his henchmen. The futile search for their father, John Lee, was a subplot throughout the series.\n\nThe plot of the pilot episode of the series is loosely based on the NES version of the first Double Dragon game. Like in the game, Jimmy is revealed to be the Shadow Boss in this episode, with his henchmen being Abobo and Wild Willy, who were boss characters in the game as well. By the end of the second episode, Abobo and Willy are sucked into the Shadow Mural, never to be seen again, while Billy and Jimmy join forces to fight against the series' true antagonist, the Shadow Master. All of the characters introduced from the second episode and onward were original creations made for the show. The story and characters of the animated series would be used in the Tradewest-produced Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls, a Double Dragon fighting game released for home consoles. Also, there was a feature film titled The Shield of Shadow Khan, which was conformed by three of Season 2's episodes: \"Shadow Khan\", \"Shadow Claw\" and \"Doom Claw\".\n\nCast[]\n\nDouble Dragons[]\n\nIn the series, Lee brothers are martial arts instructors and police consultants, who assume superheroic identities at moments of escalated violence. They usually transform out of those forms by crossing swords again and saying in unison \"we are double dragons!\", although several episodes show that heavy injury can deactivate their powers. Injury sustained by one is also taken by the other (although this ability is inconsistently shown); and if one has his powers deactivated by injury, so will the other. The brothers infrequently show an ability to sense when the other is in danger. They are the leaders of a small group of 'Dragon Warriors' endowed with superhuman powers based on the use of a smokeless, green 'dragon fire'. The Lee brothers also had green dragon tattoos on their chests revealed to be birthmarks from birth, which were concealed by their undershirts but visibly seen when they were in a transformed state.\n\nBilly Lee (voiced by Michael Donovan): The more peaceful of the two protagonists. He regularly wears a blue outfit with a red undershirt, and a blue sleeveless garb with a matching red dragon mask when he transforms (and later as the second Shadow Boss). By acquiring the Dragon Claw in the second season, he wore a blue modfied samurai-esque dragon suit along with an updated red dragon mask to give boost to his dragon power. At the near end of the second season, he gained a sleeveless red armor with a dragon design given by Kami to increase his dragon power. Billy has the most outfits than his brother Jimmy in the entire series.\n\nJimmy Lee (voiced by Scott McNeil): The more belligerent (and often sarcastic) of the two protagonists. He regularly wears a red outfit with a blue undershirt, and a red sleeveless garb with a blue dragon mask when he transforms. By acquiring the Dragon Claw, he wore a red medieval-like dragon suit to display the dragon tattoo on his chest and wears an updated blue dragon mask to give boost to his dragon power. At the near end of the second season, he gained a sleeveless blue armor with a dragon design given by Kami to increase his dragon power.\n\nDragon Warriors[]\n\nThe Dragon Warriors are Billy and Jimmy's subordinates; each has their own distinct costume and powers.\n\nCol. Neil \"Blaster\" McReady (voiced by Alvin Sanders): A retired U.S. Special Forces officer, who discovers his neighborhood being threatened by the Shadow Master's drug 'Oblivion', and assists the Double Dragons to destroy its production. He is the only person who easily noticed the Lee brothers' real identity within their transformed state. Blaster is the second of the Dragon Warriors.\n\nVortex (voiced by Ian James Corlett): A boy trained by John Lee, and later orphaned by the Shadow Warriors. Later made a Dragon Warrior. It was later revealed he was illiterate, by reason of living in the streets after the Shadow Warriors killed his parents.\n\nKona \"Tsunami\" (voiced by Garry Chalk): A Hawaiian Sumo Wrestler, trained in Chi by Su Lien; later made a Dragon Warrior who uses chi to fight.\n\nMike \"Chop\" Pollard (voiced by Garry Chalk): A former police officer who lost his right arm in a car accident and now works as mechanic; tricked by the Shadow Master into making vehicles for the Shadow Warriors, as well as a black prosthetic right arm. Once he realizes his mistake, he makes the Double Dragon Cruiser for the Double Dragons. Demonstrating his agility by dodging the Shadow Master's attacks during their handicap, he builds himself a robotic right arm and is later made into a Dragon Warrior. In the second season, he alongside Vortex create the Dragon Chopper, as the chopper they had made was controlled by the Dragon Spirit.\n\nKami: A vigilante martial artist capable of creating a magical armor. Initially desirous of petty revenge on the Shadow Master for her father's death, and later a disciple of Su Lien's. She was made a Dragon Warrior by the Lee brothers after she crafted their magical dragon armors.\n\nDaj (voiced by Ian James Corlett): A half human-half feline mutant of the settlement of mutants known as 'Undertown'. An ally of the Double Dragons and the son of the Undertown's current chief, Jano. He was later made a Dragon Warrior by the Lee brothers, being the first individual to become an Undertown Dragon Warrior and caretaker of the underground Dragon Temple.\n\nJunior Dragons[]\n\nThese are Billy and Jimmy's younger students, and supporting characters throughout the story.\n\nMichael (voiced by Wesley Morris): A boy who trains at the Dragon Dojo. He is the most seen of the Junior Dragons.\n\nJason: A student featured predominately in an episode where the Shadow Master sold plasma weapons to young street gang members. Jason bought such a weapon to get revenge for his sister's injury, but later relied on his martial arts instead.\n\nDaryl: A kid who initially wanted to become a Shadow Warrior and helped to trick Billy and Jimmy into a trap. He switched sides when he saw the Shadow Master almost kill Billy.\n\nDanny Linquist: A video game enthusiast and the son of Dr. Linquist, an archaeologist who uncovers artifacts for the Double Dragons.\n\nFriends and allies[]\n\nOldest Dragon (voiced by French Tickner): The original Master of the Dragon Dojo, who raised Billy Lee and reappears in subsequent episodes in spirit form, as an advisor.\n\nMarian Martin (voiced by Cathy Weseluck): A police officer who helps the Double Dragons; a major character during the first season, but a comparatively minor role in the second season.\n\nSu Lien: A tai chi chuan instructor who assists the Double Dragons in their quests. The Shadow Master has tried to capture her to learn her secrets.\n\nFireball: A young pyrokinetic imprisoned after taking part in a street gangs' war; paroled into the custody of the Dragon Dojo, and implied (though not shown) to later become a Dragon Warrior.\n\nJudge Rhodes: The righteous judge and justice chief of Metro City, who is currently allied with Marian Martin and the Lee brothers.\n\nMarika: The wife of John Lee and the mother of Billy and Jimmy, and the Shadow Master's half-sister. She willingly lets herself be trapped by her half-brother inside the Shadow Dojo to spare Jimmy's life. In one episode, Billy and Jimmy found her, but could not save her from the Shadow Master's clutches.\n\nDr. Linquist: Danny's father and friend of the Double Dragons. He is an archaeologist who discovered the Dragon Claws. He later helps Chop, Michael and his son Danny to counteract Shadow Khan's illusion after the Lee brothers and the other Dragon Warriors were captured by the Shadow Master and his warriors from getting struck by Shadow Khan's powers.\n\nMegabyte (a.k.a. Sean): A skilled computer hacker who helps the Dragon Masters to travel the information superhighway with the use of virtual reality technology. She's also became a brief love interest of Jimmy Lee.\n\nSachiko: An Interpol agent against cyber crimes, and Kona's girlfriend, who introduces the Dragon Warriors to Megabyte.\n\nJano: Daj's father and the chief of Undertown, who became a slave among the rest of his people by the Shadow Master, forced to craft a drug named RPM until he and Jimmy were rescued by Daj, Billy and Michael from becoming plant food, and which consequentially allows him to rescue his townsfolk from the factory's explosion. Jano also decided to stay in Undertown and allows his son Daj to make an alliance with the Lee brothers.\n\nDragon Spirit: A spirit who inhabited a sword. When the sword is destroyed by the Shadow Master, Chop uses the leftover metal in the Dragon Chopper. The Spirit of the Sword then inhabits the chopper and helps the Dragon Warriors fight. His original name was Dao Lung and he once belonged to Chen Long.\n\nChen Long: Chen Long was once a Dragon Warrior (literally, a dragon who was a warrior) who owned Dao Lung; presumed dead after his fight with the Shadow Monster, but later shown alive to fight it again.\n\nShadow Warriors[]\n\nMost of the Shadow Warriors are mutants. The Shadow Master says in \"Over the Line\" that these mutants are created by \"high levels of electromagnetic field generated by Metro City's ancient underground power grid\". According to the same episode, the EMF gives the Black Flame its power (the source of the Shadow Master's own magic).\n\nShadow Master (voiced by Jim Byrnes): The main antagonist of the series and the leader of Shadow Warriors. He has many powers which include shapeshifting and teleporting, and he is able to trap warriors who fail him in the Shadow Mural. He was the half-brother of Billy and Jimmy's mother.\n\nIcepick (voiced by Terry Klassen): A Shadow Warrior who appears to be made of ice, who fights using a katana and a pair of daggers, sheathed under his skin.\n\nSickle (voiced by Scott McNeil): A Shadow Warrior who specializes in disguises and is armed with two large red sickles.\n\nTrigger Happy (voiced by Terry Klassen): A purple-skinned Shadow Warrior, who uses a hand-mounted directed-energy blaster.\n\nCountdown (voiced by Alvin Sanders): A Shadow Warrior acquainted to make deals with the organization's allies. He attacks with shoulder-mounted rocket blasters. In \"Shadow Conned\", Shadow Khan manipulates him into betraying the Shadow Master, and as an outcome, Countdown was imprisoned in Shadow Khan's earlier prison.\n\nJawbreaker (voiced by Michael Donovan): A monstrous pink-skinned mutant, capable of biting through almost any solid matter. In \"Sight of Freedom\", he turns against the Shadow Warriors after befriending the police commissioner's blind daughter.\n\nAbobo (voiced by Blu Mankuma): A large blue thug with monstrous strength who works for the Shadow Boss in the pilot episode (\"The Shadow Falls\"). He is never seen after the second episode.\n\nWild Willy (voiced by Garry Chalk): A gunslinger who works alongside Abobo; punished alongside him in the second episode.\n\nShadow Khan (voiced by Alec Willows): Introduced in the beginning of the second season, he is a powerful sorcerer imprisoned in a shield by the Oldest Dragon. The Shadow Master uses the entrapped being to make himself more powerful, until Khan convinces Countdown to take his place. He is able to control his victim's worst fears, and is followed by a set of 'Terror Warriors' of similar power. He and his warriors are ultimately buried alive by Billy Lee.\n\nShadow Warriors (voiced by Michael Donovan): The Shadow Master's group of thugs. Two of them appear in Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls: a male known as Blade and a female known as Sekka.\n\nShadow Boss (voiced by Scott McNeil): Jimmy Lee's alter ego. In the feature film, they are separate characters.\n\nOthers[]\n\nHannibal: A huge doglike monster appearing in only one episode, \"Judgment Day\".\n\nLittle Brother: Daj's tame Western dragon; the mascot of Daj's underground Dragon Temple.\n\nLegs: A doberman Pinscher the Lee brothers found when they got trapped in the video game world after it was captured by Trigger Happy during their infiltration at the Dragon Dojo to steal their Dragon Claws.

Legs became the Lee brothers' pet for the rest of the second season.\n\nAdditional voices[]\n\nKathleen Barr\n\nRandall Carpenter\n\nBabz Chula\n\nRaj Eriksen\n\nSaffron Henderson\n\nMaxine Miller\n\nTracey-Lee Smyth\n\nJayleen Stonehouse\n\nMarcus Turner\n\nStevie Vallance/Louise Vallance\n\nAlec Willows\n\nEpisodes[]\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nProduction code Episode No.\n\n(first aired) Image Title Written by Original air date 101 1 \"The Shadow Falls\" Phil Harnage and Sandra Ryan September 12, 1993 Billy becomes the new Dragon Master of the Dragon Dojo and meets his twin brother, Jimmy.

Three vehicles were also made: The (Dragon) Cycle, Double Dragon Cruiser and Shadow Raven.\n\nReleases[]\n\nSelected episodes were released on VHS.\n\nOn August 2019, the complete series was released in a 3 disc DVD set.\n\nOn May 31, 2022, the complete series was released on Blu-ray by Discotek Media.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nOn the series' original run, most episodes were aired in different order than their production codes; this caused some sequence alterations in the overall storyline, such as certain characters already appearing as members of the Dragon Warriors before even being recruited.\n\nThe title of the first episode of the first season, \"The Shadow Falls\", was later used for the next Double Dragon game in the franchise, Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls, which is based on the animated series rather than on the previous games.\n\nIn the pilot episode, Billy speaks in a normal although a bit childish tone until the second episode and onward, where he speaks with a deeper pitch. Despite this change, he was still voiced by Michael Donovan.\n\nAlso in the pilot episode, Billy's red undershirt is similar to a loose wrestling singlet in order to display the dragon tattoo on his chest. This was changed in the second episode and onward to match up with Jimmy's blue undershirt.\n\nIn the pilot episode, Jimmy's gloves and wristbands were both black. They were later changed to blue to parallel Billy's red wristbands.\n\nJimmy only wears the Shadow Boss costume in the pilot episode. Billy would also become the Shadow Boss in one episode, when he loses his memory.\n\nMarian is a police officer instead of her usual role of damsel-in-distress. However, in the first episode, she was kidnapped as part of a plot devised by Jimmy and his underlings.\n\nVisually, the designs for Billy and Jimmy are modeled after their concept art and cover art appearance from Super Double Dragon.\n\nRelated products[]\n\nSlammer Whammers! - A series of milk caps released during the mid 1990s. \"Series IV\" was themed after this TV show.\n\n[]\n\nDouble Dragon at IMDb\n\nDouble Dragon (cartoon) at Double Dragon Dojo\n\nDouble Dragon: Other Media at Hardcore Gaming 101"
