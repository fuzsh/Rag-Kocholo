        "meta_description": "Now that you’re done with Super Mario Bros. Wonder, it’s time to hit the streets with a completely different pair of siblings – Billy and Jimmy Lee. That’s right, the Double Dragon Collection will be coming to PlayStation, Xbox and Switch on November 9th. This hotly-anticipated compilation will feature the Nintendo Entertainment System versions of Double Dragon, Double Dragon II: The Revenge and Double Dragon III: The Sacred Stones, as well as Super Double Dragon on Super NES, Double Dragon Advance on the Game Boy Advance and the awful Double Dragon IV from 2017. This sounds like an exciting collection, but I still need to ask: Are any of these games worth playing? To answer that question, I decided to flip through the pages of Electronic Gaming Monthly, Mean Machines, GamePro and more classic magazines to see what the critics said back when these games first came out. It’s time to put those sibling rivalries aside, because this is going to be a fist-pumping episode of the Double Dragon Review Crew.",
