        "text": "The Good\n\nThere are two separate C64 ports of Double Dragon (by Mastertronic vs Ocean). Both are bad, on the same level, but different ways. Althought not for the lack of trying! (Some of the war stories from the developers are known in C64 enthusiast circles.)\n\nAt least they can have multiple enemies and 2 players on screen at once (which is far more than what C64 Golden Axe had from later).\n\nThe Ocean version is a bit newer, and somewhat better on the technical and presentational front, but not that much that's it's worth it.\n\nThe SID chip can do wonders with soundtracks. Wether because or despite the composers, hard to decide in this case.\n\nThe Bad\n\nBoth conversions are barely playable, and look like a joke.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis is the time when arcade games started to exceed way above the capabilities of 8-bit machines, and the programmers had trouble figuring out how they can keep up with the demands of the publishers/buyers.\n\nAt least the port of DD2 turned out much better.\n\nThe Good\n\nIt's Christmas 1991, I receive Double Dragon. I don't know what it is. I stick it into the old Master System and load it up. 3 Hours later, I along with my Brother am still playing DD. Not exactly sure why, but I love this game.\n\nI think it has to do with the simplicity of the plot. Bad guy takes Girl, You fight entire Bad Guy Army and rescue Girl. Pretty simple. Perhaps it is the semi-sick plot twist at the end of the the two player mode, which pits Brother against Brother for the heart of the Girl. Perhaps it's the music. Who knows they're all great.\n\nDouble Dragon is a side scrolling beat-em-up. Perhaps one of the first. Most definitely the first I played. You have a range of karate style moves & there are several weapons to be found along the way which you must use to beat 4 levels worth of enemies to a pulp.\n\nThe final level is the most visually & technically accomplished as you make your way through the booby trap laden enemy HQ. The two player mode is the best way to play this game as this will allow you to see the bizarre ending, where you must slug it out with your own brother to get the girl. Quite strange, even today. This was a game which really pushed the Master System to it's limits but is a wholly enjoyable game, which appeared in one format or another just about everywhere.\n\nIt's not the best looking game now, but this was the one that spawned so many imitations. And one of the only titles I can remember where the Main Baddie wastes his own guys just to get you.\n\nA top game, that I still play every now and then.\n\nThe Bad\n\nOn the SMS version there was some quite bad clipping, which is a shame, as it's the only flaw.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nHead bashing from back in the day that still holds up.\n\nThe Good\n\nIt's Double Dragon on 2600! Oh, yay! If I was the only kid without either a Nintendo, Master System or 7800 . . . even one of those \"dead-format\" PCs from the Late '70s/Early-to-Mid '80s . . . then, hell yeah! It's Double Dragon on 2600!\n\nStrangely, I like the music in this version. All of the tunes are here, somehow. I don't know how, it just is.\n\nI also like how the characters blink to \"death\" like in the other 8-bit versions of this game (I don't remember is they blink in the arcade game, though, I haven't played that since I found it down by docks in LA Harbor in 1993 . . . don't ask what I was doing in either LA or the docks in '93), and as a plus, I just apply the Genesis 3-Button or Master System controllers in for an easier time. I don't dilly with the dally of the original Atari joysticks.\n\n(And why do those Atari games-in-a-joystick work better than Atari's original?)\n\nAlso, the packaging is cool, and a nice alternative to the standard Double Dragon boxes of the day.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThe cart is dull in design.\n\nThe music does get annoying if you play lots (but that can be said of all . . . video game music, to paraphrase Dracula from Symphony of the Night).\n\nThe sounds are . . . I don't remember sounds, hold on while I play the game real quick. Yup, there's your standard \"bloop and bleep\" Atari fare.\n\nThe controls, no matter what device used, sucks.\n\nHey, why are the thugs tougher that a Siberian winter with a jacket? Too me forever to master the moves, after losing like 100 times, then only to get my ass kicked next screen over.\n\nThen there's the color scheme . . . Activision on drugs? Any questions?\n\nAlso, Billy and Jimmy wear these little beanies on their head. They look like stereotypical sailors, and not the kind I want to meet. For that matter, almost everybody has beanies on . . .\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCheck out Double Dragon Dojo's review of this game, too. It's helpful.\n\nStill avoiding the polygon-game revolution? Why? Still think you should own that Atari 2600 for thirty years like a record player from Sears? Yeah, Atari's making that comeback right about now, don't you think? Just got a color monitor for your Apple ][ today, or so I've heard . . .\n\nSeriously, if you don't have any other method to play Double Dragon, find an old machine in a seedy bowling alley or biker bar. Buy this game at your own risk! I'm serious!\n\n(On a rant for a moment: I know that the 2600 hardware was old by 1988. Old by 1982, even! But still, Road Runner and the Nintendo Classics that were released on this system came out decent. I even have Kung-Fu Master and it rivals Nintendo's Kung-Fu, when I use a Genesis controller for play, but still . . . and that was done by Activision. It's not like I'm expecting Contra or Ninja Turtles on this console, but Double Dragon could've been done up like the arcade version, i.e. like Sega did for the Master System version, despite system limitations. From a programmer's POV, this is terrible, and even though the system was dead by its release, those few holdouts that used to exist before the PlayStation deserved better than this.)"
