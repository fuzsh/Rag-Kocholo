        "text": "Hello gentle readers, and welcome to the SwitchArcade Round-Up for July 27th, 2023. In today’s article, we have the tiniest little nugget of news to look at before we get to the main event of the day, the new releases. It’s another robust Thursday, especially for retro gaming fans. Double Dragon is back with a new game, Yggdra Union, Psychic 5, Batsugun, and Growl are back in the saddle, and we’ve even got some retro-inspired fare like Hyper Meteor. After summarizing all of them, we head into the lists of the latest and soon-to-expire sales for the day. Let’s go!\n\nNews\n\nA Pair of ‘The Legend of Zelda’ Games Have Been Added to Nintendo Switch Online\n\nA few days ago, I was thinking that July was about to wrap up without any additions to Nintendo Switch Online’s retro game apps. That would have been the first month since September 2021 without any new games, but Nintendo isn’t usually the sort to drop games without notice and the SEGA app had an update just last month. Fortunately, I turned out to be wrong. Nintendo dropped, without notice I might add, a pair of Game Boy Color games today. The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons are now available via the Game Boy app, so update your app and get to playing these classics.\n\nNew Releases\n\nDouble Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons ($24.99)\n\nBilly and Jimmy Lee return in this beat-em-up that feels more than a little inspired by the recent Shredder’s Revenge. Play as Billy, Jimmy, Marian, new character Uncle Matin, or one of nine other unlockable characters as you kick and punch your way through a variety of missions that take you across the post-apocalyptic streets of 199X New York. This is meant to be an origin story of sorts, or perhaps a reboot? This franchise has been all over the place tonally in all of the various attempts to revive it. Will this be the one to stick the landing? Find out my opinion when my review hits early next week.\n\nKoa and the Five Pirates of Mara ($19.99)\n\nI think this is meant to be the same game universe as Summer in Mara? This one is a 3D platformer that leans more towards the collection end of that genre. Explore the islands of an archipelago that you unlock one at a time. Plenty of goodies to grab, secrets to search, and baddies to bash. We’re not exactly starving for 3D platformers these days, but we don’t see a flood of them releasing either. So far the reviews seem to be leaning towards it being okay but not terribly memorable. If that’s enough for your twenty bucks, have at it.\n\nPixelJunk Scrappers Deluxe ($24.99)\n\nNot a bad day to be a beat-em-up fan, I’ll say. Here’s a PixelJunk take on the idea, where you’re collecting garbage, trashing robot rivals, and collecting their junk too. You get twenty-five stages set across five different environments. You can even customize your garbage truck! Now that’s a box-worthy feature. Up to four players can join in on this one, either via local or online multiplayer. I’ll have a review of it as soon as I can put more time into it, but so far I would say it is definitely consistent with the usual bar of quality Q-Games sets.\n\nYggdra Union “We’ll Never Fight Alone\" ($24.99)\n\nThe 2006 Game Boy Advance game makes a comeback via this Switch release, which actually came out a while back in Japan and is only getting localized now. I assume this port is based on the 2008 PlayStation Portable release based on how it looks, but I suppose it could just as easily be based on the mobile port. It’s a rather unique tactical role-playing game, which is par for the course with Sting games of this era. Some like it, some don’t like it. I’m kind of in the middle on the whole affair, but I know a lot of people were hoping to see this get an overseas release on Switch, and they’ll be happy to see this.\n\nSword & Fairy Inn 2 ($19.99)\n\nThis spin-off of the Sword & Fairy series of RPGs sees you running an inn in a fantasy world. Basically, it’s a life simulation game. You’ll have to do some farming, build relationships with townspeople, explore and find new ingredients and materials, and play some minigames here and there. It certainly looks cute, but its reviews on other platforms haven’t exactly been shining. Up to you if you want to take the punt on it or not.\n\nBatsugun Saturn Tribute Boosted ($29.99)\n\nToaplan was a major force in the evolution of shoot-em-up games, but due to changing market conditions it was on its way out only a few years into the 1990s. Its final game was a somewhat tepid follow-up to Snow Bros., but it was this penultimate release that should be remembered as the developer’s final gift. You see, this 1993 game is generally considered to be the first bullet hell shooter. When Toaplan folded in the following year some of the folks who worked on Batsugun ended up co-founding Cave Co., Ltd., makers of titles such as Dodonpachi, ESPGaluda, and Mushihimesama. This particular version of the game is the Saturn port running in the Zebra emulator, thankfully with a bit less lag than earlier releases. The Boosted part of the title refers to some extra features that have been implemented, perhaps inspired by M2’s Gadgets. It’s a really great shooter, and this isn’t a bad way to play it at all. Fans of the genre are likely to get a lot out of it.\n\nPsychic 5: Eternal ($21.99)\n\nEven a fan of weird old games such as myself has some gaps in his knowledge. Psychic 5 was apparently a hit in the arcades in some region or another back in 1987, but I can’t say I have a whole ton of experience with it. This one was developed by NMK, who certainly made its fair share of quirky games in its short time in the business. It’s an arcade platformer with a variety of characters to choose from, each with their own abilities and parameters. Not a terribly long game, as it is an arcade game after all, but there are a lot of interesting things to discover as you replay the game. There are a few new modes in this version to sweeten the pot, but I imagine fans will just be happy to see this back again even if it is a little pricier than, say, an Arcade Archives release.\n\nArcade Archives Growl ($7.99)\n\nOh, now here’s a good one. Growl was originally released back in 1990 by Taito, and it’s one of the publisher’s better entries in the beat-em-up genre that was all the rage at the time. You play as a forest ranger who has had enough of poachers and decides to go hands-on with the problem. Occasionally guns-on, too. These rangers really don’t like poachers.\n\nRadiant Tale ($49.99)\n\nThe latest otome visual novel from Idea Factory and AkSys follows the story of a young woman who is suddenly recruited to be the producer for a failing circus troupe. Now, you’re not going to believe this, but all of the performers are hunky dudes. What are the odds? So begins a story of freeing a prince from a terrible curse, and also smooching some handsome guys. Our pal Mikhail will probably have a review of this one at some point, as he tends to.\n\nZoo Park Story ($12.00)\n\nKairosoft’s latest port from mobile to Switch sees you creating and tending your very own Zoo Park. I actually reviewed this one on mobile and didn’t exactly love it. It just feels like it has a little bit too much going on, and none of it is terribly well-connected. Still, I’m sure fans of Kairosoft’s output will be pleased enough with it. I’ll throw in the usual notice here that you can get this a good bit cheaper on mobile, and it plays just as well there if not better.\n\nEden’s Last Sunrise ($14.99)\n\nIf I had a nickel for every furry-themed Final Fantasy Tactics-inspired tactical RPG released on Switch in the last two weeks, I’d have ten cents. That isn’t a lot, but you have to admit that it’s odd that it happened twice. This one follows the battles that broke out as the end of the world looms. Choose between the surface dwellers, who specialize in magic, or the spacefarers, who rely more on technology. The story has multiple paths depending on your choices, and naturally that means you also get multiple endings. You can even make custom units to fight along with the main cast. Reviews for the Steam version of this game are pretty positive, so if you like the sound of the premise you can probably expect a good time here.\n\nWatch ($5.99)\n\nWell, that title sure is hard to search on the internet. I normally like to check the temperature of new releases around the web, but there’s little hope of finding much on this one. Anyway, it’s a puzzle platformer that plays with perspective. You’ll have to look at things from different angles to find the path forward, and sometimes the solutions are very unconventional. It doesn’t look terribly fancy, but I suppose for six bucks it doesn’t need to be wearing a tailcoat and monocle.\n\nVenice 2089 ($6.99)\n\nSet in a future Venice that is being hit hard by the effects of rising water, Venice 2089 puts you in the boots of a bored teenager who is just rolling around trying to have some fun with their hoverboard and drone in tow. Explore the streets of Venice, meet a wide array of unusual characters, and help people out with whatever they need help with. Or, you know, just bust some tricks on your hoverboard. Your call.\n\nLuna & Monsters Tower Defense -The Deprived Magical Kingdom- ($12.99)\n\nThis appears to be a plain ol’ fantasy-themed tower defense game. Some decent art helps it stand out a little, but only a little. It features sixty-five levels and multiple difficulty settings. That’s about all I’ve got to say about it.\n\nZombie Hunter: D-Day ($8.99)\n\nOh boy, a first-person shooting game where you’re blasting away zombies. Never seen one of these before. Nothing about this looks particularly special, but it’s clear by now that if you combine guns and zombies, money will follow.\n\nHyper Meteor ($7.99)\n\nWell, here’s a first. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first instance of a game that originated on the Playdate console coming to the Switch. It’s a fairly well-regarded one, too. It’s a bit like Asteroids, but instead of shooting the large space rocks you have to ram into them with the nose of your ship. It offers new modes including a multiplayer option and a Caravan mode, a spiffy new soundtrack, and a bunch of color palettes to choose between. Looks like good fun, and on a backlit screen to boot!\n\nDucky’s Delivery Service ($9.99)\n\nThis game had me with the first sentence of its description. You play as a little ducky with a propeller backpack who wants to deliver mail to other ducks. It takes a bit to learn how the flight controls work, and a bit more to master them for better times on each delivery. Oh, and you have to be careful not to damage the packages as well. This game knows exactly what it wants to do and does it well. Thumbs up.\n\nAlien War 2 Dogfight ($7.99)\n\nThat just doesn’t look very good at all, does it. But neither did the first one, and I have to assume it found enough fans because here we are with a follow-up. There are multiple play styles and the game will change between them as you play. Vertical, horizontal, and even a free-roaming Time Pilot-ish mode. Defeating enemies will allow you to upgrade your plane, and that will be necessary to handle some of the tougher foes. Not my cup of tea, but maybe it’s yours.\n\nOperate Now: Hospital ($9.99)\n\nThere’s a lot going on in this one. You have to run a hospital, and that’s kind of sim-like. You perform operations, and you probably know how that works. There are also some visual novel-style story bits. Trauma Center it isn’t, but it’s nice to see something along these lines that isn’t just doing horrifying dentistry on Else from Frozen or something.\n\nPixel Game Maker Series Angel’s Gear ($9.99)\n\nFinally, we round today’s releases out with this Metroidvania-style game built using the Pixel Game Maker software. The gimmick here is that you can shift between angel and devil modes, with each having their own abilities to make use of. You’ll also make use of melee and ranged attacks as you make your way through this horror-tinged world. Personally, I’m pretty full up on this genre unless it’s something outstanding, and while this is fine it doesn’t really ring my bell much. Those who are still hungry for more exploratory platforming might find it goes down better.\n\nSales\n\n(North American eShop, US Prices)\n\nThe inbox features a handful of KEMCO’s games at new low prices, plus a number of other goodies like Melty Blood Type Lumina and Figment 1 + Figment 2. Nothing in the outbox is really jumping out at me, but it is certainly substantial in size.
