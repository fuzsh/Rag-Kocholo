        "text": "Introduction\n\nThis article lists some of the highest-selling Nintendo NES recently sold at auction. These are primarily factory-sealed games in their original packaging and graded by third-party grading companies such as WATA Games and CGA. If you have a factory-sealed Nintendo NES game, consider submitting it to a third-party company for authentication and grading.\n\nFor the most part, factory-sealed Nintendo NES games are not rare; however, early productions and high-grade examples are. This list includes just that. So, without any further ado, let’s jump into the list!\n\n1988 Nintendo NES\n\nCastlevania\n\nVGA 85 NM+ sold for $26,000\n\nCastlevania is an action-platform game featuring the debut of Simon Belmont and is the first installment in the series.

According to WATA’s census report, only two other copies with a “REV-A, Round SOQ” have achieved a higher grade. Goldin Auctions sold this example at auction in February 2022 for $37,000.\n\n1986 Nintendo NES\n\nDonkey Kong (early production)\n\nWATA 9.6/A++ sold for $46,000\n\nThis Donkey Kong example contains a Hangtab, an NES P DK code, and a round Nintendo Seal of Quality, indicating that this is an early production copy that Nintendo produced in early 1987.

There are few games as iconic as the original The Legend of Zelda, released for Nintendo in 1986. Iconic Nintendo game designer Shigeru Miyamoto designed the game.\n\nThe sealed copy features a round Nintendo Seal of Quality with a Small Warranty, a 5-Digit ZIP, and an NES TM label, indicating that this copy is the first edition.

If the box is factory-sealed and shows no significant damage, it is worth more than an open game. Moreover, if the box is sealed but shows damage, the value will not be as high.\n\nAnother factor is how early the game was in production. Early production games with specific print differences, such as 5-digit-zip, NES TM labels, Nintendo Seal of Quality, orange lists, and more, will yield higher selling prices. There are numerous listings of factory-sealed Nintendo NES games on eBay that are in mint condition or better. If you have any factory-sealed Nintendo NES games, consider submitting them to a third-party grading company for authentication and grading. Two of the most trustworthy companies are WATA Games and CGA grading."
