        "text": "HBO’s Game of Thrones saw the return of dragons to Westeros after an almost two-century absence. Its prequel series House of the Dragon, based on George R.R. Martin’s history of the rise and fall of the Targaryen dynasty titled Fire & Blood, takes place back when dragons dominated the skies of Westeros, until a civil war pushed them to the brink of extinction.\n\nThe war known as the Dance of the Dragons begins with a dragon-related tragedy in the Season 1 finale of House of the Dragon. Season 2 of House of the Dragon depicts an increasingly bloody campaign for succession between the Blacks and the Greens to possess the Iron Throne – a civil war that has proven tragic for all involved, human and dragon alike.\n\nHere are all the dragons that have appeared so far during House of the Dragon, and some that we’re likely to see in the future.\n\nLet’s begin with the most notorious Targaryen dragon of them all…\n\nBalerion the Black Dread (Previous Riders: Aegon The Conquer and Visery Targaryen)\n\nWe’ve never seen the infamous ‘Black Dread’ take to the skies in either Game of Thrones or House of the Dragon, with the giant beast already succumbing to old age before the start of the prequel series. However, we do get to see his enormous skull within the Red Keep when Viserys shares the Song of Ice and Fire prophecy with his daughter and heir, Rhaenyra Targaryen. The largest and eldest of all the Targaryen dragons covered in the show, Balerion was flown by Aegon the Conqueror and was a vital weapon during his conquest of Westeros. After Aegon I’s death, Balerion was mounted by Maegor the Cruel and Princess Aerea, before finally becoming the steed of King Viserys I before his death.\n\nVhagar (Current Rider: Aemond Targaryen)\n\nThe second largest dragon of the Targaryens, Vhagar is a grizzly female dragon and the eldest. Vhagar was flown during Aegon’s conquest when she served as the steed for Aegon’s Sister/Wife, Queen Visenya Targaryen. Together, they burned the Arryn fleet in the waters off Gulltown. During House of the Dragon Vhagar was ridden by Lady Laena Velaryon and then immediately by Aemond Targaryen upon Laena’s death. Since then Vhagar and her rider Aemond have become the deadliest weapon in all of Westeros, with the giant beast and fiercest warrior pairing becoming the biggest threat to the Blacks and Rhaenyra’s claim.\n\nAemond and Vhagar were responsible for the death of Prince Lucerys Velaryon and his dragon Arrax at the end of season one of House of the Dragon, and have continued their bloody path in season two by defeating Princess Rhaenys and her dragon Meleys at the battle of Rook’s Rest.\n\nSyrax (Current Rider: Rhaenyra Targaryen)\n\nThe yellowish Syrax is the huge and formidable female steed of Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen and has regularly been seen throughout the first and second seasons of House of the Dragon. We were first introduced to Syrax in the very first episode of House of the Dragon, as Rhaenyra took flight around the skies of Kings Landing. Syrax was more recently seen mourning the death of Rhaenyra’s son Lucerys in the first episode of Season 2, and standing guard with Rhaenyra in episode 7 of Season 2.\n\nCaraxes (Current Rider: Daemon Targaryen)\n\nDubbed the Blood Wyrm, this huge, red, horned beast is the steed of Prince Daemon Targaryen (Matt Smith) and is as fearsome and vicious as his rider. House of the Dragon Season 2 first introduced us to the power of Caraxes during Daemon’s war against the Crabfeeder in the Stepstones. Originally the steed of Aemon Targaryen (late son of King Jaehaerys), Daemon is only the second person to tame Caraxes. By mid-Season 2, they had taken flight from Dragonstone to Harrenhal and Caraxes was most recently seen perched on the ruins of Harrenhal while Daemon declared his army for Rhaenyra in Season 2's finale.\n\nSunfyre (Current Rider: Aegon Targaryen)\n\nWith his golden scales and flame, it’s no wonder this huge and formidable male dragon is dubbed “Sunfyre the Golden.” He is the steed of King Aegon II Targaryen (played by Tom Glynn-Carney), who is the first dragon rider to tame this relatively young beast. Sunfyre is often referred to as the most beautiful of dragons and its golden look was the inspiration of Aegon’s golden sigil.\n\nEpisode 4 of House of the Dragon Season 2 showed us Sunfyre in action for the first time, tangling with Rhaenys’ Meleys and getting caught in the crossfire from Aemond’s Vhagar, resulting in a severely wounded, but still barely alive Sunfyre dropping from the sky. As far as we know Sunfyre is still alive, but very much not operational\n\nVermithor (Current Rider: Hugh Hammer )\n\n“The Bronze Fury,” the third largest dragon, is described in The World of Ice & Fire (the companion book to Ice & Fire) as “old and hoary.” This male dragon was once the steed of Jaehaerys I Targaryen, aka the Old King, and maintained that bond for Jaehaerys’ 55-year reign. Daemon Targaryen is seen visiting it during the Season 1 finale of House of the Dragon at which point Vermithor remained riderless, waiting for someone bold enough to claim him.\n\nThat bold man stepped forward in the shape of Hugh, a Targaryen bastard from the slums of King's Landing who attended Rhaenyra's Red Sowing - a gathering of illegitimate Targaryen child looking to claim a dragon. Hugh bravely stepped forward to protect another woman and thus presented himself to Vermithor, creating a bond in the process. Vermithor was last seen behind Rhaenyra guarding Dragonstone in episode 7 of Season 2.\n\nSilverwing (Current Rider: Ulf )\n\nOnce rode by Queen Alysanne Targaryen, (the lifelong wife/sister of King Jaehaerys) this she-dragon, like Vermithor, was riderless until the Red Sowing where Ulf, one of the small folk of King's Landing and self-proclaimed illegitimate son of Baelon the Brave accidently stumbled into her lair.\n\nFortunately for Ulf, Sliverwing took to this unlucky Targaryen bastard and immediately forged a bond, allowing Ulf to take to the skies above King's Landing in episode 7 of Season 2.\n\nMeleys (Previous Rider: Rhaenys Targaryen)\n\n“The Red Queen” is the steed of The Queen Who Never Was, Princess Rhaenys Targaryen (played in House of the Dragon by Eve Best). Meleys is described in The World of Ice & Fire as “old and cunning, lazy, but fearsome when roused.” Rhaenys and Meleys made quite a splash in the penultimate episode of House of the Dragon's first season when they burst through the dragon pit during the coronation of King Aegon II.\n\nIn Episode 4 of Season 2, Meleys took on Vhagar and Sunfyre in the battle of Rook’s Rest. Meleys and her rider Rhaenys were eventually defeated by Vhagar, falling to their death after significant wounds. In Episode 5 of Season 2, we see the decapitated head of Meleys paraded around King’s Landing and referred to as a “traitor dragon”.\n\nMoondancer (Current Rider: Baela Targaryen)\n\nDubbed by The World of Ice & Fire as a “slender and beautiful” female dragon, Moondancer is the small but swift steed of Lady Baela Targaryen, the daughter of Daemon Targaryen and Laena Velaryon. Moondancer is significantly smaller than some of the other dragons, making her fast and nimble.\n\nWe see Baela riding Moondancer in Episode 3 of Season 2, chasing Criston Cole and his men into the tree line after patrolling the area.\n\nSeasmoke (Current Rider: Addam of Hull)\n\nThis grey and white dragon is still relatively young in the era of House of the Dragon, during which it bonds with Ser Laenor Velaryon . Seasmoke appears during the climactic battle against the Crabfeeder in Season 1, Episode 3.\n\nSince the apparent death of Laenor, Seasmoke has remained riderless. Though in House of the Dragon it’s clear that Laenor’s death was faked and he’s apparently still alive somewhere in Essos, it’s yet to be determined whether Seasmoke will still maintain this bond with his original owner.\n\nIn episode 6 of season 2, Ser Steffon Darklyn attempts to claim Seasmoke but is extremely unsuccessful. Seasmoke then decided to seek out his own rider, cornering baseborn Addam of Hull. Addam is a dragonseed and bastard son of Corlys Velaryon, who was also the father of his original rider, Laenor.\n\nWe last saw Seasmoke cornering taking to the skies with Rhaenyra when she visited Daemon at Harrenhal in Season 2's finale.\n\nDreamfyre (Current Rider: Helaena Targaryen)\n\nThis silver and blue she-dragon has been the steed of both Princess Rhaena Targaryen (daughter of Aenys I) and Queen Helaena Targaryen. Dreamfyre is rarely ridden by Helaena, who prefers to spend her time being a mother to her children. The dragon was briefly seen in House of the Dragon Season 1 taking care of her own offspring, guarding dragon eggs when a young Aemond attempts to claim one.\n\nIn Season 2 Aemond did request Helaena to fly the dragon again, but Helaena refused, stating she \"didn't want to burn people\".\n\nTessarion (Current Rider: Daeron Targaryen)\n\n“The Blue Queen” is the steed of Prince Daeron Targaryen, a character we’ve yet to meet but who was mentioned twice in Season 2 of House of the Dragon. The younger brother of King Aegon, Daeron currently lives in Old Town with his extended family on his mother Alicent Hightower’s side.\n\nThis she-dragon, who breathes blue flame, is said to be younger than Dreamfyre, Sunfyre, and Vhagar, and we managed to catch fleeting glimpse of the blue beast in the Season 2 finale.\n\nStormcloud (No Current Rider)\n\nThis young male dragon is too young to factor into House of the Dragon until later in the series, during which time it will be the steed of Aegon the Younger, the toddler son of Rhaenyra and Daemon Targaryen.\n\nAs it stands though, Stormcloud is with Rhaena and Rhaenyra’s protected children in the Eyrie, and paired with Tyraxes, is part of the promise to Lady Jeyne Arryn to send dragons to protect the Vale. We did briefly catch a glimpse of a very young dragon in episode 6 of season 2, spending time bonding with the young Targaryen children.\n\nVermax (Current Rider: Jacaerys Velaryon)\n\nThe young male dragon Vermax is the steed of Prince Jacaerys Velaryon (the son of Rhaenyra Targaryen and Laenor Velaryon - although it’s clear that he’s actually the bastard child of Harwin Strong). The green dragon briefly appears during Season 1, flying Jacaerys to the Eyrie and then Winterfell to earn the support of houses for Queen Rhaenyra’s cause.\n\nVermax was most recently seen at The Twins after being ridden there by Jacaerys so he could negotiate with The Freys for his Mother, Rhaenyra.\n\nArrax (Previous Rider: Lucerys Velaryon)\n\nSaid to be five times smaller than Vhagar, this young male dragon is the steed of Prince Lucerys Velaryon. Like his older brother, Jacaerys, Lucerys is the disputed son of Rhaenyra Targaryen and Laenor Velaryon). Arrax and Lucerys play a pivotal role in the Season 1 finale of House of the Dragon, as Luke, as he’s called, clashes with his Uncle and childhood rival, Aemond Targaryen. Aemond, while riding Vhagar, kills not only Arrax, but Lucerys as well.\n\nTyraxes (Current Rider: Joffrey Velaryon)\n\nThe steed of dragonrider Prince Joffrey Velaryon (the third child by Rhaenyra and Laenor - again disputed) is Tyraxes. In House of the Dragon Season 2, Tyraxes is used as a bargaining tool for earning the allegiance of House Arryn, who requested a dragon to protect the Eyrie.\n\nMorghul (No Current Rider)\n\nIn Fire & Blood, this young dragon is bound to Princess Jaehaera Targaryen, daughter of King Aegon II and survivor of the Blood and Cheese incident. Due to Jaehaera’s age in the show though, it is implied that Morghul is still yet to be born and currently rests in their egg underneath Jaehaera’s bed.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nShrykos (No Current Rider)\n\nLike Morghul, Shrykos is also yet to hatch. The dragon would’ve belonged to Jaehaera’s twin brother, Jaehaerys. However, the Blood and Cheese incident left the boy without a head, so it’s unlikely we’ll ever see Shrykos in the show.\n\nMorning (No Current Rider)\n\nThe she-dragon Morning, the offspring of Syrax, is hatched later in Fire & Blood. Morning has pink scales and black horns and is the steed of Lady Rhaena Targaryen, who is currently dragon-less in the show. Morning is suspected to be one of the four eggs Rhaena and the Targaryen children took to The Vale for protection.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nSheepstealer (No Current Rider)\n\nThis is an older, wild dragon that’s yet to be claimed, and like the name implies, is regularly seen happily feasting on woolly creatures in the pastures.\n\nIn episode 6 of season 2 Raena Targaryen (along with Joffrey) stumbles upon burn marks left by a large dragon. When she questions Lady Jeyne Arryn she reveals there's a larger, wild dragon in The Vale. In the finale of Season 2 Rhaena, after making a break for it for the guards of The Vale manages to find and come face-to-face Sheepstealer. Whether she'll claim the beast though is yet to be seen.\n\nIn Fire & Blood, Sheepstealer is a “brown and plain” wild dragon that’s eventually tamed by, as The World of Ice & Fire describes her, a “plain, baseborn and disreputable girl” named Nettles, who feeds the dragon mutton to win it over. Nettles has yet to be introduced in House of the Dragon.\n\nThe Cannibal (No Current Rider)\n\nAnother beast yet to be introduced in House of the Dragon, this wild dragon is known in Fire & Blood for never having been ridden, let alone tamed – and for eating other dragons, hence his name. Legend has it that it’s lurked on Dragonstone since before the arrival of the Targaryens.\n\nThe Grey Ghost (No Current Rider)\n\nLike The Cannibal, this is another wild dragon who was never tamed or ridden and has to appear in House of the Dragon. It is said to have feasted on fish rather than people."
