Not only is it the biggest video game franchise, but it’s also the highest-grossing media franchise in general. It should be pointed out, however, that only a small portion of their revenue has been from video games; the franchise makes far more from merchandising. It’s made $3.36 billion on mobile game sales and $13.78 billion from console and hand-held game sales.\n\nThe Top 10 Best-Selling Video Game Franchises of All Time\n\nPokémon — $90 billion\n\nThe highest-grossing video game franchise may have earned most of its money from merchandising, but Pokémon Red/Green/Blue/Yellow still ranks seventh among the top-selling video games of all time, topping out at 47,520,000 copies.\n\nMario — $30.25 billion\n\nArguably the most recognizable video game character in the world, Mario has made Nintendo a lot of money over the years, with the Super Mario series alone bringing in nearly $15.9 billion. Since his inception in 1981, this character has hopped all over the world in many formats.\n\nCall of Duty — $17 billion\n\nThis franchise’s Black Ops 4 title alone brought in $1 billion in sales, with its WWII title doing the same in 2017. It’s widely considered in the industry to be a blockbuster, and it only seems to gain more traction over time.\n\nWii — $14.808 billion\n\nYes, it’s true that the Wii is a console, but it’s also its own branch of video games, with series like Wii Sports, Wii Play, and Wii Fit grabbing a novice gamer audience in a family-focused environment.\n\nPac-Man — $14.107 billion\n\nThe arcade game that was an absolute blast in the 1980s is still kicking, with many throwback titles and new puzzle games still promoting the world’s favorite pellet-muncher.\n\nSpace Invaders — $13.93 billion\n\nThis is the oldest game on our top ten list. Originating in 1978, Space Invaders is a classic game that’s still popular every time it’s re-released. Gamers, it seems, are almost always on call to stop a new invasion, but some invaders have managed to infiltrate the real world!\n\nDungeon Fighter Online — $11.8 billion\n\nThe next on our list of top video game franchises may be one most non-gamer Americans have not heard of, since “DFO” is a hugely popular South Korean multi-player “beat-’em-up” game. Nevertheless, it has about 600 million players worldwide.\n\nStreet Fighter — $11.279 billion\n\nOne of the biggest game franchises that’s famous for its movies, games, and crossovers, Street Fighter is arguably the most popular fighting-style video game of all time, beating out its popular competitor Mortal Kombat by nearly $10 billion.\n\nFinal Fantasy — $10.656 billion\n\nAn absolute titan of the gaming world, this is arguably the top role-playing game among the best-selling franchises. This critically acclaimed series has created a legacy and set a standard that all other RPGs strive for.\n\nWarcraft — $10.627 billion\n\nFor Americans, this is the big name in MMORPGs among the biggest video game franchises, with famous titles like Hearthstone, Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, and, of course, the famous World of Warcraft (aka WoW). Gamers have been adventuring in Azeroth since 2004.\n\nCheck out some of the other most profitable video game franchises in history, too: How many of your favorites made the top 50?\n\nContents"
