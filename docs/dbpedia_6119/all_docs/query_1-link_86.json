        "text": "Capcom's devilish hero Firebrand first appeared as an annoying, antagonizing enemy character in Ghosts 'N Goblins. After that memorable supporting role, someone at Capcom saw something more for the flying demon and decided to give him his own series – including Gargoyle's Quest on the Game Boy, Gargoyle's Quest II on the NES and this game, their 16-bit sequel Demon's Crest. This one, unfortunately, didn't do that well. Not because it was a bad game – we wouldn't be honoring it if it were. But because, for whatever reason, it bombed in sales. Maybe parents took offense to the creepy demonic art on its box? Maybe the game was too tough for players to handle? Who knows why, but Demon's Crest somehow managed to earn an interesting distinction among the entire SNES library – it became the only Super Nintendo title in history to actual register negative sales at one point. That means, in the course of one week, there were more people who returned the game to get their money back than there were others who actually purchased and kept it. Ouch."
