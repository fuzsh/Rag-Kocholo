        "text": "I'm Jon-Paul Dyson, director of\n\nthe International Center for the History\n\nof Electronic Games at The Strong Museum.\n\nAnd I'm Shannon Simons, curator for Electronic Games\n\nat the Strong Museum.\n\nAnd this is every iconic video game for the last 40 years.\n\n[rock music]\n\n[Shannon] When deciding which game to pick each year,\n\nwe looked at a variety of factors.\n\nThe game had to be iconic.\n\nPeople had to recognize it.\n\nIt had wide geographic reach\n\nand was played all across the world.\n\nIt had cultural significance\n\nwith a lot of people even outside the gaming industry.\n\n1979, Asteroids.\n\nIn the 1970s Atari ruled the arcade scene,\n\nbut in the late 1970s competition came from Japan\n\nin the form of Space Invaders.\n\nAtari needed a followup.\n\nAsteroids was the answer.\n\nThis rock blasting game featuring\n\nasteroids hurdling through space\n\ninspired by the original Space War game\n\nfrom the early 1960s,\n\nbut it proved to be a gold mine for Atari,\n\nraking in the quarters, both in the arcade,\n\nand eventually when ported to home console.\n\nAsteroids combined this amazing fluidity of movement\n\nwith excitement.\n\nThe sound ramped up, the action ramped up,\n\nthe asteroids came faster and faster.\n\nIt generated coins by the bucketful\n\nand really made a lot of money for Atari\n\nand brought internal fame\n\nto Ed Logg and Lyle Rains the developers.\n\n1980, Pac-Man, when creator Toru Iwatani\n\nwas eating a pizza and removed a slice\n\nhe got this image of this yellow ball\n\ngoing across the screen eating pellets,\n\nand he thought that that would be something\n\nthat would appeal widely across genders, across ages.\n\nNot only did Pac-Man do well in the arcade,\n\nbut it became the first game\n\nto incite this licensing craze.\n\nPac-Man's fun for everyone.\n\nAll you have to do is go around a maze.\n\nAnd it also had these wonderful ghosts.\n\nIn 1982 Ms. Pac-Man became one of the first\n\niconic female video game characters.\n\n1981 Donkey Kong.\n\nDonkey Kong introduced to video games\n\ntwo of its most important characters.\n\nThe first was the games creator, Shigeru Miyamoto\n\nwho saved Nintendo when they were desperately\n\nlooking for a game to replace their failed Radar Scope.\n\nIt was a delightful game featuring\n\na character called Jump Man,\n\nwho saved this damsel in distress\n\nfrom the clutches of an evil gorilla.\n\nThe second character was, of course, Jump Man,\n\nwho we know as Mario.\n\nWithout Donkey Kong there may be no Mario\n\nand video games would be very different than they are today.\n\n1982, E.T. The Extra Terrestrial.\n\nE.T. is an example of a video game\n\nthat's remembered for all the wrong reasons.\n\nIt's considered one of the biggest commercial failures\n\nof the entire video game industry.\n\nIt only took five and a half weeks to develop\n\ndue to licensing rights and trying to get\n\nthe game out for the holiday season.\n\n[video game noises]\n\nThe game just didn't play well.\n\nLegend had it that after the game's failure\n\nAtari buried thousands upon thousands of these cartridges\n\nin a landfill in the New Mexico desert\n\nthat turned out to be true during a 2014 excavation\n\nwhen all of these cartridges were dug up.\n\nE.T. is often credited as a great example\n\nof why the video game industry crashed in 1983.\n\nA lotta games were being produced\n\nand the console market was glutted with games\n\nthat just weren't selling.\n\nThe PC industry was also taking off at the time.\n\nBut when people talk about the crash,\n\nthey always talk about E.T.\n\n1983, M.U.L.E.\n\nWhen people think of video games\n\nthey usually think of the games, not the creators.\n\nBut when Trip Hawkins founded Electronic Arts in 1982\n\nhe wanted to change that.\n\nHe wanted to bring the developers to the floor.\n\nAnd so he got some of the best developers\n\nin the business to create games.\n\nOne of those creators was Dan Bunten,\n\nwho later became Danielle Bunten Berry.\n\nBunten used to say that no one ever died\n\nwishing they'd spent more time in front of a computer screen\n\nand wanted to bring that spirit\n\nof a board game to a computer game.\n\nM.U.L.E. did this successfully.\n\nIt's a game designer's game,\n\nand one that is still influential today,\n\nshaping how we think of multiplayer games\n\nfor a mass audience.\n\n1984, King's Quest.\n\nThe game development company, Sierra Online,\n\nbecame synonymous with graphical adventures,\n\nmainly because of the success of the game King's Quest,\n\ndeveloped and created by co-founder Roberta Williams,\n\nwho became one of the most\n\niconic female video game designers.\n\nKing's Quest combined the best of early text adventure games\n\nwith pioneering graphics\n\nfor IBM's latest computer, The PC Junior.\n\nKing's Quest allowed players a freedom of movement\n\nthat they hadn't experienced before,\n\nincluding being able to move in front of\n\nand behind objects on the screen.\n\nIt's a game that appealed to everyone,\n\nboth women and men alike, and people who perhaps\n\nweren't even generally fans of computer games at the time.\n\nAlthough the PC Junior itself\n\nproved to be a commercial failure,\n\nKing's Quest found new life when it was ported\n\nto other computer systems such as the Commodore 64\n\nand the Apple II line.\n\n1985, Super Mario Bros.\n\nMario first appeared in Donkey Kong as Jump Man.\n\nIt wasn't until 1895 when he first appeared\n\nin his breakout series [foreign language].\n\nMario's gameplay became so popular\n\nbecause it was so simple.\n\nYou scrolled in one direction,\n\njumping over enemies like Koopa Troopas,\n\nand Goombas and try to avoid falling in pits,\n\nwhich made it easy to play for everyone,\n\nno matter what level you were.\n\nHe has appeared in over 200 games\n\non every single Nintendo console ever created.\n\nAnd in the survey in the 1990s more children\n\nrecognized Mario even than Mickey Mouse.\n\n1986, The Legend of Zelda.\n\nIf you first played Zelda\n\non the Nintendo Entertainment System,\n\nyou might be confused as to why we're introducing this\n\nin 1986 instead of 1987.\n\nBut it actually premiered on the Japanese only\n\nNintendo Famicom Disk System as a flagship game.\n\nIt was initially thought of by Shigeru Miyamoto,\n\nthe creator of Mario and Donkey Kong,\n\nas a counterpoint.\n\nSomething that was a little bit more complex.\n\nIt pioneered this open world feel.\n\nThis miniature garden where players would explore\n\nthe entire land of Hyrule openly,\n\nwithout having a discrete path to follow.\n\nIt gave rise to some of the most\n\niconic lines in video game history.\n\nIt's dangerous to go along, take this.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda is still popular today,\n\neven with some of the more recent iterations\n\nsuch as Breath of the Wild and Ocarina of Time.\n\n[video game music]\n\n1987, Tecmo Bowl.\n\nEvery year sports games dominate the bestsellers lists.\n\nGames like John Madden Football are purchased\n\nby millions of players every year.\n\nBut early on, football games were\n\nlargely absent from the video game scene.\n\nThere have been games like Atari's arcade game Football.\n\nBut it was a pretty boring abstract game of x's and o's.\n\nTecmo Bowl brought to video games live action,\n\ntwo screens, four players.\n\nIt was a real hit in the arcade,\n\nand also when it was ported to the home console at home.\n\nTecmo Bowl had bright simple colors,\n\nbut most of all it was the action\n\nthat took foremost in the game,\n\nand that's what made it really exciting.\n\nWhile the teams in Tecmo Bowl\n\nwere not real, the players were.\n\nA licensing deal with the NFL Players Association\n\nbrought real named players to the game\n\nthat brought an extra level of excitement.\n\n[video game music]\n\n1988, Wasteland.\n\nRole playing games had been around since the 1970s.\n\nFirst in pen and paper form\n\nand then in computer games.\n\nBut mostly they're fantasy games,\n\nthings taking places in dungeons with spells and wizards.\n\nWasteland was different.\n\nNot set in a fantasy world,\n\nbut a post-apocalyptic landscape,\n\nbut one that was filled not only with a little horror,\n\nbut also a lotta humor as well.\n\n1989, Tetris.\n\nTetris was originally created by a Soviet designer,\n\nAlexey Pajitnov, in 1984 on an Electronica 60 mini computer.\n\nBut it wasn't until its release in 1989\n\non Nintendo's Game Boy handheld\n\nthat it achieved real worldwide success.\n\nThe title's a combination of the Greek word\n\ntetra for four and tennis.\n\nIt also has its origins in the game Pentominoes,\n\nwhere players take puzzle pieces\n\nand fit them together in a box-like puzzle.\n\nTetris became famous as a game that was easy to play\n\nbut difficult to master.\n\nTetris is still probably the most\n\npopular puzzle game on the market.\n\nIt's something that people can enjoy\n\nnot only on their computers\n\nbut also on mobile handheld devices.\n\nIt's a game you can play really quickly\n\nwhile you're waiting for the bus.\n\n1990, Microsoft Windows Solitaire.\n\nWhen we think of computer games\n\nwe don't usually think of card games.\n\nBut perhaps the most popular computer game of all time\n\nwas a card game, Microsoft Solitaire,\n\nintroduced with Windows 3.0 operating system.\n\nThe game was crucial, not only in ensuring\n\nthat people wasted millions of hours of time\n\nplaying this addicting game,\n\nbut also teaches them how to use a mouse,\n\na device that was completely new to many people,\n\nand so they could learn how to click, drag,\n\ndo other things with this device by playing a game.\n\nI totally don't play that while I'm at work, do you?\n\nNo, not at all. No.\n\nNo, never have, never have.\n\n[laughing]\n\n1991, Sonic the Hedgehog.\n\nIn the early 1990s Sega and Nintendo\n\nwere locked in a battle for the hearts and minds\n\nof their console fan base.\n\nSega wanted to paint Nintendo as a console for children.\n\nThey decided to have an in-house design contest\n\nto create a brand new character.\n\nThey came up with the idea of this blue hedgehog\n\ncode named Mr. Needlemouse\n\nwho became Sonic the Hedgehog.\n\nWith Sonic the Hedgehog they intended to appeal\n\nto an older audience with someone who was more hip,\n\ncool, resonated with Gen X.\n\nThen with the advent of the Sega Genesis\n\nand especially with Sonic the Hedgehog in 1991,\n\nSega vaulted forward and just absolutely dominated\n\nthe 16-bit console market.\n\n1992, Mortal Kombat.\n\nFinish him.\n\n[voice game sounds and screaming]\n\nNever before has there been a game\n\nthat's created so much excitement,\n\nor maybe I should say controversy.\n\nMortal Kombat was a fighting game\n\nwith over-the-top graphic violence\n\nthat today looks tame, but back then, outraged people.\n\nSome of those people were U.S. senators.\n\nThe result was not only a wildly popular game,\n\nbut senate hearings that led to the development\n\nof the ESRB, the rating code\n\nthat continues to govern video games today.\n\nMortal Kombat's violence was not so much disturbing\n\nto some people because it was realistic.\n\nRipping the spine out of our opponent\n\nis not necessarily realistic.\n\nBut it was because it was so gratuitous\n\nand also because [voice muffled]\n\nit was marketed to children.\n\nWho a game is marketed to is sometimes important\n\nin determining how people react to it\n\nas to what it actually contains.\n\nMortal Kombat helped not only boost the fighting game scene,\n\nbut also created an interest in games\n\nthat really were spectacles at the arcade.\n\nGames like Street Fighter Two would be ones\n\nin which players competed to see who was the best.\n\nMortal Kombat has an important legacy\n\nnot only for its sociopolitical effects,\n\nbut also just for its effects in the game world itself.\n\n1993, Doom.\n\nAnyone who played Doom when it first came out\n\nwill never forget the experience.\n\nThis was just mesmerizing, adrenaline boosting,\n\nsheer joy of blasting away these enemies coming at you.\n\nIts first person perspective was revolutionary,\n\nand as revolutionary was the way that it was distributed.\n\nThe digital shareware.\n\nYou could download the first chapter,\n\nplay it, and get hooked.\n\nJohn Carmack and John Romero were the geniuses\n\nwho set this ammo-blasting, adrenaline-fueled,\n\naction-packed adventure set to heavy metal music\n\nthat really just turned the video game industry upside down.\n\nDoom popularized the first person shooter,\n\nshowing how compelling it could be\n\nto look down the barrel of your gun\n\nat enemies swarming at you.\n\nIt was a game that was impossible to turn away from\n\nand you just had to keep playing as long as you survived.\n\n1994, Super Metroid.\n\nSuper Metroid is widely considered the best game\n\nin the entire Metroid franchise.\n\nAs bounty hunter Samus, you're on this isolated spaceship,\n\ngoing through, trying to capture pirates.\n\nPlayers of the original Metroid probably remember\n\nthat they reveal at the end Samus was a girl.\n\nSamus wasn't the first female protagonist in a video game.\n\nBut she certainly did become the most popular,\n\nespecially of the era.\n\nAnd was the first to really be seen\n\nas a non-sexualized character.\n\nWhen she's in her armor you really don't care\n\nwhether she's male or female, she's just awesome.\n\nSuper Metroid was one of the first games\n\nto have multiple endings.\n\nThree in this particular case.\n\nAnd it became very popular in speed running communities,\n\nas they raced to beat the clock\n\nto get the best ending possible.\n\n1995, Command and Conquer.\n\nCommand and Conquer wasn't the first\n\nreal time strategy game from Westwood,\n\nbut it was a game that brought together\n\nin a perfect combination all the elements of skill,\n\nstrategy, and speed to make for a good\n\nreal time strategy game today.\n\nCommand and Conquer really showed other manufacturers\n\nthat RTSs, real time strategy games,\n\nhad an audience who just craved the excitement\n\nof trying to defeat your opponent\n\nwhile so many things are happening all around you.\n\n1996, Tomb Raider.\n\n1996 was actually a really big year for video games,\n\nwith releases of epics like Diablo and Resident Evil.\n\n[Woman] Look out, it's a monster.\n\nLet me take care of this.\n\n[gunshots blasting]\n\nBut we picked Tomb Raider for one huge reason.\n\nAnd her name was Lara Croft.\n\nLara was this no-nonsense Indiana Jones-esque character.\n\nShe was doing everything\n\nthat the traditional action hero did\n\nexcept that she was doing it in hot pants.\n\nAs awesome as Lara was, she can sometimes\n\nbe seen as a sex symbol as well.\n\nTomb Raider really set the standard for 3D video games\n\nwith the ability for characters to move in every direction,\n\nto jump, climb, swing, and in this particular case,\n\nfind some pretty cool treasure.\n\n1997, Final Fantasy VII.\n\nWhen Hironobu Sakaguchi released the original Final Fantasy,\n\nit wasn't the first role playing game,\n\nbut it was really the first to take it to that next level,\n\nbut in 1997 when Square published the seventh iteration\n\nof their Final Fantasy genre\n\nit really, really broke the mold.\n\nPrior to this role playing games\n\nwere mostly super popular in Japan.\n\nFinal Fantasy VII exploded the role playing genre\n\nin America and Europe.\n\nThe game allowed you to explore lots of different areas,\n\nand as one of these original four heroes of light,\n\nas you tried to go out and save the world from destruction,\n\nyou were able to explore different areas,\n\nfind treasure, and level up all of your weapons and gear.\n\nIf you started out as a fighter\n\nyou definitely had a cooler sword by the end.\n\nWith characters like Cloud Strife,\n\nthe devilishly handsome Sephiroth, and Aerith,\n\nwhose death unfortunately remains\n\none of the most tear-inducing moments in video game history.\n\n[sad music]\n\n1998, Pokemon Red and Blue.\n\n1998 was a big year for Nintendo.\n\nThey released what's considered sometimes\n\nthe most popular game of all time,\n\nThe Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.\n\n[video game sounds]\n\nBut in this case we're gonna talk about a different game.\n\nA smaller one that changed the way portable play worked.\n\nYou might be a little confused as to why we're introducing\n\nPokemon in 1998 when it actually came out in Japan in 1996.\n\nThat was released as Pokemon [foreign language],\n\nRed and Green.\n\nThe original Red and Green was only released in Japan.\n\nAnd when it came over here\n\nthey decided to shorten it to Pokemon\n\nfrom the original title Pocket Monsters,\n\nbecause it needed to fit on the small Game Boy screen\n\nand it was just easier to read.\n\nThere was also a licensing issue,\n\nbecause there was a Pocket Monsters game already over here.\n\nCreator Satoshi Tajiri was\n\nthis huge bug collector when he was a child.\n\nAnd he decided that he really wanted to give\n\nchildren in Japanese cities the opportunity\n\nto do their own bug collecting.\n\nHe had this vision of insects crawling along\n\nthe game link cable that connected two Game Boys together.\n\nAnd thus, Pokemon was born.\n\nPokemon is still considered one of\n\nthe most popular RPGs of all time.\n\nAnd its legacy can still be seen\n\nin the 2016 augmented reality game, Pokemon Go\n\nas people walk around with their smartphones\n\nand collect Pokemon right in their backyard.\n\nPokemon also created an entire transmedia franchise\n\nthat included one of the most popular\n\ntrading card games of all time as well as anime series,\n\nmovies, board games,\n\npretty much everything you can think of,\n\nyou can catch 'em all.\n\n1999, Shenmue.\n\nTo the non-gamer, Shenmue sounds like maybe a killer whale.\n\nBut in reality it's one of the most exciting\n\nopen world games ever created, a real pioneer,\n\nwhich players were lost in a world\n\nwhere they could do all sorts of things,\n\nfrom battling enemies to racing forklifts.\n\nShenmue liberated players to explore in ways\n\nthat they hadn't really explored before.\n\nIt's designer, Yu Suzuki, was a brilliant designer\n\nwho knew how to make worlds seem to come alive\n\nin ways that really tasks the limits\n\nof the Sega Dreamcast for players\n\nwas a revelation of how immersive\n\na video game world could be.\n\n2000, The Sims.\n\nOne of the geniuses of Will Wright\n\nis that he looked for inspirations in the everyday world.\n\nHis hit game Sim City drew on the way\n\nthat a model train set can bring alive a miniature world.\n\nSimilarly, with The Sims he found a dollhouse\n\nan inspiration for a new way of playing,\n\none that really changed the way we look at\n\nhow Sim games work and the worlds that they can create.\n\nPeople have been playing with dollhouses for centuries.\n\nBut The Sims brought alive worlds of players\n\nwho interacted with each other, had emotions,\n\nand did mundane, every day things like going to work\n\nor using the bathroom.\n\nThe game was strangely compelling.\n\nPlayers spent hours building their Sims up,\n\nseeing them interact with each other,\n\nand really creating this digital world that felt alive\n\nand the realism and the emotions that the Sims felt\n\nand related to one another.\n\n2001, Halo: Combat Evolved.\n\nA game called GoldenEye on the Nintendo 64\n\nshowed that first person shooters\n\ncould be successful on consoles.\n\nIn 2001 Microsoft broke into\n\nthe home console market with their Xbox.\n\nThey perfected it.\n\nOr at least came really, really close.\n\nHalo was a game that broke the boundaries\n\nof what a traditional first person shooter could be.\n\nIt had a sweeping plot line, a highly developed world,\n\nand characters that players really, really bonded with.\n\nIt also pioneered some new game mechanics,\n\nlike the idea of only being able\n\nto carry two weapons at a time.\n\nThat forced players to asses and reassess every situation\n\nthat they went into in order to make sure\n\nthat they had the correct weapon.\n\nHalo became known as the Xbox's killer app,\n\nwhich basically means that the console might not have sold\n\nnearly so well without it.\n\nIn fact, a full 50% of Xbox consoles sold\n\nin conjunction with a copy of the Halo game.\n\nHalo also became extraordinarily famous for its multiplayer,\n\nwhich might seem odd because it actually\n\ncame out before the advent of Xbox Live\n\nand players had to play on a local area network connection.\n\nBut it allowed up to 16 people to play simultaneously,\n\nwhich was huge for a console at the time.\n\nIt may be an exaggeration to say\n\nthat the fate of the Xbox franchise rested on Halo,\n\nbut not that much of an exaggeration.\n\nThe game was really instrumental in cementing\n\nnot only the platform success,\n\nbut an image of what sort of player\n\nreally gravitated towards the Xbox.\n\n2002, Metal Gear Solid 2.\n\nVideo games are usually built around\n\nspeed, action, and less so stealth.\n\nBut the Metal Gear Solid franchise\n\nwas really key in bringing that game mechanic to popularity.\n\nAnd yet this game had its own form of stealth.\n\nMetal Gear Solid 2 reshaped the face of stealth games.\n\nHideo Kojima's brilliant game really brought\n\nthe artistry of a stealth game\n\nwith its different demands on a player\n\nto a new height that hadn't been reached before.\n\nMetal Gear Solid is the most enduring\n\nstealth franchise in video games.\n\nAnd Metal Gear Solid 2 was key to making that happen.\n\n2003, Call of Duty.\n\nWorld War II is often known as the good war,\n\nwith clear protagonists and antagonists.\n\nThe result is that it is easily ported over to video games.\n\nBut no game has ever done it as well,\n\nperhaps, as Call of Duty.\n\nIt put players on a mission to fight the enemy\n\nin a way that was thrilling,\n\nand at the time, highly realistic.\n\nJust as generations earlier,\n\nlittle kids that played with little green army men\n\nin their sandboxes, now kids all grown up,\n\nhave an amazing time playing in this world\n\nof Word War II in which you were\n\ntrying to fight the enemy and stay alive.\n\nAs a franchise, Call of Duty has been a tremendous hit\n\nfor Activision and some of\n\nthe bestselling games of all time.\n\n2004, World of Warcraft.\n\nIn 1997 Richard Garriott coined the term\n\nmassively multiplayer online role playing game,\n\nor MMORPG for short, for his game Ultima Online.\n\nBut it wasn't until 2004 when Blizzard released\n\nWorld of Warcraft when the genre really took hold.\n\nWith its peak of 12 million players,\n\nWOW really took the internet by storm.\n\nNot only was it an easier RPG,\n\nwhich allowed players who maybe wouldn't be so interested\n\nin in depth role playing game to play,\n\nit also made it super easy for people to catch up\n\nwith lots of XP giving quests and not huge penalties\n\nwhen you die.\n\nIt made novice players able to catch up to\n\nthe more experienced companions a lot faster than normal.\n\nWorld of Warcraft is still\n\nthe most iconic MMORPG on the map.\n\nWhen people think of MMOs they still\n\nthink of World of Warcraft first.\n\n2005, Guitar Hero.\n\nIn video games it's all about the controller.\n\nThink about the simple Atari joystick,\n\nor the controller for the NES.\n\nBut most controllers are variations on a theme.\n\nWith Guitar Hero players got something completely different.\n\nHere was a simulated guitar that anyone could pick up\n\nand know sort of what to do with pretty much right away.\n\nGuitar Hero was a party game\n\nthat expanded their reach of video games.\n\nAnyone at a social gathering wanted to pick up the guitar\n\nand play and try to see how they do,\n\neven if, in the end,\n\nthey probably didn't hit all the right notes.\n\n2006, Wii Sports.\n\nYou probably have an idea in your head\n\nwhen someone says, I'm a video gamer.\n\nAnd the first thing you think of is\n\nprobably not your 90-year-old grandmother.\n\nBut wen it comes to Wii Sports\n\nyou might as well think about her,\n\nbecause she's probably playing it.\n\nAlong with all of her grandkids.\n\nWii Sports became one of the most popular sports games\n\nand one of the most popular games of all time\n\nand launched the Nintendo Wii console to massive success.\n\nIn fact, there were lots of people\n\nwho were buying Nintendo Wii who didn't even know\n\nthat it could play a different game.\n\nWii Sports helped the Nintendo Wii\n\nsell over 100 million consoles,\n\nand its' motion-controlled remote and nunchuck\n\neven spurred Microsoft and Sony\n\nto design their own motion controlled system\n\nthe Microsoft Kinect and the PlayStation move.\n\n2007, Portal.\n\nIn 2007 Valve Corporation released a really interesting,\n\nalmost funny-looking game called The Orange Box.\n\nIt was a compilation of five games.\n\nFour of them were first person shooters\n\nfrom some of their more popular franchises,\n\nlike Half Life Two and Team Fortress Two,\n\nand there was this short puzzle game called Portal.\n\nSurprisingly enough, that small game,\n\nwhich could be completed in four hours or less,\n\nended up receiving more critical acclaim\n\nthan the other four games put together.\n\nPortal had a unique gameplay system using portal guns,\n\nwhich allowed the shooter to shoot in one area\n\nand move in a different direction.\n\nSo you could exit one room in one direction\n\nand enter another in the opposite direction,\n\nor in fact move through walls and ceilings.\n\nBut one of the most enduring parts of portal\n\nwas its single vocalist.\n\n[GLaDOS] Very, very good.\n\nA complementary victory lift\n\nhas been activated in the main chamber.\n\nHer name was Ellen McClain\n\nand she played a darkly sarcastic\n\nartificial intelligence named GLaDOS,\n\nwho promised to navigate you\n\nthrough the Aperture Science Lab.\n\nAnd as long as you perform to her satisfaction,\n\nyou would be rewarded with a delicious slice\n\nof black forest cake.\n\nUnfortunately the cake was a lie.\n\nShe actually tried to kill you.\n\n[video game sounds]\n\n2008, World of Goo.\n\nVideo games, especially starting in the 1990s,\n\nwere made by massive teams pouring massive amounts of money\n\ninto the development of the game.\n\nBut starting in the early 2000s\n\nnew tools began to emerge that allowed single individuals\n\nor small teams to create a game.\n\nOne of those games was World of Goo.\n\nA fun, splattering game that really\n\nhad a playful spirit about it,\n\nand yet, low budget looking animations.\n\nThe result was something attainable,\n\nyet fun, and really spurred the indie game movement\n\nthat really is a key player in today's video game world.\n\n2009, Angry Birds.\n\nIt's the first game that really transcended mobile gaming.\n\nNot only inspired people sometimes to buy a phone itself,\n\nbut also to buy lots of other merchandise\n\ninspired by the game.\n\nAngry Birds was important,\n\nnot only for its popularity,\n\nbut the way it brought new gamers into the fold of gaming.\n\nSomeone who would never consider themselves a gamer\n\nfound themselves addicted to Angry Birds.\n\nEagerness to see if they could knock down\n\nthose devilish pigs and really try to get\n\nto the next level in the game that was frustrating,\n\nfascinating, and most of all, fun.\n\n2010, Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty.\n\nStarcraft is one of the best examples\n\nof the real time strategy genre.\n\nUnlike a lot of the most popular\n\nreal time strategy games, it takes place in space,\n\nwith three very distinct races.\n\nHumans, Protoss, and Zergs.\n\nOne of the things that sets Starcraft apart\n\nfrom its contemporaries\n\nwas the fact that each faction was uniquely different\n\nin how you could build your bases,\n\nlead your armies, and what your powers were.\n\nThe original Starcraft also pioneered what we call today\n\nthe eGames Sports movement.\n\nThe eSports movement was especially popular in South Korea.\n\nBut with Starcraft 2 it branched out\n\nand became one of the most popular eSport games worldwide.\n\n2011, Minecraft.\n\nA Lego brick affords a lot more varieties at play\n\nthan the talking Barbie.\n\nBoth can be fun, but one opens up many more possibilities.\n\nMinecraft was the Lego brick of the video game universe.\n\nAdd simple eight-bit looking graphics\n\nthat opened up a creative world for players\n\nto build things that they could imagine\n\nin ways they couldn't build in real life\n\nwith those atom-based Lego bricks.\n\nResult was a game that has yielded\n\nmillions of hours of gameplay as players\n\ndiscover the possibilities of building something\n\non the computer screen that before they could only imagine.\n\n2012, Journey.\n\nSet in a vast desert where the player feels small against\n\nthis wide expansive sand and tall mountains.\n\nJourney evokes this sense of solitude and wonder.\n\nPlayers are allowed to communicate\n\nwith each other only through chimes.\n\nNot through a voice or text.\n\nThey can help each other but never hinder.\n\nThe game was also designed to be so simplistic\n\nthat players wouldn't require any in-game instruction\n\nso they wouldn't be taken out of their world.\n\nJourney is also known for its\n\nsweeping, evocative soundtrack,\n\nwhich was the first video game\n\nto be nominated for a Grammy Award.\n\n[intense music]\n\n2013, The Last of US.\n\nEarly video games were long on play and short on story.\n\nThere's not much story in Donkey Kong.\n\nIt was a damsel in distress,\n\nJump Man rescuing his love.\n\nYeah, as games have developed over time\n\nthe stories have gotten more compelling,\n\nand studios have learned how to tell\n\nthose stories more effectively.\n\nThe Last of Us, in some ways,\n\n[voice muffled] very standard genre,\n\nthe zombie apocalypse.\n\nWith many video games there are very artificial mechanics\n\nthat move the story along.\n\nMaybe you get to a new level, for instance,\n\nor your character gains new abilities.\n\nBut The Last of Us, you're in the story always,\n\nas your main character and the girl who is the sidekick,\n\nwent through the story, developing almost like a novel.\n\nIt was compelling because it felt real\n\nin a way that more artificial systems would not have.\n\n2014, Destiny.\n\nDestiny was developed by Bungie,\n\nbest known for their Halo franchise.\n\nAnd with Destiny they created yet another hit.\n\nPerhaps best known for its persistent online world,\n\nwhich means that things continuously happen\n\neven when you're not logged on,\n\nDestiny creates a world where players\n\ncan do their own thing,\n\nbut also just randomly meet up with other people\n\nfor worldwide events.\n\nMaybe there's a boss fight that pops up.\n\nOr a raid that needs to be completed.\n\nEveryone can interact or you can ignore it\n\nand just keep on doing what you're doing.\n\nThe choice is up to you.\n\nBungie also made a commitment with Destiny\n\nthat it was going to be continuously updated,\n\nthey said until the end of time.\n\nBut probably at least until\n\nthe company goes out of business.\n\nBecause of that Destiny receives continuous updates\n\nand support so players never have to worry\n\nthat they're gonna run out of new content.\n\n2015, Undertale.\n\nMost video games are developed by a whole crowd of people,\n\nor at the very least one or two.\n\nUndertale was developed, published,\n\nwritten, and composed by a single person, Toby Fox.\n\nHe created a game that he wanted to play.\n\nAnd if there was an element in a game that he didn't like,\n\nhe just didn't include it.\n\nSo for example, he hated fetch quests\n\nbecause it made you go back and retread old ground.\n\nHe also hated being forced to grind for experience points.\n\nSo none of those things appeared in Undertale.\n\nOne thing that did, however,\n\nwas a very interesting game mechanic\n\nthat allowed you three choices whenever you faced a monster.\n\nYou could fight them and kill them\n\nlike you normally would in a video game,\n\nbut you could also choose to flea\n\nor you could choose to befriend them.\n\nAnd depending on you choice,\n\nand your various choices throughout the game,\n\nyou received a different ending.\n\nThat could sometimes even continue on to subsequent plays\n\nif you decided to play the game over again.\n\n2016, That Dragon, Cancer.\n\nWhen Trip Hawkins first started Electronic Arts,\n\nhe ran a series of ads that asked the question,\n\ncan a game make you cry?\n\nWith That Dragon, Cancer, there was a game\n\nthat really had the potential to move players to tears,\n\nin large part because it was based\n\non the real life experience of the developer,\n\nwho lost his son.\n\nThat Dragon, Cancer, brought to the video game\n\nthe tragedy and sometimes the tedium of what it was like\n\nto wait with a sick child, to experience that.\n\nIt's a game that anyone who played it could not forget.\n\nAnd it's a game that began to show the power of the medium\n\nas it developed to bring new senses\n\nof what was possible in video games.\n\nNew ways to move players and new ways to show the artistry\n\nand the pathos that is possible in video games.\n\n2017, Fortnite.\n\nThe most important games sometimes aren't the first games\n\nto adapt a certain medium.\n\nTake the battle royale mode of video games.\n\nFortnite was not the first game\n\nto use a battle royale mode,\n\nin which you're the last player standing.\n\nThink of something like Hunger Games, for instance.\n\nBut something about Fortnite was compelling.\n\nWell, maybe that something was the fact\n\nthat it was free to play\n\nand also the fact that it had graphics\n\nthat were accessible to anyone.\n\nMeanwhile, a circle is shrinking,\n\nlimiting the amount of space you can go.\n\nMeaning that in the end only one person will survive.\n\nIt was not the first battle royale game,\n\nbut something about the game,\n\nthat combination of fast action,\n\nof suspense, of accessible graphics,\n\nand the free to play mode made it a video game phenomenon,\n\nbrought new players in,\n\nbrought players of all ages together to play.\n\n2018, Celeste.\n\nSome games you just enjoy playing.\n\nThere's not really as much rhyme or reason for it,\n\nyou just really like it.\n\nCeleste tended to be one of those,\n\nwith the gamers for whom it was popular.\n\nCeleste had some interesting game mechanics\n\nthat allowed you to do things like double dash in midair.\n\nIt wasn't the first game to do that,\n\nbut combined with the fact that each room\n\nwas its own individual puzzle,\n\nit made everything feel faster, stronger,\n\nand it also allowed for a great deal of replayability,\n\nsince each room had maybe a different way to play it.\n\nSeveral rooms also had hidden cassette tapes.\n\nIf you found the cassette tape\n\nit would unlock a b-side to the level,\n\nwhich was a harder version.\n\nIf you beat every single b-side\n\nit unlocked a c-side and allowed you\n\nto play an even harder version.\n\nBasically allowing for almost\n\nendless replayability of the game.\n\nBut what really hooked a lot of players to Celeste\n\nwas the protagonist herself,\n\na young girl named Madeline,\n\nwho was trying desperately to scale a mountain.\n\nShe kept being hindered by a reflection of herself\n\nthat she called a piece of me.\n\nIt turned out that this piece of her\n\nwas a metaphor for her own internal anxiety and depression,\n\nand it was only by combining the two aspects of herself,\n\nthat she was able to finally scale the mountain,\n\nwhich is a really interesting metaphor,\n\nI think, for most of us.\n\n[Jon-Paul] That was every iconic game\n\nfor the past 40 years.\n\n[Shannon] We hope you learned something\n\nand had some fun doing it.\n\nWe'll look forward to seeing what the next 40 years bring.\n\n[light music]"
