        "text": "The game was not internally developed by Techn≈çs Japan, who were busy working on other projects at the time such as WWF Superstars and The Combatribes. Instead a company called East Technology, whose previous work was the 1989 arcade shoot-'em-up Gigandes, was contracted to develop the third game in the series, resulting in a sequel with a drastically different gameplay and graphic style than its predecessors. The game was controversial upon its release due to the addition of item shops where players acquire power-ups by inserting real money into the cabinet, which was removed from the later Japanese release after negative feedback from play-testers.\n\nIs this the first instance of microtransactions in gaming? You can see the shop at 0:57 in the video down below.\n\nI mean, arcade games charge you money for continues, which has the same end result of \"pay more, go farther\", so they're all kinda that way.\n\nThe difference is that everything is locked behind a paywall, including the special attacks and powerups..\n\nI don't remember that aspect of the arcade game but it was such a disappointing sequel, I only played it once.\n\nthis game was awful.\n\nYeah, from what I could gather this game is easily the black sheep of the franchise. Technos Japan really screwed the pooch by farming a game of this flagship series to a third party developer.\n\nThe difference is that everything is locked behind a paywall, including the special attacks and powerups..\n\nAgain, though, think about the end result.\n\nYou get a game over, you need to pay to continue.\n\nBut if these things you're buying let you make it further before continuing, then you're just spending that money at a different point. You're spending money to proactively avoid getting to the game-over screen so soon, rather than getting to it sooner and paying to continue.\n\nEither way, you're paying up if you want to see more of the game.\n\nAgain, though, think about the end result.\n\nYou get a game over, you need to pay to continue.\n\nBut if these things you're buying let you make it further before continuing, then you're just spending that money at a different point. You're spending money to proactively avoid getting to the game-over screen so soon, rather than getting to it sooner and paying to continue.\n\nEither way, you're paying up if you want to see more of the game.\n\nGood point. Arcades games are supposed to get people to spend more money on them. Guess there was a limit on how much they could fleece the players.\n\nRenting a game again doesn't let you continue from the moment of your death with zero penalty.\n\nArcade brawlers are all literally pay to win;\n\nWell, I mean in the sense you are not buying the game, but paying for more time with it. It's not like beat'em ups were the only arcade titles. And you could rent a game again to continue where you left off if the game had passwords. And there were score penalties. And some games not only restricted routes depending on continues - obvious one being the Akuma fight in SSF2T - they also penalize multiple deaths even before hitting continue - Dodonpachi being an example of doing both things.\n\nI remember this one. I've never seen a store get rid of an arcade machine so fast. It was literally a few days before my local store replaced DD3 with something else. Grand opening, grand closing. Everyone hated it. What made all of us hate it even more was that they took out Smash TV for that piece of shit.\n\nGauntlet was probably among the first with its countdown health meter, but DD3 is definitely among them.\n\nalso this aren't *all* arcade games P2W hottake is so needlessly reductive and pithy. Most arcade games can be cleared on one credit with extensive practice. P2W games have cool-down timers by design.\n\nI was going to say something similar to the bolded. Glad to see someone made this point first.\n\nI remember as a kid the first time I was playing it at the local arcade and thinking it was bullshit it wanted you to give it more money. I remember those quarter eating hologram games or dragons lair that relied on trial and error memorization got way more players than double dragon 3 did.\n\nMaybe Im remembering wrong, but I think I remember reading years ago that it was only the NA version of the game that had the pay to win nonsense and the other versions of the game played like a normal double dragon game.\n\nWouldn't inserting a coin to continue in basically any arcade game count as a microtransaction?\n\nYou don't start with a base cost though. If it was 20 to get into an arcade and you paid each death, yes, it would be pay to play.\n\nOff the top of my head 1989's Ivan \"Iron Man\" Stewart's Off Road let you insert quarters to buy more upgrades for your car from the in game shop, and I believe 1987's Xybots let you buy upgrades as well. Of course you could buy more health or time in plenty of much earlier games like Gauntlet if that counts.\n\nFun fact about Off Road: the worst thing you could do to yourself was to use the nitro button. Every time you used it the grey car got a little bit faster, and eventually even a fully maxed car isn't fast enough to win without using nitros. The key to playing a long time on 1 credit was never to use the nitro button.\n\nAnd everyone rejected it. DD3 was the least popular entry by a country mile.\n\nPretty much this. While all arcade games were meant to eat quarters, this one seemed overly cheap in that regard. And yeah, amazingly, I think people caught on to that and it was well known to be a piece of shit game around arcade gamers. Sad thing, probably a lot of those gamers are now hooked on microtransactions via mobile and console games and just gave up the fight. The nickle-and-dimers have WON!\n\n\"Doesn't this game look awesome? Give us a quarter and you can play it.\"\n\n\"Okay, sure.\"\n\n\"Oh, but it'll be another quarter for the game not to totally suck.\"\n\nIt's less an issue of asking players for money and moreso an issue of asking them for money for something stupid. A lot of work goes into just making an arcade game attractive enough that the player will want to try it; asking you for money to continue is based on the promise that if you liked the game they already gave you they'll give you more.\n\nAt any given time, you could leave the Double Dragon 3 machine and play something else. Making the game less attractive than it could be just encourages them to leave and not come back.\n\nDefine \"good.\" That game sucked. One life and it was game over with no continues.\n\nIt was difficult (perhaps unfairly so), but otherwise DD3 NES was arguably the best beat 'em up on the system. The core combat was the best DD has ever had, and the ability to recruit bosses as alternate characters was great. And the globe-trotting levels were a lot better than the dumb tank/helicopter/gears levels in DD2. Also, the final boss was amazing.\n\nGame was awful, even the NES version was trash. This is coming from a beat em up enthusiast that loves pretty much every game in the genre.\n\nDifficultly aside, what was wrong with the NES DD3?\n\nIt was difficult (perhaps unfairly so), but otherwise DD3 NES was arguably the best beat 'em up on the system.

Also, the final boss was amazing.\n\nDifficultly aside, what was wrong with the NES DD3?\n\nThat's the thing. The game was too stupidly, unfairly difficult to see any of that. My brother and I were lucky to ever see what was beyond the third level even once."
