Ownership

WVJS programming began November 27, 1947, from studios located at 324 Allen St in downtown Owensboro. The station's transmitter building and multi tower directional array were located on a 26-acre tract of land on U.S. Highway 60, just west of the Owensboro city limits. The station operated at 1420 kc with 1,000 watts of power. The following year WVJS-FM went on the air at 96.1 mc.

The stations were owned and operated by Owensboro on the Air, Incorporated. Owensboro developer Vincent J. Steele was majority owner. Owensboro radio veteran Malcolm Greep, who was a driving force in starting WVJS, was named general manager of the new station.

In early 1960, WVJS closed its downtown studios on Allen St and consolidated all of its operations at the company's transmitting site on Highway 60. In 1962, WVJS was granted FCC approval to boost daytime power to 5,000 watts. In 1963, the station's FM call letters were changed to WSTO and it became Kentucky's first full-time stereo broadcasting station.

In 1973, Owensboro on the Air was granted a franchise by the city to provide cable television service to Owensboro and a new building to house Owensboro Cablevision was constructed at the company's Highway 60 site.

In 1983, V.J. Steele's heirs sold WVJS, WSTO and the cable TV operations to Century Communications Corporation of New Canaan, Connecticut.

At the end of 1996, Century sold WVJS and WSTO to Brill Media which already owned Owensboro stations WOMI and WBKR. WSTO was later sold to South Central Communications of Evansville, Indiana.

In 2002, WVJS was purchased by its current owner, Cromwell Radio Group, and shares facilities at 1115 Tamarack Rd, Owensboro, with Cromwell stations WBIO, WXCM, WKCM, WLME, WCJZ and WTCJ.
