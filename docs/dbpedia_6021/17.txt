History

The station was originally WLLS-FM (Later, jokingly made into the reverse acronym "We Love Lloyd Spivey," in reference to the original sole station operator.) when the station signed on in 1972, playing a Top 40 format. In 1982, the station switched to a country format under a branding of LS 106. It was a simulcast of the now-defunct WLLS-AM (later WSNR, recently WAIA). The calls were switched to WKHB on Oct. 1, 1996. The current WXMZ calls were assigned by the Federal Communications Commission on March 19, 1999.[1] WAIA simulcasted WKYAâs signal until July 2012, when WAIA permanently went off the air. WXMZ moved its signal to its current frequency of 99.9 megahertz, and began broadcasting its current format.

Coverage area

In addition to Ohio and Butler counties, WXMZâs radio signal can also cover significant areas in other neighboring counties such as Muhlenberg, McLean, southern Daviess, and nearby portions of western Grayson County, including Central City, Livermore, the southern suburbs of Owensboro, and Caneyville, respectively. Some western portions of Edmonson County can also receive WXMZâs signal as well.
