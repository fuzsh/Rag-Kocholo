        "text": "Rob Calhoun (RadioRob) says he's loved radio since he was born.\n\nI got my start at simulated bigtime radio when I was 16 years old. I was entrusted with the coveted Sunday Morning Drive Time Shift at WVLK in Lexington, KY. I was the one who ran \"The Christian Hour\", a program which ran only fifteen minutes and played gospel favorites like \"Tennessee Ernie Ford sings with The San Quentin Prison Choir.\" I graduated from that to being an all-around utility dude.\n\nMy first chance for normal hours was at WVJS in Owensboro, KY., the place to learn how to do radio  and I did  becoming afternoons and Assistant PD. Sadly, I entered this business during deregulation and the Telecom Bill. After four years, a new GM eliminated my position for automation. I wound up working for The Cromwell Group's WKCM/WLME in Tell City, IN. Details of that time of hell could be used as a screenplay for \"Pulp Fiction II\". I stepped away from radio for a bit only to return to CHR 96STO (WVJS' sister) Evansville, IN/Owensboro, KY. First middays and then to nights (my dream gig).\n\nLife was nice but the Telecom Bill headed its ugly rear once again. The new owner hired a GM who was able to do what a fire in 1964 and a tower collapse in 1983 couldn't do: bring WSTO to its knees! I was staff casualty number 25, I think. After a two week vacation through the North Carolina mountains and coast scanning the radio dial, I determined radio was a \"vast wasteland\" with a few exceptions like Jackson Armstrong at Oldies 93 in Winston Salem, NC. I returned to Owensboro and went to work with my former WVJS boss Joe Lowe. I handle audio/video needs for The Executive Inn, a 640 room hotel/convention center and do freelance voice work.\n\nTOP STREAM 32 Kbps (8.5 Khz)\n\nDusty Rhodes, WSAI Cincinnati, OH August 21, 1978\n\n(18:21)\n\n. . . This is Dusty on duty . . .\n\nThe Top 40 world as WSAI 1360 knew it ended with Randy Michaels' arrival to the Queen City. Michaels programmed Top 40 on FM with Q102 around 1975 marking an end to WSAI's dominance. Michaels left the market a year later to program sister station WDAF in Kansas City. He changed the format from Middle Of The Road to Country. Michaels returned to Cincinnati in the summer of 1978 to lay his programming hands on WKRC-AM (55KRC). Much like WDAF, 55KRC was playing Middle Of The Road music and suffered ratings problems.\n\nRumors were strong that Michaels was planning to change 55KRC to Country. In reality, the presentation was updated to what we now call \"Hot AC\". But WSAI's management believed the rumor and decided to beat Michaels to the format. On August 22, 1978 at six A.M., WSAI 1360 changed formats from Top 40 to Country.\n\nThis aircheck is from the evening before, a \"Goodbye to SAI\". Former WSAI night personality Dusty Rhodes was brought back to ride WSAI into the Top 40 sunset.\n\n(Courtesy of California Aircheck)\n\nTOP STREAM 32.1 Kbps (16 Khz)\n\nQ102 Cincinnati Hyde Park Honk Off, April 1 1983\n\n(9:38)\n\n. . . We're leavin' the square - the cops are after us . . .\n\nQ102 was one hell of a listening experience. By name it was a CHR, but it played a lot of oldies. It was nothing to hear House of the Rising Sun and Shalamar in the same quarter hour. Back in those days, it was a party atmosphere 24/7 at 1906 Highland Avenue.\n\nAt the time, WEBN's studios were in the Hyde Park township of Cincinnati. So Q102 decided to make a Friday night visit to Hyde Park Square and invite listeners to meet them there and honk their horns in protest of WEBN. And as an added bonus, if you showed up with underwear on your head, you'd get a Q102 T-shirt. Did I mention they did this without the permission of anyone  like the cops?\n\nOn this you hear Mark Sebastian, Randy Michaels, Chris O'Brien and others.\n\nTOP STREAM 32.0 Kbps (16 Khz)\n\nSkipper T., KYMO East Prairie Missouri, August 8, 1982 (5:47)\n\n. . . Missouri's Amazing A.M. . . .\n\nThis is a reminder of what radio was like in some small towns before satellite and automation. I read on a defunct web site a while back that KYMO was a barn burner. It was a 500 watt daytime CHR, used JAM jingles and did things right. It held on to a contemporary format until the mid-eighties.\n\nSkipper T. (Skip Spence) has made a few comments on this site and was in Evansville radio a couple of years back doing a weekend shift at Oldies WJPS. He really smoked with the format getting into it better than some of the full time jocks. What can I say, he made me turn the radio up and jam!\n\nTOP STREAM 32.0 Kbps (16 Khz)\n\nBorder Radio, National Public Radio, 1986 (26:35)\n\n. . . And he broke in on the Reverend's message, yelling pistoleros!, and you could hear the bullets . . .\n\n[Description by contributor Rob Calhoun]\n\nThis All Things Considered report prepared by Rachel Maurer was a brief history of the Border Blasters, including XER, XERA and XERF, with a focus on Dr. John Brinkley and Wolfman Jack. (Wolfman appears around 16:09.)\n\nAll that power  sources claim up to a million watts at times  spread the word about the magic of goat glands that increase virility. It was also during those years the Border Blasters gave much of the world its first exposure to Country and Soul music.\n\nThe advantage of working for an NPR affiliate is when you heard a story that's worth keeping, you record a later feed. I stayed late that night to catch this audio gem."
