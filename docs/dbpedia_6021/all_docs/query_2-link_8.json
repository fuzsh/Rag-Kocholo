Lislon had learned that aisles to accommodate his wheelchair must be 36 inches wide The space be- tween the counter and the wall must be more than 40 inches so he can turn the chair around in this strate- gic area By sitting on the side of his wheel- chair. Liston can reach the highest of the wall racks. He cannot unpack or pack record and tape cartons, so he believes an able-bodied person should be a regular store employe. By the time Tim Rector left about Apnl 1978, Liston figured he needed a third person John Kaney was hired immediately and Mariha Nickel joined the Budget store in Septcm ber The slore operated about nine hours six days per week and four hours on Sunday after- noons. Liston spends about eight hours six days per week in the store Bob Liston: Building a successful re- tail operation. He finds records and tapes a great profession for the handicapped. \"It's great for me. I can learn much by just listening to the product and reading backliners of albums. Good retailing means you communicate that to your customer in a pleasant, friendly manner,\" Liston reports \"I enjoy being with people. This type of work takes the physically handi- capped righl into the midst of thmgs. Wc have people who come in. get ac- quainted and come back repeatedly before ihey buy their first product.

Aside from ihe companies, distributors, and dealers, the disco fan must be given a portion of the blame for Ihe current stale of the market For this, there arc iwo reasons. Firsl. the typical disco customer has substantially less knowl- edge about his music than does the fan of almosi any other cate- gory of recordings. Often he doesn'i know the correct nameofa given song Even less frequently does he know the name of the artist. A perfect example is \"Le Freak.\" Most customers asked for \"Freak Oul.\" and very few- knew that it was by Chic (often pronounced \"Chick \"I 'Caviano should spend some time in retailing' Secondly, disco bands do not generate fan loyalty. A hit record will not inspire sales of other records in an artist's cata- log, nor will it ensure that future product will gel even a second glance A steady stnng of chart successes is the only guarantee of continued sales. The \"cull\" following enjoyed by many riK:k artists is yel not a factor in the disco market Caviano bemoans the fact that posters, mobiles, and other merchandising aids are not available to the retailer tn support of disco product, 1 can sec a good reason for this They wtiuld not do much to help sales If the customer is not even aware ol ihc name of an ariisi. point of purchase displays and in-siore appearances would he a waste of space and time Another problem is ihe proliferation of disco product. It is not uncommon lor a retail outlet lo receive weekly 10. 20. or even more new disco albums, plus tnnumerablc 7 and 12-inch singles from various artists, both known and unknown, an im- possiWe number of records to audition propcriy itt addition, il would be undesirable, in a sht>p ailcmpiing lo attract a diver- sified clientele, to grant them all in-store play and see which caught Ihe customers' ears.

Barring Disk Coding B> BEN KAROL We have been hearing a great deal of talk over the past two years about bar coding. Many leaders in the record industry l>e- lievc II could be a valuable loot I do noi agree. Most industries sell the same sundard items on a regular, re- peating palten. and when differences appear in lhal pattern, projections can be made and used as a future guide But, if we apply this concept to records and tapes, ii will give us no clue whalsocver as to the future selling pt>ssibi|iiics of our product. 1 he reasons are obvious if we track best-selling chart items. Records come and go. and in no way do they have a regular pattern of either growth or predtclabiliiy. The only way a dealer has of knowing how to maintain in- ventory IS lo live with It on a daily basis, and to have frequent conferences with the people in his organization who do In order to make use of bar coding, a large initial mvestmeni in a highly complex system is required. After that large invesl- meni there are maintenance cosis lhal go on forever All these additional expenses must be reflected in higher business costs lhal are passed on to the consumer. I realize that costs of the system are supposed to be defrayed by greater efficiency However, my educated guess is that the system will not work, and that the costs will increase selling prices which, in the long run. will result in less business. If bar coding is 10 work at all. which I doubt, il might be of some help lo large rack operators that restrict ihcir sales and in- vcnlory to a limited number of items. But operations that might benefit from bar coding represent a minority of dealers and sates. They should not be a determining factor in any decision as lo whether we adopt bar coding.
