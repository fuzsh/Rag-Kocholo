        "text": "Radio Provides A Lifeline during Hawaii Wildfires\n\nDate Posted: 8/21/2023\n\nEmergency experts recommend families keep a battery-operated radio as part of their emergency kits, because during disaster, broadcastings efficiency and resilience makes it a vital communications resource. \"Radio has been the only lifeline and line of communication to the people of West Maui. For days there has been no power, no water, and no Internet service,\" Chuck Bergson, president and CEO, Pacific Media Group, told Radio Ink.\n\n\"It was frustrating in the early stages of the crisis because the local government officials did not fully understand the capabilities and importance of radio,\" he continued. \"In the beginning, they were directing people to a website but that was useless because no one had internet.\"\n\n\"We hear their crying, their tears, their desperate pleas,\" Brandee Carvalho, host at Mauis KISS radio, told Hawaii News Now. \"It is real. Its very real for me.\"\n\nThese radio stations came together to broadcast daily updates from local government as well as information on emergency supplies and evacuation shelters.\n\nWFAN Details Broadcaster Rescue from Flooded Car\n\nDate Posted: 9/14/2021\n\nAudacys WFAN AM/FM New York City Moose and Maggie show broke the story on September 2 of the rescue of Yankees broadcaster John Sterling from his flooded car by fellow broadcaster Rickie Ricardo due to Hurricane Ida. Ricardo, who is the Spanish broadcast voice of the Yankees, was on his way home from the stadium when he received a call from a colleague about Sterling stuck in his car on a flooded street. Ricardo slowly made his way to where Sterling was on River Road in Edgewater after finally connecting on the phone due to spotty cell service and helped Sterling get out of the flooded car, wade through the water and into his car. It took about another hour to go half a mile to get to Sterlings home and then an hour after that for Ricardo to make it to his home a mile away, but both were safe after the ordeal.\n\nNashville Stations Lead Coverage Through Flood Emergency\n\nDate Posted: 3/30/2021\n\nRadio stations across Nashville in stayed on-air and broadcasting through emergency flooding during the end of March flooding.\n\nI am pleased that all five of our stations stayed on without any issues, Cumulus Media VP and Nashville area manager Charlie Cook told Country Insider. 103.3 Country WKDF, one of the clusters country stations along with 95.5 Nash Icon WSM-FM, had a 15-second blip Saturday night that Cook says may or may not have been weather-related.\n\nOur engineering staff has worked hard over the last year to get the stations to a point where we are confident about their stability, he said. Because everything is being done remotely right now it is more difficult than just doing current information over song intros, so the jocks had to stay on top of the changing weather and get into the RVT system to keep the listeners informed, but they know the drill and I was pleased with their performances.\n\nHouston Public Media Spotlights Water Crisis\n\nDate Posted: 2/26/2021\n\nUniversity of Houstons Houston Public Media reported on February 26 on those in the Houston area who were still without water a week after the winter storm. Some in Houstons Fifth Ward still had burst water pipes in their homes that had not been fixed, forcing them to rely on borrowed water and bottled water to bathe, cook, drink, wash dishes, flush the toilet and brush teeth. After the storm that left more than 8 million under a boil water advisory, some communities had not been able to bounce back as quickly even when the notice was lifted, highlighting racial inequities. Volunteer Amatullah Contractor helped coordinate a food and water drive on February 25 in the historically Black neighborhood after seeing the extraordinary need when she dropped off a few cases of water earlier in the week. People just started coming out of their homes because they saw people were gathering around me and they saw that I was holding a water case and they were like, Hey, can we get a case, can we get a case, can we get some water, Contractor said. And it was just like the worst feeling because I only had three cases in my car.\n\nTEGNA Texas Prepares for Storm\n\nDate Posted: 2/22/2021\n\nTEGNA Senior Vice President Brad Ramsey, president and general manager at ABC affiliate WFAA Dallas, Texas, spoke with TVSpy on Feb. 22 about their preparation for the winter weather. As senior vice president, Ramsey also oversees stations in 11 Texas markets. TEGNA stations cover 87% of households in the state and the station group has nearly 1,200 employees across Texas. We knew in the middle of last week that this was going to be a historic Texas storm, and we were largely prepared for the storm itself. Our stations started booking hotel rooms last Friday and Saturday, for what we knew would be extended hotel stays near our stations, said Ramsey. What we were not prepared for, and what the entire state of Texas was not prepared for, was the rolling blackouts not rolling. It became clear Monday afternoon that they were simply blackouts. I would estimate that more than half of our 1,200 employees in Texas were without power at some point Monday and/or Tuesday, and a notable portion of them for 24-36 hours straight, or more thats when we realized we had more of a humanitarian crisis than a weather crisis.\n\nRamsey discussed the storm prep meetings held at stations across the state, many of them including the chief meteorologists, and the effort to shift resources to digital content in anticipation of power outages. On Tuesday, at the height of the power outages, we had nearly 4 million visitors to our websites across Texas. I think at least part of our success can be attributed to focusing just as much on the written word as we did on video, knowing that cell service was jammed in a lot of places and for many consumers it was easier to access text than video. Ramsey said their top priority is keeping people safe in times of crisis, especially when it comes to their employees. I tell our teams in times like this that no soundbite, no piece of video, no story is more important than their own well-being. If our people arent fed, warm and safe they cant do their jobs. We were more so in the people business than the media business this week.\n\nKOBI and KOTI Provide Life-Saving Fire Coverage\n\nDate Posted: 10/7/2020\n\nCalifornia Oregon Broadcastings KOBI and KOTI Medford, Ore., provided life-saving coverage of the Almeda wildfires that destroyed over 2,600 residences and more than 180 businesses in September. They supplemented regular newscasts by continuously crawling the most current evacuation level information for residents in the areas being affected. During the fast-moving, devastating fire, they streamed a live view from their Sky Cam, accompanied by scanner audio from the local emergency services personnel. Local residents used this information source as they prepared to evacuate.\n\nThey also created an on-line resource guide that coordinated information for evacuees on where to stay, eat, and get needed supplies, and simultaneously to point generous community members to places to donate food, clothing, and necessities, as well as funds set up to help with urgent needs as well as short and long-term rebuilding. As of September 30th, this page had been accessed over 11,000 times by users.\n\nKOBI has been essential during all of these fires, said viewer Randy McKay. In Ashland, we were trapped on one side of the fire while my mom was on the other needing to be evacuated from harms way at her home in Talent and we could not reach her. It was panic-inducing. And when first the internet and then cellular communications failed, KOBI was the more reliable and constant source of information.\n\nI survived by watching Facebook KOBI-TV because they kept a live feed of the video from the manor and live broadcast of the dispatch where I could hear all the evacuation notices and knew the direction the fire was headed, said viewer Angalee OConnor.\n\nTEGNAs Facts Not Fear Approach to Coronavirus\n\nDate Posted: 2/28/2020\n\nTEGNA stations are committed to a Facts Not Fear approach to reporting on the coronavirus outbreak, with a focus on providing context and perspective, while not downplaying the severity of the situation. TEGNA is paying close attention to the graphics stations use and encourages reporters to take the time needed to ensure they report accurate information. National and local fact-checking teams at TEGNAs project Verify are focused on coronavirus misinformation and are creating accurate reports.\n\nNBC affiliate KPNX aired a segment addressing rumors about how coronavirus might spread on international flights.\n\nNBC affiliate KUSA Denver produced an 80-second video mission statement promising viewers that it will not play on our fears and yours with click-bait headlines. It also pledged not to guess or speculate or assume, but instead seek out multiple experts and vetted sources.\n\nNBC affiliate KSDK St. Louis also aired a segment about TEGNAs Facts Not Fear approach. The station offered a phone number so viewers can text questions about the coronavirus and receive answers from medical professionals.\n\nOur journalists and our news leaders are handling this with such care and such a commitment to help their communities, said TEGNA VP of News Ellen Crooke. They have a great sense of this is a duty to our country, to do this well and to do this properly.\n\nBroadcasters: A Lifeline During Hurricane Michael\n\nDate Posted: 11/4/2018\n\nBroadcasters in Florida and across the U.S. provided lifeline coverage before, during and after Hurricane Michael landed on October 10. It caused $8 billion in damage and killed 16 people in Florida and at least 10 in other states. Down power grids and severe damage to newsrooms did not stop coverage. Broadcasters aired more than 70,000 reports on Hurricane Michael, with stations breaking into scheduled programming as many as four times per hour. Radio provided more than 700 hours of coverage. Florida broadcasters aired more than 400 hours of hurricane coverage.\n\nAnother familiar aspect is local radio and TV broadcasters were unsung heroes in their first informer roles and in the aftermath, said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai.\n\nNexstars ABC affiliate WMBB Panama City and Grays NBC affiliate WJHG Panama City were knocked off the air but continued to provide local citizens with critical safety information. Gulf Coast State Colleges WKGC-FM Panama City evacuated to a remote studio at the Bay County Emergency Operation Center. They remained there for at least two weeks, providing cleanup information and food and water locations.\n\nPart of the WKGC mission has always been to provide information before, during and after a storm, said Station Manager Scott Kirkman.\n\nRead more about how radio prepared for the storm and how networks covered Hurricane Michael.\n\nBroadcasters Step up During Hurricane Florence\n\nDate Posted: 10/2/2018\n\nBroadcasters were well prepared to provide wall-to-wall coverage of Hurricane Florence, which made landfall on the coast of North Carolina on September 14. The storm killed at least 23 people, with some areas receiving up to 30 inches of rain. Radio and television stations in the Carolinas ramped up coverage ahead of the storm, disseminating vital information around the clock.\n\nNearly one million more residents in the Charlotte, Greensboro and Raleigh areas of North Carolina tuned into local newscasts on broadcast TV stations the week Hurricane Florence approached the East Coast and made landfall in the Carolinas than the previous week, according to data from ratings measurement service Nielsen.\n\nThese Nielsen ratings again highlight the critical first informer role of local broadcasting during emergencies, said NAB President and CEO Gordon Smith. As weve seen time and again, communities across the country rely on their local radio and TV stations for timely and lifesaving information. We applaud broadcasters who were in the path of Hurricane Florence for their continuous efforts to inform listeners and viewers.\n\nFormer FEMA administrator Craig Fugate tweeted: Tracking #Florence? Keep a radio in your Disaster Kit. Why, you have cell phone right? Until cellular services goes out, happen to me during Hurricane #Irma. No power, no Wifi, no cellular data. Radio was my only source for news and updates.\n\nCumulus in Charleston Prepares for Hurricane Florence\n\nDate Posted: 10/1/2018\n\nCumulus Charleston, S.C. Market Manager Sherry Dollar spoke to All Access about their preparation, which began the week before and included strategies discussed at their annual Crisis Team meeting in June. This includes generators, extra fuel and redundant fiber and coaxial Internet backed up by LTE. The five-station cluster partnered with Sinclairs ABC affiliate in Charleston to provide more coverage.\n\nOur responsibility as broadcasters is to keep the community informed, Dollar said. Being the lifeline for the community, the partnership extends community resources and ensures the necessary communication to get through the Hurricane and, just as important, post-event, to help get everyone back to where they need to be and community put back together.\n\nRadio is personal. Radio is a friend. Radio has a way of prompting a feeling of being in a safe place. Radio reminds the community they are not alone  we are in the trenches with them. During a crisis that will almost ensure power outages Radio becomes even more important. Everyone needs information. No one wants to feel alone -- hearing that voice that you know so well and that you listen to daily has a calming effect. Its like listening to a long-time friend that you trust.\n\nKFVS Meteorologist Honored\n\nView Video\n\nDate Posted: 3/1/2018\n\nRaycoms CBS affiliate KFVS-TV Cape Girardeau, Mo., Chief Meteorologist Grant Dade was honored on February 16 when the Missouri State Legislature adopted a special resolution honoring Dade for saving lives during a tornado on February 28, 2017. The EF4 tornado was more than a half mile wide and stayed on the ground for 50 miles, killing one person, destroying 40 homes and heavily damaging more than 100 more. Missouri State Representative Rick Francis presented Dade with a plaque at the site of homes that were destroyed. Grant met and spoke with some viewers.

The ABA sent radio and television stations a list of suggested organizations to promote to their audience, along with a graphic for websites and for television stations to use on air.\n\nStations Respond Nationwide to Hurricane Harvey\n\nDate Posted: 9/20/2017\n\nHurricane Harvey landed on the southeast coast of Texas on August 26, dumping more than 50 inches of rain in four days. Harvey dropped 19 trillion gallons of water, killing dozens and sending 30,000 people to emergency shelters. Radio and television stations across the country provided life-saving wall-to-wall emergency information and storm updates, with reporters risking their own safety to provide coverage. Broadcasters provided wall-to-wall coverage, with staff staying at flooded stations, sleeping in hotels and overcoming technical difficulties to stay on air and keep listeners informed. The FCC reported that as of mid-day on August 27, no TV station had been knocked off the air. Broadcasters also went to great lengths to raise millions of dollars for hurricane relief efforts.\n\n\"NAB salutes Texas and Gulf Coast broadcasters in the path of Hurricane Harvey who are devoting enormous resources to keeping people safe this weekend, said NAB President and CEO Gordon Smith. Local radio and TV stations play a unique role as first informers during emergency weather situations.\"\n\nBroadcasters and other news outlets have also played a critical role in conveying emergency information, and in some cases, even coordinating live, on-air rescues, said FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai. Everyone who is pitching in deserves our gratitude and support. Were all in this together.\n\nIn an interview with TEGNAs CBS affiliate KHOU-TV Houston, Vice President Mike Pence said, Well, first, let me thank you, and let me thank this station, and all the great local media that has been working, I know, around the clock, to get real time information to those that are struggling in the aftermath of landfall for Hurricane Harvey and now dealing with the historic flooding.\n\nRadio is the ultimate connector, Sarah Frazier of CBS Radio Houston told Radio Ink. Were connecting people to information and were connecting people to the relief efforts and, most importantly, to each other.\n\nLess than a week later, Hurricane Irma wreaked havoc on the Carribean Islands before hitting Floridas west coast. The storm battered Fort Myers and Tampa, and also affected Miami and the Florida Keys. Hurricane Irmas two landfalls on September 10 triggered evacuation orders for 5.6 million people, left more than 5.7 million people without power and caused flooding, plus scores of downed trees and power lines. Florida broadcasters took extensive precautions, including securing reserves of fuel and food, and provided wall-to-wall-coverage.\n\nKFVS Provides Life-Saving Tornado Coverage\n\nDate Posted: 4/4/2017\n\nRaycoms CBS affiliate KFVS-TV Cape Girardeau, MO provided wall-to-wall coverage of a tornado that landed on February 28 and provided support in the aftermath.

Congratulations on 20 years! I remember 1996 when you started out as my job at that time was close to your location. I also want to Thank You for your weather coverage at the time of the Hallam tornado. I lived in Hallam at the time of the tornado and our home was destroyed. We have rebuilt and live there now. I believe I survived because of your weather coverage. I know many Hallam folk say the same thing, that they watched channel 8 and knew to take cover. My daughter called me and told me to go to the basement and turn the TV to channel 8. I did what she said. I watched your weather broadcast and at the time I was even annoyed thinking I could not believe how you were making me so afraid of what was coming! I knew it was not normal and could not believe a tornado was coming. But, so glad you were telling us to do what you said and take cover! You did it right! People do not take the weather reports seriously!\n\nThank you so much for providing that serious weather broadcast and please continue to do that! Weather is not always warm and fuzzy! Thank God and Channel 8 that I am alive! You will always be my choice for my news and weather. I love Luke Dorris and his weather reports. He does a great job and I love it when he explains and teaches about the weather. Keep doing the great job you do. Keep us safe!\n\nThank you!\n\nViewers Thank KOTV for Tornado Coverage\n\nDate Posted: 3/17/2016\n\nGriffins CBS affiliate KOTV-TV Tulsa provided wall-to-wall coverage of tornadoes that hit the region on March 30. Oklahomans unfortunately know severe weather all too well, but they again turned to local broadcasters to help protect their families, said Marketing Manager Houston Hunt. As part of our service to the community Oklahomas Own News On 6/KOTV went into wall-to-wall coverage for four plus hours, while running no commercials, in order to keep our viewers safe, prepared and ahead of the storm... it is the right thing to do.\n\nThe station received the following calls from viewers:\n\nKellie Escue from Tilman WANTS TO THANK ALL NEWSON6 EMPLOYEES FOR THEIR EXCELLENT SERVICE LAST NIGHT DURING THE STORM!!!

She said our helicopter pilots were MAGNIFICENT last night and should be awarded for their bravery and coverage. She also thanks the entire station for all of the hard work and dedication each individual gives here.\n\nEast Coast Broadcasters: A Lifeline During Blizzard\n\nDate Posted: 2/16/2016\n\nOn January 22-23, Winter Storm Jonas brought record snowfall to the East Coast, with parts of New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. receiving more than two feet of snow.\n\nLocal radio and television broadcasters provided wall-to-wall coverage of the storm, delivering critical updates on weather patterns, road closures and emergency information to local residents. News crews and station staff members braved the elements during heavy snow falls and winds gusting at up to 40 miles per hour. They stayed at nearby hotels or set up cots at work to make sure their stations stayed on air.\n\nThe Television Bureau of Advertising (TVB)s analysis of Nielsen data \"reveals that local broadcast TV news was overwhelmingly preferred as the source for storm coverage over cable news during the blizzard on January 23, 2016.\"\n\nTVNewsCheck shared a video from Sinclairs ABC affiliate WJLAs 56 hours of live coverage, captured by 24 crews.\n\nHearsts NBC affiliate WBAL viewers thanked the station for providing critical updates. One viewer said: \"I just want to give you and your news casters a HUGE SHOUT OUT!!! We can always count on you to be out there in the thick of things whether winter conditions or other news worthy conditions keeping us up to date and informed. Especially now. My heart goes out for all you guys out in this nasty night letting us know what to expect. Everyone forgets that without the news we would be in trouble. SO A BIG THANK YOU TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU!!\"\n\nViewers, Red Cross Thank Broadcasters\n\nDate Posted: 11/5/2015\n\nWIS Columbia shared this letter from a viewer: \"I would like to commend the entire WIS news team for the outstanding job they have done bringing the viewers of this state very crucial information during this historic natural disaster. We all are aware that many of the WIS news team went many hours and some of them days without sleep. They all continued to provide updated information in the very most professional manner. Your teams unwavering dedication to getting the news out expeditiously undoubtedly saved lives and property. Your teams dedication to this state is nothing short of heroic.\"\n\nWYFF Greenville received this letter from Ann Wright, Executive Director of the Upstate SC Red Cross. It reads, in part: \"There really arent enough words to express our sincere appreciation for the telethon you and your team conducted on October 7, 2015 to help with the floods... Thanks to you and the team at WYFF, we raised $830,519!\n\nThe power of your television reach and the mission of the Red Cross to provide immediate, emergency relief resulted in the most successful telethon in our area in recent years. In fact, we have now worked with you and WYFF since Hurricane Hugo, 25 years ago to hold eight telethons and raise $3,325,073. That is truly amazing.\n\nYour willingness to do these telethons means that thousands of people received a hot meal, something to drink, a clean-up kit or a comfort kit filled with hygiene items and toys for children.\"\n\nCentral Texas and Oklahoma City Resdidents Rely on Broadcasters During Flood\n\nDate Posted: 6/4/2015\n\nAfter years of drought, parts of Texas and Oklahoma experienced historic rainfall that caused flooding, property destruction and power outages. More than 20 people died, as thousands of others evacuated their homes, were stranded in cars or slept in the Toyota Center after a Houston Rockets game. Local radio and television station staff braved the storm to provide lifeline news and weather to the community, raised money for flood relief and encouraged listeners and viewers to support the Red Cross.\n\niHeartMedias KASE-FM Austin, TX hosted a concert on June 3 featuring nationally syndicated radio talent Bobby Bones and his Raging Idiots band to raise money for the Central Texas Chapter of the Red Cross. \"Bobbys heart has always been in Austin, where The Bobby Bones Show got its start,\" said KASE-FM Program Director JT Bosch. \"He wants to do anything and everything possible to help his friends and family here in the area rebuild their lives.\" Sinclair Broadcastings CBS affiliate KEYE-TV Austin raised more than $14,000 on May 27 for the American Red Cross of Central Texas.\n\nStations that aired wall-to-wall coverage included Gannett Broadcastings CBS affiliate KHOU-TV, CBS Radios KILT-AM/FM, iHeartMedias KTBZ-FM and KASE-FM Austin, Tyler Media Groups KJKE-FM Oklahoma City, Cumulus Medias WBAP-AM Houston and KLIF-AM Dallas, Graham Medias NBC affiliate KPRC-TV Houston, Tribune Medias CW affiliate KIAH-TV Houston, and Fox owned-and-operated KRIV-TV Houston.

It is a great reminder that radio is an important part of the community.\"\n\nBuffalo Broadcasters: A Lifeline during Record Snow Fall\n\nDate Posted: 12/4/2014\n\nLast month, a lake-effect storm hit Buffalo, N.Y., with more than 60 inches of snow accumulation in one day. By the time the snow stopped falling, more than seven feet blanketed the area. Reports show that more than 140 people were trapped in vehicles and stranded for up to 30 hours on a 100 mile stretch of closed road. The storm claimed at least 12 lives.\n\nDuring its fall, local radio and television broadcasters provided wall-to-wall coverage, delivering critical updates on weather patterns, road closures and emergency information to local residents.\n\nFCC Commissioner Michael ORielly, a Buffalo native, praised area radio and TV stations for their coverage. \"They kept powering through the storm, committing umpteen hours of airtime, and bringing in teams from other parts of the country, making sure they had troops to get out the information,\" he said. \"I was very impressed also with their use of social media  not only were people listening and watching their broadcasts, they were also getting their information out as fast as they could on different media as best they could.\"\n\nNAB President and CEO Gordon Smith said, \"Time and again, broadcasters devote countless resources to provide vital emergency information that cant be matched by any other communications service. Broadcasters response to the unprecedented snow storms that hit upstate New York is yet another example of the dedication of local radio and television stations to serve their communities during times of need.\"\n\nLocal Broadcasters as First Informers During Oklahoma Tornadoes\n\nDate Posted: 6/7/2013\n\nLocal broadcasters saved countless lives with continuous coverage and safety information as tornadoes ravaged Oklahoma. Oklahoma Broadcasters Association President Vance Harrison told Inside Radio that he is \"proud to be a broadcaster,\" as \"the experience of the weather forecasters saved countless lives in what will be the single largest tornado in our history.\" Griffin Communications KWTV captured images of the damage via helicopter 15 minutes after the tornado passed, beating rescuers to some areas and spurring the disaster to the top of the national news. \"The live pictures and information, almost universally praised by viewers from afar who saw it online and on cable news channels, reminded some of the enduring value of local broadcasters at a time when apps and social networks tend to get more attention,\" Brian Stelter wrote in the New York Times. Oklahoma governor Mary Fallin thanked broadcasters in her post-storm press conference, saying, \"the media has done a superb job over the last couple of days of keeping people informed about the current weather conditions, especially our weathermen and those that have been on the ground driving and calling and tracking the storm itself.\" Broadcasting & Cables John Eggerton wrote that she \"essentially echoed a point that is made periodically whenever informing the public becomes not just a matter of FCC public interest obligations, but one of life and death.\"\n\nLocal Broadcasters as First Informers During Oklahoma Tornadoes\n\nDate Posted: 6/7/2013\n\nLocal broadcasters saved countless lives with continuous coverage and safety information as tornadoes ravaged Oklahoma.

To date, the company has collected more than $550,000 in funds that will support the Red Cross relief work and other disaster management experts to continue to deliver food, shelter and emotional support to those in need in Japan. Randy Hutson, CEO of Seattle Red Cross said, \"The fundraising effort launched between the Red Cross and Fisher Communications is one of the most successful Ive seen during my time with the Red Cross. The idea was created and launched within days of the disaster and the amazing work of both Fishers staff and Red Cross volunteers made it happen!

The \"drive-by\" event was held at three separate locations on one day. On-air personalities greeted and interviewed donors at their cars during the 14-hour live broadcast. The KABC Web site linked to all area Red Cross chapters and the National American Red Cross set up a special link on the KABC Web site so listeners could donate any time of day or night. Station staff gave 288 hours to the effort, which raised $4.5 million from individual and corporate sponsors for the victims of the fire. \"As the first of our media partners to recognize the immediate need to help affected families, KABC served as the catalyst to jumpstart a series of collaborative fund drives,\" said Paul Schulz , chief executive officer of the Red Cross of Greater Los Angeles, in a letter to the station. \"In addition to collecting funds, KABC played an integral role in helping us tell the Red Cross story, communicating to victims and the public.\" KABC was a National Association of Broadcasters Crystal Award Finalist in 2008.\n\nWXII-TV Provides Lifesaving Information\n\nView Video\n\nChief meteorologist Lane Pope of WXII-TV in Salem, N.C., provided viewers with lifesaving information prior to tornadoes striking in the heart of the stations viewing area. Two-and-a-half hours into broadcasting emergency weather warnings, the urgency in her voice was unmistakable. \"If youre in Clemmons, folks, this is headed for you. You need to find a safe place.\" Throughout the ordeal, WXII stayed on the air with16 hours of live severe weather coverage, which also was streamed online. As the storms passed, the stations effort shifted from forecasting to damage assessment. Even before sunrise, the WXII news team was in neighborhoods broadcasting witness accounts of what had occurred. By marshaling additional resources from nearby WYFF-TV, the station was able to bring viewers live helicopter coverage of the aftermath. While it is impossible to put a number on the lives that were potentially saved, many people in the community have contacted the station with words of appreciation for providing information that ultimately got them to safety. Both Pope and the WXII news team were recognized by the Forsyth County Commissioners for their work in the face of the crisis. The commissioners praised Pope and other first responders for \"their excellent and timely work on the evening of May 8, 2008, and the valuable role they play in protecting the lives of our citizens.\"\n\nKTTS-FM Airs Lifeline Storm Coverage\n\nWhen a storm hit the area, leaving inches of ice on power lines and 300,000 people without power for days and even weeks,KTTS-FM in Springfield, Mo., was on the air throughout the ordeal. With listeners phoning in tips, the station was able to tell listeners where to get lanterns, batteries, emergency shelter, free food, candles, firewood, propane and gas cans, as well as hotline numbers for emergency management units and electric companies. When the station began hearing of a kerosene shortage and price-gouging, KTTS partnered with locally owned Preston Oil to send a tanker filled with kerosene on the road to areas hardest hit by the storm. Carloads of listeners went to the \"kerosene caravan\" for help. In addition to sending staff to the caravan stops, the news team tirelessly worked to get information from area utility companies and emergency management teams, while station engineers struggled to keep ice off the radio towers. The on-air personalities answered hundreds of phone calls and worked by flashlight and candlelight. The lifeline provided by the station is best articulated by its listeners. \"Our twin babies and other four children huddled with us around the fireplace while we listed to your awesome up-to-date broadcasting about this storm,\" the Sawyer family wrote in a letter to the station. \"KTTS kept us going you, the on-air broadcasters, have brought listening to the radio down to an even more personal level. Thank you so much for everything you do every day as you continue to impact lives through the radio waves.\"\n\nKCSR-AM Helps Erect Monument to Firefighter\n\nRecently, KCSR-AM in Chadron, Neb., gave the proceeds raised from the \"Dawes/ Sioux County Fire Video\" they created to erect a monument to the fireman who helped keep their community safe in August 2006. The video involved a seven-month campaign, with heavy mentions during morning talk shows, press releases, anniversary news coverage, fire prevention broadcasts, online promotions and in-person talks about the stations fire coverage. Back in 2006, when temperatures reached 108 degrees with humidity in the teens, fire broke out in Kings Canyon. As evacuations began, the radio station became a lifeline for the small community that only has a weekly newspaper. \"All 12 employees at our station became news people,\" recalled station owner Dennis Brown. \"We came to work Friday morning and didnt leave until Monday night.\" The employees slept at the station, providing information around the clock. They went to each part of town to find out what people needed, then made on-air announcements and coordinated getting supplies to all areas. Photos posted on the station Web site helped the forest service get the equipment they needed sent in from another state. Although three houses were lost, there were no fatalities. \"We did our job,\" said Brown. \"And Im not afraid to brag.\"\n\nKWON-AM Provides Critical Assistance After Flood\n\nListen to Audio\n\nWhen summer rainfall totaled five times the average and resulted in record-breaking flooding, KWON-AM in Bartlesville, Okla., immediately began providing critical assistance to its town of 40,000. With homes and roads underwater, listeners needed up-to-date and immediate information. During the cresting flood waters, the news director, general manager and Web master camped out on the station floor, answering calls and providing continual updates. The station broadcast and rebroadcast road closures, emergency numbers and disaster resource information. When flood waters threatened to spilt the city in half, the KWON mobile unit parked on the side of the river opposite the studio so listeners could continue to receive news about both sides of Bartlesville. For more than a week, the Washington County Emergency Team, of which the station is a member, gathered to strategize relief efforts. The station let listeners know how to safely re-enter flooded buildings, clean up contaminated structures and where to get bottled water. Business closures and event cancellations were constantly updated. One woman said KWON broadcast information about the closure of her office before she received the corporate email. All on-air information was posted simultaneously on the station Web site, and the station produced a tutorial to help those who were not Internet savvy. KWON has earned the Oklahoma Association of Broadcasters Non-Metro Station of the Year award four out of the last seven years and believes the coverage of the flood to be its \"strongest moment.\"\n\nKAST-AM Provides Community Lifeline During Hurricane\n\nWhen hurricane-class winds slammed into the region, killing two and causing damage in excess of $25 million, KAST-AM in Astoria, Ore., provided a lifeline to its community. Two days prior, the station readied generators, set up broadcast redundancies and prepared its listeners with more than 40 hours of reporting about the storm to come. When the storm hit, KAST staff literally fought through the rain and high winds to keep the power on. The station established a 24-hour commercial-free rotation to ensure listeners would receive the latest information. As one of the few stations to remain on air, emergency response groups, government officials and public works employees all used KAST to communicate information about food, shelter, health needs, assistance and volunteer efforts. For days after the storm, the station was still broadcasting information and taking calls to help listeners learn about available aid. Weeks later, when the storms immediate effects had passed, KAST continued its storm recovery efforts by working with a local charity, The Wishing Tree. Hours of programming were dedicated to gathering food, toys and gifts to ensure children and families were still able to have Christmas after the storm. In total, KAST provided more than 285 hours of airtime to help its community prepare, survive and recover.\n\nKNOX-AM Provides Emergency Tornado Coverage\n\nWhen a devastating tornado hit the neighboring community of Northwood on August 26, 2007, KNOX-AM in Grand Forks, N.D., was on the air giving emergency information and frequent news updates through the night. After the tornado, KNOX staff traveled by helicopter to report back on the disaster area. Efforts then turned to helping the community of Northwood recover. For nearly three weeks, KNOX was on location at various community hot spots around Grand Forks and East Grand Forks with their \"Nickels for Northwood Ridgeline,\" asking listeners to throw spare change in the truck bed to raise disaster relief funds. KNOX also worked with area businesses, which donated a portion of their sales while the \"Nickels for Norwood\" vehicle was at their location. The event was supported with 500 30-second promotional spots, at least one live mention per hour each day of the relief drive, a two-hour live broadcast from each of the \"Nickels for Northwood\" locations and more than 110 staff hours. KNOX raised nearly $19,000 for the Northwood Relief Fund, one of the largest monetary donations made to the fund by a Grand Forks business. KNOX was a National Association of Broadcasters Crystal Award Finalist in 2008.\n\nKATV-TV Raises $480,000 for Tornado Relief\n\nWhen disaster strikes, KATV-TV in Little Rock, Ark., activates its \"Neighbor in Need\" relief fund to help its community recover. Through public service announcements and news stories, KATV asks viewers to extend a helping hand to those hit hardest by the crisis at hand. The station uses its phone bank facilities to collect donations. Originally created to provide aid to those affected by Hurricane Katrina who relocated to Arkansas, the fund has been activated several times since 2005 in response to severe weather. In February 2008, storms wreaked havoc across the state, and the community responded by donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to the fund. When killer twisters touched down in April 2008, viewers once again gave generously to help their fellow Arkansans, and KATV kick-started the giving with a $5,000 donation of its own. In the past year alone, more than $480,000 has been raised for the fund, all of which was given to the local Red Cross to further its efforts to provide aid to those affected by the flooding and tornadoes.\n\nWMC-TV Assist with Tornado Recovery\n\nWhen dozens of viewers homes were hit by a tornado in February 2008, WMC-TV in Memphis, Tenn., stepped up to help the families recover from the storm. The morning after the catastrophic weather, WMC launched the \"Action News 5 Helping Neighbors\" fundraiser in partnership with the Mid-South Chapter of the American Red Cross. The campaign kicked off with a day-long event at two locations close to the damaged area with live cut-ins at the top and bottom of each hour. At the event, the station also provided free weather radio programming to protect viewers from future storms, a service WMC offers to local residents year-round at the station. News coverage and public service announcements helped raise awareness about the effort and directed the community to the Red Cross phone bank to make pledges. The effort raised thousands of dollars for local victims. A short four months later, when tornadoes hit the towns of Earle, Arkansas and New Albany, Mississippi, WMC-TV quickly organized efforts again, this time holding a one-hour telethon. The live special brought viewers the very personal and human side of the story, providing firsthand accounts of the destruction and interviews with the Red Cross about what was needed for recovery. Viewers were once again directly to the Red Cross phone bank where they generously gave to their neighbors.\n\nWDSU-TV Acts as Lifeline During Hurricane Katrina\n\nWhen the devastation of Hurricane Katrina shook the residents of Louisiana, WDSU-TV in New Orleans, La., took serious measures to ensure their community was as prepared as possible for future storms. When Hurricane Gustav made its way to the Gulf Coast, the station knew what to do. In preparation for the storm and in its aftermath, the station went commercial free with their coverage. President and General Manager, Joel Vilmenay, made the call because he still has staff working for him who has been there since Katrina hit three years ago and they have memories still fresh in their minds. One of the decisions WDSU made post Katrina was to permanently establish a bureau in Baton Rouge which acts as a secondary position for the station if it is needed. Still, as a precaution, the station rebuilt its transmitter platform at 27 feet above sea level to protect it from flood damage, equipped with a generator and fuel to run it for just over two weeks without the help of outside power. They also provided their staff with satellite phones, text-capable cell phones, spare tires, first-aid kits, food and water.\n\nAlabma Stations Provides Lifeline Storm Coverage\n\nThe New York Times recognized one Birmingham station, Allbrittons WBMA-TV, for its live coverage. The local ABC affiliates veteran Meteorologist James Spann covered the mile-wide tornado as it approached his viewing area. The Times noted that following the storm Spann received hundreds of comments on his Facebook page. One viewer wrote, \"I have no doubt that you saved too many lives to count.\" New Vision Media-owned WIAT-TVs chief meteorologist Mark Prater also covered the storm for Birminghams CBS affiliate. The Times reported Prater relied on traffic cameras and other video sources to keep his viewers informed as the twister plowed through parts of Alabama.\n\nSome broadcasters used their online outlets to inform viewers. Garry Kelly, news director of Allbritton-owned WCFT-TV, the ABC affiliate in Tuscaloosa, Birmingham and Anniston said his station \"did several reports via Skype, several where our reporter was in the field and literally did a live report through smart phone.\"\n\nAs power went out throughout the region, some television stations relied on local radio stations to continue covering the tornado. TVNewsCheck interviewed Sarkes Tarzian-owned WRCB-TV Chattanoogas news director Derrall Stalvey who noted, \"When the area started losing power, we were simulcasting on our radio partner WUSY-FM. That was how most people were getting information  battery-operated. That really saved a lot of lives.\"\n\nCox Broadcastings WAGG-AM, WBHK-FM, WENN-FM and WBHJ-FM Birmingham tracked the storm and stayed on the air throughout the night providing emergency info, opening phone lines, directing rescue teams to the injured, and helping to locate missing people. Cox stations carried live press conferences from Birmingham Mayor William Bell, Gov. Robert Bentley, state FEMA officials and Alabama Power Gas company representatives.\n\nLocal broadcasters severe weather reporting was so outstanding, Rep. Spencer Bachus, (AL-06), remarked, \"I want to congratulate our TV and radio media because you saved many lives.\" Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley also relied on television broadcasts during the storm. Bentleys spokeswoman Jennifer Ardis remarked that the governor used television weather radar and live camera feeds to issue storm warnings from the emergency operations center. On May 23, Gov. Bentley signed a commendation thanking Alabama broadcasters for the extensive coverage before, during and after the outbreak of storms that swept through the state.\n\nNumerous stories from the Washington Examiner, The Wall Street Journal, Broadcasting & Cable, Radio Ink, The New York Times and TVNewsCheck discussed the influential role broadcasters played in covering the storm and assisting in the relief efforts in its wake. Additionally, a report from the Radio Television Digital News Association (RTDNA) provides a thorough summary of radio and television stations outstanding efforts across Alabama.\n\nAs communities recover and rebuild, Raycom stations in the affected areas have collectively embarked on a campaign titled Road to Recovery. Road to Recovery delivers critical information on air and online about how to find and provide disaster relief, including how to donate money, blood and other essentials to aid in recovery efforts; how to help children cope with disaster and contact information for local, state and federal agencies providing support.\n\nIn addition to providing extended news coverage WBRC-TV aired a special program to help parents talk to their kids about the disaster. The station also gave out 500 free Midland HH-50 portable weather radios to those in need and plans to distribute another thousand.\n\nMedia Generals WVTM-TV Birmingham teamed up with the United Way to host a 22-hour tornado relief telethon to support relief efforts for victims. Alabamas United Way Tornado Relief Telethon raised more than $800,000 as 200 radio and TV stations, websites and other media outlets across the U.S. supported the effort.\n\nHuntsville-based WAFF-TVs Road to Recovery Valley Volunteer-a-Thon garnered more than 100,000 hours of volunteer time. General Manager Vanessa Oubre pointed out that although many people were unable to donate money, they were more than willing to donate their time to help with recovery and cleanup efforts. \"The response to this campaign has been tremendous from our own station staff to community organizations throughout the area,\" said Oubre.\n\nIn addition to collecting nearly $300,000 for the Red Cross, WSFA-TV Montgomery partnered with Life South to collect 553 pints of blood (the equivalent of 1659 lives saved) and also raised $60,000 and more than 70,000 pounds of food for an area food bank.\n\nWJJR-FM Provides Coverage of Blackout\n\nWhen a noreaster left the area with all lights out, WJJR-FM in Rutland, Vt., provided its community a voice in the dark. The station broke from its regular format for three days, keeping the community up-to-date until power was restored to homes and businesses. The storm brought strong winds, snow and flooding, taking down thousands of trees and leaving power lines in the streets. WJJR advised listeners of drivable streets and where to get needed supplies, such as kerosene. The mayor, fire chief, police officers and utility companies gave live updates from the station and used airwaves to get safety information out to the public, such as how to avoid stepping on a live wire. Throughout the ordeal, calls came pouring in to the station. WJJRs Terry Jay took one call from a woman who needed a generator for her husbands oxygen tank. Within 40 minutes of airing the information, a listener with a generator was en route to her house bringing the power of radio into focus. \"There was not one injury, and I think we had something to do with it,\" said Jay. \"This is the reason why we got into radio in the first place.\"\n\nKOMO-TV Organizes Supply Drive After Devastating Flood\n\nWhen flooding devastated a large area in the southwest portion of the state in December 2007, KOMO-TV in Seattle, Wash., quickly organized an emergency drive. The one-day event, for which the station partnered with the Salvation Army, lasted 17 hours and brought in $180,000 in relief supplies and monetary support. During the drive, the station broadcast live from the collection site. All of its news anchors were there, unloading cars that pulled up with donations. One woman drove up with animal feed and new blankets. She said her husband had died earlier that year, and she could think of no better way to spend the money that would have purchased his birthday and Christmas present than to help those now in need. It is a moment that has stayed in the minds and hearts of KOMO staff. A week after the emergency drive, the station broadcast a 30-minute news special about the flooding. At the end of the program, KOMO shared with its viewers that there was still a great need for donations and directed them on how to give. The news special raised an additional $46,000.\n\nWAFF-TV Equips Homes with Weather Radios\n\nWith the help of WAFF-TV in Huntsville, Ala., homes throughout the northern part of the state are now equipped with weather radios. In the wake of tornados that touched down in the middle of the night in February 2008, the station made an initial donation of 200 programmed National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association weather radios to families that were affected. The station had been promoting the importance of weather radios for almost two years and knew there was still a great need, especially in rural communities. To address the issue further, WAFF recruited the University of Alabama Huntsville Meteorology Club and the National Weather Service to help set up 19 weather radio programming events throughout its viewing area. The first radio programming events were in counties hit by the tornadoes. As the WAFF 48 Storm Team arrived, people were lined up with their radios waiting. In response to these events, companies began to purchase weather radios for employees and communities began stepping up to get weather radios into the hands of all residents. WAFFs initial weather radio donation sparked an outpouring from individuals and businesses throughout the Heart of the Valley. In response, the station created the \"WAFF 48 Storm Team Weather Radio Project.\" To date, it has provided 483 weather radios to families in need.\n\nKHNL-TV and KSSK-FM Respond to Island-Wide Blackout\n\nProviding a light in the dark for residents on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, local Hawaiian television and radio stations KHNL-TV and KSSK-FM in Honolulu, Hawaii, responded to an island wide blackout. The late- December blackout not only knocked power out for residents, but also for local business, including the news stations. As KHNL dispatched news crews throughout the island to get information out to viewers on neighboring islands, KSSK radio announcers were the first to go on air at 6:30 p.m. to calm listeners, especially those listening in their cars as the immediate concern was alleviating dangerous driving situations. Additionally, KSSK took phone calls from worried listeners inquiring about the cause and duration of the blackout. KSSK simulcast its broadcast on its seven affiliated radio stations and stayed on air until power was restored at 2 a.m. the following morning. During the emergency broadcast, KSSK radio announcer Michael W. Perry told listeners, For those of you who have never been through an island-wide power outage here, we have an interesting situation in that we are an island, to restate the obvious, and we cant tap into anybody elses grid and were on our own, which means were gonna have to go for it as best we can and gradually get everything on."
