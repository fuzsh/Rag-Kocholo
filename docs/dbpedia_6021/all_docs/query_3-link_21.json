The station's transmitter building and multi tower directional array were located on a 26-acre tract of land on U.S. Highway 60, just west of the Owensboro city limits. The station operated at 1420 kc with 1,000 watts of power. The following year WVJS-FM went on the air at 96.1 mc.\n\nThe stations were owned and operated by Owensboro on the Air, Incorporated. Owensboro developer Vincent J. Steele was majority owner. Owensboro radio veteran Malcolm Greep, who was a driving force in starting WVJS, was named general manager of the new station.\n\nIn early 1960, WVJS closed its downtown studios on Allen St and consolidated all of its operations at the company's transmitting site on Highway 60.
