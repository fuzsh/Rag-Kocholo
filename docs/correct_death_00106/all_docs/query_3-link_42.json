As any fan will know, these short films marked the official comeback of Arbuckle as a performer, having been able to find work only as a director in the years following the infamous scandal that ruined in career in 1921. By the time Vitaphone became interested in him, ten years later, silent films belonged to the past, and Roscoe had to synchronize his slapstick style to dialogue and sound effects. All in all, he did the transition very well; his strong voice suits his character perfectly, and the dialogue is rather functional, as it never takes too much focus away from the slapstick-routines which were Roscoe's specialty (Buster Keaton suffered much more in this regard at MGM during these years). BUZZIN' AROUND provides little truly extraordinary, perhaps, but at least ranks among the average comedy shorts of the time. This film is also of some particular interest as it teams up again Roscoe with his real-life nephew Al St. John; the two had appeared together in numerous films during the silent era, St. John usually playing \"the villain.\" Here, however, the two are on quite good terms. And while it must be assumed that Roscoe's brilliant Luke the Dog had sadly passed away by this time, the dog Pete (known from Our Gang-comedies) is also quite clever and charming.\n\n\n\nIn the film, Roscoe appears as Cornelius, a boy from a farm whose big ambition in life is to become an inventor. He receives words that a company is interested in his most recent triumph; a liquid which makes all objects unbreakable, including the most expensive ming vase. As our hero excitedly leaves the farm for the city in order to perform a demonstration, he happens to bring along a jar of moonshine rather than the invention. Several unexpected problems occur on his way; he is attacked by bees, one of which he manages to swallow, and later on wrecks a stranger's car by accident. I choose not to reveal much more, other than that expensive glass and vases are much present in the culmination of this mayhem. You've seen it before in some other form, and there is certainly not much refinement to be found here. Even so, the crudeness in the humor seldom comes off as overly cartoonish, much due to Roscoe's presence; he appears just \"human\" enough as a character for us to care about him. Although a bit older, he is just as charming as in his heyday; the cleverness with objects which was often reflected in his silent films is also present here. Only the \"buzzing\" itself, when a doctor tries to allure the bee out again from Roscoe's mouth, seems a bit over-done to me (though it's quite funny up to a point).\n\n\n\nApparently, BUZZIN' AROUND was the last film Arbuckle appeared in to be released before his death in June, 1933, though he did manage to make three more after this one. The comeback which these short films marked was long overdue and sadly turned out to be all too brief. But I am certainly glad Roscoe Arbuckle did make these; having been deprived of his performing career when it was at its peak, he could in the end call himself a \"true comedian\" again.
