    "text": "Chris Farley's Dream Project Was A Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle Biopic\n\nOn a recent episode of the \"Fly on the Wall\" podcast, comedian Chris Rock talked about watching the Safdie brothers' film \"Uncut Gems\" and being incredibly impressed by Adam Sandler's performance. Rock was also made incredibly melancholy, however, as he immediately began to think of the later actor/comedian Chris Farley. Rock felt that, had Farley survived, he would have eventually had the opportunity to reveal his own dramatic acting chops, something Farley was never able to display in his film career prior. Rock and Farley both began performing on \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1990, and they both rose to fame rapidly. Farley, however, wrestled with addiction and health problems for many years, and died of an overdose in 1997. He was 33.\n\nFarley's death hit the world of comedy hard, and many of his friends and co-workers have come out over the years to say what a kind, shy, decent guy Farley was. His passing led to speculation over where his career would have gone, and the kinds of feature films he might have made into his 40s and 50s. Example: An old animatic, found online, revealed that Farley was to have voiced the main character in \"Shrek\" in the 2001 DreamWorks animated film, a role that would have most assuredly been a boon to his career.\n\nIn the 2008 book \"The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts,\" authors Tanner Colby and Tom Farley (the subject's brother) recalled a time when Farley had the opportunity to star in a movie that could have potentially put him on the path toward drama. In 1997, Farley was put into contact with star screenwriter David Mamet to work on a biographical film about famed silent-era comedian Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle."
