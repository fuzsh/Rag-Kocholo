    "text": "History Guy tells of Kansas-born comedian's career collapse\n\nKansas-born Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle became a famous actor and comedian in silent films more than a century ago, but saw his career collapse amid unsubstantiated allegations of rape and manslaughter.\n\nThis week's History Guy video at CJOnline.com tells about how Arbuckle will be the focus of a program beginning 6:30 p.m. Friday, Sept. 13, at the Kansas Museum of History, 6425 S.W. 6th Ave.\n\nAttorney and historian Mark Hull of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth will give a \"Museum After Hours\" presentation about \"The Many Trials of Fatty Arbuckle,\" according to the website of the Kansas State Historical Society.\n\nArbuckle was born in 1887 at Smith Center in north-central Kansas. He moved with his parents as a small child to California, where by 1920 he had become one of the highest-paid stars in the budding medium of silent films.\n\nBut 26-year-old actress Virginia Rappe fell ill in 1921 during a party that Arbuckle, who was married, was hosting at a hotel in San Francisco.\n\nRappe, who had a history of promiscuity and heavy drinking, died four days later from peritonitis, an abdominal condition caused by a ruptured bladder.\n\nBambina Maude Delmont, a friend of Rappe's who had also been at the party, alleged Arbuckle had raped Rappe.\n\nAuthorities contended the impact of Arbuckle's overweight body lying atop Rappe had caused her bladder to rupture.\n\nArbuckle was tried three times for manslaughter, with the first two trials ending in hung juries. The third jury acquitted him and issued a formal written statement of apology.\n\nEven though he had been exonerated, the scandal ruined Arbuckle's career.\n\nHe attempted a comeback in 1932 but died of a heart attack on June 29, 1933.\n\nThe Topeka Daily Capital reported the next day: \"The plump, jolly 'Fatty,' who became an exile from the movies after his acquittal in the mysterious death of Virginia Rappe, screen actress, died in his sleep of a heart attack. He was 45 years old. Only a few hours earlier he had signed a contract with Warner Brothers that meant his permanent return to the screen.\""
