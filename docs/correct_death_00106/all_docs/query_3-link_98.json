    "text": "JACK BE NIMBLE\n\nThe Accidental Education of an Unintentional Director\n\nBy Jack O’Brien\n\nFarrar, Straus & Giroux, $35.\n\n\n\nYou might not know it from his memoir, but O’Brien is a major player in New York theater. His three best-director Tony Awards (for “Hairspray,” “Henry IV” and “The Coast of Utopia”) prove his versatility too. But most of this gracefully written book is about his early days, and the influence of the temperamental actor-­director Ellis Rabb and the preternaturally talented actress Rosemary Harris, who was Rabb’s wife in the 1960s. Some scenes are quite personal, even invasive, but O’Brien’s admiration for both comes through.\n\nBorn in Saginaw, Mich., he entered the University of Michigan, whose campus “roared with unimaginable sophistication,” in 1957. Coastal snobs may smile, but it was in Ann Arbor that O’Brien, now 74, conceived his dream (to become a lyricist) and met the people who led him to his true theatrical calling.\n\nImage\n\nHe got in on the ground floor of the Association of Producing Artists, which became the A.P.A.-Phoenix Repertory Company and burst like a supernova on Broadway in the ’60s. O’Brien reminds us that working in American theater then, you could easily cross paths with the likes of Helen Hayes and Eva Le Gallienne."
