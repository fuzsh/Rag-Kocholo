Arbuckle was about five years older than Al and was in vaudeville and California theater in the early 1900s. His movie career began around 1913 and he became one of the major silent film comedians. Frequent co-stars and featured players in his one and two-reel shorts included Mabel Normand, Buster Keaton, and Arbuckle's nephew, Al St. John.\n\n\n\nIn 1921 - 1922, 'Fatty' was arrested and tried for the rape and death of actress Virginia Rappe at a September, 1921 party at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco. There were three trials. The first two had hung juries, and he was acquitted of all charges in trial number three.\n\n\n\nBut he couldn't escape the sensationalized reporting and the resulting scandal and his movie career was destroyed.\n\n\n\nUsing the pseudonym of \"William Goodrich\", Arbuckle did some directing in the 1920s, including several of Al St. John's starring shorts.\n\n\n\nIn the early 1930s, 'Fatty' made a comeback in a half dozen shorts for Warners / Vitaphone and Al appeared in one.\n\n\n\nArbuckle passed away from a heart attack on June 29, 1933 in New York City.\n\n\"PRINCESS THEATER - 'The $50,000 Beauty' with Vera Blair Stanley in the title role is merry melodious musical melange to be presented by the Princess musical comedy company next week. The company has been supplemented by the addition of Alfred St. Johns [sic], a pleasing juvenile.\"\n\nHow did Al wind up at the Princess Theater? Uncle Roscoe Arbuckle was at the Princess doing both acting and producing chores and his wife Minta Durfee was a member of the theater company.\n\nAl's first movie appearance was circa 1913 in comedies at the Mack Sennett studio where 'Fatty' was employed.\n\n\n\nArbuckle, St. John, and many others were members of Sennett's chaotic Keystone Cops. And when 'Fatty' starred in his own comedies, Al was often in the cast and sometimes worked production jobs. When Al registered for the World War I draft in 1917, he was in New York City with Arbuckle's Comique Film Company.\n\n\n\nThere was a large crowd of silent film comedians and major stars included Arbuckle, Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, Mabel Normand, and Laurel and Hardy. Trailin' after the big name comics were many lesser but popular funny men ... and Al St. John was in that bunch. From about 1919 - early 1930s, he starred in scores of silent and early sound comedies for Warners, Paramount, Fox, Pathe, and Educational Pictures. Most were two-reel shorts and released on the independent market. Al even wrote stories and directed many. He also did some support / character parts in features including two 1928 sagebrushers with Tom Mix at Fox.\n\n\n\nHe was slight of build, about 5 feet 6 inches tall and 150 pounds, and his comedic style was slapstick, pratfalls, acrobatics, facial mugging, and wizardry on a bicycle and unicycle.\n\n\n\nFollowing are reports from the trades that provide a timeline from 1916 through the early 1930s. Included are salary figures which I've highlighted in THIS color. Take those money amounts with a grain of salt.\n\nMay 13, 1916 Motography : \"Al St. John, who started out as one of the original Keystone police, and established the traditions of this unique force, has jumped into the headlines and will be starred in the next Triangle comedy made at the eastern studios of the corporation.

William Brandt, president of the Motion Picture Theater Owners of New York State, blamed the high costs on salaries paid to stars, directors and supporting players. And Brandt identified a bunch of Hollywood stars and their WEEKLY salary.

Article excerpt: \"Work has begun at the Paramount New York studios of a series of four two-reel comedies in which Al St. John will be starred.\"\n\nBuster Keaton recalled his Keystone Cops days and wrote about Al doing falls and tumbles in the book My Wonderful World of Slapstick (Doubleday, 1960; by Buster Keaton with Charles Samuels):\n\n\"Even more astonishing to me was discovering how few of them knew the first thing about taking a fall. The ex-Keystone Cop, Al St. John, for example, worked side by side with Roscoe (Arbuckle) for five years without learning one damn thing about protecting himself in a fall. As an old trip-and-tumble expert myself I advised St. John to use elbow pads, something he had never heard of until then. He had been using his hands and elbows each time to break his falls. The result was that he was continually suffering ...\"\n\nAl tied the knot with Marion Lillian Ball (1891 - 1975) on October 5, 1914 in Los Angeles, and daughter Mary Jane (1918 - 1994) was born October 9, 1918. Citing cruelty and alcohol abuse, Lillian divorced him in August, 1923 and their split was plagued by never-ending battles over missed alimony and child support payments. Trades and newspapers carried many reports of Al's court appearances and threats of jail time due to those missing payments. On a later webpage, you'll find more on those legal squabbles.\n\n\n\nIn 1926, Al married June Price Pierce and they were together through her passing in 1957. Her full / maiden name was Yvonne June Villon (1901 - 1957), and she was an actress and dabbled in real estate. Al was husband number three and June brought along her son, Raymond Beach Price (1919 - 1981). Their marriage ceremony was at June's home in Cahuenga Park, California. Attending the nuptials were about 200 guests, mostly Hollywood movie folks, and 'Fatty' Arbuckle and his wife were witnesses. Al had purchased two and a half acres adjoining the house and plans were to add a swimming pool, tennis court, garden area, more.\n\n\n\nThe 1920s were Al's peak years in prestige and earnings. There were big paydays, but his lifestyle was lavish, and money flowed out for real estate, cars, a plane ... and alimony and child support:\n\nIn the early 1920s with first wife Marion, they had a full time cook and butler and Marion had a full time chauffeur.\n\nSeptember 16, 1922 Camera! magazine: \"Al St. John and a company of seven slipped away from the Fox studios and journeyed up to the Sierra Mountains and fished and hunted in the hills. All voted Al a prince of a good fellow - it was he that footed the expenses for the trip.\"\n\nCirca 1923, Al and a syndicate of Los Angeles business men were buying city and farm properties and a recent purchase was an eighty acre tract of land that once was a gold claim.\n\nFebruary 3, 1923 Camera! magazine: \"Al is an enthusiastic aviator and recently purchased a Pacific bi-plane in San Diego.\"\n\nFebruary 9, 1923 Film Daily : \"Hollywood - Al St. John, Tom Mix and William Russell are the owners of a new haberdashery recently opened here.\"\n\nMay 19, 1923 Camera! magazine: \"Two brand new McFarland [sic] motor cars have been added to the Al St. John string of 'speed buggies'.\" ; \"... throwing custard pies and making monkeyshines pays big!
