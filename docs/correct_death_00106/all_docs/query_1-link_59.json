        "text": "Saddle Pals & Sidekicks\n\n(From Old Corral collection)Al 'Fuzzy' St. John\n\nFull name: Alfred St. John\n\n1892 - 1963\n\nFans of the B western remember Al 'Fuzzy' St. John as one of the best sidekicks ... and a very funny guy. His real life was full of twists and turns, successes and failures, and negatives included alcohol abuse, lots of money problems, and a messy divorce. A popular star of silent comedies, Al's career sputtered out when talkies arrived and he found himself relegated to vaudeville and bit / character roles in movies. By the mid to late 1930s, Al concentrated on B westerns and began his transformation into a comic saddle pal named \"Fuzzy\".\n\nAlfred St. John was born September 10, 1892 in Santa Ana, California to Nora Nell Arbuckle St. John (1871 - 1960) and Walter St. John (1851 - 1939). In the early 1890s, the family resided in Santa Ana, then briefly settled in Pomona, California, and were in Los Angeles when the 1910 census was taken. Father Walter hailed from Ohio, and in the census, his occupations were \"farm laborer\" and \"Contractor - House Builder\". Mother Nora was the sister of comedy film star Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle (1887 - 1933).\n\nAl's introduction to acting and the movie business was due to that Arbuckle family connection. And the close relationship between Al and his uncle continued through 'Fatty's' death in 1933. More on 'Fatty' in the info box on the right.\n\nIn the 1910 census, the occupation of 17 year old Alfred St. John is \"Actor - Theater\". And the stage career of teenager Al is confirmed in the May 8, 1910 issue of the Los Angeles Herald newspaper at the Library of Congress website:\n\n\"PRINCESS THEATER - 'The $50,000 Beauty' with Vera Blair Stanley in the title role is merry melodious musical melange to be presented by the Princess musical comedy company next week. The company has been supplemented by the addition of Alfred St. Johns [sic], a pleasing juvenile.\"\n\nHow did Al wind up at the Princess Theater? Uncle Roscoe Arbuckle was at the Princess doing both acting and producing chores and his wife Minta Durfee was a member of the theater company.\n\nAl's first movie appearance was circa 1913 in comedies at the Mack Sennett studio where 'Fatty' was employed.\n\nArbuckle, St. John, and many others were members of Sennett's chaotic Keystone Cops. And when 'Fatty' starred in his own comedies, Al was often in the cast and sometimes worked production jobs. When Al registered for the World War I draft in 1917, he was in New York City with Arbuckle's Comique Film Company.\n\nThere was a large crowd of silent film comedians and major stars included Arbuckle, Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, Mabel Normand, and Laurel and Hardy. Trailin' after the big name comics were many lesser but popular funny men ... and Al St. John was in that bunch. From about 1919 - early 1930s, he starred in scores of silent and early sound comedies for Warners, Paramount, Fox, Pathe, and Educational Pictures. Most were two-reel shorts and released on the independent market. Al even wrote stories and directed many. He also did some support / character parts in features including two 1928 sagebrushers with Tom Mix at Fox.\n\nHe was slight of build, about 5 feet 6 inches tall and 150 pounds, and his comedic style was slapstick, pratfalls, acrobatics, facial mugging, and wizardry on a bicycle and unicycle.\n\nFollowing are reports from the trades that provide a timeline from 1916 through the early 1930s. Included are salary figures which I've highlighted in THIS color. Take those money amounts with a grain of salt.\n\nMay 13, 1916 Motography: \"Al St. John, who started out as one of the original Keystone police, and established the traditions of this unique force, has jumped into the headlines and will be starred in the next Triangle comedy made at the eastern studios of the corporation. Roscoe Arbuckle will direct the new production and Alice Lake will play the leading feminine role.\" (This film was the Triangle - Keystone comedy THE MOONSHINERS.)\n\nOctober 28, 1916 Motion Picture News: \"Roscoe Arbuckle, Keystone comedian and director, is to leave Mack Sennett's organization when his present contract expires on the first of the year ...\" ; \"After January 1 he is to produce comedies ... under the brand name of Comique. Al St. John, who has been appearing with Mr. Arbuckle in Keystone comedies for the past year, will be a member of the company.\"\n\nJuly 30, 1919 Clipper: \"Al St. John, who has been appearing with Fatty Arbuckle in his comedies, is to be started in a series of two-reel comedies by Famous Players - Lasky, under a contract just closed by Warner Brothers. The firm is to be known as Al St. John Comedies ...\"\n\nAugust 9, 1919 issue of Exhibitors Herald and Motography: \"Al St. John, side partner of 'Fatty' Arbuckle for the last three years, has been signed by Warner Brothers for five years, and will be starred in a series of picture comedies, to be released through Famous Players - Lasky Corporation.\" ; \"St. John's Warner contract, it is understood, will net him in the neighborhood of $250,000 a year. His salary with Keystone, six years ago, was $75 a week.\"\n\nMarch 13, 1920 Moving Picture World had a blurb about Warner Brothers releasing the Al St. John comedies on the independent market. They had previously been released by Famous Players - Lasky (Paramount).\n\nMarch 20, 1920 issue of Moving Picture World: \"Making out his income tax recalled to Al St. John that five years ago he was earning - and working hard for the money - $3 a day at the carpenter trade. Now he is a screen celebrity contracted to draw $50,000 in 1920.\"\n\nNovember 8, 1920 Film Daily: \"Al St. John is now with the Fox sunshine comedy forces. He will direct and also appear in pictures.\"\n\nAugust 18, 1923 issue of Camera! magazine: \"Al St. John has been presented with keys of the city of Santa Ana, his own home town, for the week when the Orange County fair is in session there this fall.\"\n\nThe October 30, 1923 Film Daily and November 17, 1923 Exhibitors Herald had a lengthy story on escalating rental and production costs impacting the exhibitors. William Brandt, president of the Motion Picture Theater Owners of New York State, blamed the high costs on salaries paid to stars, directors and supporting players. And Brandt identified a bunch of Hollywood stars and their WEEKLY salary. Included were: Tom Mix ($4000.00/week); Gloria Swanson ($6500.00/week); and Al St. John ($1000.00/week).\n\nJune 28, 1924 Exhibitors Trade Review: \"Al St. John's contract with Fox Sunshine Comedies having expired, he has signed to appear in Tuxedo Comedies for Educational release.\"\n\nJune 19, 1926 Moving Picture World: \"Al St. John Re-Signed By Educational ...\"\n\nFebruary 11, 1928 Motion Picture News: \"Al St. John, Educational comedian whose career ... dates back to the early Sennett days, has been cast for a role in 'The Painted Post', a new Fox Films western starring Tom Mix.\"\n\nDecember 21, 1929 Exhibitors Herald-World: \"AL ST. JOHN has completed the role of master of ceremonies in issue number 12 of Screen Snapshots. Ralph Staub is directing the series for Columbia release.\"\n\nJanuary 27, 1930 Film Daily - Headline: \"Al St. John's Sound Debut\". Article excerpt: \"Al St. John marks his debut in sound talking comedies by appearing in 'Western Knights' for Educational.\"\n\nApril 9, 1930 Variety: \"Al St. John has replaced Redmond Wells in Pathe shorts, opposite Jimmy Aubrey.\"\n\nApril 15, 1930 Film Daily: \"Al St. John has been signed by Pathe for a role in 'Two Eggs,' a short to be directed by Monte Carter.\"\n\nOctober 16, 1930 Film Daily: \"Lloyd Hamilton and Al St. John will appear together in the next Educational-Hamilton comedy ...\"\n\nOctober 17, 1930 Exhibitors Daily Review and Motion Pictures Today: \"Al St. John, after completing a role in 'The Land of Missing Men', was engaged for a part in Al Rogell's latest Tiffany special, 'Aloha', now in production.\"\n\nAugust 15, 1931 Motion Picture Herald had news of Educational's plans for new comedy shorts: \"Four new series will make their debuts, with 'Honeymoon Trio,' co-featuring Walter Catlett and Al St. John, introducing the Cameo comedy group on Aug. 30 (1931).\"\n\nSeptember 6, 1931 Film Daily - Headline: \"Al St. John to Make 4 Two-Reelers for Para.\". Article excerpt: \"Work has begun at the Paramount New York studios of a series of four two-reel comedies in which Al St. John will be starred.\"\n\nBuster Keaton recalled his Keystone Cops days and wrote about Al doing falls and tumbles in the book My Wonderful World of Slapstick (Doubleday, 1960; by Buster Keaton with Charles Samuels):\n\n\"Even more astonishing to me was discovering how few of them knew the first thing about taking a fall. The ex-Keystone Cop, Al St. John, for example, worked side by side with Roscoe (Arbuckle) for five years without learning one damn thing about protecting himself in a fall. As an old trip-and-tumble expert myself I advised St. John to use elbow pads, something he had never heard of until then. He had been using his hands and elbows each time to break his falls. The result was that he was continually suffering ...\"\n\nAl tied the knot with Marion Lillian Ball (1891 - 1975) on October 5, 1914 in Los Angeles, and daughter Mary Jane (1918 - 1994) was born October 9, 1918. Citing cruelty and alcohol abuse, Lillian divorced him in August, 1923 and their split was plagued by never-ending battles over missed alimony and child support payments. Trades and newspapers carried many reports of Al's court appearances and threats of jail time due to those missing payments. On a later webpage, you'll find more on those legal squabbles.\n\nIn 1926, Al married June Price Pierce and they were together through her passing in 1957. Her full / maiden name was Yvonne June Villon (1901 - 1957), and she was an actress and dabbled in real estate. Al was husband number three and June brought along her son, Raymond Beach Price (1919 - 1981). Their marriage ceremony was at June's home in Cahuenga Park, California. Attending the nuptials were about 200 guests, mostly Hollywood movie folks, and 'Fatty' Arbuckle and his wife were witnesses. Al had purchased two and a half acres adjoining the house and plans were to add a swimming pool, tennis court, garden area, more.\n\nThe 1920s were Al's peak years in prestige and earnings. There were big paydays, but his lifestyle was lavish, and money flowed out for real estate, cars, a plane ... and alimony and child support:\n\nIn the early 1920s with first wife Marion, they had a full time cook and butler and Marion had a full time chauffeur.\n\nSeptember 16, 1922 Camera! magazine: \"Al St. John and a company of seven slipped away from the Fox studios and journeyed up to the Sierra Mountains and fished and hunted in the hills. All voted Al a prince of a good fellow - it was he that footed the expenses for the trip.\"\n\nCirca 1923, Al and a syndicate of Los Angeles business men were buying city and farm properties and a recent purchase was an eighty acre tract of land that once was a gold claim.\n\nFebruary 3, 1923 Camera! magazine: \"Al is an enthusiastic aviator and recently purchased a Pacific bi-plane in San Diego.\"\n\nFebruary 9, 1923 Film Daily: \"Hollywood - Al St. John, Tom Mix and William Russell are the owners of a new haberdashery recently opened here.\"\n\nMay 19, 1923 Camera! magazine: \"Two brand new McFarland [sic] motor cars have been added to the Al St. John string of 'speed buggies'.\" ; \"... throwing custard pies and making monkeyshines pays big! St. John now owns nine motors and one aeroplane.\""
