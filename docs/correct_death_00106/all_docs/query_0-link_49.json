Uncle Ben, as he was affectionately called, had been ill for at least four months and his death was not unexpected. Members of his family sought to persuade him to undergo an operation recently while he was a patient in the Methodist hospital in Hattiesburg, but he refused and asked to be taken home, saying that he had no more than 20 days left to live. He died on the 19th day following that statement. That brings back to memory the story his late wife, Mrs. Elzara Slade Tyner, told at their 50th wedding anniversary. She said he refused to consent to a big wedding and later confessed to her that he felt their wedding must conform to a dream he had. Mr. Tyner was the last member of a family of eleven children born to Pierce and Elizabeth Lowe Tyner, of near Columbia, Miss.\n\n.....He was a member of the First Baptist Church in Purvis and he was also a charter member of the Purvis Lodge No. 434, F. & A. M. and was the last of the original group of members. The lodge conducted Masonic rites at the graveside Wednesday following religious services. The funeral services were held in the home of his daughter, Mrs. B. M. Stone, in Purvis with the Rev. Henry W. Shirley, pastor of the First Baptist church officiating. Rev. Troy Sumrall, of Hattiesburg assisted Rev. Shirley as he brought the message from God's word of hope. Interment was in the Tyner family cemetery four miles east of Purvis.\n\n.....Mr. Tyner was born September 25, 1866, in what was then Marion county. He and Miss Slade were married February 24, 1889, and lived all of their wedded life within four miles of their original home. He was a highly respected citizen of Lamar county and his passing marks again the changes that come to the county as the years pass, and old citizens turn the reins over to young men and women.\n\n.....Besides Mrs. Stone, Mr. Tyner is survived by another daughter, Mrs. Eva Ladner, and by four sons, Weldon H. Tyner of Hattiesburg, Charles, Fred and Virgil Tyner of Purvis. There are 18 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.\n\n.....A daughter, Mrs. R. Q. Nelson of Red Bay, Ala., died the latter part of 1950.\n\n.....Pallbearers, all brother masons were: F. L. Moorehead, Odell F. Miller, W. P. Moorehead, W. E. Stewart, J. O. Bond and V. D.

TYNER BURIED Another home was made sorrowful, another family has its ties broken, another community mourns the loss of one of its best and beloved women. The spring boughs were bending with their fresh green foliage. The woods about were sweet with the fragrance of the new spring flowers. The breezes of the forest were laden with sweet smells of the forest, and the birds were sitting silent, it seems, on last Thursday, May 21st, when gentle hands administered the last rites, by laying away back to mother earth, the body of sister Florence Lott Tyner, who died about 2 o'clock in the morning. Sister Tyner was born Oct. 7th, 1872, near Sandy Hook, this county. She was married to brother H. E. Tyner, Dec, 1899, and to whom were born nine children, one of whom died in infancy. In passing away, she leaves to mourn her going the following: Mrs. Oscar Miller, P. B. Tyner, Mrs. Robert Prine, Eddie Jr., Marvin, Jessie Lee, Rex, and Florence, and brother H. E. Tyner, her husband and her father. Sister Tyner was indeed a good woman and surely there with the Maker of all, the Giver of all and the Taker of all, she has found that place where there is no pain, like that which she suffered here before her going. The funeral was conducted by her assistant pastor, brother E. B. Flurry, assisted by W. B. Waldrop, a long-time friend of the family, and by whom this is written. May the sting of sorrow in her loss become the power of spiritual help, from Him whom to trust in life eternal. I am sure that sister Tyner could say it with the Poet, \"Sun set and evening star, one clear called to Me, let there be no weeping at the bar when I put out to sea.\" Written by a friend of the family, W. B. Waldrop.Info by: Shirley Fortenberry Ramshur.\n\n581A.
