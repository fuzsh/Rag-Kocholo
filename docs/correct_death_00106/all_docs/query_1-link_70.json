    "text": "TemplateData\n\nTemplateData is a way to store information about template parameters (the description of those and of the whole template) for both humans and machines. It is used by VisualEditor and possibly other tools like Upload Wizard.\n\nExisting template documentation\n\nAt Wikimedia Commons, it is recommended to use {{TemplateBox}} with either ‎useTemplateData=1 or ‎useTemplateData=only on the ‎/doc subpage and transcluding it with {{Documentation}} into the template. ‎<nowiki> -tags can be wrapped around the arguments, if required, to avoid templates being expanded.\n\nNewly created template documentation and imports\n\nAnother option, especially for imported templates, or for users with JSON experience, is placing raw ‎<templatedata> -tags into the Wikitext of the template, as described in various Wikipediae.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThere is an ongoing discussion about that matter. Feel invited to comment if you are experienced in either way, your time permits and if you like to share your opinion or to make a suggestion.\n\nWikipedia's help about TemplateData • Commons-specific information"
