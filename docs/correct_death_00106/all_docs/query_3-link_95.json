        "text": "http://www.busterkeaton.com/Films/A02_The_Rough_House.html\n\nWatch THE ROUGH HOUSE in the link above.\n\nThe second film starring Roscoe Arbuckle and co-starring Buster Keaton is the first written or directed by Buster, and he did both! It's been almost 100 years (this June) since then!\n\nThis short really features what Roscoe Arbuckle was best suited: poise when facing disaster with an ineffective solution to the problem creating a larger disaster. We see this twice, both involving fire. The roll dance was uninspiring and much better by Curly Howard later. Slapping mashed potatoes on the \"duke's\" head as toupeé paste was fantastic. Roscoe is just awesome.\n\nThe highlight of this film is the battle between Al St. John and Buster Keaton, with a grimace-worthy moment when Buster tosses a knife that lands in St. John's mouth. They together do a great interpretation of the Keystone Cops, noting Umbrella Sam's post...\n\nI've mentioned before that I'm not a big fan of the Keystone style of humor, but one exception to that is the Keystone Kops. I've just always been a big fan of their wacky antics and how energetic they could be and we get the pleasure of seeing Keaton and Al St. John basically playing Keystone Kops (I know they're not technically Keystone Kops, but they're still pretty similar). Every scene with them as policemen is fantastic to watch from the falls and backflips they do to the gag of them appearing and disappearing out of nowhere.\n\nAl St. John and Roscoe Arbuckle were Keystone Cops prior to joining Comique, so this is not coincidence. And the results are hilarious.\n\nThe falls are done well here, and the timing is impeccable. The female cast is a bit wooden and not really fearsome as they are supposed to be. The dukes are also not great. We have three legends and a bunch of slop to go with it. It's going uphill fast here!\n\n9/10\n\nPersonally, I thought this was an improvement over THE BUTCHER BOY, as this one was more consistently funny throughout, though I will say that the fight in this one between Keaton and Al St. John goes on for way too long and seeing Keaton throw a knife in Al's mouth is kind of uncomfortable. The fight in THE BUTCHER BOY built up to Keaton and Al St. John on top of the shelves throwing the store items at each other, but this one doesn't really ever go anywhere, as they just kind of chase each other throughout the house. Otherwise, though, this short was better.\n\nI've mentioned before that I'm not a big fan of the Keystone style of humor, but one exception to that is the Keystone Kops. I've just always been a big fan of their wacky antics and how energetic they could be and we get the pleasure of seeing Keaton and Al St. John basically playing Keystone Kops (I know they're not technically Keystone Kops, but they're still pretty similar). Every scene with them as policemen is fantastic to watch from the falls and backflips they do to the gag of them appearing and disappearing out of nowhere.\n\nArbuckle has his moments as well. There's a particularly funny scene in the beginning where he just casually tries to put out a fire by walking to the kitchen and filling cups with water. He also gets to take part in a gun fight in the end that is a much more satisfying conclusion than the one in THE BUTCHER BOY with Al and his minions being scared of Luke the dog.\n\nWe also get the dancing food gag that would later become famous in Charlie Chaplin's THE GOLD RUSH. I've always been neutral to this gag, so I can't really say much more about it, as I never really found it funny.\n\nSo, overall, I liked this short. It's not perfect as Arbuckle is still doing roughhouse humor and it's not super funny, but it's definitely a step in the right direction.\n\n7 out of 10\n\n(This has nothing to do with my review, but I found on the Wikipedia page for this short that this is Buster's first writing credit, his first director credit, and the first time he was put in a starring role. On to the review.)\n\nTHE ROUGH HOUSE is a bit of a strange film to review in terms of its pacing. I feel like it never really reaches a climax, never really has a sense of finality, but that's quite alright because of the sheer funniness of the film and genuine thought that goes into the gags.\n\nWhile Buster really doesn't get a lot to do in the film compared to THE BUTCHER BOY, Roscoe Arbuckle really takes the cake as the cook. The first scene with him attempting to put out a fire in his house is just great. He gets a little dinky water source to try and put the fire out but then wonders why the fire isn't going away. His reactions really make the scene what it is. The over-exaggerated reactions from the rest of the cast in this scene really amount to nothing, but Arbuckle's Stan Laurel-like way of thinking in this scene make it good.\n\nNow, there is quite a big slapstick scene in this one and it goes on for a good 4 minutes which is quite a long time. It's no BUTCHER BOY pie and flour fight, but it is quite good. You can see that Buster is perfecting the mannerisms and reactions that would make him a highly respected comic. If you read my review of THE BUTCHER BOY, then you know my thoughts on Al St. John. He's just a traditional silent comic and his reactions never do much to me, and that's how this scene feels to me. Another highlight of the fight is Roscoe's reactions to when food gets thrown at him because he doesn't know how or why this is happening to him.\n\nAfter this slapstick fight, Buster and Al throw some flour at a cop who then demands that for these actions, Buster and Al have to either do their time in jail or become a part of the police force. They choose the latter, which results in some Keystone Kop-esque comedy. There is a funny gag during one of the cop scenes where they appear out of thin air due to the police commissioner's requests.\n\nMeanwhile, Roscoe has some neat gags as a cook that never really amount to much, and then there's some big chase scene where there's a funny gag with Buster but that's pretty much the highlight. Then, the short is over. While there are quite a few good gags in this, and the inventiveness shows off, the \"climax\" and \"finale\" don't really do much to the overall short. I'm going to give this an equal rating of my review for THE BUTCHER BOY:\n\n7/10\n\nTHE ROUGH HOUSE is a bit of a strange film to review in terms of its pacing. I feel like it never really reaches a climax, never really has a sense of finality, but that's quite alright because of the sheer funniness of the film and genuine thought that goes into the gags.\n\nI agree, this one feels unfocused and shapeless. A series of barely connected scenes, most of them ramped up to full chaos. I'd already watched the first two shorts in the Keaton shorts blu-ray collection when Paul announced he'd be reviewing these shorts next, so I decided to put my viewing on hold and watch them as they got reviewed, including rewatching BUTCHER BOY and ROUGH HOUSE when the time came. While I had a pretty good recollection of BUTCHER BOY before my second viewing, I honestly couldn't remember a thing about ROUGH HOUSE till I started watching it again. It's such a formless mess structurally that the whole thing just washed over me the first time.\n\nI found Fatty kind of annoying in the scene where he's serving the guests at dinner. Wreaking deliberate mayhem at the dinner table would work better if it were Harpo Marx (whose character is all about mayhem for mayhem's sake) or Stan Laurel (whose dull ineptitude would be a more believable basis for the mishaps). But Arbuckle's deliberate sabotaging of the dinner party (pulling off toupees, slapping people in the head with soup sponges, etc.) and chuckling at the camera with each mishap didn't sit well with his hapless, only slightly dim nice guy persona. Made him come across as a brat.\n\nThe best parts here are the stunts. That synchronized forward flip by the three cops (including Keaton) over the edge of the hill was so spectacular I had to rewind it and take it in again. It's hard to imagine a time when there were so many comedians willing and able to do that kind of dangerous stunt work for a laugh. And I loved the moment when Keaton, for no reason at all, executes a rapid back-flip outside the police station, clocking a man in the face with his boot during his mid-air rotation.\n\nNot sure where I'd rank this one relative to BUTCHER BOY. There's nothing in this one that I enjoyed as much as the first half of BB, but it's more dynamic and satisfying than BB's tedious second half.\n\nTo be honest, I kind of doubt that this was Keaton's first directorial effort. I know Wikipedia says that he co-wrote and co-directed, but there's no source and it says he only co-wrote and co-directed that one short and none of the other Arbuckles. It seems odd that Arbuckle would only have him co-direct that one short. Also, the booklet in the new Buster Keaton shorts blu-ray only credits Arbuckle as director.\n\nI do believe that as time went along, Keaton did gradually become Arbuckle's co-director as Arbuckle began to sort of phase out of the knockabout style of humor he was used to. However, I think this short was just a little too early for Arbuckle to fully trust him with co-directing. I may be wrong, though, as there might be a source out there that confirms his involvement behind the scenes.\n\nEspecially considering it was only Keaton's second film appearance!"
