    "text": "I have been hoping for a coherent and somewhat balanced book on this particular topic for a very long time, and thank goodness this one was well researched and thought out. This case has interested me since I was a kid--I first came across Roscoe Arbuckle in the saddest of places--Hollywood Babylon--that book fascinated and repelled me for as long as I can remember. As a kid I could not possibly have known it's origins and falsehoods, only pictures of the movie stars that I already adored and some gore and nudity (interesting to most kids when forbidden) and the fact that any adult I knew that had a copy, kept it hidden like a dirty magazine (which it pretty much is).\n\nI will not repeat the infamous story of Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle's supposed crimes (the story is quite easy to read up on--even truthful versions) and interestingly after all these years still contains mystery. Most folks who know old Hollywood know that Roscoe was a silent film comedy pioneer--he worked with Chaplin (and preceded Chaplin) as well as Buster Keaton (his dear friend) and one of my personal favorites, Mabel Normand. His image is still well known today, but many would have trouble putting a name to it. This is not only because he most famous for silent film, many others including Chaplin are extremely well known despite the passage of time. Roscoe was the subject of not one but three of the most tainted and publicity filled trials ever known in the U.S.\n\nThe basic facts are that he was holding a party in San Francisco with some male friends and several females (mostly acquaintances) in a very ritzy hotel and in the course of the party, the designer and model and actress Virginia Rappe was taken ill and never recovered. She passed away several days after the party from a ruptured bladder. One of the women in the party (an acquaintance of Rappe's)accused Roscoe Arbuckle of being the cause of Rappe's illness. This lead to a trial on par with the O.J. Simpson case or the Michael Jackson cases. Tons of publicity, fans taking sides and lies and innuendo flying. The basic accusation was that Arbuckle injured Rappe either by squashing her while attempting sex or injured her by another means. She had a distended bladder and it ruptured--that much everyone seems to agree on. Arbuckle went through 3 trials--2 hung juries and finally acquittal, but he was never completely forgiven and was ostracized by most of Hollywood. As with most cases of this type, there is so much mystery and only two people knew the truth--the dead girl and Arbuckle. The author gives us a brief but well done bio of both Rappe and Arbuckle and then an in-depth look at all of the trials as well as Arbuckle's life after and how the case took on a life of it's own, even many years down the line.\n\nThere have been many attempts to rehab Arbuckle's reputation and sadly most of those have included terrible slurs against Rappe which the author is able to debunk pretty well. I applaud him for this, for while I do not believe Arbuckle committed a crime, I also don't think that Rappe deserves to be dragged through the mud for things that others did and for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. She was an interesting person and well known in her own right for quite sometime before this case. It's very sad that everything she did in her short life comes down to her death.\n\nThe true villains of the piece seem to be a woman knows as \"the avenger\", Maude Delmont an attendee at the party and acquaintance of Rappe who turned the case into her own very loud and attention grabbing show. Hollywood was already coming under scrutiny for it's wild ways (compared to rest of the U.S., it was pretty wild but nothing like your average citizen might dream up) and this case was a powder keg. So much that happened in each of the trials would have resulted in mistrial that anyone familiar with crime would be hollering(as I was) while reading the tragically farcical case. It is laid out with great detail and balanced with the background of Prohibition, the power of Christian and women's groups at the time and the increasing power of Hollywood and film in the U.S.\n\nArbuckle's life post trials is explored and the author does a step by step analysis of the evidence of all 3 trials to come up with his own conclusions (some of which I agree with) and lays the blame for the sadly repeated lies mostly at the door of Hollywood Babylon (where it belongs) and the lies about Rappe at the door of Arbuckle's first wife and some of his overzealous defenders. He does a good job of this.\n\nI will add as my own opinion that I do not believe that as heavy as Arbuckle was, (around 266 pounds at the time of Rappe's death) even if he was to lie on top of a woman that he would be heavy enough to pop her bladder, distended or not. I suspect that a 34 year old man who had been heavy his whole life would have known how to have sex with a woman without squashing her by this point. There was no evidence that sex even occurred so I cannot really agree with this idea--I think there are many possibilities but even with all that we know now that we did not know then, it's still truly a mystery. What does seem clear is that two people had their names smeared for attending a party, drinking too much and perhaps acting a bit outlandish. In the end, neither deserved their terrible fates."
