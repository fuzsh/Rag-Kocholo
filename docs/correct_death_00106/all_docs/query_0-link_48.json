W. B. Nowland and Araminta (Carroll)Nowland [1]\n\nLucille is enumerated in the 1900 U.S. Census with her father Captain Nowland, her mother Mintie, her brother Edward, his wife Mary J., their son Edward the 3rd, her sister Hattie C., and a servant at 140 Adams Street in Memphis, Tennessee.[2]\n\nShe was baptized at St. Peter's Church in Memphis, on 7 Mar 1903. [3]\n\nLucille and her family were still living at 140 Adams Street (known as Millionaire's Row in Memphis and is now the site of the Victorian Village [4] She is listed in the Memphis City Directory along with her family. [5]\n\nShe married Alfred Louis Semnacher on July 9, 1904 in Memphis. [6]\n\nTogether they became the parents of Alfred Louis Semnacher, Carroll Spencer Semnacher, and Gordon C. Semnacher.\n\nIn 1910, Alfred and Lucille were enumerated on Figueroa Street in Los Angeles with sons, Alfred and Carroll (tho the census taker butchered poor Carroll's name as Ara S.!) and a servant. Their last name was rendered \"Slimacher\" by the census taker or the transcriptionist. Alfred was employed as a salesman and Lucille was teaching piano. [7]\n\nLucille filed for divorce on December 10th, 1910 in Los Angeles, California [8] and later remarried Alfred on July 9th, 1911 in San Francisco, California. [9]\n\nIn 1920, the couple were enumerated In Los Angeles on South Ardmore. Al was working as a publicity manager for a film company. [10]\n\nThey would again divorce on March 15th, 1922. Much was made about this second divorce because of the \"Fatty\" Arbuckle scandal of 1921, of which Al was a part. It hit more than a few newspapers around the country. A Carroll Fleming was the other party. Supposedly Carroll was an actor who posed as a ex-millioniare, racer, boxer, aviator, champion shipyard riveter and a former British officer.[11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16]\n\nAl would die on the 9th of March of the following year of a heart attack.\n\nBefore her 2nd divorce from Alfred was final, Lucille became pregnant with her fourth child, this time by Edward Carter. Per an email received from the daughter of Lucille and Edward's daughter, Janet, Edward Carter was supposedly a member of the English Aristocracy (The Duke of Northumberland) who didn't get along with his family. He left the family to join the RAF in WW1. He was sickened by mustard gas in the war and had health problems related to that. Lucille met him while nursing him from his health problems and they fell in love. Edward was supposed to have been at the infamous Labor Day party where \"Fatty\" Arcbuckle was accused of murdering Virginia Rappe, an actress whose manager was Alfred Semnacher, Lucille's husband. Edward didn't want to be called to testify so he fled to Canada. Interesting enough, the story some tell is that Al went to San Francisco to find a reason to divorce Lucille!\n\nLucille divorced Alfred, or rather Al divorced Lucille, and went to San Francisco to give birth to Janet. Janet was left in the care of the Catholic Orphange, went to Canada, married Edward Carter and then returned to San Francisco to take her daughter. [17] It is believed that Edward Carter was the Carroll Fleming mentioned in the news articles. It is interesting to note that Edward's mother's maiden name was Fleming. Coincidence?\n\nLucille and Edward raised Janet in Ventura and Santa Monica. Lucille was a studio manager and announcer for the radio station KFVD, of Venice. She was the first female studio manager and announcer! She assumed the non-de-plume of Mary Elizabeth Carter and was so named in the Outlook edition of Apr 21st 1927 which listed the passing of her father, Captain E. W. B. Nowland. [18]\n\nLucille and Edward are living in Ventura, California On North Ventura Ave with their daughter Janet in 1930. [19]\n\nThey moved to Glendale, California from Santa Monica where they lived in 1935. Edward had been out of work for 200 weeks and is now working as a concrete foreman for a building construction firm. [20]\n\nShe married Clarence Gunning on April 15th, 1958 at St. Joseph's Church in Santa Anna, California. [3]\n\nLucille died 7 May 1969 in Los Angeles, California.

The father had died and the reason she and her sister were removed from their home is unclear. The mother might have turned to prostitution. In 1901, Mrs. E.W.B. Nowland and her daughter, Miss Hattie went to the orphan's home (Leath Orphanage) and took my grandmother out. She lived with the Nowlands on Adams Street fora year or two. Mother loved them very much and always seemed to have a secret desire that they were in some way related. I would like to know anything about this family. The youngest Nowland child lived at home. Her name was Miss Lucille. She played the piano on her father's riverboats and she was about fifteen or sixteen when Grandmother went to live at their home. There was also a son named Edward Jr. and another named Eugene. I believe they also had a son named Will and daughter named Mary who were older and married at that time. I know that Eugene directed movies associated with Thomas Edison's company. Anything that could help me on my quest for information would be appreciated. My grandmother's name in the orphanage was Dora Lowry, but she thought her real name was Nora LaRae. The Nowlands changed her name to Nora Lawson. Then a few years later, Grandmother's name was once again changed, this time to Mary Agnes Lawson. That was the name on her marriage certificate. She always said that her father had been a fisherman named John or George.\n\nSource: Ko-Woon Anonymous Ko-woon, sung by Laura Millard Note: Personality - Laura Millard, Lucile Nowland Semnacher Song Name - Ko-woon Music - Lucille Semnacher Lyrics - Anonymous Year - 1917 Other Info: Laura Millard was a vaudeville and Broadway actress who specialized in exotic roles. As early as 1889 she had appeared in leading roles requiring her to wear kimono and by 1899 was appearing on Broadway in the Mikado as Yum-Yum (the female lead). I have been unable-to find any later references to her after 1917. Lucille Nowland Semnacher was a classical piano accompanist, in great demand for recitals by opera stars and who appeared yearly in the Chatauqua Cultural Festivals in Chatauqua, NY. Semnacher was originally from Memphis, TN and the daughter of a steamboat captain. She was married to Al Semnacher, who became famous in 1921 as the manager of Virginia Rappe, the Hollywood starlet that Fatty Arbuckle was (falsely)accused of murdering. (Associated with the sheet of music was a picture of Lucille Nowland Semnacher, the same photo associated with the brochure about Gage Christopher, Baritone)\n\nNewspaper Clipping (Identified Los Angeles Times:1916: Eleven Publication: Los Angeles: Los Angeles Times, Nov 12, 1916 Mrs. Alfred Semancher yesterday afternoon entertained at the family home, 1333 (?)

Repository: #R137 Italicized:\n\nSource: Email 11 July 2010 from Cathy Erickson re Edward Carter Cathy Erickson Dear Cindy, My mother told me about growing up in Ventura and Santa Monica where her parents had a radio show broadcast from the pier. My mother loved her mother and father deeply, and it sounds like she had a very close relationship with her father Edward, who died when she was in her 20's. When I read your account of Lucille's life with her husband Al, and the information on Carol Flemin, I thought the characterization of Flemin and stories of my grandfather Edward Carter have much in common. Since she married Ed Carter soon after those events took place, I wonder if Flemin and Carter is the same person. The 20's were a crazy time. Who knows?That is the story that I have been told. I met my uncle Al when I was a child. We went to his house and had dinner with his wife and children. I never met my other uncles, but they knew my mother. Did your mother know anything about my mother? It looks like Gordon was only 11 or 12 when Lucille left. I thought he was older. I looked at information online on Al Semnacher and it showed his year of death as 1923. Is that so? Who raised Gordon? He must have had very bad memories of all these events. I'm going to go get the pictures to scan and send them to you. Cathy. Note: Looked for Edward Carter in connection with the Dukes of Northumberland and the family name associated with the Dukes is the Percys. Carol Fleming was the \"actor\" named in the newspapers in connection with the divorce and according to IMDB there is a Carrol Flemming who was a director in 1914. Lucille was going by the name of Mary Elizabeth Carter during the radio broadcast and was the first female station manager for the radio station.\n\nNewspaper Clipping (Not Identi Church Brings New Organist Noted Artist to be at St. Paul's, Announcement Mrs. Edmund D.
