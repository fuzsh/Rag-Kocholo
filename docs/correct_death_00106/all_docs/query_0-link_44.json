        "text": "Tag: Foster\n\nD-I-V-O-R-C-E : Sarah Jane Foster vs John W. Clonch\n\nIt’s a complicated story\n\nJohn W. CLONCH married Sarah Jane FOSTER on 20 February 1862 in Gallia County, Ohio. A judge of the Probate Court of Gallia County issued the marriage license. They were joined in marriage by Robert WORH, a justice of the peace. The marriage record does not include the names of parents.\n\nTheir first child, a son William Alexander was born on 2 October 1862. A year and a half later, about April 1864, a daughter was born. By this time the marriage was already in trouble and divorce was the next step for Sarah.\n\nThis post includes the chancery records found by Ralph L. Hayes in Mason County’s courthouse over two decades ago. He was kind enough to share them with me and gave me permission to use them.\n\nDramatis personae\n\nThese are the persons who played a part in the chancery case Sarah Jane FOSTER vs John W. CLONCH in 1864:\n\nSarah Jane FOSTER , age of 21, married John W. CLONCH also 21 on 20 February 1862. She was the plaintiff (oratrix) in this case.\n\nJohn W. CLONCH , the oldest son of William CLONCH and Mary E. DOSS, and husband of Sarah Jane FOSTER . They married in Gallia County, Ohio. He was the defendant in this cause.\n\nJohn W. FOSTER assumed to be the father (or brother) of Sarah Jane and seen as the next friend in this cause.\n\nSarah DEWITT, a young lady of about 24 years who was questioned as a witness.\n\nPeter DEWITT, a man of 36 years who was questioned as a witness.\n\nWilliam Alexander CLONCH, the two-year-old son of John W. and Sarah J.\n\nLavinia PATTERSON, also known as Lavinia DOSS (her mother’s surname) and Lavinia CLONCH (her father’s surname). She was a sister of John W. and Alexander and wife of James William PATTERSON. She was a witness.\n\nRebecca LEMASTER, sister of Mary Ellen CLONCH. She was one of the persons implicated in the questioning of the witnesses.\n\nMary Ellen CLONCH née LEMASTER, the wife of Alexander CLONCH. She was no longer living with him and having an affair with John W. CLONCH.\n\nAlexander CLONCH, the second son of William CLONCH and Mary E. DOSS. He married Mary Ellen LEMASTER on 10 November 1863. He is not named in the proceedings but referred to as the husband of Mary Ellen.\n\nWilliam CLONCH and Mary E. DOSS, parents of John, Alexander, and Lavinia. They were never married and their children were known by both surnames.\n\nJames DEWITT and Rebecca ATKINSON, parents of Sarah and Peter who were witnesses. It was at their house in the Clendenin township that some incidents took place.\n\nIudex, advocatus, et notarius publicus\n\nThe judge, lawyer, and public notary who were mentioned in the proceedings.\n\nDaniel Haymond POSLEY (1803-1877) was a judge of the seventh judicial circuit of West Virginia. Before this chancery case, he was the Lieutenant Governor of the Restored Government of Virginia (the Unionist government of Virginia during the Civil War) until two weeks before West Virginia became a state. After this chancery case, he would go on to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1866, serving from 1867 to 1869. Mr. Polsley was the judge for this case.\n\nBenjamin J. REDMOND was a Notary Public born in 1840. During the war between the States, Mr. REDMOND served the government as provost marshal of Mason County. After this chancery case, from 1868-1870, he served as a justice in the Robinson district followed by four years as president of the Mason County court.\n\nWilliam H. TOMLINSON, an attorney at law who questioned the witnesses for the plaintiff.\n\nJoseph S. MACHIN, a Notary Public for the county and state and a Master Commissioner for Chancery for the County of Mason.\n\nVinculo matrimonii\n\nThe Chancery Records concerning the divorce of Sarah Jane CLONCH from John W CLONCH.\n\nTo the Honorable Daniel Polsley Judge of the Circuit Court for Mason County Humbly complaining thereto unto your Honor your oratrix Sarah J.

Clonch\n\nvs\n\nJohnW.Clonch\n\nThis cause came on this day to be heard upon the bill, the exhibits filed and examination of Witnesses and was argued by counsel for the Plaintiff on consideration whereof the court being of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief prayed for: doth adjudge order and decree that the marriage heretofore Solemnized between Sarah J. Clonch and John W. Clonch be and the same is hereby dissolved and the said Sarah J. Clonch is forever divorced from her husband the said John W. Clonch: and it is further ordered and decreed that the complainant is entitled to the care and custody of the infant children in the bill mentioned and that the said John W. Clonch do Surrender up the said William A. Clonch to the care and custody of the said Sarah J. Clonch, and that the plaintiff recover from the defendant her costs by her expended in the prosecution of the suit.\n\nAt the March term of 1865, Sarah J. CLONCH returned to court to have her son William A. CLONCH surrendered to her by his father John W. CLONCH.\n\nOn Motion of Sarah J. Clonch and for reasons appearing to the Court it is ordered that John W. Clonch be summoned to appear here on the first day of the next term to shew cause if any he can [illegible] he shall not be find (sic, fined) and attached for refusing to surrender William A. Clonch his infant child to the custody of its mother in pursuance of a decree of this court rendered at the September term then of 1864.\n\nSarah J. FOSTER and her son William A. CLONCH\n\nFollowing the divorce from John W. CLONCH, Sarah disappeared without a trace – at least in the census and records available. Her daughter remains unnamed. Her son William Alexander CLONCH was missing in the 1870 and 1880 census. He did not live with his father. Was he living with his mother who may have remarried?\n\nIn any event, the son William A. CLONCH married twice. First to Ellen FOWLER and second to his first cousin Emma Sidosa LEMASTER (also known as CLONCH). The marriage records do not include the names of parents. Emma was the daughter of Rebecca LEMASTER and Alexander CLONCH. He died in 1925 and left a will naming his wife Emma as his only heir. On the death record, his parents were listed as John Wm CLONCH and Sarah FORRESTER (sic).\n\nJohn William CLONCH\n\nFollowing the divorce of Sarah and John, Alexander CLONCH and Mary Ellen LEMASTER separated. They had been married less than a year and did not have children. They were not divorced until March 1880.\n\nMary Ellen (still married to Alex) went to live with the newly divorced John W. CLONCH. They had thirteen children between 1865 and 1892. Finally on 7 May 1895 John, 54, and Mary Ellen, 47, married in Gallia County, Ohio.\n\nIn the name of all CLONCH descendants, I would like to thank Ralph L. Hayes for ferreting out the records to back up this CLONCH family story. It sounded fantastic and a bit unbelievable but the records he found in the old dusty unindexed boxes in the courthouse backed it up. How many more stories are hidden away, waiting for someone to tell them?\n\n© 2019, copyright Cathy Meder-Dempsey. All rights reserved.\n\nGathering Records to Tell the Story – An Update\n\nLess than two hours after I posted Gathering Records to Tell the Story in late February my fourth cousin Ralph L. Hayes sent emails with images of the Chancery records for the 1864 divorce of John William CLONCH and Sarah Jane FOSTER – records which are not online.\n\nCousin Bait!\n\nI was surprised and happy to finally see the records he had discovered years ago when he searched through old dusty unindexed boxes at the courthouse in Point Pleasant, West Virginia.\n\nIn Gathering Records to Tell the Story, I shared the entry in the court records concerning the divorce of my 2nd great-grandfather Alexander CLONCH from his first wife Mary Ellen LEMASTER. I’d only recently found this record and could not wait to share with my cousins who descend from the CLONCH line.\n\nBy sharing what I’d found I may have been subconsciously baiting cousins. Don’t we do this all the time? Sharing bits and pieces in hopes of a relative coming forward with new information. I wasn’t expecting Ralph to message me via Facebook so soon after I’d published the post. We hadn’t done email in 15 years but have been keeping up with each other via Facebook for 10 years.\n\nIt’s a complicated story\n\nJohn W. CLONCH married Sarah Jane FOSTER on 20 February 1862 in Gallia County, Ohio. Many residents of Mason County crossed the Ohio River and state line to marry in Gallia. If Sarah Jane carried her first child to full term, she may have been with child when they married. Their son William Alexander was born on 2 October 1862. A year and a half later, about April 1864, a daughter was born to John and Sarah. By this time the marriage was already in trouble and divorce was the next step for Sarah.\n\nI found a couple of entries in the Chancery orders and in a fee book concerning the divorce in 1864 when I located my ancestor Alex’s 1880 divorce records. My mentioning the 1864 documents in Ralph’s possession were not yet online pushed him to get in touch and email them to me.\n\nIn the meantime…\n\nI’ve been a bit slow working on the documents as other things have kept me busy during the past few weeks.\n\nI watched several of the 2019 RootsTech live sessions and got caught up in the DNA whirlwind caused by Ancestry and MyHeritage’s new tools. I’ve used up all 24 of the colors offered for grouping matches in the New & Improved DNA Matches (Beta). I’ve played with MyTreeTags on the small tree linked to the test I manage on Ancestry and found they are an excellent new tool for tree management. ThruLines™ is still aggravating me. They have a known problem with step-parents being considered as the ancestor. MyHeritage’s Theory of Family Relativity did not take long to look at as only 29 matches were offered. Several were spot-on. Several were not. Their AutoClustering was a bit disappointing as I was already spoiled by Jonathan Brecher and his Shared Clustering tool.\n\nRalph said, “Go for it!” In the days to come, I’ll share the transcriptions of the records he sent from the chancery case Sarah Jane Clonch vs John W. Clonch.\n\n© 2019, copyright Cathy Meder-Dempsey. All rights reserved.\n\nGathering Records to Tell the Story\n\nThe stories passed down by descendants who have researched the CLONCH family history are fantastic and a bit unbelievable. Ralph L. Hayes heard of the scandals which went on in the family and shared the stories in mailing lists and genealogy forums on the internet nearly two decades ago. Being a good researcher, Ralph went to the courthouse in Point Pleasant in Mason County, West Virginia, to ferret out the records to back up the family history. He found the divorce of his 3rd great-grandfather “only by going through some OLD dusty unindexed boxes in the courthouse.”\n\nSeeking Documentation\n\nI’ve wanted to find the documents Ralph discovered as the story of the CLONCH brothers is so difficult to believe. Since FamilySearch has added more collections from Mason County to their online records, I’ve been looking for this and that record to better tell the story.\n\nRalph L. Hayes is my fourth cousin. He descends from John William CLONCH (1840-1919) and Mary Ellen LEMASTER (1847-1921) while I descend from Alexander CLONCH (1842-1910) and Tabitha Ann COOLEY (1861-1913). John and Alex were the sons of our 3rd great-grandparents William CLONCH (1807-1863) and Mary E. “Polly” DOSS (c. 1816-c. 1892).\n\nIf you’ve been following recent posts about William CLONCH’s estate, you’ll have learned William and Mary were not married but had eight children, seven grew to adulthood and married, six had children. William kept the family together beyond the grave by leaving a will in which he stipulated the land the family lived on was to remain in the family. Did he know at the time of his death in 1863 that his two oldest sons would become part of an incredible story equal to a primetime soap opera?\n\nI wrote A Little “Peyton Place” (Part I) and A Little “Peyton Place” (Part II) in December 2013 but the posts only recount what Ralph learned while researching and don’t include documentation.\n\nLiving overseas and nowhere near the American courthouses of the counties my ancestors lived in, I must rely on record collections found online. FamilySearch’s catalog is my go-to place whenever researching and gathering records to tell their stories.\n\nTwo Marriages\n\nJohn W. CLONCH married Sarah Jane FOSTER on 20 February 1862 in Gallia County, Ohio, across the Ohio River from Mason County.\n\nAlexander CLONCH married Mary Ellen LEMASTER on 10 November 1863, also in Gallia County.\n\nTwo Divorces\n\nNeither of the marriages lasted. In the September Court of 1864 John and Sarah were divorced. The records of the circuit court in which Ralph found more details are not yet online but I found another mention a few pages further in the Chancery orders and in a fee book. [Click on over to the links in the citations below to learn why this divorce produced more records.]\n\nAlexander and Mary Ellen never had children even though by 1880 they were legally married a little over seventeen years. To be more precise, they never had children with each other. Alex’s brother John and Mary Ellen had eight children between 1865-1880 and Alex had 3 children with Mary Ellen’s sister Rebecca from 1868-1876. Many online trees list Rebecca LEMASTER as Alex’s second wife. A marriage record was not found in West Virginia or Ohio. Is it possible they were married and the record has yet to be found?\n\nI think not. Alexander was still married to Mary Ellen LEMASTER when her sister Rebecca gave him three children. Alex and Mary Ellen’s marriage was not dissolved until the March term on 1880, when the divorce was mentioned in the Chancery orders.\n\nMarch term 1880\n\nAlexander Clonch\n\nvs In Chancery\n\nMary E. Clonch\n\nThis cause come on this day to be heard upon the bill, exhibits and depositions filed therewith and the process having been duly served upon the defendant and she still failing to appear answer or demur to plaintiffs bill and the cause set-for hearing and was argued by counsel on consideration of all which the court is of the opinion that the\n\nplaintiff is entitled to the relief prayed for in his said bill, it is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed that the marriage heretofore solemnized between the plaintiff and defendant be dissolved and annulled and the plaintiff forever divorced from his said wife from the bonds of matrimony and that she be forever barred of dower in any lands the plaintiff had or now has or hereafter has and the plaintiff recover from the defendant his costs including a fee of ten dollars as prescribed by law in and about his suit in this behalf expended and that execution issue therefor & c.\n\nImportance of the Records\n\nWhy was finding this record so important to me? Five months after the above divorce, on 19 August 1880, Alexander CLONCH married Tabitha Ann COOLEY, my great-great-grandmother. They were the parents of nine children, six of whom married and had children, including my great-grandmother Rebecca Jane CLONCH (1888-1950). Also with the above record I have proof for the part of the story which goes:\n\nThe marriage was dissolved, Mary did not appear and she does not get her dower and must pay costs.\n\nOne document at a time, the complete story may one day be told.\n\nGenealogy Sketch\n\nName: Alexander CLONCH\n\nParents: William CLONCH and Mary E. “Polly” DOSS\n\nSpouse: Tabitha Ann “Tobitha” COOLEY\n\nParents of Spouse: John COOLEY and Sarah Ann TREADWAY\n\nWhereabouts: Mason and Fayette, West Virginia\n\nRelationship to Cathy Meder-Dempsey: 2nd great-grandfather\n\n1.

Eight of them were born during his marriage to his first wife Phebe. Following her tragic death the winter of 1793/1794 he married Elizabeth COTTON in 1796. With Elizabeth he also had eight children. The second youngest was their son Dryden who was born about 1818, the year Nicholas County was formed from Kanawha County.\n\nThe 1820 U.S. Federal Census\n\nIn 1820 Dryden was in the household of his father James SIMS. At the time he was James’ youngest child.

Rebecca was born in Giles County, Virginia, on 28 November 1819. The marriage took place in Fayette County on 18 October 1837. Records of birth and marriage have not been found to confirm these dates. Rebecca may have been born in a part of Giles County which became Fayette County. A part of Giles went to Logan when the county was formed in 1824 and a part of Logan became Fayette County in 1831. Thomas BAYS was enumerated in Logan in 1830 and in Fayette from 1840 until 1860.\n\nDryden and Rebecca had one son born following their marriage and before the 1840 census. Dryden had several other children in his household. As all of the census listings of the children of his father James SIMS have been worked through, I have made this assumption concerning these extra children. Two of the orphaned children of Dryden’s sister Sarah may have been taken in by him and his wife, namely Mariah FOSTER and James FOSTER who did not fit in any other SIMS household.\n\n1840 U.S. Federal Census\n\nNicholas County, (West) Virginia\n\nSheet 9, Line 30\n\nEnumeration Date: 1 June 1840\n\nName: Dryden Sims\n\nFree White Persons – Males – Under 5: 1 (Alfred)\n\nFree White Persons – Males – 5 thru 9: 1 (not a son, may be Sarah’s son James)\n\nFree White Persons – Males – 20 thru 29: 1 (Dryden)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – 5 thru 9: 1 (not a daughter)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – 10 thru 14: 1 (not a daughter, may be Sarah’s daughter Mariah)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – 15 thru 19: 1 (Rebecca)\n\nPersons Employed in Agriculture: 1\n\nFree White Persons – Under 20: 5\n\nFree White Persons – 20 thru 49: 1\n\nTotal Free White Persons: 6\n\nTotal All Persons – Free White, Free Colored, Slaves: 6\n\nThe 1850 U.S. Federal Census\n\nDuring the 1840s Dryden and Rebecca had four more sons. Dryden was a farmer but did not own land. In his household was a single man named Paschal HENDRICK (ca. 1816-1883) who owned land. Were Dryden and his family living on and working his land?\n\nNext door to Dryden was his nephew Jonathan SIMS, son of his half-brother William, and in the next household was his sister Jane SIMS, wife of Joseph DARLINGTON.\n\n1850 U.S. Federal Census\n\nNicholas County, Virginia\n\nThe 43rd District\n\nSheet No. 371A, Line 23-29, HH #412-412\n\nDryden Sims 32 M W Farmer Virginia\n\nRebecca Sims 30 F W Virginia\n\nAlfred Sims 11 M W Virginia\n\nWilliam Sims 8 M W Virginia\n\nAndrew Sims 6 M W Virginia\n\nAlexander Sims 3 M W Virginia\n\nThos Sims 8/12 M W Virginia\n\nPascal Hendrick 34 M W Farmer $400 Virginia\n\nThe 1860 U.S. Federal Census\n\nDryden and Rebecca lost their son Thomas born in 1849 during the 1850s. Two daughters and a son were born by the time the 1860 census was taken. The son was only two months and listed as Lenard M., the same name as the head of the next household, Lenard MORRIS. The name of the child appears to be incorrect as will be seen in later census listings.

Mariah, who likely grew up with Alfred, had married Jordan HUDSON in 1846, lived in Missouri for a short time before returning to the Fayette/Nicholas counties area where two children were born before Jordan’s death. Alfred and Mariah’s first child Alfonso Graves was born very close to the date of marriage as his age was given as 63 years when he died in September 1920. He was with Alfred, Mariah, and her two HUDSON children in Nicholas County in 1860.\n\nThe 1870 U.S. Federal Census\n\nThe 1860s brought much change to the family of Dryden SIMS.\n\nThe second son William Henry Harrison SIMS married Sabina Hester McCARTY about 1861. The groom was seen in most records as William H. H. however records have been found with the middle names Henry and Harrison which led to the conclusion that he was named after William Henry Harrison (1773-1841) the ninth President of the United States who served the shortest tenure in presidential history to date. The couple had four children by 1870 and was living in Kanawha County.\n\nThe third son Andrew Jackson “Jack” SIMS married Virginia A. Sintilla MORRIS in 1865. She was the daughter of Lenard MORRIS, a neighbor in 1860, and seen as Cynthia on that census listing. They had one son and were living next door to William H. H.\n\nThe oldest daughter Mary Jane SIMS married Charles Marvin MORRIS in 1866. They had a son and daughter and were living a couple of households away from her oldest brother Alfred. Her husband Charles was the first cousin of Jack’s wife.\n\nThe oldest son Alfred Hansford SIMS‘ family had increased to six children. They were living in Nicholas County close to his sister Mary Jane.\n\nDryden and Rebecca had moved to St. Clair County, Missouri, with their remaining unmarried children before the 1870 census. John Alexander, their fourth son was at home with no occupation listed even though he was 22 years old. Nancy Elizabeth was fourteen and did not attend school unlike her brother Thomas Newton who was attending. Thomas would be the child seen as Lenard M. in the 1860 census obviously named after his deceased brother Thomas who shared the name with their maternal grandfather. Thomas was born 11 April 1860 per his grave marker – a match for the two-month-old son on the 1860 census.\n\n1870 U. S.

H. was now the father of seven and still living close to his brother Andrew Jackson in Elk District of Kanawha County. Jack was the father of four. Mary Jane was living in Jefferson District of Nicholas County and the mother of five children.\n\nJohn Alexander who at the age of 22 was without occupation in 1870 likely died in Roscoe, St. Clair County, Missouri on 1 March 1873. Likely because a cemetery listing for the Roscoe Cemetery shows John A. SIMS son of D. and R. died 1 March 1873 at the age of 4 years. I suspect the grave marker may have been difficult to read and the age should be 24 years. The Find A Grave memorial does not include a photo of the marker and birth is listed on the memorial is 27 May 1868. I cannot access the original RootsWeb page which had the cemetery reading for John Sims in the Roscoe Cemetery and cannot trust the unsourced Find A Grave information.\n\nThe youngest of Dryden’s children, Thomas Newton SIMS was not located in the 1880 census. Per descendants of this line, he married Margaret Ann BOUDINIER on 15 March 1878 in Appleton City in St. Clair County, Missouri. No known children were born to this couple before the 1880 census.\n\nThe Years After the 1880 Census\n\nIn The Matter of Dryden SIMMS Estate, J. W. WHEELER named Thomas SIMS and Lizzie KING (daughter of Dryden) as the heirs on 12 May 1881, a full year after the 1880 census in which his wife was listed as a widow. WHEELER was appointed the administrator of the estate as Dryden had not left a will. There was no mention of the children who had remained in West Virginia when Dryden removed to Missouri in the late 1860s.\n\nJohn W. WHEELER was unable to find any property of any character whatever belonging to the estate and it was ordered that he be discharged of his duties on Friday, August 18th, 1882.\n\nAlfred Hansford SIMS, who appeared to be deceased at the time of the 1880 census turned up in Buchanan County, Virginia when he married Marinda Magdaline VANCE on 1 August 1898. Alfred was 59 and Rinda was 17. They had one son George William SIMS (1899-1942). In June 1901 during the flood on the Dismal River near Whitewood, Virginia, Rinda who was pregnant with her second child went out to grab clothes from the line when a falling tree hit and killed her and her baby. After the Dismal River flood Alfred moved from Buchanan County to Paynesville on top of Bradshaw Mountain in the Sandy River District of McDowell County, West Virginia. He died soon after and was buried in Vance Cemetery at Paynesville. His son was raised by the VANCE grandparents, Alexander and Betty Harmon Vance.\n\nWilliam H. H. SIMS continued to live in Kanawha County with his wife Sabina with whom he had seven children.\n\nThis photo of William and Sabena needs to be dated more precisely. Circa 1890 is the year Ron gave when he shared the picture with me over sixteen years ago.\n\nAll of William and Sabena’s children married and only one did not have children. After Sabina’s death in 1911, William was found living with his granddaughter Minnie Rebecca VANDAL and her husband John H. ORD in 1920 in Clendenin, Mason County, West Virginia. He died in Kanawha City in 1921 at the age of 78.\n\nAndrew Jackson SIMS, father of four, was widowed in 1887 and remarried twice more. First in 1888 to Celia BROWN. She gave him a son who died in 1890 at the age of 1 year. Celia died the following year. About a year later he married Mary Savannah KEITH who gave him four more children. The two oldest died the same day at the age of 4 and 6 in 1899. Jack died in 1915 at the age of 70 in Clay County where he had lived since his second marriage.\n\nMary Jane SIMS and Charles Marvin MORRIS were the parents of seven children, six living. Mary Jane was likely divorced from Charles before 1886 when she was seen marrying Ebenezer MILAM. Charles Marvin MORRIS died 31 March 1889; his death was reported by his step-mother Rhoda DARLINGTON, widow of William B. MORRIS and daughter of Dryden’s sister Jane SIMS. Mary Jane had four children with her second husband before being widowed in 1906. In 1910 she married her first husband’s first cousin Hillary Jones MORRIS, a son of Lenard MORRIS mentioned earlier. The marriage did not last as Hillary was seen marrying again in 1918 with his marital status being divorced. Mary Jane went back to using MILAM, her second husband’s surname. She died in 1936 shortly before her 85th birthday in Charleston, Kanawha County.\n\nNancy Elizabeth SIMS had ten children, eight of whom were living in 1900. Nancy died before the 1910 census, likely between 1904-1906. Her husband Andrew Jackson KING was found in the 1910 census but not in 1920 or 1930. He died in 1936 in Roscoe, St. Clair County, Missouri per his death record.\n\nBetween 1880 and 1894 Thomas Newton SIMS and his wife had seven children, one of whom died as a baby. Per a handwritten obituary found on a descendant’s tree, he was the father of ten, six were living when he died on 3 March 1896. The three children who pre-deceased him are unknown at this time. Also surviving him was one sister per the obituary. The person who wrote it did not know he had four siblings still living in West Virginia. Thomas’ death was likely attributed to blood poisoning he developed when he cut his leg with an ax while chopping wood according to his granddaughter Georgiana Rae EVERHART (1908-2005). The obit claims he had been in poor health for two years. Thomas’ widow moved to Henry County, Missouri before 1900, remarried about 1905, moved to St. Louis County, Missouri by 1910, and died there in 1927.\n\nA nice collection of photographs of William H. H. SIMS and his family were shared with me by Ron HURLEY. I have only shared two of these in this post as the rest were not identified at the time. I plan on sharing the photos in a future post.\n\nThe last installment will be for George Washington “Wash” SIMS, the youngest child of James SIMS and his second wife.\n\n© 2018, copyright Cathy Meder-Dempsey. All rights reserved.\n\nRewriting the Biography: Charles SIMS in the U.S. Federal Census\n\nRewriting the Biography is an ongoing theme for the rough draft notes of a new/updated biography of my 5th great-grandfather James SIMS (1754-1845) of Nicholas County.\n\nThe three youngest children of James SIMS and his second wife Elizabeth COTTON were boys. The oldest of these was Charles SIMS (1815-1891), born two months before his father turned 61 years old. His mother was about 35 years old.\n\nThe 1820 U.S. Federal Census\n\nAs with all of the youngest children of James SIMS, Charles was seen in his father’s household in 1820. He was five years old and one of two males under the age of 10 years. The other was the baby of the family, at that time, Dryden age two.\n\n1820 U.S. Federal Census\n\nNicholas County, (West) Virginia\n\nPage No. 204A, Sheet 152, Line 19\n\nEnumeration Date: 7 August 1820\n\nName: James Sims\n\nFree White Persons – Males – Under 10: 2 (Dryden and Charles)\n\nFree White Persons – Males – 45 and over: 1 (James)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – Under 10: 2 (Jane and Sarah)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – 10 thru 15: 2 (Margaret and Mildred)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – 26 thru 44: 1 (Elizabeth)\n\nSlaves – Males – Under 14: 2\n\nSlaves – Males – 14 thru 25: 2 (Isaac and Robert)\n\nSlaves – Females – Under 14: 3\n\nSlaves – Females – 14 thru 25: 2 (Black Jude and Black Fanny)\n\nNumber of Persons – Engaged in Agriculture: 3\n\nFree White Persons – Under 16: 6\n\nFree White Persons – Over 25: 2\n\nTotal Free White Persons: 8\n\nTotal Slaves: 9\n\nTotal All Persons – White, Slaves, Colored, Other: 17\n\nThe 1830 U.S. Federal Census\n\nIn 1830 Charles was 15 years old and seen in the 15 thru 19 category.

Two males were in his household. The second was likely his youngest brother George who was not with their father.\n\nCharles and George were both unmarried at this time. Charles had two enslaved persons in his household: a young male under 10 and a female 10 thru 23. By 1836 James SIMS had disposed of all of his slaves. Of all of the SIMS households in 1840, this was the only one with slaves.\n\n1840 U.S. Federal Census\n\nFayette County, (West) Virginia\n\nSheet 147, Line 6\n\nEnumeration Date: 1 June 1840\n\nName: Charles Sims\n\nFree White Persons – Males – 20 thru 29: 2 (Charles and George?)\n\nSlaves – Males – Under 10: 1\n\nSlaves – Females – 10 thru 23: 1\n\nPersons Employed in Agriculture: 1\n\nFree White Persons – 20 thru 49: 2\n\nTotal Free White Persons: 2\n\nTotal Slaves: 2\n\nTotal All Persons – Free White, Free Colored, Slaves: 4\n\nThe 1850 U.S. Federal Census\n\nIn May 1842 Charles SIMS and Minerva J. SUMMERS went to Gallia County, Ohio, where they were married on the 17th. What a story this would make if only the details were known. Both the groom and bride’s parents lived in Nicholas County. By 1850 Charles and Minerva were the parents of four daughters. Also in their household was Charles FOSTER, the orphaned son of Charles’ sister Sarah.\n\nEight consecutive households with SIMS families were listed in the 1850 census including Charles, his brother George W., their half-brother Martin and three of his married sons, as well as two married sons of their half-brother William. In 1816 Charles’ half-brothers Martin and William had acquired 260 acres which joined the land of their father James SIMS which explains why so many SIMS households were enumerated one after the other on the census.\n\n1850 U.S. Federal Census\n\nFayette County, Virginia\n\nThe 14th District\n\nSheets 343A+B, Lines 40-42 and 1-4, HH #174-174\n\nCharles Sims 37 M Farmer $500 Virginia\n\nManerva J.

Son-in-law George W. NICHOLS was living in Kanawha County with his three sons, a new wife and their six months old daughter.\n\nGeorge R. Penick Jr. (1921-1986), a great-grandson of Charles, compiled a family history in 1978-1980. The compilation did not have a name – I call it The Penick Papers. Mr. Penick tells an interesting story recounted to him by two persons.\n\nAccording to Mrs. Mary Ann Smith, Webster Springs, WV and to Mrs. Helen Nichols Kelley, Earth, Texas, they had 3 sons, William, Bernard??, and Charles Lee. Sometime after Margaret died Mr. Nichols took William and Bernard?? and went west. On the way his horses bolted and Bernard??, age 5, fell out of the wagon and was killed when run over by a wagon wheel. Mr. Nichols left Charles in West Virginia (with his grandparents in Swiss according to Mrs. Kelley – and with his Uncle Frank Nichols in Dixie according to Mary Ann Smith). His paternal grandparents probably lived in Dixie.\n\nThere appears to be a question in this story of the name of the son who was killed. The 1870 census listing shows William age 8, Charles age 6, and Irvin age 4. In 1880 William was found with his father in Missouri and Charles was with his uncle Franklin M. NICKOLS in Fayette County, West Virginia. The youngest son Irvin born about 1866 per the 1870 census may likely be the son who was killed at the age of 5. A marriage record for George and his second wife Elizabeth ESTES has not been found. On the 1870 census, she was listed as born in Missouri. Their daughter Mary C. was born in December 1869 in West Virginia. The column for married within the census year is not checked therefore they likely married before June 1869. George may have gone out to Missouri after he was widowed in October 1867, married Miss Estes, and returned with her to West Virginia. The trip west when the tragic death of the son took place must have been after the 1870 census. If in 1871, Irvin would have been 5 and likely the son who was killed which would match the story. The 1880 census shows George and his family were in Missouri by 1873, in the Indian Territory around 1875 and back in Missouri around 1878.\n\nThe 1880 U.S. Federal Census\n\nIn 1880 the four youngest children of Charles and Minerva were living at home.

He was a widower with six children still at home in 1880.\n\nBefore the 1900 U.S. Federal Census\n\nIn February 1882 Charles and Minerva’s son Aaron Floyd married Nancy Ellen “Nannie E.” CARPER. The following month their daughter Mary F. married her first cousin Joseph Andrew Dixon DARLINGTON, son of Jane L. SIMS and Joseph DARLINGTON. Their daughter Ellen also known as Ella Mae married Charles E. SMAILES in April 1883.\n\nFollowing these marriages, only young Sallie was living at home with her parents. In January 1886, according to Mr. Penick, Sallie and John Samuel SIMMS took a steamboot from Montgomery, Fayette County, West Virginia to Catlettsburg, Boyd County, Kentucky to be married. I have not been able to find a marriage record to corraborate this story. John, a great-great-grandson of James SIMS, was Sallie’s first cousin twice removed.\n\nCharles SIMS died 26 April 1891 and his wife Minerva J. SUMMERS died 9 August 1899. They are both buried in the Sims Memorial Church Cemetery in Swiss, Nicholas County, behind the Sims Memorial M.(Methodist) E.(Episcopalian) Church. The church was built in 1922 on land donated by the Sims family and stands on the spot of James SIMS’ original 2-story log house.\n\nAll census records and the marriage record for Charles SIMS give his name as Charles without a middle initial or name. Mr. Penick listed him as Charles Fulton SIMS and wrote “Birth & Marriage dates from Simms Family Bible. All of the handwritten Bible entries spell the name Sims.” It is not known if the middle name Fulton came from the Bible and Mr. Penick did not mention who owned it. As he is the only source for this middle name and I cannot substantiate it, I will continue to list him as Charles SIMS as seen on his grave marker.\n\nThe Remaining Children\n\nMary F. died at the age of 30 in 1887; Lydia Emmaretta died at the age of 65 in 1915; Ella Mae died at the age of 65 in 1924; Elizabeth Ann at the age of 90 in 1937; and Aaron Floyd died at the age of 78 in 1940.\n\nCharles and Minerva’s youngest daughter Sallie Tyree SIMMS died at the age of 97 on 23 March 1964. The informant on her death certificate was her daughter Mae, mother of Mr. Penick. Sallie was the last living grandchild of James SIMS (1754-1845) and died 210 years after his birth.\n\nThe next installment will be for Dryden SIMS, the second youngest son of James SIMS and his second wife.\n\n© 2018, copyright Cathy Meder-Dempsey.

Their youngest son Joel Dixon married Charlotte Marsh DARLINGTON in 1874. Their son James Wesley’s wife had died about 1871. He married Clarissa KILLINGSWORTH, a widow, in 1874. The marriage did not last long, perhaps ending with the death of Clarissa as James was listed as widowed when he married Martha Jane McKinney, a single lady, in 1875.

The order of birth cannot be proven as noted in my previous post on her sister Margaret.\n\nThe 1810 U.S. Federal Census\n\nSarah’s year of birth is not known and I estimate it at between 1804-1806 due to the fact that she married in 1825. In 1810 she fit into the under 10 years of age category placing her birth at between 1801-1810. She was found in her father’s household with her mother and siblings James, Margaret, and Mildred as well as five slaves.\n\n1810 U.S. Federal Census\n\nKanawha County, (West) Virginia\n\nKanawha\n\nSheet 207A, Line 23\n\nName: James Simms\n\nFree White Persons – Males – Under 10: 1 (James Jr.)\n\nFree White Persons – Males – 45 and over: 1 (James)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – Under 10: 3 (Margaret, Sarah, and Mildred)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – 26 thru 44: 1 (Elizabeth)\n\nNumbers of Slaves: 5 (Isaac, Black Jude, Black Fanny, Robert, and unknown)\n\nNumber of Household Members Under 16: 4\n\nNumber of Household Members Over 25: 2\n\nNumber of Household Members: 11\n\nThe 1820 U.S. Federal Census\n\nAs mentioned in the previous post for Margaret SIMS, the two oldest daughters’ of James SIMS from his second marriage to Elizabeth COTTON did not live long enough to be included on the 1850 census which would give a more accurate estimate for their births. Also discussed in the previous post was the possible unreliability of the 1820 census due to its appearance. Light and dark writing suggest it was worked over after the original information was gathered. By 1820 the household of James SIMS had grown to include four daughters and two sons. Sarah’s oldest brother was not living at home. There were more slaves in the household than family members.\n\n1820 U.S. Federal Census\n\nNicholas County, (West) Virginia\n\nPage No. 204A, Sheet 152, Line 19\n\nEnumeration Date: 7 August 1820\n\nName: James Sims\n\nFree White Persons – Males – Under 10: 2 (Dryden and Charles)\n\nFree White Persons – Males – 45 and over: 1 (James)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – Under 10: 2 (Mildred and Jane)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – 10 thru 15: 2 (Margaret and Sarah)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – 26 thru 44: 1 (Elizabeth)\n\nSlaves – Males – Under 14: 2\n\nSlaves – Males – 14 thru 25: 2 (Isaac and Robert)\n\nSlaves – Females – Under 14: 3\n\nSlaves – Females – 14 thru 25: 2 (Black Jude and Black Fanny)\n\nNumber of Persons – Engaged in Agriculture: 3\n\nFree White Persons – Under 16: 6\n\nFree White Persons – Over 25: 2\n\nTotal Free White Persons: 8\n\nTotal Slaves: 9\n\nTotal All Persons – White, Slaves, Colored, Other: 17\n\nThe 1830 U.S. Federal Census\n\nSarah gave birth to an illegitimate son Milton SIMS about 1824. The following year on 6 September 1825 she married Peyton FOSTER, a widower, in Nicholas County.\n\nPeyton’s first wife Nancy JOHNSON, daughter of my 5th great-grandparents William JOHNSON and Amy NELSON, had given him two sons per the 1820 census. She may have also given birth to another son after the 1820 census and before her death. This is reflected in there being two males in the 5 thru 9 years age group in 1830. One of these was Sarah’s son Milton SIMS while the other could have been a son from Peyton’s previous marriage. The only known child of Peyton FOSTER and Nancy JOHNSON was Johnson FOSTER, whose given name was his mother’s maiden name. As an aside, Nancy was a sister of my 4th great-grandfather William JOHNSON Jr. who married Nancy Ann SIMS, Sarah’s half-sister.\n\nSarah and Peyton had a daughter Mariah born about 1828. There was also an unknown male in the household. We will get to him later.\n\n1830 U.S. Federal Census\n\nNicholas County, (West) Virginia\n\nName: Peyton Foster\n\nFree White Persons – Males – Under 5: 2 (marked out and not included in total)\n\nFree White Persons – Males – 5 thru 9: 2 (Sarah’s son Milton and unknown)\n\nFree White Persons – Males – 10 thru 14: 1 (son Johnson from Peyton’s first marriage)\n\nFree White Persons – Males – 20 thru 29: 2 (marked out and not included in total)\n\nFree White Persons – Males – 30 thru 39: 2 (Peyton Foster and unknown)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – Under 5: 1 (Mariah)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – 20 thru 29: 1 (Sarah)\n\nFree White Persons – Under 20: 4\n\nFree White Persons – 20 thru 49: 5\n\nTotal Free White Persons: 7\n\nTotal – All Persons (Free White, Slaves, Free Colored): 7\n\nNote: There were two columns on the census which were marked out and not included in the total.\n\nThe 1840 U.S. Federal Census\n\nNo trace of Peyton FOSTER was found in the 1840 census. Was he deceased? Was Sarah living with her children in the household of another relative? I suspect both Peyton and Sarah were deceased by 1840. But can this be proven?\n\nPeyton FOSTER did not leave a will in Nicholas or Fayette counties which might include the names of his children or which might infer his wife Sarah pre-deceased him. It is known that she died before 1848 when the partition suit was filed for James SIMS’ land and her children were named:\n\n…also the children of Sarah Foster, formerly Sarah Sims, to-wit, Jordan Hickson and Mariah his wife; James Foster, Peyton Foster, Charles Foster, and Milton Sims, the last three but one are infants…\n\nThere are several factors which make finding the FOSTER children in 1840 difficult. The most obvious being the pre-1850 census did not include names of persons other than the head of household. Changing county border lines also cause a problem. Sarah lived in an area of Nicholas County which became Fayette County in 1831 and family was on both sides of the county line. The size of the family Sarah came from also makes it difficult to figure out who her children may have been living with in 1840.\n\nMilton SIMS and Charles FOSTER\n\nMilton SIMS was the one son who was no longer an infant in 1848. James, Peyton, and Charles were infants in 1848. From later census years it is known that James was born about 1830, Peyton about 1833, and Charles about 1837. There are three households in 1840 in which I believe Sarah’s three infant sons may be found. As I have already worked through the pre-1850 census listings for the SIMS families I have an idea of which families have people living in the household who did not fit into the family group.\n\nSarah’s father James SIMS was still living in 1840 and had two unknown young males in his home. It is likely they were the 3 years old Charles and one of the two older sons, Milton SIMS about 15 or James about 9. As the age range is 10 thru 14, I am leaning more to this being Milton.\n\n1840 U.S. Federal Census\n\nNicholas County, Virginia\n\nEnumeration Date: 1 June 1840\n\nName: James Sims Sr.\n\nFree White Persons – Males – Under 5: 1 (poss.

Dryden will be discussed in a later post.\n\nIn order to follow my reasoning, the reader needs to know he married in 1837 and had only a son Alfred by 1840. As no other full siblings of Sarah had individuals in their household who would fit, I would like to deduce that the children in Dryden’s household may be Sarah’s son James about 9 and her daughter Mariah about 13.\n\nThis leaves a young girl 5 thru 9 in the Dryden SIMS household who could have been a child of Sarah but who would have died by 1848 as no other child is mentioned in the partition suit.

Cyrus married Anna PETTIT in Kanawha County in 1824. Was he widowed by 1830 and was he the other adult male in the household of Peyton FOSTER in 1830? Cyrus married Jane HALEY in 1838 in Fayette County. The age range for the female in the 1840 census for Cyrus WEDGE (above) does not fit the age seen (below) for his wife Jane. The first name of the wife in 1850 matches the name on the 1838 marriage record. No other marriage has been found for him after 1840 and before 1850.\n\nJames and Peyton FOSTER\n\nThe FOSTER boys, James and Peyton, are in the WEDGE household in 1850 as well as a third child, Octavia YOUNG. Octavia would marry John HUGHES in 1860 and they would be living next door to the WEDGE couple in 1860. John was discovered to be the son of Matthew HUGHES and Margaret SIMS (Sarah’s sister) in my last post.\n\n1850 U.S. Federal Census (See image above)\n\nFayette County, Virginia\n\nThe 14th District\n\nEnumerated on the 1st day of August 1850\n\nSheet No. 342A, Lines 29-33, HH #159-159\n\nCyrus Wedge 60 M Farmer Vermont\n\nJane Wedge 66 F Ireland cannot read & write\n\nJames Foster 19 M Laborer Virginia\n\nPeyton Foster 17 M Virginia\n\nOctava Young 11 F Virginia\n\nJohnson FOSTER (step-son)\n\nJohnson FOSTER, Sarah’s step-son remained close to his half-brothers.

Victoria STEELE was still in the household. Milton was widowed after the 1870 census and remarried in 1876 to Mary Salinas WOOD, a daughter of my 3rd great-grandparents Elijah WOOD and Rachel HONAKER. She was widowed twice and had McGRAW and ARBAUGH children. Milton died after the 1880 census and did not have children with his second wife who wrote her last will and testament in 1897. It was recorded in 1901 following her death.\n\nMariah FOSTER returned with her husband Jordan HUDSON to Fayette County soon after the 1850 census. They had two children born in 1851 and 1854 before Jordan died, likely between 1854-1857. Mariah, seen as widowed in the marriage register, then married her first cousin Alfred Hansford SIMS, son of Dryden SIMS and Rebecca BAYS, on 5 January 1858 in Fayette. They had seven children by 1874 before Alfred disappeared. Mariah was listed as widowed in 1880, missed in 1900 and 1910, and found with her youngest daughter in 1920. She was enumerated as widowed and 95 years old in 1920. A death record has not been found. What happened to her second husband A. H. SIMS? The answer will have to wait until Dryden SIMS’ census records are analyzed.\n\nJames FOSTER married a young lady named Eliza Jane before 1853. They had four sons in the 1850s and three daughters in the 1860s. James and Eliza Jane likely died by 1880 when the children were found spread around in different households. Birth, marriage, and deaths records of the children were searched for any record with the maiden name of Eliza Jane. Only one death record was found with the name of the mother, Eliza Jane SEAL. This is a very unusual surname for the area. It’s possible she was Eliza Jane STEELE, seen in 1850 age 14 with the family of Selina L. STEELE. In 1965 Alexander Napoleon Rippetoe STEELE (91 years old at the time), recounted to Allen STEELE and Kitty Steele BARRERA that his father Jeffrey Oliver STEELE Jr. was the youngest child of Jeffrey Oliver STEELE Sr., father of Selina. Jeffrey Jr. was 18 on the 1850 census. Could this mean Victoria was a grandchild of one of the older STEELE children?\n\nPeyton FOSTER married Margaret HARRAH, daughter of Daniel HARRAH and Rachel Ann SMITH, in 1855. Their entry in the marriage register of Fayette County has her maiden name spelled O’HARROW. They had five known children. They named one son Cyrus, after Cyrus WEDGE and a daughter Rachel Ann after Margaret’s mother. Margaret died before 1880 and Peyton was last seen in 1900 in Kanawha County with his son Cyrus’ family.\n\nCharles FOSTER married Antonietta E. COPELAND on 25 December 1857 in Fayette County. They had five known children born between 1859 and 1872. Charles died sometime after 1872 and before 1877. His widow remarried on 27 December 1877 to William KINCAID. By 1880 she was seen as widowed. Antonietta lived with her youngest daughter Mary Ann in 1920 and died in August that year at the age of 83.\n\nRemaining to be analyzed are the census listings of two daughters and three sons of James SIMS and Elizabeth COTTON. All five lived at least until the 1880 census which will make them a bit easier and more interesting to study, research, and write about. Next up is Mildred “Milly” SIMS, the wife of Joel Dixon SETTLE Jr.\n\n© 2018, copyright Cathy Meder-Dempsey.

It could be a story, a biography, a photograph, an outline of a research problem — anything that focuses on one ancestor.”\n\nThis is entry #36 in Amy Johnson Crow’s Challenge: 52 Ancestors in 52 Weeks.\n\nI’m a bit behind on this week’s entry. Setting up my new laptop is taking me longer than I thought. And there are other things in my life that have priority – spending time with my husband and children, keeping myself healthy (310 kilometers/11+ hours on my bike since the 1st of the month), and creating memories.\n\n#36 William JOHNSON Jr. 1793-1845\n\nWilliam JOHNSON Sr. (1755-1805) and Amy NELSON (1757-1837) married about 1774. Most family trees have their place of marriage as Bath County in Virginia but I cannot agree with this.\n\nAs is the case with all research in old Virginia, the county formations need to be considered. Bath County was created in 1790 from parts of Augusta, Botetourt, and Greenbrier counties. Greenbrier was formed in 1778 from Botetourt and Montgomery counties. Botetourt County was established in 1770 from Augusta County. The marriage of William and Amy most likely took place in the area of Botetourt County that later went to Greenbrier or in Augusta County where the Johnston families lived. As this is a portrait of William JOHNSON Jr., I will go into the Johnston connection in Augusta County in a later post.\n\nWilliam and Amy were the parents of at least 8 known children, one of them being my fourth great-grandfather William JOHNSON (1793-1845) born about 1793 on Lick Run, Greenbrier County in old Virginia, now West Virginia.\n\nWilliam’s oldest brother Rev. John JOHNSON was born in 1777 in Botetourt or Augusta County. Their father may have been away from home for long periods of time due to his military service during the Revolutionary War (1775-1784). In any case, the next child Nelson JOHNSON was born about 1782. In Laidley’s 1911 History Nelson is named as one of the four sons of William JOHNSON Sr. Other sources have him listed as the son of Benjamin JOHNSON.\n\nWilliam Johnson Sr. moved to what is now Monroe County, West Virginia, after the end of the Revolutionary War and lived there for a number of years.\n\nNew records brought to light by Wayne L. Johnson, a direct descendant of William Jr., may prove that William Sr. was actually in the area when Greenbrier County was formed in 1778. This would mean that John and Nelson were born “in the Sinks” as the JOHNSONs were there in 1784:\n\nAmong the people who were living in the Sinks at the close of the Revolution were several Methodist families. Among these were the Blantons, the Christys, the Johnsons, and the Warrens. They held religious meetings at their homes, and as their membership was growing, they organized a regular society late in the summer of 1784. This date, it will be observed, is also that of the independence of the Methodist Church.\n\nNote (5 September 2022): I have doubts that the Johnsons mentioned in this excerpt are William JOHNSON and his wife Amy. They were Methodists and lived in an area of Greenbrier (Lick Run) that would later be part of Monroe. However, it must be noted that there was another JOHNSON family in the area. More records are needed to establish a timeline of the Johnson families at this time.\n\nJames M. (1783-1834), Susannah (1784-1840), Mary “Polly” (1790-1850), my 4th great-grandfather William (1793-1845), Nancy (1794-1825), and Amy (1795-1859) were born on Lick Run then part of Greenbrier County.\n\nTwo land records were extracted from the deed books of Greenbrier County many years ago by David Fridley (who did not note the book or page on these). They would indicate that William and Amy left for Kanawha around 1798 selling a total of 238 acres:\n\n◉ 25 June 1798. William Johnson and Amy deeded out 62 acres Lick Run. Witn: John Johnston\n\n◉ 26 June 1798. William Johnson and Amy sold 88 acres Lick Run. Witn: John Johnston, et al.\n\nThe two tracts of land were part of a survey of 150 acres granted in 1796 to William JOHNSON by a patent lying and being in the county of Greenbrier on the waters of Lick Run.\n\nThe JOHNSON family likely moved to Peters Creek, at the time in Kanawha County, after disposing of the 150 acres in 1798. William Sr. settled and remained there for the rest of his life.\n\nThe murder of one individual or a dozen families did not deter the sturdy pioneer from his onward march in the conquest of the wilderness, and accordingly, before a year has passed after the destruction of Kelly’s settlement, we find Leonard and William Morris both residing almost in sight of the fatal spot. Their settlement is elsewhere noticed [pg. 58, Kelly was killed in early 1773]. Among those who here found homes and become actual settlers in the next few years were John Hansford, Sr., Thomas Foster, Ransom Gatewood, Robert Perry, John Jarrett, John D. Massey, Gallatin G. Hansford, William Johnson, John Wheeler, Shadrach Childers, Peter Likens, Spencer Hill, William Pryor, Barney Green, Thomas Trigg and Shadrach Hariman.\n\nIn the above, it cannot be assumed that William JOHNSON mentioned is William JOHNSON Sr. Laidley further mentions William in this excerpt from the biography of Julian M. JOHNSON:\n\nThen he and his sons, William, John, Nelson and James, moved to Gauley River in what is now Nicholas County, WV, near and below the mouth of Little Elk about 1798.\n\nWilliam’s youngest sister Elizabeth (1799-1840) was born the year after the family moved to Kanawha County.\n\nAt the turn of the century, William’s sister Susannah was the first to marry. She married Martin SIMS (1783-1853) on 28 March 1800 in Greenbrier County. The permission slip dated 24 March 1800 for Susannah’s marriage was signed by her father William JOHNSON.\n\nWilliam’s brother John married Elizabeth SIMS (1782-1845), sister of the above-mentioned Martin SIMS, on 2 June 1802 in Kanawha County.\n\nWilliam JOHNSON Sr. would only live to see these two children marry. He died on 22 December 1805 and was buried near Swiss in present-day Nicholas County, West Virginia.\n\nFollowing their father’s death, the children lived with their mother Amy until one by one they married and started their own families. Mary “Polly” married Benjamin DARLINGTON (1775-1853) on 23 April 1810 in Kanawha County. She was with her husband when the 1810 census was enumerated. Amy was with her single children and close to son John and daughter Susannah who had married the SIMS siblings.\n\n1810 U.S. Federal Census\n\nKanawha County, (West) Virginia\n\nKanawha\n\nJohnston, Anne (sic, Amy; listed just above her son John)\n\nFree White Persons – Males – Under 10: 2 (James & Alexander)\n\nFree White Persons – Males – 10 thru 15: 1 (William)\n\nFree White Persons – Males – 16 thru 25: 1 (Nelson)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – 10 thru 15: 1 (Elizabeth)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – 16 thru 25: 2 (Amy & Nancy)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – 45 and over : 1 (Amy)\n\nNumber of Household Members Under 16: 4\n\nNumber of Household Members Over 25: 1\n\nNumber of Household Members: 8\n\nDuring the time our nation was at war (War of 1812), William and his two single brothers married in Kanawha County.\n\n◉ James M. JOHNSON and Elizabeth MILLER ( -1823) were married on 4 May 1813 by Edward Hughes. A bond or license was applied for on 29 April 1813 ,\n\n◉ Nelson JOHNSON married Nancy MURPHY in 1813\n\n◉ William JOHNSON married Nancy Ann SIMS on 15 October 1814\n\nIn 1815, soon after William married my 4th great-grandmother Nancy Ann SIMS, sister of Martin and Elizabeth SIMS mentioned earlier, their first child Nelson JOHNSON (1815-1855) was born in Kanawha County. In all records found for Nelson, I have only seen “Nelson” as his first name. Denise Jackson of Our Family Heritage©1974-2022 is a great-great-granddaughter of this son. Family lore is that his full name was Joseph Nelson JOHNSON and his grandson Joseph Nelson “JN” JOHNSON was named after him. On 9 May 2014, she wrote “It is only word of mouth about JN’s grandfather being Joseph Nelson Johnson and he (JN) being named for him” in response to my email to her about the full name. Before replying, she checked with two of her cousins, the sons of her father’s sister, and her two brothers as she said, “I wanted to check with all of them to make sure I had heard (and remembered) correctly.” They confirmed that she was right about the family lore.\n\nWilliam JOHNSON Jr. and his family originally lived at the mouth of Laurel Creek, a tributary of the Gauley River which empties about one mile above Swiss. In 1810 the JOHNSON and SIMS families were neighbors and it is known that James SIMS, father of Nancy Ann SIMS, made his home in what is today known as Swiss. William’s son John B. JOHNSON was born at the mouth of Rich Creek on Gauley in 1823 per the 1911 biography of his son Julian M. JOHNSON. This would have been in the area of Swiss. Later, most likely after 1823, the JOHNSON family moved to a place on Loop Creek (Loup Creek) in the area of what is known as Robson in present-day Fayette County, West Virginia.\n\n“Loop Creek flows for its entire length in western Fayette County. It rises in the city of Oak Hill and flows initially west-northwestward through the unincorporated communities of Lick Fork, Wriston, Ingram Branch, and Hamilton; then northward through the unincorporated communities of Kincaid, Page, North Page, and Robson, to Deep Water, where it flows into the Kanawha River.”\n\nBefore William and Nancy’s next child was born two of his sisters married brothers in Kanawha County. Nancy married Peyton FOSTER (1793- ) on 11 January 1815. Amy and Turley FOSTER (1794-1859) were married by Edward HUGHES on 16 November 1816. The marriage was also recorded on 18 November 1816.\n\nAnd William’s family continued to grow with the birth of my third great-grandmother Huldah JOHNSON (1817-1880) about 1817 and Alexander JOHNSON (1819-1887) on 10 June 1819.\n\nThe 1820 and 1830 censuses were enumerated in alphabetical order rather than in order of household visitation. This makes it less useful for locating the actual place where the family lived.\n\nThe family was in Nicholas County in 1820 and then next seen in Kanawha County in the 1830 census which supports the theory that their move to Loop Creek was in the 1820s, most likely between 1824-1830. Robson is 10 miles south of present-day Gauley Bridge. Fayette County was created on 28 February 1831 from parts of Greenbrier, Kanawha, Nicholas, and Logan counties. From then on William’s children were born on Loop Creek in Fayette County where they were seen in the 1840 census.\n\n1820 U.S. Federal Census\n\nNicholas County, (West) Virginia\n\nPage No: 204B\n\nEnumerated by: Hedgman Triplett on the 26th day of December 1820\n\nWilliam Johnson\n\n2 males under 10 yo (Nelson and Alexander)\n\n2 males 10 & under 16 yo (not sons of Wm and Nancy who were married only 6 yrs)\n\n1 male 16 & under 26 yo (William)\n\n1 female under 10 yo (Huldah)\n\n1 female 16 & under 26 yo (Nancy Ann b. bet. 1794-1804)\n\n1 person engaged in agriculture\n\n7 persons in household\n\nFollowing the enumeration of the 1820 census, William’s fourth child Mary JOHNSON (1820-1898) was born on 20 August 1820.\n\nWilliam’s sister Elizabeth JOHNSON married Presley L. FOSTER (1798-1873), a brother of Turley and Peyton FOSTER, on 12 March 1822 in Nicholas County, (West) Virginia. His brother James M. JOHNSON, recently widowed, married(2) Sarah LEGG (1795- ) on 6 March 1823 in Nicholas County, (West) Virginia.\n\nShortly before Christmas in 1823 another son, John B. JOHNSON (1823-1902), was born on 23 December 1823. His middle name may be assumed by many to be Brown but I have not found proof of this. The JOHNSON family was very fond of this name!\n\nThe first of William’s siblings, Nancy (Johnson) FOSTER died before 6 September 1825 leaving only one known child, a son she named Johnson FOSTER.\n\nNancy gave William three more children before the 1830 census: Amy JOHNSON (1825-1904) on 4 November 1825, Lewis JOHNSON (1828-1845) on 6 March 1828, and Elizabeth JOHNSON (1829-1833) about 1829.\n\n1830 U.S. Federal Census\n\nKanawha County, (West) Virginia\n\nJohnston, William\n\n2 males under 5 yo (Lewis b. 1828, John Brown b. 1823)\n\n1 male 5 & under 10 yo (Alexander b. 1819)\n\n1 male 10 & under 15 yo (Nelson b. ca. 1815)\n\n1 male 30 & under 40 yo (William Jr. b. 1793)\n\n1 female under 5 yo (Amy b. 1825)\n\n1 female 5 & under 10 yo (Mary b. 1820)\n\n1 female 10 & under 15 yo (Huldah b. ca. 1818)\n\n1 female 30 & under 40 yo (Nancy Ann Sims Johnson b. bet. 1791-1800)\n\n1 female 70 & under 80 yo (Amy Nelson Johnson b. 1757)\n\n7 free white persons under 20\n\n2 free white person 20 thru 9\n\n10 total free white persons\n\n10 total – all persons\n\nIn William’s household, we see an older woman. This must be his mother as family tradition is that she lived among her children until her death.\n\nWilliam’s family was not yet complete: William Hunter JOHNSON (1832-1899) was born on 27 July 1832 and Nancy JOHNSON (1835-1915) was born in August 1835. Sadly, young Elizabeth, about 4 years old, died about 1833 of the flux.\n\nA year later William’s brother James M. JOHNSON died in 1834 on Loop Creek, Fayette County, (West) Virginia.\n\nWilliam’s oldest child Nelson JOHNSON married Elizabeth HUGHES (1817-1900) on 14 September 1837 in Fayette County, (West) Virginia.\n\nSadly there would be another death in the family during the 1830s. William’s elderly mother Amy NELSON died on 23 December 1837 in Robson, Fayette County, (West) Virginia, and was buried in Nichols Cemetery on Loop Creek also known as Nichols Hollow Cemetery, Robson.\n\nAmie Nelson Johnson lived among her children after coming to Loup Creek but her last days were at the home of her son William, whose home was near that of Mutt Ellis. This was very close to the cemetery known then as the Kelly grave yard but now called the Nuchils cemetery. This is a beautiful location for a cemetery. In a row in this cemetery is the grave of William and Nancy Simms Johnson, two children, and the mother Amie Nelson Johnson. William and Nancy died around 1845 during a typhoid fever epidemic. Afterwards, most of his family went to Kanawha County to an area called the Grape Vine, near Charleston.\n\nUnfortunately, Laura Blake, a local historian, didn’t get all the facts correct in the above statement. William’s wife Nancy SIMS did not die around 1845 during a typhoid fever epidemic. She was seen living with her son William Hunter JOHNSON in Kanawha County in 1860.\n\nAfter his mother Amy’s death, William’s wife Nancy gave birth to their last child Morris Houston JOHNSON (1839-1845) on 21 January 1839 in Fayette County, (West) Virginia.\n\nWilliam’s daughter Mary JOHNSON married David Alexander MILLER (1820-1871) on 13 December 1839 in Fayette County, (West) Virginia.\n\nWilliam’s sister Susannah SIMS died before the 1840 census.\n\n1840 U.S. Federal Census\n\nFayette County, (West) Virginia\n\nJohnson, William Sr. (page 145)\n\n2 males under 5 yo (William Hunter and Morris Houston)\n\n1 male 5 & under 10 yo (Lewis)\n\n1 male 15 & under 20 yo (John Brown)\n\n1 male 20 & under 30 yo (Alexander)\n\n1 male 40 & under 50 yo (William)\n\n1 female under 5 yo (Nancy)\n\n1 female 15 & under 20 yo (Amy)\n\n1 female 20 & under 30 yo (Huldah)\n\n1 female 30 & under 40 yo (Nancy Ann; should be listed as 40 & under 50 yo)\n\n10 persons in household\n\n2 persons engaged in agriculture\n\nWilliam’s sister Elizabeth died after the 1840 census and before 9 February 1843 when her widower Presley FOSTER married Lucretia BAILES. Update: During a recent review of the records, the correct date of marriage was found in the War of 1812 widow’s pension of Lucretia FOSTER, the widow of Presly FOSTER. Previously seen as 9 February 1840, the corrected date changes the timeline. Elizabeth would have been the woman in Presley’s household in 1840 and not Lucretia. She therefore died after the census and before Presley’s remarriage.\n\nWilliam and Nancy’s oldest daughter Huldah JOHNSON married Robert INGRAM (1819-1902) in about 1841 in Fayette County (West) Virginia.\n\nIn 1845 during an epidemic of typhoid fever, three members of the family died. William’s sons died within three weeks of each other: Morris Houston JOHNSON died on 11 August 1845 and Lewis JOHNSON died on 31 August 1845. William JOHNSON followed his sons on 18 December 1845. They are all buried in the Nichols Cemetery in Fayette County.\n\nThis Post was Updated on 4 September 2022: Missing source citations were added, images were scaled, and some corrections were made to the text and format.\n\n© 2014-2022, copyright Cathy Meder-Dempsey.

It could be a story, a biography, a photograph, an outline of a research problem — anything that focuses on one ancestor.”\n\nThis is entry #27 in Amy Johnson Crow’s Challenge: 52 Ancestors in 52 Weeks.\n\nHard to believe that we are halfway through the year and beginning the 2nd half of the challenge this week.\n\n#27 Mary E. “Polly” DOSS ~ An Unwed Mother, Not a Spinster\n\nMy 3rd great-grandmother Polly never married. She wasn’t a spinster. She couldn’t have been since she was my ancestor. She was the mother of eight children all from a bond she had with one man, my 3rd great-grandfather William CLONCH.\n\nPolly was the daughter of Levina DOSS. Period. One unmarried mother in my family tree would be easy to take. But two is a bit harder. Polly’s mother Levina had up to seven children and left no trace of who the father of these children may have been. Or maybe she did leave something to identify the father(s) but it hasn’t been found [yet]. Why did these ladies, mother and daughter, never marry? Did they want to avoid total dependency on a husband?\n\nSingle Woman vs. Married Woman\n\nAlthough life may have been harsh, Polly possessed more rights as a single woman than a woman who was married. A single woman had a say over certain matters in her life. She could own property, enter into contracts, act as executor of an estate, or serve as a guardian. A married woman’s legal identity essentially ceased to exist when she married. A husband owned whatever belonged to his wife with the exception of personal items such as clothes and jewelry.\n\nLevina or Lavina\n\nPolly was born in Pittsylvania County around 1816. Per her mother Levina DOSS’s 1820 and 1830 census details she was the 6th of 7 children in the household. , The censuses are the only documents I have seen with Polly’s mother’s name – Levina. No documents have been found for Polly’s mother’s name being spelled Lavina. I believe, that since Polly named a daughter “Lavina” after her mother, others have assume that her mother’s name was also spelled this way.\n\nRoots in Pittsylvania County, Virginia\n\nT"
