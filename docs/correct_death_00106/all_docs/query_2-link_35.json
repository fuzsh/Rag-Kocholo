        "text": "In September 1921 Hollywood California would become the stage for a major scandal with popular silent film actor Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle,as the main actor. By the end of the whole ordeal, Arbuckle’s career would be in shambles.\n\nThe man\n\nArbuckle was one of the most famous and highest-paid silent film actors of the 1910s. Born in Smith Center Kansas, on 24 March 1889, he was a huge baby weighing nearly 16lb at birth. His father resented him believing him to be illegitimate as both he and Arbuckle’s mother were slim-built. At school, he endured mockery due to his weight and was given the nickname “Fatty” which stuck with him throughout his life. He started performing at the age of 8 in Santa Ana California where the family had moved six years earlier. His mother died when he was 12, and his father abandoned him. He traveled to San Jose where he found work in a hotel in exchange for room and board. His habit of singing while working attracted the attention of a professional singer who urged him to try an amateur night contest at the local theater. He won the contest and went on to appear in other theaters. In 1906 joined the Pantages Theater group and toured the West Coast with them. In 1909 he toured China and Japan with the Morosco Burbank Stock Vaudeville, and in July of that year, he signed on with the Selig Polyscope Company appearing in his first motion picture Bens Kid.\n\nHe joined Keystone Studios and became a star in the Keystone Cops slapstick comedies.\n\nBy 1914 Arbuckles was one of the kings of comedy. Paramount Pictures offered him $1000/day as well as twenty-five percent of all profits on movies made with him. He founded his own film company, Comique, in 1917 to have more control over his shorts. The following year Paramount Studios offered him a three-year contract of a million dollars per year. He accepted and relinquished control of his studio to Buster Keaton.\n\nLabor day 1921\n\nSeptember 5 was Labor Day in 1921 and Arbuckle and his two friends, Fred Fischbach and Lowell Sherman, decided to take a three-day trip to San Francisco for a little relaxation. They checked into the St Francis Hotel and booked three rooms 1219,1220 and 1221. A party was planned and despite prohibition, a shipment of whiskey and booze was delivered to them. Room 1220 was the party room while the other two were the trio sleeping quarters. Among the party attendees was 26-year-old Virginia Rappe an upcoming actress and her friend Bambina Maude Delmont. After several drinks, Rappe began feeling unwell and went to use the bathroom in room 1219. Minutes later, Arbuckle also entered the room. After a while partygoers were attracted by screams coming from the room. Guests entered to see Rappe holding her stomach and crying in agony. The hotel doctor was summoned and without bothering to examine her concluded she was drunk and hysterical so, he gave her morphine and told her to sleep it off. The next day Rappe was still very ill and in pain but for some reason, wasn’t taken to hospital. Instead, she was continually dosed with morphine. By this time Arbuckle had left San Francisco. But Maude Delmont was telling everyone Arbuckle was responsible for Rappe’s condition. On September 8,Rappe was finally taken to hospital but died the next day,her cause of death was peritonitis due to a ruptured bladder.\n\nThe scandal\n\nBut what had caused the ruptured bladder? Maude Delmont told police that Arbuckle had sexually assaulted Rappe and ruptured her bladder with his overweight body. Despite the doctor not finding any evidence of assault, police arrested Arbuckle on September 11. Arbuckle denied the accusation and claimed he’d entered his bedroom to find Rappe lying on the bathroom floor, thinking she was intoxicated he’d lay her on the bed and given her a glass of water only for her to roll off the bed ,and start moaning. He had attempted to dull her pain by rubbing an ice cube on her stomach but her cries of anguish had increased and alerted the guests. Maude Delmont insisted her friend had been raped by Arbuckle claiming Rappe had screamed the words “he did this to me!”\n\nArbuckle was charged with first-degree murder. Unfortunately, two people would prove to be a nightmare for him one was the D.A. Matthew Brady who felt obtaining a guilty verdict would enhance his career ,the other was newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst who exploited the situation for profit by exaggerating the stories therefore making big sales.\n\nHis paper The San Francisco Examiner fat-shamed and vilified Arbuckle as a gross lecher even accusing him of causing the ruptured bladder by assaulting Rappe with a Coke bottle.\n\nThe trial\n\nThe D.A. Brady’s star witness was Maude Delmont ,a brothel madam, extortionist, and fraudster whose story changed continuously. When a letter she’d written revealed her plan to extort money from Arbuckle the persecution decided not to call her to testify at the trial. The doctors who testified for the persecution claimed Arbuckles weight on Rappe could have caused the injuries as could cystitis, an abortion, or STD.\n\nThree other showgirls testified to hearing Rappe accuse Arbuckle of rape, but they lost credibility when it was discovered they had lied, after intimidation from the persecution. The first trial ended in a deadlock jury.\n\nThe second trial in January 1922, also ended deadlocked. The final trial started 13 March of the same year. On 12 April, the jury declared Arbuckle not guilty after a six-minute deliberation, five of which was spent writing an apology to Arbuckle.\n\nCancelled\n\nUnfortunately despite the acquittal, Hollywood still refused to touch Arbuckle. His films were banned and his reputation was ruined. A censor board, Motion Pictures Producers And Distributors of America, was formed and in April of 1922, the head, William Hays, banned Arbuckle from working in movies again and declared that all showing of his films be stopped. Although he eventually lifted the ban in December, Arbuckle still was unable to get a job. His trial had left him heavily in debt, his first wife, Minta Durfee left him, and he started drinking heavily. In 1925 he was able to land a job directing shorts under the name William Goodrich. He married again ,to Doris Deane ,but the marriage lasted only four years.\n\nComeback\n\nIn 1932, ten years after the scandal, his luck changed. Warner Bro. Production hired him to star in a few comedy shorts. Then on June 29, 1933, they offered him a feature film contract which he happily accepted. Things were finally looking up for him, that day was also his first wedding anniversary with his third wife Addie McPhail. So the couple and their friends went out to celebrate. Sadly Arbuckle suffered a heart attack that night and the 46-year-old actor died in his sleep.\n\nIn 1960 Arbuckle was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame."
