    "text": "The first famous slapstick comedian from the silent film era who was earning the largest salary of the time, was wrongfully and unjustly \"cancelled\" by Hollywood, media outlets, blackmailers, and a District Attorney seeking political satisfaction. The charges of rape and manslaughter were proven lies and yet, akin to what is going on today with former President Donald J. Trump, there are those who wanted Roscoe out of the way simply because he wasn't one of them. Arbuckle was acquitted but Hollywood blacklisted him just the same, destroying many of his films so to prevent them from ever being seen again. Studio heads disallowed fellow co-workers and friends to defend Arbuckle. Roscoe Arbuckle lost everything; films, career, home, cars, and he sank into overwhelming debt due to owing over $700,000 in legal fees. His good friends and family members were there to help him through the difficult time, however, his good name and unique success was ultimately ruined. When Hollywood, finally, decided to forgive him, Roscoe was presented with a new contract by Warner Bros. to star in his own feature talking films. He thought it was the best day of his life, the day he signed the contract, however, by the next morning, 29 June 1933, Roscoe Arbuckle was dead, having died of a heart attack in his sleep. He was 46. No one deserves an honorary posthumous award for contributions to the film industry from it's earliest times than Roscoe Conkling \"Fatty\" Arbuckle. Thankfully, many of his films have been found and preserved and are now being enjoyed. Help us to promote the legacy of Roscoe Arbuckle. We can do this! Thank you for your kind support.\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kEqUrVUsXyM"
