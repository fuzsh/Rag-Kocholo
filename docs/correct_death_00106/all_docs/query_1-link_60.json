    "text": "Fatty Arbuckle | Introduction\n\nRoscoe Conkling \"Fatty\" Arbuckle was an American silent film actor, comedian, director, and screenwriter. Born on March 24, 1887, in Smith Center, Kansas, Fatty Arbuckle grew up in a working-class family and began performing on stage at a young age. Arbuckle's early career in the entertainment industry was marked by his remarkable physical comedy skills and his unique ability to captivate audiences with his larger-than-life personality. Standing at 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighing over 250 pounds, his notable size only added to his comedic appeal. The nickname \"Fatty\" was given to him during his time at the Missouri School for the Deaf, where he excelled in sports due to his athleticism despite his size. Arbuckle's breakthrough in the film industry came when he was signed by Mack Sennett's Keystone Studios in 1913. He quickly became a popular figure in the burgeoning world of silent cinema, appearing in numerous short films and earning a reputation for his physical comedy talents. One of his most famous characters was the bumbling yet lovable \"Fatty,\" which became a beloved persona among audiences.

He became one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood, commanding a salary of $3,000 per week, an unprecedented amount at the time. However, Arbuckle's career and personal life were tragically marred by a scandal in 1921 that sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry. He was accused of the rape and manslaughter of actress Virginia Rappe, leading to a highly publicized trial that captivated the nation. Although Arbuckle was eventually acquitted of all charges, the scandal tarnished his reputation and effectively ended his career. Despite his acquittal, Arbuckle faced a lifetime of scrutiny and struggled to revive his once-thriving career in the aftermath of the scandal. He made a few unsuccessful attempts at a comeback, but the stain of the scandal proved too difficult to overcome. In the years that followed, he found solace in directing under the pseudonym \"William Goodrich,\" but his presence on-screen diminished significantly.
