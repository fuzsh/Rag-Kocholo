    "text": "A decision is made\n\nArbuckle is acquitted of manslaughter after the jury deliberated for only five minutes. Roscoe received a letter from the jury apologizing and stating he was completely innocent. Some believe this letter was a PR stunt by his lawyers. To this day people still debate whether or not Roscoe Arbuckle was guilty of Rappe's murder. Some people are confident he did not do it, while others believe events got twisted and he was guilty.\n\nHe was acquitted, but his career never recovered."
