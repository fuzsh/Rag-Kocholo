    "text": "This page covers scenes filmed looking west at the corner of E 13th and Ave M, spots (9), (10), (11), and (15) above. Remember to click each image for a larger view.\n\nWhen motorcycle cops respond to the china shop distress calls we get a clear view behind them of the SW corner of E 13th and Ave M, a vacant lot at the time. The building (A above) advertising the Kings Highway Saving Bank, now blocked from view by a modern apartment, still stands at 1206-1210 Ave M further west from the corner. The building (B above) in the far background still stands at the SW corner of Coney Island Ave and Ave M.\n\nA cop when you need one – Roscoe saves his skin by casually sauntering over next to a handy policeman. Behind them stands 1306 Ave M, at the time a vacant storefront with a “For Lease” sign, decorated with a distinctive ocular-shaped “FRUIT VEGETABLE & FISH MARKET” window sign.\n\nAbove left, Al and Pete arrive beside the FRAGILE CHINA SHOP (as opposed to the DURABLE shop) with the correct secret formula. The storefront located at 1312 Ave M was real, likely vacant and dressed up for the movie. The 1308 address next door is visible above behind Al’s head. The street numbering configuration may have changed somewhat today, but the Sanborn maps show 1312 and 1308 Ave M as consecutive addresses.\n\nThe motorcycle cops come to the rescue (11), turning right (east) from E 13th onto Ave M. The SW corner to the right behind them was vacant at the time, and the building at back is consistent with the present spot, although the ground floor of that building has since been remodeled. Given its proximity to the other sites, its general consistency with the movie frame, and the fact (per shot (9) above) the squad of cops was already filmed once before turning this same corner (maybe they used two cameras to capture both shots in one take), I am confident (11) above is the correct site.\n\nBuzzin’ Around is so named because a swarm of cartoon animated wasps (emanating from a hive that fell into the back of his car) overwhelm Roscoe as he drives into town. Having swallowed one pesky insect, Roscoe runs to a corner drug store (15) for relief.\n\nThe same corner (15), complete with legible corner street signs on the lamppost, appears in this Hey Pop shot of the orphanage thugs chasing Roscoe and Bill. Notice the same ocular-shaped FRUIT VEGETABLE & FISH MARKET window sign, at 1306 Ave M, to the left.\n\nBelow – looking west at the corner of E 13th and Ave M. Next, spots (13), (14), (16), (17), (18), and (19)."
