Abbott (civil engineer), William Van der Bosch (architect), and Harry Supple (foreman of riggers).\n\nConstruction was started on the bridge in 1869. The bridge was completed 14 years later in 1883.\n\nDavid McCullough in his book The Great Bridge: Epic Story of the Building of the Brooklyn Bridge does mention Charles Young in relationship to men suffering from Cassions Disease.\n\nDon's query about Charles Young made me curious about others who had worked and died on the bridge. I am always looking for the \"little guy\" who helped make history. This page is dedicated to the men who worked on the bridge and received some passing acknowledgement for their efforts.\n\nCharles W. Young, Brooklyn Bridge Foreman (c. 1834-189?)\n\nNote: At the time of her interment the bodies of her husband, Charles, and her son in law, Richard Haeslip were transfered to Greenwood Cemetery.\n\nDeath : 11/09/1899 lot 30351 section 196 grave 2 (Courtesy of Don Sayenga, November 20016) Note : The body was transferred from another cemetery or grave.\n\n1894 : Brooklyn Eagle - An article in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle of 28 January 1894 stated that during the 13 year construction of the bridge there were 20 fatal accidents. The article states that Charles W. Young died of congestion of the lungs.\n\n1884 : Reporting on work in 1871 - For three weeks Mr. Young and his crew were involved in leveling off and removing boulders which lay under the frames.\n\n1884 : C. W. Young listed in the report of the Chief Engineer of the Bridge as the \"general foreman\".\n\nA TERRIBLE DISEASE PRODUCED BY WORKING UNDER THE EAST RIVER BRIDGE - FORMAN YOUNG'S EXPERIENCE - SIX WERE KILLED AND MANY CRIPPLERD.\n\n1876 : Charles Young was still listed as general foreman of laborers Brooklyn Bridge. \"He was the right man for the right job and work was moving forward rapidly and with little friction.\" (Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, Volume 6)\n\nAnd further: \" Charles Young, the foreman, who had also been carried up through the lock about the same time, was equally in a bad state.\"\n\nDavid McCullough: \"Charles Young, the foreman, got the men under control. Nobody left the caisson and Young ordered clothes, rags, and mud into the cavity where the fire was burning to shut off the draft of compressed air as much as possible.\"\n\nTillie J. Bolton, born Philadelphia, died at the home of her son, Charles T Heaslip. She had lived in the Flatbush and Bedford sections of Brooklyn. She was a public school school teacher. Survived by her son and her sister, Wilhelmina Bainbridge, of Millstone, N. J.\n\n1893 : September 17, Mrs. T. J. Haeslip was dropped as a Sunday school teacher from the Methodist Church in Windsor Terrace over an argument with the Pastor Wright. Emma Young was also involved in the situation. Mrs. Haeslip accused the pastor of paying unwanted attention to her. Mr. Wright declined to comment.\n\nThe work was difficult, and required great skill and good judgment for its proper execution, and these they both possessed, as the success of the work indicates.\n\nAfter the work of sinking had been in progress about three months, it was found practicable to work a second \"shift\" of men, and Mr. George Clark was employed as general foreman, and continued in charge of one of the \"shifts\" until the caisson was filled with concrete.\n\nFatal Accident on the Bridge October 23, 1871 - John French, James ( aka John) Mc Garrity (variations of spelling) and William Doherty died\n\nIn 1872 the Brooklyn Bridge Report, published in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, stated:\n\nCornelius Lynch, John Cook, William Hines (variety of spellings), Robert Ast and Michael Mahon were listed as injured.\n\n1883 : The Evening Bulletin - Maysville Kentuckey: James \"Garrity\" and John French were killed outright on the Brooklyn Tower when a derrick fell. \"William\" Doherty was knocked from the tower and fell 40 feet to the pier, but survived. Thomas Douglass, a foreman, was severely injured with a broken knee and other injuries.\n\nThere were other problems on the bridge in the spring of 1872. In April and May several men died of caissons disease. The June 22 article stated: \"Knowing from the reports of other similar works that compressed air was liable to affect some men unfavorable, every known precaution was taken to guard against this danger.\" Dr. Andrew H. Smith \"a competent physician\" visited the works everyday to make sure the men were fit for work. Not withstanding all safety precautions three men died from the effects of the compressed air. Their names were not mentioned in the article. They were, however, Daniel Reardon, John Meyer and Patrick McKay. See below.\n\n1872 : June 22, Brooklyn Eagle General Superintendent's Report stated that \"On 23rd October owing to a defective weld in a rope section two derricks fell, causing the death of three men and wounding several others. A thorough investigation was asked for and was made by the Coroner, which resulted in a verdict entirely exonerating the Bridge company from all blame.\"\n\n1877 : February 5th - Mrs. French the widow of John French who was killed in 1871 was given assistance for her four small children $250.\n\n*The name was listed in the papers as: Hayes, Haines and Hines.\n\n1871 : November - To the families of John French and James McGarigle who were killed on the work October 23, $250.\n\n1871 : Financial considerations of $250 were made in November 1871 to the families of John French and James \"McGarigle\", who were killed on the work October 23. (Report of the Committee Appointed by the Board of Trustees)\n\nA Picture History of the Brooklyn Bridge by Mary J. Shapiro stated that in October 1871 T. G. Douglass, head mason and foreman on the Brooklyn tower, had been in a terrible accident when a guy wire supporting a boom derrick broke. The derrick crashed pinning Douglass. Douglass suffered damage to his kidneys, never regained his health and died in 1873. ( MLB note - He died in 1876.)\n\nIn November 1871 the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported the verdict on the coroner's jury into the accident. It stated \"Henry\" Doherty, John French and \"James McGonigle\" were killed on the 23 October \"by the breaking of the arm of a derrick on the new Bridge\". The paper stated that three men had died and four men were wounded. The deaths were ruled accidental.\n\nThe men ran in every direction when they realized what was happening. French and McGarrity were caught between the derrick and the stone work.\n\nSeveral articles say McGarrity had to be extracted from between the derrick and the stonework with a hydraulic jack.\n\nThe New York Herald ran a longer story and mentioned: Cornelius Lynch was \"injured internally by a piece of lumber striking him\", William Haines was injured in the spine, William Doherty may have suffered fatal injuries. William Doherty was thrown from a car on the trestle due to jarring of the platform as the stone which fell hit it. He fell 40 feet to the dock. Men on floats had a narrow escape as debris rained down. This article said that McGarrity, a married man, lived on Oxford street.\n\nThe Buffalo New York paper listed the dead as John French and James M. Gerrity. Injured: Thomas Douglas, Cornelius Lynch, William Hayes and Henry Dougherty. \"All were employed on the tower.\" (Same story carried in other New York cities.)\n\nBrooklyn Eagle October 24, 1871 listed dead: John French, of 11 Oxford street, and James McGarrity who lived on Boerum street both killed instantly. Both were said to be married men. Thomas Douglas, William Hines, Cornelius Lynch wrere listed as injured as were Robert Ast and Michael Mahon.\n\n*( Note : I cannot find a death record for Dogherty (or variations in spelling) in October or November 1871.)\n\nJohn Cook was said by another paper to be in the hospital following the incident.\n\n\"McGerrity\" was a stout man, who was crushed between the derrick and the stonework, was married and lived in Oxford street. John French was struck in the heard.\n\nWilliam Doherty who fell forty feet from the trestle to the dock was said to have died of his injuries.*\n\nSee also:\n\nThomas Talbot - accident - killed August 24, 1871 - rigger\n\nJohn Deneys fell February 25, 1872\n\nPatrick McKay, John Meyers, and Daniel Reardon died of Cassons Disease - April and May 1872\n\nJohn Enright - carpenter (c 1831-1872) - Killed - Accident April 1872\n\nCornelius McLaughlin was killed by falling stone June 28, 1872\n\nHensen/Hansen, Lourtz September 9, 1873 fell from bridge\n\nPeter Koop, April 4, 1873 - caught in Machinery\n\nWilliam Reid killed October 11, 1875\n\nJohn Mc Cann (McCorrmack) killed fell from bridge September 9, 1875\n\nJohn Elliott died when he fell from the bridge on May 17, 1876\n\nWilliam Cambridge\n\nWilliam Cambridge, a rigger, was hit by a falling debris on October 27, 1874.

Blake were killed on the bridge June 14, 1878 when a cable snapped - several others were injured\n\nHenry \"Lipple\" was the foreman of the gang. Holding onto a rope he was whirled up into the air and thrown clear of the anchorage. His fall was broken by wires that stretched across the yard. He fell head forward and received major gashes to his head. He was not expected to live.\n\nAn inquest was held on the deaths of Blake and Supple on June 21, 1878. Their deaths were deemed accidental. Four men: Henry \"Lipple\", Peter (or William B.) Arbuckel, Peter Erbig (Arbig/Arburg), and Thomas McGrath, were injured in the June 14th event.\n\nHenry Supple a former seafaring man once told a reporter that he felt as save on the tower and cables as he did on the ground. He was willing to except a challenge to cross the bridge hand over hand with no support but his own muscle for the mere sum of $100.\n\nThe men in other parts of the construction site returned to work to finish out the day.\n\nSeveral men were injured including: foreman Henry Lipple*, William R. Arbuckle, James McGrath (18 Monroe street) and Peter Raborg (Arbour)* (66 Columbia Place, Brooklyn). McGrath and Arbuckle, laborers, were severely bruised. McGrath was \"caught about the feet by the flying wire-rope\" and thrown backwards about 20 feet. It was initially reported that Henry \"Lipple\", the gang forman, was not expected to live. *Also listed as Thomas Arberg, same address and Peter Arburgh. *Surely a misprint of Supple.\n\nThomas Blake (315 Broome street), cable maker (or laborer), was killed outright either when his skull was crushed by the shoe at the end of the strand or when he was flung into the air and fell from the northern end of the anchorage. It was reported that he was single, however he did have a wife, Emily, who he married in 1872 and a son Charles born in 1872.\n\nW. E.

They were listed as: Chief Engineer John A. Roebling, John French, James Garrity, William Dougherty, McLoughlin, Enright, Brown, Cope, McCann, John Elliott, Reed, Neil Mullen, Harry Supple, Blake, Thomas Talbot, William Delaney, Michael Cullin, Thomas F Martin, Jacob MullerGeorge Pfenn, Higgins, Gardner, Murphy and Edward Hanson*. It was stated that funeral expenses of the workmen who were killed or died from injuries were paid by the trustees.\n\nNotes:\n\nIt was reported in 1894 that in the 13 years of construction on the bridge there had been 20 fatalities. The first was the death of John A. Roebling who died of tetanus from an injury.\n\nGleaned from a variety of sources are the following men who were said to have died during the construction of the bridge. Some may be duplicates. For instance \"Arbuckle\" was listed among the dead in the 1878 accident. But I believe the name was actually Arberg, who survived the 1878 accident and died in 1904.\n\nThere is a significant problem with the spelling of the Irish and German name and with the possibility of typos.\n\nHarry Supple was one of the most popular riggers on the bridge. He was a foreman of a gang of riggers, performed some remarkable high wire feats, and died in a fall in 1878. Several reports at the opening of the bridge in 1883 mention Harry \"Tupple\". News coverage of the 1878 accident also list Harry Lipple. I am sure both Tupple and Lipple should be \"Supple\". McGarigle who died in the 1871 accident was variously spelled McGerrity, MGarrity, McGangle, McGarigle and McGonigle.\n\nSee above. Said to have suffered from caissons disease from 1872 onwards.

The case was originally though to be one of suicide but Delaney, haunted by the ghost of the girl, had confessed to murder. On February 11, 1888 after an hour and a half deliberation, John Delaney was convicted of manslaughter in the first degree. His young brother had stood by him manfully though the trial. It was thought the judge would deal leniently with the sentence.\n\nThe New York Press said that his mother died shortly afterward while intoxicated and out of sympathy for his father's death John Delaney was taken on as a messinger by the Bridge management. A collection was taken up for the mother's funeral expenses but he took a girl to Coney Island and bridge Superintendent Martin payed for the funeral out of his own pocket. Delaney quit the bridge employment a few days later.\n\nAt the time of his December 1888 confession he was employed in Burke's restaurant at Fulton and bridge streets.

There was evidence that she had vomited a lot - both in her bedroom and in the kitchen. In the bed room the police found a half empty bottle of rat poison. The girl mistakenly though she was pregnant, a fact the autopsy refuted. She asked Delenay to get her something to end the pregnancy. John Delaney eventually told the police he had bought twelve cents worth of powered rat poison, called Rough on Rats, at a drug store. He put the poison in a bottle and mixed it with water. He gave the potion to Mary telling her it would help her but knowning it would kill her.\n\nEventually, in early December 1888, haunted by the memory, full of remorse, and yet again drunk, John J Delaney confessed to the murder of Mary Jane Cox. He said he had been seeing Miss Cox for about eight months and that they had gone to museums and amusement parks together. He had also \"betrayed\" her when they met at the Keystone House on Third ave, a 25 cent lodging house, where he worked at the time. He had promised to marry her but she said they were too young and they quarreled.\n\nJohn Delaney testified that he was drunk when he confessed to the murder. He said they had quarreled but he did not give her any poison, which according to the analysis was arsenic.\n\nAt the inquest testimony was given by: Mr. Joseph Bland and Mrs. Teresa Bland, Mary Jane's employers who she had worked for about 4 years, and Mary Jane's sister, Mrs. Mary Loring (or Dorring), who claimed she did not like John Delaney and the fact that her sister had been keeping company with him for about six months.\n\nMary Jane Cox, a servant girl age 18 (or 20), died on June 3, 1887 at 240 Prince street, Brooklyn. An autopsy revealed she die of \"corrosive poisoning\". Her boyfriend, John Delaney, was drunk when he confessed his culpability in June 1887. Later when he sobered up he denied his confession. He was jailed by the coroner's office, but after only twenty five minutes deliberation the Grand Jury failed to indict him and he was let go on June 24th.

Michael Collins fell from the superstructure near the Brooklyn tower. \"He was a rivet heater and walked off the planking.\" There was an investigation.\n\nCollins a riveter fell 120 feet from the Brooklyn tower.

Supple got on the chair with Carroll and they were both pulled back to the Brooklyn tower, leaving Timbs waiting in the middle. Timbs attached himself to the traveller and was pulled to safty.\n\nForty five minutes later Carroll again ran into trouble. Coming from opposite directions Carroll and another rigger, Patrick Timbs, met on the wire, and were joined together. The expectation was that they would be pulled together to the Brooklyn side. However, the wires and the traveller were twisted so they could not move. Supple traveled out to them hand over hand on the wire with a rope around his waist. The rope was attached to Carroll and Timms and the three were pulled to the tower.\n\nHe was cheered by the hundreds who watched in suspence.\n\nLater when a fellow rigger, Thomas Carroll, got into trouble and became stuck - unable to move either forward or backward - Harry Supple came to the rescue. Swinging hand over hand Supple went out about 100 feet, untangled Carroll and returned hand over hand. His own grip on the wire was his only support. He reached Thomas Carroll (a heavy set man - about 215 pounds) who was stuck behind the pulley bar as his chair was too large to pass. Upon reaching Carroll he helped him to cut the lashings that were restricting him. This accomplished Supple made his way back to his position on the top of the New York tower about 100 feet away.\n\nHanging from a boatswains chair (little more than a swing seat suspended by four ropes and attached to the traveller wire by an ring) Harry Supple started along the traveller cable. He had a piece of rope in one hand which he could use to slow his speed if he was moving too fast. He shot down the wire to the first lashing stopping himself with his rope. He sliced the lashings with a knife causing the cable to vibrage violently along its length. Undeterred he sped onto the next lashing and on to the entire 900 feet of the cable. The whole adventure took him ten minutes. Meanwhile down below anxious crowds watch the entire event. The other rigger was William Cohne who took 40 minutes to perform the same opperation.

A fatal accident involving the death of a laborer Neil MULLEN, aged forty-five, a widower, and the sole support of \"six\" children, occurred at 4:10 P.M., Saturday, at the Brooklyn Anchorage of the East River Bridge. It was occasioned by the fall of a brick arch. MULLEN was buried in the debris, and so shockingly mangled that his body was crushed almost out of human semblance. The remains were removed to the late residence of the deceased, No. 44 Front street. December 24, 1877\n\nA gang of workemen dug around for about ten minutes to find Mullen's body. He was lying flat on his face and his body and head were so mangled that it would have been impossible to identify him in any other circumstances.

Smith, concluded that McKay would have died soon anyway.\n\nAccording to David McCullough, Patrick McKay born in Ireland, age 50, died on Apirl 30, 1872 and was listed as the second Brooklyn Bridge fatality of the caissons disease. He had been working in the cassions for four months with no ill effect.\n\n1872 : Manhattan #114205 Meyer, John April 22, 1872, age 35, found at morgue native of Germany, congestion of the lungs worked 2 hours in caisson foot of Brooklyn one hour after coming out he died, congestion of lungs, laborer, single, in US 5 years, 33 Water Street buried Lutheran\n\n1872 : April 24, New York Times - An inquest was held on April 23 into the death of John Meyer, a German labour who died after coming out of the caisson of the East River Bridge at Roosevelt street. He was though to have died of a heard attack but the medical examination showed \"the lungs were intensely congested, and the death resulted from asphyxia. (a condition arising when the body is deprived of oxygen, causing unconsciousness or death; suffocation.)\n\nOne of the myths about the disease was that only those inured to working in the caisson did not succumb.\n\nWhen the Sun reporter was talking to the landlady two caisson workmen standing nearby opined that the air in the caisson affected only new men and the strongest and biggest men seemed to suffer the most.\n\nA reported visited the rooming house where the kindly landlady answered his questions. She said John Meyers was a large and heathy man who had been in the county for four years. Last summer he had broken his leg and was laid up for some time. He had not been able to find work and had run out of money. The landlady took pity on him and gave him a place to sleep and some food. The day before his death he applied for work at the caisson. He was taken down into the caisson 73 feet below the level of the river to test if he could stand the pressure. He came home and said he though he could do the work required although while he did not feel badly in the caisson his knees had trembled and he felt sick upon reaching the ground level. He felt well in the morning and went off to work. Only to return home that night and die almost immediately. An autopsy revealed congestion of the lungs, kidneys, and liver diseased, but though the death was by asphyxia. The lungs were firmly affixed to the walls of the chest by old adhesions. The lungs were very congested with the air cells being entirely full. All the other organs were healthy. The Bridge company said that Meyers had been examined by a company doctor and was not found to have any organic disease.\n\nA lengthier report in the New York Sun claimed that John Meyer only went into the caisson one time. He was described by them as a strong well built German age 35. He retuned to his \"German hotel\" on Water street complaining of weakness in the chest and stomach and trembling in his lower limbs. He was not able to stand and legs shook. He went to his room where he died of convulsion within a few minutess.\n\nThe stories of his sickness and death vary somewhat. One said he began work on Monday and after working only two and a half hours he was taken ill and soon died of asphyxia (lack of oxygen). Another report said he had been working nearly 100 feet below the surface and had begun to feel \"oppressed by the impurity of the air\". Upon arriving at the surface he died within a few minutes. Or that upon reaching the surface fainted, fell and died within a few minutes.\n\nJohn Meyers, a German laborer on the Brooklyn Bridge, was the first to die of the caisson disease in connection with the construction of the bridge.\n\n\"Deneiss\" killed no date.

The most \"notable\" accident was the 19th of June 1878 when a cable snapped.\"\n\nIn June 1883 the Watkins Express said that 20 lives had been lost during the building of the bridge: \"\n\nInjured During Construction of the Bridge\n\nHE SURVIVED THE FALL AND LIVED AT LEAST UNTIL 1930!!!!\n\nNY Times : May 5, 1896 \"Bridge Workman Seriously Injured\" - Edward Peterson, foreman of the riggers on the New York Terminal of the Brooklyn Bridge missed his footing and fell head first about 30 feet from a cross section of iron beams to the pavement below. He fractured his skull and both legs. He was first taken to the Hudson Street Hospital and then moved, at his request, to the Brooklyn City Hospital. He was working with his brother, Carl. Edward Peterson was 38 years old, married, and lived at 210 Elton street, Brooklyn.\n\nThe theory was that a mason had secretly placed dynamite and nitro-glycerine among the stones when the bridge was being built. John Parker or John Peterson were the suspended culprits.The article took a look at some of the masons who had worked on the building of the tower. No one named John Parker or John Peterson had been a mason on the bridge.\n\nThe workmen resumed their tasks on the Bridge, and fifteen minutes later another man was standing on the same perilous ledge, unconcernedly working and talking.\n\nPoliceman Dooley went to the injured man's assistance. Andersen raised his head, spoke to the policeman and became unconscious. The police cleared the women's waiting room and carried him in there. Matron McDonald attended him until the ar-rival of an ambulance. He was taken to the Brooklyn Hospital.\n\nThe passengers on the walk saw him suddenly totter, throw up his hands and fall off the ledge upon the promenade below. His foot had slipped. He struck head first. It is thought that his skull is fractured. His right arm and left leg were broken. His blood dyed the walk. Those who were hurrying through the promenade turned their faces and ran. Men crowded to the edge of the rail, where the rigger lay writhing and bleeding. The police hurried the crowds form the platform.\n\nAndersen was a Swedish sailor. He left off climbing towering masts at sea to work at dizzy heights on land. He was as surefooted as a chamois. He was walking along a narrow ledge about five inches wide talking with a rigger of his own name, who was assisting him in the removal of some temporary scaffolding. He looked above at the clear sky, glanced at the throng which surged past him and hummed a Swedish song as he worked. He was a sturdy fellow, and he bore his 200 pounds as lightly as he did his forty years of age.\n\nIt was the rush hour in the morning. Hundreds of persons were passing within a few feet of Andersen and saw him strike the hard asphalt pavement. He was at work near the stairway which is the main New York exit. From where he was standing he could have shaken hands with a man on the footway.\n\nEdward Andersen, veteran rigger, and, in point of service, the oldest employee of the New York and Brooklyn Bridge, fell from a height of thirty feet at the New York terminal yesterday and sustained fatal injuries.\n\nNine years before Peterson had tried to save a carpenter who had fallen on the train track of the bridge in front of an oncoming locomotive. He did not succeed. Both men were hit, the carpenter died and Peterson was sent flying. (Brooklyn Daily Eagle May 4, 1896)\n\nEdward Peterson, an employee of the Brooklyn Bridge since the construction had begun, slipped fell about 20 feet from the New York terminal to the promenade which was crowded with pedestrians. He had broken his left arm, left leg and fractured his skull. Peterson was married, age 40, address 210 Elton street, Brooklyn . He was not expected to live.\n\nAndersen - Petersen - a Swede - whatever. his name was Edward Peterson but a major story in the New York Herold called him Andersen. They got the address right.\n\nHis nose was cut off and he suffered other injuries.\n\nMarch 15, \"while hoisting a cornice in place on the iron work of the Sands street approach\" two men were thrown to the ground a distance of 60 feet. \"Jacob Muller\" of 225 North 6th street died instantly. William Warden of 46 Leonard street was seriously injured. (BDE).\n\nAs reported in other papers he is quoted as saying he was hard to kill and was not dead yet.\n\nThat Joseph Smith, age 36, escaped death was considered a miracle. Smith \"was flung horizontally from the bridge about 35 feet\" and then fell 65 feet to the ground on Front street. He was \"dreadfully bruised and torn, but did not lose consciousness\". He was examined by a physician who did not find any broken bones. He was taken home. New York Daily News December 20, 1881\n\nAn accident occurred yesterday afternoon at the anchorage of the East River bridge, on the Brooklyn side, which may cost Joseph Smith, one of the workmen, his life, although his escape from instant death is regarded as almost miraculous. (NY Times)\n\nMIRACULOUS: Suffered nothing more that some bruises and shock after 65 feet fall. It was expected he would be able to resume work in a \"couple of weeks\". BDE - December 20, 1881\n\nVERDICT AGAINS THE BRIDGE. - On January 24, 1880 \"Henry\" Hansen, a rigger, was assisting with the removal of some trestle-work. A foreman order the work cut at the opposite end of the trestle. Henry Hansen was thrown to the ground and both legs were borken. He sued the trustees of the Bridge for $10,000 and was awarded $5,000.\n\nA suit was brought to the Supreme Court in 1880 by Edward Hansan against the trustees of the bridge for injuries he sufferd when he fell from a scaffolding being taken down by a \"gang\" of which he was a member. \"A fellow rigger struck loose the piece of scaffolding Hansen was standing on.\" The Trustees defence was that the negligence was caused by a fellow employee not by the Bridge Commission.\n\nAnother version - Edward \"Hassen\" of 3 Harrison court Brooklyn, a workman on the bridge, fell from a trestle on the New York side 20 to the ground and broke both legs. January 25, 1880.\n\nThe men working on the bridge were strictly forbidden to drink on the job.\n\nNational Police Gazette: John Boyle John Boyle, a rigger employed in wrapping the cables of the East River Bridge, was seized with a fit on the Brooklyn tower. He was assisted by his companions and carried off the bridge and taken to City Hospital.It was stated that he had taken some Indian herbal medicine in an attempt to cure his rheumatism.\n\nDecember 20, 1878 John Boyde, a rigger on the bridge, suffered from convulsions while carrying clamps from the toolhouse on the tower. Six men carried him down from the tower to the anchorage. One of the workmen stated that recently Boyle had not been well. He had apparently been taken some herbal medicine. The doctor who saw him at the anchorage though Boyle had been taking some narcotic medicine. They took him to 276 Front street, but it turned out it was not his address. His address was 176 Front street where Boyde lived with his sister Mrs. McDonald. Boyde was staken to the hospital where he was in \"very critical condition\". Boyde was not married and until his employment on the bridge he had been at sea.\n\n1879 : October 14, Brooklyn Eagle reported the trustees of the bridge awarded $100 to David \"Parrent\" whose \"leg was broken by one of the cars on the bridge.\n\n1879 : Brooklyn Eagle reported on October 14, 1879 that the trustees of the bridge awarded $100 to David Parent who was injured in July.\n\nHerbert Stuart was also a carpenter.

He was examined by the company doctor and sent home - 66 columbia place.\n\n1878 : June 16 New York Times reported Peter \"Raborg\" of 66 Columbia place, Brooklyn was visited by a doctor and was found to be doing well under the circumstances. His injuries were compared to those of a \"inflicted by the concussion of air from a passing canon ball.\" There was no abrasion, no swelling of the injured area. Only two small pink lines to show where he had been hit. However, there was the most intense pain in the leg.\n\nThere was an accident on the bridge June 15, 1878 when some hemp ropes and partially constructed cable broke and men went flying on the New York end of the bridge. A strand of No. 4 cable composed of about 400 wires and weighing about 49 tons released around noon and went crashing into the river sending af50 foot fountain of water into the air. It narrowly escaped hitting the ferry, the Farragut. One man was killed outright and another was so badly hurt he was expected to die. Henry Lipple the foreman of the gang handling the rope was thrown into the air. Wounded were: Thomas McGrath, William B. Arbuckle, and Peter Erbig.\n\n1878 : Treated and sent home June 15, New York Times - June 16 New York Times, reported that McGrath was doing very well and his early recovery was looked for.\n\nJames McGrath (18 Monroe street) was \"caught about the feet by the flying wire-rope\" and thrown backwards about 20 feet. An Assistant foreman on the New York side close to Cherry street. Thrown 20 feet and the soles of his shoes were torn off.\n\nI believe that this is a misprint of \"Supple\". See Harry Supple.\n\nAs a cable was about to be lifted from the river to the tower strain caused it to leap out of its grove. It struck a portion of the timber famework and sent a heavy plank flying. The plank hit James O'Neil, struck him in the hip and knocked him senseless. It was a miracle that he was not thrown from the tower to the river. He was carried down from the tower by fellow workmen. After an examination by a physician he was sent home in a carriage. His condition the next day was said to be serious, with swelling in the groin and limb, inflamation having set in. He was one of the most skilled laborers employed at the Bridge and was \"universally liked\" by his fellow workers and the engineers on site. A rigger by trade, he was one of the men who cut the lashings on the cables. (Brooklyn Daily Union September 15, 1876) In February 1877 the Chief Engineer Farrington spoke to a reporter about the men he most trusted on bridge. He mentioned William Gardner as an experienced rigger.\n\nThe incident was reported in the Report of the Chief Engineer of the New York & Brooklyn Bridge - James O'Neil was injured by a plank which was thrown against him by a falling rope. The accident was the only one that happened while the rope wires were being pulled out over the bridge.\n\nNew York Times September 15, 1876 A cable slipped out of a grove in a pulley and fell with a crash on some blocks of wood at the top of the pier. One of these blocks of wood was hurled with great force hitting James O'Neil, a laborer, on the upper thigh near the hop. He sufferd \"intense pain\" but no broken bones. Three men carried him down and a carriage was ordered to take him home at 16 York street, Brooklyn.\n\nThe report of the Chief Engineer stated that James O'Neil was injured at this time by a plank which was thrown by a falling rope. It was recorded as the only accident that occurred while the wires were being drawn across in August-September 1876.\n\nA tid bit in an article in The Graphic (November 16) about the transfer of the wires across the bridge in 1876 discribes O'Neil thus \"this man is represented in the buggy lying on his back, smoking and taking matters as cooly at a height of 288 feet as if he were lying on a sofa at home.\" There were two men in the \"buggy\": \"O'Neill\" and Timbs.\n\nListed as one of the riggers who cut the lashes when the wires were brought across in 1876. On August 30, 1876 he and a fellow workman, Fred Arnold, got stuck on the wires midway between Manhattan and Brooklyn. Somehow the two men went out on the wrong wires which became entangled. They were forced to cut loose their chairs and change wires 185 feet above the river. See Arnold.\n\nThe incident was mentioned agin in the Brooklyn Eagle on July 29th, 1872. The article dealt in part with the reaction to the extreme heights at which the men were working and he feeling that there is nothing between one and \"the stepping off place.\" The workmen on the towers had become accustomed to the height and moved about as feely as they did on the ground.\n\n10 July 1872 Brooklyn Eagle: There were two holes in both towers, each one hundred and three feet deep and ninteen by thirty feet wide. George Harris missed his footing and fell down one of these holes. As the men rushed to the shaft expecting to find Harris' mangled body, they saw Harris standing in the darkness. A derick was swung around and a rope lowered. Harris tied the rope around himself and was hoisted up. He suffered a cut over his one eye but no bones were broken. It was beleived that three or four feet of water in the hole saved his life. He was taken to the city Hospital in good condition.\n\nFrank Harris (or George Harris) of 195 Pearl street, fell 103 feet and escaped with little injury. Harris was standing by a derrick when a rope he was holding slipped out of a groove. He though it was broken and let go of the rope. He fell head over heels to the well 103 feet below. He crashed into an empty cement barrel that was floating in three feet of water. Fellow workers lower a rope to him. He tied it around his waist and was hoisted out of the well. He was taken to the hospital but no broken bones were found. July 10, 1872\n\nSUDDEN DEATH - Ann Higgins age 50 was found dead in her bed at her residence 315 Hamilton ave. She had been ailing for some days. Inquest to be held.\n\nThe work of excavating the caisson was almost completer on the New York side when Edward Dougherty, a laborer in the caisson was severely burned around the face and eyes by a premature discharge of a blast. He was Taken to Park Hospital.\n\nSamuel Mitchell, a laborer in the caisson, was taken by wagon to Centre Street Hospital from the Caisson of the East River Bridge, suffering from cramps and neuralgia. He experienced violent pains in his limbs but no difficulty breathing. He was completely bent over and appeared to be in great agony. He had been working in the caissons for some time. He lived at 19 (or 10) State street. \"The engineers claim that the air is just as pure inside the caisson as outside.\" (BDE)\n\nMay 3, 1872: NY Times - William White a laborer in the East River caisson fell prostrated by paralysis on Ewen street while on his was home from work \"the effect of the foul atmosphere in which he had been working.\".\n\nOwen Felder or Feilder of 111 Mulberry st feet badly hurt - h foot crusehd by a piece of lumber.

MLB But I have not found his death record.\n\nA New York Times article about the incident said: William Haines had his spine so badly hurt that \"his life is despaired of.\"\n\nAn 1878 article about workemn on the bridge referred to \"Con\" Lynch who helped lay the first course of stones on the Brooklyn tower. He and William Connelly were said to have know every mason who worked on the bridge. (New York Sun)\n\nSeptember 29, 1970 - New York Times - a laborer, Barney Rooney, was burned in the face and breast. \"Mr. Wm Card\" \"received a slight wound in the breast.\"\n\nBrooklyn Daily Union, September 28, 1870: The surgeons said \"his sight may possibly be saved.\" Before it was discovered exactly what had happened the noise and confusion caused the the men to panic. The engineers \"were on hand promptly, and soon, succeeded in allaying the excitement.\" The wounds of the injured man were dressed, he was taken home and the other men returned to their work.\n\nSeptember 29, 1970 - New York Times - a laborer, Barney Rooney, was badly burned on his chest, face and eyes following an explosion of powder in the Fulton street caisson of the Brooklyn Bridge. He was ramming a powder charge into a rock so it could be blasted when the powder exploded. He was taken to City Hospital where it was feared he would lose his eyesight. He was referred to as \"Rooney\" not Mr. Rooney. Whereas, another worker was referred to as \"Mr. Wm Card\" who \"received a slight wound in the breast.\"\n\nBridge Workers\n\nA second traveler was set up and the two travelers were used to bring more and more wires from one side of the river to the other. Next a wooden foot bridge was built from tower to tower.\n\nMore ropes were lashed to the traveler and moved along from one side to the other. The lashing had to be cut loose by hand with a knife. This was done by riggers sitting in a boatswains chair (little more than a swing on a hook). There were four men cutting the lashings On August 26, 1876. One man started from the top of each tower going towards the anchorage and one man form the top of the tower going towards the middle of the river. Cohne (Korner) started first going from the Booklyn tower towards the anchorage. Henry (Harry) Supple accomplished this with great flair but others got hung up as they tired to move along the ropes. In addition to Henry Supple who died in an accident in 1878 (see above) several riggers were named in the Chief's report on the bridge: William Kohrner (Cohne), a German, Patrick Timbs, an Englishman, Thomas Carroll an Englishman, on the first rope and William Miller, Frederick Arnold, James O'Neil (see James O'Neil under the injured) and E. F. Farrington on the second rope.\n\nRiggers Harry Supple, William Kohrner, Frederick Arnold, James O'Neill, William Miller, Patrick Timbs and Thomas Carrol were all sailors who had never done rigging quite like bringing the cables across the Brooklyn Bridge towers.\n\nIn 1883 it was stated that the daily wage of a rigger was $2.00 to $2.50.The were paid less than stone cutters, masons and carpenters who made a dollar a day morre.\n\nCohne (Kohrner/Korner), William - a German, rigger 1876 (c 1839-1898) Spelled: Cohne in the Report of the Chief Engineer and in the newspaper reports of the unlashing of the cables - \"Kohrne\" by McCollough and in the news report in the Brooklyn Union August 26, 1876 - Koenhner in a Brooklyn Eagle article about the riggers cutting the lashings. 1875 : Brooklyn Ward 2, Sands Street, 4 family frame house, William Cohne 36, rigger born Germany, Hannah Cohne 35, wife, born Brooklyn, Hortense Hura 50, mother in law, born New Jersey, seamstress 1876 : Brooklyn Union - William Kohrner, a rigger, in the employ of the bridge was one of the men to cut the lashings with sceath knife. 1880 : Brooklyn, 68 Prospect street, William Cohn 40, rigger born Oldenburg, \"Augusta\" Cohn 40, born New York, father born Conn, mother born NJ, \"Angela\" Hurt 60, mother in law, born N J, father born Italy, mother born NY and a boarder. 1881-1889 : William Cohne 68 Prospect Occupation: Rigger Publication Title: Brooklyn, New York, City Directory, 1889 In August 1876 Willam Cohne was in one of the first group of riggers cutting the lashings as the wires were drawn across the bridge. The feat of riding in a boatswains's chair along the travler rope and cutting the lashings, which held the new wire to the travler, was watched by hundred of spectators on the ground. The press extensively covered the activities. Some of the riggers, like Harry Supple, became momentary heros and the crowds watched with awe and anticipation as the men made their way across the wire, dangling high in the air. William Cohne was portrayed as portly and slow - taking much longer than the other riggers to cut the lashings. In the news papers his name was spelled with such a large number of variations one cannot help but wonder if this did not reflect an anti German sentiment. \"Korner\" was observed by a reporter through a telescope - \"his progress was slow and laborious, and from the expression on his face was evidently hard work.\" He was suspended 200 feet in the air sitting on a board without being lashed into the seat.
