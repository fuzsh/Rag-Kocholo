The cats make breakfast for the family and head to Fluffy's Foods, where they meet the owner, Fluffy. They are tasked with stocking shelves and are cashiers. Sunny misbehaves by eating cookies and slacking off, causing a conflict with Rishi. Later, Sunny annoys customers with his attitude but eventually learns to assist them properly. Rishi gets stuck in the freezer, and Sunny has to call Fluffy to rescue him. Despite the chaotic day, they discuss their next career moves and look forward to new adventures."
