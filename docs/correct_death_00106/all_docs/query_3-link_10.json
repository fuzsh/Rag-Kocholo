    "text": "Guests to San Francisco's Westin St Francis Hotel still ask to see the room where an infamous bootleg-booze-soused party took place 90 years ago.\n\nThe management are happy to show visitors the suite, if it's unoccupied, but they don't know exactly what happened in there on Labor Day in 1921 - no-one does.\n\nOne thing is clear: In Room 1219 that afternoon, an actress by the name of Virginia Rappe was screaming in agony on a bed.\n\nLater that week she was dead.\n\nAnd the man charged with her death was Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle, Hollywood's first one-million-dollar star."
