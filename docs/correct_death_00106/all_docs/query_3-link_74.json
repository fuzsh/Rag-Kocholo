    "text": ">Virginia Rappe had 8 abortions? So much for the theory some people hold that the gilded age was an age of 'innocence'.\n\n\n\nVirginia Rappe was a rather sad woman. In addition to her multiple abortions she had at least one out of wedlock child. Minta Durfee, silent star (and the first Mrs Arbuckle) mentioned, often, that after Virginia did bit work at Sennett they had to fumigate the studio because of a certain \"problem\" she introduced. The woman who brought her to the party, Maude Delmont, was a \"professional correspondent\" which- in those days- meant a womam who could be paid to testify against your husband in a divorce trial or, if need be, be \"caught\" on film in a compromising position with said husband for sure fire divorce fodder. Several delivery men claimed that Virginia had \"enticed\" them and then screamed rape. Fatty did not want her, or Maude Delmont at the party and tried to have them ejected at least twice. Virtually all of his friends later said the same thing, that their reaction was \"with HER?\" (with an EWWWW inflection) when the story broke. In some of her film work she is quite attractive, in others (the easily found Isle of Love comes to mind) she has a puffy quality one associates with too much alcohol. The year before she died she was voted \"Best Dressed Girl in Pictures,\" but whether she could have gone from featured player to star is hard to tell from what survives. Much of what was written about her in 1921/22/23 was sentimental garbage, most of what has been written about her since the rediscovery of the original case files has been judgmental and, at times, quite vicious....some authors have forgotten that, whatever her morals may have been, she did not deserve to be kept in a hotel room away from doctors (by Maude Delmont, not Fatty) until she was too sick to be saved."
