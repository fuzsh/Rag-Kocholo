        "text": "I just watched an amazing collection of silent comedies starring the team of Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle and Buster Keaton.\n\nIn the early days of silent film, this was a match made in heaven.\n\nThe movies covered the years 1917-1920.\n\nAs far as I'm coincerned, the Arbuckle/Keaton films were much funnier than any of the Harold Lloyd or Charlie Chaplin films.\n\nBy 1920, Fatty Arbuckle had a million doallar a year contract- a fortune back then (akin to the ridiculously high salaries of actors today).\n\nBut scandal destroyed his career. Around 1921, Arbuckle was entertaining some friends at a hotel, and a young female came calling...she was soon rushed to a hospital and died, due to a ruptured bladder & infection.\n\nThe press assumed Arbuckle raped her, and his 250 pound weight crushed her- he was arrested, tried for murder-but was found not guilty.\n\nThe press tore him to shreds....\n\nHollywood dropped him like a hot potato...\n\nBut Buster Keaton went on to have a very successful career...\n\nAny other Arbuckle/Keaton fans?\n\nRegards\n\nTarn Stephanos\n\nKeaton yes, Arbuckle not really.\n\nPoor Virginia Rappe (who you can see in Isle of Love which has survived and is available on video) was held in her room at the St. Francis, by her friends, for two or three days before medical help was summoned. By the time she was taken to the hospital she was suffering from overwhelming sepsis and, semi coherent, asked her nurses where she could get a good abortion. Which would have been her eighth. One can venture a guess as to what really happened before she collapsed at that party.\n\nHollywood didn't exactly drop Fatty. His career was beginning to slide even before the scandal. Post trial, the studios were ambivalent about his return. Ultimately $ won out, for there was no great public demand for his comeback. He made a depressing cameo in Hollywood (1923) appearing in a scene in which the young hopeful heroine is waiting on line at a studio- the head of the casting department brusquely informs her \"no work\" and slams his window shut. She turns to the next person on the line, who is Fatty Arbuckle playing himself, and he shrugs sadly. The scene did not test well with audiences and was cut.\n\nThanks for the info Jim!\n\nVirginia Rappe had 8 abortions? So much for the theory some people hold that the gilded age was an age of 'innocence'.\n\nDid Keaton ever reflect on his impressions of his time working with Arbuckle?\n\nI wonder of they got along, or were they like Abbot and Costello, who off camera hated each other?\n\nBuster Keton must have had the strength of a horse..his flips and movements could rarely be duplicated by even the fittest of athletes..\n\nJackie Chan regards him as a great influence...\n\nThere is a great Twilight Zone episode starring an elderly Buster Keaton (involving time travel),and the 1890s sequences were filmed in the same style as the early silent Keaton films.\n\nWhat was Keaton's first solo starring role?\n\nYou might know this Jim- What was the silent Keaton film where he is inside a ship in rough waters, and the cabin keeps flipping over and over?\n\nregards\n\nTarn Stephanos\n\n>Virginia Rappe had 8 abortions? So much for the theory some people hold that the gilded age was an age of 'innocence'.\n\nVirginia Rappe was a rather sad woman. In addition to her multiple abortions she had at least one out of wedlock child. Minta Durfee, silent star (and the first Mrs Arbuckle) mentioned, often, that after Virginia did bit work at Sennett they had to fumigate the studio because of a certain \"problem\" she introduced. The woman who brought her to the party, Maude Delmont, was a \"professional correspondent\" which- in those days- meant a womam who could be paid to testify against your husband in a divorce trial or, if need be, be \"caught\" on film in a compromising position with said husband for sure fire divorce fodder. Several delivery men claimed that Virginia had \"enticed\" them and then screamed rape. Fatty did not want her, or Maude Delmont at the party and tried to have them ejected at least twice. Virtually all of his friends later said the same thing, that their reaction was \"with HER?\" (with an EWWWW inflection) when the story broke. In some of her film work she is quite attractive, in others (the easily found Isle of Love comes to mind) she has a puffy quality one associates with too much alcohol. The year before she died she was voted \"Best Dressed Girl in Pictures,\" but whether she could have gone from featured player to star is hard to tell from what survives. Much of what was written about her in 1921/22/23 was sentimental garbage, most of what has been written about her since the rediscovery of the original case files has been judgmental and, at times, quite vicious....some authors have forgotten that, whatever her morals may have been, she did not deserve to be kept in a hotel room away from doctors (by Maude Delmont, not Fatty) until she was too sick to be saved."
