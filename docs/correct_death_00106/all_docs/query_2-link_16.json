    "text": "The Tragic Real-Life Story Of Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle\n\nWe tend to assume that fame and fortune in Hollywood naturally leads to decadence and scandal. When famous actors are caught doing terrible things, we might be horrified, we might be angry, but we're rarely shocked or surprised. We also tend to think that \"cancel culture\" is a new phenomenon. But a hundred years ago, the Fatty Arbuckle situation topped years of scandals. It changed the way the public saw the movies and the people in them, and forced the young Hollywood film industry to take the first steps towards self-censorship in an effort to reassure everyone that it wasn't teeming with immoral, awful people. One of the first things the film industry did in its efforts at damage control was to literally cancel Arbuckle, banning him from working in films at all.\n\nIn 1921, Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle was one of the biggest and best-paid stars in the world. Today he's almost completely forgotten. But Arbuckle's story is remarkable in how little has changed in the intervening century. As a society, we still struggle to reconcile our worship of the famous with the human flaws of celebrities, and we still struggle to pick the truth out of a swirl of sensational rumor. That's why it's worth revisiting the tragic real-life story of Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle."
