    "text": "Minta Durfee, the actress who was married to Roscoe (Fatty) Arbuckle and became Charlie Chaplin's first motionpicture leading lady, died Tuesday in Woodland Hills, a Los Angeles suburb.\n\nMiss Durfee, who was 85 years old, died of a heart ailment at the Motion Picture Country Home.\n\nIn recent years, she had been a regular performer on television, and over the years she had appeared in minor roles in such pictures as “How Green Was My Valley,” “Naughty Marietta,” “Rose Marie,” “The Unsinkable Molly Brown” and “It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.”\n\nMiss Durfee, who was born in Los Angeles, entered show business in local companies as a chorus girl at the age of 17. She met Mr. Arbuckle, then also trying out for a career in the theater, and began a courtship that led to marriage in August, 1908.\n\nThe two entered the thenrising motion‐picture field as members of Mack Sennett's comedy troupe. Mr. Chaplin joined the company in 1914, fresh from his triumphs in British music halls, and Miss Durfee was his leading lady in “Making a Living,” a two‐reeler, one of his first films, in 1914."
