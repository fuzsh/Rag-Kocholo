    "text": "The final chapterreinterprets the industry’s first so-called canonical sex scandal, the “Fatty” Arbuckle scandal, as an explosive round in ongoing debate about the relationship between motion pictures and the rise of sexual modernism. It does this by restoring Virginia Rappe—the actress who fell ill during Arbuckle’s party and died days after it—to the center of the scandal’s production, a place she occupied at the time. The dominant narrative of the scandal, which emergedquickly in the sensational press, shoehorned the event into a traditional melodrama of sexual danger, casting Rappe as a degraded, fallen woman and Hollywood as modernity’s scapegoat. This narrative aided those who sought to exert more control over the presentation of bohemian Hollywood and its girls, including censorship activists, moralists, women’s club reformers, and film producers."
