This story was related to Ronald Ray Akin by his aunt, Floy Medora Akin Garner. Floy was granddaughter of Florence King, great granddaughter of Mary Jane Fisher. She would have gotten the story from Florence, who lived until Floy was 33 years old. Florence was 9 when her father died, so she probably had reliable memories. The above is written pretty much how Floy told the story to my cousin, Ronald Ray Akin. Floy died in 1960 and she told Ronnie the story in the late 1950s when he was about 20. Ronnie relayed the story to me about 1976; he died in 1990.\n\n265. National Archives and Records Service, Washington, D.C.; Confederate Service Records, Mississippi 1st Light Artillery.\n\n266.
