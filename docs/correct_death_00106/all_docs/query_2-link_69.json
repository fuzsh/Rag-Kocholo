While at Keystone, Arbuckle appeared in a handful of films with Charles Chaplin during his work there in 1914, notably The Rounders (1914).\n\nArbuckle began work as an independent producer for Joseph Schenck under the Comique Film Corporation banner on 1 January 1917. During his years at Comique, Arbuckle brought vaudeville star Buster Keaton into his first film work.\n\nHis career as a top comedian was cut short by an infamous scandal surrounding the death of actress Virginia Rappé in September 1921. His third trial was scheduled to begin on 13 March 1922.\n\nDirected under the pseudonym William Goodrich in the late 1920s through 1931.
