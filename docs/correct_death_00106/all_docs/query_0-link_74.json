Clark and Benjamin Clark who are on the 1840 C through the 1870 C in Calhoun Co. John was a planter in Jacksonville and Benjamin was a \"Hotel Keeper\" on the 1860. My GGG Grandfather, William B. Clark b VA came to Calhoun Co. in 1870 from Harris Co. Ga. He was living near Benjamin Clark in Oxford or Dearmanville. William B. Clark's son, John Thomas Clark had come to this area on 1860 C as well as possibly his stepson, James Clark. I've just learned of the Seven Springs Cemetery in Jacksonville where a lot of Clarks are buried. Could someone tell me what would be cemeteries in the Oxford-Dearmanville area where Benjamin Clark and his family might be buried???

The 1900 U.S. census of the Chickasaw Nation, I.T., shows\n\nthat John Lord immigrated to the U.S. in 1862 and was naturalized in Pennsylvania. This was noted under the \"Citizenship\" category. He and Syntha (sic) were recorded in Twp. 4S, Range 1E, which appears to be just east of Lone Grove.\n\nThe index of Texas deaths shows that one C.M. Lord d. 28 Jul 1920 in Wichita Co., TX (certificate no. 24314). I tried to look up the cert.\n\nbut nos. 24001 to 25000 were missing on the microfilm.

It's so nice to know who you're talking to (again).\n\nCynthia Martha may be related to the Okie Nell bunch, but probably not closely. I do not have any record of a Mary Etta Gammon or any Gammon who married a Clark. I have corresponded with Charlotte Jarrell in the past. I am not sure if she made the connection between the Clark who posted the photo and the Clark who married her GG-grandfather. I think she just wanted to share. That's just a guess.\n\nDid I send you the information from Cynthia Martha's death certificate?\n\nI thought I had looked it up (28 Jul 1920 - Wichita Co., TX), but I cannot find my notes. I recently found her on the 1910 census in Fisher Co., TX, with her son-in-law, Charles C. Elrod (?). Does any of this help? Let me know.

This John Truesdale was born about 1720 in County Down, Ireland and died about 1791 near Canonsburg, PA. This is close to Pittsburgh. He immigrated in 1771 with his grown-up family . They first settled in Cumberland County, PA on 200 acres on Sharman's Creek. He appears on tax lists and in the 1790 census in Cumberland County. He sold 322 acres on Sharman's Creek in 1791 and moved to Canonsburg where he died the same year. The second generation seemed to have kept together and moved on to Ohio.

My ancester was Samuel who came from England, but I printed out the Irish geneology, which my distant cousin Paul used to have on a website. According to it, John Truesdale of Kinghill, Clonduff, County Down, Ulster, Ireland came to America with his family aboard the brigantine \"Free Mason\" in 1772, and settled in South Carolina.\n\nIt's believed that the Irish branch descended from an English Truesdale Cromwellian soldier who settled into Ireland following his service. That would make you also my extemely distant cousin, as our families would merge somewhere back in England. The surname Truesdale ( with variations ) is a quite old one that has been traced to the area of Lincolnshire, England at the beginning of the 14th century.\n\nMy ancester Samuel and two of his sisters were evidently sent to America around 1654, by their parents, to live with their uncle in Newton, Mass. This was apparently done to save the children from the bubonic plague that was once again present in England, and from the civil unrest that accompanied it's resurgence, the entire family being unable to afford the passage. The rest of their family never did make it to America. But many lived to perpetuate the family in England.\n\nSamuel's descendant's lived in the northern states and John's in the southern. Needless to say that the family unbeknowst to any of them found themselves on opposite sides in the American Civil War. John's family became prosperous plantation owners with many slaves. There is therefore a 3rd line of Truesdale's in America, this one being an African American one. Whether related by blood, or only by name, I don't know; since it was customary for slaves to use the surname of their plantation owner.\n\nI hope you find all of this as interesting as I did. I'm not sure what happened to Paul's website. He was in the process of moving it to another server on the web when it just vanished. In a lot of respects, I found the Irish American branch to be more interesting then the English one. No wonder the stereo-types persist. We are a little \"dry\" I fear.\n\nYour Distant American Cousin,\n\nShirley (Truesdale) Lockwood\n\n/revdead.html#anchor288289\n\nAmerican Prisoners of the Revolution: Names of 8000 Men\n\nBartholomew Wallace\n\nJohn Wallace\n\nJoseph Wallace\n\nThomas Wallace (2)\n\nThis list of names was copied from the papers of the British War Department.

Elrod of 1308\n\nThe Elrod and Lerchenzeiler families were almost surely German in origin. Johan Dider Elrod and his wife, Maria Magdalena Lerchenzeiler, were listed among the so-called \"fifth party\" of Palatines that sailed from Holland to London, England on 15 Jul 1709. Maria Magdalena was the daughter of Johan Wilhelm Lerchenzeiler and his wife, Susanna Catharina, both of whom were also listed as members of the fifth party. Since Dider and Maria Magdalena were married at the time they sailed for London, it is highly probable that the Elrods and Lerchenzeilers came from the same village in Germany. Now, the communicant records of of Holy Trinity (Old Swedes) Church in New Castle County, Delaware have been transcribed by Courtland B. and Ruth L. Springer in \"Delaware History,\" published by the Historical Society of Delaware, Old Town Hall (Wilmington DE, 1952-53), Vol. 5. In a footnote to their transcriptions, Courtland and Ruth Springer note that the faithful communicant, Johan Wilhelm Lerchenzeiler, was sometimes erroneously recorded in the records as \"John Hindrich Lerchenzeiler,\" and sometimes simply as \"Lerchenzeiler,\" or \"the GERMAN Lerchenzeiler.\" [emphasis my own]. So, from the Old Swedes communicant records, we know Lerchenzeiler was a German and from this we can deduce that Elrod was also. Where were they from? A possible answer can be found in in a German manuscript entitled, \"Stamm Baum, Der Frankischen Linnie Der Familie Ellrod,\" which I believe loosely translates to \"Family Tree of the Franconia Line of the Ellrod Family.\" This book or play was dedicated to Count Phillip Andreas Von Ellrodt in 1763. Information in this manuscript indicates the Elrod family may have originated in the area of the Principality of Bayreuth, bordering the Upper Franconia (or Bavarian) Palatinate. The account in this manuscript begins with a Jacob Ellrod b. 7 Nov 1601, who was a tailor in Culmbach (Kulm) located in middle Franconia. Another clue to the German origin of the Elrod and Lerchenzeiler families may be found in the will of Johan Wilhelm Lerchenzeiler dated 5 Sep 1745 and proved 29 Jun 1747. This will mentions his son-in-law Johan Michael Sigmund. The name John Michel Sigmund can be found in the second list of Palatines taken at Walworth, England 27 May 1709 where he is listed as a baker, age 27 (b.c. 1682) accompanied by a wife and son age 1 year old. This suggests the possibility that Sigmund had married a daughter of Lerchenzeiler while they were still living in Germany and that they too probably lived in the same village or area. German church records mention a Johannes Michael Sigmon. Two different dates of christening are mentioned for him. One is 14 Jan 1710, the other 22 Oct 1713. His parents are listed as Bartholomaei and Anna Eva Bayern, Ffalz, Kuebelbe. This later John Michael Sigmon may be a relative of the son-in-law of Lerchenzeiler. Also interesting is a record of the emigration to Pennsylvania in 1751 of a John Michael Lerchenzeiler.\n\n6. iii. JAMES ALBERT TRUESDELL, b. 09 Aug 1873, Abilene, Taylor Co.

Thanks.\n\nMary,\n\nI have quite a bit of info. back to Rowan NC on the Brawleys. Their info. was recorded very well until later. Hugh Brawley was one of the original Brawleys in NC and the only one who spelled Brawley this way. John and Easter Dickey Brawley had several children, some of who went to Arkansas. Hugh P. Brawley and Ruth Dreskell had a son named Prior (lots of info. before Prior but not much on Prior) who went to Arkansas and he is the father of my Hugh Brawley. I don't know Prior Brawleys wifes name or all of their childrens names. It is believed that they had 10 children. Hugh Prior Brawley, Jesse Brawley and John Brawley are the only ones that I know of for sure. What makes things bad is that John and Easter Dickey had children named John and Hugh in Arkansas. Maybe even some of the other Brawleys and its hard to figure out which ones belong to whom. Most of them are related somehow. There are some named Joseph. Have you checked out . If not go there and click on search and put in Hugh Brawley and go to the pedigrees and it will give you quite a bit of information. I appreciate your leads. I know I have heard of Martha Malone and I think her line with Hugh Brawley is recorded at Several of my Brawley line were in Love County, Oklahoma. I believe I saw Guve Brawley buried in the same cemetery as Albert A. Brawley but will need to check to be sure.\n\nThanks,\n\nSharon\n\nOK did not become a state until November 1907, it was Indian/\n\nOklahoma Territory before then but it wasn't Indian/Oklahoma Territory until 1830's when the Indians migrated to this part of the country from MS & AL....There are very few records before the land rushes in Oklahoma Territory..There was an 1860 census of Lands West of Arkansas Territory, then an 1896 census in Oklahoma/IndianTerritories.....These were two different territories with Oklahoma Territory being in the western half of what is now Oklahoma State & Indian Territory being in the eastern part of what is now Oklahoma state..\n\nThe Oklahoma Historical Society in Oklahoma City has some records before statehood..And it is my understanding they have some of the earlier census..\n\n/th/read/OK-CENSUS-LOOKUP/2001-06/0993863741\n\nMary,\n\nI left you a message on genforum but thought I should send this one to you via email.

He worked in the penitientiary as a elevator boy in the hospital. He was born in Arkansas and it lists the United States for place of birth for both Father and Mother. You might want to contact them and get his records and maybe it would tell you more. If you find out his parents names I would appreciate it if you would pass it on to me since I believe he was either a brother or cousin to my ggrandfather. You might want to see if Emma was living with one of her relatives during the 1920 census.\n\nThanks,\n\nSharon\n\n/cgi-bin/pageload.cgi?William,Joseph,Brawley::brawley::377.html\n\nBraley/Brawley/Brailaigh/O'Brallachan/ Research\n\nPosted by: Joyce Brawley Date: October 07, 2001 at 10:08:05\n\nof 507\n\nI am researching the Braley/Brawley Family with various other spellings as follows..Braly/Brally/Bralley/Braily/Brailey/Brayley/Broly/Brolley/Bralaigh/Brailegh/Bralachan/Brayley/Braylye, You may also find the name with \"O\" in front, such as O'Braley, etc.\n\nOur family ledgend is that the family was supposed to have originated from Glasgow or Edinberg, Scotland to Ulster, Londonderry (aka Derry) County, Ireland. The family was connected to the O'Neill family in Ireland, possibly soldiers of the Kingdom Of O'Neill.\n\nIt is said that there was six brothers, John, James, William, Thomas, were some of the names.

North Carolina?,\n\nThe history of the Brawley name and its variations is taken from ?The Bralys. A Saga of the Old South and West?, by David Braly.\n\n??The Clan of O?Brolaigh is a branch of the Ui Neill family, the origins of which are shrouded in myth and legend. For those who are interested, the genealogy assigned to the Ui Neill by the medieval monks, genealogists, and poets, trace the Ui Neill back to Adam and Eve. This genealogical connection, for those who would like this detailed information, can be found in THE BRALYS book at some of the local libraries. Ireland has the third oldest collection of family records in the world, dating back to the 4th century.?\n\nDespite the strife, struggled, fighting and great loss of life in Irish history, The O?Braleigh Clan managed to maintain a position of honor and hold on to their lands and considerable wealth during many of those years. During a civil war in the 17th century, the English took control of Ireland, setting up new legal systems, confiscating land of the Irish and selling it to English businessmen. They were called Undertakers, and were expected to build and maintain castles, whereupon, Irish tenants were forbidden. Other lands were occupied by the Scots, who did allow Irish tenants. Some of the poorer lands were allowed for Irish farmers.\n\nHowever, for some reason, this did not include the County Derry where the O?Braleigh Clan lived. In a grant from the Earl of Tyrone, The\n\nClan O?Brally was provided a safeguard against further confiscation of their lands.\n\n?All Irish were forced to modernize and get away from the old, old way of life that they had followed for a thousand years. After the War the\n\nculture shift was augmented and many of the clans dropped the ?O? or ?Mac? in their name. As a result, their name became Brally, Brolly, or Braly, having already anglicized Brolaigh into Braly.?\n\n?Down through the history of the Clan, the name has undergone many changes. Some of these were O?Brilagan, O?Brilaghan, O?Brelaghan, O?Brolchain, O?Brallaghan, O?Brallahan, Bradly. The name of one member of the Clan had various spellings on the same document: Brolly, Brally and Brawley. It appears that all branches of this clan stopped using the ?O? by the mid 18th century.?\n\n?The original Brolaigh, O?Brollach, Brollachan was a son of Elcan, son of Diochran, son of Flan Fionn, son of Maoltuile, son of Crunmhal, son of the High King Suibhneach Meann.?\n\n?The COAT of ARMS for the O?Bralchain was the RED HAND of ULSTER upon WHITE SHIELD.\n\nTHE MOTTO: ?MANU ET CORDE PRO PATRIA?\n\nLatin for ?HANDS AND HEART for the FATHERLAND?\n\nHappy Hunting,\n\nNancy Lewis Millsap\n\nList Mom, BRAWLEY-L\n\n/cgi-bin/pageload.cgi?brawley::ok/carter::354.html\n\nCourt Docket May 1902, Carter County, Oklahoma\n\nJune 23\n\nJ.

Does it get into the boys from Ireland, PA, VA, NC, KY, TN, IL, MO? I have heard that there was @ 6 brothers in Ireland, and that 5 came to America, Wiliam, John, James, Hugh, with Neil following later? Also heard that 3 came to America, William, John and Hugh? My Brawley family started out in Edinburg/Glasgow, Scotland, to Londonderry County, Ulster, Ireland, to PA, VA, NC, KY, TN, IL, ending up in Ripley/Shannon/Reynolds County, Missouri. I know that some ended up in TX, OK, GA, & AL. I have been researching this family for years and have a lot of info on the Brawley family, back to 1780 in NC, and have found them all to be related when you get back far enough. Also have found them with several spellings, OBrallachan, OBraly, OBrally, OBrawley, Braly, Brally, Braley, Bralley, Brawley, Brolly, Briley, and even Bradley! My problem is before and just after they got to America, trying to connect them to their fathers, because they all had the same names for 300 years! It is so hard to connect them together. I would appreciate any info you can give me about this family.

The family was connected to the O'Neill family in Ireland, possibly soldiers of the Kingdom Of O'Neill.\n\nIt is said that there was six brothers, John, James, William, Thomas, were some of the names. Four went to America, leaving two in Ireland. Supposedly they settled in Rowan County, NC and surrounding areas. I have heard that some may have settled in Pennsylvania & Virginia, but have no definate knowledge on that. I do know that they were in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennesse, Kentucky, & Illinois, before ending up in Missouri.\n\nMy husband is John Brawley, s/o Paul, s/o Thomas, s/o Joseph, s/o John & Easter (Dickey) Braley.\n\nI would love to hear from and share info with others who are researching same family.\n\nYou can contact me at jib1@\n\n???????????????\n\nIndian Territory, OK 1900 Federal Census (INDEX - File 7 of 100)\n\n/pub/usgenweb/census/ok/indian-terr/1900/cherokee/_indx-b4.txt\n\n84A 32 45 7A Brawley Evaline 46 Mississippi ed045-pg078a.txt\n\n84A 35 45 7A Brawley Harmon B. 7 Arkansas ed045-pg078a.txt\n\n84A 34 45 7A Brawley Maudee E. 11 Arkansas ed045-pg078a.txt\n\n84A 33 45 7A Brawley Minnie L. 22 Arkansas ed045-pg078a.txt\n\n84A 31 45 7A Brawley William 45 Arkansas ed045-pg078a.txt\n\n84A 31 45 7A . . 127 130 Brawley William Head W M Oct 1854 45 M 25 . .

They should show the names of their respective set of parents.\n\nOr, the 56 CD set for the 1880 census, which includes an EVERYNAME index, it means you can search for wife, children, or anyone living in the household. You could look for Emma when she would be about 5 yrs old, and living with her parents. William would be about 18, and might still be at home, but also might be out on his own at that age.\n\nSome local Family History Centers now have the CD set for the 1880 census.

North Carolina?,\n\nThe history of the Brawley name and its variations is taken from ?The\n\nBralys. A Saga of the Old South and West?, by David Braly.\n\n??The Clan of O?Brolaigh is a branch of the Ui Neill family, the origins\n\nof which are shrouded in myth and legend. For those who are interested,\n\nthe genealogy assigned to the Ui Neill by the medieval monks,\n\ngenealogists, and poets, trace the Ui Neill back to Adam and Eve. This\n\ngenealogical connection, for those who would like this detailed\n\ninformation, can be found in THE BRALYS book at some of the local\n\nlibraries. Ireland has the third oldest collection of family records in\n\nthe world, dating back to the 4th century.?\n\nDespite the strife, struggled, fighting and great loss of life in Irish\n\nhistory, The O?Braleigh Clan managed to maintain a position of honor and\n\nhold on to their lands and considerable wealth during many of those\n\nyears.\n\nDuring a civil war in the 17th century, the English took control of\n\nIreland, setting up new legal systems, confiscating land of the Irish\n\nand selling it to English businessmen. They were called Undertakers,\n\nand were expected to build and maintain castles, whereupon, Irish\n\ntenants were forbidden. Other lands were occupied by the Scots, who did\n\nallow Irish tenants. Some of the poorer lands were allowed for Irish\n\nfarmers.\n\nHowever, for some reason, this did not include the County Derry where\n\nthe O?Braleigh Clan lived. In a grant from the Earl of Tyrone, The\n\nClan O?Brally was provided a safeguard against further confiscation of\n\ntheir lands.\n\n?All Irish were forced to modernize and get away from the old, old way\n\nof life that they had followed for a thousand years. After the War the\n\nculture shift was augmented and many of the clans dropped the ?O? or\n\n?Mac? in their name. As a result, their name became Brally, Brolly, or\n\nBraly, having already anglicized Brolaigh into Braly.?\n\n?Down through the history of the Clan, the name has undergone many\n\nchanges. Some of these were O?Brilagan, O?Brilaghan, O?Brelaghan,\n\nO?Brolchain, O?Brallaghan, O?Brallahan, Bradly. The name of one member\n\nof the Clan had various spellings on the same document: Brolly, Brally\n\nand Brawley. It appears that all branches of this clan stopped using\n\nthe ?O? by the mid 18th century.?\n\n?The original Brolaigh, O?Brollach, Brollachan was a son of Elcan, son\n\nof Diochran, son of Flan Fionn, son of Maoltuile, son of Crunmhal, son\n\nof the High King Suibhneach Meann.?\n\n?The COAT of ARMS for the O?Bralchain was the RED HAND of ULSTER upon\n\nWHITE SHIELD.\n\nTHE MOTTO:\n\n?MANU ET CORDE PRO PATRIA?\n\nLatin for ?HANDS AND HEART for the FATHERLAND?\n\nHappy Hunting,\n\nNancy Lewis Millsap\n\nList Mom, BRAWLEY-L\n\nUnited States Census, 1920 for William Brawley\n\n« Back to search results\n\nImage is not available online.\n\nSearch collection\n\nAbout this collection\n\nName: William Brawley\n\nResidence: , Wichita, Texas\n\nEstimated Birth Year: 1904\n\nAge: 16\n\nBirthplace: Oklahoma\n\nRelationship to Head of Household: Son\n\nGender: Male\n\nRace: White\n\nMarital Status: Single\n\nFather's Birthplace: Arkansas\n\nMother's Birthplace: Texas\n\nFilm Number: 1821859\n\nDigital Folder Number: 4390958\n\nImage Number: 00084\n\nSheet Number: 18\n\nHousehold Gender Age\n\nParent E J Brawley F 44y\n\nGus Brawley M 18y\n\nBenjamin Brawley M 22y\n\nWilliam Brawley M 16y\n\nSam Truesdell M 34y\n\nC M Lord F 73y\n\n---------\n\nUnited States Census, 1920 for Wm J Brawley\n\n« Back to search results\n\nImage is not available online.\n\nSearch collection\n\nAbout this collection\n\nName: Wm J Brawley\n\nResidence: , Pittsburg, Oklahoma\n\nEstimated Birth Year: 1864\n\nAge: 56\n\nBirthplace: Arkansas\n\nRelationship to Head of Household:\n\nGender: Male\n\nRace: White\n\nMarital Status: Married\n\nFather's Birthplace: United States\n\nMother's Birthplace: United States\n\nFilm Number: 1821483\n\nDigital Folder Number: 4384979\n\nImage Number: 01088\n\nSheet Number: 1\n\n--------------\n\n???????????maybe related\n\n/Joseph_Brawley_records.ashx?pid=33109450\n\nJoseph Brawley\n\nName Family\n\nJoseph Brawley\n\nBirth: 1840 Reynols, Missouri, USA\n\nDeath: 1894 Reynolds, Missouri, USA\n\nFather: John Brawley\n\nMother: Easter Dickey\n\nParents\n\nJohn Brawley\n\n1790-1850\n\nEaster Dickey\n\n1797-1841\n\nSpouses & Children\n\nMary Jane Brown\n\nUnknown-Unknown\n\nLouisanna Pack\n\n1843-1882\n\nMary Ann Brawley\n\nThomas Larkin Brawley\n\nJohn Henry Brawley\n\nJoseph Marion Brawley\n\nJames Edmond Brawley\n\nElijah Dickey Brawley\n\nMary Ann Brown\n\n1864-Unknown\n\nMary Jane Convey\n\n1841-1922\n\nBrawley name meaning\n\nIrish (Derry): Anglicized form of Gaelic\n\nÓ Brólaigh\n\n‘descendant of Brolach’, a personal name possibly derived from brollach ‘breast’.\n\nMore About WILLIAM JOSEPH BRAWLEY:\n\nBurial: Milo Cemetery, Carter Co.
