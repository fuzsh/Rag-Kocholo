    "text": "The Cook is a 1918 American silent film starring Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle and Buster Keaton. The movie is a slapstick comedy and focuses on goings-on at a high-end restaurant with Arbuckle as the Cook and Keaton as the Waiter.The film is notable for a scene spoofing the 1918 Theda Bara film Salom√©, with Arbuckle dancing around with a length of sausage links and pots and pans. It also contains many of Arbuckle's favorite food gags and some well-received work by Keaton.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cook\n\n"
