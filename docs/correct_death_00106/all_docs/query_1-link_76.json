    "text": "Index\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis is a mystery story. It began on Labor Day of 1921 in room 1219 on the top floor of a San Francisco hotel. Only two people were present. One was Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle—a movie superstar. The other was actress Virginia Rappe. Afterward, Rappe suffered wrenching pains for four days and then died. More than nine decades later, the mystery remains: What happened in that room? Did Arbuckle assault Rappe or otherwise contribute to the injury that led to her death, or did he only happen to be near when her injury became evident? Was she his victim, or were they both victims of circumstance?\n\nWhen Arbuckle was arrested for the murder of Rappe, a mania raged as newspapers competed to print the most startling front page. One simply shouted (in the largest possible letters): ARBUCKLE, THE BEAST. Others predicted the previously beloved performer’s death on the gallows. He was not just tried and convicted in the press but also sentenced and punished, again and again.\n\nSo was Hollywood. Once the public’s appetite for scandal was whetted, it could not be sated. For weeks in the autumn of 1921, newspapers dredged up or concocted stories of movie industry depravity. A typical headline read, ARBUCKLE AFFAIR No SURPRISE AFTER ORGIES OF FILM COLONY. A new narrative took hold. Previously, the film colony lifestyle was presented in fan magazines and newspaper gossip columns as a carefree extended adolescence. Suddenly, this characterization had a dark counterpoint: Hollywood was filled with spoiled idlers, living beyond society’s norms, going from party to party, fueled by jazz music, alcohol, narcotics, and deviant sex. The editorialists had a field day.\n\nThe public, which had begun over the previous few years to learn about their favorite actors’ houses and families and vacations, now started to learn about their adultery and wild parties and drug use. It’s a straight line from the tabloid-style coverage of the Arbuckle case to Confidential magazine in the 1950s to today’s National Enquirer and TMZ. In the years following Arbuckle’s arrest, studio publicity machines continued to paint performers in the most favorable light. However, now that a superstar actor had appeared in story after story as a beast —the host of an orgy to which he lured starstruck young women, one of whom he raped and killed—there was no turning back; the following year, tales of a director’s mysterious murder and an actor’s doomed fight with drug addiction would fill front pages.\n\nThe relentless coverage of the Arbuckle case sparked loud condemnations of Hollywood’s allegedly decadent ways from editorialists, religious leaders, and a new and powerful voting bloc—women. That trifecta was part of the coalition that had successfully lobbied for Prohibition, and they intensified their fight against motion pictures, another intoxicant. In fact, many restated an argument they made against alcohol: movies cast those who imbibed them under a dreamlike spell that could loosen morals and foster criminality. The defenders of tradition were pitted against the purveyors of modernity. On one side, the Victorian era. On the other, the Jazz Age. It was the first great battle in a culture war that has persisted in various forms to the present day.\n\nArbuckle was a casualty of this war. On the day of the fateful party, he had seven feature films playing in theaters and two more in the can; he was the top star at the top studio. Less than a week after his arrest, his films had been pulled from every screen in America. Later, his image was effectively banned from American cinemas by Will Hays—the head of the motion picture industry’s new self-policing organization. No artist in American history has been censored more than Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle.\n\nBefore Rappe’s death, Arbuckle had been among the most beloved of all celebrities. His Fatty movie character was typically a scamp bumbling in and out of trouble, mischievous and sometimes corrupt but easy to laugh at and root for. The actor made news for charitable giving and for appearances and purchases that highlighted the wealth and leisure of the elite few in the new motion picture industry. With the passage of time and the proliferation of myths, the true story of Roscoe Arbuckle was lost. He was remembered as a killer or a victim and nothing more. To the present day, his name reappears when a celebrity is publicly entangled in a matter of sex or violence, yet invariably nothing is said about his film career other than that it was ruined. We learn nothing about his forty-six years of life other than his association with a tragic death.\n\nThe best introduction to him is via his movies, and it’s easier than ever to watch them today. Much of his finest work—silent shorts made between 1914 and 1919—can be viewed free via the Internet. Techniques feel fresh, because they were forgotten long ago. Ludicrous situations and slapstick antics build in the manner of cartoons. Arbuckle was a veteran of the vaudeville stage, and you see that medium’s aesthetic brought to cinema: deliver as much varied entertainment as possible. There are visual puns, pratfalls and chases, exaggerated violence, broad emotional eruptions, tender love scenes, risqué and macabre humor, wild stunts, subtle parodies, and camera and editing tricks. Shots of printed text, now known as intertitles, replicate spoken lines and sometimes provide a wry commentary.\n\nNot every Arbuckle movie has aged well. Comedic bits can fall flat in even his best movies. Some of the humor is shockingly adult, but most of it is childishly silly, and an adult has to accept that silliness to fully enjoy it. Unfortunately, few potential viewers ever realize what they’ve been missing. The contributions of Roscoe Arbuckle—the ingenious comedic actor and adroit filmmaker—have been virtually forgotten, as if erased by whatever occurred in that hotel room in 1921.\n\nThis book’s first mystery is just that: what did occur in room 1219? Its second mystery helps us solve its first: who was Roscoe Arbuckle, and was he capable of the crime for which he was tried three times? His career took him from Wild West vaudeville stages to some of the first motion pictures shot in Los Angeles, to the heights of young Hollywood, to the depths of his ostracism, and to a long-delayed comeback in the sound era. He worked closely with fellow legends Charlie Chaplin, Mabel Normand, Mack Sennett, and Buster Keaton. He was one of the first people to fully experience the Hollywood lifestyle, including a fleet of trophy cars, a mansion and servants, and worldwide fame—as well as frequent parties, marital separations and divorces, and drug addiction.\n\nBut Roscoe Arbuckle’s life story is not the only one to have been eclipsed by the events of Labor Day 1921. The real story of Virginia Rappe, the only other person in that hotel room, was buried so deep beneath the accumulated lies and exaggerations that it seemed it would never be found again. The prosecution and the newspaper accounts portrayed her as an innocent, while Arbuckle’s defense team questioned her character. However, it was only decades after her death that the strongest attacks on her reputation were launched. She was presented in histories as a slut if not a whore, sleeping her way through Hollywood, riddled with venereal diseases, and suffering from the lingering effects of a botched abortion. Rappe came to represent the movie industry’s underbelly and the licentious Jazz Age in the same manner Arbuckle had in 1921. However, virtually everything I first learned from books and websites about Rappe was wrong, starting with her year of birth and ending with her cause of death. Beyond the inaccurate sexual and medical histories, there was precious little written about her. That’s why it was surprising to find so much about her published during her lifetime.\n\nOvercoming an impoverished childhood, she became a celebrated model, an inventive clothing designer, and a moderately successful film actress. She was entrepreneurial, idealistic, and outspoken. Using her fame in the fashion world, she championed feminism and pacifism. She traveled to Europe and throughout America. She was frequently engaged but never married. But all of that and more was seemingly erased the moment she died—except it wasn’t. This book’s third and final mystery is: who was the real Virginia Rappe?\n\nA missing chapter remains, however, in the biographies of both Virginia Rappe and Roscoe Arbuckle. And that returns us to the first mystery. What happened in room 1219 has been obscured not just by conflicting testimony and the passage of time but also by the proliferation of myths. The most prevalent of these is that Arbuckle punctured Rappe’s bladder by raping her with a bottle. Today if a person knows only one thing about Fatty, it is probably the bottle legend. When previous histories did not merely print this fiction or some variation, they blamed the victim, highlighting lies about her to further their thesis that Arbuckle was innocent.\n\nIn this book, I revisit Labor Day 1921 and present the details we know for certain, what each side said, and, ultimately, what likely caused Virginia Rappe’s death. I avoided forming an opinion about this ultimate mystery until I had read the available testimony and reportage, consulted with experts, and thoroughly researched the lives of Arbuckle and Rappe. When I realized that pertinent information had been missed or marginalized, it became clear that fragments of the most reliable accounts fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Ultimately, a new picture took shape. The most comprehensive, objective narrative of what likely occurred on September 5, 1921, in room 1219 of the Hotel St. Francis is presented in these pages.\n\nMy aim has been to peel away the accumulated fictions and present the true story of one of the neglected giants of cinema, an unfairly pilloried woman, and the greatest of all Hollywood scandals. This is a mystery story, but it’s much more than that. It surveys the birth of the movie industry and its development from the earliest experiments to the sound revolution. It examines the practice and business of making comedy. It covers a monumental censorship debate and early battles in the culture war. It looks at how the press reported on celebrity and scandals. It is a story about fate and how two lives were decimated, only because they briefly connected.\n\n{1}\n\nLABOR DAY\n\nAs would become a lifelong habit for most of us, we longed to witness both spectacular achievement and mortifying failure. Neither of these things, we were discreetly certain, would ever come to us; we would instead be granted the frictionless lives of the meek.\n\n—THOMAS MCGUANE, ICE\n\nThe road followed, approximately, El Camino Real ( the Royal Road ), a trail blazed beside the Pacific by Spanish missionaries. It had been pounded for generations by boots, hooves, wagon wheels, and eventually automobile tires as explorers and enterprisers traveled between the preeminent West Coast metropolis of San Francisco and the lazy town of Los Angeles. California had started surfacing the future Route 101 in 1912. Nine years later, many stretches remained unpaved, and the narrow road took treacherous turns on hills—the risks to travelers compounded by the primitive machinery of the average driver’s Ford Model T.\n\nRoscoe Arbuckle did not own a Model T. His personal fleet included a silver Rolls-Royce, a Renault roadster, a Cadillac town car, a Hudson limousine, a Locomobile Sportif (priced at a then-staggering $9,500), and, everyone’s favorite, a custom-built right-hand-drive Pierce-Arrow Model 66 A-4 touring car. At a time when Ford’s ubiquitous creation sold for $370, Arbuckle’s P.A. had set him back ninety-two times as much: $34,000. Although the oft-published assertion that the car included a backseat toilet is false, it was appointed with many luxuries, including a cabinet ideal for hiding illegal liquor. Painted iridescent purple-blue with a gray cloth convertible top and creamy all-white tires tricked out with silver rims and varnished wooden spokes, the colossal and flamboyantly ostentatious Pierce-Arrow was the Batmobile of the Jazz Age, and it drew crowds wherever it went. It was famous throughout Southern California as Fatty’s car. *\n\nThis was the car Arbuckle drove on the future Route 101 from Los Angeles to San Francisco on September 3, 1921, the Saturday before Labor Day. At thirty-four, he was by most criteria the world’s number-two actor, bested by only Charlie Chaplin. Having appeared in over 150 films over the previous thirteen years and having starred in all but the first few—often with his adopted name, Fatty, in the title—he was immensely famous around the globe. As the director of at least seventy-eight films, he was celebrated for his cinematic artistry. And as the first screen actor signed to a contract worth $1 million annually ($13 million in today’s dollars), the former vaudeville vagabond was by then wealthy beyond his wildest dreams.\n\nBefore the third day of September, Arbuckle had honored that contract by starring in nine feature-length films for Paramount Pictures, all of which were produced over the previous twenty-one months. The seventh, Crazy to Marry, had only just premiered. Variety enthused:\n\nTo attempt to describe in cold, unfeeling print the story of a Fatty Arbuckle comedy is a well-nigh futile task. And if, perchance, some descriptive writing genius succeeded, he would only be spoiling a bunch of fun for those unfortunate to read it…. This is so funny that Tuesday at the Rialto the laughter was so loud as to give the impression the auditorium was being cannonaded…. Crazy to Marry will make the whole world laugh.\n\nThe man who made the whole world laugh had wrapped production on Freight Prepaid three weeks prior and was planning his next feature. Meanwhile, the fourth annual Paramount Week was beginning that Labor Day weekend. During the seven-day celebration, Paramount Pictures pulled out all stops to publicize its wares, and many more theaters than usual booked its movies exclusively. Admission was typically free. On Labor Day, the studio’s stars were to parade through Los Angeles, with the highlight being Arbuckle in his twenty-five-thousand-dollar gasoline palace (his $34,000 Pierce-Arrow). Later that same day, Arbuckle was to appear at a screening of his film Gasoline Gus at the lavish Million Dollar Theatre in downtown Los Angeles. But despite protestations from Paramount studio head Adolph Zukor, Arbuckle would make no such appearances. He wanted a vacation, and the long Labor Day weekend was the perfect opportunity for a jaunt to San Francisco.\n\nNot joining him was his wife, Minta Durfee, herself a prolific actress. Married for thirteen years, they had been separated for the past four and a half. Also not joining him was his best friend, the famous comedic actor Buster Keaton, a companion on previous trips to San Francisco. Keaton had married actress Natalie Talmadge three months before, and they were planning to sail a yacht to Catalina Island for a relaxing weekend. They invited Arbuckle.\n\nArbuckle declined. He was seeking neither communion with the ocean nor the company of newlyweds. He wanted to party, and for that San Francisco was the ideal destination. It had been the West Coast metropolis since the Gold Rush seventy-two years prior, and it had fashioned itself the Paris of the West, with world-class hotels, restaurants, and theaters. It learned early how to house, feed, and amuse not only princes but also paupers—the frontier fortune-seekers who overtook the big city on Saturdays in search of hard liquor and soft flesh.\n\nBy 1921, San Francisco’s businesses still readily accommodated society’s high and low visitors, but sentiments there had chilled toward Los Angeles since its recent population explosion; the 1920 census was the first in which the population of Los Angeles exceeded that of San Francisco (577,000 to 507,000). Northern California’s elite looked down on the rubes to their south, mostly transplants from small towns in the heartland, and they also resented the nouveau riche celebrities of the moving pictures treating their city as the Las Vegas of the day.\n\nWhen nightlife was on the agenda, Arbuckle was almost always accompanied by an entourage. He was the headliner; they were his supporting cast. He called the shots, he attracted the greatest attention, and he picked up the tabs. Keaton and other usual members of that group were not accompanying Arbuckle as he journeyed north, but he wasn’t about to go to San Francisco alone. The two men riding with him, Lowell Sherman and Fred Fishback, were not close friends of his, but they were the type who expanded his clique on late nights in Los Angeles. They knew that the best parties always seemed to follow Fatty.\n\nThe handsome Sherman, thirty-two years old, was a dramatic film actor. He played mostly dashing playboys, dastardly knaves, or a combination of the two, and he had only recently begun to distinguish himself, most prominently as a cad in Way Down East, the smash of 1920. A note in a newspaper column on that fateful Labor Day read, Lowell Sherman is the name of a gentleman who is being styled as ‘the screen’s most polished villain.’\n\nTwenty-seven-year-old Fishback was born in Bucharest, Romania. Formerly a minor film actor and then Arbuckle’s assistant director, by September 1921 he was under contract at Universal Pictures and a prolific director and writer of comedies.\n\nThe three men, each of whom was married, set out early on September 3, 1921. Filling stations, general stores, and roadside cafés were rare but welcome sights, and when the Pierce-Arrow parked it likely stirred up some commotion.\n\nThose general stores were probably selling the latest issue of the celebrity magazine Photoplay. Inside was an article attributed to Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle, salaciously entitled Love Confessions of a Fat Man, in which he stated, I am convinced that the fat man as a lover is going to be the best seller on the market for the next few years. He is coming into his kingdom at last. He may never ring as high prices or display as fancy goods as these he-vamps and cavemen and Don Juans, but as a good, reliable, all the year around line of goods, he’s going to have it on them all. Maybe the three Hollywood men laughed about the jibes at the likes of Don Juan Douglas Fairbanks and the new superstar, he-vamp Rudolph Valentino. Maybe this part struck them as ironic: Nothing is so humiliating to an efficient woman these days as an unfaithful husband. Fat men tend to be faithful. Or this: A man’s ideal is most of the things most men want to come home to—slippers, drawn curtains, a bright fire, peace, praise, comfort, and a good, hot dinner. So said the fat man, long estranged from his wife, who was journeying to party in San Francisco. The article also included a peculiar musing from Arbuckle: It is very hard to murder or be murdered by a fat man.\n\nAs the ride progressed, Arbuckle, an avid baseball fan, may have chatted about Babe Ruth, for if baseball came up, Ruth surely did. He was in the midst of the best year of his vaunted career. Alcohol may have been consumed during the lengthy trip. The basement of Arbuckle’s Los Angeles mansion was stocked with the finest liquors, and twenty bottles were along for the ride. More could be purchased in San Francisco—despite the fact that Prohibition was the law of the land.\n\nThe Eighteenth Amendment had been in effect for nearly twenty months, so buying, transporting, or selling any drink with more than a tinge of alcohol could earn you a stiff fine or six months in a brick room. But for the wealthy, like Roscoe Arbuckle and the planets that revolved around him, the main effect was to impart drinking with a sheen of outlaw glamour. There were passwords and secret knocks, private shindigs and underworld connections. Drinking was a pursuit worthy of a 350-mile excursion, and though the charms of illegal imbibing were bringing more and more women into nightclubs, such an excursion was cause to leave the wives at home. After all, there were women in San Francisco.\n\nAlong with Tijuana, where alcohol was still legal, San Francisco was a common weekend destination for Roscoe Arbuckle. He had lived there in his teenage years, employed as a singing waiter at an exclusive café. In April 1915 he directed and, with frequent comedic foil Mabel Normand, costarred in a nine-minute film, Mabel and Fatty Viewing the World’s Fair at San Francisco, Cal. It featured the rotund star clowning with San Francisco mayor (and California’s future governor) James Rolph, and it presented the Grand Dame of Union Square. Intertitle: HOTEL ST. FRANCIS, ONE OF THE LARGEST HOTELS ON THE WEST COAST. An establishing shot presented Union Square with its ninety-seven-foot-tall Dewey Monument, and then the camera panned up and rightward to take in the great height and breadth of the hotel, as wide as a city block.\n\nThe St. Francis was not merely one of but the largest hotel on the West Coast—and, with the nearby Palace Hotel, one of the two most prestigious lodging destinations west of the Mississippi River. The 450-room St. Francis was modeled after the great hotels of Europe, and after two years of construction at a cost of $2.5 million, it was an immediate sensation when it opened in 1904. Construction of a third wing began soon thereafter to meet the demand for rooms. The fire following the 1906 earthquake decimated the hotel’s interior, but the building suffered no structural damage, and the Grand Dame of Union Square reopened twenty months later. (In contrast, the older Palace Hotel had to be torn down and rebuilt.) In 1913 a fourth wing upped the room total to 629.\n\nThe St. Francis featured pneumatic tubes by which rooms could exchange messages with the front desk. Rooms also had their own telephones, a rare high-tech luxury for travelers then. Engines in the basement fed vacuum outlets in each room, replacing the hotel’s air with fresh air every eight minutes. The hotel had its own orchestra, which played on the mezzanine; its own school for young guests; its own Turkish baths with heated saltwater pumped in from the bay. Its most distinctive feature was the ten-foot-tall Magneta grandfather clock from Vienna, which controlled all other clocks in the hotel. When the St. Francis became the place in San Francisco to be seen, the clock’s location in the resplendent rococo lobby was a popular meeting place, celebrated in lore.\n\nThe Hotel St. Francis was also the place to eat. From 1904 to 1926, Victor Hirtzler was the head chef.* His menu was noted for its encyclopedic variety: traditional French dishes, American favorites, and local foods like bay oysters, artichokes, and avocados. Breakfast options included 203 egg dishes, among them eggs Moscow (poached eggs stuffed with caviar). By publishing cookbooks, naming dishes like celery Victor after himself, and scoring publicity for greeting celebrity guests, Hirtzler became the most famous chef in America during his twenty-two years at the St. Francis. He was the Wolfgang Puck of the Progressive Era.\n\nAs the St. Francis was celebrated for its grandeur, unique luxuries, and cuisine, it attracted the rich, famous, and powerful. The list of those who stayed there before September 1921 includes Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, William Taft, and Woodrow Wilson and such Hollywood celebrities as Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, John Barrymore (who tumbled out of a bed during the 1906 earthquake), and Cecil B. DeMille. The hotel’s brochure in the early 1920s listed three famous guests, likely chosen to represent the variety of mega-celebrities who slept and ate there: World War I commander General John Pershing; Billy Sunday, the most celebrated evangelical preacher of the era; and Roscoe Arbuckle.\n\nIn the late afternoon of Saturday, September 3, Arbuckle’s gasoline palace pulled up beside the four granite pillars that marked the entryway to the Hotel St. Francis. Arbuckle’s live-in secretary had reserved three adjoining rooms in the south wing of the hotel’s uppermost floor, its twelfth:\n\n1219, a rectangular room with one window facing south, a bathroom, and a closet\n\n1220, a larger, squarish room with one window facing south and one facing east (toward Union Square and, a mile away, the bay), and a fireplace but no bathroom or closet\n\n1221, another rectangular room, with two windows facing east and one facing north (toward the center wing), and a bathroom but no closet\n\nEach room had a door connecting it to the hallway, and doors connected 1219 to 1220 and 1220 to 1221. Room 1220 was typically used as a second bedroom for either 1219 or 1221, thus the absence of a bathroom, but on this weekend it also lacked a bed. Instead, a single bed for Fishback was added to 1219, while Arbuckle slept in the room’s double bed. Sherman slept in a double bed in 1221. Room 1220 was their lounge, with furnishings including a couch and a love seat.\n\nThat Saturday evening, a deliveryman carried four bottles of gin and Scotch from nearby Gobey’s Grill into the St. Francis and up to the three rooms on the southeast corner of the top floor. If the hotel staff noticed, nothing was said, for alcohol was a common commodity there. One unpublicized feature of the hotel was a fully stocked speakeasy in the basement.\n\nOn Sunday, after an afternoon of sightseeing in Arbuckle’s Pierce-Arrow and visiting with Bay Area friends, Arbuckle and his two movie industry companions dined and danced at the Tait-Zinkand Cafe, located just one block from their hotel. Along with the restaurant in the Hotel St. Francis, Tait’s was one of the two most prestigious dining destinations in the city. The café also had a cabaret show, and alcohol was served to discreet customers. The three patrons from Los Angeles stayed late.\n\nLowell Sherman invited one of Tait’s chorus girls, Alice Blake,* to come to the top floor of the St. Francis for drinks the next day. Twenty-six-year-old Blake was the daughter of a prominent Oakland flour-mill magnate. At age seventeen in 1912, she made the news for her elopement and, at her father’s behest, the marriage’s prompt annulment. She had high aspirations for a dancing and acting career and, in accepting Sherman’s invitation, probably envisioned the hotel social affair as a Hollywood networking opportunity. She had a dancing rehearsal the next afternoon but agreed to stop by the hotel suite beforehand.\n\nThat same Sunday evening, three other visitors from Los Angeles checked in to the nearby Palace Hotel: small-time film publicist Alfred Semnacher, his friend Maude Delmont, and film actress Virginia Rappe. The German-born Semnacher was forty-three years old and had been estranged from his wife for nearly a year; he had filed for divorce because of her undue attentions to another man, and the hearing was scheduled for a Los Angeles courtroom on September 15. Semnacher had known Delmont for years and ran into her a few days earlier leaving the Pig’n Whistle restaurant in Hollywood. She was either thirty-eight or thirty-nine. She admired his car, and he suggested a trip. Semnacher also invited his friend Rappe to ride along and stay a week in San Francisco. Rappe, who turned thirty that summer, had been spending too much time alone. A vacation in her former home of San Francisco sounded invigorating. Maybe she could catch up with old friends; maybe she could foster new friendships. Semnacher introduced her and Delmont just before the trio headed north.\n\nAlso staying at the Palace Hotel was Ira Fortlouis—an unlikely catalyst for Hollywood’s greatest scandal. He was a thirty-four-year-old salesman from the Northwest. He formerly sold hardware and sewing machines but was now focused on women’s clothing. And he knew Fred Fishback.\n\nOn Monday morning, Labor Day, Fortlouis was just about to leave the Palace for an 11 AM meeting with Fishback when he saw Semnacher, Delmont, and Rappe in the lobby. Forever on the lookout for women to model the gowns he sold, he asked a bellboy about the dark-haired and stylish beauty in the striking green outfit and was told she was Virginia Rappe, the movie actress.\n\nAt the Hotel St. Francis, Fred Fishback invited Fortlouis into the twelfth-floor suite. Fishback was fully dressed, but Sherman and Arbuckle were still in pajamas and robes. The four men chatted, and Fortlouis asked if they knew an actress he had just seen in the Palace lobby: Virginia Rappe. All did, having encountered her on a studio set or at a Hollywood party. Fishback phoned the Palace and had an attendant hand Rappe a note, inviting her over to 1220. Rappe told Semnacher and Delmont, I’ll go up there, and if the party is a bloomer I’ll be back in twenty minutes.\n\nAround noon, Rappe entered the suite. A former model and fashion designer, she wore the same self-made clothes she had at the Palace: a jade skirt and jade sleeveless blouse over a white silk shirt adorned with a string of ivory beads. Her hair was up and under a white Panama hat trimmed with a thin ribbon of jade.\n\nTwenty minutes later, Rappe spoke to Delmont by telephone. It wasn’t yet much of a party, but there was plenty of alcohol. At her invitation, Delmont came up. Shortly thereafter, another guest arrived: Alice Blake, the chorus girl Lowell Sherman had invited the night before. Blake was followed twenty minutes later by her friend Zey Prevost, also a chorus girl, a brunette in her midtwenties, and an aspiring actress.* Unlike Blake, however, Prevost came from modest means; she was a child of Portugese immigrants. At the time of the 1920 census, she lived in a hotel and worked in a cafeteria pantry.\n\nLet’s have some music, a piano or something, Rappe suggested.\n\nWho can play a piano? Arbuckle asked.\n\nNo one. And so Arbuckle ordered a Victrola, which the hotel staff delivered with some 78 RPM records. From the phonograph’s brass horn wailed the tinny clamor of popular songs like St. Louis Blues by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, Paul Whiteman and His Orchestra’s Everybody Step, and Ain’t We Got Fun? as sung by Van and Schenck. This last song, released in April, was quickly becoming the devil-may-care anthem of the Jazz Age. Times are bad and getting badder, still we have fun. They drank. They danced.\n\nAround 1:30 PM, Fishback left. He took Arbuckle’s Pierce-Arrow to a nearby beach to observe seals he was considering shooting for an upcoming movie. There were then four women and three men in 1220. Arbuckle asked Sherman to tell one of those men, Fishback’s acquaintance Ira Fortlouis, to leave. The traveling salesman had overstayed his welcome. He departed.\n\nShortly after Fishback took the car, a friend of Arbuckle’s named Mae Taube arrived at the party. Taube was the wife of a cattle buyer and the daughter-in-law of popular evangelist Billy Sunday, who was a vocal proponent of Prohibition. The day before, Taube had stopped by the suite and Arbuckle had invited her to take a ride in his Pierce-Arrow that Labor Day. Arbuckle later described her as peeved to find a party in full swing.\n\nWho are all these people? she asked.\n\nSearch me. I don’t know them, Arbuckle replied.\n\nBut he did introduce Taube to Rappe. Not wanting to join the drinking, Taube agreed to return later for the promised ride. Meanwhile, Al Semnacher appeared with the intention of picking up Rappe and Delmont, but both women were having too much fun to leave; Rappe was drinking orange blossoms (Arbuckle’s favorite cocktail), and Delmont was wearing a pair of Sherman’s pajamas and downing a great many double scotches. Instead, Semnacher drove Alice Blake the one block to her dance rehearsal at Tait’s. Upon discovering the rehearsal was canceled, Blake returned to the party a short time afterward.\n\nBlake’s need to attend a rehearsal was probably the initial reason for the Labor Day gathering’s early launch, and the gathering was likely intended as a pre-party get-together. Arbuckle had planned to spend the early afternoon taking Mae Taube for a ride, and most invited guests were scheduled to arrive at the suite later in the day. But as the afternoon wore on and the drinking continued, the prelude became the main event. Present then were Arbuckle, his suitemate Lowell Sherman, chorus girls Alice Blake and Zey Prevost, and Virginia Rappe and her traveling companion Maude Delmont. Ice, orange juice, and food were brought in. The deliveryman from Gobey’s Grill returned to drop off twelve additional bottles of booze—most from Canada, some moonshine.\n\nArbuckle remained clothed in pajamas and a plush purple bathrobe. His attire would later be used to paint him as sort of a Jazz Age Hugh Hefner, a circumventor of society’s norms. Perhaps the pajamas did signify that he hoped to be out of them and into bed with one of the women. With Delmont putting on a pair of Sherman’s pajamas, supposedly because she was hot, and Sherman presumably still in pajamas himself, it had become a sort of pajama party. Still, Arbuckle wore a thick brocade robe over silk sleepware: a long-sleeve shirt and long pants. The robe reached his ankles. It would have revealed no more flesh than a suit and tie.\n\nIn one-on-one conversations, Arbuckle was prone to shyness, but he came alive when performing before a group—whether in a vaudeville theater, on a movie set, or at a party. He knew how to command an audience, regaling all with humorous showbiz tales, clowning about with a drink in one hand and cigarette in the other, and fox-trotting to jazz records on the Victrola. Roscoe liked nothing better than playing host to all comers, Buster Keaton recalled.\n\nArbuckle jokingly announced he would leap out of one of 1220’s two windows if anyone there would join him. If I would jump out of the twelfth-story window, they would talk about me today, and tomorrow they would go to see the ball game. So what is in life after all?\n\nAin’t we got fun?\n\nAt some point, Arbuckle and Rappe sat together on a sofa. They likely talked about the movie industry. His acting career was now soaring, while after some initial promise, hers was sputtering. They had moved in the same Hollywood circles. They knew some of the same people—especially movie director Henry Lehrman. He had been Rappe’s boyfriend for two and a half years. The relationship had halted with an argument that spring, but emotions were still simmering. Early in his film career, Arbuckle had been directed by Lehrman many times. Rappe may have thought getting to know Arbuckle better could boost her career, as had her relationship with Lehrman. Movie industry success was often launched via personal connections.\n\nThey may have spoken about San Francisco. They had both lived there previously, though not at the same time. Both had attended the World’s Fair. And Rappe, like Arbuckle, had likely been to Tait’s and other local nightlife destinations. They may have spoken about Los Angeles. They had likely danced in the same Southern California nightclubs and previously attended the same parties.\n\nThey had other things in common. Both had traveled to some of the same cities and made ocean journeys to Europe. They had both lived in New York City. They had lost their mothers at nearly the same age: she at eleven, he at twelve. She never knew her father; his had been absent for most of his childhood and was now deceased. And they had each launched public careers in their youth: she was a model, he a stage actor and then a singer.\n\nAs the music played and they sat together in room 1220, drinking, they probably flirted. He likely prefixed some of his sentences with Gee —his favorite expression, and one that made him seem endearingly childish, like his film characters. But he may also have made risqué jokes and quips, as he sometimes did, and this too was reminiscent of his usual movie role—for on-screen the childlike Fatty had adult preoccupations.\n\nThen or some time after then, Rappe tried to enter the bathroom in room 1221. The door was locked. She heard Maude Delmont inside and asked if she could enter. The answer was no. Sherman was in the bathroom with Delmont. Rappe walked back through 1220, where Arbuckle, Blake, and Prevost were situated, and entered room 1219 to use its bathroom.\n\nShortly thereafter, just before 3 PM, when Mae Taube was due to return, Roscoe Arbuckle entered 1219, the bedroom he shared with Fred Fishback. When he closed the door leading to 1220, the music faded. He locked the door.\n\n* From 1910 to 1918, approximately 1,250 Pierce-Arrow Model 66s were produced. Fourteen are known to survive today. One is Arbuckle’s, which was fully restored in recent years.\n\n* The French-born Hirtzler had been the personal chef to Nicholas II, emperor of Russia, and Carlos I, king of Portugal, and oversaw the legendary kitchens of Sherry’s and the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City before those of the St. Francis.\n\n* Actual name: Alice Westphal. She likely went by Blake to disguise her café career.\n\n* Actual name: Sadie Reiss. She chose the exotic Zey Prevost to bestow upon herself some Hollywood-style glamour.\n\n{2}\n\nJOURNEYS: 1887-1908\n\nThe cinema is little more than a fad…. What audiences really want to see is flesh and blood on the stage.\n\n—CHARLIE CHAPLIN, JANUARY 1914\n\nFittingly, the account of his birth, too, contains a dubious legend, one long accepted as fact. Roscoe Arbuckle purportedly weighed sixteen pounds at delivery. His alleged heft, more than twice that of the average newborn, is likely a story spawned later to support his larger-than-life persona. Arbuckle’s supposedly prodigious entrance into this world is sometimes presented as if it nearly killed his mother and left her in frail health until it did indeed eventually finish her—twelve years later! Legends breed legends.\n\nThis much is true: Roscoe Conkling* Arbuckle was born March 24, 1887, in a farmhouse near Smith Centre, Kansas, to parents William and Mary, both of whom were likely thirty-eight. He was the youngest of five children; a sixth child died at birth. His oldest sister Lola Belle (seventeen at his birth) married and moved out when Roscoe was an infant. His other siblings were Nora (sixteen); Arthur (eleven), who was already helping his father in the fields; and William Harrison (eight), known as Harry.\n\nBoth William and Mary had grown up in farming families in rural Indiana before marrying in 1867. They and their first four children left the Hoosier State in 1880. Like over a half-million other pioneers before them, they were searching for opportunities in the wide spaces of the West. The Arbuckles staked out a farming homestead just outside the recently formed township of Smith Centre in north-central Kansas, fifteen miles from the Nebraska border. Smith Centre fulfilled the needs of a county measuring nine hundred square miles that had exploded from sixty-six people in 1870 to nearly fourteen thousand ten years later. The town in 1883 had nineteen stores and three hotels.* Nearly every building was new. Nearly everyone had only just arrived.\n\nLife proved harsh on the Great Plains. Farmers there cultivated wheat at a time when plows and reapers were pulled by horses and much work was done by hand. Children old enough to swing a sickle or tie a bushel were put to work from sunup to sundown. Because lumber was scarce, families huddled in earthen huts, always at the mercy of the elements. The Arbuckle home was later described as a sod house of the most primitive kind. Though in later life he would romanticize his Kansas birthplace, Roscoe Arbuckle resided there for only his first year and a half and thus remembered only the tales of his family. And there was little to romanticize; his father was frequently drunk and abusive. In the autumn of 1888, the family sold their farm and farming equipment and headed west again.\n\nAfter traveling more than eleven hundred miles by horse-drawn wagon, the Arbuckles arrived in Santa Ana, California, thirty miles southeast of Los Angeles. Incorporated in 1887 during a California real estate boom, Santa Ana became the county seat of Orange County around the time the Arbuckles settled there in 1889. Its population had blossomed to nearly four thousand and businesses were thriving because the town was a key stop on the new Santa Fe Railroad Surf Line connecting Los Angeles to San Diego. Tracks for horse-drawn streetcars bifurcated the dirt streets. Buildings as tall as four stories with ornate frontispieces seemed to sprout overnight from the dust, monuments to optimism. The Arbuckles bought a double house. They crowded into the front half of the bottom floor and rented out the remainder of that floor and all of the second to boarders.\n\nAlmost as quickly as they had settled, William Arbuckle wandered again, heading to Northern California in search of more lucrative business opportunities. Later, Arthur and Harry went to work for him. It is unknown what emotional effect the departure of her husband had on Mary, a devout Baptist, but Roscoe later said he never felt loved as a child. Financially, William’s absence surely had an impact on the son he left behind: the youngest Arbuckle entered the workforce at age five, running errands for storekeepers. Schoolmates would remember him wheeling around a little red wagon, delivering to families the clothes washed by his mother.\n\nHe spent much time alone. His father remained out of the picture for most of his childhood. Like his brothers, his sister Nora left home in the early years after the family moved to Santa Ana. And his oldest sister, Lola, died as a young adult. He was, in essence, the only child of a single mother. Much of the time that other children used for building friendships with peers, the youngest Arbuckle spent performing errands for his mother or employed by shopkeepers.\n\nStill, others would recall him gathering with friends to play marbles in a dirt street. In a photo of him at age eight, he looks much as he would as an adult. His head is nearly round, cheeks plump, chestnut hair parted from the left. Teasing children bestowed on him the dreaded title of overweight kids everywhere: Fatty. He hated it. The verbal torment he endured for his weight caused him to withdraw further.\n\nSanta Ana had one schoolhouse, which Roscoe Arbuckle seldom attended after the second grade. Instead, he sneaked into vaudeville theaters, watching the practiced precision, smelling the greasepaint, hearing the applause, and fantasizing that he too could revel in such adoration, that he too could escape into a make-believe world of costumes and songs, backdrops and pratfalls. Adults looked down on vagabond actors performing in a train stop like Santa Ana, but the idea of playing for pay had great cachet to a lonely and curious child."
