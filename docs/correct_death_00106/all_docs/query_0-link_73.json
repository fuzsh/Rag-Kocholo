Rhodes. He witnessed, as a guard, the execution of the unfortunate Major Andre(*John Andre, Andre was hanged as a spy at noon on October 2, 1778); fought in the battle of Cowpens, and saw the surrender of Cornwallis; was at the siege of Yorktown. Removed, after the war to North Carolina; and from there went to Gallatin, Kentucky; He was born in Virginia; died in Vernon, Ind.\n\nJohn André (1750-1780)\n\nJohn André was the aide de camp of Sir Henry Clinton, the British commander-in-chief.\n\nAndré purchased a commission as second lieutenant in the Royal Welsh Fusiliers in 1771. In 1774 he joined a regiment in Quebec, where he pursued his first love of poetry and painting. In September and October 1775, American troops laid siege to his fort at St. Johns. He was captured, brought back to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and treated roughly. His days as a prisoner turned him against the American rebels. The Americans finally exchanged him in 1776, and he met up with British troops in New York City. Sir William Howe was especially interested in the information André had learned behind the American lines. André then purchased a position as captain and become General Charles Grey's aide. He became known for behaving ruthlessly and aggressively on the battlefield. In 1778 André joined the staff of Henry Clinton, General Howe's replacement. Clinton made him head of intelligence in April 1779. André successfully kept track of intelligence from American disserters and British prisoners who had escaped or were exchanged. André's most famous success was the treachery of Benedict Arnold. As a result, Clinton promoted André rapidly, from deputy to adjutant general in October 1779. Yet Benedict Arnold was also André's downfall. Three American militiamen captured André, who was dressed in civilian clothes with a treasonous letter from Clinton to Arnold in his shoe. André was tried with a court martial. Found guilty, he begged George Washington to shoot him as a gentlemen instead of hanging him as a spy. Nevertheless, he was hanged as a spy in Tappan, New York on October 2, 1780.\n\nAbstract of Graves of Revolutionary Patriots\n\nName Location Reference\n\nNEW, Jethro Vernon IN 56 Abstract of Graves of Revolutionary Patriots, Vol.3, Serial: 11999; Volume: 8\n\nJethro New, a soldier in the Revolutionary War, is buried in Jennings County.

Surveys, land claims - all were confusing. Settlers would accidentally settle on someone else's claim, or build a cabin on land set\n\naside for the Virginia soldiers. Property lines were poorly marked and likely, changed by an eager settler who wanted a piece of land that had already been claimed. Deeds were sometimes lost, mixed up in the recorder's office or never filed at all. The result was many bitter land squabbles, law suits and frustration.\n\nTo the surveyor, Kentucky presented an awesome and fearful task. Due to the physical layout of the land, they weren't facing thousands of acres of flatland ... Kentucky was an area of dense undergrowth, hills, creeks and Native Americans who didn't take too kindly to the white man's encroachment of their hunting grounds. Many wanna-be surveyors just couldn't understand the use of the instruments needed nor have a knowledge of plane geometry. Kentucky established in 1779-80 a land court to handle the conflicting claims and erroneous surveys, but it didn't provide any training for surveyors. Thus, the Virginia survey laws were used in Kentucky until 1794 - two years after statehood. Kentucky after 1792 was more concerned about establishing the true boundaries of the state than worrying about boundaries between settlers. I have written before in a previous tip about the problems and fights over the state boundaries. It is noted in the Kentucky Encyclopedia that \"As late as 1990, boundaries were labeled \"indefinite\" on the topographical maps of the U.S. Geological Society.\" (page 862).\n\nDepending on the education of the surveyor, some surveys are beautifully done, accurate and easy to locate. Others are a nightmare. Some were so vague that for many years the land owners were not certain if they were clearing timberland on their land or their neighbors! Since many of the surveyors had to use trees marked with a slash as a property line, if he called a yellow poplar a white poplar or an oak a maple .... you can see what problem this might cause!\n\nSurveyors used as one of their instruments a \"Jacob's Staff\". This had been used as far back as George Washington and was the main surveying instrument. It was a one-legged staff on which was mounted an open-face brass compass. It could be tilted in order to balance the directional needle. They sighted through twin forks centered by hair-thin wires. It was light-weight, easily set up and taken down and was carried by the assistant surveyor. Distance measurements were taken in terms of \"poles\" A pole =\n\nsixteen and ½ feet long. Looped-wire chains were made up of sixteen inch segments; and the full chain was four poles in length. So, the surveyor had to hire chain carriers who couldn't be a 98 pound weakling! If you will use your imagination, you can easily see the problems with using these chains.\n\n(1) with the terrain in which they were working, the chain carriers couldn't just lay the chain out straight on the ground many times. They were going around trees, over brush, up and down hills. (2) the chain was dragged (snagging often I would assume!), and the wear and tear on the chain caused the \"joints\" or links to wear out and be inaccurate.\n\nAnother dirty little secret of many of the surveyors in eastern Kentucky was their lack of even trying. Land was so cheap there that they didn't feel it was worth their time to spend much effort on surveying accurately. One surveyor, doing a conscientious job could not survey 500 acres in one day. Yet many of the surveyors did and just added the words which we've all seen so many times: \"500 acres more or less\". This was a legal protection for them but some surveyors really took advantage of the term!\n\nToday's surveyor is a far cry from the old timers. Modern tools, knowledge of the higher math, satellites ... although still a strenuous job, is a far cry from what these old-time surveyors lived through. But I wonder how many present-day surveyors would like to go back in time for a day or so and walk along side the surveying party?\n\nPicture for just a moment what it would have been like. The surveyor might have been a big man, attired more like an Indian than a white man. Long heavy britches to protect his legs against the undergrowth. Stout shoes (although some men wore Indian moccasins) to guarantee, hopefully, a steady step. A bag around his neck and shoulders containing his survey books. By his side trod the deputy or assistant surveyor. He might have been a younger man who was in training to become a surveyor himself. Eager, of quick step to keep up with the surveyor, carrying the priceless and scarce surveying tools carefully as they waded creeks, climbed knobs, thrashed through the underbrush. Axes were carried to make the slash marks in the trees or cut back brush so they could find their way. Food was a necessity as they might spend many days in the woods, or they might have relied on their hunting skills. Behind them were the chain carriers. These two men were normally neighbors or friends of the man having the survey done; they wanted to be sure the surveyor didn't stray into their land. Or, if there were no neighbors yet, men who had been hired by the surveyor to drag those painfully heavy chains.\n\nThey might have plodded silently for miles, stopping only to catch their breath, check the compass or have some vittles. They heard nothing but the call of the birds, the howls of the wild animals, the gentle splashing of the creek ahead. Indians they never heard; they were the masters of silent movement. Ever alert as they walked or rested they sought a glimpse of the enemy. The gear grew heavier every step until they reached what the surveyor had been guaranteed was the beginning of the landowner's property. The settler likely met them there and showed the proof that he had been granted 400 acres of 2nd class land here. How would you have determined where to start? How much is 400 acres when you're staring across virgin timberland? Marking that first tree or piling stones up to make a marker,\n\nthe men worked through the day. Trees were climbed to get a better view of what lie ahead. Mosquitoes stung. Flies darted around the sweating faces of the men. Rocks, hidden in the underbrush, tripped up the deputy surveyor causing him to sprawl across the rocky ground and blood spurted from his face. His face turned red in shame lest the surveyor felt him not adequate to the task. Indians popping out from behind a tree with tomahawks possibly drawn causing the party to retreat. Rest at night by a campfire with one eye open for danger. But the beauty of what they had seen that day could not be explained on the surveyor's page. Grasses so tall that it came up to the belly of their horses. Streams so pure that they gulped from its crystal goodness. Birds of every variety flying overhead with their encouraging song. Animals standing back from fear of the human form. Trees reaching to the heavens it seemed. They were where no man had gone before. This was, in the early days, their final frontier.\n\nMore About JETHRO NEW:\n\nBurial: Hebron Cemetery, Monroe Township, Jefferson Co.

England encouraged the colonists, which she considered \"hers\" to produce at home. Laws were passed discouraging colonial production that would compete with their home ... England. And, for a time, the colonists obeyed. Mercantilism was briefly \"a nation is more important than its parts\". Make what you can at home, sell abroad but don't buy abroad, stash the money away. Some of this was seen in the fact that most of the English timberland was used up so it was America's responsibility to supply them with timber. English ironworkers needed pig iron from the colonies but didn't want the colonists to make or sell pots, pans, etc and have the money for themselves. Colonists were forced to import only from England and had to pay cash for everything they bought. Americans soon grew tired of this and found ways around the law, some illegal. It has been noted that somehow, tobacco grown in the south showed up in Holland. They bartered with France for cotton, silk, brandy and cheese. Rum produced in Rhode Island showed up in the ports of Africa and bartered for molasses to make more rum.\n\nThe immigrants from England in this early time fell into several categories:\n\nSpecialists were trained craftsmen and they were few in number. James Reed in Jamestown was a blacksmith; John Allen was a cooper who came on the Mayflower. As more boats arrived on America's shores, more craftsmen arrived. Weavers settled in the Boston area. . The specialists were often\n\nwandering men and women. Starting in a small village, they were prone to move to the larger cities to open their own stores. The best specialists and craftsmen settled originally in the trade centers of the time - Boston, Newport, New York and Philadelphia with some heading off to Annapolis, Williamsburg and Charleston SC. The crafts grew until there were many specialists gracing the new world - furriers, weavers, brick and tile-makers, leatherworkers, feltmakers and many types of metal workers. Those moving to the cities normally had their shop on the first floor and either lived upstairs or rented out the upstairs.\n\nCraftsmen learned that, although not as important in America, they had to adhere to certain status rules to profit in their field. The ways for improving your social status included:\n\n- Going to the correct church\n\n- Marrying the proper girl\n\n- Being seen with the right people\n\nVarious levels of social status developed. \"Substantial artisans\" were considered to be the middle class. These were the workers whose work used more hand and body than brain and the term merchanick came into use. Semi-skilled laborers such as sawyers were termed \"inferior mechanicks.\"\n\nVoting privileges in the colonies was limited to those who owned 50 or more acres of land or had 50 pounds worth of personal property.\n\nThe Apprentice System was well known from early colony times, as it had existed in England before. It had begun there because of a labor surplus. The \"master\" could demand that a boy serve as an apprentice for seven years. He was allowed to enforce rigid discipline, demand menial chores\n\nfrom the boy and charge the parents of the apprentice for teaching him the trade. This became known as \"binding out\" the child. As you have noted, this was carried on into Kentucky also, apprenticeships were a common thing. In Kentucky, a child was bound out until he or she reached the age of 18, the \"master\" was to provide the child with room and board, and at the end of the apprenticeship provide a new suit of clothes, a horse and saddle or a bed. This system was abused often. Back in England however, the\n\nrequirements were a lot sterner. Some children were bound out by the offer of their parents so the child could learn a trade. Some were bound because they were orphaned or illegitimate, it saved the town money so they wouldn't have to provide for the town's poor. Many of these provisions\n\ncontinued in Kentucky. In early colonial days most boys were bound out for seven years with four to five years the norm. Many were very unhappy with this arrangement as the master was not a kind person and had a lot of free labor, and they ran away from the master such as Ben Franklin did. It was not unusual to see ads placed by masters offering a reward for a run-away apprentice.\n\nAt the end of the apprenticeship, for those who survived due to hard labor or a kind master, they became a journeyman. Sometimes the master allowed the children to attend a school of some sort to learn to read, write and cipher. This tradition also continued into Kentucky times. Some boys did learn wonderful trades, many more became angry and lazy adults.\n\nThe Journeyman. The first requirement of a journey man was to submit his \"master piece\" to prove his skills. He had worked for years beside his master learning the trade and it was now time for him to prove himself on his own. The work was hard and the hours long but the now young man was on his own without the shadow of the master over his shoulder. He took great pride in his work. Payment was normally very good and if hired for a particular project, he was also given room and board, thus he could save his money for his future. By 1760, a normal journeyman's wages were about 15 shillings a week plus board and keep. The journeyman many times needed workers to assist him in his craft and hired other men and slaves. In the Virginia area, a plantation owner might have in his employ skilled\n\nbrickmakers carpenters, blacksmiths, coopers. Some slaves were apprenticed in weaving, tailors, house joiners and cabinetmakers - but of course, at a much lower wage.\n\nThe Masters. They had the hardest jobs in many respects. He was constantly in competition with others of the same craft, never had enough qualified men working for him (craftsmen were known to steal from each others the most qualified men). He had to keep \"peace in the family\", be that black or white, his people had to show up for church, and they shouldn't get into trouble. He was always haggling over the raw products of his trade, trying to get the best price. His wife was busy running a large household. Many times however, if the master died, the wife was smart enough to take up the same business and set up little shops of their own.\n\nMany masters had to have a side-line business to keep them going when the times were tough. Cabinetmakers made caskets and often conducted the entire funeral. Bookbinders also sold books. Clothing makers sold needles, thread and materials. But still, many masters died penniless. Credit then, like now, was the \"rage\" and the account books were filled with so many debts that many never collected what was due them. Many of the creditors did attempt to pay in farm products.\n\nIn the early days of Kentucky - and not that far back in time - if you have the privilege of seeing an old account or ledger book, you will see that everything was charged with the hope that someone in the household would pay the debt. When an individual died, these account books were gone through and a list of the debits and credits lists during the evaluation of the estate. Those who owed were supposed to come forward and settle their debts in order that the debts of the master could be paid before disbursements would be made to the legatees. Sometimes things never change!\n\n(c) Copyright 3 June 2004, Sandra K. Gorin\n\nMore About JAMES BERT NEW:\n\nBurial: Maplewood Cemetery, Mayfield, Graves Co.

Marshall was known as generally quarrelsome and was\n\nregarded as a dangerous man in the community. On Nov. 27, 1863, Marshall\n\nkilled a man named David Moses Baker. Philip's son, William Smith Jackson,\n\nthen 29 years old and serving as the local marshall, arrested his uncle for\n\nthe murder. Marshall was tried in May, 1864 and sentenced to hang July 9. This\n\nsentence was commuted to life imprisonment and after some time was pardon-\n\ned to join the Army. While in prison Marshall advised another \"not to take anything off that Smith Jackson nor David Baker\" (presumably a relative of Moses Baker, for whose murder he was imprisoned).\n\nNote: In 1867 Marshall returned to Washington Co., made threats and was\n\nkilled by Smith Jackson.\n\nInformation by:\n\nIRENE N HAMILTON\n\n427 MARTIN APT 33\n\nCHANDLER TX 75758\n\nMore About PHILLIP JACKSON:\n\nBurial: Pillman's Cemetery, Pulaski Co.

D., and Margaret Thompson, his wife.\n\nGranddaughter of William Harrod and Elizabeth New, his wife.\n\nGr-granddaughter of Jethro New and Sarah Bowman, his wife.\n\nJethro New (1760-1836) enlisted, 1778, in Captain Rhodes' company; was in the battle of Cowpens and siege of Yorktown. He witnessed the execution of André. He was born in Virginia; died in Vernon, Ind.\n\nAlso No. 56239.\n\nSources for this information are \"The Magna Carter Lineage and Family Record of Sanford Hickman Harrod\"\n\nby Margaret Harrod Daniels, which despite the problems mentioned earlier accurately and rather completely traced these families down to her present time, but screwed-up some of the ancestors. As Sanford is not descended from Anna Dubois he also does not have Magna Carter lineage from the Barons of Runnymeade as stated in the paper. Other sources are Helynn Carrier's manuscript, Sanford's county history biography, Susan Atkins' and Bernice Swainson's published materials. Atkins accepted and pushed that James who married Elizabeth Stewart was the son of Thomas brother of James of Harrodsburg and not of Samuel who married Jemima Sherewood as stated by James' son Samuel Harrod in the \"Chronlogical Account\" which was ignored by Atkins, called a forgery by William Anthony (and who better to recognize forgeries than the man whose forgeries and mistaken identities still confuse people and keep them from accepting the facts to this day?), and accepted by Swainson and Carrier. Swainson realized that James son of Thomas and James son of Samuel were not the same man. But I have proven that theory by re-iterating Swainson's theory and the evidence--public records now available to anyone on-line, and took Atkin's argument and proved Swainson's theory correct by methods not used by Swainson or Atkins --though Atkins gave me the idea--census records alone can prove this argument, but the fact James son of Thomas was born ca. 1785 and living in Wilson co.,TN, at the time of the trial of Harrod Heirs vs. Harrod Heirs and was alive and married after 1822 all prove the men are different. James of Scott County was living in Scott County,IN,in 1817 when the trial started, was married and had had all his children by then and was born 14 Apr 1744 and died in 1822.\n\nFor further information on this topic go to Christine Smith's Harrod Webpage to the \"Burning Questions\" page where my letter explaining all this is.\n\nS. H. HARROD was born in Scott County, Ind., August 20, 1827, son of William and Elizabeth (New) Harrod, the former a native of Kentucky, and his wife of North Carolina. They were early settlers of Scott County, Ind., where they lived until their deaths, he dying at the age of fifty-five, and his wife at the age of eighty-nine. The Doctor's early life was passed on his father's farm. He attended the State University, and then engaged in school-teaching, and studied medicine at odd times. His first preceptor was Dr. B. F. Russell, of Paris, Ind. He also studied with his brother, Dr. J. R. Harrod, of Scott County, Ind. In the session of 1849-50 he attended the Ohio Medical College at Cincinnati. He then began the practice of medicine at Little Rock, Washington County. where he practiced for about four years. In 1856 he came to Canton and bought property, with a view to permanent location. In the same year he returned to the Ohio Medical College at Cincinnati. from which he graduated in the spring of 1857. He then established himself in practice at Canton, where he has since pursued his medical profession with great success. He is a member of the State and Washington County Medical Societies and the Christian Church. October 22, 1854, he married Margaret R. Thompson, a native of Washington County, and a daughter of Levi J. and Patsey (Arbuckle) Thompson. There were seven children by this marriage, four of whom are living: Flora N., Lincoln S., Itasca L. and Warder. The Doctor has paid much attention to the study of the natural sciences, especially geology, in which he has become quite proficient. He has a very valuable collection of geological specimens.
