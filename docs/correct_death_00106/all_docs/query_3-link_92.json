    "text": "Blending fact with fiction, Jerry Stahl recreates the sad, sad life of Roscoe Arbuckle in “I, Fatty.” The author’s technique is more of interest than the facts of the story — Arbuckle’s tale of woe is well-known — but Stahl’s inventive voice keeps even familiar elements of the comedian’s life interesting.\n\nStahl, whose all-encompassing heroin habit while he was a scribe for “Alf” and “Moonlighting” is recounted in his harrowing autobiography “Permanent Midnight,” feels more than a little kinship with Arbuckle’s experience in chew-you-up and spit-you-out Hollywood.\n\nThe introduction of the novel recounts Stahl’s arrest for drugs in front of what was once Arbuckle’s house in the West Adams district of Los Angeles. It’s used as a framing device to introduce the rest of the story in first-person narrative: The conceit is that Fatty, as it turns out, was a junkie and was made to recount his life by his assistant who delivered heroin as a reward. The novel is a collection of these drug-earning tales.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nTales told in the first person do have their limits, and when it comes to the death of Virginia Rappe, the style lets the reader down. Stahl’s blending of narrative and historical record may have been better used on a figure that was less well known — his attempts at ominous foreshadowing fall flat when you know that Arbuckle is going to become one of the players in the ignominious court case.\n\nRappe, variously described as an up-and-coming actress, a nude model, a conniving prostitute or a walking saint, died — most likely from a botched abortion — after a raucous party in the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco. Inflamed by the vitriolic moralizing of William Randolph Hearst’s newspapers — where the accusation was made that Arbuckle sodomized Rappe with a Coke bottle, although evidence of the sort was never presented in court — Arbuckle is charged with manslaughter and put on trial three times before he was acquitted.\n\nEmotionally, the case left Arbuckle a wreck — friend Buster Keaton repeatedly said that Arbuckle died of a broken heart — and for better or for worse it is the voice of the demonized funny man that Stahl hones in on to set the tone for the novel.\n\nThe tone of self-deprecating irony that Stahl uses is much more commonplace in modern times than in Arbuckle’s era, but it adds a weary edge to the character’s personality that comes across as entirely appropriate given his insecurities. Arbuckle hated the nickname “Fatty” and was continually chafed by its popularity.\n\n“I marched everybody into the gymnasium to demonstrate reverse somersaults and the art of falling on my keister. ‘I’ve got a lot of keister to fall on, fellas, so I understand if you’re jealous.’ Big laugh for El Fattopotamus.”\n\nThe gags that made Arbuckle famous, such as the birth of the pie-in-the-face routine, also are described in dry, business-like tones, with little of the manic glee shown in the films when the gag unspooled.\n\nStahl did his homework — an extensive bibliography is included in “I, Fatty” — but his creativity keeps the tale from becoming too academic. It’s a compelling look at Hollywood’s early — but don’t dare call them innocent — days."
