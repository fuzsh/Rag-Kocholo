        "text": "James Curtis notes, correctly, in his recent Buster Keaton biography, that MOONSHINE, the Roscoe Arbuckle short, with Buster in support, tells a very strange story through its intertitles. The plot unfolding onscreen is a rambunctious knockabout with “Fatty” as a revenue man and Buster as his sidekick, taking on a shack full of secret ‘shine brewers. But in the title cards, a strange meta narrative unfolds:\n\nThis struck me as bizarre and a little bit irritating when I last saw it. Curtis suspects it probably went over the audience’s heads in 1918, and it probably would. Even without it, there are bizarre moments, like Al St John materialising out of the scenery via dissolve, a gurning wraith…\n\nSomething doesn’t rub me right about those titles. I’m morally certain that the intertitles we see in the film today are not the originals, but later interpolations. I can’t prove it, but I have some evidence…\n\nMy real reason is instinctual — the titles feel like a redraft, somebody repurposing the film and trying to inject their own sense of humour into it. Surely, if Arbuckle and his team wanted to parody movie-making, while also exploiting the then-fashionable subject of illicit whisky distilling, they would have included some movie-makers and movie-making apparatus? After all, they were making a movie, so all that stuff was to hand. The only visual evidence of the mock-behind-the-scenes angle is when a shack explodes and then, in true LOST HIGHWAY fashion, implodes/reintegrates. Somebody mucking about with an optical printer… True, the movie features an impressive split-screen gag where an entire army of revenue men emerge from a single jalopy (specially rigged by Buster so it wouldn’t wobble and betray the join). But that at least is a clear JOKE. And not at the expense of the movie — these joky bits of text have the feel of Fractured Flickers or Unreal Newsreels, things which sampled old silent films and jazzed them up with supposedly hip new attitudes…\n\nThe sense of humour feels modern. Of course, some old movies astonish us with how modern the comedy is. But not, I would suggest, Fatty Arbuckle shorts. Some of the slang feels modern too. “Babe” was certainly a term used in the teens and twenties, but somehow the way it’s used here feels… wrong. More sixties, if anything.\n\nTo add to the mystery, THIS version of the film substitutes “girl” for “babe” but keeps the rest.\n\nIf audiences at the time were exposed to this kind of po-mo “wit”, did they find it baffling, as Curtis suggests? We have no way to ask them, but we can read the reviews, and even a little news item about the film’s production:\n\nQuite detailed and very positive reviews. The auto scene gets a special mention, and the location shooting comes in for praise. The first one does say that “the titles are examples of real wit.” But both are very clear that this is a straight burlesque plot about moonshiners and their violent suppression, not a parody of Hollywood moviemaking.\n\nThis item tells us that, unusually for an Arbuckle film, MOONSHINE received glowing praise in the New York Times. Could this be because of its advanced narrative play?\n\nIt doesn’t sound much like it — the reviewer seems to have appreciated the film as a straightforward laugh-getter without pretensions.\n\nHere’s the news item about the shoot:\n\nNo mention of Arbuckle’s satirical ambitions, but you wouldn’t expect that. The piece is extremely frustrating, hinting at narrow escapes from death by flooding by Roscoe, Buster and the gang, but no actual stories.\n\nMOONSHINE’s history is suggestive: firstly, it was rereleased along with Arbuckle’s other Comique productions in 1921, after he had moved into features and thus the monthly supply of Fatty films had dried up. Could somebody have taken it upon themself to retitle it? To me, 1921 still doesn’t seem late enough for this tomfoolery.\n\nBut wait! MOONSHINE was thought to survive only in fragments for a long time, then this complete version showed up. Thanks to YouTube we can see the fragments — which lack the fatuous meta-narrative angle completely —\n\nInstead of the baffling “We begin with a rehearsal between two bootleggers,” (the Masters of Cinema Blu-ray gives this as “Rehearsal of the first scene, with two bootleggers” — where has the variation crept in from?) we get “Hidden up in the hills was the bootleggers’ hide-out.” And it continues in similarly prosaic fashion. The “wit” praised by the movie critic isn’t strongly evidenced, except in a more laconic, Keatonesque matter-of-factness.\n\nWhat about this, though? “Fatty witnesses the scene and intervenes — not to help Alice, but to remind her that a girl must never go against her father’s wishes. Alice falls for Fatty’s authoritarian charm.” That’s clearly a bit of exposition added in later to cover for missing footage, where the surviving material has devolved into blipverts for a coming attraction that’s long gone. But the person compiling this latter-day title obviously has access to a synopsis, and the next titles for this scene (“I love you!” — more or less the same as in the cheeky version) have either survived or, more likely, been reconstructed from some historical record.\n\nThe whole exploding shack bit is missing, so we can’t tell if the shack sucked itself back together again originally, or if this trick was added by my proposed cine-vandal. The inexplicable bit where Buster and Al turn into chimpanzees (mentally) is missing, so there’s no help from that direction. “The fancy version has “A meal for nouveau-riche moonshiners” to introduce the bad guys eating. The fragmentary version says “Prisoner’s mealtime” when Fatty eats.\n\nThe film ends with dismaying abruption as Buster is shot in the ass.\n\nThese fragments were discovered in the Cineteca Nazionale in Rome. It’s possible the incomplete print there was titled in Italian, and these titles were mocked up later from translations. (When Fatty discovers a copy of The Count of Monte Cristo, the frontispiece is in French — does that mean anything? It’s a French novel, of course…) They lack any stylish “Paramount-Arbuckle Comedy” frippery. The DESIGN of the clever-clever versions is superior and doubtless authentic. But they contain quite a few typos — something of a trademark of Lobster Films, who did the restoration.\n\nThe picture quality varies violently throughout — obviously at least two prints have been Frankensteined together. And the snarky intertitles seem to come and go accordingly — or not quite accordingly. At random, would be more like it.\n\nDigging around, I found a set of program notes from 1974 — before the film was considered lost, I guess, and then refound/reconstructed. This review deals with a poor quality French print with French titles. The curator comments that all that’s lost are the satirical intertitles commenting on the film itself — it’s not clear if the curator could read French, or had read them on a previous occasion in English. So these titles date at least that far back — but I suspected as much.\n\nOf course the images are more important than the words, and Lobster have done a fantastic job on those — without their work, this discussion would be impossible. But Buster was concerned about the integrity of his intertitles — at the end of his life, he was concerned that the single word title “Bartender,” in THE GENERAL needed to be restored, replacing “Barkeep,” which was a mistranslation (into French, I think, then back again). A bartender, Buster explained, was someone who would immediately be drafted. A barkeep was a proprietor, a man of property and responsibility. The distinction mattered.\n\nReading the reviews online it seems people love these wacky intertitles. They certainly add to the film’s loony, out-of-control atmosphere. But are they real? Arbuckle, credited as writer, could be eccentric, and also sloppy. His boys would mischievously encourage him to go further.\n\nSomewhere, a censor’s office may have preserved the text of the original titles for MOONSHINE, and then we could know. Or think we know."
