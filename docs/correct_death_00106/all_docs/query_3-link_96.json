    "text": "An interesting video on you tube entitled the Great Reza Shah Pahlavi shows an officer stepping out of what appears to be the very same car that is on display in Tehran. The video is blurry and grainy but at 6:53 in the video you can clearly see the fender headlamp of the car for a mere split second before the camera cuts to another shot. This was shot during the Shahs funeral in 1944. The car is clearly not the white limousine the Shah ordered and it is equipped with sidemounts.\n\nIf that was the Shahs limousine that was ordered in 1930 then it had clearly been repainted and equipped with side mounts by the time of his death in 1944.\n\nHowever, in a book entitled August 1941: The Anglo-Russian occupation of Iran, published in 1997, the author states: “Among the fleet of luxury automobiles owned by the Reza Shah, his favorite was a 1930 gold plated Pierce-Arrow”. It goes on to say the Shah has “three or four of this make in addition to several Lincoln’s and a Rolls Royce.”\n\nThe author then goes on to say; Finally, it is not known what became of this car, it is not on display in the auto museum that was set up in Tehran after the 1979 revolution for the purpose of displaying the luxury cars which belonged to the two Shahs. We can only speculate that the Reza Shah took this car with him in 1941,or it was subsequently shipped out by his son and successor.\n\nWithout actually knowing what became of the Shah’s white limousine, is it possible this car could be another Pierce made to look like the Shah’s limo?… or perhaps another limo ordered for one of his ministers or cabinet members?…\n\nWithout any records from the P-A factory to know how many cars were ordered and shipped out in 1930 and to whom, is it possible they built more than one limo for the Shah?…\n\nThoughts, ideas anyone?…"
