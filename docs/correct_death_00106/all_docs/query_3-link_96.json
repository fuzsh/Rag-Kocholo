        "text": "This car certainly puts any Packard V12,Cadillac,Peerless or\n\nLocomobile of its time,at a distinct disadvantage.Its a joy that\n\nsomebody kept the scrap man away from melting all that aluminum\n\nand dissecting the rest.I’m curious about color choice.Is it authentic?\n\nDid Roscoe(Fatty) have a fettish for eggplants or was it starlets?\n\nAre there any Pierce-Arrows out there that are more valuable than\n\nthis car?What a fitting tribute to Hollywood excess,one of the most\n\ncontroversial and popular stars of the time,and a great customizing\n\nfirm,Don Lee.The Silver-Arrow might bring more money now,but the custom\n\nwith the largest displacement engine in U.S. motoring history with\n\nHollywood credentials must rival it in the future.\n\nHere’s the descriiption from the ad, including info on the color selection:\n\nDescription:\n\nThis 1919 Pierce-Arrow was delivered in 1918 as an A-4 chassis to Don Lee Coach & Bodyworks in Los Angeles, Calif. which specialized in custom bodies for special clients such as movie stars. The famous silent movie comedian Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle was its first owner. Arbuckle had the car custom built in 1919 at the height of his film career. The head designer for this special project was a young, new designer by the name of Harley Earl, who would become perhaps the most famous designer in the history of the automobile. From the unique “purple-blue” body to the all-white tires, the car mirrors the eccentric character of the famous Hollywood actor. The large 825cid, 6 cylinder engine 66 A-4 Pierce-Arrow chassis is one of the last Model 66 Pierce-Arrows made and there are only seven of the Model 66 A-4 surviving today. In 1976, Tom Barrett of Scottsdale, Ariz. acquired the car in original condition and performed a minor cosmetic restoration including a dark blue paint job. In 1982, Don Williams of the Blackhawk Collection acquired the Pierce from Barrett. The Pierce then spent 24 years in the Blackhawk Collection until 2006 when Jim Schenck acquired her and decided to do an extensive Pebble Beach quality restoration. Not only the extensive restoration was done, originality was carefully maintained down to the original “purple-blue” paint and its original white tires. Schenck showed her at the 2007 Pebble Beach Concours d’ Elegance where she took First Place in Class B (Vintage 1916-1924).\n\nIt is one of the most famous Pierce-Arrows in existence.\n\nOver the last few years this Pierce-Arrow has on the floor at the Blackhawk Museum in Danville, CA where I am a docent. The car is quite popular with the public in part due to its visual impact among the conservative cars of the 20s&30s but also do to the “Fatty Arbuckle” stories. Fatty was one of the most popular silent screen actors in Hollywood as well as being a comedian, director and screenwriter. Fatty attended a party at the St Francis Hotel in San Francisco with a young starlet in 1921. She became drunk and ill at the party and died four days later at a sanitarium known for performing abortions. Arbuckle was accused by a well-known madam of rape and accidentally killing the starlet. After three trials Fatty was finally acquitted by the jury. The car and the stories will certainly result in a high price in the market place.\n\nAn article from the Pittsburgh Press on July 13, 1930, calls the Shah’s Pierce the “Costliest Auto made” and and goes on to say “The car itself cost $18,500 dollars, but the lavish addition of diamonds and other costly jewels furnished by the Shah himself is said to raise the price of the finished product far above that of any auto made”\n\nAnother article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette dated April 19, 1930, states ” One glance at the car, a snow white Pierce-Arrow, is sufficient to convince one that his nibs, the Shah, when he wants an automobile, goes in for classy jobs. What, with all the gold and diamonds, the Shah’s new buggy is the costliest auto built.”\n\nAnother article from the Burra Record (Australian newspaper)on May 20, 1931 headline reads “Costliest car in the world.” Owned by the Shah of Persia,though it does not state the actual price in the article.\n\nWhen the car was on display in New York City prior to being shipped out, armed guards watched over the display.\n\nThe Shah’s car is still extant in the National Car Museum in Tehran. It has been restored and repainted a dark blue and side-mounts have been added. It still retains the gold finish on the bright work but I doubt that it is the actual 24ct gold that was used when originally built.\n\nI wrote to the museum asking for more information on the history of the car but received no response. (Not surprised actually!)\n\nSeveral videos of the Shah’s car are available on Youtube. One of the better ones is entitled classical cars museum of Iran. It is interesting to note that, while this beautiful car is on display, apparently no one in the museum knows how to clean whitewalls!\n\nI must applaud the Shah’s choice of the finest in automobiles.This\n\nautomobile is priceless in the literal sense.However,unless you have\n\nto have wolfhound rugs,countless jewels,and liberal gold on your\n\ncar,Fatty’s moving monument,knocks the socks off of the Shah’s\n\njewelry case.Curb appeal wise,Fatty’s would steal the show from\n\nthe rather unfortunate looking Brunn Town car,if the two were parked\n\nnext to each other when the Shah’s was new!What custom car could make\n\nFatty look small behind the wheel?The car screamed Hollywood gotbucks\n\nand masculinity,but wasn’t gaudy or tasteless.Besides the 66 would\n\nout-perform the 1930 car in most ways except stopping.Ray Dietrich\n\nnever conjured up a car as uninspiring as the one the Shah purchased.\n\nAn interesting video on you tube entitled the Great Reza Shah Pahlavi shows an officer stepping out of what appears to be the very same car that is on display in Tehran. The video is blurry and grainy but at 6:53 in the video you can clearly see the fender headlamp of the car for a mere split second before the camera cuts to another shot. This was shot during the Shahs funeral in 1944. The car is clearly not the white limousine the Shah ordered and it is equipped with sidemounts.\n\nIf that was the Shahs limousine that was ordered in 1930 then it had clearly been repainted and equipped with side mounts by the time of his death in 1944.\n\nHowever, in a book entitled August 1941: The Anglo-Russian occupation of Iran, published in 1997, the author states: “Among the fleet of luxury automobiles owned by the Reza Shah, his favorite was a 1930 gold plated Pierce-Arrow”. It goes on to say the Shah has “three or four of this make in addition to several Lincoln’s and a Rolls Royce.”\n\nThe author then goes on to say; Finally, it is not known what became of this car, it is not on display in the auto museum that was set up in Tehran after the 1979 revolution for the purpose of displaying the luxury cars which belonged to the two Shahs. We can only speculate that the Reza Shah took this car with him in 1941,or it was subsequently shipped out by his son and successor.\n\nWithout actually knowing what became of the Shah’s white limousine, is it possible this car could be another Pierce made to look like the Shah’s limo?… or perhaps another limo ordered for one of his ministers or cabinet members?…\n\nWithout any records from the P-A factory to know how many cars were ordered and shipped out in 1930 and to whom, is it possible they built more than one limo for the Shah?…\n\nThoughts, ideas anyone?…\n\nIt is the same car. The Shah’s garage had a 29 D/C Phaeton, a 1930 series A Limo. and the town car. There may be others. I own the lap robe from the Brunn town car, I purchased it from Hermann Brunn’s daughter in the early 90’s, the family kept it and never sent it with the car. The family crest on the robe matches the crest on the rear seats and door panels. My guess is the fenders from the limo and the spare tires were placed on the town car as the town car did not have any way to carry a spare, not a good idea in a dessert where all the roads in the city were still used mostly by animals and carts. Imagine all the nails from the horse shoes! Ed\n\nThank you for clarifying this mystery Edgar, though I would still like to know when it was repainted and the side mounts added.\n\nWhen it was restored, it appears the jewels in the Shah’s crests were removed, as they clearly do not appear in the photos or videos taken of the car. Perhaps they were used to pay for the restoration of the car!\n\nIt would be something if there was a way we could get that car to a PAS meet sometime in the near future but I’m not going to hold my breath on that one!\n\nI have photos of all three cars in the dessert in 1932 if my memory serves me, and the town car looked like it did at the factory. There have been lots of rumors about the price of this town car, people toss out 20 or 30 grand. I have seen a early factory invoice (I was not allowed to make a copy) that showed just under 14 thousand dollars. Pierce built a 1931 series 42 touring that was valued at over $100,000 when it was displayed in Kansas City at the dealers auto show. It had armed guards and a small low fence around it. The price was due to diamonds on the hubcaps and a dash covered in jewels. I have a photo of the car on display as well as the dash board. The car was sold to a Maharaja in India. The car is still in India, minus the jewels. Ed"
