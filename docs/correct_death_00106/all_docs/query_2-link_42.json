        "text": "THE NEW YORK TIMES, June 30, 1933 * Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle death (1st report) * Silent film actor, comedian and director Page 17 has one column headings that include: \"FATTY ARBUCKLE DIES IN HIS SLEEP\" \"Film Comedian, Central Figure in Coast Tragedy in 1921, Long Barred From Screen\" \"On Eve Of His Comeback\" and more with photo. (see) Always nice to have notable events in history reported in this World famous publication. Other news, sports and advertisements of the day with much on the Jack Sharley vs. Primo Carnera heavyweight boxing title fight. Complete in 38 pages, this is the rare rag edition that was produced on very high quality newsprint, with a high percentage of cotton & linen content, allowing the issues to remain very white & sturdy into the present. Given the subscription cost, libraries & institutions rather than individuals were the primary subscribers of these high-quality editions. Nice condition."
