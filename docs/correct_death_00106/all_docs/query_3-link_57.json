    "text": "The General has long been praised as one of the greatest films ever made; it was one of the first to be included in the Library of Congress for the National Film Registry as part of the National Film Preservation Act.\n\n\n\nHis other silents range from the intimate, personal films like The Cameraman to the epic, like Our Hospitality, to the absurd and surrealistic, like The Playhouse and Sherlock Jr. Some of the films depend on astounding special effects for their magic; others on Keaton’s own remarkable physical acrobatics; still others on their unique view of human beings trying to live in a modern world.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Buster Keaton’s sphinx-like face is to be seen at the Capitol this week in a nautical film-farce, called ‘The Navigator,’ wherein his wildest emotions are reflected by an occasional upward turn of his right eyebrow. Now and again the Keaton eyes evince a suggestion of life, but his lips barely budge. To have a contrast to this comedian’s placidity of countenance, we had only to look at those watching this picture. Mouths were wide open in explosions of laughter and eyes sparkled with merriment . . . . Mr. Keaton deserves untold credit for his originality in thinking up most of the funny scenes.”\n\n\n\n— The New York Times, October 13, 1924\n\n\n\nKeaton was the main creative force behind his silent film work. A gifted writer, director, technician and performer, he was unquestionably a visionary. Yet he always gave on- and off-screen credit to others, once mocking (in his landmark short The Playhouse) his more egotistical colleagues like Thomas H. Ince and Charlie Chaplin, who hogged credit for everything.\n\n\n\nClyde Bruckman, co-writer of several of the best films and some of the Columbia shorts and television work, confirmed this modesty: “I could tell you and so could [writer] Jean Havez if he were alive that those wonderful stories were ninety percent Buster’s. I was often ashamed to take the money, much less the credit.” Keaton’s modesty about his work is partially responsible for the surprising fact that much of his influence on American humor and on filmmaking has been overlooked."
