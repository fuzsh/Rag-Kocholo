        "text": "Following a brief army stint as a cryptographer and entertainer on the back lines of France in World War I, Keaton was, in his own words, “back from the back” (his “career at the rear”) and was making his own two-reelers in Charlie Chaplin’s old studio in California starting in 1920. His unique and dramatically visual style was evident right from the beginning in his first short films The High Sign and One Week.\n\n“No movie actor ever had a faster rise to stardom than Buster Keaton, ” noted Eddie Cline, one of his co-directors, in 1957. “In less than two years, he was famous all over the world.”\n\nHis best friend Roscoe Arbuckle did not fare as well. While Buster was becoming world famous, Arbuckle was felled by a tragedy that would change Hollywood forever. The gentle Arbuckle was arrested for raping and murdering a young actress, Virginia Rappé, who died after attending a party given by Roscoe in San Francisco. Following three manslaughter trials that received an inordinate amount of sensationalized, damaging and often inaccurate publicity, Arbuckle was completely cleared.\n\nUnfortunately and unfairly, Hollywood and the public still rose up against him and his career was ruined. The end of Arbuckle’s career at age 34 foreshadowed the end of Keaton’s control over his films just a few years later, at age 33. The Arbuckle case, plus a couple of other scandals at the same time, encouraged Hollywood to develop stricter guidelines for the personal behavior of its stars, including a “morals clause” in all contracts, and to develop censorship for the films.\n\nMeanwhile, Keaton’s career continued to soar. Within three years, he was making two feature films a year, films that would forever ensure his reputation. Although his films were never as popular in their day as those of his nearest rivals Charlie Chaplin or Harold Lloyd, Keaton was undoubtedly an important and established star.\n\nFrom 1920 to 1928, Buster Keaton made 19 short films and 12 features, all with his distinctive style—unlike anything seen before on the screen. Critics agree that even the worst films, such as the shorts Neighbors or My Wife’s Relations, are technically superior to the best movies being made by almost anyone else at the time—Chaplin included. For Keaton comprehended, far more than anyone else, the potential of that marvelous toy, the camera, and with comprehension came a new kind of comedy.\n\nAccidents happened on occasion, although friends later said that Keaton seemed impervious to physical pain. During the shooting of The Electric House (1921), his slapshoe got stuck in an escalator and crushed his foot. While he was recuperating, under doctor’s orders not to do anything strenuous, Keaton made The Playhouse—a stunning experiment in special effects—but also a film in which he performs an extended dance. Keaton apparently did not consider dancing to be strenuous.\n\nOn Our Hospitality (1923), he almost drowned in a river sequence. On The General (1926), he was knocked unconscious by a cannon. On the Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1927) set, he broke his nose (playing baseball), and the most remarkable of all, he broke his neck shooting a scene for Sherlock Jr. (1924). In the scene, he runs along the top of a train and then grabs a waterspout. Water gushes down on the track and Buster is obscured for a moment. During that moment, he was forced by the pressure of the water down onto the tracks, where he hit his neck. But if you watch the film closely, you see Buster get up and run off—still in the same take. It was years before he discovered what had given him those awful headaches.\n\nHis most famous film—certainly the one of which he was proudest—was The General, made in 1926. Based on a true Civil War story, The General is the Keaton film most modern audiences are familiar with. It is essentially a dramatic story of Northern spies who steal a Confederate train but are thwarted by one determined man—the train’s engineer, played by Buster. As much action-suspense as comedy, The General’s humor comes from its view of human behavior."
