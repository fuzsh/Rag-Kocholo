    "text": "LOS ANGELES TIMES, June 29, 1933The banner headline announces: \"\" with a ftpg. photo of: \"Roscoe (Fatty) Arbuckle\". Arbuckle was a very famous film actor, comedian and director, mostly during the silent film era. But the later portion of his career was clouded by his 3 trials for the murder of actress Virginia Rappe (see hyperlink for more). Great to have this report in a newspaper from the home of the film industry.Presumed complete with 4 sections, cracking at the right portion of the central fold with some chipping loss and separation, some margin tears. Should be handled with care."
