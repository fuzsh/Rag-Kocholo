I can hardly believe of the distant thirties now, a way of life which I adopted quite voluntarily from a sense of fun. More than four hundred films - and I suppose there would have been many many more if I had not suffered during the same period from other obsessions - four novels had to be written, not to speak of a travel book which took me away for months to Mexico, far from the Pleasure- Dome - all those Empires and Odeons of a luxury and a bizarre taste which we shall never see again. in that life\n\nHow,\n\nI find myself wondering, could I possibly have written all these reviews? yet I remember opening the envelopes, which contained the gilded cards of invitation, for the morning Press performances (mornings when I should have been struggling with Brighton Rock and The Power And The Glory) with a sense of curiosity and anticipation. These films were an escape - escape from that hellish\n\nAnd\n\nSix, from the secondary character who escape for an hour and a half from the melancholy which falls inexorably round the novelist when he has lived for too many months on end in his private world. The idea of reviewing films came to me at a cocktail-party after the dangerous third Martini. I was talking to Derek Verschoyle, the Literary Editor of The Spectator. The Spectator had hitherto neglected films and I suggested to him I should fill the gap - I thought that, in the unlikely event of his accepting my offer it might be fun for two or three weeks. I never imagined it would remain fun for four and a half years and only end in a different world, a world at war. Until I came to re-read these notices the other day I thought they abruptly ended with my review of The Young Mr Lincoln. If there is something a little absent-minded about that review, it was because, just as I began to write it on the morning of 3 September 1939, the first air-raid siren of the war sounded and I laid the review aside so as to make notes from my high Hampstead lodging on the destruction of London below. 'Woman passes with dog on lead,' I noted, 'and pauses by lamp post.\" Then the all-clear sounded and I returned to Henry Fonda. These were not the first film reviews I wrote. At Oxford I had appointed myself film critic of the Oxford Outlook, a literary magazine which appeared once a term and which I edited. Warning Shadows, Brumes d'Automne, The Student of Prague these are the silent films of the twenties of which I can remember whole scenes still. I was a passionate reader of Close Up which was edited by Kenneth Macpherson and Bryher and published from a chateau in Switzerland. Marc Allegret was the Paris Correspondent and Pudovkin contributed articles on montage. I was horrified by the arrival of 'talkies' (it seemed the end of the film as an art form), just as later I regarded colour with justifiable suspicion. 'Technicolor,' I wrote in 1935, 'plays havoc with the women's faces; they all, young and old, have the same healthy weather-beaten skins.\" Curiously enough it was a detective story with Chester Morris which converted me to the talkies - for the first time in that picture I was aware of selected sounds; until then every shoe had squeaked and every door-handle had creaked. I notice that the forgotten film Becky Sharp gave me even a certain hope for colour. Re-reading these reviews of more than thirty years ago I find many prejudices which are modified now only by the sense of nostalgia. I had distinct reservations about Greta Garbo whom I compared to a beautiful Arab mare, and Hitchcock's 'inadequate sense of reality' irritated me and still does - how inexcusably he spoilt\n\nproblem of construction obstinately refused to\n\nin\n\ncome\n\nChapter\n\nalive,\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Thirty-Nine Steps. I still believe I was right (whatever Monsieur Truffaut may say) when I wrote: 'His films consist of a series of small \"amusing\" melodramatic situations: the murderer's button dropped on the baccarat board; the strangled organist's hands prolonging the notes in the empty church very perfunctorily he .\n\nbuilds\n\nup\n\nsistencies,\n\n.\n\nno attention on the way to inconloose ends, psychological absurdities) and then drops them: they mean to these tricky situations (paying\n\nnothing: they lead to nothing.\" The thirties too were a period of 'respectable' film biographies - Rhodes, Zola, Pasteur, Parnell and the like - and of historical romances which only came to a certain comic life in the hands of Cecil B. de Mille (Richard Coeur-de-Lion was married to Berengaria according to the rites of the Anglican Church). I preferred the Westerns, the crime films, the farces, the frankly commercial, and I am glad to see that in reviewing one of these forgotten commercial films I gave a warm welcome to a new star, Miss Ingrid Bergman - 'what star before has made her first appearance on the international screen with a highlight gleaming on her nose-tip*. There were dangers, I was to discover, in film-reviewing. On one occasion I opened a letter to find a piece of shit enclosed. I have always - though probably incorrectly - believed that it was a piece of aristocratic shit, for I had made cruel fun a little while before of a certain French marquis. Thirty years later in Paris at a dinner of the haute bourgeoisie I sat opposite him and was charmed by his conversation. I longed to ask him the truth, but I was daunted by the furniture. Then, of course, there was the Shirley Temple libel action. The review which set 20th Century-Fox alight cannot be found here for obvious reasons. I kept on my bathroom wall, until a bomb removed the wall, the statement of claim - that I had accused 20th Century-Fox of 'procuring' Miss Temple 'for immoral purposes'. Lord Hewart. the Lord Chief Justice, sent the papers in the case to the Director of Public Prosecutions, so that ever since that time I have been traceable on the files of Scotland Yard. From film-reviewing it was only a small step to script-writing. That also was a danger, but a necessary one as I had a family to support and I remained in debt to my publishers until the war came. I had persistently attacked the films made by Alexander Korda and perhaps he became curious to meet his enemy. He asked my agent to bring me to Denham and when we were alone he asked if I had any film story in mind. I had none, so I began to improvise a thriller - early morning on Platform 1 at Paddington. the platform empty, except for one man who is waiting for the last train from Wales. From below his raincoat a trickle of blood forms a pool on the platform. 'Yes? and then?' 'It would take too long to tell you the whole plot - and the idea needs a lot more\n\nworking\n\nout.\"\n\nDenham\n\nhalf an hour later to work for eight weeks on what seemed an extravagant salary, and the worst and least successful of all Korda's productions thus began. So did our friendship which endured and deepened till his death, in spite of two bad screenplays and my reviews which remained unfavourable. There was never a man who bore less malice, and I think of him with affection - even love as the only film producer I have ever known with whom I could spend days and nights of conversation without so much as mentioning the cinema. Years later, after the war was over. I wrote two more screenplays for Korda and Carol Reed. The Fallen Idol and The Third Man, and I hope they atoned a little for the prentice scripts of which I prefer to forget even the titles. If I had remained a film critic, the brief comic experience which I had then of Hollywood might have been of value to me, for I learned at first hand what a I\n\nleft\n\nIntroduction\n\nmay have\n\nto endure at the hands of a producer. (One of the difficult tasks assign his praise or blame to the right quarter.) Mr David Selznick, famous for having produced the world's best-selling film, Gone With The Wind, held the American rights in The Third Man and, by the terms of the contract with Korda, the director was bound to consult him about the script sixty days before shooting began. So Carol Reed and I journeyed west. Our first meeting with Mr Selznick at La Jolla in California promised badly, and the dialogue remains as fresh in my mind as the day when it was spoken. After a brief greeting he got down to serious discussion. He said, 'I don't like the title.'\n\ndirector\n\nof a\n\ncritic is to\n\n'No?\n\nWe thought\n\n'Listen, boys,\n\nwho\n\n.' .\n\n.\n\nthe hell a simple\n\nis\n\ngoing to a film called The Third\n\nManT\n\nremembered.' Mr Selznick shook his head reproachfully. 'You can do better than that, Graham,' he said, using my Christian name with a readiness I was not prepared for. 'You are a writer. A good writer. I'm no writer, but you are. Now what we want it's not right, mind you, of course it's not right, I'm not saying it's right, but then I'm no writer and you are, what we want is something like Night in Vienna, a title which 'Well,' I said,\n\n'it's\n\ntitle. It's\n\neasily\n\nthem in.' 'Graham and I will think about it,' Carol Reed interrupted with haste. It was a phrase I was to hear Reed frequently repeat, for the Korda contract had omitted to state that the director was under any obligation to accept Mr Selznick's advice. Reed during the days that followed, like an admirable stonewaller, blocked every will bring\n\nball.\n\nWe 'It\n\npassed on to Mr Selznick's view of the story. won't do, boys,' he said, 'it won't do. It's sheer buggery.'\n\n'Buggery?'\n\nwhat you learn in your English schools.' don't understand.'\n\n'It's \"I\n\nto Vienna looking for his friend. He finds his friend's dead. doesn't he go home then?' After all the months of writing his destructive view of the whole venture left me speechless. He shook his grey head at me. 'It's just buggery, boy.' I began weakly to argue. I said, 'But this character - he has a motive of revenge. He has been beaten up by a military policeman.' I played a last card. 'Within twenty-four hours he's in love with Harry Lime's girl.' Mr Selznick shook his head sadly. 'Why didn't he go home before that?' That. I think, was the end of the first day's conference. Mr Selznick removed to Hollywood and we followed him - to a luxurious suite in Santa Monica, once the home of Hearst's film-star mistress. During the conferences which followed I remember there were times when there seemed to be a kind of grim reason in Mr Selznick's criticisms - surely here perhaps there was a fault in 'continuity', I hadn't properly 'established' this or that. I would forget momentarily the lesson which I had learned as a film critic - that to 'establish' something is almost invariably wrong and that 'continuity' is often the enemy of life.* secretary sat by Mr Selznick's side with her pencil poised. When I was on the point of agreement Carol Reed would quickly interrupt - 'Graham and I will think about it.' There was one conference which I remember in particular because it was the last before we were due to return to England. The secretary had made forty pages of notes by this time, but she had been unable to record one definite concession on our side. The conference began as usual about 10.30 p.m. and finished after 4 a.m. Always by the time we reached Santa Monica dawn would be touching the Pacific.\n\n'This guy\n\nRight?\n\ncomes\n\nWhy\n\nA\n\n*\n\nJean Cocteau has even argued thai the mistakes of a continuin\n\nuirl\n\nbelonged to the unconscious poetry of a\n\nfilm.\n\nIntroduction 'There's something I don't understand in this script, Graham. Why the hell does ?' He described some extraordinary action on Lime's part. Harry Lime. .\n\n.\n\n'But he doesn't,' I said. Mr Selznick looked at me for a moment in silent amazement. 'Christ, boys,' he said, 'I'm thinking of a different script.' He lay down on his sofa and crunched a Benzedrine. In ten minutes he was as fresh as ever, unlike ourselves. I look back on David Selznick now with affection. The forty pages of notes remained unopened on Reed's files, and since the film proved a success, I suspect Selznick forgot that the criticisms had ever been made. Indeed, when next I was in New York he invited me to lunch to discuss a project. He said, 'Graham, I've got a great idea for a film. It's just made for you.' I had been careful on this occasion not to take a third Martini. 'The Life of St Mary Magdalene,' he said. 'I'm sorry,' I said, 'no. It's not really in my line.' He didn't try to argue. T have another idea,' he said. 'It will appeal to you as a Catholic. You know how next year they have what's called the Holy Year in Rome. Well, I want to make a picture called The Unholy Year. It will show all the com.' mercial rackets that go on, the crooks 'An interesting notion,' I said. 'We'll shoot it in the Vatican.\" T doubt if they will give you permission for that.' 'Oh sure they will,' he said. 'You see we'll write in one Good Character.' (I am reminded by this story of another memorable lunch in a suite at the Dorchester when Mr Sam Zimbalist asked me if I would revise the last part of a script which had been prepared for a remake of Ben Hur. 'You see,\" he said, 'we find a sort of anti-climax after the Crucifixion.') Those indeed were the days. I little knew that the reign of Kubla Khan was nearly over and that the Pleasure-Dome would soon be converted into an enormous Bingo hall, which would provide quite other dreams to housewives than had the Odeons and the Empires. I had regretted the silent films when the talkies moved in and I had regretted black and white when Technicolor washed across the screen. So today, watching the latest socially conscious serious film of Monsieur Godard, I sometimes long for these dead thirties, for Cecil B. de Mille and his Crusaders, for the days when almost anything was likely to happen. .\n\n.\n\nGraham Greene\n\nJuly 1935\n\nThe Bride of Frankenstein/The Glass Key/No More Ladies/ Abyssinia Poor harmless Mary Shelley, when she dreamed that she was watched by pale, yellow, speculative eyes between the curtains of her bed, set in motion a vast machinery of actors, of sound systems and trick shots and yes-men. It rolls on indefinitely, that first dream and the first elaboration of it in her novel, Frankenstein, gathering silliness and solemnity as it goes; presently, I have no doubt, it will be colour-shot and televised; later in the Brave New World to become a smelly. But the one genuine moment of horror, when Mrs Shelley saw the yellow eyes, vanished long ago; and there is nothing in The Bride oj Frankenstein at the Tivoli to scare a child.\n\nThe Bride of Frankenstein: Elsa Lanchcstcr, Colin Clive\n\nJuly 1935\n\nMrs\n\nShelley's dream, but the dream of a committee of film executives go one better than Mrs Shelley and let Frankenstein create a second monster from the churchyard refuse, a woman this time, forgetting that the horror of the first creation is quite lost when it is repeated, and that the breeding of monsters can become no more exciting than the breeding of poultry. In a prologue to the film Mrs Shelley tells Byron and her husband, who has been writing poetry rapidly by the fireside, that she has imagined a sequel to her novel. To think,' says Byron, 'that this little head contains such horrors.' But it is unfair to Mrs Shelley to include the old school tie among the horrors in her little head. Baron Frankenstein wears it with his Harris tweeds, and his school crest is embroidered on his dressing-gown. Mr Colin Clive acts the part with a sturdy old Rugbeian flavour (This heart won't do,' he says to a rather scrubby fag, 'fetch me another'), which was more suitable to Journey's End than a Gothic romance. This is a pompous, badly acted film, full of absurd anachronisms and inconsistencies. It owes its one moment of excitement less to its director than to the strange electric beauty of Miss Elsa Lanchester as Frankenstein's second monster. Her scared vivid face, like the salamander of Mr De La Mare's poem, her bush of hardly human hair, might really have been created by means of the storm-swept\n\nThis\n\nis\n\nnot\n\nwho wanted\n\nkites\n\nto\n\nand the lightning\n\nflash.\n\nhas been a week, as far as fiction is concerned, of the second-rate and the transient. The Glass Key, at the Plaza, unimaginatively gangster, and No More Ladies, at the Empire, slickly 'problem', though brightened by the acting of Mr Charles Ruggles, have come and gone and call for no comment. The best film in London is Abyssinia at the Rialto, the finest travel film I have seen, made by a Swiss expedition and explained in an admirably plain commentary. Here is the last medieval State in all its squalor (the flies swarming round the eyes and nostrils as though they were so much exposed meat in a butcher's shop), its dignity (the whiterobed noblemen flowing into the capital followed by their armed retainers, the caged symbolic lions, and the Lion of Judah himself, his dark cramped dignity, his air of a thousand years of breeding), its democratic justice (the little courts by the roadside, on the railway track; the debtor and creditor chained together; the murderers led off to execution by the relatives of the murdered). This film, alas, may prove the last record of independent Abyssinia. It leaves you with a vivid sense of something very old, very dusty, very cruel, but something dignified in its dirt and popular in its tyranny and perhaps more worth preserving than the bright slick streamlined civilization which threatens it. I don't refer particularly to Italy, but to the whole tone of a time whose popular art is on the level of The Bride of Frankenstein.

But the old tricks are beginning to pall: the romantic use of scenery, the long whiskers of depraved aristocrats shot from one angle, the short whiskers of simple peasants shot from another. Here again are the satirical photographs of heavy statues, though the Communist cameraman is finding it increasingly difficult to get a new slant on the horses and the emperors. The moral of St Petersburg, of course, is just as impeccable as the moral of Mother: the poor musician who can't get a hearing in the capital is Good, and the rich insensitive patrons of music are Bad. You can tell how bad they are by their jewels, r\n\ncherubs and the chandeliers and the pictures of naked women. For a Communist is nothing if he is not a Puritan. At the end of the film the poor musician hears his song sung by convicts on their way to Siberia, and knows that he has done something for Russia. It is a naive, jerky, sentimental film, sometimes genuinely moving, sometimes absurdly inept. Like most Russian films it is best when it is most savagely satirical, and the scenes in which the rich old patron listens with a scared, covetous appreciation to the new revolutionary tune, and in which the Duke of Baden's violinist catches the dowagers in the boxes and stalls with his mannerisms and little tricky melodies, are admirable. It is the serious Socialist idealism that is embarrassing, the sentimental simplification of human nature, the Dickensian plot. O. we feel inclined to protest, we know that you are on the right side, that your ideals are above reproach, but because you are virtuous, must there be no more cakes and ale? Paris Love Song is all cakes and ale. You wouldn't think that Mr Milestone, the director, was a Russian, so deftly has he caught the gay. the shameless Lubitsch manner. It is a silly, charming tale of an Italian count who goes up the Eiffel Tower to pretend to commit suicide, and finds at the top a young woman who intends to their busts, the\n\ncommit suicide. They agree, of course, to make their lovers jealous, and their lovers come together in the same conspiracy. Mr Milestone has made out of this nonsense something light, enchanting, genuinely fantastic. Miss Mary Ellis's is the best light I have seen since Miss Francis appeared in Trouble in Paradise. She is lovely to watch and to listen to; she has a beautiful humorous ease. It is a pity that a film a thousand miles away from any human moral standards should have had tagged to its end a dismal sermon on true love and marriage to satisfy the new purity code. Only the cinema is able in its most fantastic moments to give a sense of absurd unreasoning happiness, of a kind of poignant release: you can't catch it in prose: it belongs to Walt Disney, to Clair's voices from the air. and there is one moment in this film when you have it, as the Count scrambles singing across the roofs to his mistress's room: happiness and freedom, nothing really serious, nothing really lasting, a touching of hands, a tuneful miniature love. A Georgian poet once wrote some dramatic lines about a lighthouse, where, if I remember right, three men had died and six had gone mad. Three men alive\", it went on. *on Flannan Isle. Who thought on three men dead.\" There was something too about *A door ajar and an untouched meal And an overtoppled chair.' That roughly is the plot of the English melodrama. The Phantom Light. It is an exciting, simple story of wreckers on the Welsh coast. Mr Gordon Harker gives his sure-fire Cockney performance as the new keeper unscared by ghost-stories or by the fate of his predecessors, and there is some lovely use of Welsh scenery. That fine actor. Mr Donald Calthrop. is fobbed off in a small part. Mr Calthrop has seldom been lucky in his parts. There is a concentrated venom in his acting, a soured malicious spirituality, a pitiful damned dog air which puts him in the same rank as Mr The Spectator. 12 July 1935 Laughton. acting\n\nSi Petersburg\n\n(USSR.

It is absurd, this panic; it isn't true; it isn't as dramatic as the truth, but the winking out of the yellow candle flames, the surge of blue and grey across the dark hall, the windy encroachment of nocturnal colour, give so much delight to the eye that it would be ungrateful to complain of the silly climax in Bath, the indecisive acting of Miss Miriam Hopkins as Becky. The colour is everything here; the process has at last got well away from blurred mauve windflowers and Killarney lakes, and admits some lovely gradations, from the bright dresses to the delicately suggested landscapes on the walls. The only complaint 1 have against Technicolor is that it plays havoc with the women's faces; they all, young and old, have the same healthy weather-beaten skins. But one must remember that colour has been tried out on the easiest kind of subject; the fancy dress. It would have been harder to produce Barcarole in colour, infinitely harder to produce a realistic film like Public Hero No. 1. If colour is to be of permanent importance a way must be found to use it realistically, not only as a beautiful decoration. It must be made to contribute to our sense of truth. The machine-gun, the cheap striped tie, the battered Buick and the shabby bar will need a subtler colour sense than the Duchess of Richmond's ball, the girls of Miss Pinkerton's Academy, the Marquess of Steyne's dinner for two. I can't help remembering how bright and new were all the dresses in Becky Sharp. Can Technicolor reproduce with the necessary accuracy the suit that has been worn too long, the oily hat?\n\nPublic Hero No. 1 is a conventional but exciting film of a police spy's war against gangsters, in which Mr Chester Morris makes a welcome reappearance in a tough melancholy part punctuated with machine-gun bullets. Just as in G Men, the realistic subject of 'men on a job' is spoilt by a romantic situation (the spy falls for the gangster's innocent sister). Mr Lionel Barry more gives one of the best performances of his career as a drunken crook doctor, a pathetic, farcical figure, who bled gin when the police shot him down. But I prefer the high tragedy mood of Barcarole. This film is made all of one piece. It doesn't mix the romantic and the realistic, but is all romance in the Elizabethan, or perhaps only the Rostand, manner. The story doesn't concern you too closely, so that you can leave the theatre feeling fine and sad, as if your human nature had been paid a very pretty compliment. You have had a taste, between the News of the Week and the Silly Symphony, of the Soul, Love, the Point of Honour, before the lights go on and the second house streams up the aisle, of Jealousy, Sacrifice, great\n\nA\n\nyoung abstract eternal issues, or perhaps only of ingenious artificial situations. reckless womanizer is trapped one night at his club into a bet with a Mexican that he will win his wife before morning.

The unity of a few hours of the Venetian night is beautifully preserved: the tenderness and the despair grow under your eyes in the dance-hall, in the horrible little wine-shop by the canal, as time ticks by. But the film owes most to the acting of Pierre Richard Willm as the lover, with his sharp, handsome young-old face (he makes death real, as he sweats there in the wine-shop in fear of what he's recklessly pledged himself to suffer), of Edwige Feuillere as the gentle cat-like girl, and Roger Karl as Zubaran. the tortured husband with the psychic sense which has enabled him to read a violent end on the young man's features.

It is certainly the film of the month if not of the year; but I doubt if the BBC realize the devastating nature of Mr Grierson's amusing and sometimes beautiful film, the satirical background to these acres of dynamos, the tall steel towers, the conferences and contracts, the enormous staff and the rigid technique of a Kremlin which should be sufficient to govern a nation and is all directed to this end Miss Nina Mae McKinney singing \"Dinah\". Henry Hall's Dance Orchestra playing 'Piccadilly Riot', a spot of pleasure, a spot of dubious education, and a spot, just a spot, of culture when Mr Adrian Boult conducts the Fifth Symphony. This was the most cynical moment of a witty film: Mr Adrian Boult agonizing above his baton, and then his audience - a man turning the pages of his book beside the loud-speaker, a man eating his dinner, nobody giving more than his unconscious mind to Beethoven's music. The picture too of the cramped suburban parlour, the man with his paper, the woman with her sewing, the child at his homework, while \"Piccadilly Riot' reverberates noisily back and forth across the potted plant between flowered wallpaper and flowered wallpaper is even more memorable than the lovely shots of sea and sky and such lyric passages as Mr Chesterton driving gently like a sea-lion through the little tank-like studios. For this is the BBC's chief contribution to man's life: noise while he eats and reads and talks. I wish Mr Grierson had included a few shots from the damper tropics where the noise of the Empire programmes is not disguised at all as entertainment or education, but is just plain wails and windy blasts from instruments hopelessly beaten by atmospherics. At enormous expense from its steel pylon at Daventry the BBC supplies din with the drinks at sundown. James once wrote of La Dame aux Came lias: \"The play has been blown about the world at a fearful rate, but it has never lost its happy juvenility, a charm that nothing can vulgarize. It is all champagne and tears - fresh perversity, fresh credulity, fresh passion, fresh pain.' Something of the same quality belongs to La I 'ie de Boheme. It too has been blown about the world and the studios at a fearful rate, and there still seems to me to linger in this slow decorative English version a little of the happy juvenility.

The Trunk Mystery is one of these: it ought young Wyoming farmer (Mr to take its place immediately with the classics. Franchot Tone), who has come to New York in the hope of finding a brunette to marry, happens to look through the connecting door of his hotel room and sees a dead body on the floor. By the time the manager has been found, the body has disappeared and no one will admit that he can have seen it. With the help of a telephone girl, played in her best silly boy-crazy way by Miss Una Merkel. he sets out to solve the mystery. There is a body, death is somewhere in the background, but what matters is the witty dialogue, the quick intelligent acting of Mr Tone and Miss Merkel. who juggle death so expertly and amusingly between them. One is used to death as a horror, one is used to it as a cypher (the body found stabbed in the library in Chapter One): death as a joke is less familiar: it bathes the film in an atmosphere fantastic, daring and pleasantly heartless. Hands of Orbae is one of those horror films that Mr Shortt.* the head of that curious body of film censors rumoured to consist of retired Army officers and elderly ladies of no occupation, has declared his intention of banning. I don't quite know why. If a horror film is bad. as The Bride of Frankenstein was bad. it isn't horrible at all and may be quite a good joke: if it is a good film, why should Mr Shortt narrow so puritanically the scope of an art? Can we no longer enjoy with clear consciences the stories of Dr M. R. James? It may be sexual perversity which leads us to sneak The Turn of the Screw out of a locked drawer, when all the house is abed, but must our pet vice be denied all satisfaction'1 Guiltily I admit to liking Hands of Orlac because it did make me shudder a little when Dr Gogol grafted the hands of a guillotined murderer on to the smashed stumps of Orlac. the great pianist whose hands had been destroyed in a railway accident, and because Herr Karl Freund's romantic direction did 'put across' the agreeable little tale of how the dead murderer's fingers retained a life of their own. the gift of knife-throwing, an\n\nA\n\nIt would have been a thousand pities, too. if Mr Shortt's had prevented us enjoying the performance of Mr Peter Lorre as Dr Gogol.

The Lancashire farces he constructs for Miss Gracie Fields have a pleasant local flavour, their plots are genuinely provincial. In Look Up and Laugh, Miss Fields, an actress on holiday, leads the stallholders of an old market in a lively battle against the local council and the owner of a big store who threatens to close the market down. One doesn't demand a high standard of realism in a farce, but Look Up and Laugh is distinguished from The Memory Expert, a slow worthy comedy in the same programme with Mr W. C. Fields, by the sense that a man's observation and experience, as well as his invention, has gone to its making. The Spectator, 9 August 1935 The Trunk Mystery (One New York Night) (USA, M-G-M, 1935).

Solidly constructed and excellently photographed, it reminded, me of the ponderous, talented novels of Sigrid Undset. It cannot meet such a film as Star of Midnight on equal terms because it represents a quite different conception of art, sailing majestically like an Armada galleon through the fleet of bright, agile, intelligent films, sniped at and harassed and unable to reply. The story is of Friesland peasant-farmers, some time during the last century, and the continual threat of the sea. You watch them at their feasts, their weddings and their funerals; they have the grossness and dignity of their animals; they are more genuine and less self-conscious than the characters of Man of Aran, which exploited the same kind of primitive life at the edge of land. Hauke, a farm-hand, who had gained the richest farm by marriage, was elected to the honour and responsibility of keeping the dikes in order. The farmers had become slack, and Hauke was determined to show that he deserved his position. When he planned a new dike to reclaim the foreshore, they opposed him with their inertia and their superstition. The moral is not clear, for to build the new dike Hauke neglected the old; in the autumn storms the waves swept in and he saved the village only by cutting his own seawall and drowning himself and his farm. There was something about floods which appealed to the Victorian temperament (only Herr Freud could explain why), not the gigantic floods of China or the Mississippi, but little domestic floods which gave opportunities for sacrifice and the ringing of church bells and drenched golden hair. There is something of this atmosphere about Der Schimmelreiter; it takes one back to The Mill on the Floss, to High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire, and The Sands of Dee; the wind that blows so sombrely, banking the clouds over these drab Friesian fields, has shaken the windows of many Victorian parsonages. The moral, as I say, is confused, as confused as the religious beliefs of Charles Kingsley, but that only adds to the period flavour: you get a vague impression behind the poverty, the rigour of life and the greedy feasting, of nobility and profundity. But of a film one expects something more agile a speed which cannot be attained on the stage or in a novel. Star of Midnight, a light, quick, sophisticated comedy, in which Miss Ginger Rogers takes Miss Myrna Loy's place as Mr William Powell's partner, has no content which one would trouble to read in a novel or to praise in a play. It is all suavity and amusement, pistol-shots and cocktails; but I am uncertain whether the Victorian profundity of the German film has any more to offer, that there is really more behind the whiskers than behind the polish. And this genre of humorous detective films. Star of Midnight, The Trunk Mystery. The Thin Man, has no superiors in streamlined craftsmanship.

The Great God Gold Boys Will Be Boys The .Murder .Man This week's Grim Subject is Fun: that boisterous national form of humour which can be traced up from the bear-pit by way of the Shakespearian clowns. Fielding. Hood. Dickens, until its sentimental culmination in popular rough-diamond prose, a clatter of beer-mugs on a bar. a refined belch or two (fun has grown progressively more refined since Fielding's day), the sense of good companionship. This is the class to which Where's George? naturally belongs: the story of a henpecked husband in a Yorkshire town whose only friend was a dumb animal until all the good fellows who formed the local Rugger team persuaded him to break from home, play in the great match and win for the team. But a curious thing has happened into this badly acted and carelessly directed film a real actor has been introduced. Mr Sydney Howard, and. comic actor though he is, he bursts like a realist through its unrealities. He can do very little with the stale gags they have given him even the Rugger game, which might have been thought foolproof, was made as tame as table tennis: what emerges is a character of devastating pathos: Mr Howard, faintly episcopal, in endless difficulties with his feet and hands, :\n\n;\n\nminding the\n\nkettle in the little\n\nWhere's George?: Sydney\n\ncramped\n\nkitchen.\n\nWe\n\nare\n\nwhipped back, past the\n\nHoward 15\n\nAugust 1935 beer-drinkers and the punsters and the picaresque, to the bear-ring itself which began it all, to see the awkward beast driven in circles. But it isn't easy any longer to laugh at the bears and cheer the dogs on. In the same programme is an excellent American melodrama of the depression, The Great God Gold, a story of the shady business racketeers who make money out of receiverships as the big firms fail. There are no stars, but a team of very able actors reproduce with delightful vividness the bonhomie, the plate-glass manner, the annihilating lack of trust. Even the hats have been carefully chosen: the crookeder the deal, the more flowing the brim. Boys Will Be Boys, an adaptation of Beachcomber's chronicles of Narkover. is very amusing. Mr Shortt has found this realistic study of our public schools too subversive for a Universal Certificate. Mr Will Hay as Dr Alec Smart, appointed Headmaster on the strength of a forged testimonial, is competent, but the finest performance is that of Mr Claude Dampier as the half-witted Second Master whose uncle, the Chairman of the Governors, stops at nothing, not even at a false accusation of theft, to make room for his nephew's advancement. Realistic may perhaps seem not quite the right word to describe a film which ends magnificently in a struggle between the Rugger teams of past and present Narkovians for the possession of a ball containing Lady Dorking's diamond necklace. But Beachcomber in his fantasy of a school of crooks run by crooks has only removed the peculiar morality of the public schools just a little further from the standards accepted outside. It bears the same relation to truth as Candide. A free fantastic mind has been given just so many facts to play with; nothing is added or subtracted: but the bricks have been rearranged. The school cloisters particularly appealed to me with their tablets to old Narkovians who had passed successfully into gaol. The criminal features of the boys were excellently chosen, and the only jarring element in the quite Gallic consistency of the film was the slight element of good nature in the boys' gang warfare. The Murder Man shows the life of the finished Narkovian. A business crook is murdered and the guilt of the crime is fastened on his equally dishonest partner. The man is innocent and the interest of the film lies in the character of the crime reporter whose evidence is sending him to the chair. There is no more reliable actor on the screen today than Mr Spencer Tracy. His acting of these hard-drinking, saddened, humorous parts is as certain as a mathematical formula, but this film gives him the chance, in a grimly moral scene with the innocent man he has hunted down, of showing the reserve of power behind the ease.

As the great drawbridge falls from the besieger's tower on to the walls of Acre, you cannot help counting the little cluster of spent arrows quivering under the falling block; when Richard of England takes the Cross from the hairy hermit, the camera, moving its eye down the castle walls, stays on a couple of pigeons nesting in a coign of masonry. But one chiefly enjoys in Mr de Mille's films their great set-pieces; he handles, as no other director can, an army of extras. It is not a mere matter of spending money. The cavalry charge outside Jerusalem, the storming of Acre: these are scenes of real executive genius. No clanking of tin swords here, but a quite horrifying sense of reality, as the huge vats tip the burning oil down on to the agonized faces of the men on the storming-\n\nThe Crusades: Loretta Young, Henry Wilcoxon\n\n17\n\nAugust 1935 ladders, or when the riders meet at full gallop in the plain with a shock which jars in the stalls. But these moments occupy perhaps twenty minutes of a very long film. For the rest of the time we must be content with a little quiet fun at the expense of Clio, not always clean fun, although Mr Shortt has given this film the Universal Certificate\n\nyou\n\nhe denied to Boys Will Be Boys. Richard Cceur-de-Lion, in Mr de Mille's pious and Protestant eyes, closely resembled those honest simple young rowing-men who feel that there's something wrong about sex. Richard took the Cross rather than marry Alice of France, and when the King of Navarre forced him at Marseille to marry his daughter (the alternative was to let his army starve), he merely sent his sword to the wedding ceremony, which was oddly enough carried out in English by an Anglican - or possibly American Episcopalian - clergyman in the words of the Book of Common Prayer. There is, indeed, in spite of the subject, nothing Romish about this film, which has the air of having been written by the Oxford Group. Only when his wife had been captured by Saladin did Richard allow himself to pray, but he found prayer as effective as did the author of For Sinners Only, and his wife, whom he had learnt to love, was restored to him. Richard shyly confessed, .', and Berengaria encouraged him with bright tenderness, last night 'Last night 'You prayed?' But Richard wouldn't go quite as far as that. T begged,' he said. 'I .', as the great Buchman heart melted at last and Berengaria slid to drybegged dock in his arms. Neither of the two principal players, Miss Loretta Young and Mr Henry Wilcoxon, really gets a chance in this film. The programme says all there is to be said about them. Mr Wilcoxon is 'six feet two inches tall, weighs 190 pounds. He was nicknamed \"Biff\" as a child.' Miss Young 'is five feet three and weighs 105 pounds'. The information is not as irrelevant as it sounds, for the acting can roughly be judged in terms of weight. Mr Wilcoxon leads over the hairy hermit, played by Mr C. Aubrey Smith, by six pounds, and Miss Katherine de Mille, who has an agreeably medieval face, as Alice of France beats Miss Young by ten pounds. (To quote the programme again. 'She avoids starches, sugars and fats; eats all greens and only enough meat to get the necessary proteins.') As for the other Groupers, there was a delicious moment when I thought the Earl of Leicester said 'Aye, Colonel', to Richard when he was told to attack, but I think the din before Acre may have confused my ears. The Earl was made up distractingly to resemble Mr George Moore. He had one of the few English names in a finely orchestrated cast which included Sven-Hugo Borg, Fred Malatesta, Vallejo Gantner, Paul Sotoff, Hans von Twardowski, and the name I liked best, Pedro de Cordoba. One had to judge these actors by their names as their weights were not given. The Spectator, 30 August 1935 .\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe Crysades (USA, Paramount, 1935).

In the childlike eyes of the great film executives Dood Wasser, I suppose, would be classed with the serious messages (though what this one is it might be hard to say), while 18\n\nSeptember 1935\n\nMe and Marlborough, one of the silliest films yet produced in this country, would be regarded as 'purely entertainment' (though in what the entertainment consists it would be harder still to discover). It may be thought very unlikely that many film magnates would be able to think of 'a serious message*, but. if it may prevent more films of the Me and Marlborough type being produced, let us vote against entertainment and bear with fortitude the triangles, the divorce cases, the Great Marriage Problems of our celluloid Bjornstjerne Bjornsons. If by some happy accident they produce one film as exciting and genuinely entertaining as Dood Wasser. we shall be amply justified. Dood Wasser is a story of the reclamation of the Zuyderzee and the opposition of the Vollendam fishermen, who see their catches getting yearly smaller. Its opening, a documentary prologue which presents the reclamation without the human factor, is an exciting piece of pure cinema. The geometrical instruments, the blueprints, maps and diagrams, the dance of numerals, the sad triumphant voice singing behind the figures, behind the diagrams of cranes and dredges: this is something neither the stage nor prose can present. It reminded me. in its dramatization of statistics, of Mr Eliot's 'Triumphal March' with its catalogue of armaments: 28.000 trench mortars. 53.000 field and heavy guns. I\n\ncannot\n\ntell\n\nhow many\n\nprojectiles,\n\nmines and\n\nfuses.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nvery seldom that the cinema has made this lyrical use of a human voice divorced singer's image. Certainly it has never been used more effectively even by M. Clair or in the lovely opening to F.P. 7. where the aeroplanes dived and turned against a background of chorus and cloud. The story which followed, exhibiting the human stupidities and the tragic fidelities behind the bare Blue Book report, is produced rather slowly, but it has some of the magnificent drive one felt behind the classic Russian films, behind Earth and The General Line: no tiresome \"message*, but a belief in the importance of a human activity truthfully reported. The old fisherman with the horny tortoise face, who was ready to blow up the new dike rather than become a farmer, is given the importance of a general creed; he represents all the fatal courage, honesty and loyalty that may exist in a stupid brain. The photography is uneven: at moments it is painfully 'arty', deliberately out of focus, but it will be a long while before I forget the boisterous fair, the balloons and masks and buffoonery, the low roofs of the merry-go-rounds under the low cloudy sky when the deep animal stupidity of the Vollendam fishermen reached its climax. The title of this Dutch film, of course, is not encouraging, and it may seem a little kill-joy to find more pure entertainment in its slow serious march than in the bright coy antics of Miss Cicely Courtneidge as a woman who disguises herself in men's clothes in order to follow her husband to the wars. She is not an actress who can suggest pathos or romantic love, and though Mr Victor Saville's direction has a smooth well-groomed air. while Mr Tom Walls plays Marlborough with dignity. I found myself too embarrassed by Miss Courtneidge's facial contortions to appreciate their share. Miss Courtneidge is used to throwing her effects to the back row of a theatre gallery, and the camera is not kind to her exaggerations.

This week we have a singer's love-story, an actress's love-story, a musician's love-story. The great film executives have decided that Art is trumps (alas! that the final 'e' which so neatly distinguishes the artiste from the artist cannot be tacked on to that word Art). We have in one film extracts from La Boheme. in another speeches from Shakespeare, in the third a few minutes of Tristan. Personally. I preferred to any of these snippets the sight of Miss Anna Neagle in breeches and a three-cornered hat.\n\nThere is something rather pompous about the appearance of Miss Grace Moore on the screen: the profound silence of an audience that has never found it necessary to cease its chatter before fine direction or fine acting; the immense queues of elderly ladies in peasant blouses and little jackets who have slipped away from their art pottery to see something they really can enjoy; the stuffy reverence like that of a pit before a Bernard Shaw play. Miss Moore, of course, has a lovely voice and a figure unlike the usual prima donna's, but her acting is quite undistinguished. The success of her films as films and not as potted operatic extracts has so far been the success of her leading men. Mr Tullio Carminati gave that dull and worthy film One Night of Love the little sparkle it possessed, and now Mr Leo Carillo takes all the honours in On Wings of Song as the cheap, vulgar, pathetic little Italian racketeer who ruins himself for love of music and love of the singer and nearly throws his life away before a gunman's automatic rather than miss her appearance at the Metropolitan. I seem to remember Mr Carillo before in small gangster parts; here he gives one of the finest performances of the year: to my mind one of the three finest performances, to be remembered with Mr Charles Laughton as Ruggles of Red Gap and with Mr Richard Barthelmess in Four Hours to Kill. Neither Sir Cedric Hardwicke's smooth, well-bred playing of Garrick. nor Miss Anna Neagle's lively Peg Woffington is of that high standard, though I never tired of Miss Neagle's physical appearance, which was as pretty as a Chelsea figure. The whole film indeed is very pretty, with the sentiment neatly handled. But prettiness is a quality one wants, if at all. in small quantities. One wonders why the names Peg Woffington and Garrick have been attached to these characters: there is. of course, no historical truth to be found anywhere in the deft, neat tale. Reg Woffington lived before the days when \"the mummer' (to quote George Moore) 'grew ashamed of his hose and longed for a silk hat. a villa, and above all a visit from the parson'. She shares with Mrs Barn- the distinction of having been one of our most sexually promiscuous actresses she didn't die gracefully as the curtain fell on As You Like It she didn't dream of domestic love with Garrick somewhere in Surrey. She had more life, more pleasing commonness one suspects, than this too sweet, too roguish figurine. But I am ungrateful: I have seen few things more attractive than Miss Neagle in breeches. And so to the loves of the great orchestral conductor (Mr Charles Boyer) and the budding, the dewy composer (Miss Katharine Hepburn). These are both actors of very great talent. Mr Boyer condemned by some grim Dante of a film executive to suffer and be redeemed by love and suffer again in endless circles. Miss Hepburn to be so young, unsophisticated, idealistic, so very, very Barrie. Mr Boyer in Break of Hearts is an artistic philanderer, a character one doesn't associate with great ;\n\n20\n\n:\n\nSeptember 1935\n\nOn Wings of Song: Leo\n\nCarillo.\n\nGrace Moore\n\n^^\n\nPeg of Old Drurx: Anna Neagle\n\n5&& %\n\nM 1\n\n-\n\n\\\n\n.\n\n•*\n\nV 1\n\n^mfe\n\n•\n\n•\n\nv\n\n5k 4\n\nV\n\n^Ji\n\nal¥\n\nt\n\n^^ V\n\n:\n\n* '•--\n\nif-\n\nV\n\n21\n\nSeptember 1935\n\nwho falls in love and marries and is faithless, and loves her and takes to drink and is saved by her love.

Like the late Lon Chaney, he reached stardom with the sole assistance of the make-up man. Any face would have done as well on a big body, and any actor could have produced the short barks and guttural rumbles, the stiff, stuffed sawdust gestures, which was all his parts required of him. A Karloff scenario must have made curious reading. Were those grunts phonetically expressed? One pictures the Karloff arriving in his luxurious car for a hard day's grunting at the studio, the hasty study of the part in the dressingroom while one eye is blacked out and all his teeth disappear, the dreadful moment when the distinguished actor forgets his part, whether this time he has to bark or rumble, at last the stately gollywog entrance under the lights. But in The Raven Mr Karloff was allowed a few minutes of ordinary speech before his face was mutilated and his tongue paralysed and we discovered that he had an expressive voice and a sense of pathos. In The Black Room he is given a long speaking part .\n\n.\n\n.\n\nat last. I liked this wildly artificial film, in which Karloff acts both a wicked central European count and his virtuous, cultured twin of the Byronic period. A curse rests on the family to the effect that the younger twin will kill the elder in 'the black room' of the castle. The room is bricked up by their father, but there is a secret\n\nknown to the elder brother, the wicked Count, who lives in the traditional atmosphere of boarhounds and wenches (when he finishes with a girl he flings her body down a kind of oubliette in the black room). At last, to escape the wrath of the peasants and the curse as well, he murders his younger brother, who is distinguished from him physically by a paralysed arm, and takes his place. The story follows a natural Gothic course, the deception is discovered at the altar when he is about to marry the young, pale, 'proper' heroine, he is pursued to the castle by the enraged peasants, takes refuge in the black room and is knocked into the pit by his brother's dog, falling on the dagger which sticks up through the rotting corpse. Karloff is not quite at ease with virtue, suavity and good looks, but he gives a very spirited performance as the wicked Count and carries the whole film, so far as acting is concerned, on his own shoulders. The direction is good: it has caught, as Mr James Whale never did with Frankenstein, the genuine Gothic note. Mrs Radcliffe would not have been ashamed of this absurd and exciting film, of the bones in the oubliette, the scene at the altar when the dog leaps and the paralysed arm comes to life in self-defence, of the Count's wild drive back to the castle, the lashing whip, the rearing horses, the entrance\n\n22\n\nSeptember 1935\n\nThe Black\n\nRoom\n\n:\n\nBoris Karloff\n\nrocketing coach, the strange valley of rocks with its leaning cross and neglected Christ, the graveyard with its owls and ivy. There is much more historical sense in this film than in any of what Miss Lejeune calls, with curious lack of humour, the 'scholarly' works of Mr Korda. A whole literary period comes to life: Wyatt might be raising the huge tower of Fonthill, Monk Lewis writing of the false, fair Imogine and her ghostly betrothed (another part for Karloff):\n\nHis vizor was closed, and gigantic his height His armour was sable to view; All pleasure and laughter were hush'd at his sight; The dogs, as they eyed him, drew back in affright The lights in the chamber burnt blue!\n\nThe Spectator, 20 September 1935 The Black Room (USA.

It is a happiness than Clair's, rougher, less sophisticated: behind Clair's films is always a sharp, smooth, satirical Gallic air, the faintest odour of the most expensive hair-oil; you never get further away from Paris than the dry herbage outside the gramophone factory where the ex-convict listened to the song from the horn of a convolvulus. But Alexandrov's story of a shepherd who was mistaken by a rich snobbish woman for a famous conductor and who later, after a series of wild accidents and coincidences, became the head of a jazz orchestra in Moscow, has a simple irrelevance quite unlike Clair's tight expert tales. The opening sequence, when the shepherd leads out his flocks and herds, of sheep and goats and cows and pigs, to graze by the seashore, is the most lovely a moving camera has yet achieved, as it follows him with the quickness of his long stride over hills and rocks, streams and verandas, while he sings, knocking the tune out on the slats of a bridge or the bars of a paling. And if something of the kind has been done before, in Congress Dances and Walt Disney's cartoons, to convey a sense of lyrical happiness, this at any rate is completely original: Alexandrov's use of a moving camera to convey the grotesque in his long panorama of a crowded bathing beach. The wealthy woman in pyjamas swaying her munificent hips along the shore in pursuit of the famous conductor is followed by the camera behind a close-up frieze of enlarged feet stuck out towards the lens, of fat thighs, enormous backs, a caricature of ugly humanity exposing pieces of itself like butcher's joints in the sun. I have no wish to criticize this film, but simply to rejoice in its wildness. its grotesqueness, its light, taking tunes, a sense of good living that owes nothing to champagne or women's clothes. If Alexandrov sometimes seems to dwell too long on an incident, at least no one has shown a richer comic invention, for, like Clair and Chaplin, this director has worked to his own scenario; it is to Alexandrov we owe the conception as well as the execution of the magnificent sequences when the shepherd pipes to the rich woman's guests and the notes bring all his animals trampling out of their enclosure, up the steps of the hotel, in at the windows, to eat and drink the feast laid out in honour of the conductor.

This is genuine cinema: few English titles are needed: there is action all the time, a minimum of speech. Two for Tonight depends on dialogue. It is a very amusing and well-written entertainment; Mr Bing Crosby is attractively commonplace among the stars; Miss Mary Boland and Mr Lynne Overman are two of the most reliable players. ... So this picture forces one to write, in terms of actors and authorship. The camera has played a very small part in the entertainment. Even a spirited battle in a restaurant with soda-water siphons could have been transferred at a cost to the stage; and the studies of a theatrical magnate, of an Austrian producer turned manservant, of a madman with a passion for noughts and crosses would have been even more amusing behind footlights. Sometimes one is inclined to believe that characters can all be left to the stage; the cinema generalizes.

It is the ballyhoo, of course, which has done it the advance gossip and the advertisements, the crowds outside the cinema on the opening night, the\n\nDog.\n\n:\n\ncarefully drilled curiosity as to\n\nwhat\n\nMr Sam Goldwyn had\n\ndone\n\nto\n\nMiss Oberon's\n\neyebrows. Song of Ceylon, on the other hand, made by the GPO Film Unit and directed by Mr Basil Wright, is introduced as a second feature into the Curzon programme with little notice from the ecstatic connoisseurs of classic tragedy, although it is an example to all directors of perfect construction and the perfect application of montage. Perfection is not a word one cares to use, but from the opening sequence of the Ceylon forest, the great revolving fans of palm which fill the screen, this film moves with the air of absolute certainty in its object and assurance in its method. It is divided into four parts. In the first, The Buddha, we watch a long file of pilgrims climb the mountain-side to the huge stone effigies of the god. Here, as a priest strikes a bell, Mr Wright uses one of the loveliest visual metaphors I have ever seen on any screen. The sounding of the bell startles a small bird from its branch, and the camera follows the bird's flight and the notes of the bell across the island, down from the mountain-side, over forest and plain and sea. the vibration of the tiny wings, the fading sound. The second part, The Virgin Island, is transitional, leading us away from the religious theme by way of the ordinary' routine of living to industry. In The Voices of Commerce the commentary, which has been ingeniously drawn from a seventeenth-century traveller's account of the island, gives place to scraps of business talk. As the natives follow the old ways of farming, climbing the palm trees with a fibre loop, guiding their elephants' foreheads against the trees they have to fell, voices dictate bills of lading, close deals over the telephone, announce through loud-speakers the latest market prices. The last reel. The Apparel of a God, returns by way of the gaudy gilded dancers in their devil masks to the huge images on the mountain, to a solitary peasant laying his offering at Buddha's feet, and closes again with the huge revolving leaves, so that all we have seen of devotion and dance and the bird's flight and the gentle communal life of harvest seems something sealed away from us between the fans of foliage. We are left outside with the bills of lading and the loud-speakers. The Spectator, 4 October 1935 .\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSong of Ceylon (GB. Ceylon Tea Propaganda Board.\n\n1935). Director: Basil Wright.\n\nAnna Karenina The Informer\n\nA\n\nnew\n\nto\n\ndo with the\n\nGreta Garbo: the event is exciting, of course, but it has very little cinema. The film does not need great actresses so much as great directors, and it is no reflection on Hollywood to say that no one there film with\n\nart of the\n\n25\n\nOctober 1935\n\nknows what\n\nto do with Garbo, with her awkward ungainly body, her hollow face strong and rough as an Epstein cast. Mata Hari, Grand Hotel, The Painted Veil: these are typical of the slick commercial products to which she has been expected to adapt her powerful personality. The result has generally been unfortunate. Power misapplied is apt to be a little absurd. Garbo's great talent might appear less confined on the stage. In Anna Karenina she has been better served than in most of her films. Guilt and misery and passion, these suit the melancholy grandeur of her voice. Very nearly all her acting is in her voice: watch her among a crowd of other actresses in the mazurka, she is stiff, awkward, bony, rather grotesque among the' graceful bodies, the lovely shoulders: but listen to her as she bends over her croquet-ball playing a game with her lover before all the gossips in St Petersburg and you are in the presence of deep authentic pain. The word 'doom' is frequently in the mouths of these characters, but there is no other actress on the screen who would not have made the idea of doom false and preposterous, who would have convinced us. as she does from her first appearance on the Moscow platform, her face emerging from the engine's steam, to the last scene when we watch her brain stagger with the thudding wheels, that she has been driven to her fate. What can the cinema do with an actress of her quality and kind? The film, if it is to be true to itself, must depend first on picture and movement and only secondarily on dialogue: it is a director's art, neither an author's nor an actor's. The stage technique forced on the other players in Anna Karenina by the personality of Greta Garbo. the slowing of the film to allow time for the incredibly lovely voice, the harsh suffering face, to make their points, calls for a standard of acting they cannot meet, with the exception of Mr Basil Rathbone, who as Anna's husband draws an intense bitter portrait of a man living for appearances alone. Mr Fredric March, so satisfactory in ninety-nine films out of a hundred because he is arranged in the right patterns by his directors, left to his own resources is unconvincing. It is Greta Garbo's personality which 'makes' this film, which fills the mould of the neat respectful adaptation with some sense of the greatness in the novel. No other film actress can so convey physical passion that you believe in its dignity and importance, and yet there is no actress who depends so little on her own sexual charm. Sitting in the corner of a freezing railway carriage, with the ugly shadows of the single globe deepening the crevices of her face, she is more like a man than a woman. What beauty she has is harsh and austere as an Arab's: and I was reminded of Mr Yeats's lines on Dante's mask:\n\nAn\n\nimage that might have been a stony\n\nStaring\n\nupon\n\nFrom doored\n\nAmong\n\nface.\n\na bedouin's horse-hair roof and windowed cliff, or half upturned\n\nthe coarse grass\n\nand the camel dung.\n\nMr Liam O'Flaherty's novel of the Irish\n\nRebellion has been filmed a second time. superb material for the screen; very few words are needed for this drama; terror is not a subtle sensation; it can be conveyed very much easier by images alone than scruples, guilt, tenderness. You only need the Black and Tan patrols through the Liffey fogs, the watching secretive figures outside the saloons as the drunken informer drifts deeper and deeper with his cronies into the seedy night life of Dublin. Mr Victor McLaglen has never given an abler performance, and the film, even if it sometimes underlines its points rather crudely, is a memorable picture of a pitiless war waged without honour on either side in doorways and The Spectator, 11 October 1935 cellars and gin-shops.

Criticism, of course, may not be quite in our line, but the production of A Midsummer Night's Dream has demonstrated beyond doubt that no one can shake a better tambourine or turn a better table. are superb mediums, or is it an intuitive sympathy with the poet which enables a Mr Luscombe Whyte (to be remembered for his appreciation of Sam Goldwyn's 'classic tragedy*. The Dark Angel, and to be distinguished from Mr Pedro de Cordoba who was a Crusader) to tell us that Shakespeare 'had he lived now' would have approved of Herr Reinhardt's film version of his play? 'He had a mind which must have chafed at the limitations of candle-lit, small stages and curtains. He would have conjured up mad woods with twisted trees, peopled with fantasies clothed in visibility.' pregnant sentence, that, straight from the ouija-board. Unfortunately, the mediums differ. Mr Sidney Carroll tells us with an even greater air of authority that Shakespeare would not have liked the film. It is his obligation, he says, 'as a man of English descent on both sides for generations to try to protect our national poet dramatist from either idolatry or desecration\". As I have said, apart from criticism, there is little we film-critics cannot do.\n\nI\n\nWe\n\nA\n\nAlas!\n\nMr\n\nI\n\nfailed to get in\n\ntouch with Shakespeare (my English descent\n\nis\n\nless\n\npure\n\nquite sure that Anne Hathaway, 'had she lived now', would have thought this a very nice film (I am uncertain of the Dark Lady of the Sonnets). She would have liked the chorus of budding Shirley Temples drifting gauzily up the solid Teutonic moonbeams, and I am sure she would have liked the Bear. For Herr Reinhardt is nothing if not literal, and when Helena declares, 'No, no, I am as ugly as a bear; For beasts that meet me run away for fear', we see a big black bear beating a hasty retreat into the blackberry bushes. All the same, I enjoyed this film, perhaps because I have little affection for the play, which seems to me to have been written with a grim determination on Shakespeare's part to\n\nthan\n\nCarroll's), but\n\nI\n\nfeel\n\nearn for once a Universal Certificate. But Herr Reinhardt, lavish and fanciful rather than imaginative, is uncertain of his new medium. Although in his treatment of the Athenian woodland, the silver birches, thick moss, deep mists and pools, there are sequences of great beauty, there are others of almost incredible banality. After an impressive scene when Oberon's winged slaves herd Titania's fairies under his black billowing cloak, we watch a last fairy carried off over a slave's shoulder into the night sky. It is very effective as the slave sinks knee deep into the dark, but when the camera with real Teutonic thoroughness follows his gradual disappearance until only a pair of white hands are left twining in the middle of the Milky Way. the audience showed its good sense by laughing. Much of the production is poised like this on the edge of absurdity because Herr Reinhardt cannot visualize how his ideas will work out on the screen. We are never allowed to forget the stage producer, a stage producer, though, of unlimited resources with an almost limitless stage. At every passage of dialogue we are back\n\n28\n\nOctober 1935 before footlights and the camera is focused relentlessly on the character who speaks. The freer, more cinematic fairy sequences are set to Mendelssohn's music, and this is the way Shakespeare's poetry ought surely to be used if it is not to delay the action. It must be treated as music, not as stage dialogue tied to the image of the speaker like words issuing from the mouth of characters in a cartoon. The acting is fresh and vivid for the very reason that it lacks what Mr Carroll calls 'proper Shakespearian diction and bearing'. I do not want to be ungrateful, the film is never dull, and the last sequences, when the human characters stream up the stairs to bed, and the fairies flood in and fill the palace in their wake, was a lovely and effective visualization of \"the sweet peace', 'the glimmering light', 'the The Spectator, 18 October 1935 dead and drowsy fire'.

Victor Jory, Anita Louise, Dick Powell, Olivia de Havilland.\n\nA Midsummer\n\nJoan of Arc Turn of the Tide Top Hat She\n\nThe German\n\nfilm, Joan of Arc, is of greater interest to students of Nazi psychology than to film-goers. One would have thought it almost impossible to produce so dull a film on so dramatic a subject (a subject which defeated even Mr Shaw's talent for triviality). It is very noisy, rather like the Zoo at feeding-time, which gives an odd impression in bright, dapper Curzon Street, and it is quite as inaccurate as any Hollywood spectacle of The Crusades order but not so funny. The author, Herr Gerhard Menzel, we are told, has 'made intensive studies in France, with the result that new light has been shed on some of the most famous figures of history'. But I hardly think that any research can have helped him to reject Joan's meeting with Charles VII at Chillon in favour of Joan appearing to Charles VII, in beleaguered Orleans of all places, and saving him from an infuriated rabble. Other inventions are less ingenuous. But the pure Nordic mind, whether in its politics or its poetry, is doomed to be a little absurd, and Herr Menzel's new light on a Charles who lets Joan die 'for the sake of France', a Charles intended to be a noble, lonely, rather Machiavellian Fiihrer is as ridiculous in effect as Schiller's conception (he was too sensitive to let her burn) of a Joan who died on the battlefield. Perhaps one should not condemn Fraulein Angela Salloker for her quite nerveless playing, for it is one of the purposes of this Nazi film to belittle a rival national saviour. The real hero is Charles with his Nazi mentality, his belief in the nobility of treachery for the sake of the nation. The purge of 30 June and the liquidation of Tremouille, the burning Reichstag and the pyre in Rouen market-place - these political parallels are heavily underlined. The direction is terribly sincere, conveying a kind of blond and shaven admiration for poor lonely dictators who have been\n\nforced to eliminate their allies. Turn of the Tide, an unpretentious and truthful film of a Yorkshire fishing village, of rivalry over the crabpots, is one of the best English films I have yet seen, apart from the 'documentaries' in which this country has long led the world. It has been compared to Man of Aran, but it is on a quite different plane from Mr Flaherty's bogus and sentimental picture. Mr Flaherty's direction is hopelessly 'literary', he lays 'beauty' on inches thick, he contributes just about as little to the film as the author of The Fountain to the novel. But Mr Norman Walker is concerned with truth; he doesn't trouble about silhouettes on skylines, and the beauty his picture\n\n29\n\nOctober 1935\n\nTurn of the Tide: Joan Maude, Niall MacGinnis, John Garrick,\n\nSam\n\nLivesey\n\nis that of exact statement. The ordinary life of a fishing village, the competition between lifeboat and salvage tug, the changing market prices, satisfy him: he doesn't have to invent drama as Mr Flaherty does, who painfully reconstructed a type of fishing which the Aran islanders had not practised in living memory.\n\ncatches\n\nTop Hat is a vehicle, a little better than Roberta, for Mr Fred Astaire's genius. It doesn't really matter much that the music and lyrics are bad. Mr Astaire is the nearest approach we are ever likely to have to a human Mickey Mouse; he might have been drawn by Mr Walt Disney, with his quick physical wit, his incredible agility. He belongs to a fantasy world almost as free as Mickey's from the law of gravity, but unfortunately he has to act with human beings and not even Miss Ginger Rogers can match his freedom, lightness and happiness. The Wag of the Week is Mr Shortt, of our Board of Film Censors, who has 30\n\nOctober 1935\n\nTop Hat Fred Astaire :\n\n31\n\nOctober 1935 granted to this quite pleasantly bawdy film the Universal Certificate he has refused to the earnest manly Boy Scout virtues of Rider Haggard's She. I cannot write reasonably about this film, for few books at one time excited me more than King Solomon's Mines and Allan Quartermain. She always bore its symbolism a little heavily: at that age one was not so interested in the lovely immortal woman and the flame of life as in the great ice-barrier, the avalanche, the cannibals in the caves, but to an unrepentant Haggard fan it does sometimes seem to catch the thrill as well as the childishness of his invention.

She stays to become the mistress of his killer, the Big Shot, and falls in love with a young prospector who reads Shelley and wants to write poetry. The Barbary Coast\n\nis\n\nacted and well written.\n\nBig Shot, himself pursued by Vigilantes, follows his mistress with the intention of killing her lover, but, taking pity on them both, goes to meet his lynchers. The story, it will be seen, belongs to the 'far, far better' school, but the character of the Big Shot has a sourness, of the girl an unscrupulousness, which is fresh and interesting. The conventionality of the plot has provided a challenge to the director and the authors to make something real out of the hocus-pocus. They have succeeded triumphantly. There are moments as dramatically exciting as anything I have seen on the fictional screen. Sous les Toits de Paris contained a sequence in which Prejean was surrounded by a gang with drawn razors in the darkness of a railway viaduct; the smoke blew continually across, and the dialogue was drowned in the din of shunting trucks. The steamy obscurity, the whispers, the uproar overhead combined to make the scene vividly sinister. There is a moment in Barbary Coast that takes its place with Clair's, when the Big Shot's gunman, on his way to commit another murder in the San Francisco of which he has long been one of the undisputed rulers, feels the pistols of the Vigilantes against his ribs. They walk him out to the edge of the acetylene-lighted town along streets ankle-deep in mud. holding a mock trial with counsel and witnesses as they go; the low voices, the slosh of mud round their boots, the rhythmic stride are terrifying because they have been exactly imagined, with the ear as well as the eye. The Austrian film Episode has nothing comparable to offer, nothing even to equal the acting of Mr Edward G. Robinson and Miss Miriam Hopkins and half a dozen less-known players in their small vivid parts in Barbary Coast. I cannot 32\n\nOctober 1935\n\nBarbary Coast\n\nunderstand the enthusiasm for Fraulein Paula Wessely, star of the slow decorative Maskerade. This stocky, rather graceless actress may be said. I suppose, to act naturally, rather in the same way that a Roedean girl may be said to play hockey naturally, but if one wants art to imitate the natural, to be conscious and precise in its effects, one will surely prefer Miss Lynn Fontanne or half a dozen other naturalactresses to Fraulein Wessely, whose air of healthy prudery I always find peculiarly odious. The background to this rather silly comedy about a rich old philanderer, his sons' tutor and an art student who wishes to keep from her widowed mother the fact that they have been ruined is supposed to be the Vienna of 1922, the Vienna of the inflation: but so tragic a breakdown of the framework of life deserves a less perfunctory, a less humorous and sentimental treatment. To my surprise I enjoyed The Passing of the Third Floor Back. The pious note has been toned down, the milk of human kindness in the original play has been agreeably watered, and the types in the small London 'private hotel' are observed with malicious realism. Unfortunately, sweetness and light do break in, and the director cannot convey these qualities with the same truth as the cans of cooling water, the interminable uncarpeted stairs, the jangle of bells and nerves. The excursion steamer, on which the Stranger takes everyone for a trip to Margate, is as\n\nistic\n\n33\n\nNovember 1935 chromium-plated as a millionaire's yacht and carries a chorus of Goldwyn girls in bathing-costumes. This is to be a little too cynical. The right sense of sudden and happy release can surely sometimes be caught among the winkles and blare and sweat of an August holiday.

Director:\n\nBerthold Viertel. Conrad\n\nThe March of Time The March of Time is the title of an American news series, and this first instalment ought to shock the complacency of British news directors. No attempt has ever been made over here really to edit news films; a football-match, minor royalty opening a housing estate, the launching of a ship, a wharfside fire: scraps of unimportant material are flung without arrangement on to the screen. A tremendous organization has been built up to bring the exposed film to the laboratory in the shortest possible time. A British heavy-weight takes the count somewhere in the Middle West, and a fleet of aeroplanes, acting in conjunction with Atlantic liners, bring the film to London at enormous expense in record time. But this is not news by any journalistic standard: the story is at least six days old and as dead as last season's tunes. Of course, if Sir Josiah Stamp were to break a bottle of wine over a new railway engine at Euston, it would be possible to exhibit the completed film in every cinema in London before the locomotive was dry, but that event might well be considered insufficiently important to upset the weekly programmes already showing, and we should have to wait for Sir Josiah Stamp quite as long as we have to wait for the boxer. So in spite of the aeroplanes most of the items in a news programme have ceased to be news by the time they are shown, however hastily\n\nand perfunctorily exhibited. The producers of The March of Time have realized this. They have realized too that some forms of news do not grow cold in twenty-four hours. Their fortnightly programmes can be compared with an authoritative article by a special correspondent rather than with a haphazard page of photographs from the Daily Mirror. Their method is to connect newsreel shots with studio reconstructions, to make a vivid, and often politically partisan, story. The law of libel is not so dreaded in America as in England, or the bitter exciting film, which I saw privately, of the activities of the armaments ring could not have been made. But no less exciting and now publicly shown at three London cinemas is the account of the Croix de Feu, the French Fascist organization. The film opens with the riots of February 1934, and gives some idea of the extent of the bloodshed and the ferocity of the fighting. It was from these riots that the Croix de Feu gathered strength, and in The March of Time we can watch the recruiting, the processions of private cars driving out from Paris at night to secret meetings in the countryside, we can listen to Colonel de la Rocque's torch-lit violence. But there is great danger that news films may not be allowed the same political freedom as the Press; the British Board of Film Censors have been known in the past to impose a political censorship over fictional films, and they have tried their\n\n34\n\nNovember 1935 hands with curious results on The March of Time. The sequences of the Paris riots have been severely cut, and the film has been made Fascist in tone by the removal of the telling final shot which gave the source from which the Croix de\n\nFeu\n\nderives\n\nits\n\nfunds.\n\nshould not be forgotten, therefore, that the Board are merely the employees of the film industry, and that their decisions have no legal sanction except where it has been granted them by local authorities. They could if necessary be dismissed by the industry acting as a whole, or news films could be taken altogether out of their hands. The law of libel will always safeguard individuals better than the Board. Unfortunately, film companies have never shown a talent for co-operation or they would not have imposed on themselves so curious a form of censorship, a censorship working by a set of rules so absurd that it has imposed on The Thirtynine Steps a certificate for adults only and granted to the domestic indecencies of The Crusades a Universal Certificate. This means that in many districts a parent is not allowed to give his own child permission to see Mr Hitchcock's blameless film The Spectator, 8 November 1935 of Lord Tweedsmuir's patriotic •thriller'. It\n\nThe March of Time (USA. 1934 on). Produced by Louis de Rochemont with Time Magazine.\n\nLast Love\n\nMoscow Nights\n\nOil for the\n\nLamps\n\nof China\n\nLast Love has a pleasant unpretentious air of truth about it. which is very rare in about singers or composers. One knows what treatment they generally receive on the screen, how nobly and dolefully the Schuberts and Chopins sacrifice themselves for former room-mates. Even the story of Last Love, of the middleaged 'finished' composer who returns to his home in Vienna after ten years in America, who falls in love with a Japanese student, writes his last opera for her to play in and watches at rehearsal her growing love for the young conductor, might have been made for Herr Tauber. But once accept the romantic plot and the rest is genuine: a creative career from a professional angle. Herr Albert Bassermann as the elderly composer gives one of the best performances I have seen this year. This is not a man romantically 'inspired', but a man with a profession, a man who works; watch the pleasure and cunning in his face as he recognizes a good trick, a technical dexterity. His acting in the wintry scene of the small country inn, where his new tenderness comes to a head and he drinks with the village musicians, conducting over the beer-mugs, and the girl breaks into a spontaneous tipsy song and he feels the fun of life return because he has ideas again after ten years of sterility, is very moving. Miss Michiko Meini, who plays the Japanese student, has a charming voice. To a European the Oriental face doesn't, thank God, register emotions in the way we are used to. and the faint flicker across the broad rice-white surface of love, pain, tenderness helps the film to maintain, even at its less plausible moments, a pleasant muted quality. Moscow Nights, Mr Anthony Asquith's new film, is completely bogus. Momentarily forgetting The Dark Angel, I wondered, as I came out from the assembly of peeresses and minor royalty and the high shriek of friend recognizing friend into the blue glare of searchlights, whether this was the worst, as well as the most ballyhooed, film of the year. Mr Asquith was once a promising director, though he was always more tricky than imaginative. Now his bag of tricks seems empty. This absurd romantic spy-drama of wartime Russia opens with Volga boatmen and\n\nfilms\n\n35\n\n:\n\nNovember 1935 carries on with every worn-out property of a Hollywood Russia, even to the gipsy orchestras. The direction is puerile, no one can drop a tray or a glass without Mr Asquith cutting to a shell-burst. But he has been well served by his players,\n\nby M. Harry Baur as an awkward pathetic war-profiteer, by Miss Athene Seyler as an old genteel spy who haunts the hospitals, and Mr Laurence Olivier as an embittered front-line officer who loves a young society nurse engaged to the profiteer. The acting of Miss Penelope Dudley- Ward, who plays the girl's part, belongs to another class altogether, to country-house charades. It is an error of taste to star this player above such brilliant professionals as Miss Seyler and Mr Hay Petrie. who makes a more vivid impression in the few feet of film allowed him and with his two words of dialogue than Miss Ward in all her reels. The subject of Oil for the Lamps of China is excellent: the ballyhoo of sham idealism with which the young recruits of an American oil company are inoculated before they are dispatched to China, the appeals to their loyalty, the assurances that \"the company always takes care of its men\" and then the truth, the sacrifices they are expected to make without return, the appointments filled by intrigue in New York, the inventions stolen by their superiors, and finally, when they grow old. the studied attempts to rob them of their pensions by forcing them to resign. It is a pity that so interesting a theme should have been passed first through the mind of a good, sincere and sentimental woman and then through the mind of a perhaps less sincere but certainly not less sentimental Hollywood scenario-writer.

These two films have a very respectable ancestry, the Restoration duel of sex.

There she gets drunk with an American private soldier, they haven't the money to pay for the drinks, and by the time the soldier has come to his sober senses, he has deserted. 36\n\nNovember 1935 smashed a Government car, rushed the boundary, stolen a motor caravan and finds himself driving towards California with a girl whose politics he can't stand, who loathes the sight of a uniform and who wants to go west to her pacifist at Washington and not east. Miss Barbara Stanwyck as the malicious-tongued Robert Young as the reckless irritated private soldier give aristocratic Red and\n\nMr\n\nadmirable performances. The tradition of sparring lovers usually survives in the form of facetiousness, a dreadful intellectual slap and tickle, but the dialogue of Arms and the Girl does belong, however great the difference of quality, to the same unsentimental genre as Wildblood's and Jacintha's\n\nTwas a meer Trick of Fate to catch us thus at unawares To draw us in, with a what do you lack, as we pass\"d by Had we once separated tonight, we should have had more Wit, than ever to have met again tomorrow. :\n\n:\n\nBut for painful contrast 'You are the type of girl a man can imagine in his own I mean.' This lover's speech from Accent on Youth belongs to another world, and so do the direction and the acting of this dreary comedy. There is one good scene at the end of the picture, but I wouldn't advise any but doglovers to wait so long. They, of course, will enjoy Mr Herbert Marshall's usual The Spectator, 22 November 1935 canine performance of dumb suffering. :\n\nhome - married\n\nArms and\n\nthe Girl {Red Salute) (USA.

Herbert Marshall.\n\nThe Last Outpost The Last Outpost, which will be shown shortly at the Plaza, is a curious mixture. Half of it is remarkably good and half of it quite abysmally bad. One can even put one's finger on the joins, and it will be well worth a visit if only because it indicates what might be made of the short-story form on the screen. It consists of two stories unrelated except for the coincidence of characters. The first, which lasts for about half an hour, is a very well-directed and well-acted war-story of a British Secret Service agent and his success in warning a defenceless tribe against a Kurd attack and inducing them to move with their flocks over a flooded river and across a snow-bound range of mountains to safe pastures. It is one of those stories of dogged physical endeavour that the film does so well. It belongs to the order of Grass and The Covered Wagon. Mr Claude Rains as the Secret Service agent in Turkish uniform and Mr Cary Grant as the incurably light-minded and rather stupid British officer whom he rescues from the Kurds both act extremely well. Mr Rains's low husky voice, his power of investing even commonplace dialogue with smouldering conviction, is remarkable. He never rants, but one is always aware of what a superb ranter he could be in a part which did not call for modern restraint but only for superb diction. I should like to see him as Almanzor or Aurengzebe, for he could catch, as no one else could, the bitter distrust of the world, religious in its intensity, which lies behind the heroic drama. 37\n\nNovember 1935 if it had stopped on the mountain pass above the pastures with on the way down to hospital and the comforts of Cairo and the secret agent turning back towards the enemy, would have been a memorable short film.\n\nThe Last Outpost,\n\nth"
