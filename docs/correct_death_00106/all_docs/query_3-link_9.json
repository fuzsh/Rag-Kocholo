    "text": "The Butcher Boy was followed by The Rough House, His Wedding Night, Oh! Doctor and Coney Island (all 1917), chock full of choreographed mayhem that’s been described as “slapstick ballet.” In one film a delivery boy and a cook might reduce a household to chaos as they fight over a maid’s affections; in another there might be an all-out war between all the characters with bags of flour whizzing and exploding all over a general store. Keaton would be well matched in these scenes by the uninhibited Al St. John, Arbuckle’s nephew and fellow Sennett veteran, who was also a great pratfaller. In a sense Arbuckle, Keaton and St. John were an informal comedy trio, well before the likes of the Three Stooges and the Marx Brothers.\n\nIt wasn’t long before the New York studios (Comique soon left East 48th Street for the old Biograph studio in the Bronx) were proving to be a bit cramped. For instance, the shooting of His Wedding Night took place during the hottest parts of summer and the cast could only bear to work for 30 minutes at a time. Arbuckle decided a change was needed, and that change would be a move to southern California, which was swiftly becoming the main hub of early filmmaking. Specifically, he would move Comique to the Balboa Amusement Producing Company in Long Beach.\n\nThe Balboa complex at 6th Street and Alamitos Avenue was built in 1913 by Herbert M. Horkheimer and his brother Elwood. It was only a mile from the beach–the fresh air was no doubt a welcome change from crowded New York. It featured a number of buildings painted green with white trim and manicured grounds, giving it a campus-like feel. It also boasted all the latest motion picture equipment and the largest glassed-in stage at the time. Several studios churned out films at Balboa, from Paramount to Mutual, but Roscoe Arbuckle was far and away the biggest star the Horkheimers had–no doubt his arrival caused considerable excitement."
