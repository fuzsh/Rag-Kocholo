        "text": "Though Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Harold Lloyd are today widely considered The Big Three of silent comedy, those are rankings that arose in large part due to the scandal which derailed Roscoe’s career for so many years. When the scandal hit in September 1921, Roscoe was second only to Chaplin, and even ranked above him in some polls.\n\nIn the silent era, Buster wasn’t as popular as he is today. He was talked into moving to MGM in 1928 in part because he wasn’t doing as well as he would’ve liked by the box office. It was only later that people began rediscovering Buster’s silent work and giving him a major reappraisal.\n\nI’m in the camp who supports Roscoe as the fourth great silent clown. Let’s just say Harry Langdon isn’t my style at all.\n\nMany of Roscoe’s films were presumably lost forever in the wake of the scandal, when they were ordered destroyed. Luckily, we do have a fair number which survived in other archives, like all the films he did with Buster and Chaplin. Other films, like The Cook, were miraculously discovered after decades of being given up for lost.\n\nBy 1932, Roscoe’s reputation had recovered, and the public welcomed him back to the silver screen. Sadly, he passed away before he could begin making features again, but at least he’d lived to see his reputation restored, and didn’t have to hide behind the camera and a pseudonym anymore.\n\nOn top of the catastrophe of having so many films destroyed, Roscoe also suffered from the near-total lack of film preservation in Hollywood’s early decades. This wasn’t an era of film studies majors, indie theatres devoted to classics, film festivals, scholarly books about film history, and certificates in film preservation. Many films were destroyed as soon as they were out of theatres, since no one thought anyone would care to watch them again. They were cheap, disposable entertainment for the masses.\n\nBy the time people began realizing how important it was to preserve film history, and getting interested in films from a bygone generation, it was too late for many silents. They were long lost, either deliberately destroyed or victims of nitrate fires, or too far gone for serious restoration. Many others languished in closets and other unlikely locations.\n\nIn the early 21st century, a number of Roscoe’s surviving films were restored and issued on DVD, as well as by film festivals. The Museum of Modern Art twice ran a series with 56 of his films in April and May 2006.\n\nOver the decades, Roscoe has been referenced or portrayed in a number of films, not always truthfully or flatteringly. The PBS children’s show Square One (which I watched in its original run) also had a fictitious deceased celebrity named Roscoe “Fatty” Tissue.\n\nIn 2004, author Jerry Stahl published the (not so truthful!) novel I, Fatty. A number of non-fiction books have also been written.\n\nIt really upsets me when people say Roscoe raped and murdered Virginia Rappé, or call him “Fatty.” He always said, “I’ve got a name, you know,” when someone called him that demeaning nickname. That was his character’s name, not a name he chose for himself, and once he had full creative control, he always put the screen name in quotes, after his real name.\n\nThankfully, most scholarly books on film history give him the dignity of his true name, or put “Fatty” in quotes in the middle.\n\nLet’s also not forget the second victim of the scandal. Virginia Rappé was only 26, an innocent young woman who died far too young. Roscoe had nothing to do with her tragic death, and indeed tried to help her when he found her in such dire straits. Regardless of what kind of morals she did or didn’t have, she didn’t deserve to die. In the 21st century, we should really be far beyond condemning women for not being pure, innocent virgins with G-rated lives.\n\nRoscoe and Virginia were both victims, in different ways. The real villain was Maude Delmont, who started the scandal in the first place with her slanderous accusations. Let’s not make Virginia out to be some shady woman of ill repute just because she was drinking and had had a number of abortions. There’s more than enough proof of Roscoe’s innocence; we don’t need to drag the other victim down to establish that innocence.\n\nRoscoe once said, “A man is nothing without his good name.” Let’s help to make sure that name stays good for eternity.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nOn 5 September 1921, Roscoe went to San Francisco with two friends, checked into three rooms by the St. Francis Hotel, and used one for a little party. One of the guests was 26-year-old bit player Virginia Rappé.\n\nWhen Roscoe saw her vomiting, she said she felt ill and asked to lie down. Roscoe carried her into the bedroom and went for help. When he returned, she was on the floor, tearing at her clothes, and violently convulsing. She was put in a cold bathtub and taken to another room, after which Roscoe called the manager and doctor. The doctor declared she’d had too much to drink, and gave her morphine.\n\nTwo days later, she was hospitalized, and Maude Delmont, whom she’d only met a few days before the party, accused Roscoe of rape. The doctor found no evidence, though Mrs. Delmont continued with her accusations.\n\nOn 9 September, Virginia passed away from secondary peritonitis and a ruptured bladder.\n\nMrs. Delmont went to the cops, and they jumped to the wild conclusion that Virginia’s bladder had ruptured due to the impact of Roscoe’s massive body.\n\nVirginia’s manager, Al Semnacker, accused Roscoe of raping her with ice. Over time, it transmogrified into a bottle of champagne, Coca-Cola, and milk. Witnesses testified Roscoe only rubbed ice on her stomach to try to ease her abdominal pain.\n\nMrs. Delmont made a later statement to police in hopes of getting money from Roscoe’s lawyers.\n\nRoscoe was arrested and arraigned on manslaughter charges on 17 September. After almost three weeks, bail came through.\n\nSuite 1221 of the St. Francis Hotel, shortly after the party\n\nDuring the three trials, several witnesses testified Virginia suffered from cystitis, which worsens by the imbibing of alcohol; venereal disease; and several substandard abortions within a few years (the last one days before the party).\n\nThe sleazy William Randolph Hearst absolutely loved this story, since it “sold more newspapers than any event since the sinking of the Lusitania.” This was one of a number of Hollywood scandals which led to the creation of the infamous Hays Code.\n\nThe public judged Roscoe guilty immediately, and he went from mega-star to public enemy overnight. Many called for his death, studio executives issued a gag order prohibiting anyone from speaking up on his behalf, and his films were banned.\n\nThough yellow journalists portrayed Roscoe as some obese sex fiend who literally threw his weight around with innocent young ladies, Roscoe was extremely shy with women, very sweet-natured, chivalrous, and known as “the most chaste man in pictures.”\n\nCharlie Chaplin, who was in England at the time, positively spoke of Roscoe to reporters, and Roscoe’s best friend Buster Keaton got a mild reprimand for publicly speaking up in his defence. Cowboy actor William S. Hart, however, said some downright nasty, damaging things.\n\nIn response, Roscoe wrote a premise for a film parodying him as a wife-beater, bully, and thief, and sold it to Buster. In 1922, Buster made this film as two-reeler The Frozen North. Hart was so pissed, he didn’t speak to Buster for years.\n\nProsecutor Matthew Brady, San Fransisco District Attorney, made many public pronouncements of Roscoe’s alleged guilt, and pressured witnesses to lie under oath. During the indictment hearing, Mrs. Delmont was the star witness. Though the judge threatened to dismiss the case, Brady refused to let his own star witness testify by the actual trial.\n\nLike many other liars, Mrs. Delmont was eventually caught. She had a very long criminal record, with numerous convictions for fraud, bigamy, extortion, and racketeering. She also supposedly was making a career out of luring men into compromising situations and taking photographs for use in divorce proceedings.\n\nRoscoe’s lawyers also found a letter in which Mrs. Delmont admitted her plan to extort money from Roscoe.\n\nDuring the three trials, Roscoe’s estranged wife Minta regularly came to court to support him. One time, she was shot at while entering the courtroom.\n\nIn addition to all the witnesses being caught out as liars, the abovementioned evidence about Virginia’s health also came to light.\n\nRoscoe testified last, saying exactly what had happened at the party and how he’d tried to help.\n\nA mistrial was declared, and a second trial, with a new jury, began 11 January 1922. More monkey business was uncovered, and there was another mistrial. A third trial began 13 March 1922.\n\nRoscoe’s lawyer was much more aggressive the third time around, and finally, a unanimous not guilty verdict was declared, along with a major apology:\n\nAcquittal is not enough for Roscoe Arbuckle. We feel that a great injustice has been done him. We feel also that it was only our plain duty to give him this exoneration, under the evidence, for there was not the slightest proof adduced to connect him in any way with the commission of a crime. He was manly throughout the case and told a straightforward story on the witness stand, which we all believed. The happening at the hotel was an unfortunate affair for which Arbuckle, so the evidence shows, was in no way responsible. We wish him success and hope that the American people will take the judgment of fourteen men and women who have sat listening for thirty-one days to evidence, that Roscoe Arbuckle is entirely innocent and free from all blame.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nTo mark the 95th anniversary of the scandal which changed comedy legend Roscoe Arbuckle’s life forever, I’m doing another theme week. Roscoe was such a wonderful comedian and dear, sweet man who deserves to be remembered truthfully. Though he was completely exonerated, many people judge him guilty based on decades-old lies, and call him “Fatty.” However, I’m hopeful his reputation will continue its gradual rehabilitation and that more people will discover his surviving films.\n\nRoscoe Conkling Arbuckle was born 24 March 1887, in Smith Center, Kansas, weighing over 13 pounds. Since both of his parents were slim people, his father, William Goodrich Arbuckle, foolishly believed another man had to be the father. Thus, the baby was named for NY Republican Senator Roscoe Conkling, a notorious philanderer whom he hated. (What a loving father!)\n\nPossibly due to his large size, Roscoe’s birth was very traumatic and caused chronic health problems for his mother, Mary (Mollie) E. Gordon Arbuckle. These health problems sadly contributed to her death 12 years later. However, while his mother was still earthside, she encouraged him to join character actor Frank Bacon’s troupe in Santa Ana, California. Roscoe made his stage début at age eight.\n\nRoscoe had a wonderful singing voice and was very graceful in spite of his size. He moved like a ballerina. Roscoe loved performing, though after his mother’s death, his abusive father forced him to retire and wouldn’t even financially support him. Young Roscoe did odd jobs in a hotel, singing while he worked.\n\nOne day, a professional singer overheard him and invited him to an amateur talent show. The audience clapped or jeered, and bombing acts were pulled offstage by a hook. Roscoe didn’t impress them, and when he saw the hook coming, he fearfully dove into the orchestra pit. The audience went nuts over this, so much so Roscoe won the contest and began a vaudeville career.\n\nIn 1904, Sid Grauman invited Roscoe to sing by his new Unique Theater in San Francisco. After this, Roscoe joined the touring Pantages Theater Group. Ironically, this group was headed by Greek-born vaudevillian and producer Alexander Pantages, whose career also crashed to a halt after he was accused of rape. (Pantages was also ultimately acquitted, though that’s a whole other story!)\n\nIn 1906, Roscoe played by the Orpheum Theater in Portland, Oregon, in a vaudeville troupe headed by Australian-born Leon Errol. Roscoe rose to become the star, and went on tour again.\n\nOn 6 August 1908, Roscoe married Araminta (Minta) Estelle Durfee (1 October 1889–9 September 1975), whom he co-starred with many times from 1913 to 1916. In contrast to Roscoe, Minta was short and petite.\n\nAfter marrying, Roscoe joined the Morosco Burbank Stock vaudeville company, with whom he toured Japan and China. He started his film career in July 1909, after returning to the U.S.\n\nRoscoe’s first film was Ben’s Kid, shot by the Selig Polyscope Company. He appeared on and off in their one-reelers till 1913, then briefly moved to Universal Pictures. Soon after this, he got picked up by the legendary Mack Sennett, and became one of the famous Keystone Kops.\n\nThough Roscoe knew his weight was part of his appeal, he was very self-conscious about it, and had the dignity to refuse to use it for cheap laughs. For example, he never got stuck in a chair or doorway, and didn’t act winded going up or down stairs. He also hated the screen name “Fatty.”\n\nIn 1914, Paramount Pictures offered him $1,000 a day, 25% of all profits, and total creative control. Roscoe’s films were so popular, he was offered a three-year, three million dollar contract in 1918. This was about $47,000,000 in 2016 money.\n\nBesides wife Minta, Roscoe also frequently co-starred with Mabel Normand (one of the biggest female comedy stars of the era), his nephew Al St. John (the blonde on the right), his best friend Buster Keaton (on the left), and the awesome Luke, his very talented Pit Bull.\n\nThough Roscoe and Minta separated in 1921 (just prior to the scandal) and divorced in 1925, Minta always spoke of him in the most wonderful terms, calling him the most generous person she’d ever met, and that if she had to do it all over again, she’d still marry him. Roscoe also got visitation rights with Luke.\n\nRoscoe had a health scare in 1916, with an infected carbuncle that almost cost him his leg. Though he lost 80 pounds during recovery and saved his leg, he also became addicted to the drug of the gods, morphine. (I loved getting legally high on morphine after my surgeries and during my hospital stays!)\n\nAfter his recovery, he started his own film company, Comique. Roscoe continued going from strength to strength, and in 1920, he began making features.\n\nThen, on 5 September 1921, his life changed forever.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThis section includes spotlights on Roscoe Arbuckle and the seriously underrated but hilarious Charley Chase. Since writing this, I’ve been able to see most of Abbott and Costello’s films, and while I’ve grown to enjoy them, I just haven’t grown to like them enough to consider them favorites. It really makes me uncomfortable to watch and hear how Bud treats Lou, since there’s no sense that he loves him underneath it, unlike when we see Laurel and Hardy or the Three Stooges slapping one another around or berating one another. (Although I must admit Bud was pretty handsome in his physical prime.) I might have chuckled once or twice during their so-called funniest film, A&C Meet Frankenstein. Personally, they’re just not the type of comedians who make me frequently laugh out loud.\n\n***\n\n7. I really like Burns and Allen from what I’ve seen and heard of them so far. They were in movies and shorts, but they also had a radio show, which was just as hilarious. My mother used to give her parents tapes of the old radio shows from the Forties and Thirties for holiday presents, and in June of ’97 when I was with my grandparents, maternal aunt, and my cousin, on our way to and from Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, some of the comedy tapes they played included Burns and Allen (not my first exposure to them), and I was so enamoured I brought out my Laurel and Hardy laugh!\n\nThe skit I was laughing hardest over is one where Gracie signs George up for what she thinks is entertainment, as a birthday surprise, only it’s for having tests run on him. The doctors can’t understand why she’s so eager to do this for her husband, and wonder what kind of man George is for being willing to do this.\n\nGeorge is really thrown for a loop when he goes there and it’s revealed he’s not going to be entertaining people but really undergoing medical tests. He’s sitting there singing “I’m Writing Her a Letter,” really anxious for the party to begin, wondering why these fellows aren’t moving things along. “Can we start soon, ’cause I’m raring to go!”\n\nThey wonder what kind of guy he is, and one of the doctors points out that the other guy met his wife, which might explain things (Gracie is a bit of a flake). When George hears the words, “Now, we’d like you to take your clothes off,” he’s really taken aback, wondering what kind of people these fellows are, what kind of guy they think he is, and what in the world Gracie signed him up for!\n\n8. Bebe Daniels was a very funny, talented, comedically gifted woman who sadly has all but fallen into obscurity today. Mabel Normand was the silent comedy queen, but Bebe came in pretty close after Mabel. She made quite a number of shorts as Harold Lloyd’s leading lady (particularly in his earliest shorts as “Lonesome Luke,” before he began donning the glasses), until she went to work for a different studio and was replaced by Mildred Davis, who later became Harold’s real-life wife.\n\nBebe also played Princess Henriette in the disastrous (but technically great, gorgeous, and very well-meaning and ambitious) Monsieur Beaucaire and Zaida in 1927’s She’s a Sheik (which some sources inaccurately list as lost), as well as Dorothy in the original 1910 Wizard of Oz.\n\nShe played many types of roles equally well—slapstick, romantic comedy, Shakespeare, musicals (she transitioned to sound very successfully because of her lovely singing voice), Vamps, dancing, drama. She married actor Ben Lyon in 1930, having a long happy successful marriage that only ended when Bebe died in 1970.\n\n9. Abbott and Costello are viewed by some as dated, since not all people find their brand of slapstick and verbal humour appealing or funny to modern-day sensibilities. You like them or you don’t. Lou Costello was the short chubby guy, yet another innocent man-child, and Bud Abbott was the tall jowly straight man. They were in movies, burlesque, radio, vaudeville, and Broadway; undoubtedly their most famous and best-known act is the radio sketch “Who’s on First?” [And please, NEVER pull this on someone if you find out his or her favorite band is The Who, unless you’re the reincarnation of one of these fellows. It’s not funny or original. Don’t think you’re the first person who’s ever tried that on a Who freak, because you’re not.]\n\nNot all of their films were as great or classic as 1941’s Buck Privates (which is about new Army recruits, even though by modern sensibilities the title sounds like a porn movie!), though where there were a lack of characterisation and plot, there was a lot of good slapstick. A lot of their films, however, were hit and miss, and as the years went by, great films became farther and fewer in between, with each film worse than the last. Their best latter-day success came on television.\n\nTo each his or her own; I haven’t seen enough of their work to date to really judge them, but it’s apparent that many people find their work hit and miss, or consisting of a few comedy classics plus a bunch of stuff whose humour techniques don’t hold up very well today. And yet, they still do have a lot of fans, though while they’re legends, I just get the abiding impression that they’re not quite as beloved and esteemed as certain of the other comedy groups listed on here.\n\n10. Charley Chase is possibly one of the funniest best comedic actors you’ve never seen or heard of. At one point he was the top-paid, most popular star at Hal Roach Studios; Hal Roach himself repeatedly said Charley was the funniest fellow he’d ever known. Like Harold, Charley was also more or less just a regular guy who got into normal trouble and situations, which would proceed to get wilder and more out of control.\n\nCharley usually played a dapper, newly-rich guy, though a bit shy, and was also very inventive at getting out of trouble and saving the day. Sound was also very kind to him, as he had a wonderful speaking voice, and a great singing voice to boot. His career was ultimately ended because Hal Roach felt he couldn’t make the move to full-length features, never even giving him a chance to prove himself when most of the major studios were making the move from shorts to full-length features and making the short a thing of the past.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen of him on the shorts included in the nine-volume series The Lost Films of Laurel and Hardy, I really really like him and find him incredibly funny. I’m looking forward to the upcoming two-disc collection of his shorts, which has a LOT more material than the only current DVD offering besides the shorts on the abovementioned collection, The Charley Chase Slapstick Symposium. [Since writing this in 2005, I have indeed seen many, many of his shorts, both silent and sound, as many of them have finally become available on DVD since then.]\n\n11. Roscoe Arbuckle is unfortunately associated nowadays with the scandal that destroyed his reputation and career; most people don’t even know or care about his real name. If you’re a real fan, or if you at least care about him as a person, call him Roscoe, his real name, or at least say or write Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle. He was NEVER addressed as “Fatty” offscreen, and he would correct people who mistakenly called him such, sometimes saying, “I have a name, you know.”\n\nHe was a wonderful comedian, very very funny, head and shoulders above a lot of the crude primitive stuff going on in the early days of comedy in the Teens, had wonderful supporting actors around him (Mabel Normand, his nephew Al St. John, who usually played the bad guy, Buster Keaton, who became his best friend and protégé, and their canine pal Luke), and was a genuinely warm, sweet, shy, chaste, generous person offcamera.\n\nYou can see he’s a nice, sweet, friendly guy, and despite being quite a big boy (he was 14 pounds when he was born!), it was all muscle, not flab. A fat guy couldn’t do all the physical stuff Roscoe was doing. His transition from shorts to full-length features in the early Twenties was kind of shaky, but he’d just signed a new contract with a different studio, in which he would’ve had a lot of creative control (Roscoe had already written and directed many of his earlier shorts) and possibly more opportunities for success with features.\n\nThe heart breaks watching how happy everyone is in these shorts from the Teens, how much fun they’re all having, and knowing how not so long down the line, this terribly sweet, funny, darling, dear man, this gentle giant, was accused of raping and killing some aspiring starlet. People didn’t care he was eventually fully exonerated and given an unprecedented apology by the jury for the great wrong done him, that it was determined Virginia Rappé had died of peritonitis and a botched abortion (and possibly an untreated STD), that at the hospital Miss Rappé had tried to tell them Roscoe hadn’t hurt her, that he’d found her lying on the floor of his bathroom in the hotel suite and had been trying desperately, with much care and concern, to help her, even though he knew she was an unscrupulous figure of questionable morals whom many people in the business had given the pink slip to, how he said in the piece he wrote telling the story in his own words that he never did those things to her, that he would never hurt or rape a woman.\n\nBefore the scandal, he was second only to Chaplin, and in some polls even came in before him. Had the scandal not occurred, he most certainly would’ve gone down in history as one of the Top 3 silent clowns. His buddy Buster ended up replacing him in that position, and Harry Langdon was added to the list [by some, not all] as the fourth great silent clown, while Roscoe languished in obscurity and ridicule thanks to the scandal.\n\nHad he paid Mrs. Maude Delmont, who was there when he was trying to help Miss Rappé, the money she was asking, there might never have been a scandal. It exposed the system of how bribery had been previously used to silence scandals. Now when people hear his name, they think of rape and getting away with it, not the fact that he didn’t do it, was cleared and found innocent (legally, factually, medically, the whole nine yards), and just how funny and sweet he really truly was.\n\nSome people have posited the valid criticism that they don’t find Roscoe’s stuff funny or well-aged because he doesn’t really have a well-honed act or screen personality to fall back on besides the fact that he’s fat. We can predict how Buster, Charlie, Harold, Charley Chase, Stan and Ollie, the Marxes, and the Stooges, for example, would react to any given situation and what they’d do to get out of it, save the day, get the girl, but Roscoe’s character does seem to fluctuate depending upon the situation.\n\nHarold and Charley played normal, regular guys too, but at least they had characteristics distinguishing their characters from ordinary regular guys off the street. We know he’s funny and a nice, sweet, kind, inventive guy (and frequently very sneaky), but there still really isn’t a well-established persona. His reactions and solutions are of course great, just that some people don’t care for him because he has no established film persona coming up with these solutions to problems.\n\nSome people have also criticised him for how many times a short will jump around all over the place, changing plot and location without seeming rhyme or reason, such as how 1917’s The Butcher Boy begins in a general store and winds up at a girls’ school, where Roscoe, Buster, and Al have snuck in dressed as girls so Roscoe can be reunited with his sweetheart Amanda, who was shipped off there for punishment at the end of the first reel.\n\nStill, a lot of that unpredictability is what makes early comedy so great, fun, funny, and unpredictable. I was enamoured of him from the first I saw of him, and, like with Buster, the more I’ve seen of him, the more I like him.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
