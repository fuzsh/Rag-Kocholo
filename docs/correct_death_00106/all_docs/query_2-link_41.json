        "text": "Newspapers reflected the era, attracting readers with sensational stories. Throughout the decade, many newspapers drew readers by focusing on stories involving sex, crime, and celebrities. This was known as \"jazz-age journalism.\"\n\nIn 1921, a story broke that involved all three elements—sex, crime, and a celebrity. Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle, one of Hollywood’s most famous stars, was accused of sexually assaulting and killing a movie actress. The press pounced on the story, printing detail after lurid detail. The case of \"Fatty\" Arbuckle raised the question of whether a celebrity could get a fair trial amid enormous national press coverage.\n\nThe Rise of the Tabloids\n\nOn June 26, 1919, a new kind of newspaper called a tabloid hit the streets of New York City. Half the size (15 x 11 inches) of other newspapers, the Daily News typically displayed a front page with a screaming headline and large pictures. Inside, short, sensationalized news articles sat alongside photos, illustrations, and feature stories about the lives, loves, and misfortunes of both ordinary and famous people. Stories were intentionally written to startle, excite, and even mislead the reader. By 1924, the Daily News had the largest circulation of any paper in the country.\n\nThe success of the Daily News attracted the attention of major publishers like William Randolph Hearst, who established his own tabloids. Soon other tabloids appeared in most of the country’s big cities. Facing serious competition from these upstarts, traditional newspapers began to imitate the tabloids’ large front-page headlines, splashy photos, and sensational stories.\n\n\"Fatty\" Gets Into Trouble\n\nAlong with Charlie Chaplin, Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle was one of the great comic stars of silent pictures. Between 1913 and 1916, he made over 100 short films for the Mack Sennett Studio. By 1917, he was directing as well as acting in comic short movies in his own studio. He made his first feature-length film in 1919. Its success led to several feature-length comedies. Earning an incredible $5,000 a week, the 34-year-old Arbuckle completed three films in quick succession during the spring and summer of 1921. Then on Labor Day weekend, he took a break. With some of his Hollywood friends, he drove his Pierce Arrow touring car to San Francisco.\n\nArbuckle checked into a suite of rooms at the posh St. Francis Hotel. Numerous friends, city officials, and assorted freeloaders came around to see the Hollywood star. He ordered food and, despite Prohibition, managed to get three cases of liquor. Throughout the day, people came and went, ate and drank, listened and danced to records. Arbuckle, dressed in his pajamas and a robe, was the life of the party.\n\nOne of Arbuckle’s guests was Virginia Rappe a 25-year-old aspiring actress. In the late afternoon, Arbuckle went to his bedroom to dress for the evening. He later testified that he found Virginia Rappe on his bathroom floor writhing in pain. He said that he carried her to his bed. Others testified that they heard angry shouting coming from Arbuckle’s bedroom. At some point, Arbuckle apparently put some ice on her body. Others then came into the room and saw the delirious actress thrashing about on the bed grabbing at her torn clothes. Finally, Arbuckle called for a doctor, and Rappe was taken to a hospital. She died there a few days later without fully regaining her senses.\n\nShortly after Virginia Rappe died, San Francisco police arrested Arbuckle and charged him with murder. He was jailed and denied bail. Newspapers throughout the nation ran screaming headlines:\n\n\"Evidence Shows Conclusively He Was Directly Responsible for Death\"\n\n\"‘Arbuckle, Beast from Gutter, I Would Kill Him,’ Declares Virginia Rappe’s Fiance\"\n\n\"Plan to Send Arbuckle to Death on Gallows\"\n\nPictures of Arbuckle and others involved in the incident covered the front pages of many newspapers. The Los Angeles Times, hardly a tabloid, ran a spread of front-page photos with the headline, \"Three Striking Poses of Virginia Rappe, Victim in Arbuckle Orgy.\" In many cities, movie houses canceled the showing of \"Fatty\" Arbuckle films.\n\nOn September 13, 1921, a San Francisco grand jury indicted Arbuckle for manslaughter. Not satisfied, San Francisco District Attorney Matthew Brady announced that he would not proceed on the indictment but would seek a first-degree murder charge against the actor at a preliminary hearing.\n\nIn the meantime, newspapers reported the findings of the coroner’s jury. The jury concluded that Virginia Rappe died from a ruptured bladder and peritonitis \"caused by the application of some force which, from evidence submitted, was applied by one Roscoe Arbuckle.\"\n\nThe preliminary hearing took more than a week. The district attorney attempted to convince the judge that Arbuckle, who weighed over 300 pounds, had sexually assaulted Virginia Rappe causing her injury and death. The judge, however, found evidence supporting only a trial for manslaughter. He ordered Arbuckle released on $5,000 bail.\n\nArbuckle returned to a shocking reception in Los Angeles. More than a thousand people, described by one witness as a \"hate-frenzied mob,\" met Arbuckle at the train station. \"Murderer!\" some yelled. \"Beast!\" jeered others. Police had to protect him as he made his way to a waiting car.\n\n\"Fatty\" On Trial\n\nNewspaper reporters from all over the country and crowds of curious onlookers came to see \"Fatty\" Arbuckle on trial. The trial began on November 14, 1921, and lasted for three weeks. Arbuckle denied attacking Virginia Rappe. His attorneys introduced evidence that the actress had long-suffered from a bladder disease. The prosecution played up the \"wild orgy\" in Arbuckle’s hotel suite and described him as a depraved emperor \"sitting on his throne and pouring wine.\" On December 5, after 40 hours of deliberation, the jurors reported that they were hopelessly deadlocked 10–2 for acquittal. The district attorney called for an immediate retrial.\n\nArbuckle did not testify at his second trial. The jury deadlocked 10–2 for conviction. Again the district attorney demanded a new trial.\n\nThe third trial opened on March 6 and continued for over a month. Arbuckle testified, as did more than 70 other witnesses, including doctors who testified about Rappe’s chronic illness. In the end, the jury barely met for five minutes and found Arbuckle not guilty.\n\n\"Fatty\" Is Banned\n\nThe verdict did not end Arbuckle’s troubles. Several groups, concerned with immorality in Hollywood’s movies, had mounted efforts to get the government to censor movies. To prevent government censorship, the movie industry set up its own clean-up campaign. Just six days after Arbuckle was found innocent, the newly appointed head of the campaign banned the screening of his films. With all the negative press Arbuckle had gotten, he became the perfect scapegoat to prove the industry was cracking down on immoral behavior.\n\n\"Fatty\" Arbuckle did eventually return to the movies as a director (under a pseudonym) and even acted again in some comic shorts. But his career as a movie great ended in the storm of publicity surrounding his three trials. He died in his sleep at age 46 in 1933, leaving an estate valued at $2,000.\n\nNobody will probably ever know exactly what happened in \"Fatty\" Arbuckle’s hotel room in San Francisco. But two juries heard evidence in the case and failed to convict him of any wrongdoing. A third jury acquitted him and even issued an extraordinary statement saying, \"...We...hope that the American people will take the judgment of 14 men and women who have sat listening for 31 days to evidence that Roscoe Arbuckle is entirely innocent and free from all blame.\" But many people in America judged Arbuckle from the sensational allegations raised in newspapers across the country, and Arbuckle suffered greatly. Even today, you can read many accounts of the Arbuckle scandal that seem to be based on wild accusations printed at the time.\n\nFor Discussion and Writing\n\nWhat methods made the tabloids different from traditional newspapers?\n\nWhich do you think is more trustworthy—evidence presented at a trial or news stories in a newspaper? Why?\n\nDo you think \"Fatty\" Arbuckle was treated fairly by the press? By the motion-picture industry? Explain your answers.\n\nWhat similarities do you see between press coverage of the \"Fatty\" Arbuckle trials in 1921–22 and coverage of trials of celebrities today?\n\nA C T I V I T Y\n\nShould Witnesses Be Prohibited from Selling Their Stories?\n\nIn this activity, students role-play advisers to the governor (played by the teacher).\n\nA recent development in tabloid-style news is the payment of fees for exclusive stories. This practice has drawn heavy criticism, especially when tabloids pay prospective witnesses in criminal trials. Critics fear both that people might make up sensational stories for tabloids and that juries might not believe witnesses who have been paid by tabloids.\n\nImagine that your state legislature is considering a bill that will make it illegal for witnesses in criminal matters to \"receive payment for providing information obtained by witnessing an event or having personal knowledge of the facts.\"\n\nThe governor, unsure about this bill, asks your advice. The governor particularly wants your opinions, supported with reasons, on the following questions:"
