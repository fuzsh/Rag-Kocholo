        "text": "Jury return charge of manslaughter\n\nNurses differing evidence\n\nSan Francisco, Wednesday\n\nThe grand jury yesterday evening indicted Roscoe Arbuckle on a charge of manslaughter. It is reported that the jurors voted in favour of the indictment by twelve votes to two. It is expected the charge will be brought before the Court on Thursday.\n\nThe fact that the indictment specified manslaughter instead of murder is regarded as a distinct Arbuckle victory. Arbuckle’s attorneys are now seeking a release on bail. The indictment charges Arbuckle with killing Virginia Rappe with malice aforethought, but does not charge it as premeditated.\n\nThe police court murder charge still stands. The result of the inquest will determine whether the prosecutor will press the murder or manslaughter charge.\n\nThe inquest\n\nIn the evidence given at the Coroner’s inquiry into the death of the film actress, Miss Virginia Rappe, it was alleged that the film comedian, Roscoe (“Fatty”) Arbuckle, retired with the girl to a bedroom, where they remained together for an hour. Finally, in consequence of screams coming from the room, Mrs. Delmont, a friend of the dead girl, decided to telephone to the manager of the hotel in which Arbuckle’s rooms were situated.\n\nArbuckle then came out of the room and Mrs. Delmont entered it to find Miss Rappe lying on the bed in a hysterical condition. Attempts were made to revive her, and a detective shortly afterwards appeared on the scene.\n\nReplying to a question, witness said Miss Rappe did not object when Arbuckle took her into the bedroom. Miss Cumberland, a nurse, informed the Coroner that Miss Rappe had declared that there had been intimacy between her and Arbuckle.\n\nThe wife of the accused, who has been living apart from him, has announced her intention of travelling to San Francisco to support her husband during his trial.\n\nThe testimony at the second day of the Coroner’s inquest in the case of Miss Rappe would seem to have strengthened “Fatty” Arbuckle’s defence (says an Exchange telegram). The evidence of Mrs. Delmont, who laid the complaint, differed in important particulars from the original charges. The witness appeared exceedingly nervous and Arbuckle gazed fixedly at her throughout.\n\nAt the afternoon session, Nurse Jean Jameson, whose affidavit primarily caused the charge of murder against Arbuckle, testified that the dead girl, Virginia Rappe, told witness before her death that she did not know whether she had been assaulted or not and had suffered a six weeks’ ailment, for which she blamed relations with another. The attorneys for Arbuckle declare that the evidence ensures his acquittal.\n\nAccording to a Press Association Foreign Special account of the proceedings Arbuckle listened with rapt attention to the various witnesses. Evidence related to the party in Arbuckle’s apartment as the outcome of which he stood charged with the murder of Miss Rappe. His mood was one of indifference to everything in the courtroom except the weaving of the story of the tragedy. He paid no attention to the photographers, who were snapping him from every angle, and disdained all the questions of would-be interviewers.\n\nMrs. Delmont’s Story.\n\nMrs. Delmont, one of the women present in Arbuckle’s apartment when the alleged assault was committed, stated that the film star dragged Miss Rappe into a bedroom and locked the door, and that she heard screams coming from the bedroom an hour afterwards. She added that when Arbuckle finally opened the door at her request she found Miss Rappe on the bed tearing at the clothing, and screaming “I am dying, I am dying; he did it.”\n\nArbuckle kept his eyes fixed on the witness throughout her evidence. When Mrs. Delmont, who had testified that she drank ten glasses of whisky at the party, had concluded her evidence, the Coroner asked her how she could remember what had happened.\n\n“My memory is always good,” she replied. Mrs. Delmont had previously testified that she brought whisky in her motor-car from Los Angeles. She said that Miss Rappe did not drink any of it, but had three glasses of gin mixed with orange wine in Arbuckle’s apartment."
