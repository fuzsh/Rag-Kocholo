    "text": "This is my Grandma: Phebie (Phebia) Reed Adkins 1909-1987 The daughter of William Grats and Margaret Cook Reed. I may make a Reed family page later. I have all their info back to John Franklin Reed born 1803 in North Carolina and died sometime after 1870 in LaFollette, Campbell, Tennessee. But this page is for the Adkins side.\n\nThis is my Grandpa: Kelley (Kelly) Lewis Adkins 1905-1983\n\nKelley Adkins was the son of Jasper Newton Adkins and Teareasy Montgomery, and he married Phebia Reed 22 JUL 1925 in Greenup, Kentucky. Together they had 12 children. Kell’s father Jasper was the son of Louis/Lewis Adkins and Julia Ann Blankenship. Lewis was the son of Absalom “Apps” Adkins (1810 – bef 1870)and Delila Elswick (1811-1894). Apps was the son of Thomas (1775 – 1829) and Olivia Morgan (1780-1870) Adkins.\n\nJulia Ann Blankenship was the daughter of Henry 1790 and Drucilla Pierce Adkins born 1792. I was really hoping she was the daughter of his brother William his wife’s name was Cindrilla Susan Gibbs born 1816 spelled Cinderella on all the census so that is how it was pronounced. How cool is that for a name? I always thought the name Cinderella was made up for story books. But their daughter, Julia Ann Blankenship never married.\n\nBut anyway, Drucilla and Clarinda are commonly used names by the Adkins/Montgomery families… I still need to find Jasper and Teresa’s daughter Clarinda Adkins born abt 1891 – death date and burial. They had 13 children total as reported by them on the 1900 census, but I cannot find all their names. And news flash: Twins run in the Montgomery line.\n\nDelila Elswick the daughter of Edward born 1784 and Mary Meredith 1788 Elswick. married Absalom Apps’ Adkins in Pike, Kentucky (ADKINS, Absolem ELSWICK, Delila 09-SEP-1830).\n\nApp’s dad, Thomas Adkins was the son of Jesse 1754 and Mary Adkins 1754, I know.\n\nHere is where the family is split: [Some believe App’s to be the son of Joel (1756-1856) & Rachel Emmerson (1764-1840) Adkins. They further believe even though Absalom signed his middle name Apperson its actually Emmerson. Joel Atkinson & Rachel Emmerson married in Pittsylvania, VA 9 Apr 1780) Joel Adkins (Atkinson) being the son of Richard & Mary Molly Littleberry. Richard being the son of William & Elizabeth Parker Adkins. I will do my level best to prove which one for a FACT, hopefully this year. I know that both end up the same place, but I need to be 100% sure].\n\nJesse was the son of William and Lydia Owens. William was the son of William V 1689 and Elizabeth Parker 1695 Adkins. Now William V was the son of John 1639 and Elizabeth Bromwell 1641 Adkins from Bedfordshire, England.\n\nJohn was the son of Thomas and Agnes Adkins, Thomas was born 1610 in Bedfordshire. Thomas was the son of Thomas 1554 and Hester Frasure. Thomas was the son of Henry born 1530 and Francis Edwards Adkins. After this the trail runs cold but still in England.\n\nAll the Adkins families descended from Adams’ in the 1300’s. It was common practice then to honor a favored son with his own surname. They took the first two letters of his name and added kin to it making Ad-ams to Ad – kin then later to Adkins. It happened in all families.\n\nJasper Newton Adkins, Papaw Kell’s dad, married Teareasy Clarinda Montgomery aka Teresa; the only child of Jane Montgomery. Her father was an Indian. Jane Montgomery was born the illegitimate child of James Reuben Howard and Margaret B Montgomery aka “Peggie Montgomery”. Now, James and Peggie were never married. I’m also not clear if he was James Reuben or Reuben James Howard (or they could even be two different men)? The two had several children together, so I know they loved one another, very much.\n\nSince, Teresa didn’t die in Kentucky, I cannot get a Kentucky death certificate for her. Papaw Kell said she died in childbirth. The story goes; she was kicked in the stomach by a cow, while pregnant causing her to lose the child and die.\n\nNow most of all of our Adkins family is from Salyersville, Magoffin, Kentucky, some from Morgan and Bath. But is 1906 they took a trip to Ardmore, Carter, Oklahoma where Teresa Montgomery Adkins died and they brought her body back to Kentucky to bury. By 1920 Jasper was living in Morgan County.\n\nNow my biggest question is still… WHY almost all of our family members decided to take the trip on the wagon train in 1906 to Ardmore, Carter, Oklahoma. Why did all these people leave Ky. sell their land and all the things they had to go to a place that was poorer than where they lived? What was the driving force behind this? Ben Montgomery was the brother of Jane and he married Eliza Coffee. Three or more of Jasper’s brother’s went. Margaret may have went as well. I still searching. What was the driving force behind such a daring move? If anyone has any ideas that would be a tremendous help.\n\nNow as for me, my dad was Willie Louis (1937-2002) married to Julia Lorraine Stump (1937-1978) Adkins. Son of Kelley Lewis and Phebia Reed Adkins.\n\nI want to personally thank my uncle Denny Ray Adkins for all of his help in piecing this together. To my aunt Betty Lou Adkins Jensen for sharing her paperwork on the families with me as well.\n\nPS: the names are spelled correctly, they were just spelled differently back then. Grandma Phebie’s school records show her listed as Feby Reed.\n\nOkay I did my part, now all you cousins step up… send me the names and dates you may have and we can get this info all in one place. If you know of any details, no matter how small, please email me or leave a comment. I would love some old and new pictures."
