Director’s statement

“I travelled to Afghanistan in 2002 as Samira Makhmalbaf’s assistant director on her second film. One day, searching for suitable locations, we visited a prison in Kabul. There I met children of female inmates who were living prisoners with their mothers. At first I thought the children were also convicts but then I found out they were the children of the women in the prison, and that thay had no home outside the prison and had to stay with their mothers during the night and leave in the morning to earn a living outside. The story of STRAY DOGS took shape in my mind as I thought about the lives of those children”.
