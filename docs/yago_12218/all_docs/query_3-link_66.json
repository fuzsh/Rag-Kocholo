        "text": "A cast of newcomers helm this coming-of-age story that centres on teenage Black and brown girls from London, with Bukky Bakray winning a BAFTA Rising Star Award for her performance in the titular role. When Rocks’s depression-prone mother disappears, she tries to keep herself and her little brother out of care, putting strong female friendships to the test in the process. Directed by Sarah Gavron and written by Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson, it’s particularly appropriate for International Women’s Day.\n\nFor a decade, Barbra Streisand doggedly pursued bringing Yentl to the big screen – ultimately directing, co-writing, and starring in this refreshingly feminist musical. Streisand plays Yentl, a young Jewish woman growing up in a Polish shtetl, where girls are forbidden from studying books. When her father dies, she opts to dress and live as a boy so that she can pursue a religious education.\n\nDirector Marzieh Meshkini became the first Iranian woman to win an award at the Venice Film Festival with this moving film made up of three interconnected vignettes depicting the struggles of different women. The first follows a girl, who upon her ninth birthday is told she can no longer play with her male best friend; the second, a married woman who takes part in a cycling race to the chagrin of her husband; and the third, an elderly widow who finally finds financial freedom.\n\nWadjda is both the first feature film shot entirely in Saudi Arabia and the first to be directed by a female Saudi auteur, Haifaa al-Mansour. Its inspiring plot follows a rebellious 10 year old (Waad Mohammed), who enters a Qur’an recitation competition to win the money for a bike, despite it being frowned upon for girls in her conservative community.\n\nIn Alfonso Cuarón’s striking Oscar-nominated film, Yalitza Aparicio plays Cleo, a domestic worker for a privileged family in ’70s Mexico, who finds herself in the centre of personal and political strife – discovering that she is pregnant (and, almost simultaneously, that the family patriarch intends to leave his wife) as violent protests take over Mexico City.\n\nCheryl Dunye wrote, directed and starred in the landmark The Watermelon Woman – the first feature-length film directed by a black lesbian. Developed in response to the erasure of African American women from cinema, it sees Dunye’s character – a queer video store employee – form an unexpected relationship with a white woman (Guinevere Turner) while investigating the history of Hollywood’s forgotten lesbian icons. Essential viewing.\n\nDirector Niki Caro helmed this 2015 Kiwi classic years before being tapped to direct Disney’s blockbuster remake of Mulan. Keisha Castle-Hughes shines as a 12-year-old Maori girl, who trains to be the chief of her tribe – in spite of resistance from her patriarchal grandfather.\n\nWritten and directed by Desiree Akhavan, this brilliant comedy follows Iranian-American Shirin (Akhavan), who struggles to tell her family that she’s bisexual after a break up with her girlfriend leaves her both homeless and jobless."
