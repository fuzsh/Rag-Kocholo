        "text": "Well... It turns out that renowned Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf has a wife. Her name is Marzieh Meshkini.\n\nShe is a filmmaker...\n\n...and, my God, she made a masterpiece of contemporary cinema.\n\nThe Day I Became a Woman consists of three interconnected stories that depict the lifestyle of Iranian women in modernity throughout three of her life stages: infancy, young adulthood and old age.\n\n+ Episode I: \"Hawa\".- A young girl faces the consequences of turning into a nine-year-old girl, as she is no longer able to play with her old male friends because she has finally become a woman.\n\n+ Episode II: \"Ahoo\".- A recently married young woman embarks on a purely symbolic race againts the limitations imposed by…\n\nI cannot speak highly enough of this one.\n\nThree segments tell the tales of three women: a child on the verge of official womanhood, a wife racing on her bicycle to escape her husband, and an old woman indulging in everything she never had.\n\nIn the first segment, the young boys our heroine plays with eventually set sail at the end, an interesting contrasting freedom to her having to return to her mother and grandmother (her main playmate, however, is restrained by schoolwork). In the middle section, Ahoo struggles to win her bicycle race, which is also a race against the various men who seek to bring her back to her husband. And in the third segment, the old woman…\n\nA beautiful, sad, wise meditation on what it means to be a woman in Iran.\n\nWe see snapshots of three women, of three different generations, all captured at pivotal points in their lives. One turns nine and is declared a woman, told she must now cover her hair, and may no longer get ice cream or spend time with her little boy playmate. And so, in farewell, they share candy and a sucker. He is stuck inside, not allowed out until he finishes his homework; for her, it is a final hour of freedom.\n\nAnother, a young bride, participates in a bicycle race against her husband's will, and finds herself in a state of crisis. A third, an elderly woman,…\n\n“One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman”\n\n- Simone de Beauvoir\n\nSimone de Beauvoir's words come to mind when viewing The Day I Became a Woman. Their philosophies are inherently linked, and while de Beauvoir's words can mean different things to different women, especially in regards to trans women, I think the root of it's radicalism is in how it analyzes socialization in a world driven by patriarchy. Meshkini's film The Day I Became a Woman is also about expectations brought upon women by simply being, and it lies in the intersection of women living in the middle east, which is a narrative that isn't as common in wider feminist film discussion.\n\nThe film is broken up into…\n\n69/100\n\nSecond viewing, last seen at the 2000 Thessaloniki Film Festival. I briefly got excited about the prospect of Meshkini potentially becoming a major Iranian director, but that didn't pan out, alas. (To be fair, Makhmalbaf hasn't been internationally relevant since around the same time. I've seen nothing since Kandahar, 20 years ago now. And Samira's made one film since 2003, if the IMDb can be trusted.) Her debut remains quite strong, though, bolstered by the magnificent short that constitutes its middle story. Since I rated Buster Scruggs' individual components, I'll do the same here:\n\nHava (the little girl): 67\n\nAzoo (the cyclist): 84\n\nHoora (the old woman): 57\n\nSpent a fair bit of this go-round thinking once again about…\n\nMystical, poetic and strikingly upsetting, Meshkini's passional feature debut bespeaks the story of harsh trials and tribulations faced by women in contemporary Iranian society while her experiential insights of being in the structure meets the cutting criticism of that cultural customs and beliefs. Melding the images of lost innocence, then the butchery of the youthful enthusiasm, and personal freedom of a woman's life with yearning desires of living it in her own way at various stages of life, this film imposingly articulates a message reflecting societal impressions which are both haunting and heart-warming at once.\n\nExercising evocative visuals, naked simplicity and allegorical depth, Meshkini's film thrives in embodying the starkness of its thematic gravity and the sign of female perseverance…\n\nOMAMAY I LOVE THIS!\n\n*Spoiler\n\nIranian films are very charming, watching each story is simple and packaged very well by them, we are taken to a new world of cinema that doesn't need a lot of action or special effects, because they put more emphasis on stories about ordinary people, usually telling stories about children, who struggle with emotions. And almost all the stories always manage to touch the heart. That's why I love Iranian films, and this one will be my all-time favorite.\n\nThe day I became a woman tells about three stories from three different women. First there was Hava, a nine year old child who wanted to play with her best friend. But her grandmother didn't allow…\n\nI might be wrong, but I think this is the first Iranian film directed by a woman that I’ve personally seen. Definitely want to see more of that. This is a lovely little film, which is basically three vignettes depicting three different generations of women living under a strict patriarchal culture. First is about a little girl who has to adjust to becoming a “woman” on her ninth birthday (which means she can’t play with boys anymore, which includes her best friend). The second is a young married woman who is participating in a bicycle race that her husband forbade her from, as she’s chased down by him and the male members of her family (on horseback) and is attempting…\n\nthree different tales told by the sea. one, a young girl (hava) who - in her culture - has become old enough to be considered a \"woman\" now. she's no longer allowed to be herself, to spend time with who she used to spend time with, or to do the things she used to do. now she must conform to societal rules, obligations and expectations. in that same vein, we have our second story (ahoo). an older girl than hava, still only on the cusp of actual womanhood, though she's already married. controlled by her husband and family, again we see a girl not being allowed to be herself, or to do what she wants to do. where hava was…\n\nEvery now and again you're conscious while you are watching a film that you are watching images that will stay with you, that a film will matter to you.\n\nThis is an amazing piece of film making. The first of it's anthology of stories, about a girl, an intelligent, curious, logical nine year old girl, being told she is now a woman and can no longer play with boys or walk on roofs or where the clothes she had previously worn, is touching and absurdly funny and beautifully made but also something we have seen before. Something that plays into our preconceptions about Islam and about patriarchy, something that makes you nod about your long held ideas.\n\nIt's young actress…"
