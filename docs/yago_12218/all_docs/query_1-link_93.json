Said falls in with a group of old men looking for their bombed-out village; he offers to guide them, and takes as his wife Halaleh, the clan's lone woman, a widow with a young son. Reeboir attaches himself to a dozen pre-teen boys weighed down by contraband they carry across the border; they're mules, always on the move. Said and Reeboir try to teach as their potential students keep walking. Danger is close; armed soldiers patrol the skies, the roads, and the border. Is there a role for a teacher? Is there hope?",

        "text": "A gaggle of men huddle beneath their blackboards as something flies overhead, literally shielded by their education. As they wander through nomads and smugglers, they try to bring their education to them, but life, war, and the world itself get in the way. One man barters his teaching for a wife; another latches onto children. Neither manages to teach much in the midst of chaos.\n\n''My heart is like a train. At every station, someone gets on or off. But there is someone who never gets off. My son.''\n\nBoth conceptually and visually, this is quite a striking film from (then) 19 year old Samira Makhmalbaf, daughter of famed Iran filmmaker Mohsen who assisted her in bringing her sophomore film to life. Whilst sometimes absurdist and largely metaphoric, it would seem that she has respectfully learnt from the filmmaking connections around her (even filmmaker Bahman Ghobadi has a lead role in the film) and is displaying a style that is quite unique, but also honours her peers. From the outset, the visual sense is strong as we are introduced to a group of teachers that…\n\n3 /10\n\nAbout a third of the way through, I realised that it seemed as though everything scripted was being repeated in triplicate (or more) & this really started annoying the fuck out of me -\n\nso much so, that I almost forgot how much I enjoyed the opening & early scenes & how spectacular the cinematography & framing are.\n\nAnd I don't know about everyone else, but once I start disliking a movie as it's screening, I then only start noticing all that's wrong with it.\n\nI also realised that despite it being a relatively short movie, I couldn’t wait for it to end so I could get out of the cinema\n\nIt’s a great story, but the script is ‘over-thought’ & that constant repetition is damn annoying.\n\nFrom the 8 movie :”The House That Mohsen Built: The Films of Samira Makhmalbaf, Marzieh Meshkini & Mohsen Makhmalbaf.” component of the 2024 Melbourne Cinémathèque Program.\n\nHere is where you beg people to learn.\n\nHere is where everyone cares about food and money and not what brings them.\n\nHere is where you tell a kid to learn how to write a story and he tells you one.\n\nHere is where you marry a stranger with a blackboard just so he can prevent you from hunger, but he's hungry himself.\n\nHere is where you teach someone those three words \"I love you\", and ignores you.\n\nHere is where a woman described her heart as a train that her son is a homeless passenger that lives there.\n\nHere is where you carry the board and look for students.\n\nHere is where your blackboard is used to carry a sick old man.\n\nHere is where you and your blackboard mean nothing.\n\nWith two films under watch it seems Samira has a lot of ambitious ideas but not enough skills to make those ideas into great films. It's a shame, since the people groups she usually shows rarely have a voice in cinema. One can hope she will improve eventually, but with a new film no where to be seen, it is hardly."
