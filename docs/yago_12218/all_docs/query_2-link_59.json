        "text": "“A simple work of genius. I have never seen a feature film like this. The dogs are not being used by the human filmmakers to tell a human story — we are here to let the dogs tell us their story, even if we haven't a clue what's going on inside their heads.”\n\nMike’s Letter, Michael Moore\n\n“Organically and entirely without judgment, “Stray” builds a subtle, cross-species commentary that’s more than a little melancholy. While never directly political, Lo’s camera is there when the animals encounter a women’s march for equality and when the refugees connect with boatmen who share their own migrant past. The filmmaker's eyes may rarely leave the dogs, but what she’s really looking at is us.”\n\nJeanette Catsoulis, New York Times Critics' Pick\n\n“The ultimate love letter to dogs and a multifaceted moral inquiry into humanity. Stray is an urban musical opus with a strange and singular beauty.”\n\nTomris Laffly, Variety\n\n“A howling success. An extraordinary technical feat as well as profoundly expressive. Lo's artful, intimate documentary joins a growing body of indelible nonfiction films, among them ‘Gunda,' that address the mystery of human-animal relationships and the need to reconsider our assumptions.”\n\nSheri Linden, The Hollywood Reporter\n\n\"Lo’s direction is provocative and lively, shooting at barely knee-height throughout, with tracking shots that feel properly ripped right out of late-period Terence Malick.\"\n\nJoshua Brunsting, Criterioncast\n\n“Dog lovers will drool over this profound canine love letter from Turkey.”\n\nEric Kohn, Indiewire\n\n“Captivating and immersive. There’s a tremendous amount of human skill, empathy, observational power and narrative shaping in Lo’s mesmerizing canine saga.”\n\nScott Macaulay, Filmmaker Magazine\n\n“Oddly beautiful, a social-realist nature movie with a note of the mythic.”\n\nDanny Leigh, Financial Times\n\n\"Lo’s film purposefully transcends hard-line stances that plainly condemn ideological hypocrisies, instead opting for a sweeping visual and philosophical framework to enlighten audiences in a creatively beautiful way.”\n\nNatalie Keogan, Paste Magazine\n\n“What Lo captures is remarkable as she stays with dogs that most people see only for a moment. Lo’s humane film helps us glimpse the lives of those who are often overlooked, whether they walk the streets of Istanbul on four legs or two.”\n\nKimber Myers, Los Angeles Times\n\n“With what must have been infinite, backbreaking patience, Lo and crew follow the dogs as they freely pass from rich to poor neighborhoods, from luxury to squalor. The city comes alive not only with rich and redolent visuals, but with the elegant sound design by Ernst Karel. The sounds of the city are deftly orchestrated and integrated with the exquisite, atonal soundtrack by Ali Helnwein.”\n\nPeter Keough, Boston Globe\n\n“Elizabeth Lo’s “Stray” is an incredibly stirring film. The director has something profound to say about humanity.”\n\nAnthony Francis, Screen Comment\n\n“Lo’s documentary finds its strength in a refusal to tidily shape it for the catharsis of her audience. Instead, Stray invites us to wonder about the ambiguities of interspecies survival and freedom in the context of nationalism, war, and the policing of public space.”"
