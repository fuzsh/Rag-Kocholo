        "text": "America/New_York The Day I Became a Woman Film Screening and Q&A OPEN TO THE PUBLIC | Screening and Q&A with Mansour Farhang and John Limbert Tishman Lecture Hall Bennington College\n\nOPEN TO THE PUBLIC | Join us in a screening of The Day I Became a Woman. The film depicts different experiences of womanhood in post-revolutionary Iran through a series of three short films.\n\nFrom Richard Brody’s review in The Front Row: “Marzieh Meshkini’s three-part film, The Day I Became a Woman, from 2000, is a masterwork of symbolic cinema; it depicts, with vast imagination, the ordeals faced by women in modern Iranian society. Meshkini reportedly made it as three separate short films, in order to elude the system of official censorship that governed features but not shorts. The result is a trio of tightly composed and lyrically filmed episodes, titled by the name of their protagonists, that offer images of enormous psychological power—images that ought to haunt both the memory and the subconscious of anyone who sees them.”\n\nThe screening will be followed by a conversation with visiting faculty members Mansour Farhang and John Limbert who are teaching the course Iran: A Theocracy in Crisis this spring."
