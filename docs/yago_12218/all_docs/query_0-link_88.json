        "text": "My Super Ex-Girlfriend\n\n20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, 12, £17.99\n\n****\n\nSuperman can get lost - this is the the super-est film of the week. Unloved on release (but then, so was the excellent Anchorman), it's a hilarious romcom starring Uma Thurman as G-Girl, a neurotic superheroine who falls for normal, nice guy architect (Luke Wilson), reveals her secret identity and gets dumped - and sure doesn't like it. Including the immortal relationship break-up justification 'Well, you did throw a shark at me', this is smart, fresh, funny and has touches of the surreal that border on genius. It unforgettably explores that superhero final frontier: the bed-wrecking realms of 'super sex' (yes, all her muscles are steel-like). Co-starring Eddie Izzard on spiffing form as G-Girl's nemesis/lovelorn high-school sweetheart Professor Bedlam, it's not only one of the best comedies of 2006 but also the finest thing Ivan (Ghostbusters) Reitman has directed for a very long time.\n\nExtras: Director and writer commentary, deleted scenes, featurettes. Larushka Ivan-Zadeh\n\nSuperman Returns: Two-disc Special Edition\n\nWarner Home Video, 12, £25.99\n\n****\n\nOn cinematic release, this seemed to perk up a tired old franchise in a way the boy Craig's just done for Bond. Yet shrinking it to the small screen magnifies the faults of director Bryan X-Men Singer's grandiose (what's with all the Messiah stuff?), under-trimmed epic. It seems that while Superman's been off 'finding himself', Lois Lane (bland Kate Bosworth) has got a sprog and a new man. Cue lots of morally heroic, if decidedly unpassionate (what do you expect from a man who wears tights?) soulsearching between some top-notch special FX set pieces. Kevin Spacey romps home as baddie Lex Luthor - but it's hard to get that excited about his unsuspenseful Dr Evil plot involving crystals, which gets totally tangled up in its own cape.\n\nExtras: Earn that extra star. More than three hours of bonus features, including additional scenes, in-depth making-of, and three-hour doc Requiem For Krypton. Larushka Ivan-Zadeh\n\nNacho Libre\n\nParamount Home Entertainment, 12, £19.99\n\n**\n\nYes, I know the idea of Jack Black as a Mexican wrestling monk in stretchy pants seems rich in comic potential. Yet this colourful, jauntily soundtracked 'comedy' is, amazingly, even less funny than I remembered. And I remember it having precisely one laugh - involving wrestling wolfboy midgets. Not big or clever, but neither is the rest of a script which relies so heavily on poo and falling over that its target audience should be the nine-year-old little orphans that Jack is meant to be caring for. Shame it's a '12' certificate, then. Extras: Nacho-crunching commentary by Jack Black and co-writer/director Jared Hess, on-set mini featurettes including cool snippets on Mexican wrestling, Jack sings.\n\nLarushka Ivan-Zadeh\n\nStray Dogs\n\nArtificial Eye, 12, £19.99\n\n****\n\nZahed and Gol-Ghotai, an Afghan brother and sister, rescue a dog from being killed by a horde of dispossessed children. But these siblings are actually the stray dogs of the title; in contrast to their new pet, which they cosset, feed and care for, they are utterly neglected. Their Taliban father, a prisoner of the Americans, resurfaced only to find their mother had remarried. Outraged, he had her thrown in jail. Now the children spend their days selling scraps and their nights in their mother's cell - until her guards are told to deny them access. For her second film, Marzieh Meshkini - wife of legendary Iranian filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf - has found amateur actors whose faces express such hurt, bewilderment and panic that plot is redundant. With its fantastic cinematography and nod to De Sica's The Bicycle Thief, this is an evocative depiction of a world so topsy-turvy that good children are encouraged to steal and dogs receive more kindness than small humans.\n\nExtras: Written interview with Meshkini. Nina Caplan\n\nThe Two Faces of Mitchell and Webb\n\nUniversal, 15, £19.99\n\n***\n\nLast week, Little Britain's David Walliams and Matt Lucas brought out a DVD mid-tour. Now David Mitchell and Robert Webb follow suit. But this series of sketches from the Peep Show boys - Cambridge Footlights cohorts regarded perhaps inevitably by some as a modern-day Fry and Laurie - is less grotesque and ostentatious than that of their counterparts and none the worse for that. The show is based on their BBC2 offering That Mitchell And Webb Look and sketches such as the distracted snooker commentators, incomprehensible quiz show Numberwang and the brilliant Chris Morris-esque character Raymond Terrific (who endeavours to solve the world's problems in approximately two minutes) are a delight to see again. But a few too many other sketches - and there are some new concepts thrown in - fizzle out, bereft of a killer punchline. Nonetheless, Mitchell and Webb remain a loveable pair on stage, and their inclination to steer clear of recurring characters and catchphrases means that they will always make for some worthwhile viewing.\n\nExtras: Trailer of forthcoming movie Magicians. Sharon Lougher\n\nThe Pervert's Guide To Cinema: Parts 1, 2, 3PGuide, 18, £21.99\n\n****\n\nDon't get too excited - this isn't a clip show of flesh shots. It's an intoxicating cinematic journey through the mind of Slovenian philosopher and psychoanalyst Slavoj Zizek directed by Sophie Fiennes. With an emphasis on the films of Hitchcock, Lynch and Tarkovsky, Zizek explores his fascinating ideas about sexuality, horror, consciousness and - most radically - the fabric of reality through some of the greatest films ever made, shot on original locations and replica sets. A highly animated, charismatic Freudian, he argues for example that Groucho, Chico and Harpo Marx are the Superego, Ego and Id. And whether standing over a toilet bowl like Gene Hackman in Coppola's The Conversation - an act he compares to watching movies - or watering Lynch's 'obscene' tulips, his presentation and theories are anything but dry. Extras: None. Nadine McBay"
