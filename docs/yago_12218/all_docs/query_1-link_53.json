        "text": "Megalomaniac (2023)\n\n“Martha and Félix are the children of the Butcher of Mons, a notorious Belgian serial killer from the 1990s. Unstable and riddled with insecurities, Martha lives vicariously through social media. Her brother, crushed by the family legacy, takes over their father’s killings. Harassed and violently assaulted at work, the docile Martha falls into madness and goes through the looking glass into the strange and terrifying world inhabited by her brother.”\n\nWhiskey Mountain Days (Short, 2023)\n\n“When a college student takes a production assistant job on an independent film shooting in Georgia, he unexpectedly ends up falling passionately in love with a much older woman on the crew; but her jealous, soon-to-be ex-husband—incensed that his wife is finding happiness with a younger man—will stop at nothing to break them up.”\n\nOldboy (2003)\n\n“Celebrating the 20th anniversary of Park Chan-Wook’s cinematic masterpiece, Oldboy will be released in theaters, restored and remastered in stunning 4K. After being mysteriously kidnapped and imprisoned with no human contact for fifteen years, Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is suddenly released without any explanation. In a twisted game of cat and mouse, he has only five days to retrace his past, track down his captors, and get his revenge. Oldboy, which remains a cult classic and has served as inspiration for auteurs for nearly two decades, will return to theaters for the first time in 20 years.”\n\nPassages (2023)\n\n“Celebrated filmmaker Ira Sachs (Love is Strange) makes a breathtaking return with PASSAGES, a fresh, honest and brutally funny take on messy, modern relationships, starring Franz Rogowski (Great Freedom), Ben Whishaw (Women Talking) and Adèle Exarchopoulos (Blue Is the Warmest Colour). Set in Paris, this seductive drama tells the story of Tomas (Rogowski) and Martin (Whishaw), a gay couple whose marriage is thrown into crisis when Tomas begins a passionate affair with Agathe (Exarchopoulos), a younger woman he meets after completing his latest film.”\n\nBeaten To Death (2023)\n\n“Beaten To Death unfolds after a desperate choice leads a man named Jack down a path that leaves him beaten and bruised as he struggles against man, nature and his own insanity. Stranded in the middle of nowhere after barely surviving a horrific assault, Jack encounters one local after another and quickly learns that a sick game of cat and mouse is about to begin. Battling the deranged country psychos and the harsh landscape, Jack must go to extreme lengths to survive.”\n\nGood Boy (2023)\n\n“Sigrid thinks she’s found the perfect match with the charming and handsome Christian, but there is one catch — he lives with a man who acts like his pet dog. Trying to be open-minded, Sigrid continues the relationship but begins to notice an insidious undertone to Chrsitian. Maybe ‘puppy play’ isn’t as innocent as it seems.”\n\nWe Kill For Love (2023)\n\n“We Kill for Love goes in search of the forgotten world of the direct-to-video erotic thriller, an American film genre that once dominated late night cable television and the shelves of neighborhood video stores. Balancing film art with scholarship, it pulls back the curtain to reveal the heart and soul of a forgotten and often maligned film movement.”\n\nKing on Screen (2023)\n\n“More than 60 of Stephen King’s novels have been adapted into films or television programs. King On Screen pulls back the curtain and offers an intimate sit-down with the filmmakers who brought King’s stories to life. Among those sitting down for interviews in the film, which world premiered at Fantastic Fest last year, are Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile), Mick Garris (ABC’s The Stand), Mike Flanagan (Gerald’s Game, Doctor Sleep) and director and special makeup effects titan Greg Nicotero (Creepshow TV series, Misery), and features clips from The Shining, Carrie, It, Misery and Stand By Me. A single documentary can’t cover every one of King’s books and adaptations, so this film takes the unique strategy of covering some of his “greatest hits” as well as some deep cuts for King fanatics. Featuring never-before-seen behind the scenes footage, this is a truly unique look at how the master of horror has enjoyed (and not) the adaptations of his work.”\n\nThe Adults (2023)\n\n“THE ADULTS follows Eric (Cera) as he returns home for a short visit and finds himself caught between reuniting with his sisters and chasing a victory with his old poker group. As the trip extends, Eric finds it increasingly difficult to avoid confrontations and revelations as his carefully constructed façade of his adulthood gives way to old childhood conflicts. While Maggie (Lillis) attempts to recreate the intimate world the three of them once shared, Eric and Rachel (Gross) are faced with the divide between their childhood selves and the adults they are now.”\n\nThe Eternal Memory (2023)\n\n“Augusto and Paulina have been together and in love for 25 years. Eight years ago, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, and his wife has since become his caretaker. As one of Chile’s most prominent cultural commentators and television presenters, Augusto is no stranger to building an archive of memory, having been responsible for that Herculean task following the Pinochet dictatorship and its systematic erasure of collective consciousness. Now he turns that work to his own life, trying to hold on to his identity with the help of his beloved. Day by day, the couple face this challenge head-on, adapting to the disruptions brought on by the taxing disease while relying on the tender affection and sense of humor shared between them that remains intact.”\n\nPast Lives (2023)\n\n“Nora and Hae Sung, two deeply connected childhood friends, are wrest apart after Nora’s family emigrates from South Korea. Two decades later, they are reunited in New York for one fateful week as they confront notions of destiny, love, and the choices that make a life, in this heartrending modern romance.”\n\nOur Body (2022)\n\n“French documentary titan Claire Simon observes the everyday operations of the gynecological ward in a public hospital in Paris. In the process, she questions what it means to live in a woman’s body, filming the diversity, singularity and beauty of patients in all stages of life. Through these many encounters, the specific fears, desires and struggles of these individuals become the health challenges we all face, even the filmmaker herself.”\n\nAfire (2023)\n\n“While vacationing by the Baltic Sea, writer Leon (Thomas Schubert) and photographer Felix (Langston Uibel) are surprised by the presence of Nadja (Paula Beer), a mysterious young woman staying as a guest at Felix’s family’s holiday home. Nadja distracts Leon from finishing his latest novel and with brutal honesty, forces him to confront his caustic temperament and self-absorption. As Nadja and Leon grow closer, an encroaching forest fire threatens the group and tensions escalate when a handsome lifeguard and Leon’s tight-lipped book editor also arrive. Christian Petzold’s acclaimed latest was the winner of the Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize at this year’s Berlin International Film Festival.”\n\nCondition of Return (2023)\n\nStarting on September 22nd/\n\nTickets on sale soon/\n\n“Eve Sullivan (AnnaLynne McCord) is arrested for committing a heinous crime. Shackled in a police station breakroom, she is questioned by psychoanalyst Dr. Donald Thomas (Dean Cain), who is tasked with determining her fitness to stand trial. In a contentious interview, Dr. Thomas persuades Eve to recount her troubling past as she slowly turns the tables, coaxing him into revealing secrets of his own and showing him they may be more alike than he thinks.”\n\nRetroformat Silent Films presents: Hula (1927, 16mm)\n\nShowing only October 8th/\n\n-with live music by Cliff Retallick/\n\nSunday afternoon at 2:00p/\n\nGeneral Admission: $15.00/\n\n“One of the finest and most charismatic actresses of the silent era, Clara Bow is in her element in Hula, her second film appearance directed by Victor Fleming (The Wizard of Oz, Gone With the Wind). They had previously worked together on the hit film Mantrap (1926) (when they began a torrid affair).Projected from a gorgeous 16mm print provided by the USC HMH Foundation Moving Image Archive and accompanied live by the brilliant Cliff Retallick, don’t miss this rare chance to see Clara Bow in Victor Fleming’s Hula, on the big screen of the Lumiere Cinema at the Music Hall!”\n\nSunday, September 24th, 2:30 p.m.\n\nA Door to The Sky\n\nA Door to the Sky (باب السماء مفتوح, Bab al-Samah Maftuh)\n\nDirected by Farida Benlyazid\n\nMorocco, 1989, 107 minutes\n\nIn Arabic with English Subtitles\n\nTickets on sale soon/\n\n“From the start of her career in the 1970s until 2003, Farida Ben Lyazid was the only woman in Morocco working as a professional filmmaker. Her debut feature offers a bold look at one woman’s spiritual and cultural awakening amid the shifting values of Moroccan society. Drawn back to her family home for a funeral, a young Franco-Moroccan woman starts to embrace the path of Sufism and transforms her home into a zawiya, a shelter and spiritual haven for women.”"
