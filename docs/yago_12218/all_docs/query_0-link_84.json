        "text": "This article analyses several notable examples of what the author calls the post-Yugoslav women’s cinema of trauma. These films made by women filmmakers challenge the standard tropes of war, as well as normative approaches to war cinema, by highlighting the intimate affective domain of experience, rather than large-scale narratives and collective emotions. The author focuses on the near-silent short and experimental works of Una Gunjak and Šejla Kamerić (both from Bosnia-Herzegovina), and suggests that they offer insightful formal and narrative ways of rethinking the question of what makes a war film, as well as what constitutes a woman’s experience of war. By arguing for a continued, strategic and locally specific use of the term women’s cinema, the author deploys feminist analytics towards inscribing these filmmakers’ work into the transnational flows of knowledge production about marginalized groups and non-Western geographies.\n\nExplores the dynamic intersection of feminism and film in the twenty-first century by highlighting the work of a new generation of women directors from around the world: Samira and Hana Makhmalbaf, Nadine Labaki, Zero Chou, Jasmila Zbanic, and Claudia Llosa, among others. The emergence of a globalized network of film festivals has enabled these young directors to make and circulate films that are changing the aesthetics and politics of art house cinema and challenging feminist genealogies. Extending formal analysis to the production and reception contexts of a variety of feature films, the book argues that women filmmakers are both implicated in and critique gendered concepts of authorship, taste, genre, national identity, and human rights.\n\nThis book draws on feminist philosophers Simone de Beauvoir, Luce Irigaray, Christine Battersby, Sonia Kruks, Iris Young and others to offer readings of some of the most important and memorable films directed by women in the 1990s and early twenty-first century. It suggests where feminist film studies might go 'after psychoanalysis', arguing that a feminist film-philosophy of an ethical female subjectivity can best assist women directors' increasingly subtle exploration of gender relations, desire and embodied action.\n\nThis piece reflects on the process of researching and producing S. Louisa Wei's documentary Golden Gate Girls (2014) and the significance of Esther Eng in contemporary feminist conceptualizations of women's filmmaking in the 1930s and 1940s. The goal of the documentary and the research is to place Eng back into Chinese and U.S. film histories, from which she has effectively been forgotten. The photo essay uses text and images to describe and reflect on that process, on the challenge of researching Eng through the images that remain, and on the ways in which feminist film history might take account of her.
