        "text": "Talking Screens, A Week In Chicago Film, June 28-July 4, 2024\n\nOpening before the Fourth: Yorgos Lanthimos’ trilogy of black-comedy cruelty, “Kinds Of Kindness“; “Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 1“; “A Quiet Place: Day One“; “Green Border“; “Janet Planet” and “Daddio.”\n\n“A Quiet Place: Day One” was previewed after our deadline. It’s what happened before what happened in “A Quiet Place,” for those who were wondering.\n\nSepia-steeped Telugu science-fiction “Kalki 2898 AD,” with Amitabh Bachchan, is a smash in India, and now playing in IMAX at City North, as well as at River East, Newcity and Showplace ICON. Hand-drawn “The Imaginary” from Studio Ponoc and animator Yoshiyuki Momose “is an unforgettable adventure of love, loss, and the healing power of imagination,” based on the novel of the same name by A.F. Harrold and illustrated by Emily Gravett. Opens on Fourth of July on Netflix.\n\nReviewed below: Agnieszka Holland’s “Green Border,” Annie Baker’s “Janet Planet,” and Christy Hall’s sit-and-take-it, all-in-a-night “Daddio.”\n\nWriter-director-star Kevin Costner’s three-hour farewell to “Yellowstone,” the largely self-financed “Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 1” was not previewed for Chicago reviewers, but here’s a picture of Costner holding a gun. “Chapter 2” is scheduled for August 16. The sixty-nine-year-old supernumerary is looking for the money to shoot “Chapter 3” and “Chapter 4.” Opens Thursday, June 27, in theaters.\n\nYorgos Lanthimos’ “Kinds Of Kindness” opens Thursday, including a 35mm engagement of the shot-on-film picture at the Music Box; our review is here.\n\nAgnieszka Holland’s fierce, fervent “Green Border” is a searing masterpiece of this moment, and the next one, and the next one, tackling immigration as one of the world’s most imperative topics while retaining the immense craft the seventy-five-year-old Polish great has demonstrated in her near-half-century as writer and director. (Her movies include “Europa Europa,” “Total Eclipse,” “The Secret Garden” and “Spoor.”) The “green border” between Belarus and Poland is a limbo for refugees from the Middle East and Africa who hope to make their way to the European Union, but are pawns of the Belarusian dictator Lukashenko. As Holland’s characters are steadily dehumanized by cynical calculation and violent predation, so are we as witnesses. It’s humanist work, but also a horror movie in the most vital sense: we should fear these things for others, for ourselves, in the fallen world of the twenty-first century, not only in histories of the 1940s and other times. (The black-and-white images ironically suggest the immediacy of now, not the documentation of the past.) Holland’s passion and compassion reign: fiery politics are infused with harrowing suffering. This panoply of moment-to-moment moral choices is in a league with movies like “Man of Iron” and “Man Of Marble” by her mentor, Andrzej Wajda: this is history written not in barbed wire, but upon the human face. “Green Border” opens Friday, June 28 at the Film Center.\n\n“Janet Planet” is a quietly, aggressively idiosyncratic debut feature by playwright Annie Baker, whose prior recognition includes a Pulitzer Prize, an Obie, a MacArthur Fellowship and a Guggenheim. It’s the simmering summer of 1991 in rural Western Massachusetts: Lacy is a watchful, uncommonly lucid eleven-year-old girl (Zoe Ziegler), watched over lackadaisically by her mother, Janet (always amiable but volatile Julianne Nicholson). Janet drifts through a trio of relationships, including a nearly mute Wayne (Will Patton), face lowered under a trucker cap, a blob of pink and grizzle and damage; resurfaced friend Regina (Sophie Okonedo), an aggressively controlling cult escapee; and Avi (Elias Koteas), that theatrical cult’s leader, a quiet, if insistent seducer. Lacy is absorbent in different spaces in the frame, listening to sad blather. I think there may be one scene we don’t see her endlessly attentive face: it may be Janet’s planet, but it’s Lacy’s world. Technically, “Janet Planet” works from huge, proscenium frames, often capturing figures tiny in distance, or through extreme close-ups: Janet’s lost-and-found earring of a beetle; a tick, burned: lips. Even the sun is so dazed, it’s too lazy to be dappling.\n\nBaker makes the mundane, or let’s say, the quotidian of this locale, hypnotically vital, partly through sound design that isolates insects and birds, nature’s lazy call. The pacing, like the characters, can chafe: high hippiedom persists in this corner of history. The pale 16mm images are summery and soft, like 1980s California and French erotica, but also Chantal Akerman’s earlier work. You know how brilliantly aware Baker is of her tools, as in the final scene, the first one filled with a montage of motion and faces a range of moods: it is a dance of community acceptance, and the witness of a watchful small girl, but it also arrives at the flickering instant of a daughter’s first empathetic moment for her still-untethered mother, nearing middle age—she gets it, Lacy does, and in a fraction of a second, it is over. The final shot is stunning elemental magic. “Janet Planet” opens Thursday, June 27 at River East, Newcity and Webster Place, and Friday, June 28 at the Film Center.\n\nWoman jumps into a cab at the airport: That’s “Daddio,” the Sean Penn-Dakota Johnson two-hander from filmmaker and playwright Christy Hall pits passenger Girlie (Johnson) against cabbie Will (Penn) in a journey from JFK into Hell’s Kitchen. (Yes, it’s a talkie.) Hall says she was fascinated as a child by HBO’s “Taxicab Confessions” and opens her 2017 Black List-placing script with the legend, “PLACE: New York City. Night.; TIME: Modern Day, 2015.” It’s a sweet pairing: both actors are excellent, and their rapport feels genuine. Penn finds depths in what could have been a well-worn working-class cabbie persona, as does Johnson in the “Modern Day” woman. Hall says her debut feature is “an exploration of what could happen when we’re not so quick to rush to judgment.” “Daddio” opens Thursday, June 27 at River East, Newcity, Webster Place, Evanston.\n\nREPERTORY & REVIVAL\n\nChicago Film Society hosts Marzieh Meshkini’s 2000 “The Day I Became a Woman” (35mm), a beautiful, episodic sequence of portraits of women in a less-repressed day of ever-more-repressive Iran. It’s not in distribution: this is a highly recommended occasion. NEIU, Wednesday, July 3, 7:30pm.\n\n“Serpico,” (35mm) is part of the ongoing Sidney Lumet centennial look-see. Film Center, Saturday, June 29, 3pm; Wednesday, July 3, 6pm. In anticipation of Ti West’s “MaXXXine,” opening on July 5 on 35mm, the Music Box is presenting the first parts of the trilogy, “Pearl” (July 1) and “X” (July 2-3) in the Music Box Garden. On Friday, July 5, Facets features a daytime double of “Pearl” and “X,” hosted by “Chicago’s very own La Gialloholique,” Stephanie Sack. “Pearl” at 12:30pm, with a 2:30pm “Murder Mingle” and “X” at 2:45pm, followed by its own Murder Mingle. Tickets ($22) here.\n\nDoc Films features Michael Curtiz’s “Yankee Doodle Dandy” (35mm) with the most volcanic of volcanic Jimmy Cagney, Friday, June 28, 5pm; and Spike Lee’s timeless “Do The Right Thing,” Friday, June 28, 8pm."
