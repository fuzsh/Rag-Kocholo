        "text": "Inspired by the events of International Women’s Day on the 8th March, me and my boyfriend, Tim, found ourselves reading an article by the British Film Institute called “10 Great Feminist Films”. After reading the list of ten, we decided to watch “The Day I Became A Woman” (2000), an Iranian film directed by Marzieh Meshkini.\n\n“The Day I Became A Woman” is made up of three episodes, or vignettes, each of which depict Iranian women at different stages in their lives. The film is set on the island of Kish in the Persian Gulf whose glittering seas and dusty open roads add an element of beauty and serenity to the film’s imagery. “The Day I Became A Woman” was temporarily banned upon its release in Iran for raising questions about the restrictive rules and limitations surrounding Iranian women, but went on to receive critical acclaim and to win awards at several international film festivals.\n\nThe film’s opening vignette tells the story of a young girl named Hava. It is the morning of Hava’s ninth birthday and according to Islamic law and tradition, this is the day where she must leave her childhood behind and enter womanhood (hence the film’s title). Hava’s mother and grandmother dress her in her new chador which she now must wear every time she leaves the house, and explain to her that she is not allowed to play with her best friend Hassan because she is too old to play with boys now.\n\nHava outwits her elders by pointing out that since she wasn’t born until noon, she still has time to go out and play with Hassan one last time. Her grandmother warily agrees, telling Hava that she must plant a stick in the sand to measure the time. When the shadow disappears, it is noon and therefore time for Hava to go home and to ‘become a woman’. Hava hurries outside to find Hassan, who is confined to his room until he finishes his homework. While she waits for him to come out, Hava skips down to the beach where she watches some boys who are busy crafting a makeshift boat. The boys convince Hava to give them her headscarf to use as a sail for their boat and in return they present her with a toy to play with. Meshkini uses this imagery to elude to Hava’s innocence as she clings on to her childhood; the headscarf holds no meaning to her yet, she just wants to play.\n\nAware that the shadows are getting shorter and that it must be approaching midday, Hava runs back to Hassan to spend the last golden moments of her childhood with him. Having not finished his homework, Hassan is still not allowed out but that doesn’t stop the two friends laughing together and sharing sweets through the bars of his window. Slowly but surely, the shadow of the stick in the sand fades away to nothing at all, and Hava’s mother and grandmother come to fetch her, bringing with them the chador that symbolises Hava’s new responsibilities and restrictions as an adult woman in Iran.\n\nThe film’s second segment focuses on a married woman, Ahoo, who is taking part in a female cycling race along the coastline. This section is essentially one long scene with all of the action and dialogue taking place while Ahoo is still peadalling furiously. Perhaps Meshkini chose to film the scene in this way to represent the seemingly endless struggle for gender equality or to highlight Ahoo’s ongoing determination to overcome the societal obligations which have been imposed on her simply because of her gender. In all honesty, I found this scene to drag a little bit. Sometimes dialogue was absent for a good four or five minutes and, with no change in setting, it was difficult to maintain interest at times. However, the occasional slowness of this scene was more than compensated for by Meshkini’s spectacular use of imagery. She uses wide shots to capture the blur of dozens of women dressed in their black chadors speeding across a long sandy road with the sparkling sea in the background and the warm sun overhead. Tim pointed out that Meshkini’s good use of tracking shots during this scene takes us into what would otherwise be distant action. These intimate angles allow us to feel more intensely what the characters are thinking, feeling and responding to.\n\nIn fact, what Ahoo is responding to is harassment from her husband who is riding beside her on a horse and trying to convince her to abandon the race and thus return to the societal expectations and domestic duties imposed on married women in Iran. When Ahoo pointedly refuses to listen to her husband, he threatens her with divorce and goes as far as summoning a mullah to divorce them on the spot. When this still fails to deter Ahoo, her husband brings along some of Ahoo’s other male family members to try to talk some sense into her. Eventually, Ahoo’s brothers manage to segregate her from the rest of the cycling group and ride their horses onto the path to block her way. It is incredibly sad that despite Ahoo’s resilience and determination, is is by sheer force of man that Ahoo is forced to retire from the race, and thus symbolically forced to give up her freedom and independence.\n\nThe final chapter of the film is my favourite of the three. This story centers around an elderly woman who has recently inherited a great deal of money. With her new found wealth, she decides to buy all of the things she’s always wanted but never had. And so begins her quest to buy a whole house worth’s full of material possessions. She enlists the help of young boys along the way to push her in her wheelchair and to lug her newly acquired furniture around after her. This leads to a very comical scene of the troop descending an escalator in a shopping centre; the elderly lady first in her wheelchair, followed by a seemingly endless trail of boys behind her carrying or wheeling along huge boxes. Eventually she instructs the boys to cart all of her new furniture and appliances to the seafront where they start unpacking the furniture and arranging it on the beach. The boys begin to tie her furniture to some makeshift rafts (echoing the one that Hava traded her scarf as a sail for in the first chapter of the film) and help the elderly woman clamber aboard and set off to an unknown destination. It seems that Meshkini is implying that this woman finally had both the freedom and the wealth to be able to purchase all of these desirable items which seem so synonymous with happiness and success, particularly in the Western world. Nonetheless, the film ends on a melancholy note as the old woman sails slowly out to sea, seemingly heading nowhere with all of these possessions that she has wanted for so long.\n\n“The Day I Became A Woman” is undoubtably one of the most interesting films I have ever seen. Meshkini’s decision to split the film into three parts gives us a clear insight into the triumphs and struggles of each individual character, allowing us to connect and sympathise with the characters on a personal level. However, by choosing to illustrate the stories of three different women, each of whom is at a completely different stage in her life, Meshkini shows that the fight for gender equality in Iran is a national, even global, one. Every woman is affected, no matter how old she is, and is striving for parity and independence.\n\nDespite the gravity of the issues raised, “The Day I Became A Woman” is not a gloomy film in the slightest. The idyllic imagery, relateable characters, and occasionally comical scenes give this film a light-hearted and uplifting feel. In fact, Meshkini leaves the film completely open to interpretation, unlike most Western films where the director’s message and the way he/she wants the spectators to feel about the subject comes across loud and clear. “The Day I Became A Woman” ends abruptly and ambiguously, with seemingly no underlying political message. Perhaps this was due to the fact that Meshkini knew that her film could be banned (as it indeed was) in Iran if it stirred up too many objections regarding gender equality. Or maybe she simply wanted to draw attention to the problems facing many Iranian women, and to let her spectators muse over that in their own time. Either way, it is surprisingly refreshing to watch a film that doesn’t dictate to you exactly how you are supposed to feel and react."
