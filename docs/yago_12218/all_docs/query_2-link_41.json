        "text": "Los Feliz 3 | 10th Anniversary!\n\n‘Tsai Ming-liang: An American Cinematheque Retrospective’\n\nThis program is made possible by the Spotlight Taiwan grant from the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of China (Taiwan), with additional support provided by the Taiwan Academy of the Economic and Cultural Office in Los Angeles.\n\nABOUT THE FILM:\n\nIn Mandarin with English subtitles.\n\nA single father makes his meager living holding up an advertising placard on a traffic island in the middle of a busy highway. His children wait out their days in supermarkets before they eat with their father and go to sleep in an abandoned building. As the father starts to come apart, a woman in the supermarket takes the children under her wing. There are real stray dogs to be fed in Tsai’s everyday apocalypse, but the title also refers to its principal characters, living the cruelest of existences on the ragged edges of the modern world.\n\nFORMAT: DCP\n\nDISTRIBUTOR: Cinema Guild\n\nCOUNTRY: Taiwan/France"
