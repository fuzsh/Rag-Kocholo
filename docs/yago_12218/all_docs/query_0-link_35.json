        "text": "- Movies\n\nThis week's movies are listed alphabetically by title. Shows reviewed are rated with a maximum of four stars. Shows with no stars have not been reviewed:\n\n15 Minutes *\n\nOvercome by the glitz and possibilities for fame in New York, two crazed and self-deluded Eastern European visitors decide to attract attention by stealing a video camera and making a movie of themselves commiting ghastly murders. They then seek to sell the tape to tabloid TV, and to eventually go free by claiming insanity. It's as bad as it sounds - exploitation masquerading as social criticism, despite Robert De Niro's presence as a homicide investigator. Also with Edward Burns, Kelsey Grammer, Melina Kanakaredes. R, for graphic violence, sexual situations, nudity, profanity. Two hours. (Steven Rosen)\n\n3,000 Miles to Graceland\n\nThis movie - about a gang, led by Kevin Costner, that plans to rob a casino while masquerading as Elvis impersonators - is without an ounce of human kindness. It is a sour and mean-spirited enterprise so desperate to please it tries to be a yucky comedy and a hard-boiled action picture at the same time. Also with Kurt Russell, Courteney Cox Arquette, Christian Slater, Kevin Pollak, David Arquette, Ice-T. R, for violence, sexuality, profanity. Two hours, 5 minutes. (Ebert)\n\nAlong Came A Spider **\n\nMorgan Freeman returns as Dr. Alex Cross, hero of \"Kiss the Girls,\" in another thriller where a mad criminal constructs a diabolical puzzle for him to solve. This time a senator's daughter is kidnapped, and he partners with a Secret Service agent (Monica Potter) in a plot filled with so many apparent and real loopholes that you'll walk out debating what really happened. Freeman is strong, and director Lee Tamahori's atmosphere is convincing, but the plot piles up implausibilities until we get dizzy. R, for violence, profanity. One hour, 45 minutes. (Ebert)\n\nThe Basket (not reviewed)\n\nTwo orphans from Germany go to live in a Pacific Northwest farming community, where they endure intolerance and find acceptance. With Peter Coyote, Karen Allen, Robert Karl Burkestars. PG. One hour, 44 minutes.\n\nBefore Night Falls ****\n\nIn his second movie, a moving and expressionistic biography of the late gay Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas, Julian Schnabel shows the boldly poetic sensibility one would expect from a painter turned director like himself. As Arenas, Oscar-nominated Spanish actor Javier Bardem gives the best performance in a year 2000 movie. This is the best American movie since \"American Beauty.\"\n\nAlso with Olivier Martinez, Andrea Di Stefano, Johnny Depp, Sean Penn. R, for nudity, sexual situations, violence, profanity. Two hours, 13 minutes. (Rosen)\n\nBilly Elliot *** 1/2\n\nA sensitive boy in an English coal-mining town finds escape through ballet. Newcomer Jamie Bell is outstanding as the boy; also superb are Gary Lewis as his harsh and no-nonsense (but fundamentally decent) dad and Julie Walters as the weary but sincere ballet instructor. R, for profanity. One hour, 44 minutes (Rosen)\n\nBlow *** 1/2\n\nA portrait of the America that drugs created, as seen through the eyes of the man who did his best to build a market for cocaine in America  the real-life figure George Jung. (He's in prison until 2015.) Johnny Depp, in a superb performance, plays Jung from his glory years as a young, hip New England refugee enjoying the highs of late-1960s California to his downfall as a paunchy, middle-aged cocaine dealer trying to escape his life's entrapment. Ted Demme directs with panache. Also with Ray Liotta, Penelope Cruz, Rachel Griffiths, Paul Reubens. R, for pervasive drug use, violence, profanity, sexual themes. Two hours. (Rosen)\n\nBlow Dry ** 1/2\n\nA beauty-salon operator (Natasha Richardson) learns she has terminal cancer and tries to make peace with her hairstylist exhusband (Alan Rickman) before she dies. Despite dollops of good-natured humor and sentiment, \"Blow Dry\" doesn't really gel until the halfway point. The aura of contrivance never quite fades, but the ensemble cast excels. Also with Rachael Leigh Cook, Josh Hartnett, Rachel Griffiths. R, for profanity, brief nudity. One hour, 33 minutes. (Kevin Thomas, Los Angeles Times)\n\nCarman: The Champion (not reviewed)\n\nA retired boxer working as a hotel security guard (played by contemporary-Christian singer Carman) is blackmailed into fighting the current champion. PG-13. Length not available.\n\nCast Away\n\nTom Hanks' resourceful acting (nominated for an Oscar), Robert Zemeckis' visceral yet thoughtful direction and an intelligent screenplay by William Broyles Jr. make this story of a man trapped for four years on a deserted island an exciting, satisfying film. But the love story that occurs after his return feels rote. Also with Helen Hunt as Hanks' girlfriend. PG-13, for intensity. Two hours, 20 minutes. (Rosen)\n\nThe Caveman's Valentine ***\n\nSamuel L. Jackson plays a street person who lives in a cave in a park. When a body is found frozen nearby, the police think they've explained the death, but the caveman suspects murder. And in an odyssey through the New York art world, the schizophrenic amateur detective tries to prove he's right. Some would find the character unplayable; Jackson makes him intriguing. Also with Colm Feore, Ann Magnuson, Damir Andrei, Aunjanue Ellis, Tamara Tunie, Peter MacNeill, Jay Rodan. R, for profanity, some violence and sexuality. One hour, 45 minutes. (Ebert)\n\nChocolat***\n\nOscar winner Juliette Binoche plays an enchantress who blows into a staid French village and awakens it with her magic chocolates. Johnny Depp is the hippie houseboat captain who also arrives in town, and Alfred Molina is the dour count who runs things. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom ( \"Cider House Rules''); nominated for the best-picture Oscar. Also with Johnny Depp, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina. PG-13. Two hours, one minute. (Ebert)\n\nCompany Man 1/2\n\nAn arch, awkward, ill-timed, forced political comedy set in 1959, when a mild-mannered grammar teacher (Douglas McGrath) finds himself mistakenly in the CIA and planning the Bay of Pigs. Good cast (Sigourney Weaver, John Turturro, Anthony LaPaglia, Denis Leary, Woody Allen, Alan Cumming and Ryan Phillippe), all wasted. PG-13, for sexual humor, drug content. One hour, 21 minutes. (Ebert)\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon ****\n\nEast meets West in director Ang Lee's rousing yet reflective \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\" a martial-arts adventure-fantasy film that also is an artful rumination on love and desire. Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh star as chivalrous, honorable ancient Chinese warriors so well-trained in their combat skills that they can virtually fly while pursuing their adversaries. Nominated for the best-picture Oscar. (Mandarin, with subtitles.) PG-13, for action sequences, sexual overtones. One hour, 59 minutes. (Rosen)\n\nThe Day I Became A Woman**\n\nIranian filmmaker Marzieh Meshkini's first film, about the status and desires of women in Iran, is really three short films that aren't connected all that well. Meshkini is the wife of one of Iran's top filmmakers, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, who wrote the three stories contained in this film. There is good cinematography here  a hallmark of Iranian film. In Farsi with subtitles. Not rated; nothing objectionable. One hour, 18 minutes. (Rosen)\n\nDown to Earth *\n\nChris Rock plays an untalented standup comic who is hit by a truck, goes to heaven, discovers a mistake is made and is allowed to return to Earth inside the body of an old white millionaire. Then he falls in love with a young African-American beauty (Regina King). She sees the geezer, but we see Chris Rock, which makes several scenes peculiar for all concerned. A retread of 1978's \"Heaven Can Wait.\"\n\nAlso with Mark Addy, Eugene Levy, Frankie Faison, Jennifer Coolidge, Greg Germann, Chazz Palminteri. PG13, for profanity, sexual humor, drug references. One hour, 27 minutes. (Ebert)\n\nEnemy at the Gates ***\n\nIn the ruins of Stalingrad in 1942, two snipers wage a deadly duel. The Russian (Jude Law) is a shepherd from the Urals. The Nazi (Ed Harris) is a Bavarian aristocrat. Both are loners and very good at their jobs. When the film focuses on their private war, it works with rare concentration. Less interesting is the romance involving Rachel Weisz, who attracts both Law's character and a Soviet propagandist (Joseph Fiennes) who has made him famous. Director Jean-Jacques Annaud's opening battle scenes deserve comparison to 'Saving Private Ryan.' With Bob Hoskins, Ron Perlman, Gabriel Marshall-Thomson, Eva Mattes, Matthias Habich. R, for graphic war violence, some sexuality. Two hours, 11 minutes. (Ebert)\n\nThe Family Man**\n\nNicolas Cage is a wealthy New York sin gle before an angel/avatar (Don Cheadle) turns him into a New Jersey family man with two cutesy kids and a job at his father-in-law's tire store. The film is more manipulative than heartfelt, but does go about its job with competence and some good scenes. With Tea Leoni as Cage's goofy wife. PG-13, for a threat of violence, sexual situations. Two hours, 4 minutes. (Rosen)\n\nFinding Forrester ** 1/2\n\nThis story of a reclusive writer (Sean Connery) who becomes the mentor for a genius African-American high school student from the Bronx (newcomer Rob Brown) tries to pass off its contrived concept as realism. Still, the acting is almost good enough to compensate. Also with Anna Paquin, F. Murray Abraham, Busta Rhymes. PG-13, for profanity, adult themes. Two hours, 13 minutes. (Rosen)\n\nGet Over It **\n\nA high school boy (Ben Foster), hoping to win back his girlfriend, tries out for a school play and is coached by a girl (Kirsten Dunst) who waits patiently for him to notice her. This formula teenage comedy may be halfhearted, but it's not entirely without heart, most of it supplied by its adorable central couple. The cast features pop stars Sisqo, Vitamin C and Coolio. Also with Martin Short, Swoosie Kurtz, Ed Begley Jr., Carmen Electra. PG-13 for profanity, sexual references, teen drinking. One hour, 30 minutes. (A.O. Scott, New York Times)\n\nHannibal * 1/2\n\nAt times, especially during the soon-tobe-infamous dinner with Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) and her treacherous, unfortunate superior (Ray Liotta), \"Hannibal\" plays like a kitschy, Mel Brooks-inspired parody of \"The Silence of the Lambs.\"\n\nOther times, it's fairly suspenseful. But Ridley Scott's goodlooking film ultimately falls victim to its source material - Thomas Harris' novel \"Hannibal\" is more gross-out silly than scary. R, for gore, violence, profanity. Two hours, 11 minutes. (Rosen)\n\nHeartbreakers *\n\nIf it were better written, this farce about a mother-daughter confidence team that gets money by marrying men and then sexually compromising them might have worked. As the mom, Sigourney Weaver is OK and wears some fetching outfits, but Jennifer Love Hewitt is terrible as the daughter. And Jason Lee is icky as the man who loves her. Displaying a relish for slapstick, Gene Hackman is fun as a repellent smoker whom Weaver wants to wed. Also with Ray Liotta, Anne Bancroft. PG-13, for adult sexual situations, profanity. Two hours, 3 minutes. (Rosen)\n\nThe House of Mirth ****\n\nBritish director-writer Terence Davies evocatively tackles Edith Wharton's 1905 novel about the cruelty of New York's wealthy as it pertains to a 29-year-old woman trying to marry into money for security's sake. In the tragic central role, Gillian Anderson looks spectacular and gives a carefully convincing performance. Also with Eric Stoltz, Dan Aykroyd, Eleanor Bron, Laura Linney, Elizabeth McGovern, Anthony LaPaglia. PG, for adult subject matter. Two hours, 24 minutes. (Rosen)\n\nIn the Mood for Love *** 1/3\n\nNeighbors in 1962 Hong Kong (Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Maggie Cheung) face their spouses' infidelity and their own desire for each other. A swooningly cinematic exploration of romantic longing, both restrained and sensual, luxuriating in color, texture and sound, this film raises its fascination with enveloping atmosphere and suppressed emotion to a ravishing, almost hypnotic level. PG, but contains adult themes. One 1 hour, 37 minutes. (Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times)\n\nJust Visiting ***\n\nA medieval knight and his vassal (Jean Reno, Christian Clavier) are transported through time to modern Chicago, where they meet the knight's distant descendant (Christina Applegate), a dead ringer for the medieval woman he loved. They're fish out of water, but filled with the chivalric spirit, in a broad and swaggering  and sweet  comedy that's an improvement on the 1993 French-language original. Also with Matthew Ross, Tara Reid, Bridgette Wilson-Sampras, John Aylward, George Plimpton, Malcolm McDowell. PG-13, for violence, crude humor. One hour, 28 minutes. (Ebert)\n\nLast Resort ** 1/2\n\nAbandoned by her English fianceé, a young Russian woman and her son are sent to a glorified British detention camp that once was a seaside resort but is now tawdry and disorienting. \"Last Resort\" is partly an allegory for the state of the refugee in the modern world, and partly a variation on \"The Prisoner.\" With Dina Korzun, Artiom Strelnikov, Paddy Considine, Lindsey Honey. Not rated. One hour, 13 minutes. (Rosen) Memento ****\n\nDirector-writer Christopher Nolan has found a way to reinvigorate the seemingly worn-out noir style  by playing it backwards. A fine Guy Pearce stars as a man with short-term memory loss, haunted by vague memories of his wife's murder, who seeks revenge on the killer even though he forgets everything he knows every few minutes. As he struggles to piece together his past, his story is shown to us in reverse, so make sure you're seated at the critical beginning. Also with CarrieAnne Moss, Joe Pantoliano. R, for adult subject matter, violence, language. One hour, 54 minutes. (Rosen)\n\nMeet the Parents*** 1/2\n\nThis hilarious, rousingly acted tale of a male nurse (Ben Stiller) meeting his girlfriend's disapproving father (Robert De Niro) could have been just another generic if amusing Hollywood confection, but the filmmakers gambled by giving it some cultural specificity. PG-13, for profanity, violence. One hour, 48 minutes. (Rosen)\n\nThe Mexican ** 1/2\n\nThis is yet another Tarantino-esque caper film mixing violence with humor, profanity with witty repartee. But while it's not successful overall, it almost is - because Brad Pitt shows comedic charm as a goofy screw-up sent to Mexico by a mob boss to retrieve a valuable but cursed gun. Although it co-stars Julia Roberts, this isn't much of a romance - she and Pitt have only a few scenes together. She spends more time with James Gandolfini (of \"The Sopranos''), who plays a kidnapper. Also with Gene Hackman, Bob Balaban, J.K. Simmons, David Krumholtz, Richard Coca, Michael Cerveris. R, for violence, profanity. Two hours, three minutes. (Rosen)\n\nMe You Them ***\n\nA woman (Regina Case») in a dusty corner of northeastern Brazil collects lovers and children. Inspired by a true story, \"Me You Them\" is an improbable me»lange of rural neorealism, soap opera and sexual comedy. Its simple narrative of romantic complication unfolds gracefully and easily. Andrucha Waddington's direction is as seductive and sinuous as Gilberto Gil's score. (Portuguese, with subtitles.) Also with Lima Duarte, Stenio Garcia. PG-13, for sexual situations. One hour, 43 minutes. (A.O. Scott, New York Times)\n\nMiss Congeniality **\n\nSandra Bullock clomps around as a tomboy FBI agent until she's assigned to go undercover as a beauty queen. A dreary sitcom mishmash, made somewhat less dreary by Bullock's charm. With Michael Caine, Candice Bergen, Benjamin Bratt, William Shatner. PG-13. One hour, 40 minutes. (Ebert)\n\nMonkeybone\n\nBrendan Fraser is a cartoonist who goes into a coma after an accident and finds himself trapped in Downtown, a nightmare world ruled by Death (Whoopi Goldberg) and populated by bizarre creatures, including his own invention, the obnoxious Monkeybone. Bridget Fonda is the girlfriend who thinks he's trapped in a \"nightmare loop\" and tries to rescue him. The movie labors hard, the special effects are admirable, yet the movie never takes off. Also with Chris Kattan, David Foley, John Turturro. PG-13, for crude humor, nudity. One hour, 27 minutes. (Ebert)\n\nO Brother, Where Art Thou?*** 1/2\n\nThe Coen brothers - writer/director Joel and writer/producer Ethan - find a sublime and sometimes-elegiac edge for their frighteningly comic, bizarrely screwball \"adaptation\" of \"The Odyssey,\" set in Depression-era Mississippi. They get a marvelously funny and likable performance from George Clooney, and John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as his fellow-prison-escapee pals are funny. PG13, for profanity, violence, cruelty to animals. One hour, 43 minutes (Rosen) Pollock ***\n\nDirecting his first film, Ed Harris makes a relatively straightforward biography of abstract-expressionist painter Jackson Pollock, America's first \"art star.\"\n\nThere's an inevitability to the way his tragic, alcoholic life plays out, but Harris is terrific as Pollock, as is Marcia Gay Harden as his supportive wife. Both have received Oscar nominations for their work. Lisa Rinzler's cinematography also is superb - she and Harris are unafraid to show Pollock's art. Also with Amy Madigan, Jeffrey Tambor. R, for sexual situations, violence, profanity. Two hours, 2 minutes. (Rosen)\n\nRecess: School's Out ** 1/2\n\nAnimated; based on the Disney TV cartoon. An evil educator (voiced by James Woods) wants to use a secret ray to move the moon, bring about a new ice age and abolish summer vacation. His opponents include students at Third Street School and Principal Prickly (Dabney Coleman). Aimed at the same audience as \"Rugrats in Paris''; recommended for kids up to 10 or 11, but without much appeal for parents. Also featuring voices by Robert Goulet, Andy Lawrence, Rickey D'Shon Collins, Jason Davis, Ashley Johnson, Courtland Mead, Pam Segall, April Winchell. G. One hour, 24 minutes. (Ebert)\n\nSave the Last Dance* 1/2\n\nThis is intended to be a feel-good teen story, centered on the aspirations of a budding white ballet student sent to live with her offbeat dad after her mother's death. Her involvement with a black fellow student leads her to rediscover her dance dream, but the dance sequences are so unlikely that the movie is not convincing. PG-13. One hour, 57 minutes (Glenn Giffin)\n\nSay It Isn't So No stars\n\nA bargain-basement, 10th-generation carbon copy of a Farrelly Brothers comedy, this movie flaunts its crude attempts at humor until you want to beat it with a baseball bat and put it out of its (and your) misery. The Farrellys, of \"There's Something About Mary\" fame, produced but neither wrote nor directed \"Say It Isn't So,\" which stars Heather Graham and Chris Klein in relentlessly bad performances. Sally Field, apparently sent to purgatory for directing \"Beautiful,\" also appears. Also with Orlando Jones, Richard Jenkins. R, for crude humor, brief nudity, drug references, profanity. One hour, 33 minutes. (Rosen)\n\nSee Spot Run * 1/2\n\nA dog trained for the FBI's canine corps is chased by vengeful mobsters, and falls into the hands of a small boy (Angus T. Jones) and his babysitter (David Arquette), who has a crush on the boy's mom (Leslie Bibb). Like most stories with Spot in the title, this one is pitched at a first-grade level, with lots of jokes involving animal waste, flatulence, etc. Also with Michael Clarke Duncan, Joe Viterelli, Steven R. Schirripa, Anthony Anderson, Paul Sorvino. PG, for crude humor, profanity, comic violence. One hour, 34 minutes. (Ebert)\n\nShadow of the Vampire ***\n\nA conceptual delight for film buffs, if too clever for its own believability, E. Elias Merhige's \"Shadow of the Vampire\" pretends that (real-life) German director F.W. Murnau hired a real vampire to play the (real-life) actor playing a vampire in his 1922 silent classic \"Nosferatu.\" As Murnau, John Malkovich is too much of a shouting bossy-boots, but as the vampire, Willem Dafoe gives a giddily happy and sometimes chilling performance under effectively grotesque heavy makeup. Also with Udo Kier, Cary Elwes, Catherine McCormack, Eddie Izzard. R, for gore, nudity, scenes of drug and alcohol use. One hour, 29 minutes. (Rosen)\n\nSnatch**\n\nHipness grows as old and unfunny as a hip-replacement operation during the course of British writer-director Guy Ritchie's in-your-face caper film, which mixes violence and dirty language with zaniness and slash-and-burn cinematic technique. This tale of a diamond heist gone wrong grows tired and predictable, although a charming performance by Brad Pitt as an Irish-gypsy boxer helps. Also with Benicio Del Toro, Dennis Farina, Vinnie Jones. R, for strong violence, profanity, some nudity. One hour, 43 minutes. (Rosen)\n\nSomeone Like You*\n\nA romantic comedy that's neither romantic nor funny, \"Someone Like You\" concerns a woman who concocts a theory comparing men to cows to explain the way her boyfriend suddenly dumps her. Ashley Judd is all exaggerated mannerisms; Greg Kinnear is wan and passive as the boyfriend and Hugh Jackman is handsome but uncharismatic as the hunky friend to whom she is attracted. The best scenes involve bovines. Also with Marisa Tomei, Ellen Barkin. PG-13, for sexual content. One hour, 33 minutes. (Rosen)\n\nSpy Kids*** 1/2\n\nThis film is a family treasure, giddy with the joy of its invention. It's an exuberant, colorful extravaganza, wall-to-wall with wildly original sets and visual gimmicks, and smart enough to escape the kid's-film category and play in the mainstream. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino play enemy spies who fall in love and marry. When they're kidnapped by a megalomaniac (Alan Cumming), it's up to their kids (Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara) to rescue them, in a colorful, cheerful, upbeat, inventive movie written and directed by Robert Rodriguez. Not too scary for kids, and smart and funny enough for their parents. Also with Teri Hatcher, Tony Shalhoub, Cheech Marin. PG, for action. One hour, 30 minutes. (Ebert) Thirteen Days***\n\nThis film has an old-fashioned prosaism compared to flashy and stylish \"serious\" movies like \"Three Kings\" or \"Traffic.\"\n\nBut it isn't staid or dull because the subject matter - the 1962 Cuban missile crisis and how we escaped it without destroying the world - is so involving. The film is helped by a fresh performance by Bruce Greenwood as President John F. Kennedy. Steven Culp is effective as Robert Kennedy and Kevin Costner provides a sturdy center as adviser Kenneth O'Donnell. PG-13, for tension. Two hours, 15 minutes (Rosen)\n\nTomcatsno stars\n\nFour guys pay into a mutual fund, and the last one who is still a bachelor gets to collect. It's amazing that any of them ever marry; the guys are engulfed by beautiful females, but the plot humiliates them, as if girls were a fearsome plague. Here is a comedy positioned outside the normal range of human response. With Jerry O'Connell, Jake Busey, Shannon Elizabeth. R, for strong sexual content, profanity. One hour, 32 minutes. (Ebert) Too Much Sleep** 1/2 1/2\n\nA young security guard (Marc Palmieri) loses his gun on a city bus, and takes off in search of it through aging New Jersey suburbs. It's a deadpan, offbeat comedy of suburban manners, enriched by a sense of melancholy and a genuine affection for the quiet eccentricities of its characters. But the movie suffers from stylistic formalism; the vignettes don't interconnect in a powerful way. Also with Pasquale Gaeta, Nicol Zanzarella, Judy Sabo Podinker, Philip Galinksy. Unrated; includes adult language and subjects. One hour, 26 minutes. (Rosen)\n\nTraffic*** 1/2\n\nA powerfully visceral film about America's drug wars shows that director Steven Soderbergh can combine several plots and locations into a seamlessly energetic and focused drama. The large cast includes Michael Douglas as a determined federal anti-drug czar whose own daughter has a drug problem, Benicio Del Toro as a dedicated Tijuana cop, Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman as DEA agents, and Catherine Zeta-Jones as a pregnant wife of a drug lord. Nominated for the best-picture Oscar. R, for violence, sexual situations, profanity, drug use, adult subject matter. 2 hours, 27 minutes. (Rosen)\n\nVertical Limit\n\nA mountain-climbing expedition on a dangerous peak goes terribly wrong because of greed and avarice on the part of a climber - and Chris O'Donnell must organize an emergency rescue of his sister (Robin Tunney), trapped in an ice cavern near the summit. Much of the outdoor cinematography is smashingly exciting, but the stereotypical characters will leave you cold. Also with Bill Paxton, Scott Glenn, Izabella Scorupco, Stuart Wilson. PG-13, for violence, profanity. Two hours, 6 minutes. (Rosen)\n\nWhen Brendan Met Trudy\n\nA breezy little picture with just enough meat on its bones to send moviegoers off feeling they got something more than yet another quirky romance. How the mismatched title characters hook up feels forced, but once they become a couple, Peter McDonald and Flora Montgomery are endearing and natural together. Written by Irish novelist Roddy Doyle ( \"The Commitments''). Not rated, but with adult humor, sexual situations. One hour, 34 minutes. (David Germain, AP)\n\nWhere's Marlowe? (Not reviewed)\n\nA satirical tale of film-school students (Mos Def, John Livingston) who tail private investigators (Miguel Ferrer, Allison Dean) for a documentary project and stumble across an unsolved case. R, for profanity, violence, adult situations. One hour, 39 minutes.\n\nThe Widow of St. Pierre*** 1/2\n\nIn a remote fishing island near Newfoundland in 1850, a defiantly modernist military captain (Daniel Auteuil) and his lonely, idealistic wife (Juliette Binoche) try to keep their passion alive and also act honorably to a condemned man (Emir Kusturica) awaiting the arrival of a guillotine. Quietly profound and deeply tragic, this is a thoughtful and emotional film from French director Patrice Leconte. R, for violence, sexual situations, adult subject matter. One hour, 48 minutes. (Rosen)\n\nYou Can Count On Me*** 1/2\n\nAn adult sister and brother (played magnificently by the Oscar-nominated Laura Linney and Mark Ruffalo) struggle to lead meaningful, rewarding lives despite the scars left from being orphaned as children. The brother, a troubled drifter, attempts to befriend his sister's young son (Rory Culkin); she partakes in an affair with her married, troublesome boss (Matthew Broderick). R, for profanity. One hour, 51 minutes. (Rosen)\n\nIMAX\n\nAdventures in Wild California\n\nDenver Museum of Nature & Science, 2001 Colorado Blvd. 303-322-7009.
