        "text": "In the early 2000s, Suresh Sambandam, a software professional in Bengaluru, embarked on a journey that would not only defy conventional wisdom but also reshape the landscape of software development. Working at HP (Hewlett-Packard), Sambandam delved into the emerging field of rule-based computing, an early form of what we now recognize as artificial intelligence. Despite his lack of formal technical training, his relentless curiosity and forward-thinking vision laid the groundwork for a remarkable entrepreneurial journey.\n\n“It was the crude version of artificial intelligence,” Sambandam recalls. He worked on rule engines designed to simplify business rule definitions, only to find these tools complex and dependent on software engineers. This insight sparked a vision: creating an accessible, user-friendly solution that bridged the gap between business users and software developers.\n\nIn 2003, driven by this vision, Sambandam launched Orangescape, a visual-based platform-as-a-service (PaaS). His revolutionary idea aimed to empower individuals without programming skills to build applications for their businesses through simple drag-and-drop interfaces. This concept is poised to dominate global development today, contributing nearly 70 percent by 2026, which is strange since it was virtually unheard of in the early 2000s. The initial failure of Orangescape’s PaaS did not deter Sambandam; instead, it spurred him to refine his approach. This persistence led to the birth of Kissflow.\n\nThe Birth of Kissflow: Overcoming Early Challenges\n\nSambandam envisioned Kissflow as a rule engine devoid of the complexities of its predecessors. He focused on creating a platform with all the necessary scaffolding, enabling business users to develop software without extensive programming knowledge. This seemingly simple idea held the potential to revolutionize business rule implementation and management. However, his journey to success is full of challenges.\n\n“There were days I would wonder if we could make the monthly salaries. We had left our well-paying jobs to start the company. We were sure of the problem statement we had. However, the idea of raising funding or starting a startup didn’t exist. I had to sell a few of my assets to keep the company afloat in those early days,” Sambandam recollected.\n\nA turning point came when Accenture acquired the company Sambandam was consulting for but did not retain the employees. Seizing the opportunity, Sambandam and his team began offering high-rate consulting services to generate initial funds. Charging $100 per hour (an impressive amount in India in 2013), they managed to raise half a million dollars in nine months, focusing primarily on international markets.\n\n“I was sure there was a market for our product, but more demand in the US kept us going. As a result, we were able to raise half a million dollars. This capital was crucial in kickstarting our venture,” Sambandam said.\n\nTechnological Evolution and Global Expansion\n\nThe initial product was built on a client-server architecture with a Silverlight front end, but this setup quickly proved unscalable. Recognizing the need for a more robust solution, the team pivoted to a cloud architecture, a move that was not without its challenges but essential for scalability and reliability. Continuous innovation led to the adoption of a Kubernetes-based microservices architecture, significantly enhancing Kissflow’s performance.\n\nCustomer feedback played a crucial role in Kissflow’s development. “The cloud-based approach meant that any changes made to the product would immediately impact all customers, necessitating continuous improvement. I remember an incident where a developer deleted a production database by mistake, causing significant disruption. This experience underscored the importance of robust processes and effective communication with customers,” said Sambandam.\n\nFrom the outset, Kissflow targeted a global market. Initially reaching customers in over 60 countries through digital marketing and online sales, the company soon established a physical presence in key markets, including the Philippines, the US, and the Middle East. In particular, the Middle East was a priority due to its relatively high demand and respect for Indian tech talent and cultural proximity to India. Kissflow’s office in Dubai Internet City received a positive response, and the company plans to double its presence there next year.\n\nThe Future: AI Integration and Continuous Innovation\n\nSambandam is particularly excited about the transformative potential of integrating generative AI capabilities into Kissflow. “The integration of Generative AI capabilities can help revolutionize how businesses build and use software, allowing everyone to access sophisticated applications. The company’s focus on citizen development and continuous innovation positions Kissflow as a key player in the next wave of digital transformation,” he said.\n\nThe journey of Kissflow is a testament to the power of perseverance, innovation, and a clear vision. Despite numerous challenges and uncertainties, Suresh Sambandam’s unwavering commitment to his vision has propelled Kissflow to the forefront of the no-code, low-code revolution. As the company continues to grow and evolve, it remains poised to make a significant impact on the global software development landscape, driving the next wave of digital transformation.\n\nConclusion\n\nAgainst all odds, Suresh Sambandam’s journey with Kissflow showcases the impact of resilience and innovation in the tech industry. From the early struggles of Orangescape to the global success of Kissflow, Sambandam’s story is a beacon of inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs. His relentless pursuit of a user-friendly, scalable solution has not only revolutionized business rule implementation but also set the stage for future advancements in software development. With continuous innovation and a focus on global markets, Kissflow is well-positioned to lead the next era of digital transformation, making sophisticated technology accessible to all."
