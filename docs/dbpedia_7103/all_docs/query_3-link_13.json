        "text": "Simon Sinek’s principle of defining the “Why” of any act led me to think deeper on the writing workshops we have conducted in our company (OrangeScape). The following is an attempt to articulate the reasons that led us on this journey and not focus on the logistics or outcomes of it primarily.\n\nFor a technology company this (ie, conducting writing workshops) might seem like a strange thing. Encouraging people to write is one thing, but to actually invest two days in a workshop followed by a 100 day challenge seemed a little excessive.\n\nWe’ve made this conscious and maybe even unorthodox investment as an organization because we want to build clarity and articulation skills among our people. Writing is a tool that brings out additional dimensions as compared to speaking, for example. In writing, you must acquire and organize knowledge before putting it down. A conscious choice has to be made in the logic employed and vocabulary used to maximize clarity since there’s no dialogue. Writing therefore turns out to be a very effective and multifaceted learning tool.\n\nConducting this as 2 day residential workshop also provided our people with a break from work and an opportunity to bond across teams. The 100 day writing challenge that followed gave the participants an opportunity to practice as a group, and build a sense of accomplishment that served to enhance their personal branding with new dimensions of their personality coming to light.\n\nWhat started as a simple idea to federate content for our “Behind the Peel” company blog has blossomed into something memorable. We’ve also realized that this is the best way to share our culture. When someone sees our people writing poems, stories, and individual development on our official platform, any reader from outside can directly infer the company culture."
