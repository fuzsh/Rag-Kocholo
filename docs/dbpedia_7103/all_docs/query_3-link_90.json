        "text": "1. Introduction This research aims to investigate the impact of electronic government (e-government) and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) on Human Development (Education, Health and Welfare), based on a comparative study among Ethiopia, Kenya and Japan. Governments in the developed countries often utilize e-government and ICT in their organizations to deliver better quality of service and enhance efficiency and transparency. In Africa, e-government adoption and ICT infrastructure development and service delivery remain in early stages and governments are reluctant to change this situation as they focus on other pressing development challenges such as disease, poverty and low level literacy. This research, will thus, employ a qualitative research method based on the case studies of three countries through website content analysis, reviewing reports from organizations (such as the World Bank, the United Nations (UN), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)) and review of related literatures from other authors. This research will help to answer the question: What impact e-government and ICT have on Human Development in Ethiopia and Kenya as compared to developed countries such as Japan? The thesis is organized in five chapters. Chapter One focuses on the introduction, background information, objective and Methodology of the thesis. Chapter Two presents reviews of prior literatures, documents, reports and website content analysis. Chapter Three covers the impact analysis and case study of e-government and ICT in Ethiopia, Kenya and Japan. Chapter Four presents the findings of the qualitative comparative study. Chapter Five is about the conclusion, policy implications and recommendations for future works. 2. Literature Review ICT and e-government have been advancing very fast and were studied extensively in the past few decades. The impact of both ICT and e-government covered many different aspects such as social, cultural, technological, developmental and governance policy. Many individuals, studying e-government (e.g., Adam 2010; Al-Hujran, Al-Dalahmeh and Aloudat 2011; Bertot, Jaeger and Grimes 2010; Chekol 2010; Rosissa and Demissie 2010; Schuppan 2009), focused mainly on government service delivery and infrastructure development, while organizations (such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 2003, 2005; and the United Nations (UN) 2008, 2010, 2012 and the World Bank n.d.) worked on policy implications; finding ways to standardize the service delivery across the governments of different countries. These organizations, established institutions dedicated to study ICT and e-government, citing the global impact on people around the world. According to the OECD, the UN and the World Bank, democratic governance can be achieved through the implementation of e-government and utilization of ICT in government services. However, Schuppan (2011) and the Working Group on e-Government in Developing World (2002) argued that wider contexts such as administrative, social and infrastructure issues should be considered. If it is not well conceived and appropriately implemented, e-government initiatives may waste resources by failing to deliver clean and useful services. Furthermore, nations might fail to deliver sustainable development, adequate socioeconomic progress in education, health and welfare increasing public frustration at the governments. 3. Case Study and Impact Analysis In the case of Ethiopia, bureaucratic government policy and regulatory environment coupled with the slow technology acceptance behavior of the society, make adoption of ICT for public sector governance and socioeconomic benefits challenging. Despite the initiatives from the government to implement e-government service delivery for the citizens, the low human development in the country poses the challenge to realize such plans. In Kenya, utilizing ICT for public sector governance (e-government and e-services), education, health and economic development has seen significant progress. In Japan, ICT is the core constituent of its economy, significantly contributing both to the services and the industry sectors. The country well understood the significance of utilizing ICT “as a driving engine” in public sector governance, economic growth and social services such as education and health. Sequences of policies and strategies have been developed and implemented by designated administrative entities of the government to enhance utilization of ICT and benefit its citizens since 2000. 4. Findings and Discussion Needless to say, there exists a significant amount of evidence and information regarding the development and utilization of ICT in the countries to improve the social and economic status of people. The findings of this research show the existence of considerable level of impact on improving quality of education, healthcare services and living standard in both the developed and developing countries. The e-government and ICT infrastructure development in these countries is at different stages. While Japan has reached its advanced level of Infrastructure development, Kenya is progressing well in a positive direction. However, the situation in Ethiopia is different as it remains monopolized by the incumbent in the country. 5. Conclusion and Recommendations ICT infrastructure development and e-government are not the only factors affecting the impact on Human Development. A well developed ICT infrastructure has to be accompanied by proper policies and strategies to make a sound and effective utilization for public sector administration, social and economic benefits. This research found that there exists complex, varying and conditional impact on Human Development resulting from ICT infrastructure development and its utilization for public sector governance (e-government) and social (education and health) and economy (welfare) benefits. Similarly, a liberal telecom sector encouraging private investment has a positive relationship with ICT infrastructure development. There is also a relationship between the human development trends and the enactment of policies and strategies to utilize ICT for public administration, social and economic benefits."
