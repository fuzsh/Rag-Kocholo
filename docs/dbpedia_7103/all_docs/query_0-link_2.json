        "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. – September 25, 2012 – Kissflow is the first workflow creation app specifically built for Google Apps™. It offers customers a simple and efficient way to automate workflows around their existing email user base.\n\nLast month, OrangeScape announced that it has added Kissflow to the Google Apps Marketplace™, Google’s online storefront for Google Apps products and services. Within the first month since the marketplace launch, Kissflow has emerged as the second most-installed workflow app in theworkflow category.\n\nWorkflow automation is a common need for companies with 100+ users. The Google Apps marketplace serves that need by listing popular workflow products for 3 years now. We are excited to see Kissflow leap to the top of that list in the first month itself. We are thankful for the support from our users. This traction proves the need for such an exclusive workflow product for Google Apps., said Mani Doraisamy, Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer of OrangeScape.\n\nAs a Google Apps-specific product, we will create the best possible Google workflow in Kissflow Workflow. We want customers to realize workflow automation benefits from day one, without spending time and money on Google Apps integration.\n\nWorkflow with Google Docs integration\n\nDocument management is one of the common use cases of the workflow. Companies use workflows to route documents from one person to another for document review, approvals, and sign-offs.\n\nWith today’s product release, Kissflow has enhanced document management capability with Google Drive integration. Users can now upload documents directly in Kissflow, instead of uploading it to Google Drive and then attaching it to workflow requests.\n\nAbout OrangeScape\n\nOrangeScape is a leading Platform as a Service (PaaS) company. Its PaaS solution enables the creation of cloud-based, SaaS or on-premise business applications. OrangeScape also offers Kissflow, the first workflow creation app specifically for Google Apps™. With Kissflow, businesses can easily create HR and business approval workflow processes in a few simple steps.\n\nOrangeScape has secured $1M in an angel bridge round of venture funding. The lead investor is former CEO of Yahoo® India, Sharad Sharma. Other investors include Pramod Bhasin (former chairman, NASSCOM® and CEO of Genpact®); Linda Bernardi (CEO StraTerra Partners); Venkat Raju; and Raman Roy (CEO of Quattro Global Services).\n\nThe company maintains offices in Mountain View, Calif. and Chennai, India.\n\nNote: Whether noted or not, references to certain words may be trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective owners."
