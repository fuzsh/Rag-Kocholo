        "text": "Master Sharvan Kumaran & Master Sanjay Kumaran\n\nCan anyone think of becoming a CEO and a president of a company at the tender age of 10 and 12? Surprisingly, the young brothers, Sanjay Kumaran of class VI and Shravan Kumaran of class VIII, have achieved the feat. They founded Go Dimensions out of their passion in the last month of 2011 but within two months their first mobile application \"Catch me Cop\" was on display at Apple’s App Store and within next few weeks it received attention of cnet.com, one of the most popular websites for tech news, reviews and listings of popular apps. As of now their apps have witnessed more than 10,000 downloads across the world. Some of their more popular applications include Alphabets Board (This App is for kids to Learn alphabets), Color Pallette (This App is to Learn various colors for kids) and prayer planet (the game is for religious prayers of different communities). The brothers are authoring a book on dinosaur destination of dooms. They want to donate 15 per cent of the income to charity so that the company can bring a change in global economic structure.\n\nDr.G Nammalvar\n\nBorn in an agriculturist family in Thanjavur, Nammalvar got himself a BSc in agriculture from Annamalai University. After the drought of 1983 in many parts of Tamilnadu and the subsequent floods, Nammalvar realised that absence of trees was the cause of both disasters. He interacted with thousands of disillusioned farmers. Nammalvar was associated with the setting up of Low External Input Sustainable Agriculture (leisa) in 10 districts with 3000 members. His other brainchild is Kudumbam (family)' a 20-year-old farm in Pudukkottai where a forest was raised from barren land in a few years. Nammalvar combines physical activism with writing. He has authored six books in Tamil and of late' popular Tamil magazine Kumudam has been carrying a weekly feature by him.\n\nMs.Aarti C Rajaratnam\n\nShe has a Masters in Clinical Psychology with specialization in Childhood and Adolescent Mental Health from the University of Delhi, South Campus.

From chowmein that was possibly alive, to lodges that resembled torture chambers; from warm sunsets on the Maharashtrian coast to frostbite on the Khardung La; from curious children in school uniforms to helpful aunties by roadside dhabas; from supporters who urged him on in goodwill to locals who mistook him for a French tourist with impeccable Hindi — he’s seen it all through 6,000 odd km on a cycle from Leh to Kanyakumari and back to his hometown, Bangalore. The idea was conceived over chai in 2011 with Rishabh Malhotra, a colleague who cycled to office as well. In the next 100 days, they quit their advertising jobs, charted a vague route through mountains, valleys, forests and beaches, researched histories of similarly ambitious cyclists, saved up, rode daily and drank a lot more chai. On August 19, 2012, they found themselves climbing the world’s highest motorable pass (Khardung La), short of breath. After a week of no network, nervous excitement and acclimatisation, they began their journey south. The people Naveed met along the way are the highlights of his journey. “At pit stops, strangers would invite us home, hug us like we were their lost brothers, feed us, make sure we had absolutely everything we needed and take no money from us in return,” says Naveed. It’s the small gestures that made the difference. In a Tamil Nadu town, for instance, a passerby directed them to a motel for the night and rode beside them all the way so that his bike’s headlamp could light their cycles’ path."
