        "text": "Orange Building Solutions are the specialist building and maintenance division of the Orange Property Improvement Group. We are a reliable family run business with 35 years experience in this industry.\n\nWe provide expertise in all aspects of property improvements across Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire. Our work is carried out to a high quality standard. We ensure the site is kept clean, tidy and safe throughout.\n\nStuart (Director) has extensive knowledge of the construction industry having started working with his Project Manager father at the age of 16.\n\nAt the age of 19 Stuart was given a project to manage and started his Further Education on a day release and evening course at Luton College. Within 7 years he was Project Managing the Company’s largest project (£3.5 million scheme in Saffron Walden) and had gained ONC, HNC and CIOB qualifications.\n\nStuart then moved to Wates Construction London where he was a Project Manager on various contracts, including Listed Buildings and Offices, along with Design and Build.\n\nDesigning and building a new Head Office and storage facilities for Ancon in Hemel Hempstead was the next challenge, which was another successful project.\n\nAnchor Housing required a new scheme in Westminster to house and care for the elderly. The works were completed six weeks ahead of schedule, to the great satisfaction of the client.\n\nWhen Stuart’s mother passed away he started to work closely with his father again. Together they formed a company and carried out extensions, refurbishment and maintenance works in the Home Counties area.\n\nStuart has three boys, Scott, Dale and Ross. As they have grown older they have become involved in the family business, although the Scott has now emigrated to New Zealand. Dale has run his own successful decorating business for the last 10 years and now operates Orange Decorating Services. Ross is working in all three companies within our group:\n\nOrange Building Solutions Ltd carry out all aspects of building and maintenance works.\n\nOrangescape Ltd are resin bound surfacing specialists for driveways and paths and have become Industry Approved Installers.\n\nOrange Decorating Services carry out high quality decoration and associated works."
