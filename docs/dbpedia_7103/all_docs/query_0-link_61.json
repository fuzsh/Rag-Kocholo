        "text": "Serverless is the next-generation way to manage and streamline development processes while providing great value for business applications. Because they expand automatically depending on requests, serverless databases do not require considerable capacity planning.\n\nSimply put, developers can create apps using infrastructure without a particular hardware platform by using a serverless database. It is designed to handle developers’ unpredictable and constantly changing workloads, and businesses need a highly secure and scalable data infrastructure. This is where serverless databases come in.\n\nBut what’s in it for businesses? Well, serverless companies handle the difficult tasks of allocating, configuring, and maintaining servers. As a result, rather than paying for servers, you pay for database calls made by your application and storage used by your data. You don’t have to speculate on what that may be; you simply pay for what you use. They automatically allocate more hardware to handle the increased load if you use more. If you use less, you’ll pay less, or perhaps nothing.\n\nIn this week’s Tech Tuesday, we’ll look at modern database and backend solutions that can help you simplify your business management.\n\nLet’s get started!\n\nSupabase\n\nSupabase is an open-source Firebase alternative providing all the backend features you need to build a product. You can use it completely or just the features you need. Start a project with the hosted platform or learn how to host Supabase yourself.\n\nMore on Supabase.io.\n\nCloud Firestore\n\nCloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable mobile, web, and server development database from Firebase and Google Cloud. It keeps your data in sync across client apps through real-time listeners.\n\nCloud Firestore is a cloud-hosted, NoSQL database that your Apple, Android, and web apps can access directly via native SDKs. It offers offline support for mobile and web, so you can build responsive apps that work regardless of network latency or Internet connectivity.\n\nCloud Firestore integrates with other Firebase and Google Cloud products, including Cloud Functions. New customers get $300 in free credits to spend on Firestore. All customers get 1 GB of storage free per project, not charged against your credits.\n\nMore here.\n\nAmazon Aurora Serverless\n\nAmazon Aurora Serverless is autoscaling, on-demand setup for Amazon Aurora. It automatically starts, shuts down, and scales capacity up or down based on the needs of your application. You can operate your database on AWS without worrying about database capacity. You build a database, set the capacity range, and link your apps with Aurora Serverless.\n\nWhen the database is active, you pay per second for the database capacity you use. You can switch between conventional and serverless setups with a few clicks in the Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) console.\n\nMore here.\n\nCockroachdb Serverless\n\nCockroachDB is a cloud-based SQL database. CockroachDB serverless is “forever free,” with a generous (and never-ending) monthly credit for requests and storage. With just a few clicks or an API call, you can create a fully-featured CockroachDB database in seconds.\n\nYou get an “always on” database that survives data centre failure and keeps multiple encrypted copies of your data, so you don’t lose it to hackers or hardware failure. It automatically and transparently scales to meet your needs, no matter how big or small, with no changes to your application. It supports online schema migrations and Postgres compatibility and gives you access to Enterprise features.\n\nMore here.\n\nPlanetScale- Serverless Database\n\nPlanetScale is a MySQL-compatible database platform that gives your engineering teams more power, like sharding and non-blocking schema changes, without requiring you to be a database expert. PlanetScale is built on battle-tested Vitess; a graduated CNCF open-source project used by GitHub, HubSpot, Slack and Square to serve millions of queries per second. PlanetScale reduces time-to-market for new applications and eliminates the cost and effort of managing database infrastructure.\n\nPlanetScale is available in multiple AWS regions, including Brazil, Germany and Australia. You can deploy your app today starting at $0 a month for 10GB storage, three developer environments and 1000 concurrent connections. Costs vary according to your serverless network usage once you hit 1 billion rows read or 10 million rows written.\n\nMore here.\n\nAiven for ClickHouse\n\nAiven for ClickHouse processes hundreds of millions of rows and tens of gigabytes of data per server per second. Based on open source ClickHouse, it is a fully managed cloud data warehouse that brings high-performance analytics to Aiven and allows the generation of analytical data reports in real-time using advanced SQL queries.\n\nIt further democratises access to best-of-breed open-source technologies while disrupting the data warehouse market, being 6-7 times faster than existing proprietary cloud data warehouses.\n\nMore here.\n\nUpstash\n\nUpstash is a Serverless in-memory cloud database from Upstash Inc, a California-based company.

With Redis, you write fewer lines of code to store, access, and use data in your applications. The difference is that developers who use Redis can use a simple command structure instead of traditional databases’ query languages. More here.\n\nSocket.IO\n\nSocket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server. It is built on top of the WebSocket protocol and provides additional guarantees like a fallback to HTTP long-polling or automatic reconnection. More here.\n\nPusher\n\nPusher is a hosted API service that seamlessly adds real-time data and functionality to web and mobile applications. Pusher works as a real-time communication layer between the server and the client. It maintains persistent connections with the client using WebSockets as and when new data is added to your server. More here.\n\nCouchbase\n\nCouchbase Server provides high availability for the reading and writing of data through a variety of features.
