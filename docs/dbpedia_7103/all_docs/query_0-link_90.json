        "text": "CLOUD COMPUTING\n\nAgenda What is “Cloud\\\"? What is Cloud Computing? Cloud Computing Models SaaS PaaS IaaS Pillars of Cloud Computing Types of Cloud What's so great about the cloud?\n\nHistory of Cloud At around in 1961, John MacCharty suggested in a speech at MIT that computing can be sold like a utility, just like a water or electricity. It was a brilliant idea, but like all brilliant ideas, it was ahead if its time, as for the next few decades, despite interest in the model, the technology simply was not ready for it. But of course time has passed and the technology caught that idea and after few years we mentioned that: In 1999, Salesforce.com started delivering of applications to users using a simple website. The applications were delivered to enterprises over the Internet, and this way the dream of computing sold as utility were true. In 2002, Amazon started Amazon Web Services, providing services like storage, computation and even human intelligence. However, only starting with the launch of the Elastic Compute Cloud in 2006 a truly commercial service open to everybody existed. In 2009, Google Apps also started to provide cloud computing enterprise applications. Of course, all the big players are present in the cloud computing evolution, some were earlier, some were later. In 2009, Microsoft launched Windows Azure, and companies like Oracle and HP have all joined the game. This proves that today, cloud computing has become mainstream.\n\nWhat Is Cloud Computing? In simple terms, cloud computing is renting instead of buying your IT. Rather than investing heavily in databases, software, and equipment, companies are opting to access their compute power via the internet and pay for it as they use it. When a company chooses to “move to the cloud,” it means that its IT infrastructure is stored offsite, at a data center that is maintained by the cloud computing provider (such as Oracle / AWS / Salesforce / Azure /GCP). The cloud provider has the responsibility for managing the customer’s IT infrastructure, integrating applications, and developing new capabilities and functionality to keep pace with market demands. For customers, cloud computing offers more agility, scale, and flexibility. Instead spending money and resources on legacy IT systems, customers are able to focus on more strategic tasks. Without making a large upfront investment, companies can quickly access the computing resources they need—and only pay for what they need\n\nCloud Computing Models-  Software As A Service  Platform As A Service  Infrastructure As a Service\n\nTypes of Cloud Services Cloud Computing Models- Contd.. SaaS Software as a service (SaaS) is a software delivery model in which the cloud provider hosts the customer’s applications at their location. The customer accesses their applications over the internet. Rather than paying for and maintaining their own computing infrastructure, the customer takes advantage of subscription to the service on a pay-as-you-go basis. Benefits Many businesses are finding SaaS to be the ideal solution because it enables them to get up and running quickly with the most innovative technology available. Automatic updates reduce the burden on in-house resources. Customers can scale services to support fluctuating workloads, adding more services or features they grow. A modern cloud suite provides complete software for every business need such as customer experience, ERP procurement, ERP project portfolio management, supply chain, and enterprise planning.\n\nCloud Computing Models- Contd.. PaaS and Platform as a service (PaaS) enables customers the advantage to access the developer tools they need to build and manage mobile and web applications without investing in—or maintaining—the underlying infrastructure. The provider hosts the infrastructure and middleware components and the customer accesses those services via a web browser. Its Benefits To aid productivity, Oracle’s PaaS offers ready-to-use programming components that allow developers to build new capabilities into their applications, including innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). It also include solutions for analysts, end users, and professional IT administrators, including big data analytics, content management, database management, systems management, and security. PaaS includes infrastructure (servers, storage, and networking) and platform (middleware, development tools, database management systems, business intelligence, and more) to support the web application life cycle. Example: Google App Engine, Force.com, Joyent, Azure.\n\nCloud Computing Models- Contd.. IaaS Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) enables customers to access infrastructure services on an on-demand basis through the internet. The key advantage is that the cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components that provide compute, storage, and network capacity so that their subscribers can run their workloads in the cloud. The cloud subscriber is usually responsible for installing, configuring, securing, and maintaining any software on the cloud-based infrastructure, such as database, middleware, and application software. IaaS provider provides the following services – 1.Compute: Computing as a Service includes virtual central processing units and virtual main memory for the Vms that is provisioned to the end- users. 2.Storage: IaaS provider provides back-end storage for storing files. 3.Network: Network as a Service (NaaS) provides networking components such as routers, switches, and bridges for the Vms. 4.Load balancers: It provides load balancing capability at the infrastructure layer.\n\nCloud Computing Models- Contd..\n\nWhat is “Cloud” ?  Moving to the cloud. Running in the cloud. Stored in the cloud. Accessed from the cloud: these days is seems like everything is happening “in the cloud”. But what exactly is this nebulous concept?  The short answer is that it's somewhere at the other end of your internet connection – a place where you can access apps and services, and where your data can be stored securely.  The cloud is a big deal for three reasons:  It doesn't need any effort on your part to maintain or manage it.  It's effectively infinite in size, so you don't need to worry about it running out of capacity.  You can access cloud-based applications and services from anywhere – all you need is a device with an Internet connection. That's important because there's a shift going on from office-based work to working on the move. This shift is reflected in computer hardware sales: in 2015 about 270 million desktop and laptop computers will be sold, compared to 325 million tablets and almost 2 billion smartphones.\n\nWhat is Cloud Computing? Cloud-based (or cloud computing) means that the applications are delivered over the Internet and run in any Web browser so that you can access them from any smart device. No Hardware, No Software. Cloud computing applications are less expensive than desktop software because you only pay to use the software instead of having to buy, install, configure, and maintain it. It’s effectively infinite in size, so you don’t need to worry about it running out of capacity.\n\nCloud Computing Models-  Software As A Service  Platform As A Service  Infrastructure As a Service\n\nWhat is SaaS?  Software as a service (or SaaS) is a way of delivering applications over the Internet—as a service. Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management.  SaaS applications are sometimes called Web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software. Whatever the name, SaaS applications run on a SaaS provider’s servers. The provider manages access to the application, including security, availability, and performance.  SaaS customers have no hardware or software to buy, install, maintain, or update. Access to applications is easy: You just need an Internet connection.\n\nThe Top 20 Software as a Service (SaaS) Vendors Abiquo Examples of SAAS Accelops Akamai  Gmail. AppDynamics  Facebook. Apprenda  Twitter. Meghaware  Flickr. Cloud9  Instagram CloudSwitch CloudTran Cumulux Eloqua FinancialForce Intacct Marketo NetSuite Oracle On Demand Pardot Salesforce.com SAP Business ByDesign\n\nWhat is Paas? Platform as a Service — or PaaS — is a proven model for running applications without the hassle of maintaining the hardware and software infrastructure at your company. Here, dedicated software platforms are built and managed by the cloud computing service provider to run and develop business applications. These platforms support every stage of creating a web application online, no additional software is required whatsoever in the local computer.  The App Cloud brings the same trust and speed at the core of all our products to building and deploying apps in the cloud, faster than any on premise application platform, hybrid platforms, and many cloud platforms that are not as complete. Build apps with PaaS, not infrastructure:  At its core, Platform as a Service (PaaS) eliminates the expense and complexity of evaluating, buying, configuring, and managing all the hardware and software needed for custom-built applications.\n\nForce.com Active/Parent for SaaS Applications Heroku Any server side scripting Language. Ex: Pearl, Ruby, Python and Java Fuel Used for Marketing Applications which are customized.\n\nWhy PaaS is being adopted: The traditional application model is broken.\n\nThe Top 20 Platform as a Service (PaaS) Vendors Amazon Web Services Appristy AppScale CA Technologies Engine Yard Flexiscale Salesforce.com Force.com, gcloud3 Gigaspaces Visual WebGui Google Gridgain Longjump Windows Azure Openstack OrangeScape OS33 Outsystems Rightscale\n\nWhat does IaaS mean?  Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a service model that delivers computer infrastructure on an outsourced basis to support enterprise operations. Typically, IaaS provides hardware, storage, servers and data center space or network components; it may also include software. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is also known as Hardware as a Service (HaaS).  An IaaS provider provides policy based services and is responsible for housing, operating and maintaining the equipment it provides for a client. Clients usually pay on a per-use or utility computing basis. Characteristics of IaaS include: Automated administrative tasks Dynamic scaling Platform virtualization Internet connectivity IaaS is also described as one of three main categories of cloud computing service. The other two are Software as a Service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS).  means the cloud service providers will provides infrastructure like servers, hosting services and storage. Servers and storage’s are the basic services provide by Cloud Service Providers. Top cloud providers (IaaS). Amazon web Services. AT&T. Bluelock. CA Technologies. Cloudscaling DATAPIPE. ENKI. Enomaly. Eucalyptus Systems. GoGrid. HP\n\nPillars of Cloud Computing\n\nWorking Across Regions When working within a service, the Console displays resources that are in the currently selected region. So if your tenancy has instances in CompartmentA in US West (Phoenix), and instances in CompartmentA in US East (Ashburn), you can only view the instances in one region at a time, even though the instances are in the same compartment. Using the following figure as an example, if you select US West (Phoenix) and then select CompartmentA, you see instances 1 and 2 listed. To see instances 3 and 4 in the Console, you must switch to US East (Ashburn) (and then you no longer see instances 1 and 2).\n\nTypes of Cloud  Public Cloud.  Private Cloud.  Hybrid Cloud .  Community Cloud. Public Cloud- Public cloud can be available to people across the world. In this Public Cloud the user has no control over the resources. Benfits of Public Cloud 1. Low Cost. 2. Pay per usage.\n\nPrivate Cloud Contd.. Services on Private Cloud Can be accessed only with in the limited premises. In Private cloud Cloud Services Providers provides Cloud infrastructure to particular Organization or Business specially. This Cloud infrastructure is not provided to others. In the private cloud, you’re not sharing cloud computing resources with any other organization. The data center resources may be located on-premise or operated by a third- party vendor off-site. The computing resources are isolated and delivered via a secure private network, and not shared with other customers. Private cloud is customizable to meet the unique business and security needs of the organization. Two types of clouds in Private Cloud. 1. On-Premises Private Cloud. 2. Externally Hosted Private Cloud. On-Premises Private Cloud - This type of Cloud is Hosted internally by the same company / Organization\n\nPublic Cloud Private Cloud Cloud Computing infrastructure shared to public by service Cloud Computing infrastructure shared to private organisation by provider over the internet. It supports multiple customers i.e, service provider over the internet. It supports one enterprise. enterprises. Multi-Tenancy i.e, Data of many enterprise are stored in shared Single Tenancy i.e, Data of single enterprise is stored. environment but are isolated. Data is shared as per rule, permission and security. Cloud service provider provides all the possible services and Specific hardware and hardware as per need of enterprise are hardware as the user-base is world. Different people and available in private cloud. organization may need different services and hardware. Services provided must be versatile. It is hosted at Service Provider site. It is hosted at Service Provider site or enterprise. It is connected to the public internet. It only supports connectivity over the private network. Scalability is very high, and reliability is moderate. Scalability is limited, and reliability is very high. Cloud service provider manages cloud and customers use them. Managed and used by single enterprise. It is cheaper than private cloud. It is costlier than public cloud. Security matters and dependent on service provider. It gives high class of security. Performance is low to medium. Performance is high. It has shared servers. It has dedicated servers. Example : Amazon web service (AWS) and Google AppEngine etc. Example : Microsoft KVM, HP, Red Hat & VMWare etc.\n\nContd.. Hybrid Cloud Technology Hybrid Cloud is the combination of number of clouds of any type but the cloud has the ability to allow data and / or applications to be moved from on cloud to another cloud. Hybrid Cloud is a combination of (Public Cloud ,Private Cloud, Community Cloud). A hybrid cloud is a type of cloud computing that combines on-premises infrastructure—or a private cloud—with a public cloud. Hybrid clouds allow data and apps to move between the two environments. Many organizations choose a hybrid cloud approach due to business imperatives such as meeting regulatory and data sovereignty requirements, taking full advantage of on-premises technology investment or addressing low latency issues.\n\nCommunity Cloud Community Cloud is a hybrid form of private cloud. They are multi-tenant platforms that enable different organizations to work on a shared platform. The purpose of this concept is to allow multiple customers to work on joint projects and applications that belong to the community, where it is necessary to have a centralized cloud infrastructure. In other words, Community Cloud is a distributed infrastructure that solves the specific issues of business sectors by integrating the services provided by different types of cloud solution Multi Tenant Architecture. Multiple organizations share a public cloud, multiple organizations will sometimes be using the same physical server at the same time. This is called multitenancy. Multitenancy is when multiple customers of a cloud provider are accessing the same server. Data from two different companies could be stored on the same server, or processes from two different applications could be running on the same server. Multi Tenant Architecture means set of resources provided over the cloud and been accessed to number of users across the organization with set of permissions. Here all applications run on a single logical environment. It is faster, more secure, more available, automatically upgraded and maintained. All upgrades, updates, patches, security, disaster recovery improvements available to all customers at once. Single Tenancy Architecture means each customer is given with a dedicated software stack and each layer in its stack requires configuration, monitoring, Security, Patches, tuning and disaster recovery.\n\nWhat's so great about the cloud? Adoption of the cloud has been swift and global. Here are some of the most important reasons why:  FAST IMPLEMENTATION If you've ever been involved in the implementation of a new application you'll know it can take months or even years to get it up and running. But with a cloud-based application you can cut through this complexity. In many cases you can sign up and start using the application instantly, and even the most wide-ranging enterprise applications are usually up and running in a matter of days or weeks rather than months or years.  NO UP-FRONT COSTS Implementing a new application used to mean considerable capital expenditure in new equipment – not to mention the cost of licenses, integration and the inevitable consultants – but with cloud software these capital expenditure costs are dramatically reduced or even completely eliminated. Instead you simply pay a monthly fee, transforming a significant capital expenditure into predictable operational expense.  INSTANT SCALABILITY With cloud-based applications you can increase or decrease the number of users as your needs change over time. That means you pay only for what you need, and you never have to worry about running out of capacity.\n\nWhat's so great about the cloud?  MAINTENANCE FREE Patching, upgrading and testing applications can take up days of your IT staff's time every month, but with cloud applications none of this is necessary. That's because it's all handled in the cloud, leaving your staff with more time to work on new projects and innovations.  ACCESS ANYWHERE Cloud applications are designed to be accessed securely from anywhere and from any device.  BETTER SECURITY Companies lose an average of 263 laptops a year, a 2010 study found, and if they contain confidential data then each loss has serious security implications. But with cloud applications your data is stored securely in the cloud, so a stray laptop is just an inconvenience, not a potential disaster.\n\nCRM CRM stands for “customer relationship management” and it’s software that stores customer contact information like names, addresses, and phone numbers, as well as keeps track of customer activity like website visits, phone calls, email, and more. In Salesforce, all of this information is stored securely in the cloud. How Salesforce Organizes Your Data Salesforce organizes your data into objects and records. Think of an object as a tab on a spreadsheet, and a record like a single row of data. What does CRM do?  Actively tracks and manages customer information.  Connects your entire team from any device.  Intelligently captures customer emails.  Simplifies repetitive tasks so you can concentrate on leads.  Delivers instant insights and recommendations.  Extends and customizes as your business grows.\n\nCRM Objects / Apps Sales Cloud Marketing Cloud Analytics Service Cloud\n\nCRM Objects Description Object Companies you’re doing business with. Account You can also do business with individual people, like solo contractors, using Contacts Person Accounts. Leads People who work at a company you’re Opportunities doing business with (Accounts). Potential prospects who are not yet ready to buy or you haven't determined what product they need. Qualified leads that you’ve converted. When you convert a lead, you create an Account and Contact along with the Opportunity."
