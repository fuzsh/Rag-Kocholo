        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe next generation of India’s Infosyses and Wipros is taking shape rapidly, taking advantage of the big shifts in the technology landscape.\n\nThe next generation of India’s Infosyses and Wipros is taking shape rapidly, taking advantage of the big shifts in the technology landscape to provide cheaper and better services to enterprises around the world\n\nTrue to tradition, India is seeing a blossoming of software companies that could be the inheritors of the legacy of firms such as Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro. The new ventures are taking advantage of the big shifts in the technology landscape to provide cheaper and better services to enterprises around the world.\n\nMoreover, the fact that entrepreneurs who set up such companies—such as online storage provider Gluster and data services provider NetMagic—have cashed out by selling their stakes to bigger rivals has made the proposition of launching an enterprise software firm all the more appealing.\n\n“We are like construction material that people can use to build anything from posh buildings to farmhouses,” said Suresh Sambandam, chief executive of OrangeScape, a Chennai-based venture that provides business applications for multinationals like AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Unilever.\n\nDiscover the stories of your interest\n\nBlockchain\n\n5 Stories\n\nCyber-safety\n\n7 Stories\n\nFintech\n\n9 Stories\n\nE-comm\n\n9 Stories\n\nML\n\n8 Stories\n\nEdtech\n\n6 Stories\n\nThe rise in the number of companies offering enterprise software is because of the boom in cloud computing as well as demand for software-as-a-service and data analytics. Globally, enterprise software spending is likely to be $297 billion (about Rs 16.2 lakh crore) in 2013, up 6.4% from 2012, according to research firm Gartner. Typically, enterprise software demand ranges from operating systems, storage and networking to analytics, databases and enterprise messaging.\n\n“Over the past 18 months, we have witnessed a worldwide tectonic transformation of the enterprise software business,” said Ravi Gururaj, vice-president of the product and cloud platforms group at Citrix Systems.\n\nIn the past, most entrepreneurs would have chosen to start a consumer technology company as enterprise software products generally have a longer gestation period and require more expertise. They needed “‘long bake times’ to bring to market,” said Citrix’s Gururaj.\n\nHowever, with the cost of setting up an enterprise software company in India coming down to $200,000, more fledgling entrepreneurs are willing to give it a shot. Also, success stories of global players such as Salesforce, Workday and SuccessFactors provide that added encouragement. A number of new ventures such as Druva, Capillary Technologies, Sapience, OrangeScape and Freshdesk are already raking in the benefits.\n\nDruva, founded by IIT-Guwahati alumnus Jaspreet Singh and his Veritas Software colleagues Ramani Kothandaraman and Milind Borate, was launched as a data backup firm. Soon the founders realised that they were playing in a market which had several formidable competitors such as EMC and Symantec. However, seeing a gap in the market for mobile devices, they tweaked their solution and converted it to provide data protection and management for devices such as laptops and smartphones and rebranded their company Druva in 2008.\n\nDruva, which sells retrieval software and enterprise backup for laptops and other mobile devices to customers such as US space agency Nasa and French fashion brand Louis Vuitton, began with a seed capital of Rs 30 lakh. Backed with $17 million from investors such as Sequoia and Nexus, it now sells products to over 1,200 customers across 26 countries and is on the path to clocking revenues of Rs 550 crore ($100 million) in the next two years.\n\n“The enterprise software segment is undergoing a major disruption,” said Anand Babu Periasamy, who, in 2011, sold his cloud computing startup Gluster to Red Hat for Rs 667 crore. Periasamy believes this disruption is happening because technology has created level playing field for entrepreneurs across the globe. “Ten years ago, it took an expensive sales guy to play golf with CEOs to close sales deals,” said Periasamy. “But today, even babysitters can collect payments and generate email receipts, all from a mobile phone.”\n\nInvestors, too, are bullish. Nexus Venture Partners, one of the earliest funds to spot the opportunity, has already reaped the benefits. Of its 41 investments, Nexus has exited from six, including cloud computing firm Netmagic, which sold a majority stake to Japan’s NTT Communications for Rs 900 crore. US-based Citrix Systems paid over Rs 1,000 crore to acquire another Nexus portfolio firm, Cloud.com.\n\n“Entrepreneurs at some of our companies such as Netmagic, Gluster and Cloud.com saw opportunities ahead of time and got successful exits,” said Sandeep Singhal, co-founder of Nexus. He said professionals in large technology companies are now increasingly taking the plunge into entrepreneurship to start ventures that address core technology problems.\n\nChennai-based firm Freshdesk provides a platform that integrates traditional support channels such as phone and email with social channels like Twitter and Facebook. It provides this service to customers such as Toshiba, Stanford School of Medicine and education company Pearson. “We saw a shift of communication over social media, rather than sending emails,” said Girish Mathrubootham, CEO of Freshdesk.\n\nThe patient capital from investors willing to wait through long product development and sales cycles is also helping build successful enterprise software companies.\n\n“We are seeing a lot of good ventures in the enterprise software space,” said Promod Haque, senior managing partner at Norwest Venture Partners. Last September, Norwest invested $15.5 million in Capillary Technologies, which uses artificial intelligence to help retailers like Nike and Pizza Hut understand customer purchase behaviour.\n\nThere are also a number of young companies such as Knowlarity Communications and Sapience Analytics that are targeting the domestic market better.\n\n“Building enterprise software in India is like making a machine gun that hits like a sniper rifle,” said Ambarish Gupta, CEO of Knowlarity, which provides cloud-based communication services for beverages maker PepsiCo and consumer products maker Procter & Gamble, helping them cut costs in sales services, enquiry and support calls.\n\nBut even as these ventures record rapid growth, they are finding that the Indian market is still unfriendly to enterprise startups. Lack of risk capital, early customer adoption and unwillingness to pay for the products are compelling many companies to relocate to mature markets like the United States.\n\nDespite the challenges, these firms have put India on the technology map. Quoting from the book “The Innovator’s Dilemma” by Clayton Christensen, Druva’s Singh said nobody could challenge the hard drives of IBM in terms of robustness, speed and space. But young companies such as Seagate Technology created disruption with smaller hard drives during 1980s that served new products like laptops. “Disruption happens when you solve problem that big people don’t focus on,” said Singh. “And by the time they realise its value, you have already become a market leader.”\n\nStanding at a Janus moment, what’s shaping IndiGo’s future\n\nTo China or not to China: India’s biggest strategic and geopolitical dilemma\n\nWhy investing in Nifty 500 Equal Weighted Index could be a good diversification strategy\n\nOnce derided, startups are now market darlings marching to Nifty 50\n\nFrom reforms, roads to robots: Why India's logistics boom is unstoppable\n\nTata Consumer Products needs a Starbucks ‘shot’ to increase its market value exponentially\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
