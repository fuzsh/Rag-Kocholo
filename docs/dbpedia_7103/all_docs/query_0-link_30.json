        "text": "What is Cloud?\n\nThe term Cloud refers to a Network or Internet. In other words, we can say that Cloud is something, which is present at remote location. Cloud can provide services over network, i.e., on public networks or on private networks, i.e., WAN, LAN or VPN.\n\nApplications such as e-mail, web conferencing, customer relationship management (CRM), all run in cloud.\n\nWhat is Cloud Computing?\n\nCloud Computing refers to manipulating, configuring, and accessing the applications online. It offers online data storage, infrastructure and application.\n\nWe need not to install a piece of software on our local PC and this is how, the cloud computing overcomes platform dependency issues. Hence, the Cloud Computing is making our business application mobile and collaborative.\n\nCloud Computing Technologies\n\nThere are certain technologies that are working behind the cloud computing platforms making cloud computing flexible, reliable, usable. These technologies are listed below:\n\nVirtualization\n\nService-Oriented Architecture (SOA)\n\nGrid Computing\n\nUtility Computing\n\nVirtualization\n\nVirtualization is a technique, which allows to share single physical instance of an application or resource among multiple organizations or tenants (customers). It does so by assigning a logical name to a physical resource and providing a pointer to that physical resource when demanded.\n\nThe Multitenant architecture offers virtualization among the multiple tenants and therefore the organizations can use and customize the application as though they each have its own instance running.\n\nService-Oriented Architecture(SOA)\n\nService-Oriented Architecture helps to use applications as a service for other applications regardless type of vendor, product or technology. Therefore, it is possible to exchange the data between applications of different vendors without additional programming or making changes to services.\n\ncloud_computing-service_oriented_architecture\n\nGrid Computing\n\nGrid Computing refers to distributed computing in which a group of computers from multiple locations are connected with each other to achieve common objective. These computer resources are heterogeneous and geographically dispersed.\n\nGrid Computing breaks complex task into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are distributed to CPUs that reside within the grid.\n\nUtility Computing\n\nUtility computing is based on Pay per Use model. It offers computational resources on demand as a metered service. Cloud computing, grid computing, and managed IT services are based on the concept of Utility computing.\n\nCloud Computing Architecture\n\nThe Cloud Computing architecture comprises of many cloud components, each of them are loosely coupled. We can broadly divide the cloud architecture into two parts:\n\nFront End\n\nBack End\n\nEach of the ends are connected through a network, usually via Internet. The following diagram shows the graphical view of cloud computing architecture:\n\nFront End\n\nFront End refers to the client part of cloud computing system. It consists of interfaces and applications that are required to access the cloud computing platforms, e.g., Web Browser.\n\nBack End\n\nBack End refers to the cloud itself. It consists of all the resources required to provide cloud computing services. It comprises of huge data storage, virtual machines, security mechanism, services, deployment models, servers, etc.\n\nCloud Infrastructure Components\n\nCloud infrastructure consists of servers, storage, network, management software, and deployment software and platform virtualization.\n\nHypervisor\n\nHypervisor is a firmware or low level program that acts as a Virtual Machine Manager. It allows to share the single physical instance of cloud resources between several tenants.\n\nManagement Software\n\nManagement Software helps to maintain and configure the infrastructure.\n\nDeployment Software\n\nDeployment software helps to deploy and integrate the application on the cloud.\n\nNetwork\n\nNetwork is the key component of cloud infrastructure. It allows to connect cloud services over the Internet. It is also possible to deliver network as a utility over the Internet, i.e., the consumer can customize the network route and protocol.\n\nServer\n\nServer helps to compute the resource sharing and offer other services such as resource allocation and deallocation, monitoring resources, security, etc.\n\nStorage\n\nCloud uses distributed file system for storage purpose. If one of the storage resource fails, then it can be extracted from another one which makes cloud computing more reliable.\n\nCloud Deployment Models\n\nFoloowing are the cloud deployment models:\n\nPublic Cloud Model\n\nPrivate Cloud Model\n\nHybrid Cloud Model\n\nCommunity Cloud Model\n\nPublic Cloud Model\n\nThe Public Cloud Model allows systems and services to be easily accessible to general public, e.g., Google, Amazon, Microsoft offers cloud services via Internet.\n\nBenefits\n\nCost Effective\n\nReliability\n\nFlexibility\n\nLocation Independence\n\nUtility Style Costing\n\nHigh Scalability\n\nDisadvantages\n\nLow Security\n\nLess customizable\n\nPrivate Cloud Model\n\nThe Private Cloud allows systems and services to be accessible within an organization. The Private Cloud is operated only within a single organization. However, it may be managed internally or by third-party.\n\nBenefits\n\nHere are the benefits of deploying cloud as private cloud model.\n\nHigher Security and Privacy\n\nMore Control\n\nCost and energy efficiency\n\nDisadvantages\n\nHere are the disadvantages of using private cloud model:\n\nRestricted Area\n\nInflexible Pricing\n\nLimited Scalability\n\nAdditional Skills\n\nHybrid Cloud Model\n\nThe Hybrid Cloud is mixture of public and private cloud. Non-critical activities are performed using public cloud while the critical activities are performed using private cloud.\n\nBenefits\n\nHere are the benefits of deploying cloud as hybrid cloud model:\n\nScalability\n\nFlexibility\n\nCost Efficiencies\n\nDisadvantages\n\nHere are the disadvantages of Hybrid Cloud Model:\n\nNetworking Issues\n\nSecurity Compliance\n\nInfrastructural Dependency\n\nCommunity Cloud Model\n\nThe Community Cloud allows systems and services to be accessible by group of organizations. It shares the infrastructure between several organizations from a specific community. It may be managed internally or by the third-party.\n\nBenefits\n\nHere are the benefits of deploying cloud as community cloud model:\n\nCost effective\n\nSharing Between Organizations\n\nSecurity\n\nIssues\n\nSince all data is housed at one location, one must be careful in storing data in community cloud because it might be accessible by others.\n\nIt is also challenging to allocate responsibilities of governance, security and cost.\n\nCloud Service Models\n\nFollowing are the cloud service models:\n\nInfrastructure as a Service(IaaS) Model\n\nPlatform as a Service(PaaS) Model\n\nSoftware as a Service(SaaS) Model\n\nIdentity as a Service(IDaaS) Model\n\nNetwork as a Service(NaaS) Model\n\nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS)\n\nIaaS provides access to fundamental resources such as physical machines, virtual machines, virtual storage, etc. Apart from these resources, the IaaS also offers:\n\nVirtual machine disk storage\n\nVirtual local area network (VLANs)\n\nLoad balancers\n\nIP addresses\n\nSoftware bundles\n\nAll of the above resources are made available to end user via server virtualization. Moreover, these resources are accessed by the customers as if they own them.\n\nBenefits\n\nIaaS allows the cloud provider to freely locate the infrastructure over the Internet in a cost-effective manner. Some of the key benefits of IaaS are listed below:\n\nFull Control of the computing resources through Administrative Access to VMs.\n\nFlexible and Efficient renting of Computer Hardware.\n\nPortability, Interoperability with Legacy Applications.\n\nIssues\n\nHere are the issues associated with IaaS:\n\nCompatibility with Legacy Security Vulnerabilities\n\nVirtual Machine Sprawl\n\nRobustness of VM-level tion\n\nData Erase Practices\n\nCharacteristics\n\nHere are the characteristics of IaaS service model:\n\nVirtual machines with pre-installed software.\n\nVirtual machines with pre-installed Operating Systems such as windows, Linux, and Solaris.\n\nOn-demand availability of resources.\n\nAllows to store copies of particular data in different locations.\n\nThe computing resources can be easily scaled up and down.\n\nPlatform as a Service (PaaS)\n\nPaaS offers the runtime environment for applications. It also offers development & deployment tools, required to develop applications. PaaS has a feature of point-and-click tools that enables non-developers to create web applications.\n\nThe following diagram shows how PaaS offers an API and development tools to the developers and how it helps the end user to access business applications.\n\nBenefits\n\nFollowing are the benefits of PaaS model:\n\nLower administrative overhead\n\nLower total cost of ownership\n\nScalable Solutions\n\nMore current system software\n\nIssues\n\nLike SaaS, PaaS also place significant burdens on consumer’s browsers to maintain reliable and secure connections to the provider systems. Therefore, PaaS shares many of the issues of SaaS. However, there are some specific issues associated with PaaS as listed below:\n\nLack of portability between PaaS clouds\n\nEvent Based Processor Scheduling\n\nSecurity Engineering of PaaS applications\n\nSoftware as a Service (SaaS)\n\nSoftware as a Service(SaaS) model allows to provide software applications as a service to the end users. It refers to a software that is deployed on a hosted service and is accessible via Internet. There are several SaaS applications. Some of them are listed below:\n\nBilling and Invoicing System\n\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM) applications\n\nHelp Desk Applications\n\nHuman Resource (HR) Solutions\n\nCharacteristics\n\nHere are the characteristics of SaaS service model:\n\nSaaS makes the software available over the Internet.\n\nThe softwares are maintained by the vendor rather than where they are running.\n\nThe license to the software may be subscription based or usage based. And it is billed on recurring basis.\n\nSaaS applications are cost effective since they do not require any maintenance at end user side.\n\nThey are available on demand.\n\nThey can be scaled up or down on demand.\n\nThey are automatically upgraded and updated.\n\nSaaS offers share data model. Therefore, multiple users can share single instance of infrastructure. It is not required to hard code the functionality for individual users.\n\nAll users are running same version of the software.\n\nBenefits\n\nUsing SaaS has proved to be beneficial in term of scalability, efficiency, performance and much more. Some of the benefits are listed below:\n\nModest Software Tools\n\nEfficient use of Software Licenses\n\nCentralized Management & Data\n\nPlatform responsibilities managed by provider\n\nMultitenant solutions\n\nIssues\n\nThere are several issues associated with SaaS. Some of them are listed below:\n\nBrowser based risks\n\nNetwork dependence\n\nLack of portability between SaaS clouds\n\nIdentity as a Service (IDaaS)\n\nOverview\n\nEmployees in a company require to login into system to perform various tasks. These systems may be based on local server or cloud based. Following are the problems that an employee might face:\n\nRemembering different username and password combinations for accessing multiple servers.\n\nIf an employee leaves the company, it’s required to ensure that each of the user’s account has been disabled. This increases workload on IT staff.\n\nTo solve above problems, a new technique emerged which is known as Identity as a Service (IDaaS).\n\nIDaaS offers management of identity (information) as a digital entity. This identity can be used during electronic transactions.\n\nIdentity\n\nIdentity refers to set of attributes associated with something and make it recognizable. All objects may have some same attributes but their identity cannot be the same. This unique identity is assigned through unique identification attribute.\n\nThere are several identity services that have been deployed to validate services such as validating web sites, transactions, transaction participants, client, etc. Identity as a Service may include the following:\n\nDirectory Services\n\nFederated Services\n\nRegistration\n\nAuthentication Services\n\nRisk and Event monitoring\n\nSingle sign-on services\n\nIdentity and Profile management\n\nSingle Sign-On (SSO)\n\nTo solve the problem of using different username & password combinations for different servers, companies now employ Single Sign-On software, which allows the user to login only one time and manages the user’s access to other systems.\n\nSSO has single authentication server managing multiple accesses to other systems as shown in the following diagram:\n\nSSO working\n\nThere are several implementations of SSO. Here, we will discuss the common working of SSO:\n\nFollowing steps explain the working of Single Sign-On software:\n\nUser logs into the authentication server using a username and password.\n\nThe authentication server returns the user’s ticket.\n\nUser sends the ticket to intranet server.\n\nIntranet server sends the ticket to the authentication server.\n\nAuthentication server sends the user’s security credentials for that server back to the intranet server.\n\nIf an employee leaves the company, then it is just required to disable the user at the authentication server, which in turn disables the user’s access to all the systems.\n\nFederated Identity Management (FIDM)\n\nFIDM describes the technologies and protocols that enable a user to package security credentials across security domains. It uses Security Markup Language (SAML) to package a user’s security credentials as shown in the following diagram:\n\nOpenID\n\nIt offers users to login into multiple websites with single account. Google, Yahoo!, Flickr, MySpace, WordPress.com are some of the companies that support OpenID.\n\nBenefits\n\nIncreased site conversation rates.\n\nAccess to greater user profile content.\n\nFewer problems with lost passwords.\n\nEase of content integration into social networking sites.\n\nNetwork as a Service(NaaS)\n\nOverview\n\nNetworks as a Service allows us to access the network infrastructure directly and securely. NaaS makes it possible to deploy custom routing protocols.\n\nNaaS uses virtualized network infrastructure to provide network services to the consumer. It is the responsibility of NaaS provider to maintain and manage the network resources, which decreases the workload from the consumer. Moreover, NaaS offers network as a utility.\n\nNaaS is also based on pay-per-use model.\n\nHow NaaS is delivered?\n\nTo use NaaS model, the consumer is required to logon to the web portal, where he can get online API. Here, the consumer can customize the route.\n\nIn turn, consumer has to pay for the capacity used. It is also possible to turn off the capacity at any time.\n\nMobile NaaS\n\nMobile NaaS offers more efficient and flexible control over mobile devices. It uses virtualization to simplify the architecture to create more efficient processes.\n\nFollowing diagram shows the Mobile NaaS service elements:\n\nNaaS Benefits\n\nNaaS offers a number of benefits, some of them are discussed below:\n\nIndependence\n\nAnalytics\n\nResilience\n\nEase of Adding new Service Elements\n\ntion of customer traffic\n\nSupport Models\n\nCloud Management Tasks\n\nCloud Management involves a number of tasks to be performed by the cloud provider to ensure efficient use of cloud resources. Here, we will discuss some of these tasks:\n\nAudit System Backups\n\nSystem’s Data Flow Management\n\nEnsuring no Vendor Lock-in\n\nProvider’s security procedures\n\nMonitor Capacity Planning and Scaling Capabilities\n\nMonitor Audit-Log Use\n\nSolution testing and Validation\n\nCloud Data Storage\n\nCloud Storage is a service that allows to save data on offsite storage system managed by third-party and is made accessible by a web services API.\n\nStorage Devices\n\nStorage devices can be broadly classified into two categories:\n\nBlock Storage Devices\n\nFile Storage Devices\n\nBlock Storage Devices\n\nBlock Storage Devices offers the raw storage to the clients. This raw storage can be partitioned to create volumes.\n\nFile Storage Devices\n\nFile Storage Devices offers storage to clients in form of files, maintaining its own file system. This storage is in the form of Network Attached Storage (NAS).\n\nCloud Storage Classes\n\nCloud Storage can be broadly classified into two categories:\n\nUnmanaged Cloud Storage\n\nManaged Cloud Storage\n\nUnmanaged Cloud Storage\n\nUnmanaged Cloud Storage means that the storage is preconfigured for the consumer. The consumer cannot format nor the consumer can install own file system or change drive properties.\n\nManaged Cloud Storage\n\nManaged Cloud Storage offers online storage space on demand. Managed cloud storage system presents what appears to the user to be a raw disk that the user can partition and format.\n\nCreating Cloud Storage System\n\nThe cloud storage system stores multiple copies of data on multiple servers and in multiple locations. If one system fails, then it only requires to change the pointer to stored object’s location.\n\nTo aggregate storage assets into cloud storage systems, the cloud provider can use storage virtualization software, StorageGRID. It creates a virtualization layer that fetches storage from different storage devices into a single management system. It can also manage data from CIFS and NFS file system over the Internet. The following diagram shows how SystemGRID virtualizes the storage into storage clouds:\n\nVirtual Storage Containers\n\nVirtual storage containers offer high performance cloud storage systems. Logical Unit Number (LNU) of device, files and other objects are created in virtual storage containers. Following diagram shows a virtual storage container defining a cloud storage domain:\n\nChallenges\n\nStoring the data in cloud is not that simple task. Apart from its flexibility and convenience, it also has several challenges faced by the consumers. The consumers require ability to:\n\nProvision additional storage on demand.\n\nKnow and restrict the physical location of the stored data.\n\nVerify how data was erased?\n\nHave access to a documented process for surely disposing of data storage hardware.\n\nAdministrator access control over data.\n\nVirtualization Concept\n\nCreating a virtual machine over existing operating system and hardware is referred as Hardware Virtualization. Virtual Machines provide an environment that is logically separated from the underlying hardware.\n\nThe machine on which the virtual machine is created is known as host machine and virtual machine is referred as a guest machine. This virtual machine is managed by a software or firmware, which is known as hypervisor.\n\nHypervisor\n\nHypervisor is a firmware or low-level program that acts as a Virtual Machine Manager. There are two types of hypervisor:\n\nType 1 hypervisor\n\nType 1 hypervisor runs on bare system. LynxSecure, RTS Hypervisor, Oracle VM, Sun xVM Server, VirtualLogic VLX are examples of Type 1 hypervisor. The following diagram shows the Type 1 hypervisor.\n\nThe type1 hypervisor does not have any host operating system because they are installed on a bare system.\n\nType 2 hypervisor\n\nType 2 hypervisor is a software interface that emulates the devices with which a system normally interacts. Containers, KVM, Microsoft Hyper V, VMWare Fusion, Virtual Server 2005 R2, Windows Virtual PC and VMWare workstation 6.0 are examples of Type 2 hypervisor. The following diagram shows the Type 2 hypervisor.\n\nTypes of Hardware Virtualization\n\nHere are the three types of hardware virtualization:\n\nFull Virtualization\n\nEmulation Virtualization\n\nParavirtualization\n\nFull Virtualization\n\nIn Full Virtualization, the underlying hardware is completely simulated. Guest software do not require any modification to run.\n\nEmulation Virtualization\n\nIn Emulation, the virtual machine simulates the hardware and hence becomes independent of the IT. In this, the guest operating system does not require modification.\n\nParavirtualization\n\nIn Paravirtualization, the hardware is not simulated. The guest software runs their own ted domains.\n\nVMware vSphere is highly developed infrastructure that offers a management infrastructure framework for virtualization. It virtualizes the system, storage and networking hardware.\n\nSecuring the Cloud\n\nSecurity in cloud computing is a major concern. Data in cloud should be stored in encrypted form. To restrict client from direct accessing the shared data, proxy and brokerage services should be employed.\n\nSecurity Planning\n\nBefore deploying a particular resource to cloud, one should need to analyze several attributes about the resource such as:\n\nSelect which resources he is going to move to cloud and analyze its sensitivity to risk.\n\nConsider cloud service models such as IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. These models require consumer to be responsible for security at different levels of service.\n\nConsider which cloud type such as public, private, community or hybrid.\n\nUnderstand the cloud service provider’s system that how data is transferred where it is stored and how to move data into and out of cloud.\n\nMainly the risk in cloud deployment depends upon the service models and cloud types.\n\nUnderstanding Security of Cloud\n\nSecurity Boundaries\n\nA particular service model defines the boundary between the responsibilities of service provider and consumer. Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) stack model defines the boundaries between each service model and shows how different functional units relate to each other. The following diagram shows the CSA stack model:\n\nKey points to CSA model:\n\nIaaS is the most basic level of service with PaaS and SaaS next two above levels of service.\n\nMoving upwards, each of the service inherits capabilities and security concerns of the model beneath.\n\nIaaS provides the infrastructure, PaaS provides platform development environment and SaaS provides operating environment.\n\nIaaS has the least level of integrated functionalities and integrated security while SaaS has the most.\n\nThis model describes the security boundaries at which cloud service provider’s responsibility ends and the consumer’s responsibilities begins.\n\nAny security mechanism below the security boundary must be built into the system and above should me maintained by the consumer.\n\nAlthough each service model has security mechanism but security needs also depends upon where these services are located, in private, public, hybrid or community cloud.\n\nUnderstanding Data Security\n\nSince all the data is transferred using Internet, therefore data security is of major concern in cloud. Here are key mechanisms for protecting data mechanisms listed below:\n\nAccess Control\n\nAuditing\n\nAuthentication\n\nAuthorization\n\nAll of the service models should incorporate security mechanism operating in all above-mentioned areas.\n\nIsolated Access to Data\n\nSince data stored in cloud can be accessed from anywhere, therefore to protect the data we must have a mechanism to te data from direct client access.\n\nBrokered Cloud Storage Access is one of the approaches to ting storage in cloud. In this approach, two services are created:\n\nA broker with full access to storage but no access to client.\n\nA proxy with no access to storage but access to both client and broker.\n\nworking of Brokered Cloud Storage Access system\n\nWhen the client issue request to access data:\n\nThe client data request goes to proxy’s external service interface.\n\nThe proxy forwards the request to the broker.\n\nThe broker requests the data from cloud storage system.\n\nThe cloud storage system returns the data to the broker.\n\nThe broker returns the data to proxy.\n\nFinally the proxy sends the data to the client.\n\nAll of the above steps are shown in the following diagram:\n\nEncryption\n\nEncryption helps to protect data from being compromised. It protects data that is being transferred as well as data stored in the cloud. Although encryption helps to protect data from any unauthorized access, it does not prevent from data loss.\n\nCloud Computing Operations\n\nCloud computing operation refers to delivering superior cloud service. Today, cloud computing operations have become very popular and widely employed by many of the organizations just because it allows to perform all business operations over the Internet.\n\nThese operations can be performed using a web application or mobile based applications.
