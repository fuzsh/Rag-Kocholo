        "text": "I watch your walls bleed\n\nI play in your pool of tears\n\nI let in the light\n\nYou show me your kingdom\n\nYou hand me every key\n\nYou present your past wives\n\nAnd at the end of it all you crown me as the night, as the night you found me shrouded in stars like you now cover me in crystals, as the night you housed your final wife\n\nFantastic rendition of Bluebeard's Castle. I've watched a couple others, this one is probably my favorite so far. The horrors behind each door in Bluebeard's Castle leave so much to the viewer's imagination. Showing and telling just enough. Watching Judith react with fearful determination to everything behind each door is pretty great, she wants to see it through. It's definitely kind of slow, pretty tense, but the finale was sort of shocking, in the \"shocking for your grandma\" kind of way. I say that as a compliment. Great watch. Also it's Bela Bartok's music, you really can't go wrong."
