        "text": "Exquisite mise-en-scène distinguishes this BBC production made for the Omnibus series in the late 70s; extraordinary costuming and set design combine with meticulous lighting and framing to create the sustained illusion of 17th Century Dutch genre painting brought to life.\n\nThe dark fairy tale, based on a story by Sheridan Le Fanu is almost secondary to the visual accomplishments of designers Anna Ridley and Christine Rawlins, the art department, led by Bob Blagden, and John Hooper's fluid cinematography. Virtually every frame (this is often said, but here, is no exaggeration) could be a composition in oil. It gets to the heart of the classic Dutch interior, perhaps most elegantly captured by Vermeer - the checkerboard floors, the pendant game, the…\n\n\"You will imagine the demons. Begin.\"\n\nOften miscategorised as one of the BBC's Ghost Stories for Christmas, Leslie Megahey's Schalken the Painter was broadcast at Christmas, yes, but as an edition of Omnibus. Omnibus was a series of art documentaries, which could be fairly wayward - Ken Russell was a regular contributor - but they certainly weren't known for making disturbing adaptations of the work of Joseph Sheridan le Fanu. (They did, however, produce Jonathan Miller's Whistle and I'll Come to You, which was retrospectively canonised as the first of the BBC's Christmas ghost stories) So what gives?\n\nA large part of the reason why Megahey got away with this is that le Fanu's story deals with a real painter,…\n\n1st Leslie Megahey\n\nAh, Winter. It always comes so much sooner these days in the UK, and each one promises to be more bleak than the last. So, what better way to announce the impending misery by wrapping oneself up in the chilling embrace of a Ghost Story for Christmas? Well, it wasn't made specifically for that slot, but somehow Megahey manages to smartly position this in the Omnibus arts documentary slot, persuading the powers that be that he could weave together a factual piece and a horror flick in the same place. As a vivid depiction of the Flemish 17th century, complete with food and housing arrangements, it's pretty killer, with an incredible eye for detail in the sets…\n\nI have no sentimental scenes to describe, no cruelty of guardians, no magnanimity of wards, no agonies, or transport of lovers. The record I have to make is one of sordidness, levity, and heartlessness.\n\nThe original tale by J. Sheridan Le Fanu, which has given me many a sleepless night since I first read it at the age of fifteen, is one of the most thematically dense of all classic ghost stories, a coldly moralistic fable about capitalism’s dual commodification of art and women. This adaptation drives home its harsh critique even more bluntly while simultaneously upping the formal complexity. Can’t describe how bizarre the construction is here: it’s a faux-art history docudrama that gradually evolves into a self-imploding commentary on its own form, where even Le Faun’s drolly detached narrativization and the cinematography’s lavish recreation of Dutch painting are directly implicated in the onscreen perpetuation of male cruelty. This aired on public television? Maybe we do need to retvrn\n\nNot Quite The Hypothesis of the Televised Paintings...\n\n‘British cinema is alive and well and on television’ they said in the 1970s, and they were right. The trouble was, blink and you missed it all.\n\nA hybrid arts documentary-cum-ghost story, Shacklen the Painter was an edition of BBC Omnibus broadcast to take advantage of the newly vacated Ghost Story for Christmas slot. Whilst there is indeed an apparition, this is closer to another televisual posit upon the fine arts from a year earlier, Raul Ruiz’s The Hypothesis of the Stolen Paintings.\n\nWhereas Ruiz’s play upon repetitions was ‘rescued’ by the international film festival circuit, and thus went beyond French TV, this less starry work could only live-on like many pre-video…\n\nA strange, slow fictional gothic horror about a real painter and presented as an arts docu-drama. It must have done some messing with people’s heads when it premiered on TV in the UK as part of the BBC Omnibus series which was known for its art documentaries. The layers!\n\nIt has quite a lethargic pace, but its all about building atmosphere as it sets out its stall in a way that visually looks a bit like the paintings the story is based on. The plot is relatively simple, Artist Schalcken’s love interest is sold in to marriage by her uncle for a lot of money and it doesn’t do well. But beyond the creepiness, there’s something here about the intersection between art, commerce and the treatment of women.\n\nIt's truly a curious piece of filmmaking, and I mean that in a good way.\n\nWhy this sort of Gothic horror was rarely on British cinema screens is dumbfounding. So many Godawful films from the seventies and yet this played on TVs. This manages to be a strange, creepy little tale decades later with a sexuality that's still transgressive to it, and it was shown around Christmas time on the BBC!\n\nIt's also quite an ingenious and original tale as well. Already based on an interesting premise from Sheridan Le Fanu's original story, basing a fictitious plot around a real Dutch painter, this was screened after a documentary series about art as a hybrid between a documentary on Schalacken's art and a fictitious ghost story. This is even more inspired in hindsight to how this…\n\nThis is a film I first saw around four years ago. At the time I found it slightly disappointing, especially compared to some of the other BFI Flipside titles released for the same genre. I’d expected a more cinematic horror film, like later Flipside titles, Symptoms (1973) and The Appointment (1982), whereas this is very much a TV production in scale and scope.\n\nAs such, it’s limited by its exclusive use of studio interiors and lack of establishing shots, which gives the film a very stagey, hermetic quality. It also fumbles its biggest horror set piece by having lead actor Jeremy Clyde show terror in an artificial, slightly pantomimic fashion, which struck me as unintentionally amusing (and as such robbed…"
