        "text": "NOW PLAYING\n\nThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert *** (Palo Alto Square, Century 12) In this original, entertaining telling of the show-must-go-on legend, there is energy, chutzpah and charm to spare. Felicia, Mitzi and Bernadette--two transvestites and one transsexual--have a cabaret act that consists of lip-syncing to tapes while strutting about in Carmen Miranda-goes-disco costumes. The three set out from Sydney, Australia for a gig in Alice Springs. Drinking, bitching, sewing costumes and rehearsing, they wind their way through Australia's vast outback. This may sound like a drag to you, but you don't know Felicia, Mitzi and Bernadette (Guy Pearce, Hugo Weaving and Terence Stamp, respectively). Supremely self-aware, devoted to style and performance, and as acid-tongued as Margo Channing, they are a very funny and very appealing trio--an act you shouldn't miss. Rated R. --L.S.\n\nThe Advocate * (Aquarius) It is no secret that Western civilization went through a bad thousand years following the fall of Rome. Yet Leslie Megahey treats every ugly aspect of life in medieval France as if it were a fresh new stain on the human race--as if it were news that 1,500 years ago, cruelty, superstition and intolerance were flourishing in Europe. The particular ugliness of the period that Megahey revels in shocking us with is the custom of trying animals in a court of law, then hanging them if they were found guilty. At the center of \"The Advocate\" is the trial of a pig that has been falsely accused of trampling a young boy. But the pig's case is only an excuse to show us in gruesome detail the landed gentry's callous exploitation of the ignorance of peasants and the church's indifference to the injustice. Self-righteous in his condemnation of the elite and elitist in his contempt for the ignorant, Megahey panders to his audience with a sensationalized telling of an ugly story while pretending to be shocked by what he reveals. Rated R. --L.S.\n\nAndre ** (Century 16, UA 6) The title character's balletic swimming, gallumphing gait, Bronx cheers and armchair \"comments\" on TV episodes of Rin Tin Tin, provide a lot of good, sweet fun. Keith Carradine plays the harbormaster of a Maine village, a devoted husband and father whose youngest is a shy 9-year-old girl. Enter (into a household already stocked like the ark) the orphaned Andre. Against a familiar backdrop of a stalwart mom, sibling tiffs and mean grade school teachers, Andre and the girl become pals, and the familiar questions arise about Andre's ultimate fate. While all this is sunny, breezy and bright as a New England spring, it's hit-or-miss: the plot no sooner swims off in one direction than it does a back flip, juggling a new \"problem\" on its nose. Rated PG (minor handholding during a few scary parts). --M.V.\n\nAngels in the Outfield ** (UA 6) This film has forlorn foster kids, a colorful baseball manager (Danny Glover) and a washed-up pitcher (Tony Danza) who gets a second chance with the pennant on the line. It's got those frisky angels, led by the by now expectedly loopy Christopher Lloyd, who swoop down to lend a wing whenever the team needs a two-run homer or an important strikeout. It's even got some of that old Disney magic, which unfortunately gets lost in the sticky sentimentality the movie doles out like Cracker Jacks. Rated PG. --N.M.\n\nBarcelona *** (Park) Witty and well-written, \"Barcelona\" is the second film for writer-director Whit Stillman, who made his debut with the sophisticated \"Metropolitan.\" Fred (Chris Eigman) arrives uninvited at the Barcelona home of his cousin, Ted (Taylor Nichols). Fred, an overgrown brat, tells Ted's girlfriends that Ted wears titillating leather straps in his underwear and practices the sexual teachings of the Marquis de Sade. He steals Ted's cash, his alcohol and ultimately his girlfriend. As the cousins work out their past, present and future, they ponder the deep philosophy of sales, the virtues of homely women and the cultural significance of the hamburger. As the movie demonstrates, interesting characters and good writing can do more for a movie than an entire reel-full of flashy gimmickry. --D.S.\n\nBlankman * (UA 6) The title tells all. This low-rent comedy delivers a nerdy man-child who runs around in a homemade costume and comes up blank when asked his name. Damon Wayans (\"In Living Color\") wields plenty of power as executive producer, co-writer and star, but creates a wimp of a hero. Imagine Jerry Lewis in a flowered cape and a mask made of socks trying to survive in the urban jungle. Although he stands for \"everyman who looks out his window, sees something wrong and does something about it,\" the fact is that he's just as likely to get slapped around as to overcome his diabolical foes. Worse yet, Blankman and his low-tech inventions are not funny. Rated PG-13. --S.T.\n\nClear and Present Danger **** (Century 16, Century 12) Intelligent plotting, swift bursts of action and an appealing performance by Harrison Ford make this the summer's most satisfying action entertainment. Ford plays Jack Ryan, a CIA bureaucrat who unexpectedly becomes the agency's acting director, as the president of the United States initiates a politically motivated covert operation against a Colombian drug lord. A danger to the president's men, who fear he many reveal their misdeeds, and an enemy to the Colombian drug lords, who make him a scapegoat as they double-cross each other, Ryan finds himself the pawn in a series of overlapping chess games. To their credit, director Phillip Noyce (\"Patriot Games\") and his cadre of screenwriters avoid the pretense of caring about the evils of drugs and politics. Instead, they keep the film firmly focused on the chess games, and they also keep it moving. Rated R. --L.S.\n\nThe Client ** (Century 16, Century 12) More an exercise in sensationalism than suspense, the plot involves a boy (Brad Renfro) whose accidental encounter with a mob lawyer puts him in danger. But in place of drama, author John Grisham and director Joel Schumacher have concocted a string of hyperbolic scenes that simply sensationalizes such current hot buttons as abusive fathers, latchkey kids, morally bankrupt politicians, unscrupulous attorneys, sleazeball journalists and career criminals. (In the film's most cynical moment, a mother, on discovering her child in a coma, bemoans her lack of health insurance.) Tommy Lee Jones, as the prosecuting attorney, and Susan Sarandon, as an attorney who tries to protect the boy, give solid performances. Rated R. --L.S.\n\nColor of Night * (Century 16, Century 12) Director Richard Rush, whose last film \"The Stunt Man\" was a success in 1980, returns from an extended hiatus to give us \"Color of Night,\" a confusing mess of starts and stops, gory violence and steamy sex. It's hard to care who did it in this whodunnit \"thriller.\" Bruce Willis stars as Bill Capa, a psychiatrist trying to get over the suicide of a patient. After an old friend winds up dead, Capa takes over a suspicious Monday night therapy group and does a little sleuthing on the side to find his friend's killer. Capa's smart-alecky, smirking approach to his patients' therapy wipes out any of his forced sensitivity. To add some sexual interest, Jane March (\"The Lover\") does a little Jacuzzi diving with Willis. Rated R. --S.I.\n\nCorrina, Corrina *** (Century 16, UA 6) Loosely based on writer/director Jessie Nelson's childhood, the unassumingly titled \"Corrina, Corrina\" is highlighted by strong performances by Whoopi Goldberg, Ray Liotta and Tina Majorino. Seven-year-old Molly (Majorino) hasn't spoken a word since her mother's death, and her father (Liotta), while trying to deal with his own grief, worries about finding a caretaker for his daughter when he returns to work. Goldberg shines in this role, playing her trademark compassionate caretaker character with understated grace. The outcome is predictable, and there are some heavy doses of schmaltz, but the cinematic journey to the happy ending is full of gems, not the least of which is a fabulous soundtrack highlighted by the likes of Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Sara Vaughn and Billie Holiday. Rated PG. --S.I.\n\nEat Drink Man Woman ** 1/2 (Guild) This film from Ang Lee does for Chinese food what \"Babette's Feast,\" \"Tampopo\" and \"Like Water For Chocolate\" did for French, Japanese and Mexican cuisine. Ang (\"The Wedding Banquet\") is making his mark probing the chasms between Chinese children and parents, men and women, and past and present. This time, he adds misconceptions about the elderly to the mix. Set in Taipei, the story follows the lives and meals of a widower and his three daughters. Taiwan has changed, children have changed, even Chinese cooking has changed. As a result, the widower has lost his sense of taste, and seems to be on the verge of losing his taste for life as well. Unlike the food, the movie's central drama takes a while to heat up, but offers lovely rewards at the end. Not rated. --D.S.\n\nForrest Gump * (Century 16, Century 12) Other fictional protagonists have had odd endowments, living as cockroaches, or with outsized thumbs. But why are we asked to feel for Forrest Gump when his only \"sympathetic\" trait is his defect? And why are we asked simultaneously to laugh at him for his defect? Is it really funny that Forrest thinks \"coon\" means raccoon? Or that, while visiting the Oval Office, he has to pee? Through his ineptitude and the magic of digitalization, Forrest is inserted into political upheavals and photo-ops: it was really he who broke Watergate, he who stood behind George Wallace on the Tuscaloosa campus. But it's one thing to refract history through a made-up bit player; it's another to trivialize the civil rights struggle or the Vietnam War, or to remark \"simply\" of the Kennedy killings, \"It must be hard, being brothers.\" Rated PG-13. --M.V.\n\nFresh *** (Palo Alto Square, UA 6) Like \"Menace II Society\" and \"Mi Vida Loca,\" \"Fresh\" is a well-written, well-acted tale of life in the ghetto. This directorial debut by Boaz Yakin works its disturbing magic with all-too-realistic violence and finely drawn characters. The protagonist is a 12-year-old boy named Fresh (Sean Nelson). Living in a group foster home, he starts each day by picking up his stash from the neighborhood drug lords, all the while worrying about being late to school. Fresh doesn't do drugs, he just sells them, stashing his earnings in a tin can down by the railroad tracks. His two mentors are the local heroin king (Giancarlo Esposito), who tells him, \"The heroin business is like banking, only more secure,\" and his alcoholic chess-whiz father (Samuel Jackson). Rated R. --N.M.\n\nIt Could Happen to You ** (Century 16, Century 12) Good things happen to good people--or so director Andrew Bergman wants viewers to believe with \"It Could Happen to You.\" Nice-guy cop Charlie Lang (Nicolas Cage) winds up at a cafe short of cash for a tip. He promises the possible proceeds of a lottery ticket to the disgruntled waitress (Bridget Fonda). The inevitable happens and Charlie and wife Miranda (Rosie Perez) split their $4 million with the waitress. Bergman shows that good-hearted folks get better with money, and evil people get nastier. The message is predictable. Interestingly, in a film about the virtues of \"good,\" Perez, as Charlie's greedy, snotty wife, is the movie's savior. Rated PG. --S.I.\n\nThe Lion King *** 1/2 (Century 16, Century 12) Disney's 32nd animated feature delivers everything you've been expecting: an engaging story, endearing characters, a feast for the senses and a good, strong moral as well. Young lion cub Simba (voice by Jonathan Taylor Thomas) learns a devastating lesson about responsibility and pride when his father (James Earl Jones) is killed. An older Simba (Matthew Broderick) realizes he must face his duties and rightful place in the \"circle of life.\" Simba's villainous uncle, Scar, is played to the hilt by Jeremy Irons. The soundtrack is rhythmic and strong, but the tribal chant-like songs aren't nearly as memorable as those in \"Beauty and the Beast\" or \"Aladdin.\" Rated G. --S.I.\n\nThe Little Rascals ** (Century 16, Century 12) The transition from the classic black-and-white short features to the full-color version of the \"The Little Rascals\" is a bit shaky, but it manages to keep some of the original's charm. As you might expect, there's not much of a story here: Spanky, Buckwheat, Porky and the rest of the He-Man Woman-Haters Club set out to destroy Alfalfa's budding romance with Darla. Director Penelope Spheeris mixes old costumes with new and outdated language with today's slang, all the while sending the timeless message: Kids will be kids. Rated PG. --S.I.\n\nThe Mask *** (Century 16, Century 12) Jim Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss, a mild-mannered bank officer who finds an exotic mask that, when worn, transforms him into a cartoon-like superhero. We've never seen anything quite like this before, as Carrey's already oversized mannerisms are enhanced, not hidden, by makeup and wondrous special effects. Writer Mike Werb and director Charles Russell (\"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3\") have fashioned a film full of every cliche in the book--but here, in the context of this character, they actually work: lovable dog Milo is Carrey's most loyal friend, the love interest is a voluptuous lounge singer (Cameron Diaz), the obvious moral is about our true selves behind the mask. Rated PG-13. --N.M.\n\nMilk Money * (Century 16, Century 12) How Hollywood seems to get so much mileage out of the naive hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold theme is beyond understanding, especially when the tired premise is applied to such a trashy pre-teen sex romp as this weak effort from director Richard Benjamin. Melanie Griffith once again dons her skin-tight skirt and stiletto heels to play Vee, a hooker in a mess with her pimp. Along comes 12-year-old Frank (Michael Patrick Carter) and his buddies, who pool their allowances in order to pay Vee to strip for them. And it gets worse: in a laughable attempt at giving this puerile flick a \"wholesome\" disguise, Frank decides his lonely father (Ed Harris) would be a great match for Vee, and he proceeds to try to get them together. Rated PG-13. --M.H.\n\nNatural Born Killers * (Century 16, Century 12) America's obsession with tabloid television and with the psychopaths whose lives the shows sensationalize is the ostensible target of Oliver Stone's latest bombastic and self-righteous exploration of evil. His real theme, however, is a much simpler one: Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me daring to go to the darkest regions of America's soul, where sex and serial killing come together. While pretending to attack tabloid television, Stone seems intent on outdoing it, then priding himself on his disgust. Stone may think he has made an art film, but the finished product looks more like a parody of an MTV video. For the record, Woody Harrelson is presentable and Juliette Lewis is unbearable in the thankless roles. Rated R. --L.S.\n\nSpanking the Monkey **** (Aquarius) Completely original and perversely funny, this film is a black, black comedy about a young man's re-engagement with his dysfunctional family after a year at MIT. Raymond (Jeremy Davies) stops off at home to find his father (Benjamin Hendrickson) headed off on a summerlong business trip and his mother (Alberta Watson) with a thigh-to-toe cast and in need of Raymond's care. For mom, an intelligent but manipulative woman who has been clinically depressed since the day she got married, a broken leg is just the excuse she needs to demand from her son all the things her husband no longer provides. (All the things.) What gives the picture resonance is the witty screenplay and delicate direction of writer/director David O. Russell, who creates a dark comic vision of hell. Not rated, but very adult. --L.S."
