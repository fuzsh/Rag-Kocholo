        "text": "Hungarian poet, screenwriter, playwright, film critic, director, the author of the libretto for Béla Bartók's Bluebeard's Castle (1912) and the story for the The Wooden Prince (1917). Béla Balázs's Der sichtbare Mensch (1924) is considered the first major work in silent film aesthetics. Balázs also wrote the scripts for more than two dozen films, including Die Abenteuer eines Zehmarkscheines (1926), a pioneering work of the Neue Sachlichkeit (new objectivity), and Das blaue Licht (1932), directed by Leni Riefenstahl.\n\n\"Every art alweays deals with human beings, it is a human manifestation and presents human beings. To paraphrase Marx: 'The root of all art is man'. When the film close-up strips the veil of our imperceptiveness and insensitivity from the hidden little things and shows us the face of objects, it still shows us man, for what makes objects expressive are the human expressions projected on to them.\" (from Theory of the Film (Character and Growth of a New Art) by Béla Balázs, translated from the Hungarian by Edith Bone, Dennis Dobson, MCMLII, p. 60)\n\nBéla Balázs was born Herbert Bauer in Szeged, the son of Simon Bauer, a teacher and translator, and Jenny (Levy) Bauer, also a teacher. Due to his liberal opinions, Simon Bauer was moved to Lõcse, a small town in the northern part of the country, where he died suddenly from stomach cancer in 1897. Balázs's mother returned with her three children to Szeged. While still at school, Balázs published his first writings in the local paper, using the pseudonym Béla Balázs, but he encouraged his closer acquaintances to call him by his original name. Because he was Jewish, he was not permitted to participate in religion class. After graduating from the gymnasium, he moved in 1902 to Budapest.\n\nBalázs studied at the famous Eötvös Collegium, where his roommate was the future composer Zoltán Kodály. Among his friends was also Béla Bartók, with whom he traveled in the countryside collecting folk music. Though Balázs admired Bartók's musical gifts, they never became truly close friends. \"Apart from his music,\" Balázs once confessed in his diary, \"I am able to enjoy little about him.\" ('Bluebeard as Theater: The Influence of Maeterlinck and Hebbel on Balázs's Bluebeard Drama' by Carl Leafstedt, in Bartók and His World, edited by Peter Laki, Princeton University Press, 1995, p. 123)\n\nBálazs continued his studies in Berlin and in Paris. He participated in Berlin in George Simmel's private seminar; 'Halálesztétika' (1907, The Aesthetics of Death), his most important essay from this period, was dedicated to Simmel. For Balázs, death gave meaning to life and art. \"The awareness of death makes us aware of life; art is born at the point when life becomes aware of death; art stems from the transcendental instinct of man, from a longing to overstep the limits of everyday reality.\" (Bartók and the Grotesque: Studies in Modernity, the Body and Contradiction in Music by Julie Brown, 2007, pp. 62-63)\n\nWhile a doctoral student, Balázs started to contribute essays to the magazine Nyugat (West), which soon developed into a leading forum of the cultural world in Hungary. Bálazs received his doctorate in German philologt from the University of Budapest for a dissertation entitled Hebbel Frigyes pántragizmusa, mint a romantikus világnézet eredménye (Friedrich Hebbel's Pan-Tragicness, as a Result of the Romantic Worldview). It was published under his real name Herbert Bauer.\n\nDoctor Szélpal Margit (1909), his first play, was performed at the National Theatre, without much success. In 1910 Balázs finished his third play, A kékszakàllú herceg vára (Duke Bluebeard's Castle), which was influenced by symbolist technique and the dramas of Maurice Maeterlinck, such as Ariane and Barbe Bleue (1901). Balázs's libretto of Béla Bartók's famous opera was first performed in 1913. The composer himself had a high regard for his opera, but he never talked much of his cooperation with Balázs. Moreover, Balázs lost contact with him during the decades when he was a persona non grata in Hungary.\n\nFairy tales inspired several of Balázs's works, but not because of their depiction of the eternal battle between good and evil. Balázs's interest was in the thin line between reality and fantasy, and the search for meaning behind phenomena. In Duke Bluebeard's Castlethe duke's new wife wants to open the dark doors of the castle, and bring light into their life. She reveals the horrible secrets of her husband, and eventually the Duke is left alone in the darkness. \"Bluebeard's castle is not a realistic stone castle,\" Bálazs explained. \"The castle is his soul. It is lonely, dark, and secretive: the castle of locked doors. . . . Into this castle, into his own soul, Bluebeard admits his beloved. And the castle (the stage) shudders, sighs, and bleeds. When the woman walks into it, she walks into a living being.\" (Bluebeard: A Reader's Guide to the English Tradition by Casie E. Hermansson, 2009, p. 141) Another central theme in Balázs's works was the sense of loneliness, which he dealt with, among others, in the short story 'Die Geschichte von der Logodygasse von Frühling, vom Tod und der Ferne' (1912). Der Mantel der Träume (1922), \"Chinese\" styled fairy tales, was inspired by the illustrations of Mariette Lydis. .\n\nWhen World War I broke out, Balázs volunteered for the Hungarian arm. For the surprise of his friends, he proclaimed on the pages of the Nyugat, that this war was sacret. Before becoming seriously ill with endocarditis, he served at the Serbian front. From his diaries Bálazs collected the anti-war book Lélek a háborúban (1916, Soul in the War). In December 1915 Balázs joined The Budapest Sunday Circle, led by the philosopher and literary theoretician György Lukács (1885-1971).\n\nThe Sunday Circle was a loose association of radical intellectuals, thinkers, and artists. Its members included Karl Mannheim, the art historian Arnold Hauser, the writer Anna Leznai, and the musicians Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály. Also Balázs's first wife, Edith Hajós, and Anna Schlamadinger, his second wife, attended the meetings. Usually the group met at Balázs's elegant apartment or the Lukács's country estate and discussed about the end of the liberal society.\n\nIn 1919 Hungary was for 133 days a communist republic under Béla Kun, whose government was brought to end by the intervention from Romania and Czechoslovakia. Balázs was forced into exile with his wife, Anna Schlamadinger, as a fellow traveler of the Communists. He settled in Vienna, like a number of other exiles, including Sándor Korda (Sir Alexander Korda), Mihály Kertész (Michael Curtiz), László Vajda, Paul Czinner, and Bela Lugosi. Balázs cooperated with the director Hans Otto Löwenstein (1881-1931) in several film projects.\n\nFrom 1922 Bálazs contributed film reviews to the newspaper Der Tag, founded by Sigmund Bosel. In 1924 he published his first book of film theory, Der Sichtbare Mensch (The Visible Man). This collection of articles drew much attention and was translated into 11 languages.\n\nBalázs emphasized that the moving pictures brought back the language the body and the expressions of the human face, which had been buried by the culture of books and words. \"Facial expression is the most subjective manifestation of man, more subjective than speech,\" Balázs argued. (Theory of the Film, p. 60) The close-up was for Balázs the most essential feature of the film art, which separated it from all other arts, especially from the theatre. \"Not even the greatest writer, the most consummate artist of the pen could tell in words what Asta Nielsen tells with her face in close-up as she sits down to her mirror and tries to make up for the last time her aged, wrinkled face, riddled with poverty, misery, disease and prostitution, when she is expecting her lover, released after ten years in jail; a lover who has retained his youth in captivity because life could not touch him there.\" (Ibid., pp. 65-66)\n\nMuch later, in 1939 Balázs wrote in the essay 'Das Filmszenarium, eine neue literarische Gattung' that the screenplay is an independent and a new form of literature, and emphasized the role of the writer as the auteur of the film. In Theory of the Film (1952), which was first published in Moscow in 1945 as The Art of Cinema, Balázs developed his earlier ideas and used writings produced at the State Film Institute.\n\nBalázs was regarded as one of the leading critics of his day, but his sharp opinions clashed with the interest of the film producers and directors, and he was forced to resign from Der Tag. The mid-1920s also saw the decline of the Austrian film industry.\n\nIn 1926 Balázs went to Berlin, where he was involved in a number of activities; at times he was so overburdened that he cried for exhaustion. He directed the Workers' Theatre Group, the Arbeitertheaterbund, wrote plays and film scripts, lectured, and cooperated in left-wing film projects with the director G.W. Pabst, the producer Erwin Piscator, and the writer Bertolt Brecht. He declared that the \"crowd is the soul and the significance of stage plays,\" a view that influenced Piscator's Total Theatre productions. (Erwin Piscator's Political Theatre: The Development of Modern German Drama by C. D. Innes, 1972, p. 141)\n\nMost of Balázs's essays were published during this period in Die Rote Fahne, Film und Volk, and Linkskurv, and Die Weltbühne. Die Abenteur Eines Zehnmarkscheines (1928), Balázs's first screenplay in Germany focused on a ten-mark note, which passes from hand to hand amidst diverse characters in Berlin. The cool analysis of money was softened by the production company with a love story between two young workers.\n\nDreigroschenoper (1930), based on Brecht's famous play, caused Balázs troubles. The original screenplay for the film was written by Leo Lania and László Vajda. When Brecht did not like the adaptation, Balázs tried to improve the script. Eventually Brecht sued the production company, but he lost the case, and accepted a sizable settlement. The film was a popular success.\n\nDas blaue Licht (The Blue Light), co-written by Leni Riefenstahl, Carl Mayer (not credited), and Hans Schneeberger, was set on the Alps. According to Riefenstahl, Balázs was so excited about her treatment that he was willing to co-author the script without a fee. Mayer, F.W. Murnau's writer, finished the script. Balázs possibly directed the scenes involving Riefenstahl. After the war, Riefenstahl claimed responsibility for \"script, direction, and art direction.\"\n\nThe story was about the struggle between beauty and materialism, illusion and realism. Riefenstahl played a beautiful woman, Junta, who knows the secret of the mysterious light high on the mountains, which tempts young people into death. The film was admired by both Hitler and Chaplin, but criticized in the west-wing newspapers. Later Riefenstahl gained fame for her visually brilliant films, such as Triumph of the Will (1935), produced by order of the Führer, and Olympia (1938), about the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games.\n\nWhen the Nazis came into power, Balázs left Vienna for the Soviet Union, where he taught film aesthetics at Moscow's State Film Institute from 1933 to 1945. In the late 1930s he wrote the screenplay for Die Löwin, based on a novel by Ferdinand Ossendowski. Die Löwin was shot in Algiers. When the director went to France with the film, its material was confiscated and destroyed by the customs officials.\n\nThe years in the Soviet Union were bitter for Balázs. He was attacked by orthodox, Stalinist ideologists, and also Lukács turned his back to him; Lukács did not believe in his friend's commitment to communism. In 1939 Balázs wrote a poem for Stalin, 'Auf ein Stalinbild' (Dem Genius der Freiheit: Dichtungen um Stalin, zusgest. u. red. von Erich Weinert, 1939), but even this flattering piece could not guarantee his personal safety. Like others working in the cultural field, during World War II Balázs was evacuated to Alma Ata in Kazakhstan, where he collected folk poetry, later published in Das Goldene Zelt (1956).\n\nAfter the war the communists gained control of government in Hungary, and Balázs returned to his native country, helping to rebuild its film industry. Balázs taught at the Academy of Theatre and Film Arts, and continued writing scripts, although his projects were turned down - by the communists he was considered a \"bourgeois\" theorist and author. He also lectured on films in Poland and at Prague University. Valahol Európában (1947, Somewhere in Europe), directed by Geza von Radvànyi, was Balázs's most succesful achievement. The story dealt with orphaned children in post-war Europe. Ének a búzamezõkrõl (1947, Song of the Corn Field), in which he worked with the director István Szõts and the screenwriter Lázsló Ranódy, was forbidden as \"religious reaction propaganda\". Balázs died in Budapest on May 17, 1949, in the same year when the opposition political parties were outlawed. After his death, the Béla Balázs studio for young experimental film-makers was opened in 1959 in Budapest.\n\nFor further reading: Balàzs és akinek nem kell by György Lukács (1918); 'Béla Balázs' by Guido Aristarco, in Bianco e Nero, June (1949); Balázs Béla világa by M.K.
