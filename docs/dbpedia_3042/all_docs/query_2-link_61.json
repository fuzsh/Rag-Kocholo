        "text": "A film by Leslie Megahey\n\nTHE FLIPSIDE: rescuing weird and wonderful British films from obscurity and presenting them in new high-quality editions.\n\nWorld premiere of this highly sought-after ghost story from the BBC, released in the BFI’s acclaimed Flipside series.\n\nBased on a short story by Sheridan Le Fanu, Schalcken the Painter was originally shown in the Omnibus strand on BBC 2 during Christmas 1979. The story follows a young seventeenth century Flemish painter Godfried Schalcken, who forsakes love for ambition, but discovers that there is still a terrible price to pay for his choice.\n\nOne of the most frequently requested programmes in the BBC archive, .Schalcken the Painter is an exquisitely shot, atmospheric horror film which explores the uneasy, dark relationship between art, commerce and erotic desire.\n\nThe superb cast includes Jeremy Clyde, Maurice Denman and Cheryl Kennedy.\n\nNewly transferred to High Definition from the film materials preserved in the BFI National Archive, the release includes such as the rare, experimental Edgar Allan Poe adaptation, The Pit (1962), assistant directed by Peter Collinson.\n\nDVD PAL Region 2\n\nBlu-Ray Region B\n\nSpecial Features"
