        "text": "One of the greatest of all medieval films, not least for its utterly distinctive realisation of a recognisable yet alien world, Walerian Borowczyk's third feature was widely hailed as a masterpiece from the moment it first appeared and is still regarded as one of his greatest films.\n\nBased on Juliusz S?owacki's 19th-century play Mazepa but relocated to 13th-century France, Blanche tells the story of the beautiful young wife (Ligia Branice) of a nobleman many decades older (French acting legend Michel Simon). As innocent as her name suggests, Blanche becomes the unwilling centre of attention in a power struggle between her husband, the visiting King and his page, the latter a notorious womaniser. Its unique visual style resembles a medieval fresco, and its period-instruments soundtrack, adapting the ancient 'Carmina Burana' song book, was years ahead of its time.\n\nBlanche is presented in a brand new high-definition restoration from original 35mm elements.\n\nSpecial Features"
