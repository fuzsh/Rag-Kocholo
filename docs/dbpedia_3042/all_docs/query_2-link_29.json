DATE: Wednesday, February 8, 1995 TAG: 9502080716 SECTION: DAILY BREAK PAGE: E7 EDITION: FINAL TYPE: Movie review SOURCE: BY MAL VINCENT MOVIE CRITIC LENGTH: Medium: 62 lines\n\n``THE ADVOCATE'' FULL OF ENTERTAINING TWISTS\n\nWHOEVER SAID it would be easy getting out of the Dark Ages?\n\n``The Advocate'' is a fun little film that plays games much in the way ``Widow's Peak'' did. There are a few neat plot twists that are entertaining even if they are concocted.\n\nThe setting is medieval France (circa 1400) before the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. A big-city lawyer comes from Paris to the small village of Abbeville to get away from the pressure and stress of it all. Immediately, as a defense lawyer (the advocate of the title), he gets involved in cases concerning murder, rape and witchcraft. Abbeville is the medieval equivalent of Peyton Place!\n\nColin Firth, a dashing and rugged actor who never quite seems to cross over into the realm of major star, has the role of Courtois, the lawyer. (Notably, he had the lead in ``Valmont,'' the film that was better than ``Dangerous Liaisons'' but which no one saw).\n\nAmong his duties here is that all the major female characters strip for him. He reacts appropriately.\n\nThe supporting cast is made up of some of England's more prominent character actors. There is Nicol Williamson as a powerful local merchant and Ian Holm as the wise but cynical priest. Also watch for the late Donald Pleasence (``Halloween''). Amina Annabi is the most prominent of the female exhibitionists, playing a beautiful gypsy girl.\n\nMiramax attempted, foolishly, to promote this as having some sort of ``Crying Game'' ending - a curious choice since, in the film's prologue, there is all the information. There is ample fun, but a ``surprise'' ending is not included.\n\nAmong the irreverence is the fact that modern slang is often sprinkled amid the medieval talk - a style that borrows liberally from ``The Lion in Winter.''\n\nIf you'd like to get away from the O.J. over-coverage, here's a different, and unique, kind of legal game. It's not an important film - merely a little, and diverting, one. ILLUSTRATION: Photo\n\nMIRAMAX\n\nAmina Annabi and Colin Firth star in ``The Advocate,'' a fun little\n\nfilm with clever plot twists set in medieval France.\n\nGraphic\n\nMOVIE REVIEW\n\n``The Advocate''\n\nCast: Colin Firth, Lysette Anthony, Ian Holm, Donald Pleasence,\n\nNicol Williamson\n\nDirector and Writer: Leslie Megahey\n\nMPAA rating: R (nudity, language)\n\nMal's rating: Three stars\n\nLocation: Naro in Norfolk\n\nby CNB"
