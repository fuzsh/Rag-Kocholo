        "text": "Set in 15th-century France and featuring a dignified English cast, \"The Advocate\" begins with what looks like a pretty fair Monty Python moment. A man is fitted with a noose, about to be executed for having had \"carnal knowledge of the she-ass here present.\" By his side, and also about to be hanged, is a sexually complicit donkey, since this story is set at a time when animals and inanimate objects could be tried under civil law.\n\nWhen a last-minute pardon arrives, it's not for the man but for his impassive-looking consort. \"She is released without stain to her character,\" intones a solemn magistrate (Michael Gough), who then presides over the man's execution. Decked out in face grime and a fancy array of medieval millinery, the local peasants watch eagerly as justice is done.\n\nUnfortunately, \"The Advocate\" proves not to be particularly playful about such events. As an earnest, leeringly ribald foray into arcane legal history, with an emphasis on four-legged defendants, its main selling points turn out to be crassness and curiosity value. Anachronisms are also worth notice: \"The Advocate\" could well prompt speculation about whether early lawyers actually paced the courtroom like 20th-century television stars, or whether there were silicone breast implants during the late Middle Ages.\n\nMiramax, this film's distributor, has tried its best to invite comparison with \"The Crying Game,\" suggesting that \"The Advocate\" has a big secret in store. But in fact, for all its legal exotica, this film is so ordinary in visual style and basic story line that it holds few surprises. As for the mysterious identity of one defense client, let's just say that \"The Advocate\" was released in England as \"The Hour of the Pig\" and that its barnyard-cum-courtroom ambiance loses novelty very quickly. An audience's enjoyment of \"The Crying Game\" truly depended on keeping that film's secret, but there's no comparable revelation here.\n\nDirected with wavering degrees of levity by Leslie Megahey, whose previous credits are in radio and television, \"The Advocate\" follows the adventures of its title character, a Parisian lawyer named Richard Courtois (Colin Firth), who travels to a small country town to become a public defender. Along with his idealism, he brings a remarkable assortment of hats, which come close to upstaging the finer points of the law.\n\nThe town is controlled by a sardonic, acid-tongued feudal lord (Nicol Williamson) who has bought his title thanks to great success in business and who retains such privileges as the right to preside over civil trials. The film's interest in such historical data, and in the tensions between the church's and the state's separate legal systems, is matched by equal interest in co-ed medieval bathhouses, rollicking wenches and dungeons where the prisoners are left naked.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
