        "text": "Cinema The Advocate (1993)\n\nThis film is noted here because of the introduction of a fictional secret society. While the lawyer, Richard Courtois, searches for clues to explain the murder of a young boy, he is briefly suspicious of the local seigneur, Jehan d'Auferre, who has told him that he has a brotherhood which he describes as \"a kind of a guild.\" Although the purpose of this group of regional seigneurs is only to control local markets and negotiate commodity prices, the lawyer's clerk suggests, without evidence, that the group is derived from the heretical Cathars and the Templars, disbanded in 1312. Within the story, this adds another red herring to Courtois' enquiries, but the unfounded accusation of a secret society involved in killing children [01:03:00] would also have resonated with audiences in the early 1990s, especially those who were aware of the growing popularity of conspiratorial interpretations of history, often targeting Freemasonry and an erroneous belief in it's Templar origins, and those aware of the Satanic Ritual Abuse moral panic of the previous decade. The Hour of the Pig (original title). Directed and written by Leslie Megahey. Colin Firth, Ian Holm, Donald Pleasence, Amina Annabi, Nicol Williamson, Michael Gough, Harriet Walter, Jim Carter, Lysette Anthony, Sophie Dix, Vincent Grass, Elizabeth Spriggs, Raoul Delfosse, Justin Chadwick, Jean-Pierre Stewart. France | UK, English, 102 min, Dolby, Rankcolor Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)\n\nThe anti-masonic website freedomdomain.com/freemason.html (2000/08/18 - 2007/06/06), in an attempt to find masonic references, makes the following aside:\n\n\"Note : How many of you saw the new Austin Powers movie \"The Spy who Shagged Me\" and caught the part with the Shriner wearing the \"Fez\" Cap that was chasing Austin in the car? Austin even makes a comment about the \"Fez\" cap giving him away. He states he cannot reveal the hideout of Dr. Evil unless asked 3 times. And then states he does not like being asked anything 3 times. \"\n\nIn fact, neither the dialogue nor costume suggest a masonic or Shriner allusion. Will Ferrell as Mustafa, an assassin dressed in gray suit, black tie, white shirt and red fez with tassle, has a brief exchange with Mike Myers as Austin Powers:\n\nMustafa: Do you remember me, Austin Powers? Powers: I don't recall your name but your fez is familiar. [laughs] Mustafa later says: \"I can't stand to be asked the same question three times. It just irritates me.\"\n\nOnly Mr. Meyers knows for sure if this is a coincidence, but it must also be noted that Mustafa is defined almost entirely by his wearing the fez, being in pain, and begging for medical help with injuries of the kind that, if he were a child, he could have treated for free at Shriners' hospitals.

USA, EnglishÊ| Cantonese, 99 min, Dolby, Colour. Brigham Young (1940)\n\n\"Oh Lord, my God...\" [00:24:00] Perhaps notable is the complete omission in the film of any masonic reference. It has often been remarked that Smith's final words are part of a masonic expression: \"Oh Lord my God, is there no help for the widow's son?\" But the couplet, \"O Lord my God\" appears in nineteen verses in the Bible, many of which were incorporated into early hymns and prayers. The couplet appeared frequently in the writings of Augustine (354-430), Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) and Anselm (1033-1109). Directed by Henry Hathaway, written by Louis Bromfield, Lamar Trotti.

Broadway Melody of 1940 (1940)\n\nIn a discussion about honesty and trustworthiness,George Murphy, as King Shaw, says to Fred Astaire, playing Johnny Brett: \"Its a question of being on the level.\" [00:29:50] Variations on this expression are also heard in almost every movie that the comedy team of Abbott and Costello made between 1940 and 1942. Expressions about being level or square are also common in most film noir, perhaps reflecting a criminal patois of the period.

Broom-stick Bunny (1955)\n\nIn this cartoon short, Bugs Bunny defends himself from Witch Hazel, who has a certificate from the \"Malevolent Order of Witches A. F. of Elves\".

The rings hidden insignia, known as the Cross Lorraine, was actually adopted by Charles De Gaule to identify the Free French Movement. Similar to the patriarchal cross, borne before the Patriarch in the Roman Church, it is also often mistaken for the cross made use of by the modern officers of the Grand Encampment of Knights Templar of the United States.

Freemasons are referred to as \"bok ryers\" or \"antelope riders\" in South Africa, an allusion to riding the goat. [00:54:18] Just because this was filmed in South Africa, there is no reason to conclude that this is a masonic reference. Directed by Neill Blomkamp, written by Neill Blomkamp, Terri Tatchell.

Dracula (1992)\n\nA costume design by Eiko Ishioka has led to a mistaken report of masonic symbolism. [01:43:55] Seen only briefly, and in shadow, it appears to be a decorative apron. Oscar winning designer Ishioka has said that she found inspiration in Kabuki theatre costume but the origins of this particular apron with what may be a Saint George Cross are unknown.

The clasped hands image was a common depiction of Christian fortitude while also being adopted by such fraternities as the Orange Lodge, Odd Fellows and Freemasons as a sign of brotherhood or solidarity.

[00:48:00] According to the DVD commentary, the \"church\" scene [00:47:00 - 00:51:00] was filmed in Freemason's Hall in London.

I'm Going to Tell You a Secret (2005)\n\nA documentary of Madonnas Re-Invention Tour 2004 shows an image used as part of the stage set: an image of Isis, wearing a cross, seated between two pillars marked with a \"B\" and \"J\". The pillars depict those found at the entrance of King Solomons Temple (2 Chronicles 3:17) and as such are more an indication of Madonnas interest in Judaism and Tarot than a reference to Freemasonry. Note the image's origin in the illustration of the High Priestess, the Major Arana card II of the tarot deck inspired by A. E. Waite.

First seen at [00:19:50], and later clearly seen at [01:15:26], Fredric March holds a paper fan advertising \"Compliments Masons Funeral Parlor\". While many other townspeople, court observers and jurists, carry similar fans, it is noteworthy that March clearly displays the advertisement in several key scenes since his character, who dies at the films end, is a thinly-veiled depiction of William Jennings Bryan, who was a freemason and who died shortly after the trial. Of peripheral interest to freemasons is an erroneous reference to Archbishop Usshers computation of the date of creation.

The conventioneers are wearing fezzes, which were not only worn by Shriners but by members of the Elks and the Order of Moose.

Here Judge Roy Bean and his deputies salute the camera with their left hand raised and their right hand over their hearts.
