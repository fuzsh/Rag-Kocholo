        "text": "From Facebook\n\nFAREWELL ü•∞ Farewell to Mrs Marina Kazzi who is leaving the school after 28 years. Mrs Kazzi will be going on Long Service Leave starting from next week with the intention of then retiring. Marina has held many positions at Catherine McAuley starting in 1996 as a casual administrative worker before moving into the school library as an Audio Visual Technician (back in the days of VHS tapes and overhead projectors!). Whilst working in the school library 3 days a week Marina worked 1 day a week in the Diocese as a Parish Secretary and another day at St Oliver‚Äôs Harris Park. Marina left McAuley for two years to work for Bishop Manning, Bishop of Parramatta, before returning to McAuley in the role of Personal Assistant to the Principal. Marina stayed in this role for 16 years while also acting as the Enrolments and Census Officer. Marina then went on to have the sole position of Enrolments and Census Officer, and then took on the role of School Receptionist, and is now in her current position the Leader of Learning Curriculum Administrative Assistant. Marina is also a former parent of the school having had three daughters attend Catherine McAuley. She says she has enjoyed a lot of things about working at Catherine McAuley. ‚ÄúThe people, the students and the way the school has evolved is huge‚Äù, she says. ‚ÄúI like being busy so I have enjoyed all aspects of the different roles‚Äù. Marina has seen lots of physical changes to the school over the years including the building of the Mercy Chapel, the library being refurbished, the Sr Barbara McDonough Building being built, and more. Marina is looking forward to spending more time with her four adult children and eight grandchildren, joining the local lawn bowling club, joining Probus (an association of retired and semi-retired people who join together in clubs) and doing voluntary work."
