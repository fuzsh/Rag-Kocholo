        "text": "Mother McAuley Liberal Arts High School is a place that empowers girls to use their strong voices and leadership abilities to make a lasting difference in the world we all share. Visitors to their campus witness this every day – in their classrooms, on the field and projecting from the stage. Girls here see their potential as having no limits.\n\nSince 1922, Resurrection College Prep High School has been focused on developing strong, capable women. As the largest all-girls school on the North Side of Chicago, Resurrection offers a rigorous and challenging education for all students in a supportive environment.\n\nTrinity High School doesn’t just teach students; they challenge them. They believe it is of utmost importance that a young woman leaves Trinity with the ability to challenge herself and rise to any challenge put before her.\n\nRegina Dominican is an independent Catholic high school built for girls with unique programs that allow each student to find and become the best version of herself. Rooted in the Dominican tradition, they challenge young women to be independent thinkers, relentless truth-seekers and confident, compassionate leaders.\n\nJosephinum Academy of the Sacred Heart’s all-girls environment creates a culture that fosters achievement, confidence and independence. Josephinum is a school where girls are accustomed to having their voices heard and regularly see women holding leadership roles, creating a model for the world young women want and deserve.\n\nOur Lady of Tepeyac High School is an all-girls, college preparatory, Catholic high school operated by the Archdiocese of Chicago and located in the Little Village community. Once home to Eastern European immigrants, Little Village is now considered one of the largest Mexican American communities in the country."
