As a Catholic school, we honour the gospel values and our Mercy heritage established by Catherine McAuley and our founding sisters.\n\nWe are led by our values, celebrate diversity and inclusion, and have a strong commitment to social justice through our Service program. We pride ourselves on offering rich learning experiences, both in the classroom and through co-curricular programs, and have a strong focus on wellbeing.\n\nWe invite you to learn more about Santa Maria College through our website and encourage you to join us on a tour.\n\nSanta Maria College is nestled in picturesque gardens overlooking the Swan River in Attadale, Western Australia and is a Years 5 â€“ 12 Catholic school for girls, both day and boarding with 1300 students including 152 boarders. Santa Maria offers a quality education inspired by Jesus Christ and the vision of Catherine McAuley.\n\nThe vision of Catherine McAuley, foundress of the Sisters of Mercy, led to the founding of the College in 1938. Since then the Mercy tradition has enabled Santa Maria girls to thrive at school and beyond. We believe that our values, Hospitality, Compassion, Justice, Service and Excellence, reflect not only the principles of our faith but the values wider society holds dear."
