        "text": "Mercy in Action\n\nCompassion and Service are core attributes of Merion Mercy. The foundress of the Sisters of Mercy, Catherine McAuley, is renowned for her integration of contemplation and action, and MMA’s service programs exist to further the call of the Gospel, teaching students to integrate faith and justice.\n\nAt our private, Catholic, all girls school, service isn’t just about doing a good deed; it’s about living a values-centered life. Our girls put mercy in action every day, be it helping locally with partners in the Philadelphia area, working in community for a week or longer through the Mercy Mission Corps Summer Program, or raising funds during events.\n\nService allows your daughter to hear life stories different from her own and to find common ground with those whom she serves.\n\nMercy Mission Corps\n\nThe Mercy Mission Corps (MMC) is an organization unique to Merion Mercy Academy, which provides opportunities for students, faculty, staff, parents and alumnae to put their faith into action through service.\n\nOur multifaceted outreach opportunities are closely aligned with the Mercy Critical Concerns:\n\nMercy Immersions\n\nFor over 25 years, Mercy Immersons (previously known as Summer Service Trips) has provided educational and service immersion opportunities for students during the summer following junior year. Students and faculty travel to domestic and international sites to serve impoverished areas, working in collaboration with community partners, and in solidarity with people of diverse cultures. Volunteers live in community for a week or longer and are called to reflect on their roles as women of mercy.\n\nService opportunities during summer are not limited to immersion trips. Single day service opportunities are offered to the entire MMA community throughout the summer. See our Outreach Opportunities, below, for a list of our Community Partners."
