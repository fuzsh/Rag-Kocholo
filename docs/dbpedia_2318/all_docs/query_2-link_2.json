        "text": "Letter from the Principal\n\n\"The legacy of a Catholic Education is more than knowledge imparted to our students. It is the development of a deep and abiding sense of faith, the realization of the value of moral character, and the inspiration of a life-long journey of learning.\" --Cardinal Daniel Dinardo\n\nOur faculty and staff at Mercy McAuley work hard every day to encourage the development of your daughter's whole self - mind, body and soul. We can never underestimate the importance of a strong faith-based education. Your daughters are a gift, and this Catholic, Mercy education is a gift to your daughters.\n\nThe first quarter ends on Friday, Oct. 12. Students' grades on their report cards will be displayed as alpha grades, not numeric grades. The reports cards will be emailed the week of Oct. 22. Grades only display one aspect of their education; the true value of a Catholic, Mercy education is evident in the way students live, and in the Mercy values they demonstrate every day.\n\n\"What lies behind us and what lies before us are small matters compared to what lies within us.\" --Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\nThank you for sharing the gift of your daughters!\n\nMercy and compassion always in our hearts,\n\nConnie Kampschmidt\n\nImportant VIRTUS Requirements for Parents\n\nEffective July 1, 2018, a revision was made to the Archdiocese of Cincinnati's Decree on Child Protection. The revision requires that anyone having contact with children as an Archdiocesan employee or volunteer must be trained in the Decree. Mercy McAuley supports this effort, and we are holding our staff and volunteers accountable to this requirement. As such, anyone who volunteers at Mercy McAuley in any capacity – whether they are working the concession stands, serving as chaperones, or helping at school events (just to name a few examples) – must be VIRTUS trained and must stay in compliance with the monthly VIRTUS online articles. A list of training sessions that are being offered throughout the Tristate are found HERE. As part of the VIRTUS training, all volunteers must also complete the online background check at www.selection.com. Thank you for your cooperation!\n\nParent Pack News\n\nEsther Price Candy Sale - Longtime supporter and donor, Mr. Jim Day, owner of Esther Price Candies, has a new fundraising opportunity for Mercy McAuley families. For every box of chocolate we sell, Mr. Day will give back 25% to the school. So the more we sell, the more we make! Parents, please consider selling candy to your friends and families; Thanksgiving and Christmas are only a couple months away! Don't forget your clients, co-workers and teachers. Shoppers can purchase candy online HERE by Oct. 29. If you prefer to use a paper copy order form to place your order, you may do so by printing and completing THIS FORM and submitting it to the school's main office by Oct. 29. Candies can be picked up at school on Nov. 19 and 20.\n\nChairpersons Needed - The Parent Pack Board is looking for one or two parents to chair the Baccalaureate Reception. Please email parentpack@mercymcauley.org if you are interested!\n\nOctober 22 Meeting - Join us for our Parent Pack meeting on Monday, Oct. 22, at 7:30 p.m. in the cafeteria. Mercy McAuley school nurse, Stephanie Bates, will be present to discuss concerns of juuling and vaping among high school students.\n\nJunior Initiation Ceremony is Oct. 26\n\nAll members of the Class of 2020 and their families are invited to celebrate a Mass in their honor on Friday, Oct. 26. Mass will begin at 8:30 a.m. in the Auditorium. During this Mass, class rings will be blessed. All students are invited to have rings blessed. This includes both Mercy McAuley rings purchased through Graduate Services as well as those purchased from other vendors and/or gifted from alumnae. Following Mass, a short initiation ceremony will be held welcoming all members of the class of 2020 as upperclass women at Mercy McAuley. Donuts and juice will be served at the conclusion of the ceremony. This will be a dress up day for students, with dismissal following breakfast.\n\nMercy McAuley Theatre Needs Watches & Clocks for Fall Play\n\nOur theatre department is collecting watches and clocks to use in our fall play, Radium Girls, which is Nov. 16 - 18. If you have any watches and/or clocks that you no longer need (they do not need to be in working condition), please consider donating them for the show! Items can be sent to Katie Geckle, Theatre Director. Thank you!\n\nWe hope you'll join us for Radium Girls, Mercy McAuley's first show, Nov. 16 - 18. Radium Girls, set in New Jersey the 1920s, is based on the true story of young factory workers who begin a campaign for justice after being sickened by radium-laced paint on the job. It is a fast-moving theatrical ensemble piece about greed, wealth, the environment, science, and courage. We are very excited about this production and can't wait to share it with you! Tickets can be purchased online HERE.\n\nHealth and Wellness & Safety Corner\n\nAt Mercy McAuley, we are committed to caring for students' whole self - mind, body and spirit. Each week, we will include health, wellness and/or safety updates or tips in this newsletter.\n\nUpdate from Terminix - As we have communicated previously, in early September, one bed bug was found in the library, and last week, one bed bug was found in a classroom. Terminix recommended a black light test to ensure the school did not have bed bugs. This test, which occurred last week, found that there are no bed bugs at school. Terminix believes that the two prior incidents were isolated situations. Please help ensure your daughters have accurate information about these incidents. Facts about bed bugs can be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website HERE.\n\nNews from the Counselors\n\nCollege Information Night is Oct. 11 - A College Information Night will be held in the school's cafeteria tomorrow, Oct. 11, at 7 p.m. College admission and financial aid counselors from Marian University and Miami University (Oxford) will be present to define the financial aid process and offer information about completing the FAFSA. This event is particularly relevant for junior and senior parents, but all are welcome. Please RSVP HERE.\n\nImportant FAFSA Update for Parents of Seniors - Parents of seniors should have received an email from Mrs. Kampschmidt on Oct. 2 regarding an issue with the FAFSA. As was stated in the email, the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) opened on October 1, marking the first day that families can complete the application for college financial aid. The deadline to complete the FAFSA varies by college; many colleges post their FAFSA deadline on the admissions page of their web site. Almost all colleges make it a point to encourage families to complete the FAFSA, and in a timely manner.\n\nIf you are completing the FAFSA for your daughter, you will notice that Mercy McAuley High School does not currently appear in the drop down search list of schools within the application. Because Mercy McAuley is a new school, FAFSA has not yet added it to the list of schools in the application. The FAFSA specialists have assured us that the drop down search is handled on the government side, and that it will be updated to include Mercy McAuley in the drop down list in the future. Although Mercy McAuley is not currently included in the drop down list, you can still enter Mercy McAuley into the application by following these simple steps:\n\nWhere it asks to enter the school, name, type \"Mercy McAuley High School,\" then add \"Cincinnati,\" and then add \"Ohio.\"\n\nClick \"Next.\" (Do not click \"Search.\") This will move you on through the application process with no errors or flags.\n\nPlease rest assured that we are staying in close communication with FAFSA and are confident that we have taken the proper, proactive steps necessary to address this situation. We will keep you updated as soon as we learn that Mercy McAuley has been added to the application's drop down search list. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact your daughter's counselor.\n\nMore News from the Counselors - Please click the link below for additional news from the counselors.\n\nAthletic News\n\nIt's October, which means that some teams are finishing the season, and some teams are headed to post-season play!
