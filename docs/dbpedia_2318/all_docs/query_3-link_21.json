        "text": "Throughout my journey at Misericordia University, I have developed wonderful relationships with those in the History and Government Department, both faculty and students, who have done so much to support me during my journey here.\n\nBetween my studies as a dual History and GLNS major, and extracurricular activities as former Vice-President of the History Club and former GLNS Club President, and current Phi Alpha Theta member, I have been able to pursue activities outside the classroom that help me to gain an insight into the world around me and how my talents may help it.\n\nI am not sure where and who I would be today if I did not choose Misericordia University.\n\nOne of the most influential aspects from Misericordia University that aided in my graduate school applications was the opportunity MU provided to be highly involved, both on a personal and professional level. Misericordia’s biochemistry program allowed me to gain first hand experience conducting research, writing grants, presenting posters/professional talks and attending conferences such as the American Chemical Society (ACS) national meeting.\n\nThe faculty-student environment provided by Misericordia University was very friendly, collaborative, and insightful. There was never a moment I felt my classmates or professors were unapproachable, making my learning experience more welcoming.\n\nMisericordia truly became a second home for me during my 6.5 years there. Specifically during the physical therapy program, the professors were (and still are) always there to provide encouragement, a shoulder to cry on during hard times, and extra insight above and beyond their required duties.\n\nEvidence-based practice was consistently stressed throughout the program, which taught me that learning and growing as a clinician is a never ending process. My professors also encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone and apply for a competitive and intense clinical setting which enhanced my experience in the area of pediatrics drastically, allowing me to acquire a job in outpatient pediatrics as my first job out of school.\n\nWhat makes Medical & Health Humanities so special is that it provides the perfect foundation for so many areas in both the health sciences and health care fields. When I was searching for schools, I knew that I wanted to go into a medical field where I could learn skills to help other people. What I never expected was to learn skills that could help people in other aspects of their life besides just physical treatment, something that other fields of medical education do not cover as well.\n\nIn only my first two years, I have had the opportunity to learn so much about healthcare systems, human rights, societal and cultural influences on medicine, medical ethics, and more! After I complete my undergraduate degree in MHH, I plan on going into graduate training for physical therapy. I truly believe that the knowledge and skills I am acquiring in MHH are going to enhance my career and how I work with those in need of or receiving medical care.\n\nMy experience at Misericordia University, and in particular as a Speech Language Pathology major, has been invaluable. Every professor I have had at Misericordia has gone above and beyond to be invested in the success of their students.\n\nThe SLP department at Misericordia made it easy to get involved with numerous clubs and activities, whether it was volunteering to take on extra clients at the on-campus clinic or organizing the annual 5K for the local chapter of the National Stuttering Association. Also, I was so thankful to be included on numerous research projects that were presented at state and national conferences in amazing cities across the country from Pittsburgh to Los Angeles.\n\nThe coursework to complete a master’s degree in Speech Language Pathology was both challenging and intellectually stimulating, and I know I will leave Misericordia University to work in the field of pediatric speech language pathology as the best clinician and person that I can be.\n\nThe Psychology department at Misericordia University has helped me realize a deeper potential. Whenever I had certain goals in mind academically, I was able to achieve higher than originally thought possible.\n\nEvery psychology professor I had the privilege to study under were all extremely knowledgeable and accommodating. The one-on-one experience I had with my psychology professors has helped me feel more welcomed and comfortable, and is an experience that I feel cannot be matched."
