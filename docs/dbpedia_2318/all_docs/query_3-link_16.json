        "text": "Computer Information\n\nTECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS\n\nAt McAuley Catholic College, we want our students to be confident, connected, actively involved, lifelong learners, and technology is a critical component in 21st century learning.\n\nYear 7 STARTING HIGH SCHOOL CHROMEBOOKS\n\nThe College orders and pays for new devices on behalf of parents and carers for students commencing year 7 at the start of High School. The devices are delivered to the school in readiness for rollout at the start of the year. Parents and carers must pay the College for the devices by mid-December the previous year. The College has been able to negotiate a volume discount and has passed this saving on to parents. Each device has an extended 3-year onsite warranty, 3-year Accidental Damage Protection insurance* and a bag. * (A $60.50 excess applies for ADP claims).\n\nYear 7-9 CHROMEBOOKS\n\nLate Year 7 enrolments (students that are enrolled after December of the previous year) or students entering into other year groups can order a Chromebook directly from our supplier. It is strongly recommended that the purchase include add-ons of 3 year extended warranty, ADP insurance and a bag. A link to the purchase portal can be found at the bottom of this article under \"Order a Chromebook\".\n\nAll students and parents/carers are required to give consent to our Network Acceptable Use Policy before the device can be issued to students. This policy can be accessed on our Policy and Procedures page.\n\n* Please note that Accidental Damage Protection does not cover against loss or theft. Parents/Carers should check against their own insurance policies and make suitable arrangements if they wish.\n\nYEAR 10-12 LAPTOPS\n\nParents of new Year 10-12 students need to provide their child with a Chromebook or laptop, and students are expected to bring their device to school every day. Students in Years 10-12 have the flexibility of purchasing a device of their choice, however a Windows device is recommended to ensure compatibility with the Collegeâ€™s computer system. Chromebooks are considered an adequate device and parents may choose to purchase through the College supplier, or source their own elsewhere.\n\nA link to the purchase portal can be found at the bottom of this article under \"Order a Chromebook\".\n\nAll students and parents/carers are required to give consent to our Network Acceptable Use Policy that sets out how the device can be used at school. This policy can be accessed on our Policy and Procedures page.\n\nASSISTANCE AVAILABLE\n\nWe also recognise at times a student may need a loan device for a very short period of time, eg in the event of a warranty or ADP claim. If available a device may be borrowed through the library. It is expected that the device be returned in the same condition as it was lent. If returned damaged, you may be responsible for the cost of the repairs.\n\nParents who are unable to fund the purchase of a Chromebook are asked to contact the Principal, or the College Business Manager to discuss any assistance that may be available. This will be a confidential discussion. Please note that NO family should consider withdrawing their child from the College because of financial hardships caused by the cost of providing a Chromebook."
