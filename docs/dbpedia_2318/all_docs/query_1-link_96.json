Committed to meeting the current needs of children, young women and men, Mercy secondary and elementary education remain a vital component of the works of the Sisters of Mercy and their partners.\n\nMercy Education is international and ensures that education ministries are identified within the mission of the Catholic Church and are faithful to the charism, mission and core values of the Sisters of Mercy."
