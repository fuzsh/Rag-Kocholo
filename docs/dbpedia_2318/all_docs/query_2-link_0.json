        "text": "Mother McAuley High School is proud to announce the hiring of Laura Gill, as the school's new athletic director beginning her tenure on July 1, 2024. As a result of an extensive search and multiple rounds of interviews with key stakeholders, Gill's practical experience, leadership, commitment to Catholic education, and passion for women's sports made her the natural choice to assume this leadership position.\n\nIt was another MIGHTY great afternoon on 99th Street! On April 30th, we unveiled the brand new scoreboard and lights on our turf field, thanks to the generous support of the Tom Hopkins Foundation and Marquette Bank.\n\nMother McAuley is proud to be the first all-girls school in Chicago with a state-of-the-art turf field. We celebrated this investment we are making towards equity in women’s sports with our Mighty Mac Community today.\n\nSpecial thanks to Alderman Matt O’Shea, Mayor Terry Vorderer, Committeewoman Fran Hurley, WLS TV, WGN News and Fox 32 Chicago.\n\nWe are MIGHTY proud to share that our very own, Ellie White '24, was named Honorary Coach for the 2024 Special Olympics Opening Ceremonies!\n\nThe 56th Annual Opening Ceremonies were held this past weekend at Soldier Field. Each year, an Honorary Coach is selected to kick off the games in celebration of Special Olympic athletes! Ellie joins a list of Chicago sports legends that have preceded her in being named the Honorary Coach.\n\nCongratulations on this incredible honor, Ellie!"
