        "text": "From Facebook\n\nANSTO National Science Week Hackathon ü¶â A small group of dedicated Science students took part last week in the ANSTO (Australian Nuclear Science & Technology Organisation) National Science Week Hackathon for 2024. The hackathon was described as a ‚Äòdesign sprint‚Äô with the students given a design brief early on Monday morning and then had three days to look at the problem, design a solution, work out who the end user was and present their solution in video form. The students were challenged to answer the question: ‚ÄòHow might we engage the community in supporting the survival of an endangered species?‚Äô The students were asked to address the brief to their local council who was keen to inspire community engagement and involvement. The hackathon challenged students to think creatively how to engage their local community in helping endangered species whilst also having fun working in teams.\n\nFrom Facebook\n\nRHYME WITHOUT REASON üòÉ This is the theme for Mercy Day 2024! Created by the SRC Student Leadership Team, the theme encourages students to come together with friends and dress up in imaginative pairings like, ‚Äòpink panther and dancer‚Äô or ‚Äòbarbie and army‚Äô. This captures the essence of our 2024 school theme, ‚ÄòEmbrace, Excel, Empower‚Äô. The concept of a ‚ÄòRhyme Without Reason‚Äô explores the notion that two seemingly unrelated ideas can be united through their rhyme, symbolising what the McAuley community has strived to live out throughout 2024: embracing our differences, excelling in unity, and realising that we are empowered to be stronger together, all guided by the spirit of mercy.\n\nFrom Facebook\n\nDUKE OF ED üåü Huge congratulations to our amazing Year 9 students who just conquered the Duke of Edinburgh Bronze Award camp! üèï Over the past few days, they‚Äôve faced both physical and mental challenges, with their teamwork, resilience, and enthusiasm on full display as they successfully climbed six mountains! üèîNavigating tough terrains and setting up camp, they supported each other every step of the way. We're incredibly proud of all they‚Äôve achieved‚Äîthis adventure has definitely left them stronger and ready for whatever comes next! üí™üí™\n\nFrom Facebook\n\nACADEMY U üéì The newest group of students to join the Academy U program run by Western Sydney University were welcomed at the university this week. 10 Year 9 students will be taking part in the program. The Academy U program provides an opportunity for invited students in Years 9, 10 and 11 to participate in university courses whilst still at school.\n\nFrom Facebook\n\nREADING IS MAGIC! ‚ú®‚ú® The Catherine McAuley library is celebrating Book Week! The theme this year is ‚ÄòReading is Magic‚Äô. Students are encouraged to come to the library and check out this year‚Äôs notable books and other great stories! #CBCA2024 As a special Book Week activity students are invited to write the name of their favourite book on a star which will join the wall full of stars outside the library. üåü #bookweek2024 #schoollibrary #catherinemcauley #catherinemcauleywestmead"
