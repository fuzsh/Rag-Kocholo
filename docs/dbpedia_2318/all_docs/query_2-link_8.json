        "text": "Kate Shannon Boyle ’82 is a top-producing real estate broker in Illinois and Michigan, whose penchant for giving was honed at an early age, thanks to her incredible family. Kate’s parents were all about good works, and taught their kids that there is nothing novel about helping the less fortunate; it is just what you do. At Mother McAuley, Kate was lucky to continue her love of volunteerism, a trait that has continued into her adult life. Kate has served as a volunteer Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) in Cook County; helped establish the Misericordia Women’s League in 1996 which, to date, has raised more than $15,000,000 for Misericordia’s great works; serves on Misericordia’s Board of Advisors; assists the remarkable Misericordia BUMS Golf Outing every year; chaired the boards of her kids’ schools, as well as Mother McAuley; and led numerous school and community committees and fundraisers. Her career in real estate has afforded Kate opportunities to serve homeless and home-challenged populations, as well: she was on the Board of Coldwell Banker’s CB Cares Foundation, and currently serves as the Vice President of the @givesback Board, the charity arm of @properties.\n\nMaya-Camille Broussard ‘97 is the chef, founder, and owner of Justice of the Pies, a bakery that specializes in sweet and savory pies, quiches and tarts.

She is also a published author, with several articles in US Catholic and other periodicals. In 2013, she passed away after a hard-fought battle with cancer.

Marti acquired her commitment to lifelong learning at McAuley, earning her bachelor’s degree in science at Northern Illinois University, becoming a Registered Dietitian a year later, and in 2002, earning a master’s degree at NIU with a thesis analyzing how employees’ perceptions of management affect quality service at continuing care retirement communities.
