That's more than 10,000 kids waiting for food, shoes, and jackets.\n\nThat's why we've launched an urgent appeal, backed by our Principal Partner, Meridian Energy. Helping everyone starts with helping someone. Will you join us?\n\n\"KidsCan helped me out so much, with those little things of hope. When it's the only meal you're having a day, or your first new shoes, you can't even imagine the impact that has on kids. It's someone showing you they care about you. Just to feel like someone could see me and see what I was going through is really cool.\""
