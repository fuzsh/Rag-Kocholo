We like to take pride in everything we do. In the past year, your help was needed for various community service projects and fundraisers, such as recycling and cleaning up our community, planning a community-wide dodgeball tournament, and a 5K run. Your hard work has been greatly appreciated. Don’t let it stop here! Help our chapter reach the “Gateway to Greatness” in 2012. For the year to come, we have many experiences planned as a new chapter. We will work on recruiting new members. We will also work on letting our community know about what we are doing and our plans for the year. Our officers will attend the National Fall Leadership Conference. That experience will help them work on their leadership roles. They will come back with many new ideas and plans for our chapter that will help us have a successful second year. Although this is only our second year being a chapter at McAuley, we have thrived in membership. Our chapter has almost 80% of students as registered members. As members, all of you have been active and involved in all FBLA activities throughout the year. This year, we have come to the students and faculty of McAuley with the purpose of making a difference. We want to get even more students involved in FBLA. We have planned fun activities like a dodgeball tournament, a 5K run, FBLA week activities, preparation for competition, an end-of- the-year activity, a slideshow, and dinner to show what we have accomplished this year, and induction of new members, and various other events to promote membership and participation. All events that we are planning with help involvement in FBLA and encourage team building with all members. Together, we can make this year’s FBLA successful and raise the bar even higher for years to come. Don’t forget that if you ever have any questions about FBLA or becoming a member, feel free to stop by Mr. Bromley’s room and ask him. Thanks again for all your hard work and good luck in the upcoming year! Sincerely Kimberly Carlton FBLA of McAuley Catholic High School works to build character, develop skills, and learn key tools of the business world.\n\n4. 3 | P a g e Members wait to depart for District Testing. When the McAuley Chapter was Organized McAuley FBLA has reached its second year since starting in 2010. FBLA was brought to McAuley High School by Patrick Bromley, our business teacher. The growth of population in FBLA at our school from the past year is a promising sign that McAuley FBLA is here to stay. Every year a new class of freshman come to McAuley and gets to experience all that McAuley FBLA has to offer. They are engaged in business activities and by the time the year has ended, everyone has learned something new as far as bettering business skills. McAuley FBLA has had a successful first two years and has helped to educate students in ways of the business world as well as strengthening their self-confidence. The nine FBLA goals are strongly emphasized because our advisor, Mr. Bromley, feels not only will I help us in our FBLA careers but also help us in our careers as high school students, college students, and in our adult lives. Number of Members McAuley Catholic High School has a strong FBLA program with half of our school as registered members. The number of members has risen by over 50% since 2010-2011, our inaugural year. In the past year, McAuley FBLA has risen not only in participation, but school involvement as well. All members are eager to work and very active in their FBLA projects. Chapter Activities McAuley Catholic High School has 100 students enrolled in grades 9-12. There are only four high schools in the Joplin area and McAuley is one of the two that have an active FBLA group. McAuley’s small size and large percent of active members gives several of our students the opportunity to develop in the skills and communication. FBLA is something that a large number of the student body can relate to one another with. McAuley FBLA follows the McAuley Catholic High School, Missouri, and National FBLA bylaws. Our chapter is aware that by following the laws of the land, the chapter can be Chapter GoalsChapter Overview\n\n5. 4 | P a g e Goals Increase involvement and participation Purchase 15 computers for computer lab Incorporate community service activities throughout the year Provide leadership training to members Attend district, state, and national competitions Raise money to support community projects and FBLA conferences Officers hold meetings every Friday morning. financially stable and succeed as an honoree chapter. Under the direction of our FBLA advisor and chapter officers, we hold meetings to ensure that our chapter is aware and meeting the community’s needs. Program of Work Our chapter advisor and officers meet at the beginning of the year to set goals and plan activities for the year ahead that will offer the chapter new experiences and community service. The foundation of our chapter plans for success is set by the following goals: Officer Meetings In order to meet the chapter’s goals the officers decided that it would be beneficial to meet the first and second Tuesday of the month. The scheduled meetings start at 8:00 AM to discuss upcoming events, financial status, active members and chapter’s activity status in the community. These meetings are intended to help voice concerns, problems, and upcoming events so they are held as needed as well. Local Chapter Meetings McAuley FBLA holds meetings the second and fourth Thursday of the month. Chapter meetings start at 8:00 AM. Unscheduled meetings are announced over the intercom when they are necessary to have. The chapter officers present and discuss their opinions and plans with the chapter. The chapter is given the opportunity to voice their opinion and vote for their choice. Local Chapter Leadership Positions McAuley FBLA’s president, Kim Carlton, was nominated by members to run for election in 2011. Kim Carlton ran for the 2011-2012 district treasure and was successful. Carlton is the first district officer and has set the foundation for dedicating time to serving others in the community. Campaigns for district office are currently being worked on for the 2012-2013 year. Each year FBLA strives to be the most influential and beneficial organization at McAuley. Recruitment of Members\n\n6. 5 | P a g e Members explain to 8th graders what FBLA is about. One of several posters advertising FBLA that were hung throughout the school. Junior High Recruitment Four officers were led by our advisor, Mr. Bromley, to St. Peter’s Middle School to recruit 8th graders with an FBLA presentation. The presentation provided reasons to join FBLA, highlighting the lifelong benefits and the opportunity of a fun, memorable time. After the presentation, the recruiters mingled with the 8th graders allowing them to ask more in-depth questions. The 8th graders gotexcitedto be able to get involved and be an influential member in the school chapter. Meet and Greet To kick off the 2nd year of FBLA at McAuley, as well as the upcoming school year, a meet and greet was held on August 18, 2011 for current members as well as new members. The purpose of the event was to inform anyone who was interested in joining FBLA about the group. Students as well as parents were greeted by an FBLA officer or Mr. Bromley who gladly shared information and answered questions about the upcoming year’s plans. Every student was invited, which resulted in a 50% membership increase. The meet and greet’s success inspired officers to make it an annual event to ensure the continual growth of FBLA. Technology The use of technology has helped members keep in touch about dates, times, and events through various sources such as Facebook, text messaging, and our McAuley FBLA website. Facebook and our website are used not only to inform members of upcoming events and meetings, but advertise important fundraisers like the Jack Frost Run and Dodgeball Tournament to the public. By using these sources, McAuley FBLA is exposed to the community. Text messages are an efficient way to remind students of upcoming activities to ensure a large attendance. Advertising McAuley’s first FBLA meeting was advertised every morning and afternoon on the school-wide intercom announcements for the first week of school. Informative posters were also crafted in the summer by officers to hang up in the school hallways for the first couple months of school. The purpose of this advertising was to verify that every student knew that he or she had the opportunity to join FBLA.

Offering a variety of business classes, McAuley prepares students for success not only in FBLA, but in students’ future careers. Guest Speakers Job Shadowing This year was McAuley’s first in taking the opportunity to shadow a variety of careers available in the business world. A group of eager-to-learn members dressed up for the day as they spent a couple of hours in the footsteps of business such as a local insurance agency, law firm, and television station. Observing a real-life business environment prepared students for the transition from work to school. Many students have become fascinated after visiting and have plans to work as an intern at these businesses this summer. Business Advisory Council Each semester, our advisor meets with a council of eight members who are experienced business leaders and owners to discuss important FBLA events, meetings, and fundraisers that will soon occur. The council suggests ideas on how to help FBLA members reach goals, gain valuable skills, and develop confidence. The committee does this by incorporating students as much as possible with their own business. •Mock trials give students confidence as they learn the legal matters associated with business. •Ideas are expressed and put into action by creating plans describing potential businesses. Business Law/ Entrepreneurship •Banking and credit options are explored as well how to manage one's own finances. •Students learn how to analyze, journalize, and post transactions, as well as prepare financial statements. Personal Finance/ Accounting •Software skills are gained as students explore the basics of a computer in order to work in a technological environment.

Some events such as office chair races and disk throwing contests will be featured. Students will be rewarded for a year of hard work with an ice-cream party. Throughout the past two years of McAuley FBLA, making relationships with local businesses has become a crucial step not Relationships with the CommunityPlans for FBLA Week\n\n10. 9 | P a g e The Run Around is one of several businesses that sponsor McAuley FBLA. only for advertising needs, but for sponsoring needs as well. The support of local businesses has helped for McAuley FBLA events to become a success and an option for years to come. The Run Around The Run Around is a local business which has been supporting McAuley FBLA for the past two years. Our FBLA advisor, Patrick Bromley, being a runner himself, has close ties with the running community.. McAuley FBLA has utilized these relationshipsin advertising for our Jack Frost 5K at The Run Around. The Run Around has also been a proud sponsor of the Jack Frost 5K. The Joplin Family Y Because so many McAuley FBLA members are also members of the Joplin Family Y, the Y allowed us to advertise for our Jack Frost 5K Run at both facilities. The Joplin Family Y has been an ideal place for advertisement due to the vast number of people from our community who are members. Crossland Construction Crossland Construction was a sponsor of this year’s Jack Frost Run. They contributed a generousamount of money, helping our Jack Frost Run become a success. Ozark Athletic Supply Ozark Athletic Supply has helped McAuley for a number of years, and they have been especially kind to the FBLA group. From donating shirts to giving us discounted prices on trophies, their generosity is thoroughly appreciated. Fir Road Christian Church The Fir Road Christian Church graciously allowed McAuley to use its facility for our Jack Frost run. They opened their doors to their building so there was a warm meeting place to sign up, organize, and distribute numbers and t-shirts. The church also allowed McAuley FBLA to use portions of their parking lot for our run. Carl Junction FBLA Program Having only had an FBLA at our school for two years, we needed some guidance and mentoring as far as developing our FBLA program. Carl Junction FBLA has helped McAuley FBLA in numerous ways to grow and develop. Recognition for our community has helped members become more active in the community. Serving the School and Community\n\n11. 10 | P a g e Members attended the Breast Cancer Awareness Walk in Carl Junction. Students are always using our computer lab, for which we have purchased several new computers. Service to School Programs Members of FBLA produce the programs for athletic and theater events. The athletic programs are necessary at home football, volleyball, and basketball games for both girls and boys. Specialized programs called Media Guides are made at the beginning of each season introducing the active athletes with a show biography. Programs for the fall and spring play include a biography of each actor and crew member. Computer Lab FBLA has hosted many fundraisers such as the Jack Frost run, Dodgeball tournament, and Powderpuff. McAuley FBLA has raised enough money through these fundraisers to purchase five new computers for the computer lab. McAuley is a private school, so we do not receive extra funding to stay up to date on technology. FBLA has been generous enough to work on fulfilling the need to update the computer lab and we are in the process of gratifying it. Fifteen more computers are essential to keep students connected with the technological advances, so fundraising money will continue to be dedicated to helping students. Service to Community Breast Cancer Awareness Walk Members attended the annual Breast Cancer Walk to support awareness at Carl Junction High School. The walk is organized by Carl Junction FBLA, who McAuley associates with in support of events. Together, money was raised and donated in supporting many local women through their fight against cancer. Crop Walk The Crop Walk is an annual event in which the entire community gathers together to walk throughout the city. The purpose of the crop walk is the end hunger in various countries in Africa by providing wells and farming equipment. FBLA’s first year walking in the event was greatly enjoyed by all the members. Next year a goal of McAuley FBLA is to get more people involved in this enjoyable activity.\n\n12. 11 | P a g e Lindsey Klunk (center) passes on advice well wishes to her successors.

Members not only helped plan and prepare for the race, several also ran in it. On a chilly December morning, many peoplebraved the cold weather to run in McAuley’s the second annual Jack Frost 5K/10 mile run. Even before that, officers, led by Lucy Borgmeyer, went to Fir Road Christian Church to set up for the event. Signs were placed throughout the course to lead the 100 plus runners. As runners arrived, they received a t-shirt and number bib. The horn then sounded to start the race. Runners times were tracked by a professional company who had installed tiny chips into the bibs. Before the event came to an end, trophies were dispersed to those finishing at the top of their age division. An overall male and female plaque was presented as well.

Jack Frost 5K/10 Mile RunAmerican Enterprise Project\n\n14. 13 | P a g e FBLA members sell advertising supplies. Ooh…Cookies…Yum! Won for Best Overall Company Funky Monkey Cookie Company pitches their cookie to the judges Week One Students were asked to divide into two teams. The FBLA members asked them to line up in certain orders (alphabetical from A to Z, shoe size from smallest to largest, and age from oldest to youngest). While Team 2 excelled at this activity, Team 1 struggled. The FBLA members explained that the reason Team 2 had such an easy time following directions is because they communicated with each other, whereas the members of Team 1 argued with each other and failed to listen to any instructions. Week Two Students were split into companies of three people. Each company came up with a name, then they were given a sheet with prices of supplies on it. Each company was given $50 in Monopoly money to spend, and they had to budget it out carefully between their cookie, frosting, extra toppings, and advertising supplies (crayons and paper). Then, they had to come up with a design for their cookie using two colors of frosting and any other supplies they needed. They were then given some time to make signs advertising their products. Week Three The companies were given a few minutes to finish making their signs, and then they had to begin decorating their cookies. After time was called, each company had a few minutes to hang their signs and figure out what they were going to say in order to convince the judges to buy their cookies. As the judges went around, each company was asked questions about why they designed their cookie the way they did, how they came up with the name of their cookie, etc. Each group was scored based on quality, overall appearance, taste, how well they advertised their product, and how well they presented themselves; one group was awarded Best Overall.\n\n15. 14 | P a g e Tessa Foti won first place in Introduction to Business Communications.

Bulletin Board District/State/National CompetitionsAdvertising\n\n16. 15 | P a g e The Warrior Connections reaches numerous people through the school system. The February bulletin board featured the names of all FBLA members. FBLA has been written about in every school paper so far this year. McAuley FBLA periodically changes a bulletin board in the school hallway to keep students in the know of other FBLA projects. Things such as competition results and upcoming FBLA trips are pinned up to not only let the student body know what all FBLA has accomplished, but to keep faculty and staff aware as well. The bulletin board helps McAuley to gain the support of the people of the school. School Announcements Every morning before school and every afternoon before lunch and the end of the day, McAuley makes announcements regarding upcoming events. FBLA takes advantage of this daily opportunity to make our upcoming fundraisers known to the whole school. Important news such as meetings, when group pictures will be taken, results in the latest competition, and various other topics are announced at these times. School Newspaper The McAuley newspaper, The McAuley Times, often writes columns following the year of McAuley FBLA. They cover stories such as FBLA fundraisers, or when FBLA goes to competitions. System Newsletter Our school also puts together a newsletter which goes out three times a year, describing events occurring in the Joplin Area Catholic School system. One of articles in the November Newsletter highlighted Jon Pekarek’s accomplishments in regards to qualifying for Nationals in FBLA. Since this newsletter is sent out to parents of all students throughout the system and all alumni, many people were able to see what McAuley FBLA was able to accomplish.
