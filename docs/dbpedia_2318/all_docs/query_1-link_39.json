        "text": "I warmly welcome you to the website of McAuley Catholic Primary School Rose Bay. Our community is located in the harbourside eastern suburb of Sydney, Rose Bay. Our school is a welcoming and hospitable community, where Mercy values underpin our purpose and actions. The charism of the sisters and in particular Catherine McAuley, continues to inspire us as we educate our students in the Catholic faith. Our school draws from the local parish community of St Mary Magdalene Rose Bay and the immediate local area.\n\nOur priority for our students is to be happy and successful learners, well placed to move forward in their future as confident, resilient learners in life. Our student centred spaces encourage active learning and collaboration with a focus that is relevant, rigorous and real world. Our focus is wellbeing and academic excellence; these priorities together ensure our students leave us prepared for the next stage of their education.\n\nAt McAuley Catholic Primary School, our pedagogy is innovative and engaging and we provide a rigorous and diversified curriculum with opportunities for inquiry learning, problem-solving, collaboration and decision-making. Our curriculum is child-centred, emphasising skills in Literacy and Numeracy where we create an environment that challenges, stimulates and celebrates learning.\n\nI am proud to lead a school that is focused upon providing a safe and secure environment in which each member of our school community is known and feels valued. We place great importance on fostering the confidence and self-esteem of our children by affirming their achievements and efforts.\n\nTogether as a school community we will build on the traditions of the past and meet the challenges of the future in innovative and exciting ways.\n\nMrs Nicole Jones\n\nPrincipal"
