        "text": "St Catherine's Catholic College, Singleton offers a unique educational experience for students from Kindergarten to Year 12, allowing students to complete both primary and secondary education at the one campus.\n\nNestled in the beautiful Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, St Catherine’s has a proud history of excellence and achievements in academic, sporting and cultural pursuits and offers a seamless transition for your child’s educational journey.\n\nSt Catherine's offers high quality education in a safe and happy learning community and challenges all students to reach their full potential, with all College staff deeply committed to effective and innovative teaching, taking particular care and interest in the learning needs and strengths of each student. Students are immersed in Early Learning strategies from Kindergarten and their progress is mapped for their entire schooling with intervention and extension strategies and activities offered as needed.\n\nWith a proven history of pleasing HSC results, being national finalists in Science and Engineering, having nominations for On Stage, Encore, Art Express and Showcase, being state finalists in debating and having a focus on iSTEM, over 90% of St Catherine's students obtain either entry to their chosen University course, their first choice of employment or are offered an apprenticeship. St Catherine's is also in the Singleton Community Learning Cluster Trade Training Centre initiative, in partnership with Singleton High School, Singleton Christian College and TAFE.\n\nSt Catherine’s offers a variety of sports across their internal and external sporting program including swimming, cross country, athletics, horse sports, netball, softball, tennis, soccer, rugby league, rugby union and touch football. Students also have the opportunity to participate in sport gala days and attend skills workshops with specialised coaches. For students interested in horse sports, the St Catherine’s horse sports program give students the option to compete in many different equestrian disciplines including dressage, show jumping and hack classes and the opportunity to attend several local horse sports days in Scone, Blandford, Singleton and Willow Tree.\n\nSt Catherine’s endeavours to provide an education that gives students the capacity to reach their full potential in visual arts, music, drama and dance. Students have the opportunity to participate in Creative Arts workshops, partake in a variety of ensembles including the college band, glee club, primary and senior choir, ukulele groups and dance club. Students from Kindergarten to Year 12 also have the opportunity to be involved in College productions, musicals and eisteddfods, as well as receive a range of instrumental and vocal private tuition from experienced peripatetic teachers onsite. The school also proudly hosts Diocesan Distance Education Dance where teachers deliver both face-to-face and video conferencing classes to students at a variety of schools where dance is not offered.\n\nOne of the unique features of St Catherine’s is the College farm. Major expansions of the agricultural department have seen an increase in machinery and facilities allowing the College to offer Agriculture as part of the curriculum for Years 8 and 9 along with a Primary Industries vocational training program for Years 11 and 12. Each course concentrates on developing the knowledge and skills required for modern agriculture in the 21st century.\n\nSt Catherine’s has a very successful Cattle Show Team where students have the opportunity to select, break in, prepare and present cattle for both the Autumn and Spring show season. The College also operates a small beef breeding program for cattle which allows the College to breed their own show animals.\n\nLocated within close proximity to the school is St Nicholas Early Education Singleton, which is an 80-place early education and care centre, delivering a play-based, child-centred and Reggio Emilia-inspired early learning experience for children aged 0-5 years.\n\nSt Catherine's Catholic College, Singleton accepts girls and boys, Years 7-12, from the areas of Branxton (where transport is more convenient than it is to Lochinvar) and Singleton."
