        "text": "Alison McGrorty-Crotts, M.D., M.P.H. ’04 is a board-certified pediatrician for the City of Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH). She dedicates her practice to treating the most vulnerable patient populations in North and South Philadelphia.\n\nWhile at Temple University, Alison earned a Bachelor of Arts in Communication Sciences and Disorders, a minor in Spanish, a place on the University Dean’s List and the Honors College Director’s List, and membership in the Alpha Epsilon Delta and Rho Lambda societies. While pursuing her degree at Temple University School of Medicine, she started the first student-run HIV clinic in Philadelphia to provide free rapid HIV testing to those living in homeless shelters and substance use recovery homes. She also volunteered at the Mazzoni Center to provide STI screening and treatment to the vulnerable LGBTQ+ community. Lastly, Dr. McGrorty spent several months of her final year of medical school in Nepal providing medical care as the lead physician at a remote medical outpost in Kolma Village in the Annapurna Mountains. Alison completed her pediatric residency at Thomas Jefferson University/Nemours-A.I DuPont Hospital for children.\n\nSince working for PDPH, Dr. McGrorty has cared for patients facing food and housing insecurity, aided her undocumented patients as they feared deportation in 2016, and protested with patients when the Black Lives Matter movement ignited. She cares for victims of gun violence and mourns their loss to that epidemic. Further, she has worked with Afghan and Ukrainian patients as they fled their countries and immigrated to Philadelphia.\n\nAt the start of the COVID pandemic, Dr. McGrorty saw an opportunity to help the struggling community at Strawberry Mansion Health Center in North Philadelphia. She created a food and necessities market within the health center. Strawberry Market provides a free and dignity-preserving shopping opportunity to any patient in need. The market has become a gateway for the social work team to assist patients in accessing more long-term food, housing, and insurance assistance.\n\nIn 2022, Dr. McGrorty graduated with highest honors from Temple University College of Public Health with her Master’s in Public Health—Health Policy and Management. In her spare time, Alison enjoys every minute she has with her three children and husband. She also loves to binge watch any show that Bravo has to offer."
