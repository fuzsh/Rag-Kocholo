McAuley High School is a Catholic Mercy school for girls only, situated in Otāhuhu, Auckland with a roll of 800 students. We offer classes from Year 9 to Year 13.

As a Catholic school, we have five Mercy values of Awhina, Whakarangatira, Aroha, Tika and Panekiretanga. These reflect the gospel values upon which everything flows. Christ is at the centre of all that we do at McAuley High School. Our students relate to each other as sisters and support each other, along with the staff, to become the best version of themselves.

McAuley High School is a safe, supportive school that encourages girls to be successful in all aspects of life. Students are fortunate to have teachers and staff who are passionate about giving all of our students the best opportunity to succeed.

We have high expectations for our students at McAuley High School. Attention is given to every student’s attendance, punctuality, uniform and behaviour, so that they can focus on their learning. We are a BYOD school, where every student is expected to bring a laptop to school daily.

We work in partnership with whanau so that together we provide the best possible environment for our girls. We continually strive to give students an outstanding, catholic education that is a joy to receive.
