SUNNYVALE, CA: AMD, a developer of computer processors and related technologies for business and consumer markets has announced an update to its CodeXL unified tool suite for developers designed to accelerate applications running on AMD processors.

CodeXL is AMD's primary developer tool for generating detailed information about the real-world performance of AMD processors (CPUs), Accelerated Processing Units (APUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). AMD CodeXL version 1.6 provides GPU profiling capabilities and API-level debugging for OpenCL 2.0 applications.

CodeXL 1.6 also introduces a new advanced tool for profiling APU power consumption, which enables developers to reduce the power requirements of their application. These features significantly bolster the tools available to developers for creating applications on either Windows or Linux that take advantage of the inherent processing capability of heterogeneous system architecture (HSA).
