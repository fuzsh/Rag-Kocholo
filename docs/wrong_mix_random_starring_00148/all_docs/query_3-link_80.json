It was created in 1895 as per Alfred Nobel’s will, a Swedish inventor, scientist, and philanthropist. The first prizes were given out in 1901, aimed at recognizing people who made big advances in areas like Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Literature, and Peace. Nobel, who invented dynamite and held more than 350 patents, left most of his fortune to start the Nobel Prizes.\n\nInitially, the prizes were for achievements in five areas, later adding the Economic Sciences category to honor Nobel’s memory. They’re given each year on December 10th, the day Nobel died, at ceremonies in Stockholm, Sweden, except for the Nobel Peace Prize, which is in Oslo, Norway. Nobel winners are chosen by committees and experts in each field who select candidates based on their exceptional contributions and impact.\n\nConclusion\n\nOver time, the Nobel Prize has faced debates over how winners are chosen and some fields not being included. Despite this, it remains a famous symbol of recognition, celebrating human accomplishments in science, literature, peace efforts, and economic research. The Nobel Prizes carry on Alfred Nobel’s vision by honoring people whose remarkable work has left a lasting positive impact on the world.\n\nRelated Resources:\n\nNobel Prize 2023 Winners List\n\nOscar Awards 2023 Winners\n\nNobel Prize 2023 GK Questions and MCQ Quiz 2023\n\nList of Gandhi Peace Prize Winners\n\nList of Kalinga Award Winners\n\nRamon Magsaysay Award Winners from India\n\nFAQs – Nobel Prize Winners of India\n\nQ1.
