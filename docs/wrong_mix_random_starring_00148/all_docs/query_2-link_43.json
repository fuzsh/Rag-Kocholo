Among his siblings, he was the youngest. He lost his mother when he was very young, his father was a traveler, and so he was mostly raised by his servants and maids. At a very young age, he was part of the Bengal Renaissance, and his family also took active participation in it. At the age of 8, he started writing poems and by the age of sixteen, he also started composing artworks and started publishing his poems under the pseudonym Bhanusimha. In 1877, he wrote the short story 'Bhikharini' and, in 1882, the collection of poems 'Sandhya Sangit'.\n\nHe was influenced by the classical poetry of Kalidasa and started writing his own classical poems. His sister, Swarnakumari, was a well-known novelist. In 1873, he toured with his father for several months and gained knowledge on several subjects. He learned Sikhism when he stayed at Amritsar and wrote around six poems and many articles on the religion.\n\nShankaracharya Jayanti: Birth Anniversary\n\nRabindranath Tagore: Education\n\nHis traditional education began in Brighton, East Sussex, England, at a public school. In 1878, he went to England to become a barrister to fulfill his father's wish.

He returned to India and married Mrinalini Devi.\n\nRabindranath Tagore: Established Shantiniketan\n\nHis father bought a huge land for meditation and named it Shantiniketan. Debendranath Tagore founded an 'Ashram' in 1863. In 1901, Rabindranath Tagore established an open-air school. It was a prayer hall with marble flooring and was named 'The Mandir'. It was also named 'Patha Bhavana' and started with only five students. Classes here were held under trees and followed the traditional Guru-Shishya method of teaching. This trend of teaching revived the ancient method of teaching, which proved beneficial when compared with the modernised method. Unfortunately, his wife and two children died and he left alone. At that time, he was very disturbed. In the meantime, his works started growing and became more popular among Bengali as well as foreign readers. In 1913, he gained recognition, was awarded the prestigious Nobel Prize in Literature, and became Asia's first Nobel Laureate. Shantiniketan is now a famous University town in West Bengal.\n\nLet us tell you that Rabindranath Tagore envisioned a centre of learning which would have the best of both the east and the west. He established the Visva Bharati University in West Bengal. It consists of two campuses, one at Shantiniketan and the other at Sriniketan.
