        "text": "Aminul Islam: Rabindranath Tagore was a Bengali poet, novelist and painter best known for being the first non-European to be awarded the Nobel Prize. He was the Bengali polymath who reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nThe great and legendary poet Tagore was born on May 7, 1861, the 25th Baishakh in Bangla calendar, in a zamindar (a holder or occupier of land) family in Kolkata.\n\nTagore died at the age of 80 on August 7, 1941 the 22nd of the Bengali month of Shraban. His anniversary of death is observed in Bangladesh on Sraban 22 in Bangla calendar.\n\nRabindranath was the first non-European poet who won Nobel Prize for literature. He won the prize in 1913 for ‘Song Offerings, the English translation of `Gitanjali`, an anthology of his poems.\n\nThe youngest of thirteen surviving children, Tagore was born in the Jorasanko mansion in Calcutta, India to parents Debendranath Tagore and Sarada Devi. The Tagore family came into prominence during the Bengal Renaissance that started during the age of Hussein Shah. The original name of the Tagore family was Banerjee. Being Brahmins, their ancestors were referred to as `Thakurmashai` or `Holy Sir`.\n\nRabi was raised mostly by servants; his mother had died in his early childhood and his father travelled widely. Tagore largely avoided classroom schooling and preferred to roam the manor or nearby Bolpur and Panihati, idylls which the family visited.\n\nTagore loathed formal education—his scholarly travails at the local Presidency College spanned a single day. Years later he held that proper teaching does not explain things; proper teaching stokes curiosity.\n\nBecause Debendranath wanted his son to become a barrister, Tagore enrolled at a public school in Brighton, East Sussex, England in 1878. He briefly read law at University College London, but again left school.\n\nHowever, his poetry in translation was viewed as spiritual, and this together with his mesmerizing persona gave him a prophet-like aura in the west. His \"elegant prose and magical poetry\" still remain largely unknown outside the confines of Bengal.\n\nA Pirali Brahmin from Kolkata, Tagore had been writing poetry since he was eight years old. At age 16, he published his first substantial poetry under the pseudonym (pen name) Bhanushingho (\"Sun Lion\") and wrote his first short stories and dramas in 1877."
