        "text": "A video of activist Rajiv Dixit talking about the origins of the Indian National Anthem and the role of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore is being shared on social media.\n\nWhat does he say in the video?: Dixit says that Tagore wrote the anthem to honour King George V, the then-ruler of India during British rule.\n\nAs per Dixit's statement, the monarch was so impressed by the praise in the song that he decided to award Tagore with the Nobel Prize in Literature, in his capacity as the chairman of the Nobel committee.\n\nHe says that Tagore was urged by MK Gandhi to return the award after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919, but Tagore refused to do so.\n\n(Archives of more claims can be seen here and here.)\n\nBut...?: The claim is false.\n\nWe found the same information on page 3 of a book titled 'Our National Songs', published by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, confirming that Tagore had not written a song to honour the British monarch.\n\nThe claim states that the British monarch was the chairperson of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nHowever, the transcript of the award ceremony speech on the Nobel Prize's website mentions that Herald Hj√§rne was the chairperson of the Swedish Academy in 1913 when Tagore was awarded the prize for the translated version of Gitanjali: Song Offerings (1912).\n\nTagore and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre: The last section of Dixit's speech says that Tagore was urged, by Gandhi, to return his Nobel prize after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919, as it was given to him by British colonists, but refused to do so.\n\nAs seen earlier in this report, Tagore's Nobel prize was awarded by the Swedish Academy, and not British colonists or George V.\n\nIn our investigation, we did not find any evidence to support the claim that Gandhi asked Tagore to return his Nobel prize.\n\nHowever, we found multiple reports about Tagore asking to be relieved of his knighthood, which conferred the title 'Sir' upon him and was given to him in 1915.\n\nPenned after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, Tagore expressed shame at carrying a title given to him by the British, saying that he wished to relinquish it in solidarity with his countrymen.\n\nConclusion: The national anthem of India was not written to King George V. Tagore, who was not given his Nobel Prize for Literature by the British monarch, and he did not refuse to return the prize.\n\n(Not convinced of a post or information you came across online and want it verified?
