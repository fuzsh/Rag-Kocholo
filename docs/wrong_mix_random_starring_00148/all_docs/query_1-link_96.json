        "text": "“We come nearest to the great when we are great in humility.”\n\n– Rabindranath Tagore\n\nThese wise words of Rabindranath Tagore hold the essence of his belief and his outlook toward a world that thrives in humanity. A luminary of Indian literature, he is a testament to India’s rich history of creativity, wisdom, and cultural pride.\n\nBorn on 7th May, 1861, Rabindranath Tagore lived as a renowned artist, a poet, and a social reformer who gave India its national anthem- “Jana Gana Mana”, the song that reflects the true fabric of India’s diverse and vibrant culture united harmoniously. His legacy transcends beyond geographical borders and his creations capture the essence of human emotion which has been weaved into all his works.\n\nAs a social reformer, Rabindranath Tagore played a critical role in shaping the freedom movement of India. Renouncing the title of knighthood by the British royalty to show his solidarity with his country after the Jallianwallah massacre, to investing his Nobel Prize award money into building a campus and a town in Bolpur, West Bengal, which today we recognize as Shantiniketan, he always encouraged the country to strive for progress and not just protest. One of the famous Rabindranath Tagore poems-\n\n“Akash Bhora Surjo Tara, Biswa Bhora Praan\n\nTahar-e majh khane ami peyechi mor sthaan”\n\n(The Sun and the stars fill the sky, the world full of life\n\nIn midst of this, I find my place)\n\nThese lines gave the countrymen of India, a new perspective on the freedom of India from the Colonial Raj for the first time. Through this poem, he explained the universality of man and how it was pertinent to see Independent India bloom with the seeds of peace and universal brotherhood.\n\nAbout Rabindranath Tagore- A legacy to learn from\n\nHailing from the famous Tagore family, who were at the forefront of the Bengal Renaissance, Rabindranath Tagore grew up in an environment that breathed and lived literature, theater and recitals of Bengali and Western classics. From a very young age, he was introduced to Indian classical music and trained by professional Dhrupad singers.\n\nSince childhood, he never resonated with a closed classroom setup, which eventually led him to promote the remodeling of the Indian education style towards a holistic development process where teachers would impart knowledge beyond books to the students. He built Shantiniketan to make everyone accustomed to the fact that “teaching does not explain things, but strokes curiosity.\n\nTagore’s literary journey began at an early age, with his first poem published at just sixteen. His masterpiece, “Gitanjali” (Song Offerings), a collection of lyrical poems, earned him the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913, making him the first non-European to receive such an honor.\n\nBeyond his poetry, Tagore’s literary oeuvre includes novels like “Gora” and “Chokher Bali,” which delve into complex human relationships and societal norms. His plays, such as “Chitra” and “The Post Office,” explore themes of freedom, spirituality, and humanism.\n\nHumanity & Humility- Rabindranath Tagore’s way\n\nEven after becoming a renowned personality at a young age, Tagore was always of the opinion that the real greatness of an individual is only when he keeps his feet on the ground, and finds joy in the act of service. Capturing the magnificence of humility and humanity, Rabindranath Tagore penned down one of his famous quotes-\n\n“I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy”.\n\nHe believed that it is through education that an individual can grow as a human because education is a path that fosters creativity, intellectual freedom and a sense of oneness with others.\n\nHighlighting the importance of holistic education, Rabindranath Tagore’s famous poem inspired people to be free to think critically and fearlessly-\n\n“Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high,\n\nWhere knowledge is free,\n\nWhere the world has not been broken up into fragments,\n\nBy narrow domestic walls”\n\nHis vision towards education is liberating and a guiding light for many of us. His views on how a society must open its hearts towards each other and uplift those in need is an inspiration for Smile Foundation.\n\nEducation being a critical focus of work, we also believe that it is through holistic and inclusive education for all, that we shall be able to build a society that thrives in progress and humility. By extending our help to those in need, and allowing them to build a dignified and sustainable life, Smile Foundation celebrates and shall continue cherishing Rabindranath Tagore Jayanti and his marvels of wisdom, universalism, and joy of serving others."
