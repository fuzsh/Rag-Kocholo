His literary works and contributions to world literature were recognised throughout the world. Rabindranath Tagore received the prestigious Nobel Prize in Literature on 13 November 1913. Let us get to know more about when did Rabindranath Tagore got the Nobel Prize and why did he received it for.\n\nRabindranath Tagore and His Contribution\n\nRabindranath Tagore was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature on November 13, 1913. He was honoured with this prestigious award for his book of poems,” Gitanjali”, which translated to “Song Offerings”. The Nobel Committee acknowledged Tagore’s contribution to the literary world and his ability to influence other cultural boundaries with his poetic brilliance.\n\nThe Nobel Prize ceremony took place in Stockholm, Sweden, on December 10, 1913. Tagore was unable to attend the ceremony in person due to health reasons, but his presence was felt through his poetry and writings. He was nominated by British poet Thomas Sturge Moore in the category of Literature.\n\nThe Swedish Academy praised Tagore by saying – “ because of his profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse, by which, with consummate skill, he has made his poetic thought, expressed in his own English words, a part of the literature of the West.”\n\nThe Bengali polymath, Tagore’s other famous works that were highly acclaimed are – Gora (“Fair-Faced”, 1910), Ghare-Baire (The Home and The World, 1916), etc. Tagore’s Nobel Prize win brought international acclaim and recognition to Indian Literature and culture, for future Indian writers and poets on the global stage.\n\nRelevant Blogs"
