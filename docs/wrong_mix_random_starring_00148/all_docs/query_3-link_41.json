        "text": "As of the year 2020, a total of 603 Nobel Prizes have been bestowed upon 962 recipients across all six categories. Many of the Nobel Prizes have been awarded jointly to multiple deserving individuals since its inception in 1901. Twelve of the awardees are Indians, according to the statement (five Indian citizens and seven of Indian ancestry or residency). In 1913, Rabindranath Tagore became the first Indian citizen and the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature. The sole female recipient is Mother Teresa. Nominated for both the Nobel Prize in Literature and the Nobel Prize in Peace, Sri Aurobindo was an Indian poet, philosopher, and nationalist, as well as the founder of Integral yoga.\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee announced on December 1st, 1999, that Mahatma Gandhi had been nominated for the Peace Prize five times but had been rejected each time (from 1937 to 1939, in 1947 and a few days before he was assassinated in January 1948). Norwegian Nobel Committee Secretary Geir Lundestad referred to it as the “biggest omission in our 106-year history” back in 2006.\n\nList of all Nobel prize winners from India\n\nHere is the list of all the nine Nobel laureates from india:-\n\nYoungest Nobel prize winner in the world\n\nMalala Yousafzai is the youngest person who has ever won this very valuable award. A young girl who fought against the religious authorities in her country to claim her rights and the rights of millions of other young girls.\n\nBBC wanted a young Pakistani girl to blog about how hard it is to live under the Taliban. Everyone they asked said no, because it was too dangerous. In a letter to the BBC, Ziauddin Yousufzai, a teacher, said that he had the perfect candidate at home.\n\nThe BBC published her handwritten notes about life in the Swat Valley in 2009. It was about how she was afraid of not being able to go to school because in that year, the Taliban banned all girls from going to school. The Taliban knew it was her even though she used a fake name.\n\nGunmen stopped Malala’s car as she came home from school when she was 17 years old. Inside, there were other girls. Malala was hit in the head and neck with bullets. Others were hurt less badly. She was taken to London as support for her grew around the world. People were blaming the country for letting her down. Her fight for girls’ right to go to school was now a worldwide movement.\n\nHer campaign went on for another two years after the attack. This time, it’s from London. Malala was in her London Chemistry class when a teacher came in and told her she was the youngest person in history to win a Nobel Prize.\n\nThe Noble organisation said that Malala and Indian child rights activist Kailash Satyarthi shared the award “for their fight against the oppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.”\n\nFirst Nobel prize winner in India\n\nRabindranath Tagore was the first person from India and the first person from Asia to win the Nobel Prize in 1913. The Nobel Prize in Literature was granted to him in honour of his work Geetanjali. Tagore was born in Kolkata, India. He began writing poetry at a young age. After completing his education in England in the late 1870s, he returned to India and began publishing poetry collections in the 1880s. Tagore built an experimental school in Shanti Niketan in 1901, where he attempted to combine the best of Indian and Western traditions. Tagore actively travelled, taught, and recited his poetry in Europe, the Americas, and East Asia, and he became an advocate for Indian freedom from British colonialism.\n\nThe literature of Rabindranath Tagore is strongly anchored in both Indian and Western academic traditions. In addition to fiction in the form of poetry, songs, stories, and dramas, it includes depictions of the lives of ordinary people, literary criticism, philosophy, and social themes. Tagore originally composed in Bengali, but after rewriting his poetry in English, he attracted a large audience in the West. In contrast to the hectic lifestyle of the West, his poetry was believed to portray the harmony of the spirit with nature.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Nobel Prize is a collection of worldwide honours that are bestowed upon recipients in recognition of their exceptional achievements in the fields of culture, academics, and scientific research. Both Swedish and Norwegian institutions are responsible for the presentation of these sets of awards. Indians have also achieved tremendous achievement in the areas of study that are eligible for Nobel Prizes, including those listed above. The first Nobel Prize was presented in 1901.In the year 1913, Rabindranath Tagore became the first person of Indian descent to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. After that, a large number of prominent Indians have been acknowledged as having been awarded the Nobel Prize.\n\nImportant pages"
