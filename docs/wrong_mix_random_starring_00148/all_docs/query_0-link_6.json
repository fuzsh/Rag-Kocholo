        "text": "Rabindranath Tagore, (born May 7, 1861, Calcutta, India—died Aug. 7, 1941, Calcutta), Bengali poet, writer, composer, and painter.\n\nThe son of Debendranath Tagore, he published several books of poetry, including Manasi, in his 20s. His later religious poetry was introduced to the West in Gitanjali (1912).\n\nThrough international travel and lecturing, he introduced aspects of Indian culture to the West and vice versa. He spoke ardently in favour of Indian independence; as a protest against the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, he repudiated the knighthood he had received in 1915. He founded an experimental school in Bengal where he sought to blend Eastern and Western philosophies; it became Vishva-Bharati University (1921).\n\nHe was awarded the 1913 Nobel Prize for Literature. He was the first non-European to win the prize."
