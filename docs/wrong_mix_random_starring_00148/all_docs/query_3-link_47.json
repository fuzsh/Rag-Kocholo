        "text": "Rabindranath Tagore was a famous Indian Bengali writer; he was a prolific writer and influential artist and a musician at the same time. He was born on May, 7 1861 and died on August 7, 1941. Tagore was a multi-talented personality with a strong desire to learn new things. He was also an educationist who established Viswa Bharati University. His contributions to the literature, music and other works are memorable.\n\nRabindranath Tagore's Early Life\n\nRabindranath Tagore was born on May 7, 1861, in Calcutta to Debendranath Tagore and Sarada Devi. His family was well-known for their talents in various fields. Raised in an environment rich in cultural and intellectual activities, Rabindranath was exposed to literature, music, and theater from a young age. His father, Debendranath Tagore, was a prominent figure in the Brahmo Samaj, a religious movement in Bengal.\n\nRabindranath Tagore's Education\n\nRabindranath's education started in England at a public school in Brighton, where his father sent him with the intention of becoming a barrister. However, Rabindranath was not fond of conventional schooling and preferred exploring literature, including the works of Shakespeare, on his own. He briefly attended University College London but left to pursue his interests independently. Upon his return to India, he married Mrinalini Devi at a young age.\n\nRabindranath Tagore later founded Visva Bharati University in Shantiniketan, where he was affectionately called \"Gurudev\" by his students. This institution emphasized a holistic approach to education, welcoming students from all backgrounds. Classes were often held outdoors under the shade of large banyan trees, fostering a unique learning environment.\n\nRabindranath Tagore Political Influence\n\nDespite his literary and cultural contributions, Rabindranath Tagore was also politically engaged. He criticized British rule and was vocal about the shortcomings of his fellow Indians. In a notable act of protest against the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, he renounced his knighthood. His love for his country and its people transcended personal acclaim or material gain, reflecting his deep patriotism and social consciousness."
