        "text": "Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) was a Bengali writer, composer, theatre director and philosopher who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913. He briefly read law at University College, London, but didn’t complete his studies. Tagore opted instead for independent study of Shakespeare's plays 'Coriolanus' and 'Antony and Cleopatra'. He wrote a poem entitled ‘In Honour of William Shakespeare’ to commemorate the Tercentenary of Shakespeare's death in 1916. In it he praises the playwright as both an English and a world poet. An engraving of this poem can be seen along with a bust of Tagore in the garden of Shakespeare’s Birthplace. The translation into English reads:\n\n'When by the far-away sea your fiery disk appeared from behind the unseen, O Poet, O Sun.\n\nEngland’s horizon felt you near her breast, and took you to be her own.\n\nShe kissed your forehead, caught you in the arms of her forest branches.\n\nHid you behind her mist mantle and watched you in the green sward where fairies love to play among the meadow flowers.\n\nA few early birds sang your hymn of praise, while the rest of the woodland choir were asleep.\n\nThen at the silent beckoning of the Eternal you rose higher and higher till you reached the mid sky, making all quarters of heaven your own.\n\nTherefore, at this moment, after the end of centuries, the palm groves by the Indian sea raise their tremulous branches to the sky murmuring your praise.'\n\nImage credit\n\nTablet inscribed with the poem 'In Honour of William Shakespeare'\n\nRabindranath Tagore\n\n1916\n\nIvory"
