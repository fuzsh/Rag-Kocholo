        "text": "Ten\n\nYour flute plays the exact notes of my pain.\n\nIt toys with me.\n\nWhere did you learn such stealth,\n\nsuch subtle wounding, Kan?\n\nThe arrows in my breast\n\nburn even in rain and wind.\n\nWasted moments pulse around me,\n\nwishes and desires, departing happiness—\n\nMaster, my soul scorches.\n\nI think you can see its heat in my eyes,\n\nits intensity and cruelty. So let me drown\n\nin the cool and consoling Yamuna,\n\nor slake my desire in your cool,\n\nconsoling, changing-moon face.\n\nIt’s the face I’ll see in death.\n\nHere’s my wish and pledge:\n\nthat that same moon will spill its white pollen\n\ndown through the roof of flowers\n\ninto the grove, where I’ll consecrate my life\n\nto it forever, and be its flute-breath,\n\nthe perfume that hangs upon the air,\n\nmaking all the young girls melancholy.\n\nThat’s my prayer."
