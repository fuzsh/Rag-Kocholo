He was the son of William Burnes, or Burness, at the time of the poetâs birth a nurseryman on the banks of the Doon in Ayrshire. His father, though always extremely poor, attempted to give his children a fair education, and Robert, who was the eldest, went to school for three years in a neighboring village, and later, for shorter periods, to three other schools in the vicinity. But it was to his father and to his own reading that he owed the more important part of his education; and by the time that he had reached manhood he had a good knowledge of English, a reading knowledge of French, and a fairly wide acquaintance with the masterpieces of English literature from the time of Shakespeare to his own day. In 1766 William Burness rented on borrowed money the farm of Mount Oliphant, and in taking his share in the effort to make this undertaking succeed, the future poet seems to have seriously overstrained his physique. In 1771 the family move to Lochlea, and Burns went to the neighboring town of Irvine to learn flax-dressing. The only result of this experiment, however, was the formation of an acquaintance with a dissipated sailor, whom he afterward blamed as the prompter of his first licentious adventures. His father died in 1784, and with his brother Gilbert the poet rented the farm of Mossgiel; but this venture was as unsuccessful as the others. He had meantime formed an irregular intimacy with Jean Armour, for which he was censured by the Kirk-session. As a result of his farming misfortunes, and the attempts of his father-in-law to overthrow his irregular marriage with Jean, he resolved to emigrate; and in order to raise money for the passage he published (Kilmarnock, 1786) a volume of the poems which he had been composing from time to time for some years. This volume was unexpectedly successful, so that, instead of sailing for the West Indies, he went up to Edinburgh, and during that winter he was the chief literary celebrity of the season. An enlarged edition of his poems was published there in 1787, and the money derived from this enabled him to aid his brother in Mossgiel, and to take and stock for himself the farm of Ellisland in Dumfriesshire. His fame as poet had reconciled the Armours to the connection, and having now regularly married Jean, he brought her to Ellisland, and once more tried farming for three years. Continued ill-success, however, led him, in 1791, to abandon Ellisland, and he moved to Dumfries, where he had obtained a position in the Excise. But he was now thoroughly discouraged; his work was mere drudgery; his tendency to take his relaxation in debauchery increased the weakness of a constitution early undermined; and he died at Dumfries in his thirty-eighth year.\n\nIt is not necessary here to attempt to disentangle or explain away the numerous amours in which he was engaged through the greater part of his life. It is evident that Burns was a man of extremely passionate nature and fond of conviviality; and the misfortunes of his lot combined with his natural tendencies to drive him to frequent excesses of self-indulgence. He was often remorseful, and he strove painfully, if intermittently, after better things. But the story of his life must be admitted to be in its externals a painful and somewhat sordid chronicle. That it contained, however, many moments of joy and exaltation is proved by the poems here printed.\n\nBurnsâ poetry falls into two main groups: English and Scottish. His English poems are, for the most part, inferior specimens of conventional eighteenth-century verse. But in Scottish poetry he achieved triumphs of a quite extraordinary kind. Since the time of the Reformation and the union of the crowns of England and Scotland, the Scots dialect had largely fallen into disuse as a medium for dignified writing. Shortly before Burnsâ time, however, Allan Ramsay and Robert Fergusson had been the leading figures in a revival of the vernacular, and Burns received from them a national tradition which he succeeded in carrying to its highest pitch, becoming thereby, to an almost unique degree, the poet of his people.\n\nHe first showed complete mastery of verse in the field of satire. In âThe Twa Herds,â âHoly Willieâs Prayer,â âAddress to the Unco Guid,â âThe Holy Fair,â and others, he manifested sympathy with the protest of the so-called âNew Lightâ party, which had sprung up in opposition to the extreme Calvinism and intolerance of the dominant âAuld Lichts.â The fact that Burns had personally suffered from the discipline of the Kirk probably added fire to his attacks, but the satires show more than personal animus. The force of the invective, the keenness of the wit, and the fervor of the imagination which they displayed, rendered them an important force in the theological liberation of Scotland.\n\nThe Kilmarnock volume contained, besides satire, a number of poems like âThe Twa Dogsâ and âThe Cotterâs Saturday Night,â which are vividly descriptive of the Scots peasant life with which he was most familiar; and a group like âPuir Mailieâ and âTo a Mouse,â which, in the tenderness of their treatment of animals, revealed one of the most attractive sides of Burnsâ personality. Many of his poems were never printed during his lifetime, the most remarkable of these being âThe Jolly Beggars,â a piece in which, by the intensity of his imaginative sympathy and the brilliance of his technique, he renders a picture of the lowest dregs of society in such a way as to raise it into the realm of great poetry.\n\nBut the real national importance of Burns is due chiefly to his songs. The Puritan austerity of the centuries following the Reformation had discouraged secular music, like other forms of art, in Scotland; and as a result Scottish song had become hopelessly degraded in point both of decency and literary quality. From youth Burns had been interested in collecting the fragments he had heard sung or found printed, and he came to regard the rescuing of this almost lost national inheritance in the light of a vocation. About his song-making, two points are especially noteworthy: first, that the greater number of his lyrics sprang from actual emotional experiences; second, that almost all were composed to old melodies. While in Edinburgh he undertook to supply material for Johnsonâs âMusical Museum,â and as few of the traditional songs could appear in a respectable collection, Burns found it necessary to make them over. Sometimes he kept a stanza or two; sometimes only a line or chorus; sometimes merely the name of the air; the rest was his own. His method, as he has told us himself, was to become familiar with the traditional melody, to catch a suggestion from some fragment of the old song, to fix upon an idea or situation for the new poem; then, humming or whistling the tune as he went about his work, he wrought out the new verses, going into the house to write them down when the inspiration began to flag. In this process is to be found the explanation of much of the peculiar quality of the songs of Burns. Scarcely any known author has succeeded so brilliantly in combining his work with folk material, or in carrying on with such continuity of spirit the tradition of popular song. For George Thomsonâs collection of Scottish airs he performed a function similar to that which he had had in the âMuseumâ; and his poetical activity during the last eight or nine years of his life was chiefly devoted to these two publications. In spite of the fact that he was constantly in severe financial straits, he refused to accept any recompense for this work, preferring to regard it as a patriotic service. And it was, indeed, a patriotic service of no small magnitude. By birth and temperament he was singularly fitted for the task, and this fitness is proved by the unique extent to which his productions were accepted by his countrymen, and have passed into the life and feeling of his race.\n\n1771 - 1779\n\nTuneââI am a man unmarried.â\n\n[Footnote 1: The first of my performances.âR. B.] Once I lovâd a bonie lass, Ay, and I love her still; And whilst that virtue warms my breast, Iâll love my handsome Nell. As bonie lasses I hae seen, And mony full as braw; But, for a modest gracefuâ mein, The like I never saw. A bonie lass, I will confess, Is pleasant to the eâe; But, without some better qualities, Sheâs no a lass for me. But Nellyâs looks are blythe and sweet, And what is best of aâ, Her reputation is complete, And fair without a flaw. She dresses aye sae clean and neat, Both decent and genteel; And then thereâs something in her gait Gars ony dress look weel. A gaudy dress and gentle air May slightly touch the heart; But itâs innocence and modesty That polishes the dart. âTis this in Nelly pleases me, âTis this enchants my soul; For absolutely in my breast She reigns without control.\n\nSongâO Tibbie, I Hae Seen The Day\n\nTuneââInvercauldâs Reel, or Strathspey.â\n\nChoir.âO Tibbie, I hae seen the day, Ye wadna been sae shy; For laik oâ gear ye lightly me, But, trowth, I care na by.

The wife of my bosom, alas! she did die; for sweet consolation to church I did fly; I found that old Solomon proved it fair, That a big-bellyâd bottleâs a cure for all care. I once was persuaded a venture to make; A letter informâd me that all was to wreck; But the pursy old landlord just waddlâd upstairs, With a glorious bottle that ended my cares. âLifeâs cares they are comfortsââa maxim laid down By the Bard, what dâye call him, that wore the black gown; And faith I agree with thâ old prig to a hair, For a big-bellyâd bottleâs a heavân of a care.\n\nA Stanza Added In A Mason Lodge\n\nThen fill up a bumper and make it oâerflow, And honours masonic prepare for to throw; May evâry true Brother of the Compass and Square Have a big-bellyâd bottle when harassâd with care.\n\nMy Father Was A Farmer\n\nTuneââThe weaver and his shuttle, O.â\n\nMy father was a farmer upon the Carrick border, O, And carefully he bred me in decency and order, O; He bade me act a manly part, though I had neâer a farthing, O; For without an honest manly heart, no man was worth regarding, O. Then out into the world my course I did determine, O; Thoâ to be rich was not my wish, yet to be great was charming, O; My talents they were not the worst, nor yet my education, O: Resolvâd was I at least to try to mend my situation, O. In many a way, and vain essay, I courted Fortuneâs favour, O; Some cause unseen still stept between, to frustrate each endeavour, O; Sometimes by foes I was oâerpowerâd, sometimes by friends forsaken, O; And when my hope was at the top, I still was worst mistaken, O. Then sore harassâd and tirâd at last, with Fortuneâs vain delusion, O, I dropt my schemes, like idle dreams, and came to this conclusion, O; The past was bad, and the future hid, its good or ill untried, O; But the present hour was in my powâr, and so I would enjoy it, O. No help, nor hope, nor view had I, nor person to befriend me, O; So I must toil, and sweat, and moil, and labour to sustain me, O; To plough and sow, to reap and mow, my father bred me early, O; For one, he said, to labour bred, was a match for Fortune fairly, O. Thus all obscure, unknown, and poor, throâ life Iâm doomâd to wander, O, Till down my weary bones I lay in everlasting slumber, O: No view nor care, but shun whateâer might breed me pain or sorrow, O; I live to-day as wellâs I may, regardless of to-morrow, O. But cheerful still, I am as well as a monarch in his palace, O, Thoâ Fortuneâs frown still hunts me down, with all her wonted malice, O: I make indeed my daily bread, but neâer can make it farther, O: But as daily bread is all I need, I do not much regard her, O. When sometimes by my labour, I earn a little money, O, Some unforeseen misfortune comes genârally upon me, O; Mischance, mistake, or by neglect, or my goodnaturâd folly, O: But come what will, Iâve sworn it still, Iâll neâer be melancholy, O. All you who follow wealth and power with unremitting ardour, O, The more in this you look for bliss, you leave your view the farther, O: Had you the wealth Potosi boasts, or nations to adore you, O, A cheerful honest-hearted clown I will prefer before you, O.\n\nJohn Barleycorn: A Ballad\n\nThere was three kings into the east, Three kings both great and high, And they hae sworn a solemn oath John Barleycorn should die. They took a plough and ploughâd him down, Put clods upon his head, And they hae sworn a solemn oath John Barleycorn was dead. But the cheerful Spring came kindly on, And showârs began to fall; John Barleycorn got up again, And sore surprisâd them all. The sultry suns of Summer came, And he grew thick and strong; His head weel armâd wiâ pointed spears, That no one should him wrong. The sober Autumn enterâd mild, When he grew wan and pale; His bending joints and drooping head Showâd he began to fail. His colour sickenâd more and more, He faded into age; And then his enemies began To show their deadly rage. Theyâve taen a weapon, long and sharp, And cut him by the knee; Then tied him fast upon a cart, Like a rogue for forgerie. They laid him down upon his back, And cudgellâd him full sore; They hung him up before the storm, And turned him oâer and oâer. They filled up a darksome pit With water to the brim; They heaved in John Barleycorn, There let him sink or swim. They laid him out upon the floor, To work him farther woe; And still, as signs of life appearâd, They tossâd him to and fro. They wasted, oâer a scorching flame, The marrow of his bones; But a miller usâd him worst of all, For he crushâd him between two stones. And they hae taen his very heartâs blood, And drank it round and round; And still the more and more they drank, Their joy did more abound. John Barleycorn was a hero bold, Of noble enterprise; For if you do but taste his blood, âTwill make your courage rise. âTwill make a man forget his woe; âTwill heighten all his joy; âTwill make the widowâs heart to sing, Thoâ the tear were in her eye. Then let us toast John Barleycorn, Each man a glass in hand; And may his great posterity Neâer fail in old Scotland!\n\n1783\n\nDeath And Dying Words Of Poor Mailie, The Authorâs Only Pet Yowe., The\n\nAn Unco Mournfuâ Tale\n\nAs Mailie, anâ her lambs thegither, Was ae day nibbling on the tether, Upon her cloot she coost a hitch, Anâ owre she warslâd in the ditch: There, groaning, dying, she did lie, When Hughoc he cam doytin by.

Corn rigs, anâ barley rigs, Anâ corn rigs are bonie: Iâll neâer forget that happy night, Amang the rigs wiâ Annie. The sky was blue, the wind was still, The moon was shining clearly; I set her down, wiâ right good will, Amang the rigs oâ barley: I kenât her heart was aâ my ain; I lovâd her most sincerely; I kissâd her owre and owre again, Amang the rigs oâ barley.

The partridge loves the fruitful fells, The plover loves the mountains; The woodcock haunts the lonely dells, The soaring hern the fountains: Throâ lofty groves the cushat roves, The path of man to shun it; The hazel bush oâerhangs the thrush, The spreading thorn the linnet. Thus evâry kind their pleasure find, The savage and the tender; Some social join, and leagues combine, Some solitary wander: Avaunt, away! the cruel sway, Tyrannic manâs dominion; The sportsmanâs joy, the murdâring cry, The fluttâring, gory pinion! But, Peggy dear, the evâningâs clear, Thick flies the skimming swallow, The sky is blue, the fields in view, All fading-green and yellow: Come let us stray our gladsome way, And view the charms of Nature; The rustling corn, the fruited thorn, And evâry happy creature. Weâll gently walk, and sweetly talk, Till the silent moon shine clearly; Iâll grasp thy waist, and, fondly prest, Swear how I love thee dearly: Not vernal showârs to budding flowârs, Not Autumn to the farmer, So dear can be as thou to me, My fair, my lovely charmer!\n\nSong\n\nTuneââMy Nanie, O.â\n\nBehind yon hills where Lugar flows, âMang moors anâ mosses many, O, The wintry sun the day has closâd, And Iâll awa to Nanie, O.

O burning hell! in all thy store of torments Thereâs not a keener lash!

Some auld, usâd hands had taen a note, That sic a hen had got a shot; I was suspected for the plot; I scornâd to lie; So gat the whissle oâ my groat, Anâ payât the fee. But by my gun, oâ guns the wale, Anâ by my pouther anâ my hail, Anâ by my hen, anâ by her tail, I vow anâ swear! The game shall pay, oâer muir anâ dale, For this, niest year.

Trowth, they had muckle for to blame! âTwas neither broken wing nor limb, But twa-three draps about the wame, Scarce throâ the feathers; Anâ baith a yellow George to claim, Anâ thole their blethers!

Welcome! my bonie, sweet, wee dochter, Thoâ ye come here a wee unsought for, And thoâ your cominâ I hae fought for, Baith kirk and queir; Yet, by my faith, yeâre no unwrought for, That I shall swear! Wee image oâ my bonie Betty, As fatherly I kiss and daut thee, As dear, and near my heart I set thee Wiâ as gude will As aâ the priests had seen me get thee Thatâs out oâ hell. Sweet fruit oâ mony a merry dint, My funny toil is now aâ tint, Sinâ thou came to the warlâ asklent, Which fools may scoff at; In my last plack thy partâs be inât The better haâf oât. Thoâ I should be the waur bestead, Thouâs be as braw and bienly clad, And thy young years as nicely bred Wiâ education, As ony brat oâ wedlockâs bed, In aâ thy station. Lord grant that thou may aye inherit Thy mitherâs person, grace, anâ merit, Anâ thy poor, worthless daddyâs spirit, Without his failins, âTwill please me mair to see thee heir it, Than stockit mailens. For if thou be what I wad hae thee, And tak the counsel I shall gie thee, Iâll never rue my trouble wiâ thee, The cost nor shame oât, But be a loving father to thee, And brag the name oât.\n\n[Footnote 1: Burns never published this poem.] O leave novels, ye Mauchline belles, Yeâre safer at your spinning-wheel; Such witching books are baited hooks For rakish rooks, like Rob Mossgiel; Your fine Tom Jones and Grandisons, They make your youthful fancies reel; They heat your brains, and fire your veins, And then youâre prey for Rob Mossgiel. Beware a tongue thatâs smoothly hung, A heart that warmly seems to feel; That feeling heart but acts a partâ âTis rakish art in Rob Mossgiel. The frank address, the soft caress, Are worse than poisoned darts of steel; The frank address, and politesse, Are all finesse in Rob Mossgiel.\n\nFragmentâThe Mauchline Lady\n\nTuneââI had a horse, I had nae mair.â\n\nWhen first I came to Stewart Kyle, My mind it was na steady; Whereâer I gaed, whereâer I rade, A mistress still I had aye. But when I came rounâ by Mauchline toun, Not dreadin anybody, My heart was caught, before I thought, And by a Mauchline lady.\n\nFragmentâMy Girl Sheâs Airy\n\nTuneââBlack Jock.â\n\nMy girl sheâs airy, sheâs buxom and gay; Her breath is as sweet as the blossoms in May; A touch of her lips it ravishes quite: Sheâs always good naturâd, good humourâd, and free; She dances, she glances, she smiles upon me; I never am happy when out of her sight.\n\nThe Belles Of Mauchline\n\nIn Mauchline there dwells six proper young belles, The pride of the place and its neighbourhood aâ; Their carriage and dress, a stranger would guess, In Lonâon or Paris, theyâd gotten it aâ. Miss Miller is fine, Miss Marklandâs divine, Miss Smith she has wit, and Miss Betty is braw: Thereâs beauty and fortune to get wiâ Miss Morton, But Armourâs the jewel for me oâ them aâ.\n\nEpitaph On A Noisy Polemic\n\nBelow thir stanes lie Jamieâs banes; O Death, itâs my opinion, Thou neâer took such a blethârin bitch Into thy dark dominion!\n\nEpitaph On A Henpecked Country Squire\n\nAs father Adam first was foolâd, (A case thatâs still too common,) Here lies man a woman ruled, The devil ruled the woman.\n\nEpigram On The Said Occasion\n\nO Death, hadâst thou but sparâd his life, Whom we this day lament, We freely wad exchanged the wife, And aâ been weel content.

But Queen Netherplace, of a diffârent complexion, When called on to order the funâral direction, Would have eat her dead lord, on a slender pretence, Not to show her respect, butâto save the expense!\n\nOn Tam The Chapman\n\nAs Tam the chapman on a day, WiâDeath forgatherâd by the way, Weel pleasâd, he greets a wight so famous, And Death was nae less pleasâd wiâ Thomas, Wha cheerfully lays down his pack, And there blaws up a hearty crack: His social, friendly, honest heart Sae tickled Death, they could na part; Sae, after viewing knives and garters, Death taks him hame to gie him quarters.\n\nEpitaph On John Rankine\n\nAe day, as Death, that gruesome carl, Was driving to the tither warlâ A mixtieâmaxtie motley squad, And mony a guilt-bespotted ladâ Black gowns of each denomination, And thieves of every rank and station, From him that wears the star and garter, To him that wintles in a halter: Ashamed himself to see the wretches, He mutters, glowrin at the bitches, âBy God Iâll not be seen behint them, Nor âmang the spâritual core present them, Without, at least, ae honest man, To grace this damnâd infernal clan!â By Adamhill a glance he threw, âLord God!â quoth he, âI have it now; Thereâs just the man I want, iâ faith!â And quickly stoppit Rankineâs breath.\n\nLines On The Authorâs Death\n\nWritten With The Supposed View Of Being Handed To Rankine After The Poetâs Interment\n\nHe who of Rankine sang, lies stiff and dead, And a green grassy hillock hides his head; Alas! alas! a devilish change indeed.\n\nMan Was Made To Mourn: A Dirge\n\nWhen chill Novemberâs surly blast Made fields and forests bare, One evâning, as I wanderâd forth Along the banks of Ayr, I spied a man, whose aged step Seemâd weary, worn with care; His face furrowâd oâer with years, And hoary was his hair. âYoung stranger, whither wandârest thou?â Began the revârend sage; âDoes thirst of wealth thy step constrain, Or youthful pleasureâs rage? Or haply, prest with cares and woes, Too soon thou hast began To wander forth, with me to mourn The miseries of man. âThe sun that overhangs yon moors, Out-spreading far and wide, Where hundreds labour to support A haughty lordlingâs pride;â Iâve seen yon weary winter-sun Twice forty times return; And evâry time has added proofs, That man was made to mourn. âO man! while in thy early years, How prodigal of time! Mis-spending all thy precious hoursâ Thy glorious, youthful prime! Alternate follies take the sway; Licentious passions burn; Which tenfold force gives Natureâs law. That man was made to mourn. âLook not alone on youthful prime, Or manhoodâs active might; Man then is useful to his kind, Supported in his right: But see him on the edge of life, With cares and sorrows worn; Then Age and Wantâoh! ill-matchâd pairâ Shew man was made to mourn. âA few seem favourites of fate, In pleasureâs lap carest; Yet, think not all the rich and great Are likewise truly blest: But oh! what crowds in evâry land, All wretched and forlorn, Throâ weary life this lesson learn, That man was made to mourn. âMany and sharp the numârous ills Inwoven with our frame! More pointed still we make ourselves, Regret, remorse, and shame! And man, whose heavân-erected face The smiles of love adorn,â Manâs inhumanity to man Makes countless thousands mourn! âSee yonder poor, oâerlabourâd wight, So abject, mean, and vile, Who begs a brother of the earth To give him leave to toil; And see his lordly fellow-worm The poor petition spurn, Unmindful, thoâ a weeping wife And helpless offspring mourn. âIf Iâm designâd yon lordlingâs slave, By Natureâs law designâd, Why was an independent wish Eâer planted in my mind? If not, why am I subject to His cruelty, or scorn? Or why has man the will and powâr To make his fellow mourn? âYet, let not this too much, my son, Disturb thy youthful breast: This partial view of human-kind Is surely not the last! The poor, oppressed, honest man Had never, sure, been born, Had there not been some recompense To comfort those that mourn! âO Death! the poor manâs dearest friend, The kindest and the best! Welcome the hour my aged limbs Are laid with thee at rest! The great, the wealthy fear thy blow From pomp and pleasure torn; But, oh! a blest relief for those That weary-laden mourn!â\n\nThe Twa Herds; Or, The Holy Tulyie\n\nAn Unco Mournfuâ Tale\n\nâBlockheads with reason wicked wits abhor, But fool with fool is barbarous civil war,ââPope. O aâ ye pious godly flocks, Weel fed on pastures orthodox, Wha now will keep you frae the fox, Or worrying tykes? Or wha will tent the waifs anâ crocks, About the dykes? The twa best herds in aâ the wast, The eâer gaâe gospel horn a blast These five anâ twenty simmers pastâ Oh, dool to tell! Hae had a bitter black out-cast Atween themselâ. O, Moddie,1 man, anâ wordy Russell,2 How could you raise so vile a bustle; Yeâll see how New-Light herds will whistle, Anâ think it fine! The Lordâs cause neâer gat sic a twistle, Sinâ I hae minâ. O, sirs! whaeâer wad hae expeckit Your duty ye wad sae negleckit, Ye wha were neâer by lairds respeckit To wear the plaid; But by the brutes themselves eleckit, To be their guide. What flock wiâ Moodieâs flock could rank?â Sae hale and hearty every shank! Nae poisonâd soor Arminian stank He let them taste; Frae Calvinâs well, aye clear, drank,â O, sic a feast!

What herd like Russell tellâd his tale; His voice was heard throâ muir and dale, He kennâd the Lordâs sheep, ilka tail, Owre aâ the height; Anâ saw gin they were sick or hale, At the first sight. He fine a mangy sheep could scrub, Or nobly fling the gospel club, And New-Light herds could nicely drub Or pay their skin; Could shake them oâer the burning dub, Or heave them in. Sic twaâO! do I live to seeât?â Sic famous twa should disagreeât, And names, like âvillain,â âhypocrite,â Ilk ither giâen, While New-Light herds, wiâ laughin spite, Say neitherâs liein!

While frosty winds blaw in the drift, Ben to the chimla lug, I grudge a wee the great-folkâs gift, That live sae bien anâ snug: I tent less, and want less Their roomy fire-side; But hanker, and canker, To see their cursed pride. Itâs hardly in a bodyâs powâr To keep, at times, frae being sour, To see how things are sharâd; How best oâ chiels are whiles in want, While coofs on countless thousands rant, And ken na how to wairât; But, Davie, lad, neâer fash your head, Thoâ we hae little gear; Weâre fit to win our daily bread, As langâs weâre hale and fier: âMair spier na, nor fear na,â1 Auld age neâer mind a feg; The last oât, the warst oât Is only but to beg. To lie in kilns and barns at eâen, When banes are crazâd, and bluid is thin, Is doubtless, great distress! [Footnote 1: Ramsay.âR. B.] Yet then content could make us blest; Evân then, sometimes, weâd snatch a taste Of truest happiness. The honest heart thatâs free frae aâ Intended fraud or guile, However Fortune kick the baâ, Has aye some cause to smile; Anâ mind still, youâll find still, A comfort this nae smaâ; Nae mair then weâll care then, Nae farther can we faâ. What thoâ, like commoners of air, We wander out, we know not where, But either house or halâ, Yet natureâs charms, the hills and woods, The sweeping vales, and foaming floods, Are free alike to all. In days when daisies deck the ground, And blackbirds whistle clear, With honest joy our hearts will bound, To see the coming year: On braes when we please, then, Weâll sit anâ sowth a tune; Syne rhyme tillât weâll time tillât, Anâ singât when we hae done. Itâs no in titles nor in rank; Itâs no in wealth like Lonâon bank, To purchase peace and rest: Itâs no in makinâ muckle, mair; Itâs no in books, itâs no in lear, To make us truly blest: If happiness hae not her seat Anâ centre in the breast, We may be wise, or rich, or great, But never can be blest; Nae treasures, nor pleasures Could make us happy lang; The heart ayeâs the part aye That makes us right or wrang. Think ye, that sic as you and I, Wha drudge anâ drive throâ wet and dry, Wiâ never-ceasing toil; Think ye, are we less blest than they, Wha scarcely tent us in their way, As hardly worth their while? Alas! how aft in haughty mood, Godâs creatures they oppress! Or else, neglecting aâ thatâs guid, They riot in excess! Baith careless and fearless Of either heaven or hell; Esteeming and deeming Itâs aâ an idle tale! Then let us cheerfuâ acquiesce, Nor make our scanty pleasures less, By pining at our state: And, even should misfortunes come, I, here wha sit, hae met wiâ someâ Anâs thankfuâ for them yet. They gie the wit of age to youth; They let us ken ourselâ; They make us see the naked truth, The real guid and ill: Thoâ losses anâ crosses Be lessons right severe, Thereâs wit there, yeâll get there, Yeâll find nae other where. But tent me, Davie, ace oâ hearts! (To say aught less wad wrang the cartes, And flattâry I detest) This life has joys for you and I; Anâ joys that riches neâer could buy, Anâ joys the very best. Thereâs aâ the pleasures oâ the heart, The lover anâ the frienâ; Ye hae your Meg, your dearest part, And I my darling Jean! It warms me, it charms me, To mention but her name: It heats me, it beets me, Anâ sets me aâ on flame! O all ye Powârs who rule above! O Thou whose very self art love! Thou knowâst my words sincere! The life-blood streaming throâ my heart, Or my more dear immortal part, Is not more fondly dear! When heart-corroding care and grief Deprive my soul of rest, Her dear idea brings relief, And solace to my breast. Thou Being, All-seeing, O hear my fervent prayâr; Still take her, and make her Thy most peculiar care! All hail! ye tender feelings dear! The smile of love, the friendly tear, The sympathetic glow! Long since, this worldâs thorny ways Had numberâd out my weary days, Had it not been for you! Fate still has blest me with a friend, In evâry care and ill; And oft a more endearing bandâ A tie more tender still. It lightens, it brightens The tenebrific scene, To meet with, and greet with My Davie, or my Jean! O, how that name inspires my style! The words come skelpin, rank anâ file, Amaist before I ken! The ready measure rins as fine, As Phoebus anâ the famous Nine Were glowrin owre my pen. My spaviet Pegasus will limp, Till ance heâs fairly het; And then heâll hilch, and stilt, anâ jimp, And rin an unco fit: But least then the beast then Should rue this hasty ride, Iâll light now, and dight now His sweaty, wizenâd hide.\n\nHoly Willieâs Prayer\n\nâAnd send the godly in a pet to pray.ââPope.\n\nArgument.\n\nHoly Willie was a rather oldish bachelor elder, in the parish of Mauchline, and much and justly famed for that polemical chattering, which ends in tippling orthodoxy, and for that spiritualized bawdry which refines to liquorish devotion. In a sessional process with a gentleman in Mauchlineâa Mr. Gavin HamiltonâHoly Willie and his priest, Father Auld, after full hearing in the presbytery of Ayr, came off but second best; owing partly to the oratorical powers of Mr. Robert Aiken, Mr. Hamiltonâs counsel; but chiefly to Mr. Hamiltonâs being one of the most irreproachable and truly respectable characters in the county. On losing the process, the muse overheard him [Holy Willie] at his devotions, as follows:â\n\nO Thou, who in the heavens does dwell, Who, as it pleases best Thyselâ, Sends ane to heaven anâ ten to hell, Aâ for Thy glory, And no for ony gude or ill Theyâve done afore Thee! I bless and praise Thy matchless might, When thousands Thou hast left in night, That I am here afore Thy sight, For gifts anâ grace A burning and a shining light To aâ this place. What was I, or my generation, That I should get sic exaltation, I wha deserve most just damnation For broken laws, Five thousand years ere my creation, Throâ Adamâs cause? When frae my mitherâs womb I fell, Thou might hae plunged me in hell, To gnash my gums, to weep and wail, In burnin lakes, Where damned devils roar and yell, Chainâd to their stakes. Yet I am here a chosen sample, To show thy grace is great and ample; Iâm here a pillar oâ Thy temple, Strong as a rock, A guide, a buckler, and example, To aâ Thy flock. O Lord, Thou kens what zeal I bear, When drinkers drink, anâ swearers swear, Anâ singin there, anâ dancin here, Wiâ great and smaâ; For I am keepit by Thy fear Free frae them aâ. But yet, O Lord! confess I must, At times Iâm fashâd wiâ fleshly lust: Anâ sometimes, too, in wardly trust, Vile self gets in: But Thou remembers we are dust, Defilâd wiâ sin. O Lord! yestreen, Thou kens, wiâ Megâ Thy pardon I sincerely beg, O! mayât neâer be a livin plague To my dishonour, Anâ Iâll neâer lift a lawless leg Again upon her. Besides, I farther maun allow, Wiâ Leezieâs lass, three times I trowâ But Lord, that Friday I was fou, When I cam near her; Or else, Thou kens, Thy servant true Wad never steer her. Maybe Thou lets this fleshly thorn Buffet Thy servant eâen and morn, Lest he owre proud and high shouâd turn, That heâs sae gifted: If sae, Thy hanâ maun eâen be borne, Until Thou lift it. Lord, bless Thy chosen in this place, For here Thou hast a chosen race: But God confound their stubborn face, Anâ blast their name, Wha bring Thy elders to disgrace Anâ public shame. Lord, mind Gawân Hamiltonâs deserts; He drinks, anâ swears, anâ plays at cartes, Yet has sae mony takin arts, Wiâ great and smaâ, Frae Godâs ain priest the peopleâs hearts He steals awa. Anâ when we chastenâd him therefor, Thou kens how he bred sic a splore, Anâ set the warld in a roar Oâ laughing at us;â Curse Thou his basket and his store, Kail anâ potatoes. Lord, hear my earnest cry and prayâr, Against that Presbytâry oâ Ayr; Thy strong right hand, Lord, make it bare Upoâ their heads; Lord visit them, anâ dinna spare, For their misdeeds. O Lord, my God! that glib-tonguâd Aiken, My vera heart and flesh are quakin, To think how we stood sweatinâ, shakin, Anâ p-âd wiâ dread, While he, wiâ hingin lip anâ snakin, Held up his head. Lord, in Thy day oâ vengeance try him, Lord, visit them wha did employ him, And pass not in Thy mercy by âem, Nor hear their prayâr, But for Thy peopleâs sake, destroy âem, Anâ dinna spare. But, Lord, remember me anâ mine Wiâ mercies tempâral anâ divine, That I for grace anâ gear may shine, Excellâd by nane, And aâ the glory shall be thine, Amen, Amen!\n\nEpitaph On Holy Willie\n\nHere Holy Willieâs sair worn clay Taks up its last abode; His saul has taâen some other way, I fear, the left-hand road. Stop! there he is, as sureâs a gun, Poor, silly body, see him; Nae wonder heâs as blackâs the grun, Observe whaâs standing wiâ him. Your brunstane devilship, I see, Has got him there before ye; But haud your nine-tail cat a wee, Till ance youâve heard my story. Your pity I will not implore, For pity ye have nane; Justice, alas! has giâen him oâer, And mercyâs day is gane. But hear me, Sir, deil as ye are, Look something to your credit; A coof like him wad stain your name, If it were kent ye did it.\n\nDeath and Doctor Hornbook\n\nA True Story\n\nSome books are lies frae end to end, And some great lies were never pennâd: Evân ministers they hae been kennâd, In holy rapture, A rousing whid at times to vend, And nailât wiâ Scripture. But this that I am gaun to tell, Which lately on a night befell, Is just as trueâs the Deilâs in hell Or Dublin city: That eâer he nearer comes ourselâ âS a muckle pity. The clachan yill had made me canty, I was na fou, but just had plenty; I stacherâd whiles, but yet too tent aye To free the ditches; Anâ hillocks, stanes, anâ bushes, kennâd eye Frae ghaists anâ witches. The rising moon began to glowre The distant Cumnock hills out-owre: To count her horns, wiâ a my powâr, I set myselâ; But whether she had three or four, I couâd na tell. I was come round about the hill, Anâ todlin down on Willieâs mill, Setting my staff wiâ aâ my skill, To keep me sicker; Thoâ leeward whiles, against my will, I took a bicker. I there wiâ Something did forgather, That pat me in an eerie swither; Anâ awfuâ scythe, out-owre ae shouther, Clear-dangling, hang; A three-taeâd leister on the ither Lay, large anâ lang. Its stature seemâd lang Scotch ells twa, The queerest shape that eâer I saw, For fient a wame it had ava; And then its shanks, They were as thin, as sharp anâ smaâ As cheeks oâ branks. âGuid-een,â quoâ I; âFriend! hae ye been mawin, When ither folk are busy sawin!â1 I seemâd to make a kind oâ stanâ But naething spak; At length, says I, âFriend! whare ye gaun? Will ye go back?â It spak right howe,ââMy name is Death, But be na fleyâd.ââQuoth I, âGuid faith, Yeâre maybe come to stap my breath; But tent me, billie; I red ye weel, tak care oâ skaith See, thereâs a gully!â âGudeman,â quoâ he, âput up your whittle, Iâm no designed to try its mettle; But if I did, I wad be kittle To be mislearâd; I wad na mind it, no that spittle Out-owre my beard.â âWeel, weel!â says I, âa bargain beât; Come, gieâs your hand, anâ sae weâre greeât; Weâll ease our shanks an tak a seatâ Come, gieâs your news; This while ye hae been mony a gate, At mony a house.â2 [Footnote 1: This recontre happened in seed-time, 1785.âR.B.] [Footnote 2: An epidemical fever was then raging in that country.âR.B.] âAy, ay!â quoâ he, anâ shook his head, âItâs eâen a lang, lang time indeed Sinâ I began to nick the thread, Anâ choke the breath: Folk maun do something for their bread, Anâ sae maun Death. âSax thousand years are near-hand fled Sinâ I was to the butching bred, Anâ mony a scheme in vainâs been laid, To stap or scar me; Till ane Hornbookâs3 taâen up the trade, And faith! heâll waur me. âYe ken Hornbook iâ the clachan, Deil mak his kingâs-hood in spleuchan! Heâs grown sae weel acquaint wiâ Buchan4 And ither chaps, The weans haud out their fingers laughin, Anâ pouk my hips. âSee, hereâs a scythe, anâ thereâs dart, They hae piercâd mony a gallant heart; But Doctor Hornbook, wiâ his art Anâ cursed skill, Has made them baith no worth a f-t, Damnâd haet theyâll kill! ââTwas but yestreen, nae farther gane, I threw a noble throw at ane; Wiâ less, Iâm sure, Iâve hundreds slain; But deil-ma-care, It just playâd dirl on the bane, But did nae mair. âHornbook was by, wiâ ready art, Anâ had sae fortifyâd the part, [Footnote 3: This gentleman, Dr. Hornbook, is professionally a brother of the sovereign Order of the Ferula; but, by intuition and inspiration, is at once an apothecary, surgeon, and physician.âR.B.] [Footnote 4: Burchanâs Domestic Medicine.âR.B.] That when I looked to my dart, It was sae blunt, Fient haet oât wad hae piercâd the heart Of a kail-runt. âI drew my scythe in sic a fury, I near-hand cowpit wiâ my hurry, But yet the bauld Apothecary Withstood the shock; I might as weel hae tried a quarry Oâ hard whin rock. âEvân them he canna get attended, Althoâ their face he neâer had kend it, Justâin a kail-blade, anâ sent it, As soonâs he smells ât, Baith their disease, and what will mend it, At once he tells ât. âAnd then, aâ doctorâs saws anâ whittles, Of aâ dimensions, shapes, anâ mettles, Aâ kind oâ boxes, mugs, anâ bottles, Heâs sure to hae; Their Latin names as fast he rattles as A B C. âCalces oâ fossils, earths, and trees; True sal-marinum oâ the seas; The farina of beans anâ pease, He hasât in plenty; Aqua-fontis, what you please, He can content ye. âForbye some new, uncommon weapons, Urinus spiritus of capons; Or mite-horn shavings, filings, scrapings, Distillâd per se; Sal-alkali oâ midge-tail clippings, And mony mae.â âWaes me for Johnie Gedâs5 Hole now,â Quoth I, âif that thae news be true! His braw calf-ward whare gowans grew, Sae white and bonie, Nae doubt theyâll rive it wiâ the plew; Theyâll ruin Johnie!â The creature grainâd an eldritch laugh, And says âYe needna yoke the pleugh, Kirkyards will soon be tillâd eneugh, Tak ye nae fear: Theyâll be trenchâd wiâ mony a sheugh, In twa-three year. âWhare I killâd ane, a fair strae-death, By loss oâ blood or want of breath This night Iâm free to tak my aith, That Hornbookâs skill Has clad a score iâ their last claith, By drap anâ pill. âAn honest wabster to his trade, Whase wifeâs twa nieves were scarce weel-bred Gat tippence-worth to mend her head, When it was sair; The wife slade cannie to her bed, But neâer spak mair. âA country laird had taâen the batts, Or some curmurring in his guts, His only son for Hornbook sets, Anâ pays him well: The lad, for twa guid gimmer-pets, Was laird himselâ. âA bonie lassâye kend her nameâ Some ill-brewn drink had hovâd her wame; She trusts herselâ, to hide the shame, In Hornbookâs care; Horn sent her aff to her lang hame, To hide it there. [Footnote 5: The grave-digger.âR.B.] âThatâs just a swatch oâ Hornbookâs way; Thus goes he on from day to day, Thus does he poison, kill, anâ slay, Anâs weel paid forât; Yet stops me oâ my lawfuâ prey, Wiâ his damnâd dirt: âBut, hark!

On Fastenâeâen we had a rockin, To caâ the crack and weave our stockin; And there was muckle fun and jokin, Ye need na doubt; At length we had a hearty yokin At sang about. There was ae sang, amang the rest, Aboon them aâ it pleasâd me best, That some kind husband had addrest To some sweet wife; It thirlâd the heart-strings throâ the breast, Aâ to the life.
