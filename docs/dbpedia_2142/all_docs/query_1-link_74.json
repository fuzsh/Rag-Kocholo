        "text": "Two big surprises have emerged from the film“42,” which deals with Jackie Robinson’s breaking major league baseball’s color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers. One, it appears that many people who never set foot in Ebbets Field in the 1940s and ’50s have been flocking to see it. And two, the chief tormentor of Robinson, Philadelphia Phillies Manager Ben Chapman, is portrayed exactly as he was in life: a meanspirited, unreconstructed bigot.\n\nI could not help being caught up in the movie’s attempt to tell it like it was, which has not always been the case with sports films. Then I recalled a phone conversation I had with Chapman about a year before he died in 1993. I was trying to set things straight in my mind about him and others who attempted to delay racial progress.\n\nWhen Robinson was a rookie, Chapman was not alone in misbehaving. Some of Robinson’s teammates were aghast at sharing the same playground with him, and they tried to squash his spirit. But Chapman played the major role in this grim subtext to the so-called great experiment of Branch Rickey, the Dodgers’ president and general manager.\n\nWell before he established himself as Robinson’s nemesis, Chapman had won his credentials as one of baseball’s biggest racists. He played for Manager Joe McCarthy’s Yankees from 1930 to 1936, first as a third baseman and then as an outfielder. Chapman was a .300 hitter and a daring base runner. But he was a man with poisonous social attitudes. On game days, he frequently yelled anti-Semitic epithets toward Jewish fans sitting near him in Yankee Stadium’s left field.\n\nIn 1933, when the Yankees were playing in Washington, Chapman was the chief actor in one of baseball’s most turbulent on-field brawls involving the Senators’ Buddy Myer, one of the few Jewish major league players. It all started when Chapman charged into second base, planting his spikes in Myer’s thigh. As they traded blows, their teammates and several hundred fans joined in.\n\nDespite Chapman’s skills, the Yankees’ front office feared that he was alienating Jewish fans. Some of them sent in petitions demanding that Chapman be traded, and the Yankees did so. He played for six other teams in his career.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
