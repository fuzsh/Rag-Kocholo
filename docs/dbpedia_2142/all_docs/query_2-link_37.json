        "text": "For most of the announced 2020 Presidential candidates, the starting block doubled as a stumbling block.\n\nO’Rourke has already fumbled over some ham-handed comments about his relationship with his wife, Warren is sparring with the likeability factor, and Booker is struggling to prove he’s moved on from the cataclysmic vote that forever marked him as big pharma’s stooge.\n\nTo be fair, some of these stories are simply the overplayed gossip of a lazy national media grasping for any excuse to dramatize the 2020 campaigns far before they are relevant. And I’ll add that the “likeability” question reeks of sexism. But fair or not, the media has found cause to cast grey clouds over all the 2020 Democrats so far — with the exception of Pete Buttigieg.\n\nFor the Indiana mayor with a funny surname, the political world is inside out. The more voters learn about his history, his motives, and his character, the more they fall in love with him."
