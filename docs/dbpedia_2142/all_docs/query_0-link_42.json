They are listed here in order of their appearances:\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nFriending with the Enemy[]\n\nDr. Hunter Brody[]\n\nDr. Hunter Brody was the star of For Reals, a television show in which the intrepid adventurer would travel the world seeking to find proof that legendary creatures truly existed. He stumbled into Camp Kikiwaka one night, claiming to have had a close brush with the legendary Kikiwaka and recruits Ravi, Zuri, and Tiffany to help him find it. Unfortunately, Ravi and the girls discover that Brody hired a man to wear a Kikiwaka suit, revealing that he just wants to be famous and that he pretends that legends are real. This infuriates Zuri, who blackmails Dr. Brody into dressing as the Kikiwaka to scare kids who are paying her to see the Kikiwaka threatening that she'll reveal his fraudulence to his boss.\n\nDr. Hunter Brody was played by Myko Olivier.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nBrody claims to be a \"Doctor of Danger,\" of which Ravi was extremely skeptical.\n\nHe claims to have a Masters Degree in acting.\n\nPrior to arriving at Camp Kikiwaka, Brody and Harold were faking a Chupacabra sighting in Mexico with a Great Dane in a costume,\n\nUpon leaving Kikiwaka, he plans to visit Area 51.\n\nThe character also appears in the previously seen footage intro which opens the next episode, Waka, Waka, Waka!\n\nMyko Olivier also appeared as \"Reese\" in the two-part K.C.

After Jorge accidentally breaks a Kikiwaka statue, which the shop clerk claimed was one of a kind and worth $200, Ted tried to make the Jorge, Zuri, Emma, and Xander, scrape the mold off spoiled produce and change expiration dates on food labels to work off the debt. However, Jorge and Zuri discovered that there was actually a large inventory of such statues and that they really only cost $10. Faced with the truth, Ted had to let the campers go.\n\nTed was played by Andrew Caldwell.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nTed displayed a sign on the counter stating to ring the bell for service, for a broken bell.\n\nAndrew Caldwell had recurring roles in Hannah Montana (as \"Thor\"), and Good Luck Charlie (as \"Billy 'Gravy' Graves\"), Henry Danger/Danger Force (as \"Mitch Bilsky\").

She was seen with the other CITs during the meteor shower, the CIT reviews, and when Gladys got doused with a pail of water.\n\nThe Ginger Camp Counselor-in-Training was played by Amanda LaCount.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe name for the character is not official, and comes from the Internet Movie Data Base site.\n\nAmanda LaCount was not credited for the role.\n\nMarsh[]\n\nMarsh arrived on the day after a meteor shower and was acting strange, making Jorge and Tiffany suspect that he might be an alien. Zuri developed a crush on him and he seemed to like her back, as he gave her his number. At the end of his time at Kikiwaka, he left to go to a Cooking Camp instead, after Jorge and Tiffany snared Marsh and Zuri in a net. However, later Gladys would claim to have never heard of a new camper named \"Marsh,\" leaving Jorge and Tiffany uncertain about the truth of who (or what) Marsh really was.\n\nMarsh was played by Amarr M.

While looking for bevels for his business at Moose Mart, he is met by a pair of young sisters, Emma and Zuri Ross, who wish him to meet their friend, Lou. Noah learns that both hr and Lou make furniture, and he agrees to go to Camp Kikiwaka to get to know the awkward girl better. He arrives at the camp and goes to the Woodchuck Cabin where he was told Lou lives. Noah notices the wooden Adirondack chairs on the porch and cannot help himself from inspecting them, easily discerning that they were crafted with skills superior to his own. The girls return to find him there; Noah states that whoever made the items truly understood the language of wood, and Lou admits she made the chairs. Noah tries to inject a little humor about the subject of the types of wood, but it goes over her head, still Noah asks Lou to go out with him. The next night, bringing Lou a modest bouquet of flowers, Noah goes to pick her up at Woodchuck Cabin, but barely survives the harsh vetting by Zuri and calls out Lou's name for help, and the pair quickly depart for their date. Arriving in Moose Rump, Noah suggests that instead of having dinner at the Crab Shack, it might be more romantic if they indulged in their mutual passion for woodworking and make some chairs. Noah explains that his ailing grandfather's only pleasure in life is reclining in his Adirondack chair, and that he could always use new ones... Lou is moved by the notion, and agrees, and the pair begin their construction project near Moose Mart. After a time, Noah becomes thirsty and goes to get a milkshake, drinking the majority of it before leaving the store. Outside, he sees the Ross sisters with Lou and they ask if he forgot Lou's milkshake. But Noah quickly denies that, handing Lou the remaining portion and explaining that they are sharing. On their second date Noah has Lou demonstrate her table making skills and marvels over how many magazines the coffee table she constructs can support. For their third date, Noah and Lou go to the lumber yard, as Noah's truck has broken down and they need to carry the wood into his shop. The next day, as Noah, inspects the chairs before they get painted, the Ross girls confront him, with Zuri threatening to stuff a live squirrel down his pants for exploiting Lou for free labor during their dates. Noah denies the allegation, declaring he truly likes Lou. The girls demand to know then why he has Lou making furniture during their dates, and Noah repeats the story of his ailing grandfather and his fondness for that particular type of chair. The contrite girls apologize and move away. Noah then gets a call from the buyer he had lined up for the chairs, agreeing to his price of $5,000 for the entire set. He tells the client that he is fortunate to be getting Noah Drake Originals, and notes to himself that he is fortunate for getting money towards a new truck. When Lou asks how they should decorate the chair, Noah leaves it completely in her hands, as he has scheduled a manicure appointment. When Noah returns from the salon, he discovers that Lou and the Ross girls have painted the chairs in bright colors and cherubs and demands to know what they have done. Lou replies they have finished the chairs the way his grandfather wanted. Noah snaps that his grandfather could not have wanted anything, as he has been dead for two years. Lou instantly cradles his head to comfort him, but the Ross girls, while expressing sympathy for his loss have proven Noah is a liar. Realization dawning on Lou, she jerks his head back and demands to know if it is true, he only dated her to raise money for a new truck. Noah tries to mitigate his transgression by insisting it was not a new truck, but rather gently used. Lou begins wielding a nail gun and advises Noah to start running or he won't be able to sit in his gently used truck. Covering his rear end with his hands, Noah swiftly retreats.\n\nNoah Drake was played by Chandler Massey.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nHe claims to have a friend named Steve with a nasty overbite.\n\nHe states his mother is in prison.\n\nHe shares the same first name as the Season 4 main character Noah Lambert.\n\nLove is for the Birds[]\n\nSasha[]\n\nSasha was considered to be the coolest camper at Camp Kikiwaka.

However, Ravi quickly discovers Sasha's preference for extremely dangerous and life-threatening activities. Despite this, Ravi takes Jorge's advice to go along with her and takes part in her adventures, enduring many injuries while doing so. When Sasha suggests they go skydiving, Ravi listens to Jorge rather than Emma, who knows that this is a major mistake. When Ravi and Sasha jump, he realizes that he's had enough and insults her in midair, by calling her a \"Whackadoo.\" Sasha does not take the breakup well, deploying her parachute without telling Ravi how to use his, leaving her now ex-boyfriend to plummet into the forest below.
