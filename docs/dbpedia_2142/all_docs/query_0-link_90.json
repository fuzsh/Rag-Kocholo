Was it earlier or later than his son's marriage certificate?\n\nIt may well be that he was a labourer as a lad and then trained as an electrician.\n\nIf it was the other way round, he may have been a labourer so as to undertake some work whilst looking for a job as an electrician.\n\nhi\n\nit would appear (if i have the correct person????) that he was 39 when he's son got married!!!\n\nalso another quick question he's farther nor he's new wife's farther where not witnesses to there marriage would that mean that they never approved of there marriage??? she was 9 mths preg with my grandad!!!\n\ni don't think they were runaways and i am pretty sure they were married in there home parishes, one of the witnesses was the brides brother, not sure on the other witness.\n\nuseually it would say if the farther was dead, it says that on my grandad farther's marriage cert???\n\ni will go with wiliam's dad being a labrourer as a lad and then training as an electricion. (that's if it's the correct person on the 1901 census) i am waiting on a birth cert to see if the mother's name's are the same?\n\nkeep finger's crossed!!!\n\nI am not sure you can rely on Marriage certificate information. Both my mother and paternal Grandfather have their fathers as deceased and both were very much alive. My mother also had her father down as an Army Officer when in fact he was a Private for the duration of WWl and then a Carter. If I hadn't known him I would have believed the certificate. People are not always as honest as we would like them to be.\n\nXantippe"
