        "text": "A headline and an article in the Connecticut section on Sunday about Toquam Magnet, a K-5 school in Stamford, referred incorrectly to its status. A committee of the Stamford School District board is to vote on Wednesday night on whether to close the school, and the full board will take up the matter later; the board has not already closed the school. (Go to Article)\n\nFor the Record\n\nBecause of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the coming presidential election in Taiwan misattributed a quotation about a referendum that will ask Taiwanese to choose the name under which the country will apply for membership in the United Nations. It was Hsiao Bi-khim, a former lawmaker and spokeswoman for Frank Hsieh, one of the candidates, who said, “We see China as a giant with its hands around our neck, trying to suffocate us, trying to shut off our space on the international stage.” It was not Mr. Hsieh himself who made the comment. (Go to Article)\n\n\n\nAn article on Saturday about the impasse over the disputed Democratic primaries in Michigan and Florida rendered incorrectly a word in a quotation from Stacie Paxton, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, whose chairman is Howard Dean. Ms. Paxton said, “It’s never productive to negotiate through the press, but make no mistake, Howard Dean will continue to lead the effort to find a workable solution that’s fair and consistent with the rules.” She did not say, “It’s never productive to negotiate through the process.” (Go to Article)\n\n\n\nAn article in some editions on Sunday about the deadly collapse of a construction crane on the East Side of Manhattan included an erroneous spelling from city officials in some copies for the surname of one victim. He was Wayne Bleidner, not Binder. (Go to Article)\n\n\n\nThe Big City column on Friday, about the clash between fantasy and reality in the prostitution scandal that ensnared Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York, referred incorrectly in some editions to Kristen, the prostitute he is said to have met in a Washington hotel last month. She was not in fact a client of Emperor’s Club V.I.P. (It was Mr. Spitzer who was a client, according to a federal affidavit.) (Go to Article)\n\n\n\nA picture caption in some editions on Saturday with a sports article about Georgetown’s 72-55 victory over West Virginia in the Big East men’s basketball tournament misidentified a Hoyas player who was shown defending Joe Alexander of the Mountaineers. It was DaJuan Summers, not his teammate Chris Wright. (Go to Article)\n\n\n\nBecause of an editing error, a sports article on Saturday about Michael Levy, the lawyer representing a potential witness in the spying scandal involving the New England Patriots, misstated the title for Senator Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican who has been critical of the N.F.L. in the matter. He is the Senate Judiciary Committee’s ranking member  not its chairman, a position held by Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. (Go to Article)\n\n\n\nAn article on Sunday about the appointment of a new leader of the Smithsonian Institution, G. Wayne Clough, misstated the timing of the retirement of the former director of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian in recounting issues of oversight and accountability with which the institution has been wrestling. While the former director, W. Richard West Jr., remained on the Smithsonian’s payroll until the end of last year, his retirement in December preceded a Washington Post report about his spending on travel; he did not retire after the report was published. (Go to Article)\n\n\n\nAn obituary by The Associated Press on March 1 about Ben Chapman, an actor who had the title role in the 1954 film “Creature From the Black Lagoon,” misstated the name of the California town where a surviving stepdaughter, Elyse Maree Raljevich, lives. It is Coto de Caza, not Coto De Gaza. (Go to Article)"
