        "text": "Hoo-boy... it was already a dreary day and now this....\n\nHollywood actor Ben Chapman --one of the last men to play a classic Universal monster (and a super-nice guy to boot) passed away in Hawaii early this morning.\n\nFrom the Creature from the Black Lagoon Yahoo Group:\n\nBen Chapman passed away this morning at 12:15 AM Hawaii time. He was\n\nadmitted to the hospital two days ago and died peacefully in his\n\nhospital bed. He had a living will and they turned off his life\n\nsupport yesterday about noon Hawaii time. They will be having a\n\nmemorial service at a Catholic Church located near the beach and he\n\nwill be cremated. He turned 79 last October.\n\nMy sincere hope is that he died peacefully and with no pain or suffering.\n\nMy best thoughts are for the Gill-man who carried a fallen female and entered into movie monster stardom!\n\nOur Gill Man (on land) will be forever remembered, not just as the body of the imposing Creature, but for his priceless recollections, his detailed memories and willingness to share this will Monster Kids the world over.\n\nA gentle giant and a heck of a nice guy.\n\nPersonally I have to include these shots I took as well: The whole Creature gang photo-op for the fans at CreatureFest 2003 in Wakulla Springs. (left to right) Ben Chapman, Julia Adams, Ginger Stanley and Ricou Browning --together again at this event for the first time in 50 years.\n\nAnd here's Ben with and signing my own Creature Mask for posterity.\n\nThanks again Ben... and rest in peace.\n\nLabels: Ben Chapman, Creature From the Black Lagoon, Creaturefest 2003, Universal Studios, Wakulla Springs"
