One, that may explain why her grave is encased in cement, was that she was an Indian Princess and was buried with her valuables. Robbers would dig up her grave to recover the items.\n\nFollowing is a newspaper article that appeared in a local paper:\n\nApril 20, 1905\n\nMrs. J. L. Moore Dead.\n\nAgain the grim monster has visited our community, this time taking away a shining light. Minnie C. Chapman was born at Cantonment, Blame County, Oklahoma, July 14, 1878 and died at her home three miles east of Seiling, Oklahoma April 16, 1905, age 27 years, 10 months and 2 days. She was the eldest daughter of Amos Chapman, for many years a faithful government aid and the writer well remembers the high praise once bestowed upon him by a government officer of high rank. In her veins were united the blood of the child of the forest and that of the white, her grandfather being Chief Stone, of the Cheyennes. She was dearly loved by the entire Cheyenne tribe and was one of their most important legal advisers. The earlier part of her life was spent in school at Kiowa, Kansas and later at the Haskell Institute, at Lawrence, Kansas. She was married to J. L. Moore, February 25, 1896.\n\nIt was only necessary to visit her lovely home built up and beautified by her own and her devoted husbands hands, to know of her excellent qualities, industrious, frugal, refined, her home was always kept in perfect order. Friends, she had many, enemies, none. She never spoke only with a pleasant smile and a ray of sunshine gleamed whenever she was present. When it was found that that dreaded disease, consumption, was lurking in her system, her fond husband prepared a temporary home for her in the rare, pure air of New Mexico, where it was thought her health might be restored. But when all hope was lost a hasty message was sent to her husband to come and bring her home to die.\n\nTo show her fondness for the partner of her bosom, it is only necessary to state that when death was drawing near, she requested him to give her a needle and thread that she might repair a garment for his comfort and with the work in hand her spirit took its flight. May He who rules all things reconcile father, mother, sister, brothers and above all, husband, to the inevitable fate and lead the family and friends to say: O grave, where is thy victory, O, death, where is thy sting.\n\nDeceased was united with the Presbyterian church at Lawrence, Kansas in 1889, and has ever been a faithful christian. She leaves a father, mother, one sister and six brothers to mourn her demise.\n\nThe funeral services were conducted by Rev. J. T. Beach at the house, after which the remains were laid to rest in the family grave yard at the Chapman home.\n\nA FRIEND\n\nOther items in the same paper:\n\nJ. A. Mulkey and Joe Ventioner of Taloga attended the funeral of Mrs. J. L. Moore, Tuesday evening.\n\nMr. and Mrs. J. Kimball were over from Taloga Tuesday and attended the funeral of Mrs. Moore and were the guests of F. C. Caley and wife while here.\n\nSurnameGivenMaidenBirthDeathComments CHAPMAN Alonzo22 Jan ????00 000 1919b/o William CHAPMAN Ben00 000 188000 000 1907 CHAPMAN Eddie00 000 189000 000 1904 CHAPMAN George00 000 188700 000 1892 CHAPMAN Infantno dateno date CHAPMAN Infantno dateno date CHAPMAN Steve00 000 189200 000 1918 CHAPMAN William28 Oct 191420 Nov 1919 MOORE Minnie C.
