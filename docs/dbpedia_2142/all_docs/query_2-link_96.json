This section is intended to clarify those relationships, albeit very briefly, and also identify those with the same surname that are not related. Inevitably, particularly for those active in the Society in its earliest decades, not all relationships are know, though some can be guessed at. The notes should make it clear what we know and what we infer.\n\nAbbott\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, Jane and Lucy are not related.\n\nAlberts\n\nAffrika, Tallulah and Xayla-rae are sisters.\n\nAngus\n\nIan is married to Ruth.\n\nArmstrong\n\nRachel and Victoria are possible related, maybe sisters, but we simply don't know for sure.\n\nAsh\n\nDave is married to Lucy.\n\nHarrison and Madelaine are their children.\n\nSee also under Charman.\n\nAyling\n\nJack, Megan-Rose and Violet-May are siblings.\n\nBarker\n\nRosemary is the mother of Sue.\n\nToby is not related to to either of them.\n\nBarnes\n\nPing is the mother of Duncan, Jimmy and Shelley.\n\nShelley is the mother of Faith Phillipson.\n\nBedggood\n\nChloe and Madelaine are sisters.\n\nBelfrage\n\nSee under Bordoli.\n\nBernal\n\nEmmy and Phoebe are sisters.\n\nBordoli\n\nClive is married to Nic Belfrage.\n\nOscar is their son.\n\nBowman\n\nSee under Runnalls.\n\nBroad\n\nFran is the mother of Patrick.\n\nBrown\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, Emma, Simon and Terry are not related.\n\nBrowning\n\nAndrew is the son of Pat.\n\nBruce\n\nCliff is the father of Ben and Rebecca.\n\nMatthew: We feel he ought to be part of the family (as the only production he was in was directed by Cliff) but we simply don't know.\n\nBruff\n\nCecil is not related to Madelaine.\n\nBuckland\n\nEmma and Lucy are sisters.\n\nBurley\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, Jane and Mabel are not related.\n\nButler\n\nMary is married to Tony.\n\nJenny is not related to to either of them.\n\nCameron\n\nJen and Julia did Front of House together for Cinderella.
