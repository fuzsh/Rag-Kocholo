The forename Abel was biblical in origin (so there was the biblical Jewish connection).\n\nAs a surname, it is simply English. Other common examples of this sort of thing are ADAMS (Adam) and ELLIS (Elias).\n\nI have ABELL in my ancestry and my grandfather drummed into me (gently of course) the distinction between the two names. I don't know why it changed but it did so in England as it was ABELL before it came to Australia. Both families were represented in the Newcastle area of NSW."
