        "text": "Chamberlain History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nFrance\n\nIreland\n\nScotland\n\nChamberlain is one of the many new names that came to England following the Norman Conquest of 1066. The name Chamberlain is for a person who worked as a chamberlain. A chamberlain was one who was in charge of the private chambers of a noble, and later was a high ranking title having derived from the Anglo-Norman French word, chamberlanc. 1\n\n\"Chamberlain occurs most commonly in Leicestershire and Rutlandshire.\" 2 \"There are several distinct families bearing the surname. Aiulfus Camerarius (the latinized form) was a tenant in chief in co. Dorset, and probably the Conqueror's own chamberlain. One of his possessions in that county is still called Hampreston-Chamberlaine. 3\n\nThe Chamberlaynes of Maugersbury claim from John, count of Tancarville, whose descendants were hereditary chamberlains to kings Henry I., Stephen, and Henry II. The office of the camerarius was to take charge of the king's camera or treasury, and answered to the treasurer of the household at present. Besides Aiulfus above mentioned, at least five other tenants in capite so designated occur in Domesday. \" 4\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Chamberlain family\n\nThe surname Chamberlain was first found in Oxfordshire where they claim descent from John, Count de Tankerville, of Tankerville Castle in Normandy who accompanied Duke William on his Conquest of England only to return after the battle of Hastings to his hereditary estates. He left a son in England who became chamberlain to Henry I., and whose son, Richard assumed the surname of Chamberlain from his office. 5\n\nIn Scotland, \"the office of royal chamberlain was one of great responsibility in virtue of the fact that until the reign of James I he managed the king's revenue and was head of the Exchequer. The great nobles, also, had each a chamberlain who looked after his lord's business affairs. John Camerarius witnessed a confirmation charter by William the Lion, c. 1175. Walter Camerarius witnessed a charter by EsChina, wife of Walter Fitz Alan, before 1177\" 1\n\nThe principal line of the descendants were the Chamberlaynes of Sherborne in Oxfordshire \"from whom derived the celebrated Sir Thomas Chamberlayne, of Prince Thorpe and Presbury, a distinguished diplomatist in the reigns of Henry VIII., Mary, and Elizabeth. \" 5\n\nThe hamlet of Stoney Thorpe in Warwickshire was home to a branch of the family. \"The family of Chamberlayne, formerly of Princethorpe, in the county, has been seated here for many centuries; Henry Thomas Chamberlayne, Esq., is the present owner.\" 6\n\nGeoffrey le Chaumberleng was listed in the Curia Regis Roll for Warwickshire in 1194; Robert canberlenc in the Feet of Fines for 1195; Thomas Chamberleng' seruiens Regis was listed in the Pipe Rolls for Cambridgeshire in 1196; Martin le Chamberleyn in the Feet of Fines for Cambridgeshire in 1232; and Thomas le Chaumberlyn was found in the Assize Rolls for Staffordshire in 1293. 7\n\nThe Hundredorum Rolls of 1273 proved the wide usage of the surname with various spellings throughout ancient Britain: Walter le Chamberlayn, Lincolnshire; Martin le Chaumberleyn, Cambridgeshire; Ivo le Chaumberleyn, Warwickshire; and Henry le Chamberlein, Buckinghamshire. 8\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Chamberlain family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Chamberlain research. Another 181 words (13 lines of text) covering the years 1398, 1405, 1540, 1560, 1572, 1576, 1596, 1616, 1619, 1625, 1626, 1631, 1632, 1635, 1643, 1667, 1682, 1689, 1690, 1691, 1703, 1715, 1720 and 1813 are included under the topic Early Chamberlain History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nChamberlain Spelling Variations\n\nMultitudes of spelling variations are a hallmark of Anglo Norman names. Most of these names evolved in the 11th and 12th century, in the time after the Normans introduced their own Norman French language into a country where Old and Middle English had no spelling rules and the languages of the court were French and Latin. To make matters worse, medieval scribes spelled words according to sound, so names frequently appeared differently in the various documents in which they were recorded. The name was spelled Chamberlain, Chamberlayne, Chamberlaine, Chamblayn, Chamberlin, Camberlain, Camberlan, Camblayn and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Chamberlain family\n\nOutstanding amongst the family at this time was\n\nNicholas Chamberlaine (1632-1715), was an English priest in the Church of England who was known for his charitable donations; Hugh Chamberlen the elder (c.1632-1720), was an English royal physician, o...\n\nChamberlain World Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Chamberlain is the 1,098th most popular surname with an estimated 27,357 people with that name. 9 However, in Australia, the name Chamberlain is ranked the 741st most popular surname with an estimated 5,243 people with that name. 10 And in New Zealand, the name Chamberlain is the 465th popular surname with an estimated 1,485 people with that name. 11 The United Kingdom ranks Chamberlain as 512nd with 12,733 people. 12\n\nMigration of the Chamberlain family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Chamberlain family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt.\n\nAnother 43 words (3 lines of text) about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nChamberlain migration to the United States +\n\nBecause of this political and religious unrest within English society, many people decided to immigrate to the colonies. Families left for Ireland, North America, and Australia in enormous numbers, traveling at high cost in extremely inhospitable conditions. The New World in particular was a desirable destination, but the long voyage caused many to arrive sick and starving. Those who made it, though, were welcomed by opportunities far greater than they had known at home in England. Many of these families went on to make important contributions to the emerging nations of Canada and the United States. Analysis of immigration records indicates that some of the first North American immigrants bore the name Chamberlain or a variant listed above:\n\nChamberlain Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nMr. Franics Chamberlain, aged 45, who arrived in Virginia in 1621 aboard the ship \"Marmaduke\" 13\n\nLeon Chamberlain, who landed in Virginia in 1637 14\n\nHenry Chamberlain, who landed in Hingham, Massachusetts in 1638 14\n\nMrs. Chamberlain who settled in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1638\n\nHenry Chamberlain, who settled in Hingham, in 1638\n\n...

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Prodesse quam conspici\n\nMotto Translation: To do good rather than be conspicuous.\n\nSuggested Readings for the name Chamberlain +\n\nDescendants of William Chambers by John Phillips.\n\nTales from the Past: Our Family (the Chambers Family) in America by Frank Griffin.\n\nCitations +\n\nBlack, George F., The Surnames of Scotland Their Origin, Meaning and History.
