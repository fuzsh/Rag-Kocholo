        "text": "Date of birth\n\n8 July 1940\n\nPolitical profile\n\nBen Chapman came to public prominence when he won the Wirral South by-election in February 1997, less than two years after he joined the Labour Party.\n\nThe 17% swing to Labour in a formerly true blue seat sealed John Major's fate at the coming general election.\n\nMr Chapman managed to hold his seat at both subsequent elections, but has not made a huge impact in the Commons.\n\nHe has spent most of the time as PPS to Richard Caborn in his various ministerial guises.\n\nMr Chapman was a career civil servant, mostly working for the Department of Trade and Industry and its forebears, until leaving to set up his own company supporting small businesses.\n\nHis enthusiasm for commerce and knowledge of overseas trade, especially with China, enabled New Labour to use him as an emblem of their newly-acquired business friendly face.\n\nContact\n\nchapmanb@parliament.uk\n\nConstituency office 0151 643 8797"
