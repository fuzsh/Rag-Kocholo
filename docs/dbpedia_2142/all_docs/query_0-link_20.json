        "text": "Chapman (surname)\n\nThis article is about the surname Chapman. For other uses, see Chapman.\n\nChapman Family name Meaning Business man or trader\n\nChapman is a surname and perhaps an occupational surname. There is not a single agreed origin of the surname Chapman. Theories include it being a name for a business man or trader which was called in Old High German either choufman or koufman, which became the Old English surname céapmann.[1] Other theories include a Saxon origin, as the Saxon words ceapan or cypan mean to buy or sell, however there is a similarity in this origin to the Old High German version, it once again would means a trader or business man.[2] In addition, during the Middle Ages Chapmen or a Chapman sold chapbooks which were pamphlets intended for a wide audience.[3]\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary gives four meanings for Chapman. They are a man whose business was buying and selling; an itinerant dealer who travels otherwise known as a hawker or peddler; an agent in a commercial transaction, or a purchaser or customer.[4]\n\nIt is the cognate of Kaufmann, a common German surname.\n\nPeople with the surname or nickname Chapman include:\n\nContents\n\nA\n\nAaron Chapman, Canadian musician and writer\n\nAbel Chapman (1851–1929), British born hunter-naturalist\n\nAdam Chapman (born 1989), Northern Irish footballer\n\nAlfred Chapman (1829–1915), American real estate attorney and investor, best known as one of the founders of Orange, California\n\nAlger Chapman (1904–1983), American attorney, businessman and New York State official\n\nAllan Chapman\n\nAllan Chapman (historian) (born 1946), British historian of science\n\nAllan Chapman (politician) (1897–1966), Scottish Unionist Member of Parliament 1935–1945\n\nAlvah Chapman, Jr. (1921*–2008), American newspaper publisher\n\nAlvan Wentworth Chapman, American botanist\n\nAmy Chapman (born 1987), Australian footballer\n\nAndrew Grant Chapman (1839–1892), American politician\n\nAndy Chapman (born 1959), British indoor soccer player\n\nAnna Vasil’yevna Kushchyenko-Chapman (born 1982), Russian Entrepreneur, television host, and agent of the Russian Federation\n\nAnne Chapman, Franco-American ethnologist\n\nAnnie Chapman (1841–1888), English victim of Jack the Ripper\n\nAroldis Chapman (born 1988), Cuban baseball player\n\nArt Chapman\n\nArt Chapman, (1906–1962), Canadian Ice Hockey player and Olympian\n\nArt Chapman (basketball) (1912–1986), Canadian basketball player\n\nArthur Chapman\n\nArthur Chapman (poet) (1873–1935), American poet and newspaper columnist\n\nArthur B.
