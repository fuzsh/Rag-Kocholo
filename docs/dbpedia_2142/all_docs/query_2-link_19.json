It is now about seven years, since, at the solicitation of Lebbeus Cfiapman, Esq., of Brooklyn, N. Y., and George H. Chapman, Esq., of Say-Brook, Conn., the compiler of this work commenced his labors. At the time he entered upon the task, he had no concep- tion of the amount of labor which would be required in col- lecting and arranging a Genealogical Table of the Descend- ants of Robert Chapman, our common ancestor. Nor was it supposed, when the offer was generously made by one of his descendants, to print and distribute a copy of the work gratis, to all the living descendants, that it would be any- thing more than a pamphlet of forty or fifty pages, at the most. It was soon found, however, that the descendants were so numerous and scattered throughout all the states of the Union, that a much longer time would be required to obtain returns from them, at all satisfactory, than was at first contemplated. The task has been a laborious one, consuming not less than one-third of the author's w^aking hours for seven years, accompanied with no small pecuniary expense, in traveling from place to place t« examine records, and in postage, stationery, etc. About thirteen hundred let- ters have been written, more than one hundred burial grounds visited, and the records of more than forty towns thoroughly searched, and not a less number of probate, church and par- ish records examined. The oldest and largest libraries of New England have also been consulted, to gather up what- ever could be obtained of historical interest in regard to the 1* 6 PREFACE. » Chapman Family in the Old World and the New. The expense of a work of this sort can never be estimated by any but those who have been engaged in similar labors. A full pecuniary compensation can not be expected, as the sale of the work must be comparatively limited. The compiler assures his numerous relatives, to whom he introduces himself in these pages, that he has spared no care or pains to make a perfect record. Perfection, however, in such a work can' not be expected. No small perplexity has often been experienced, in deciphering old records and inscriptions, and in reading some of the letters received from aged persons, and others unaccustomed to writing. Often, too, the statements in regard to ages, dates of births, mar- riages and deaths of different branches of a family, have con- flicted with each other. In some instances, no dates can be found, in which case we have attempted only an approxi- mation to accuracy. It is exceedingly difficult to avoid mistakes in printing a work containing so many figures, even when the copy is complete. Several errors escaped the notice of both the proof-reader and compiler, which are corrected at the end of the volume. While some who have been addressed have promptly replied and rendered all the aid in their power in transmitting records and collecting facts, others have neg- lected for weeks and months, and even years, the answers they might have given at once, and many have never an- swered at all. It is to be regretted that a few families have been so sep- arated from their relatives that no trace of them and their descendants has been found. Still, with few exceptions, we think it will be found that a full and accurate record is given. There are, of course, many of the younger generation now on the stage,- who have been born during the seven years that have transpired since the preparation of the work com- menced, whose .names are not included. The special thanks of the compiler are due to several persons who have kindly aided him in his researches. To Isaac Chapman, Esq., of East Haddam, who although /^ PREFACE. 7 now an octogenarian, has manifested a deep interest in this work, from the beginning, and rendered essential service in tracing the descendants of Robert Chapman, the third, who settled at East Haddam among the first proprietors of the town. To Sylvester Jldd, Esq., of Northampton, Mass., the gi'eat genealogist of the Connecticut valley, for hints as to the best sources of information in regard to the early life and history of our ancestor. To Rev. John A. Murray, for valuable information, in regard to the Rev. Jedediah Chapman, Avho settled at Orangedale, New Jersey, in 1766, and his numerous and distinguished descendants, widely scattered throughout the states of the south and west. Also, to Miss Caroline Vale- ria Reynolds, a grand-daughter of the same Rev. Jedediah Chapman, for the interesting incidents transmitted, in relation to his history at the time of that eventful struggle which terminated in our country's independence, he being located in that part of the country which, more than any other, was the great battle-field of the American Revolution. Also, to Rev. Robert H. Chapman, of Taladega, Alabama, for a memoir of his father. Rev. Robert Hett Chapman, D. D. To Wheeler Chapman, of Fearing, Ohio, for his prompt and continued aid in collecting a list of the numerous de- scendants of Levi Chapman, who descended from Robert Chapman, in the line of his eldest son John, and who removed to the vicinity of iVIarietta, Ohio, with his family of twelve children, in the year 1794. To Rev. Timothy M. Cooley, D. D., for an interesting account of Isaac Chapman, the father of Mrs. Content Cooley, and a brie\"f outline of his own life and pubHc services. To Rev. David D. Field, D. C, now of Stockbridge, Mass., for assistance in tracing the descendants of Timothy Chapman, of Haddam. To Mr. Paul L. Taylor, of Westport, and Dr. Samuel Noyes, of New Canaan, Conn., for their kind assistance in collecting the names of the descendants of Rev. Daniel 8 PREFACE. Chapman, son of Deac. Nathanael Chapman, the youngest son of Robert, and who settled at Green's Farms, Conn., in 1715. Also, to the Rev. Joseph Chapman, of the Metho- dist Episcopal Church of East Groveland, New York, for his aid in collecting the names of descendants in the same line, in the state of New York. To George H. Chapman, Esq., of Saybrook, for assist- ance in tracing the descendants of Deac. Nathanael Chap- man through the line of the Rev. Daniel Chapman and of Elisha Chapman, and for the deep interest he has mani- fested in this work from the beginning, and but for whose substantial aid and encouragement, it is much to be doubted whether the work would ever have been published. To Mr. Nathaniel Goodwin, of Hartford, for useful hints in regard to the general plan of the work. Also, to George M. Chapman, Esq., of Brooklyn, N. Y., and to William P. Chapman, of New York city, for the general interest they have manifested ; and to the numerous town clerks and clerks of probate, who have allowed the compiler free access to their records. Note. It is the particular request of the compiler, that where mistakes are discovered in the genealogical record of individuals or families, a correction may be promptly for- warded to him, that it may be entered in a preserved copy, and serve to render a future edition more complete ; and also, that births, marriages and deaths which occur hereafter, may be sent, and thus the record be continued for the benefit of succeeding generations.

OUTLINE HISTORY OF SAY-BROOK. As Robert Chapman was one of the first settlers of Say-Brook, some notice seems to be demanded, in a work like this, of the causes which led to the settlement. The settlement of New England resulted from religious tyranny. ^ Under the reign of the Tudors and the Stuarts, many left their native land to enjoy civil and religious freedom, in the, then, solitudes and wilds of America. Required, in their own country, to conform to rites and ceremonies, in their view, inconsistent with the true wor- ship of God, they resolved to forego all the privileges and endear- ments of home, that they might serve their Maker in a manner conformable to the dictates of their own consciences. They came not, to this country, to accumulate property, to acquire renown, or live in ease and splendor. Their motives and aims were vastly higher, viz., to obey God and prepare themselves for heaven. \"With these aims and motives, and with firm trust in God ; with fortitude and cheerfulness they encountered the perils of the ocean, and the toils and sufferings incident to landing upon an inhospitable coast, and subduing the wilderness, in the presence of a severe cli- mate and cruel savages. Li the year 1620, a band of these adven- turers landed on Plymouth Rock, and, in 1629, a company arrived under Mr. John Endicot, and settled Salem and Charlestown. The year following, several other towns were settled, in Massachusetts. In 1633, Rev. Thomas Hooker, of Chelmsford in the county of Essex in England, taking with him Mr. Samuel Stone, a lecturer at Torcestershire, in Northamptonshire, for an assistant in the minis- try, came to Boston, in the Grifiin, a ship of about 300 tons. With him came over the famous Jolm Cotton, Mr. John Haynes, after- ward govemior of Connecticut, Mr. Golf, and two hundred other 2 14 INTRODUCTION. passengers of importance to the colony. They arrived on the 4th of September, 1633. Mr. Hooker and a part of this company pro- ceeded to Newtown, now Cambridge, where they were received, cor- dially, by others that had located themselves there, a short time before. Mr. Hooker was chosen their pastor, and Mr. Stone their teacher. On the 11th of October, the church was gathered, and after solemn fasting and prayer, the pastor and teacher were ordain- ed to their respective offices. The church at Watertown had been gathered on the 27th of August, 1630, and Mr. Philips ordained their pastor. Mr TVarham, with his church and congregation, came over about the same time. Tlie church was organized previous to their leaving England, and Mr. Warhani chosen pastor, and Mr. Maverick their teacher, and they settled at Dorchester. In June, 1635, Mr. Hooker and his congregation came across the wilderness and settled Hartford, Mr. \"Warham and his people settled \"Windsor, Mr. Philips and his congregation settled at Wethersfield, according to the prevailing opinion, the year previous. The above towns, then, included Glastenbury, East Hartford, and East Windsor. The inhabitants of these towns soon agreed upon a constitution of civil government for themselves, and such as should afterward be joined to them. This was the begijming of the government of Con- necticut. About the time of the settlement of these towns, a fort was erected at Say-Brook, under Governor John Winthrop, and a settlement commenced there. The town originally included Killing- worth, Chester, West-Brook and most of the town of Lyme, and was a distinct government from Connecticut, until 1644. About two years previous to the settlement of the towns on the river, John Oldham from Dorchester and three men with him, had trav- eled across the wilderness to Connecticut, to view the country and trade with the Indians. The same year the Dutch entered the river and established a fort, at Hartford, and William Holmes from Plym- outh, within whose jurisdiction Connecticut was regarded as belong- ing, sailed up the river, in defiance of their remonstrances, and erected a house at Windsor. This led to a contest between the Dutch and English, which finally resulted in the foimer abandoning the river. A fort, at the mouth of the river, was deemed important, as a mat- ter of safety, to the towns on the river, and to protect the company from future aggressions. On the 8th of October, 1635, Mr. John Winthrop, son of Gover- nor Winthrop of Massachusetts, arrived at Boston, with a commission INTRODUCTION. 15 from Lord Say and Seal, Lord Brook and other noblemen and gentle- men, interested in the Connecticut Patent, to erect the intended forti- fication. Their lordships sent over men, ordnance, ammunition and 2,000 pounds sterling, for the accomphshment of their design. In August previous, twenty men arrrived in Massachusetts, sent over by Sir Eichard Saltonstall, to take possession of a large quantity of land in Connecticut, and to make settlements under the patent of Lord Say and Seal, with whom he was a principal associate. These twenty men under the direction of Winthrop, late in the winter of 1635-6, or very early in the succeeding spring, repaired to the mouth of the river and erected the fort.* They were, soon after, reinforced by John Underbill and nineteen men, who were sent to their assistance, to prevent their being overpowered by the Lidians. Great were the hardships, and numerous the privations, of these early settlers at Say-Brook. About the beginning of October, the enemy, concealing themselves in the high grass, in the meadows, surprised five of the garrison at Say-Brook as they were carrying home their hay. One of them by the name of Butterfield, was taken and tortured to death. The rest of them made their escape and entered the fort, one of them having had five arrows shot into him. It was this circumstance that gave it the name of Buttei-field's Meadow, which it still retains. But a few days after the above occurrence, one Joseph Tilly, a master of a small vessel, was captured by the Indians, when proceed- ing down the river. He anchored two or three miles above the fort, and, taking a canoe and one man with him, went a fowling. Imme- diately, on discharging his piece, a large number of Pequots arising from their concealment, took him, and killed his companion. Tilly, being a man of uncommon strength and energy, determined to show himself superior to the tortures, they might inflict upon him. They treated him in the most barbarous manner, first cutting off his hands and then his feet, and so, gradually, torturing him to death. But he died without a struggle or a groan. The enemy kept up a constant watch upon the river, and the settlers at Say-Brook. A house had been erected about two miles from the fort and six of the garrison were sent to keep it. As three of them were fowling, at a small dis- tance from the house, they were suddenly attacked by nearly an hundred of the Pequots, and two of them were taken. The other ' See Appendix, note A. 16 INTRODUCTION, cut his way through them, sword in hand, and made his escape, wounded with two arrows. Before winter, the garrison were so pressed by the enemy, that they were obliged to keep, ahnost wholly, within the reach of their guns. The Pequots destroyed all the out-houses, burnt the stacks of hay, and ravaged everything, which was not within command of the fort. The cattle belonging to the garrison were killed or wounded. Some of them came home, with the arrows of the enemy sticking in them. The fort was but little better than in a state of siege, durinej the whole winter. The enemy so encompassed it about, and watched all the motions of the garrison, that it was dangerous, at any time, to go out of the reach of the cannon. As spring arrived, they became still more mischievous and trouble- some. They kept such a constant watch upon the river that men could not pass up and down, with any safety, without a strong guard. They waylaid the roads and fields, and kept Connecticut in a state of constant fear and alarm. Li March, Lieut. Gardiner, who com- manded the fort at Say-Brook, going out with ten or twelve men to burn the marshes, was waylaid by a narrow neck of land, and as soon as he had passed the narrow part of the neck, the enemy rose upon him and killed three of his men. The rest made their escape to their fort ; but one of them was mortally wounded, so that he died the next day. Gardiner himself received a slight wound. The enemy pursued them, in great numbers, to the very fort, and encom- passed it on all sides. They challenged the English to come out and fight, and mocked them in the groans, pious invocations and dying language of their friends. The cannon loaded with grape-shot, were fired upon them, and they were dispersed.* Some time after this, the Indians, in a number of canoes, beset a shallop, which was going down the river, with three men on board. The men fought bravely, but were overpowered with numbers. The enemy shot one through the head with an arrow, and he fell over- board ; the other two were taken, tortured, cut and mangled in the most shocking manner, and hung up, by the neck, upon the river's bank, that, as the English passed by, they might behold the miserable objects of their vengeance. So great was the annoyance of the Indians to the whites, particu- * R ;ee Appendix, note A. INTRODUCTION. 17 larly upon the river, that the Court met iu February, 1637, to take efficient measures for subduing them. Capt. Mason was soon dis- patched with twenty men to reinforce the garrison, and to keep the enemy at a greater distance. After his arrival at the fort, the In- dians made no farther attacks upon it, but appeared very much to withdraw from that quarter. Soon after this, Underbill, who had been appointed in the preced- ing fall to keep garrison at Say-Brook, was sent from Massachusetts with twenty men, to reinforce the garrison. On their arrival, Capt. Mason and his men returned, immediately, to Hartford. A special court was summoned, at Hartford, on the 1st of May, to devise means for the defense of Connecticut from the common enemy. They voted the raising of ninety men, forthwith, in Hartford, Weth- ersfield and Windsor. These Avere furnished with the necessary sup- plies, and with Mason for their commander, fell down the river in a pinnace and a shallop for Say-Brook, on the 10th of the same month. The company consisted of ninety Englishmen, and about seventy Mohegan and river Indians, commanded by Uucas their sachem. The troops arrived at Say-Brook on the 15th. The Mohegans, at their urgent request, were set on shore before they arrived at Say- Brook. They fell in with about forty Pequots on their march, and killed seven and took one prisoner. They put him to death in a most barbarous manner ; he having before been received kindly at the fort, and in a most perfidious manner betrayed the English, and been the cause of most of the attacks and murders that had ah-eady occurred. On the 19th of May, Mason proceeded, with his company by water, to Narraganset, and formed, with the Indians there, a junc- tion for the purpose of avenging the murder of their countrymen by the Pequots. He marched with his company, consisting of sev- enty-seven Englishmen, sixty Mohegans, and 200 Narragansets, for Mystic, the head-quarters of the enemy. He was joined by others on the march, until his entire force amounted to about 500 men. AiTiving at Mystic in the following night, they surprised the Pe- quots in their fort. So sudden was the attack, and so unprepared were they for defense, that at morn, the entire garrison were cut to pieces,- the fort burned to the ground, and five or six hundred In- dians perished by the sword or in the flames.* So completely was the power of the enemy broken, by this disas- * See Winthroji's Journal and Trumbull's Connecticut. 2* 18 INTRODUCTION. ter, that they never after rallied, in sufficient force, to offer any seri- ous annoyance to the settlers upon the river. The conquest of the Pequots struck all the, Indians, in New England, with terror, and they were seized with such fear of the displeasure and arms of the English, that they had no open war with them for forty years. There was a general rejoicing throughout the colonies. A day of thanks- giving was appointed, and all the churches of New England sent up their songs of praise to him, who had given them the victory, and the prospect of future peace and prosperity. As Rohert Chapman was one of the band of adventurers, who es- tablished the fort at Say-Brook, and was a sharer in the events which have been narrated, it was deemed proper to introduce the previous account of the early settlement of the town where he resided until his decease, a period of more than fifty years. At this distance of time, the descendants of those early settlers, scattered up and down in the land, and now numbering not less prob- ably than 100,000, in the enjoyment of all the blessings conferred by science and the arts, by civil and religious freedom, can not, fully, realize what they suffered, nor how great is their indebtedness for the legacy conferred upon them. They were men of undaunted courage, indomitable resolution, firm religious principle, and most of them possessing, for their time, supe- rior mental cultivation, men from whom none of their descendants need blush to have derived their origin. \" Just men they were, And all their study bent, To worship God aright and know his works, Not hid, nor those things least which might preserve Freedom and peace to man.\" HISTORY OF THE CHAPMAN FAMILY. The name Chapman is of Saxon origin. A large class of sur- names among the Anglo-Saxons, is derived from *trades, or occupa- tions. The Saxon word fOeapman, means a Chapman, marketman, a monger or merchant. * Cambden's Remains, page 104. f Dictionary of the Saxon language. INTRODUCTION. 19 The surname Chapman occurs among the earliest of English surnames, and the family, in many of its branches, was somewhat what distmguished at an early period. Not a few of them still -occupy prominent stations in the British Empire. In the year 1298, John Chapman was returned to Parliament as Burgess for Chippen- ham. *In 1307, Peter Chapman was returned Burgess for Derby. In 1309, John Chapman returned for Surrey. In 1307, Robert Chapman returned for Preston, and in 1311 for Steyning, and in 1321, for Taunton, and in 1322 for Taunton, to the Parliament at York. In 1311, Philip Chapman, returned for Taunton, and \"Wil- liam Chapman for Bridge water. In 1313, John Chapman, returned for Chippenham. In 1315, for Warwick, and in 1325 for Hereford. In 1324, Geoffrey Chapman returned for Cambridge. In 1315, \"William Chapman returned for Downton, and in 1325, for Seaford. In 1326, John Chapman was appointed, by Parliament, to attend the array and muster of the Hundred of Loose, in the county of Suffolk, on Thursday, the 24th of April, after the Feast of St. George. At the same time and place, Robert Chapman, of the township of Fram- lingham, was also appointed to attend the array and muster. fPeter Chapman, ironmonger, gave £60 to the eight prisons in and about London. JA letter appears from Simon Archbishop of Canterbury, to John Chapman, one of his clergy in 1430, and to \"William Chapman of London, in 1438. In 1534, Thomas Chapman takes the oath of fidelity, on hiS in- duction to the chair of sacred theology. In 1553, George Chap- man was appointed to a rectory in London, and in the same year Thomas Chapman, \" ad Rectoriam de Merston cicestren.\" Sir John Chapman was High Sheriff of Sussex and Surrey in 1634. A spe- cial commission was issued concerning the suppression of schism, in London, in 1599, Henry Chapman being at that time alderman. §Sir John Chapman, knight, of Tower street, was elected alderman in 1679, and served in the office of high sheriff\", the same year. In 1689, he was chosen lord mayor and died a few days before the ex- piration of his term. He was the son and heir of Sir \"William Chapman, Bart. ||In 1619, Alexander Chapman, S. T.

He was a native of the county of Norfolk, and was chaplain to the princess Elizabeth, consort of the prince Frederick, elector palatine, and became arch- deacon of Stowe, in Lincolnshire, and a prebendary of that church. He died Sept. 6th, 1629, aged fifty-two, and was buried in this cathedral, where there is a monument with his bust on it in white marble, erected to his memory, and this inscription. \"Alexandre Chapman, Norfolcienci, Sacrse Theologice Doctori, in Academia Cantebrigiensi Serenissimaj Elisabethe Frederici Electoris Palatini consorti a Sacellis Dominse sueb clementissimaa Archdeacano de Stowe in comitatu Lin- colniensi et metrojJolitiaB hujus Ecclesia Prebendario, viro Multiplici Lin- guarum, ut et Literarum Scientia instrnctissimo, concionatori mire Flexanimo dumq : per vires licuit et valitudinem non sediilo, minus quam solido : Pietate Erga Deum, charitate erga proximtini et morum suavitate, erga omnes eximio, charissimo.

INTRODUCTION. 21 The following lines occur in English under the latter inscription. \" This soul too rich a prize for mortal race, Endued with nature and the gifts of grace, Once viewed this world, and, then in much disdain, Left this void earth and now in glory reigns.\" George Chapman, a distinguished poet, flourished in the seventeenth century. After receiving a university education, he settled in London, where the great luminaries of the time, Shakespeare, Jonson, Sidney, Spenser and Daniel, became his familiar friends. He expected pre- ferment from the patronage of the Walsinghams, and of Somerset and Prince Henry, but all his hopes ended in disappointment. Be- sides seventeen dramatic pieces, one of which was the famous mask called the Temple, he translated Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and at- tempted Hesiod and Musa3us. Pope, who has borrowed much from him without acknowledgment, calls him an enthusiast in poetry, but the remark is invidious, as Chapman possessed respectable poet- ical powers, and was a i^n of some genius. He died 1634, aged seventy-seven.* His monument may be seen in the parish of St. Giles. John Chapman, D. D., a learned divine, flourished in the eight- eenth century. He was educated at Eton and at King's College, Cambridge, for the provostship of which he was an unsuccessful can- didate. He obtained the livings of Mersham and Adlington, Kent, from Archbishop Potter, to whom he was chaplain, and at the death of this prelate, as his executor, he presented himself as one of the primate's options, to the precentorship of Lincoln ; an appointment which was confirmed by Chancellor Henley, but set aside by the House of Lords. He died 14th of October, 1784, in his eightieth year. His Avritings were.

It is a singular fact, that while the name of Chapman occurs in the records referred to, for several centuries back, in different shires and counties of England ; the Christian name of Robert has been See Rymer's Fcedera or Public Acts in Latin, vol. 10, page 717. INTRODUCTION. 23 found only in Yorkshire. It occurs, frequently, as a prevailing fam- ily name in that shire, which goes very far to confirm the family tradition, that Robert Chapman, who came to Boston in 1635, and to Say-Brook, the succeeding spring, came from Hull, in Yorkshire. There are not less than sixteen different families or branches of the great Chapman family, designated by their respective coats of arms. Those of Cambridgeshire and Yorkshire and London, are in the main alike, a crescent, — the crest being a dexter arm embowed, habit- ed in mail, holding in the hand a broken tilting sj^ear enfiled with a chaplet, of laurel, as appears in the engraving ; with the motto \" Crescit sub poudere virtus ;\" Virtue increases under aflliction. (See engraving at the head of the genealogy.) The following account of the Chapman family, taken from Burke's Peerage, supplementary volume, 1848, p. 65, is inserted here, as the name of Robert occurs often, and there is little room to doubt, that it is the family with which our common ancestor was connected, although we are not able to give the name of his father. As a stig- ma attached to those who left their country, under the banner of Puritanism, the same care was not taken to retain their names in family registers, as was the case with those who continued residents until their death. Those who left were soon forgotten, and hence the extreme difficulty of tracing any connection between the early settlers of our country and their ancestors, in the father-land, especially, if those who left their ancestral home, had not been in any way distin- guished, before leaving. The majority of the Puritan settlers were, like our ancestoi\", in the morning of life, and consequently had en- joyed no opportunity to fill stations of importance, whei-e they could perform public acts which would be matter of record. \"CHAPMAN OF WHITBY STRAND. \" Chapman, Thomas, of \"Whitby, county York, F.

The late Sir Thomas Chapman, und Admiral Chapman of Stveden belonged to the family. This family, (we quote an old family manuscript,) was settled, at or near Whitby, in the time of Henry III.,* as appears by ancient records, and in the time of Richard II. some of them were prosecuted and imprisoned, by the abbot of Whitby, for maintaining their just rights and privileges, but were soon set at liberty, by the abbot, without paying any fees. They in- creased much in a century or two, and many of them were in the parliamentary army. Roger Chapman and John Chapman were of Yburn near Whitby in the county of York, in 1381, fromf one of whom descended Rob- ert Chapman, temp, of Henry VIIL, who died Dec. 2d, 1607, and Avas father of John Chapman, born 24th of Elizabeth, 1570, and died olst of March, 1614; whose son Robert, baptized Nov. 19th, 1603, married Mary Acklowe and by her, who died 24th of March, 1667-8, had issue as follows.

A Robert Chapynan was living at Oyster River, in Dover, New Hampshire, in 1663. We have, here, fourteen men of the name of Chapman, besides our ancestor, among the early settlers, between whom no near rela- tionship has been discovered. It would have been impossible to trace the descendants of Robert of Say-Brook, and have kept them distinct from the descendants of the other stocks, had not the firsi three generations been recorded on the Say-Brook records. Being himself town-clerk for many years, his marriage and the births of his children, and of most of his grand-children, are recor- ded, in his own hand. It has been gratifying to the compiler to find, that with few ex- ceptions, the descendants of Robert Chapman have been men of in- dustrious habits. While they have contributed their full proportion to the agricultural, mechanical and commercial wealth of the land, a goodly number of them have been men of cultivated minds — who have honored the learned professions. 3 26 INTRODUCTION.

A BRIEF SKETCH OF THE CHARACTER, LIFE AND PUBLIC SER- VICES OF ROBERT CHAPMAN, THE FIRST SETTLER. Most persons take peculiar satisfaction in being able to trace their lineage to remote ancestors ; in learning where they lived, and through what scenes of prosperity and adversity they passed, and in recounting the benefits which they conferred upon their posterity. Nothing, definite, is known of Robert Chapman, previous to his emi- gi'ation to this country. According to the family tradition, he came from Hull in England to Boston, in 1635, from which place he sailed in company with Lyon Gardiner, for Say-Brook, Nov. 3, as one of the company of twenty men, who were sent over by Sir Richard Saltonstall, to take possession of a large tract of land, and make settlements, near the mouth of the Connecticut River, under the patent of Lord Say and Seal as already stated. He is supposed to have been about eighteen years of age. After the Indians were subdued, deeming it safe to form plantations at a distance from the fort, they proceeded to clear up the forests and form a permnent settlement. For about ten years after leaving England, according to a tradition in the family, he kept a journal. It is to be regretted that, about twelve years after the establishment ofi the fort, it was burned, and the records of those who occupied it were lost. He was one of the particular friends of Col. George Fenwick. That he was a man of influence, in the town of Say- Brook, is evident from the fact, that, for many years, he held the office of town-clerk, and clerk of the Oyster River quarter, and filled many other important stations. He was for many years commission- er for Say-Brook, and was elected as their deputy to the General Court, forty-three times, and assistant nine times. He was, therefore, a member of the legislature of the state at more sessions than any other man, from the settlement of Say-Brook, to the present time. The following list will show the number of times and dates of the sessions he attended. He was deputy to the General Court, which set at Hartford, accord- ing to the colony records — INTRODUCTION. 27 1. Sept. 14th, 1654. 23. May 11th, 1665. 2. Feb. 26th, 1656. 24. May 9th, 1667. 3.

The colony records also show that each of his three sons were repre- sentatives to the legislature : the eldest, twenty -two sessions ; the second one, eighteen sessions ; the third, twenty-four sessions. Robert Chapman seems to have been a soldier. Lieut. Col. Gar- diner, in his \" History of the Pequot War,\" speaks of him as a sen- tinel in a skirmish on the neck, Feb. 22d, 1637, with the Indians, and once as engaged in beating samp.f It appears, from the records of Say-Brook, that Robert Chapman, • It will be understood, by the reader, that the government of Connecticut consisted of a Governor, Lieut. Governor, and deputies from the several towns which constituted the lower house, and assistants or magistrates, which coiif^ti- tuted the upper house. t See Appendix, note A. 28 INTRODUCTION. was a very large landholder, in the towns of Say-Brook and East Iladdam. He also owned a very large tract of land, in Hebron, leaving at his decease, to each of his three sons, fifteen hundred acres in that town, which he received as one of the legatees of Uncas and , his sons.* \"A will of Attawauhood, third son of Uncas, is signed March 10th, 1676, in Lyme, near Eight Mile Island, in Connecticut River. He gave to his sons a large tract of land, apparently north-west of Say-Brook, with the condition that if one died it should go to the survivor, and if both died, to their sister. He also left them forty acres, at Podunk, and about half a mile square within a tract which had, a little previously, been added to Hartford. These lands, if his three sons died, were to revert to his wives. The rest of his property was given away, in enormous tracts, to various white persons of Hartford, Say- Brook and other places. Whole townships, as for instance those of Windham, Mansfield and Canterbury, were included. A single grant covered an 100,000 acres, and the whole line of lands reached eighteen miles north and south, and, in some places, east and west. The Indians, who then resided on his territo- ries, he directed to leave them, and attach themselves to his father, Uncas. His sons, he desired to live near Say-Brook, to be taught English by their mother, and, at the end of four years, to be placed at an English school. Thir- ty-five pounds, which were owing to him by certain whites, as well as the rents of all the lands which he had left the boys, were to be expended, in their support and education. He recommended his children, earnestly to all his legatees, but more particularly to three, whom he mentioned by name, Robert Chapman, William Pratt and Thomas Buckingham. For himself, he directed that he should be buried at Say-Brook in a coffin, and after the manner of the EngUsh.\"t Robert settled himself, on a tract of land, in Oyster River, about two miles west of Say-Brook fort, which has descended in the line of the youngest son of each family, never having been bought or sold, and is now occupied by George H. Chapman, Esq., who is the youngest of the fifth generation. J He was a man of exemplary piety, and, but a short time previous to his decease, he wrote an address to his children, who were all members of the church ; in which, it is said, he exhorted them to a devoted life and to abide by the covenant, into which they had entered, with God and his church. That document was in the hands of one ♦ For a description of his lands, see Appendix, note B. t Vide Indian Papers, vol. 1, Doc. 30.

INTRODUCTION. 29 of his descendants, now on the stage, but it is to be regretted that being lent a few years since, to a person out of the family, it was never returned, and, we fear, is irrecoverably lost. There is some doubt as to the town, in England, where Robert was born. Some suppose it was Hull, the place where he embarked. Others suppose that although he embarked from Hull, which was one of the shipping ports, he was a native of Kent. It is the full belief (for reasons already stated) of the compiler of this work, that he was a native of Yorkshire, and that his father's name was either John or Robert, and most likely the latter. Robert's parents were Puritans. His mother, according to a tradi- tion in the family, was particularly anxious to emigrate to this coun- try, which his father opposed. She induced \" Robin\" first, and after- ward his three sisters, to embark for the wilds of America, in the hope that, when they were established in the new world, their father would consent to accompany her across the Atlantic and join them. There is no reason to suppose that she ever realized her hopes. Of the sisters of Robert, (according to an ancient document in the pos- session of the Bushnell family, in Say-Brook,) one married \"William Bushnell, the brother of Deacon Francis Bushnell ; another married a gentlemen who removed, with her, to the West Indies ; and the third died unmarried.

The records of the General Court show in what estimation Robert Chapman was held by that honorable body. The following extracts will not fail to interest his numerous de- scendants. At a session of the General Court, at Hartford, Oct. 3d, 1654, an order was passed to fit out an expedition against the Narraganset Indians.

DESCENDANTS OF JOHN CHAPMAN, THE ELDEST SON OF ROBERT CHAPMAN, THE FIRST SETTLER. THIRD GENERATION. I. Joux CnAriiAK, the eldest son of Robert Chapman, of Say-Brook, married Elizabeth Ilawlej, sister of Joseph Hawley, of Stratford. June 7, 1670, by whom he had^ln-ee children. She died May 10th, 1676. Mr. Chapman married iOT his second wife Elizabeth Bea- mont, (Beman,) the daughter of William Beament, of Say-Brook, by whom he had ten children. Of these eight were born in Say-Brook, and two in East Haddam. The title of captain is given him in the town and church records of East Haddam, and also in the records of the secretary of state. That he was a man of considerable note in the town of Say-Brook, and at East Haddam, after his removal, is evident from the fact that he rei^resented the fonner town in the Gen- eral Court, at fourteen sessions, and the latter at eight sessions. At the session of the General Court which convened May 10th, 1694, the following act was passed; \"This Court grants liberty to Capt. John Chapman to set up a ferry over the Great River in Had- dam for the future ;\" hence the name Chapman's Ferry. The pro- bate recox'ds of Hartford, and the town records of East Haddam and of Hebron, show that he owned large tracts of land in each of said towns. He died, as is supposed, in the spring of 1712. His estate was settled by the court of probate, at Hartford, April 8th, 1712. His second wife, Elizabeth Chapman, died October 30th, 1694.

He soon after returned to Say-Brook, where he died in the month of July, 1747.

After the discharge of the debts due from the estate, the use of the remainder was granted to the widow during her natural life, and as no children are mentioned in the set- tlement of the estate, it is presumed Mr. Chapman died without issue.
