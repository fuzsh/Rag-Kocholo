He was brought up by his Allen grandparents and by his older brother, Allen Chapman. Thrashley Chapman married Catherine Edwards in 1795. Catherine was born in South Carolina, her family having settled in Delaware in 1701, then moving to South Carolina in 1735. Thrashley Chapman and Catherine Edwards Chapman moved to Wayne County, Mississippi in 1815 with their ten children and 31 slaves.
