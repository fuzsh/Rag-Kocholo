        "text": "Days Of Our Lives co-stars Abi Titmuss and Ari Welkom are expecting their first child.\n\nThe British star, who came to prominence in her native England as a reality TV star and glamour model after dating TV presenter John Leslie, has made a name for herself Stateside by appearing as Nurse Jackie in the long-running soap opera.\n\nFormer nurse Abi, who now goes by the surname Evelyn, announced her engagement to actor Ari in March (17), and admits she already knew she was pregnant at the time, but had to remain tight-lipped until her doctor gave her the green light to share the happy news.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n“I’m 15 weeks pregnant…I’m so excited about becoming a mum for the first time,” she gushed to Hello magazine. “I’d been bursting to share the news sooner but we hadn’t had the all-clear from the doctor so I had to hold back.\n\n“I found out I was expecting in the second week of January and it has been very hard keeping it a secret until now.\n\nThe pair plan to tie the knot in May (17)."
