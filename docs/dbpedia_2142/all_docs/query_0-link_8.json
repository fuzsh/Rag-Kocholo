        "text": "Logan Fry, a graduate of Oberlin College, is a trashfilm director and actor located in Richfield, Ohio.\n\nHe was born William Logan Fry in Columbus, Ohio in September, 1944. The son of a Federal Administrative Law Judge and an elementary school teacher, he graduated from Oberlin in 1967 and Case Western University Law School in 1970, concurrently serving in Artillery, then Judge Advocate General, units of the United States Army Reserve. In addition to reserve duty, Logan earned his tuition by working on the family Christmas tree farm near Akron, Ohio, as a janitorial assistant in a rubber company research lab, a shipping and receiving clerk in a light fixture factory, a rake and shovel man for a landscaping company, a food runner in the college dining hall and a night bellman at the local Holiday Inn.\n\nDirecting and acting weren't his first career choices; after graduation from law school, he served as a law intern in the Law Department of the City of Cleveland (Carl B. Stokes Administration), then attorney in Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Goodyear Atomic Corporation (which operated the Piketon uranium enrichment plant) and private practice. He retired in 1987 to become a world-class weaver with work from the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Cleveland Art Museum and the deYoung Museum in San Francisco; and an artist, writer and web designer. Logan has traveled the world, from active war zones in the Middle East to the brothels of Amsterdam, Knoxville, Tennessee and San Francisco.\n\nActing an opportunity that presented itself when Spider-Man 3 (2007) came to Cleveland, Ohio. Logan was hired on as a precision driver for scenes with Sandman attempting his escape from Spider-Man in an armored truck. Although he had no formal training, he was hooked. Since then, he has done background work in major studio films projects like I Am Legend (2007), Taking Chance (2009), Real Steel - Stahlharte Gegner (2011), Die fantastische Welt von Oz (2013), Gotham (2014), Mr. Robot (2015), Billions (2016), White Boy Rick (2018), Judas and the Black Messiah (2021) and Weißes Rauschen (2022); as well as event participant, soldier, zombie or undead in regional independent film. Background in major film built knowledge--the opportunity to see the greatest directors and actors at work; while featured work in indies like Death of the Dead (2011), Das Herz eines Helden (2011) and Revenge of the Spacemen (2014) provided experience in speaking roles.\n\nMore recently, Logan has undertaken the production and direction of his own film, with short and micro-short films such as Gimme Head: the Tale of the Cuyahoga Valley Bigfoot (2016), Ro-Boob: The Farting Robot Monster (2018) and The Last Man on Earth (2020), generally performing every role and task of the filmmaking process. Success has come swiftly, and his films have screened not only in his home state of Ohio, and venues from NYC to LA; but also Canada, Mexico, Panama, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina, Chile, UK, France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Serbia, Russia, Lithuania, Moldava, Romania, Slovenia, Portugal, Sweden, The Netherlands, Hungary, Belgium, Macedonia, Malta, Ukraine, Egypt, South Africa, Uganda, Turkey, UAE, Iraq, Iran, India, China, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Israel, Bangladesh, Philippines, Nepal, Bhutan, Tawain, Kuwait, Sri Lanka, and Australia, altogether fifty-four countries on six continents. In fact, Logan has traveled to Sudbury, Canada; Mexico City, Mexico; Montevideo, Uruguay; Barcelona, Spain; Belgrade, Serbia; and Kassel, Germany to be with his fans. \"I'm an international filmmaker and being with a live audience teaches me so much about my films and how to connect with my audience and fans.\" He continues: \"Covid slowed me down in 2020, but I'll be back on the circuit soon.\"\n\nLogan counts outsider and trashfilm directors such as Don Dohler as primary inspirations; proving that you don't need to be a film school graduate with Hollywood connections to make good films. \"Just make them funny and weird!\" he insists.\n\nHe was born in Reykjavik, Iceland and moved to the United States at the age of 5. Gunnar lived in Maine till he was 11, his family then moving to Texas, where he went to high school before attending the University of Texas. At the university, he did some theater work and majored in English and mathematics before going on to graduate in English and Scandinavian Studies. Despite graduating in the aforementioned fields, his first job out of high school was as a computer operator.\n\nIn the summer of 1973, he heard that Tobe Hooper and others were in town to work on a movie and decided to try out for a part. After interviewing with Tobe Hooper and the writer of Blutgericht in Texas (1974), Kim Henkel, he was cast in the role of the disturbed, mentally handicapped killer, Leatherface.\n\nAfter Chainsaw, Hansen went on to work as a freelance writer for magazines for several years before going on to write books, one later being set in Iceland about purported serial killer, Henry Lee Lucas. He has gone on to write multiple screenplays - one co-written with his partner Gary Jones, director of Mosquito (1994)).\n\nGunnar also directed a documentary on Greenland and had a stint designing web pages for GTE.\n\nThe personification of class and cultivation on the movie screen, comely actress Kay Johnson forsook a prominent stage and film career in order to play wife to actor John Cromwell and mother to their two children. Still and all, the elegant actress, reminiscent in looks and style to that of Irene Dunne and Judith Anderson, contributed to a number of important '30s and early '40s films and is deserving of a richer place in Hollywood history than has been acknowledged thus far.\n\nBorn Catherine Townsend Johnson, the daughter of a Michigan architect (Thomas R. Johnson--who worked in the firm of Cass Gilbert the architect of the impressive Woolworth Building in NYC), Kay received her early education at the Drew Seminary for Young Women and later, intent on becoming an actress, studied at Sargent's Dramatic School of the American Academy of Dramatic Art (AADA). Her first professional role came with the Theatre Guild's Chicago production of \"R.U.R.\" in the role of Helena, a robot. From there she appeared on Broadway in \"Go West, Young Man\" and continued on with stage roles in \"The Morning After,\" \"One of the Family,\" \"No Trespassing\" and \"Crime\".\n\nKay met actor/producer/director Cromwell while she was appearing in the play \"A Free Soul\" in 1928 and he was involved in another play. They married later that year (October) and moved to California, where he directed her in a stage production of \"The Silver Cord\". Her showy role as Christine earned the attention of none other than Cecil B. DeMille, who cast her in his film Dynamit (1929) opposite Charles Bickford and Conrad Nagel. While the movie received lukewarm reviews, Kay, who suffered from appendicitis and had surgery during filming, was instantly noticed. She continued on with The Ship from Shanghai (1930), This Mad World (1930) (directed by William C. de Mille, the brother of C.B.), The Spoilers (1930) (opposite Gary Cooper), the title role as Madam Satan (1930) (again for C.B. DeMille), and Billy the Kid (1930) starring Johnny Mack Brown as the legendary gunslinger.\n\nKay alternated between stage and film parts in the following years. She toured with another production of \"The Silver Cord\" and appeared as Roxanne opposite Richard Bennett's lead in \"Cyrano de Bergerac\". Later she was on stage in \"When Ladies Meet\" and \"Living Dangerously\". On screen Kay appeared in the mediocre films The Single Sin (1931) and The Spy (1931) before glowing onscreen in such fare as Der Tag an dem die Bank gestürmt wurde (1932) and This Man Is Mine (1934), the latter directed by husband Cromwell.\n\nKay's most noteworthy career assignment came with the screen role of Nora in W. Somerset Maugham's classic Human Bondage (1934)--again, directed by her husband Cromwell--with Leslie Howard and Bette Davis completing the romantic triangle. Cromwell went on to direct Kay on screen again in Village Tale (1935), Jalna (1935) and Abenteuer in der Südsee (1942). Other notable Kay Johnson films included White Banners (1938), Mr. Lucky (1943) and her last, Mark Twains Abenteuer (1944). Her final acting appearance was in a prime role opposite Ralph Bellamy in a stage production of \"State of the Union\" in 1945.\n\nKay never aggressively pursued her career, instead focusing on her marriage to Cromwell and the raising of their two children. The couple's first child was adopted in 1938; their second son, born in January of 1940, became the noted character actor James Cromwell. Following her divorce from Cromwell in the late '40s, Kay decided to remain out of the limelight. She died just short of her 71st birthday at her Waterford, CT., home on November 17, 1975, long forgotten.\n\nTall, thin, wiry Sam Elliott is the classic picture of the American cowboy. Elliott began his acting career on the stage and his film debut was in Butch Cassidy und Sundance Kid (1969). Although his future wife, Katharine Ross co-starred in the film, the two did not meet until they filmed Das Haus des Satans (1978) together. Over the years there would be few opportunities to act in feature westerns, but it would be television that gave him that opportunity, in Die Sacketts (1979), Die Schattenreiter (1982) and Kampf um Yellow Rose (1983), among others. He would also work in non-westerns, usually as a tough guy, as in Lifeguard (1976) and Road House (1989). In 1985 he played Cher's love interest Gar in the drama Die Maske (1985), and he was in some cop movies such as Fatal Beauty (1987) and Blue Jean Cop (1988). In the 1990s, Elliott was back on the western trail, playing everyone from Brig. Gen. John Buford in the film Gettysburg (1993) to Wild Bill Hickok in the made-for-TV movie Buffalo Girls (1995). In 1991 he wrote the screenplay and co-starred with his wife in the made-for-TV western Conagher (1991), and two years later he played Wyatt Earp's brother Virgil in Tombstone (1993), with Kurt Russell as Wyatt. In 1995 the starred as John Pierce the tense thriller The final Cut - Tödliches Risiko (1995), as a former head of a Bomb Squad who must to stop a dangerous bomber. In 1998 he was the narrator of the hilarious comedy The Big Lebowski (1998), playing him as The Stranger, and returned to the Western in the drama The Hi-Lo Country (1998), closing the 20th century with another western, the TV movie Die Gesetzlosen (1999).\n\nSam Elliott started the 21st century with the Stephen Frears' TV movie Fail Safe (2000) playing Congressman Raskob, and Rufmord - Jenseits der Moral (2000) as Kermit Newman, at the side of Joan Allen, Jeff Bridges and Gary Oldman, and in Wir waren Helden (2002) as Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley, together Mel Gibson. In 2003 he played Gen. Thunderbolt Ross in the Ang Lee's pre-MCU Hulk (2003), repeating in another Marvel superhero movie as Caretaker in Ghost Rider (2007). After participating in the fantasy movie Der goldene Kompass (2007) and made a stellar cameo in Up in the Air (2009), Elliott played Clay Wheeler in the box office flop comedy Haben Sie das von den Morgans gehört? (2009), starring Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker, and in 2012 he was a supporting character as Mac Macleod in Robert Redford's The Company You Keep - Die Akte Grant (2012). After the playing Coach Moore in the sport drama Draft Day - Tag der Entscheidung (2014) In 2015 Elliott was hyperactive, appearing in seven different productions including cinema and TV: Tim und Lee (2015), Für die zweite Liebe ist es nie zu spät (2015), Sam Elliott, the sixth season of Justified (2010) as Avery Markham, and Arlo & Spot (2015) voicing Butch. Two years later was absolute star in the drama The Hero (2017) as Lee Hayden, and in the sci-fi movie The Man Who Killed Hitler and Then the Bigfoot (2018) as Calvin Barr, to shine again as supporting character playing Bradley Cooper's brother Bobby in the multi-nominated Cooper's directorial debut A Star is Born (2018), sharing scenes with Lady Gaga, coming back again to the western in the TV series 1883 (2021) as Shea Brennan.\n\nRobert Francis 'Bobcat' Goldthwait, born May 26, 1962, is an American comedian, writer, producer, director, and star of films and television shows. He is most widely known for his at times screechy voice and scattergun delivery during his standup comedy performances and some film roles.\n\nHe was born in 1962 in Syracuse, New York, the son of Kathleen Ann (Welch), a department store employee, and Thomas Lincoln Goldthwait, a sheet metal worker. His family, of Irish, German, and English descent, was Catholic. He decided on a career as a comedian at an early age and was performing professionally while still in high school at the age of fifteen. He and his classmate, Tom Kenny, performed in a comedy duo, billing themselves as \"Bobcat and Tomcat\". Goldthwait became recognized as a solo stand-up comedian and had three televised concert specials in The 1980s: Bob Goldthwait - Is He Like That All the Time?, An Evening with Bobcat Goldthwait: Share the Warmth (1987) and Meat Bob.\n\nGoldthwait's first major film role was in Police Academy 2 - Jetzt geht's erst richtig los (1985). He reprised the role in the next two films in the series. During the fall of 1993, Goldthwait did stand-up material as an opening act for Nirvana on what would be their final North American tour. He has made several guest appearances on talk shows as well as comedy programs including The Ben Stiller Show (1992). On May 9, 1994, he made a controversial appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992), where, on impulse, he set a couch on fire. This incident was then the basis of the plot for his subsequent appearance on Die Larry Sanders Show (1992).\n\nOne of the most recognizable features of Goldthwait's performances is his voice. Goldthwait has voiced characters on the television series Mäuse an der Macht (1992); The Moxy Show (1995); Auf schlimmer und ewig (1995); Hercules (1998) and Captain Buzz Lightyear (2000). He has also appeared, as himself, hosting the comedy quiz show Bobcat's Big Ass Show (1998). Goldthwait has released two comedy albums: \"Meat Bob\" (1988) on Chrysalis Records and \"I Don't Mean to Insult You, but You Look Like Bobcat Goldthwait\" (23 September, 2003) on Comedy Central Records.\n\nHe made his feature film directorial debut with Clowns - Ihr Lachen bringt den Tod (1991), which he wrote and starred in as well. His film, Windy City Heat (2003), won a Comedia Award for Best Comedy Film at Montreal's Just for Laughs Film Festival in 2004.\n\nBobcat began directing ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live! (2003) in the fall 2004 season. Since joining the show's crew, the ratings went up to 2 million viewers a night, with the numbers rising nearly 50% with the teenage demographic. In May of 2006, he left to pursue his film career as a filmmaker/director but has since returned to the show. Goldthwait's feature, \"Sleeping Dogs Lie\" (formally Stay (2006)), starring Melinda Page Hamilton, was in the 2006 Sundance Film Festival and it was part of the \"Independent Dramatic Features\" competition. \"Sleeping Dogs Lie\" is about a youthful, impulsive sexual encounter which opens the door to a dark comedy about the complexities of honesty. It was also nominated for the Grand Jury Prize in the \"Dramatic Features\" category. \"Sleeping Dogs Lie\" was picked up in a mid-six figure deal for distribution in north America by Roadside Attractions & Samuel Goldwyn Films at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival. A French film company called \"Gaumont\" bought it for the international rights to the film in France. \"Tartan Films\", a UK-based production company, also bought it for international rights in the United Kingdom. The film was released in the US on October 20, 2006.\n\nHe married Ann Luly in 1986 at the age of 24. The couple have two children (now grown), Tasha and Taylor, and divorced in May 1998. At one time, Goldthwait was engaged to his Auf schlimmer und ewig (1995) co-star, Nikki Cox, but the couple split.\n\nCute, bubbly, and adorable actress Carol Speed achieved a considerable amount of cult cinema popularity with her often lively and delightful contributions to a handful of enjoyably down'n'dirty 1970s blaxploitation features.\n\nShe was born Carolyn Stewart on March 14, 1945, in Bakersfield, California. She holds the distinction of being the first black homecoming queen in Santa Clara County and was one of the first black people to receive a scholarship for the American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco. Carol got her start in show business as a back-up singer for Bobbie Gentry at Harrah's club in Reno, Nevada. She made her film debut as a hooker in Polizeirevier Los Angeles-Ost (1972). Speed's most memorable movie roles include sassy prison inmate Mickie in Jack Hill's hilarious babes-behind-bars parody The Big Bird Cage (1972), pimp Max Julien's loyal prostitute girlfriend Lulu in the terrific Straßen zur Hölle (1973), sarcastic rock groupie Janyce in Bummer (1973), club owner Rockne Tarkington's sweet gal pal Leslie in the fun Black Samson (1974) and deaf-mute Sarah in Al Adamson's Dynamite Brothers (1974).\n\nCarol gave an especially inspired and impressive performance as a minister's innocent wife who becomes possessed by the malevolent spirit of an evil demon in William Girdler's immensely entertaining horror flick Abby (1974). She had a recurring part on the daytime soap opera Zeit der Sehnsucht (1965) in the summer of 1970. Moreover, she made a guest appearance on an episode of Sanford and Son (1972), appeared in several TV commercials, and pops up in the made-for-TV films The Girls of Huntington House (1973), Love Hate Love (1971), Tenafly (1973), Getting Away from It All (1972), and The Psychiatrist (1970).\n\nOutside of acting, Carol was also a successful writer (she's the author of the books \"Inside Black Hollywood\" and \"The Georgette Harvey Story\"), singer and songwriter (she sang her own compositions \"I Can Make It\" in \"The Girls of Huntington House\" and \"My Soul Is A Witness\" in \"Abby\"). After taking a regrettably lengthy hiatus from acting following Helden der Nacht (1979) (she was slated to do a small role in Quentin Tarantino's Jackie Brown (1997), but backed out at the last minute), Speed made a welcome comeback with a supporting part in the independent thriller Village Vengeance (2006).\n\nCarol Speed died at age 76 on January 14, 2022 in Muskogee, Oklahoma."
