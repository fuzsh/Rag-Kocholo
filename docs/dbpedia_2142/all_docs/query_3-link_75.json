        "text": "Ben Chapman is new to journalism, but not to writing. Having started writing stories in the first grade, he has always gravitated towards writing, fiction or informative. Ben is interested in all things having to do with music, hoping one day to have a career in the field, whether it's as a professional musician, producer, or even as a music journalist. He hopes to finish his prerequisites at MCC and hopefully transfer to Colombia College and pursue a degree in Audio Arts."
