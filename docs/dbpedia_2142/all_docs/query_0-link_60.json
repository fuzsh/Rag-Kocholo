        "text": "Readers may perhaps detect a mismatch in the advocacy for what is friendly to the reader in a modern version of an old play and the qualities of the Regents series that are here celebrated. The Regents series, while elegant, is determinedly unshowy; though concise, its editions are certainly scholarly rather than popular in temper; and as I mentioned at the start of this essay, their paperback release was clearly not so widely in demand as to preclude their availability in Britain at least on the basis of a discounted price. No doubt the Regents series had its oddities, and as this discussion has sought to show, it was for good or ill finely shaped by the period of its inception. Yet it remains, I suggest, a uniquely pleasing form of presenting Renaissance plays to its readership: a form at once elegant, lucid, and chaste.\n\nBibliography\n\nA. Regents Renaissance Drama Series: Listed by play title, by title page author, and by publication year.\n\nWhere two years are given, the first relates to the publication date in the U.S.A. and the second to the publication date in the U.K. Otherwise (except as stated with regard to No Wit, No Help, Like a Woman’s) the single date applies to publication in both countries. In the U.S.A. the publisher in all cases is the University of Nebraska Press and the place of publication, Lincoln, Nebraska. In the U.K. the publisher in all cases is Edward Arnold and the place of publication London.\n\nRegents plays by play title:\n\nAll Fools, by George Chapman, ed.
