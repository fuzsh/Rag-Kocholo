        "text": "Ben Chapman (He/Him/They) is an activist and archivist born, reared and still living in the Carolinas. A resident of Raleigh, Chapman is a millennial with a passion for history and equality who readily advocates for communities who have lived with the threat of having their civil rights ignored or taken away. During this interview, we learned more about the man behind the mission of justice and equality for all.\n\nL’Monique King: What does activism mean to you?\n\nBen Chapman: I’ve been thinking about that quite a bit lately, tracing the roots of my own activism. I was in Library School during the George Floyd protests. At that time there was a lot of conversation about documenting ‘the now.’ That shaped my professional perspective as well as my personal perspective. Graduate school helped me crystallize these values and the value that I have for transparency and accountability. I studied Archives and Records Management. The Trump Administration was an interesting time to be studying that.\n\nMy activism really just started in 2022 during the Dobbs Leak in particular – it was a criticism of substantive due process rights. It was these four precedents: Griswold v. Connecticut [1965 Supreme Court ruling that a state’s ban on the use of contraceptives violated the right of marital privacy], Loving v. Virginia [1967 case striking down state laws banning marriage between individuals of different races]; Lawerence v. Texas [2003 case invalidating sodomy laws making same-sex sexual activity legal in every state] and Obergefell v. Hodges [2015 Marriage Equality Case recognizing same-sex marriages] – that I was aware of but hadn’t heard of since high school [which served as motivation].\n\nReading this [Dobbs decision], which was overturning Roe v. Wade [1973 Supreme Court decision recognizing that the right to protecting personal privacy and whether or not to continue a pregnancy] but was aiming much further; to undermine the fundamentals of civil rights that made me concerned enough to call each one of my elected representatives. I spoke with my member of the North Carolina General Assembly; specifically Representative Donna White from the North Carolina House of Representatives.\n\nLMK: Yet, everyone isn’t moved to take action. Why were you motivated to have input in making change?\n\nBC: I was one of those people at one period. But I went to my area’s town council meeting and spoke during the comment period. On the night that I went, the agenda had an item of considering a nondiscrimination policy.\n\nI asked them to consider inclusive protections, the policy didn’t contain all the current federal protected classes. So, I encouraged the town council to offer protections to not only the LGBTQ community but also to support the CROWN (“Create a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair”) Act [legislation which prohibits discrimination based on hair style and hair texture]. I went to the council three times in a row culminating in a presentation where at the last meeting I invited ABC news to attend as well – which [they] did.\n\nLMK: Wow! Now let’s talk a little bit about your personal life. Do you have any siblings?\n\nBC: Yes, I have a twin.\n\nLMK: Are you identical?\n\nBC: No, we’re fraternal and we both identify as non-binary.\n\nLMK: How’d that go over with your parents?\n\nBC: We came out to each other first (initially as bisexuals) and then came out to our parents at the same time. My parents were both surprised, but they were not hostile. We knew that they were going to be alright with it. My dad told me a joke to use after, “Here’s what you need to say, I like my women I like my coffee, I much prefer tea.” It meant so much to me that he was able to engage in humor about it and it also put any concerns I had that he’d treat me differently to rest.\n\nLMK: Is there anyone special in your life that you share your home with?\n\nBC: Yes, my partner. I was living alone in Clayton and over the course of two years my rent was increased from $900 to $1400 per month. My partner and I were already dating but the distance between us (me in Clayton and him in Durham) was becoming a bit much. He had a dog, I had cats and they got along. We missed each other when we couldn’t spend time together, so when the lease was up the decision was easy to make. Plus, Oh gosh, he’s a very talented video gamer and far better than me at anything we play. Frustrating but I really admire it.\n\nLMK: When you’re not advocating for others, what do you do for a living?\n\nBC: I work as an archivist at the Johnston County Heritage Center.\n\nLMK: Outside of how you make money, what would you do if no one ever paid you because you love it just that much?\n\nBC: I think, public history and living history potentially. We have an event at the Johnston County Heritage Center called the Ghost walk. It’s held in the Riverside Cemetery in Smithfield. One of my most enriching experiences was portraying a ghost of the son of the congressmen Edward Pou. It was awesome – bringing history to life by using a storytelling component that gave voice to people long gone. I had never done any theater or any type of performing before then.\n\nLMK: Let’s continue to have a little fun. Choose one or the other. Movie or a concert?\n\nBC: Movies.\n\nLMK: Most resonating film for you to date?\n\nBC: The last poignant film I watched was probably Parasite. I went into viewing it with no knowledge of what it was going to be about. It’s a South Korean film about a family trying to work their way into the upper middle class of their society. It was quite compelling.\n\nLMK: Strawberries of bananas?\n\nBC: Strawberries, love strawberries. Here in North Carolina we used to go into the field and pick them ourselves.\n\nLMK: If you enjoy museums, which would you say is your favorite?\n\nBC: Probably the North Carolina Museum of History – because of the richness of the experience. And there’s a museum in Western North Carolina I’d really like to go to. The museum of American House Cats.\n\nLMK: Favorite cartoon character?\n\nBC: Steven Universe. It was a series that my twin introduced me to and it was such a nice depiction of relationships and conflict resolution too. The overarching story as well was entertaining enough to keep my attention.\n\nLMK: Sounds cool. So, what’s your superpower?\n\nBC: Ooooo, my superpower <thoughtful pause> that just stumped me. I don’t know if there’s anything that I could claim to be good enough at to say it’s a superpower. I tend to think of myself as a jack of all trades, someone who has a little bit of experience in many areas and knowledge in a lot of fields.\n\nLMK: Before we close and one a more serious note, any thoughts on the upcoming Presidential election?\n\nBC: At the presidential level it’s not an exaggeration to say that our democracy is at stake. So, while I may have concerns about the current administration and the policies of President Joe Biden, I’m for Biden and Kamala Harris because there isn’t an alternative. That said, I’m far more concerned about local elections. I know some of the most anti-LGBT local elected officials and I’d like to see them get their come-upins.\n\nLMK: Before we go, would you please give a word of advice to our youth?"
