Painted by the talented artist Jan Thomas (1617-1678), this remarkable piece of art captures both the opulence and theatricality of the Baroque era. Prince Dietrichstein's flamboyant attire is adorned with intricate details that showcase his status and wealth. The vibrant colors, luxurious fabrics, and elaborate accessories all contribute to creating a sense of grandeur. His confident gaze suggests a man comfortable in his own skin, unafraid to embrace extravagance. The concept of a Horse-ballet itself is intriguing - it hints at an event where horses were trained to perform choreographed movements alongside dancers or riders. This unique form of entertainment was popular during that time period and served as a display of power and elegance. This painting now resides in the collection of Ambras Castle in Innsbruck, Austria. Its presence there ensures that future generations can appreciate not only Prince Dietrichstein's striking appearance but also gain insight into the cultural practices and artistic styles prevalent during the Baroque period. Jan Thomas' skillful use of oil on canvas brings this historical figure to life once more, reminding us of an era defined by lavishness and artistic expression.\n\nRate this comment thumb_up thumb_down\n\nSAFE SHIPPING\n\n30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
