        "text": "---\n\nSo, who's the next Heir supposed to get married? If we go by age, it should be Joseph-Wenzel, but Leichestein weddings are private affair, so, who would be next one? Elisabeth? That's 8-10 years into the future. I can't cope.\n\nThe next Heir to marry should be Prince Joseph-Wenzel of Liechtenstein. I think in Liechtenstein they usually make official engagement announcements of the main members of the family, despite being the most reserved reigning royal family.\n\nSo, who's the next Heir supposed to get married? If we go by age, it should be Joseph-Wenzel, but Leichestein weddings are private affair, so, who would be next one? Elisabeth? That's 8-10 years into the future. I can't cope.\n\nAge wise it should be Prince Joseph Wenzel of Liechtenstein…\n\nAfter him i belive it’s Elisabeth of Belgium age wise… But that’s likely still 5-10 years away\n\nThough among those who are not heirs there is still a few unmarried born in the 90:s like Prince Sebastien of Luxembourg, and Prince Joachim and Princess Luisa Maria of Belgium.\n\nAnd i’m sure some of Pavlos and M-C’s children will have big weddings given their royal connections\n\nThe Prince Joseph Wenzel of Liechtenstein that attended was the son of Pss Marie of France and Prince Gundakar I believe? He does not look like the son of Prince Alois. He seems to know the groom well.\n\nYes that is him. He will marry in a few weeks in Vienna to Countess Felicitas of Hartig. Guess that was her with him. If i recall right he ws also at Sandhurst. Perhaps he known the Crown Prince from there.\n\nSo far I'm not a fan of either dress of the bride. She is a stunning woman and I'm not sure that the dresses do her any justice, they seem to be wearing her. Her dress from the the henna party was gorgeous. I think my hopes might have been too high.\n\nAgree with you. Best dress in my opinion is the dress from the henna party. First dress of today, great veil but something was very off.. it looked from the front as if she wrapped a bed sheet around her. And I really dislike her bouquet, so small and colourless and that with this rather big dress.\n\nSecond dress, only seen one picture, not too keen on it. But the model is better.\n\nHaving said all this she still managed to look beautiful...she carries herself well.\n\nWatching now the video with the ceremony. Some quick comments.\n\nThe bride is very beautiful, but I don't really understand the wrap in the front part of the dress. The vale is beautiful though.\n\nIs the first time in my life I see a bride with flat heels.\n\nQueen's dress was gorgeous.. but black??? Is it common in Muslim weddings?\n\nThe King was very emotional.\n\nI never realized before how short he is, the Queen is much higher.\n\nAll my wishes to the couple\n\nSent from my SM-A426B using The Royals Community mobile app\n\nThis wedding was a great suprise, so many royal houses and a Tiara event, in Jordan! It mus be several decades there was Tiara event in Jordan! It´s great to see the Prince and Princess of Wales and of course the young heirs, Amalia and Elisabeth! I have to see say its a shame to see \"Just\" Sofia and Juan Carlos, and not Felipe and Letizia or Sofia with Leonor.. Was there any reason why Letizia and Felipe could not attend?\n\nKing Juan Carlos in particular has a close friendship with the Jordanian royal family."
