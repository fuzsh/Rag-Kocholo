        "text": "Embed from Getty Images\n\nHappy Birthday to the Princess of Liechtenstein, who turns 77 today. Born Countess Marie Aglaë Kinsky of Wchinitz and Tettau in Prague in 1940, she spent the first five years of her life on her family’s Castles in Bohemia, until 1945, when the family was given minutes to pack and put into a concentration camp, where her grandfather died. A few months later they were able to leave the camp, and eventually fled to Germany. In 1961, on a visit to Liechtenstein’s capital Vaduz, Countess Marie met Hereditary Prince Hans-Adam, five years her junior, who fell in love with her at first sight. Eventually, she also fell in love with him, and they were married in 1967. Afterwards, the couple lived in Switzerland while he finished university, and returned to Liechtenstein in 1968. The Hereditary Prince and Princess had three sons and one daughter. During the 1980s, they acted as regents of Liechtenstein, eventually succeeding to the Principality in 1989. In 2004, their eldest son, Hereditary Prince Alois, was appointed as regent of Liechtenstein, with Prince Hans Adam and Princess Marie currently supporting their charitable causes rather than undertaking official duties. I wish HSH a very Happy Birthday and Many Happy Returns!\n\nTake a look below at an amazing in-depth look at her life by Luxarazzi:\n\nCountess Marie Kinsky of Wchinitz and Tettau\n\nPrincess Marie of Liechtenstein"
