        "text": "This article analyses parts of the framework that determined the diplomatic mission of Count Philip Kinsky of Wchinitz and Tettau (1700–1749) in London from 1728 to 1736. In 1728, Emperor Charles VI decided to send Count Kinsky to the court of King George II of Great Britain to re-establish diplomatic relations. The aims of Kinsky’s mission to London were challenging, and his inexperience as well as the conflicting political aims of Charles VI and George II complicated matters at first. But over time, the count was able to establish himself and his household in the relevant social and political networks. The study presents the contacts of the imperial diplomat to the opposition, his acceptance into the Royal Society as well as the freemasons, and the use of his position and standing in London society especially during the War of the War of the Polish Succession (1733–1735).\n\nThis article focuses on the diplomatic activity of two ambassadors’s wives from the Kingdom of Bohemia at the court of Madrid between (1653–1674). In that time, the spouse of a diplomat was called “ambassadress”. Throughout the 17th century, the ambassadresses acquired ceremonial, political and social functions. The Countess of Lamberg and the Countess of Pötting were ambassadresses during a special period: during their ‘embassies’, the “Question of the Succession” marked the Hispanic monarchy relations with the Holy Roman Empire; and a Habsburg Queen, Mariana of Austria, was consort (and after regent) of Spain. Also, the second half of the 17th century coincided with the consolidation of the role of the ambassadresses at European courts. Judith Rebecca Wrbna and Maria Sophia von Dietrichstein paved the way for their successor, set precedents and made it easier for subsequent Imperial ambassadresses to access the diplomatic areas of the Spanish court. At the same time, both ambassadresses helped gain acceptance and legitimacy for the political actions of the ambassadors in court circles, established a good relation with the Queen Mariana of Austria, achieved their ceremonial and social duties (visiting), and acted as brokers at court. In short, these two ambassadresses marked a turning point in the diplomatic life of the following Imperial ambassadresses to Spain.\n\nThe paper discusses the changes in the diplomatic relations between Rome and Vienna during the embassy tenure of Count Georg Adam von Martinitz (1696–1700). The series of his conflicts with the Holy See (e.g., the scandal at the Corpus Christi procession, the affairs of the imperial feuds in Italy and finally a poisoning attempt) deteriorated his situation at the Roman Curia. That resulted in his being denied Papal audiences and the recall of Martinitz from Rome. But it should have been anticipated by his relatives in Vienna. Martinitz received another Imperial Court posting, although he was not satisfied with it. Although he inherited most of these conflicts, he was not able to dissolve them; in fact, he made some of them worse. His successor, Count Leopold Joseph von Lamberg, arrived to Rome with the task \" to put water on the fire \". But it was not an easy task, especially on the eve of the War of the Spanish Succession.\n\nThis paper examines the previously unknown diplomatic mission of Hermann Jakob Count Czernin von Chudenitz in Warsaw in 1695. Neither Polish nor Czech nor Austrian historians paid any attention to it. Based on this, however, it is possible to demonstrate perfectly how tense the relations between Emperor Leopold I and the Polish King John III Sobieski, who, at the end of their lives, were officially allies in the Holy League. The author first briefly introduces this mission and then, using it as an example, attempts to show how the travels of the imperial ambassadors of that time were organised and also unveils other additional aspects of the diplomatic service. Above all he reconstructed the court of Count Czernin, who was surrounded by over 80 people, and also located the place of his accommodation in Warsaw and showed which apartment the Count possessed as an ambassador. Finally, he examined the question of the financial costs of this stay, and documented the fact that the ambassador had to pay many expenses from his own pocket, and that this mission had cost him cca. 50,000 guldens. U p till now neither in the Czech nor in the Polish nor in the Austrian historiography has any work in regard to the diplomatic mission of Hermann Jakob Czernin von Chudenitz to Poland in 1695 originated. In the Czech environment this is not surprising, because until recently almost no one there was actually dealing with the diplomacy of the early modern period and this situation has only improved during the last five years by the publication of the results of the systematic research work that was carried 1 This study originated as a part of the solution of the GA ČR's standard project No. 13–12939S entitled Bohemian and Moravian Nobility in the Habsburg Diplomatic Service (1640–1740). At this point I would like to note that the final form of this study originated with the assistance of several friends and colleagues. The results of his research of personal correspondence from the 1690's were kindly provided to me by Petr Maťa from Vienna, for which I thank him very much. I am also grateful to Vítězslav Prchal (for the data obtained from the Viennese archives concerning the funding of Czernin's mission) and to both the reviewers of this article (for the other recommended literature).\n\nThis paper examines the previously unknown diplomatic mission of Hermann Jakob Count Czernin von Chudenitz in Warsaw in 1695.

More precisely, it focuses on interpreters – in Ottoman context the so called \" dragomans \" – of the mid-seventeenth-century Habsburg embassy in Constantinople: Josephus Barbatus, Giovanni Battista Corel and Nicusio Panaiotti. The analysis of their activity as imperial interpreters gives a solid overview of the professional abilities, competences and personal characteristics which were advantageous or disadvantageous for this position; furthermore, it also sheds light upon the various requirements and selection criteria of the imperial government towards interpreters. The paper also reflects investigations concerning the efforts of the Habsburg Court in Vienna in order to create a corps of loyal and competent professional interpreters trained in Constantinople especially for acquiring the necessary skills of Oriental languages in the mentioned period.\n\nThe second half of the 16th century saw a profound change in the scholarship on the ambassador, which took many forms and led to its becoming an important line of thought within early-modern scholarship on ius gentium. Within this context, the French jurist and humanist Pierre Ayrault (1536-1601) occupies a particularly interesting position. Although he wrote no monographs on the ambassador – unlike other jurists of his time – he did devote specific sections of his erudite works \"Decretorum libri\" (later republished as \"Rerum ab omni antiquitate judicatarum Pandectae\") and \"De l’ordre et instruction iudiciaire\" to the subject. These works vividly demonstrate the extent of the change which scholarship on the ambassador was undergoing at the time, particularly in their treatment of diplomatic immunity from criminal prosecution: these are the observations that I intend to focus on in my paper. After a brief outline of the debate on diplomatic immunity from the end of the Middle Ages to the middle of the 16th century, I will concentrate on Ayrault’s discussion of the topic and point to some important changes that occurred in the way in which the figure of the ambassador – his office, his functions, and his prerogatives – was conceived at that time. This analysis may also provide an insight into the origins of the doctrine of the “extraterritoriality” of ambassadors, which was, in fact, first formulated by Ayrault, before its widespread dissemination through the work of Hugo Grotius."
