        "text": "The recently restored altars in the Parish Church of St. Nicolaus in Domaniža as well as other unrestored parts provide a notion of the nature of authentic, almost uniquely well-preserved, complex furnishings of the early baroque sacral space in Hungary. In the heritage fund of historic Hungary, the wooden retables standing close to the wall with fixed or closable wings represent the most demanding complex realisations of the early baroque period. In spite of that, they are described without any continuity to earlier production centres or distinctive workshop circles as a phenomenon created in the spiritual relation to the intellectual milieu supported by a narrow class of the domestic aristocracy. Commonly according to the preferences of the ordering parties, the predominantly anonymous creators of the pain­ ting compositions of the integrated panel paintings and of the richly carved ornamental motifs' decorations of the architecturally markedly segmented wholes were frequently inspired by graphic templates. Behind the individual life paths of the Hungarian ordering parties, one can clearly see an effort to meet the expectations resulting from slowly advancing social conventions. While enforcing their interests, the elites who represented different social roles were choosing the strategies of prestige promotion and propaganda from topical celebration to long-term memory created through individual image of stereotypical notions which led to a homogenous manifestation of self-promotion. Besi­des spontaneous and conscious adoption of models of Hungarian power and spiritual elite, they consciously strived to formally interpret this process and adapt it into the notions of their own and social mission.\n\nThe overview study summarises in an updated context the findings of a long-term research into sepulchral sculpture in Moravia and Czech Silesia, which dealt primarily with whole-figure sepulchral monuments, ranging from examples dependent on fading Central European late Gothic tradition, through examples gradually influenced by early Renaissance italianising elements up to such forms that were marked by Italian and Nordic Mannerism. Based on a comprehensive regional and broader Central European style-critical comparison, applying the criteria of contemporary artistic influences, individual creative approach, craftsmanship routine and other indicia important for a work to be done, the study presents the efforts to incorporate works into circles given by a specific author or workshops, or to highlight the provenience ties of solitary works. The study shows that despite the enormous loss of sepulchral monuments that have occurred in the past, Moravia and Czech Silesia excel in its nume...\n\nIn the wider phenomenon of the reception and readaptation of aristocratic architectural heritage in post-revolutionary Europe, the repurposing of former aristocratic palaces in Venice after the Fall of the Serenissima in 1797 constitutes a preeminent example. The paper takes as a case study Ca’ Rezzonico, one of the most splendid palaces along the Grand Canal, which has housed, since 1936, the illustrious Museum of 18th-century Venice (Museo del Settecento veneziano). After the Rezzonico family died out in 1810, the palace was gradually stripped of its art historical treasures and has served the most diverse purposes. From being the seat of the Austrian Tobacco Administration to housing dealers’ galleries, from hosting the ateliers of stage designers and international painters to being the home of renowned intellectuals and aesthetes, Ca’ Rezzonico’s rooms and walls have witnessed the profound changes in art, taste, and culture that rang through Europe during the long 19th century. The paper offers a comprehensive reconstruction of the palace’s 19th-century history, drawing from both published and unpublished sources.\n\nThis is an outline of a paper that I am currently writing, to be published next year by the Malbork Castle Museum Press. In it, I am looking at the role played by church officials in Prussia as patrons of art, especially the so-called Beautiful Style type of stone sculptures. It looks at the presence of bishops and church officials from all four bishoprics of Prussia in Prague and the Kingdom of Bohemia from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century, and will also provide an analysis of the iconography and significance of known works of stone sculpture in medieval Prussia. I am especially open to comments and suggestions."
