        "text": "Queen Sirikit’s Ruby Floral Bandeau\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\nQueen Sirikit of Thailand is the owner of a truly incredible collection of jewels. Today, we’re taking a closer look at one of her more modern pieces: her ruby floral bandeau.\n\nNationaal Archief/Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe tiara, as the name suggests, is a bandeau of stylized diamond flowers. The center of the tiara features a large, blossoming element, set with a central ruby. Many sources suggest that this central stone is interchangeable, which would certainly make sense design-wise.\n\nFotografia Felici/Alamy\n\nThe bandeau was one of Sirikit’s glittering companions during the lengthy foreign tour she undertook with King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 1960. Above, she wears the tiara with a black lace veil and pearls for an audience with Pope John XXIII at the Vatican.\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\nIn Belgium, she wore the tiara for a grand state banquet hosted by King Baudouin, who had recently announced his engagement to Fabiola de Mora y Aragon.\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\nHere’s a closer look at Sirikit’s fantastic jewels and gown for the banquet. She paired the tiara with diamond earrings and a diamond riviere with a glittering pendant. An elaborate brooch with an avian theme secured her sash, and she stacked a pair of diamond bracelets on her right wrist.\n\nNationaal Archief/Wikimedia Commons\n\nShe also wore the tiara for a gala concert in the Netherlands. You’ll actually spot two tiaras in this photograph: Sirikit wore the bandeau on her head and the grand Thai Fringe Tiara as a necklace.\n\nThe Daily Diadem: Princess Marie’s Cabochon Tiara\n\nAlbert Nieboer/DPA Picture Alliance/Alamy\n\nMarie of Orleans, wife of Prince Gundakar of Liechtenstein, wears a tiara set with green cabochons — perhaps jade? — at a reception following the wedding of Leka of Albania, October 2016; the tiara has been in Princess Marie’s collection for several years"
