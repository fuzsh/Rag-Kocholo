        "text": "FREE SHIPPING - WORLDWIDE!\n\nYes that is correct the price you see is the price you pay. There are no hidden fees. Shipping, insurance and all other costs are included and you will not be asked to pay any further fees. (Please note there may be some extra fees if major revisions are required to your painting which DIFFER from your initial instructions and/or photos sent to us*** but these cases are the exception.)\n\nWhen packages are delivered damaged we'll need you to inform the courier (UPS) at your end, so they can process the complaint and take photos of the damage and send the photos to us. But, as far as your painting is concerned, if it was damaged beyond repair or lost in transit (both rare occurrences, thankfully), we will immediately dispatch a replacement (or paint a new one for you if it was not one we had in stock).\n\nLifetime Warranty\n\nOcean's Bridge provides a full warranty covering manufacturing and material defects for paintings and prints purchased from our website. The warranty covers damage for normal use. Damage caused by incidents such as accidents or inappropriate use are not covered.\n\nDepending on the degree of damage to the warranted painting, it will either be repaired or replaced. This warranty service is provided free of charge."
