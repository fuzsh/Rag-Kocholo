        "text": "I'm curious about why the wedding of this particular prince from a cadet branch of the princely house of Liechtenstein, which includes dozens of members, is receiving so much attention compared to most Liechtenstein princes and princesses. Is it because of his Orléans mother?\n\nJohann-Wenzel has been seen more than the sovereign Prince’s grandchildren. Also the fact that he is related to the Orleans family. His wedding is the most recent since the weddings of Margaretha and Nikolaus of Liechtenstein’s children. Plus he’s the only member of his generation married to an aristocrat from an old Czech family. He’s well-connected given that he was invited to the Jordanian royal wedding of the CP. He’s the latest Prince of Liechtenstein to be married in a while.\n\nJohann-Wenzel has been seen more than the sovereign Prince’s grandchildren.

He’s the latest Prince of Liechtenstein to be married in a while.\n\nHim being 'well-connected' (other than his family connections) is due to him attending Sandhurst at the same time as both prince Sebastien and crown prince Hussein. So, he is not necessarily well-connected in general but it seems there is a lasting friendship between the three princes that attended Sandhurst together.\n\nno bridal tiara today\n\nA born aristocrat bride minus a tiara at her wedding isn't unheard of(Caroline of Monaco and Astrid of Belgium didn't wear one)but it's rather disappointing just the same.\n\nNot a fan of the bridal gown, but her hairstyle is superb and she is a natural beauty.\n\nHim being 'well-connected' (other than his family connections) is due to him attending Sandhurst at the same time as both prince Sebastien and crown prince Hussein. So, he is not necessarily well-connected in general but it seems there is a lasting friendship between the three princes that attended Sandhurst together.\n\nHe is related to many European aristocratic families, from the Liechtensteins, to the d'Orleans, to the Württembergs. I used to follow some of his friends on Facebook years ago and he was quite popular and well known among many other German and Austrian aristocrats. It is obvious that his marriage generated some interest.\n\nHonestly I was expecting to see more people within that circle today.\n\nHe is related to many European aristocratic families, from the Liechtensteins, to the d'Orleans, to the Württembergs.

It is obvious that his marriage generated some interest.\n\nHonestly I was expecting to see more people within that circle today.\n\nTrue (which is why I referenced his family connections), however, him attending the wedding of crown prince Hussein of Jordan has nothing to do with him being well-connected (or popular) in the European royal and noble circles but to their shared time at Sandhurst.\n\nHe’s the latest Prince of Liechtenstein to be married in a while.\n\nThe last marriage the one of Prince Joseph Emanuel was not very long ago. Only a bit more then a year. But then it was not held in Europe.\n\nA born aristocrat bride minus a tiara at her wedding isn't unheard of(Caroline of Monaco and Astrid of Belgium didn't wear one)but it's rather disappointing just the same.\n\nYes a pity that the bride didn't wear a tiara. But most likely there is no one to which she has access. The groom mother has worn a small bandeau with turqioses a few times. And it could well be that her Family doesn't have a tiara.\n\nI love how Princess Sophie of Liechtenstein was casually carrying around a black mini Kelly.\n\nShe shows up with really expensive bags just to remind to everyone how rich her family-in-law is.\n\nhttps://robinutrecht.photoshelter.com/index/G000034m5Z_qh8Qk/I0000WsHPmkhxIyM\n\nI don’t think so, Sophie isn’t a show off from what I’ve seen. For all we know, it could be fake. (Maybe I should take this to the fashion thread). She doesn’t dress trendy or mainstream like some other royals do.\n\nSirGyamfi1 had probably in mind his parents' marriage.\n\nIt has been quite a while (not too long) since the marriage of Prince Josef-Emanuel and Claudia and it is the most recent dynastic match of a Prince or Liechtenstein since Prince Stefan of Liechtenstein in 1988. Yes, it hasn’t been too long, but at the same time because the family are fairly private it seems it has been a while.\n\nI don’t think so, Sophie isn’t a show off from what I’ve seen. For all we know, it could be fake. (Maybe I should take this to the fashion thread). She doesn’t dress trendy or mainstream like some other royals do.\n\nHer husband is basically a billionaire...I don't think her Kelly is fake. She can afford it 100%.\n\nSometimes I feel like she dresses modestly to not get that much attention.\n\nIt has been quite a while (not too long) since the marriage of Prince Josef-Emanuel and Claudia and it is the most recent dynastic match of a Prince or Liechtenstein since Prince Stefan of Liechtenstein in 1988. Yes, it hasn’t been too long, but at the same time because the family are fairly private it seems it has been a while.\n\nSo the marriages of Hereditary Prince Alois to a Duchess in Bavaria and his brother to a Countess Kalnoky are not dynastic. There have been other marriages. For example in 2021 Prince Konrad got married to a Comtesse de Biolley\n\nSo the marriages of Hereditary Prince Alois to a Duchess in Bavaria and his brother to a Countess Kalnoky are not dynastic.
