        "text": "by Susan Flantzer\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2022\n\nCountess Leopoldine von Sternberg was the wife of Franz Josef I, who reigned as Prince of Liechtenstein from 1772 – 1781. She was a member of an influential discussion group called the Salon of the Five Princesses that acted as the political advisers of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor. Marie Leopoldine Walburga Eva was born in Vienna, Austria on December 11, 1733. She was the second of the six children and the eldest of the four daughters of Count Franz Philipp von Sternberg (1708 – 1786 – link in German) and Eleonore Marie Leopoldine von Starhemberg (1712 – 1800).\n\nLeopoldine had five siblings:\n\nCount Franz Philipp Christian von Sternberg (1732 – 1811), married Countess Augusta Leopolda von Manderscheid-Blankenheim, had sixteen children\n\nCountess Maria Josepha von Sternberg (1735 – 1803), married Prince Karl Borromäus Egon von Fürstenberg, had three children\n\nCount Thomas Gundakar von Sternberg (1737 – 1802), unmarried\n\nCountess Sophie von Sternberg (1738 – 1803), married Count Johann Vinzenz von Waldstein, had three children\n\nCountess Maria Carolina von Sternberg (1741 – 1771), married Major General Johann Nepomuk von Lützow\n\nLeopoldine’s father Count Franz Philipp von Sternberg came from an important Bohemian noble family and served in several diplomatic roles in the Holy Roman Empire. From 1745 – 1748, he was the ambassador to the Reichstag (parliament) in the Free Imperial City of Regensburg. For fourteen years, from 1749 – 1763, Count Franz Philipp was the Austrian ambassador to both the Polish royal court and the Saxony electoral court. For his services to the Holy Roman Empire, he received the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1763. From 1765 to 1780, Count Franz Philipp served as Hofmeister, the highest office in the court of the formidable Empress Maria Theresa.\n\nLeopoldine’s mother Countess Eleonore Marie Leopoldine von Starhemberg was the daughter of Count Konrad Sigismund von Starhemberg who also served the Habsburgs as the imperial ambassador to the Reichstag in Regensburg and the imperial ambassador to Great Britain. Count Konrad Sigismund had married Princess Maria Leopoldina of Löwenstein-Wertheim (1689–1763) and the marriage brought him many family ties to German royal and noble families.\n\nBecause of the service to the Habsburgs of Leopoldine’s father and maternal grandfather, it should be no surprise that she made an excellent marriage. On July 6, 1750, she married Prince Franz Josef of Liechtenstein, the eldest of the thirteen children of Prince Emanuel of Liechtenstein and Countess Maria Anna Antonia of Dietrichstein-Weichselstädt, Baroness of Hollenburg and Finkenstein.\n\nLeopoldine and Franz Josef had eight children:\n\nPrince Josef Franz of Liechtenstein (1752 – 1754), died in childhood\n\nPrincess Leopoldina of Liechtenstein (1754 – 1823), married Karl Emanuel, Landgrave of Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg, had one son\n\nPrincess Maria Antonia of Liechtenstein (1756 – 1821), became a nun\n\nPrince Franz de Paula Josefof Liechtenstein (1758 – 1760), died in childhood\n\nAlois I, Prince of Liechtenstein (1759 – 1805), married Karoline von Manderscheid-Blankenheim, no children\n\nJohann I Josef, Prince of Liechtenstein (1760 – 1836), married Landgravine Josepha of Fürstenberg-Weitra, had fourteen children\n\nPrince Philipp Josef of Liechtenstein (1762 – 1802), unmarried\n\nPrincess Maria Josefa of Liechtenstein (1768 – 1845), married Nikolaus 7th Prince Esterházy von Galántha, had two children\n\nFranz Josef’s father was the younger brother of Joseph Wenzel I, Prince of Liechtenstein who reigned from 1712 – 1718, was Regent from 1732 – 1745, and then reigned again from 1748 until his death in 1772. Joseph Wenzel had five children, including three sons, and all five died in early childhood. Noting that his nephew Franz Josef might be a future Sovereign Prince of Liechtenstein, Joseph Wenzel took him under his wing. Like Leopoldine’s father and grandfather, her husband participated in a number of diplomatic missions on behalf of the Holy Roman Empire. On February 10, 1772, Franz Josef’s uncle Josef Wenzel, Prince of Liechtenstein died with no surviving sons. Because he was the nearest male relative, Franz Josef succeeded his uncle as the Sovereign Prince of Liechtenstein.\n\nFrom 1768 – 1790, Princess Eleonore of Liechtenstein (1745 – 1812) who was married to Prince Franz Josef’s brother Prince Karl Borromeo of Liechtenstein, held a discussion group called the Salon of the Five Princesses that was influential in the affairs of state for over twenty years. Leopoldine was a member of the group along with Eleonore’s half-sister Maria Leopoldine, Countess von Kaunitz-Rietberg (1741- 1795) Princess Maria Josepha von Clary und Aldringen (1728 – 1801), Princess Maria Sidonia Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1729 – 1815). Count Franz Moritz von Lacy (1725 -1801), an Austrian Field Marshal and Chief Treasurer Prince Franz Xaver Wolfgang von Orsini-Rosenberg (1723 -1796) frequently attended the group’s meetings. The discussion group acted as the political advisers of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, who met with the group to discuss state affairs once a week and then four times a week after 1780. The group lost its influence upon Joseph II’s death in 1790.\n\nLeopoldine’s sons Aloys I, Prince of Liechtenstein and Johann I Josef, Prince of Liechtenstein; Credit- Wikipedia\n\nFranz Josef I, Prince of Liechtenstein, died August 18, 1781, aged 54, in Metz, France. He was buried in the Old Crypt at Chuch of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary in Vranov, Moravia, now in the Czech Republic. After her husband’s death, Leopoldine lived with her youngest daughter Maria Josefa in Vienna, Austria. Leopoldine saw two of her sons, Aloys I and Johann I Josef, become the Sovereign Prince of Liechtenstein. Leopoldine survived her husband by twenty-eight years, dying at the age of 75 on June 27, 1809, in Valtice, Moravia, now in the Czech Republic. She was buried at St. Andrew’s Church in Vienna-Hütteldorf, Austria.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
