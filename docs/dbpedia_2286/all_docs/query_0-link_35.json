        "text": "Prince Johann-Wenzel of Liechtenstein has married his blushing bride, Countess Felicitas von Hartig, in a lavish religious ceremony in Vienna.\n\nThe son of Princess Marie of Liechtenstein and Prince Gundakar of Liechtenstein, 30, and the daughter of Count Lukas von Hartig and Claudia Toperczer, 29, were reportedly married in April at a civil service in Vaduz, Liechtenstein’s capital.\n\nBut today, the couple went all out for their religious ceremony, which took place in Austria’s capital, where they both live and work.\n\nGuests at the glamorous occasion included Prince Sébastien of Luxembourg and Heinrich Donatus, Hereditary Prince of Schaumburg-Lippe.\n\nFor the occasion, the bride, who works for the Austrian Ministry of the Interior, is said to have worn a tailor-made ensemble from the Spanish brand Jesus Peiro.\n\nThe ruffled dress featured a billowing floor-length skirt, bold shoulder detailing, and a modest neckline.\n\nTo add some sparkle to her white ensemble, the radiant bride opted for a sleek silver necklace and dainty diamond earrings to complete her elegant look.\n\nCountess Felicitas kept her blonde locks in loose curls and opted for a stylish half-up and half-down hairstyle, finished off with a beautiful floral headpiece nestled in her locks.\n\nThe bride held a bouquet of vibrant red and white flowers, matching her husband’s red vest.\n\nHer fashionable husband – who works alongside his father in the family business – also opted for a light blue tie with his suit and crisp white shirt.\n\nAfter the service, the couple left the church to a cheering crowd. They stopped to share a sweet kiss outside.\n\nThe couple – who first met at a party in 2012, before reuniting five years later – got engaged on August 25, 2022 during a “wonderful” vacation in Sicily, according to Euro history.\n\nCountess Felicitas – who has also lived in Paris and Lisbon – studied law in Vienna, Austria, before also earning a degree in art history.\n\nMeanwhile, Prince Johann-Wenzel studied politics and economics in Montreal, Canada, followed by a year at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK.\n\nFounded more than 300 years ago, the Princely House of Liechtenstein gives its name to the small European nation.\n\nAll living members are descendants of its founder, Prince Johann I, who was admitted to the Confederation of the Rhine by Napoleon in 1806, in a move that laid the foundations for sovereignty.\n\nThe sovereignty issue remains important to the nation, which has a population of just 39,039 and measures just 15 miles from east to west.\n\nThe reigning Prince Hans-Adam II is particularly committed to the independent foreign policy of Liechtenstein. Under his leadership, Liechtenstein joined the United Nations (UNO) in 1990 and the European Economic Area (EEA) in 1995.\n\nHe has three sons and a daughter. The eldest, Prince Alois, is heir to the Liechtenstein throne."
