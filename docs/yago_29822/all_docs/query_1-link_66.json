        "text": "It can be said that Al lived the life of his choosing with the love of ranching, the community of Forsyth, his friends, his advocations, and, of course, his family. With his passing on February 16th (Age 94 plus one day), he left a great legacy for us to hold and carry for the benefit of family and the well-being of others. Al was born February 15, 1930, to A. G. Lee Sr. and AlfredaTips in Sweetwater, Texas where he grew through boyhood and high school. These were the The Great Depression years and leading through World War II which brought influence. The life in Texas was town-living while the family did cotton and wheat farming nearby. His father then was also a postmaster, and a merchant of farm machinery. Like his father, Al was a good storyteller,and ability to describe in color something of substance, or so called “take-away for thought”.\n\nAt the age of 14, Al earned Eagle Scout in 1944. Al came to Montana in 1948 after completing high school in 1947 (student council 1946 and 1947) and a year of college his freshman year at Texas Tech, Lubbock, TX, and when the family acquired Lee Ranch (in partnership with the Armor family, a.k.a. Porcupine Ranch). Upon transferring college to Montana State College (MSU) at Bozeman, Al worked intermittently at the ranch. Ranching then was open country before pasture fences for livestock kept cowboys gathering cattle from large spansions. It’s been said, Al and brother Toppy were the last to do open range roundups. After a couple years at MSC, Al enlisted in the Air Force in 1950 with the onset of the Korean War. Al would say the physical requirements of the Army or Marines would have killed him if he was drafted otherwise.\n\nAl was an electronic instructor for armaments on B-36 Stratofortress aircraft. One antidote to his military service, because Al was an Eagle Scout, the Air Force selected him as a barracks chief (leadership) which jumped him to a corporal (never was a private). The Air Force returned him to college where he then met Sharon Elliott (a social gathering of Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity and Alpha Omicron Pi sorority). Al still needed to complete about six months with the Air Force for full term. Al and Sharon corresponded during this time. It was said that Al told Sharon to “date” during his continued stint because he was sure going to “date” as well while away. Al was released from the Air Force three months early from full obligation. He returned to MSC where Sharon also completed her bachelor degree, they engaged, and married on October 31, 1954.\n\nAl and Sharon began a life of ranching and operating steer yearlings. He and Sharon lived for a year at the Colstrip ranch and then shortly moved to Forsyth where they rented an upstairs apartment at 390 N. 12th Ave. Son, Brian was born in 1955. They moved again within a half block to rent a house owned by Dr. Hayward at 1211 Park Street. Robert (Bob) was born in. It was settled that Al and Sharon enjoyed the amenities of living in town, and close proximity of friends and schools to raise a family. They had a modular style (kit house) built in 1960 to which they continued to live today. Travis was born 1963.\n\nIn the early 1960’s, Al was a director, secretary/treasurer for the Montana Cattlemens Association. During the late 1950’s and early 1960’s, Al and Sharon practiced archery and competed at area field shoots with recurve bows. Al was a charter member of the local Pronghorn Bowhunters. He was also most proud to be a scoutmaster for about ten years in the 1960’s and forward. In addition to many hiking/camping trips, and summer camps, Al achieved a bunch of Eagle Scouts. During the Vietnam War, Al was chairman of the local draft board. As a long time hunter and target shooter, Al was a long-time director within the Forsyth Rifle and Pistol Club. Al received citations from the Montana Fish Wildlife Parks for 55 years being a Hunters Safety instructor. In addition to making several muzzle-loaded rifles, Al was a crack-shot with these rifles and in the 1980’s he conducted muzzleloader competition for the Big Sky State Games, Al was an avid reloader for all his ammunition of rifles and pistols. In this endeavor, “seriousness, concentration, and safety” were strictly adhered to. In 1990, a movie called Quigley Down Under was seen by Al and one of his friends, Ernie Cornett which brought about the idea of collecting members of the Forsyth Rifle & Pistol Club for a local match using these large caliber, single shot buffalo rifles. Each year, it kept growing, and today around 600 shooters around the U.S. and some internationally come to Forsyth over Father’s Day weekend. At the beginning of each annual rifle match, Al had a distinction of presenting the “shooter information”. He always began by exclaiming, “Thar ain’t any rules! (and then more subtly saying) But we do have a few procedures.”. First and foremost, everyone is a gun safety range officer. Imagine that coming from a guy who was a hunters safety instructor for 55 years! Al was a director of this rifle match for 19 years.\n\nIn 2002, Al received National Rifle Association”s (NRA) annual Public Service Award for many years of advocating gun safety, shooting sports, and hunting. In 2017, Senator Steve Daines awarded Al with Montanan of the Week, a recognition presented on the Congressional Senate floor.\n\nAl was a firm and steadfast believer in the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and that he meant every word without apology or waiver. One time, he was interviewed by a journalist which appeared to be a foreign publication. Al was asked about some stance on “gun control”. His unequivocal reply was, “Mister, a man with a gun is a citizen, a man without a gun is a subject”.\n\nAl was a proud and worthy Mason of the local Hiram Lodge #52 to which he served as Master in 1962 and again 2002 (40 years apart). He loved this fraternity of upstanding, good men, and as it still is today.\n\nAl grew up with two siblings, Eleanor (Marion) Harris of Texas and Toppy (Mariellen) Lee of Forsyth MT. His nephews and nieces: Tom (Anna Kay) Harris and Tim (Becky) Harris with their families of Texas. Laura (Robert Vermandel) Lee, Bruce Lee, Ellen Coker and their families. Grandchildren: Britta Shirtliff, Jack (Danielle) Lee, Lisa Lee along with great grandchildren, Owen, Colin, Henry, Evelyn, and Eleanor. Grandchildren: Scott Lee and Kristina Lee. Grandchild: Edan Lee\n\nA memorial service will be held on Friday, May 17th, 2:00pm, at Stevenson & Sons, Forsyth, MT to honor Al and Sharon."
