        "text": "I’m fulfilling requests here and clearing space off the DVR. Last summer I saw and reviewed the 1950 King Solomon’s Mines, which was a favorite of my late mother. It was a tale I enjoyed; long before that I saw the cheesy movie of the same name from the 80’s which I didn’t enjoy as much. More than one person brought this up as a movie to see; in addition, the film starring the great Black entertainer Paul Robeson was another draw, so when this played on TCM a few weeks ago, it was recorded. By my standards of waiting months to year to watch something I’m in possession of or recorded… I wasted nary a minute.\n\nFrom other reviews,…\n\nI love the book. As a reader of Weird Tales, Arthur Conan Doyle, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Robert E. Howard, all of their lost world adventure tales start with H. Rider Haggard's King Solomon's Mines from 1885. This is the best adaptation. Almost everything I've read says no, the 1950 version was the best of the five or so done, which is madness!, and here's why: the journey from book to movie to the next movie to the next is a slow march of whitewashing. The book has one of the white adventurers begin a relationship with one of the tribeswomen. Needless to say this never had a chance of getting into the movies. Umbopa, the African Prince disguised as a…\n\nApparently, this has a reputation as the film version which hews most closely to H. Rider Haggard's Victorian adventure novel, but I don't recall the book featuring a stereotypical \"Oirish\" father and daughter comedy-reflief/romance interest, and I'm quite sure that the character of Umbopa never broke into anachronistic negro spirituals and jazz numbers while climbing the Breasts of Sheba.\n\nDespite those deviations from the sacred text, this does offer a very satisfying low-key performance by Sir Cedric Hardwicke as Allan Quatermain which is a welcome departure from later adaptations that played the fictional African hunter as a variation on Indiana Jones. The character of Gagool, the ancient, murderous witch doctor hag, excised from subsequent versions is present also, although she's…\n\n\"You know, O'Brien, there's only one kind of man that is useless to argue with.\"\n\n\"And that is?\"\n\n\"A fool!\"\n\nIn 1881's South Africa, Patrick 'Patsy' O'Brien (Arthur Sinclair) and his daughter Kathy (Anna Lee) persuade hunter Allain Quartermain (Cedric Hardwicke) to let them accompany him. On their way, the come across a fortune hunter who claims to have found the fabled diamond mines of King Solomon ...\n\nKing Solomon’s Mines is an adventure film directed by Robert Stevenson, based on the novel of the same name by Henry Rider Haggard, although for some reason, the protagonist's name has been slightly changed. This is the second feature film adaptation of the novel, after a lost silent version from 1919.\n\nThe…\n\nI bet most film buffs prefer MGM’s 1950 adaptation of H. Rider Haggard’s classic adventure novel, with its pioneering on-location filmmaking (in Technicolor), but this earlier Gaumont British production may hold up better in the 21st century. Most of the credit for that goes to the casting of the great Paul Robeson as a dispossessed prince who uses a group of British explorers to reclaim his throne. In fact, Robeson, who was disappointed with the way his earlier film Sanders Of The River turned out, almost single-handedly transforms it into a deconstruction of the pro-Empire films being made at the time. The scenes where he faces off with “white hunter” Allan Quartermain (Cedric Hardwicke), clearly caught off guard by a…"
