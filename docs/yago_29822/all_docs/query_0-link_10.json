        "text": "The actor Anna Lee, who has died aged 91 of pneumonia, brought her delicate looks and soft, lilting English accent to eight John Ford films, mostly in supporting roles. She was also a leading lady in a fair number of prestigious British and Hollywood movies, and became a fixture in the US television soap opera General Hospital, as the wealthy matriarch Lila Quartermaine.\n\nA year after she took the part in 1978, Lee was paralysed from the waist down following a car accident, and performed the role gracefully in a wheelchair until last year.\n\nLee was born Joan Boniface Winnifrith in the village of Ightham, Kent, where her father was rector of St Peter's church. At 17, she went to study with Elsie Fogarty at the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art in London. In 1935, after some stage experience, she was signed, aged 22, by Gaumont British, and appeared in more than a dozen films during the next four years.\n\nAmong these were First A Girl (1935), in which Lee, as a princess, suspects that a female impersonator (Jessie Matthews) is, in fact, a woman, and The Passing Of The Third Floor Back (1935), in which she was one of the more sympathetic tenants of a London boarding house.\n\nIn 1936, she starred in the first of four films directed by Robert Stevenson, whom she married that same year. This was The Man Who Changed His Mind, in which Boris Karloff, as a jealous doctor in love with Lee, his laboratory colleague, decides to switch brains with his rival, John Loder. Loder and Lee, this time playing a spirited Irish lass, were lovers again in Stevenson's King Solomon's Mines (1937).\n\nWhen the second world war broke out, Lee and Stevenson, who was a pacifist, moved to Hollywood, where they both almost immediately got work, Stevenson directing Tom Brown's Schooldays, and Lee playing Marlene Dietrich's rival for seaman John Wayne's affections in Seven Sinners (both 1940). Lee was to co-star with Wayne in Flying Tigers (1942), and would appear with him again in Ford's Fort Apache (1948), in which she took pubescent Shirley Temple under her wing, The Horse Soldiers (1959) and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962).\n\nHer first film for Ford was How Green Was My Valley (1941) as Bronwyn, the wife of one of the Morgan brothers, first seen by young Huw (Roddy McDowell) walking down steps with a double basket by her hip and a pretty bonnet on her head. Before that, she played the title role in My Life With Caroline (1939), opposite Ronald Colman, another star with a mellifluous English voice.\n\nDuring the second world war, Lee entertained allied troops in Africa, Iran and Sicily. Then, under special orders from General Patton (who made her an honorary private in the US sixth army), she spent several months visiting field hospitals throughout the Mediterranean.\n\nIn 1943, she made two films to boost the war effort, The Commandos Strike At Dawn, about the Norwegian resistance, and Fritz Lang's Hangmen Also Die, in which she played a Czech woman giving refuge to the assassin of Reinhard Heydrich, the Nazi governor of Bohemia and Moravia, in an apocryphal account of the incident co-written by Bertolt Brecht.\n\nIn 1950, after divorcing Stevenson, Lee moved to New York, where, for four years, she played in the live, weekly television series, A Date With Judy. She returned to films in 1957, appearing as Jack Hawkins' wife in Ford's Gideon Of Scotland Yard, beautifully admonishing her detective husband for forgetting to bring home some salmon after a hectic day chasing crooks. She continued to bring grace to small film roles, such as a nun in The Sound Of Music (1965), and a missionary in 1930s China in Seven Women (1966), Ford's final film.\n\nIn 1970, Lee became the seventh (and last) wife of screenwriter, poet and prolific novelist Robert Nathan, who died in 1985. For many years, she chaired the Royal Oak Foundation of California, an affiliate of the National Trust, and, in 1982, she was awarded the MBE. She is survived by two sons and two daughters: one daughter by her marriage to Robert Stevenson and the other children by her second marriage to George Stafford."
