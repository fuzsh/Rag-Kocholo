        "text": "Lila Quartermaine came to Port Charles with the rest of her family in 1978 when Alan decided to stay at General Hospital and bought a house in town. In 1983, Lila's first husband Crane Tolliver pays her a visit. He has proof that his and Lila's divorce was not legal, and therefore her marriage to Edward is illegal and all the Quartermaines are illegitimate. He teams up with Susan Moore, Lila's son Alan's former mistress (and Jason's mother), to blackmail the Quartermaines. Susan backs out, and Crane kills her. Crane himself dies shortly after. Lila legally marries Edward in 1983.\n\nIn 1986, Alan's wife Monica and her lover Sean Donely bankrupt the Quartermaines and Monica throws all of them out of the Quartermaine Mansion, of which she is the owner. The family moves in above Kelly's Diner, but Lila does little complaining. She founds her own business, called Pickle-Lila, which is a delicious relish that sweeps the country. This venture puts the Quartermaines back in the black.\n\nIn 1989, When Edward disappeared into the Bermuda Triangle and was thought to be dead; Lila did not appear to be fazed as she preferred conversing with his portrait, which actually talked back to her.\n\nIn February 1990, Lila takes a bad spill and is paralyzed during renovations at the Quartermaine Mansion. She opts not to have surgery, and therefore uses a motorized wheelchair for the remainder of her life.\n\nLila was reunited with Edward in 1991, when their daughter Tracy discovered him playing beach bum in the Bahamas. In 1993, Lila took on a personal assistant, Brenda Barrett. When the teenager's sister, Lila's grandson Ned Quartermaine's lover Julia, left Port Charles, Lila invited Brenda to live with them. In 1996, When Lila's grandson Jason Quartermaine was stricken with permanent amnesia after a car crash. Lila reached out and Jason only bonded with his grandmother and sister Emily. Jason later wanting to distance himself from the family, takes the name \"Jason Morgan\" as a tribute to her.\n\nNed Quartermaine asked Felicia Jones to write Lila's Memoirs. Lila told Felicia about love letters Edward had sent her during World War II. Lila had given them to her cousin for safekeeping. In the process of writing Lila's memoirs, Luke Spencer and Felicia uncovered a family secret. They found out that Edward had killed Lila's fianc√© Elliot Thompson and married her instead. Lila, however, revealed the truth. She said that Elliot had forced himself on her after discovering that Edward had been sending her love letters he signed as Elliot. So, Lila had hit him over the head with a fireplace poker, killing him. Luke and Felicia agreed to keep the truth a secret.\n\nTracy's 2003 return to Port Charles delighted Lila, that is until Tracy revealed that Skye was not really a Quartermaine. Disappointed, Lila kicked Tracy out of the mansion. She returned not long after with her teenaged son Dillon Quartermaine in tow.\n\n2004 saw many changes to the Quartermaine family. The Port Charles Hotel, which the family had owned for many years, caught fire and burned to the ground trapping Edward, Alan, Monica, Tracy, Jason, Emily, Skye, and Dillon inside. The whole situation caused Edward to have a near fatal heart attack. Ned and Reginald were left to try and keep Lila away from the television, worried that the news would kill her.\n\nOne evening in July of 2004, Lila told Edward that she loved him before going to bed. She then died peacefully in her sleep. The entire family and town were shocked at her passing. The family continued to bicker as they dealt with their grief. The Quartermaines and the rest of Port Charles came together to say goodbye to Lila at her funeral. Even old friends Lee and Gail Baldwin, Lucy Coe, Kevin Collins, Robin Scorpio, and Amanda Barrington all returned home for Lila's funeral and many of her family members spoke of what a wonderful person she was. Emily then took over as family peacemaker and always encouraged Jason to have more contact with the Quartermaines, as a favor to Lila. As the family sings before Thanksgiving Dinner in 2012 the ghost of Lila appears with the ghost of Edward.\n\nOn April 1, 2014, A.J. dies and she returns alongside the ghosts of Edward, Emily, and Alan. They later escorts him into heaven as Monica watches on.\n\nOn May 1, 2019, the ghosts of Lila and Edward return to escort Oscar into heaven as he dies from an inoperable brain tumor."
