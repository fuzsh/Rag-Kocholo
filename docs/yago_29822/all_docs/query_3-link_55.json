        "text": "Robert P. Stevenson, formerly of Tilton, NH, died on Thursday June 27, 2024 at Mt. Carmel Rehabilitation and Nursing Center in Manchester, NH.\n\nBob, as he was known by most people, was born in Portsmouth, NH, on June 12, 1949, under the name Patrick Joseph Richard. His name was legally changed after his adoption in 1951 to Robert P. Stevenson. Bob attended grade schools in Concord, N.H. and Rochester, NH, graduating from Spaulding High School in 1967. This was the same year as Bob’s first public performance on “Talent Showcase” which aired on WMTW TV in Maine. After high school, he earned a Bachelor of Music in voice with a minor in piano in 1971, and a Master of Arts in music education in 1973 at the University of New Hampshire. Known affectionately as “Mr. S” or “OBG” (Old Bald Guy) by his many students over the years, he retired from teaching at Haverhill Cooperative Middle School in Haverhill, NH in 2011, after nearly 39 years of teaching music, social studies and theatre in both private and public schools in New Hampshire and Massachusetts. Bob also spent 30 years performing and working in churches around New England, which included 26 years as the Director of Music and Choirmaster at First Congregational Church in Hopkinton, NH retiring in 2012. In addition to teaching at HCMS, his teaching career included the Alton Public Schools, St. Paul’s School, Gilford Middle-High School, Lakes Region School of Music, Winnisquam Regional Middle School, Tilton School, St. Thomas Aquinas High School, and the Rockport, MA Public Schools.\n\nBob initially studied vocal pedagogy with Wendell Orr of Youngstown University, and Dr. Henry Wing of the University of New Hampshire. He began his vocal career in the Boy Choir of St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Concord. A lyric baritone, Bob received regional honors from the Metropolitan Opera early in his career performing such operatic selections as “Si puo?” from the Prologue to “Pagliacci” by R. Leoncavallo. He was a professional soloist with such organizations as the New Hampshire Music Festival Symphony Orchestra, Rockingham Choral Society, and the Manchester Choral Society. Bob has also been seen on stage at such venues as the Palace Theatre in “Carousel” and “South Pacific;” Portland City Auditorium in “Faust”; the Annichiarico Theatre in “The Magic Flute”; and St. Paul’s Preparatory School in “Noyes Fludde.” Bob was the artistic director and founder of Summer Theatre Arts for Youth, Inc. which, from 1980-1984, produced summer theater in NH and VT, which included Oliver! and The Sound of Music. Over the years, Bob was also involved with The Streetcar Company theater group in Laconia, NH, the Lakes Region Community Chorus, Gilford Community Band, Moulton’s Band, and the Freese Brothers Band.\n\nIn 1969, Bob married the love of his life, Linda. They had thirty wonderful years together before her sudden passing in 1999. He missed her tremendously every day since. Bob resided in Tilton, NH for over 36 years before his many health issues forced him to enter the Mt. Carmel Rehabilitation & Nursing Center in Manchester, NH, where he resided until his passing. Bob also spent many amazing summers on the Bay of Fundy in Port Greville, Nova Scotia Canada, where he played host to visits by family and friends alike.\n\nBob is survived by his son Ryan P Stevenson and wife Kimberly of Bow; his beloved grandsons Liam and Noah Stevenson of Bow; his brother Craig Stevenson and wife Marjorie of Alton; his nephews Christopher Stevenson and his wife Maryellen of Manchester, and Richard Stevenson of Alton. Bob was predeceased by his wife Linda A (Crocker) Stevenson, his father Robert B Stevenson, and his mother Constance M (Waite) Stevenson.\n\nThe family would like to thank the staff at Mt. Carmel Rehabilitation & Nursing for the care they provided Bob over his many years as a resident. The family also extends an extra debt of gratitude to Rachel Bartee, LPN and Hannah Krafton, RN whose dedication to their work, compassion and willingness to listen, provided absolutely critical care in Bob’s final hours. The family would also like to thank the staff and volunteers of the Visiting Nurses Association of Manchester and Southern New Hampshire, who provided a great level of care and comfort with Bob’s transition to hospice in December. In lieu of flowers, please attend a show in Bob’s memory with family and friends, or donate to your local school music program.\n\nAn informal Celebration of Life will be held on Saturday July 13, 2024 from 9:00 to noon in the Academic Commons Auditorium at Lakes Region Community College, located at 379 Belmont Road in Laconia, NH, to allow Bob’s friends and family to share memories and celebrate Bob. Bob loved dessert, so the family requests, if you are able, to bring your favorite dessert for everyone to share. For additional information please visit https://rememberingbob.weebly.com/"
