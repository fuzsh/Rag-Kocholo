        "text": "Our recognition of Bowdoin scholars goes back to 1941. In those days, the students were all men, and this honor was then named exclusively for James Bowdoin III. In 1997, the College—by faculty vote—decided it was appropriate to reestablish this tradition in the name of James and Sarah Bowdoin, who was an active partner in creating this College.\n\nIn an unusual move for the times, both Sarah and James Bowdoin signed one of the deeds transferring land from the Bowdoin family to the president and trustees of the College. Sarah’s journal of her daily life (which can be found in Special Collections here at Bowdoin) documents her family’s collection and curation of art, books, and scientific materials, which the College inherited with a deep debt of gratitude.\n\nToday, we remember the Bowdoin family through this annual event, and with two other traditions: the Gilbert Stuart portraits of James and Sarah Bowdoin in the Museum of Art are decorated today with laurel garlands, and on this day, we also replace our large American flag on the Quad with a smaller flag that flew over the U.S. Capitol on August 7, 1963, to commemorate the birth of Massachusetts Governor James Bowdoin II.\n\nThe Almon Goodwin Prize\n\nThe Almon Goodwin Prize was established in 1906 by Mrs. Maud Wilder Goodwin in memory of her husband, Almon Goodwin, of the Class of 1862.\n\nThe prize is given to an exemplary member of Phi Beta Kappa, and this year’s recipient is Charlie McLarnon ’24.\n\nCharlie, who comes to Bowdoin from Northborough, Massachusetts, is a mathematics major and a chemistry minor, a clarinetist in the Bowdoin Concert Band, and a member of the Bowdoin Debate Team. They are a 2021–2022 recipient of a Kibbe Science Fellowship for their research project “Quantifying the Effect of a Constrained Olefin Dimerization Catalyst,” which sought to identify the materials and conditions necessary to synthesize a catalyst with potential applications to the plastics industry.\n\nThis past summer, Charlie was an intern for the Committee for Public Counsel in Massachusetts, where they created reference materials for the office that summarized Massachusetts sentencing guidelines for judges, reviewed and wrote reports describing security camera footage, medical records, and other discovery to help the attorneys prepare for motions and trials, and researched the legality and ethics of electronic monitoring as a pretrial condition of release.\n\nCharlie said of their experience, “The dedication to client-centered advocacy and passion for social justice that the attorneys at CPCS displayed has inspired me, and I plan to pursue a career as a public defender myself.”\n\nPhi Beta Kappa"
