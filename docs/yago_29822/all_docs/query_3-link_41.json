[1][2] He was baptised Robert Lewis Balfour, but from about his eighteenth year dropped the use of the third christian name 'Balfour' and changed the spelling of the second to 'Louis'.[3][4] His family called him Louis. He was the only child and son of Thomas Stevenson and Margaret \"Maggie\" Balfour.[5]\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson was a prolific writer, most famous for Treasure_Island (1883), The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886), Kidnapped (1886), and his children's poem collection A Child's Garden of Verses (1885).[6][7]\n\nHe was educated at the Edinburgh Academy (1861-63) and later at Edinburgh University.[8]\n\nMarriage\n\nRobert went to America and married Frances Matilda Van de Grift in May 1880 in San Francisco, California, United States. She had three children from her 1st marriage to Samuel C Osbourne, who she divorced in Jan 1880.\n\nHe inherited the tendency towards coughs and fever from his mother and maternal grandfather who both suffered from \"weak chests\", which later necessitated a desire to reside in warmer climates for his health. He travelled at one time to Australia, and finally settled on the Island of Samoa in Vailima, Tuamasaga.[5]\n\nResidence\n\n1851 Census[9][10]\n\nCensus Date: 30 MAR 1851\n\nPlace: Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland\n\nAddress: 8, Howard Place, St Cuthbert's, Edinburgh\n\nAge: 4m\n\n1861 Census[11][12][13]\n\nCensus Date: 7 APR 1861\n\nPlace: St Andrew, Midlothian, Scotland\n\nAddress: Heriot Row, St Stephen, Edinburgh\n\nAge: 10y\n\n1871 Census [14][15][16]\n\nCensus Date: 2 APR 1871\n\nPlace: Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland\n\nAddress: 17, Heriot Row, St Stephen, Edinburgh\n\nAge: 20y\n\nDeath\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson died suddenly of a stroke, aged 44 years, at his Samoan property on the 3rd of December 1894,[17][18] and as per his wishes, was buried on top of Mount Vaea, overlooking Vailima.[19][20] There is a cenotaph at Saint Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh, City of Edinburgh, Scotland.[21]\n\nHis obituary was published 17 Dec 1894 in many publications in England,[22][23] Scotland,[24][25] and the United States.
