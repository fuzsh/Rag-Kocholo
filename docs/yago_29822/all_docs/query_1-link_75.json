        "text": "I’ve added a new index ordered by rating for easy navigation to my book reviews (here). This is in addition to by index by author (here). This makes my best (here) and worst science fiction book index (here) redundant and I might get rid of it at a later date. I’ll also add more themed indexes in addition to my Sci-Fi Novels about Overpopulation Index, Sci-Fi Works by Female Authors over the course of the next few weeks.\n\nAll the indexes can be found on the bar on the righthand side.\n\nThanks for all the fascinating comments/observations and words of encouragement. I’ve greatly enjoyed reading/reviewing and conversing!\n\n(Julian S. Krupa’s cover for the July 1947 issue of Amazing Stories)\n\nThrough the window, through the view screen cities are discovered, worlds end in searing flame, vectors to unknown lands are plotted, the horrors of earth are left behind. Alone in a space station an astronaut observes the fragile construction arrayed around him. Through the window, through the view screen aliens observe our strife, loved ones watch in agony, and the culmination of our era’s scientific endeavors are arrayed in orderly rows.\n\nIn short, the possibilities are endless. The glass (or some scientifically advanced clear material) frames the story, we watch others watching or we see what they see while we stand among them…\n\nDefinitely a delightful sci-fi cover art trope worth exploring. Here are a broad selection of covers from juvenile science fiction novels, pulp magazines, edited Continue reading →\n\nHello all, Ian Sales’ wonderful SF Mistressworks (link), a review collating blog, has recently been nominated for the BSFA award (British Science Fiction Association) in the non-fiction category (link for the list). I’ve submitted nine of my reviews of sci-fi works written by women over the last few months. It was created in direct response to the absence of sci-fi masterpieces by women on a list by The Guardian, a lack of general knowledge in the sci-fi community about early female pioneers in the genre, and general lack of readership for their many award-winning works.\n\nIf you’ve written reviews of science fiction works by women (the novels/short story collections need to be written before 2000) please submit them as well (500 words or so is preferred)! So, gather up any Russ, Norton, Cherryh, C. L. Moore, Merril, Brackett, Piserchia, Le Guin, MacLean, Butler, etc etc etc reviews you might have on your blog or anywhere else. It’s a great resource for finding seldom read works/authors which deserve a greater readership. Continue reading →\n\n(Uncredited cover for the 1963 edition of Doomsday, 1999 (variant title: Midge), Paul MacTyre)\n\nBehold Part II of my popular series on the doomed city in science fiction cover art (see Part I). A doomsday that never happened, a tank and a skeletal reminder of a past battle — a ruined city, colliding stars, colliding planets…\n\nBehold the august ruins of our people, our cities, our achievements. If there’s anyone still left.\n\nAs always, are the books/authors worth reading? Continue reading →\n\n(Richard Powers’ cover for the 1959 edition of The Rest Must Die (1959), Kendell Foster Crossen)\n\nThe electricity turns off in a futuristic city and people turn into animals and everyone slowly kills each other, mysterious winds sweep through cities killing everyone, large machine minds take over, nuclear bombs destroy everything, intelligent dogs take over, the sun expands drying all the oceans, the sun expands (but not as much) and water floods over all the cities, aliens come with large guns and blow everything up, aliens come with brain probes and make others blow everything up, aliens pretend to be humans and annoy the humans enough so they blow each other up with nuclear bombs, people from the past go back in time and see that humans have blown everything up and they try to prevent the aliens from making the humans blow everything up, a bacterial agent from an alien kills everyone, Continue reading →\n\n(Uncredited cover for the 1965 edition of Beyond the Sealed World (1965), Rena M. Vale)\n\nWhile browsing through my collection of cover images I’ve collated over the last few months for science fiction art post ideas, I came across the uncredited cover for Rena Vale’s Beyond the Sealed World (1965) and was transfixed! The angle of the text, the mountain, the dark expanse of space, the little spaceship, the figures silhouetted against the night, and the surreal shape of the domed city connected to other distant domed cities… If anyone knows the artist (or has a good educated guess) please let me know! The second edition cover (below) still has beautiful domed cities but the caveman, helmeted soldier, and white-clad (not for long, the dress is slipping) woman tableau ruins the feel.\n\nParticularly noteworthy is Jack Gaughan’s elevated domed city cover Continue reading →\n\n(Walter Popp’s cover for the August 1952 issue of Fantastic Adventures)\n\nThe sphere — as a manifestation of the perfectly round geometrical shape or replete with various derivations and modifications (tentacles, slight elongations, eye sockets, limbs both fleshly or mechanical) — holds a particular fascination for sci-fi artists and authors. The possibilities are endless: spherical aliens, spherical ocean descent vehicles, spherical spaceships, spherical robotic doctors, wizards levitating spherical objects, and spherical legged war vehicles…\n\nI’ve selected a delightful variety of these spherical manifestations. In my favorite (above) female scientists alternately shout about, gaze at, and document descending Continue reading →\n\n(David Hardy’s cover for the November 1975 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction)\n\nI couldn’t stop laughing while putting together this post from my collection of gleaned covers: gumby in space with two fuzzy tufts and three unsymmetrical eye ridges (or, his fingers) ogling at a space probe, mushroom people transfixed by a mysterious white tentacled orb hoisted aloft by man in a pink cape and a skimpy pink unitard, evil nosed caterpillars, scary monstrous mole monster, etc. Did the editors KNOW precisely what the art looked like before it appeared on the covers evoking such throat hurting unintended (or perhaps intended) consequences? But, I have to admit there’s nothing like a cool (and funny alien) to make me pick up a book or magazine.\n\nAs always, what are your favorite funny alien covers which I haven’t posted?\n\nI’ve read a few of Vance’s novels so I’ll probably pick up The Eyes of the Overworld Continue reading →\n\n7/10 (Good)\n\nBoris Karloff! Mind transplants! Headstrong female scientists! 30s sci-fi horror! A watchable yet seldom seen film! What’s not to like?\n\nThe Man Who Changed His Mind (1936) is the second Robert Stevenson (later of Disney fame), Anna Lee, and John Loder feature I’ve seen — the first, Non-Stop New York (1937) wasn’t nearly as Continue reading →"
