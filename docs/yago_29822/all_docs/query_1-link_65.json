The audience interacted with the actors through optional virtual breakout rooms and audience polls.\n\nAt the center of \"The Compass\" was a trial, determining the fate of a teenager who used an app to make a life-altering decision. In this play, every show ended differently, depending on what the audience decided as the jury. The audience joined us as we navigated the question: When someone else, or something else, tells you what to do, what exactly are you responsible for?\n\nThis play was recommended for mature audiences only, as it confronted such issues as racism and school violence.\n\nView \"The Compass\" Program\n\nFeb. 12-14, 2021: Almost, Maine\n\nThe Freshman/Sophomore play, \"Almost, Maine.\" was streamed online on Friday, Feb. 12 at 7 p.m., Saturday, Feb. 13 at 2 p.m., Saturday, Feb. 13 at 7 p.m. and Sunday, Feb. 14 at 2 p.m. This multimedia production was filmed in a series of locations and the entire cast and crew was comprised on Stevenson freshmen under the direction of Theatre teacher Joey Fitzpatrick.\n\nNovember 20-22, 2020: Disney's Newsies\n\nStreamed performances: Nov. 20 at 7 p.m., Nov. 21 at 7 p.m. and Nov. 22 at 2 p.m.\n\nAccess to reserve tickets will begin on Nov. 2.\n\nOct. 24-25, 2020: OLIVÉRio: A Brazilian Twist\n\nOLIVÉRio streamed on Oct. 24 at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. and Oct. 25 at 2 p.m.\n\nPlease visit this online ticketing site to receive your free access code to stream this production.\n\nTheatre - Improv\n\nFeb. 5, 2021: The Failed Presidential Candidates, Live Virtual Comedy Show\n\nThe Failed Presidential Candidates hosted a live virtual comedy show on Friday, Feb. 5 at 7:00 p.m. Twenty-seven of Stevenson's funniest students made up an entire performance, never to be seen again!
