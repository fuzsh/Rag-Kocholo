        "text": "Anna Lee Dishner Gamble, 91, of Kingsport, died Sunday morning, August 4, 2024, at The Blake after an extended illness. Born in Duffield, VA, she lived the remainder of her life in Kingsport, TN. She was a graduate of Rye Cove High School and attended Maryville College for Music Performance.\n\nMusic was always her passion. Anna was a member of The Symphony Chorus, now known as Voices of The Mountains. At age 82, she was the featured soloist for the Symphony of the Mountains 2014 Winter Concert. Anna was diligent about keeping her voice healthy and her musical education current. She studied with many renowned vocal teachers, most importantly, Ms. Rhea Hunter, Joseph Huffman and Mark Davis. She participated in many concerts, most notably in a featured choir directed by John Rutter at Carnegie Hall. She participated in the Tour of John Knox Choir which toured Scotland and Northern England. In addition to her love of sacred music, she performed in groups and variety shows such as the Kiwanis Kapers and with local Big Bands directed by Charlie Goodwin and her late husband, Bill Gamble. She was an active member of First Presbyterian Church, where she served as a member of the chancel choir and was also a deacon.\n\nAnna worked in many facets of the dental industry. Most will remember her as the Office Manager of Johnson, Carver, Stakias, Mather and Smith, now known as Kingsport Dental Office. She retired from Kingsport Dental Office “where she ran a tight ship.”\n\nShe was preceded in death by her husband, William T. Gamble; parents: Brad Dishner and Sibyl Miller Dishner; siblings, Everett Dishner and wife Lucille, Ruth Humphrey, Helen Byerley and husband Desler, Paul Dishner, Don Dishner and wife Ruth, and Linda Frazier and husband Jimmy.\n\nAnna is survived by her two daughters, Leanna Cee Bacon Baldwin and husband Steve and Laura Helen Bacon Morse and husband Jim; five grandchildren, Josh, Rachael, Sybil, Charlie, and Parker; seven great-granddaughters, Madison, Maesyn, McKenna, Selin, Isla, Alya, and Lake; several nieces and nephews; her husband’s three children, Charlotte Spear and husband Harry, Alan Gamble and wife Rhoda Bliese, and Susan Gamble-Paradis and husband, Ed; grandchildren; and great grandchildren.\n\nA private viewing and graveside service will be held by the family.\n\nA Celebration of Life, officiated by Dr. William Shelton, will be held on Saturday, August 10, 2024, at 11:00 am in the Sanctuary at First Presbyterian Church, located on Church Circle, downtown Kingsport. The family will receive friends immediately following the service in the Church Fellowship Hall.\n\nThe family would like to offer many thanks to the staff and administration of The Blake at Kingsport, Brighter Days Sitter Service and Gentiva Hospice for the loving care that was given to our Mama, Grannie Annie, Grandma, Sukey, and Gran.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to The Symphony of The Mountains, 1200 E. Center St., Suite 311, Kingsport, TN 37660."
