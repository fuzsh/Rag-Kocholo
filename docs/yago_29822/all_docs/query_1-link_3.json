The daughter of a clergyman, Anna Lee was born Joan Boniface Winnifrith and encouraged to pursue an acting career by her father.

        "text": "Was paralyzed from the waist down in an automobile accident, and acted in a wheelchair for more than two decades.\n\nDuring World War II, Lee performed with Jack Benny and others in USO tours entertaining troops in North Africa and Europe. General George S. Patton awarded her a special medal for her efforts.\n\nPassed away just a week before she was to have received a Daytime Emmy Award for lifetime achievement. Her actor son, Jeffrey Byron, accepted on her behalf at the New York ceremony.\n\nFrom 1990 to 1991, Ms. Lee's granddaughter, Erin Everly, was married to Axl Rose, of Guns N' Roses, briefly making Axl Rose Ms. Lee's \"grandson-in-law\". Ms. Everly was the inspiration for the Guns N' Roses song \"Sweet Child O' Mine\" and is the daughter of Ms. Lee's daughter Venetia Stevenson and Don Everly of The Everly Brothers.\n\nIn the film Bedlam (1946), Anna darkened her hair so that audiences would take her more seriously and keep it dark for much of the next few years. One of her costumes was worn by Vivien Leigh in Vom Winde verweht (1939).\n\nAnna Lee passed away on May 14, 2004. Just a couple of months afterwards, General Hospital (1963) aired a tribute to Lee by holding a memorial service for her character.\n\nHad two daughters with first husband Robert Stevenson. Following their divorce in 1944, Anna was given custody of younger daughter Caroline, but Venetia chose to reside with her father. Anna was estranged from her daughter for 15 years. They reunited after appearing together in the films Jet Over the Atlantic (1959) and Vom Dritten keine Spur (1960).\n\nComedian Jack Hulbert served as Best Man at her first wedding, and Alfred Hitchcock gave her away at her second.\n\nShe did no work in the cinema between 1949 and 1958, because, she claimed, she had been blacklisted by the far-right supporters of Senator McCarthy. She found this ridiculous, especially as she was, in her own words, \"an old-fashioned Winston Churchill conservative\", and always gave her old friend John Ford the credit for breaking the blacklist.\n\nAnna Lee played opposite a character named Allan Quartermain, in King Solomon's Mines (1937), then 46 years later played a character named Lila Quartermaine on the soap opera General Hospital (1963) who had a son Alan Quartermaine.\n\nThe blue-eyed blonde was occasionally a brunette in films. In Das Haus der sieben Sünden (1940), she wore her hair darker because star Marlene Dietrich insisted on no competing blondes in her pictures.\n\nInitially studied with Elsie Fogarty at the Royal Albert Central School Hall in London. Later toured with the London Repertory Theatre where she earned the title \"The British Bombshell\".\n\nDubbed the voice of Patricia Morison who was playing the writer George Sand in the film Nur wenige sind auserwählt (1960) because George Cukor, who did uncredited directing on the film after Charles Vidor's death, wanted the character to have harsher vocal tones.\n\nShe was awarded the MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) in the 1982 Queen's Birthday Honours List for her services to drama.\n\nShe was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6777 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on January 7, 1993.\n\nShe appeared in two films that have been selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant: So grün war mein Tal (1941) and Meine Lieder, meine Träume (1965).\n\nHer brother Sir John Winnifrith served in the British government as undersecretary of state for Agriculture and Fisheries and was also director general for the National Trust. He passed away on January 1, 1993 at age 84.\n\nMay 21, 2004: Anna Lee's posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences was accepted on her behalf by her son, Jeffrey Byron, at the 31st Annual Daytime Emmy Awards. Ms. Lee's former \"General Hospital\" costar, Vanessa Marcil, was host of the ceremony and paid tribute to Ms. Lee prior to Mr. Byron's introduction and speech.\n\nMay 30, 2007: Release of her posthumously published memoir from McFarland publishing,\"Anna Lee: Memoir of a Career on General Hospital and in Film,\" co-written with and completed by Barbara Roisman Cooper."
