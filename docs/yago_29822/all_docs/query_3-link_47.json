Jane Cornman performed the ceremony at St. Maryâ€™s-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church in Northeast Harbor, Me.\n\nMs. Winthrop, 25, will continue to use her name professionally. She is the fine art specialist at Grogan & Company, an auction house for art and jewelry in Boston. She graduated from Harvard.\n\nHer father retired as a partner in Associated Architects, a Boston firm.\n\nThe bride is a descendant of John Winthrop, a founder and governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. She is also the great-great granddaughter of John F. Dodge, a founder of the Dodge automobile company.\n\nMr. Stevenson, 32, is a senior business analyst at Eagle Investment Systems, a financial software developer in Wellesley, Mass. He graduated from Hobart College.\n\nHis mother retired as a board member of the Carroll County Land Trust, a rural environmental trust in Westminster, Md. His father retired as a manager in the technology group and as an underwriter in Baltimore for Equitable, an insurance unit of the AXA Group.\n\nThe groom is a descendant of Charles Carroll and William Hooper, both signers of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nThe fathers of the bride and groom grew up together in Hamilton, Mass., went to college together, and often visited as they were beginning their careers. So the bride and groom knew each other as small children. But they first connected as adults in 2012, when their families spent a week together in the Bahamas."
