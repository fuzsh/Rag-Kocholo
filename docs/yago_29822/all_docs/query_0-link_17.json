        "text": "Actress Born Joan Boniface Winnifrith on Jan. 2, 1913 in Ightham, United Kingdom\n\nAnna Lee was a beautiful British actress who burst into the Hollywood limelight with the 1941 epic \"How Green Was My Valley\" and capped her seven-decade career as matriarch Lila Quartermaine on daytime television's \"General Hospital.\"\n\nLee made her film debut in 1932 in \"Ebb Tide\" and was quickly dubbed \"the British Bombshell\" for her striking good looks. She appeared in a dozen or so British movies including \"King Solomon's Mines\" before moving to Hollywood in 1939 with her director husband Robert Stevenson. Her first American film was \"My Life With Caroline\" opposite Ronald Colman.\n\nBut she got far more attention with her second U.S. film and first of eight for John Ford, \"How Green Was My Valley.\" The epic about Welsh coalminers won five Academy Awards, including best picture, and secured Lee's place in Ford's coterie.\n\nLee's more than 60 motion pictures also included several with another of director Ford's favorites, John Wayne, including \"Fort Apache,\" \"The Horse Soldiers\" and \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.\" She is also remembered for her roles in \"Bedlam\" opposite Boris Karloff in 1946, \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\" in 1947 and as a nun in \"The Sound of Music\" in 1965."
