        "text": "Writer\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson was born into a family of engineers and lighthouse builders - his grandfather, Robert Stevenson (1772-1850), built the Bell Rock Lighthouse. He studied engineering and law before turning to writing. 'Treasure Island' was serialised in 1882 and in 1886 'Kidnapped' and 'The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde' became international best-sellers. In the face of chronic ill-health he was advised to seek warmer climes. He met Fanny Vandegrift Osbourne in France in 1876, followed her to her native California and they married in 1880. They lived in Switzerland, France, on the south coast of England and in Scotland, while Stevenson sought a place congenial to his health. After the death of his father in 1887, he felt free to travel further afield and having taken his family and his mother over to the USA finally settled in the Samoan island of Upolu in the Pacific. Here he continued to work but was eventually overcome by the constant companion he called 'bluidy Jack' - the spitting of blood caused by his affliction. He was buried on Upolu.\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson is one of the famous Scots commemorated in our Archivists' Garden. The entries on almond and ling (white heather) include quotes from his poems.\n\nBirth in 1850\n\nRobert Lewis Balfour Stevenson was born on 13 November 1850, the son of Thomas Stevenson, civil engineer, and Margaret Isabella Balfour.
