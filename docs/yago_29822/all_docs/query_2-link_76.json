        "text": "Anna Lee Huber My inspiration comes from a few places. Yes, I paint. Though nowhere near the level of Lady Darby. :) My husband and older brother (who is an art teacher) are better artists than me, and I talk to them a lot about the process. I also do research in historical painting methods and materials. And I tap into my artistic sensibilities as a writer and a musician (my college degree is in vocal performance) to help me portray Lady Darby's mindset.\n\nAnna Lee Huber The answer is...I goofed. :) I forgot about that when writing the next book and no one caught it. By the time I remembered, I'd set two precedents and had to decide which to go with. He also gets called Sebastian so infrequently that I decided it was unique enough for their private moments.\n\nAnna Lee Huber Thank you for contacting me! Would it be too much trouble to ask you to send me pics? If not here, then through my website contact form (www.annaleehuber.com). If you message me there, I can respond, and then you can attach pics. That would be helpful for me to send to my publisher to have them look into the matter. This is definitely alarming!\n\nAnna Lee Huber Hi Karen! I'm so happy to hear how much you're enjoying Verity and Sidney. :) There is a bit of a delay on the release of Book 7 because my publisher asked me to write a historical fiction novel about the Titanic that they wanted to release first. But I AM contracted to write Verity Kent Books 7-9. Book 7 should release in late summer/autumn of next year (2024). And then 8 and 9 should follow each year after.\n\nAnna Lee Huber Hi Deborah! Sorry for the delayed response. Thank you so much! Yes, there will be at least 3 more Verity Kent Mysteries. My publisher has shuffled my release schedule a bit because they asked me to write a straight historical fiction novel about the Titanic. So that bumped Verity Kent Book 7 to 2024. But it IS coming. I'm doing research for it right now. :)\n\nAnna Lee Huber Hi Miriam! I'm happy to hear how much you're enjoying my books. I am aware of one or two errors that slipped past the many rounds of edits, as happens sometimes with many books. But I'm not aware that it is riddled with them - which is distressing and makes me concerned there's been a technical glitch. Can you tell me what format you're reading? And where it was purchased or borrowed from? That will help me narrow down what's happening when I contact my publisher. Thanks!\n\nAnna Lee Huber Kat, I'm very confused. I've received two of almost the exact same messages from this account in the last 16 days and answered both. Is this a SPAM account? If not, my answer stays the same. My publisher Kensington ran the giveaway and has, or will be, mailing the prize books. Per the notification message, please contact them directly. They are very good at getting these prizes into winners' hands, and I'm sure they'll remedy any problem. If you don't hear back from them in a timely manner, please reply to this thread then and I will try to find out what's going on. I'll need to know what date you received your prize notification so I can direct Kensington to the appropriate contest batch. The copy of the notification you or someone else shared in response to your previously asking this question did not list the date. Thank you! Please in future correspondence, post to this thread in the comments. If I receive this question a 4th time, I'll assume this account is SPAM. Thanks!\n\nAnna Lee Huber Hi Kat! If you won a copy through Goodreads, then the giveaway was sponsored by my publisher - Kensington - and they should have mailed your prize to you. Does Goodreads give you a way to reach out to the giveaway sponsor directly? If not, then I can contact my publicist there to see if she can find out the status of prize mailings. Also, what date did you receive your notification? That will help them narrow down which giveaway/prize batch they should look in for your shipping info. Thanks!\n\nAnna Lee Huber Hi Kat! The giveaway was run by my publisher - Kensington Publishing - so they should be sending your copy. I can message them to try to find out the status. Do you know the date when you received your notification that you'd won? They've run several giveaways recently, so that will help me narrow down which batch your book should have been mailed in from them.\n\nAnna Lee Huber Thank you so much, Michele! And prayers and best wishes for a swift recovery! I am currently finishing writing Lady Darby Book 11 - A Fatal Illusion - which will release next spring. Then my current contract is up, but hopefully my publisher will offer me another contract to write more books in the series. I certainly have plans for more. :) I should know more this summer.\n\nAnna Lee Huber Hi Sheral!\n\nSo sorry for my slow response. Somehow I missed this. Thank you so much! I am writing more of Lady Darby and Verity Kent. Verity Kent Book 6 - A Certain Darkness - releases August 30th, and I've signed a contract to write at least 3 more, taking the series up to Book 9. Lady Darby Book 11 will release next spring, and I'm hopeful this summer I'll be offered a contract to write more in that series.\n\nAnna Lee Huber Hi Abby! I know readers have been waiting a long time for Gothic Myths Book 2. There have been so many unforeseen hiccups, and I've stopped listing more definite pub dates b/c I feel bad that I keep having to change it. I am extremely hopeful that I will be able to publish the book in mid-2022."
