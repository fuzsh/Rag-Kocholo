        "text": "Coach Lee grew up in Abilene, Texas and graduated high school from Abilene High in 1993. She completed her Bachelor's degree with honors from Texas State University in Exercise and Sport Science minoring in Health and Wellness. She earned her Master's degree in Educational Leadership in January 2013. She has a loving husband named Harold with 2 wonderful boys Easton and Colt. Hobbies include keeping up with the family activities, hunting, crafting, any type of outdoor recreation, and love a mean game of Mexican Train or Pickleball.\n\nShe has been teaching physical education and health at the middle and high school levels since the Fall of 2003. During this time she has coached volleyball and softball at the junior and varsity levels and also coached track and basketball at the middle school levels. Her start in Fort Bend ISD was at Baines Middle School as the PE/Health Department Head and Girl's Athletics Coordinator where she lead the program to many district titles in all sports, with the help of her fabulous coach staff and wonderful parent support. Coach Lee also started Fort Bend ISD's very first middle school cross country team in 2018 and upon leaving Baines there were 4 other middles schools participating with over 100 participants. Her lifetime goal is to one day oversee a high school or district as a coordinator (checked off list) or assistant athletic director to still stay involved with students.\n\nCoach Lee is currently teaching physical education, volleyball, assistant cheer, and athletic co-coordinator at Kempner High School.\n\nFavorite Quote:\n\nBattle, Believe, and Breathe.... Jennifer Lee\n\nBattle for every point in your life\n\nBelieve in yourself, your team, your coaches, and loved ones that surround you\n\nBreathe through the fear, the hard, and the victories"
