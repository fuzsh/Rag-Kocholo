When she and her first husband, director Robert Stevenson, moved to Hollywood she became associated with John Ford, appearing in several of his movies, notably How Green Was My Valley, Two Rode Together and Fort Apache. She was also a member of the Val Lewton stock company, appearing in his classic 1946 film Bedlam. She had a lead role opposite Brian Donlevy and Walter Brennan in Fritz Lang’s Hangmen Also Die!, a wartime thriller about the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich.\n\nLee made frequent appearances on television anthology series in the 1940s and 1950s, including Robert Montgomery Presents, The Ford Theatre Hour, Kraft Television Theatre, Armstrong Circle Theatre and Wagon Train.\n\nShe had a small, but memorable, role as Sister Margaretta in The Sound of Music. Sister Margaretta was a supporter of Maria in the abbey and was one of the two nuns who thwarted the Nazis by removing car engine parts, allowing the Von Trapps to escape. Lee also appeared in the 1962 camp classic What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? as next-door neighbor Mrs. Bates alongside Joan Crawford and Bette Davis. In 1994, she took the leading role of the feature film What Can I Do?, directed by Wheeler Winston Dixon.\n\namzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";amzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"hwof05-20\";amzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"search\";amzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";amzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";amzn_assoc_region = \"US\";amzn_assoc_default_search_phrase = \"Anna Lee\";amzn_assoc_default_category = \"All\";amzn_assoc_linkid = \"55eff95a50b66e89ff63cd2b2fd4e0af\";amzn_assoc_search_bar = \"false\";amzn_assoc_title = \"Shop Anna Lee\";"
