[MW]\n\nBlount, Martha Marie, 1690-1763 (Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nBlount, Martha Marie, 1690-1763 (Library of Congress Name Authority)—Martha Marie Blount was a close friend to author Alexander Pope, so much so that some contemporaries speculated that she was his lover or even secret wife. Because her family estate was concentrated on her younger brother, the shy, quiet-tempered Martha spent many of her adult years living with her more difficult sister Teresa (b. 1688), addressee of Pope's poems \"Epistle to Miss Blount, with the Works of Voiture\" (1710) and \"Epistle to Miss Blount, on her Leaving the Town after the Coronation\" (1714). Blount was also cousin to Arabella Fermor, subject of Pope's Rape of the Lock. When Pope died, he left Martha a sufficient inheritance to enable her for the first time to establish a household independent of her sister. [MW]\n\nBoccaccio, Giovanni, 1313-1375 (Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nItalian writer, poet, and Renaissance humanist.

His translation of Longinus's Peri Hypsous as Le Traité du Sublime (1674; Treatise on the Sublime) was followed by Réflexions critiques sur Longin (1694; Critical Reflections on Longinus), which argued for the necessity of classical poetic models. [MW]\n\nBolingbroke, Henry St. John, Viscount, 1678-1751 (Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nAs a British Tory politician, philosopher, and political journalist, Viscount Bolingbroke famously opposed the Walpole administration. Bolingbroke maintained friendships with notable authors including Alexander Pope and Johnathan Swift. A prolific writer, Bolingbroke was especially known for his histories and political journalism, including such publications as A Dissertation upon Parties (1735); A Letter on the Spirit of Patriotism (1736); Letters to a Young Nobleman on the Study and Use of History (1738); Idea of a Patriot King (1738); Remarks on the History of England (1743); Familiar Epistle to the Most Impudent Man Living (1749); and Letters on the Study and Use of History (1752).

Though he was able to ascend to power, he was not able to solidify and retain it, thus inspiring Niccolo Machiavelli to write The Prince\n\nBoswell, James, 1740-1795 (Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nJudge and unsuccessful political aspirant, essayist, poet, and critic, but most famous for The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D (1791), Boswell established the modern biographical focus on the intimacies of private character through this famous biography and his preface defending his methods. That publication was preceded by The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides with Samuel Johnson, LL.D. (1785), which appeared shortly after Johnson's death and aroused reader enthusiasm for a portrait that includes personal foibles as well as venerable accomplishments. Also notable as a unique combination of biography of Pascal Paoli, history, and travel journal, An Account of Corsica (1768) helped inspire British popular support for Corsica's struggle against French domination. [MW]\n\nBowles, William Lisle , 1762-1850 (Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nAuthor of Fourteen Sonnets (1789), admired by the major Lake School authors.

In her essay on Richardson, Barbauld occasionally spells the name \"Bradshaw.\" [MW]\n\nBradshaw, Lady—\n\nAppears as an alternate spelling of Bradshaigh. [MW]\n\nBrooke, Frances, 1724?-1789 (Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nBrooke began her literary career with The Old Maid (1755-6), a witty essay periodical that she operated under the pseudonym \"Mary Singleton, Spinster,\" and that was reprinted as a single volume in 1764. This periodical staging interactions between a vivid central voice, the perspectives of other contributors (probably fictional), and reader correspondence (much of which may also have been fictional), it is no surprise that her first full-length literary effort was a drama, Virginia: A Tragedy (1756), which she was unable to get staged. Her first two novels similarly capitalized on dramatic dialog skills in their epistolary form. The first, The History of Lady Julia Mandeville (1763), was issued anonymously. It was quite successful, going through multiple editions in its first year. Around the time of its publication, Brooke left England, the country where she was born and lived her early life, to join her husband, who was serving in Canada as part of the British army. The History of Emily Montague by\"the Author of Lady Julia Mandeville\"(1769) capitalizes on her Canadian experiences. Though not as succesful as her previous novel, this one was also well received and is lauded by some as the first Canadian novel. A second anonymous Canadian novel, All's Right at Last (1774), has tentatively been attributed to Brooke largely on the basis of its subject matter. The Excursion (1777), with its lampoon of actor and stage manager David Garrick, followed next. At this point Brooke began to achieve some dramatic success with stagings of her tragedy Siege of Sinope in 1781, and two comic operas, Rosina in 1782 and Marian in 1788. Her final novel, The History of Charles Mandeville, was posthumously published in 1790. In addition to her own creative works, Brooke translated several from the French, including Letters from Juliet Lady Catesby (1760), an epistolary novel by Marie Riccoboni. [MW]\n\nBrooke, Henry, 1703?-1783 (Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nBrooke authored The Fool of Quality (1765-70), a novel of sensibility, and Gustavus Vasa, the Deliverer of His Country, a drama written in 1739 whose performance was forbidden because of its applicability to English politics in its time. [MW]\n\nBrown, Charles Brockden, 1771-1810 (Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nAs the first professional American author, Brown was known for his Gothic novels, especiallyWieland (1798), Arthur Mervyn (1799), Ormond (1799), and Edgar Huntly (1799), Memoirs of Carwin, the Biloquist (1803–1805). Brown edited or operated a number of periodicals during his life, including the Monthly Magazine, and American Review (1799-1800), renamed the American Review, and Literary Journal (1801-1802), the Literary Magazine, and American Register (1803-1807), and the American Register, or General Repository of History, Politics, and Science (1807-1809). [MW]\n\nBrowne, William, 1590-approximately 1645 (Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nAn English pastoral poet with an acute eye for nature, known for his long poem Britannia's Pastorals, two parts published in 1613 and 1616, with a third unfinished part printed posthumously in 1832 (1613-16). Two of his poems appeared as well in The Shepheard's Pipe, a collection of ecologues by various authors. [JDP] [MW]\n\nBrowning, Elizabeth Barrett, 1806-1861 (Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nAs one of the most accomplished poets of nineteenth-century Britain, Elizabeth Barrett was proposed as a possible successor to William Wordsworth as poet laureate. Barrett enjoyed a physically active and intellectually vigorous childhood. Under the guidance of her brother Edward's tutor and the family's neighbor, classicist Hugh Stuart Boyd, she studied Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and several modern continental languages, becoming deeply versed in these literatures and eventually producing several translations from Greek poetry, including one of Aeschylus's Prometheus Bound, first published in 1833. She began writing poetry as a very young child, and by fourteen had penned The Battle of Marathon (1820), which her father had privately printed. By age fifteen she was publishing publicly as well, two of her poems appearing anonymously in the New Monthly Magazine. That same year Elizabeth Barrett and several of her siblings fell ill of an uncertain disorder that may have been either tuberculosis of the spine or bronchitis. Sent to a spa for treatment, she returned an invalid under physician's orders to avoid intellectually strenuous pursuits. Nevertheless, she continued to read, study, and write, producing An Essay on the Mind (1826) as well as several shorter poems by age 20. Despite her poetic success, the next decade brought her several crushing losses and a dangerous intensification of her illness: the unexpected death of her much-loved mother in 1828, the loss of the family home, and, in 1838 a hemorrhage of her lungs which forced her to a spa on England's south coast, where she spent the next three years, and where her brother Edward, with whom she was exceptionally close, drowned in 1840. By the time she returned to London in 1841, again under orders to avoid intellectual stimulation, both her physical and emotional health seemed irretrievably broken. Yet her poetry appeared regularly in periodicals and popular gift annuals, and The Seraphim, and Other Poems was published in 1838. Despite her illness, too, when Barrett returned to London she enjoyed a widening circle of literary and artistic acquaintances, including William Wordsworth, Walter Savage Landor, Mary Russell Mitford, art critic Anna Jameson, and painter Benjamin Robert Hayden. Her second volume of poetry, Poems (1844), established her beyond question as a significant poet. It also brought her a warm letter from Robert Browning, initiating a passionate courtship that culminated, because of her father's fervent opposition to her marriage, in the couple's elopement and departure for Italy in 1846. During their courtship, Elizabeth composed the sonnets collected as Sonnets from the Portuguese, which appeared in an expanded 1850 edition of Poems. Under the influence of a more active life and the genial Italian climate, Elizabeth's health improved dramatically. She continued to publish, with Casa Guidi Windows (1851), her response to the Italian struggle for independence the next major work to appear. Her epic poem Aurora Leigh (1856) details the maturation and career of a fictional female poet, and is often compared to Wordsworth's autobiographical epic, The Prelude (1850). Strong in its criticism of Victorian social mores, particularly the restrictive attitudes toward women, the poem scandalized many critics, but enjoyed immediate public success. Her last volume to be published in her lifetime, Poems before Congress (1860), returns to the subject of Italian politics. Having enjoyed a period of relatively good health after her marriage, Elizabeth Barrett Browning's health again began to deteriorate, and in 1861 a rupture in her lungs proved fatal. She left behind a body of work that contemporaries praised as placing her at the apex of female poetic tradition and even her detractors recognized for its combination of sensitivity and intellectual depth. [MW]\n\nBruce, James, 1730-1794(Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nA Scottish explorer who discovered the source of the Blue Nile in 1770.

[MW]\n\nBuchanan, George, 1506-1582 (Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nA satirical poet and eventually preceptor to James I of England (James VI of Scotland), Buchanan spent seven months of his life imprisoned in a Portuguese monastery for his advocacy of Lutheranism. An incident from Buchanan's Rerum Scoticarvm Historia, published posthumously in 1582, was the inspiration for Tobias Smollett's unsuccessful play The Regicide (1749). [VW] [MW]\n\nBudgell, Eustace, 1686-1737 (Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nA cousin of Joseph Addison and a contributor to the Spectator, the Guardian, and probably the Tatler, Budgell also authored his own periodical, the Bee.

His personal life became notorious after an acrimonious divorce, followed his ex-wife Rosina's publication of her thinly fictionalized Cheveley, or the Man of Honour (1839), a bitter satire of her ex-husband's infidelities. Bulwer's literary career began while he was still at Cambridge with the award of the Chancellor's Prize for his poem Sculpture. His early works, novels of manners like Pelham; or, The Adventures of a Gentleman (1828) and Paul Clifford (1830), are said to be influenced by his friendship with William Godwin. He is best known for historical novels like The Last Days of Pompeii (1834) and Rienzi, the Last of the Roman Tribunes (1835); a series of domestic novels starting with The Caxtons: A Family Picture (1849); his utopian novel, The Coming Race (1871); and his plays, The Lady of Lyons (1838), Richelieu (1839), and Money (1840).

[MW]\n\nBurke, Edmund, 1729-1797 (Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nStatesman, philosopher, historian, and sometime poet, Irish-born Edmund Burke is by far the most articulate representative of the conservative perspective on the French Revolution. His Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790) responds critically to a pro-revolution sermon by Rev. Richard Price by castigating the French for their failure to respect historically sanctioned traditional government and private property. Burke also made a landmark contribution to eighteenth-century aesthetic discourse with A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757). [MW]\n\nBurney, Charles, 1726-1814 (Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nMusician, composer, and highly respected musicologist; father of novelist Fanny Burney. A contributor to The Cyclopedia; or, Universal Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Literature (1802-1819), Burney authored and translated a number of other works on music, musicians, and music history, the most important of which include The Present State of Music in France and Italy (1771), The Present State of Music in Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Provinces (1773), and A General History of Music, From the Earliest Ages to the Present Period (1776-1789).

[MW]\n\nBurns, Gilbert 1760?-1827 (Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nGilbert and his brother, poet Robert Burns, took a joint lease of their father's farm at Mossgiel near Mauchline, Scotland where they both worked as farmers. Gilbert wrote letters to various people in his lifetime, which have served in uncovering the life of his famous brother. [VS]\n\nBurns, Robert, 1759-1796 (Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nScottish poet and collector of rural and traditional songs, Burns was sometimes known as the Ploughman Poet for his vocation as a farmer and his depictions of rural life. Much of his work is written in his native Scots. Though admired by many of his contemporaries, Burns was continually dogged by financial strains. His Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect (1786) was repeatedly reissued in enlarged editions. He is also credited with collecting and editing the song collection The Merry Muses of Caledonia: A Collection of Favorite Scots Songs (c. 1800). [MW]\n\nBurton, Robert, 1577-1640 (Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nAlong with aspiring to summarize everything that had ever been written about melancholy, Burton's widely admired Anatomy of Melancholy (1621) contains a rich trove of legendary love stories. [MW]\n\nBusk, M. M. (Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nBorn in London in 1779 as Mary Margaret Blair, this author, translator, and journalist was educated by her mother, with possible assistance from masters. In addition to history, composition, and a seemingly unusual understanding of the sciences, she developed proficiency in French, Italian, Latin, Dutch, German, and Spanish. Her father was a successful non-conformist businessman with an inclination to gamble, connected with many of the leading intellectuals of the day, and Mary Margaret was exposed to their conversation, another probable informal source of education. She married barrister William Busk (1769-1849) in 1796. William was initially prosperous, but after some losses sustained in an expensive and unsuccessful parliamentary election campaign, he was insolvent, and Mary Margaret turned to writing for remuneration, publishing for the first time when she was in her 40s. Family connections to Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine enabled her to break into periodical work, initially anonymously, but soon she began negotiating with periodical editors under her own name. She contributed a large number of articles to each of the Foreign Quarterly Review, Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, and the Athenaeum, as well as perhaps a few contributions to other periodicals, theorizing about and reviewing literature in all the languages in which she had facility. Her work offers a substantial contribution to familiarizing British audiences with a broad range of foreign literature. In addition to her reviewing work, she authored poems, plays, tales, and histories. Some of her more noteworthy publications include the novel Zeal and Experience (1819); Tales of Fault and Feeling (1825); History of Spain and Portugal (1833); Plays and Poems (1837); Biographical Sketches European and Asiatic (1847), intended for children; and Mediaeval Popes, Emperors, Kings, and Crusaders, or, Germany, Italy, and Palestine, from a.d. 1125 to a.d. 1268, a work in four volumes (1854-1856).

With Sarah Ponsonby, the subject of William Wordsworth's sonnet \"To the Lady E.B and the Hon. Miss P.\". She and Ponsonby left conventional marriages to move to Llangollen in Wales and cohabitate, fascinating and scandalizing contemporaries by wearing men's clothing. Though many observers believed that the two were a sexual couple, diary evidence suggest that may not have been the case.\n\nButler, Samuel, 1612-1680 (Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nPoet and satirist, Butler is best remembered for Hudibras (1663-4), a political satire of Puritan fanaticism and hypocrisy. [MW]\n\nByrom, John, 1692-1763 (Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nPoet, shorthand innovator and instructor, and contributor to Joseph Addison's Spectator.

As Justice of the Peace for Middlesex and Westminster, Henry Fielding heard Canning's accusations, and convinced of her veracity, Fielding issued a warrant for her abusers’ arrest. Subsequent recanting by some witnesses left Canning accused of perjury and unleashed a flood of accounts, accusations, and counteraccusations in the popular press, including John Hill’s The Story of Elizabeth Canning Considered (1753). In 1754, despite fairly evenly divided opinion among both the public and the court, Canning was convicted of perjury and transported to Wethersfield, Connecticut, where she met and married John Treat, had a family, and lived the remainder of her life. The case has continued to draw adherents on both sides of the question of Canning's guilt into the 20th century. [RD] [MW]\n\nCanning, George, 1770-1827 (Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nCanning had been a conservative British politician since the early 1790s, serving, among other posts, as foreign minister before rising to Prime Minister in April 1827. In addition to his memorable political speeches, Mr. Canning wrote for both the Anti-Jacobin Review, which he co-founded, and the Quarterly Review. His health failed soon after his Prime Minister appointment, and he died in August of the same year. [KI] [MW]\n\nCamões, Luís de, 1524?-1580 (Library of Congress Name Authority)—\n\nAs the author of the epic poem Os Lusíadas (1572), Camões is regarded as Portugal's great national poet. The poem describes the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's discovery of the sea route to India. Some of its details may have been partly based on Camões's own travels in the east.
