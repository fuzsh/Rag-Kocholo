        "text": "THE ROADS WE FOLLOW by Nicole Deese\n\nSERIES: Fog Harbor #2\n\nGENRE: Contemporary Romance (Christian)\n\nPUBLISHER: Bethany House\n\nRELEASE DATE: April 30, 2024\n\nPAGES: 399\n\nA cross-country road trip. A secretive box of journals. An unforgettable summer romance.\n\nAs the youngest daughter of a country music legend, Raegan Farrow longs to establish an identity away from the spotlight and publish her small-town romances under a pen name. But after her dream is dashed when she won’t exploit her mother’s fame to further her own career, she hears a rumor from a reliable source regarding a tell-all being written about the Farrow family. Making matters worse, the unknown author has gone to great lengths to remain anonymous until publication.\n\nRaegan chooses to keep the tell-all a secret from her scandal-leery sisters as they embark on a two-week cross-country road trip at their mother’s request and makes it her mission to expose the identity of the author behind the unsanctioned biography. But all is complicated when she discovers their hired bus driver, Micah Davenport, has a hidden agenda of his own–one involving both of their mothers and an old box of journals. As they rely on each other to find the answers they seek, the surprising revelations they unearth will lead them down an unexpected road of love and reconciliation.\n\nOther Books In This Series\n\n“I’m so thankful the answer was you.”\n\nY’all. I was so proud of myself for not bawling all the way through The Roads We Follow like I did through The Words We Lost. In fact, while I was just as profoundly moved by this story as I was by its predecessor, I thought I was actually going to make it to the end without crying this time. And then… those seven words had all the tears I’d apparently been storing up since page one spilling down my face. The scene it’s part of, the journey these characters have been on, the masterful plot layers culminating in that moment… all of it just touched my heart so deeply. Because just like The Words We Lost (and maybe even more so), Deese’s new Fog Harbor Romance – The Roads We Follow – exquisitely captures the intersection between complicated human relationships and the complete healing that can only be found in Jesus.\n\nEach of the main characters in The Roads We Follow has pain they’re trying to handle on their own, pain that spans the gamut from broken relationships to life-changing secrets and other high-pressure struggles that come with being part of a famous family. And while the ‘forced proximity’ trope works so deliciously in romance because the constantly-shared space makes it nearly impossible to continue suppressing passionate feelings, it also quite nicely does the same thing with family drama. In this book, that comes in the form of an impromptu road trip across the USA that country music legend Luella Farrow springs on her three daughters (including the story’s heroine Raegan) and includes an impromptu bus driver (whose mother helped launch Luella’s career) on a quest of his own. I felt the palpable tension as the Farrow women’s avoided conversations pile up along with the miles, and I loved the character development that Deese weaves throughout this story. Nobody is the same after this road trip, including the reader.\n\nI also loved the relationship that blooms between Micah and Raegan – not only because the chemistry they share is positively swoony but also because of the sweet way they affirm each other. Micah is truly a good sport whose personality I fell in love with immediately – he’s an absolute gentleman in the way he treats Raegan, yes, but also in the way he treats her mother and sisters … and even in the way he honors the memory of his own mother. And let me tell you, I was completely engrossed in her journals that he and Raegan get to read during the trip, journals that tell a beautiful and at times heartbreaking story of a different kind of sisterhood. I thought this was a brilliant plot device on the author’s part because it served as a poignant parallel to the dichotomy between closeness and distance in the current sisterhood and because it also made Micah’s mom an important supporting character, even in her physical absence.\n\nBottom Line: The Roads We Follow by Nicole Deese takes readers on a gorgeously-rendered journey through a heap of complex family dynamics to grace-propelled authenticity and healing. At the same time, it also treats us to a sweet-and-swoony romance between two dynamic characters with lots to lose but even more to gain. The characters sent me into a range of emotional reactions – laughter, tears, grins, frustration, contemplation, fanning – and Deese once again proves how talented she is at crafting such vivid characters with such layered stories. And only she could take country music, a road trip, a stack of journals, a tell-all manuscript, yurts, Goo-Goo cluster pjs, and The Wizard of Oz … and turn them into an unputdownable and beautiful reflection of Jesus. Move this one to the top of your TBR list right now – it can be read just fine as a standalone so there’s no reason to delay!\n\n(I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book which I received from the publisher.
