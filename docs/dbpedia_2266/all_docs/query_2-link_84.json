        "text": "Hello, reading friends! When I said back in my May in Review post that the heat had hit Atlanta, I had no idea how much hotter it would get. Ugh. So over summer. Bring on fall! As usual, the end of the month means it’s time for my June 2024 in Review post where I look at the books I read and reviewed in that time period.\n\nOh my word, I read SO MANY FANTASTIC BOOKS in June, with several 5-star reviews again too because I read a lot of books that made me want to stand up & applaud at the end. The books I read in June also represent a wide mix – cozy mysteries, romantic suspense, historical fiction/romance and contemporary fiction/romance, as well as a young adult novel and a couple of picture books. All total, in June 2024 I read and reviewed twenty-two books! These are listed in the order I reviewed them, with snippets of my reviews (in case you missed some), and the ones I haven’t reviewed yet will be at the end.\n\nAnd looking ahead, my review calendar is full again in July, including some books I’m giddy to read. Like, What We Hide by Colleen Coble & Rick Acker, Meeting Her Match by Jen Turano, Cold Vengeance by Nancy Mehl, Queen of Hearts by Heather Day Gilbert, and A Cup of Flour A Pinch of Death by Valerie Burns, and more!\n\nHIDDEN IN THE NIGHT by Elizabeth Goddard // Romantic Suspense\n\nHidden in the Night by Elizabeth Goddard is a pulse-pounding romantic suspense that uses the wild elements of Alaska to ramp up the tension, an ever-evolving roster of pursuers and villains to keep you frantically turning the pages, a sweet romance to uplift your heart, and moving faith threads to remind you of the Source of our help. The characters – new and familiar – are engaging and relatable and the various plot threads fit together seamlessly. I have very much enjoyed Elizabeth Goddard’s Missing in Alaska series, and while I’m sad to say goodbye to these characters Hidden in the Night was a lovely way to do so. I was solidly invested in this story, and I highly recommend this whole series!\n\nWHEN PLANS GO AWRY by Denise M. Colby // Historical Western Romance\n\nWhen Plans Go Awry by Denise M. Colby is a winsome debut novel that hooked me from the beginning and kept both my attention & my heart engaged until the end. As the town of Washton embraces Olivia like family, readers will be drawn to wonderful supporting characters like the Martins and the Woodwards, Pastor Will, Uncle Jimmy, Olivia’s students, and of course Bert the rooster. Bert (the rooster in question) may only be a supporting character in When Plans Go Awry but he totally steals the show. This quirky town mascot takes our heroine Olivia under his… well… wing (lol) in the most fun and endearing of ways. Luke and Olivia’s budding romance involves the perfect blend of breathless anticipation and sweet friendship, and the author’s witty writing voice makes it even more entertaining to follow. Fans of Karen Witemeyer, Regina Jennings, and Mary Connealy will feel right at home in When Plans Go Awry!\n\nONE LAST CHANCE by Susan May Warren // Romantic Suspense 5 stars\n\nIn One Last Chance, Susan May Warren takes readers on a bumpy and completely compelling ride full of danger, mystery, surprise turns, romance, family, friendship, and faith. Let’s just say she keeps the local hospital hopping with daring rescues, close calls, and the fact that our hero & heroine are stuck in a killer’s crosshairs. Make sure you, dear reader, are also taking appropriate precautions in case you don’t remember to breathe from the pulse-pounding suspense or you find yourself in a swoon from the wowza kisses. This book really should come with a hazard warning for all of the above reasons but what a way to go! I loved book one but wow … One Last Chance just became my favorite. So far. Because I have a feeling that Moose and London’s respective stories are going to have my full attention as well.\n\nTHE METROPOLITAN AFFAIR by Jocelyn Green // Historical Romance\n\nThe Metropolitan Affair by Jocelyn Green fully immersed me in the captivating world of 1920s New York City, Egyptomania, and Prohibition, entertaining me with a multi-dimensional story and characters I loved rooting for. Lauren and Joe’s unique beginning to their friendship provides the perfect foundation for their renewed connection and reawakened feelings. Their romance is both sweet and swoony, as is their respect for each other and the way they build each other up, and it perfectly complements the historical and mystery elements to the story too. Meaningful threads of belonging, pride, extravagance, jealousy, forgiveness, and the deep love of God also touched me. All of it together, plus the various NYC settings, puts readers right in the narrative and keeps them invested in the outcome. The perfect choice for fans of Elizabeth Camden!\n\nTHE HUDSON COLLECTION by Jocelyn Green // Historical Romance\n\nOnce again, Jocelyn Green completely immersed me in the world of 1920s New York along with an eccentric estate full of preserved birds (and greedy relatives), and a mystery of medieval proportions. Not only did I love Elsa and Luke and their tender romance, but a host of supporting characters like Tom, Tatiana, Danielle, Barney, and even the late Birdie herself also captured my heart. The message that every person is skillfully created and wholly loved by God became even more resonate when considering the contrast between these wonderful characters and the horror of the eugenics movement that considered them each ‘less than’ in some way. Luke and Elsa’s love story fits perfectly alongside the historical layers and mystery elements that Green incorporates into The Hudson Collection, and I found myself thoroughly entertained as well as challenged. Looking forward to Ivy’s story!\n\nMOONLIGHT ON THE MISSISSIPPI by Stephenia H. McGee // Historical Romance\n\nSnakes and saltwater, what a delightful book this was! With Moonlight on the Mississippi, Stephenia H. McGee takes readers on a treasure hunt with danger lurking and romance brewing. Fabulously layered characters bring humor and heart to the mix (just wait until you meet the adorably precocious Lucas), and I loved the interactions with each one. I even found myself liking one of the villains, thanks to McGee’s multidimensional approach to his journey. Along those lines… the faith thread, including the reminder that “Although the voyage wasn’t always smooth, God remained steadfast” is presented naturally and honestly, and I appreciated the added depth. Like with The River Queen, while the main plot threads are all wrapped up, the door is open for potentially more stories here – and I’m curious as to whether the first two books will end up being more tied together than we think when book three arrives. Either way, Moonlight on the Mississippi is a grand and entertaining adventure with great characters, meaningful insight, and a warm & witty writing voice!\n\nCLOVER COVERED CORPSE by Jackie Layton // Cozy Mystery\n\nClover Covered Corpse by Jackie Layton is warmly written with lovely characters and a clever mystery. Poison, pyramid schemes, and plot twists keep readers invested in the outcome, and the growing romance between Jake and Emma adds a dash of extra swoon & sweetness (which I loved) without taking over the story. While I did think the book could have been several chapters shorter (it sometimes felt like we were going over the same stuff again), I still stayed immersed in the investigation and actively guessing whodunit (even if I was all wrong in the end). Another enjoyable visit to Lutz, Texas, and Emma’s flower farm… and another murder solved! A good choice for fans of the Potting Shed Mysteries by Marty Wingate or the Domestic Diva Mysteries by Krista Davis!\n\nKATHARINE’S REMARKABLE ROAD TRIP by Gail Ward Olmsted // Biographical Historical Fiction (mild content warning)\n\nKatharine’s Remarkable Road Trip by Gail Ward Olmsted highlights the later days of a little-talked-about but fascinating spitfire of a woman. In fact, even though the focus of this novel is a fictional solo trip from Rhode Island to New Hampshire at the turn of the century, it could just as easily have been titled ‘Katharine’s Remarkable Life’. The warmth of the writing draws you immediately in to the story, and Katharine’s delightful personality keeps you turning the pages. If you’re a fan of biographical fiction that brings obscure historical figures to life for you, then you must read Katharine’s Remarkable Road Trip!\n\nHOME IN A LUNCHBOX by Cherry Mo // Children’s Picture Book 5 stars\n\nWhat Home in a Lunchbox by Cherry Mo conveys with only a few words will linger in my heart for a long time. Thanks to the vibrant illustrations that capture Jun’s emotions and struggles so poignantly, as well as the little details that point to her home culture, it doesn’t need a lot of text to speak volumes. I loved the warmth that home represents to adorable Jun, the comforting power of familiar food and a mother’s hug, and I especially appreciated the way that Jun’s lunch – so different from that of her peers – is the catalyst to new friendships and not a negative. This is certainly a beautiful and emotional look at the immigrant experience – and an important tool to foster compassion and education – but it’s relatable to all children on a deeper level, too. Every time I look through it, I find something new to love. Home in a Lunchbox is touching, sweet, and simply gorgeous – a wonderful addition to anyone’s home/school/church library. I’m glad it’s in mine.\n\nBORN OF GILDED MOUNTAINS by Amanda Dykes // Historical Fiction 5 stars\n\nBorn of Gilded Mountains by Amanda Dykes is a richly written story of best friends, hidden treasure, lost loves, wounded dreams, and found family. It’s a tale of adventure, mystery, and faith with a dash of romance and Old Hollywood to give it an almost fairy tale feeling in the midst of disappointed realities. This contrast moved me on more than one occasion, as did the layered characters who came alive on the pages and leaped into my heart. Oh the characters! Each of the main and supporting players positively delighted me and touched me, and I am already longing to spend more time in their presence. I loved the way Dykes peppered the narrative with articles, interviews, telegrams, screenplays, and of course letters. So many little details, crafted with perfection and tenderness, make this a story you can sink your heart into, one that will stay with you long after you’ve savored the last word… and leave you different than you were when you read the first.\n\nHER DARKEST SECRET by Jessica R. Patch // Psychological Thriller 5 stars\n\nHer Darkest Secret by Jessica R Patch is chilling and creepy and compelling – an alliteration trifecta that, when added together with Patch’s masterful plotting (complete with several surprises!), layered character development, and thoughtful faith notes, produces a novel you will eagerly lose yourself in from start to finish. There is deep darkness and brokenness portrayed in this story, yes, but there is also goodness and healing – and the presence of the Light of the world shining into that same darkness. This is the hope we have as followers of Jesus – light in the darkness – and Patch reflects that so well on these pages without sacrificing the tension of the suspense. Absolutely wonderful read in every way!\n\nA CRY IN THE DARK by Jessica R. Patch // Psychological Thriller 5 stars\n\nA Cry in the Dark by Jessica R Patch has it all – high-stakes suspense, surprising twists, a deliciously creepy inn, compelling character arcs, layered faith themes, and even some sweet romance (which you know I’m here for). The case is chilling and gruesome, and the clan mentality that rules some areas of Appalachia added to the feeling that the killer(s) could have been anyone. Combined with some ‘everyone knows about it but no one is talking about it’ local criminal enterprises … and the stunning links to Violet’s past… and the ever-present sense of danger … needless to say, I was captivated by every word. To add icing on the cake, Patch takes Violet on an authentic journey toward Jesus, one that is refreshingly devoid of pat answers and not afraid to wrestle with the tough stuff. Another complete winner in this series!\n\nTHE GARDEN GIRLS by Jessica R. Patch // Psychological Thriller 5 stars\n\nJessica R Patch gets better and better and better, and The Garden Girls is hands down one of her best. The evil in these pages is horrifying and demented (as evil often is), but the contrasting redemption in these pages is life-giving. Through an incredibly brilliant plot (which will keep you on the edge of your seat and barely daring to breathe) and equally brilliant character development, the author uses a riveting story to tell an even greater one – about One who sees us at our worst yet loves us infinitely better than anyone else ever could… One who will one day redeem this broken world and exchange it for a place where sin, death, and darkness no longer exist. I finished this book in complete awe of Patch’s talent, and I highly recommend this whole series!\n\nROCKY MOUNTAIN JOURNEY by Misty M. Beller // Historical Western Romance\n\nRocky Mountain Journey by Misty M. Beller is full of adventure, discoveries, faith, hope, and love, all wrapped up in an entertaining story that touches your heart too. Faith and Grant are layered characters who come alive under Beller’s talented pen, and I so enjoyed my time with them. I also loved seeing characters from Calm in the Mountain Storm, reuniting with characters I’ve loved during this entire Sisters of the Rockies series, and tying up several character arcs we’ve followed across all three books too. I am hopeful that maybe (please, please, please) we’ll get a novella or some sort of followup to Rosemary & White Horse’s relationship, but even if we never do the author gives us enough hints to let us fill in the blanks on our own. But I love White Horse so much – their honorary brother – and I want all the details of his happily-ever-after too! Misty M. Beller is an auto-read for me, every single time, and Rocky Mountain Journey proves why. Looking forward to anything/everything she writes next!\n\nHER PART TO PLAY by Jenny Erlingsson // Contemporary Romance\n\nHer Part to Play is Jenny Erlingsson’s debut novel but wow! The authentic-feeling character development, the rich layers to the plot, the tender progression of the romance, and the beauty of the faith threads all read like she has multiple published novels under her belt. The multicultural cast of characters was a highlight for me, as was the personal and lived-out (but still room to grow) faith of both Adanne and John. And the romance… oh dear readers… the romance is everything fairy tale and sweet and ‘I forgot to breathe’. The way they see each other for their real selves just filled my heart with joy, particularly in how John truly sees Adanne’s worth and beauty and talent. I cannot wait to see what Jenny Erlingsson writes next, and if you’re a fan of authors like Toni Shiloh and Carolyn Miller, you definitely need to read Her Part to Play too!\n\nTOWARD THE DAWN by Mary Connealy / Historical Western Romance\n\nToward the Dawn by Mary Connealy combines wit, romance, friendship, danger, and the grace of God into an entertaining adventure with a heap of engaging characters. Not only do we get to follow Seb & Kat’s marriage-of-convenience and their fight for survival against those that want to harm them, we also get to check in with the rest of the group who remained at the hidden canyon compound. (AND I’m pretty sure there is a cameo from someone related to Connealy’s Montana Marriages trilogy which delights me!) Babies and injuries and familiar guests (including one just as wary of them as they are of her) start the stirrings of first steps in ending the ongoing arc with Beth’s evil father once and for all… and I can’t wait to see how it’s all resolved!\n\nNOT FINISHED YET by Sharon Garlough Brown // Children’s Picture Book\n\nMuch like the Biblical psalms sort through the writer’s sometimes-raw emotions with honest acknowledgment, Not Finished Yet by Sharon Garlough Brown teaches children how to do the same with God in prayer. Not only that, it also shows them that prayer isn’t limited to church or kneeling by the bed or saying flowery words – a conversation between you and God can happen while you’re doing fun things like painting with your grandmother in her art studio. I really loved the depiction – both in the text and in Jessica Linn Evans’ sweet illustrations – of Wren & Gran’s relationship, and I so appreciated the content of this book. Definitely would make a good gift and/or a wonderful addition to any home, school, or church library.\n\nBITTER AND SWEET by Rhonda McKnight // Contemporary Women’s Fiction\n\nFrom the rich cadence of the Gullah dialect (and its food) to the beautifully meaningful multi-generational elements and everything in between, Rhonda McKnight has once again crafted a layered novel that speaks right to the heart with characters who will linger there for a long while. Bitter and Sweet tackles a variety of complex issues like postpartum depression, divorce, grief, unwed pregnancy, passing (as White), and even the struggle of Black people (especially women) under the Jim Crow era in the early 20th century. (I learned even more by reading the author’s note at the end and want to continue learning about this.) But at the same time, the rhythm of this story settles around you like a warm hug, points you to Jesus (and therapy), leaves you smarter and hopefully more empathetic, and keeps you deeply invested with each new chapter. Add in some swoony romance, a lowcountry vibe, and strong women with whom you can be proud to claim a sisterhood… and Bitter and Sweet will join the ranks of The Thing About Home as a novel I will savor for some time to come.\n\nTRUTH BE TOLD by Patricia Raybon // Historical Mystery 5 stars\n\nTruth Be Told by Patricia Raybon is a multifaceted novel that can be enjoyed on several different levels. On the one hand, it’s a fascinating mystery with complex layers and clever red herrings that roped me in, kept me guessing, and ultimately took me by surprise. On the other hand, it’s a swoony and incredibly tender romance between Annalee and Jack, one that’s been simmering since book one and continues to march toward a forever kind of relationship (one that I’m cheering loudly for). Still deeper, this is a thoughtful and sometimes raw spotlight on a painful period of history, one where ‘good people’ looked the other way as horrendous sins were committed against image bearers of God, allowing evil to look as though it would triumph. But it’s also an altar call for Hope, for repentance, for ‘boots on’ toward justice, and God’s truth. This is a story that engaged my emotions and entertained me, while also leaving me different at the end than I was at the beginning. Brava, Ms. Raybon! Onward!\n\nYESTERDAY NOW AND ALWAYS by Sara Beth Williams // Contemporary Romance\n\nYesterday Now and Always by Sara Beth Williams is a sweet romance with great characters and a charming setting. I always enjoy the US/New Zealand/Australian combination of cultures (and accents!) in the community of Trinity Lakes, and this book is no exception. Jake and Audrey’s love story has been a long time coming, but they are such a beautiful picture of God ‘restoring the years that the locust have eaten’ when they position their hearts to allow Him to do so. If you’re looking for a story that will uplift & challenge you as well as entertain, check out Yesterday Now and Always!\n\nA GAME MOST FOUL by Alison Gervais // Young Adult Paranormal Mystery (mild content warning)\n\nA Game Most Foul by Alison Gervais is an incarnation of Holmes and Watson like you’ve never seen before, a bit of the paranormal wrapped in mystery with a couple of stunning twists. The trio of Jules, Percy, and Sularthi are easy to picture – and easy to love – as teenagers who become fast friends who are drafted into service as amateur sleuths with the mysterious disappearance of their classmate. This is mostly a light and entertaining read that doesn’t require a lot of emotional investment or mental energy (and I mean that as a compliment) until those twists hit and then you’ll sit up and engage with the story on a whole other level. And while I wasn’t entirely satisfied with the ending, I would definitely read a sequel to see if a couple of loose ends (in my opinion) are tied up and explored further.\n\nEASIER DEAD THAN DRAWN by Bailee Abbott // Cozy Mystery (mild content warning)\n\nEasier Dead Than Drawn by Bailee Abbott is a murder mystery full of artistic rivalries and small town drama. Likable sisters – and business partners – Chloe and Izzie are a good sleuthing team too, and their respectively different personalities make for entertaining dynamics in all three of those aspects to their relationship. I enjoyed the dash of romance for each sister, and I also liked their family members that we get to meet – including Chloe’s dog Max. The mystery is well-plotted and, even though in the end it did come down to my ‘top two’ suspects, that’s all I got right. The big reveal in this case isn’t the ‘same old, same old’ routine and as a frequent reader of the genre I appreciated the slight change of pace. A nice, light read with relatable characters and interesting layers!\n\nWhat about you? What were some great books you read in June? Which of my June 2024 in Review titles have you read?"
