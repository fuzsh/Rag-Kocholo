        "text": "What's the Ultimate Goal?\n\nThe goal of neurological rehabilitation is to improve the functional abilities of patients with neurological impairments or disabilities and to help them regain as much independence as possible. Neurological rehabilitation may involve the use of various therapies, such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and psychological counseling. It may also involve the use of assistive devices, such as wheelchairs, braces, and walkers.\n\nWhat Does the Process Entail?\n\nNeurological rehabilitation is often a long and slow process. The amount of time it takes to recover from a neurological impairment or disability depends on the severity of the condition. Some patients may see a significant improvement in their condition after just a few months of rehabilitation, while others may take years to recover."
