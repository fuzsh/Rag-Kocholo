This program is offered in conjunction with the conventional SCBGP.\n\nThe intent of this program is to provide a process for participation for organizations that have been historically underrepresented in the Block Grant process.\n\nEligibility for the Additional Assistance Program includes non–profit organizations, Tribal governments and K–12 school districts that have not previously received SCBGP funding, do not have expertise with grant writing, and that work directly in either supporting underserved and beginning farmers or providing access to specialty crops in underserved communities."
