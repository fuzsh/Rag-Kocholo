        "text": "Happy hump day and welcome to another installment of my midweek feature, in which I’m taking a closer look at songs I’ve only mentioned in passing or not covered at all to date. Today’s pick falls into the first category and takes me back to the very beginning of my music journey while growing up in Germany. I was about seven or eight years when I heard Carry On by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young for the first time. I loved it right away!\n\nWritten by Stephen Stills, Carry On first appeared in March 1970 on Déjà Vu, the sophomore studio album by Crosby, Stills & Nash and the trio’s first with Neil Young. The song also came out separately as the B-side to Teach Your Children, the album’s second single released in May of the same year. Radio DJs soon flipped to the B-side, leading to steady airplay of Carry On.\n\nCarry On came together after Graham Nash told Stills the album still needed an opener. Stills ended up combining two songs: Questions, a track he had written and first recorded with his previous band Buffalo Springfield, and a second song that was developed during a jam session a few days earlier. In addition to Stills, that session included his CSN bandmates Nash and David Crosby, who provided their heavenly harmony vocals, as well as drummer Dallas Taylor. On the final recording, Stills did lead and harmony vocals and played all remaining instruments (acoustic guitar, electric guitar, organ, bass, percussion).\n\nCSN/CSNY frequently played Carry On during their live shows. It was included on their live albums 4 Way Street (April 1971) and CSN 2012 (July 2012). Apparently, the song inspired Led Zeppelin. Wikipedia calls out Friends, off their third studio album Led Zeppelin III, pointing to the similar slack-stringed C-tuned acoustic opening. While I can hear some similarity, it’s not an obvious Stairway to Heaven situation. I also haven’t seen any acknowledgment by Messrs. Robert Plant and Jimmy Page. Instead, Plant noted the influence of Indian and Caribbean music he first heard during his childhood. Here’s a live version of Carry On, performed by CSN at Woodstock ’94.\n\nCarry On has been covered by various other artists over the years. SecondHandSongs lists about 20 versions, including vocal and instrumental renditions, most notably Patti Austin (1991) and Timothy B. Schmit (2000). Here’s a neat a version by The Dartmouth Aires, an a cappella group who originally were formed as the Injunaires in 1946 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. This rendition is from a 1994 album titled Truth or Daire.\n\nFollowing are some additional insights from Songfacts:\n\nIn the liner notes of their 1991 boxed set, drummer Dallas Taylor said: “The song was written in the middle of the Deja Vu sessions, when Nash told Stephen they still didn’t have an opener for the album. It was something of a message to the group, since it had become a real struggle to keep the band together at that point. Stephen combined two unfinished songs and stuck them onto a jam we’d had out in the studio a few nights before, me on drums and Stephen on a Hammond B-3 organ. As the track begins I’m playing bass drums and high hat, and Graham is playing congas. Then we go into a 6/8 groove, which is rather obscure – Stephen loved to change gears that way. The sessions would go on all night, sometimes three or four days non-stop. The thing I loved about the studio was you could never tell if it was day or night, and we hid all the clocks so no one knew what time it was.”\n\nAccording to a Graham Nash and Stephen Stills interview with Mojo magazine in 2021, this was the last song written for Deja Vu, their first album with Neil Young in the group. They were walking to the studio from their hotel when Nash said, “We don’t have a suite,” meaning a hotel suite. Stills thought he was talking about a musical suite like “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes” and replied, “I know, we used it for our first record” (Crosby, Stills & Nash).\n\n“I would be shocked if after ‘Suite: Judy Blue Eyes,’ anyone got up and changed the record,” Nash said. “Once you hear that you want to hear the rest.”\n\nStills agreed and immediately had an idea. He recalled to Mojo: “I went back to my room in this horrifying hotel and the next morning I knocked on Graham’s door and said, ‘OK, how’s this?’ And I played him ‘Carry On’ and he went nuts. So we got everybody together in the studio and recorded it.”\n\n“Carry On” has the distinction of appearing on three different US #1 albums. It was first released on Déjà Vu, which hit the top spot on May 16, 1970. Then it appeared on the CSN&Y live album 4 Way Street, #1 on May 15, 1971. Finally it showed up on the compilation So Far, the #1 album on November 2, 1974.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfacts; SecondHandSongs; YouTube, Spotify\n\nRecently, Dave who pens the great A Sound Day blog invited me and some other fellow bloggers back for sharing our thoughts as part of his monthly Turntable Talk feature. Following is my contribution, which first was published on A Sound Day on May 16. The post has been slightly edited to fit the format of this blog.\n\nOnce again, it’s Turntable Talk time. Now in its 26th round, fellow blogger Dave’s monthly series continues to go strong. This time, the topic was great songs about music, whether they express sentiments about music or focus on the life of a specific musician.\n\nWhile there are many examples that fit the above definition, the first song that randomly came to my mind was Sweet Soul Music, a classic first released by Arthur Conley in 1967. The second one I thought of was my pick, R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A. by John Mellencamp, one of my longtime favorite artists.\n\nWritten by Mellencamp, who at the time was still known as John Cougar Mellencamp, R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A. first appeared on his eighth studio album Scarecrow, released in July 1985. This album also happens to mark the start of my Mellencamp musical journey, which I felt was another good reason to pick the song.\n\nR.O.C.K. in the U.S.A, subtitled “A Salute to ‘60s Rock,” also became the album’s third single and its biggest hit. In the U.S., it peaked at no. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. Canadian audiences evidently liked it as well, propelling the song to no. 7 on RPM’s singles chart. Elsewhere, it reached no. 17 in New Zealand and no. 67 in the UK – not bad for a song with a ‘60s retro sound during a time the charts were dominated by new wave and hair metal.\n\nSongfacts explains R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A. tells the story of how rock and roll emerged in America, and how those (now infamous) musicians that were not afraid to take personal risks for the sake of their music became a strong influence on the next generation. It mentions numerous artists and bands, including Frankie Lymon, Bobby Fuller, Mitch Ryder, Jackie Wilson, Shangra La’s, Young Rascals, Martha Reeves and James Brown, who became influences for Mellencamp. Growing up, he listened to their music on AM radio.\n\nInitially, Mellencamp hesitated to include the song on the Scarecrow album, feeling it was too light-hearted compared to other tracks about more serious topics, such as Rain on the Scarecrow about the financial struggles of midwest farmers and Face of the Nation, which addresses the decline of the so-called American Dream and corporate greed. “It was one of those absolute last-split-second decisions,” Mellencamp said in 1986. “I was only including it on the cassette and CD copies of Scarecrow as a bonus party track, but my manager loved the energy of it and I thought, ‘Yeah! What the hell!'”\n\nContrary to Mellencamp’s first manager Tony DeFries, who insisted the last name Mellencamp wasn’t marketable and came up with Johnny Cougar, a name Mellencamp hated, in the case of R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A., the manager got it right. While I know by that time Mellencamp had long parted ways with DeFries and next worked with Rod Stewart’s manager Billy Gaff, I’m not sure Gaff was still in the picture at the time of the Scarecrow album.\n\nR.O.C.K. in the U.S.A. was recorded at Belmont Mall in Belmont, Ind. Mellencamp produced the song under the alias “Little Bastard” together with Don Gehman. Other musicians on the recording included Mike Wanchic (guitars, backing vocals), Larry Crane (guitars, flutophone), John Cascella (keyboards), Sarah Flint (backing vocals), Toby Myers (bass) and Kenny Aronoff (drums).\n\nHere’s a fun live version captured in 1985 at Farm Aid, an annual benefit concert to support American farmers, founded in 1985 by Mellencamp, Willie Nelson and Neil Young.\n\nFollowing are some additional tidbits from Songfacts:\n\nWith R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A…Mellencamp was paying homage, but he was also paying his dues. For example, the late Bobby Fuller’s mention on a Top 10 song, and a platinum album, was enough to revive flagging interest in the artist (as well as get Mellencamp a credit on a Bobby Fuller Four Best-Of album). Said Mellencamp: “When I played in Albuquerque, I think it was, his [Fuller’s] mom and some of his family came down to see me play. They acted like I gave them 60 million dollars just for mentioning his name. They gave me his belt that he died in.”\n\nThe instrumental break in this song is very clever. Mellencamp says the riff was lifted from Neil Diamond’s first hit, “Cherry, Cherry.” When we first hear it, it’s played on an ocarina, which is a small wind instrument of ancient Eastern origins, thought to be 12,000 years old, and often made in the shape of a bird and used to imitate its fluting song. This is a nod to the song “Wild Thing” by The Troggs, which featured an ocarina solo. In Mellencamp’s song, the riff is then played on guitar and later on keyboards, going through various musical forms popular in ’60s rock. In concert, Mellencamp would often bring a fan onstage to dance with him during this section.\n\nIn the months prior to recording Scarecrow, Mellencamp’s band worked their way through nearly a hundred cover songs. Mellencamp hoped that through these covers, they would absorb the stylistic essence of the era through osmosis. Mellencamp’s bassist Toby Myers admitted that, “I thought he was giving us busywork, but he wanted us to understand what made those songs tick so we could put some of that grit into his songs.” The band was surprised by the sheer quantity of different styles that characterized the era. “Take an old Rascals song for example,” Mellencamp said. “There’s everything from marching band beats to soul music to country sounds in one song.”\n\nIn keeping with ’60s hit single tradition, Mellencamp kept this song under three minutes long – it clocks in at 2:54.\n\nLast but not least, here are the song’s lyrics:\n\nThey come from the cities\n\nAnd they come from the smaller towns\n\nBeat up cars with guitars and drummers\n\nGoin crack boom bam\n\nR.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.\n\nR.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.\n\nR.O.C.K. in the U.S.A., Yeah, Yeah!\n\nRockin’ in the U.S.A.\n\nSaid goodbye to their families\n\nSaid goodbye to their friends\n\nWith pipe dreams in their heads\n\nAnd very little money in their hands\n\nSome are black and some are white\n\nAin’t to proud to sleep on the floor tonight\n\nWith the blind faith of Jesus you know that they just might, be\n\nRockin’ in the U.S.A.\n\nHey!\n\nVoices from nowhere\n\nAnd voices from the larger towns\n\nFilled our head full of dreams\n\nTurned the world upside down\n\nThere was Frankie Lyman-Bobby Fuller-Mitch Ryder\n\n(They were Rockin’)\n\nJackie Wilson-Shangra-las-Young Rascals\n\n(They were Rockin’)\n\nSpotlight on Martha Reeves\n\nLet’s don’t forget James Brown\n\nRockin’ in the U.S.A.\n\nRockin’ in the U.S.A.\n\nHey!\n\nR.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.\n\nR.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.\n\nR.O.C.K. in the U.S.A., Yeah, Yeah!\n\nRockin’ in the U.S.A.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfacts; YouTube\n\nI make no bones about it – my decision to get a ticket for Neil Young & Crazy Horse a few months ago was driven by my emotions for an artist I’ve loved for 40-plus years; and the thought this may be my second and final chance to see him after a great 2018 solo gig in Boston. The fact this would be a first with Neil’s long-time backing band Crazy Horse was icing on the cake. Showtime finally came on Wednesday (May 15), at Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, a venue with a storied past, where the likes of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix performed. And what a rock fest it was, despite dicey weather!\n\nAs I usually do leading up to a gig, I checked recent setlists of the Love Earth Tour on Setlist.fm and live footage on YouTube. The sets looked very promising, pointing to many classics I could expect to hear. YouTube footage was more of a mixed bag, especially when it came to Young’s vocals, so I decided to adjust my expectations. Fortunately, Young’s voice turned out to be much better than I had anticipated. Even the weather gods largely cooperated. It was raining while entering the venue and waiting for the show and, as such, my waterproof rain poncho came in handy, but the precipitation largely stopped by the time Neil Young & Crazy Horse hit the stage.\n\nA few words about Crazy Horse before getting to some music. While Young’s longtime on-and-off backing band since 1969 were a secondary consideration when purchasing my ticket, like many other fans, I had assumed Nils Lofgren would be part of the Love Earth Tour, along with bassist Billy Talbot and drummer Ralph Molina. But only two-thirds of that line-up were there, with Micah Nelson filling in for Lofgren as the second guitarist. To say it right away, Micah, a son of Willie Nelson, did a great job!\n\nBased on commentary I saw on the Internet, I wasn’t the only fan who when they purchased their ticket didn’t realize Lofgren would still be on the road with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. Not even AI could have fixed the challenge of being in two places at the same time! Obviously, Lofgren’s schedule was known to the Love Earth organizers when tickets for the tour went on sale, yet I don’t recall seeing any mention of it. I think it would have been better to be transparent about Lofgren’s absence.\n\nThe Love Earth stage setup featured cool oversized props of guitar amps and road cases, which an article in Young’s online paper NYA Times Contrarian notes were “immortalized” in the 1979 documentary Rust Never Sleeps. Molina’s drum kit was on a riser placed between the giant amp props. A large black banner featuring a white running horse served as the stage backsplash. A minor wrinkle: No jumbotrons, which made it impossible to see the artists up-close for folks in the back, including this blogger.\n\nMirroring past Neil Young & Crazy Horse concerts, the set included a mix of electric full-band songs, which hugged a portion featuring Young solo on acoustic guitar and harmonica. Most of the music drew from ’70s and late ’60s albums, such as Everybody Knows This is Nowhere (1969), Zuma (1975) and Rust Never Sleeps (1979). Ragged Glory (1990) was also prominently represented. Additionally, there was music from Young solo albums, including Harvest (1972), Tonight’s the Night (1975) and Comes a Time (1978). The biggest surprise to me was Heart of Gold. While that’s Young’s biggest hit, I recall reading previous commentary from him that he wouldn’t perform that song.\n\nLet’s take a look at some clips. Conditions for filming weren’t ideal, and the sound was better than what I captured. But I still hope the footage will give you an idea of the concert. After the epic opener Cortez the Killer unleashed the Horse, it was time for Cinnamon Girl. The classic track is from Young’s second studio album Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere and his first with Crazy Hose, released in May 1969.\n\nOne of my all-time favorite Neil Young songs is Powderfinger. It first appeared on the Rust Never Sleeps album with Crazy Horse, which came out in June 1997. That album was mostly recorded live with overdubs added in the studio.\n\nThen it was time for Young’s solo acoustic set. Here’s the first song, Comes a Time, the title track off his October 1978 solo album.\n\nOne of two tour debuts was Sugar Mountain, another song by Young I’ve always loved. He composed it on his 19th birthday. The first known recording, from December 1965, is included on Young’s 2009 compilation The Archives Vol. 1 1963–1972. The song’s first released version is a live recording, which became the B-side to his 1969 single The Loner. Last but not least, the first album version was included on the excellent October 1977 compilation Decade.\n\nOf course, I couldn’t skip the set’s closer Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black). This epic song first appeared on the aforementioned Rust Never Sleeps album.\n\nLast but not least, here’s the first encore: Like a Hurricane, off American Stars ‘n Bars, another album Young made with Crazy Horse, released in May 1977. It was a perfect end to a great show. Perhaps the only song that could have trumped it would have been Rockin’ In the Free World, which they played as one of two encores Tuesday night at the same venue.\n\nHere’s the setlist from Wednesday night. Based on Setlist.fm, most of it has remained constant, but Neil has made frequent tweaks, so in case you are going to catch him at an upcoming date, you likely won’t exactly get what you see below.\n\nSetlist\n\n• Cortez the Killer\n\n• Cinnamon Girl\n\n• Fuckin’ Up\n\n• Down by the River\n\n• Scattered (Let’s Think About Livin’)\n\n• Roll Another Number (For the Road)\n\n• Don’t Cry No Tears\n\n• Mansion on the Hill (tour debut)\n\n• Danger Bird\n\n• Powderfinger\n\n• Love and Only Love\n\n• Comes a Time (Young solo acoustic)\n\n• Heart of Gold (Young solo acoustic)\n\n• Human Highway (Young solo acoustic)\n\n• I Am a Child (Buffalo Springfield cover) (Young solo acoustic)\n\n• Sugar Mountain (Young solo acoustic; tour debut)\n\n• Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\n\nEncore\n\n• Like a Hurricane\n\n• Roll Another Number (For the Road) (Reprise)\n\nIf you dig Neil Young and want in it appears there may still be some tickets available. I imagine a good deal are for resale, so not sure about prices at this time. Neil and the Horse continue their ride this evening in Mansfield, Mass, followed by Bridgeport, Conn., tomorrow (May 18); Toronto, Ontario (May 20); Clarkston, Mich. (May 22); Chicago, Ill. (May 23); and Austin, Texas (May 27). The full schedule is here.\n\nLast but not least, now that Neil has returned to Spotify, I’m leaving you with a Spotify playlist that mirrors the above setlist.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; NeilYoungArchives.com; Setlist.fm; YouTube; Spotify\n\nIt’s hard to believe some five weeks have passed since the last installment of my monthly recurring feature about music producers and sound engineers. In this post, I’d like to take a closer look at Daniel Lanois, a name I first encountered in connection with my favorite U2 album The Joshua Tree, which he co-produced with Brian Eno. In addition to who Rolling Stone called the “most important record producer to emerge in the Eighties,” Lanois is also an accomplished musician with a sizable catalog of solo and collaboration albums. Given this feature’s topic, I’m only focusing on his production work, which leaves more than enough to cover!\n\nDaniel Lanois (born Daniel Roland Lanois on September 19, 1951) grew up in Hull, Quebec, which his bio describes as a Canadian town “best known for gambling and drinking”. While his family was poor, it provided a foundation that seemingly was a destination for music. His father played the fiddle, his mother sang, and his parents, uncles, aunts and other family members regularly gathered to play music together. As a child, Lanois listened to Motown, R&B, rock & roll and psychedelic music, and by the time he was in high school, he already knew music would be his career.\n\nAt age 17, before he even finished school, he and his older brother Bob Lanois set up a studio in the basement of their mother’s home. That was in Ancaster, Ontario, to where she had relocated with the boys after the separation from her husband. Among the first local artists the brothers produced were rock band Simply Saucer. Daniel’s bio notes he built a reputation “as someone who could work the studio but thought as a musician.”\n\nDuring the ’70s Lanois developed his technical skills as a producer. In 1976, he co-founded Grant Avenue Studio, together with his brother and Bob Doidge, who eventually became the sole owner in 1985 before selling it to two partners in early 2023. Toward the end of the ’70s, Lanois came to the attention of Brian Eno who recruited him to assist on Eno’s ambient series of albums. Their professional relationship led to Eno’s invitation to co-produce The Unforgettable Fire, the first of five U2 albums on which they worked together.\n\nLanois’ early work with U2 led to production assignments with other top artists, such as Peter Gabriel, Bob Dylan, Emmylou Harris, Willie Nelson and Neil Young. His production style, which has been characterized for its ‘big’ and ‘live’ drum sound, atmospheric guitars and ambient reverb, has served him well. To date, Lanois has won seven Grammy awards and received 15 nominations. In 2005, he was inducted into Canada’s Walk of Fame. He also received a lifetime achievement award in June 2013 at the annual Governor General’s Performing Arts Award. Time for samples of Lanois’ production work.\n\nI’d like to kick it off with an early production effort: an album by the aforementioned Simply Saucer, for which Lanois initially co-produced demo material with his brother in 1974. The music wasn’t released until 1989 under the title Cyborgs Revisited when it was combined with material from a 1975 live recording. Here’s Electro Rock from the ’74 demo. While it’s very different from what was to come, I find that raw punk sound with a psychedelic touch charming – reminds me a bit of early Pink Floyd.\n\nNext I’d like to jump to February 1983 and Danseparc, the fourth studio album by Canadian new wave band Martha and the Muffins. They are best known for their 1980 international hit single Echo Beach. Danseparc was the second album Lanois co-produced for the group after 1981’s This Is the Ice Age. Here’s Danseparc (Everyday Day It’s Tomorrow).\n\nOf course, I couldn’t skip a song off The Joshua Tree, U2’s fifth studio album from March 1987, and the second Lanois co-produced with Eno. The majestic With or Without You became the first single. “The making of that started with a beatbox – an available Yamaha beatbox that we had,” Lanois told Songfacts during an April 2021 interview. “Then we came up with a chord sequence. Adam [Clayton] played a lovely bass part. And then we had a little secret weapon. It was called the “infinite sustain guitar,” invented by my good friend Michael Brook, a Canadian associate. Michael had invented this instrument where you didn’t have to use your right hand on the guitar. You just held a note with your left hand, and he had a little self-looping system built into the instrument, which caused it to go into this [sings guitar part].”\n\nI think it’s fair to say Lanois’ magnificent co-productions of U2’s The Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree changed his trajectory. In 1986, Robbie Robertson worked with Lanois to co-produce his self-titled solo debut album, which came out in October 1987. Somewhere Down the Crazy River has been one of my favorites for a long time. “Robbie Robertson was describing what it was like to hang out in Arkansas with Levon Helm in his old neighbourhood,” Lanois recalled. “He was telling me about the hot nights and fishing with dynamite, and was asking someone for directions for someplace somewhere down the crazy river.” Lanois went on, “I had presented him with this instrument that [Brian] Eno introduced me to called the Suzuki Omnichord, like an electric autoharp. He found a little chord sequence with it that was sweet and wonderful. As he was developing his chord sequence I recorded him and superimposed his storytelling, which I was secretly recording, on top. That was the birth of ‘Somewhere Down The Crazy River.’ It’s kind of like a guy with a deep voice telling you about steaming nights in Arkansas.”\n\nIn 1995, Emmylou Harris decided to move away from her traditional acoustic toward a more atmospheric sound – and to work with Daniel Lanois and sound engineer Mark Howard. The result was Wrecking Ball, her 18th studio album that came out in September 1995. Here’s the beautiful opener Where Will I Be, which has a noticeable U2 vibe.\n\nGiven Lanois’ extensive and impressive production credits, I could go on and on. But his post is already getting pretty long, so the last album I’d like to touch on is Time Out of Mind. Bob Dylan’s 30th studio album from September 1997 is recognized as an artistic comeback for Dylan. It also marked his first album of original material since 1990’s Under the Red Sky. Here’s the stunning Make You Feel My Love. This send chills down my spine!\n\nI’m leaving you with a Spotify playlist that features the above songs and some additional tracks from albums produced or co-produced by Daniel Lanois.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Daniel Lanois website; Songfacts; YouTube; Spotify\n\nToday, another classic ’70s rock gem turns 50. On April 15, 1974, Lynyrd Skynyrd released their sophomore album Second Helping. To the casual listener, it’s best known for Sweet Home Alabama, which became the group’s biggest hit single. While it hasn’t exactly suffered from obscurity on radio waves and I still enjoy it, there’s more to the album than its defining song, so let’s take a closer look!\n\nSince I’d like to do this celebratory post in the order of the tracks, ironically, we’re right back to Sweet Home Alabama, the album’s opener. It was co-written by Skynyrd guitarists Ed King and Gary Rossington with lyrics by lead vocalist Ronnie Van Zant, none of whom were from Alabama. The song was a response to Neil Young’s Southern Man, which they felt unfairly had characterized all Southerners as rednecks. Ol’ Neil in subsequent interviews agreed, and despite the public dissing, they remained good friends. Turn it up!\n\nWith one of Skynyrd’s signature songs out of the way (the other one being Free Bird), let’s highlight some of other great great tracks on the album. Don’t Ask Me No Questions, a fun boogie rocker and the album’s first single, was co-written by Van Zant and Rossington. Unlike Sweet Home Alabama, it missed the charts altogether, which is a shame. Yeah, it’s a simple riff and in that sense perhaps less sophisticated than Alabama but rock doesn’t need to be complicated to be neat!\n\nClosing out Side one is Workin’ for MCA. Co-written by King and Van Zant, the song recalls Skynyrd’s signing with the record label. The “Yankee slicker” is Al Kooper, the man who discovered and signed the band, and who produced their first three albums. The reference to “seven years of hard luck” acknowledges Skynyrd’s early period from 1966 to 1973 when they didn’t have a label deal. They also went through a series of names before becoming Leonard Skinnerd in 1969, which subsequently was changed to Lynyrd Skynyrd.\n\nThis brings us to Side two and the great The Ballad of Curtis Loew. Co-written by co-founder and Skynyrd’s third guitarist Allen Collins and Van Zant, the song is about a composite of different people, including Skynyrd lead guitarist Ricky Medlocke‘s grandfather, Shorty Medlocke, according to Songfacts. Medlocke wasn’t part of Skynyrd’s line-up at the time they recorded it. “The original version of the band only played ‘Curtis Loew’ one time on stage,” recalled Ed King. “We were playing in a basement in some hotel and thought we’d try it. We never played it again until the Tribute Tour with Johnny Van Zant.”\n\nThe lyrics of The Needle and the Spoon, a deep cut penned by Collins and Van Zant, leave no doubt what the song is about. Van Zant who was struggling with addictions to heroin and cocaine himself knew what he was writing about. Songfacts notes, In 2015, Guitar World honored guitarist Allen Collins’ solo, and his use of the wah-wah pedal to inject the Southern rock song with a hit of ’70s psychedelia, by ranking it at #19 on the magazine’s list of greatest wah solos of all time.\n\nThis leaves us with one more track, Skynyrd’s great rendition of J.J. Cale’s Call Me the Breeze. Cale included the song on his October 1971 debut album Naturally. Songfacts explains, When Lynyrd Skynyrd covered this song, it once again financed Cale’s lifestyle, allowing him to release albums in a leisurely fashion and without concern for hit potential. Another key supporter was Eric Clapton, who not only helped Cale get his first record deal but who also covered some of the Oklahoma guitarist’s songs, most notably After Midnight.\n\nWhile reviews of Second Helping at the time of its were mixed, contemporary assessments are more favorable. The album climbed to no. 12 in the U.S. on the Billboard 200 and no. 9 in Canada. It also quickly reached Gold status (500,000 certified sold units) in the U.S. by September 1974 and hit 2x Platinum (2 million certified sold units) in July 1987. As such, ranks among Skynyrd’s most successful albums.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfacts; RIAA website; YouTube; Spotify\n\nHappy Sunday and welcome to more music time travel. Picking six tracks from six different decades and different genres in a random fashion feels very liberating and is my favorite activity each week. With that said, let’s do it again!\n\nNat Adderley/Sister Caroline\n\nToday, our little excursion starts in December 1958 with music from Branching Out, an album by jazz cornetist Nat Adderley. After starting to play the trumpet in 1946 as a 15-year-old, Adderley switched to the cornet in 1950. Together with his older brother, saxophonist Julian “Cannonball” Adderley, he co-founded Cannonball Adderley Quintet in 1956 and frequently played with the group until they disbanded in 1975. Adderley also worked with Kenny Clarke, Wes Montgomery, Walter Booker, Ron Carter and Sonny Fortune, among others, and recorded albums as a leader. Branching Out is an example of the latter. Here’s the great Adderley composition Sister Caroline. He was backed by Johnny Griffin (tenor saxophone) and The Three Sounds: Gene Harris (piano), Andy Simpkins (bass) and Bill Dowdy (drums).\n\nJoe Ely/Fingernails\n\nNext we shall kick it up a few notches with some sizzling honky tonk rock & roll by Texas singer-songwriter and guitarist Joe Ely. Fingernails is a neat song fellow blogger Cincinnati Babyhead, aka. CB, recommended to me the other day. Penned by Ely, the track is from his sophomore album Honky Tonk Masquerade, released in February 1978. Ely is generally classified as country, but his music also includes high-energy blues, rockabilly and honky tonk swing. Fingernails sure as heck ain’t no country!\n\nPretenders/Never Do That\n\nIn May 1990, the fifth album by British-American rock group Pretenders came out, and that’s where we’re headed next. Packed! only pictured bandleader Chrissie Hynde on the cover, which was no coincidence. Together with drummer Blair Cunningham, she was the group’s only remaining member. Cunningham had replaced original drummer Martin Chambers in 1986. Chambers returned in 1993 and has played on all subsequent albums except for 2016’s Alone, a Hynde solo effort released under the Pretenders name. From the aforementioned Packed!, here’s the opener Never Do That, written by Hynde. In general, I think it’s great listening to her, and this song is no exception.\n\nPernice Brothers/Bechamel\n\nTime to pay a visit to the current century with Pernice Brothers. I only learned about this indie rock band last week when I featured a song from their new album Who Will You Believe. The group was formed by Joe Pernice in 1998 after his old group Scud Mountain Boys had broken up. Pernice Brothers who also include Joe’s brother Bob Pernice released their first album Overcome by Happiness in May 1998. Bechamel takes us to the band’s July 2010 album Goodbye, Killer.\n\nCarla Thomas/B-A-B-Y\n\nNow I’m in the mood for some Stax soul and hope so are you. In 1966, the Memphis label released the third album by Carla Thomas. In the summer of 1960, the Queen of Memphis Soul had been the first artist to record a single with her father Rufus Thomas in the new Memphis recording facility of the label, which then was still called Satellite. By the time her third album Carla appeared in 1966, Satellite had changed their name to Stax – the first two letters from the founders’ and siblings’ last names (Jim) Stewart and (Astelle) Axton. The opening track B-A-B-Y, co-written by Isaac Hayes and David Porter, also was released separately as a single in July of that year and became one of Thomas’ hits. My kind of music!\n\nNeil Young/Rockin’ in the Free World\n\nI can’t believe we’re once again at the point where we need to wrap things up. Let’s make it count with a true rock anthem by Neil Young, one of my favorite artists: Rockin’ in the Free World, off his 17th studio album Freedom, which came out in October 1989. Freedom relaunched Young’s career after a largely unsuccessful decade. Undoubtedly, this epic track had something to do with it. I’m talking about the electric version that closes Freedom. An acoustic live version of the same song, which I like as well, opens the album.\n\nLast but not least, here’s a Spotify playlist featuring all of the above tracks, including Neil Young who is back on the platform. As always, I hope there’s something you dig. See ya!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube; Spotify\n\nWith so much new music coming out each week, it’s no surprise I can’t keep up. As such, I thought this would be a good time to take a look at some of what I missed during the first half of February.\n\nNeil Young & Crazy Horse/Broken Circle (Over and Over)\n\nNeil Young has unleashed the horse again and released Broken Circle (Over and Over) on February 15, the first single from F##in’ Up, his cheerfully titled upcoming new album with Crazy Horse that’s set to drop on April 20. The song was first released as Over and Over on Ragged Glory. F##in’ Up is a collection of re-recordings from the Horse’s September 1990 album. “In the spirit it’s offered, we made this for the Horse lovers,” Young explained on his website. He has also announced the Love Earth Tour with Crazy Horse, which will kick off in San Diego on April 24 and travel across North America – dang it, after listening to this song, I’m very tempted!\n\n7th & Hope/Take My Love\n\n7th & Hope is a transatlantic pop duo by Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter Patricia Bahia, who I previously featured here, and UK-based singer-songwriter Betty Lawrence. Their new single Take My Love is a pretty song about offering unconditional love, which has a bit of an Ed Sheeran vibe. Additionally, the acoustic track features 7th & Hope collaborators Cameron Stymeist, who also produced the single, and Nitanee Paris. Released on February 14, Take My Love’s straightforward message couldn’t be more timely during a period when we’re surrounded by so much negativity and hate, especially on the Internet.\n\nRevolution Saints/Against the Winds\n\nWhen I first listened to Against the Winds, the title track of Revolution Saints’ new album released on February 9, I thought this sounds a bit like Journey – turns out I was on to something. This rock supergroup includes Journey drummer and vocalist Deen Castronovo, along with Joel Hoekstra (Whitesnake guitarist), Jeff Pilson (bassist of glam metal band Dokken) and Italian keyboarder, singer, record producer and songwriter Alessandro Del Vecchio. Including their self-titled 2015 debut, Revolution Saints have released five albums to date. I find this neat melodic rock very accessible! If you’re into Journey, there’s no way you won’t dig this!\n\nSheryl Crow/Do It Again\n\nSheryl Crow has released another single from her forthcoming new album Evolution scheduled for March 29. Do It Again was penned by Crow and John Shanks who previously also co-wrote Steve McQueen and Real Gone. In a Facebook announcement Crow explained Do It Again came together pretty quickly during a visit by Shanks and is “about a journey in figuring out who you are.” Musically, it’s classic Sheryl Crow and reminds me a tiny bit of her 1994 breakthrough single All I Wanna Do. I love it! Crow has a busy year ahead on the road in both Europe and the U.S. She’s another artist I’ve haven’t seen and would love to do so!\n\nMost of Neil Young’s music remains unavailable on Spotify, so the enclosed playlist doesn’t include his new song. Instead, I included an additional track from Revolution Saints’ new album.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Neil Young website; 7th & Hope Facebook page; Sheryl Crow Facebook page; YouTube; Spotify\n\nEarlier this month, I proclaimed this year I would give more attention to music history. And while I still don’t believe in New Year’s resolutions, I thought what the heck and decided to take another dive into the past and see what comes up, this time for January 30!\n\n1958: Jailhouse Rock by Elvis Presley entered the UK Singles Chart at no. 1, the first single ever to debut in the top spot. Presley also holds the distinction of being the solo artist with the most no. 1 songs on that chart, 21 times, including three re-releases of songs that previously had reached the top spot. And, yep, that’s more than The Beatles, the band with the most no. 1 singles in the UK, though there’s a tie when you exclude Presley’s three aforementioned re-released songs. Jailhouse Rock was co-written by the songwriting and production power house of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.\n\n1961: The Shirelles reached the top of the U.S. charts with Will You Love Me Tomorrow, aka. Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?. Not only did the song become the first no. 1 for an African American girl group on the Billboard Hot 100, but it also marked the first big hit for the songwriting duo of Carole King and Gerry Goffin. The Shirelles would return to the top of the U.S. pop chart one more time, in 1962, with Soldier Boy. Ten years after The Shirelles had scored their first no. 1, King would record her own rendition of Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow? for her iconic Tapestry album.\n\n1969: The Beatles performed their last public gig, an impromptu concert on the rooftop of their Apple Corps headquarters in London. Joined by their friend Billy Preston on keyboards, they performed nine takes of five new songs as people gathered in the streets and on rooftops close by to watch and listen: Get Back (three takes), Don’t Let Me Down (two takes), I’ve Got a Feeling (two takes), One After 909 and Dig a Pony. They also played a snippet of God Save the Queen. After about 40 minutes, police ascended the roof, and the concert came to an end shortly thereafter. Fortunately, the historic performance was captured on film. Beatles fans got to see footage in the 1970 documentary Let It Be and Peter Jackson’s 2021 documentary series The Beatles: Get Back. And, yes, they passed the audition!\n\n1971: Neil Young played The Needle and the Damage Done during a concert at UCLA’s Royce Hall. At first sight, it may seem a bit arbitrary to call out a song Young frequently performed at the time, except that this particular take was recorded and ended up on his fourth album Harvest. Released in February 1972, it became Young’s best-selling album and also was the best-selling album of 1972 in the U.S. The Needle and the Damage Done was inspired by musicians addicted to heroin, who Young knew, including his former backing guitarist Danny Whitten who passed away in late 1972.\n\n1988: Australian rockers INXS hit no. 1 in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100 with Need You Tonight. Co-written by the band’s guitarist Andrew Ferris and vocalist Michael Hutchence, the funky song first appeared on their sixth and most successful studio album Kick, released in October 1987. While INXS scored four other top 10 singles on the U.S. pop chart, Need You Tonight was their only no. 1. The song also enjoyed significant chart success elsewhere, including the UK and Canada (each no. 2) and New Zealand and Australia (each no. 3), among others.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfacts Music History Calendar; YouTube\n\n“Any musician with a set of ears was influenced by The Everly Brothers” – Graham Nash\n\nThis post was inspired by a documentary, The Everly Brothers: Harmonies From Heaven, which I coincidentally caught on PBS on New Year’s Eve. From the PBS description: Explore the story of Phil and Don Everly, two of the most important and influential early rock ’n’ roll stars of the 1950s and ’60s. Featuring new interview footage with surviving brother Don and archival interviews with Phil, the film delves into their relationship with Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, the songwriting team who wrote many of their early hits. It also includes commentary from Art Garfunkel, Graham Nash, Waddy Wachtel, Keith Richards and other music artists. Here’s a link to the trailer.\n\nI started listening to The Everly Brothers in my early teens back in Germany, after my brother-in-law had given me a compilation as a present. I still own that copy and was able to find it in my current mess of vinyl albums (see photo below). At the time, Elvis Presley still was my favorite rock & rock artist. As such, initially, I was mostly drawn to songs like Wake Up Little Susie, Rip It Up and Keep a Knockin’. I immediately loved the Everlys’ great harmony vocals. I think calling them “harmonies from heaven” is no exaggeration!\n\nIsaac Donald “Don” Everly and his younger brother Phillip “Phil” Everly grew up in a musical family and began singing with their parents Ike Everly and Margaret Everly in the 1940s when they were still children. In the mid-’40s, Ike who was a coalmine worker had a show on Shenandoah, Iowa radio stations KMA and KFNF. First, he performed there with his wife, then with their sons who were billed as “Little Donnie and Baby Boy Phil”, who at the time were about 8 and 6 years, respectively. Together, they were known as “The Everly Family”.\n\nIn 1953, the family relocated to Tennessee, first to Knoxville, then to Madison. Following high school graduation in 1955, Don moved to Nashville, together with Phil who finished high school there in 1957. The brothers decided they wanted to continue focusing on making music together. Eventually, they came to the attention of family friend Chet Atkins, manager of RCA Studios in Nashville. Atkins helped the brothers get a deal with Columbia Records, but after their first single Keep a-Lovin’ Me flopped, the label dropped them.\n\nAtkins subsequently introduced Phil and Don to Wesley Rose who told them he could get a record deal if they would sign with his music publishing firm Acuff-Rose. The brothers obliged and Rose introduced them to Archie Bleyer, founder of Cadence Records. Phil and Don got signed and recorded their first single for the label, Bye Bye Love, penned by husband-and-wife country and pop songwriting duo Felice Bryant and Diadorius Boudleaux Bryant.\n\nReleased in March 1957, Bye Bye Love became the first of many major hits for The Everly Brothers. In addition to topping the county charts in the U.S., it climbed to no. 2 and no. 5 on the pop and R&B charts, respectively, indicating the duo’s appeal across different music genres. By 1973, tension had built up between the brothers, and they decided to split to pursue solo careers. While Don found some chart success, Phil did not, even though he recorded more frequently.\n\nIn September 1983, Phil and Don reunited as The Everly Brothers at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The concert was recorded and released as The Everly Brothers Reunion Concert later that year. While the live album reached a respectable no. 47 in the UK, it stalled at no. 162 in the U.S. on the Billboard 200. The Everly Brothers subsequently released three additional studio albums in the ’80s. They continued to tour on and off until 2003-2004 when they were guests on Simon & Garfunkel’s Old Friends reunion tour.\n\nPhil Everly passed away from COPD on January 3, 2014 at the age of 75. Don Everly died at his home in Nashville on August 2021. He was 84. Let’s take a closer look at some of The Everly Brothers’ music and those “harmonies from heaven.” I’m going to highlight six of their songs, followed by a larger career-spanning Spotify playlist.\n\nBye Bye Love (March 1957)\n\nNotably, this classic had been rejected by 30 other artists before it was given to The Everly Brothers. “I wrote ‘Bye Bye Love’ while traveling home one night,” noted Boudleaux Bryant. “Felice was driving down the highway and I got the first verse and chorus right down there. I always make sure I have a pen and paper in the car for these occasions.” He went on, “We really believed in the song and were disappointed when so many people turned it down. They said it was unsuitable, some even asked if we has anything better!”\n\nWake Up Little Susie (September 1957)\n\nWake Up Little Susie, another song by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, became the first no. 1 for the Everlys on the U.S. pop chart. It also topped the country and R&B charts, as well as the charts in Canada. In addition to outstanding harmony vocals, the song has a really cool rhythm, which Don Everly said was inspired by Bo Diddley’s signature beat. “And I guess it rubbed off on me,” Keith Richards said in the above documentary. “Don’s acoustic guitar – rockin’, man!”\n\nAll I Have to Do Is Dream (April 1958)\n\nWritten by Boudleaux Bryant alone for a change, All I Have to Do Is Dream became another major hit for The Everly Brothers, toping the pop, country and R&B charts in the U.S. Once again, it reached no. 1 in Canada and became the duo’s first song to top the charts in the UK as well. “I remember hearing ‘All I Have To Do Is Dream’ on an acetate with Boudleaux’s version on it, and I said, at the time, they could have put Boudleaux’s out and it would have been a hit,” Don Everly stated. “It’s just a great, great song. It’s beautiful.” Indeed! BTW, these neat tremolo-style guitar chords were played by Chet Atkins.\n\nCathy’s Clown (April 1960)\n\nWhile Felice and Boudleaux Bryant wrote many hits for the Everlys, the duo also had original songs. One of the most beautiful examples I know is Cathy’s Clown, which Don Everly wrote. Initially, both brothers had been credited until 1980, seven years after Don and Phil had split and I guess still weren’t on great terms. The song, which has been inspired by one of Don’s ex-girlfriends, became the last no. 1 for The Everly Brothers in the U.S., topping both the pop and the R&B charts. Cathy’s Clown was their first single on Warner Bros. after Cadence Records no longer could afford resigning them. They were still on top of the world.\n\nCrying In the Rain (January 1962)\n\nBy the time Crying in the Rain came out, The Everly Brothers had not had a big hit in nearly a year. It already foreshadowed their declining popularity. The ballad was penned by Brill Building songwriters Howard Greenfield and Carole King, who worked for Don Kirshner’s Aldon Music at the time. Kirshner had been eager to produce a hit for The Everly Brothers. He didn’t need to cry in the rain. The song, one of the few King didn’t write with her usual lyricist Gerry Goffin, became the second-to-last top 10 hit for the Everlys on the U.S. pop chart (no. 6) and also reached that same spot in the UK.\n\nOn the Wings of a Nightingale (August 1984)\n\nFor my final pick, I’m jumping 22 years forward to what became the last charting single for the Everlys, reaching no. 50 and no. 41 on the U.S. and U.K. pop charts, respectively. Following their reunion concert in London the previous year, Phil and Don recorded EB 84, their first studio album of original material in 11 years. On the Wings of a Nightingale, which Paul McCartney specifically had written for them, became the lead single. After Phil Everly’s death in 2014, Macca wrote the following on his website, as reported by the Los Angeles Times: “Phil Everly was one of my great heroes. With his brother Don, they were one of the major influences on the Beatles. When John and I first started to write songs, I was Phil and he was Don.”\n\nAltogether, The Everly Brothers scored 35 Billboard Top 100 singles, of which 26 reached the top 40. They hold the record for the most Top 100 singles by any duo, second only to Hall & Oates for the most Top 40 singles by a duo. In the UK, the Everlys had 30 chart singles between 1957 and 1984. In 1986, they were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame by Neil Young, who said every musical group he had ever belonged to had tried, and failed, to copy the Everly Brothers’ harmonies. Here’s the above-mentioned Spotify playlist.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfacts; Los Angeles Times; YouTube; Spotify\n\nIt’s safe to assume most music fans agree that seeing a beloved artist or band live is a special experience. In fact, to me, it’s the ultimate thrill! Nearly every time I go to a concert, big or small, I also get “the itch”, thinking perhaps I should have continued playing music actively. Even though my band days date back more than 30 years, I think I will always remain a musician at heart! As such, it felt right to take a look back on my live music experience in 2023.\n\nHopefully, it doesn’t come across as bragging when I say this year was really busy on the concert front. In fact, I was surprised myself when realizing how many shows I visited. I don’t know, I guess it just happened. Much of it was driven by spontaneous action. I will add that given high ticket prices, especially for prominent acts, I doubt I can keep up that pace next year. For now, let’s focus on some of my favorite concert moments of 2023.\n\nBig ticket/prominent artists and bands I saw this year include Southern Avenue (review), Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band (review), The Reverend Peyton’s Big Damn Band (review), Peter Frampton (review), The Doobie Brothers (review), James Taylor (review) and Los Lobos (review).\n\nIn the following, I’d like to let the music do the talking, or perhaps I should say writing. Going through old clips and pictures I took was a lot of fun. Hope you enjoy my little collage!\n\nSouthern Avenue/Don’t Give Up – SteelStax, Bethlehem, Pa., Sep 7\n\nThe Reverend Peyton’s Big Damn Band/Ways and Means – Lizzie Rose Music Room, Tuckerton, N.J., Aug 17\n\nPeter Frampton/Shine On – Wind Creek Event Center, Bethlehem, Pa., Jul 15\n\nLos Lobos/Kiko and the Lavender Moon – Pollack Theatre, West Long Branch, N.J., Feb 24\n\nCatching prominent music acts I love is great, but as in previous years, my live music experience wasn’t limited to them. Once again, I was also fortunate to see great tributes, such as Sugar Mountain (Neil Young), Who’s Next (The Who), Stiff Upper Lip (AC/DC) and Good Stuff (Steely Dan, Sting, Stevie Wonder & Gino Vannelli), as well as various other bands.\n\nLuckily, a good deal of these “non-big ticket acts” were free and/or very affordable. I believe in supporting live music, but there’s only so much I can do. Otherwise, the hole in my wallet would even be bigger! Here’s a small sample. My apologies for not featuring everybody I saw!\n\nSugar Mountain/Like a Hurricane – Lizzie Rose Music Room, Sep 9\n\nWho’s Next/Won’t Get Fooled Again – British Invasion Festival, Golden Nugget, Atlantic City, N.J., Jul 22\n\nStiff Upper Lip/It’s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock ‘n’ Roll) – Readington Brewery, Readington, N.J., June 9\n\nGood Stuff/Deacon Blues – New Jersey Brewing Company, Mount Olive, N.J., Mar 31\n\nThere you have it. What’s in store for next year? Not much to report yet, except for two events I really hope will happen. First is seeing The Rolling Stones during their Hackney Diamonds Tour at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. on May 23. I’m thrilled I was able to get a ticket I could pay for. Granted, I settled for the least expensive seat. But for a live music nut like me, being there means nearly everything!\n\nI also look forward to Rock the Farm, the main annual fundraiser of the New Jersey nonprofit CFC Loud N Clear Foundation, featuring great tribute acts to raise funds for programs to prevent relapse after drug rehab. Due to bad weather, CFC made the tough but right call to postpone last year’s event until June 1, 2024. I love the idea of music for a cause and have attended this festival on the Jersey shore multiple times over the past six years. My review of Rock the Farm 2022 is here.\n\nAs for the rest of 2024, we’ll see. I guess I’ll take it one show at a time!"
