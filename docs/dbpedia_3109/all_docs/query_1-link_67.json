        "text": "One of the things I’ve been researching are Bonnie’s show dates / itinerary. Her website lists dates from 1989-present so mine runs from 1970-1989. It consists of a mashup of various sources, mostly newspaper archives, but also other online resources, numerous recordings in my collection which may or may not be correctly identified, and her website, principally the section on benefit shows. There are many caveats. It’s not particularly strong on international shows since my newspaper archives have limited non-North American sources. There are some dates which don’t make sense logistically but are included in a recording I have or some other circulating recording. Some shows may have been canceled and, in a few cases, I’ve identified them. I’ve also tried to identify shows she headlined vs. shows in which she opened for someone else. Generally speaking, a show that lists someone “with” Bonnie means she headlined.\n\nAnyway, this is all to say, it’s mostly accurate but I’m sure there are some discrepancies.\n\nWords & Research by
