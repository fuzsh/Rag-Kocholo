        "text": "Your medical records are at your fingertips\n\nWith MyUHealthChart, you can access your medical records online. Log on to any computer, from anywhere, any time of day to stay on top of your health information such as results, appointment summaries, medications, and immunizations.\n\nMyUHealth Chart Benefits:\n\nConnect with your doctor\n\nView your health summary\n\nView test results\n\nRequest prescription renewals\n\nAccess health information resources\n\nManage appointments\n\nUse eCheck-In to save time at your appointment\n\nMyUHealthChart also provides convenient methods of communication with your doctor’s office. You can renew prescriptions, send messages, and schedule appointments – all online.\n\nReset Your Password with CLEAR\n\nAs an added benefit, UHealth has partnered with CLEAR to provide patients with the option to link their identity to ease future verification, including while resetting your password.\n\nIf you need help resetting your password and want to reset using CLEAR, click:\n\nDOWNLOAD THE MYUHEALTHCHART APP TODAY\n\nHow to Use Echeck-in\n\nMyChart’s “Hello Patient” feature uses the location services in your Apple or Android phone to let UHealth staff know that you have arrived for an appointment. If all of your check-in steps are completed ahead of time, you will be automatically checked in without a visit to the front desk. If you still have check-in tasks to finish, you will be signed in and asked to use a kiosk or visit front desk to complete your eCheck-in.\n\nPlease note that for the \"Hello Patient\" feature to work, patients must have the MyChart App installed on their Android or iOS device, and location sharing permission should be set to \"Always\" (iOS) or \"Allow all the time\" (Android).\n\nParents or legal guardians are provided proxy access to a minor’s MyUHealthChart to securely communicate on behalf of a patient who is under the age of 18.\n\nThis access allows the parent or guardian to securely communicate with the patient's physician's office on behalf of the minor under their care. This is an automated process within MyUHealthChart and the parent or legal guardian will receive an email with instructions.\n\nPlease note: If you are the legal guardian or the non-custodial parent of the minor, or if you have a durable power of attorney for healthcare with regard to the minor, then a request for proxy access MUST be accompanied by a copy of legal paperwork verifying your authority to have access to the minor's MyUHealthChart.\n\nWe aim to protect your privacy and security of your information. While logged into MyUHealthChart, if your keyboard remains idle for 15 minutes or more, you will be automatically logged out of MyUHealthChart. We recommend that you log out of your MyUHealthChart session if you need to leave your computer for even a short period of time.\n\nNo, your access code is not your MyUHealthChart User Name or password. You will use this code only once to log into MyUHealthChart for the first time. (The code will expire after you have used it or after 60 days). When you log into MyUHealthChart the first time, you will then be asked to create your own unique MyUHealthChart User Name and password.\n\nWhen you receive care at organizations other than University of Miami Health System it can be difficult to keep track of all your medical information. MyChartCentral provides you with a central access point for all your MyChart accounts where you can access all accounts using a single username and password. MyChartCentral also provides you with Lucy, a personal health record that gives you a permanent home to organize all your medical information, regardless of where it came from. If you change insurance or move away and need to leave your current healthcare organization, Lucy will follow you.\n\nMyChartCentral is a hub from which you can access your MyUHealthChart other MyChart accounts from the Miami area or nationwide, and Lucy. MyChartCentral allows you to easily any MyChart account without needing to remember different usernames and passwords.\n\nLucy is a personal health record that gives you a permanent home to organize all your medical information. You can request an updated copy of your medical record at any time and store it in Lucy. You can also add personal information about your health and choose to share it with University of Miami Health System and other organizations where you receive care.\n\nThe information that each of your healthcare organizations knows about you might be different, depending on the type of care they give you and when you were last seen. You can help keep everyone up to date by organizing your records in Lucy and sharing your information among all the different places where you receive care."
