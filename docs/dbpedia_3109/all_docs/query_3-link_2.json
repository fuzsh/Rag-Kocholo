        "text": "Christian radio station and network based in Twin Falls, Idaho\n\nChristian Satellite Network (CSN) International is a Christian radio network based in Twin Falls, Idaho. KAWZ, 89.9 MHz, in Twin Falls is the uplink station, feeding 337 broadcast translators nationwide and 42 full-power radio stations[2] across the United States, including Alaska and the Hawaiian Islands.[3] CSN is a non-profit organization and operates non-profit stations.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nKAWZ began broadcasting on April 3, 1988 (Easter Sunday), with Pastor Mike Kestler as its founder.[4][5][6] The network was launched on April 26, 1995, broadcasting Christian radio over satellite from KAWZ in Twin Falls.[1] The first satellite-fed translator to begin receiving the network from KAWZ was in Yucca Valley, California, and within six months the network had dozens of translators.[1][4] It was originally known as the Calvary Satellite Network.[4]\n\nBy 1999, the network had grown to include 153 stations and translators,[7] and by 2004 it had grown to approximately 400 stations and translators across the United States.[8]\n\nIn 2007, an agreement was reached between the Twin Falls, Idaho based network and parties associated with Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa where the Twin Falls, Idaho based network kept 424 of the network's 457 stations and translators, but could no longer use Calvary Chapel branding.[9][10] Most of the stations received by the parties associated with Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa were sold to the Calvary Radio Network the following year.[11]\n\nBoard members\n\n[edit]\n\nBoard members of the Christian Satellite Network (CSN) and its parent company, Christian Broadcasting of Idaho, are Pastor Mike Kestler and Ariel Kestler. Mike Kestler is pastor of The River Christian Fellowship, a nondenominational church in Twin Falls.[12]\n\nProgramming\n\n[edit]\n\nCSN International airs a variety of Christian talk and teaching programs, such as: A New Beginning with Greg Laurie, Jay Sekulow Live, Family Talk with James Dobson, Love Worth Finding with Adrian Rogers, Thru the Bible with Dr. J. Vernon McGee, Truth For Life with Alistair Begg, and Turning Point with David Jeremiah.[13] CSN International also airs a variety of Christian contemporary music.[14]\n\nStations\n\n[edit]\n\nCSN international is heard on 397 radio stations in the United States.[3]\n\nCall sign Frequency City of license State Facility ID Class Power\n\n(W) ERP\n\n(W) Height\n\n(m (ft)) KNGW 88.9 FM Juneau Alaska 176566 A — 125 −128 m (−420 ft) KOGJ 88.1 FM Kenai Alaska 174802 A — 1,100 104 m (341 ft) KVIR 91.9 FM Dolan Springs Arizona 90917 C0 — 25,000 711 m (2,333 ft) KVJC 91.9 FM Globe Arizona 91804 C2 — 660 1,035 m (3,396 ft) KGSF 88.7 FM Huntsville Arkansas 92987 C3 — 5,000 181.5 m (595 ft) KJCU 89.9 FM Fort Bragg California 87930 A — 130 106 m (348 ft) WUJC 91.1 FM St. Marks Florida 122209 C1 — 74,000 138.7 m (455 ft) KIPA 1060 AM Hilo Hawaii 33324 B 5,000 — — KHJC 88.9 FM Lihue Hawaii 81138 C3 — 2,000 109.9 m (361 ft) KAWS 89.1 FM Marsing Idaho 8417 C1 — 8,750 668 m (2,192 ft) KMHI 1240 AM Mountain Home Idaho 72657 C 1,000 — — KAWZ[a] 89.9 FM Twin Falls Idaho 8414 C0 — 100,000 302 m (991 ft) KOKN 88.7 FM Oketo Kansas 177208 A — 300 74 m (243 ft) KIMW 105.5 FM Heflin Louisiana 191575 A — 6,000 83.3 m (273 ft) WGWS 88.1 FM St. Mary's City Maryland 172973 A — 1,100 53 m (174 ft) WSMA 90.5 FM Scituate Massachusetts 122202 B1 — 7,700 150 m (490 ft) WWUN-FM 101.5 FM Friars Point Mississippi 16523 C3 — 14,000 120.4 m (395 ft) KLWL 88.1 FM Chillicothe Missouri 176981 A — 800 103 m (338 ft) KTBJ 89.3 FM Festus Missouri 76989 B — 25,000 113 m (371 ft) KJFT 90.3 FM Arlee Montana 93587 C3 — 400 581 m (1,906 ft) KGFJ 88.1 FM Belt Montana 172645 C2 — 730 597.3 m (1,960 ft) KJCB 88.9 FM Lockwood Montana 93512 A — 1,900 137.7 m (452 ft) KNEF 90.1 FM Franklin Nebraska 177070 A — 100 −18 m (−59 ft) KNMA 88.1 FM Tularosa New Mexico 122932 C1 — 7,000 579.2 m (1,900 ft) WSFW 1110 AM Seneca Falls New York 5391 D 1,000 day only — — WIFF 90.1 FM Windsor New York 2868 A — 100 209 m (686 ft) WWYC 1560 AM Toledo Ohio 22672 D 1,500 day\n\n920 critical hours\n\n3 night — — KJCC 89.5 FM Carnegie Oklahoma 122517 C2 — 23,500 118.8 m (390 ft) KDJC 88.1 FM Baker Oregon 121839 C2 — 775 551.8 m (1,810 ft) KJCH 90.9 FM Coos Bay Oregon 90263 C2 — 3,500 445.8 m (1,463 ft) KQDL 89.1 FM Hines Oregon 174458 A — 300 266.6 m (875 ft) KGNR 91.9 FM John Day Oregon 37433 A — 1,500 −33 m (−108 ft) KPIJ 88.5 FM Junction City Oregon 92491 C2 — 650 711 m (2,333 ft) KKJA 89.9 FM Redmond Oregon 92285 C2 — 1,500 672.9 m (2,208 ft) KWRC 90.9 FM Hermosa South Dakota 90500 C3 — 400 386.8 m (1,269 ft) KGDL 92.1 FM Trent Texas 171016 C3 — 19,000 114 m (374 ft) KBJF 90.5 FM Nephi Utah 174640 C — 75,000 657.4 m (2,157 ft) WCBX 900 AM Bassett Virginia 18887 D 1,000 day\n\n180 night — — WKQY 100.1 FM Tazewell Virginia 64665 A — 4,200 119 m (390 ft) KJCF 89.3 FM Asotin Washington 106475 A — 175 −100 m (−330 ft) KTJC 91.1 FM Kelso Washington 92487 C2 — 8,000 189 m (620 ft) KWYC 90.3 FM Cheyenne Wyoming 87267 C2 — 20,500 129.7 m (426 ft) KLWD 91.9 FM Gillette Wyoming 84184 A — 1,000 97 m (318 ft) KWCF 89.3 FM Sheridan Wyoming 90842 C3 — 850 292.2 m (959 ft)\n\nNotes:\n\nTranslators\n\n[edit]\n\nCSN International is relayed by many additional translators nationwide.\n\nFurther information: CSN International translators\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
