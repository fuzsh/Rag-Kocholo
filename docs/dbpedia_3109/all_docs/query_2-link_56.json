        "text": "Share this page:\n\nOur goal is to share the gospel with the lost, and to provide the Christian community with best modern Christian music available today.\n\n1 Thessalonians 2:13 - \"For this reason we also thank God without ceasing, because when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you welcomed it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which also effectively works in you who believe.\"\n\nThe Effect (KEFX, Twin Falls) began broadcasting in 1996 on 88.9 FM, from the church building of Calvary Chapel of Twin Falls, which was then located in downtown Twin Falls, Idaho. Out of our church, which started in the late 1970s, our sister radio station, KAWZ 89.9 FM, began in the late 1980s. In 1993, KAWZ became the satellite uplink station for CSN International, the Christian Satellite Network, which has grown to almost 400 stations nationwide. The Effect has also grown since it began in 1996, as CSN has been able to acquire additional stations on our behalf, now over 50 nationwide.\n\nOur church moved to the east side of Twin Falls, on the road to Shoshone Falls (which is in the Snake River Canyon), and in 2007, was renamed The River Christian Fellowship, where CSN and The Effect are also located.\n\nThe Effect is a non-commercial, non-profit ministry.\n\nWe depend on your donations to stay on the air.\n\nIf you would like to make a donation, we have provided various options, such as our E-Crew CDs of the month, and other Thank-You Gifts such as Bibles and ministry resources â€“ in which case, we will send you these items from the Effect and the various record companies and ministries that have partnered with us. 100% of your donations are used for the cost of operation of the Effect.\n\nThank you for listening, and for your support.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions"
