        "text": "ATI saved our practical nursing program a few years ago. This year, thanks to ATI, we had our first ever 100% NCLEX-PN pass rate! And this was even though students had to learn virtually from March through the end of the school year.\n\nI just wanted to express our appreciation for the amazing webinar … None of us could believe all of the great information and the wonderful products that will help us navigate this online teaching ‘adventure.’ We learned so much about the products available to us. Thank you to ATI for helping up with this very challenging time as nursing educators. We appreciate all you are doing to help!\n\nThank you! All these ATI modules and resources are saving our butts right now ?. Its been interesting trying to replace all these labs and clinical hours!\n\nThank you ATI for all the help you have provided and continue to provide nursing programs as we wade through this crisis. Our students are moving forward as planned with your help and innovation!\n\nATI has been an extremely beneficial learning platform more so now than ever, which I am extremely grateful for. ATI has really accommodated the learning in a very expeditious manner in order for our program to keep going forward.\n\nI just have to say that I am so glad that our program uses ATI. I appreciate all of the support that ATI has implemented for the onboarding of all online clinicals.\n\nATI has really been great help to our course for clinicals. I am sure that after this social distancing ends, our methods of teaching will definitely change … It has been awesome. In a way, a lot of my co-workers have been forced to look into ATI resources of which I am glad … Thank you for partnering with us.\n\nCredit to all those involved … for integrating ATI into our program, thus allowing us excellent explanations! The ATI modules have been great and add a lot to the assigned textbook; since we’re not allowed to be inside an actual lab to practice Health Assessment together, having the simulations, and video examples that ATI provides is a great help."
