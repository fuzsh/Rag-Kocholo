        "text": "If you have completed the \"equivalent\" CSN World Language Department prerequisite to enroll in the next level of Spanish class and have documentation, follow the steps indicated here below. If you do not presently have documentation, please contact our Spanish Lead Faculty:\n\nSpanish Lead Faculty - (For prerequisite waivers, placement, etc.)\n\nOffice: West Charleston - WC I-309 J\n\nEmail: Contact Us\n\nStep 1\n\n1. Send a short email to the CSN Spanish Lead faculty\n\n2. Attach an “unofficial transcript”\n\nPlease include the following in the body of the email:\n\nName of student\n\nNSHE ID\n\nEmail of student\n\nCSN course you wish to enroll in Ex: SPAN 112 or 211)\n\nSection number (3001, 1001, ?, etc.)\n\nWhich semester and year? (Ex: For Fall, 2025)\n\nPlease send the documentation (transcript, etc.) as an attachment to the email.\n\nIf you are presently enrolled in a required prerequisite course, and the semester has not finished, we can waive the prerequisite upon receipt of proof of enrollment in the college and in the prerequisite class (example SPAN 111, SPAN 112, etc.) along with proof of good standing (note from instructor indicating passing grade, grade print-out, etc.).\n\nStep 2\n\nEnrolling in the course and unblocking the prerequisite: When we have received the email with all the appropriate information and unofficial transcript, we will evaluate the completion of the prerequisite. If approved, you will be notified by email that your request has been approved or denied. If approved, your information will be forwarded so that the prerequisite for the course and section in which you wish to enroll can be unblocked. At that time “you the student” would need to attempt to self-enroll into the class and correct section. No one can enroll for you or place you in the course.\n\nApproval is based on the following criteria:\n\n“C” grade from equivalent college/university within last 5 years\n\nUsually approved\n\nHigh school honor classes\n\nHS 3 years–into SPAN 112\n\nHS 4 years -into SPAN 211\n\nCompletion of 2 years of high school is evaluated based on the range of language skills. A transcript indicating a grade of “A” does not necessary indicate the ability or lack thereof to function successfully in SPAN 112. Nevertheless, most students are placed into SPAN 111.\n\nWe do not have a specific CSN Spanish placement exam, rather we follow a process to individually assess the background, abilities, and previous studies in Spanish of our students to help them find and match to the level of Spanish in our CSN program where they will be most successful. This is done by several methods that are explained below. For more information, contact the Spanish Lead who can assist you further at Contact Us.\n\nTo self-evaluate your own level of Spanish and how it matches our Spanish courses, visit the Determining Your Spanish Level section below. Nevertheless, read through the information below about the placement process.\n\nDemonstrating completion of a prerequisite\n\nSuccessful Completion of the prerequisite: If you wish to enroll in a second, third, or fourth-semester CSN Spanish course (SPAN 112, 211, or 212), you must demonstrate that you have “successfully completed” the prerequisite CSN course or its equivalent.\n\nMethods of completion\n\nStudents can demonstrate successful completion of a prerequisite by any one of the following methods:\n\nCourse completion of Spanish -Transcripts from a college, university, or high school.\n\nCredit by exam - CLEP, AP scores provided.\n\nEducational studies - Enrollment and completion of studies in a Spanish-speaking country.\n\nEvaluation of skills - Assessed through individual exams\n\nMinimum demonstration of “successful” completion\n\nTo waive the prerequisite by showing successful completion of coursework, the course must have been completed in the last five years with a grade of C or better.\n\nMore Information concerning exams and other evaluations:\n\nCLEP exam\n\nYet another way for students to demonstrate completion of the Spanish prerequisite is to take and score successfully on the CLEP exam. A score of 50 will award you 4 credits and serve as a placement indicator, allowing you to enroll in SPAN 112. In addition, a total of 8 (two semesters) credits with a score of 70 or higher can place you into SPAN 211. Contact testing services at any of our campuses, or call the college phone number and ask for testing services. The exam cost will vary, so do check with testing services.\n\nAP exam\n\nMany of our CSN students entering college have completed a Spanish AP exam. Demonstration of completion of the prerequisite and credit for the CSN course is usually awarded as follows:\n\nSpanish AP Score 3 Credit for SPAN 111 and placement into SPAN 112.\n\nSpanish AP Score 4-5 Credit for SPAN 111 and 112 and placement into SPAN 211.\n\nDemonstrating successful completion\n\nthrough formal and informal educational and Spanish language experiences\n\nSome students who have educational studies and Spanish language backgrounds (E.g.: Study abroad experiences, studied previously at a Spanish speaking school, have lived in a Spanish speaking country or have some background in speaking, reading and writing in Spanish) will also be able to successfully complete the prerequisite but may have difficulties providing the documentation. If this is your situation, please contact the CSN Spanish Lead who can direct you further. Each of these situations requires a unique process."
