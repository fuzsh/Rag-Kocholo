Introduction to the Rules of Due Process\n\nThe following due process procedures only govern the suspension or expulsion of a student from the District’s regular educational program. Discipline in the form of administrative intervention is solely within the discretion of the building principal or his/her designee and is not subject to the procedures of due process as provided in this Student Code of Conduct. If a student charged with violation of this Code of Conduct has been returned to the regular school program pending a decision by either the building administrator, hearing officer, Superintendent of Schools, or the Board, then such action of reinstatement shall not limit or prejudice the Districts right to suspend or expel the student following a decision by the building administrator, hearing officer, Superintendent of Schools, or Board. The initial judgement that a student has engaged in a prohibited act under this Student Code of Conduct shall be made by the building administrator.\n\n2. The Role of Restorative Practices in Suspension and Expulsion\n\nThe Board or its designee shall consider using restorative practices as an alternative or in addition to suspension or expulsion. “Restorative practices” means practices that emphasize repairing the harm to the victim and the school community caused by a student’s misconduct. Restorative practices may include victim- offender conferences that:\n\n1. Are initiated by the victim;\n\n2. Are approved by the victims parent or legal guardian or, if the victim is at least fifteen years old, by the victim;\n\n3. Are attended voluntarily by the victim, a victim advocate, the offender, members of the school community, and supporters of the victim and the offender\n\n4. Would provide an opportunity for the offender to accept responsibility for the harm caused to those affected, and to participate in setting consequences to repair the harm, such as requiring the student to apologize; participate in community service, restoration of emotional or material losses, or counseling; pay restitution; or any combination of these.\n\n5. May result in an agreement signed by all participants which includes selected consequences and time limits for their completion. Generally, restorative practices will be given first consideration to remediate offenses such as interpersonal conflicts, bullying, verbal and physical conflicts, theft, damage to property, class disruption and harassment and cyberbullying.\n\n3. Before suspending or expelling a pupil for:\n\nCommitting a physical assault against another pupil at school (as defined by MCL 380.1310)\n\nCommitting a gross misdemeanor (as defined by MCL 380.1311(1))\n\nPossession of a dangerous weapon, committing criminal sexual conduct on school grounds, or committing arson on school grounds (as defined by MCL 380.1311(2))\n\nCommitting an assault against an employee, volunteer, or contractor (as defined by MCL\n\n380.1311a)\n\nThe Board or its designee, as applicable, shall consider each of the following factors:\n\n1. The pupil’s age.\n\n2. The pupil’s disciplinary history.\n\n3. Whether the pupil is a student with a disability.\n\n4. The seriousness of the violation or behavior committed by the pupil.\n\n5. Whether the violation or behavior committed by the pupil threatened the safety of any other pupil or staff member.\n\n6. Whether restorative practices will be used to address the violation or behavior committed by the student.\n\n7. Whether a lesser intervention would properly address the violation or behavior committed by the pupil.\n\nThe method used for consideration of these factors is at the sole discretion of the Board or its designee. In exercising discretion with regard to a suspension of more than 10 days or expulsion, there is a rebuttable presumption that a suspension or expulsion is not justified unless the Board or its applicable designee can demonstrate that it considered each of the factors listed above. Accordingly, in such cases, the Board or its applicable designee shall make a written record of its consideration of each of the factors listed above.\n\n4. Mitigating Factors Related to Possession of a Dangerous Weapon, Including a Firearm, in a Weapon Free School Zone\n\nThe Board or its designee shall expel any student who possesses a firearm in a weapon-free school zone in violation of state law, unless the student can establish mitigating factors by clear and convincing factors. The Board or its designee may, but is not required to, expel a student for possession of a dangerous weapon, including a firearm, in the student can establish in a clear and convincing manner one of the following mitigating factors to the satisfaction of the Board or its designee:\n\n(a) The object or instrument was not possessed for use as a weapon, or for direct or indirect delivery to another person for use as a weapon;\n\n(b) The weapon was not knowingly possessed;\n\n(c) The student did not know (or have reason to know) that the object or instrument in his/her possession constituted a dangerous weapon; or\n\n(d) The weapon was possessed at the suggestion, request, direction of, or with the express permission of school or police authorities.\n\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that expulsion for possessing the weapon is not justified if (1) the Board or its designee determines in writing that the student establishes at least one of the four mitigation factors listed above\n\nby clear and convincing evidence, and (2) the student has no prior history of suspension or expulsion.\n\n5. Suspension of Ten (10) School Days or Less\n\na. As a general rule, prior to any suspension of the student, the building administrator shall investigate the alleged violation of the Student Code of Conduct and provide the student with the following due process:\n\n1. The administrator shall inform the student of the charges against him/her, and if the student denies the charges, the administrator shall provide the student with an explanation of the evidence the administrator possesses.\n\n2. The student shall be provided an opportunity to explain to the administrator his/her version of the facts. If a students presence in school poses an immediate danger to persons or property or an ongoing threat of disruption to the education process, the building administrator may immediately suspend the student, but the next school day, the student shall be provided with his/her due process rights as set forth in subparagraphs above. If after providing the student with his/her due process rights, the administrator determines that the student has engaged in a prohibited act under this Student Code of Conduct, then he/she may impose a\n\ndisciplinary penalty of a suspension not to exceed ten (10) school days. Any disciplinary suspension over five (5) school days, but less than eleven (11) school days, must have the prior approval of the Deputy Superintendent. The building administrator, or his/her designee, shall directly inform (in person or by phone) the student’s parent of the suspension, giving the parent a clear explanation of the reasons and conditions of the suspension. A District &quot;Student Suspension Notice; is to be completed, with copies going to the parent and the student’s file. A building administrator’s decision to impose a penalty of five (5) or less school days, or six (6) to ten (10) school days with prior approval of the Deputy Superintendent, is final and not subject to further review or appeal.\n\n3. Suspension for Eleven (11) or More School Days and Expulsion\n\na. Step One If, after his/her investigation, the building administrator decides that a suspension for eleven (11) or more school days or expulsion is warranted, the Superintendent of Schools or his/her designee agrees with the administrators decision, the student and the parent(s) or guardian shall be notified of:\n\n1) the charges against the student;\n\n2) the recommended disciplinary action;\n\n3) the fact that a hearing will be held before the hearing officer;\n\n4) the time, place, location, and procedures to be followed at the hearing;\n\n5) the right to appeal any adverse decision of the hearing officer if the hearing officer recommends a suspension for more than thirty (30) school days or if the hearing officer recommends expulsion. If the building administrator decides that the students presence in school would present a danger to the student himself/herself, or to other students, school personnel, or the education process, then the student shall be suspended pending the decision of the hearing officer. If the student would not present a danger as described above, the student may be returned to school pending the decision of the hearing officer. If the student is suspended pending a decision of the hearing officer, the Superintendent or designee shall appoint the hearing officer and schedule a hearing to commence within ten (10) school days following the initial suspension of the student. If the student is not suspended pending the decision of the hearing officer, the Superintendent or designee shall schedule a hearing to commence within\n\nfifteen (15) school days following the completion of the building principal’s investigation of the charges. The timelines for commencement of the hearing may be enlarged upon the request of the administrator, student, parent(s), or guardian for cause approved by the hearing officer. In exercising discretion with regard to a suspension of more than 10 days or expulsion, there is a\n\nrebuttable presumption that a suspension or expulsion is not justified unless the Board or its applicable designee can demonstrate that it considered each of the factors listed above under Paragraph 3.\n\nb. Step Two A hearing before the hearing officer will be held for the purpose of determining the truth or falsity of the charges against the student and, if the charges are true, the appropriate disciplinary measure unless:\n\nThe student and/or his/her parent(s) or guardian notify the District that they waive their right to a hearing before a hearing officer. In such cases, the principals recommended disciplinary penalty shall be imposed. Provided, however, if the recommended penalty is expulsion, the Board will nevertheless, make the final decision on expulsion, but the decision will be based upon information submitted to it. The hearing officer may amend the principal;s charges upon motion of the building administrator or amend the charges upon his/her own motion to conform to the evidence presented at the hearing. Additionally, the hearing officer may impose a greater or lesser penalty than that imposed or recommended by the building administrator.\n\nc. Step Three - The hearing officer’s decision shall be given orally to the student and parent(s) or guardian within two (2) business days after the close of the hearing and a written decision shall be mailed no later than four (4) business days after the close of the hearing. These timelines, however, may be enlarged by the hearing officer due to extenuating circumstances. If the hearing officer’s decision imposes a suspension of thirty (30) school days or less, then the decision of the hearing officer shall be final and not subject to further appeal. If the hearing officer’s decision imposes a suspension in excess of thirty (30) school days or recommends expulsion, the student and/or his/her parent(s) or guardian may appeal the hearing officer’s decision to the Board.\n\nd. Step Four - If an appeal of the hearing officer’s decision is going to be made to the Board, the student and/or his/her parent(s) or guardian must file the appeal in writing with the Superintendent of Schools within five (5) calendar days, excluding weekends, following receipt of the hearing officer’s written\n\ndecision. If a timely appeal is not made, then the decision of the hearing officer regarding suspension shall be final and not subject to further appeal. If the hearing officer’s decision recommends expulsion and a timely appeal is not made, the Board will nevertheless make the final decision on expulsion, but the decision will be based upon information submitted to it by appropriate school officials. Upon receipt of a timely appeal by the student and/or his/her parent(s) or guardian, the Superintendent, or his/her designee, shall notify the student and parent(s) or guardian of the time, place, location, and procedures to be followed at a Board hearing. The Superintendent or his/her designee shall determine,\n\nbased upon the record and decision of the hearing officer, whether the student should be suspended pending the decision of the Board. Upon a timely appeal, the Board shall consider the decision and record made before the hearing officer\n\nand shall provide for a meeting to take place for the purpose of allowing the administration and the student, parent(s) or guardian to present oral argument in support of, or in opposition to, the hearing officer’s decision. The Board may permit the administration or student, parent(s) or guardian to introduce in the appeal meeting newly discovered material evidence which could not, with reasonable diligence, have been discovered and presented at the hearing before the hearing officer. The Board, no later than at its next regular public meeting following the meeting with the student, parent(s) or guardian, shall make a decision and shall, not later than , seven (7) business days following the public meeting, mail to the student, parent(s) or guardian a written notice of the decision.\n\n1. Suspension/Expulsion\n\nIn order to protect the health and safety of students and employees and to prevent threatened disruption to the education process, an otherwise eligible resident student may be suspended or expelled on the basis of:\n\na. A prior act of misconduct committed outside of school hours and/or off school premises when the student was not enrolled in the Clarkston Community Schools.\n\nb. A prior act constituting a gross misdemeanor, and other acts of misconduct, while the student was enrolled in another district. If the act of gross misdemeanor or other misconduct would constitute a sufficient basis for suspension or expulsion had it occurred while the student was attending the Clarkston Community Schools. The Board or its designee, as applicable, shall consider using restorative practices as an alternative or in addition to suspension\n\nor expulsion in accordance with the Due Process procedures described herein.\n\n2. Due Process Procedure\n\na. Step One - The building administrator, with the consent of the Superintendent of Schools, or his/her designee, shall make the initial judgement if a student’s prior misconduct is of sufficient gravity that the student’s presence in school would represent a threat to the health and safety of other students and/or\n\nschool personnel or threaten disruption to the educational process. If the initial judgement is that the student’s presence in school represents such a threat, the student shall be temporarily suspended from school and the student and the parent(s) or guardian shall be notified of:\n\n1) the prior act of misconduct relied upon by the building administrator which forms the basis for his/her decision to deny attendance;\n\n2) the building administrator’s recommendation regarding the suspension or expulsion of the student;\n\n3) the fact that a hearing will be held before an impartial school employee (i.e., hearing officer);\n\n4) the time, place, location and procedures to be followed at the hearing;\n\n5) the right to appeal any adverse decision of the hearing officer if a suspension is for more than thirty (30) school days or if the hearing officer recommends expulsion.\n\nThe student and/or his/her parent(s) / guardian may waive their right to a hearing before the hearing officer. In such cases, the principal(s) recommended disciplinary penalty of suspension or expulsion, as the case may be, shall be imposed.\n\nb. Step Two - If the due process hearing is not waived, the hearing officer shall convene a hearing for the purpose of determining if the student’s prior act of misconduct is an act of gross misdemeanor or other misconduct which would constitute a sufficient basis for suspension or expulsion had it occurred while\n\nthe student was attending the Clarkston Community Schools. If the prior act would be of sufficient basis, and the student’s presence in school would represent a threat to the health and safety of other students and/or school personnel or threaten a disruption to the educational process, then the hearing officer shall decide the appropriate disciplinary penalty. The hearing officer may amend the principal’s charges upon motion of the building administrator or\n\namend the charges upon its own motion to conform to the evidence presented at the hearing. Additionally, the hearing officer may impose a greater or lesser penalty than that recommended by the building administrator. The hearing officer’s decision shall be given orally to the student and parent(s) or guardian not later than two (2) business days after the close of the hearing, if possible, and a written decision shall be mailed no later than four (4) business days after the close of the hearing. If the hearing officer’s decision imposes a suspension of thirty (30) school days or less, then the decision of the hearing officer shall be\n\nfinal and not subject to further appeal. However, if the hearing officer’s decision imposes a suspension in excess of thirty (30) school days or recommends expulsion, the student and/or his/her parent(s) or guardian may appeal the hearing officer’s decision to the Board.\n\nc. Step Three - If an appeal is going to be made to the Board concerning the hearing officer’s decision, the student and/or his/her parent(s) or guardian must file an appeal in writing with the Superintendent of Schools with five (5) calendar days following receipt of the hearing officer’s written decision. If a timely appeal is not made, then the decision of the hearing officer regarding suspension shall be final and not subject to further appeal. If the hearing officer’s decision recommends expulsion and a timely appeal is not made, the Board will nevertheless make the final decision on expulsion, but the decision will be based upon information submitted to it by appropriate school officials. Upon receipt of a timely appeal by the student and/or his/her parent(s) or guardian, the Superintendent shall notify the student and parent(s) or guardian of the time, place, location, and procedures to be followed at a Board hearing. The Superintendent shall determine, based upon the record and decision of\n\nthe hearing officer, whether the student should be suspended pending the decision of the Board. Upon a timely appeal, the Board shall review the decision and record made before the hearing officer and shall provide for a meeting to take place for the purpose of allowing the administration and the student, parent(s) or guardian to present oral argument why they disagree with the hearing officer’s decision and to present any additional evidence which could not have been presented at the hearing before the hearing officer. The Board, no later than at its next regular public meeting following the meeting with the student, parent(s) or guardian, shall make a decision and shall, not later than seven (7) business days following the public meeting, mail to the student, parent(s) or guardian a written notice of the decision.\n\n3. Voluntary Agreements of Discipline\n\nAt any time during the disciplinary proceedings, the Superintendent or his/her designee may enter into a written contract with the student and/or his/her parent(s) or guardian, setting forth the parties’ agreement and settlement of the matters. In such cases, the written agreement shall be final and binding and may not be later challenged by the Superintendent or his/her designee or the student and/or his/her parent(s) or guardian.\n\n4. Administrative Procedures\n\nThe administration shall implement procedures to ensure, to the extent practical, that a student, upon enrollment, has not committed an act of gross misdemeanor, or other misconduct, prior to attending the Clarkston Community Schools, when that gross misdemeanor or misconduct would represent a threat to the health and safety of students and/or employees or threaten disruption to the educational process.\n\n5. Disclosure of Information at the Time of Enrollment\n\nAt the time of enrollment, a student, parent(s) or guardian shall not give false or incomplete information, or fail to disclose information, relative to a student’s prior act of gross misdemeanor, or other misconduct. A violation will result in disciplinary proceedings being initiated against the student. A.G. 5500b"
