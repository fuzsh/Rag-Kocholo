        "text": "Joe Henderson Trio, Charlie Hayden Quartet West, Kansas City All-Stars, Fill., SF, Wed., January 8, 1997\n\nHello, 1997! Yes, looking over this list, I admit that this is one of the better years, partially because of the sheer volume alone of shows. Between the Maritime Hall and everything else, I cleared a whopping 181 shows this year. I’ll have to check later, but I think this might of taken the record. Still, I know a handful of others who see this many every year, either working or attending. Crazy bastards.\n\nThis was an interesting show to kick off the new year. The Fillmore rarely had jazz shows and these acts were real professionals. This gig was being billed as the “Verve Jazz Fest”. Joe Henderson had been blowing his sax for decades by this time, putting out albums on Blue Note, not to mention having been the sideman to practically everybody on Earth. It’s a pity that shortly after this show, he developed emphysema that would ultimately lead to his death in San Francisco no less only four years later. Glad I got to see him at least once.\n\nThe same goes for Charlie Hayden, who would live until 2014, though this would be the only time I’d see him as well. You might remember me writing previously that he had a son three daughters who were musicians in various projects as well and one of the daughters, Tanya, I knew in college. She was very pretty and I had a crush on her and as luck would have it, she would years later go on to marry the one and only Jack Black. Anyway, if Tanya was in town that night, she obviously would have been at that show. Everybody played admirably that night and it reminds me how much a pity it is that The Fillmore doesn’t host jazz musicians more often, especially considering the prestigious history of jazz in that neighborhood.\n\nTom Petty & The Heartbreakers, The Wallflowers, Fill., SF, Fri., January 10, 1997\n\nTom Petty & The Heartbreakers, The Wallflowers, Fill., SF, Sat., January 11, 1997\n\nSETLISTS: (FRIDAY)\n\nTHE WALLFLOWERS : One Headlight, Three Marlenas, Bleeders, Sixth Avenue Heartache, Invisible City, Tears Of A Clown, The Difference\n\nTOM PETTY & THE HEARTBREAKERS : I Won’t Back Down, Jammin’ Me, Little Girl, Shakin’ All Over, You Don’t Know How It Feels, Diddy-Wah-Diddy, I Want You Back Again, Goldfinger, King’s Highway, I Got A Woman, The Apartment Song, Asshole, Stick To You Baby, Time Is On My Side, Last Dance With Mary Jane, It’s Good To Be King, Running Down A Dream, (encore), Free Falling, You Wreck Me\n\n(SATURDAY)\n\nTHE WALLFLOWERS : One Headlight, Three Marlenas, Sixth Avenue Heartache, Invisible City, Tears Of A Clown, The Difference\n\nTOM PETTY & THE HEARTBREAKERS : Rip It Up, Jammin’ Me, Running Down A Dream, Shakin’ All Over, Diddy-Wah-Diddy, Walls, Slaughter On Tenth Avenue, On The Street, Image Of Me, I Won’t Back Down, The Best Of Everything, Ain’t No Sunshine, I Want You Back Again, Little Maggie, Keeping Me Alive, Treat Me Nice, Believe What You Say, Another Man Done Gone, Love Is A Long Road, You Don’t Know How It Feels, (Pepper Spray Incident!), You Wreck Me, Last Dance With Mary Jane, It’s Good To Be King, Gloria\n\nThis was a big deal. Tom and the gang had settled down to be the de facto Fillmore house band for a while, playing a whopping twenty shows, all hopelessly sold out immediately, between these first two shows starting January 10th through February 7th. I don’t regret only seeing three in total because three was plenty. Each show was at least two hours long and God knows I’d seen Tom a few times by then and would go on to see him many more times after. No need to be greedy. Though I do regret only getting two of the four posters that were made in a series to commemorate those shows, mine being the first and the last. However, I do think the poster I got were the best ones. He’d come back in 1999 to do another string of shows, but that time it was only eleven of them. Obviously, it was one of those gigs where I and the fellow ushers were spoiled rotten, seeing such a popular act who was regularly playing arenas, doing this string of shows at a venue that only holds about a thousand people.\n\nTom had a variety of openers for this run of shows he was doing, but the first ones up were The Wallflowers. This was Jakob Dylan’s band, the son of Bob Dylan, and as many people had assumed, myself included, that he was merely getting big riding on the coattails of his famous dad. Though in show biz a little nepotism goes a long way, it was safe to say after these shows that I was convinced The Wallflowers were good on their own merits. Like so many others, I had no idea that they’d been around for a few years, paying their dues, playing small clubs in L.A. and had already released a self titled album. But with the release of their second album, “Bringing Down The Horse” the previous May, they got big fast. Heartbreakers guitarist Mike Campbell even played guitar on their hit song, “One Headlight”, a song that would win them two Grammies for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance. They were a tight band and easy to like, a strong opening band to be sure, a little jam bandish, but more urban.\n\nMr. Petty and company were in fine form for these two gigs, showcasing many of the big hits, both solo stuff and with the Heartbreakers, plus a wide variety of covers, such as “Shakin’ All Over”, “Ain’t No Sunshine”, an instrumental version of the theme from “Goldfinger” and “I Want You Back Again”. Tom had actually done a soundtrack, something he had never tried before and didn’t do since, the year before for a film called “She’s The One”, starring Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Aniston. They would play a couple songs from that movie, “Walls” from it on the second night and his cover of Beck’s “Asshole” on the first. Tom was at the top of his game and arguably the height of his popularity, though secretly he was struggling with heroin addiction, a habit he wouldn’t kick until a few years later.\n\nThough the first night was great, it was the second night that made the biggest impression for two reasons unrelated to the show itself and for very, very different reasons. The first being my encounter with actor Winona Ryder, yes, THE Winona Ryder. Anybody who knows me well enough knows that I will live and die by her command and that night I helped her and her friends to get to the entrance of the backstage. They’d come into the lobby and I spotted her immediately. Her movie “Alien Resurrection”, the sequel in the Alien series directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, wouldn’t be released until that November, but she was sporting the short haircut she had in it that night.\n\nShe looked a little bewildered, so I did my best to keep my composure, looked into her beautiful doe like eyes, and asked if she needed help. She said she was trying to find the backstage, so then it was my time to shine. I walked her and her friends, including one man who I’m pretty sure was local musician Eric McFadden, along the main bar and to the house left entrance by the stage. I took this opportunity to ask her for an autograph, but she very sweetly let me down, saying, “No, not tonight, sorry.” I didn’t make a fuss and was frankly embarrassed that I asked since I found out later that she never does autographs anyway. Still, that was our microscopic little moment and I’ll remember it forever. She’s a little slip of thing in real life. Only 5’3”.\n\nBut the big reason I’ll remember the second show for the rest of my life is what happened near the end of the set. The Band was just a couple minutes into “You Don’t Know How It Feels” when I noticed an increasing itching sensation in the back of my throat, like a grain of sand back there that I couldn’t dislodge, no matter how much I coughed. I looked around me and noticed there were a couple guys smoking a joint nearby, so I initially thought it was just my reaction to their smoke. But the cough got worse and worse to the point where it was uncontrollable and everybody around starting coughing the same way. It was pepper spray. Somebody had set off what must of been a whole canister of it in the middle of the dance floor.\n\nEventually, Tom noticed the commotion on stage and stopped the show. Then something happened that was unprecedented in live music history and to my knowledge hasn’t happened since. They turned on the house lights, opened all the doors, cleared the center of the dance floor, and the house guys mopped it down. The house manager then came on stage after the air was clear and said everybody in the crowd could have a free drink! I even can hear myself on the tape after the announcement jokingly saying, “Charge!”, as I followed the hordes of fans to one of the bars to get a beer. Smart move on the house guys part. I’m sure somebody at that show could have sued them for something. The police arrested a suspect, but to this day, I don’t know who they were or if they were guilty and/or convicted for what happened.\n\nSuffice to say anybody there, especially people like myself who were affected, will never forget it. The fire marshall gave the all clear and the band came back on and did a few more songs. Tom even cracked a little joke about the incident during a little breakdown section in the middle of a fantastic cover of the 60’s classic “Gloria”, the last song of the night. He went on talking about his “honey” and his efforts to “chase her down”, asking her to “slow down and let me talk to you, girl”. Then he said the girl retorted, saying that he had to go out “first thing in the morning and get a job”. He countered saying that he was doing alright with his new band, though “we might get pepper sprayed from time to time”.\n\nZero, Derek Trucks Band, Maritime Hall, SF, Wed., January 15, 1997\n\nYep. Zero again. Sorry to y’all out there, but you’ll have to hear me gripe about them for the next couple years until the untimely sinking of the Maritime. We eventually put out two live albums, one a double album, but consistent with Boots’ conspicuous lack of attention to detail, the dates of the songs recorded were never listed. So some of the songs from this show or any of Zero’s shows may or may not have made it to these albums, Truth be told, I never made an effort to find out. They were who they were and they had loyal fans and friends, but as the years went on, I grew more weary of their shows.\n\nThe good news about this particular show was that it would be the first time I’d get to see Derek Trucks. He was still pretty new, a fresh young face of only 18 years of age by this show, but had already made a reputation for being a guitar virtuoso. Derek is the nephew of Butch Trucks, the drummer of the Allman Brothers Band, and Derek would eventually become a member of that band in 1999. But by this show, he hadn’t of even put out his first album, which would be released ten months later in October. His appearance that night made the show a little more palatable.\n\nLos Van Van, Conjundo Cespedes, Maritime Hall, , SF, Thur., January 16, 1997\n\nLos Van Van, Conjundo Cespedes, Maritime Hall, SF, Fri., January 17, 1997\n\nThis was a big deal, even I knew it and I knew nothing about Los Van Van before they were booked for this show. Our country’s relations with Cuba were tense ever since Castro took over in 1959 and they still were, despite Cuba’s hopeless isolation. But things were starting to thaw out around this time, even though Cuba would be stuck with Fidel as their dictator for another ten years and even then he wouldn’t croak for nearly another ten after that. Indeed, I was beginning to think Fidel was truly indestructible, him running around in those ridiculous track suits of his trying to look spry. To this day, we’re still trying to sort out our relations with Cuba even though Fidel’s been in the cold, cold ground for years now.\n\nLos Van Van were respected for decades amongst Latin music circles and though they had toured Europe, Latin America, and Japan regularly, this would be the first time they’d tour America and we were lucky to have these two shows to be the first two shows of their tour. This coincided with the release of a “Best Of” compilation album released that year as well. The shows were stellar and it’s a pity that the recordings from those shows were never made into an album. This would be a new beginning culturally between our countries and relations would continue to thaw with the popularity of the Buena Vista Social Club. Their first album would hit the shelves later that year and Wim Wenders’ hit documentary would be released the year after that. God willing I ever get the pleasure to visit Cuba, I will at least have the story of recording these shows as an ice breaker if I get a chance to talk to some of the locals.\n\nCake, September 67, The Kinetics, Fill., SF, Sat., January 18, 1997\n\nIt had literally been less than a month since I’d seen Cake at the Live 105 Green X-Mas show at the Cow Palace. Not that I was was tired of them, far from it. I was glad that they’d achieved commercial and critical success, especially since Xan McCurdy joined them on guitar. It’s strange seeing a band so close between gigs. It’s a good thing insomuch that you learn their show, vibe, songs, and personalities a little quicker, but a detriment as it makes you grow familiar, and the experience less unique. Surely, this is an experience every road person for a band must feel night in and night out, hearing the same songs with the same people. And what is true for the road people, must be a thousand times as potent for the performers themselves.\n\nThat being said, it helps when that band and the experience they provide is Cake. Jon McCrae might come off as a bit of a pill, but I respect him, because he writes excellent songs and keeps the band tight. I like the way he hits that rattling hand percussion instrument on beat, an instrument known as a Vibra-slap. This is a wooden ball attached to a metal bar that bend around so when hit, the ball would rattle against another wooden block on the end of the bar directly adjacent… ah,shit. Just look it up sometime. Anyway, it was based off of an instrument called a Quijara which was a dried out donkey jaw bone that would make a similar rattle when struck, jittering the teeth inside.\n\nOpening that night was a band I liked called the Kinetics. Xan had been a member before he joined Cake and I can only assume he had some small part that they were part of the tour. Regardless, they performed admirably and frontman Bart Davenport has been a rock solid mod blues man here in the bay area and all of California for years now. My brother Alex loves these guys, and like Alex, they all look very, VERY cool. Next up was September 67, a rare chance to see singer/songwriter Shannon Worrell. Talented woman, Shannon. She recorded a live song that year while touring with the Lilith Fair called “Steve Malkmus Is A Fucking Snob”, Steve being the frontman for Pavement. Whether he is a snob or not, I cannot say. I never met him, but he had reputation for butting heads. Still, Stockton, where he was from, was not renown for its snobbishness.\n\nSpeaking of personality disorders, McCrae kept on taunting the crowd between songs. At one point between songs he asked the crowd which astrological sign was most likely to be in a car accident. He asked a few folks before one guy in an orange hat named Bill guessed right, it being Aries. He had an alleged drunk thrown out a few songs later offered him his maraca. Jon mused that since they were about to hit the year 2000, that in 30 years, musicians would have to wear riot gear. One could only guess if the maraca offer was sincere or not. Jon would sometimes keep you guessing, a bit of Andy Kaufman in him. Finally, after Cake did their cover of Gloria Gaynor’s, “I Will Survive”, he said to those yelling out song requests, he asked them to “shut up and let me do my job”. But he tried to make up for it, getting the crowd to cheer for the opening bands. Even he commented that he thought he sounded like an “authoritarian father”. Either way, Jon keeps the crowd lively like a carnival barker or wrestling villain.\n\nPersonalities aside, it was excellent music and part of me appreciates, even if I may never understand his perspective. He’s a serious musician and demands perfection which he gets each and every time without a peep from the band behind him, so I’ll forgive him his prickliness. It had been a good stretch, having done Zero and two days of Los Van Van at the Maritime before this show. It was a two show gig for Cake and I was catching the second night. Dieselhed, a very good band, and Lysobar, who I didn’t know opened up the first night, and being a two night well sold show on a weekend, I’m happy to say we were rewarded with a good poster that night. It was of a naked woman from the turn of the century falling down a flight of stairs.\n\nDavid Crosby, Maritime Hall, SF, Tues., January 21, 1997\n\nSETLIST : In My Dreams, Tracks Of Dust, Homeward Through The Haze, Rusty & Blue, Thousand Roads, He Played Real Good For Free, Morrison, Somehow She Knew, Till It Shines On You, This Time, Where Will I Be, Delta, Deja Vu, One For Every Moment, Guinnevere, Eight Miles High, (encore), Laughing, Box Of Rain, Wooden Ships\n\nI had learned a modicum of the hippie history of my beloved bay area by this time, but up to this point, I’d only seen Mr. Young from Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young. so this was my time to see another one. Apart from the handful of their hits that I had known before this show like “Teach The Children”, the Byrd’s cover of “Mr. Tambourine Man”, and the Stills’ song “For What It’s Worth”, I knew little else. But thanks to “The Simpsons” in two separate episodes in 1993, I was aquatinted to him on a different level, first being lawyer Lionel Hutz’s AA sponsor and then presenting Homer’s barbershop quartet into the Grammy for “Outstanding Soul, Spoken Word, or Barbershop Album Of The Year”.\n\nWhat I did or didn’t know about him would soon be moot in the proceedings of that night as Mr. Crosby flat out refused to let us tape. I had little to no experience in the goings on in the negotiations or lack thereof of whether a show got taped or not at the Hall by then. Since Pete was still doing all the main engineering work, I’d let him go upstairs and hand off the tapes to whoever, while I labeled, reloaded, and reformatted the tapes for the next set, though he was beginning to let me record the opening acts by then. But I’ll never forget the sight of Mr. Crosby coming down to the recording room with Boots, the main florescent lights on and all the recording equipment switched off, as he personally gave up the up and down look to make sure we weren’t taping. Yep, David looked like he was in a killing mood, seriously, real daggers in those eyes. It was intimidating.\n\nI felt sympathy for him later when I had learned that one of the reasons he didn’t want us taping is that he was just beginning to tour with his new band, CPR, which is understandable since they were just getting started and he didn’t feel comfortable yet with their performances to publish. CPR was his new band, the name being an abbreviation of the last names of Crosby, guitarist Jeff Pevar, and keyboard player, James Raymond. Now the R was a big deal, he being Crosby’s son, who’d he’d given up for adoption in 1962 and had only been recently reunited with him and had starting touring with him in this new band. Once again, I could understand the sensitivity of this new undertaking and I was ultimately blessed to take the night off from recording to witness one David’s shows with this special new band of his. As fate would have it, I’d be lucky enough to see him again play with Crosby, Stills, & Nash at the Fillmore eight months later and I can say for certain that he would be in a much more relaxed mood.\n\nSaddened as I was that I would not have Mr. Crosby under my list of my recording accomplishments, it was compounded further by who showed up at the encore that night. Mr. Phil Lesh, yes, the bass player of the Grateful Dead, joined him to do the songs “Laughing”, “Box Of Rain”, and “Wooden Ships”. Naturally, some hippie in the crowd got that recording as usual, so it wasn’t a complete loss. Once again, it was relieving to see Phil out and about playing music after the loss of Jerry. He looked happy that night.\n\nMarilyn Manson, L7, War., SF, Wed., January 22, 1997\n\nSETLIST : Angel With Scabbed Wings, Get Your Gunn, Dooma, Dried up Tied & Dead To The World, Tourniquet Of Roses, Lunch Box, Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This), Cake & Sodomy, Little Horn, Cryptorchard, Antichrist Superstar, The Beautiful People, The Reflecting God, (encore), Man That You Fear\n\nI may not have been or have ever been the biggest fan of Manson’s music, but I always appreciate somebody who freaks out the general public. They need it for their own good. Enough that even Orrin Hatch and his conservative ilk used their latest album, “Antichrist Superstar”, to showcase how much music provokes violence in children. It was a good album, probably his best, but I doubt it would so influential that it would be the cause of any violence, much less the violence that has ensued in America by its youth since its release.\n\nRegardless, half the reason I was there that night was for L7 anyway. I was a fan, having seen them several times in only a few years before this show and they had just released their new album, “The Beauty Process : Triple Platinum”. Unfortunately, this would begin a decline in the band both in popularity and financial success. Jennifer Finch, the bassist, had just left the band, replaced by Gail Greenwood from Belly. Poor sales from the new album would lead them to be ultimately dropped from Reprise Records. They still sounded great that night as always and I would say that L7 is one of those few bands that is not only a great headliner in their own right, but a four star opening band. Any headliner would be lucky to have them. They make any show better.\n\nAnd respect due to Manson for doing what he does, he needed a band like L7 then. To me, the whole rock & roll ghoul thing was wearing thin. After seeing David Crosby’s steely gaze a few days before at the Maritime, giving us the stink eye when inspecting our recording room, making sure we weren’t recording without permission, Manson’s on stage antics seemed less than provocative. He don’t scare me. Merle Haggard… now that’s a scary guy. Still, his music and personality did get the attention of David Lynch, one of my all time favorite film directors, getting him a cameo and a song on the soundtrack of “Lost Highway”, which would be released in theaters only a couple weeks after this show.\n\nWorld Peace Benefit, Maritime Hall, SF, Fri., January 24, 1997\n\nYou got me on this one. But throw me a bone here, there’s lots of shows under my belt and no matter how hard I looked, I couldn’t find anything about this show. Suffice to say, it didn’t make an impression and wasn’t significant enough on the line up to show up anywhere. To make matters worse, as of today we haven’t achieved world peace and if we ever do, I doubt this show would have had anything to do with it. So, that being said, it was the thought that counted and good luck to all those who may have been involved.\n\nThe JGB Band, Steve Kimock, Maritime Hall, SF, Sat., January 25, 1997\n\nAnother hippie show, but at least this was a good one. It had been almost two years since Jerry died, but the band from his solo act was still carrying on. Led by keyboardist virtuoso Melvin Seals, they are still playing till this very day. As you might imagine, the line up in the band has changed numerous times since then, leaving him today as the only original member from the line up when Jerry passed away. And though bassist John Kahn unexpectedly kicked the bucket only a year after Jerry at the tender age of 48 in his sleep from a heart attack, Jackie and Gloria were thankfully still there to sing back up vocals.\n\nI’d just worked the night before at the Hall for the World Peace Benefit. Steve Kimock opened up and he was his usual self, noodling calmly on his guitar while sitting on a stool. Part of me had a certain distain for guitarists who sit while they play back then, but now that I’m over 40, like he was at this show, I have sympathy. That, and considering the complexity of the stuff he plays, well, he gets my respect. It was reassuring to hear Melvin and the gang play again, though it would be the last time for me. I’d seen them all plenty with Jerry in the few years I was ushering at the Warfield, not to mention the zillion times I would see members of the Dead play for years and years to come, so I don’t feel like I’ve missed much.\n\nTom Petty & The Heartbreakers, Iris DeMent, Fill., SF, Mon., February 3, 1997\n\nSETLIST : Around & Around, Jammin’ Me, Runnin’ Down A Dream, Lucille, Call Me The Breeze, Cabin Down Below, You Really Got Me, Friend Of The Devil, Goldfinger, Listen To Her Heart, The Date I Had With That Ugly Homecoming Queen, I Won’t Back Down, It’s Good To Be King, Green Onions, I’d Like To Love You Baby, You Don’t Know How It Feels, Little Maggie, Walls, Angel Dream, Guitar Boogie Shuffle, Even The Losers, American Girl, Honey Bee, Bye Bye Johnny, Another Man Done Gone, You Wreck Me, (encore), Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door, Mary Jane’s Last Dance, Hi-Heel Sneakers, Gloria, Alright For Now\n\nIt had been almost a month since I saw the first two shows of Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers 20 show run at The Fillmore and his stint was nearly over. I was glad to catch one more, not only to revisit the experience, but also to get the last poster in the four poster series for these shows. Opening this time was singer/songwriter Iris Dement. She’d been around a little while putting out her own songs and singing harmony vocals on other folks’ albums like Nanci Griffith and Emmylou Harris, and she had just released her third album, “The Way I Should”, the year before. She has a very pretty voice and I had seen her once before playing at the Merle Haggard a couple years before at The Fillmore, though this would be the last time I’d see her.\n\nTom Petty and the boys were tight as always and I’m happy to say we got through “You Don’t Know How It Feels” as well as the rest of the show without another pepper pray incident. They dusted off a good number of covers including “Lucille”, “Goldfinger”, and “Gloria”, which I’d heard during the shows in January. They even played a song they called “Mike’s New One”, who I assume is Mike Campbell, the guitarist. I found out later it was called “The Date I Had With That Ugly Homecoming Queen” which they ironically played two songs after “It’s Good To Be King”. Maybe they did it intentionally, maybe not. They would finish their run of shows at The Fillmore that Friday and in hindsight, I probably should have seen more of them. Still, with over two hours of material each show, I got plenty. There were no shortage of ushers trying to get into these gigs and I’m thankful I was able to see three of them.\n\nIn an unrelated story, Tom would go on to have a part in the disastrous flop, “The Postman” with Kevin Costner, released the following Christmas. I can’t help but wonder if that contributed to the drug habit he was struggling with around that time. Thankfully, he still had his music career to fall back on. I have to say, I thought his casting as the voice of “Lucky” for the last five years of the animated show “King Of The Hill” was inspired.\n\nCrispin Hellion Glover’s Big Slide Show, The Edge, Palo Alto, Wed., February 5, 1997\n\nThis installment comes as a sort of happy accident which is an appropriate way I suppose to describe the one and only Mr. Crispin Hellion Glover. For those who don’t know or they’ve forgotten, he is an eccentric, but well known actor from several films, most notably from the first “Back To The Future” movie, playing George McFly. And as luck would have it, I just saw him last night at the Castro Theater performing this very same show nearly 23 years to the day that I saw him at the Edge. It was only random curiosity that I decided to see if I could find the date of this gig and in a moment of coincidence… (or is it?)… I not only discovered the date, but it miraculously fell on the very week I was passing in my efforts to write this thing I do. I had always thought I’d seen Mr. Glover’s show much earlier in years, being the Edge, a venue that had long since come and gone, thinking it was more around 1992 or 1993. It felt like an eternity ago for sure.\n\nI had gone alone that night, though I had hoped my friend Tory would join me. He and I were both big fans of David Lynch and Crispin’s portrayal of Jingle Dell in “Wild At Heart” made quite an impression. Alas, I was alone to make the long drive to Palo Alto and experience this weird spectacle. Even having freshly seen his performance less than twenty four hours ago, I struggle to try to explain exactly what I observed. I suppose the best way to begin would be to at least describe the structure of the show. First, was the slide show itself, which comprised of Glover under a simple dim spotlight, reading from a handful of his poetry books while advancing a slide projector with depictions of the pictures and texts from them. Simple enough premise, but his spoken word is a rare bird indeed.\n\nThe piece that stuck in my head most prominently and still does is “Rat Catching”, a strange, redacted version of “Studies In The Art Of Rat Catching”, a non-fiction guide published in 1898. The slides consist of lithograph pictures of rats, both live and dissected, and traps to catch them, the original text with layers of sprawling black ink words written in the margins and between lines. Crispin would go on in a sort of semi-instructional way on how public schools could dispose of the vermin but then would veer off into other seemingly unrelated stuff, before coming back to rat catching near the end. He’d profess that students and teachers would not adhere to this instruction since rat catching would be too intellectually daunting to them. I’d normally say now, “you get the idea”, but believe me, you don’t. Seeing is believing with Glover and that goes for all the pieces he read that night. Forgive me if words fail me.\n\nThe second part of this show was his showing of the film, “What Is It?”, or at least one could call it longer than a preview, definitely a short film. The finished product would take until 2005 to complete, running about 70ish minutes, but around this gig, Crispin had just started putting it together. But what he did show was sizable, probably at least half of it and definitely stuck with me. Like his slide show, I’ll try to keep it together, but let’s just say the piece involves snails, a minstrel, naked women wearing monkey masks handling watermelons, a puppet show, Crispin himself on a stone chair wearing a giant fur coat, swastikas, Shirley Temple, a man with severe cerebral palsy inside of a giant clam shell getting jerked off by one of the monkey women, and every other actor in the piece had Down’s Syndrome.\n\nOf all the downright insanity of this film, to me and to most people I would later learn, the most disturbing part about it was with the snails. Yes, on several occasions during the film, actors would pour salt on them and they would naturally, curl up and bubble over, dying horrifically. They being pests legally can likewise be legally be killed on film, but the sight of it certainly gets to you and obviously that was the intention. Mission accomplished. There was also a couple points in it where there was the off screen sound of a woman screaming, presumably playing a snail or at least the snail’s widow, which I would find out last night was voiced by actress Fairuza Balk, from such movies as “The Craft” and “American History X”.\n\nA little shook up as I’m sure most of the crowd was after the show ended, I lingered about and contemplated getting money out of the ATM to get one of his books to have him sign it. Regrettably, I was sort of hard up on cash at the time, having just finished college and trying to make money, so I didn’t, which I regret. I was thinking I would have him sign it, “To Nick, Let’s Do Lunch!”, a reference to his Jingle Dell character. I didn’t get a book last night at the Castro either, but it was only because Crispin was only singing stuff for people who had the expensive meet and greet tickets. I did however have the honor of asking him a question during the lengthy Q & A period at the end of the show.\n\nI asked him if Shirley Temple had seen his movie and I was relieved to hear a tittering of laughter from my question. He replied that he didn’t know and it probably was unlikely. He said he had used samples from her movie “Bright Eyes” and was an admirer of her work and went on to say that he didn’t think she would have minded. Mr. Glover said that Shirley, or at least a picture of her head, had been used in work by Salvador Dali in 1939. In the picture, she was the head of some kind of sphinx or manticore, surrounded by bones. One would like to think she’d be open minded, but who knows? I’ll have to ask her in the afterlife.\n\nThird World, Dub Nation, Sunfur, Maritime Hall, SF, Fri. February 7, 1997\n\nThe reggae education continued unabated with the great Third World. They’d been around since the early 70’s and consistently released albums, singles, and compilations all the years since. Third World had gone through a variety of line up changes as most bands do after been performing for nearly 25 years by this time, but they were tight that night, one of the best reggae acts that I will ever have the pleasure of seeing. There were only two original members in the band by this time, Stephen “Cat” Coore on guitar, Richard Daley on bass, and Michael “Ibo” Cooper on keys. This would be Ibo’s last tour with them and now teaches at a performing arts academy in Kingston, Jamaica.\n\nOpening that show was Dub Nation, a local act I believe primarily based out of Santa Cruz, and often a go to act to open the numerous reggae bills that the Maritime would host. I remember the drummer from that band was a fellow broadcasting student with me at S.F. State for a time, a nice fellow and a talented drummer, though his name escapes me. Strange today that their band name has been co-opted by the Golden State Warriors as the moniker for their fan base. I doubt they received any compensation as they would certainly have faced an impenetrable wall of high priced lawyers.\n\nBy this time, I was getting settled in recording with Pete and would soon be taking the reigns of recording all by myself. Chaotic as the process was, reggae shows presented a peaceful departure from the other shows since not only was Pete well versed in the style and how to mix it, he was often friends with the artists themselves, having worked with many of them on the Reggae On The River festivals. Often at reggae shows, the bands would use the same drum kit, making re-patching, labeling, and mixing for us a good deal easier as well. With clockwork consistently, the joints would be passed during these shows to the point where I would have to decline. I’d be zombified at the end of the night, Pete would hardly even be fazed.\n\nPete would keep the remaining roaches from his joints in a small Altoids mint tin that he’d keep next to the studio’s monitor amp. I would often pick out a handful of roaches to take home to carefully unwrap the papers from them and use the sticky resin coated weed chunks left over to be smoked in my pipe or bong. Pete would joke from time to time when putting new roaches into the tin that the “mice had been in there”, though I know he didn’t mind. He always had so much weed around that smoking the remains of those roaches would be an act of desperation to him. I remember once a charismatic, yet smart ass guy who worked there who would come in from time to time to smoke with us, wondered if he could could raid that roach tin sometime. Pete said that he’d hide it and if the guy could find it, he could keep it. He had the guy close his eyes and turn around and Pete simply slipped the tin onto its side and shunted it against the backside of the amp, like the Millennium Falcon clinging to the side of that Star Destroyer in “Empire”. And like that famous ship, the poor guy couldn’t find it no matter how hard he looked.\n\nSebadoh, Those Bastard Souls, Fill., SF, Sat., February 8, 1997\n\nI had already seen Sebadoh twice before, so this show was nothing new. Lou Barlow’s lo fi, tortured artist schtick was even starting to wear a little thin for me. The show was certainly a musically stylistic departure from the stoney, roots reggae of Third World, who I helped record at the Maritime the previous evening. However, I do appreciate that they did a cover of Tom Petty’s “I Won’t Back Down” that night, an obvious nod to the residency Mr. Petty had just wrapped up at the Fillmore earlier that week. Bob Fay was still playing drums for them, but would soon be fired and replaced by Russell Pollard. Lou’s painfully moody stage presence would further be hampered that show by what seemed like an endless stream of technical problems from the band, such as Lou breaking his capo and the snare drum needing to be replaced. One could hear a pin drop between to songs, the silence being as uncomfortable and awkward as the lyrics of the songs themselves.\n\nAs luck would have it, it would be the opening act, Those Bastard Souls, who would attract the most attention, not for their performance that night, but years later for what the drummer they selected to tour with them. Yes, none other than comedian Fred Armisen was playing with them that night. Of coarse, I didn’t know him from Adam at the time. Fred had been playing drums in various acts including Trenchmouth from Chicago for years and hadn’t had any notable comedy experience then. He would not even begin at “Saturday Night Live” until five years later. So, at least if somebody ever asks if I ever seen him live before, I can say yes, though I have no real memory of it. This is one of those reasons I insist to getting to shows on time and never missing an opening act and serves as a poignant reminder to pay attention to them, even if I’m not aroused by their music.\n\nArlo Guthrie, Fill., SF, Sun., February 9, 1997\n\nIt was nice to see mr Guthrie again, a year almost to the day after in the very same venue. He was just about to release a new album called, “This Land Is Your Land : An All American Children’s Folk Classic”, consisting of songs from his dad Woody’s catalog, the more silly ones, but also including “This Land Is Your Land” naturally. There would be two versions of that song the CD actually. I’d go on to see and record Arlo at the Maritime a year later, so I got a healthy dose of his stuff around that time.\n\nHe was playing alone this night, doing songs on both piano and guitar, doing two hour long sets with a twenty minute intermission. Like before, he’d tell long stories between songs, so long in fact, that the spoken word took up at least as much time as the music. Not a bad thing, if what being said is entertaining. Many artists I like such as Robyn Hitchcock, Ray Davies, Bunny Wailer, and Richie Havens did the same thing, though I think Arlo did it longer than any of them. Doesn’t matter. Arlo is a funny guy. I wish my recordings were louder, so I could actually hear the stories he was telling that night, but really, I can barely make it out. Pretty sure one of them involved his writing a song that he thought was awesome before realizing that he was ripping off “Swanee River” and another about when he and his mother were visiting China and stepped off the plane to hear “This Land Is Your Land” being played by a brass band which made his mother flip out. If he didn’t tell these stories at this show, it had to have been the one the year before.\n\nIt was also a relieving show, being the end of a 5 show out of 7 stretch, being an intimate one to boot. If memory serves, it was a seated gig. He played a few covers I knew including “The City Of New Orleans”, known mostly for being sung by Willie Nelson, likewise, for “Can’t Help Falling With You” and he also did “San Francisco Bay Blues” made famous a couple years before by Eric Clapton on his “Unplugged” album. He didn’t however play “Alice’s Restaurant”, the epic spoken word/ballad he was most known for and frankly, I’m glad he didn’t. It takes courage for an artist to do that and I appreciated it. Who can blame him, anyway? It’s over 18 minutes long. No poster that night, I’m afraid.\n\nThe Ohio Players, The Tommy Castro Band, Sweet Vine, Maritime Hall, SF, Fri. February 14, 1997\n\nThis would be my second Exotic Erotic Ball at the Maritime, but at least this time around they had some notable musicians performing. Like the last time, there were plenty of people strutting about in lingerie and they even had a costume contest in the middle of the show. I’ll never forget a couple during the contest had to be reluctantly broken up by Little Boots, the young stage manager, when the woman attempted to give her partner a blow job in front of everybody. I remember the woman was rather buxom, with short blonde hair and was wearing a black leather bodice. I couldn’t blame them for showing their affection though. It was Valentine’s Day after all.\n\nAnyway, back to the music. The Ohio Players had gotten a bump in popularity around this time after the Red Hot Chili Peppers did a cover of their hit, “Love Rollercoaster”, that appeared prominently in the film, “Beavis & Butthead Do America”. They were an appropriate act for the Exotic Erotic too since they were notorious for having naked or nearly naked women on their album covers back in the 70s. They were contemporaries amongst many funk pioneers back in those days, such a George Clinton, Rick James, and Earth, Wind, & Fire. Likewise, their music would go on to sampled numerous times in the future by famous hip hop acts like Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Snoop Dogg.\n\nThankfully, one of the openers was Tommy Castro and his band, a solid and reliable blues act that had been in the bay area for years. Tommy was only a few months away from releasing his second album, “Can’t Keep A Good Man Down” on the Blind Pig label. The man has talent for sure, not only as a guitarist, but also a singer. On the other hand, Robert Ward, the singer of the Ohio Players, was shall we say less sophisticated in his vocal stylings. Now I can’t say if, what, and how much drugs this guy had done in the past or at that show, but he sounded like a true bone fide crackhead that night. Not to say that it wasn’t a compelling performance, it was certainly memorable, so much in fact, that I can still picture his wild eyed rambling to this very day. Sadly, he passed away nine years later and most of the other original members have by now as well. So, I won’t be seeing the Ohio Players again, but Mr. Castro is alive and well and plays regularly.\n\nThe Dandy Warhols, Mover, Mumblin’ Jim, Bottom Of The Hill, SF, Wed., February 19, 1997\n\nSETLIST : Best Friend, Ride, Minnasoter, (Tony, This Song Is Called) Lou Weed, Boys Better, Nothin’ To Do, The Dandy Warhols’ TV Theme Song, (unknown), Not If You Were The Last Junkie On Earth, Genius, Be-In, (unknown), Cool As Kim Deal, Every Day Should Be A Holiday, It’s A Fast Driving Rave Up With The Dandy Warhols\n\nI remember distinctly the first time I heard the Dandy’s. My friend Tory had purchased their first album, “Dandy’s Rule OK”, and played it for me while we were driving in his car in Concord. From the first minute of their “TV Theme Song”, I was hooked. They were a band I was waiting to hear and didn’t even know it. It was refreshing to hear a sound with such vitality and accessibility coming from a new act and they hadn’t even hit the big time yet, so I was overjoyed to see that I’d be able to witness them perform for my first time at a club as small as Bottom Of The Hill. I’d be lucky to see them two more times that year, once more at Bottom Of The Hill and once at Slim’s, but I will of coarse get to those shows later. I can’t remember much about the openers. I only recorded one song from each of them, but I do know that Mumblin’ Jim derived their name from the 1968 cult movie, “Psych-Out”, being the name of the hippie band in the film fronted by Jack Nicholson.\n\nLike I said, they were still pretty new. Their sophomore album, “…The Dandy Warhols Come Down”, wouldn’t be released until that July, coincidentally on my birthday on the 15th, but they played plenty of new songs that night, over half the set in fact. I was blown away. The new material was at least as good as the first album stuff if not better. Songs like “Boys Better” and “Every Day Should Be A Holiday”, both favorites of mine, would go on to be in major motion picture soundtracks for such films as “Good Will Hunting” and “There’s Something About Mary” amongst others. At the end of the show, for the “Fast Moving Rave Up” song, Joel Gion from the Brian Jonestown Massacre came on stage with his maracas and made a mess while maintaining his usual stone faced expression. The Dandy’s long and dramatic history with the Massacre was detailed in the documentary, “Dig!” That would be released seven years later, so I will also get to that another time.\n\nOne aspect of their show that really shall we say focused my attention was the keyboardist, Zia McCabe, who promptly went topless as soon as their set started and remained that way. They say sex sells and thank God for that. I don’t know how much Zia’s boobs contributed to their ultimate success as a band, but I think many talented bands that fell by the wayside over the years might have made it to the big time if they had a brave young woman like Zia to get horny young men’s attention. Being San Francisco, I’m sure a few women were taken by her as well. California law forbids showing women’s nipples at a place that serves alcohol, but every time she did it, nobody protested. Zia would actually go on to pose nude for the Suicide Girls while she was pregnant in 2004. Alas, after their third album, she stopped doing going topless on stage, but I will always cherish the memory.\n\nBox Set, The Sunshine Club, Fill., SF, Fri., February 21, 1997\n\nThis show was sort of a locals night gig. The Fillmore was inclined to showcase local acts quite generously during those first few years after the reopening in 1994. Box Set had been around a few years, though I was unfamiliar with them. In fact, the lead singer/songwriter, Jeff Pherson, had attended SF State and was even briefly a Broadcasting major as I was. Additionally, he would play at coffee shops and cafes like The Owl & Monkey that I often frequented when it was still open back then. My friends Laurel and Alexis used to live in the apartment next to it. It’s a small town. I’d probably seen him around and didn’t know it. Jeff would also play at Simple Pleasures in the Outer Richmond which I pop into now again now that I’m living out this way. Box Set wrote good songs though and did a rousing cover of the Beatles, “Birthday” at that show, which they invited the crowd to sing along. It actually was Jeff’s 30th birthday that night and the crowd actually did sing him “Happy Birthday” to boot.\n\nBut this would be the only time I’d see Box Set or the opening act, The Sunshine Club, though I thought they were pleasant to listen to as well. Jordan Kurland, the fellow I used to intern for at the management of Primus, was managing them at the time. They had just released a CD called “Visit To A Small Planet” which I still own. Jordan was just beginning to get the Noise Pop festival on its feet back then and was managing low fi folk rock acts like Crumb, Matt Nathanson, and them. I’m pretty sure he was at that show that night. Mr. Pherson would go on to sing back up vocals for Furthur, the Grateful Dead alumni band in the future, so I probably saw him at least one more time since this gig.\n\nMerle Haggard & The Strangers, The Geezers, The Bulls, Maritime Hall, SF, Sat. February 22, 1997\n\nI was steadily getting into the old school so-called outlaw country guys around then, having seen Merle already once at The Fillmore, as well as a couple of his contemporaries like Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson. I appreciated that Merle was a Californian, born and raised in the central valley. Country music fans, not to mention the rest of the country in general, view this state with downright hostility sometimes and it’s good to remind them that this is this home of such a bad ass shit kicker as he. I’ve said before that horror metal guys like Marilyn Manson or guys from Cradle Of Filth don’t scare me, but believe me, one look into the eyes of Mr. Haggard when he’s in a foul mood will chill you to the bone.\n\nCase in point, this was one of those occasions when the headlining act at The Maritime found out about our recording facility and flat out refused to allow us to tape. It wasn’t totally unusual and from time to time even expected, but that afternoon during soundcheck, Mr. Haggard personally came down to the recording room to insure that we weren’t taping and gave Pete and me the stinkiest of stink eyes. We assured him that we would only be taping the opening acts and he backed away though reluctantly. Yes, he’s wasn’t a big guy, rather skinny and gaunt in fact, but he looked like he’d been through three world wars. Sad as it was that we weren’t allowed to record, it was as it was always on such occasions a release for me to go upstairs and watch the show with my own eyes. Thankfully, Merle would return a mere four months later to play The Maritime again and I’m happy to say that we recorded him that night. Don’t know if we had permission to, but I’ll get into that again when we get to the shows in May.\n\nThe Mermen, Dieselhed, Born Naked, Maritime Hall, SF, Fri. January 28, 1997\n\nSETLIST (BORN NAKED) : About Leary, Man Kills, Innocent, Me I Say (Minus One), F.R.I., Weeds, Instead, Sick Again, Prayer, John Henry, Reality, Bury Me\n\nThe Mermen weren’t at a level of popularity then to fill a place as large as the Maritime or even the Fillmore and most likely never will, but I suppose this was wishful thinking on the part of folks booking the show that night. They had been a steadily working band in the city and the bay area, opening for all sorts of people and remain one of the best go to bands around for an opening act. At least the city’s greatest opening act had a couple opening acts that were good too.\n\nI’d moved out of the place I was living in the Mission with Patrick, the manager of Born Naked, but I was glad to see the gang there that night. I always liked Born Naked and thought they deserved more success and that goes double for Patrick. He was a talented and hard working manager. I remember the band coming down to the recording room before the show and smoking a joint with Pete and me, though Pete thought they should have waited until after their set to do so, as not to interfere with their performance. Probably a good suggestion to most bands, but it didn’t affect them adversely as far as I could tell. I praised the band and told them they’d knock em’ dead that night to help boost their confidence. James, the bassist, was especially thankful I recall, saying to me, “We need more guys like this around us”, or something to that effect. At the end of their set, they did a blistering rendition of Smashing Pumpkins’ “Bury Me”, one of the Pumpkins’ best songs in my opinion.\n\nAlso opening that night, was Dielselhed, another local act that had talent. I’d see them open for Cake a couple years later and after their break up the band members would go on to play with other bands like Dengue Fever and The Tubes as well as solo projects. It was a tight show and though the attendance was sparse as predicted, we heard some quality music at that gig. The oil plate projections at the Maritime always seemed to be the most appropriate for the Mermen. Perhaps the liquids were channeling the spirit of the ocean.\n\nZero, New Riders Of The Purple Sage, Fill., SF, Sat., March 1, 1997\n\nWhy oh why on God’s green Earth I decided to see Zero at this point when I wasn’t working one of their infinite Maritime shows still escapes me. I assume I wasn’t completely sick to death of them at this time and probably was hoping there would be a poster. There was not, at least not for the show they did at the Fillmore that night. To make matters worse, Zero would do two sets and I’d have to wait until the beginning of the second set until I was cut from ushering and finally free to enjoy myself.\n\nAt lest The New Riders Of The Purple Sage were opening, truly one of the more worthwhile hippie bands and always an enjoyable opening act. I was fortunate to see them then because after a long series of line up changes in the band, they decided to call it quits shortly after this show. By this time John Dawson was the only original member of the act dating back to the mid 60’s. They had more ex members than Menudo, including Dead alumni, Jerry Garcia, Mickey Hart, and Phil Lesh. They’d get back together a few years later with original member David Nelson, but by that time Dawson had contracted emphysema and couldn’t tour anymore. He’d eventually die from it in 2009.\n\nAfter a few years of listening to hippie music under my belt, I was starting to recognize the songs, if only they were a couple covers of done by others. The Riders played “Ripple” by the Dead as their last song of their set and Zero did “The Weight” by The Band. My tapes ran out about six songs into the second set and having most of the show and no need to wait around for a poster, I called it an early night.\n\nSnocore ’97: Face To Face, The Pharcyde, Voodoo Glow Skulls, Salmon, Powerman 5000, Fill., SF, Mon., March 3, 1997\n\nAs the name of the tour suggested, this was a festival originally intended to play at ski resorts or around skiing communities, but after the first year, they brought it down from the mountains to be with us city folk at The Fillmore. The show was originally to take place at The Warfield, but was moved because of low ticket sales. I remember going to the first Snocore show up at Boreal, but didn’t record it and had my usual luck attempting to ski, which is none. Half the reason I went to that show was that Skankin’ Pickle was one of the bands. Honestly, I don’t even remember if I saw any of Sublime, the headliner, that day. In honor of Sublime’s recently fallen singer, they played a tribute video, being labeled the Sublime “Mini Movie”, between the sets of The Pharcyde and Face To Face that night. Between acts, they would also show snowboarding videos which helped pass the time. This show was also the perfect palate cleanser for listening to Zero’s hippie shit two nights before at the Fillmore.\n\nIt was a five band evening, but they went through the bands quickly, allowing only fifteen minutes between acts to change sets. First up was Salmon, a band for Los Gatos that had a short career, but I liked very much and was lucky to see them as many times as I did back then. Powerman 5000 was second, fronted by a fellow named Spider One, who was the younger brother of Rob Zombie. They had been signed to Dreamworks around that time and were often found on festival circuits such as Ozzfest. Third, was the always dependable Voodoo Glow Skulls. They never failed to get the crowd pumped up and moshing, starting their set with their punk cover of “Charlie Brown”. I love when they do their cover of “Here Comes The Sun” as well, possibly the best cover of that song I’ll ever hear.\n\nI know it might be borderline racist to say that The Pharcyde isn’t a band I’d normally associate with skiing or snowboarding, but that’s mostly because they’re from south central L.A., not because they are black. Not a lot of snow in their neighborhood. Nevertheless, they were great as they are always great and indeed I would go so far as to say they were the highlight of that show. Fatlip had left the group by then to pursue a solo career, but their split was amicable. Finally, there was Face To Face. I wasn’t a big fan of their music, but I did enjoy the way their frontman, Trevor Keith, would make silly faces when he sang, though he probably did it unintentionally. Everybody had pretty quick sets that night including Face To Face who only got fifty minutes to play, but no poster was given out.\n\nHieroglyphics, Ras Kass, Ci/Del, The Bums, Mike T, Skitzo, Fantastic Four, Maritime Hall, SF, Thurs. March 6, 1997\n\nSETLIST (HIEROGLYPHICS) : Eye Examination, The Undisputed Champ, See Delight, Let Em’ Know, Oakland Blackouts, Make Up Your Mind, unknown, unknown, unknown, After Dark, Mistadobilina, The Last One, 93 Till Infinity\n\nThe Hieroglyphics crew were quickly making a name for themselves around this time, especially for having Del Tha Funkee Homosapien amongst their ranks. Del had made a big impression from his first album, “I Wish My Brother George Was Here” years before in 1991 when he was just a lad of 18. He got a boost with that album, it having been produced by his cousin Ice Cube, who was already huge by then. Del went on to produce his own stuff from then on out after that album, but I still consider it to be his best work. Del sang the hit song, “Mistadobilina” from that album that night. Hieroglyphics wouldn’t release their first album until November of the following year.\n\nI’m pretty sure this was the first time I’d see the Hieroglyphics, but I would go on to see them countless times afterward. They would be ubiquitous in the bay area because of their three eyed “Have A Nice Day” symbol for their band, that would adorn T-shirts, hoodies, and stickers everywhere. I imagine they probably made at least as much money if not more off of their products as their music. I know the Wu-Tang Clan certainly did. There was a long line up of rappers that night, mostly good, but nights like these were chaotic backstage, trying to figure out who goes when and even more difficult to get the acts on stage on and off stage in a timely manner. I liked The Bums a lot and Ras Kass too, who was fairly new as well, having just released his first album “Soul On Ice” the previous October. Camp Lo was listed on the poster to play that night, but I don’t believe they were there. It wasn’t that well sold, but the crowd was comfortable. It was my sister, Erica’s, birthday that night, but I don’t think she was there, but I know I was thinking of her.\n\nWillie Nelson, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Maritime Hall, SF, Fri. March 7, 1997\n\nThis would be the first time I’d have the pleasure of seeing the great Willie Nelson. He was 64 years old by the time of this show and his reputation was already secure as solid stone in the annuls of music history. It was a good time for old school country guys partially because of the success of Johnny Cash’s “American Recordings” album, which helped boost the careers of other contemporaries such as Merle Haggard and Waylon Jennings during this period. The occasion was solidified in history by Boots, the Maritime’s cruel overlord, showcasing his semi-illiteracy, but misspelling Willie’s name on the poster as “Willy”. Yes, Willy with a Y, like the orca. I like to think that poster would be worth more because of it like those stamps printed long ago with the upside down airplane.\n\nAny-who, opening that night was Jimmie Dale Gilmore, a fellow Texan and long time respected singer songwriter. He and Willie had worked together only a few years prior to record Willie’s hit, “Crazy”, for the “Red Hot + Country” album, a benefit album to raise money for AIDS research. They were a good pairing for this bill. Incidentally, it was a strange shifting of gears stylistically once again since the night before on the very same stage was the Hieroglyphics. Apart from their love of marijuana, they have little in common with Mr. Nelson.\n\nLike I said before, Willie was already a legend by this time, with a repertoire so long, others discography, even veteran musicians would find themselves hilariously outgunned by the Red Headed Stranger. The year before, Willie released the album, “Spirit”, which would be his 44th, yes, get your head around that, 44th studio album. So, I had a lot of catching up to do getting to know him and his music apart from the hits. I knew little else about him at this time, apart from the trouble he’d been having paying what he owed the IRS just a few years before this show. I hope playing the Maritime helped a little in getting him back into the black.\n\nAnd what can I say about his performance, but to say it was magical. Each and every time I’d go on to have the honor of being in Willie’s presence, the feeling is always the same. I’d like to think that it is a similar sensation with being in the room with a benevolent entity like the Dali Llama or Santa Claus. Every concert I’ve been to when Willie was there felt as is absolutely no harm could come to me or anyone there. I felt totally safe. Perhaps then that this bit I’m writing is appropriate, since it’s the first installment of Bootleg Confessions that I’m doing since the coronavirus pandemic. My wife and I had been away for over a month visiting New Zealand and Australia and got back in country by the skin of our teeth. Thinking of Mr. Nelson gives me much needed reassurance during these times and if you are reading this while this pandemic is still going on, needless to say that in my opinion, listening to his music right now would not be a bad idea at all.\n\nThe Jazz Passengers with Deborah Harry, Connie Champagne & The Tiny Bubbles, Fill., Sun., March 9, 1997\n\nAt long last, I was to finally see Debbie Harry. Like many people my age, I grew up listening to Blondie and was a big fan. She was one of those iconic beauties that transcended into cultural icon status. Of coarse, back around 1980, I was but a boy who gazed upon her knowing instinctually that I admired her, but not knowing exactly why, much like I felt about Olivia Newton-John or Catherine Bach from “The Dukes Of Hazzard”.\n\nAs luck would have it, this time around, I would not be seeing her in Blondie, but with The Jazz Passengers, a talented but obscure jazz combo who had extensive history playing with such people as John Laurie, Jeff Buckley, and Mavis Staples. Debbie had joined the band the year before, releasing the album, “Individually Twisted” with them and would go on to tour with them for a couple more years before finally reuniting with Blondie in 1999. Still, better late than never and at age 52, she still looked stellar.\n\nThough I didn’t know any of The Jazz Passengers music, I liked it very much and saw immediately why she wanted to be associated with them. She had the feel of an elegant French cabaret chanteuse singer and if she could have lay down sideways on a grand piano in a shimmery dress, she would not of looked out of place. They did, however, dusted off a couple Blondie classics, “One Way Or Another” and their cover of “The Tide Is High”, reimagined in a jazzy rearrangement. And though I was a little let down that my first encounter with Debbie wouldn’t be Blondie proper, in hindsight I find myself extremely fortunate to have seen her in this group, being the only time I’d get the chance to see her tour with them. Pity there was no poster to mark this occasion.\n\nLive, Morcheeba, War., SF, Tues., March 11, 1997\n\nSETLIST : Rattlesnake, Freaks, Graze, Turn My Head, Shit Towne, Heropsychodreamer, Iris, Ghost, Century, Waitress, Love My Way, Operation Spirit, Lakini’s Juice, Gas Head, Lightening Crashes, I Alone\n\nI wasn’t a huge fan of the band Live, but back in those days, it was hard to avoid them. Their album, “Throwing Copper” had been a big hit, catapulting them to stardom almost overnight, though they’d been together since the mid 80’s. I knew their hit, “I Alone”, through “Beavis & Butthead”, as I knew lots of music back then. I remember them making fun of the lead singer’s ridiculous faces he’d make while singing. Yes, few singers such as Ed Kowalczyk get so completely emotionally wrapped up in their performance that it transcends into comedy, the singer of the band James, Tim Booth, definitely comes to mind. But in this case, Beavis was asking if Ed was John Belushi, definitely parodying Belushi’s over the top impersonation of Joe Cocker.\n\nRegardless, I was impressed very much by the opening act, Morcheeba. I remember my friend Drew went to that show mainly to see them. Though I didn’t get into them initially, a few years later, I borrowed their album, “Charango”, from my cousin Leslie. After that I was hooked and bought every album I could find. They were brand new in ’96, having just released their first album, “Who Can I Trust?” and it came at a good time. Trip hop stuff was just taking off and they were a little more upbeat than their sourpuss contemporaries, Portishead. Unfortunately, it would be another 11 years until I’d get a chance to see them again at The Fillmore, and by that time their original singer Skye Edwards had left the band, though she’d rejoin them a couple years later.\n\nIt was a sold out show that night and Live’s fans are definitely dedicated. In fact, tickets sold out within hours of their release. I remember there being some confusion of whether they were a Christian rock band, due to the video of “Lightening Crashes”. I recall Collective Soul had a similar problem. In the video, it took place in a hospital mostly and an old woman died and a baby was born, leading to think that they were pro-lifers or something. While the band’s stance on abortion was never made clear to me and it would be irrelevant anyway since I wasn’t that big of a fan. Besides, Ed the singer is a Buddhist. In any case, having Jesus freaks buying your stuff and going to your shows couldn’t hurt, though they probably didn’t spend a lot of money at the bar.\n\nOn a funny side note, I just learned that Ed played a bit part in the film, “Fight Club” a few years after this show. He played a waiter near the end serving Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter and he was clearly one of Tyler Durden’s followers, addressing Norton as such and having bruises on his face. When Norton asked that they be served “clean food”, Ed suggested not eating the clam chowder.\n\nThe Dirty Three, Low, The Sunshine Club, Bimbo’s, SF, Thur., March 13, 1997\n\nAlready a big fan of the band, this would be the fourth time I’d be seeing them. It was also a rare opportunity to see them or any show for that matter at Bimbo’s. It remains a rare occasion that they put on a gig there that I wanted to see and I wasn’t going to pass this one up for sure. Opening that night first were The Sunshine Club, who I still believe were being managed by Jordan Kurland, the fellow I interned for at Primus’ management. I’m pretty sure Jordan was there that night too. A pleasant band to listen to, but like them, Low, the second opener, were so low key, that the audience paid little attention to them. Strange, that a band with such intensity as The Dirty Three would choose either of them to open, but they would be a tough act to upstage by anybody. Low would go on a few years later to collaborate with The Dirty Three for an album called “In The Fishtank”, though I confess I haven’t heard it.\n\nBeing the fan that I was, I bought every album I could find of theirs otherwise. Warren, the violinist, had already collaborated with Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds by then and would become a permanent member to this day. Furthermore, he’d join Mr. Cave on several brilliant movie soundtracks and the band Grinderman. Thankfully, he’d still tour with The Dirty Three for years to come. If I’m not mistaken, Warren was still clean shaven around this time. He’d soon grow a beard that makes him look like Karl Marx or somebody Amish. I don’t blame him though. It’s a good look for him. They brought the house down that night as usual and I was glad to see that their latest album, “Horse Stories”, was a critical success, even being voted one of the top three albums of the year by Rolling Stone magazine.\n\nDoug Kilmer Benefit : Gary Duncan, Nick Gravenites, Martin Laftlin, Roy Rodgers, Huey Lewis, Austin Delone, Maritime Hall, SF, Fri. March 14, 1997\n\nThe hippies of the north bay are a tight knit group and when one of their own is in trouble, they circle the wagons. It was the case with Chet Helms, the first show of the Maritime being a benefit to help get him a liver transplant. It was also the case in this instance with Doug Kilmer. Doug was a bass player of renown amongst the hippies and he unfortunately fell ill with a near fatal case of pneumonia which left him hospitalized for months. As you can imagine, the bills were beyond belief and he needed a hand.\n\nDoug had played with practically everybody involved with the hippie scene in the bay area, but was best known for playing bass on the hippie anthem, “Spirit In The Sky”. It must be also noted that he played the funky bass line to “Right Place, Wrong Time” by Otis Rush in 1976. Many of his buddies came out of the woodwork on this one, including old members of Quicksilver Messenger Service, Commander Cody, and the one and only Huey Lewis. People forget that Huey and his band were north bay hippies before the 80’s. For more information on that, listen to Christian Bale’s monologue about Huey in “American Psycho”. Mr. Lewis popped by the recording room for a moment that night and I met him briefly which naturally was a treat for me. I saw him once more in the crowd at the Warfield in 2000 for the reunion of The Meters, but I’m afraid that I’ve never seen him perform with The News and now that he’s got permanent hearing loss, I won’t ever. God willing, I’ll see them perform in heaven some day, provided I outlive them of coarse.\n\nThey all played individually and together on stage that night, doing all the classics and all the songs that Doug himself played on. He would recover from his bout of pneumonia, but would move up north just outside Willits, performing from time to time, but mostly just looking after his children. Sadly, he succumbed to liver cancer in 2005, but in true north bay hippie fashion, his friends would hold a benefit for his family at the Sweetwater Saloon in Mill Valley.\n\nKRS-One, The Earthlings, Asha, Trip, Maritime Hall, SF, Sat. March 15, 1997\n\nRap artists can be, shall we say, challenging for folks at a venue from time to time. Many are professional, punctual, and downright nice. KRS-One, it turns out, seems to be the former. Now, I didn’t know this at the time and continued to be blissfully unaware of his bad behavior for years. Even after the unpleasantness that happened between him and the Maritime after this show, I wrote it off as underhanded dealings from his management and that KRS-One had nothing to do with it.\n\nThe show was lively and I have to give it KRS-One, he knows how to pump up the crowd, especially when he gets them going “WHOOP! WHOOP!” to his hit “Sound Of Da Police”. As usual, we had little Boots’ band, The Earthlings open up and they were mostly ignored as expected. What was unexpected, was what happened the weeks and months after this show. We gave him the VHS and DAT tape of his performance as usual. He signed off on the standard release, promising that neither of us would do anything with the recording unless there was some sort of mutual agreement between the parties, yadda, yadda, yadda. Most of the time, nothing comes from these recordings and we all just move on with our lives. As you can guess, that wasn’t the case here.\n\nYes, KRS-One, who’s real name is Lawrence Parker incidentally, quickly took excerpts from the show, called them 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Quarter, the first being “The Commentary” and the following ones were called “Free Throws” and put them on his new album, “I Got Next”. Anyway, we were not informed at all about his use of these tracks and naturally, we didn’t get an iota of credit in the liner notes, adding insult to injury. But we had him cold, having the ADAT masters and all the paperwork, so Boots, the owner, sued Mr. Parker. Pete and I even went so far to go to a fancy law firm in the Embarcadero, coincidentally the same lawyers that represent Jerry Garcia’s family, to take preliminary depositions to go to trial. Thankfully, once KRS-One’s people figured out that the jig was up, they quickly settled out of court. We got a little chunk of change and life went on. Pete believed back then that the money was more important than the credit and in the short term, especially these days, I tend to agree with him. However, looking down at the CD of the “I Got Next” album, I still feel the sting of our work not being recognized. After all, the album went Gold and remains KRS-One’s best selling solo album to date.\n\nTalking with other sound men years later, I passed on this story to them, but commented that I admired him for always using a microphone with a cord attached instead of a wireless one. The others went on to unload a diatribe of stories about his rudeness and that he was deaf as a post, forcing them to crank up his monitors to the point of feedback so he can hear. As the recording guy at the Maritime, I was fortunate to be locked away in the studio a floor below the stage, mostly oblivious to whatever drama was going on upstairs. Some stories I’d hear, but many would pass over me. Though I’d miss out on a good deal of interaction with these giants of the music scene, at least I would be spared from most of the ugly stuff.\n\nOn the lighter side of the story, Boots messed up the monthly poster again, misspelling “KRS-One” as “KRS-1”. He did the same thing to poor Willie Nelson who played only eight days before, spelling his first name, “Willy”. That’s two headliners misspelled on one poster. Sheesh…\n\nWaylon Jennings, JC Flyer, Maritime Hall, SF, Sun. March 16, 1997\n\nNo sooner than ten days after I get to see the one and only Willie Nelson at the Maritime, than none other than his contemporary, Waylon Jennings, plays there. It was an honor to finally see the man who’d I heard for so many years as the narrator or “balladeer” of “The Dukes Of Hazzard”. As previously mentioned, I was in love with Daisy as all of America was. He sang the theme song as you all know as well. To go over Mr. Jennings’ entire career, from switching seats with The Big Bopper, so he could go on the plane with Buddy Holly and Richie Valens on the Night The Music Died, to the Outlaw Country movement, “Luchenbach, Texas”, and so forth would take quite a spell, so I won’t go into it too deeply.\n\nLike Willie, Waylon was getting a boost from the popularity of Johnny Cash’s “American Recordings”, releasing his album, “Right For The Time”, the year before and even touring on a leg of the Lollapalooza tour. I wish I could have seen him on that one. Yes, I’m afraid that this would be the only time I’d get to see Waylon. Years of drug, alcohol abuse, and chain smoking would take its toll on him soon after. He’d lose his left foot to diabetes and it would ultimately take his life in 2002. He’d only live to be 64. But considering the mountains of cocaine he was ingesting and at one point, he smoked six packs of cigarettes a day, I think we can all agree that it was a miracle that he lasted as long as he did.\n\nOne of the reasons, if not the main reason he was still alive to play this show was because of Jessi Colter and it was an added bonus that she was there that night to sing along side him. She would be his fourth and final wife, having tied the knot in 1969 and she stuck with him to the bitter end. They would go on to have a son, Shooter Jennings, who would become a renowned country music musician in his own right. A beautiful woman, Jessi, and she has the voice of an angel too, having a respectable career as a solo artist. Just the year before this show, she released an album of children’s music called, “Jessi Colter Sings Just For Kids : Songs From Around The World”. It was a great show and the country crowd is always well behaved. Seriously, the drink like fishes, but you’ll never see a bar with more of a uniformly and efficient line in front of it.\n\nFiona Apple, Guadaloop, Fill., SF, Mon., March 17, 1997\n\nSETLIST : Child Is Gone, Sullen Girl, Sleep To Dream, First Taste, Slow Like Honey, Shadowboxer, Pale September, Criminal, Carrion, (encore), Never Is A Promise\n\nFiona Apple was a big deal back then, a fast rising star to say the least. With her release of her debut studio album, “Tidal”, only a tear before, it would go on to be certified triple platinum and garner her the Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance the following year for the song, “Criminal”. I wasn’t that familiar with her music and wasn’t the biggest fan of what I had heard, but I had friends who were, whose musical tastes I trusted. That, and it was St. Patrick’s day as well as the birthday of my friend, Matt Thayer, so I was in the mood for a show.\n\nBrilliant and prolific as Fiona was at such a young age, having released that debut album when she was only 19, it was no secret that she was marred by emotional problems and eating disorders. She was raped at age 12 leading to PTSD, that on top of depression, panic attacks, OCD, and other such ailments, would serve to make show business as obviously taxing profession to be part of. Live, I remember her stage vibe was tense to say the least. It was hard to have fun at that show because I couldn’t escape the impression that she really, really didn’t want to be there. I remember being miffed at some rambling comment between songs that she felt relieved when she got to hang out with stupid people. At least is was a short show, only ten songs, including the encore and I have yet to see her perform again after that night. I did appreciate the poster they gave out that night however.\n\nJon Spencer Blues Explosion, Sleater-Kinney, Fill., SF, Wed., March 19, 1997\n\nIt is a rare occasion when an opening act at a show matches in the talent of the headliner and an even rarer occasion when the opener surpasses it. This was a tough call. Both bands were pretty evenly matched and this being the first time I had seen either of them, I was floored by both. It’s shows like this that reinforce my stubborn belief that one must be on time to each and every show, to never miss an opening act. Because the one time you do, might be the show where you miss a band like Sleater-Kinney. Yes, this was one of those rare Fillmore shows that really cut ice, that really made an impression on me. And only a show of this stature could really make it to the top of the heap if it had a good poster and this one did, one of my favorites that year and really one of the best I ever got from The Fillmore.\n\nLike I said, I hadn’t seen either band yet, but I had heard about them from plenty of sources that they were good. Jon Spencer had already made a name for himself playing with such bands as Pussy Galore and Boss Hog and Sleater-Kinney was rising fast along with other female led bands of the so-called Riot Grrl movement, mostly from the Pacific Northwest. Sleater-Kinney were just about to release their third album, “Dig Me Out”, just a day shy of three weeks after this show, which would be a critical blockbuster for them, garnering them spots of many Best album and song lists. This would also be the first tour they would do with drummer Janet Weiss, who I’m sure gets jokes about her name being the same as Susan Sarandon’s character in “The Rocky Horror Picture Show”. Not her fault, of coarse. She was born in 1965, long before the movie came out. Regardless, her energy was intense, making her a perfect match for the band and they blew me away.\n\nLike many great bands back in that day, I’d been introduced to the music of Jon Spencer through “Beavis & Butthead” when they were watching the video of “Dang” from the “Orange” album. They loved it, a very rare thing for them, who usually pan or crack jokes through the videos. Butthead even proclaimed, “I didn’t know a video could kick this much ass!” Such a ringing endorsement was not to be taken lightly. Indeed, the Blues Explosion lived up to the hype with their frenetic energy and sheer raw power. They’d released the album “Now I Got Worry” the previous October and the music video for the song, “Wail”, was directed by none other than Weird Al Yankovic and the video for “2Kindsa Love” was directed by Mike Mills of REM, both additional ringing endorsements.\n\nSpencer’s wild stage antics and utter emotional ferocity on stage is seldom matched. I can only think of guys like James Brown or David Yow of The Jesus Lizard who even are up to that level of insanity. I was hooked and joined their armies of admirers of Sleater-Kinney and the Explosion that night without hesitation and would be fortunate to see both bands again soon afterwards. We were lucky to have Sleater-Kinney nearby on the West Coast and they would show up to all kinds of things in the future, but I and most others would have not predicted that Carrie Brownstein would go on to additional future glory and stardom as half of the renowned “Portlandia” cast with Fred Armisen.\n\nBlur, Papas Fritas, Fill., SF, Thur., March 20, 1997\n\nSETLISTS\n\nPAPAS FRITAS : Wild Life, Small Rooms, All Night, Explain, Just To See You, My Revolution, Live By The Water, Say Goodbye, Hey Hey You Say, Sing About Me, Possibilities\n\nBLUR : Beetlebum, Girls & Boys, Movin’ On, Coping, Stereotypes, Country Sad Ballad Man, M.O.R., To The End, End Of A Century, Inertia, Popscene, Chinese Bombs, Advert, Bank Holiday, Death Of A Party, (encore), Song #2, On Your Own, Look Inside America, Parklife, The Universal, Sing\n\nThis would be the third time I’d have the pleasure of seeing Blur at The Fillmore and I was beginning to think they would be around forever. But the Britpop movement was already fading away to low-fi bands like Pavement and bands like Blur were starting to change their sounds accordingly. Still good though, and one could argue that despite the change in tone of their music with the release of their fifth album, the self titled “Blur”, just a little a month before this show, their single “Song #2”, was solid Britpop.\n\nAdditionally, one would not have anticipated that a skinny, pale English band like Blur would be the creators of one of the most iconic sports anthems in all of human history with that song. But then again, one probably would have said the same about Gary Glitter. “Song #2” has been in countless commercials ever since as well, not to mention the episode of “The Simpsons” where Homer and his friends go to the Super Bowl. Anyway, back to the show. Opening that night was Papas Fritas, spanish for french fries if you were wondering. They were an indie rock band from Massachusetts, but I didn’t remember much about them and this would be the only time I’d see them, they breaking up only three years after this.\n\nBlur was on point that night as usual, but as usual, I had no idea that tensions between band members were already beginning to slowly break the band apart. Indeed, I’d only get to see Blur one more time at The Warfield later that year in October and after that, band members like Damon Albarn would go on to do other projects like Gorillaz. Poor Damon’s eight year relationship with Justine Frischmann of Elastica was falling apart, not to mention that he was trying to kick heroin too. Graham Coxon, the guitarist was battling a drinking problem as well. I guess it helps explain why these guys sweated so much on stage.\n\nThankfully, they would all go on to live through these problems, and despite dissolving the band for a few years in the 2000s, they would reunite again in 2008. I’ll go into their future stuff later when I get to their Warfield show in October. But I will end this thing on a happy note. The poster from their show at The Fillmore that night is one of very few posters that blesses the wall to my apartment at home here and been up there for the last seven years. Waking up to the sight of that joyful boy riding a rocket ship in my bedroom every day lifts my spirits. It is a work of art to be sure.\n\nSteve Kimock, Itchy McGuirk, Maritime Hall, SF, Fri. March 21, 1997\n\nKimock was a busy man around this time, playing with the many post-Jerry incarnations of the Grateful Dead, but he had one solo album under his belt. He had released “Psychedelic Guitar Circus” the year before and had enough clout to warrant a show of his own. I can’t rightly remember how well it sold or many details of the show actually. You must forgive me, between all his collaborations and the constant onslaught of Zero gigs, you can appreciate that many of his appearances blend, especially at the Maritime. Itchy McGuirk opened up, who managed to put out a few albums, but broke up not too long after this show. I learned that in 2012 however, they did do a 20th anniversary show to honor the untimely death of Mark Kafoury, one of their founding members. Kimock is still with us thankfully and as much as Zero got under my skin, I wish him well.\n\nDonovan, Mare Winningham, Fill., SF, Sat., March 22, 1997\n\nSETLIST: Hurdy Gurdy Man, Catch The Wind, Colours, Jenifer Juniper, Wear Your Love, Universal Soldier, Please Don’t Bend, Nirvana, Laleyna, Give It All Up, Everlasting Sea, Donna, El Dorado, Be Mine, Universe Am I, Sunshine Superman, Mellow Yellow, Barabajagel, Season Of The Witch, Atlantis, Sleep\n\nDonovan was one of those names that really cut glass from the whole Summer Of Love scene. Like many others then, he had started very young a few years prior to then, playing folk music on an acoustic guitar solo, before donning the paisley apparel and writing such hippie anthems as “Sunshine Superman”, “Hurdy Gurdy Man”, “Season Of The Witch”, and “Mellow Yellow”, all of which he played that night as you might expect. He would be a Zelig-like fixture in the late 60s, hanging out with everybody, even accompanying The Beatles and The Beach Boys on their expedition to see the Maharishi in ’68. His songs were utterly infectious which rightly earned him a place in the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame in 2012.\n\nTruth be told, though I did know the aforementioned hits, I knew little else about Donovan before this show. Despite my ignorance which I’m sure I shared with most Americans, it was apparent that we all knew his work whether we knew it or not. I liked the cover the Butthole Surfers did of “Hurdy Gurdy Man”, and many of his other songs had and would turn up in movies and TV, “The Simpsons” alone using at least a few. Even the songs “Universal Soldier” and “Season Of The Witch” were used for movie titles, the first, the Jean-Claude Van Damme action movie, the second, the third “Halloween” movie.\n\nI had heard a rumor that Donavan was gay, and whether he dabbled in homosexuality or not I cannot say, but I do know that he has been married to his wife for 50 years this year and has four kids, two from a previous relationship. Incidentally, the first two kids are actors Donovan Leitch and Ione Skye. Anyway, this show was special because, and I was oblivious to this as usual, he wasn’t in the habit of touring. After the 70’s, he put out only a few albums, rarely playing, at least not in the states.\n\nBut around the 90’s, interest in his work picked up again. Johnny Cash had found renewed success with “American Recordings” as I’ve mentioned many times before, and in a session with Tom Petty, the producer of that album, Rick Rubin, mentioned to Tom that he’d like to work with Donovan. Tom got them together and Rick eventually produced, “Sutras”, which was released the October before this show, one of only two new albums he’d release in the previous 12 years. It wasn’t a big hit like Cash’s, but at least it got him touring again. Dave Navarro from Jane’s Addiction even contributed to that album. It was a treat to see him, his charisma was undeniable and his voice still sounded golden. There was a photo taken of him that night holding one of the apples the give out to the public in the lobby of The Fillmore. That picture is framed and is still hanging in the Fillmore lobby to this day.\n\nThough I was far from an expert in the works of Donovan, I was pleased to experience another show with Mare Winningham, who opened that night. This would be the last of only two times I’d get to see her, both times at The Fillmore, the first opening for Arlo Guthrie the year before. She has the voice of an angel. Mare had been living in San Francisco at the time and had just released he second studio album, “Lonesomers”. She was already fairly well known for her acting work, especially for her Oscar nominated role in the film “Georgia”. She played the song “Hard Times” from the soundtrack, but surprised me when she played a very sweet cover of “All Apologies” by Nirvana, possibly the best cover of a Nirvana song I’ll ever hear. Maybe she did it in honor of Donovan’s song, “Nirvana”. Who knows?\n\nYes, it was a show for the ages, but considering the rarity and prestige of Donovan playing the Fillmore that night, I will never understand why there wasn’t a poster made for the occasion, a tragic omission to say the least. It was a long stretch for shows this month, doing nine shows in eleven days. March and October always are the busiest.\n\nSheryl Crow, Dishwalla, War., SF, Mon., March 24, 1997\n\nSETLIST : If It Makes You Happy, Hard To Make A Stand, Leaving Las Vegas, Every Day Is A Winding Road, Sweet Roselyn, Run Baby Run, A Change Would Do You Good, Good Thing, Stop Children, Baby Angels, All I Wanna Do, The Na-Na Song, I Shall Believe, Strong Enough, Treat Me Like A Fool, Not Fade Away\n\nBefore I continue with this thing, I just want to relate a quick story on the miracles of coincidence. A few nights ago, I was playing a round of trivia online with some friends while cooped up like everybody else during this coronavirus lockdown. During the music round, one of the songs was “Counting Blue Cars” by Dishwalla and between rounds the quizmaster played a song by Sheryl Crow. And lo and behold, what show is on the top of the pile of discs next to my desktop than none other than this one, Sheryl Crow with Dishwalla opening up. Now, the chances of this may not be up there with winning the Powerball, but it does make you think, if only just a little. Anyway, that’s the story. Back to the show.\n\nBy this time, I’d seen Sheryl so often in a short period of time, that it was becoming almost routine. But though this would be my third time seeing her at The Warfield, it would be my last. Her fame, commercial, and critical success from the first album, “Tuesday Night Music Club, was sustained by her second album, the self titled, “Sheryl Crow”. With songs like “Every Day Is A Winding Road” and “If It Makes You Happy”, the money and the accolades kept pouring in. The latter song, which she opened the show with that night would get her a Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance and the album would grab the Grammy for Best Rock Album.\n\nShe played all the hits and they were tight, sounding so rehearsed that live, they sound practically the same as their albums. That’s fine and I admit a hard thing to pull off with such precision. Punk rock, this is not. What did stand out that night was the couple of covers they did that night at the end of the show, the first being, “Treat Me Like A Fool”, by Elvis Presley and “Not Fade Away” by Buddy Holly. The latter was well known to all in the bay area, being a staple for The Grateful Dead to end their second sets with, but the former was special to me for the immortal serenade Nicolas Cage used it to sing to Laura Dern in David Lynch’s masterpiece of film, “Wild At Heart”. I even yelled up to the stage after the song, “Y’all have the same power E had!”.\n\nI noticed at the end of the show that the lyrics to “Treat Me Like A Fool” were printed out and taped on the floor in front of Sheryl’s spot. Being a civilized crowd that night, The Warfield hadn’t put up the barricade in front of the stage, so I did something I had never done before that show. Unable to get one of the stagehands’ attention while they were deconstructing the set on stage, I attempted to reach up and snag the printed lyrics myself. I was quickly accosted by one of the security guards and given a “you should know better” scolding. He recognized me, being one of the regular ushers, and I knew him. Though I didn’t know his name, I remember overhearing that he used to be a sailor in the Navy and like most security guards there, he was barrel chested and naturally, not one to argue with. I backed down and skulked out discreetly thereafter.\n\nScreaming Trees, Clawhammer, Lusk, Slim’s, SF, Wed., March 26, 1997\n\nSETLIST (CLAWHAMMER) : Caravan, Pigeon, Gnashville, Airplant, Sugar, William, Super Things, Hindsight, Blackeyed, Sick Fish Belly Up\n\nI had seen Screaming Trees a couple times, once on the “Alternative Nation” tour opening for Soul Asylum and The Spin Doctors at the Greek in Berkeley and once as one of the first acts on the Lollapalooza tour in San Jose the year before, and was impressed enough by them to catch them headlining one of their own headlining shows finally. During this time Josh Homme who I’d seen once in his old band, Kyuss, was touring with them as a guitarist, and he would of coarse later go on to fame and fortune as the frontman for Queens Of The Stone Age.\n\nIt was a fun show, but what made it memorable was a bit of a scuffle I had in the crowd that night. One ALWAYS remembers fights they have at shows. Those impressions never fade no matter how old you get. The tiff in question happened when I was up front and center right up against the stage at Slim’s. There was no barricade, there never is to my recollection, and it was a pretty sold out show, if not totally sold out. I can’t remember. Behind me in the pit was a handful of jocks who were all wearing, and I’m not kidding here, matching baseball shirts and baseball hats. They had no logo or anything, but they were the collarless type, white in the trunk, with black sleeves that ended just a little past the elbows. One could only assume that they belonged to some amateur team and went to this show right after a game.\n\nAssuming that, one can deduce that they had drank a good deal of beer which only would embolden their competitive urges, so these guys were doing their darndest to muscle their way up to front. One of these “Sport-O”’s in particular was trying to wedge his way between me and another guy and was doing so with such obnoxious aggression, that I took it upon myself to thwart his efforts with all of my strength. This brute even went so far as to jam his knee into the back of my thigh to try to gain leverage, but I didn’t budge. I did so for nearly the entire set and I must say that I was proud of myself for doing so. Such bullying should not go unchecked.\n\nNear the end, I finally decided when this fellow made one last push to get up front, I pulled a little Aikido on him, grabbed him by the back of his neck, and forcefully shoved him to the front, slamming him into the stage,ironically where he wanted to get to in the first place. Naturally, he took offense to this and he and his buddies started yelling at me, which was utterly futile since it was so loud, that I couldn’t understand a single word that they were saying, but their intentions were clear. I’ll never forget the lead bully, pointing his accusing index finger at my face, but I got his goat when I simply smiled at him while he did it. Then, much to my amusement, I lunged forward suddenly with my jaw and startled him when I went to bite his finger off. Of coarse my snapping jaw stopped short of the end of his finger, but the look on his face was priceless when he flinched.\n\nI backed away into the pit and watched the rest of the show knowing smugly that I got under his skin, but my ego was bruised a bit as you might imagine and it distracted from the show to say the least. In a strange coincidence, the Trees played a cover of Devo’s “Gut Feeling/Slap Your Mammy” near the end of the set, whose lyrics summed up my feelings towards my antagonist perfectly. The Trees had toured with Devo on the Lollapalooza tour like I said earlier the year before, and I assume they picked that song up as a tribute to them.\n\nOn the lighter side of the show, at the very end there was a sort of amusing little tidbit which helped me feel a little less violated. The baseball hooligans had left by the end of the set and the band was doing some kind of extensive jam for their encore.There was a fellow, a middle aged guy, who for some reason was egging Josh Homme on to let him sing or talk into his mic. For a while, it felt like Josh was going to oblige him, but he never did, though this guy never let up trying to get him to hand it to him. It was a long jam too. Very persistent people in the pit that night, I guess. Maybe it was something in the water. Anyway, walking out into the cool air after the show, I contemplated finding the jock’s car, smashing their windows, and slashing their tires. Good thing I didn’t though. That would have been wrong and if I got caught, well, let’s just say I would have been outnumbered.\n\nMarianne Faithfull, War., SF, Thur., March 27, 1997\n\nSETLIST : Alabama Song, Pirate Jenny, Bilbao Song, Complainte De La Seine, Ballad Of A Soldier’s Wife, The Boulevard Of Broken Dreams, Falling In Love Again, Mack The Knife, Don’t Forget Me, Surabaya Johnny, Street Singers Farewell, If Love Were All, As Tears Go By, (encore), Love Is Pleasing\n\nMarianne had been there and back again to be sure. I had heard of her, like most, from her cover of the Rolling Stones’ “As Tears Go By”, which she played for her last song of the set that night. Years of alcohol and drug abuse in the 70’s and a bad case of laryngitis changed her smooth soprano voice to one commonly described as “whiskey soaked”. Not that it was a bad thing, for it added an emotional character to her voice that was compelling. She was coincidentally in the news recently for having contracted the coronavirus. Though she is 73 and had the aforementioned health concerns, I’m pleased to report that she has made a complete recovery.\n\nThis show was an “evening with” show and a single set, making it a short one for ushering and it being an entirely seated show, made it a civilized one and silent as the grave. This was a welcome change to the tense scuffle I had the night before at the Screaming Trees show the night before, in fact the polar opposite really. She was playing that night with a single piano player, Paul Trueblood, accompanying her. Paul had been a renowned musical director and had played along side with such people as Michael Feinstein, Diane Keaton, and Matthew Broderick.\n\nFaithfull, after a long and steady recovery from her days of addiction and homelessness, had found success once again playing Pirate Jenny in a production of Kurt Weill’s “Three Penny Opera” in Dublin, Ireland, as well as playing Pink’s overbearing mother in the famous concert of Roger Water’s “The Wall” in Berlin in 1990. I’ll never forgive myself for not convincing my friends to see that show when we were backpacking across Europe that year. I don’t necessarily blame them for being weary, since we would have had no place to stay and were exhausted from traveling for previous six weeks. We watched it on TV from my friends grandparents’ place in Switzerland instead, which I have to admit was pretty cozy.\n\nAnyway, back to the show. With the success of her stint as Pirate Jenny, Faithfull released an album called “Twentieth Century Blues” comprised mostly of Weill’s songs. Weill made songs that most Americans knew but through other artists, most notably “Mack The Knife”, made famous by Bobby Darin and that annoying McDonald’s "
