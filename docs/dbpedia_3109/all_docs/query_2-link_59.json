        "text": "Anyone can be a global explorer. AUP’s global liberal arts education prepares you to live and work internationally – no matter where your journey began. We award over €6 million every year to students of all nationalities, with the aim of promoting economic diversity among our culturally diverse student body.\n\nAround 50% of students receive some form of financial aid – in some cases as high as 100% of tuition. Below, you’ll find more information on financial aid options at AUP. Unless otherwise stated, awards take the form of tuition abatement.\n\nTypes of financial awards and scholarships for undergraduate students\n\nHow to apply for a financial award\n\nOnce you’ve been awarded a financial award\n\nFinancial awards for current undergraduate students\n\nLoans for U.S. citizens and permanent residents\n\nGeneral financial aid questions\n\nOther scholarships, awards and grants\n\nMerit Awards and Scholarships at AUP for Undergraduate Students\n\nThe awards below are based on your profile and background, not on financial need. AUP will automatically consider you for these at the point of admission to the university. All of these awards are limited to incoming, degree-seeking students. Visiting students and First Year Abroad students are not eligible. Students initially admitted as degree-seeking students and were awarded merit aid, cannot keep the award if they change to an ineligible program. Current students at AUP who were not initially awarded at the time of admission are not eligible.\n\nMore information is included in the drop-down menu for each award just below.\n\nNeed-based Tuition Awards at AUP\n\nAUP processes need-based Tuition Awards drawing on the information included in the student’s admissions application and combining it with an evaluation of a family’s financial need. You must request and complete a financial aid application to be considered for this award. The average total Financial Aid package at AUP is about 33% of tuition and the majority do not go over 50% of tuition. There are limited exceptions including our 100% Tuition Scholarships and our 75% AUP Scholar Awards.\n\n100% Tuition Scholarship\n\nAUP awards a very limited number of 100% scholarships every year to high-achieving students in need of financial assistance. These awards recognize students with outstanding academic achievement, strong co-curricular engagement and a profile that suggests they will excel in AUP’s diverse, international community. If you see yourself as a leader and motivator with a track record of community engagement and an interest in diverse cultures, languages and perspectives, then you may be eligible for this award. Recipients become figureheads in the AUP community, empowering their peers and committing to personal development and academic exploration throughout all four years of their undergraduate degree.\n\n100% tuition abatement\n\nAwarded at the time of application (first-year students only)\n\nThe separate AUP Financial Aid Application is required for consideration of this award\n\nAUP Scholar Award\n\nAUP awards a limited number of AUP Scholar Awards to students with exceptionally strong academics, proven financial need, and a clear demonstration that they would flourish within the AUP community. The award is combined with other forms of financial aid representing a total package of 75% of tuition. AUP Scholars will be asked to contribute in various ways to the development of our vibrant, international student body. Activities that may be required include volunteering as an AUP Student Ambassador, participating in special AUP events, communicating with prospective students and alumni, student blogging, and social media campaigns.\n\n75% tuition abatement\n\nAwarded at the time of application (first-year students only)\n\nThe separate AUP Financial Aid Application is required for consideration of this award\n\nHow to apply for a tuition award\n\nWe ask you to fill out an online application and submit a number of supporting documents. New students can apply for a tuition award after having submitted their application for admissions. The application for a tuition award and any supporting documents will in no way affect the admissions decision. To apply, just follow these steps:\n\nSelect “yes” when asked, in your admissions application, if you are interested in receiving scholarships and financial aid, or if you intend on applying for a tuition award.\n\nYou’ll receive an email with a link to your Application Status Page as soon as your application for admissions has been submitted.\n\nClick on the Financial Aid button on your Application Status Page.\n\nComplete your online financial award application and submit the required supporting documents.\n\nAmerican citizens and U.S. permanent residents must also file the FAFSA.\n\nOnce the application is complete with all documents, and you’ve been accepted to AUP, we’ll review the application and send you the decision via email.\n\n​Contact the Admissions Team if you have any questions about the procedure or your award.\n\nOnce you have been awarded a tuition award\n\nTo accept a tuition award, you must confirm your attendance and complete all the steps in the online confirmation process, as detailed in your acceptance email. Please pay attention to any dates on the tuition award letter as the offer may only be valid for a limited time and may be different from other admission deadlines. The official award is final, but in certain cases you may request a re-evaluation of your file (contact your Admissions Counselor to learn how to submit an appeal).\n\nThe amount in your award letter is for a full-time course schedule. Should your credit load decrease or increase in future semesters, you’ll maintain the same percentage of the financial award. In other words, your award amount will be pro-rated.\n\nIf you’re an American student or U.S. permanent resident, please read the loan eligibility information outlined in your award letter carefully. Let your admissions counselor know right away if you plan on applying for loans.\n\nFinancial awards for current undergraduate students\n\nAll undergraduate students receiving a merit award or scholarship or a need-based tuition award must maintain the required minimum cumulative GPA for their award.\n\nCurrent undergraduate students who have never received a tuition award can submit a tuition award application and the required supporting documents to be considered for a tuition award for the following semester. A minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 is required to be considered. Completing the application well before the beginning of the semester is encouraged. New applications will not be considered if a complete application is not on file before the first day of the semester. Contact admissionsaup.edu to receive a copy of the online application form and a list of supporting documents required.\n\nCurrent undergraduate students receiving only a merit award or scholarship, including former Global Citizenship Scholarship awardees must also maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0.\n\nLoans for U.S. citizens and permanent residents\n\nStudents and permanent residents from the United States can obtain U.S. federal and private loans to help finance part or all of their studies. The available loans are:\n\nFederal Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans\n\nFederal Direct Parent PLUS Loan\n\nSallie Mae Smart Option Loan\n\nEarnest Student Loans"
