        "text": "“One thing most people don’t know about phlebotomy is the significant emotional and psychological aspects involved in the job. While the technical skill of drawing blood is crucial, it’s equally important to have a good bedside manner. We often encounter patients who are anxious or fearful about needles, and it’s our job to help them feel comfortable and reassured.”\n\nSadie Skorjanc, AAS, Travel Medical Assistant and Phlebotomist, Aya Healthcare\n\nMedical technology continues to advance, and people are living longer than ever. Several careers exist to meet the concurrent rise in demand for medical services. One such profession is phlebotomy, the medical science of puncturing a vein to draw blood or introduce fluids.\n\nThere are a variety of phlebotomy schools that prepare candidates for their certification exams and for rewarding jobs in this medical field. In order to work effectively, these professionals must be uniquely trained in not only the technical aspects of the occupation but also in communicating with patients and medical staff.\n\nPhlebotomy schools offer programs for these aspiring professionals, which typically take less than one year to complete. The phlebotomy classes can vary in length depending on the electives offered, the state where the program is completed, and the accrediting body. Community colleges, technical schools, or vocational schools offer many programs. These postsecondary programs normally involve both classroom and laboratory portions, with courses such as anatomy, physiology, and medical terminology. Completing a supervised externship in a medical setting is also common.\n\nSeveral organizations offer certifications for phlebotomy technicians, which are covered below. Candidates generally need to complete an accredited program from a phlebotomy school and have some clinical experience (e.g., externship). After completing these prerequisites, individuals may be qualified to take a certification exam. These tests normally involve a written portion and a practical component to demonstrate the candidate’s efficacy at drawing blood.\n\nAccredited Phlebotomy Degree & Certificate Programs\n\nA range of phlebotomy schools can help prepare a candidate for certification and a career in this growing field. These programs are generally offered through community colleges and technical schools, but there are other options as well. While there are no programs that can be taken exclusively online due to the necessity of a lab component, several phlebotomy schools offer flexible options for their students where many of the courses can be taken remotely.\n\nFinally, most phlebotomy schools have a few requirements for interested candidates. Prospective students typically must have the following:\n\nHigh school diploma or GED\n\nCPR certification\n\nImmunizations\n\nIt’s important to check the varied requirements of phlebotomy schools prior to completing the application.\n\nO*NET offers a tool to help individuals find programs within their state.\n\nHere is a sampling of accredited programs taken from the five states with the highest employment levels in this occupation: California, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.\n\nCalifornia Phlebotomy Programs\n\nAccording to the BLS (May 2023), California has the highest level of employment for phlebotomists at 13,010. This is one of four states that requires its phlebotomists to have a special state certification before practicing the profession.\n\nLong Beach City College\n\nThe Long Beach City College, a public two-year institution, offers a phlebotomy technician certificate of achievement as part of their medical assisting associate’s degree. It generally takes two academic years to complete.\n\nIn California, Certified Phlebotomy Technician 1 (CPT 1) is the official job title for these professionals. The state approves this program and involves two courses in addition to a clinical portion. The first course, AH220, is a hands-on class involving blood drawing from a practice mannequin and later from one’s classmates. It teaches safe procedures for the withdrawal, usage, and disposal of blood. The final course, AH220AD, offers students the opportunity to use their new blood-drawing skills under the supervision of licensed phlebotomists and clinical laboratory scientists.\n\nStudents are required to spend at least 50 hours in a supervised medical center before completing the program.\n\nLocation: Long Beach, CA\n\nAccreditation: Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC)\n\nExpected Time to Completion: 24 months\n\nTexas Phlebotomy Programs\n\nTexas has the second-highest number of phlebotomists at 13,080.\n\nLone Star College\n\nLone Star College offers a hybrid phlebotomist certificate preparing students for the national phlebotomy exam which is required by the National Healthcare Association. Comprising 144 clock hours, this certificate program also prepares students for 1 of 2 national exams at the American Society of Clinical Pathologists (ASCP) or National Center for Competency Testing (NCCT).\n\nLocation: Kingwood, TX; Conroe, TX; Cypress, TX; Houston, TX; Tomball, TX\n\nAccreditation: Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC)\n\nExpected Time to Completion: within a year\n\nOther Phlebotomy Programs of Note\n\nColumbus State Community College\n\nColumbus State Community College’s phlebotomy certificate program is a NAACLS approved program that offers two courses to teach blood collection, handling procedures, and basic equipment usage. Additionally, these classes teach students about safety, medical ethics, and professional standards. Students will also be exposed to a clinical experience where students will complete 100 clinical hours and 100 venipunctures.\n\nGraduates of this 9-credit program will be eligible to take the certification exam through the American Society of Clinical Pathology (ASCP).\n\nLocation: Columbus, OH\n\nAccreditation: The Higher Learning Commission (HLC)\n\nExpected Time to Completion: Two semesters\n\nBucks County Community College\n\nBucks County Community College, a public two-year school, prepares students for a range of employment responsibilities, including drawing blood and processing specimens.\n\nStudents in this program will be prepared to work as phlebotomists at several healthcare settings such as commercial laboratories, medical clinics, hospitals, and other settings where blood is collected from patients. The program also includes an externship that offers students 120 hours of practice in a clinical off-site facility. During this externship, students will be required to perform 100 successful unaided blood draws.\n\nThe program consists of 17 credits and includes courses in medical terminology, basic human anatomy, medical law and ethics, and phlebotomy procedures and techniques. After completing the phlebotomy classes and externship, students are eligible to sit for the certification exam.\n\nLocation: Newtown, PA\n\nAccreditation: Middle States Commission on Higher Education\n\nExpected Time to Completion: 15 weeks\n\nIn sum, most phlebotomy schools offer one-year programs comprising two courses. These combine the theoretical and clinical aspects of drawing blood. They traditionally involve coursework and an externship, where the students can practice their techniques on mannequins and finally live subjects, normally their classmates, to prepare them for the certification exams.\n\nHybrid & Online Phlebotomy Programs\n\nPhlebotomy schools offer several options for students seeking flexibility in their course schedules. Although programs require students’ presence during their programs’ clinical, laboratory, or externship portions, some schools offer the opportunity to complete their coursework remotely.\n\nCLIMB Program at Portland Community College\n\nFor example, the CLIMB Program at Portland Community College (Oregon) offers a hybrid format combining 40 hours of clinical experience with five hours of self-directed study. This format can be ideal for people with families, full-time jobs, or other time-constraining circumstances.\n\nThe practical instruction involves training in venipuncture, specimen collection, and blood-borne pathogens. This program may be especially useful for those with some experience in a medical environment who are looking for more clinical experience and didactic training in venipuncture, skin punctures (e.g., finger sticks, heel sticks, etc.), and point-of-care testing.\n\nPlease note, however, that some experience in a medical facility is necessary for this program, which calls for 100+ supervised blood draws. This is part of the crucial training for the American Society of Clinical Pathology (ASCP) Phlebotomy Technician National Registry Examination administered by the Board of Certification (BOC).\n\nLocation: Portland, OR\n\nAccreditation: Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU)\n\nExpected Time to Completion: 45 hours\n\nSouth Central College of Minnesota\n\nAlso, the South Central College of Minnesota provides a hybrid phlebotomy program. It offers a significant portion of the technical instruction online, which can be completed before the laboratory work. Candidates for certification must work for at least one year as technicians in an accredited laboratory prior to taking the ASCP exam. This work must be at least 35 hours weekly and involve both venipuncture and microtechniques.\n\nThe 16-credit program includes courses such as introduction to phlebotomy, phlebotomy skills, phlebotomy internship, medical terminology, and interpersonal communication.\n\nLocation: Faribault, MN\n\nAccreditation: Higher Learning Commission (HLC)\n\nExpected Time to Completion: Within a year\n\nAlvin Community College\n\nFinally, at Alvin Community College (ACC), applicants must meet the following criteria prior to admission: have a high school diploma or GED; pass a criminal background check; complete the online application; show proof of specific immunizations and submit a completed health form documenting a physical examination; and have valid CPR certification.\n\nThis one-semester program also has a hybrid format with online classes and hands-on lab experience. This phlebotomy school teaches a number of skills, including capillary skin punctures, specimen collection at different ages, patient identification, specimen labeling, ethics, and medical terminology. Most of the assignments and tests at ACC can be completed from home.\n\nLocation: Alvin, TX\n\nAccreditation: Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC)\n\nExpected Time to Completion: One semester\n\nSchool City State Website GRADS ('21) American National University Salem Virginia https://www.an.edu/locations 42 Santa Fe College Gainesville Florida https://www.sfcollege.edu 27 Bossier Parish Community College Bossier City Louisiana https://www.bpcc.edu 16 Ultimate Medical Academy Clearwater Florida https://www.ultimatemedical.edu 10 Montgomery Community College Troy North Carolina https://www.montgomery.edu 3\n\n'20-'21 School Data from IPEDS (Sourced in September, 2023)"
