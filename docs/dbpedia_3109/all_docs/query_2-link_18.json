More Information 1/26/2024 Hub-CMI and CMI Spotlight Nominations More Information\n\nCelebrating Ten Years of Certification!!!\n\nTen Great Reasons to Choose the National Board.\n\nValid National Credentials – Our exams are validated by a third-party organization (PSI), delivering psychometric quality, statistical analysis and professionally sound test form assembly. The Hub-CMI credential and CMI certifications continue to be very VALID and highly recognized credentials for their standards and excellence.\n\nRigorous/High Standards –The NBCMI verifies that each candidate meets ALL the prerequisites prior to testing, delivering high quality and rigorous written and oral exams:\n\nThe written exam focuses 61% on medical knowledge, 15% on code of ethics, and the remaining 24% focuses on roles of the interpreter, cultural awareness and legislation and regulations.\n\nThe oral exam focuses 35% on medical terminology within the context in two languages, 30% on mastery of linguistic knowledge in English and target language, 25% on consecutive interpreting and sight translation from English to the target language and 10% on cultural awareness.\n\nTesting:\n\nExams can be scheduled YEAR-ROUND at a mutually agreed upon time at one of our many testing centers.\n\nWe offer the convenience of testing from home through ProctorU online proctoring, using a cutting-edge methodology for certification programs.\n\nInitial Credential is the Hub-CMI\n\nThe Hub-CMI is a non-language-based assessment that is available to all interpreters who successfully pass the written exam.\n\nIf an oral assessment is NOT available in your target language, you may continue to renew your credential every 4 years to maintain it.\n\nFULL Certification in More Languages – The National Board offers FULL certification in six (6) languages: Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Russian, Vietnamese and Korean.\n\nWhat this means is that all of our six languages are fully tested in written and oral, not only in English, but also in the interpreter’s target language.\n\nThis meets the definition of a qualified interpreter by the Joint Commission, as well as by the Affordable Care Act Section 1557.\n\nFive-Year Recertification – Our CMI certification is valid for five years, making it more cost effective.\n\nCredential Maintenance – Requires 30 hours of continuing education units, which can be done within a four year span for the Hub-CMI credential and a five-year span for the CMI certification. Continuing education MUST focus on medical interpreting and medical knowledge courses, maintaining the high standards for both credentials.\n\nOnline Registry - The NBCMI registry is public. Prospective employers can search our registry and contact our interpreters by email. What a great way to boost your visibility and improve job opportunities! It also allows prospective employers to verify credentials.\n\nInternational Recognition - The CMI credential is internationally recognized.\n\nPioneers in the Industry – The National Board was founded in 2009 and was the FIRST to offer certification for medical interpreters nationwide, setting the testing standards.\n\nIMIA – The National Board is proud to be an independent division of the International Medical Interpreters Association (IMIA). The IMIA was founded in 1986 and in 1987 published the first Code of Ethics for medical interpreters.\n\nOFFERING FULL CERTIFICATION IN SIX LANGUAGES\n\nSpanish Russian Mandarin Cantonese Korean Vietnamese\n\nMedical interpreters are a key component of the care team when assisting persons with limited English proficiency. Since 2009, the National Board of Certification for Medical Interpreters (National Board) has helped thousands of interpreters further their careers through its excellent credentialing program, by which professional medical interpreters demonstrate they have met nationally set standards to ensure patient safety and compliance with federal guidelines and requirements. Once a candidate passes the certification exams from the National Board, they are bestowed the CMI Credential (Certified Medical Interpreter).\n\nThe careful vetting process and high standards held by the National Board are just some of the reasons employers and care providers prefer working with CMIs--knowing they will be compliant with regulatory guidelines, provide complete and accurate interpretation, and promote patient safety.\n\nThe first step is to register and be assigned a Program Adviser. Your Program Adviser is dedicated to helping you succeed and achieve certification. We invite you to take the first step toward the many benefits of being certified -- register for the CMI program today!\n\nClick Here to Register!\n\nAs demand for certification grows and becomes an industry standard, the National Board's CMI credential will open career and professional development opportunities that no other credential can.
