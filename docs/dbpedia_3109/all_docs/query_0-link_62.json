The better half and I headed north to the casino for the July 4 show and made a night of it staying over and getting well prepared for the ensuing fun.\n\nThe concert hall was a box that holds about 4000? and we were middle centre half way up. They played a long set for a casino gig and were chased off by a big bear at the end.

Years later when I listen back to bootlegs, the solo still amazes me, but the depth of his groove is what keeps me coming back to that era. An incredibly subtle and tasteful cat.

As many of you know, in 1996, Walter sang Jack of Speed with different lyrics and a bluesier, faster tempo than on Two Against Nature and during Tour 2K when Donald sang lead. Well, at this last show, Ricky kicked up the tempo back to 1996. This is speculation on my part, but it looked like everyone but Donald knew this was going to happen. Maybe I'm wrong. Anyhow, it was really cool.\n\nThanks and rest in peace, Ricky.\n\nJim\n\nDate: Thursday, December 19, 2013, 16:59:56 ET\n\nPosted by: Bearer of Bad News, NYC\n\nalthough it is yet to be officially announced by his family, former Yellowjackets, Michael Jackson and Steely Dan (among others) drummer Ricky Lawson has passed away.

The man has let his sarcastic style aside and what appears is a great respect for the music, the musicians, some of you won't agree but to me the book was also full of sincerity and respect , towards his audience particularly, showing it's not always easy to stay at the same level of excellency when the venue is bad and the audience is full of tv babies talking during songs, taking pictures, but doing is best to deliver the most honest performance.\n\nAnyway, in those days of low activity in terms of Dan music, some weeks ago I suggested that you could listen to Robert Kraft's stuff. HMV Japan just rereleased all his albums plus a live one never released before, recorded in N.Y with a young John Herington on guitar. You'll find some of his music on youtube:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yqz5BFMwxg&hd=1\n\nEnjoy this one first, I wish you could hear \"Groove speed\" as well, very Steely Danish really.\n\nOf course you can order the cd's one by one but I suggest you got the boxset because once you're trapped you'll end up ordering all of them anyway.\n\nPlease come back to say what you think of him, or drop me a line if you wish.\n\nHave a nice pre Christmas rush week\n\nAmicalement\n\nPhilippe, not Michael !\n\nDate: Saturday, December 14, 2013, 19:46:59 ET\n\nPosted by: Sam,NYC\n\nre: American Hustle.

I originally wasn't much of a fan of their solo stuff (except Nightfly, and Sunken Condos is a blast).\n\nI'm somewhat embarrassed to say I had never checked out Walter's solo albums until very recently. What the hell was I thinking? or not thinking. Circus Money is the bomb. One amazing song after another, not a weak one in the bunch. To me this is very different from Don's material and from Steely Dan. There's a darker edge to it. Walter's voice, while a bit more conventional and less distinctive than Don's, is excellent. His phrasing is dead on and so is his intonation. He goes from tender and wistful (Bob is Not Your Uncle) to harsh and brutal (God's Eye View) easily.\n\nThis CD is on constant rotation in my car and house.\n\nNow I am getting into 11 Tracks of Whack, which sounds distinctly different and more stripped down. So far so good but I haven't listened to it enough to make informed comments. I'll report back on it soon...\n\nDate: Thursday, December 12, 2013, 18:23:45 ET\n\nPosted by: hutch,\n\nMichael - Thanks for that link.

DFs book was amusing. Read it and sold it on eBay. Maybe he hates his fans sometime, maybe not. Ask any doctor.....I am sure some of them hate some of their patients some of the time.....some hate all of their patients some of the time......some hate some of their patients ALL of the time......but none hate ALL of their patients ALL of the time. If they do, it's time to get out. As for the no-shows at the book signings.....get over it. The question is on you.....what were you doing there in the first place? Nothing better to do? We like the MUSIC, the albums and the concerts. Not autographs, not books, MUSIC.\n\nSeveral years ago, when I was still commuting from Idaho to Phoenix for stints of work, I had rigged my itinerary to include a layover in Denver for the sole purpose of seeing DFs solo gig there. Traffic and airport security caused me to miss my flight and getting on a new itinerary was convoluted as heck....\"if I'm not in downtown Denver by 8PM, you may as well fly me straight to Phoenix\".....the gate agent was super nice, and a month later when I went back to the airport and tried to find her to tell her this story, I found that she was permanently on sick leave due to a recurrence of breast cancer (she later died). My revised itinerary included a plane change in Salt Lake, with a negative layover. Miraculously, I made the plane change. Got to the airport and when the rental car shuttle got stuck in traffic (the driver was Jamacain and in no hurry), I disembarked and RAN about half a mile to beat the shuttle to the rental car center, beating everyone else on the bus to the line. Then the lines for a rental car. Then the drive to downtown Denver and finding a place to park. Ran like a bandit and got to the door of the Tower theater at straight-up 8:00. Door was locked. Sign said \"Concert postponed due to travel problems for the band\". Was I pissed? No, I laughed and said \"the joke's on me, I'm too old for this, I have a family now\".\n\n2. Bought the Mark Masters Ensemble CD \"Everything You Did\" recently. This is a very different CD of Dan covers. Jazz. Won't give track listings, but a few are songs never done live by the duo. Several of the songs are almost unrecognizable. It was actually fun to play \"Name that Tune\" while listening to them. In fact, \"Do IT Again\" sounds something like a Christmas song in parts.\n\nGrab a copy\n\nLater.\n\nDate: Mon, November 25, 2013, 17:05:01 ET\n\nPosted by: Trez, here\n\nI'm jonesin' for an ELS HOME Stereo system.

While I'm not often a fan of these reworkings, JJ's version of Ellington's I'm Beginning to See the Light was really fantastic. I will have to check out more from that album.\n\nAs for mobile audio, I'm in a similar situation. My CRV has very ordinary sound. It's a 3-year lease and I have one more year on it. The next vehicle (buy or lease) will have decent sound. I had great sound in my old BMW 740 and even the Grand Cherokee Limited I drove in while in So Cal had a pretty nice Infinity Gold system. It did have an unfortunate preference for country music, though.\n\nDate: Mon, November 25, 2013, 14:16:09 ET\n\nPosted by: hoops, on the quick\n\nSome cool stuff about the ELSSurround system. http://www.acura.com/ELSSoundSystem.aspx Nifty! (Several bits of info including an especially cool clip with ELS and Joe Jackson talks about Steely Dan a touch.)\n\nNine years, close to 150K miles (mostly city) and $3K repairs due on the last NYTFLY --so I had to retire it. Acura is out of my budget, so I've been wrestling with the surround system packaged on the new NYTFLY which I've been really fortunate to purchase. Very happy with the car except the sound system is a mixed bag. It's a cross over, I'm tall so my head is above certain typical listening points and there's one speaker that I'd like to smother with a pillow--but I will simply disconnect it when enough months have gone by.\n\nBeen driving it -- and tweaking the equalizer--with The Nightfly, Aja and Circus Money, as well as Stevie Wonder's Innervisions, Kind of Blue, Best of John Coltrane, Marvin Gaye compilation (Gold), Donna Summer's Bad Girls Deluxe, Van Morrison's Sense of Wonder and Avalon Sunset and Lou Reed's New York and 2003 compilation. Like I said, I find myself adjusting the equalizers. A lot of it is more familiar stuff as I get the hang of the sound and adjusting it. I suppose that's a good sample of what I've been listening to lately.\n\nBased on that selection, I'd say I'm attracted to crabby artists, half of whom are dead.\n\nDate: Mon, November 25, 2013, 01:33:25 ET\n\nPosted by: Lutz, SF\n\nThank you, Napoleon for that link, Hutch, other that promote creative and organic grooves here.\n\nLalah Hathaway, wow.\n\nOrdered that Snarky Puppy family night dvd today, all the other singers are amazing if not stunning as well.\n\nWish I was at that show, would have traveled for that one.\n\nThat $200 pancake show in August was fine too, in retrospect just one too many for me.\n\nI believe Donald when he says each show takes that much out of him.\n\nimo they just schedule too many for them to enjoy it, that's show biz I suppose.\n\nWould he do an extended Vegas gig at Ceasar's or the Hard Rock?\n\nSantana was brilliant there and relaxed, Dennis on drums no less.\n\nUs suckers would go.\n\nDate: Mon, November 25, 2013, 00:09:11 ET\n\nPosted by: Enquiring Mind, Confused & disgusted\n\nYoung Wu, I'm still earnestly looking for an explanation - any explanation, from you or anyone else who champions this noisy, obnoxious fraud - as to how a guy like \"Eminem\" belongs in a musical discussion.

A guy - this \"Eminem\" clod - who performs crude, vulgar spoken word bits (not actually \"music\", mind you) - all based on his own shitty, shitty existence, upbringing, & garbage life/style, and nothing more - for the masses who admire his disjointed ravings simply because they don't know any better. Or even worse, because they actually relate to them. That doesn't speak well for the future of popular music. Or for the future of our society.\n\nJust like the papers separate WWE/UFC from actual sports, can't we please separate low grade \"entertainment\" from \"music\" here?\n\nAnyways...I never felt so good about a Grammy win from well over a decade ago.\n\nDate: Sun, November 24, 2013, 23:04:37 ET\n\nPosted by: JustSayin'Son, AirWhere\n\nit's MARSHALL MATHERS...not MICHAEL MATHERS.\n\nif you're gonna hate, at least get your facts straight. <--see what i did there?\n\nDate: Sun, November 24, 2013, 22:37:36 ET\n\nPosted by: Young Wu, Buffalo\n\nYeah, damn... I'm sorry I kept the conversation going. Didn't expect the - as The Dean put it - \"misogynistic bullshit\".\n\nFor the record, I don't think I ever called Eminem a musician. I don't believe he has ever really shown any particular talent to be labeled as musician. But as a rapper... I think he's fairly talented.\n\nI think he's good at taking his inner anger and rage and directed it into quality music. I think he's got an awareness about him that comes through the music which makes it (for a lack of a better description) sound \"real\". I think he has an ability to take long disjointed rants and string them together in a way that makes sense. I think he raps with talent; he can change his voice when he's exposing a different emotion. He can spit out 100+ words in 15 seconds. His lyrics aren't all time great, sure... but they're fairly clever. They're funny. Sometimes they do reach into another level of quality.\n\nI think there's talent there. I like him.

I don't get his kind of stuff at all, but I'll be the first to admit that there's lots I don't get and that fact obviously doesn't negate any particular act's value or validity. But what is it that this guy does, in musical terms, that could cause him to be considered \"talented\" or \"musical\"? I'm not looking for an assessment of his saleability/marketability, or of his entertainment value to those who admire him, since those things are already evident. He obviously has a significant audience, but that doesn't make him a \"musician\" or his product \"music\" any more than having steroid-riddled goons pretend to fight each other makes pro wrestling a \"sport\".\n\nWhat has always drawn me to the music that I love has been the music itself - not the scene, not the window dressing, not the hype, not the hair, and, with the exception of The Beatles, not any perceived \"cultural impact\". It's always been the playing, the notes, the songs themselves. The music.\n\nFrom the Eminem stuff that I have been unwittingly exposed to (admittedly not the entire Eminem catalog), I don't see any of the following being applicable:\n\n- Instrumental virtuosity.\n\n- Instrumental competency.\n\n- Lyrical sophistication.\n\n- Lyrical ability.\n\n- Musical complexity.\n\n- Musical innovation.\n\n- Originality.\n\nI guess I can see how many, especially damaged individuals in a sick society, might relate to the guy's crudely-rendered stories. I just don't get how he qualifies as a musician, and I really don't get how his self-aggrandizing product can technically be considered music.\n\nDate: Sun, November 24, 2013, 17:08:36 ET\n\nPosted by: suedave, Sunny Seattle\n\nHi Ben from Indy - nice meeting you in person this fall!!\n\nDonald Fagen book tour has also been rescheduled in Seattle - December 19th, I believe.\n\nRe: non Steely Dan music recommendations for other people in this crowd.

Now, am I a mega-ulta fan of the dude? No. But are there half a dozen or so songs of his that I think are good - or even great? Yeah. I think the guy is talented, and I think that giving a little explanation as to why I think that directed to a group that probably never listens to him doesn't speak about a lack of talent.

They solo all over the place, which under normal circumstances I'd tire of, but they manage to mix up the action by varying the rhythm section or gradually phasing into a different part of the song to break away from the monotony of hearing the same thing for 8-9 minutes. Some of their horn charts will sound funky, sometimes almost vaudeville in extravagance. Their sound varies from focused with a strong lead melody and nice harmonic changes to downright showy or gimmicky.\n\nOverall I like them. They remind me of the jazz/fusion and library music of the 70's. Hopefully they're not just a one-trick pony. Time will tell.\n\nDate: Sun, November 24, 2013, 09:21:15 ET\n\nPosted by: Hutch,\n\nI've got tickets to see Snarky Puppy here in Richmond on Feb. 1st.\n\nI don't go to all that many concerts anymore.

I'm just saying that good art doesn't require a narrative or explanation. There's even a few old-school rap/hip-hop songs I enjoy, such as Coolio.

So I think there is a some chance he would appreciate this kind of stuff.\n\nThe Band has to be one of the biggest successes in roots crossover music. I also have to think he and Walt can appreciate someone like Emmylou Harris. I mean, how could you not?\n\nYes, that style is fairly hot at the moment. Part of that is due to some big acts like Mumford and Sons (who bring a bit of that sensibility to their stuff). But I also think it is because it is one place where there is a lot of people mixing influences and taking chances---outside of the influence of the hitmakers and an overwhelming subculture. But I would also agree that the bigger it gets, the more commercial it will get, and the more garbage, we will hear.\n\nDate: Sat, November 23, 2013, 22:28:13 ET\n\nPosted by: Napoleon, U.K\n\n@Billy and Dean,\n\nListened to all the links provided and I appreciate the approaches. It's always good to hear some rootsy stuff. I play keys in a folk band myself.\n\nFunnily enough it's a style that's quite en vogue at the moment. In an effort to keep things on a Dan tangent, can you imagine Don and Walt releasing music like this?!\n\nMaybe a compilation covering all their older or unreleased demos featuring all these new fangled artists we've referenced!

And, BTW, most of those on the list are far from \"newer\" IMO.\n\nI know it's easy to throw stones and run away, so like Napoleon, I will offer up an example of a newer artist I think is worthy of some airtime.\n\nBut first I will jump around a little on the old soap box. It's been said the late 60's and early 70's were a special time for music due to (among other things) the confluence of styles and the open playlists of many influential radio stations at that time. That opportunity for bands not focusing on \"hits\", not pretty, not video friendly or interested, became very limited for many years.\n\nIt's been said the Internet and to some extent satellite radio are the new frontiers and provide an opportunity for musicians to find their audience and not simply rely on what programmers and labels decide to force down our collective throats. I think there is some truth to that. But keep in mind, that also means there will be a lot of unlistenable garbage in the mix (no different than what was happening in the 60's and 70's---though the mix may have changed). Perhaps the biggest beneficiary of this new musical paradigm is the music in a rather nebulous genre called \"Americana\" by some. Many of these artist are blending elements from blue grass, blues, rock, jazz, traditional country, folk, soul, gospel, etc.\n\nI'm not suggesting there is a new Steely Dan on the horizon. But there are a number of artists worth your time, I think. At least you know you aren't getting packaged goods like contemporary country, or image-conscious posers like many in what is known as \"Indy\" rock. Many of these newer acts have deep roots, and seem to care more about making music, than their next appearance on some TV show.\n\nSo in an attempt to pay back Napoleon for his intro to White Denim I offer Carolina Chocolate Drops. They blend a lot of shit together and are very talented. Here are three videos highlighting a bit of their musical range:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da08oMVJ09Y\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVIaiADsyYo\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYtR0KgIzd0\n\nHope you dig.\n\nDate: Sat, November 23, 2013, 20:26:49 ET\n\nPosted by: Napoleon, U.K\n\n@Young Wu,\n\nI'm with you on this one. There's plenty of great music out there being produced by people other than the members of Steely Dan (I agree with the choice of Folds, Radiohead and Dave Matthews). However, as this is a SD forum it might be tricky to win some folks over.\n\nThat said, none of them really possess the unique jazz/pop sound of the Dan consistently through out their catalogues.\n\nI think It's important to keep sharing material with all Bluebookers though as too much of one thing isn't good for anyone and the next Steely sounding band might just about to release their stuff as we speak.\n\nSorry for the repetition but in case people missed my post the other week heres a link to, who i feel are the young pretenders. I went to see White Denim live in Manchester last Tuesday and they blew me away. Only four members but a lot of great playing, seamless fusion of styles with 70's rock band sensibilities. Heres a link to the new album on youtube...\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSwPPC-119k\n\nDate: Sat, November 23, 2013, 19:58:34 ET\n\nPosted by: Some, thing ain't right here\n\nThat list of \"great\" newer music is filled with purveyors of unoriginal, sort-of-OK-if-your-standards-aren't-too-high product - at best. At worst, it contains Nine Inch Nails. And the screed features an endorsement of the \"talent\" of Kanye West. Kanye West - the guy who mostly just re-processes the recordings of others and talks over them.\n\nLook, keeping current is wonderful, but not when it means the lowering of standards to a point where they disappear entirely. Really, the only thing notably absent from that post is a cheering section for the new one by Miley Cyrus - something called \"Bangerz\" [sic] - which features major contributions from one Pharell Williams (a guy who apparently has quite the following on The Blue as well). Let's slot Miley in between \"Foo Fighters\" and \"Wilco\", just for the hell of it. Just so we can all keep \"current\".\n\nSo, no, Steely Dan music isn't the only music that's any good. Nobody here has ever said that, though. But as a case advocating for diversity in musical tastes, that list just made a roomful of musicians and music lovers/collectors here collectively throw up our last three meals.\n\nAnd for anyone who's keeping score, Michael pretty much nailed it. Again.\n\nDate: Sat, November 23, 2013, 18:06:43 ET\n\nPosted by: CJB, YVR\n\nWill everyone bitching about lame present-day music PLEASE go check out, even on Youtube, \"Steely\" Dan Bejar (aka DESTROYER)?

So long as the songwriting itself is strong, the music will take care of itself.\n\nCorporatists measure everything's worth according to the size of its commercial following. Mainstream music is little more than a manufactured product, a commodity to saturate the market with for the sake of lining the studio execs' pockets.\n\nOlder musicians live and die off their back catalogs, constantly rehashing the same tired songs, appearing in made-for-TV documentaries (self-advertisements...) waxing nostalgia, discussing how much they've accomplished, forever clinging to their former glories.

To top it off, the youth of other nations are inspired by and actually aspire to this shit. And it is indeed very shitty when viewed through the perspective of a fifty or sixty something, fat, graying, balding, black T shirted urban white boy.\n\nAcross the board things are very closely approaching practical, scientific and economic limits. So many things in art, architecture, science or whatever have been done for so many years by so many people, in so many countries novel ideas seem to have effectively run out. And resources are being competed for by more and more people have limits. This trend is world wide now.\n\nThe 50th anniversary of the JFK assassination was an opportunity to reflect back and realize that not much has really advanced in many major areas in the past 40 to 50 years, compared to the previous 50 years. We had basically the same cars, telecommunication, same types of housing, every home appliance that exists today, color TV credit cards, mass media, air and space travel, no static FM Radio, computers etc. Music synthesizers were around. Even medicine was advanced to probably about 80 percent of what it is today and overall life span is still about the same as it was then. Most of the advances, mostly in computing power have merely improved or have copied what existed 50 years ago.\n\nSo pretty much everything we take for granted today has been around for a half century. Most every genre of music we have today existed in basic form, jazz, rock, metal folk, blues, reggae and today's forms are just fusions of those. There really hasn't been anything that has been a completely new and otherworldly music scene, such as psychedelia or progressive rock since the 1960's.\n\nMajor reasons why we see stagnation across the board in all these areas:\n\nThere are actual barriers in science such as speed of light, time and distance, the fact that you can never convert energy 100% or complex math problems, singularities that are impossible to solve. We are now closely approaching many of these limits.\n\nArt is not for art's sake. It has been subjected to corporate greed and unless you are indie you are snuffed out.\n\nThere is too much \"art\" out there by too many people. And not enough room for originality if it does not make money. And extremely difficult to be original as most everything has been done.\n\nAnd there are too many people, period. Competing for too little resources, consuming more wealth than they generate. There will never be any Jetsons jet packs for all and moving sidewalks in the sky. Well maybe someday for a privileged few, who are high in the economic stratosphere. Such as DF.\n\nThere no longer exists the work ethic, long term sacrifice and vision in today's people who are now the great grandchildren of those who built the nation as hungry, motivated immigrants. What does exist is Entitlement. But no shame, responsibility or accountability.\n\nThose 100 dollar jeans hanging off the asses of the 20 something youth are paid for by welfare checks or drug dealing. Not by entrepreneurship, application of mind, bending of back, or sweat of brow. But most likely by a fat, graying, balding, black T shirted daddy who buys everything for that 20 or 30 something kid of his including a free basement bedroom, smart phone and munchies.\n\nMost movies are remakes or rip offs of the past. Ideas have run out. What else is there? What is revolutionary is that you can now get movies in about 10 different ways.\n\nThere is little that hasn't been already done powerful enough to shock or \"inspire\".\n\nSo what is a 50 something fat, graying, balding, black T shirted urban white boy to do, other than go to Steely Dan concerts, multiple times for the same old tired set lists?\n\nAnd what is a 60 something urban, neurotic, jaded, rich, spoiled rock star living in a bubble to do?\n\nHe writes a fairly shitty, whiny, condescending book that for major parts shits on his fans, for money. And then like a petulant egotist blows off scheduled book signings that many authors do for free.\n\nDate: Wed, November 20, 2013, 08:15:10 ET\n\nPosted by: Billie Rubin, Suss THIS\n\nWhile the rest of your are sitting around wondering why Donald isn't inspiring you, why he's somewhat unhappy with the world today, have you ever wondered who is inspiring HIM these days?\n\nDonald and Walter grew up at a time when there was a lot to be inspired by... great new music that was actually new and interesting made by people with actual depth and intelligence, great scientific achievements that set us on a course for a wide open future full of possibilities, urban cities that were dirty and gritty and full of stark realities just waiting to be written about and experienced, and set against a rural landscape that truly was another world compared to where he they came from.\n\nNow what do they have... what do any of us have? Taylor Swift? Justin Bieber? New Kids On The Block? A dumbed down nation of people who can't find Canada on a map? Jay-Z? P-Diddy? Eminem? Thug life? Gangbangers? Crack cocaine? Where's the \"wide open future\" in any of this? Where's the \"endless possibilities\" we should be expecting? WHERE'S MY FUCKIN' INSPIRATION? About the only thing you can turn to today is science... and even half of that is \"junk science\" bought and paid for by some corporation hoping to use it as a sales pitch.\n\nThere's not a whole fucking lot to be inspired by these days... If you think Donald Fagen is alone in this, YOU'RE WRONG! I can reel off a list of incredible songwriters and artists who can't make a dime today because they're adrift in an ocean of unsophisticates who can't appreciate their art. How you gonna sell cerebral art to a nation of thugs? A nation of neanderthals standing on the street corner spitting on the ground with a hoody pulled over their heads and their pants hanging down below their asses? THIS IS THE PRESENT WE FIND OURSELVES IN! And you blame Donald Fagen for being negative about that? The only question I have is, WHY AREN'T YOU?\n\nAnd D&W's relationship to the world today? Well, it's kind of like this...\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqoSxVf4qTY\n\nBilly\n\nDate: Wed, November 20, 2013, 00:23:05 ET\n\nPosted by: Doc Mu,\n\ntoni: I could be wrong, but the IGY solo sounds very much like a young Chris Potter.\n\nDate: Tues, November 19, 2013, 17:14:30 ET\n\nPosted by: toni, This isn't a damn book club...\n\nSome nice new things on good old youtube\n\ngreat live version if I.G.Y form the 93s tour with a bad ass saxophone solo.

I'm posting as me--as are KD and a few others. I'm not sure who you are in real life--so you will tell us, right? Here? Private email to me?\n\nThank you for your posts and observations. I do appreciate them and have found more than a couple helpful. They were helpful in further appreciating the best parts of the book. Your posts also helped me to learn to appreciate the parts I didn't before. And, yes, you've helped me become more clear as to why I find other passages and aspects of the book to fall short of the quality of satire and writing that I expect of Donald Fagen and Steely Dan's other work. (Humility check: I know, I'm not that great a writer and I badly need an editor.)\n\nTruly, the excerpts I've heard about or even read since September distorted my view of the book to the point I wasn't interested when it came out. (Donald really needs to fix P.R. assuming he cares that the book sells.) In the past couple of weeks, I've been able to listen to it linearly from start to finish and get a sense of context for the various passages. For example, the story about his imagined audience catastrophe gets a lot of press, but is totally different and quite relatable in the context of the book, as you point out.\n\nI also think most anyone who was alive during or is interested in the 1950s and 1960s would be enthralled with the first part of the book, even if they hated the music of Steely Dan and Donald Fagen. His sharings on John Lennon's murder, Ezra's death, and managing depression, anxiety and paranoia are exceptionally poignant, intimate, and moving. (BTW: Normally I find those three descriptives annoyingly cliched, along with \"celebrate,\" \"passion,\" and \"brand.\" )\n\nThat said, yes, the diary is satirical, etc. but, for now I'll just say, I'm indifferent to revisiting it. Maybe after the holidays, I can re-read it. Maybe we can have one of our classic Dandom essay contests where we write a rebuttal or an imagined \"missing epilogue\" or \"excised lines from the editor's desk.\"\n\nI'm fans of other artists and expert subjects for which I am known to be an immense devotee while also being a scathing critic all at once. Steely Dan's quite the exception. I can only think of maybe half-a-dozen things I don't especially care for, that I think need more work to be brought up to Steely standards. Donald's book is one of them. Compare with tens of thousands of other things I do think are great.\n\n--Jim\n\nDate: Thurs, November 14, 2013, 14:40:24 ET\n\nPosted by: Flatbush Chuck, That NYC\n\nFrom the horse's mouth, offered for some context:\n\n\"Don't get me wrong, I love the work, but my sixty-four-year-old body and brain are starting to fail....For a lot of performing artists, every night in front of an audience, no matter how exhilerating, is a bit of a ritual slaying. Without necessarily letting it show, you use every last bit of your marrow, every last atom of your energy in an attempts to satisfy the hungry crowd. On some levelyou're trying to extinguish yourself. Because, corny and Red Shoes-y as it may seem, that's what you are, and they need it.\" [109]\n\n\"Joy trumps ATD, for a change. Good crowd, good enough sound, nice vibe all around....the earth falls away and it's just you and the crew creating this forward motion, this undeniable, magical stuff that can move ten thousand people to snap free of life's miseries and get up and dance and scream and feel just fine.\n\nWait, I'm in too good a mood. Somebody, stop me, please.\" [145]\n\n\"...the band, inspired by the wildly responsive, obviously snockered Friday night crowd, laid down the grooves behind the singers and soloists, who were all on fire. For a couple of hours, five thousand people forgot their problems, their grief, the fear of their inevitable appointment with oblivion and were lifted up and out of it by seeing and hearing a hot band play some good music. So there.\" [132]\n\n\"No, I'm not a psycho; [the flash-fire fantasy] was just a momentary surge of wrath....The crowd, they know not what they do. But when I'm fighting exhaustion, putting everything into the performance and still feeling like I'm getting an indifferent response from the house, it's easy to morph into the Hulk. I guess I'm getting more and more thin-skinned as the tour goes on....I mentioned to Vince that I regretted my behavior onstage, bothering the girls with my theater fire scenario.\" [123]\n\nDate: Thurs, November 14, 2013, 11:37:25 ET\n\nPosted by: ,\n\n>Bloody hell. He didn't like the reactions and audience at an old-timey revue show that he probably regretted a week into signing up for.\n\nThey toured more than one year as the Dukes. If you don't think DF is interested in old-timey revue shows, you don't know DF. That's how the Dan got back together in the 90s.\n\nAlso, I think the people who are turned off by the book and the people who are screaming \"satire\" at them are talking past each other. Here's DF's own words:\n\n\"My natural motive is irony. I was a little afraid Mike and Boz would be mad, but I sent it to them. Mike thought it was funny and Boz had reservations. It is exaggerated somewhat Ã¯Â¿Â½ audiences in Canada aren't actually mummified. It's just me being honest, and me feeling old, and I have to say, if you want to know the truth, I just don't care.\"\n\nFor those who keep bringing up the satire thing - I guess I don't understand what you're trying to say. To me it the diary sounds like a grumpy old man complaining that he woke up on top of his Macbook power brick. Something being funny and something being satire are two different things. I don't see satire here. He lives in a bubble -- the Dan would fly out of hubs to play concerts because most cities don't have nice enough hotels for chrissakes -- and this journal is the perspective of a guy who is forced to not stay in the Ritz for a few weeks. If it were a satire of this perspective it would actually be more interesting than it ultimately is in the book.\n\nDate: Thurs, November 14, 2013, 10:47:05 ET\n\nPosted by: Some, further analysis\n\nIt's been said - not by me, mind you - that Steely Dan fans are, on balance, a cut above the usual drooling idiot rock music crowd. Maybe even a few cuts above. The thought implies that they are (or feel they are, or seem to be) more perceptive, more insightful, whatever, and thus more predisposed to critical thinking and more inclined to \"get\" things that might be beyond the grasp of the average lunch-bucket-toting Journey fan. Like our musical heroes Don & Walt, we dig jazz, satire, and other smarty-pants stuff. Like I said, that's not my opinion, that's just what seems to be the general consensus, formed by outsiders and SD fans alike.\n\nSo how is it that so many here have embarrassed themselves, even if under the veil of anonymity, by commenting vehemently & negatively on a satirical piece they clearly either haven't actually read for themselves, or even worse have read but didn't understand?\n\nLet's face it, the audiences at those 2012 Dukes shows were, as a collective unit, a pretty drab affair compared to the usual SD crowd. Even more cell phone use during the performances. Even more loud talking during unrecognized songs. Even more Big Gulp Beers and the Potty Break Parades they cause.\n\nIn other words, even more fat, gray, bald, dumb, selfish, semi-cadaverous inattentive folks than usual. Can we at least all agree on that?\n\nSo, apparently Mr. Fagen saw what the rest of us saw, and decided to describe it with some clever-if-sadistic wordplay. \"Satire\", we call it. He was writing, in an admittedly exaggerated fashion, about the audiences at those 2012 Dukes shows - the ones described in the previous paragraph. The ones who showed up mainly to hear re-heated Doobie Brothers hits and other comfortable, nostalgic radio fodder from the '70s. He was NOT characterizing the people who attended Rarities Night, Soboba, The Gorge, and/or Chumash. He was NOT talking about the mostly-into-it Steely Dan crowds. He was talking about the mostly-out-of-it Dukes crowds.\n\nHe was right on.\n\nThe book is fucking hilarious.\n\nBloody hell, indeed.\n\nDate: Thurs, November 14, 2013, 06:04:54 ET\n\nPosted by: tripstar,\n\nProbably posted before, but worth watching despite certain notorious absences, this BBC documentary on early British prog is both fun and informative.

He didn't like the reactions and audience at an old-timey revue show that he probably regretted a week into signing up for -- as many do soon after taking on a job they were on the fence about.

Should DF have left well enough alone, remained shrouded in mystery and would have eventually died as a legendary figure?\n\nDiscuss.\n\nDate: Wed, November 13, 2013, 15:05:12 ET\n\nPosted by: If only, I could be on the inside\n\nFirst I can't get DF because I'm not a working musician.

You might also grant that curmudgeons have their uses, in life and in literature, at least if they're not too narcissistic or altogether graceless. Personally, I don't find Fagen to be either of those; and I'd add that he shows plenty of the merciless self-awareness which tends to be a redeeming trait of the curmudgeon.\n\nBut maybe I bought into (and some others here don't) the impression that Fagen presents himself confessionally in EH as a character-- an introvert with hyperactive amygdala of his own who, by the luck of discovering a multi-sourced \"hipster\" ethos, found a way to craft for himself a vocal persona (and songwriting co-persona). One, I'd add, that in the end intrigued millions of listeners with temperaments both similar to and very different from his own. The capper of the story: When this reluctant singer, riddled with insecurity, finally opened his mouth to sing, what he projected was (to paraphrase an old UK commentator on Steely Dan) a voice \"from a place of such rarified bohemian priority that it was hard to determine exactly where it was situated.\" In the Connee Boswell chapter in particular he says some things about her singing-- emotionally connected to yet ironically distanced from the words, etc.-- that pretty much nail his own.\n\nThe Dukes diary comes across for me as an extended postcard about how the emotionally battered old combination of adaptive hipster and bright, easily disenchanted kid-nerd that is DF is treading water in late middle-age. While, let's not forget, still putting out good records and shows (OK, I didn't see any Dukes shows, but he sang me my money's worth with SD this past 10/3).\n\nOK, he lays the whining on a bit thick in places. The \"TV babies\" thing is overused and insufficiently unpacked. And while I thought he did enough to signal that his more hyperbolic rants were intended to be taken as just that, perhaps he could have walked some of them back more explicitly-- and added (as he did at Barnes & Noble) a disclaimer about liking many audiences just fine, even in guns'n'Jesus country.\n\nBut on balance EH strikes me as a decent overview-- from the privileged (though never infallible) first-person perspecive-- of what went into Fagen's persona, and the complicated way it relates to the human being behind it.\n\nDate: Wed, November 13, 2013, 11:36:52 ET\n\nPosted by: Longtime Fan, Not the truth, just how I honestly feel.\n\nRe: the book. The first part was good. Definitive unless Walter writes his own version . But then Donald's laugh turns into a furious whine for the opening of the diary. The second half isn't good writing at all. Absolute narcissistic crap. If we're all TV babies, then Donald is simply a dick. I know those cover songs, Donald, and let me tell you, your cover versions suck. Not only do I know people who could do better covers, those people could cover them with more joy and without all your indulgent contempt.\n\nDoes Donald have a single kind word to say about his fans who support him? I could find nary. I don't it expect it to be a swoon fest about fans, but, you know, there might be a single sentence or interlude like, \"All kvetching aside, the fans actually have been good to me supporting me in my financial success.\"\n\nPeople do get too nuts about things at face value. Look at Randy Newman's I Love L.A. and Short People. The first is scathing but people think it's favorable. The second is a great satire of prejudice, but there is that bridge that shallow people ignore. But how can you have a jokey book that insults over and over again.. I don't think it will make it to cut-outs. I think Penguin figures it will be a stiff and printed few copies.\n\nGiven that the Dukes shows are such agony, why does he even go on tour except for the money? Pathetic.\n\nAs long as we're being honest, we could start with the fact Donald's voice was horrible when I saw him at the end of the Dukes tour. At least he could apologize for that.\n\nI do compare with when Walter accepted the Grammy for 2vN when he declared it a victory for the fans. He showed cool and snarky doesn't have to be a bore. While he may also think some of the same things Donald thinks, he also seems to get the positive side as well. God bless Walter, I don't how he puts up with Donald.\n\nDate: Wed, November 13, 2013, 09:50:32 ET\n\nPosted by: Napoleon, UK\n\nJust had the opportunity to listen to the Tom and Don tapes and I think anyone who's been trying to second guess Donald Fagen's mood/character purely from his book should listen to these skits.

And they always include a few deep cuts. I think many here are upset that they play the same few deep cuts on every tour.\n\nAs for \"Slip Kid\" I'm fine missing that (instant bathroom break for me). But to be fair, I wouldn't likely be at a WHO concert.\n\nDate: Tues, November 12, 2013, 17:08:59 ET\n\nPosted by: Flatbush Chuck, That NYC\n\nRead Eminent Hipsters twice now. TO Q-&-A my response:\n\nQ: Would you have found this book interesting if it hadn't been written by a longtime hero of yours?\n\nA: Much of it, yes; in particular much of the first half. Whoever the author is, he's affording me a thoughtfully opinionated perspective on how several broad cultural strands of the American scene that I first remember had come together. Since he's just over a decade older than me-- a more senior boomer, no more or less-- many of the cultural elements depicted here are joltingly familiar to me but presented from a more comprehensively-viewed angle; he's affording some absorbing contextualization. (Not to say a definitive one, of course; nor would he claim that.) And in any event, he's a very nuanced commentator on anything that really piques his interest.\n\nQ: What do you think of the writing?\n\nA: Intelligent, lucid, usually funny when he tries to be, and poignant on those widely scattered occasions he deigns to be. He's a good but not great storyteller; he's more a cultural critic. Not a brilliant prose stylist, but an altogether commendable one. And find me another \"rock star\" who combines intellect and raconteuring so well.\n\nQ: What do you think of the Dukes tour diary?\n\nA: What the devil's so scandalous here? It's clear that he's giving himself full rein for in-the-moment hyperbole, and that he's at every point doing a healthy amount of seeing himself as iithers see him. The entry with the flash fire fantasy is repeatedly disclaimed as \"my psycho rant,\" an entry in which he signals from the git-go that he's gonna vent some spleen to (over)state a point about how audiences can be daunting/disappointing/unfair/insulting. (It's no accident that his \"reducing\" political conservativism to oversized amygdalas is also in this entry, just a bit earlier; when a guy with Fagen's sense of irony and complexity (e.g., holding aloft the Korzybski quote \"the map is not the territory\") ends an argument with \"Period. End of story,\" is he really asking you to believe that he believes he's settled the matter? Personally, I'd be interested to hear Fagen's take on Johanthan Haidt, Daniel Kahneman, et al.)\n\nQ: Biggest disappointment?\n\nA: I liked the chapter on Bard, but I guess Fagen had scooped himself with that Entertainment Weekly piece a few years ago which shadowed his revelatory return to the school. There's more of both content and texture in that EW piece, including the Rikki Ducornet thing.\n\nQ: Biggest reward?\n\nA: Plenty of clues as to where elements of Fagen's musical and lyric sensibility came from (influences on phrasing, verbal flow, etc.).\n\nDate: Tues, November 12, 2013, 16:30:19 ET\n\nPosted by: Mitch, Chicago\n\nHere's part of an article that appeared in a recent issue of Rolling Stone regarding the The Who's upcoming last 50th anniversary \"retirement\" tour: Fans hoping to hear The Who break out rarities like The Who By Numbers deep cut \"Slip Kid\" are going to be disappointed. It's easy for fans to stick their heads in the sand and not understand the economics of touring\" Roger Daltrey says. \"It's incredibly expensive to put on a show, so you have to put bums in seats. There might be 40, 000 total people in America who want to hear \"Slip Kid\". That won't be enough to put us on the road That's the problem\"\n\nThis is the same situation that plagued the recent Steely Dan tour for long time die-hard fans who wanted rarely played cuts. I hate this kind of mentality, but at least Daltrey was up front and honest about it. No reason to go see a band that should have hung it up after John Entwistle died. I'm going to puke if I hear Pinball Wizard yet again.\n\nDate: Tues, November 12, 2013, 10:43:43 ET\n\nPosted by: Hutch,\n\nA \"Mood Swings\" show of another kind......\n\nhttp://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bob-dylan-readies-iron-sculptures-for-exhibit-20130924\n\nDate: Mon, November 11, 2013, 18:05:36 ET\n\nPosted by: Three Weeks Out of Rehab, What a Shame About Me\n\nDo you mean stacking cutouts at the Strand, or everywhere?\n\nDate: Mon, November 11, 2013, 12:24:19 ET\n\nPosted by: Fresha Del Puerto, Babylon\n\nSo how long before this book makes it to the cutout bin?\n\nDate: Mon, November 11, 2013, 10:57:24 ET\n\nPosted by: Steve,\n\nI've completed Donald's book from start to finish.\n\nThere are parts I like and those I don't.
