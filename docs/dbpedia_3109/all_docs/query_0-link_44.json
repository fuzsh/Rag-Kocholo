        "text": "==Phrack Inc.== Volume Four, Issue Thirty-Eight, File 1 of 15 Issue XXXVIII Index ___________________ P H R A C K 3 8 April 26, 1992 ___________________ \"Countdown to SummerCon '92\" \"Get ready for the biggest and best computer hacker PARTY conference of the year!\" Phrack Inc. is proud to be the official sponsor of the 6th Annual SummerCon, but this year is something different. The date and location for this year's Summer Conference are for those with a need to know. SummerCon is a private party, its for our friends, and its our business and nobody elses'. Events from our past have made it necessary to keep the important specifics under wraps, so our theme this year is privacy. Would be informants, ignorant and biased security professionals, and little malicious rodent hackers can forget about receiving an invitation. We are making a list and checking it twice. If you would like to receive an invitation and details about SummerCon then send mail to \"summer@stormking.com\". Meanwhile, back at Phrack... It appears that Phrack is getting VERY popular. At last count we had well over 775 people directly subscribed to the Phrack Mailing List. However, some people aren't overjoyed at Phrack's popularity. In recent postings to EFF newsgroups, complaints have been lodged that people downloading Phrack from \"ftp.eff.org\" account for more than 1/3 of all ftp traffic on that site. Some people at EFF have even suggested that Phrack be removed completely from their system. When the high and mighty defenders of Knight Lightning's First Amendment rights begin to balk, what does that say to the community at large about EFF and their agenda? In this issue of Phrack we feature \"Cellular Telephony\" by Brian Oblivion! Brian tells us to expect more files on this topic from him in the near future, but for now we can start with this very substantial taste. Additionally, this issue will wrap up Black Kat's 3-part series on VAX/VMS and Dispater's 2-part defense manual for police radar. Rambone is back with his second file on the Pirate community and Datastream Cowboy picks up where Taran King left off in Phrack 30 with Network Miscellany. And if that wasn't enough, Mycroft brings us a file on Wide Area Information Services (WAIS). Subtitled \"How Do I Use It and Why Should I Care?\" It tells you about the service in general and gives directions for using WAIS to review Phrack. Another spotlight file in this issue is \"Standing Up To Fight The Bells.\" Knight Lightning brings forth a message and a warning about what is happening right now in the Congress and Senate of the United States, where the Bell Operating Companies are seeking to hold on to yet another monopoly to control. Be prepared to act and act fast or live forever with the consequences -- the future of information services controlled by Ma Bell. And finally the full details of Computers, Freedom, & Privacy II appear both in a special file by Max Nomad and in two smaller articles in Phrack World News (part 3). We're back and we're Phrack. Enjoy reading it because we enjoy writing it!

This is also the place Phrack Staff will make suggestions to you by reviewing various items of note; magazines, software, catalogs, hardware, etc. _______________________________________________________________________________ Terminus Is Free ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Len Rose has been released from prison as of March 23, 1992.

Babbs' Boy was a friend of mine a while back and was more of a Game Programmer than a \"hacker\" (or \"cracker,\" if you want to be anal about it). Babbs' Boy was NEVER in MsU. He had asked me if he could write a file for the group. We informed him that he could if he wanted to, but he could in no way represent us. According to Babbs' Boy, he retrieved the information from a copy of the ECPA. Since we were not releasing that as a MsU file, we never bothered to check any of the said information out. In fact, MsU does not create files for public display, although individual members may. Apparently Babbs' Boy uploaded his copy of the document to Ripco, in which it went wideband from there. I am told that 3 other documents were released in MSU's name, by someone using one of my very old handles of Raistlin. I can assure you that these documents were not released by any legitimate (old or current) member of Midnight Society Underground. Again, to clear things up, Babbs' is not nor ever was a member of MsU, nor are there any legitimate public releases from our group. Besides, we don't let people in the group who spell Feds \"FEDZ\" ..the shit just ain't done.

Marotta\" <MERCURY@lcc.edu> Subject: Censorship in Cyberspace To: Phrack Staff I have been hired to write an article about the control of information in cyberspace. We all know that Fidonet moderators and sysops devote their OWN resources for us to use. There is no question about the \"right\" of the sysop or moderator to delete messages and users. The practice of censorship is nonetheless newsworthy. If YOU have experienced censorship on Fidonet or Usenet, Prodigy or CompuServe, or another BBS or network, I am interested in learning about your story. If you can supply downloads of actual encounters, so much the better. If you have ever been censored, send me physical world mail about the event. Michael E. Marotta 5751 Richwood #34 Lansing, Mich. 48911 _______________________________________________________________________________ Dear Phrack Staff, There are very serious negative consequences surrounding the use of modems and computers in our society. Because of this, all children under the age of 18 should be prohibited from using a computer in connection with a modem or that is connected to any computer service. Please read my attached news release and join me in spreading this message. -- Ron Hults - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - NEWS RELEASE March 18, 1992 PEDOPHILIA, COMPUTERS, AND CHILDREN If you have children in your home and a home computer complete with a telephone modem, your child is in potential danger of coming in contact with deviant and dangerous criminals. Using the computer modem, these unsavory individuals can communicate directly with your child without your knowledge. Just as importantly, you should be concerned if your child has a friendship with other youth who has access to this equipment in an unsupervised environment. Using a computer and a modem, your child can readily access community \"bulletin boards\" and receive sexually explicit and graphic material from total strangers who can converse with your children, individuals you quite probably wouldn't even talk with. The concern becomes more poignant when stated otherwise; would you let a child molester, murderer, or convicted criminal into your home to meet alone with your child? According to Fresno Police Detective Frank Clark, \"your child can be in real danger from pedophiles, rapists, satanic cultists and other criminals known to be actively engaged in computer conversation. Unwittingly, naive children with a natural curiosity can be victimized; emerging healthy sexual feelings of a child can be subverted into a twisted, unnatural fetish affecting youth during a vulnerable time in their lives.\" It is anticipated that parents, when armed with the knowledge that this activity exists and awareness that encounters with such deviant individuals can result in emotional and psychological damage to their child, will take appropriate measures to eliminate the possibility of strangers interacting with their children via a computer.

Although the fact is that he will only be slightly inconvenienced by having to dig up issues of Phrack on his own instead of having them delivered to his mailbox, his being refused to be added to the mailing list means a lot more. If I were him, I would consider it a slap in the face (since it seems almost as bad, IMO, as being blacklisted). :) May he run into 10 homosexual wrestlers in a dark alley. _______________________________________________________________________________ Review of Intertek Winter 1992 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 325 Ellwood Beach, #3 Subscription Rates: Goleta, CA 93117 US : 4 issues (2 year) $14.00. Internet: steve@cs.ucsb.edu OS : 4 issues (2 year) $18.20. Phone: 805-685-6557 Back issues : $5.00 ea. by Dispater Intertek is the *SHARPEST* looking 'zine I've seen yet that directly addresses the world of cyberspace. It's not \"high res\" color or artsy-fartsy like Mondo 2000, but it is at least more interesting to read as a whole. I think it looks better and is more direct and to the point. You don't have to wade through a bunch of trash to get to something interresting. This issue of Intertek focused on \"virtual communities.\" The topics included: \"Bury USENET,\" \"Electropolis (IRC),\" \"Social Organization of the Computer Underground\" by Gordon Meyer, \"Real World Kerberos,\" and \"Mudding: Social Phenomena in Text-Based Virtual Realities.\" Every issue also contains the top news tidbits about some truly high-tech achievements that go unnoticed by the mainstream media (I guess the Mike Tyson trial gets more ratings, huh?). All in all, it was much more interesting to me than the last issue (Volume 3.2). It's magazines like this that I hope will help make the mainstream media obsolete. If you are looking for \"how-to\" techie projects or hacking tips, this is NOT for you! Many hackers I know don't like it and think it's boring as hell; 2600 and Phrack it isn't. However, if you are interested in the \"big picture\" of the cyberspace (what ever that means! :) or are, say, interested in studying cyberspace from an uninvolved level, this is the magazine for you. Intertek is full of social insight into what makes the cyberspace tick. It does this much better than the feeble attempts other magazines have made. For only $7.00 a year, I think it's worth it. _______________________________________________________________________________ Hacking in Australia ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ By The Cure Australia has been very sparse after my BBS (Micromation) was closed down. A lot of people took it as a warning, and closed up shop as well. The Amiga warez BBSes still continue to flourish, as do some IBM ones. Because of the expense of phone lines ($300 installation of a line, $250 per year rental [in American dollars]) we tend to have a lot of BBSes that are dual purpose, i.e. both warez and phreak. Devastation Phase One is a great example: huge Amiga/ IBM/phreak/etc. I, however, was devoted to phreak/hack/etc. We did have a few busts actually, and the police were called in to trace all calls through Vicnet and some people I know were caught. We've got a few warez-monger type people here that have been busted for \"pitting\" (climbing into telecom phone pits, and hooking up straight to the lines) - and I had my knuckles rapped by my university. Phoenix's court case still hasn't been settled (he's had 35 of the 47 charges against him dropped). Comserve has finally made it down under, and they're footing the bill for the first year, allowing us to be on Comserve in the States for a while. Our telephone company (Telecom) is a government monopoly, and we've only just passed legislation to allow competition. The first carrier allowed will be a company called Optus. Call waiting, conferencing, etc. is almost standard here now. _______________________________________________________________________________ Censorship in Iowa ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ From: Mike Begley <spam@iastate.edu> Hi. I got your name from Erik Bloodaxe. He said you might be able to help us out with a minor problem we're having here. The computation center at Iowa State University will very soon institute a policy of censorship of a number of groups of questionable nature, specifically the alt.sex hierarchy, alt.drugs, and a few other similar groups. I wish to conduct a survey of the users of our computer system, but the university specificly prohibits mass mailings. I'm frightened by censorship, and I want to fight this as best I can. If you would be able to do this favor for us, you would be helping to fight electronic censorship and suppression of free expression. _______________________________________________________________________________ Phrack FTP Sites ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ quartz.rutgers.edu (128.6.60.6) mc.lcs.mit.edu (18.26.0.179) Location: /pub/computer/law Location: /its/ai/digex mintaka.lcs.mit.edu (18.26.0.36) coombs.anu.edu.au (130.56.96.2) Location: /telecom-archives Location: /inbound wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4) ftp.eff.org (192.88.144.4) Location: /doc/policy/pub/cud/Phrack Location: /pub/cud/Phrack nic.funet.fi (128.214.6.100) cs.dal.ca (129.173.4.5) Location: /pub/doc/phrack Location: /pub/comp.archives chsun1.spc.uchicago.edu (128.135.46.7) ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9) Location: /pub/cud/phrack Location: /tmp rascal.ics.utexas.edu (128.83.138.20) relay.cs.toronto.edu (128.100.3.6) Location: /misc/ra/sa/ULM.DE Location: /doc/telecom-archives aix370.rrz.uni-koeln.de (134.95.132.2) Location: /pub/usenet/comp.archives/hackers/journals titania.mathematik.uni-ulm.de (134.60.66.21) Location: /info src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7) Location: /usenet/comp.archives/hackers/journals bric-a-brac.apple.com (130.43.2.3) Location: /pub/stud_reps faui43.informatik.uni-erlangen.de (131.188.31.3) Location: /portal/mounts/cyber/pcd/freeware2/magazine srawgw.sra.co.jp (133.137.4.3) Location: /.a/sranha-bp/arch/arch/comp.archives/hackers/sites _______________________________________________________________________________ What's Your NPA These Days? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><> <> <> <> AREA CODE SPLITS OF 1991 <> <> Researched and Collected <> <> by <Flash!Point> <> <> <> <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><> BALTIMORE, MARYLAND C&P Telephone Company Report for 301 NPA Split NXXs Converting to NPA 410 205 208 213 221 222 224 225 226 228 232 233 234 235 237 239 242 243 244 247 250 252 254 255 256 257 260 263 265 266 267 268 269 272 273 275 276 278 280 281 282 284 285 287 288 289 290 291 296 298 307 312 313 316 319 321 323 325 326 327 328 329 332 333 335 337 338 339 342 343 346 347 348 351 352 354 355 356 357 358 360 361 362 363 364 366 367 368 370 374 376 377 378 379 381 382 383 385 388 389 391 392 393 396 397 398 404 425 426 429 433 435 437 438 440 442 444 446 448 450 452 455 456 457 458 461 462 465 466 467 471 472 476 477 479 481 482 483 484 485 486 488 489 494 514 515 516 521 522 523 524 525 526 527 528 529 531 532 533 534 535 536 537 538 539 541 542 543 544 546 547 548 549 550 551 553 554 555 556 557 558 560 561 562 563 566 569 573 574 575 576 578 581 583 584 586 591 592 594 597 602 605 612 613 614 623 624 625 626 628 631 632 633 634 635 636 637 638 639 641 642 643 644 646 647 648 651 653 655 658 659 661 664 665 666 667 668 669 671 672 673 674 675 676 677 679 682 683 684 685 686 687 691 692 693 712 715 719 720 721 723 726 727 728 730 732 734 740 741 742 744 745 747 748 749 750 751 752 754 755 756 757 758 760 761 764 765 766 768 771 775 778 780 781 783 784 785 787 788 789 792 793 795 796 798 799 806 813 819 820 821 823 825 827 828 830 832 833 835 836 837 838 841 844 848 849 850 857 859 860 861 866 867 873 875 876 877 879 880 882 883 885 886 887 889 892 893 896 906 915 920 922 923 928 931 936 938 939 941 943 944 945 947 950 954 955 956 957 960 962 964 965 966 968 969 971 974 976 978 979 987 988 991 992 993 995 996 997 998 999 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA Pacific Bell Customer Report For 415 NPA Split NXXs Converting to NPA 510 204 208 210 215 222 223 226 228 229 231 233 234 235 236 237 238 245 248 251 253 254 256 261 262 263 264 265 268 269 271 272 273 275 276 277 278 279 283 284 287 293 294 295 297 298 302 307 309 310 313 317 339 351 352 356 357 370 372 373 374 376 385 410 412 414 416 417 419 420 422 423 425 426 427 428 429 430 432 436 437 438 439 440 443 444 446 447 448 449 451 452 455 458 460 462 463 464 465 466 471 475 481 482 483 484 486 487 489 490 498 504 509 _______________________________________________________________________________ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ==Phrack Inc.== Volume Four, Issue Thirty-Eight, File 3 of 15 ==Phrack Pro-Phile== Written by Dispater Created by Taran King (1986) Welcome to Phrack Pro-Phile.

I guess you could say I started phreaking a few years before WARGAMES came out. After the movie, I found out that other people were interested in phones too. Due to the influx of \"elite hackers\" after the movie, information became extrememly available. This lead to my existence in the real world of hack/phreak. Eventually I ended up writing articles for both 2600 and TAP. In the late 80s I restarted TAP with help from some friends and we started to revive one of the first hack/phreak magzines that ever existed. Having TAP helped us gain a special insight on how the system really works. Some of our issues were cool enough to actually be censored at certain institutions where avid censorship still exists. Also, we were allowed to see how far you could go in expressing your opinion until some bigshot noticed. Believe it or not though, running a periodical without any income is a major pain. It was well worth it though as I got to meet a lot of cool people and also was able to do something for the computer underground scene. If you currently don't support magazines like 2600, etc., please do. They are doing a lot of work for the community and without them, there would be a major gap in the press regarding the truth about our community. I exited the hack/phreak world when things got a bit hairy and Craig (Knight Lightning) got nailed. I simply decided that a hobby is not worth going to jail for and that it did not pay the bills either. Anyways, most old hacks eventually reach the point where everything they see seems old and boring. This is where I currently am. Today I am employed at a computer lab at a large university where I am working on a degree. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aristotle's Favorite Things ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Women: Karen (To be married soon) Cars: REAL Cars: '86 Mustang GT, '86 VW Golf, various Porsches.

Of the general population, I would consider about 89.9% to be nerds. I would also consider 65% of the entire population nerds and/or strange. Phreaks may be geeks but each usually has his/her cool qualities as everyone does. Most are socially lacking though. Keep in mind that a hacker/phreak is ALWAYS better than the average GIF viewing geek. _______________________________________________________________________________ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ==Phrack Inc.== Volume Four, Issue Thirty-Eight, File 4 of 15 Pirates' Cove Issue Two By Rambone Welcome to Issue Two of Pirate's Cove. There is a lot going on in the Pirate community, busts of pirates in the USA and Canada, and new software and operating systems like IBM's OS/2. So sit back and absorb the news. First on the agenda is to discuss the over-talked about, and hopefully dead issue of the carding scam initiated by The Grim Reaper and The Not So Humble Babe. The reason Phrack Magazine delayed publishing anything about this bust was because we refused to publish any third party rumors and idle gossip. Now that I have personally spoken with the Grim Reaper, we can shed some light on this subject. Mike \"The Grim Reaper\" obviously regrets what has transpired and would like to put this part of his life behind him. At this point in time, he still does not know what is going to happen, and is taking his arrest very seriously. Mike asked me just to use the letter he has written. Some of you may have seen this before, some may not. ******************************************************************************* Statement by The Grim Reaper ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \"Lamer Pirate Magazines, Etc...\" By THE GRIM REAPER This was originally going to be an article for iNSANITY Magazine #4 called \"Lamer Pirate Mags, Etc.\" to straighten out the complete bullshit and lies in Badnews #7, but seeing as there are so many rumors floating around, and the future of iNSANITY is undecided, I decided to just put out this text file to explain what is really going on, less a few lamers out there spread all kinds of bullshit and lies, as they seem to do so often. Pretty much everything in Badnews #7 was a complete lie, as most of you already know by now. They didn't have any backdoors to ViSiON-X, and there aren't and weren't any that allowed someone to get the user list. What happened on Showdown was the Sysop PW was given out to the wrong person, and they used it, so again, nothing but B.S. and hype on their end. While I think the FiRM overhyped themselves, they didn't deserve the ragging they got by BaD, and BaD having failed in their own attempt at a pirate group has no right to criticize ANYONE until they've accomplished the same. Perhaps a few of the other groups could have said something to them (and many talked about it) but they didn't deserve the 3rd Degree from a lamer mag. The main reason for this article was that while many found the BaD Mag to be so completely full of shit to the point that it was hilarious, some got to thinking that down the line, someone might actually believe some of the B.S. They claimed to be the group that caused the downfall of THG, PE and others, which was a complete joke... They had absolutely nothing to do with any of that. USA had killed off THG, etc... What else was there to straighten up? \"Did they shoot your Dog????\" - Anonymous Lamer So what's up? Well, to make it short and blunt, The NotSoHumble Babe and I were involved in a carding incident. She most likely was being watched by certain people since she had been using false corporations and fake Tax ID Numbers to order games and for suppliers for USA. The Secret Service either stumbled across us that way, from one of the orders gone bad, or from the illegal cash and hardware coming in to Enterprize. The NSH Babe (Amy) had a cash flow from Dist Sites and other hot hardware from USA Sites totalling about $3500-$5000 a month. She had sent one of her hot laptops she gets every month to Optical Illusion in Canada, and asked him to sell it for her. He wanted to be nice and tried to sell it. A local from his 416 area wanted to buy the laptop. He went to sell it, and was busted by a plainclothes police officer for possession of stolen property of over a $1000. I found some CC #'s, she had a lot of experience with UPS and FedEx from ordering games, and she thought of a way to pick up the packages. We both placed orders (I placed about 2/3rds since she was picking up, and she placed about a 1/3rd). Most of the stuff wasn't for myself, and was meant for other people (trying to be nice, eh?). In any case, we shouldn't have done it. TNSH Babe wanted to order a A LOT of stuff because, over time, she owed people in USA a lot of hardware they had paid her for, and she had never sent any to them. We ordered a bit too much, more than I thought we should have. \"They had Bulletproof Vests and Grenades??\" - Another |<-Rad D00D!! So then what? Well, they found out the packages were coming and were waiting for TNSH Babe to pick them up. They went back to her place and she gave them permission to come in and search (dunno what happened in between then). She talked to them and they wanted to have her give some of the stuff to me that she got when we were supposed to meet for the first time at a Meijers parking lot. There were some weird things going on at the time, and an alarm was flashing in the back of my mind, but I decided to ignore it. Anyhow, she handed me a hard drive or something, then, basically, they moved in. I saw a car pulling up, and figured what was going on. One guy said, \"Secret Service\" (about 6 people), and it kinda went downhill from there. But seriously, they weren't that bad and I cooperated with them. They wanted to go back to my house and look around, and wanted permission. They said they would have gotten a search warrant, and it was in my best interest to cooperate, so I let them come in. Basically there wasn't anything in the house, I always throw everything out when I am done with it. As far as the computer went, I didn't even have anything Unzipped on the Hard Drive that I hadn't paid for. They wanted to look further on the computer and in the end did take it, but gave me a receipt. I paid for my entire system, so don't listen to some of the lamer textfiles floating around. There wasn't anything on my system, so I might get lucky and they'll give it back. They also took 3 or 4 computers from Amy's place, but left Static with his. This was the first time either of us had done anything like this. There had been a few attempts in the past, but nothing that had ever been followed through, or had worked. No no, I've never been busted for this before, or anything. I've never been arrested for anything before. \"I formatted my Hard Drive 3 Times!!\" - Local 313 Sysop I don't know if it was overreacting, but our dumb situation seemed to affect a lot of other people. The locals over here went apeshit, and many of them formatted their drives and deleted files (20+), and took their boards down temporarily. Many of the major pirate boards decided to power down for a while. Unfortunately many of the truly good boards in the world have gone down, possibly forever. BBS-A-Holic has gone down, Enterprize is now PD Only, many INC boards, LSD2 possibly for related reasons, The VOID of course, and many others. Many big names are considering quitting the pirate scene because they think it's not worth it, and they're right. Some of the boards may come back. BBS-A-Holic was one of my favorites. Many considered The VOID one of the Top 10 Boards in the world as far as quality went, and I appreciate the users and the support. I worked hard to try to make it the best, and put my heart into it. As are many others, Black Spyrit might be retiring, so I don't know if another iNSANITY Issue will be coming out. It was truly a great mag if you never saw it. The best. \"I heard they were thrown in jail, and fined $72 Million Dollars!!\" - Another Neverending Lamer No matter what or who the issue, this never stops, eh? I wouldn't believe any of the bullshit text files, mostly from jealous people and the few enemies you get when you end up getting towards the top, especially the anonymous (surprise) text file taken off of OOFNet (surprise again, huh? Heh). All are, as always, complete B.S. Try not to be a lamer. There are too many of 'em, and they do nothing for the pirate world. If you are going to do anything, do SOMETHING. Organize a group of some type, coordinate couriers, do some VGA or ANSI work, or get in a group, but don't be a lamer. Call LD, establish a rep, and see what you are missing. All locals aren't lamers, but 90% are. A Lamer - A person who calls only local boards, does nothing but leeches files, and doesn't contribute to groups in any ways. Neither BaD, any locals, or Socrates had anything to do with us getting into trouble in any way. \"Don't try this at home kids.\" - Grim '92 All things considered, I wish it wouldn't have ended this way. I don't think any of this was good for anyone in the pirate or BBS world. USA is now pretty much a dead group. Many of the best boards have gone down, and others are considering calling it quits because it just isn't worth it. INC never was a for-profit group, and had no illegitimate cash flow, unlike USA. ******************************************************************************* Rambone's Remarks ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Well that's the real story, straight from the horse's mouth. I've read at least a dozen text file's after this one, and I tend to believe what Mike has written. Now Amy (NotSoHumble Babe) tells a different story. According to her text file, she had seldom carded or phreaked before, but no one seems to be able to corroborate this information, and people that know her tend to say she was in deeper than she cares to admit. It's also been brought to my attention that Amy may be volunteering information to the feds about other people. What she has done before or after the bust may or may not be true, but here is her story. ******************************************************************************* Statement by The Not So Humble Babe ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Well, I am sure you have all heard that I had a small legal problem today, and I know how stuff gets blown out of proportion, so I thought I'd explain the story myself. Here goes... I have carded a few items in the past 3 days, and I have NEVER done this before. The Grim Reaper got CBI accounts and placed orders, and I picked them up. Well, one of the places Grim ordered from was Paradise Computers. They knew it was a bogus order, but told us the package was shipped. Then they called the FEDS. Anyhow, the Feds must have been watching the pickup spot, then following me around until I met up with Grim to deliver his share of the stuff. As soon as we went to make the exchange, the Secret Service, FBI, state police, and local police were running at us with bulletproof vests and automatic guns. They handcuffed us, separated us, and took each of us back to our homes for them to search. I haven't talked to Grim Reaper since I saw him lying next to me on the ground being arrested. But here's my story. About 20 agents came to my apartment and grabbed all computer equipment without a receipt. So we still have 1 modem, and this computer system. Anyhow, they grabbed every piece of paper they could find. Unfortunately, I am a very organized person, and had \"the who's who in the pirate world\" written down for my use. So if you ever gave me your real name, number, or address, it is now in the hands of the Secret Service and FBI. This list was quite large, as it took 2 years to compile. These boys did their homework. They knew Enterprize was USA HQ and they knew my handle, and they knew I supplied the group with software. They weren't going for just anyone here guys; they knew they needed to bust a group leader. Well, they did. Got me on carding, pirating, and a ton of other legal terms having to do with both of these. I was charged with 6 different counts, each holding a 5-30 year prison sentence. It doesn't look good for me at all. I'll post a file as soon as I get arraigned and let you guys know what is going on. But I will say this now, and I MEAN it. I love the groups, the software, and the competition. But regardless of what happens to me, I am done forever. No more NotSoHumble Babe, no more USA. I hate to do this to everyone, but I really don't have a choice. And regardless of who I am that got busted, be strong and support what you believe in your hearts: PIRACY. Don't let them win. You guys can all go on without me. Just promise me you won't give up and throw in the towel. If anyone wants to contact me, you can leave e-mail on Enterprize for me, or call voice AT YOUR OWN RISK. They told me they were tapping the phone lines. ******************************************************************************* News Flash: Mutli-Media Aggravation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Mutli-Media games (CD-Rom) are being played on the hard drive. There seems to be a trend of starting to send out huge CD-Rom games electronically through BBSes, the first one being Battle Chess I, and taking as much as 30 megs of hard-drive space. Soon after, Steller 7, and Wing Commander I started to show up. One of the reason for the start of this was a lack of programs coming down the pike, and one group decided to send Battle Chess out. I haven't seen anything lately, and hope programs meant for the CD-Rom will stay that way. ******************************************************************************* Another News Flash: OS/2 2.0 GA ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ IBM has released the long anticipated OS/2 (Operating System 2) 2.0 GA. OS/2 2.0 is an alternative to DOS 3.3, 4.01, or the latest, 5.0, and implements true 32 bit technology. There are several ways of using this operating system. OS/2, implementing it's own version of FAT, Dual Boot (which will allow you to be able to use DOS if necessary), and a Multi-Boot, brings up a prompt a when booting up which allows you to choose which operating system you would like to use (similar to Vpix for Unix and Xenix). I had the opportunity to view a preview of OS/2 2.0 GA at our local IBM Corporate Building, and to say the least, I was impressed. One of the points stressed at the meeting was the diverse control over many programs at the same time. OS/2 comes with its own operating system, along with a clone of sorts of both DOS and Windows. This feature will enable a user to access a DOS emulation without having to actually boot up DOS on the machine. It also has a Windows emulation which will eradicate the need for a full blown version. The one shortcoming of this is that it is Version 3.0, but I have been informed that 3.1 is right around the corner, and actually saw a demonstration of it. The true strong point of OS/2 is the mutli-tasking. After witnessing 15 windows open at the same time, all with programs running concurrently, I truly can say this is a step into the future, and it is here now. My personal experience running 2.0 is very impressive. Being able to properly run a program with the BBS in the background is a welcome treat, and I see no reason to ever support another operating system, until I get my hands on Windows NT. ******************************************************************************* Industry News ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The long awaited A-10 Avenger by Spectrum Holybyte has now been pushed back till early next year. This was the next in a series of interactive programs put out by SH to be played over the modem, the first being Falcon 3.0, a 256VGA jet game. UT (Ultra-Tech) and EMC (Electro-Magnetic Crackers) have now merged. This merger will be beneficial to both groups, bringing lacking talents together to form one of the largest cracking groups in the world, one with strong software connections, and the other with cracking resources and existing software support sites. Captain Tom of UT and Cyborg of EMC brought the whole thing together as a reality, and this merger may point them in the same direction as when INC formed their group from several smaller groups. ******************************************************************************* BBS Bust in Canada ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The Federal Investigations Section of the RCMP seized components of an electronic bulletin board system (BBS) \"90 North\" at a West Island residence. This is believed to be the first execution of a search warrant under the Copyright Act of Canada against an electronic bulletin board system. The seizure included 10 micro computers, seven modems and the software present on these systems (approximate value of $25,000). An electronic bulletin board is a service which allows personal computer users to exchange messages and to exchange or receive computer files including software, text and digitized images over telephone lines via a modem. During a four-month investigation, it was established that the 90 North BBS enabled users to obtain software in exchange for other files or for an annual fee of $49.00. While some of the programs consisted of \"shareware\" which may legally be distributed in this way, much of the available material was protected under the Copyright Act including beta versions of commercial software packages which have not yet been released on the market. More than 3,000 software programs were available to users of this BBS including WordPerfect 5.0, Microsoft DOS 5.0, Windows 3.0, Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows, Borland C++ 2.0, Quattro Pro 3.0, d-Base IV 1.1, SCO Xenix for DOS, Netware 3.11 and Clipper 5.0. Charges of commercial distribution of pirated software are planned against the owner and operator of 90 North. Paragraph 42 (1)(c) of the Copyright Act states that \"every person who knowingly distributes, infringes, copies of any work in which copyright subsists either for the purpose of trade or to such intent as to affect prejudicially the owner of the copyright, is guilty of an offense and liable on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding $25,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both, or on conviction on indictment, or a fine not exceeding $1 million or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both.\" _______________________________________________________________________________ More Details On The Canadian BBS Bust ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) has, for the first time under the Copyright Act of Canada, seized all the components of an electronic bulletin board (BBS), for providing illegal copies of copyrighted software to its subscribers. According to Allen Reynolds of the secretariat of the Canadian Alliance Against Software Theft (CAAST), the Federal Investigations Section of the RCMP has not laid formal charges against the West Island, Quebec owner and operator of the BBS. Charges of commercial distribution of pirated software are planned against the owner of 90 NORTH, he said. CAAST is a Canadian organization made up of ASHTON-TATE CANADA, LOTUS DEVELOMENT CANADA, MICROSOFT CANADA, NOVELL CANADA, and QUARTERDECK OFFICE SYSTEMS CANADA. Its main objective is to educate the public and business about the hazards of software piracy. In the raid, the RCMP seized 10 Micro computers, seven modems, and about $25,000 worth of software which was allegedly being distributed to users of the 90 NORTH BBS for an annual $49.00 fee, Reynolds said. Some of the seized software packages were Wordperfect 5.0, MS-DOS 5.0, Windows 3.0, Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows, dBase IV, Netware 3.11, and Qemm. If charged and convicted on a summary conviction, the 90 NORTH owner could face either a penalty or a fine not exceeding $25,000 or a jail term not exceeding six months or both. If the 90 NORTH owner is convicted on indictment, the penalty is a fine not exceeding $1 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both. \"I don't know how long it will take to lay charges,\" Reynolds said. He would not speculate when the RCMP would charge the owner of 90 NORTH, but he did say that the users of the 90 NORTH BBS will not be investigated by by the RCMP. He added that there is reason to believe that a number of BBSes across Canada are supplying beta test versions of products which can be dangerous to a user's system because they are usually laced with bugs. ******************************************************************************* Rambone's Remarks ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I have been informed that there are several more bulletin boards, especially those in the 416 NPA, that are under investigation right now. Most of the sysops being busted are ones that charge for download credits, which is a violation of the Copyright Act for reselling software. ******************************************************************************* New Release ~~~~~~~~~~~ Ultima UnderWorld by Origin Name: The Stygian Abyss Company: Origin Graphics: 256VGA Sound: SB/SB-Pro/Adlib/Roland Rating: 10/10 Supplier: High Pockets/Red Runner Copy Protection: None Date: 3/26/92 Looking for virtual reality in a game? Didn't think you could find it? Welcome to Origin's Ultima UnderWorld, \"The Stygian Abyss.\" Don't let the name fool you, this game does not have any attributes from the Ultima 1-6 series. You start out in a dark room looking out into what would be called a 3-D perspective. Picking up the bag in front of you would be your best bet -- it may have things that you need. Once you are on your way, you will notice how realistic the walls, ground, and ceiling look, almost like you are there. Along the way in your adventure, you will encounter many items that will help you along the way and some that may not, but you will have to decide. There are also many cultures down below that will be friendly and not-so-friendly; use your best judgement. Learn all your abilities. They will come in handy down the road. Practice your magic, it may save your life, or help you walk across water (hint). Learning how to jump correctly is important. You'll have to be able to leap across flaming, volcanic ravines to be able to finish the game. When you see writing on the wall or in a scroll with words and telling you to chant this to the Mantra, you better copy them down: They build up your attributes. All in all, there are 7 levels, and one unexplored level, sporting true 256VGA graphics, SB-Pro support, and a riveting sound-track. This is this closest thing to virtual reality graphics in the game market today, and it'll be a while before you play anything else like it. _______________________________________________________________________________ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ==Phrack Inc.== Volume Four, Issue Thirty-Eight, File 5 of 15 Network Miscellany IV Compiled from Internet Sources by Datastream Cowboy Network Miscellany created by Taran King Special Internet Connections February 5, 1992 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Most Recent Update Comments to: Scott Yanoff <yanoff@CSD4.CSD.UWM.EDU> American Philosophy Association telnet atl.calstate.edu or 130.150.102.33 Login: apa OFFERS: BBS for APA.

I owe them many thanks and please keep the info coming. I, and many others, have a few things to say about these BBSes in general. So bear with me, or skip ahead, but do take a look later. 1). These BBSes are provided as a service to anyone on Internet. Not just you. 2). While you may not directly pay for these services someone does. 3). You are a guest, and please keep that in mind while using these BBSes. Okay, that wasn't so bad after all. Most of these BBSes offer services unique to BBSing. Some offer small scale versions of standard Internet services. Keep in mind that mail or articles posted on BBSes do not reach everyone in the world, and if you can get to UseNet, you will probably find better responses. Most of the files on these BBSes can be found by anonymous FTP, so don't tie up the system with files if you have FTP. Do be considerate on these BBSes, some people aren't using telnet or rlogin to get to these, some people still dial numbers with modems at their homes. :-) For users of JANET (UK), you may access these BBSes through first connecting to UK.AC.NFSNET-RELAY.TELNET or PAD.UK.AC.NFSNET-RELAY.TELNET. Likewise, users of Internet can get to JANET by telnet SUN.NFS.AC.UK, login as janet.

RADAR stands for Radio Detecting And Ranging. A traffic speed RADAR works under the principle of physicals called the \"Doppler effect.\" This theory means that when a signal is reflected off of an object moving toward you, the signal will be at a higher frequency when it is closer to you than when the object is farther away or at the initial position. So the \"Doppler effect\" is THE basis for the use of the traffic speed RADAR. Right now in the United States, there are three bands that are allocated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for \"field disturbance sensors.\" These three bands have non-technical names, and all operate in the GigaHertz range (GigaHertz is a measure of frequency, i.e. 1 GHz = 1 billion cycles per second). The following is a list of the RADAR bands (as a point of reference FM radio modulates at 0.088 GHz to 0.108 GHz). ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: BAND : FREQUENCY NOTE ABOUT SPECIFIC BAND ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: X-Band : 10.525 GHz This is the frequency in which most RADAR units operate. K-Band : 24.150 GHz K-Band was developed to give a longer range of the beam. Ka-Band : 26.450 GHz This bandwidth is primarily for use with RADAR units that are used for \"photo-speed traps.\" ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: \"So if RADAR is so unreliable,\" you ask, \"why don't we have planes crashing on a daily basis?\" In the first place, TRAFFIC RADAR operates on a COMPLETELY different basis than, say, the type of RADAR that tracks weather or airplanes. The technology of traffic RADAR can in no way be compared to the accuracy of other types of RADAR. Traffic RADAR does NOT \"sweep\" like a regular RADAR. \"Sweeping\" means that the RADAR is picking up every single return signal it gets and plots them proportionally on a two-dimensional cathode ray tube. On the other hand, traffic RADAR uses a stationary beam. Also, traffic RADAR does not use a modulated beam like regular RADAR; it uses a constant beam. ***This is an important distinction because this means that if there are multiple images, the constant RADAR beam cannot distinguish between them!*** Furthermore, traffic RADAR is limited to things such as size. It must be able to fit inside a patrol car and it is also subject to cost. That means a municipality usually picks up the lowest bid it can get from various manufacturers. ______________________________________________________________________________ | | | Implementation of Traffic RADAR | It is important to note at this time that |_________________________________| while government standards for accuracy for military and commercial airline RADAR exist, traffic RADAR is NOT subject to ANY government standards whatsoever. An attempt was made to do this by the police and two government agencies, but were refused any type of compliance with traffic speed RADAR manufacturers and the Reagan administration. In the late 1970s, there was wide-spread publicity of about RADAR errors, including the well known tree clocked at 86-MPH in Florida. So, in 1979 the National Highway Safety Administration (NHSA) assigned to the National Bureau of Standards the task of testing all brands of traffic RADAR in use at that time for the purpose of discovering the source of these errors and proposing federal standards to eliminate them. In January of 1981, the proposed standards were published in the Federal Register. However, the Reagan administration took no action on the proposal (the last part of this file contains the profile from this report of various RADAR units). After THREE years of government inaction on the problem, the International Association of the Chief of Police (IACP) provided non-government standards by which all traffic RADAR units could be tested to assure accuracy: Volume I of the standards was published in April, 1984 and Volume II in June, of 1984. In June of 1986, the traffic RADAR manufacturers announced the formation of their own trade association, saying that they would not submit traffic RADAR units for IACP testing! Instead, they said they would use their own standards. So far, NO ONE has any idea of what these standards are; not the police, not the government and, most importantly, not the public! Basically, there are no performance requirements or standards for traffic RADAR and the claims of 86-MPH trees and 28-MPH houses cannot be refuted. ______________________________________________________________________________ | | | Common Traffic Radar Errors | Below is a list of common errors and how they |_____________________________| occur. This is the part of the article that must be used in conjunction with the previous file in this series. You must attempt, while pleading your case, to tie in some of the following errors to the situation you found yourself in when you got your speeding ticket. See Phrack #37 file #5 for details. \"The Look-Past Error\" Even when the RADAR operator aims his gun properly, the RADAR is subject to this type of error. This is caused by the RADAR reflecting off of a larger surface area in the background rather than the smaller reflective surface in the foreground. Evidence of this the Look-Past Error was printed in the October 1979 issue of \"Car and Driver.\" The author measured the effectiveness of KR11 RADAR system against various vehicles. The author showed that the typical sedan did not show up on the RADAR until it was less that 1200 feet away, however, a Ford 9000 semi tractor trailer could be picked up at 7600 feet. \"The Road Sign Error\" Due to the reflectability of microwaves, road signs, buildings, billboards, large trees, and other stationary objects are a source of errors. \"Radio Interference Error\" According to the Texas Department of Public Safety, \"UHF frequencies broadcast today can force RADAR to read various numbers when transmitted within the area.\" This type of interference could come from the radio within the patrol car, citizens band radio, or television stations. \"Fan Interference Error\" When the antenna is mounted inside the patrol car, \"RADAR will have the tendency to read the pulse of the fan motor (air conditioner, heater, defroster).\" This is a statement provided by the Texas Department of Public Safety who conducted a study of RADAR guns in 1987. The Texas Department of Public Safety offered no safeguard for this error. \"Beam Reflection Error\" Since microwaves are so readily reflected, the Texas Department of Public Safety cautioned mounting the antenna within the patrol car. One instructor said, \"It is possible that a reflective path can be set up through the rear view mirror that will produce RADAR readings on the vehicles behind the patrol car when the RADAR is aimed forward. And those vehicles can be either coming or going since traffic RADAR cannot distinguish between the direction.\" \"Double Bounce Error\" Again, since microwaves are easily reflected, the operator must be aware of a \"bad bounce\" and an ordinary reflection. And, as stated before, since large objects are more efficient than smaller ones, microwaves are attracted to them more. So, in effect, you could have an initial RADAR bounce off of the target vehicle, then from the target vehicle to a house or a truck going the opposite direction, and finally back to the patrol car. This error will mathematically get larger the slower the target vehicle is moving. \"The Cosine Error\" This is a mathematical error that takes place when the RADAR gun attempts to calculate the trigonomic equation that is programmed into it. The RADAR gun measures the angle at which the target enters a point and then exits a point (i.e. 25 degrees). The cosine of 25 is .9063. The RADAR gun was designed to calculate the speed of the patrol car by multiplying the speed of the patrol car (i.e. 50 mph) and the cosine of the angle (.9063) and it gets the false speed of the patrol vehicle as 45mph. Therefore, when you subtract the patrol speed from the target speed (i.e. 50, the same as the patrol car) you get the false sense that the target vehicle is traveling 5mph faster than the patrol car. ______________________________________________________________________________ | | | Technical Analysis Report | Below is a copy of the report mentioned above |___________________________| was conducted by the NHSA. But first I will explain what some of the criteria were under the testing conditions. It is also important to note that ALL RADAR units were subject to \"panning error\" except the CMI Speedgun-6 and Speedgun-8 models. Panning error occurs when the RADAR antenna is aimed at it's own display console. Unintentional errors of this sort can be eliminated when police officers are given adequate training. TEST UNIT : Model and manufacturer of the police speed RADAR unit in question. BAND : The short hand used for determining the broadcast frequency of the RADAR unit. X-Band is 8.2-12.4 GHz. K-Band is 18.0-26.5 GHz. BEAM WIDTH : The number that is 1/2 of the actual beam width. In other words, if a RADAR manufacturer says the beam width is 24 degrees, the actual beam width is 48 degrees. Very deceptive, eh? SHADOWING ERROR : This occurs in moving mode only. It is the result of the RADAR mistaking another vehicle for it's ground reference and adding speed to the target reading. POWER SURGE : This occurs when the RADAR unit is first turned on. This also occurs when the \"kill switch\" is used to defeat RADAR detectors. Lag time for kill in the moving mode ranges from 1.5-5 seconds. EXTERNAL INTERFERENCE : The NBS test only used CB radio and police-band radio for \"external interference.\" There are many other kinds of outside electromagnetic interference that may effect police RADAR. INTERNAL INTERFERENCE : Internal interference \"may be caused by ANY electrical component or accessory in the vehicle, especially when the patrol car's primary power source is used to operate the RADAR. [It should be noted that TWO of MPH's K-55 RADAR units were tested. This demonstrates that each RADAR unit can contain its own quirks regardless of the fact that it can be from the same model from the same manufacturer.] _______________________________________________________________________________ NATIONAL BUREAU OF STANDARDS SUMMARY ON TRAFFIC RADAR _______________________________________________________________________________ TEST UNIT BAND BEAM WIDTH SHADOWING ERROR - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Kustom Signals MR-9 K 13.3 Minor POWER SURGE EXTERNAL INTERF.
