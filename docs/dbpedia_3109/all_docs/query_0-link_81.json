The Palace of Auburn Hills, 4 Championship Dr., Auburn Hills; 248-377-0100.\n\nKeith Urban: Urban won his first award in 1977 as Best Solo Act from the County Music Awards of Australia. From that point on, he really hasn’t stopped. Trivia: He’s from New Zealand and his middle name is Lionel. 7:30 p.m. June 6. $20-$80. The Palace of Auburn Hills, 4 Championship Dr., Auburn Hills; 248-377-0100.\n\nCrosby, Stills and Nash: After several decades, CSN is still together, and David Crosby still has that droopy mustache. Along with a number of other artists and groups, CSN’s activist folk music of the ‘60s helped define not only the music of that era, but the era itself. And that feeling of activism, freedom, and growin’ your hair out long hasn’t left them or their music. 8 p.m. June 6. $21-$76. Meadow Brook Music Festival, 3554 Walton Blvd., Rochester Hills; 248-377-0100.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revisited: More than 20 years after Creedence Clearwater Revival disbanded, bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford got together for a few tunes and they ended up back in the band — sort of. The rockers picked up where the revival left off with their brand of Southern/swamp rock. 7:30 p.m. June 12. $7-$31.50. DTE Energy Music Theatre, 7774 Sashabaw Rd, Clarkston; 248-377-0100.\n\nBoz Scaggs: His name is Boz, which is pretty sweet. His mama didn’t name him Boz, of course. He’s William Royce Scaggs to her. But to everyone else, you better believe it’s Boz. Enough about the name. Scaggs is a blue-eyed soul, bluesy, rock-driven guitarist who has dropped several top 20 hits on American ears (American ‘cause we’re talking United States charts). He’s released albums in five different decades. That’s 50 years of music, folks. 8 p.m. June 17. $54.50-$59.50. MotorCity Casino Hotel, 2901 Grand River, Detroit; 313-237-7711.\n\nTower of Power: Cedar Point has a ride that will either shoot you straight up a tower at high speed or will take you to the top of another tower and drop you straight down. It’s called the Power Tower, which is different than the Tower of Power. The latter is a 10-member horn-based soul group from Oakland, Calif. But does it beat out the Cedar Point ride? Depends whom you ask, really. 7:30 p.m. June 18. $29.50-$75. The Michigan Theater, 603 E. Liberty, Ann Arbor; 734-668-8397.\n\n311: Three-eleven, if you’re wondering how to say 311. These boys from the Midwest like to mix rap, rock, funk, and reggae all in one song. Sounds like a bag of trail mix, right? Well, people do love the variety of 311. They like the music so much that nearly all of their albums have made it into the top 15 of the Billboard 200, their singles have saturated the radio playlist, and they’ve have a handful of songs in the top five of Billboard’s Modern Rock chart. Their newest album, Uplifter, comes out June 2. 6:30 p.m. June 19. $29.50-$42.50. Freedom Hill Amphitheatre, 14900 Metropolitan Pkwy., Sterling Heights; 586-268-7820.\n\nThe Detroit Cobras: If there is one thing that’ll bring you out for the Detroit Cobras more so than anything else, it’s this: That girl can sing. Rachel Nagy fronts the Detroit garage rock band and leads the Cobras on vocals in a way that’ll leave you weak in the knees. The Cobras do mostly adaptations of oldies plucked from their personal record collections. 8 p.m. June 20. $12. The Magic Stick, 4120 Woodward, Detroit; 313-833-9700.\n\nEarth, Wind and Fire & Chicago: Here’s a one-two punch of musically successful powerhouses from Chicago. On one side you have the American R&B group Earth, Wind and Fire, who have boxes full of Grammys and a number of top 10 albums and singles. And on the other side is Chicago, a progressive rock band that blazed up the charts in the early/mid ’70s with four consecutive No. 1 records. 7:30 p.m. June 24. $21.50-$76.50. DTE Energy Music Theatre, 7774 Sashabaw Rd., Clarkston; 248-377-0100.\n\nNew Kids on the Block: What can you say about the New Kids on the Block that hasn’t already been said — both in jest and with a straight face? In the late ’80s and early ’90s, millions of girls fell in love with these boys from Boston, and probably a good number of boys, too. After a 14-year hiatus, these five former heartthrobs decided to give it another go. They’ve been back a year now and their knees seem to be holding up quite well. 7 p.m. June 25. $22-$82. DTE Energy Music Theatre, 7774 Sashabaw Rd., Clarkston; 248-377-0100.\n\nLeon Russell: Keyboardist/singer Russell often dresses all in white. His white beard covers his face, his long white hair covers the rest, and he tops it off with a white cowboy hat. He also plays a mix of country and rock and R&B. He’s released more than 20 albums spanning from 1966 to 2006. That’s a lot of music. 8 p.m. June 26. $25. Magic Bag, 22920 Woodward, Ferndale; 248-544-3030.\n\nDr. John: Dr. John is as much of a doctor as Hunter S. Thompson was. So, really, he isn’t a doctor. Unless we’re talking about New Orleans blues, R&B, rock music. Then yeah, he’d be a doctor in that, and a good one. He got his start in the ’50s, grew his cultish following and international acclaim over the years. 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. June 27. $35. Magic Bag, 22920 Woodward, Ferndale; 248-544-3030.\n\nThe Gories: It’s been a while since a Detroit stage has seen the mega-influential garage rockers the Gories. But the wait is over. After a 15-year gap, the Gories are getting back together to a play a night of rock that may rip your face off — figuratively speaking, of course. The lineup of the group boasts acclaimed Detroit musicians Mick Collins from the Dirtbombs and Danny Kroha from the Demolition Doll Rods. 8 p.m. June. 27. $15. The Majestic Theatre, 4120 Woodward, Detroit; 313-833-9700.\n\nThe Offspring: Junior High probably wouldn’t have been the same for a generation of kids if it weren’t for the Offspring and their polished-up angst. The group was a nice bridge from punk rock with an edge to punk rock that made it to the radio. And guess what … these guys never broke up. 7 p.m. June 28. $27-$34.50. Freedom Hill Amphitheatre, 14900 Metropolitan Pkwy., Sterling Heights; 586-268-7820.\n\nTHEATER\n\nThe Blackbird Theatre: After Valentine Xavier, clad in a snakeskin jacket and toting a guitar, arrives in a new town, he’s smitten by a local elite’s wife in Orpheus Descending. $10-$20. Through June 20. 1600 Pauline Blvd., Ann Arbor; 734-332-3848.\n\nDetroit Repertory: Polish-born Holocaust survivor Mr. Isaacson, living in New York City, is overwhelmed by memories from his past when his employer hires a German-born man in Last Days of a Translator. June 2-28. $17-$20. 13103 Woodward, Detroit; 313-577-2972.\n\nEastern Michigan University: There is only one place where giants, witches, fairies, and the like can all solve their problems. Into the Woods, the three-time Tony Award-winning musical by Stephen Sondheim, is the hilarious tale of what happens when things don’t end happily ever after. $15. June 4-6. 103 Quirk Building, Ypsilanti; 734-487-1220.\n\nFisher: Grease, the classic story of poodle skirts, greasers, and high-school love, will have lots of fans dancing in their seats. Starring American Idol winner Taylor Hicks. June 9-28. Call for tickets. 3011 W. Grand Blvd., Detroit; 313-872-1000."
