        "text": "The Combined Nomenclature (CN) is a tool for classifying goods, set up to meet the requirements both of the Common Customs Tariff and of the EU's external trade statistics. The CN is also used in intra-EU trade statistics.\n\nIt is a further development (with special EU-specific subdivisions) of the World Customs Organization's Harmonized System nomenclature. This is a systematic list of commodities applied by most trading nations (and also used for international trade negotiations).\n\nHow does it work?\n\nIt is used to classify most goods when they are declared to customs in the EU.\n\nThe CN subheading stated in declarations for imported and exported goods determines:\n\nwhich rate of customs duty applies\n\nhow the goods are treated for statistical purposes or for other European Union policies\n\nLatest version\n\nEvery year, Annex I to the basic CN Regulation (Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff) is updated and published as a stand-alone Regulation in the EU's Official Journal. Such updates take into account any changes that have been agreed at international level, either at the World Customs Organization (WCO) with regard to the Harmonized System (HS) nomenclature or within the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO) with regard to conventional duty rates. Other changes may be required to reflect the evolution of, for example, commercial policy, technological or statistical requirements.\n\nInterpreting the nomenclature\n\nYou can do this with the aid of the explanatory notes, which explain the scope of the various tariff headings. The Explanatory Notes are established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff.\n\nThey are not legally binding.\n\nChanging the nomenclature\n\nIf you want to request an amendment to the combined nomenclature, you can find more details in the code of conduct.\n\nWhat's in the nomenclature?\n\nThe combined nomenclature includes:\n\npreliminary provisions (general rules for classification, rules related to duties or to nomenclatures, etc.)\n\ndescriptions of the goods\n\nadditional section/chapter notes and footnotes relating to CN subdivisions\n\nconventional duty rates – the EU tariff commitments in the WTO, and some EU autonomous duties\n\nsupplementary units\n\na set of tariff-related annexes (agriculture, chemistry, etc.) and a special coding system (Chapters 98 and 99).\n\nEach subdivision of the nomenclature is known as a ‘CN code’. It has an 8-digit code number followed by a description and a duty rate, and as the case may be, a supplementary unit."
