        "text": "by Phil Sawyer\n\nI have just finished re-reading this hardcover book which was published in 1953 ( two years before I was born!) and I must tell you this is a bit of a mystery book. I honestly can’t remember where or when I bought this book but it must have been after Sprague died since it is not autographed.\n\nThe publishing company is The Twayne Publishers. Wise in Lore is Master Brian! Perhaps he could tell us about the Twayne Publishers?\n\n(1.): The charming introduction is by Isaac Asimov. The good Doctor tells how he met Sprague and how much he admired him and was proud to be his friend. He met Sprague in John Campbell’s office. Campbell was rejecting an Asimov story and Isaac said that it took the sting away since he was able to meet Sprague!\n\n(2.): Asimov pointed out that Sprague took the physics of space travel seriously. If you approached light speed according to General Relativity time slowed down for you. The faster you moved in space the slower you moved in time. So if you traveled to Krishna and back in 5.5 months when you returned to Earth you would find that 20 years had passed on Earth. Sprague described this as ” subjective” time and ” objective” time.\n\n(3.): Asimov had his characters zip around the galaxy using ” Hyper Space.” Jack Vance had his characters use ” Space Drive” and leave it at that. But Sprague told Asimov ” If I don’t think a thing is possible, I don’t use it.” So you might call this Integrity. I am not aware of many other authors who worked relativistic time into their stories.\n\n(4.): There are eight stories that range in time from the year 2054-2153. The first tale is a cute yarn that tells of a dinosaur like Osirian going to college and being hazed when he wants to join a fraternity. The hazing backfires on the cruel members of the fraternity.\n\n(5.): The second story is ” Summer Wear.” It tells of two fashion salesmen who want to corner the fashion market on the planet of the Osirians. It is very funny and ironic and light hearted. I think Sprague had fun writing that story.\n\n(6.): The story ” Finished” tells of the Space Federation trying to keep modern technology out of the hands of the Krishnans and what happens when they meet an especially intelligent and inquisitive Krishnan.\n\n(7.): Sprague’s story “Git Along!” introduces us to Darius Mehmed Koshay. He is another of those rare de Camp characters: he is pretty much a louse and a creep. There was something about the Krishna stories that inspired Sprague to create some pretty sleazy characters. You could imagine meeting them in that low life saloon in the first ” Star Wars” movie. And then the seventh chapter is “Perpetual Motion” where I read again about that cad Felix Borel.\n\n(8.): I think the best story is the last, “The Continent Makers.” Sprague brings up colonization and colonies and the wrongs and the problems that arise from starting colonies. The ironic and splendid action arises out of the efforts of the criminals to create a new continent on Earth and then populate it with the beings known as Thothians. Sprague’s tale makes you think and ponder about the wrongs and the morality of colonization. Of course, he does it in his usual way, with a very light touch in the middle of an adventure story. The hero Graham falls in love with the beautiful Krishnan Varnipaz but things do not work out quite as Graham would have wished them to.\n\nAll in all this is a splendid volume. I certainly wish it could be reprinted in a beautiful collector’s edition! Read all the Krishna stories that you can! They are very rewarding! I will include a little essay on Relativity to illustrate how Sprague used Einstein’s discoveries.\n\nYours in Crom!\n\nBrian Kunde responded to the original post at the L. Sprague de Camp – Enchanter of the Quill Facebook page:\n\nWonderful review, Phillip Sawyer, but how did you manage to omit the two Vishnu stories, “The Galton Whistle” and “The Animal-Cracker Plot” (the latter marking the actual debut of Darius Koshay). As for Twayne Publishers, it was one of those companies that jumped on the SF bandwagon in the early 1950s. They published de Camp’s three big “series” collections of the era in 1953, not just The Continent Makers and Other Tales of the Viagens, but The Tritonian Ring and Other Pusadian Tales and Tales From Gavagan’s Bar (with Fletcher Pratt). They are most famous for initiating the “Twayne Triplets” anthologies, in which three stories by three separate authors would deal with the same invented planet (or topic). Only two of these were actually issued, both in 1952, but I believe at least four were planned. The Great Fetish was originally intended to be part of a Twayne Triplet. Twayne abandoned the SF field by the mid-fifties, though it later issued a couple related non-fiction series on SF authors and masterworks. It became an imprint of G. K. Hall & Co. in 1973, which in turn was subsequently absorbed into Gale, and later Cengage.\n\nPhil responded:\n\nMany thanks! Sorry I skipped a few while touching on my favorites.\n\nYou or Moi should write a essay sometimes about Krishna and the Wild West. Krishna reminds me of Tombstone circa 1880 with all of the raffish and shadowy characters who end up there!\n\nBrian responded:\n\nPhillip Sawyer, for an earthly analogy, I’m thinking more Western explorers, diplomats, rogues, and so on in the Middle East and South and Southeast Asia, around the 18th and 19th centuries. But, yeah, 19th c. Arizona could work as well.\n\nPhil’s response:\n\nPerhaps the 19th century Scramble for Africa."
