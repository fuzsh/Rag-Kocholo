        "meta_description": "During the Middle Ages, very few people are documented as having traveled to unknown lands. Yet three remarkable explorers from different parts of the world did just that. Marco Polo of Venice is probably the most famous overland traveler of all time; stories of his journeys first introduced Europeans to Central Asia and China. Ibn Battuta of Tangier is known as the greatest Muslim explorer in history; he traveled over 75,000 miles to nearly every Muslim country in the world. Zheng He of China commanded an enormous fleet of ships and journeyed to 30 countries throughout Asia and Africa. Through several primary source activities and short videos, students will understand the significance of all three explorers and how they contributed to the spread of different cultures and ideas across the world.",
