        "text": "AKA Lyon Sprague de Camp\n\nBorn: 27-Nov-1907\n\nBirthplace: New York City\n\nDied: 6-Nov-2000\n\nLocation of death: Plano, TX\n\nCause of death: Stroke\n\nRemains: Buried, Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, VA\n\nGender: Male\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Author\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: Lest Darkness Fall\n\nScience fiction and fantasy author L. Sprague de Camp is remembered as one of the major authors of the Golden Age of science fiction literature. Responsible for continuing the Conan the Barbarian saga begun by friend Robert E. Howard, de Camp also produced a broad rage of other fiction and non-fiction works, including biographies of both Howard and H. P. Lovecraft as well as a variety of popular science works. Many of the latter were aimed at debunking non-scientific beliefs and included such titles as The Ancient Engineers (1974), The Great Monkey Trial (1968) and Lost Continents: The Atlantis Theme in History, Science, and Literature (1970). Some of de Camp's most popular works of fiction include Lest Darkness Fall (1941), The Wheels of If (1940), The Glory That Was (1960), and The Dragon of Ishtar Gate (1961) as well as numerous novels created in collaboration with author Fletcher Pratt in the Harold Shea and Enchanter series.\n\nBorn in New York City on November 27, 1907, de Camp received his early education both in New York and in the American South. He went on to earn his BS in Aeronautical Engineering from Cal Tech in 1930, and his MS from Stevens Institute in 1933. Afterwards, he went to work for a company that dealt with patenting, eventually making his authorial debut with a textbook on the same subject. His first book of fiction was Genus Homo, written with P Schuyler Miller, but the work could not find a receptive editor until 1950.\n\nHowever, in 1937, de Camp's first short fiction piece, \"The Isolinguals\", was accepted by Astounding Science Fiction. He made further contributions to Astounding (working especially well with it's later editor John W. Campbell), as well as to a variety of other pulps. His most notable works from this period include the Johnny Black stories (about an intelligent bear), as well as a number of others later gathered in his The Best of L. Sprague de Camp collection (1978).\n\nIn 1939 de Camp married Catherine Crook who would also serve as his re-write editor and sometimes collaborator during the rest of their years together. In 1942 he joined the U.S. Naval Reserve, serving, as Lieutenant Commander, in the same Philadelphia Naval Yard as friends and fellow science fiction authors Isaac Asimov and Robert A. Heinlein. Like Heinlein and Asimov (as well as A. E. van Vogt, Frederik Pohl, Arthur C. Clarke, and others), de Camp would eventually become one of the principle authors of what is now referred to as the Golden Age of science fiction. De Camp's work was part of an explosion of titles and ideas that transformed the tiny emerging sci-fi genre (once defined almost entirely by H.G. Wells and Jules Verne) into a broad, rich and burgeoning body of literature.\n\nDe Camp himself (both singly and in collaboration with others) produced nearly 100 titles, not to mention scores of short stories -- and a number of edited anthologies. But although his first forays into fiction were largely sci-fi (especially time travel tales), he began in the 1950s to produce more straightforward sword & sorcery/fantasy novels. The impetus for this may have been his massive involvement with Robert E. Howard's Conan tales. De Camp compiled and rewrote the unpolished and often unfinished material left by the self-murdered Howard. Adding his own fill where needed, he brought the tales into a publishable book format and before handing them off to Gnome Press. The end result of this Howard/de Camp post mortem collaboration was a highly successful series, later enhanced even further by fresh installments created by de Camp, often in collaboration with Lin Carter and others. New authors, including Robert Jordan, have continued the Conan series, and in 1982 Conan made his move to the big screen, embodied in the person of actor (and now California governor) Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan the Barbarian (1982). The film was successful enough, by Hollywood standards, to generate the 1984 sequel Conan the Destroyer.\n\nDe Camp died on November 6, 2000. He was preceded, seven months earlier, by death his wife, Catherine Cook de Camp. His companion for some of sixty years, he passed away on the day that would have been her birthday. L. Sprague De Camp's accolades and distinctions include Guest of Honor at the 1966 World Science Fiction Convention, the Nebula Grand Master Award (1978), the World Science Fiction Society's Gandalf Grand Master award (1976), and the Hugo Award for Time and Chance (1997), his autobiography. De Camp was also awarded the first Sidewise Award for Alternate History Lifetime Achievement in 1995. Extremely active even into his ninth decade, one of de Camp's last adventures was an Easter sojourn with Catherine in 1994 to the South Pacific's remote Easter Island. He is remembered, not only as an author of considerable achievement, but also as a world traveler who spoke several languages and who participated in a number of scholarly, professional, literary, and social organizations.\n\nWife: Catherine Adelaide Cook de Camp (m. 12-Aug-1931, d. 9-Apr-2000)\n\nSon: Lyman Sprague de Camp\n\nSon: Gerard Beekman de Camp\n\nBrother: Lyman Lyon de Camp\n\nUniversity: BS Aeronautical Engineering, California Institute of Technology (1930)\n\nUniversity: MS Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology (1933)\n\nWorld Fantasy Award 1984 Lifetime Achievement\n\nOfficial Website:\n\nhttp://www.lspraguedecamp.com/\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nLest Darkness Fall (1941)\n\nLand of Unreason (1942, with Fletcher Pratt)\n\nThe Carnelian Cube (1948, with Fletcher Pratt)\n\nDivide and Rule (1948)\n\nThe Stolen Dormouse (1948)\n\nGenus Homo (1950, with P Schuyler Miller)\n\nRogue Queen (1951)\n\nThe Undesired Princess (1951)\n\nThe Great Monkey Trial (1968, non-fiction)\n\nLost Continents: The Atlantis Theme in History, Science, and Literature (1970, non-fiction)\n\nAl Azif: The Necronomicon (1973, non-fiction, with Abdul Alhazred)\n\nThe Ancient Engineers (1974, non-fiction)\n\nDark Valley Destiny: The Life of Robert E.
