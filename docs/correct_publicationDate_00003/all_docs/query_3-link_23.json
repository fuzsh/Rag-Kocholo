        "text": "by Brian Kunde\n\nFor today’s de Camp highlight I’m reviewing a book I do not own in physical form, and which doesn’t even exist in that form as a stand-alone publication, except in German. (There are stand-alone ebook versions.) It can, however, be found as a component in two other de Camp publications, both of which I do have. So, in a sense, I’m addressing three different books today; the work itself, and the two other books in which it appears. But the work itself is, I feel, a major one, deserving recognition in its own right. I refer to The Virgin of Zesh, a Viagens Interplanetarias novella set on the planet Krishna.\n\nThe Virgin of Zesh first appeared in Thrilling Wonder Stories v. 41, no. 3, February 1953. It’s “featured” on the cover, along with another novella, Kendell Foster Cressen’s “Assignment to Aldebaran,” though the Jack Coggins cover art fits neither, showing instead a fellow in space-armor on a sort of rocket sled prospecting the rings of Saturn. Virgin does get pride of place in the contents.\n\nAs its title suggests, de Camp regarded The Virgin of Zesh as a Krishna novel. It has the format he always used for such, “The [Noun] of {Proper noun starting with Z].” It is not, however, of novel length. Of course, not all de Camp novels began as book-length works. Others also first appeared as shorter one-offs in magazines. Of these, some were expanded for book publication, some had been cut for the magazine appearance and reverted to their original lengths, and some were filled out in other ways, usually by appending one or more shorter stories, with the resulting book taking the title of the longer work. Examples include Divide and Rule (paired with “The Stolen Dormouse”), The Undesired Princess (paired with “Mr. Arson”), The Queen of Zamba (paired with “Perpetual Motion”), The Tritonian Ring and Other Pusadian Tales (with three stories added), and The Continent Makers and Other Tales of the Viagens (with seven stories added).\n\nI suspect The Virgin of Zesh, too, was intended to be make up its own book, either by expansion or addition of one or more companion tales. But, in the short run, neither happened. Probably because the first wave of the Viagens Interplanetarias tales was truncated, the bottom falling out of the planetary romance type story as the 1950s progressed. Whatever the reason, it didn’t make it into book form at all.\n\nOr, rather, it didn’t until really, really late, just before de Camp finally revived the Viagens series in the late 1970s, when, as with other not-quite-novels, it too got paired with a shorter work to fill a book—this time, the parallel universe novella “The Wheels of If”—resulting in The Virgin & The Wheels (Popular Library, April 1976). I have a copy of this book somewhere, but have mislaid it. So my primary cover scan for this article is from the later The Virgin of Zesh & The Tower of Zanid (of which more anon), and the one of this one was swiped from the net. Sorry.\n\nThat said, The Virgin & The Wheels features a gorgeous wrap-around cover painting by Don Maitz. It illustrates the scene from Virgin in which Yuruzh and his aqualung-equipped Záva subjects board the flagship of Sofkar, Dasht of Darya, to save hostage Althea Merrick, who is tied naked to the main mast. Maitz has done his homework and read the story, and it shows. The only thing he missed is that all Krishnans, both the tailed Záva and the more humanoid Daryava, are sprout feathery antennae from between their eyebrows. No antennae here. That aside, this may be the best cover illustration of any Viagens tale, ever.\n\nIt would be interesting to learn how it was this book came to be. The Virgin & The Wheels reeks of someone, author, publisher, or both, having hedged their bets. This is demonstrated in the volume combining both pieces in its title rather than taking the title of the longer work. Though Virgin is the longer of the two pieces, is given primacy in the joint title, hogs the cover art, and comes before the other piece, I suspect “Wheels” was intended as the main draw. Unlike Virgin, “Wheels” was already a classic, and had achieved book publication before, headlining its own collection (The Wheels of If and Other Science-Fiction (Shasta, 1949, and Berkley Medallion, October 1970).\n\nIt was certainly the main draw for me; I myself bought the book for “Wheels,” because its collection had vanished from the bookstores by 1976, so I didn’t (then) have that story. Moreover, like other younger readers of the time, I had not previously encountered any Viagens stories, or even heard of The Virgin of Zesh.\n\nIt looks to me like someone didn’t think Virgin would sell without a sweetener, but still wanted to publish it. Maybe de Camp was testing the waters for his revival of the Viagens series? Though … why do it with the long-mothballed Virgin, and paired with “The Wheels of If,” when, clearly, any sales figures would more likely reflect the latter? Doesn’t sound like a very valid test.\n\nRegardless, it was done, and The Virgin of Zesh, and with it the Viagens series, was put before a whole new generation of readers. The following year saw both republication of The Queen of Zamba, in a restored edition, and initial publication of The Hostage of Zir, the first new Viagens tale in nearly two decades. The series was off and running once more.\n\nWhen Ace Books issued its uniform paperback edition of the Krishna books in the 1980s Virgin surfaced again, this time paired with The Tower of Zanid, in the combined edition The Virgin of Zesh & The Tower of Zanid (Ace Books, February 1983). This version marked a step up for the story. Not only was it again given pride of place in the title over the paired piece (which, again, had previously been published separately, and in this instance was the longer story), but the book did better than Ace expected it to, necessitating a second printing two months after the first. The only downside here for Virgin was that the cover art, by Paul Alexander, illustrates the other story, The Tower of Zanid. (Otherwise, it’s a fine cover, and, as previously indicated, is the one I scanned to go with this article.) Alexander, incidentally, was Ace’s go-to cover artist for all but one of its Krishna titles. He gives the set a nice uniformity, even if his ayas all look like multi-legged horses and his bishtars like multi-legged and multi-tusked elephants.\n\nThe next year, finally, saw Virgin’s first publication on its own, in German translation. Die Jungfrau von Zesh, translated by Joachim Pente, was issued in paperback by W. Heyne Verlag, München, in September 1984. But … it took its cover art from The Virgin of Zesh & The Tower of Zanid, which, as noted, illustrated Zanid, not Zesh. Strange.\n\nDigression time! You may well wonder, “What cover art did Heyne use for its edition of Zanid, then?” As did I! So I checked. Heyne took the art from Ace’s edition of The Prisoner of Zhamanak (also by Paul Alexander)—which, of course illustrated Zhamanak, not Zanid! (Though it does at least feature Percy Mjipa, who appears in both books—so that’s something.) This, in turn, begs the question, what did Heyne use for its edition of Zhamanak? For some reason, it went completely outside de Camp and the Viagens series for that one, swiping the Paul Alexander cover art of the Ann Maxwell novel The Jaws of Menx. The scene shown kind of fits Zhamanak, with a man and woman journeying on alien monster-horses through a weird landscape. But the man’s white, unmistakably notZhamanak’s black protagonist Percy Mjipa, the alien monster-horses are different alien monster-horses from those Alexander has stand in for de Camp’s ayas, and the weird landscape is a giant cavern—for Zhamanak, it should have been a dense jungle. Quite a game of musical covers, here, though all by Paul Alexander! (Incidentally, The Jaws of Menx at least sounds a bit like a Krishna book, in that it too is set on a non-technological world warily monitored by an interstellar organization)\n\nBack to Virgin, and its editions. There are two more in English, both from SF Gateway/Orion, British purveyor of all those infamous yellow cover e-editions, and both from September, 2011. Yes, that’s right, two versions of Virgin from these folks! One is an e-edition of The Virgin & The Wheels, which perhaps they issued to make up not having an edition of The Wheels of If and Other Science-Fiction. Why don’t they? Dunno. But at least they realized they couldn’t have a relatively comprehensive set of de Camp’s fiction without “The Wheels of If.” The second version is, finally, a stand-alone, English language edition of The Virgin of Zesh itself! Hallelujah! I can almost forgive them their horrible yellow covers, for that alone! But, yeah. It’s an ebook. There’s still no stand-alone print English language edition.\n\nThere’s one more edition to tell of, an ebook of the German version, Die Jungfrau von Zesh, issued quite recently, in 2020. The publication data is messy. OCLC has two records for it, reflecting different publishers, BookRix, München, and epubli, Berlin. Since both are also credited to publisher Apex-Verlag, one of these is likely a phantom. The amazon.com listing gives the publisher as Apex Fantasy, a variation of Apex-Verlag.\n\nThis edition has a very odd cover, showing the face of an angry young woman with a brushy headdress (or maybe just hair) of black and red. She’s also got red eyes and lips and an ivory/yellow complexion. Whether she’s meant to be protagonist Althea Merrick or the “Virgin of Zesh” herself (a tailed Záva oracle woman) is unclear. She’s quite human-looking, so probably Althea. Or the two could simply have been conflated. Or, most likely of all, the title just prompted someone to decide, “Hey, we need a young woman on this thing!” The artist is uncredited.\n\nSo much for the bibliographical and artistic details. Now, confession time. I wrote above that the first book publication of Virgin, The Virgin & The Wheels, put the story before a new generation of readers. My generation, actually. Well … hopefully the rest of my generation appreciated it more than I did.\n\nSome things one loves at first sight, and later detests. My own example is Mel Brooks’s Silent Movie, coincidentally released about the same time as The Virgin & The Wheels, which I thought the funniest thing ever on first viewing, but find worse and worse every time I’ve seen it since—the Suck Fairy’s been at that one big time. Other things you don’t like, then come to love. For me, that’s The Virgin of Zesh.\n\nAs previously admitted, I bought The Virgin & The Wheels for “The Wheels of If,” but, of course, I read the other story as well. And I just didn’t get it. I grew up on Edgar Rice Burroughs stories, with masterful heroes, obvious villains, and very subsidiary (if plucky) heroines. In Virgin, we’re introduced right off to five characters, four male and one female, all underwhelming. Two of the men fade from the scene quickly; one is revealed as a baddy, but is left behind until quite near the end. The others all just run from him. So … who’s the hero? Who do I root for?\n\nYou will perceive I had little notion then that a protagonist didn’t have to be heroic, or could develop heroic qualities as the story went on, or could be female. Or of how de Camp sometimes stands reader expectations on their heads and does something unexpected, like, you know, challenging the reader. That’s what happens here. This isn’t the sort of story you can predict; you have to actually read it to see where it’s going. While I later came to value that sort of thing, at sixteen it just confused me.\n\nSuffice it to say that it took me some time to see that the protagonist of this story is mousy little viewpoint character, Althea Merrick, and the “hero,” if such there is, is the late-appearing tailed Krishnan, Yuruzh. At the beginning, Althea is at loose ends, carried on by events, her flawed male acquaintances Kirwan and Barr, and her need to escape the Terran security chief Afanasi Gorchakov, who has duped and date-raped her into marriage.\n\nWhich is another thing I failed to realize the first time around. We see Gorchakov getting Althea drunk. We see her wake up the next day, with little memory of what happened. For a long time, I thought he just took advantage of her drink-induced amnesia to claim she had married him—after all, we never saw it happen. But a closer reading shows that prim, strait-laced Althea loses her inhibitions (and common sense) when drunk. The thing she’s running away from is real.\n\nWith no good options, she joins Brian Kirwan and Gottfried Barr in their journey to the island of Zesh, where the former intends to join a Terran utopian colony and the latter to study the same. De Camp took a skeptical view of utopians, as we see in this and other stories—”New Arcadia” is one that comes to mind. On the voyage, Althea is nearly raped again by a Krishnan sailor, whom she later gets on her side by reviving him after he is keelhauled for the offense. His warning is the Terran trio’s first clue their journey could involve them in some perilous geopolitical affairs.\n\nThen we get to Zesh, and the Terran utopians of Elysion, who prove impractical, pacifistic, riven with factionalism, and deaf to our trio’s news that their island is about to become a bone of contention between the neighboring isle of Zá, from whom they rent the place, and the imperialistic Dasht of Darya, who intends to conquer it. Filled with premonitions of doom, the three elect to warn Zá themselves, by visiting the primary representative of Záva authority on Zesh, the native oracle known as the Virgin of Zesh. Knew the title element was going to come in somewhere, didn’t you?\n\nIncidentally, another peculiarity of de Camp is his tendency to choose titles only tangentially related to the story. One might presume going in that the “Virgin of Zesh” would be a reference to Althea, given her sexual inexperience and intent to go there. But no. And the actual Virgin appears only in the scene in which Althea and her companions visit her, promptly dashing off to carry their news to Zá without so much as a thank you.\n\nSuch titular misdirection is common in the Krishna books. The Virgin of Zesh may be the worst offender, but it’s far from alone. The Queen of Zamba is offstage through most of the book she appears in, and merely its MacGuffin. The Hand of Zei and The Prisoner of Zhamanak are, as well, albeit much more prominent. The Hostage of Zir and The Bones of Zora each reference but one episode in the books by those names (though the hostage is, at least, its book’s protagonist, and the bones do drive the plot in their book). De Camp will do almost anything to sneak in that vital Z!\n\nKirwan attempts at one point to forcibly seduce Althea. Young me: “What’s with all this sexual peril stuff?” Old me: “It presents a realistic view of how women fare in lawless, male-dominated frontier societies. The thing to watch is how Althea copes, and grows from a helpless waif to a capable, decisive player in forging her own destiny.” Young me: “I don’t get it.” Old me: “Give it time.”\n\nFrom there, events follow fast and furious. The Záva, under their charismatic leader Yuruzh, arrive to defend Zesh and remind the utopians of their obligations. Althea bravely volunteers to help the Záva by carrying false intelligence to the invading Daryava. (That’s how she ends up tied to the mast.) Yuruzh defeats the Daryava by brilliant stratagems. Then, just as things are starting to look up, Gorchakov shows up. Oh, yeah. Remember him?\n\nGorchakov abducts Althea at gunpoint, and it’s evident he’s mad at her for running off. Mad enough to torture and murder her. Kirwan attempts to redeem himself by intervening, only to be shot dead for his efforts. Cowardly Barr runs off. Practical Yuruzh declines to interfere. (And he was doing so well up till now, too…) So Gorchakov absconds by ship with his prey. Althea is doomed!\n\nUntil Yuruzh swoops in and save her, that is. He may be practical (what use is a dead hero?), but that doesn’t mean he’s indifferent, or unresourceful. But—here’s the kicker. It takes both of them to take down Gorchakov. Althea really comes into her own, here. And there’s even a happily ever after. Yuruzh proposes to Althea, and is accepted. (She was attracted to him the first time she saw him, and, it turns out, vice versa.) Though the prospect of marrying an alien is as disconcerting as it is exciting. She helps decide by fortifying herself with kvad, the native version of booze…\n\nIs there a pattern, here? Is Althea going to wake up the next day with second thoughts, again? Well, no. This union has the blessing of the author, whose account naturally looked more straightforward to his original audience than it does to our woke 21st century eyes. We may feel misgivings, but sometimes you just have to accept original intent.\n\nThere’s an important subplot in this story I haven’t touched yet, that is resolved in the final pages. It’s been a mystery all through the tale how the tailed Krishnans of Zá, formerly little more than exploited primitives, have risen under Yuruzh to become a major power in the Sadabao Sea region. As it happens, he was taken to Earth in his youth, where he was subjected to the “Pannoëtic treatment,” an experimental process that can either increase intelligence (in lower primates) or lead to madness (in humans). For tailed Krishnans, it turns out to do the former. Pretending it wore off so he would be allowed to return home, Yuruzh subjected his fellow Záva to the procedure, so uplifting them to equality with the dominant tailless Krishnans.\n\nA few points about Yuruzh and his background. First, his account of his time on Earth makes me suspect he might have been the unnamed tailed Krishnan who played a small but heroic role in the Viagens short story “The Colorful Character” (Thrilling Wonder Stories, December 1949, collected in Sprague de Camp’s New Anthology of Science Fiction, 1953). The individual in that tale was also on Earth and subject to scientific study, and the events portrayed occur early enough in the Viagens chronology that the two characters could be one and the same. I like to think so, anyway.\n\nSecond, the manner in which he acquired his advanced intelligence and (supposedly) lost it is, in outline, the plot of Daniel Keyes‘s award-winning story “Flowers for Algernon“ (The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, April 1959, expanded to novel-length in 1966). The primary difference is that Yuruzh, unlike Keyes’s Charlie Gordon, merely feigns losing his newly acquired brainpower. Given that de Camp’s story antedates Keyes’s, it is at least plausible that Keyes found the idea for “Flowers” in The Virgin of Zesh. I don’t know that this theory can be proven one way or the other, but the possibility intrigues me.\n\nThird, I the idea for Yuruzh’s Pannoëtic treatment is prefigured in de Camp’s own Johnny Black stories (1938-1940), in which a similar process bestows human intelligence on black bear Johnny Black, chimpanzee McGinty, and other animals. It also drives at least one human mad—Johnny’s patron Professor Methuen, supercharging his inventiveness while removing his moral compunctions and connection to humanity. (Getting drunk returns him to normal, making him a sort of opposite to Henry Kuttner’s later tales of Galloway Gallegher, who is normal when sober and brilliant when drunk.) One might reasonably postulate a link between the Johnny Black and Viagens series on the basis of this treatment!\n\nIn The Virgin of Zesh, however, the Pannoëtic treatment seems an obvious spoof of pseudo-scientific notions of the 50s like those of Hubbard, which promise enlightenment while inculcating idiocy. De Camp, while decrying such ideas in real life, where they can lead the gullible astray, was not averse to employing them in his fiction, where they can be “real” for plot purposes. The Viagens series is in fact chock-full of such gimmicks. Want mind control? Try the Osirians’ pseudo-hypnosis. Longevity? There’s a pill for that. Cures for personality disorders, deviant behavior, or alcoholism? There are effective psychiatric treatments. There’s even a way around basic geological processes that permits raising new continents within human lifespans! All good, clean fun—in fiction!\n\nFinal thoughts. Putting such peripheral issues aside, Virgin is, as you might well guess from the above, not a story likely to fly in today’s cultural climate. The attitudes of the characters and author alike, particularly on gender roles, are too much of their time. But these or similar attitudes have held throughout history, until very recently. I’m not sure pretending otherwise, as happens in so much modern speculative fiction, does the reader any favors. Still, some today will be horrified, or at least made uncomfortable, by the casual brutality of the story, and what it puts Althea through. And I wouldn’t call that a wrong response.\n\nWhat I would say is that, for its time, The Virgin of Zesh was a milestone in the realistic treatment of women in speculative fiction. Most female characters of the time are at best ciphers, but de Came gives us an actual honest-to-God female protagonist, an everywoman rather than a superwoman, facing challenges a person in her situation likely would have, and maturing and rising to match them. Regardless of the assumptions behind it, it’s a good story, and I feel de Camp did well with it. In my opinion, it holds up better today than some of his later efforts, from the 70s onward, to update the social environment of his settings to reflect contemporary mores. I find some of these truly wince-worthy. In contrast, I find myself liking The Virgin of Zesh more and more all the time.\n\nBecause it never got a stand-alone edition during de Camp’s lifetime, there’s no dedication associated with this novella. At least, I think there isn’t. I would double-check my copy of The Virgin & The Wheels for one, if I could find it, but none is quoted in Laughlin and Levack, which is usually good on such things. There’s definitely no dedication to The Virgin of Zesh & The Tower of Zanid. Probably because it was a combination rather than its own book.\n\n# # #"
