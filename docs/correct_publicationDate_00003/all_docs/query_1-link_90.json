        "text": "The Best of L. Sprague de Camp\n\n(Science Fiction Book Club edition, 1978. Cover by Richard Corben)\n\nThe Best of L. Sprague De Camp (1978) was the fifteenth installment in Lester Del Rey’s Classic Science Fiction Series. Poul Anderson (1926–2001) gives the introduction. Darrel Sweet (1934–2011) does his second cover of the series, the first being The Best of Cordwainer Smith. L. Sprague De Camp (1907–2000), still living at the time, wrote the afterword.\n\nI’m a fairly late-comer to science fiction. I grew up with Star Wars and typical sci-fi shows and movies of the late 70s and 80s, but my reading picks tended to be more towards fantasy and horror. So, like many of these classic sci-fi authors in the Del Rey series, L. Sprague De Camp was a new name to me. And it’s interesting, I think, how one can come to a new writer.\n\nIn all honesty, I was not looking forward to reading this volume. Most of what I’ve read of and about De Camp hasn’t given me the most favorable impression. Case in point: A couple of years ago I compared De Camp’s Robert E. Howard (REH) biography with Mark Finn’s. If you know anything about De Camp’s reputation among many REH fans, you’ll know that it is usually less than favorable (again, see my earlier post for more details). And, after reading De Camp’s REH bio, I came around to agreeing with some of this critical press. In short, I thought that De Camp could often come off as conceited with his overly bold claims, especially given his tendency of providing insufficient evidence — or none at all!\n\nBut after reading The Best of L. Sprague De Camp, I have to say that despite his reputation with many an REH fan, this has become one of my favorite volumes in the Del Rey series. I found De Camp to be a very fascinating writer. Two things, I think, really stand out in his science fiction writing.\n\n[Click the images for dinosaur-sized versions.]\n\nThe Best of L. Sprague de Camp\n\n(Del Rey paperback edition, 1978. Cover by Darrell Sweet)\n\nOne, De Camp can be very funny. Many of his stories can be kind of zany setups for slapstick. “Nothing in the Rules” is about a women’s swim meet where one of the coaches enters a mermaid against the other swim teams. Since the judges see “nothing in the rules” against entering a mermaid, they allow it. Given this argument from silence, one of the competing coaches enters a sea lion, and all kinds of other hilarity ensues.\n\n“The Hardwood Pile” is about a haunted pile of lumber. Not scary, but funny. It turns out that the pile of wood was from a tree inhabited by a sphendamniad — a sort of tree fairy — who is more than a little miffed that people keep taking her home and trying to destroy or sell it.\n\n“The Guided Man” is about a service that has a proprietary technology that allows the seemingly inept to have their bodies taken over remotely by experts who easily steer them through awkward or difficult situations. One of the “guides,” named Falck, falls in love with the love interest of one of his customers (Ovid Ross). A pretty hilarious scene evolves when Falck crosses the wires of his guiding machine with another guide who is supposed to be helping a ballet dancer, while Ovid Ross is at a trade show. The result:\n\nOvid Ross took off in a tremendous leap from the stage and began bounding around the showroom, leaping high into the air to kick his heels together and fling his arms about. Ross, imprisoned in his skull, was as astonished as anyone. He thought Falck must have gone mad. (p. 242).\n\nIn the introduction, Poul Anderson takes issue with those who wish to describe De Camp’s stories as “wacky.” Anderson claims they are rather the “meticulously detailed working out of the consequences of a bizarre assumption” (p. xii). Good description, but that also seems like a good definition of “wacky” to me. At any rate, I found many of De Camp’s stories downright funny.\n\nSome of de Camp’s 20th Century paperbacks\n\nDe Camp’s humor often comes out in funny one-liners as well. One example, a character named Staples is considering a dangerous animal in a story:\n\nStaples knew that the animal could run circles around him on level ground, and moreover that if he caught him he wouldn’t be satisfied to run circles around him. (p. 75)\n\nBesides his humor though, another thing that really stuck out to me about De Camp was his variety of stories. In fact, I would say that De Camp has a wider variety of stories and styles than any other volume that I’ve read thus far in this Del Rey Classic Science Fiction Series.\n\nThis volume not only gives examples of De Camp as a science fiction and fantasy writer, his “Language for Time Travelers” is also an essay on language change over time, a bit of philology. Something worth considering if you’re planning on writing a science fiction story set in the future. I don’t know anything about linguistics but I found De Camp’s essay interesting and plausible. One of my older friends actually met De Camp at a con back in the 70s and found him to be very intelligent and interesting. I think this essay does a good job of showing that.\n\nBut The Best of L. Sprague De Camp also displays other variety. “Judgment Day” was a very dark, fictional autobiography of a scientist who has either become part of building atomic weapons or something similar. It’s a depressing introspective tale about an individual with a very gloomy childhood who grows up being bitter and vindictive. De Camp says in the afterword that it is only slightly about himself, but I found myself drawn into the exploration of this dark consciousness.\n\nSo L. Sprague De Camp, love him or hate him, I don’t think it can be denied that he was a very gifted writer in the sci-fi and fantasy field, one whose storytelling skills exhibited great humor, variety and also flair. De Camp was not your typical pulp writer — at least not compared to the other authors in this Del Rey series — and this volume has encouraged me more than any other in the series to seek out the author’s work.\n\nHere’s the complete Table of Contents for The Best of L.
