A modern dystopian classic that stands alongside 1984 and Brave New World, Ira Levin’s This Perfect Day is a stunningly prescient work of science fiction that asks what it means to remain human in a world increasingly governed by technology and AI.

“Chip” (born Li RM35M4419) lives in a future controlled by an all-powerful global supercomputer, UniComp. In this seemingly utopian society, free from war and want, every aspect of human existence is meticulously planned and calibrated for efficiency by Uni, which guides the lives of each member of the Family—the eugenically-merged human race, who share a single language and religion, yet live under constant chemical conditioning and behavioral monitoring—long unaware that their sustenance comes at the expense of all individuality and autonomy. When Chip begins to question Uni’s benevolence, he embarks on a perilous journey to reclaim his true self, and challenge Uni’s rule.

Its predictions already proving unnervingly on target, This Perfect Day is a thought-provoking exploration of free will, and of who ultimately holds the reins of power. Levin’s masterful storytelling and vividly imagined world make for an epic tale that’s as unsettling as it is unforgettable.

This edition contains an afterword from Andrew Cartmel, renowned Doctor Who script editor and author of the Vinyl Detective crime novels.
