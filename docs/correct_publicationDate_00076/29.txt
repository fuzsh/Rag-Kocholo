Ira Levin

This Perfect Day

The setting for Ira Levin's This Perfect Day is a future, technocratic society ruled by a computer named UniComp. Echoing elements of both communism and extreme technological governance, this tale explores the life of Chip who begins to see cracks in the façade of the so-called utopian world. Intricately blending anti-utopian and science fiction themes, the novel reveals the harsh realities lurking beneath a façade of this oppressed society.
