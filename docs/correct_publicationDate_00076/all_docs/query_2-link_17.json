        "text": "Think about a world where utopia exists, even though we are all unique. There are distinct differences between men and women, and everyone is entitled to their opinions. You should have a say in what you think is right or wrong. In 1970, Ira Levin published This Perfect Day, which shows us how it would be if all our differences were taken away and we were made the same. Men don’t grow facial hair, and women don’t have breasts because they are given treatments that dull their minds and make them all think the way they want them to think. She shows us how the world would be if it were controlled by people who want a perfect society in which they control everything. In This Perfect Day, we see how the world would be if it were run by certain people who controlled everything we do. It begins in the year 141 of the Unification when everything is now being controlled by supercomputers. Everyone is given monthly treatments to keep them in check by Uni. These treatments do everything and even kill people when they reach the age of sixty-two by giving them too much poison in their treatments. All the members are okay with this because they just think it’s the natural way of life, but really Uni does this because they don’t want the members to live until sixty-three because they think they won’t produce anything good anymore. Christ, Marx, Wood, and Wei are the four people who supposedly made this society, so everyone also says this when they want to thank something for doing something good. They thank Uni for everything and never give credit to each other. Everyone refers to themselves as brother or sister. All the boys have the same names, which are Bob, Jesus, Karl, or Li. The girls are named Anna, Mary, Peace, or Yin, and so on. It is essential to be careful that in years to come, we don’t have a society like this where computers have control over our minds. It is not okay for a society to be like the one in this book. It is not morally right, and it isn’t healthy. A person doesn’t want to be controlled in every way. You can’t expect to run a society like this one for very long and it not fall apart. We are human beings, not some animal that you can treat like a robot. In my opinion, this book is very good at showing how utopias work. This book showed us how hard it is to make the perfect society and how hard it is to break a society like this one. Chip was the main character, and Levin did a good job showing us how he really felt from being under the spell of the Uni-Comp and how difficult it was for him to tear Uni down. I was very interested throughout the book, and I would recommend it to friends."
