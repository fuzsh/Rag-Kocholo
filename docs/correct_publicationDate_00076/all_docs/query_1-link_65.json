        "text": "'Marvellously entertaining. A cross between Brave New World and Doctor Who' Look Magazine\n\nConsidered one of the great dystopian thrillers - alongside A Clockwork Orange and Brave New World- Ira Levin's terrifying glimpse into the future continues to fascinate readers even forty years after publication.\n\nSet in a seemingly perfect global society, where uniformity is the defining feature, one man leads the resistance against UniComp - a central computer that has been programmed to keep every single human on the surface of the earth in check. All ethnic groups have been eugenically merged into a single race called 'The Family', and citizens are continually drugged so that they can never realise their potential as human beings, but will remain pliant and cooperative...\n\nWith a vision as frightening as any in the history of the science fiction genre, This Perfect Day is one of Levin's most haunting novels.\n\nBookshop\n\nOpen from Monday to Wednesday from 10:00 to 20:00\n\nThursday to Saturday from 10:00 to 21:00\n\nSunday from 12:00 to 19:00"
