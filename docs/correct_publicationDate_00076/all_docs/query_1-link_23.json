        "text": "Not Levin's best\n\nThis story was disappointing. Levin is usually an amazing writer, but this time not so much. Also, the reader uses a simple, child-like voice throughout the novel, so it's tiresome to listen to. If you wish to rrad Ira Levin, try any of his 3 other novels, that are brilliant & well read.\n\nWarning\n\nThere is a rape scene, which in 1970 would possibly not have been the horrific event it is now (and should have always been). However, I’ve chosen to skip over that short but violent scene because it’s so disturbing. I had forgotten the rape altogether when I read the book as a teenager; we were very sheltered in those decades, I don’t believe I even knew what it meant at that time.\n\nThat said, I love the story and the narrator was great! Unfortunately, the topic has become more relevant and even possible, given the world political climate.\n\nmy favorite book even as a child.\n\nI've been reading and rereading this book since I was a child. every time I read it I get even more out of the story then the last time.\n\nKevin T. Collins was great! I could listen to him for hours. He gave the right amount of emotion where it needed to be.\n\nPowerful, timely, elegant.\n\nLucid storytelling of an unusually high order, here. Relentlessly driven plot, the story hurtles forward. Philosophically challenging and emotionally engaging, the expression of the ideas here hits its targets dead center. There is pathos. There is rage. There is catharsis. There is yearning.\n\nThere is also a rape. A painstakingly described rape. A hard to read rape.\n\nEvery rape is different. Everyone is different is why. There are no rules for how rape affects people. Some forgive. Some don't; can't. Some are resilient and able to rebuild. Some are not and never do. And there are an infinite number of points in between. In this story, what follows the rape is entirely within the realm of the reality these characters have known. There are no off-notes here, not in their experience of the world. But perhaps, for some, in ours--but, and this is crucial--only for SOME in ours. Not all. Not at all. Rape really isn't something you can have a meaningful opinion about if you've not experienced it. Accept that some outcomes are not for you to understand.\n\nThis novel is fair in all of its depictions.\n\nThis novel is for adults."
