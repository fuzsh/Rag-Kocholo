        "text": "It causes a commotion when Mike Jerrick, the popular and long-running co-host of FOX 29's Good Day Philadelphia morning newscast, takes a few days off without notice.\n\nSo questions were bound to be raised since Jerrick hasn't joined Good Day Philadelphia co-host Alex Holley for a broadcast in weeks.\n\nFOX 29 recently broke its silence and assured that Jerrick is alive and well, but who is the longtime anchor and why is he so popular in the Philadelphia region?\n\nWho is 'Good Day Philadelphia' co-host Mike Jerrick?\n\nJerrick joined FOX 29 in 1999 before leaving in 2002 to work on \"Fox and Friends,\" \"DaySide\" and \"The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet,\" according to published reports.\n\nJerrick's FOX 29 biography states that Jerrick returned to \"Good Day Philadelphia\" in 2009, and remained as co-host.\n\n\"Before coming to FOX 29, Mike was managing editor and anchor on 'America Afterhours,' a live, national newsmaker and celebrity interview program on CNBC,\" read Jerrick's bio on FOX 29's website. \"He also hosted 'What's News' for the national cable television network America's Talking.\"\n\nAccording to his FOX 29 bio, Jerrick also previously hosted \"Sci-Fi Buzz\" on the Sci-Fi Channel, \"World Entertainment Report\" on HBO, and worked as a producer and writer for \"Evening Magazine\" from 1991 to 1997.\n\nJerrick is no stranger to controversy, however.\n\nPublished reports indicate FOX 29 suspended Jerrick in 2017 for using inappropriate language while talking about then-White House counselor Kellyanne Conway.\n\nJerrick also drew the ire of TV host John Oliver for Jerrick's alleged behavior during International Women's Day and mistreatment of co-workers.\n\nWhy was Mike Jerrick off 'Good Day Philadelphia'?\n\nFOX 29 revealed that Jerrick recently had a prostate cancer diagnoses and underwent surgery.\n\nJerrick, according to FOX 29, made a brief appearance on Monday's broadcast to further explain his absence.\n\n\"I wasn’t suspended, I wasn’t fired, I didn’t get into trouble, I wasn’t on a long vacation,\" Jerrick said in a light-heart fashion, according to FOX 29. \"I was getting this taken care of.\"\n\nFOX 29 also updated followers on Jerrick's condition and prognosis through a post on its X account:\n\nJerrick was diagnosed with prostate cancer in May, and opted for surgery after several consultations.\n\n\"Mike decided to go through with the procedure a few weeks ago to have his prostate robotically removed,\" read FOX 29's write-up on Jerrick's condition. \"When he woke up from surgery, he was flanked by daughters Jess and Jill, his granddaughter Teddie, and his co-host Alex Holley.\n\n\"Mike will still be off the air for a few more weeks as he recovers.\"\n\nDamon C.
