        "text": "Indeed, the novel contains one wholly-unique narrative turn which critics agree rivals any which came before it. The novel also dramatically shifts its entire POV not once, but three times, and contains myriad twists and devices that astound to this day. (Magpie Murders author Anthony Horowitz described it in 2022 as having “one of the greatest clues in a murder mystery.”)\n\nAs Levin's 1972 The Stepford Wives would also do, Kiss set its terror in broad daylight – on leafy college campuses and the environs of summertime \"Blue River\" Iowa – marking one of the many sub-genres (\"daylight horror\") Levin would help cultivate. He used his two years of matriculation at Des Moine's Drake University as a guide in modeling fictional \"Blue River,\" and it's equally-fictitional \"Stoddard University.\"\n\nLevin was drafted into the US Army just after finishing the book – he had to be granted military leave to attend the awards dinner in New York where he received his \"Best First Novel\" Edgar Award. He wrote about these unusual circumstances in a later humorous New York Times piece.\n\nThe book's original title was simply \"The Planner\"\n\nThe (published) title's been hat-tipped a surprising number of times"
