Considered one of the great dystopian novels-alongside Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World-Ira Levin's frightening glimpse into the future continues to fascinate readers even forty years after publication. The story is set in a seemingly perfect global society. Uniformity is the defining feature; there is only one language and all ethnic groups have been eugenically merged into one race called \"The Family.\" The world is ruled by a central computer called UniComp that has been programmed to keep every single human on the surface of the earth in check. People are continually drugged by means of regular injections so that they can never realize their potential as human beings, but will remain satisfied and cooperative. They are told where to live, when to eat, whom to marry, when to reproduce. Even the basic facts of nature are subject to the UniComp's will-men do not grow facial hair, women do not develop breasts, and it only rains at night. With a vision as frightening as any in the history of the science fiction genre, This Perfect Day is one of Ira Levin's most haunting novels.… (more)\n\n▾Tags\n\n▾LibraryThing Recommendations\n\n▾Member recommendations\n\n▾Will you like it?\n\nLoading...\n\nSign up for LibraryThing to find out whether you'll like this book.\n\n▾Conversations (About links)\n\n» See also 51 mentions\n\n▾Published reviews\n\n▾Other authors\n\n» Add other authors (3 possible)\n\nAuthor nameRoleType of authorWork?StatusLevin, Ira—primary authorall editionsconfirmedNiessen-Hossele, J.F.Translatorsecondary authorsome editionsconfirmedTrigell, JonathanIntroductionsecondary authorsome editionsconfirmed\n\n▾Series and work relationships\n\nBelongs to Publisher Series\n\nLanterne (L 170)\n\nZwarte Beertjes (1835)\n\nIs contained in\n\n▾Common Knowledge\n\nYou must log in to edit Common Knowledge data.\n\nFor more help see the Common Knowledge help page.\n\nCanonical title Original title Alternative titles Original publication date People/Characters Important places Important events Related movies Last words Disambiguation notice Publisher's editors Blurbers Canonical DDC/MDS Canonical LCC\n\n▾Book descriptions\n\nBy the author of Rosemary's Baby, a horrifying journey into a future only Ira Levin could imagine.
