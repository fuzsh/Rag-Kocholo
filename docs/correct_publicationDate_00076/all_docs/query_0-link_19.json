        "text": "Condition: Good. SHIPS FROM USA. Used books have different signs of use and do not include supplemental materials such as CDs, Dvds, Access Codes, charts or any other extra material. All used books might have various degrees of writing, highliting and wear and tear and possibly be an ex-library with the usual stickers and stamps. Dust Jackets are not guaranteed and when still present, they will have various degrees of tear and damage. All images are Stock Photos, not of the actual item. book.\n\nHardcover. Condition: Near Fine. Dust Jacket Condition: Near Fine. Random House, New York, NY, 1970. Hardcover. First Edition / First Printing. Book Condition: Near Fine. The very top edge of blue boards have a mild toning. Very top edge only. Top of paper block is, as common with a book this age, toned a bit more than the rest and has minor discolorations. No folds or creases to paper and the book resists opening. Stiff. White cloth spine is beautiful and the gold lettering is perfect. Hard to believe the book is almost 50 years of age. Dust Jacket Condition: Near Fine as well. Has one closed half inch tear that has practically disappeared in the Mylar jacket protector and has a mild toning to the upper whiter field of the back photo of Mr Levin. $6.95 Price intact. Again, no folds or creases. I also have the original sales receipt from Feb 21st 1970. Not that that should matter much. I doesn't effect the price at all, I just think it's kind of cool to have. The condition of this book is main reason why I got involved with it in the first place. As a collector myself, I don't like surprises. Jacket is protected in mylar cover and book placed in archival bag. If you are looking for this title in a collectible condition send a request for some photos using the \"Ask Bookseller a Question\" option. They are easy to send and well worth the few minutes it takes to do. Looks great !!!!."
