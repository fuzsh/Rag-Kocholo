        "text": "I read the unfortunate orange version but I just had to showcase some of these earlier covers!\n\nCan you spoil The Stepford Wives? I don’t think you can, but I do talk about the plot in detail.\n\nLike many people, The Stepford Wives is one of those books that I felt like I’d read but actually hadn’t – in my case, I skimmed it when I was doing some research for my PhD but never read it cover to cover. And that was a mistake, because it’s both a terrific horror novel and a fascinating glimpse into the very early days of second-wave feminism in the United States. Nowadays, the feminist activism of the early seventies may seem mild, even parochial and blinkered, to us; Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique was published in 1963, and the US National Organisation for Women (NOW), founded in 1966, but as recent popular culture takes like Mrs America (2020) show, figures like Friedan are now remembered more for their blindness to issues of race and open lesbophobia than for offering anything radical. Yet, as The Stepford Wives, first published in 1972, shows, at the time these ideas were seen as very threatening. Joanna, new to Stepford, is first convinced that something strange is going on with the other women in the town when she discovers that they used to have a branch of NOW where Betty Friedan was once an invited speaker. ‘A few years ago they were applauding Betty Friedan,’ her friend Bobbie tells her in alarm, ‘and look at them now. They’ve changed too.’\n\nEveryone knows the overt feminist message of The Stepford Wives – that women who come to this town are made into robots, losing all independent ambition and caring only about housework, childcare and sex. And Ira Levin plays this out brilliantly, as we feel Joanna’s growing dread about the fate that might await her if she stays in Stepford and yet the impossibility of uprooting her whole life because the women around her seem a bit tidier than they used to be. However, what I found most striking about Stepford is that it gets the husbands too. When Joanna arrives in Stepford with her husband Walter, she introduces herself by saying that both of them are very interested in the Women’s Liberation Movement; she’s annoyed when he joins the Stepford Men’s Association, but he tells her ‘If it’s not open to women in six months, I’ll quit and we’ll march together.’ Yet by the end of the novel, Walter is fully complicit in the plot to replace Joanna. We can theorise that he may have been drugged or hypnotised by the other men, but I think the most straightforward interpretation is also the most chilling – Walter has changed because his environment has changed. He’s the same human person he’s always been, but now he’s allowed to do things he would never have considered before.\n\nLevin even touches on themes of race with the introduction of a black character, Ruthanne, who wonders if the Stepford wives’ weirdness comes from their repressed hostility towards her and her family when she moves into the neighbourhood. (Joanna assures her that it doesn’t, but keeps tripping over the subject herself, and thinks that she’d like to send her daughter over to Ruthanne’s because ‘I’d like Kim to get to know a black family.’) But Ruthanne, it turns out, is not a tokenistic afterthought but central to the novel’s plot. She narrates its last few pages, encountering the robot version of Joanna, and the final scene between her and her husband Royal leaves the reader feeling profoundly unsettled. It’s impossible to tell from his behaviour whether Royal, too, has been sucked into the Stepford cult or whether he is just being a good husband. Will the racism of the Stepford husbands protect Ruthanne from her fate? Sadly, we last see Royal reading Lionel Tiger’s sociological classic Men In Groups (1969), which focuses on the importance of male bonding – so it looks like he’s decided where his loyalties lie… It’s not difficult to see the links between this novel and Jordan Peele’s incredible Get Out (2017), which directly acknowledges it as an inspiration."
