        "text": "American War\n\nBy Omar El Akkad,\n\nFrom my list on dystopian since “Brave New World” and “1984”.\n\nBy Mal Warwick Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nWhen I was twelve years old, my picture appeared in my hometown newspaper. I was holding a huge stack of books from the library, a week’s reading. All science fiction. I’ve read voraciously for the past seventy years—though much more widely as an adult. I’ve also had a life founding several small companies and writing twenty books. But I’ve continued to read science fiction, and, increasingly, dystopian novels. Why? Because, as a history buff, I think about the big trends that shape our lives. I see clearly that climate change, breakthroughs in technology, and unstable politics threaten our children’s future. I want to understand how these trends might play out—for better or for worse.\n\nMal's book list on dystopian since “Brave New World” and “1984”\n\nWhy did Mal love this book?\n\nThe widening partisan divide between Red and Blue in the United States today gives me nightmares.\n\nI read a lot of history, so I know how closely today’s divisions resemble those before the Civil War. Which is why Omar El Akkad’sAmerican War resonates so deeply with me.\n\nIn 2074, four Deep South states secede over the passage of new legislation banning fossil fuels—and a Southerner assassinates the President.\n\nThe Red and Blue states are now at war again. And that’s my nightmare brought to life.\n\nBy Omar El Akkad,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked American War as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA Best Book of the Year: The Guardian, The Observer, New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle and The Washington Post.\n\n2074. America's future is Civil War. Sarat's reality is survival. They took her father, they took her home, they told her lies . . .\n\nShe didn't start this war, but she'll end it.\n\nOmar El Akkad's powerful debut novel imagines a dystopian future: a second American Civil War, a devastating plague and one family caught deep in the middle. In American War, we're asked to consider what might happen if America were to turn its most devastating policies and…\n\nPreview\n\n1984\n\nBy George Orwell,\n\nFrom my list on political thrillers that are not about entertaining.\n\nBy S R Kay Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI see no distinction between the personal and the political. All art is, therefore, a political act, and literature especially, since the author gets inside the reader's head. In 1984, the use of a pen is punishable, never mind having an unorthodox opinion; novels are written by machines—commodities like jam or bootlaces, to pacify the proles. (A.I. novels outcompeting human ones?) Yes, novels entertain, and that's OK, but the best way to change your outlook is to let you understand the human condition a little better. That is why I want more from a political thriller than just the same old lies, corruption, sex, and power at the heart of government.\n\nS's book list on political thrillers that are not about entertaining\n\nWhy did S love this book?\n\nI keep returning to this and reading different things into it every time. As with Little Man, this is not the West Wing/Thick of It classic political thriller, but it is told from the perspective of an ordinary Joe. Unlike Little Man, where the political message is woven in seamlessly, 1984 is a full-on polemic written by a man with little time left in an attempt to shape opinion. It is, though, well-plotted and hangs together really well as a novel (barring the sections where Smith reads from the book).\n\nOften read as an anti-communist allegory, I see it as so much more: sending us a warning against all who think only they are right, seeking to impose their will on others, be they autocrats like Putin, Trump, Xi Jinping, or Farage.\n\nBy George Orwell,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n46 authors picked 1984 as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nBIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU . . .\n\n1984 is the year in which it happens. The world is divided into three superstates. In Oceania, the Party's power is absolute. Every action, word, gesture and thought is monitored under the watchful eye of Big Brother and the Thought Police. In the Ministry of Truth, the Party's department for propaganda, Winston Smith's job is to edit the past. Over time, the impulse to escape the machine and live independently takes hold of him and he embarks on a secret and forbidden love affair.

I was holding a huge stack of books from the library, a week’s reading. All science fiction. I’ve read voraciously for the past seventy years—though much more widely as an adult. I’ve also had a life founding several small companies and writing twenty books. But I’ve continued to read science fiction, and, increasingly, dystopian novels. Why? Because, as a history buff, I think about the big trends that shape our lives. I see clearly that climate change, breakthroughs in technology, and unstable politics threaten our children’s future. I want to understand how these trends might play out—for better or for worse.\n\nMal's book list on dystopian since “Brave New World” and “1984”\n\nWhy did Mal love this book?\n\nClimate change aside, what scares me the most about technology today is the capacity for bioengineering to run amok.\n\nWhat happens when scientists monkey around with deadly viruses—and one escapes from the lab? What if some rogue researcher creates an entirely new lifeform that proves toxic to humans? Or some experimental microbe—an effort to save the world’s butterflies, for instance—proves to kill off bees instead?\n\nThis novel, which won major awards, depicts a frightening future world wrought by bioengineering. And you wouldn’t want to live there anymore than I do.\n\nBy Paolo Bacigalupi,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n6 authors picked The Windup Girl as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWINNER OF THE HUGO, NEBULA, LOCUS, JOHN W. CAMPBELL AND COMPTON CROOK AWARDS\n\nThe Windup Girl is the ground-breaking and visionary modern classic that swept the board for every major science fiction award it its year of publication.\n\nAnderson Lake is a company man, AgriGen's calorie representative in Thailand. Under cover as a factory manager, he combs Bangkok's street markets in search of foodstuffs long thought to be extinct. There he meets the windup girl - the beautiful and enigmatic Emiko - now abandoned to the slums.

In 2011, I began an MA in Literature and Environment with this question weighing on my mind. I finished my degree two years later with a draft of my debut novel, Under This Forgetful Sky. I’ve come to understand the climate crisis, in many ways, as a crisis of imagination. Its enormity tests the limits of the imaginable. What if the world as we know it ends? What would life look like on the other side? The books on this list reckon with the fears these questions bring while also gesturing beautifully, unsentimentally, courageously toward hope.\n\nLauren's book list on seeking hope after the end of the world\n\nWhy did Lauren love this book?\n\nThis book is light on hope, but if you’re on the hunt for cli-fi dystopias, Oryx and Crake is a must-read.\n\nThe novel’s protagonist, Snowman (previously known as Jimmy), finds himself alone (sort of) after a global societal collapse. His story unfolds on either side of this collapse as he searches for answers about what has happened to the world and why.\n\nThis book brings together runaway climate change, an apocalyptic pandemic, uncontrolled genetic engineering, mass extinction, and more, dealing with nostalgia for what’s been lost and reckoning with each person’s individual culpability for that loss. And yet it somehow manages to also be a thrilling puzzle box of a story that ends on a note of cautious hope.\n\nBy Margaret Atwood,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n8 authors picked Oryx and Crake as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nBy the author of THE HANDMAID'S TALE and ALIAS GRACE\n\n*\n\nPigs might not fly but they are strangely altered. So, for that matter, are wolves and racoons. A man, once named Jimmy, lives in a tree, wrapped in old bedsheets, now calls himself Snowman. The voice of Oryx, the woman he loved, teasingly haunts him. And the green-eyed Children of Crake are, for some reason, his responsibility.\n\n*\n\nPraise for Oryx and Crake:\n\n'In Jimmy, Atwood has created a great character: a tragic-comic artist of the future, part buffoon, part Orpheus. An adman who's a sad man; a jealous…\n\nPreview\n\nMake Room! Make Room!\n\nBy Harry Harrison,\n\nFrom my list on dystopian sci-fi that are dear to my heart.\n\nBy Prentis Rollins Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve been hooked on science fiction since I saw Westworld in its first run in 1973, at age 7 (it’s the first movie I saw in a theatre). I started drawing my own sci-fi comics at age 11, when the first Star Wars came out, and kept it up through adolescence. Eventually, my love of sci-fi led me to a passion for philosophy, which I majored in in college. And the philosophy I learned has since informed my later choices in sci-fi reading, and even more my sci-fi writing and illustration. The books I talk about below are very dear to my heart—I’m sure you won’t regret checking them out.\n\nPrentis' book list on dystopian sci-fi that are dear to my heart\n\nWhy did Prentis love this book?\n\nWritten in 1966, Make Room! Make Room! was the basis for the 1973 film Soylent Green—it’s one of those great books that (like The Exorcist) was totally overshadowed by its equally great film version. It’s set in 1999, in a grossly overpopulated and polluted world in which people are scrambling for ever-diminishing resources. It mainly follows the life of NYC detective Andy Rusch and his elderly roommate Sol—who has finagled a bicycle-powered generator to run the TV and refrigerator in their small apartment. Rusch falls in love with Shirl, the young mistress of a rich man whose murder Rusch is investigating, but Shirl dumps him when she realizes she has better options with the rich rather than the poor.\n\nMake Room! Make Room! is a cautionary tale about unchecked population, and it’s driven not so much by plot as by what Harry Harrison had on his mind: pollution,…\n\nBy Harry Harrison,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Make Room! Make Room! as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA gangster is murdered during a blistering Manhattan heat wave. City cop Andy Rusch is under pressure solve the crime and captivated by the victim's beautiful girlfriend. But it is difficult to catch a killer, let alone get the girl, in crazy streets crammed full of people. The planet's population has exploded. The 35 million inhabitants of New York City run their TVs off pedal power, riot for water, loot and trample for lentil 'steaks' and are controlled by sinister barbed wire dropped from the sky.\n\nWritten in 1966 and set in 1999, Make Room!

Aldiss,\n\nFrom my list on dystopian sci-fi that are dear to my heart.\n\nBy Prentis Rollins Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve been hooked on science fiction since I saw Westworld in its first run in 1973, at age 7 (it’s the first movie I saw in a theatre). I started drawing my own sci-fi comics at age 11, when the first Star Wars came out, and kept it up through adolescence.

And the philosophy I learned has since informed my later choices in sci-fi reading, and even more my sci-fi writing and illustration. The books I talk about below are very dear to my heart—I’m sure you won’t regret checking them out.\n\nPrentis' book list on dystopian sci-fi that are dear to my heart\n\nWhy did Prentis love this book?\n\nLate in the 20th Century, an ‘accident’ occurred whereby nuclear bombs detonated in orbit above earth—the resulting radiation has rendered mankind sterile. Algy Timberlane—aka ‘Greybeard’—is in his mid-50’s, a veritable stripling in an increasingly geriatric world. He, his wife Martha, and a few aging friends set off on an odyssey down the river Thames, to explore what’s left of their crumbling, dying world—and maybe find some spark of hope for the future.\n\nGreybeard is a marvel to behold. It’s one of the few books that’s not only about the hideous injustices of growing old, but also about a world that’s grown old and is facing death. What would people do if they knew that theirs was literally the last generation, that there would be no one to carry on their work? It’s an unsettling question to wrap your mind around—but Greybeard faces it without flinching, and with moving, thought-provoking…\n\nBy Brian W. Aldiss,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Greybeard as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nHuman reproduction has ceased and society slowly spirals in this “adult Lord of the Flies” by a Grand Master of Science Fiction (San Francisco Chronicle).\n\nAfter the “Accident,” all males on Earth become sterile. Society ages and falls apart bit by bit. First, toy companies go under. Then record companies. Then cities cease to function. Now Earth’s population lives in spread‑out, isolated villages, with its youngest members in their fifties. When the people of Sparcot begin to make claims of gnomes and man‑eating rodents lurking around their village, Greybeard and his wife set out for the coast with the hope…\n\nPreview\n\nIt Can't Happen Here\n\nBy Sinclair Lewis,\n\nWhy did Elizabeth love this book?\n\nThis book imagines a world where the United States succumbs to authoritarianism. Subsequent writers have explored this theme, but I love Lewis’s novel because it captures a precarious historical moment (the 1930s) that has a lot in common with the present day.\n\n“Buzz” Winthrop, the politician turned dictator, whips up fears about threats to America, stressing the need to get back to the nation’s “true” values. It’s a chilling portrait of a nation that loses its way.\n\nBy Sinclair Lewis,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n5 authors picked It Can't Happen Here as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n“The novel that foreshadowed Donald Trump’s authoritarian appeal.”—Salon\n\nIt Can’t Happen Here is the only one of Sinclair Lewis’s later novels to match the power of Main Street, Babbitt, and Arrowsmith. A cautionary tale about the fragility of democracy, it is an alarming, eerily timeless look at how fascism could take hold in America.\n\nWritten during the Great Depression, when the country was largely oblivious to Hitler’s aggression, it juxtaposes sharp political satire with the chillingly realistic rise of a president who becomes a dictator to save the nation from welfare cheats, sex, crime, and a liberal press.\n\nCalled “a…\n\nPreview\n\nFeed\n\nBy M.T. Anderson,\n\nWhy did Mal love this book?\n\nI’m troubled by the way young people today seem to live their lives glued to smartphone and computer screens.\n\nM. T. Anderson gives us a hint of what this might lead to in Feed. It’s one of the scariest books I've read in many years. The six teenagers partying in this novel live in a world of constant distractions. Fashions may change by the hour.\n\nA powerful future version of Virtual Reality allows them to experience novelty and excitement at any time without special equipment—and without pausing for reflection.\n\nAnd that’s how they live, closed off from life in the real world. As I said, scary.\n\nBy M.T. Anderson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Feed as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 14, 15, 16, and 17.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIdentity crises, consumerism, and star-crossed teenage love in a futuristic society where people connect to the Internet via feeds implanted in their brains. Winner of the LA Times Book Prize.\n\nFor Titus and his friends, it started out like any ordinary trip to the moon - a chance to party during spring break and play around with some stupid low-grav at the Ricochet Lounge. But that was before the crazy hacker caused all their feeds to malfunction, sending them to the hospital to lie around with nothing inside their heads for days. And it was before Titus met Violet, a…\n\nPreview\n\nWalkaway\n\nBy Cory Doctorow,\n\nWhy did Sandra love this book?\n\nDoctorow and I had a mutual friend in common—the incredible Possum who organized Toronto’s Anarchist Free University for many years until his early demise, Rest in Power—full disclosure, and that’s how I started reading his fiction. Walkaway is one of my favorites. This is a world where 3D printers have changed everything. People who are poor, exploited, unhappy, or maybe just feeling adventurous can—and do—walk away from the capitalist world within the city walls and live quite literally on the fringes, using 3D printers and their imaginations of a world without exploitation to construct whole new societies. Can they successfully build a utopia despite the many conflicts that arise? Who knows? But I do know I’m hoping for a sequel.\n\nBy Cory Doctorow,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Walkaway as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn a world wrecked by climate change, in a society owned by the ultra-rich, in a city hollowed out by industrial flight, Hubert, Etc, Seth and Natalie have nowhere else to be and nothing better to do.\n\nBut there is another way. After all, now that anyone can design and print the basic necessities of life - food, clothing, shelter - from a computer, there is little reason to toil within the system. So, like thousands of others in the mid-21st century, the three of them turn their back on the world of rules, jobs, the morning commute and... walkaway.…\n\nPreview"
