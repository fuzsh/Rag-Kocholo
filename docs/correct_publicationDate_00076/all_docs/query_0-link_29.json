All the nations are now controlled by a giant computer, hidden under the Alps. The human ones are programmed from the time of their birth - at least those who were authorized to be born - and are regularly treated by drugs which immunize them against diseases, but also against initiative and curiosity. There are, however, rebels. One of them, named Chip, will rediscover the prohibited feelings and especially love. He becomes involved in a desperate fight against this too-perfect world, inhuman, which grants, certainly, happiness for all but a happiness which becomes unbearable because it is imposed."
