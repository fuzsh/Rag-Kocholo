        "text": "Ira Levin, who died on Monday aged 78, was the author of some of the best-selling suspense novels of the 20th century, among them Rosemary's Baby, The Stepford Wives and The Boys From Brazil.\n\nLevin was once described as \"the finest hack writer in America\". It was a tag to which he took objection, but one that was largely accurate.\n\nHe was a master of ingenious plotting and of maintaining tension, but though possessed of more literary skill than most successful authors of blockbusters, his novels were undeniably driven by premise and situation rather than by character or emotion.\n\nPerhaps for this reason many of his books translated well to the screen, adding a lustre to his reputation that was not wholly merited by the original works. The one exception to this was his first novel, A Kiss Before Dying (1953), which in both technical skill and psychological complexity holds its own as a masterpiece of the thriller genre.\n\nWritten when Levin was only 22, it is the story of a university student who murders his girlfriend (disguising it as suicide) because he fears that her father, a copper magnate, will disinherit her because she has fallen pregnant, and he has no wish to marry a pauper.\n\nThe brilliance of the book lies in its structure. The lengthy opening section, narrated from the standpoint of the killer, establishes him as a character both credible and disturbingly sympathetic.\n\nBut by not revealing any details of his identity, Levin keeps the reader on tenterhooks in the remainder of novel, told from the perspective of the girl's sisters as they begin to investigate her death and encounter several men to whom they are attracted, but each of whom may be the murderer.\n\nIra Levin was born in New York City on August 27 1929. He grew up first in the Bronx, but as his father's toy importing business prospered the family moved to the Upper West Side of Manhattan.\n\nIra was educated at Horace Mann school, where he acquired a taste for mystery novels, and at Drake University, Des Moines, Iowa, where he majored in English and Philosophy.\n\nHis father then expected him to join him in the toy business, but Ira had other ideas. Instead he enrolled at New York University to take a course in screenwriting. His father agreed to fund him while he wrote A Kiss Before Dying between classes, and Levin also managed to sell scripts to television series.\n\nSomewhat perversely, given the acclaim that had greeted his first novel, Levin spent most of the next decade trying - and failing - to prove that he was actually a playwright.\n\nFrom 1953 to 1955 he did his service in the US Army, an experience that helped him adapt for the stage Mac Hyman's comedy of military life No Time for Sergeants. This enjoyed almost 800 performances on Broadway (and ran in the West End in 1956), but Levin's subsequent theatrical outings found favour with neither the critics nor audiences.\n\nInterlock (1958), a melodrama, closed after four performances; General Seeger (1962) after two; and Doctor Cook's Garden (1967) after eight. A musical, Drat! The Cat (1965), which Levin had been working on for 10 years, survived for a week, although one song he had written for it, He Touched Me, became a standard for Barbra Streisand.\n\nHis series of failures persuaded Levin in 1967 to start work on a second novel, in part inspired by his wife's pregnancy. Rosemary's Baby is the everyday tale of a young wife who comes to believe that her neighbours are witches and that the child she is carrying is the spawn of the Devil, who has impregnated her in the guise of her husband.\n\nThe success of the book, which went on to sell some five million copies in the United States, was in no small part helped by Roman Polanski's taut and evocative film of the novel. Made in 1968, it starred Mia Farrow and was shot in the Dakota Building in New York.\n\nThe book and the film started a Satanic literary trend that persisted well into the 1970s, yielding such fare as The Omen and The Exorcist.\n\nLevin's next novel, This Perfect Day (1970), a Huxleyan story of a future controlled by technocrats, was something of a damp squib, but in 1972 he again hit the jackpot with The Stepford Wives.\n\nDrawing on five years he had spent living in a small town in Connecticut, Levin once more played on fears of the future whilst also making use of a more contemporary issue, the advance of feminism. Taking this to extremes, the novel has the men of a dormitory suburb stamp out any signs of independence in their wives by replacing them with identical, sexually compliant robots.\n\nSome critics believed that the book was a satire on men's worries about female emancipation. Most, however, noted that Levin now seemed virtually to be writing for the screen, with the literary overtones of his first novel and the sense of place of his second sacrificed for an admittedly exciting plotline.\n\nThe book, rather improved by William Goldman's script, was filmed by Bryan Forbes, with Katharine Ross in the lead role, in 1974.\n\nTechnology was also the spur for Levin's next success, The Boys From Brazil (1976), in which the Nazi geneticist Josef Mengele tries to replicate Adolf Hitler in the form of 94 embryos cloned from the FÃ¼hrer and placed with families all over the world.\n\nThe book was again made into a film, starring (implausibly) Gregory Peck as Mengele and Laurence Olivier as the Nazi hunter pitted against him.\n\nThis cleverly plotted drama turned on the notion of a once-successful playwright planning to kill a younger rival and steal his idea for a hit. It reminded many critics of Anthony Shaffer's Sleuth, and like that play it worked better on stage than when filmed, in 1982, with Michael Caine (who had also appeared in the screen version of Sleuth).\n\nLevin said that he preferred writing for the stage because, unlike with a book, he could witness the audience's reaction.\n\nAs a novelist, he worked slowly, never writing more than 500 words a day, and then only, he once remarked, \"when I'm really excited about what I'm doing\".\n\nA film version, starring Sharon Stone, was disavowed by Levin, who when not writing liked to play the piano in his Park Avenue apartment, and to watch his neighbours through a giant telescope."
