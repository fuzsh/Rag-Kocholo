        "text": "Tanaka Jun, Touching the Past: Historical Experience, Photography, Suspense Foreword \" Touching the Past \" —I thought that I would begin this book based on the feeling of definitely having had such an experience. This book focuses on events with a connection to the past, especially through photographs, to clarify these \" historical experiences. \" It also investigates an ideal form of a historical narrative that conveys these experiences within a principle of \" suspense. \" The text presented in the introduction of this book was written at the time of the Tohoku earthquake and Fukushima nuclear incident in March 2011 before I directly took up the theme of historical experiences. This is because it was a dangerous moment wherein there were encounters with historical images. At this time, when there was contact with surrounding disaster and imminent danger and five senses became completely and abnormally sharpened, a sense of history that attempted to understand the various signs of the past was also sharpened. The historical experiences that this book attempts to problematize are sensory experiences felt through the body and not through information or understanding. In that sense, the discovery of special sensations and knowledge made possible because of being under dangerous circumstances that are presented in the introduction, especially the historical views in Hotta Yoshie's Hōjōki Shiki (A Personal Note on Hōjōki) reported in Chapter 1 and the theme of \" hope \" discussed in accordance with Walter Benjamin in Chapter 4, announce the entire argument of this book as a sort of \" forewarning. \" Part I of the book is devoted to theories of historical experience and individual case studies. Chapter 1 investigates the historical narratives of Johan Huizinga and Aby Warburg and their relations with historical experiences. Discussions of historical experiences in current historical theory are also pursued. The work of self-analysis based on my personal experiences cannot be avoided given the nature of the matter at hand. My initial motivation in writing this book was because of the experience that I had in archives that I repeatedly visited as it was necessary for my research on the history of ideas. Chapter 2 is a record of the search for \" Asia, \" a mysterious woman who appears in the journal and letters of Gilbert Clavel (who is the protagonist of my book Gilbert Clavel: Architect of the Chthonic, which was born out of such comings and goings through an archive). While this is a reasoning process and an investigation that searches for the answer to the question \" Who is Asia?, \" at the same time, it is a journey through historical experiences that studies firsthand the process required to understand the past. Chapters 3 and 4 report the historical experiences of the historian of thought Hashikawa Bunso and the architect Daniel Libeskind, respectively. Because they are the figures who serve as guides, as I have pursued my research on political imagination and modern and contemporary architectural discussions, the investigations in these two chapters search for experiences that were the root of their philosophy. In this book, the target when dealing with experiences that \" touch the past, \" especially in focused investigations, is photographs. This is because photographs strongly define historical experiences since the mid-19th century as objects that directly prove the reality of the past. However, the value of photographs as historical materials has not necessarily been recognized in historical research because photographs too directly display the past, and thus, they could not be easily incorporated into the historical discourse. In Part II of the book, I analyze five photographs of the blast zone clicked by Matsushige Yoshito on August 6 th , 1945, the day when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima; I also analyze four photographs secretly clicked by a Sonderkommando at the second concentration camp at Auschwitz (Birkenau). All these photographs were clicked under extreme circumstances; thus, I focus the discussion on the possibility of getting close to places of liminal experiences through photography and ethical problems that are entailed. The former takes the form of a study on the discussion in Images in Spite of All: Four Photographs from Auschwitz by Georges Didi-Huberman."
