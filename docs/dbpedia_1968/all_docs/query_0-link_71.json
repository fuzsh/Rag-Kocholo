Your nearsightedness is cured in this way. The distinction between genuine near- sightedness and pseudo-nersightedness is only a matter of degrees. Dr. Seizaburo Tagawa attracted the general attention of the ophthalmological circles when he announced the famoust heory, supported by abundant clinical data, that 95 per- cent of acquired nearsightedness can be cured. Tokyo Ophthalmological Labora- tory (Myopic Research Center) has launched into the investigation of curing nearsightedness based on Dr. Tagawa's theory, and has already achieved notable results. iV -^r tV ir For More Detailed Information. '>^ i^ ^ ^ Already a considerable number of people has recovered the healthy sight throught the treatment of Toyo Ophthalmological Laboratory. For example, all nearlighted students of Nissei Gakuen High School in Mie Prefecture are receiving the treatment of our laboratory. One person has improved his visual power from 0.1 to LO and has suc- cessfully passed the examination of pilot. This therapy is proving especially effective in the treatment of slight nearsightedness in young girls. This is indeed a good news to the girls fettered with near- sightedness.

Gordon K. Chapman, this year's Editorial Committee has decided to con- tinue the format of a central theme. In doing so we hope to focus discussion on relevant issues facing Christians in Japan today. This year's theme has a 2-pronged attack: one on Christians in Political Encounter as found in Part II, and one on Christians in Secular Encounter as presented in Part III. In Part II Editor Roderick Dugliss distills for us current thinking by a large number of Japanese Christians on such controversial subjects as China, Vietnam, Elections, Kigen- setsu (National Founders Day), and University Politics. In Part III Editor Stanley L. Manierre has collected a formidable number of essays describing new ministries which are taking the Gospel to the man in the street. I think your imagination will be stirred by much of what you read there. When Mrs. Betty Wedel informed me that she and her family spent over 150 hours compiling this year's Directory Section I could only thank God for such devoted laborers in his Vineyard. The same might be said for Miss Patricia Patterson who has compiled the first index to be printed in the pages of this Yearbook. We know it will be tremendous value to all who study the Christian movement in this great land. It was in 1905 that Dr. A.J. Stirewalt first came to Japan. This Yearbook is ever indebted to him for his faithfulness in compiling the annual Necrology report. Our thanks go out to all who have taken time to contri- bute articles to this 56th edition of the Japan Christian Year- book. I would also like to express my appreciation for the op- portunity of serving as editor-in-chief for this edition. The experience has been meaningful for me in many ways. I especially want to thank Dr. Chuzo Yamada and Rev. Stanley Manierre for their patience and help. The views found herein are not necessarily the views of the editor-in-chief. We trust you will find this edition of the Yearbook up to your expectations, and that the addition of pictures will enhance your interest. Paul L.

Winemiller \"I hope that this year will see peace restored in Vietnam and a deepening fellowship between Koreans and Japanese. I also call on my fellow Japanese Christians to remember that while involvement in political matters is natural and impor- tant, there is a need to remember that \"soul winning\" is still the main task of the church.\" So spoke Rev. Takeshi Muto, president of the weekly Kirisuto Shimbun, as he joined other church leaders in expressing their hopes for the Year of Our Lord 1966. It is no accident that I have chosen the above quote to lead off this narrative concerning highlights in Christian Activity in 1966. It was on February 7th that the Japan Christian Council for Peace in Vietnam lodged a strong protest with the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the U.S.A. con- cerning its December 3, 1965 statement on Vietnam. Crux of the issue was the Japanese group's opinion that the war is a civil war rather than a conflict precipitated by North Viet- namese invasion. America's refusal to admit this civil char- acter in the conflict was seen by the peace group as an ob- struction to peaceful settlement of the war. The National Council of Church's Interchurch Aid and Service Division, which was recognized as a full commission of the NCC in 1966, led a magnificent drive which netted 2,800,000 yen for famine relief in hunger-stricken India. Com- ing from parishes, Christian Schools, and universities the amount was way over the 2 million yen goal set during the 2 1966 IN REVIEW NCC's Annual Meeting in February. Early in the year Christians raised their voices in protest to the government over the reestablishment of Kigensetsu or National Founding Day. Many feared it would bring a re- turn to the militarism of pre- World War II days. They saw it as a continuation of the Kigensetsu myth, which avows that the Emparor Jimmu assumed power as the first Emperor of Japan 2,627 years ago. The bill to establish the new holiday was supported by Prime Minister Eisaku Sato and his ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Although shelved seven times since it was first introduced in 1957 public opinion polls showed that more people were for its restoration than against it. A noteworthy event was the winning of a national literary contest by a United Church of Christ laywoman, Mrs. Ayako Miura, on the theme of Original Sin. In accepting the 10 million yen prize Mrs. Miura apologized for her novel called The Freezing Point, because \"I couldn't express well enough what 'original sin' is. ... I meant to present the people of sin who cannot face God\". Her novel was carried in serial form on the front page of one of Japan's leading daily newspapers. Japanese Baptist pastors and laymen met at Amagi Bap- tist Assembly on the Izu Peninsula, June 1-3, to prepare for an October evangelistic campaign which would be led by Japa- nese pastors and missionaries in 60 churches throughout the land. Musicians and laymen from America joined in the Oc- tober meetings. Plans for a $1 Million cathedral to be constructed in To- kyo were completed by the Nippon Seiko Kai (Japan Epis- copal Church). Czech-born Antonin Raymond, one-time as- sociate of the celebrated Frank Lloyd Wright, is architect of the new Cathedral, which is scheduled for groundbreaking in 1967. \"Expose yourselves without security measures to new ex- periences and new ideologies.\" These were the marching orders posted by German theologian Hans Margull to dele- gates assembled in Kyoto May 18-25 for the East Asian i&66 IN REVIEW 3 Christian Council's Industrial Seminar on the role of the Christian in Industry today. The first such conference in the Area in 8 years, the 43 delegates and 25 observers from 14 East Asian and 4 Western nations returned home with few- conclusions but a deeper need for continuing fellowship in this pioneering area of evangelism. A highlight of the year was the first Japan-NCC Joint Missionary Orientation Conference held at Atami's Sagamiya Hotel on September 5. 85 new missionaries of the Anglican, Baptist Union, Baptist Convention (Southern), Evangelical Lutheran, Korea Christian, and United Church (Kyodan) Churches participated in the conference which featured in- sights into Japanese Ways of Thought, the Japanese Economy and Labor Movement, and the Japanese Social Structure. A dramatic program led by Program Chairman Yoichiro Saeki, and lectures by 3 Tokyo University professors highlighted the 2 day meeting. The 14th General Assembly of the United Church of Christ in Japan was held in Osaka on October 21-26. Besides cele- brating the 25th anniversary of its founding, the Convention elected a new slate of officers headed by moderator Masahisa Suzuki, former chairman of the church's evangelism depart- ment and pastor of Tokyo's Nishikatamachi congregation. Upon election he announced as his aims the development of more imaginative forms of evangelism, protection of Japan's \"Peace\" Constitution, withdrawal of American forces from South and East Asia, and enlargement of Kyodan self-sup- port. More than 1,000 members of the Japan Evangelical Lutheran Church met in Meiji Park, Tokyo, to close a two- year campaign aimed at deepening the devotional life and fidelity to the mission of the Church. The 3-day meeting in August capped a long period in which congregations studied the Gospel of John and devised plans to more effectively in- volve lay people in the mission of the Church. Under the theme, \"We Stand On The Word\", the program was closed with 4 1966 IN REVIEW addresses by lay speakers representing Lutheran Churches throughout the land. The Christian Kindergarten Union held a conference on November 7 at Tokyo with 30 teachers from 13 Asian coun- tries in attendance. The meeting marked the 80th anniversary of the founding of Japan's first kindergarten. Christian women of Asia met at Tokyo's International Christian University in July for extended conversations on the subject \"Lay Women in Home, Church, Society, and the World.\" Hosts to the more than 90 delegates and observers for the 11-day conference was the Japanese delegation led by Mrs. Masae Harada, a lay leader of the United Church of Christ in Japan. Ecumenism reached a new peak during the year with the initiation of talks between the Kyodan and Japan's Catholic communion. The Week of Prayer for Christian Unity was also a feature of the year's ecumenical activities, and publica- tion of a joint pamphlet for this week by NCC-Japan and the Roman Catholic Church brought a new dimension of cooperation into the movement. Establishment of Pulpit and Altar Fellowship between the Japan Mission of the Lutheran Church (Missouri Synod) and the Japan Evangelical Lutheran Church was a highlight of Lutheran Ecumenical relations during the year. From England came the Director of MRI (Mutual Re- sponsibility and Interdependence), Bishop Dean, to discuss mutual projects of inter-church aid with the leaders of the Seikokai, (Japan Episcopal Church.) In the Japan Korean Church a committee was formed to investigate merger possibilities with the Kyodan. AVACO announced plans for the building of a New Mass Communications Center in Tokyo with completion date scheduled for 196'J. The XCC-Japan related Protestant Publishing Company set up a wholesale clearing house for books of all Christian denominational publishing firms in Japan. The purpose is to 1966 IN REVIEW 5 provide a central channel for distribution of Christian books to both secular and Christian bookstores throughout Japan. The Japan Bible Society distributed 4,180,000 copies of Scripture between November 1965 and October 1966, accord- ing to a statement by Bible Society General Secretary, Shunzo Miyauchi. Distribution of the Old Testament is growing particularly fast, as schools which once used only The New Testament now require both sacred books. Gifts totalling more than 1 million yen were received through Church World Service from abroad to aid victims of ** Typhoon Ida,\" which struck Yamanashi Prefecture in the Autumn. Japanese Christians also contributed to the fund which provided bedding for many homeless people. A statement on \"The Ideal Japanese\" stirred deep Chris- tian concern when the statement's release by the government — controlled Central Education Council came out in the Fall. The Statement, exhorting secondary educators to Inculcate moral values and respect for The Emperor, raised immediate fears in the minds of most Christian leaders of revival of the pre-war \"Imperial Rescript on Education\" — a document which had been used to force intellectual conformity to the old im- perialism. These are the highlights of the Church in Japan in the year of our Lord 1966. PART II CHRISTIANS IN POLITICAL ENCOUNTER Edit., Roderick B. Dugliss INTRODUCTION \"If you want to keep the discussion friendly, best not talk about religion or politics.\" In spite of this timeless warn- ing, each year's Japan Christian Yearbook invites its readers to consider both of these proverbially touchy topics, and, indeed, compounds the felony by considering them together — religion and politics. Rather than violating the rules of polite discourse, however, the editors feel that this is a necessary and proper function of this yearbook. The topics are touchy because they are of interest, and command the attention of all, expert and layman alike. Therefore, even if a few toes are trod on, or some sensibilities ruffled, the desired result is that the reader gain some understanding of how this vital area of life is considered in Japan, and for this year, by Christians in Japan. There are endless questions that could be raised under this heading, so that pressures of space and time have limited the topics to four — two dealing with problems of foreign affairs, and two that treat immediate political issues within Japan. China and Japan have long been linked geographically and culturally but since the end of the Pacific War and the success of the Chinese Revolution the two countries have taken markedly different political and economic paths. Though the ideological gap is wide, there are other ties which INTRODUCTION 7 seem to span it. As a result, the issue of China is never very far away in any political or economic question that one raises in Japan. How would a Christian assess the impact of the China issue on Japan? The yearbook is fortunate to have had an interview with Mr. Yutaka Shishido, active lay mem- ber of the Kyodan and Foreign News Editor of the Kyodo News Service. M^- Shishido is in a unique position to com- ment on China for he is an \"old China hand.\" Drawing on his background he has some particularly penetrating com- ments on the ideological nature of the present \"Great Cul- tural Revolution\" that disturbs life on the Mainland. The most intense and controversial international issue of the past year has been the war in Vietnam. The United States, vitally involved in that country, has always counted Japan as one of her chief allies in Asia. The very cool official stance of the Japanese government, and the overt criticism of her people toward the war, and particularly the U.S. role in it has been a source of concern to many Amer- icans. The critics are not merely a vocal minority; poll data shows that a majority of the people are to some degree critical, and Christians in Japan are no less concerned. Dr. Keiji Ogawa, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Tokyo Woman's Christian College reports on the activities of the Japanese Christian Council for Peace in Vietnam. Although his comments are limited to the work of this one group, the opinions expressed, and the reasons given for them are a good index to why and how many Japanese Christians hold the views they do as regards Vietnam. One may not neces- sarily agree with the points made by Prof. Ogawa, but they cannot be dismissed as merely the opinion of one man. In reporting the thought of the council, he reflects attitudes that are widely shared. Regular readers of the Japan Christian Yearbook have £een a great deal about the International Christian University in these pages through the years. Some may feel that in- ordinate attention has been paid to this one Christian uni- 8 POLITICAL ENCOUNTER versity to the neglect of other, older schools and programs that a number of Christian groups have initiated and carried on. Too, there might be a question raised about the ap- pearence of an article on I.C.U. in a section of the yearbook devoted to contemporary political problems. However, as Mr. Bruce Roberts vividly relates, the university has, in 1966 and 1967, undergone a crisis which, though educational in im- pact, has been clearly related to politics. It has also shaken the institution to its very foundations. As one who observed much of what Mr. Roberts discusses, I can assure you that he does not exaggerate. \"Student problems\" are part and parcel of Japanese higher education, but the problems faced by I.C.U. are of such a nature that they deserve serious consideration by all Christians who are concerned with the conflicts of ideology and the general problems of living the faith in today's political arena. For these readers, as well as those who have a special interest in this institution be- cause of the experiments it has tried, Mr. Roberts has been given ample space to develop questions for Christians con- cerned with political issues. The final article looks at three events that were very much in the news this past year; two elections, and the in- stitution of National Foundation Day (Kenkokukinenbi) . In each instance there are points relating to religious and Christian involvement in political questions. Neither the specific articles nor the section as whole claim to be exhaustive. It is hoped, however, that insights can be gained and perhaps even something more than polite discus- sion will be inspired. CHAPTER 1 CHINA Based on an intervieiv with Yutaka Shishido Mainland China looms large in the politics of South and East Asia. Its history and culture, its population and geo- graphical expanse all mark China as a potentially great power in Asia, yet because of an isolation which is imposed both from within and without China is directly a political concern of only a few Asian nations. Japan has always been geographically and historically close to China, but since the end of the Second World War Japan has joined those nations which concentrate their overt international politics in other areas while always, as it were, looking over their shoulders toward the \"Middle Kingdom.\" One of the by-products of this pattern of international politics in Asia has been the emergence of a species of scholarly or journalistic bird known as the \"China Watcher.\" A bird of no common plumage, it is most often found in flocks on the borders of Mainland China, peering intently toward the interior. It is also full of questions for those who might possess any firsthand knowledge of persons or events on the Mainland. The usual habitat for these individuals has been Hong Kong, where there is constant movement going on in and out of China. In the past year, however, a significant shift has taken place, and suddenly Tokyo found itself in first place. The cause of this shift was twofold. China became embroiled in an extremely confusing \"Cultural Revolution\" which worked itself out on the walls and in the streets of the ;j^0 POLITICAL ENCOUNTER capital, Peking. Primary among those able to observe this great up-heaval in China were Japanese correspondents who, because of cultural and racial affinifies with the Chinese were able to move more freely and understand more accurately than were the handful of Western reporters permitted in Peking. News reports from Japanese correspondents became the basic source for the China watchers, reports which are still scanned eagerly day by day to find clues as to what exactly is going on in the world's most populous country. Mr. Yutaka Shishido, Foreign News Editor for Kyodo News Service combines the qualities of an active Christian layman and a China expert, and was kind enough to spare some of his valuable time in order to share with the editor and the readers of the Yearbook some of his observations on the concerns of Japanese Christians with the problems posed by Mainland China. Mr. Shishido was the first Japanese correspondent to go to Peking after the Second World War, and has maintained contacts in China over the years. He is also a founding member of the Japan Christian Peace As- sociation, and as such has found a means by which he can relate his knowledge and experience with an active Christian concern for peace and the improvement of the climate of international politics in Asia. Initially, Mr. Shishido confirmed the generalization that the Japanese people have a feeling of closeness to the people and culture of China. Tliis may be subconscious and even non-rational but it does create a basic favorable inclination toward the Mainland while still permitting expressions of disapproval of certain politics and developments of the Peking regime. One point where this becomes clear, according to Mr. Shishido, is in the reaction to Communism. Japanese have a much stronger feeling against the Soviet Union and its ac- tivities as a Communist power than they do toward the Chinese Communists. Russia has presented more of a direct threat fo Japan and even now controls nominally Japanese territory north of Hokkaido; the danger presented by Com- CHINA 11 munist China seems far more real to foreign visitors to Japan than it does to the Japanese themselves. Mr. Shishido noted how impressed he had been during the revolution in China by the discipline and high morality of the People's Libera- tion Army: this initial impression from the revolution period, together, perhaps, with feelings of guilt on account of Japan's military activities in China during the last War, still colors Mr. Shishido's view of China and is shared, to some degree, by most Japanese. Japan's inclination toward mainland China is not limited to emotional attitudes, however. China has been important to Japan's economy in the past. There are many who feel that China is a natural market for Japan today even though, at present, her greatest trading partner is the United States. Although the actual volume of trade with the Mainland is still rather small, Mr. Shishido pointed out, it is already three times that of the trade with Taiwan, and shows every prospect of growing. He sees no difficulty in continuing the policy of \"separating politics and economics\" in the area of China trade, while admitting that this might seem impossibly con- tradictory to foreign, particularly American, observers. China needs Japan and is, furthermore, in terms of trans- portation costs, in a favorable position. In short, it seems clear that trade with Mainland China will increase regardless of major political changes. Not all contacts with China have been favorably received in Japan, however. TKe unfavorable reaction\" to the overtures made on the part of Japanese Socialist Party leaders to the Chinese regime was disappointing and indicated, Mr. Shishido thinks, that its political attitudes were not fully understood. Most serious in recent years has been the disaffection created by China's development and testing of atomic weapons. Mr. Shishido noted that this matter is of great concern to the Japan Christian Peace Association; indeed, this development in China has been the cause of a serious split in the anti- nuclear weapons movement in Japan, and the resulting loss 12 POLITICAL ENCOUNTER of effectiveness in its witness, he feels, is extremely grave. The mere fact that the Japanese Christians were so surprised and disappointed by China's nuclear testing is an indication of the positive expectations held for China, and the degree to which the Japanese had felt they could be an influence in this area of policy. The discussion of Christians and the China question moved very quickly to relations with and the status of Christians in China, especially during the current turmoil there. Mr. Shishido believes that because of common origins in the mis- sionary movement Japanese and Chinese Christians feel close to one another; hence those in Japan feel a good deal of con- cern about their Chinese brethren. In this regard, Mr. Shishido himself has come to know a Protestant pastor in Peking. Their relationship dates from before the Second World War, and both then and since 1945 they have regularly exchanged correspondence and books. In the late 1950's a delegation from the Japan Christian Peace Association was invited to visit China and Mr. Shishido renewed his contacts at that time. Invitations for reciprocal visits have been ex- tended, but the Chinese have been either unable or willing to respond. Since then, this personal relationship has lapsed and the turmoil caused by the \"Great Cultural Revolution\" causes Mr. Shishido to worry somewhat about the fate of his friend. Reports from Peking mention that there were attacks on the Christian churches during the early stages of the revolution, but since then the Christians seem to have been let alone. He is optomistic that someday soon, contacts between Japanese and Chinese Christians can be re-established, and that he will see his friend in Peking. The Great Cutural Revolution, being the most recent de- velopment in Mainland China dominated Mr. Shishido's re- marks, and the interview contained a number of very percep- tive comments. For example, he sees that there is more at stake in the turmoil in China than, as many Western ob- servers would have it, a simple power struggle. Ideology has CHINA Ig played a more important role in the whole of the Chinese revolution than it has in any other Socialist or Communist revolution, and a number of hints may be found in the now- famed writings of Chairman Mao as to the exact nature of the changes he is attempting to bring about. Mr. Shishido referred in particular to Chairman Mao's essay on Resolving the Conflicts among the Peoples. Depart- ing somewhat from a strict historical determinism, Mao sees origin of class consciousness not in circumstances but in the nature of Man himself. At the foundation of the revolu- tionary enterprise, then, is a spiritual, psychological-emotional factor and this leads us to the basic thing that must be changed or transformed in order to complete a true revolu- tion. This analysis makes it possible for a typical peasant- become-agrarian-revolutionary to still possess a \"bourgeois mentality.\" For him, the revolution is not yet complete. This is, of course, all the more true in the case of the convert from non-peasant or non-proletarian origins who will still retain much of his former self under his quilted blue garb and fervent poring over the writings of Chairman Mao. As this flaw which the revolution seeks to overcome is deeply rooted, indeed in the very nature of man, as stated above, liquidation, imprisonment, or the more traditional penal approach to the recalcitrant or impure which marked the stages of the Russian revolution are clearly inappro- priate : they do not go to the heart of the problem, particularly if these \"wrong attitudes\" are, as they often seem to be, un- conscious. Rather, one must change the person so that he can be welcomed fully into the fruits of the revolution. If Mr. Mao's differences w^ith President Liu Shao Chi were strictly those of power, Mr. Shishido pointed out, the Stalinist path of purge and liquidation would be clearly the most logical as well as the most expedient, and President Liu would have been dead long before now. The culmination of the revolution, in Mr. Mao's view, will not come by simply removing those individuals tainted with things bourgeois. They must be con- j^4 POLITICAL ENCOUNTER verted. Were President Liu liquidated, it would to a certain extent be an admission of defeat for the truth of Chairman Mao's system. At this point, Mr. Shishido stated, one can understand more fully the bitterness that has come to light in Sino- Soviet relations during the Great Cultural Revolution. Again, border claims, claims to leadership in the world-wide com- munist movement in terms of power have played their part, but at the heart of the matter would seem to be Mao Tse Tung's scorn for the Russian acquiescence to a \"partial\" re- volution. The 1917 revolution was Socialiist in form: institu- tions were changed, laws were altered, and exploiters of the old order were eliminated but that is as far as it went. No attempt was made to bring about a full conversion of the Russian people. Consequently, in the year of the 50th an- niversary of the revolution, signs of the health of the bourgeois mentality in Russia are rife. From the fashions displayed in GUM department store to the various detentes in foreign policy, the flowers of evil, from Mao's point of view, flourish. Only the people of China under his wise lead- ership are struggling to gain, or regain the purity of the revolutionary goal — that is, the formation of a new man. By now the reader is perhaps aware of the voice in the back of his mind that is asking, \"But isn't this Theology you're talking about?\" When questioned in this vein, Mr. Shishido readily agreed. Substitute \"sin\", \"Gospel, and \"state of Grace\" or \"salvation\" for the appropriate terms in revolu- tionary jargon and suddenly Chairman Mao is preaching evangelism. The analogy to a Christian conception of the nature of man and its \"salvation\" is a strong one and pro- vides a significant, if sobering insight into the depth of under- standing and into the goals of the Peking leadership. The aim is the conversion of China, just as it was to countless Christi- an missionaries up to 1950. But this time, it is to a different and more widely accepted faith which has achieved the amalg- ant long sought-after by Christian leaders, between the for- CHINA 15 eign and the indigenous. In China today, then, there is taking place a strenuous at- tempt, involving the heights of political power, to bring about a true revolutionary-cum-eschatological spirit and a system of true classlessness — a concept rooted in essential Marxism, but one which Marx himself, as a perceptive political sociolog- ist, had to relegate to a ''utopian\" phase of his idealogical system. The effort may indeed be Utopian, the goal impossible to achieve, but the Christian observer, Mr. Shishido declares, must realize that in China the impossible is being attempted, and with all the resources that society can muster. What this may mean for the Christians in China is the source of Mr. Shishido's concern for his pastor friend in Peking. Perhaps his optimism regarding a future reunion rests on his under- standing of the impossibility of the final goal's ever being reached. In any case, since Christians are, or should be in- volved in a similar enterprise — confrontation with the nature of man, and conversion to revealed truth — Mr. Shishido's explication of the Great Cultural Revolution in theological terms might well encourage readers to serious consideration of the implications of the current developments in China. CHAPTER 2 VIETNAM A Look at the Activities of the Japan Christian Council for Peace in Vietnam Keiji Ogaiva The war in Vietnam is a subject of concern to Christians throughout the world. It is perhaps the only political issue since the end of the Second World War to stir the consciences of Christian people in all countries, and it has been of special concern to Christians in Japan. Rather than try to conduct a general survey of Christian opinion, this article will focus on the one very active group in the Churches, the Japan Christian Council for Peace in Vietnam, in an attempt to state the reactions, and resolutions of Japanese Christians in the serious situation in Southeast Asia. In March of 1965 the second All Christian Peace Confer- ence in Japan was held in Osaka at the Tenma Church of the United Church of Christ in Japan. There were 253 financial supporters present from all over Japan, 211 regular members and 10 observers. Compared with the 250 attendants at the meeting of the Conference in Tokyo in 1962 this meeting seems rather small. But if one takes into account the geographical disadvantages, the turnout for the conference is quite remark- able. At the Conference much concern was expressed over reac- tionary movements within the country, but the main interest of the conferees was in the field of international affairs, parti- cularly the war in Vietnam. As a result of the discussions held, the Conference adopted a three-part resolution which VIETNAM 17 stressed the following points: 1) The immediate cessation of the bombing of North Vietnam. It was later explained that . . . \"This would not be construed as the evidence of weakness and withdrawal of the U.S. regular troops from Vietnam . , . but evidence of the strength of her moral self-restraint\". 2) A solution should be sought by means of negotiation which is based on the principles of national-racial self-determi- nation. This implies that there should be a ''cessation of fighting and military action on both sides\", and that \"negotia- tions should be carried out principally between the South Vietnam government and the Viet Cong\". 3) U.S. troops should be withdrawn from Vietnam. In the future there should be a policy of \"military non-involve- ment on the part of the U.S. in Vietnam\". The reasoning behind this is based on the principle that \"real and enduring friendship will be established between the U.S. and the peo- ples of Southeast Asia through other than military ties. Military superiority cannot be the substitute for moral prestige and authority\". In order to realize the intent of these resolutions the Con- ference determind to make use of a variety of means such as the holding of protest meetings, staging demonstrations, and collecting signatures on petitions. These activities were to be used to appeal to the whole world as well as to the Japanese, American, and European Churches. It was also thought desirable that mobilization of Christian opinion should be carried out in every kind of Christian organization, and that, therefore, a special committee should be organized. The result was the Japan Christian Council for Peace in Vietnam. Following the conference the committee leaders made \"an appeal to all Japanese Christians for Peace in Vietnam\". This was issued over the names of 55 well-known Christian leaders. The next step was an organization meeting of the Council held in Tokyo at the Miyake Church in the presence of the promoters and attracting some 120 supporters. Ig POLITICAL ENCOUNTER Three programs were decided upon at this meeting as effec- tive means for realizing the special resolutions of the Osaka Conference. The first was to send an appeal to all Christian Churches, organizations, and schools in Japan. The second was to mount a signature-gathering campaign, which would also seek funds to finance the activities of the Vietnam Peace movement. And thirdly, the Council decided to send a special mission to the United States. The mission would be an ac- tivity of the Conference, but its purpose would be to convey the desires of all Christians in Japan to the National Council of Churches, and to the leaders of each denomination in the United States. To propose such a mission was a daring step, but the Council was determined to carry out its resolve. The idea of the mission went forward and the project was success- fully carried out. This action stands as a landmark in the history of the relations between Japanese and American Churches both in the novelty of sending emissaries from the \"younger\" to the \"older\" Churches, and in the degree of social concern on the part of Japanese Christians that this represented. In the resolutions of the various conferences and meetings, and in the messages and appeals put forward by the Japan Christian Council for Peace in Vietnam one can see the basic assertions that Japanese Christians are making concerning the Vietnam war. The statements of these active organiza- tions contain five interrelated appeals directed variously tc policy-makers in the United States and Japan, and to fellow Christians outside Japan. The first of these calls attention to and deplores the phenomenon which has added a new word to the modern political vocabulary: \"escalation\". The con- tinuing expansion of the war is particularly distressing, and much of the effort of the Japan Christian Council for Peace in Vietnam is concentrated on supporting worldwide appeals for cessation of the bombing of North Vietnam. The second emphasis is to underline the inhuman character of the war. All war takes a sad human toll but the devices of VIETNAM 19 modern weaponry, especially the use of Napalm and \"poison gas\" are to be condemned. They are indiscriminate and there- fore involve more and more the civilian population. The third and fourth appeals are directed more toward the government of Japan. Of these, the first calls attention to the fact that Japan bears a deep moral responsibility in the Vietnam war because it is used in many ways as a supply base for the United States military units active in Vietnam. There can be a greater involvement in a war than is expressed in the actual sending of armed men to fight. Japan must become aware of the degree to which she is involved, and therefore compromised. The other appeal for Japan asked the government how Japan could be so involved if it is truly a country with a \"peace constitution\". With such a constitu- tional committment, what is the proper attitude for the lead- ers of Japan to take? The final appeal is somewhat summary in that it expresses a desire to gain the attention of \"American brethren who respect their own tradition of faith\" in order to make clear the distress that the Vietnam war is causing to Japanese Christians and in order, specifically, to point out the many dangers to them and to the world involved in the strategy of escalation. Behind these appeals lie at least four fundamental view- points or ways of thinking which are important to know if one wishes to understand fully the attitudes of the Council as it strives to speak for Christians in Japan. The first of these concerns the problem of racial attitudes and prejudices. It is asserted that if a war with the present characteristics o\"f the present conflict in Vietnam had occurred in Europe (which is in many ways directly related to America's national interests), it is very doubtful whether the United States could have en- gaged in a \"preventive\" or a \"limited\" war as she has done in Southeast\" Asia. Japanese Christians, who are themselves Asian, cannot help but ask if, to the American people, the lives of Asian people are cheap. In this same period one can ob- 20 POLITICAL ENCOUNTER serve the difficulties of the Civil Rights movement in the United States and the strong nature of racial prejudices in that country. Is it not possible that feelings of white racial supremacy help to support a continued escalation of the war against the Vietnamese people? If so, then the war is indeed a challenge to all Christian churches. Japanese Christians believe that the love of the crucified Christ is shared by all people, including Asians, equally and that if the pernicious in- fluence of race thinking tempers American policy in Vietnam, it is the responsibility of all Christians, but perhaps especially Japanese Christians, to speak out against it. Another basic viewpoint that underlies the attitudes of the Council is related to the first. It involves the problem of col- onialism. The Japanese understand, through their own his- tory from the time the country was first opened to the West, the cultural conditions of a country under colonial or semi- colonial domination. Political independence is necessary in oi'der to form an unique culture for each race and nation; without such independence it cannot create its own history. This is not simply a question of political control. Economic independence is requisite for the development of spiritual independence. In this period of the modern awakening of Asian countries we cannot understand situations in Asia unless we are able to recognize and sympathize with the struggle for racial and national emancipation. Unless this recognition is present a nation's Asia policy will be rowing against the stream of modern history and will bring many people into unnecessary confrontation, tension, and struggle. This viewpoint prompted many of the resolutions of the Peace movement which basically question whether or not American policy in Vietnam misses the main point in not considering Asian policy from the standpoint of the peoples of Asia. Thirdly, the Council raises questions about the motivation of American policy vis-a-vis Communism in Asia. United States policy seems to have been motivated by the desire to stop Communism from taking over in Vietnam as this would VIETNAM 21 be the first, fatal step towards a complete Communist domina- tion of Southeast Asia. The Council believes that Communist expansion in Asia cannot be stopped by arms. U.S. military intervention has only intensified the situation and involved more innocent people. U.S. actions have only aroused the antipathy of Asian people who have been friendly to her in the past. The Viet Cong are more nationalist fhan Com- munist, for in Asia Communism generally tends to be an in- strument of nationalism. The U.S. has been blinded by its committment to \"anti-Communism\" so that it is unable to comprehend the nature of the force of a movement for na- tional liberation, and this flaw, among others, led the Council to believe that the U.S. will lose her prestige and friendship among the Asian people. A final view, related in many ways to those above, is based on Japanese insights into the nature of a guerilla war. In the Sino-Japanese war which led up to the Pacific war, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties at the hands of Communist-led guerillas. From this experience the Japanese have learned that a conflict against guerilla forces cannot be won unless one has the full support of the populace living in the area of combat. If this support is not forthcoming, the field army must undertake to destroy or \"pacify\" all the in- habitants of the region, be they civilian, sympathizers, or ac- tive combatants. As the people of Japan and China soon discovered, the tactics of anti-guerilla warfare become in- creasingly savage and inhuman with clear victory never achieved by either side. Applying this analogy to Vietnam, the implication is that escalation in overt war means an es- calation in inhumanity, suffering, and the toll of innocent lives. Another lesson held in this analogy is that an escalated guerilla war can move inexorably into a total war, and in the age of nuclear weapons this prospect is especially horrifying. The people of Japan have had direct experience with the pattern of guerilla war, and the consequences to which it can lead. For this reason, Japanese Christians feel it a duty, a 22 POLITICAL ENCOUNTER responsibility to try and share the lessons of their own ex- perience with their American brethren. It is imperative that this message, founded in history, not theory, be heard in America. For this reason, the Council took the bold step of sending a mission to the United States to explain the afore- mentioned appeals and viewpoints. What has been the impact of the work of the Japanese Christian Council for Peace in Vietnam on the Churches in Japan? The mission to the American Churches captured the imagination of Japanese churchmen, and one of the first prob- lems for the Christian community was to determine who should go on the mission as spokesmen for Japan in this crucial time. In order that the delegation represent the con- cerns of all the Churches the Council asked that the Reverend Isamu Omura be the leader of the mission. He was at that time Moderator of the United Church of Christ in Japan and has always had a great understanding of Christian peace movements. Because of fears of the effects that his leader- ship might have in relation to his official position he was most reluctant to accept the responsibility though he hoped to join the mission as one of its members, in a personal capacity only. However, because he was felt to be the most appropriate person he finally agreed to assume this difficult task. Joining him on the team were Dr. Yoshiaki lizaka. Professor at Gakushuin University, Dr. Sekikazu Nishimura, then a mem- ber of the House of Representatives of the Diet {Japan So- cialist Party), Miss Hatsue Nonomiya, the leader of the peace movement section of the Japan Christian Women's Associa- tion, and Dr. Kosaku Yamaguchi, Professor at Momoyama Gakuin University. The establishment of the mission caused a sensation in the Churches in Japan. A meeting of concerned Christians was held in June, before the mission left, at the Reinanzaka Church to discuss peace in Vietnam. Over 400 persons were present, an unusually large turnout for a meeting of the Christian peace movement, and much heated debate of the VIETNAM 23 resolutions of the Council took place. After some amend- ments and adjustments of Council statements, the sending of the mission was endorsed. Japanese Christians accepted the need to take this momentous step, and proceeded to raise from among their numbers, the 3 million yen deemed necessary to finance the venture. By September, after the mission had returned, the fund was over-subscribed by 450 thousand yen, having come from more than 209 churches, 40 Christian groups, 205 private offerings and 86 miscellaneous sources. The mission spent about a month in the United States traveling and speaking both as a group and individually. A schedule had been arranged by the National Council of Churches, and it took the representatives to Churches, univer- sities, and meetings of journalists in most of the major urban areas in the United States, as well as to the White House, the State Department, the Pentagon, and other government of- fices. The importance of this activity for Japanese Christians can be seen in three ways. The Churches in Japan have tended to have a rather passive attitude toward political mat- ters. The degree of activity involved in the Vietnam peace movement and the wide support it received is a remarkable development in the history of the Church in Japan. Financial support came not just from Tokyo and Osaka, but from all over the country; from large urban churches and smaller rural congregations. The extent of support, financially ex- pressed, is some indication of how deeply Japanese Christians feel about the fighting in Vietnam, and how much they ap- preciated the initiatives taken by the Japanese Christian Council for Peace in Vietnam. Additionally, up until the sending of the mission in 1965, the peace movement among Japanese Christians was regarded as a peripheral activity of a small group of ''radicals\", and therefore in no way representative of the wider Christian body in Japan. Through the work of the Council, however, the average Christian, the local congregation came to consider 24 POLITICAL ENCOUNTER seriously the political responsibility of their several churches. The influence of the Council may be considered as having had a maturing effect on Christian social consciousness, and the Christian peace movement has stepped to a new phase in the life of Japanese Christians. Finally, in this movement, Japanese Christians have been speaking from their own situation as Asians. Up until this time, the basic attitudes of the Japanese churches have often been dependent upon, or mere reflctions of those of European or American churches. Yet the Church, wherever it is, has the responsibility to speak both to and from its local situation, and in this movement, perhaps for the first time, Japanese Christians fulfilled the expectations that this responsibility entails. Also, we see as an aspect of this assumption of re- sponsibility a new relationship between the younger mission churches and the \"Mother\" church. A mission sent to the United States marks the development of a kind of equality in relationship that must surely be welcomed by both parties. CHAPTER 3 CRISIS IN THE UNIVERSITY DEATH . . . AND RESURRECTION? Bruce Roberts, Jr. It is not the purpose of this article to provide a detailed description of the recent events at the International Christian University. The writer's information at many points is in- complete and can be suspect of being biased. Moreover, by the time this material is in print there will doubtless have been many developments that cannot be accounted for be- tween writing and printing. Rather, after a brief chronologi- cal presentation an attempt will be made, consistent with the writer's understanding of the purpose of this section of the Japan Christian Year-hook, to draw out of the situation some observations on the impact of a political event upon a group of Christian people in an avowedly Christian institution, and various questions that present themselves about the in- teraction of Christians and political questions in a particular case in Japan. Scenario of crisis: Initially, the subject of dispute be- tween the faculty and administration of I.C.U. on one hand and a vocal group of self-selected student leaders on the other was the university's proposal to use the Standard Achieve- ment Test of the Noryoku Kensa Kenkyujo (or Noken Test) for a part of its entrance examination procedure. Both the general concept of the examination and specific portions of its content had come under severe criticism by the Japan Teach- ers' Union (Nikkyoso) on grounds which are, for reasons of space, outside the scope of this article, but after receiving the assurances of its own education experts that the test was 26 POLITICAL ENCOUNTER sound, the faculty voted in May of 1966 to try the test for at least a year. Whether the Noken Test was a \"real\" issue is a debatable question in trying to understand the ensuing events, for the chronology shows that the incensed reaction of the student body was a long time in coming, suggesting that other factors were perhaps involved. The previous December (1965) there had been a brief but intense confrontation over the establish- ment of a student cooperative for the running of the univer- sity dining hall. In order to get the administration to approve the cooperative a forcible blockade of the Main Building was proposed to the student body and was voted down, but sub- sequent proposals for the disciplining of certain student lead- ers resulted in the setting up of such a barricade in the next week. After seven days, the occupying students quit the building and the matter rested, leaving many issues about the role of the student in the university unresolved. One clear result was the breeding of an atmosphere of distrust by students of the university's leadership (and vice-versa) into which the issue of the Noken test was interjected. It is reported that a small group o:^ students held a special \"summer seminar\" to analyze the \"mistakes\" of the Coopera- tive movement, and to set up the framework for the next in- cident, in which there were to be no such mistakes. If reliance upon the assent of the assembled student body was one of these, then the atrophying of the structure of student gov- ernment and the regular channels of student-faculty com- municaion which quietly occurred through the Fall of 1966 could be considered as part of an over-all design conceived in the summer seminar. In any case, suddenly in January, 1967 with the entrance examination period approaching, vocal pro- test against the Noken test and its use at I.C.U. began, and because there was no official student government, a self-select- ed committee assumed leadership on behalf of the student body and the struggle was on. From that time, events moved quickly. UNIVERSITY CRISIS 27 In the first week in February, for reasons entirely apart from the student protest, the faculty voted not to use the Noken test results in the 1967 admissions screening. There was a moment of confusion on the part of the student op- position, but two days later the university community awoke to find that the Main Building was eifectively barricaded from the inside by an undetermined number of students and that an \"all-student strike\" was under way. This came as a surprise to many of the students, but by noon of the following day a large number of supporting students had been mar- shalled through the effective use of dormitory leadership and a student-faculty face-down was inevitable. The demands had then shifted to (a.) a promise \"never\" to use the Noken test, and (b.) the rescinding of a modest increase in the fee for taking the admissions test. Twelve days later on the eve of the Entrance Examinations (for which it was thought the use of the Main Building was essential), the President of the university unilaterally agreed to the students' conditions. After a few hours of hesitation, the response of the occupying group was to offer to leave only if there were a guarantee of no disciplinary action, and the phase of true struggle was entered. The Entrance Examinations were held under a great deal of strain in other campus buildings, unmolested, but im- mediately afterwards, the confrontation was renewed. The university determined to continue classes, and the students issued a new set of demands, including the \"no discipline\" one, a demand for the faculty to vote on the President's action, a promise that no academic research be done with Noken materials, that the faculty apologize, and many others. The group became more active, leaving the building to try to block access of other students to classes, entering the classes to stop lectures, and culminating in the barricading in of a faculty meeting in another building for 13 hours, and in a bottle-throwing, clubswinging rebuff of a university attempt to enter the building in hopes of resuming the academic life 28 POLITICAL ENCOUNTER of I.C.U. Readers not familiar with Japanese Law might well be asking at this point, \"where are the civil authorities in all this?\" Because of the University Autonomy Law, and the tradition which supports it, it is most difficult for the police to enter on and act within the campus of a university in^ Ja- pan. The university must request police aid, a step not lightly taken by its officials, and the police must then assess whether or not there be sufficient cause to enter. Using a tactic of getting a court order to enter the barricaded build- ing, court auditors, supported by municipal police, were able to enter the occupied building on Monday, April 10th, two months to the day from when the Hantaisha Domei (roughly, \"Opposing People's Federation\") entered it. A few students were arrested for specific acts noted at different times, and it seemed the crisis was over. Yet the group, then reduced to its \"hard core\" of thirty or so, re- mained on the campus, again free under law to do so, doing their best to disrupt any regular functioning of the institu- tion. LC.U. was placed in a kind of suspended animation until September of 1967 . . . and the unraveling of this particular narrative still remains to be observed. Though the description of the events is incomplete both the situation is still in medias res, and because much detail has perforce been omitted, it still should serve as an introduc- tion to some broader thoughts about Christians facing political issues within the university, prompting the theme and titlo of this article — death and resurrection. Death is a very ominous word. Is this experiment in high- er education, unique to Japan if not in a broader context, dying? Certainly, for a vast majority of students at LC.U. education withered into non-existence in February, and will remain so until at least September: a costly eight-month hiatus. Many of the personal relationships among students and between students and faculty so impoitant to I.C.U.'s form of university life have either died or been severely UKlVElRSiTY CRISIS ^g> strained, as have many if not all of the basic presuppositions the university has tried to build upon. In many areas of the university's life There is already dead wood, and a death of the old to bring about the birth of the new could be salutary for the institution. Not all dying is bad. But in such a situation as is described above, the process is not easily con- trolled and the death of much that is positive and fundamental to what I.C.U. has striven to be is clearly a possible outcome. Student unrest is hardly new to Japan. Other univer- sities, some Christian in formal committment, have faced serious challenges. Why, then, is the I.C.U. experience so important? Perhaps because more than many other schools, I.C.U. has made its own peculiar claims more confidently and is now in the dilemma of finding that much of what it has asserted as being \"different\" from the mainstream of Japa- nese higher education has become none other than its chief weakness when faced with a committed, disciplined group of idealogues whose tactics and loyalties, together with an ap- parent willingness to separate means from ends, enable them to act effectively in the face of accepted relationships and behavior patterns. The dilemma is not a new one: the Ameri- can political theorist, John H. Hallowell noted that this is \"the crisis of our time\"* as he observed the collapse of classic Western Liberalism in the face of both Fascist irration- ality and Marxist dialectics. Both of these challenges in the West use the thought and institutions of Liberal Decocracy in order to bring about its overthrow. Much the same can be seen in microcosm at I.C.U. whose Christian, democratic, arid educational claims Have made it more vulnerable than a larg- er, more secular, more authoritarian institution might be. Democracy : Born out of the ashes of World War II, on the sight of a bombed aircraft factory, the International Christian University was envisioned as a step toward a new * John H. Hallowell, Main Currents in Modern Political Thought, Holt, Rinehart & Winston, N.Y., 1950. 30 POLITICAL ENCOUNTER type of education that would train future generations of leaders who would, hopefully, be able to strengthen the somewhat fragile Japanese democratic tradition. This goal was to be accomplished not only through educational com- mittment but also by creating something of a laboratory for democracy in the actual social and administrative structure of the university. In this area, quite clearly, what was proposed as a strength for the university community became a crucial weakness as the crisis unfolded. One place where a near approximation of \"one man-one vote\" democratic practices was established was in the govern- ing role of the university faculty. Because the number of full-time personnel has never exceeded 100, it was possible to have all-faculty meetings often, and by accident or design, this meeting has been accustomed to take a large measure of responsibility in all areas of university policy-making. One of the oftheard axioms about democratic government is that while it may be fair, it is also inefficient. When one adds the factor of a mixture of the Japanese \"consensus\" approach with Western parliamentary-majoritarian techniques, it be- comes down-right cumbersome in the best of circumstances. In a rapidly-changing situation where quick and clear deci- sions are called for, and where tactical thinking is essential, a roomful of \"academics\" simply cannot function as a deci- sion-making body. It soon became clear that at I.C.U. the full initiative had moved to the smaller, more tactically flexible and more unified student leadership. As distressing as this discovery was for the faculty and administration, the revelation of their actual impotence of their democratic pro- cess has come as something of a shock. Student Government: \"Impotence\" is an apt term to describe the state of the \"laboratory for democracy\" at the student level as well. There is some form of student govern- ment at all Japanese universities but the usual pattern is for it to fade into insignificance in the face of numberless competing club activities that are more interesting and have UNIVERSITY CRISIS 31 often a much stronger tradition supporting them. The size of the I.C.U. student body (about 1,000), coupled with the encouragement officially given to the form, if not to the con- tent, of student government has meant that it looms more importantly than the clubs and has stood apart from their activities which are, on the other hand, much less important than at other Japanese universities. To say that -the Student Government has been more ap- parent is not, however, to say that it has been more effective. The usual pattern of leadership has been for nearly all of- fices to be held by second-year students, the older students being \"too busy\" to become involved. They certainly do not become directly involved, but the established practise is for a group of the more experienced third and fourth-year students to \"advise\" the younger incumbents. It is thus an ideal situation for a small group who do not seek the endorsement of the general student body to manipulate any significant ac- tivities of the elected representatives. Elections have rarely been contested so that there has even been some control over the initial election process. The whole pattern, too, is useful for the indoctrinating of new recruits for the ongoing life of the small group. Significant activities can be manipulated, but the fact is that there has been little of real significance for the student government to do. The complaint that student government is mere \"sandbox politics\" is universal in the United States at least, and is no less applicable to I.C.U. for all its hopes for student experience in democratic decision-making. Apart from organization of the annual festival, and the distribu- tion of a small budget and clubroom space in the student union building, the governing body has had little actual power. It is, however, a body designed to make decisions, and political decision-making invariably deals with forms of power. There are then two alternatives for such a group to take: to become indifferent and disinterested, or to seek power. In 1965-66 the latter course was chosen with the establishment of the 32 POLITICAL ENCOUNTER student cooperative for the running of the dining hall and bookstore being the immediate goal. When the very structure of the student government made it possible for the general assembly of the students to veto the leadership's proposal for a barricade, the first course was followed, and one of the steps that permitted the group to move from being king-makers to actual leaders was the probably-planned atrophy of the student government already mentioned. As a result, no elec- tions were held in 1966. The democratic dilemma of student government at I.C.U. is now particularly acute. The question as to whether to have any at all is now being raised unofficially among the faculty. This is to question one of the basic features of the university, yet the alternative presents distressing pos- sibilities, perhaps more to the Japanese than to the smaller group of foreigners. To have students government is to provide, as has been mentioned, a structure for making deci- sions dealing with power. To flourish then, the student gov- ernment must be invested with power, and there are two primary kinds that could be so invested. One would be to share in the broader academic and administrative decision- making of the university. There is little or no precedent for this in Japan, and the recent behavior of the students has not served to encourage confidence that such power, should such a step ever be taken, would be exercised responsibly. The other kind is for the student government to opt into the university power questions from the broader political scene. This has been the choice of the fissiparous groups of the Zengakuren and is hardly an alternative likely to be enthusi- astically received in the I.C.U. community at this point in its history. The above alternatives do not include an expansion of student powers, as has been suggested in such quarters, into campus beautification, student honor codes and the like. Compared to these the \"real issues\" of student and university autonomy, social change, and international affairs are, not unnaturally, immensely more appealing and more relevant. UNIVERSITY CRISIS 33 I.C.U. students may be faulted for immaturity, but they are far too intelligent to be satisfied with a \"good citizenship\" package that would be better suited to the middle-school. Dormitories: The fact that I.C.U. has housed a large percentage of its students on the campus is one of the \"unique\" features of the university. It can be said that in terms of a laboratory for democracy, the founders of the university saw the dormitory system as playing a crucial role. Conceived of as experiments both in democratic and international living the institution held much promise but as in student govern- ment generally, the patterns of Japanese society proved stronger, and were in fact enhanced by the way in which \"experimental living\" was structured. The policy of having the students in the predominantly four-person rooms come from each of the four classes in the university provided, albeit unintentionally, a series of sub-groups with a built-in \"pecking order\". A rigid Kohai Sem-pai sub-structure was thereby furnished and it is not surprising that the day-to-day life of the dormitory has tended to encourage neither dialogue nor democracy. The self-governing meetings rapidly became closed social systems, easily excluding foreign students, which were primarily useful for indoctrination and reinforcing non- rational student loyalties. It should have come as no surprise to the administration that when the Main Building was bar- ricaded the dormitory councils became the agents both for recruiting general student support and for articulating the demands of the outwardly silent and anonymous Haiitaisha Domei. Summarily, it should be noted regarding both the general student government and the dormitory system that the dilemma of power discussed above provided a major source of the students' dissatisfaction which erupted in February of this year. While articulating democratic ideals on the one hand, university administrators found it increasingly necessary to exercise authority over the activities of the \"laboratories of democracy\". Consequently, most students at 34 t»OLlTiCAL ENCOUNTER one time or another have been found calling attention to a kind of ''credibility gap\" that has gradually widened between the principle and the reality, as the students see it, of I.C.U.'s avowal of democracy. Indeed, it seems at points that the central issue not only in this crisis but in the long-range deterioration of responsible student leadership has been the whole problem of authority itself. Rationalism : One of the hidden assumptions of the West- ern democratic ideology is rationalism. The rationality of Man, and the common ground-rules of the reasoning process have become integral to a system that turns on dialogue and a careful balancing of majority power with minority rights. In the setting of a university the premise should be, if any- thing, more explicit. Yet one of the sources of frustration and disillusionment for the faculty and leaders in the univer- sity was their inability to bring the issues ostensibly motivat- ing this particular crisis into the arena of rational debate. The academics came face to face with a closed ideological system and communication by means of chanted slogans and violent action, and were unable to cope. In the beginning dis- cussion was attempted, but it rapidly became apparent that the format would always be a combination harangue-inquisi- tion with the initiative always in the hands of the student group. Occasional personal meetings of faculty with student advisees did produce some calm discussion, but hardly rational as it was soon discovered that outside a framework of predi- gested questions and answers the students were unable to speak. In many places such rigidity and inability to meet criticism and questioning from their teachers would cause embarassment and loss of face. If anything, their technique — totally irrational — converted more of the student body to \"the cause\". The movement on the part of the faculty from a position that stated, in effect, \"these are our students and we can and must get through to them\", to a position that accepted that the use of force in such a frame of reference could only be met University crisis 35 by force was a particularly agonizing one. One is reminded of the anguish experienced by the protagonist in C.S. Lewis's novel Perelandra who tries endlessly to use his skills as a university don to reason with the \"Un-man\", the embodiment of sheer evil in human form, who is sharing in the discovery of a new and mysterious planet. After chapters of fruitless discussion, Ransom is forced to realize that his antagonist is in fact no longer a human being, but Evil itself, and that the only way it can be dealt with is by physically destroying it, the \"Un-man\". The analogy is intentionally an extreme one, but the decision to seek the help of the courts and the police to end the occupation of the building as well as the decision to take disciplinary action unprecedented in scope in post-war Japanese educational history came as the culmination of a very similar probing of all that the dictates of reason provide. This development marked the end of democratic innocence at I.C.U., a kind of death, if you will. What will arise in its place will require further painful exploration of the contradic- tions that constitute the crisis of our time. Educational values: In order to realise its democratic and other goals, I.C.U. from its beginning chose a pattern of life designed to avoid many of the difficulties that have produced student unrest in Japanese universities. For better education- al communication, for the growth of personal relations, for international contact on a deep level the model of the small. Christian liberal arts college with a full general education curriculum was used. However, both size and curriculum were found wanting when the recent test presented itself. The smallness of the student body was one of the crucial factors that allowed the relative small group of ideologues to come to know and convert a majority of the student body to at least a portion of their views. Those who would normally avoid student political activity, because of their place in the dormitories or other unavoidable contacts with the leadership group, were made to feel guilty for their \"apathy\" and were more or less forced to take a stand where they would not 3g POLITICAL ENCOUNTER normally be inclined to do so. The conclusion to which such thinking leads is that student activism per se is a positive good that therefore regardless of who is active, or what his goals or methods may be, his activity should be at least tacitly supported. Otherwise one commits the sin of ''apathy.\" It is a vicious circle which, when bolstered by the facts that the faculty and administration provide a convenient authority enemy, and that 1000 activists in a group of a thousand have greater impact than on a campus of ten thousand presents a very serious threat to the life of a university. One of the most disheartening discoveries of the crisis was the confirmation of a fact, suspected by some in recent years, that the students are far more effective educators than the faculty. This can be seen at several levels. Certainly in the communication of I.C.U.'s basic values and of the values of academic freedom and responsibility generally there has obviously been a serious short circuit. Perhaps it has been felt that all these values were so pre-eminent they would, as it were, communicate themselves. The catalogues and orienta- tion programs abound with explications of \"the I., the C, and the U.\" — that which makes I.C.U. unique. Yet the result has been statements to the effect that student censorship of academic research, impounding of faculty books, notes, and research materials, and the forceable denial of students' access to lectures constitutes ''the preservation of true academ- ism and freedom for the individual\". Not only are such assertions made, they are accepted. Remedy for this problem might lie either in means to assure that the faculty members better embody the basic values, and that they articulate them more overtly, or in the structuring of curricula so as to pro- vide for inculcation of the values in the classroom. Either alternative, however, raises thorny academic freedom ques- tions of its own, and in areas where academics are most sensitive. As for the content of academic work as it now stands, the actions of the striking students also demonstrated that princi- UNIVERSITY CRISIS 37 pies taught and examined in the classroom do not find applica- tion even outside the doors of the building, much less in the world for which, presumably, the students are being prepared. One example that came to the minds of many was that in the much praised Freshman English Program (required of all Japanese students) one of the books read, discussed, and expounded upon by all students is George Orwell's Animal Farm. Yet, having been exposed to this incisive critique of Marxist revolution, the students who stood or snake-danced about, shouting the slogans minted daily by the leadership, and fed to the group over a loud-hailer could see no parallel at all between their behaviour and that of Orwell's sheep whose chanting of \"four legs good, two legs bad\" was guaran- teed to silence any embarassing questions put to the porcine leaders of Animal Farm. It was not that the students were indignant that such a parallel should be suggested, but worse, the reaction was one of complete mystification that such an idea would ever enter one's head. The example may seem trivial, but it stands as a kind of symbol of the failure of educational communication in the university. Another level at which the effectiveness of the students as educators was revealed was in what could be called the \"free university syndrome.\" In the United States today most of the major universities have discovered on their geographi- cal and educational borders non-credit, student-run \"univer- sities\" that offer subjects in which students are \"really in- terested.\" The subjects range from the predictable explora- tions of psycedelic drugs to areas of literature, politics, and philosophy that are genuinely lacking in the standard curri- culum. Some schools, recognizing the implied criticism of the latter contributions of the \"free universities\" have, in fact, incorporated some of the non-credit subjects into the regular university curriculum in an attempt to knit the university community back together again. At I.C.U. the Noken issue clearly demonstrated that the same pattern existed there. From the beginning of the anti- 38 POLITICAL ENCOUNTER Noken movement it was apparent that the student body, and not just the leadership group, were extremely well informed. Indeed, with the exception of a few educational specialists, they were better informed and more articulate than the univer- sity faculty and administration. Why was this? Quite simp- ly, the issue was \"real\" and it was interesting. It was of direct concern to the students, and yet involved issues that seemed to affect the whole fabric of Japanese society. As a consequence seminars were held, research was conducted, re- ports were made and published, all for the mutual enlighten- ment of the student body (and only incidentally for the en- lightenment of the faculty). Much more energy was expended on the Noken test and its implications than was exerted for regular university assignments. It is not that that there were insufficient assignments to keep the students busy, but little of it captured the interest or had the apparent immediacy for them that the Noken did. Called into question here is the whole relevance of the university curriculum for educating modern Japanese students. Particularly at fault, as is re- cognized in most quarters of the university is the content, if not the overall conception, of the highly-touted general educa- tion program. It has significantly failed to provide an adequate stimulus to sustain students for a four-year program of study. Internationalism: One of the educational values that sets I.C.U. most clearly apart from other universities in Japan is its commitment to an education that is international both in its emphasis and its personnel. It is in the latter aspect that it has been most experimental in that it attempts to in- clude non-Japanese faculty and students as integral, equal components of the academic community. They are full parti- cipants at all levels and in all phases of the university and not merely a sprinkling of kindly\" foreign missionaries\" who teach English. The problems of language, culture, and prejudice make ^his particular aspect of I.C.U. one of its most fragile. The UNIVERSITY CRISIS 39 hope that the confrontation of peoples in, or in spite of these problem areas would produce a ''creative tension\" has been propounded in the pages of this Yearbook in other years. Being fragile, it does not take a great deal of additional stress for creative tension to degenerate into simple, corrosive ten- sion. Whether calculated or not, the instigators of the dis- turbance soon found this a readily exploitable weak spot both in the faculty and among the students. Continued as- sertions that this was a \"Japanese\" problem, and that the non-Japanese students were not fully a part of the academic community reaped a harvest of ill-will and misunderstanding from resentments and uncertainties that had been seeded over time. Much of the \"ism\" of being international has been dying in the I.C.U. crisis. How and why it is reestablished will be questions crucial to the future of the university. One function of internationalism in the university has been to create an understanding of Japan, her people and values, for non-Japanese. But another hoped-for function has been to raise questions about the society and its values for the Japanese. If successful, this can be a very disturbing pro- cess, and one analysis of the unrest at I.C.U. traces the cause of it to just this sort of disturbance. If this analysis is ac- curate, then it would seem that the university has been more successful in raising unsettling questions than it has been in enabling them to be answered. Much deep probing of how this function of internationalism can be responsibly fulfilled will be necessary not only for the health and stability of the university itself, but for those individuals it graduates into the very society whose structure and values are being ques- tioned. For example, one traditional stress at I.C.U. has been \"service\" over against self -attainment. However there are few opportunities for the graduate to fulfill a \"service centered\" goal in his career, and those opportunities that do exist in Japanese society, are often transient, like the \"peace corps\", or are poorly regarded, and poorly rewarded. It has been said that when the Japanese university graduate steps 40 POLITICAL ENCOUNTER into his waiting job, it is with a sense of guilt for having betrayed those ideals espoused as a student. It would ther follow that the greater the ideal and the expectation, the greater the guilt. The line between \"creative tension\" anc perennial frustration, in the university and beyond, is verj thin. A facile internationalism is no adequate preparation foi keeping on the creative side of that line. Christianity : One of the most serious comments that car be made about the process of dying in the crisis at I.C.U. is that there is much less to be said about the overt role oi Christianity to the problem than there is to be said about th( other special claims of the university. It was not just that nc overt challenges were made, or that no serious questions were raised. To all parties of the dispute the Christianness of the university was simply irrelevant. There are many possible explanations for this phenome- non, but one basic reason would seem to lie in the fact thai the university community has been significantly unable tc articulate the relevance of the Gospel to the real life of the students and to the political and social questions which con- cern them. This is not merely a fault in communication With few notable exeptions the Christian faculty is in- adequately prepared to be cogent on questions in these crucial areas. To be fair to the Christians at I.C.U. it must b€ noted that, again with notable exceptions, this seems to be s difficulty for most Christians in Japan, and indeed in mosi societies. But however universal the flaw, one can still nol discount the seriousness of its consequences in this particulai situation. A point where this criticism showed up most starkly was in the discovery that several of the student leaders, who en- gineered and carried out the activities described above, were committed Christians. I.C.U., because of the very character- istics under discussion, has tended to attract to its student body idealists, and among them Christian idealists. Once in the university, their discovery of the credibility gap between ,«^-fe^t3!^ \"Defiant students meet law at ICU\" (See Part II Chap. 3) 'Kawasaki Industrial Complex\" (See Part III Intro.)

The traditional inter-involve- ment of Christianity and the political left in Japan is well- known, and there have been many reasons for such an alliance. In this sense it should not have come as a surprise to find articulate Christians among the student activists. What is surprising is that the questions that this historical alliance should have raised in a Christian community have not been fully explored at I.C.U. A Christian university in Japan should have both the resources and the opportunity to under- take such an exploration, and with a sophistication that the average layman is often unable to achieve. Such an explora- tion would seem incumbent for I.C.U. and now, under condi- tions that will make the task even"
