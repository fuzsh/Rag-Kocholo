Leonard\n\nFighting Japan’s Cold War\n\nYasuhiro Nakasone, who served as prime minister for more than five years in the 1980s, was one of Japan’s leading postwar politicians. This book is a biography of him, but by interweaving international politics and media appraisals of him, it also serves as an examination of Japan’s postwar politics. Nakasone was an innovative conservative who actively criticized the conservative mainstream, and this book reveals from both domestic and foreign policy perspectives how the Liberal Democratic Party governed. The Nakasone government served not only as the final phase of the Cold War era of LDP factional politics but also as the starting point for the general mainstream faction system that followed. With the lengthy passage of time since the end of the Cold War and the collapse of Japan’s 1955 party system, there is a need to reassess Nakasone, showing that there was much more to him than the popular picture of him as a far-right hawk who loudly advocated for Japan to engage in autonomous self-defense and as an opportunist leader of a small faction, and to place the era in which Nakasone lived its proper historical context.

He joined the Ministry of Home Affairs after his graduation from Tokyo Imperial University but was soon dispatched to the Pacific War as a twenty-threeyear-old lieutenant in the Imperial Japanese Navy, where he served as a paymaster. He was in Takamatsu when Japan surrendered. In an imperial capital reduced to ruins, he decided to go into politics and was elected to the House of Representatives at the age of twenty-eight in the first general election held under the new postwar constitution. He was elected in the same year as Tanaka Kakuei, with whom he also shared a birth year, and the relationship between the two men would have important consequences during his political career. The young Nakasone criticized Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida’s “secret bureaucratic diplomacy,” and became known as the “young officer” for his calls for a more independent constitution. While Yoshida and his lineage of politicians became known as the “conservative mainstream,” Nakasone called himself a “innovative conservative” and pushed for greater Japanese independence from the United States. After touring a research facility on atomic energy in the US, he also became a proponent of nuclear energy after his return home. Nakasone’s first cabinet position was as director-general of the Science and Technology Agency during the government of Nobusuke Kishi. During the 1960 revision of the US-Japan security treaty, he urged Kishi to cancel US President Eisenhower’s planned visit to Japan. After being admonished by elder statesman Ishii Mitsujirō to “kill time” during the government of Ikeda Hayato, he began using his time without a cabinet position to gather strength for the future. After becoming the youngest leader of an LDP faction following the death of Ichirō Kōno, Nakasone served as transportation minister and director-general of the Defense Agency in the Satō Eisaku government and called for “autonomous defense.” He rode out the oil crisis as MITI minister under Tanaka Kakuei and then began serving in major LDP party positions such as secretary-general and General Council chairman from the Miki Takeo government on. DOI: 10.4324/9781003351931-1\n\n2 Introduction This was the “Sankaku Daifuku Chū” era of factional conflict with the LDP, so-named due to the major factional leaders of the time: Miki, Tanaka, Ōhira Masayoshi, Fukuda Takeo, and Nakasone. After finally reaching his long-sought position of prime minister at the age of sixty-four in 1982, Nakasone called for a “final settlement of postwar politics” and pushed for the privatization of Japan’s major public corporations. He made great use of brain trusts, establishing a number of private advisory councils on both domestic and foreign policy, and managed his government in a manner that he referred to as being a “presidential prime minister.” Nakasone’s approach to politics serves as the roots of contemporary prime ministerial leadership in Japan. The LDP lost seats in the following general election after the verdict in the Lockheed corruption case was delivered in 1983 and Tanaka was found guilty, but he won a landslide victory in the 1986 joint elections. While he was unable to introduce a sales tax, he was able to calmly retire after naming Takeshita Noboru as his successor. While Nakasone’s diplomacy elevated Japan’s status on the global stage, his administration consistently suffered from economic frictions with the United States, the consequence of Japanese economic power being at its greatest. It was also Nakasone who made an official visit to Yasukuni Shrine, thereby producing an issue that continues to cause tensions between Japan and its Asian neighbors. Nakasone served as prime minister for 1,806 days, making him the seventh longest serving prime minister after Abe Shinzō, Katsura Tarō, Satō Eisaku, Itō Hirobumi, Yoshida Shigeru, and Koizumi Jun’ichirō. He was forced to retire from the House of Representatives by Koizumi in 2003, but he did not close his office and continued to wield influence in the background as an elder statesman. With the death of Miyazawa Kiichi in 2007, Nakasone became the last prime minister to have experienced Japan’s postwar history in its entirety. This book is a critical biography of Nakasone. While it naturally analyzes the words and deeds of the man, I would also like to examine factional politics by weaving in discussion of “Sankaku Daifuku” and media appraisals of Nakasone. Nakasone was a reform conservative who criticized the conservative mainstream, as is symbolized as his beginning in politics opposed to Yoshida, and he is key to understanding the internal politics of the LDP. The Nakasone government was the final phase of the “Sankaku Daifuku Chū” era and the origins of the general leader system that followed. Nakasone had two reputations as a politician. One as a far-right hawk who loudly advocated for Japan to engage in autonomous self-defense. And another as an opportunist leader of a small faction. It is undeniable that Nakasone’s image has become so dominated by media reporting that it has become difficult to form a comprehensive picture of the man. But now, more than thirty years after he stepped down as prime minister, it has become possible to obtain primary documents through freedom of information requests and other means. Over twenty-nine interviews with Nakasone,\n\nIntroduction 3 I heard about his strategic ideas and personal relationships directly from him. I also conducted interviews with reporters and those affiliated with him like former secretaries. Following the course of Nakasone’s life also means tracing the course of Japan through its defeat in war to the zenith of its postwar accomplishments. The time has come for providing a true picture of the man.\n\n1\n\nNakasone’s Youth From Lumber to the Home Ministry\n\nMatsugorō and Yuku Nakasone Yasuhiro was born on May 27, 1918, in Takasaki, Gunma, the second son of Nakasone Matsugorō, a lumber dealer, and his wife Yuku.1 He was their third child, coming after Hatsuko and Kichitarō, and would later be followed by another brother, Ryōsuke. Matsugorō and Yuku would also have two other children, but both died prematurely. When I asked Nakasone about his family’s history, he explained: “I believe it likely that the ancestors of the Nakasone family were vassals of Takeda [Shingen]. After the Takeda army failed to conquer Kōzuke province, most of it withdrew but some chose to stay and return to farming. There’s an area of Gunma District known as Kamiyama, and it seems that my ancestors were former Takeda soldiers who settled there and began farming.”2 His father Matsugorō managed a lumber business named “Kokumatsu” after a large black pine that grew in the garden. He was a brusque man but passionate about his work. He was also public-minded and served as deputy chair of the local chamber of commerce and industry. Kokumatsu had about thirty craftsmen, many of whom lived on the business’ premises. It also owned the rights to a mountain. Nakasone was weak as a child, and Matsugorō would often feed him eel in the hope that it would make him stronger. Come summer, he would also take his family on trips to swim in the ocean in the belief that the sea air was good for the body. Nakasone’s mother Yuku had been born into the Nakamura family of Annaka, a neighboring town. The Nakamura family was wealthy, owning four rice warehouses and holding agricultural and commercial interests. His grandfather served as the local postmaster – a significant position at the time – and his mother’s name came from the first and last consonants of the Japanese word for “post office,” yūbinkyoku. Yuku attended Kyōai Girls School, a missionary school. His mother taught Nakasone Christian hymns as she bathed him as a child, and he picked up the habit of humming these. He also read the Bible as a student at Shizuoka High School. While neither he nor Yuku was DOI: 10.4324/9781003351931-2\n\nNakasone’s Youth 5 Christian, his knowledge of the Bible would prove useful as he engaged with others as a politician on the global stage. As Matsugorō was not a particularly sociable man, management of his business’ craftsmen was left to Yuku. Nakasone later said of his parents that “I respected my mother more than my father. My mother’s death hit me harder and left me in tears. I did not cry when my father died.”3\n\nOrdinary Primary School Nakasone entered Takasaki Kita Ordinary Primary School on April 8, 1926. According to Nakasone, “Everything I wore – the hat I pulled over my eyes, the backpack on my shoulders, the sandals on my feet – was brand new and been prepared by my mother for that day. They had all been laid out at my bedside the night before, and my heart pounded with secret excitement.” As his mother changed him into a new kimono, she looked down fondly at him and told him how impressive he looked.4 According to his sister Hatsuko, while Kichitarō was a terror as a child, Nakasone was obedient and patient, and her mother often remarked on how easy he was to raise. Nakasone was popular at school, and the Kokumatsu lumberyard became a playground for children. Nakasone believed that he could do anything, an optimistic attitude that led his teacher Ochiai Tatsuji to tell him that he was “going to grow up to be another Saigō Takamori.”5 Nakasone’s strongest memories of primary school had to do with his mother. While serving as transportation minister in 1968, he submitted an article, “Thoughts of My Mother’s Warmth Inspired by Windblown Snowflakes,” to the women’s magazine Fujin Seikatsu in which he described his mother as a “beautiful person”: I hesitate to write this, as I am her son, but my mother was a beautiful person. While it is said that memories are purified by the passage of time, I still believe that to be the honest truth. I was proud that she was my mother. As a child, I secretly wished that she would never grow to become a wrinkly old woman. While Yuku was a strict disciplinarian, Nakasone was an obedient child who loved to read. “I don’t remember ever being beaten for having gotten myself into trouble.” Nakasone was especially good at writing essays at school. Whenever he received a perfect score on an essay, he would run home and read it aloud to his mother in the hopes of receiving her praise. She would always smile and tell him how well he had done.6 According to Nakasone, a local newspaper solicited essays while he was in primary school and a piece he wrote about building a sandcastle at the beach was chosen. While the essay itself was inconsequential, Yuku was\n\n6 Nakasone’s Youth extremely pleased at the accomplishment and carried the newspaper clipping in her pocket so that she could proudly show it to visitors. As Nakasone was completing his primary school studies, Japan was moving to a semi-war footing. Matsugorō spoke patriotically about the situation, but Yuku was upset by the possibility of war.7\n\nInterest in Politics Nakasone was five years old when the Great Kantō Earthquake struck. While damage to Takasaki was relatively light, rumors of violence by Koreans spread, and the young Nakasone was concerned that they were true as there were a few Korean students in his grade at school. “I was only in primary school, but I was conscious of other cultures, other ethnicities.”8 As he entered the sixth grade, developments caused him to start to take an interest in politics. He began discussing things with Kaneko Hiroshi, a shy boy in his class. The Fifteenth Infantry Regiment, stationed in Takasaki, was redeployed to China. And he started reading the newspaper. Nakasone entered Takasaki Middle School in April 1931. His interest in foreign affairs was sparked by the Manchurian Incident in September of that same year: “The largest factors in my becoming interested in foreign and diplomatic matters were the Manchurian Incident (1931), which happened when I was thirteen, and the announcement of Japan’s withdrawal from the League of Nations (1933). Reading newspapers, I understood that Japan was becoming isolated and became concerned about the future, wondering ‘What is going to become of Japan if it does these things?’” He discussed these issues with his classmate Moteki Saburō. Moteki was captain of the swimming team, and Nakasone would later hire him as the manager of his campaign office after he went into politics. Nakasone served as president of his class during every year that he was at Takasaki Middle School, and he had nearly perfect grades. The major exception was physical education; he was skilled at kendo but poor at gymnastics. His favorite subject was history, and he loved reading the works of Kunikida Doppo and Natsume Sōseki. Nakasone’s rival for the best grades in his class was Yamaguchi Takeo, the son of a girls school teacher. Middle school lasted for five years under the prewar educational system, but Nakasone and Yamaguchi decided to try to take the entrance exam for Shizuoka High School during their fourth year. Nakasone Shigeo (a member of the main branch of the Nakasone family) was attending the school and had strongly encouraged him to take the exam. Nakasone was accepted into the school’s Humanities C course, which meant that he would be majoring in French. This was an uncompetitive course; the best students at the school majored in German or English, and Nakasone himself had hoped to study one of these languages. He had the\n\nNakasone’s Youth 7 option of completing his fifth year of middle school and then applying for admission to the First Higher School in Tokyo, but he ultimately decided to attend Shizuoka High School. Yamaguchi entered the school’s science department.9\n\nShizuoka High School Nakasone entered Shizuoka High School’s French course in April 1935 at the age of sixteen. While the course would not have been his first choice, he found that it suited him very well: “The French style of education tends to create interesting, somewhat dilettantish students rather than the stereotypical hard-studying ones.” He would later remark that his decision to attend Shizuoka High School was “one of the most appropriate of my life.” The atmosphere at the school was thoroughly typical of the prewar high school system, and he lived in one of the school’s dormitories with about 200 other students. There was a strong sense of solidarity among the student body, and Nakasone made close friends. While the world was experiencing an era of totalitarianism, Nakasone was inspired by the school’s ethos of freedom: There was no politician I admired in particular, not Roosevelt, Stalin, nor Hitler. We all looked down on Hitler. There was a lot of adoration for him [in Japan] at the time, but the old high schools were quite hostile towards the kind of totalitarianism he represented. Hitler’s reputation at Shizuoka High School was absolutely zero. […] The most notable characteristic of the high school was the liberalism that underlay its values. Later, in 1938, he would spend summer vacation as a college student in Karuizawa with members of the Hitler Youth visiting Japan. There are no indications that this had any influence on his beliefs, however. While in high school, Nakasone belonged to the track-and-field team and competed in the 400-meter dash, although he achieved no particular results of note. He was also put in charge of the dorm’s kitchen, something he used as an excuse for spending time at the dormitory of a nearby girls school “conducting research for the menu.” The dorm was named “Gyōshūryō,” and Shizuoka High School alumni would later form a political support organization for him called the Gyōshūkai. Nakasone’s time at the school coincided with important political events. The February 26 Incident, an attempted coup against the government by young army officers, occurred in 1936, and Nakasone heard rumors (that would later turn out to be true) that the genrō Saionji Kinmochi had fled to the residence of the governor of Shizuoka. The Second Sino-Japanese War began in July 1937. While there were far-right groups among the students, most of the student body was liberal and uneasy about the rise of the militarists.\n\n8 Nakasone’s Youth Nakasone received letters from his mother Yuku nearly every week in which she admonished him not to “go out at night with bad students” or to “take care not to catch a cold.” “She sent me so many postcards and letters.”10 In one letter dated October 3, Yuku wrote that “the war is all people talk about everyday. So many people are being killed.” Nakasone could not help but feel that Japan was entering “an era of a dark setting sun.” According to his sister Hatsuko, “I believe it was as a high school student that Yasuhiro somehow decided that he would become a politician.” Their mother told her around this time that “Yacchan is saying that he’s going to be a politician, but I don’t know. Maybe he could make it as far as governor or something.”11\n\nTokyo Imperial University Nakasone’s grades at Shizuoka High School were good, particularly those in history. Hiratsuka Kinpei, his Western history teacher, told him that he should “go study under Imai Toshiki at Tokyo Imperial University’s school of literature and aim to become a professor.” But Nakasone’s interest in politics only increased, and when he entered the university in April 1938, he joined the school of law’s political science department instead. No one was happier about this than Yuku, who would sometimes visit him in Tokyo, bringing chocolate or pots of flowers with which to decorate his lodgings. Nakasone and his friends would go to the bathhouse Kamenoyu in Dangozaka at night.12 While at Tokyo Imperial University, Nakasone studied European political history under Oka Yoshitake, the history of political science under Nabara Shigeru, and diplomatic history under Kamikawa Hiromatsu. He viewed all of these with great interest, but it was Yabe Teiji’s politics courses that had the greatest impact on him. According to Nakasone, “Yabe’s take on political science reconciled Japan’s traditional national character with modern political science.” Yabe was well-versed in international affairs, having studied abroad in Europe and America, and made frequent trips to China. While Nakasone was unaware of this fact, he was also a close advisor to Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro. He would meet Yabe again after becoming a politician. During his time as a student, Rōyama Masamichi and some of the school’s other professors began promoting the idea of the “East Asian Community” (a predecessor to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere concept), a rationale meant to provide support for Konoe’s announcement that the Second Sino-Japanese War was intended to “construct a new order in East Asia.” Nakasone was skeptical of his professors’ arguments: “Discussion at the time was dominated by right-wing ideologies, and I suspected that the ‘East Asian Community’ idea was merely a front for Japanese control. I harbored fundamental doubts about whether any such community would actually be created.”13\n\nNakasone’s Youth 9\n\nTo the Home Ministry On the evening of March 9, 1940, as Nakasone furiously studied for his final exams, he received a phone call from his father: “Come home right away. Your mother’s in critical condition.” He was shocked. “Why am I only learning this now?” When he arrived at Ueno Station, he found that the last train to Takasaki had already left. While he took the first available train in the morning, his mother had already passed away by the time he arrived. Sitting at her bedside, he yelled at his father for the first time in his life. “I would have quit school had I known that it would mean missing her death!” With tears in his eyes, Matsugorō said, “I wanted to let you know earlier. I honestly did. But this is what Yuku wanted.” Yuku had suddenly fallen ill on March 3 after seeing off soldiers at the train station as a member of the National Defense Women’s Association. She had refused to rest, thinking it only a mild cold, but her condition grew worse and developed into pneumonia. She came down with a fever of more than 40 degrees. When Matsugorō had told her that they should inform their children of her condition, Yuku had stopped him, saying, “They’re taking exams. Please don’t cause them any unnecessary worry” (Nakasone’s younger brother Ryōsuke was studying at Otaru Commercial High School at the time). Her high fever continued for nearly a week. On her final evening, she called Matsugorō to her bedside and asked him to visit eight shrines and temples in her stead to pray for their sons’ success in their exams. He departed immediately. When he returned and reported that he had done as she had asked, Yuku was extremely happy and then quietly breathed her last. “I began to cry as he told me this and was unable to stop.” Nakasone returned to Tokyo but found himself unable to study: “Images of my mother appeared before me, even in my books. I couldn’t concentrate at all, no matter how hard I tried.” His grades declined, and he passed his time listlessly. One day, he snapped back to reality. “What did my mother die for … her last thoughts were of us.” “I felt like a cloud had come crashing down on my head.” “I have undergone many harsh trials in my life since that point, and every time it has been my mother’s love that has urged me to stay strong. I want to be able to offer her my happiness when I visit her grave. It has been with that hope in mind that I have never stopped working.” Nakasone resumed his studies, working hard to make up for lost time. He hoped to enter the Ministry of Home Affairs so as to become involved in national administration. While he felt alarmed by the rise of militarism at home, he also harbored doubts about the Anglo-American style of politics.\n\n10 Nakasone’s Youth In October, Nakasone passed the administrative version of the Higher Civil Service Examination, coming in eighth. He then interviewed with the home ministry, receiving a provisional offer of acceptance. The home ministry was the largest bureaucratic body at the time, handling areas like regional governance, the police, and elections. Attracted by the sophisticated image given off by the navy, Nakasone also applied to and was accepted by the Naval Accounting School in December. After graduating with a degree in political science, Nakasone entered the home ministry in April 1941. Machimura Kingo was serving as director of the ministry’s personnel section when he took his oral exam, and this position was held by Furui Yoshimi at the time that he joined the ministry. Both would go on to become politicians belonging to the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).14\n\nNotes 1 For existing research on Nakasone and his government, see: Muramatsu Michio, “Nakasone Seiken no Seisaku to Seiji,” Revaiasan No. 1 (1987), 11–30; Igarashi Jin, “Nakasone Moto-Shushō in okeru Rīdāshippu no Kenkyū,” Revaiasan No. 5 (1989), 167–82; Iio Jun, Min’eika no Seiji Katei – Rinchō-gata Kaikaku no Seika to Genkai (Tokyo: University of Tokyo, 1993), 41–178; Ōtake Hideo, Jiyūshugi-teki Kaikaku no Jidai – 1980 Nendai Zenhan no Nihon Seiji (Tokyo: Chūō Kōron, 1994), 67–295; Kusano Atsushi, “Nakasone Yasuhiro – Daitōryō-teki Shushō no Menboku,” in Watanabe Kazuo, ed., Sengo Nihon no Saishō-tachi (Tokyo: Chūkō Bunko, 2001), 405–48; Sadō Akihiro, Sengo Nihon no Bōei to Seiji (Tokyo: Yoshikawa Kōbunkan, 2003), 223–69; Takenaka Harukata, “Nakasone Yasuhiro,” in Mikuriya Takashi, ed., Rekidai Shushō Monogatari (Tokyo: Shinshokan, 2003), 228–35; Soeya Yoshihide, Nihon no “Midoru Pawā” Gaikō – Sengo Nihon no Sentaku to Kōsō (Tokyo: Chikuma Shinsho, 2005), 133–65; Nakashima Takuma, “Sengo Nihon no ‘Jishu Bōei’ Ron – Nakasone Yasuhiro no Bōeiron o Chūshin to shite,” Hōgaku Kenkyū 71:4 (2005), 505–35; Nakashima Takuma, “Nakasone Yasuhiro – Reisenki no Nihon Gaikō no Kiketsuten,” in Sadō Akihiro, Komiya Kazuo, and Hattori Ryūji, eds., Jinbutsu de Yomu Gendai Nihon Gaikōshi – Konoe Fumimaro kara Koizumi Jun’ichirō made (Tokyo: Yoshikawa Kōbunkan, 2008), 269–82; Satake Tomohiko, “‘Nakasone Kōsō’ no Saikentō – Bōeichō Chōkan Jidai ni okeru Nakasone Yasuhiro no Bōei Kōsō ni tsuite,” Hōgaku Seijigaku Ronkyū No. 86 (2006), 33–64; Segawa Takao, “Nakasone Seiken no Kaku Gunshuku Gaikō – Kyokutō no Chūkyori Kaku Senryoku (SS-20) Mondai o meguru Himitsu Kōshō,” Keizaigaku Kenkyū 58:3 (2008), 167–81; Segawa Takao, “‘Ron-Yasu’ Jidai no Heiwa to Gunshuku – Shinreisen no Tenkanki ni okeru Nihon no Kadai Settei to Takakuteki Kōshō,” Nenpō Kōkyō Seisakugaku No. 4 (2010), 91–109; Segawa Takao, “Reisen Makki no Nichibei Dōmei Kyōryoku to Kaku Gunshuku – INF Sakugen Kōshō ni Miru ‘Ron-Yasu’ Kankei no Kiketsuten,” Kokusai Seiji No. 163 (2011), 81–95; Tanaka Akihiko and Tadokoro Masayuki, “Shin Jiyūshugi no Jidai – 1980 Nendai,” in Iokibe Makoto, ed., Nichibei Kankei-shi (Tokyo: Yuhikaku, 2008), 266–79; Toyonaga Ikuko, Shin-hoshushugi no Sayō – Nakasone/Burea/Busshu to Seiji no Hen’yō, (Tokyo: Keisō Shobō, 2008), 3–36; Wakatsuki Hidekazu, Taikoku Nihon no Seiji Shidō 1972–1989 (Tokyo: Yoshikawa Kōbunkan, 2012), 170–244; Kanda Yutaka, “1980 Nendai no Reisen to Nihon Gaikō ni okeru Futatsu no Chitsujokan – Nakasone Seiken\n\nNakasone’s Youth 11 no Taichū Gaikō o Jiku to shite,” Ajia Taiheiyō Tōkyū No. 19 (2013), 53–69; Tobe Ryōichi, Kokka Keiei no Honshitsu (Tokyo: Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 2014), 99–134; Satō Susumu, “‘Keizai Taikoku’ Nihon to Ajia – 1980 Nendai,” in Miyagi Taizō, ed., Sengo Nihon no Ajia Gaikō (Tokyo: Minerva Shobō, 2015), 194–204, etc. 2 Nakasone Yasuhiro, Nakasone Yasuhiro ga Kataru Sengo Nihon Gaikō, eds.

As mentioned in the previous chapter, he had been accepted to the school at the same time that he had passed the Higher Civil Service Examination. He had already joined the home ministry, but it was possible at the time for government officials to briefly serve in the navy to gain experience. The “supplementary student” (hoshū gakusei) program was an intensive training course for naval paymasters that was limited to university graduates and those who had passed the civil service exam. Students took on a two-year service commitment and were commissioned as lieutenants (junior grade) after just four months of training. One of Nakasone’s classmates at the school was Hatoyama Iichirō, the eldest son of future prime minister Hatoyama Ichirō. Iichirō had been valedictorian of Tokyo Imperial University’s law department and, like Nakasone, had immediately entered both the civil service and the accounting school upon graduation. Nakasone said of his motives for volunteering for the navy that “while it’s not the reason I joined, I was born on May 27, Navy Day. The navy was more refined than the army, and I had received the impression that it had a broader perspective as well.” The Naval Accounting School was located in Tsukiji, near Kachidoki Bridge. Of Nakasone’s class of 110, 22 would be killed in the war.1\n\nDeparture from Kure After graduating from the Naval Accounting School in August 1941, Nakasone was immediately assigned to the heavy cruiser Aoba (part of the Combined Fleet’s 6th Cruiser Division) as a lieutenant (junior grade) and participated in naval exercises in Tosa Bay off the coast of Shikoku. Nakasone departed the ship in southern Kyushu in mid-November after receiving new orders and headed for the Kure Naval District. The navy had four administrative districts – headquartered in the military ports of Kure, DOI: 10.4324/9781003351931-3\n\n14 Deployment and Defeat Yokosuka, Sasebo, and Maizuru – that exercised jurisdiction over units assigned to them. On November 20, Nakasone was made chief paymaster of the Kure Naval District’s 2nd Construction Party (setsuei-han). Unfamiliar with this term, he inquired about it upon reporting to the chief of staff. The chief of staff gravely answered that it was “a unit tasked with occupying enemy airfields and making them capable of carrying out operations using our aircraft.” This just left Nakasone with more questions: “Where are we going?” “That’s a closely guarded secret. You’ll find out when we depart on the 29th.” “Deploying a large unit is expensive. I need money for our workers’ salaries and to make arrangements for military scrip with which to procure supplies locally. But I can’t make the necessary preparations unless I know where we’re going.” After emphasizing that “This is a military secret. Guard it with your life,” the chief of staff grabbed a pen and wrote down, “Enough for three months in the Philippines and three months in the Dutch East Indies.” After showing the paper to Nakasone, he burned it. Now sure that Japan would finally be going to war, Nakasone made the scrip and staffing arrangements. Nakasone departed from Kure on the evening of November 29 aboard the Taitō Maru (a requisitioned civilian transport) as part of a flotilla of fourteen ships. The ship held naval technicians, doctors, and 1,162 drafted workers. His thoughts as he departed for war were that “I have done everything I could as a Japanese naval officer to prepare for and carry out my duties. I have shown my loyalty to my country in a way that no one else could have.” He brought a copy of the Bible and a recording of Schubert’s Winterreise with him on the voyage. He found himself unconsciously crying as he gave himself over to the rhythm of the engines. Watching the lights of his homeland fade away into the darkness of the late autumn night, he muttered to himself that “All that’s left is the assault.”2\n\nThe Philippines, Dutch East Indies, and Taiwan Nakasone learned of the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 8, 1941, on Palau in the western Pacific. Palau was a trust territory of Japan, and the ships had stopped there to replenish their stores. He nervously thought to himself that “The war’s begun. We’re actually going to have to use that military scrip.” Taitō Maru landed at Davao on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines on December 10. According to Nakasone, “the enemy had wrecked and abandoned an airfield, and we had three days to get it back up and running so that our planes could use it. That’s why we had brought 2,000 drafted workers with us.”\n\nDeployment and Defeat 15 He then participated in the invasion of the Dutch East Indies as part of the Japanese attempt to capture oil fields, landing at Takaran, Borneo, on January 10, 1942, and then at Balikpapan on the 24th. The Taitō Maru was hit by enemy shells during the Battle of Balikpapan and caught fire. Nakasone lost many of his subordinates in the ensuing carnage. “It was sheer hell. Some had had their arms torn off, others had had their heads caved in. The air was filled with the stench of blood and smoke.” On March 10, Nakasone was ordered to Taiwan, so he flew to Takao (Kaohsiung) en route to Magong in the Penghu Islands off the west coast of Taiwan. He was attached to the local naval construction department (kaisetsu-bu) and was promoted to lieutenant in November. In April 1943, he was reassigned to the naval construction department in Takao. His job in Taiwan was preparing airfields against American attacks. Gotōda Masaharu, a man who had entered the home ministry two years before Nakasone and would go on to serve as his chief cabinet secretary, was stationed in Taipei at the time. A captain in the army, he competed with Nakasone in procuring materials in Taiwan: Nakasone joined the home ministry two years after me, although he didn’t really do any work there until after the war because he immediately joined the navy. […] We would occasionally see each other [in Taiwan] at army-navy meetings and the like. There was a shortage of everything, so there was constant fighting between the army and navy over who got supplies. Nakasone was really good at his job. Major Sakawa of our materials section was always yelling, “I can’t do it! That bastard has already grabbed them all!” Nakasone’s wartime experiences served as an opportunity for him to speculate about the relationships between nations, and between people and their nations: There is nothing as fierce as battle, and my harsh wartime experiences became a cornerstone for the way that I lived the rest of my life. They served me well when I returned to the Ministry of Home Affairs after the war. They influenced how I approached people, and how I felt about the general public. Of all Japan’s prime ministers, Nakasone is likely the only one to have come under close enemy fire and lost subordinates to it.3\n\nThe Defeat of Japan and Returning Home On November 1, 1944, Nakasone was reassigned to the 3rd Section of the Ministry of the Navy Procurement Bureau, which was attached to the Yokosuka Naval District. This section would later be divided into the 2nd Section of the Procurement Bureau and the 3rd Section of the Naval Affairs Bureau.\n\n16 Deployment and Defeat He was named adjutant to Captain Hayashi Takayoshi of the 2nd Section of the Procurement Bureau and put in charge of administering Hainan Island off the southern coast of China and countering inflation in Shanghai. The commander of the 3rd Section of the Naval Affairs Bureau was Captain Hamada Yūsei. Hamada’s rise in the ranks had been delayed by poor health, but Nakasone respected him, describing him as “an intellectual humanist.” Nakasone married on February 11, 1945. His bride was Kobayashi Tsutako, daughter of Dr. Kobayashi Giichirō, a geologist, and the younger sister of one of his colleagues in the navy. He asked Ochiai Tatsuji, his former primary school teacher, to act as his go-between in arranging the match, and the wedding was held at Takasaki Shrine. Nakasone warned Tsutako that “my life will be a turbulent one, and I ask that you prepare yourself for that,” to which she answered, “I understand.” On February 25, his younger brother Ryōsuke, a member of the navy’s Kisarazu Air Group, was killed in the line of duty when the plane he was aboard went down in a blizzard in the Suzuka Mountains, killing all eleven passengers. Nakasone was privately informed of the accident in early March by the naval ministry. Because the information was not public, however, he was not permitted to let the rest of his family know. Ryōsuke was later enshrined at Chidorigafuchi National Cemetery before being moved to Yasukuni Shrine. This was one of the reasons that Nakasone would be so insistent about making an official visit to Yasukuni as prime minister. On June 20, Nakasone was transferred to the navy’s Transportation Department and stationed in Takamatsu, where he was to oversee transportation and communications between the Kure Naval District and the kamikaze units being formed around Tosa Bay. His office was located in Kagawa Prefectural Girls High School. Nakasone later stated that he saw smoke rising from the west of Takamatsu on the morning of August 6. He had heard of American efforts to develop an atomic bomb from his father-in-law, and he recalled thinking, as he watched the smoke rise, “So this is the power of an atomic bomb? This will bring an end to the war.” However, given that Takamatsu and Hiroshima are more than 150 kilometers apart and the incident is not mentioned in any of his other accounts, it seems unlikely that he actually saw the Hiroshima mushroom cloud from Takamatsu. The August 15 surrender broadcast was the first time he ever heard the Emperor’s voice. While the reception on his radio was quite poor and filled with static, he understood that the war had been lost and started to cry. According to Nakasone: “Losing the war was frustrating, but I felt that it couldn’t be helped if the Japanese race was to survive. At the same time, I bitterly grieved the fact that our generation had left a large stain on Japanese history. It was that night, as I saw electric lights being used for the first time in years (the blackout restrictions having been lifted) that it hit me: ‘The\n\nDeployment and Defeat 17 war’s over. My life is saved.’” He was promoted to lieutenant commander on September 5.4 Nakasone’s wartime experiences provided the motivation for him to go into politics. He later wrote: I had been born and raised as just a member of the public, but my wartime experiences could be said to have lit a fire under me. The things I felt – Misfortune cannot be inflicted upon the people. The people cannot be betrayed. – later served as the great spiritual motivation for me to become a politician. I believe that they still serve, even now, as my bedrock as a politician. […] I could not stand the idea that those who had spent the war warm and comfortable, looking out for their own safety, could be allowed to govern Japan.5\n\nThe Occupation After being discharged from the navy, Nakasone returned to the home ministry, who assigned him to the Cabinet Research Office on October 22, 1945. His primary duty there was communicating with Eighth Army headquarters under Major General Eichelberger. His direct counterpart was Colonel Bullard, and these Occupation-era negotiations provided his first direct experience with the United States. Bullard was a gentleman who attempted to treat Japanese officials like Nakasone as equals, despite them representing a defeated nation. “I admired every action taken by the American officers, NCOs, and soldiers under Colonel Bullard. Interacting with them made it painfully clear to me that Japan losing should have come as no surprise. Had we won, we would have flaunted our success and treated Asia with contempt.” On November 28, Nakasone invited Bullard to Nikkō. As he entertained the American officer with geisha at an inn on the shore of Lake Chūzenji, his first son Hirofumi was born. When Tsutako complained that “as I suffered in childbirth, you were having a grand old time with the occupying forces and geisha,” Nakasone defended himself by saying that he had “only been doing the business of the nation.” The couple would go on to have two more children, Michiko and Mieko, both daughters. Nakasone also met Robert Fearey, who had been US Ambassador Grew’s secretary at the time that the war began. Now an assistant to Political Advisor in Japan Atcheson, Fearey briefed GHQ on the Japanese political situation. Nakasone got along well with Fearey, and he developed a positive impression of Americans through his work as liaison. He said that they “treated me as another person” rather than looking down on Japan as a defeated nation. But despite these positive impressions, seeds of resentment were also being planted. Around the time of Hirofumi’s birth, GHQ dumped the cyclotron that Nishina Yoshio had developed at Riken into Tokyo Bay. A cyclotron\n\n18 Deployment and Defeat was a device used for the artificial destruction of atomic nuclei and similar tasks, and GHQ had destroyed it as part of the Occupation’s ban on Japanese atomic research. Nakasone wrote that “I was overwhelmed with anger at America [upon learning of the destruction]. Dr. Nishina had used the cyclotron to continue his research on peaceful uses [for the atom]. I felt like America intended to reduce Japan to a fourth-rate agricultural nation.”6\n\nThe Youth Discussion Group Spurred on by the Occupation, Nakasone formed a study group with colleagues at the home ministry like Takahashi Mikio and Hayakawa Takashi in January 1946. They called it the “Youth Discussion Group” (Seinen Konwakai), and Nakasone explained that the motivation behind the group was “gathering young comrades with the goal of rebuilding our homeland.” The group started holding meetings on the second floor of a soba restaurant in Shimbashi, and others gradually began to join, including Ozawa Tatsuo of the home ministry, Higaki Tokutarō of the agricultural ministry, Yoshikuni Jirō of the finance ministry, Nakagawa Yukitsugu of the Bank of Japan, and Akasawa Shōichi of the commerce ministry. The group swelled to twenty members, many of whom, like Nakasone and Hayakawa, would go on to become members of the Diet. Higaki would work toward the privatization of NTT as postal minister in the Nakasone government. Takahashi went on to become commissioner general of the National Police Agency. Yoshikuni would serve as administrative viceminister of finance, and Akasawa as chairman of the Japan External Trade Organization. Nakasone would also use Nakagawa as an economic advisor while prime minister. There were also those from outside of the government, like Gotō Noboru of Tōkyū Railways and Minagawa Hiromune of Mitsubishi. Gotō would arrange food for the group from the black market, and they would all discuss the Occupation’s policies until late in the night. According to Gotō, the group continued its activities after Nakasone entered politics and served as the source for much of Nakasone’s knowledge of economics (a subject he had struggled with): Even back then, Nakasone was an eloquent speaker. When he got drunk, he would make everyone laugh, putting on a headband and dancing along as he sang “Kikori no Uta,” his specialty. […] He continued attending meetings even after becoming a politician. He said that he wanted to “get better at economic issues,” so Nakagawa would explain public finance, Minagawa Hiromune and I would go over current events in the business world, and Akasawa would explain economic policy. This might be the reason that, at some point, he came to be seen as the center the group.\n\nDeployment and Defeat 19 After deciding to go into politics, Nakasone invited his former professor Yabe Teiji to one of the group’s meetings. Yabe had become an advocate of the “returning home” movement (kikyō undo), which called for young people to return to their hometowns and become a force for rebuilding Japan. This somewhat resembled Nakasone’s later founding of the Seiunjuku in Takasaki to serve as a base for the revival of the country. In February 1946, Nakasone became director of the Kagawa Prefecture Police Section. When the Shidehara Kijūrō government scheduled the first postwar election for the House of Representatives for April 10, Nakasone’s home ministry colleague Hayakawa decided to run. In addition to writing him a recommendation, Nakasone also hurried to his district in Wakayama to support his campaign. After Hayakawa was elected, becoming the youngest member of the Diet at the age of twenty-nine, Nakasone wrote his father on April 24. He explained that he wanted to run for national office and that “waiting until after things have settled down would mean having missed my opportunity.” “I can’t stand up to GHQ unless I’m a politician representing the people. There are limits to what I can do as a home ministry official.” Matsugorō opposed the idea, but with Yabe and Hayakawa’s support behind him, Nakasone’s determination remained firm. Hayakawa introduced him to his acquaintances, explaining, “This is my friend Nakasone Yasuhiro from Gunma. He’s definitely going to be elected in the next election. I think you two should talk. He’s a pretty sensible guy.”7\n\nThe Ideals of Youth Nakasone returned home to Takasaki in December 1946 to found a youth organization. When Matsugorō asked him what he would do if he was elected, Nakasone replied, “I will put Japan back on course.” While Matsugorō had initially been opposed to Nakasone running, he ultimately gave him his support, saying, “If you become a Diet member, act like Sakura Sōgorō.” Sakura was a 17th-century village headman famous for illegally appealing directly to the shogun to have the heavy taxes placed on local farmers reduced, something that cost him his life. His father’s words had a lasting impression on Nakasone. He also consulted with Yabe about running.8 On New Year’s Day 1947, Gokoku Shrine in Takasaki was packed with worshippers. Nakasone stood before them and gave his first electoral speech, telling them that he was determined to stand for election one day to bring about the “rebuilding of Japan.” He was a large man, standing 174 cm and weighing 74 kg, so he easily drew the crowd’s attention. He tendered his resignation to the home ministry on January 15. He also submitted an article to the Jōmō Shimbun, a local Gunma newspaper, in which he explained his theory of “young politicians.” In it, he asserted that “history teaches us that it is always the young who are at the\n\n20 Deployment and Defeat forefront of revolutions and restorations” and that “we are living in another great revolutionary period, and people are crying out for the arrival of such young politicians.”9 Nakasone expanded on these ideas in his book The Ideals of Youth, which was published on March 31. In it, he argued that – unless the young rose up – Japan would become an “old and impoverished nation”: Japan must be a nation of the young. In every period of history, when it comes time for a state to grow, it is always the young who act. Look at the history of Japan. The Taika Reforms were carried out by Prince Naka-no-Ōe and Nakatomi no Kamatari, both young men in their twenties. […] In the unlikely event that the youth fail to rise to action, this nation’s great opportunity for rapid progress will be lost and Japan will be doomed to become an old and impoverished nation. Youth was the force that would set Japan right, Nakasone argued, and that youth would come from farming villages. He described Japan as being “like a bean being held by chopsticks. The upper chopstick is the United States, and the other is the Soviet Union. And the force gripping the chopsticks is the Potsdam Declaration.” His language was stiff but fresh, and he sold 43,000 copies despite a paper shortage (although he purchased many of these himself).10\n\nFirst Election Oddly enough, The Ideals of Youth was published on the same day that Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru dissolved the House of Representatives. Nakasone ran not on Yoshida’s Liberal Party ticket, however, but for Ashida Hitoshi’s Democrats. The Liberals were descended from the old prewar Seiyūkai and the newly founded Democratic Party from the Minseitō. Nakasone had been a supporter of the Minseitō before the war, and Kokumatsu had produced a prefectural assembly member for the party. “As I was ideologically opposed to the Seiyūkai, I ultimately decided to run for the Democratic Party rather than the Liberals.” Nakasone used his retirement allowance from the home ministry to purchase a bicycle which he painted white and used to campaign. He chose the color white after the Emperor’s white horse and to represent his opposition to the Reds, noting that “it is the Whites who fight against the extremist Reds.” Communist-affiliated labor unions were attempting to organize a general strike at the time, and Nakasone increased his notoriety by traveling around making speeches in opposition to their efforts. In addition to his bicycle, he also sometimes used a truck from Kokumatsu to travel. Times were favorable for the communists and socialists, but Nakasone took a firmly anti-communist position. He had investigated communist\n\nDeployment and Defeat 21 ideology while at the home ministry and come to the conclusion that it was irreconcilable with Japan’s national character and social structure. But while opposition to communism served as the foundation for Nakasone’s positions, he was not a supporter of laissez-faire economics, either, instead calling for moderate, reformed capitalism: “Ever since running for the Diet, I have advocated for reformed capitalism, that is, the position that a sense of society must be added to ‘laissez-faire et laissez-passer’ and the old liberalism of the Liberal Party. I have deeply pondered the question of what our society would look like if reformed capitalism were applied to our social structure.” After Matsugorō provided him with a rental property to use as a campaign office, passionate supporters began to gather there. He was supported not only by old classmates but by large numbers of young, demobilized military personnel, something that would later lead him to create his Seiunjuku support organization. It was his clear opposition to communism and belief that “rejection of the emperor system is the ideology of a fallen nation” that garnered him so much support among the former military. He also enjoyed the backing of the police and firefighters, so there was little doubt going into the election that he would be elected. In the April 25 general election, Nakasone came in first among the four candidates. He wrote that he would “never forget” 65,484, the number of votes he received. At twenty-eight years old, Nakasone was the youngest person elected in the country, and this marked the first of his twenty successful electoral campaigns. This was also the second election in which women were allowed to vote, and Nakasone seems to have received considerable support from them. He was popular with women because, in addition to being a gifted speaker, he was tall and handsome. Believing that he would receive more votes if he appeared single, he did not have his wife make any public appearances. After the election, Nakasone visited his mother’s grave and made an offering of a certified copy of the election results and a haiku: kono hana o haha ni soetaki ayame kana\n\nI wish to decorate my mother’s grave with this flower an iris, I believe\n\nThe Ayame-kai (Iris Association), a women’s support organization for Nakasone, was formed by women who, upon learning of the poem, decided to “support Nakasone in his mother’s place.” This and the Seiunjuku would serve as his most important support organizations. He earned the ire of Occupation officials by having the Seiunjuku fly the Japanese flag. Now that he had been elected, Nakasone’s initial goal was overcoming the Occupation-era politics symbolized by the new constitution and Yoshida Shigeru and securing true independence for Japan. He departed Takasaki to attend a general meeting of the Democratic Party’s Diet\n\n22 Deployment and Defeat members. The Democratic Party was only the third-largest party in the Diet, however, and proved unable to even decide upon a party president. Realizing that the party lacked the ability to gain support for itself, Nakasone would boldly go forward on his own, gaining the nickname of the “young officer” for himself. These efforts will be examined in the next chapter.11\n\nNotes 1 Nakasone Yasuhiro, Warera Taishōkko (Tokyo: Tokuma Shoten, 1961), 14.

The Socialist Party had made great strides in the election, becoming the largest party in the Diet. Meanwhile, Yoshida Shigeru’s Liberals occupied the second spot, leaving the Democratic Party in third. Among the Socialist Diet members elected for the first time in this election was future LDP president and prime minister Suzuki Zenkō. In the House of Representatives, the Socialists now had 143 seats, the Liberals 131, the Democrats 124, the National Cooperative Party 31, and the Communist Party 4. As there were 466 seats total, no party could secure a majority even if they managed to convince independent Diet members to join them. The Democratic Party had been formed on March 31 through a merger of Shidehara Kijūro’s Japan Progressive Party and Ashida Hitoshi’s faction of the Liberal Party. It had been the largest party in the Diet at the time of its formation but had gone into the general election without a party president and had now fallen to third place. If the party were going to enter into a coalition, it would have to choose between the Liberals and the Socialists. The choice was dependent on the views of Yoshida, the Liberal’s president. This was another point upon which the party – still unable to even choose a president – was divided.\n\nThe “Young Officer” Nakasone departed Takasaki to attend the Democratic Party’s general meeting of its Diet members in Tokyo on May 5. At the meeting, he hit it off with Sakurauchi Yoshio and Sonoda Sunao, both of whom had also just been elected for the first time. Sakurauchi’s father, Yukio, had been an important prewar politician, having served as secretary-general of the Minseitō and finance minister. Sonoda was a former army officer. DOI: 10.4324/9781003351931-4\n\n26 The “Young Officer” Nakasone would frequently interact with Sakurauchi for the rest of his life. He was six years younger than Sakurauchi and five years younger than Sonoda. Another newly elected Democratic Party member present was Tanaka Kakuei, who – like Nakasone – was twenty-eight years old. Tanaka had been born on May 4, 1918, three weeks earlier than Nakasone. The two men’s ways of thinking were opposed from the very start. First, the two men differed on the candidate they supported for the party president. Tanaka had high regard for Shidehara, who was internationally well-known and a former prime minister, but Nakasone saw the “intellectual and young” Ashida as the more suitable candidate. While the fifty-nine-year-old Ashida was significantly younger than the seventy-fouryear-old Shidehara, he had actually had a longer career as a politician. Because Shidehara had been a prominent diplomat before the war, he seemed bureaucratic to Nakasone, another Yoshida. He believed that Ashida, with his rich experience as a party politician, to be more suitable for the position of party president. Nakasone wanted to be rid of the conservatism of prewar politics. Their age was not the only significant difference between Shidehara and Ashida. The critical difference between the two men at this point was who they envisioned as being the best coalition partner. Shidehara had a close relationship with the Liberal Party, and Yoshida had served as foreign minister in his government. Ashida, however, had split off from the Liberals and disliked Yoshida. He believed that a coalition with Katayama Tetsu’s Socialists was possible. Tanaka, who backed Shidehara, was largely comfortable with Yoshida, while Nakasone had strong anti-Yoshida leanings. The party was having difficulty selecting its president. In an attempt to break the deadlock, Nakasone, Sakurauchi, Sonoda, and other young Diet members burst into a meeting of the party leadership and pressured elder statesmen like Hitotsumatsu Sadayoshi and Nagao Tatsuo to make Ashida president. This act was partly motivated by the feeling that it was the politicians remaining from before the war who were responsible for the situation. According to Sakurauchi, their demands were sternly rebuffed – they were told that “the young should keep quiet” – leading to a ferocious back and forth. He wrote that Nakasone was “gallant and brilliant, skilled with both the tongue and the pen, and he immediately became a star of those of a more theoretical bent.” Nakasone and the others became known as the “young officers” (after the young military officers involved in political violence in the 1930s) for their unrestrained conduct and their willingness to disrupt the hierarchy between young and old. When the Democratic Party general congress was held on May 18, 1947, Nakasone got his wish, and Ashida was chosen as president.1\n\nThe “Young Officer” 27\n\n“Rivalry” with Tanaka Kakuei From his first Diet appearance, Nakasone always wore a black tie during the Occupation under the premise that “Japan is in mourning so long as it is occupied.” The Yoshida government resigned en masse on May 20, and a new coalition government led by Socialist Chairman Katayama Tetsu was formed on June 1. Ashida held the position of foreign minister in the new government. The Katayama government worked to get inflation under control and one of its acts was to pass the National Management of the Coal Industry Act. The Democratic Party was divided in its opinion of this law. While Ashida and Nakasone were in favor, Shidehara and Tanaka opposed it and left the party, ultimately merging with Yoshida’s Liberals. There were increasingly strong divisions within the Socialist Party as well, which ultimately led to the government’s resignation and the formation of the Ashida government on March 10, 1948. This would also prove to be shortlived, however, as its members were soon implicated in a corruption scandal involving the chemical company Shōwa Denkō. This was Nakasone’s first, albeit brief, experience of belonging to the government party. When later asked whether he had had a rival, Nakasone suggested Tanaka Kakuei: “It would probably be Tanaka Kakuei since we were first elected to the House of Representatives at the same time. I think that we were both aware that we were following different paths when it came to politics, policies, and ideals. I took up atomic energy; Kaku chose highways. We were both proud men, but we never had any big arguments.” Not only did Nakasone and Tanaka share the same birth month and electoral history, but they also had their offices in the same building for many years: the Subō Kaikan in Hirakawa-chō. Nakasone’s office was on the fourth floor, Tanaka’s on the third. It is debatable whether Tanaka considered Nakasone a worthy opponent, however. Tanaka was the first of the two to hold a cabinet position, the first to serve as LDP secretary-general, and the first to be prime minister. While Nakasone may have become a faction leader before Tanaka, Tanaka’s faction was the largest in the party, twice the size of the Nakasone faction. Probably the only area in which the two could truly be considered equals was in their oratory skills. In a 1981 survey of Diet members, Nakasone came in second in the ranking of politicians who gave the best speeches. The top five spots went to Kaifu Toshiki, Nakasone, Miki Takeo, Tanaka, and Kasuga Ikkō (a former chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party).2\n\nNakasone’s Starting Point in Politics: Opposition to Yoshida When Yoshida returned to the position of prime minister on October 15, 1948, Tanaka – now a member of the Liberal Party – was appointed parliamentary vice-minister of justice despite his lack of seniority. The Yoshida\n\n28 The “Young Officer” government would prove to be long-lived, remaining in place until December 10, 1954. For Nakasone, this meant spending six years and two months in the opposition. Nakasone was critical of the Liberal Party. He believed that “Yoshida is content to merely follow GHQ’s instructions and puts forth no uniquely Japanese ideas.” He said that, while “I didn’t go as far socialism in standing against Yoshida-style liberalism and capitalism, I did highlight reform capitalism and social solidarity.” This was a moderate position (in the sense that it was between Yoshida and the Socialists) and one that he had also advocated for in his first electoral campaign. Nakasone attempted to differentiate his foreign policy from the Liberals by calling for “autonomous defense and independence from America.” He would repeat this call for “autonomous defense” after becoming directorgeneral of the Defense Agency more than a decade later. Nakasone’s starting point as a politician was defined by opposition to Yoshida, and he saw himself as a reform conservative standing in contrast to the conservative mainstream represented by Yoshida, Ikeda Hayato, and Satō Eisaku. His particular opposition to the US-Japan security treaty supported by Yoshida will be discussed later.3 He was also dissatisfied with the Tokyo Trials. He believed that “crimes against peace and civilization are something that have been created ex post facto and in violation of legal principles” and refused to accept “MacArthur’s historical view of the Tokyo Trials.” Nakasone believed that “the great majority of our countrymen drafted into the war fought for the defense of their homeland, and some fought for anti-colonialism and to liberate Asia.” But he did also acknowledge that “while against Britain, America, France, and the Netherlands it had been a normal war, it had an aggressive nature when it came to Asia.”4\n\nTokutomi Sōho As the Tokyo Trials neared their conclusion in the fall of 1948, Nakasone paid several visits to the prominent journalist Tokutomi Sōho. Tokutomi was a relative of Nakasone’s and had been purged by GHQ. Eighty-five years old, he lived in Izusan in Atami, southwest of Tokyo. He had been a proponent of the war, and Nakasone wanted to learn how he was taking Japan’s defeat and what he believed the future held. Wearing traditional Japanese clothing, Tokutomi spoke broadly of the state of the world from his study overlooking Sagami Bay: “China will never become a vassal of the Soviet Union. All the Soviets should expect is betrayal. Mao Zedong may even surpass Tito.” “Join forces with America for the time being. You must remember that Japan is a vulnerability for them right now, one they can’t get rid of no matter what difficulty it causes them.”\n\nThe “Young Officer” 29 Nakasone found Tokutomi’s worldview appealing, and he was surprised by his mental flexibility and ability to come up with new ideas. According to Tokutomi, “Katsu Kaishū once said to ‘follow heaven’s course.’ A politician is not an officer of the Salvation Army. You have no obligation to hold steadfast to ideology or established concepts.” Nakasone would later call this the “advice of the weathervane”: A saying that has given me a lot of courage is “it’s alright to make major compromises so long as you don’t lose sight of the big picture.” Put another way, this could perhaps be called the “advice of the weathervane.” No other words have had a greater impact on how I viewed life. After learning them, I came to view the work of compromise and consensus-building as vital. Nakasone’s interactions with Tokutomi led to him becoming a firm admirer of Katsu Kaishū, a 19th-century statesman and naval officer. He spent his time in the opposition expanding his circle of contacts, visiting, for example, the purged politician Hatoyama Ichirō at his villa in Karuizawa.5\n\nThe National Democratic Party and the “Kitamura School” Inukai Takeru succeeded Ashida as Democratic Party president and began exploring the possibility of a coalition government with Yoshida. These efforts resulted in the party splitting into “coalition” and “opposition” factions in March 1950. Prominent members of the coalition faction (in addition to Inukai) included Hori Shigeru and Kosaka Zentarō. Tomabechi Gizō, Kitamura Tokutarō, Ashida, Nakasone, Sakurauchi, and Inaba Osamu were among those who belonged to the opposition faction. Nakasone and the rest of the opposition faction joined with Miki Takeo’s National Cooperative Party to form the National Democratic Party in April. Tomabechi became the new party’s chairman, and Nakasone was appointed deputy chairman of the Policy Research Council (PRC). Nakasone greatly admired PRC Chairman Kitamura, who was an experienced politician. An upright Christian, he had served as transportation minister in the Katayama government and finance minister in the Ashida government. He was an early advocate for normalizing relations with China (something he shared with Nakasone) and was considered on the far-left side of conservatism. Nakasone, Kawasaki Hideji, Sakurauchi, Sonoda, and Inaba gathered around Kitamura. This was not a large enough group to be considered a Kitamura “faction” and instead served as more a “Kitamura school” for younger members of the party. According to Inaba, Kitamura acted “like the manager of the young officers group.” The National Democratic Party was reorganized into the Reform Party in February 1952 under Shigemitsu Mamoru, but the Kitamura school\n\n30 The “Young Officer” continued its activities. Kōmoto Toshio, Tamura Hajime, and Yamanaka Sadanori would also sometimes join the group. While Nakasone’s time in the opposition was a lengthy one, he did not become discouraged. He later wrote that “when I look back on the time I spent in the opposition, what I realize is that it was the decisions I made then that would determine my later political life.”6\n\nPursuing Rearmament Nakasone remained active, attending the MRA World Congress in Caux, Switzerland, in June 1950. MRA – which stood for “Moral Re-Armament” – was a non-ideological and non-religious peace movement based on the idea of the brotherhood of humanity. Nakasone attended the event in the company of Kitamura. It was while receiving a haircut in Switzerland that Nakasone learned of the outbreak of the Korean War over the radio. He visited West Germany, France, Britain, and America after leaving Switzerland. Germany was divided under the Cold War, and Nakasone paid a courtesy call on Chancellor Adenauer in the West German capital of Bonn. When they met, he said, “I bring greetings from the youth of Japan to the youth of Germany. Do you have any words for the youth of Japan?” Adenauer replied that he would “convey your respects to the youth of Germany” and asked, “How old are you?” When Nakasone answered, “thirty-two,” Adenauer shook his hand and said, “The rebuilding of Japan and Germany will depend on the power of the young. May we do it together.” Nakasone returned to Japan on August 15. During his absence, MacArthur had established the National Police Reserve (NPR) in a letter to Yoshida. While the NPR would have an initial size of 75,000 personnel and was the first step toward Japanese rearmament, Nakasone felt that it was insufficient. It was Ashida who Nakasone would partner with in his fight for rearmament. He visited Kyoto in late October to campaign for the former prime minister. Nakasone was thirty-one years his junior, and it was unusual for a young Diet member to campaign for a former prime minister, but Ashida had been arrested in connection with the Shōwa Denkō scandal. He had been released on bail, but his case was still pending. As they traveled by car from Kyoto to Ayabe, Nakasone brought up the topic of rearmament: Having recently traveled around the world and seen how serious things have become, it has become very clear to me that no independent state can remain unarmed and neutral. Once the Korean War broke out, General MacArthur, who had once told Japan to become the “Switzerland of the Pacific,” frantically moved to create the NPR.\n\nThe “Young Officer” 31 But a nation must willingly exercise its own defense. Even if we enter into an alliance with the United States, Japanese must still undergo an appropriate level of rearmament so that as many American forces leave as possible and American bases are reduced as much as possible. Should we fail to do that, Japan will be forever under occupation by a foreign army and must satisfy itself with being a vassal. Don’t you think so? Ashida agreed. “You’re absolutely right. And since you feel the same way that I do, we should undertake this effort together.” For Ashida, backing rearmament was also part of a gamble for returning to the premiership. The two men’s rearmament plan would later be incorporated into the Reform Party’s platform as an endorsement of the creation of a “democratic self-defense military” (minshuteki jieigun). Ashida’s not guilty verdict would not come until February 11, 1958, however, and he would pass away the following year. Nakasone wrote a lengthy petition to MacArthur on January 23, 1951, arguing that “we have reached a stage where domestic politics and national defense should be carried out on the basis of the responsibility and honor of the Japanese people.” That same day, he argued in favor of rearmament at a rally hosted by the National Democratic Party. He met Dulles on February 2 and sought to have Japan granted permission to construct civil aircraft and investigate the peaceful uses of atomic energy. Dulles was in Japan as a special advisor to President Truman and was consulting with Yoshida on national security and a peace treaty.7\n\nWorking with Former Naval Personnel A distinctive characteristic of Nakasone’s promotion of rearmament was his contact with former naval personnel. Around the same time that Dulles came to Japan, he was carrying out “research on the establishment of a defense force” with former Vice Admiral Hoshina Zenshirō, former director of the Bureau of Naval Affairs, and former Captain Ōi Atsushi. He also invited Nomura Kichisaburō, an old hand with the navy and former foreign minister and ambassador to the United States, and Fukudome Shigeru, former chief of staff of the Combined Fleet, to join the study group. Most of the participants in the group were former naval officers; Nakasone was the only Diet member. He explained that he “didn’t approach other legislators because I knew that national defense and defense issues were touchy issues. [Participating] would have hurt their reelection chances.” Nakasone’s primary interest was “correcting the shortcomings of Article 9” of the new constitution. With that point in mind, he gathered young Diet members from both government and opposition parties and held the first meeting of the Independent Defense Study Group on March 1. Thirteen of those invited participated, including Ishida Hirohide, Kawasaki,\n\n32 The “Young Officer” Sakurauchi, Sonoda, and Inaba, and the men discussed the basic requirements for a peace treaty in a non-partisan fashion. Nakasone would continue to discuss defense issues with Hoshina and Fukudome even after the San Francisco Peace Treaty was signed.8\n\nClashing with Yoshida Yoshida concluded peace and security treaties with the United States in San Francisco, and these were passed by the House of Representatives on October 26, 1951. Nakasone voted in favor of the peace treaty but abstained on the security treaty as objected to the lack of an expiration date and the granting of the right to intervene in domestic disturbances to the US under the terms of the treaty. He was also dissatisfied with the fact that Japan had no right to try American military personnel under the US-Japan administrative agreement. According to one newspaper reporter, Nakasone took a strong stand against the treaty at the Democratic Party’s congress, going so far as to say that “[The Democratic Party] cannot share responsibility for such a disgraceful treaty. The United States caused untold damage to the Japanese people through its indiscriminate bombing, and we should demand reparations.” Nakasone’s criticism of Yoshida reached its peak at the January 31, 1952 meeting of the House of Representatives’ Budget Committee. During the meeting, he criticized a letter that Yoshida had sent Dulles (in which he said that Japan would establish relations with Taiwan rather than China) as “bureaucratic secret diplomacy” and raised doubts about the constitutionality of the NPR. Nakasone had carried out an inspection of the NPR in preparation for the meeting. Yoshida did not respond to Nakasone’s accusations directly, however, leaving most of the testimony to State Minister Okazaki Katsuo and Finance Minister Ikeda Hayato. Growing irritated, Nakasone yelled at Yoshida: “Don’t you have the confidence to testify for yourself? You should resign from the cabinet.” The exchange seemed to be going in Nakasone’s favor. That would rapidly change after he referenced the Emperor’s abdication, however. After discussing the Emperor’s possible “human distress” over the war and the “external restraints” placed on that distress by his position, he noted that “I believe that it may be necessary to tell the Emperor that, should he have the desire [to abdicate], that we would do away with his distress” and then asked Yoshida for the government’s position. Yoshida’s cheeks quivered as he turned to answer. “For His Majesty to abdicate would harm the stability of the nation. I would regard anyone who desired such a thing as a traitor.” Nakasone’s intention had been for the matter to be left for the Emperor to freely decide, but Yoshida had misunderstood him as promoting abdication. This time it was Yoshida’s response which drew applause from the room.9\n\nThe “Young Officer” 33\n\nFormation of the Reform Party and the Reformist Faction On February 8, 1952, Nakasone participated in the formation of the Reform Party, the successor to the National Democratic Party. This effort involved a number of formerly purged figures who had now been permitted to return to politics, such as Shigemitsu Mamoru, Matsumura Kenzō, Ōasa Tadao, Nakajima Yadanji, and Miyazawa Taneo. Former foreign minister Shigemitsu was chosen as the party’s first president, and Matsumura became secretary-general. As a member of the preparatory committee for the party’s formation, Nakasone (along with others like Kawasaki Hideji) was involved in drafting the party platform. Looking at that platform, there are two clauses that stand out: those concerning “independent defense” (dokuritsu jiei) and “corporatism” (kyōdōshugi): • •\n\n“Our party will accomplish the independent defense of the Japanese people in anticipation of the realization of world peace and the revival of Asia.” “Based on the ideal of corporatism, our party will correct capitalism and promote the welfare of the general Japanese public.”\n\nIn terms of specific policies, the platform called for the creation of a “democratic self-defense force” and the reexamination of the constitution and existing laws. Its goal was the rectification of Yoshida’s Occupationera policies. The Reform Party consisted of four factions: the “presidential faction” including men like Matsumura and Ōasa, the “reform faction” with Miki Takeo, Kitamura, Kawasaki, and Nakasone, the “moderate faction” with Furui Yoshimi and Machimura Kingo, and the Ashida faction with Ashida and Araki Masuo. The reform faction drew from former members of the National Cooperative Party like Miki and younger members of the former Democratic Party like Nakasone. While Nakasone belonged to the reform faction, he greatly admired Matsumura of the presidential faction. He was impressed by his character and good judgment, and he assumed the role of his pupil. “Matsumura had served as welfare minister in Prince Higashikuni’s cabinet that was formed immediately after the end of the war. He was very much our senior, but he still took great care to foster the careers of young politicians. I felt an obligation towards him.” He was particularly inspired by Matsumura’s views on China. According to Nakasone, “Matsumura wanted relations restored with China quickly, and he was ready to sacrifice himself for Sino-Japanese friendship. […] His views on the importance of China were largely the same as my own.” Matsumura also saw great things in Nakasone’s future, and when Nakasone formed his own faction, later on, he asked Diet Member Tagawa Seiichi to “please assist Nakasone.”10\n\n34 The “Young Officer”\n\nAn “Explosive Question” Now a member of the Reform Party, Nakasone demanded answers from Transportation Minister Ishii Mitsujirō and State Minister Ōno Banboku on the ongoing shipbuilding scandal at the February 22, 1954 session of the House of Representatives’ Budget Committee. Prefacing his words by saying that “my words are based on indisputable sources, and I will take political responsibility if they are incorrect,” he accused Ishii and Ōno of having received one million yen from Namura Shipbuilding and called for the entire Yoshida government to resign. Deputy Prime Minister Ogata Taketora denied this, saying that no cabinet minister was involved in the scandal. Nakasone’s “explosive question” damaged the perception of innocence of not only Ishii and Ōno but that of Finance Minister Ikeda and Liberal Party Secretary-General Satō Eisaku as well. His actions here would be an indirect cause of the lengthy wait Nakasone would have to endure before he was finally able to join the cabinet during the Satō government.11 The Reform Party leadership also took a dim view of Nakasone’s grandstanding. Secretary-General Matsumura had attempted to dissuade him from making his attack on the government only to be brushed off, and President Shigemitsu criticized the actions in his journal: Secretary-General Matsumura’s attempt to stop him had no effect, and Diet Member Nakasone exposed corruption (and the involvement of cabinet members therein) at the Budget Committee. His arguments were not convincing, and his statements will bring misfortune. We need to avoid excessively antagonizing the Liberal Party. Those like Nakasone act as if the point of Diet testimony is to come up with something, anything, that can be used as fodder for the newspapers. No matter how many years pass, he will make no progress as a Diet member. Truly regrettable. Nakasone would continue to have a reputation for grandstanding when serving as director-general of the Defense Agency and prime minister as well. As can be seen from Shigemitsu’s words, these criticisms were being made from early on in his career, even by those within the same party.12\n\nThe “Jōshū War” with Fukuda Takeo Nakasone steadily built up his political career during this period, winning reelection in the January 23, 1949 and October 1, 1952 general elections. In the 1952 election, Fukuda Takeo, former director of the finance ministry’s Budget Bureau, ran as a candidate in the same district as Nakasone (Gunma 3rd) and came in second. Ōhira Masayoshi, another former finance ministry official who had served as Ikeda’s secretary while he was finance\n\nThe “Young Officer” 35 minister, was also elected for the first time in this election, albeit in Kagawa 2nd district. Both Fukuda and Ōhira would go on to become faction leaders in the LDP, but Nakasone needed to be particularly aware of Fukuda as they served the same district. Fukuda had been born in 1905, so he was thirteen years older than Nakasone. Like Nakasone, he was a graduate of both Takasaki Middle School and Tokyo Imperial University. His expertise in economic policy led to him frequently referred to as “Economic Fukuda.” Nakasone had already seen himself as having a rival in Tanaka, but he now faced a strong opponent in his electoral district as well. The electoral battles between Nakasone and Fukuda were intense and became commonly known as the “Jōshū War” (after an old name for Gunma). Fukuda would inherit Kishi Nobusuke’s faction in 1962, and Nakasone would later describe his relationship with Fukuda as having been part of his opposition to the “prewar bureaucrats”: There was antagonism between the prewar bureaucrats and the young politicians who had gone into politics after experiencing the war. Fukuda received most of his support from businessmen and those involved in the economy. But I received my support from young housewives and those that could in a sense be considered intellectuals. I was very aware of the generational divisions that existed without the prefecture’s population. […] In making his appeals to the people of Gunma and the nation, Fukuda generally concentrated on economics and fiscal policy. I focused on more fundamental national issues like education, administrative reform, and constitutional revision. The issues that Nakasone devoted himself to like direct election of the prime minister, foreign policy, national security, and atomic energy, were things that were relevant nationally more than they were specific to Gunma.13\n\nGunma 3rd How did the people of Gunma view the relationship between Nakasone and Fukuda? I would like to take a look at a special feature run by the Jōmō Shimbun on January 1, 1966 to provide some insight on this question. The newspaper had arrange"
