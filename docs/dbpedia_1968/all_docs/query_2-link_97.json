        "text": "The National High School Ekiden took place Dec. 25 in Kyoto with a live nationwide ad-free broadcast on NHK. In the girls' race, Nagano Higashi H.S. ran a perfect second half to run down 2021 national champ Sendai Ikuei H.S. on the anchor stage for its first-ever national title. In the boys' race, Kurashiki H.S. broke the overall course record by 8 seconds to win for the 3rd time in the race's 73-year history, with runner-up Saku Chosei H.S. running the fastest-ever time by an all-Japanese team thanks in large part to a brilliant run from 5000 m H.S. NR holder Hiroto Yoshioka.\n\n7th last year, the Nagano Higashi girls got off to a good start with leading runner Kanoko Nawa 4th and just 6 seconds off the lead. Sendai Ikuei's Daisy Jerop put the defending champs into the lead on the second leg, with its next two runners Misaki Nagaoka and Kurea Watanabe holding that position. But a stage win from Nagano Higashi's fourth runner Yuka Sato cut Sendai Ikuei's lead from 17 to 14 seconds, putting anchor Miku Muraoka in position to run down Sendai Ikuei's Aoi Hosokawa midway through the 5.0 km final stage.\n\nMuraoka was superb, finishing 3rd on stage time in 15:45 as the only Japanese runner to break 16 minutes. Post-race she said that she had just focused on what was ahead of her, not the Kenyans, including stage winner Caroline Kariba of 2018 national champ Kamimura Gakuen H.S., who were behind her.\n\nNagano Higashi covered the complete 5-stage, 21.0975 km course in 1:07:37 to become the first girls' team from Nagano prefecture ever to take the national title. Sendai Ikuei was next in 1:07:51, with Kamimura Gakuen 3rd in 1:08:03 after spending the entire race recovering from a shaky start by lead runner Airi Tashima. Last year's runner-up Kunei Joshi Gakuin H.S. was 6th in 1:08:42 after leading the first leg thanks to a great run from Kana Mizumoto.\n\n9 teams broke 70 minutes, matching last year's high-quality results. In a freak statistical happening, runners from 3 girls-only high schools, 5th-place Hakuho Joshi H.S., 6th-place Kunei Joshi Gakuin, and 7th-place Chikushi Joshi Gakuen H.S., ran exactly the same times, 10:01, on the 3.0 km third leg, followed by their next runners all clocking 9:27 on the 3.0 km fourth leg. What are the chances?\n\nLike Nagano Higashi having placed 7th last year, Nishiwaki Kogyo H.S. had a solid start thanks to a 29:11 stage win on the 10.0 km first stage by the ambitious Sonata Nagashima. Nishiwaki Kogyo's second runner Iori Oda held on to the lead, but third runner Daichi Fujita was caught by Yoshioka, who said pre-race that his goal was to become the first Japanese-born runner to break 23 minutes on the 8.1075 km stage. Yoshioka's lead was short-lived, though, as he was overtaken by Kurashiki's Samuel Kibathi, who broke the CR in his ekiden debut with a stellar 22:30, 9 seconds under the old record. Yoshioka couldn't hang with that, but true to his word he clocked 22:51, 19 seconds faster than the previous best-ever time by a Japanese runner on the stage and faster than the 6 other Kenyans on the stage.\n\nKurashiki's fourth runner Shunsuke Kuwata started with a 15-second lead over Saku Chosei's Shunpei Yamaguchi and delivered a crucial stage win to extend the team's lead to 29 seconds. From there it was a race against the clock, not just a new CR for the overall 7-stage, 42.195 km course but the first ever sub-2:01:00 looking like it may be in the cards. Kurashiki didn't quite get to that point, but anchor Aoi Higaki still brought them home 8 seconds under the old record in 2:01:10, close enough to make it clear that a 2:00:** is on the horizon and to raise the possibility of a sub-2 hour winning time at some point not too far away in the future.\n\nAfter Yoshioka was run down by Kibathi Saku Chosei stayed in 2nd the entire way, unable to catch Kurashiki for the win but still in pursuit of another achievement, the fastest-ever time by an all-Japanese team. That mark, 2:01:59, was set last year by local Rakunan H.S. with then-3rd-year U20 5000 m NR holder Keita Sato running the previous fastest-ever JPN-born third leg time, 23:10. Saku Chosei anchor Haruto Matsuo had the weakest run on the team, only 9th on stage time, but just made it, crossing the line in 2:01:57 to bring the all-Japanese distinction back to Saku Chosei. Yoshioka beating Sato's stage time was the icing on the cake.\n\nYachiyo Shoin H.S. overcame a mid-stage fall by leading runner Kazuki Aya to take 3rd in 2:02:18, the team's best-ever performance. Along with a stage win from anchor Aimu Tanaka, Yachiyo Shoin's third runner Shinsaku Kudo was especially strong, finishing 5th in 23:31, just 21 seconds off Keita Sato's old record. Head coach Masato Otsuka was proud of his team, giving them a rating of \"100%!\" post-race.\n\n5th in 2:03:51, combined with its girls' 2nd-place finish Sendai Ikuei H.S. confirmed its position as the best all-around high school ekiden program in the country. Early leader Nishiwaki Koryo fell to 6th in 2:04:16, with Rakunan 7th in 2:04:37. 8th-place Gakuho Ishikawa H.S. got under 2:05 in 2:04:46, the only other school to put both its girls and boys in the top 10. 2-time defending champ Sera H.S. was a non-factor, never in the top 12 and ultimately finishing 14th in 2:06:24.\n\nNational High School Ekiden\n\nKyoto, 25 Dec. 2022\n\nGirls\n\n47 teams, 5 stages, 21.0975 km\n\nTop Individual Stage Results\n\nFirst Stage (6.0 km) - Kana Mizumoto (Kunei Joshi Gakuin H.S.) - 19:20\n\nSecond Stage (4.0975 km) - Rose Wangui (Sera) - 12:31\n\nThird Stage (3.0 km) - Aiko Hosoya (Ritsumeikan Uji H.S.) - 9:41\n\nFourth Stage (3.0 km) - Yuka Sato (Nagano Higashi H.S.) - 9:18\n\nFifth Stage (5.0 km) - Caroline Kariba (Kamimura Gakuen H.S.) - 15:09\n\nTop Team Results\n\n1.

Both running their debuts, Kamulu and Shiho Tachizako ran steadily around 2:28-flat pace surrounded by a group of amateur men, staying together until just before 30 km when Tachizako started to fade. Kamulu struggled with the hot conditions late in the race and could only watch the clock as sub-2:30 slipped away, looking very tired as she crossed the finish line in 2:31:04. Tachizako faded to 2:33:47 for 2nd, but even that was good enough to easily beat the rest of the field, with last year's 2nd-placer Ayano Ikeuchi 3rd in 2:35:26 in her third marathon so far this year. Nakamura had said pre-race that he didn't care about time and was only focused on getting in the win, and that was exactly ho\n\nA 20-year-old man has been arrested on charges of sexually assaulting a female runner along the banks of the Tama River in Ota Ward, Tokyo. \"I've been stuck at home because of the coronavirus, so I wanted to go for a walk and move my body a bit,\" the man told police. Local resident Hirai Muroyama , 20, of no known occupation, was arrested on charges of sexual assault. He is accused of acts including grabbing the breasts of a woman in her 20s at around 10 p.m. on May 31 along the banks of the Tama River. According to police, the woman was taking a break in her run when Muroyama approached her silently from behind and grabbed her breasts before running away. Under police interrogation Muroyama told investigators, \"I've been stuck at home because of the coronavirus, so I wanted to go out for a walk and move my body. I'd had a few drinks and was feeling pretty hype. She was totally my type.\" source article: https://news.tbs.co.jp/newseye/tbs_newsey\n\nThe Paris Olympics have just ended and the Paralympics are set to kick off next week on the 28th, but the focus is already shifting to the Los Angeles Olympics 4 years down the road. International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach , 70, will step down from his position at the end of his term next June. The word is that IOC member Morinari Watanabe , 65, president of the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG), is planning to run in the election for Bach's successor in March. If elected, Watanabe would become the first Japanese head of the IOC. While Bach was a gold medalist in the men's fencing team competition at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, Watanabe never competed at the Olympics let alone medaled. After joining the Jusco retail chain in 1984, he worked as a salaryman office worker for the Aeon Group, Jusco's renamed parent corporation and served as director of the Japan Gymnastic Association. In 2017 he became FIG's first Asian president. Under Watanabe&"
