        "text": "There's a guy on Twitter named George Bennett who periodically tweets out photos of \"carpets o'cards\" - a group of baseball cards laid out that share some sort of theme. He did one a while back with all the 500 home run hitters from MLB arranged by the number of at bats it took them to reach the milestone. I was inspired to emulate him with all the 500 home run hitters from NPB. I arranged them in chronological order of them reaching the milestone though, mostly because I wasn't sure I could find the at bat totals.\n\nI wanted to use a card from the same year that the player hit home run number 500 but that wasn't possible in the case of Katsuya Nomura and Sadaharu Oh as I don't have any cards from 1971 or 1972 respectively (there's a dry period in Japanese baseball card history between the end of menko in 1964 and the start of Calbee in 1973 where there were very few cards published). And I have to admit to being surprised that Nomura reached 500 home runs before Oh did. I don't think Oh passed Nomura for the career home run lead until 1973 or 1974.\n\nHere's each card along with the date the player got his 500th home run:\n\nKatsuya Nomura, July 2, 1971\n\n1975/76/77 Calbee #1113\n\nSadaharu Oh, June 6, 1972\n\n1973 Calbee #7\n\nIsao Harimoto, September 28, 1980\n\n1980 Yamakatsu JY12\n\nKoji Yamamoto, July 26, 1985\n\n1985 Calbee #192\n\nSachio Kinugasa, August 11, 1987\n\n1987 Play Ball #9\n\nHiromitsu Kadota, August 15, 1989\n\n1989 Lotte #40\n\nHiromitsu Ochiai, July 3, 1996\n\n1996 BBM #318\n\nKazuhiro Kiyohara, April 29, 2005\n\n2005 Calbee #049\n\nHideki Matsui, July 20, 2011\n\n2011 BBM Hometown Heroes #013\n\nMatsui's total includes the 332 home runs he hit in Japan and the 175 he hit in MLB. He was playing for the Oakland Athletics when he hit #500 but I'm showing him in a Yomiuri uniform on a card issued in 2011 (or at least with a cover date of 2011 - the set was actually released in late 2010).\n\nI want to do a quick post to get caught up on the sets that have been announced in the last month or so.\n\n- BBM's annual \"Rookie Edition Premium\" set will be released in late October. As usual this is a box set containing 38 cards - a 36 card base set plus two \"premium\" cards. The base set contains three \"rookies\" for each of the 12 teams - in this case \"rookie\" means 2020 draft pick so think Teruaki Satoh, Hiromi Itoh, Takahisa Hayakawa and Ryoji Kurabashi and not Hiroya Miyagi. The two \"premium\" cards are either autograph or memorabilia cards. It is limited to 3000 sets and unopened boxes retail for 16,500 yen ($150).\n\n- BBM is issuing yet another in their \"History\" line of OB team sets. This next one is called \"Tigers History 1935-2021\" and is the fifth \"History\" set overall and third this year. The base set will contain 90 cards (just like the other four sets) which will be split into a \"Tigers History\" subset (7 cards), the Tigers OB players (71 cards) and the subset for active Tigers players (12 cards). There are two non-premium insert sets - \"Legend Of Tigers\" (12 cards) and \"Team Records\" (9 cards) - along with four premium ones - \"Phantom\" (24 cards), \"Cross Foil Signing\" (27 cards), \"Combo Cross Foil Signing\" (6 cards) and \"Triple Cross Foil Signing\". Note that the \"Cross Foil Signing\" cards have facsimile signatures - there are also real autograph cards available as well. The set will be in stores in late October, making it three months in a row that BBM has released one of these \"History\" sets (the Dragons in August followed by the Marines in September).\n\n- Baseball Magazine Sha, BBM's publisher, started publishing magazines in 1946. BBM published a multi-sport set called \"Masterpiece\" in the fall of 2016 to celebrate the company's 70th Anniversary. In the fall of each of the following years BBM published another multi-sport set called \"Infinity\". Since the company is celebrating their 75th Anniversary this year, BBM has switched back to the \"Masterpiece\" name for this year's multi-sport set. There isn't a great deal of information out about this year's set though - I don't know how big the set is or what the inserts are (although it looks like there will be 3D cards along with the \"Phantom\" cards). It also looks like there will be autograph cards available. The list of baseball players includes both OB and active players. One name that pops out to me is Warren Cromartie, who hardly ever shows up in OB sets. Other sports features in the set include professional wrestling, boxing, soccer, ice hockey, tennis, rugby, softball, judo, badminton, bowling, gymnastics, volleyball, basketball, table tennis, fencing, archery, skateboarding and horse racing. The set will out in mid-November.\n\n- Epoch has announced four more of their ultra high-end combination OB/active player team sets called \"Stars & Legends\". The teams are the Hawks (out on October 16th), the Lions (October 30th), the Carp (November 6th) and the Giants (November 13th). I believe that the boxes for the sets will retail for 16,500 yen ($150) and will contain four cards (and I think at least one of those is an autograph). The Hawks base set has 44 cards, the Lions base set has 45 cards, the Carp base set has 56 cards and the Giants base set has 52 cards. I think all the base cards are serially numbered. Each set features the same five insert sets - \"Decomori Signature Black Vision (Gold)\" (three cards each numbered to 15), \"Decomori Signature Black Vision (Green)\" (three cards each numbered to 5), \"Decomori Signature Black Vision (Hologram)\" (three 1-of-1 cards), \"Gem\" (six cards numbered to 15), and \"Black Gem\" (six cards also numbered to 15). There's a number of different types of autograph cards available in each set and I think the Hawks and Carp sets have memorabilia cards available as well. The Giants set has a variety of game used bat cards available.\n\nTen years ago this month BBM released their latest collegiate set, the Tokyo Big Six Autumn Version set. It was their ninth collegiate set and the eighth to feature the Tokyo Big Six. This would be the last set for the league that BBM would issue during the league's Fall season - the remaining sets would all be released in the spring.\n\nThe set contained 37 cards - a 36 card base set plus one of 12 possible insert cards. The insert cards were either one of six \"Tokyo Big 6 Heroes\" cards (one active player per school) or one of six \"Tokyo Big 6 Legends\" cards (one OB player per school). For the first time the base set did not include team cards so all 36 cards were player cards (six per team).\n\nOf those 36 players, eight would go on to play in NPB. Five of those eight had been featured in one or more of the previous Tokyo Big Six sets. Seven of the eight players are still active although only five are currently playing in NPB. Kohei Arihara is the first player featured in one of BBM's collegiate sets to go on to play in MLB.\n\nThis set marks the final appearance in a collegiate set for Yusuke Nomura. I've frequently suggested that BBM started doing collegiate sets so that they could make cards of Yuki Saitoh but an argument could be made (although not a particularly serious one) that they wanted to make cards of Nomura instead. Nomura had cards in seven of BBM's first eight Tokyo Big Six sets - he had the most cards of any player in the sets. (Saitoh had five cards which tied him for third place with nine other players. The player with the second most cards, Keisuke Okazaki of Rikkio, never played in NPB. His final collegiate card was also in this set.)\n\nHere's the list of future NPB players from the set:\n\nPlayer College Year Drafted Notes Arihara, Kohei Waseda 1 2014 Fighters 1st Played for Fighters 2015-2020, Texas Rangers 2021-present. 2015 Rookie Of The Year.

I'm also showing Mikami's \"Tokyo Big Six Heroes\" card since I pulled that from the box I bought. Itoh and Shimauchi also had cards in that insert set but I don't have those.\n\n2011 BBM Tokyo Big Six Autumn Version #26\n\n2020 BBM 1st Version #111\n\n2011 BBM Tokyo Big Six Autumn Version #02\n\n2021 Epoch NPB #297\n\n2011 BBM Tokyo Big Six Autumn Version #29\n\n2012 Front Runner Carp Starting Lineup #18\n\n2011 BBM Tokyo Big Six Autumn Version #05\n\n2018 BBM Tigers #T63\n\n2011 BBM Tokyo Big Six Autumn Version #13\n\n2011 BBM Tokyo Big Six Autumn Version #SP03\n\n2019 Calbee Samurai Japan #SJ-14\n\n2011 BBM Tokyo Big Six Autumn Version #19\n\n2021 Calbee #136\n\n2011 BBM Tokyo Big Six Autumn Version #22\n\n2021 BBM 2nd Version #443\n\n2011 BBM Tokyo Big Six Autumn Version #27\n\n2021 BBM 1st Version #171\n\nFour of the other 28 players in this set - Naoki Harada of Hosei, Masaki Miyamoto of Keio, Yuji Naka of Rikkio and Ikuhiro Takeda of Meiji - had their only cards ever in this set. The other 24 players appear in at least one other collegiate set - Naoki Agata (Keio), Yota Hirahara (Rikkio), Ryosuke Itoh (Hosei), Shuhei Iwasaki (Tokyo), Yuki Jibiki (Waseda), Junishi Katori (Tokyo), Kenji Kawabe (Meiji), Kanji Kawai (Meiji), Masato Komura (Rikkio), Koichiro Matsumoto (Rikkio), Masataka Nakamura (Meiji), Hiroshi Nakashima (Meiji), Kensuke Ohno (Waseda), Keisuke Okazaki (Rikkio), Hayato Saitoh (Rikkio), Koki Sasaki (Waseda), Shota Suzuki (Tokyo), Yohei Tachi (Tokyo), Hisanori Takayama (Tokyo), Daisuke Takeuchi (Keio), Hiroshi Taki (Hosei), Kento Tatebe (Hosei), Shota Utsumi (Tokyo), and Ren Yamasaki (Keio).\n\nFormer Hiroshima Carp outfielder Satoshi \"Fibber\" Hirayama passed away earlier this week at age 91. Hirayama was born in Exeter, California to Japanese immigrant parents. He spent several years during World War II interred in the Poston War Relocation Center in Arizona. He was a star athlete at both football and baseball at Fresno State and signed with the St Louis Browns after graduating. He played one season with Stockton in the California League in 1952 before drafted into the Army. Upon discharge he signed with the Carp at the urging of legendary Japanese-American baseball figure Kenichi Zenimura.\n\nHirayama was one of the first of the nisei Japanese-Americans who played in NPB during the 1950's and early 1960's. He had a 10 year career with the Carp from 1955 to 1964 and made the All Star team twice (1956 and 1958). His career was cut short by injury - he suffered nerve damage after running into a wall that damaged the vision in his right eye. He coached for the Carp for one year after his playing days were over and later scouted for both the Angels and Carp. He also had a stint running the Carp's Dominican Academy.\n\nThere are no modern cards of Hirayama available - other than Wally Yonamine the nisei players from the 1950's have pretty much been ignored in BBM and Epoch's OB sets - but he had several menko, bromide and gum cards during his playing career. Here are the only two that I have:\n\n1958 \"Who Am I?\" menko (JCM 54)\n\n1959 JBR 5"
