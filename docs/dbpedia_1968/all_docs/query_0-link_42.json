General B. Notes on Selection and Annotation C. History of the Disciplines D. Acknowledgements A. GENERAL This compilation appears to have no precursors. Neither Japanese nor foreign bibliographers have made any broad, systematic collections of available literature on Japan in the various areas of sociological interest. A very few special-area bibliographies exist, as on family structure and demography, and the Bibliography of Japanese Anthropology and Archeology (Bibliographical Series No. 3 ) offers a rather sketchy general selection,in its sections on Japan; otherwise, students must make do with entries -- variably classified -- in works of much wider scope or with library catalogs. To account for this paucity, we must recall that sociological disciplines are not very long established in Japan nor too widespread for informal channels to serve most needs. But such informal channels inevitably begin to fail as research contributions accumulate and the discipline enlarges. As an initial survey, thus, this broadly planned contribution may be useful to Japanese scholars. But it was first conceived and subsequently carried through mainly to serve non-Japanese researchers in sociology and social anthropology of Japan. This Guide presents a broad though selective sample of materials in the several areas of empirical research in which Japanese scholars have been active, with particular attention to the two decades from 1945 to 1966, and with commentary on each entry. In all these respects it follows patterns established for -he Bibliographical Series of the University of Michigan Center for Japanese Studies, in which it takes its place; but, unlike Guides in older disciplines, it covers journal articles as well as books and monographs. Compilation began modestly when the late Professor Okada Yuzuru, chairing the Department of Sociology at the Tokyo University of Education, was in residence as a visiting scholar at the Center for Japanese Studies. He began by calling attention of colleagues and graduate students to materials relevant to their projects. He then expanded this effort into a preliminary survey of literature, especially on family structure and demography. Following him as visiting scholar, Professor Morioka Kiyomi, of the same Department of Sociology, took over the present writer's efforts to update and expand the unpublished Okada compilation. Professor Morioka drew materials from his own extensive bibliography on family structure but also, to accommodate JaDan-area student interests in other aspects of sociology and social anthropology, he compiled materials on various other subjects. At this point the advantage of carrying through a more extensive project and of doing so in Japan became evident. Professor Nakano Takashi in 1964 graciously accepted the task of building on the nucleus gathered by his-colleagues and, from his home base in the sociology department at the Tokyo University of Education, supervised the systematic selection and annotation of materials during the next two years. At this stage he established the final plan to present, in balanced coverage, an up-to-date selection of research materials, taking account both of the state of sociology and related disciplines in Japan and of principal lines of interest abroad. Together we revised and added categories as materials came to light from the period under closest scrutiny, 1946-1966. Decisions as to limits, organization, and format were were made jointly by both compilers; while Nakano held main responsibility for searching out materials and annotating them in Japanese and for authoritative transliteration of authors' names insofar as might be possible, Beardsley had main charge of all translation and of final annotation in English. We address persons in sociology and social anthropology as these fields are defined outside of Japan. Very few Japanese wear the label \"social anthropologist.\" There are sociologists, ethnologists, and folklorists, all of whom carry out fieldwork at home that is essentially the sort of research a foreign social anthropplogist or sociologist would do in Japan. We trust that in an era of increased multidisciplinary research, especially in such societies as Japan, this compilation will have value to persons in other disciplines. The title of this Guide designates its contents from the viewpoint of American and other Western scholars, but we have attempted to follow a comfortably lenient and inclusive definition of the appropriate scope of contents. A large proportion of users, we.hope, will be students just embarking on a research career who may not yet have settled definitely on a fruitful and appealing subject. This compilation offers many intriguing phenomena that have not been fully treated by Japanese researchers, and even more that receive scarcely passing mention in Japanese studies abroad despite intensive attention on the part of Japanese scholars. Newcomers to research on Japan are urged to browse through the entries, perhaps unexpectedly to discover a i\n\nPage II COMPILER'S INTRODUCTION subject exactly to their taste; or, in any event, to avoid waste of time duplicating data already accumulated in Japanese. All too few persons have acquired the skills needed for research, in comparison with the countless problems offered in the many changing dimensions of Japanese society. Far better to unlock portions of the Japanese sociological storehouse to the outer world and then push on to original work on real and important problems, rather than replicate work well enough done already or fail to be aware of what Japanese phenomena may contribute along the advancing frontier of one's discipline. B. NOTES ON SELECTION AND ANNOTATION Our purpose is to serve immediate research interests of empirical nature, especially those calling for fieldwork. This purpose excludes or minimizes attention to certain sorts of sociological literature in Japan. Much more might be done, for instance, with materials illustrating the history of Japanese sociological studies, or materials illuminating the theoretical underpinning of sociological, ethnological, or social anthropological thought. Neither goal is pursued here, on grounds that such aims would expand our compilation mainly with replications, reviews, or critiques of European and American sociological literature. These materials only rarely would be helpful to our imagined typical non-Japanese user who, we assume, is already familiar with theory and important American or European case studies in the original languages and who, at this point, wants information and viewpoints on Japanese society. These materials are what we provide. We do furnish leads to research of pre-war periods, although giving our main attention to postwar research, on the assumption that some students will need a springboard to materials offering historical background. We also go beyond strict limits in another sense. Our contents mainly represent the dimensions of research done by Japanese sociologists. Rather than seek out material to meet every foreign taste, we have tended to bypass certain areas where Japanese research is thin. Where major differences in definition of disciplines occur, we have gone outside of sociology sensu stricto to include entries from what are neighbor fields in Japan (for instance, from demography, folklore, and communications research) to present materials important to social anthropologists or sociologists abroad. Obviously, certain lacunae here will prove to be due to our decisions as to limits rather than to lack of research materials, so we urge users to consult other sources. In some cases, other Guides in this Bibliographical Series will fill the gap, since we have restricted entries on some subjects to avoid duplicate listing of materials available in Guides to the fields of Geography, History, and Political Science. As might be expected, certain problems of transliteration and translation have been difficult to solve without amibiguity. There is no such thing as absolutely authoritative transliteration of proper names in a society where persons accept without question entirely different renderings of their own names (e.g., our late colleague Okada Yuzuru who answered equally to Okada Ken); and where place names not only have different readings but have changed from one historical period to another. Resigning to the inevitable, we have listed a few alternative personal name readings parenthetically following the reading we have chosen. An Index of Authors and an Index of Localities may help to reduce confusion. The connotations of a good many Japanese terms for traditional institutions and other social phenomena are lost or distorted by the closest English renderings. In other cases, it is not the everyday language but the scholarly jargon of English and Japanese that fail to coincide, owing to their different intellectual roots. We assume it is fruitless to append a glossary, in lieu of coping with the questions encountered in each item. We trust it has been possible to clarify points most likely to mislead or confuse, often by entering the Romanized Japanese term as well as an approximate translation in the title or annotation or both. Annotations describe the contents factually and, where this might not suffice, suggest the most useful features of a work. In some cases we offer criticism of a work's shortcomings or distortions, Since these are matters of opinion, users may not always agree. In any case, the materials are there for users to accept or reject according to their own taste. To be sure, we try to select the best works where alternatives are available; but space limits preclude listing all good materials, and it should not be necessary to add that omission of any work does not necessarily imply deprecatory evaluation of it. The nature of the literature requires that we pay attention to journal articles as much as to books and series. It is an earlier work that suffers, if anything, for we have tried to economize by listing later materials (or collections and series) that provide leads to short and, often, scattered papers of earlier date, even though the unlisted original paper may be superior in detail or intelligibility and freshness. ii\n\nPage III COMPILER'S INTRODUCTION C. HISTORY OF THE DISCIPLINES Most works in this bibliography are of postwar date, published after 1945. But they represent fiel ds whose intellectual taproots reach back as far as early Meiji times, when a few Japanese scholars became devoted to the grand social visions of Comte, Spencer, and Morgan. As distinct, empirical disciplines, however, these fields -- sociology, ethnology, folklore -- took shape later than might be supposed. In fact, their separate distinction dates from barely a decade before World War II. After this war, the senior leaders in each fields were men of one age. They had been college students in Tokyo during the effervescent 1920's, and all had broken away from the then prevailing teaching to move in the direction of empirical research. In time, their work decisively changed the character of social sciences in Japan. For some years, as these young scholars pursued their new gospel, they enjoyed an ecumenical colleagueship that led them to read the same books, talk together, and write for each other's journals even while each pursued his particular interests and inclinations. They had individual specialties, not different disciplines. It was in their middle years, in the 1930's, that their individual interests became the basis for differentiation of sociology, ethnology, and folklore into separate disciplines. These men, the first professionals in their respective fields, were still vigorous and active in postwar years. Hence, the major works of the founding generation of these still youthful disciplines find listing in this Guide without requiring departure from its basic prirciple of main emphasis on postwar research. To be sure, when Toda Teiz5 inherited the chair of sociology at Tokyo Imperial University in the early 1920's, several strains of sociologicalethnological thought already were rooted in Japan. As early as 1885 an Anthropological Association (Jinrui Gakkai) was formed. And a strain of ethnological-folkloristic research can be dated from 1907 when Yanagida Kunio and friends organized a Homeland Research Association (Kyodo Kenkyukai). As for sociology, Toda's own chair was founded at Tokyo Imperial University in 1893, while the first Sociological Association (Shakai Gakkai) was established in 1896. Up to Toda's time a considerable gap separated sociological theory from any form of empirical data-gathering, including fieldwork. One finds exceptions, to be sure. Several groups of enthusiastic laymen, notably those around Yanagida, omnivorously gathered data out of motives ranging from antiquarianism, through love of country life, to nationalist fervor. But they occupied no academic posts; they addressed not students but the general public who sought entertainment rather than guidance in an intellectual career; and they characteristically were unconcerned about theory to guide their research and integrate their findings. They were not unlike their contemporaries who formed local historical societies in Britain and the United States or became Volkskiindler in Germany. On the other hand, the sociology courses that were being started in several universities, following Tokyo's example, were devoted almost wholly to the academically respected task of expounding grand social theory on models derived from Comte, Spencer, Morgan, Maine, and MacLennan. The anthropologists of the time, in a separate faculty, taught anthropometry and biological evolution, not society or culture. Though within universities it was the anthropologists in particular who were sympathetic toward non-academic students of Japanese customs, neither they nor the academic sociologists had found room to utilize this sort of research in their courses by 1920. Toda, on the other hand, after a trip around the world via Europe, spent a period in contact with leading American empirical sociologists at Chicago, and brought back high enthusiasm for fieldwork and quantitative research, applying the latter method immediately and extensively to materials such as the first Japanese census, compiled in 1920. Several students in his classes, hitherto bored with the abstractions of grand theory, seized enthusiastically on his new gospel and spread it among their friends. Though these companions were in a variety of fields, together they read treatises by Durkheim, Tonnies, Tarde, Simmel, MacIver, Cooley, and Sumner. Further, while browsing in the Kanda bookstores, they discovered Malinowski's glamorous and fresh field reports, functional studies by Radcliffe Brown, and world-distribution studies by Wilhelm Schmidt. These works all revealed to them certain elegant ways of bringing integrative socio-cultural theory into contact with the empirical challenge of fact-finding. Such young men as Oka Masao (enrolled in sociology), Koyama Takashi (sociology), Furuno Kiyoto (religion), Ariga Kizaemon (art history), and Suzuki Eitaro (ethics), later were to gain separate distinction as ethnologists and sociologists, allthe while retaining their personal ties with each other. Toda, in effect, had transplanted strong seedlings from a setting of arid armchair speculation into the rich new soil of empirical science. But not until the 1930's did academic flowering occur. One reason was the lack of suitable jobs through the 1920's. There were few academic posts for persons now termed behavioral scientists. The few posts were in sociology, and first priority in this field went to theoretical, non-empirical sociology. So, emerging from Toda's strong influence in college, the young gradutates took jobs where they could find them and shared their interest in the science of society only in their afterhours. Several met Shibusawa Keizo. He was a wealthy businessman, college-trained in ichthyology, whose enthusiasm for fisheries had broadened into patronage for studies of fishing gear and fishing methods, general material culture, and economic organization. The collection of artifacts he and his friends accumulated in his attic gave a name to the Attic Museum, an institute which published reports by members of his group. Shibusawa was not greatly senior in age to the sociologist Oka Masao or the art history student Ariga Kizaemon. These latter two young men had come together in college, both being from Nagano prefecture; iii\n\nPage IV COMPILER'S INTRODUCTION and in common with Shibusawa, each had graduated from Higher School in Sendai. Hence, the three enjoyed a regional intimacy. Shibusawa knew the older Yanagida Kunio, a man of rather less wealth yet able to support similar enthusiasms, who was eventually to become the high priest of the discipline of folklore and already had gained repute through his published reports on Japanese folk culture. For two decades Yanagida had been central in a group of like-minded men. Among the advantages he could offer to his acquaintances and followers was his excellent library of up-to-date European journals and books. Through his support Oka and his friends started a journal, Minzoku (Peoples), in 1924. Though Yanagida throughout his life kept links with a network of local amateur enthusiasts, some of those closest to him eroded away from the group, and Oka and Ariga in turn broke away to follow separate interests. Oka seized the chance Shibusawa offered him to study in Austria under Wilhelm Schmidt. Others later followed the same path. Oka returned to become outstanding for his devoted advocacy of Kulturkreis ethnology. Meanwhile, Ariga stayed in Japan and, like Suzuki Eitaro and Koyama Takashi, began a lifetime career of village studies. These slightly diverging paths led to a differentiation among ethnology, sociology, and folklore that was increasingly clear by the middle 1930's. Among those following the sociological path, Suzuki Eitar5 used rural communities to test sociological notions from abroad, especially the ideas of rural sociologists in the United States. Koyama Takashi, Kitano Seiichi, and others carried on one of Professor Toda's main interests, the sociology of family, in the village setting. Furuno Kiyoto also examined villages but with special attention to their religious organization. Sociological theory, especially of American flavor, tended to be the underpinning of many of these studies. The view of Ariga Kizaemon, on the other hand, was perhaps closest to that of the British social anthropologists. Ariga's village studies sought to develop formulas accounting for institutions of village society in terms of their functional setting, especially their ecological accommodation through economic organization. All of the above interests formed the core of empirical sociology in Japan. Ethnologists such as Oka diverged from sociologists by virtue of their paramount interest in the larger cultural sphere of East Asia and the Pacific. While Japanese culture, viewed historically, prompted research queries and hypotheses, in their attempt to gather relevant data they perceived Japan just as one segment of a much larger cultural reservoir. Generally speaking, the only ethnologists who specialized on Japan were those sharing Shibusawa's enthusiasms, who became associates of the Attic Museum under his patronage. Meanwhile, Yanagida upheld the banner of folklore. He reorganized his\"Thursday Club,\" which had been founded a decade earlier in 1924, and brought in such persons as Nakayama Taro, Kindaichi Kyosuke, Origuchi Shinobu, Hayakawa Kotaro, and Okamura Chiaki. For a time an emigre White Russian named Nevsky was part of the group. Yanagida launched his new group on a program of study of mountain villages, followed by study of fishing villages. A young man who entered the field in 1934, Omachi Tokuzo, joined this fieldwork and stayed on to become Yanagida's most prominent disciple, taking the lead in collecting and categorizing the many local varieties of custom, belief, and organization in traditional areas. Folklorists in this fashion built up Japan's main repository of information on exotic and out of the way localities, whereas sociological research, though also oriented to the rural side, dealt more regularly with mainstream rural areas. A sense of common interest and joint enterprise lingered among all these persons, as is evident in the list of contributors to early issues of Minzokugaku Kenkyu (Journal of Ethnology), which began in 1935. Yet, when this journal was born, it merely filled out the roster of journals founded for the needs of each separate field. Each discipline by this time had its favorite subject matter, its particular theoretical issues; and the pathways of ethnology, sociology, and folklore tended more and more to diverge after the middle 1930's. It should be noted, again, that there were still inequalities of support. Through all these years teaching positions were opened only in sociology, and these were few, indeed. Most of the early scholars were amateur in the literal sense that they gained a living as government employees, school teachers, or businessmen, or lived on private means and indulged in research at their own expense and only on their own spare time. To most Japanese social scientists, the explosive outbreak of war in Europe, Asia, and the Pacific brought a succession of intellectual and ethical crises which built up to the ultimate catastrophe of defeat of the nation they identified with, whatever the quality of their participation or alienation during the war years. Most social scientists, even though holding their peace during the war, had endured a long and chilly period as semi-outcasts during the prewar and war years. They had had virtually no news of activities and trends in their fields abroad, outside of Axis nations, and constraints on their own freedom of research and expression had deepened continuously from 1937 to 1945. Following defeat, however, there was new release for their energies and desires. Now there was fresh life in their habitual research areas as well as a rush of new ideas from abroad. While American methods and subjects were prominent, to many Japanese there seemed to be little coherence or depth to American social science philosophy. In rural research, many sociologists began to look at society through the once-taboo prism of Marxian thought, and a good many started to examine attitudes and \"consciousness\" or ishiki, a term conceived as encompassing feudal vs. modern self-images, political awareness, a sense of class identity and class consciousness. A fair portion of this research was rooted in acceptance of Marxist postulates of social evolution; but everyone, whatever his theoretical orientation, was keenly aware of the probability that defeat and subsequent social engineering was going to revolutionize to their core the various sectors of Japanese society. Almost all researchers were concerned with structural changes brought to village society by land iv\n\nPage V COMPILER'S INTRODUCTION reform and other postwar measures. A vigorous new Rural Research Society (Sonraku Shakai Kenkyukai, abbreviated within the profession as Sonken) was formed. Sociologists, ethnologists, and folklorists were prominent in a series of multidisciplinary team studies of Tsushima, Noto, and Sado Island, launched under the coordination of the Nine Learned Societies, Kyugakkai Rengo. Results are listed in several chapters of this bibliographical Guide. The American presence in the postwar Occupation (1945-1952) exposed Japanese to a welcome flow of information about innovations in the several so-called behavioral sciences in the United States. They were quick to examine these innovations and trends and to use them in reshaping existing studies as well as in initiating new subfields of sociology and ethnology. Industrial sociology, one of the new fields, did have somewhat earlier roots in the midwar era, comprising studies of worker morale and attitudes in war materiel industries; but now it was led by Odaka Kunio into broader studies of attitudes and occupational structure among urban workers. Research on social stratification, developing in turn out of industrial sociology, became a specialty in its own right. Demography drew scholars from economics and mathematics as well as from sociology. It acquired an identity as a distinct discipline, and soon developed great expertise, gaining added luster from being one academic enterprise of social science origin that was also valuable to the government for national planning. A number of young social scientists helped create a research field in mass communications, receiving graduate training in this subject at the Journalism Institute of Tokyo University. Social psychology, known but hardly practiced before the war, achieved respectable standing in sociology in the early postwar years. Recruits tended to be drawn from psychology undergraduates disenchanted with academic departments of psychology which, as bastions of experimental psychology, were typically hostile to any sort of personality research until very recently. Other students with a sociological background also entered social psychology as graduates. Finally, urban sociology also began to develop after the war, especially after 1955 when Japan, hitherto a predominantly rural nation clearly moved toward a future as a highly urban society. Urban sociology drew such established men as Isomura Eiichi as well as younger scholars. Ethnologists in the first, impoverished postwar years joined sociologists in studying Japanese society; a good many, in fact, would have had no scholarly means of subsistence had not jobs been opened to them in studies sponsored by the Civil Information and Education Section of the Occupation headquarters forces. With these studies in Japan they fortified their previous experience in Taiwan, Korea, China, Manchuria, and the Western Pacific. Some persons with such background (e.g., the late Okada Yuzuru) went on into university teaching positions as academic sociologists; but some others (e.g., the late Ishida Eiichiro and the somewhat younger Izumi Seiichi) applied their experience abroad in creating and bolstering university programs in ethnology and cultural anthropology. Then, as fast as economic conditions improved, ethnologists and archaeologists shifted their research outside of Japan to Peru and Brazil, Southeast Asia, India, Nepal, Iran, and (recently) Africa. In the postwar years many regional universities and colleges were established in Japan and, in the new intellectual climate, these new institutions made room for the teaching of ethnology or cultural anthropology as well as sociology. For the first time numerous academic posts were opened to these empirical social sciences. (As in pre-war decades, of course, economics, geography, and the formal or constitutional aspects of political science had strong standing as social sciences; the study of political behavior, however, has been incorporated in college teaching and research as a subfield of sociology -- political sociology -- rather than in conjunction with government and law.) The majority of posts in the academic world were in sociology. To this day, ethnologists tend to have attachments to a variety of departments rather than to possess a home of their own. But they now do have academic positions to occupy, as very few did previously. The second and third generations of Japanese social anthropologists, ethnologists, and sociologists on the scene as the 1970's decade opens are pushing toward new frontiers. Often younger persons have a year or two of study abroad, from which they return with new methods and viewpoints. Apart perhaps from the field of folklore, which was so closely associated with the late Yanagida Kunio himself, each of the fields reviewed here has every prospect of continuing to diversify, gain methodological sophistication, and grow. Patterns will not duplicate those abroad but will reflect most international currents and make distinctive contributions to those currents. D. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS As described above, a nucleus for this bibliography was compiled by Professor Okada Yuzuru and added to by Professor Morioka Kiyomi, both of the Department of Sociology, Tokyo University of Education, during their respective periods as visiting scholar at the University of Michigan. Professor Nakano Takashi took charge on an enlarged plan from 1964 to 1966, working in Japan. There he was assisted by Kitahara Ryuji, now Assistant in the same Department of Sociology, Tokyo University of Education. Mr. Kitahara provided much of the material on social movements. To assist in special categories, we obtained advice and assistance from colleagues. Professor Hara (then Sue) Hiroko of the East Asian Research Institute, Tokyo University, made major contributions to Chapter 27, Personality. Professor Kakizaki Kyoichi, of the University of Librarianship, gave advice on urban sociology. Translation was done at the University of Michigan, except for portions given first translation v\n\nEditorial Note\n\npp. vi\n\nPage VI EDITORIAL NOTE by Professors Okada and Morioka. The principal translators were graduate students at the University: Robert L. Ramseyer (anthropology) and Stanley Fukawa (sociology). After translations and transliterations were checked and revised by the U.S. compiler, Richard K. Beardsley, they were given to graduate students for technical editing. Merrily Baird and Molly Tobin accomplished most of this exacting work. Final typing of the manuscript was in the competent hands of Marcia Curtis, while final proofreading was in the hands of Frank Shulman; both were student assistants in the Center for Japanese Studies. Calligraphy for all entries was done by Mrs. Chizuko Taeusch; that for the indices was done by Mrs. Yoko Kato. At each stage of work at the University of Michigan the contents were inspected, standardized, and revised by Richard K. Beardsley, who bears final editorial responsibility. The compilers express deep appreciation to all the above-mentioned assistants; to the staff of the University of Michigan Asia Library, especially Mr. Yukihisa Suzuki, for their generous cooperation in searching out materials or giving advice and reference assistance on innumerable problems of transliteration and translation; and to the successive Directors of the Center for Japanese Studies, Robert E. Ward and Roger F. Hackett for their unremitting support during the long period of preparation. Funds for much of the work in Japan and funds and facilities for work at the University of Michigan were generously provided by the Center for Japanese Studies, which also has borne the cost of publication. EDITORIAL NOTE To make materials accessible even to nonspecialists, all names of authors are Romanized; titles are shown first in characters, followed by Romanization, followed by translation. We show the inclusion of articles (enclosed in quotation marks) in volumes and of volumes in sets or series of different title by the word \"in\" placed between the lesser title and authors' names of the larger compilation. We endeavor to follow Library of Congress standards for Romanization, including minimal use of hyphenated word elements. Thus, \"social history\" is rendered shakaishi (not shakai-shi or shakai shi). An exception is in rendering place names. To avoid confusion over the basic form of place names for users not fully familiar with Japanese forms, we transcribe the basic name, then add separately any suffix showing its administrative category. Thus, we write Tokyo to (not Tokyo-to or Tokyoto). In English portions (translated titles and annotations) we do not mark long vowels for proper names. Certain works present an English title in addition to a Japanese title. Unless the English is a reasonably close translation, we enter our own translation as well as the English title, marking the latter (Eng. title:...). The more complex problem of terms for social and historical features that have no close English equivalent can be covered by no single rule, but we have tried to cope within the annotations by offering the Japanese term as well as a word, phrase, or brief explanation in English; some such explanation will be found in each chapter, if not in each individual entry. A few frequently cited series are rendered by acronyms of the Romanized Japanese terms.

The products of this art are rich and diverse. In this section we do not attempt to gather all potentially useful material, or even sample it. Our interest is more modest, more narrowly focused. Here we attempt to guide students to bibliographies on areas of Sociology or Social Anthropology, i.e., to compilations directly concerned with subject matter represented in succeeding chapters of the present Guide. A guiding principle, moreover, has been to favor compilations that give access to articles in journals, serial publications, and collections. Entry into such periodical literature is difficult or impossible from general bibliographies. In consequence, we have sought collections compiled by sociologists or social anthropologists, lists of books and articles appearing in professional journals of these fields, and collections (by whatever author) that specifically emphasize subject matter represented in this Guide. Very extensive categories of bibliography omitted from this section should not be overlooked by students attempting a definitive survey of a given subject. The specialized bibliographies shown here, though they tap relatively brief reports which often are most rewarding, are seldom exhaustive or definitive except for limited purposes. A more comprehensive, reliable view of the full range of Japanese publication is to be had from examining comprehensive general guides -- bibliographies of bibliographies and the so-called general bibliograf phies of social sciences or of Japanese publishing as a whole. Such works are well covered in two other guides in this Michigan Bibliographical Series: on Japanese political science by Robert E. Ward and Hajime Watanabe (see Entries 1 to 107); and on Japanese history by John W. Hall (see, especially, pp. 17 ff.). Exemplifying the general works covered in the companion guides just named, each of two classic compilations offers a separate section devoted to sociology: Amano Keitaro, Hompo Shoshi no shoshi (A bibliography of Japanese bibliographies), Tokyo, 1933; or the monumental work of Hatano Ken'ichi and Yayoshi Mitsunaga, Kenkyu ch5sa sank5 bunken soran (General survey of reference works for study and research), Tokyo, 1934. Their contents are dated, ending more than a generation back; and the absence of analytic listing of journal contents limits their utility in the search for material on many subjects of current interest; yet to make a thorough search for pertinent literature one should examine these and similar works. For more up-to-date works, the student should consult library catalogs, notably the National Diet Library's annual Zen-Nihon shuppambutsu somokuroku (General catalog of Japanese publications), Tokyo, 1951 +. These general works give little guidance to journal contents and only incomplete guidance to non-commercial publications issued by universities and professional societies; but, notwithstanding these limits, they are basic to a search for relevant literature on any major subject. Entries in this section are selected as guides to research on Japanese society, not as guides to the disciplines of anthropology and sociology. To this end, we have defined subject matter to suit the expectations and convenience of non-Japanese scholars. Thus, for instance, we draw attention to folkloristic research on Japan, since it presents material useful to, say, a British or American ethnologist or sociologist, notwithstanding the fact that folklore has developed in the Japanese scholarly world as a discipline distinct from anthropology and sociology. Conversely, since in Japanese cultural anthropology much research deals only incidentally if at all with Japan, anthropology is represented by only one item (Izumi); archaeology concerned with typology and dating rather than with social institutions is omitted, as is biological anthropology. We also omit guides to theoretical sociology based on European models of speculative social thought. A bias, though not a firm limit, is introduced by our primary concern with postwar sociology, which has considerably more empirical orientation than pre-war sociological work in Japan. Students seeking bibliography that presents pre-war sociological thought should consult the so-called general bibliographies of social science noted above, which provide initial access to the older sociological monographic work. Pre-war sociological research on particular subjects has been taken into account, of course, in all other sections of this Guide. A student seeking information on trends of thinking about family structure, population problems, or the social significance of religion, for instance, should refer to the chapters on family, population, and religion for citations representing the various views since the early 1920's. We recommend the following procedure as suited to bibliographic search on most problems in the SociologySocial Anthropology field: 1. Consult any specialized bibliographies that appear to cover the subject of interest. 2. Examine relevant sections in several of the better general bibliographies listed in the Michigan guides to Political Science and History. Bearing in mind that some social science categories are defined by Japanese bibliographers in ways unlike the already variable definitions used by American bibliographers, one should not restrict search too narrowly to one or two categories (e.g., where an American might seek studies of \"attitudes\" under society or religion, their listing in Japan may be under politics or folklore, instead; \"urban studies\" may be treated more regularly as economics or geography than as sociology). 3. Following leads discovered in the preceding steps, consult one of the yearbooks and appropriate journals (see Chapters 2 and 3, below) as well as volumes of the Zen-Nihon shuppambutsu somokuroku 1\n\nPage 2 2 JAPANESE SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY (General catalog of Japanese publications) of the and a subject of interest for Japanese scholarly litNational Diet Library.

First, it provides for the usual encyclopedia or \"World Almanac\" problems: how to discover or verify the date or location of an event, or ascertain other facts and figures. Beyond this are the problems peculiar to transliterating or translating from Japanese: what reading of a person's name or a location is \"correct\"; what special connotations may lurk in a Japanese word unrevealed by a small desk dictionary? How does one verify that a given locality underwent a change of name through history or recent administrative shifts? Such information is often infuriatingly elusive. One can work serenely only by being broadly aware of the principal types of reference resources and knowing their capacity and limitations. Happily, the Japanese aptitude for systematic compilation makes available a wide range of works for ganeral assistance. Most of these works would be marginal in some degree to the subject matter of this Guide, and their listing would run into the hundreds. Hence, we have strictly observed narrow limits here, covering only reference materials that pertain most directly to the interests of sociology and social anthropology. Of course, such materials do not fully relieve all the common reference problems referred to above -- we list no geographical gazeteers or maps, and no name-reading dictionaries, for example. Such problems are comr - to all social science research and are dealt with in previously published Guides in this Bibliographical Series. Rather than needlessly duplicate listings in these readily accessible guides, we urge the user to consult the following: by Robert E. Ward and Haj ime Watenalie on Political Science; by John W. Hall on History; and by Robert B. Hall and Toshic Noh on Geography. Using the several Guides, students will find suitable lists of atlases and dictionaries of place names; of dictionaries of general history as well as of economic, political, legal, agricultural)and other special areas of history; of chronologies; of biographical dictionaries and guides to personal name-readings. So.urces of gaeoera] statistics and of various sorts of economic or political statistics are given. There are, also, helpful guides to language usage in the pre-modern and modern periods. Given this wide coverage in previously published Guides, the present Guide can safely narrow its range to materials peculiarly central to sociology and social anthropology. In some degree, this chapter on General Reference Works is a \"residual\" category for materials not readily located under a restricted subject but of more \"general\" scope. As cross-references, it cites certain reference works that do fit a particular subject-category and so have been placed elsewhere for efficient reference use; but users seeking what they consider a general reference work for a particular problem (e.g., demographic discussion of words for social groups or a religious ceremony) should search the most appropriate chapter in addition to consulting this chapter. Specialized compendia, in other words, are not invariably listed here, where we have placed general reference works. This chapter presents its contents under the following three headings: a. Yearbooks (dates; incremental statistics; events; activities of organizations), b. Statistics (quantitative data and the definitions for interpreting them), c. Dictionaries (definition and discussion of terms, historical and contemporary). A. YEAR BOOKS Yearbooks resemble American almanacs in their contents. General yearbooks report events in all fields of society and cite, with appropriate statistics, changes during the preceding year. Thus, for instance, compact summary is available for agriculture, fisheries, foreign trade, health and vital statistics, trends of population growth and distribution, production, crime, and welfare. Specialized yearbooks give more detailed and comprehensive review of developments in their particular field of interest. We list only a few most widely used general yearbooks. Moreover, we give only a sampling of the many specialized yearbooks that are available, choosing those of relatively broad scope. Almost any Japanese organization or special group, to give evidence of its stability and respectable status, is apt to produce a yearbook as soon as it can get access to a press, so their number is virtually uncountable. Local and regional governmental and private bodies provide yearbooks, as do national organizations. No sample is provided here, but students engaged in fieldwork or case studies who are able to discover such local compendia may benefit greatly from their use. 2.001. Asahi nenkan \" f X iFL (Asahi yearbook). Tokyo, Asahi Shimbunmha, 1924-, annual./ One of the most comprehensive and valuable yearbooks of general scope. The first yearbook (1924) appeared in Osaka. The 1965 edition (l004pp.) covers January to December, 1964, treating the Olympic games in this year, in addition to its usual entries, the world, Japan, the who's who, and lists of companies, organizations, and universities. 8\n\nPage 9 GENERAL REFERENCE WORKS 9 2.002.

See Entry 21.014.\n\nPage 10 10 JAPANESE SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY B. STATISTICS In volume and variety, statistics on Japan are enviably plentiful even to the point of being overwhelming. Sources listed here constitute only a narrow selection aimed entirely at assisting research in standard areas of demography, general sociology, and social anthropology. To set looser limits would quickly outrun the space appropriate to statistics in this Guide. Again, for broader coverage, especially in the field of economic statistics. students should consult other Guides in this series; the most generous listing is given in the Guide to Japanese Political Science, by Robert E. Ward and Hajime Watanabe. A few specialized compendia of statistics are listed in appropriate later chapters. Though crossreferences are usually entered here, the reader interested in data on a particular subject is urged to examine entries in sections most suitable to his subject. While Japan's statistical records are far and away the most voluminous, authoritative and sophisticated of any Asian nation and surpass or equal those of non-Asian countries as well, two points of caution mut be observed in using them. The first is the question of accuracy. Relatively high standards achieved in postwar statistics do not preclude distortions and inadequacies for Japan any more than for any other nation; standards prior to the war were weaker, however, and figures on population and related subjects prior to the first modern Japan census of 1920 should be used with particular caution and cross-checked in every way possible. Though early materials are often remarkably and demonstrably accurate, the user should use great caution before relying on any given figure. A second important caution concerns definitions of social, political and other entities represented in statistical compilations. Medical terms in vital statistics have undergone several redefinitions while gradually approaching international standardization; census districts have been redraw;; the boundaries of towns, cities, etc., have shifted drastically through administrative amalgamation without change of name. Many other matters, in this rapidly transforming nation, give rise to confusion about definitions which, though often unavoidable, nevertheless set disastrous traps for the unwary user of statistical data. Serious users are urged to consult such a source as the Shitei tokei chosa yogo teigishu (Definitions of standard terminology for statistical surveys) (Entry 2.020) for guidance. Probably the most generally useful and authoritative source of governmental statistics (the national and prefectural governments compile the major bulk of statistical data, in any case) is the pre-war Nihon teikoku tokei nenkan (Statistical yearbook of the Japanese empire) (Entry 2.014) and its postwar successor Nihon tokei nenkan (Statistical yearbook of Japan) (Entry 2,018). In its scheme of organization and detail it resembles the Statistical abstract of the United States and it is an almost equally basic and valuable reference. Where it is insufficiently informative, the listing here emphasizes guidebooks to agencies and organizations that publish statistics which may more exactly meet the user's needs (e.g., Entries 2.0}6, 2.017, 2.019, 2.022, 2.023, 2.025). The user should bear in mind that, while accuracy may be greatest in the statistics of the national government and its ministries and his chances may be best to find what he needs in their regularly recurrent publications, lower units of government (prefecture, metropolitan governments, some lesser cities) also regularly publish statistical surveys and summaries. Even very small towns and villages provide occasional statistics. Finally, semipublic and private organizations or corporations frequently are good sources of regular or occasional statistics on their area of activity (e.g., the National League of Fisheries Cooperatives, several large banks and corporations, social welfare organizations). The problem lies in locating such sources, and the guidebooks listed here provide assistance for this problem. 2.010. Jinko dotai t5kei J, J eJ 't 4A^t (Vital statistics).

Naikaku Tokeikyoku Jj ~, 1 /,Tv (Cabinet Bureau of Statistics).

Indexes of categories and items are included. C. DICTIONARIES Specialized sociological and anthropological dictionaries are very few in the sea of dictionaries and encyclopedias on things Japanese. Among them, moreover, the greater number -- intended for the edification of Japanese, not foreigners -- markedly emphasize Euro-American concepts, theories, and terminology. Accordingly, the rare few that are, above all, informative about Japanese society and culture are exceedingly useful research tools. Our effort has been to compile a full list of such works, without needlessly duplicating listings for social science fields covered in other Guides of this series. Attention is called to two items of quite comprehensive nature. One is the four-volume set Nihon shakai minzoku jiten (Dictionary of Japanese sociology and ethnology) (Entry 2.035) published between 1952 and 1960. It carries specialist contributions from many persons coordinated through a committee of anthropologists and sociologists and is authoritative on most contemporary phenomena as well as providing historical depth. Originating as a response to pleas for information from Americans in the Occupation agencies, it is particularly well oriented to serve the needs of foreign scholars, even though preliminary plans to publish an English-language translation could not be carried through. The other is the Shakaigaku jiten (Dictionary of sociology) (Entry 2.028) published in 1958. Also a landmark accomplishment of many scholarly contributors, it has been selected from among numerous works of similar title precisely because of its focus on phenomena of Japan rather than on sociology as a universal discipline. The seven volumes on \"vocabularies\" compiled under the leadership of Yanagida Kunio (Entries 2.040-2.046) should not be overlooked as works of decidedly broad quality. They are, in effect, comprehensive dictionaries of traditional and regional sociocultural phenomena which, for convenience, the compilers organized by the standard or dialect terms for these phenomena. They provide splendid insight into particularly Japanese nuances of organization and behavior, with due attention to the historical dimension. Maps and gazeteers are adequately covered in other Guides of this series. For convenience, however, two handbooks of administrative placenames are given here in cross-reference. For similar purpose, cross-reference listing is made of handbooks naming and describing corporations. 2.026.
