        "text": "Two games against the Hiroshima Carp, two big hits for Yomiuri Giants infielder Shuichi Murata.\n\nMurata made a few nifty plays with his glove at third base and put the Kyojin ahead with a tiebreaking single in the eighth to help lift the Giants to a 2-1 victory over the Carp in front of a Sunday afternoon crowd of 44,569 at Tokyo Dome.\n\n\"It was a little difficult for me to concentrate today because I was born in Fukuoka,\" Murata said, referring to the series of earthquakes that have affected the Kyushu area since late Thursday night."
