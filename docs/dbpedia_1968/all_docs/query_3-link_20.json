        "text": "In nine gubernatorial elections on April 9, 2023, six governors were reelected, while three were elected for the first time. As the former governor of Ōita Prefecture decided not to run, and the former governor of Nara Prefecture lost his election, all 47 current governors were now born in the postwar era. Their average age is 60.3 years; Nagasaki Governor Ōishi Kengo is the youngest at 40, and Kumamoto Governor Kabashima Ikuo the oldest at 76. There are just two women: Tokyo Governor Koike Yuriko and Yamagata Governor Yoshimura Mieko.\n\nAround half (23 of 47) of Japan’s prefectural governors previously worked in central government ministries, including 10 in the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications; 5 in the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry; 4 in the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism; 2 in the Ministry of Finance; and 1 each in the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The MIC has jurisdiction over the financing of regional authorities and works closely with them. Of the 10 MIC alumni, 6 were elected as governors in prefectures to which they were seconded in posts including deputy governor, rather than their home prefectures.\n\nJapan’s 47 Prefectural Governors\n\nCreated by Nippon.com. Highlights indicate governors who formerly worked in central ministries. Current ministry names are given, including cases where they went by different names when governors were working there.\n\nAt 58.8 years, the average age of mayors of Japan’s 20 designated cities is slightly lower than that for governors. The youngest is newly elected Osaka Mayor Yokoyama Hideyuki at 41, and the oldest is Nagoya Mayor Kawamura Takashi at 74. There are seven mayors who have worked at central ministries. Because municipalities are directly connected to citizens’ lives, many mayors have experience as employees in local authorities or as members of city or prefectural assemblies.\n\nJapan’s 20 Mayors of Designated Cities\n\nCreated by Nippon.com. Highlights indicate governors who formerly worked in central ministries. Current ministry names are given, including cases where they went by different names when governors were working there.\n\n(Translated from Japanese. Banner photo © Jiji.)"
