        "text": "This year, on the theme of âImpetus,â the artists will select from the art collected by Shiseido at previous Tsubaki-kai exhibitions works that spark ideas around this ânew world.â By presenting what they have chosen from the collection, and their personal responses to it, via their own works and methods, they will attempt to bring new perspectives to the collection works, and create links between these, and the future. In 2022, the artists will work with each other and engage with experts in other fields in a âQuestâ to explore questions and realizations from the first year, and present works arising from these interactions. The final year, 2023, will consist of an exhibition representing the âCulminationâ of three yearsâ activity.\n\nA dedicated page will be set up for Tsubaki-kai 8 on the Shiseido Gallery website. This will be used to post information unable to be covered at exhibitions, as well as processes, documents and so on, all in the interest of facilitating communication with visitors to the exhibitions and the website.\n\nThe world in which we live is now at a major turning point. In uncertain, unpredictable times, art can give us courage, and hints of what the future might hold. At Shiseido Gallery we aim to make the Tsubaki-kai an open, welcoming place where artists and the viewing public can come together, and through dialogue share new values, and influence and inspire each other.\n\nHiroshi Sugito\n\n“The fruitless goes on to become a luxury.”\n\nThoughts on “This New World”\n\nI think the fruitless goes on to become a luxury. I hope our society will not become one that deprives us even of such indulgent interludes.\n\nInspiration from the collection\n\nNaoya Hatakeyama ãAkasegawaâs Atlierã2017\n\nThis spring when things had settled down a little, at a time when I was also tidying up around the place, I was deciding whether to put away stuff I didnât need, or throw it out, in order to leave just the bare minimum required in my limited living space. I think I was in the process of choosing things to leave out in my room, when it struck me there were some odd objects that I had unconsciously assumed to have a fixed position, which had in fact just been sitting where they were for years, untouched, with not so much as a glance from me. Before scrutinizing this photo as a work, I had this feeling of being made to identify, in a no-nonsense manner, the strange stuff on my own shelves, and it was with strong echoes of this that I selected it.\n\nAbout the work Object\n\n① Hiroshi SugitoãObjectã 2021\n\nIâve brought along some stones that are not a work of mine but sit on my shelf and are not especially essential to me, but which I have left there for years, unable to bring myself to discard them. A new space has now opened up on that shelf, and if there is nothing to fill it, I imagine these stones will end up back there. I know that to seek new worlds one must start by shedding something, but I suspect Iâll be returning them. Thus pondering if maybe this is what is meant by a collection, I find the empty space on top of the long stand starts to look like a new world.\n\nArtist Talk by Hirsohi Sugito (Japanese Only)\n\nRyuji Nakamura\n\n“To create relationships within the space.”\n\nThoughts on “This New World”\n\nForced into an abrupt volte-face in values, we find new values emerging and diversity gathering pace in what could be described as a kind of shock treatment. Yet rather than moving ahead rapidly by accident, Iâd prefer the world to move forward with the mechanisms and tolerance to generate diverse values on a more ordinary basis.\n\nInspiration from the collection\n\nWith no knowledge of the Tsubaki-kai works, I started by looking through the list of over 500, but failed to identify any leads, so while viewing the works was obviously a valuable experience, so was the actual process of looking for leads. In the Tsubaki-kai shows, the same artists exhibit over a number of years, so each artist has multiple works in the collection. I was making my selections by perusing this huge list and gradually narrowing it down, so inevitably, rather than a stand-alone work, what emerged was the stance and approach evident in several of each artistâs works, and I found myself interested in how this looked and felt, quite apart from the artistâs actual intent.\n\nParticularly striking from this perspective were the works of Yoshitatsu Yanagihara, Mitsuko Miwa, and Rei Naito. I was intrigued by the way these artists kept repeating the same motif over and over. Though unfortunately Iâve been unable to display Yanagiharaâs work on this occasion, he for example spent five years making sculptures of doves. Examining Yanagiharaâs work in the context of the relationality of multiple works, to find out what he saw in his long acquaintance with these quotidian, at first glance indistinguishable birds, I felt this to be a work that truly sparked the imagination.\n\nMiwa has produced paintings of the same womanâs face, painting them in a virtually identical fashion on each occasion, merely altering the way the image is cropped. They are fascinating works, with an edited look despite being oil paintings, painted on the assumption that there would be multiple versions, and as if the artist herself is observing the effect of this relationship.\n\nNaito makes legions of small figures carved in wood that are too small to put on display, and fragile and unreliable in their material qualities, yet that very minuteness and fragility draws the viewerâs awareness to the size and hardness of the location in which they are placed, making this to me a very spatial work.\n\nFor Miwaâs work, I chose a group of paintings of a womanâs face that would show the connection between works in the series; for Naitoâs I chose a single wooden figure to emphasize the connection with space. Hopefully viewers will also look at the works, and feel and think about the nature of the relationships in each.\n\nAbout the work Relation\n\n③ Ryuji Nakamuraãrelationã 2021 wood, plywood, putty, paint etc.\n\nFeeling that the works by Miwa and Naito would draw the viewerâs attention to relationships, I came up with a display that would create relationships within the space. Specifically this meant erecting a wall 1.55m high and 8.14m long. So that it feels like a wall constructed simply to partition off the gallery space for an exhibit, I have made it the same material and color as the gallery walls, and positioned it quite casually. The wall, works by Miwa and piece by Naito appear to be standing alone and unrelated to each other; my hope is that those who visit will find various relationships between them, and thus create landscapes and sensations of their own.\n\nIn everyday life we too frequently focus on objects, and I believe if we were to shift our focus slightly to observe things in terms of the gaps or relationships between objects, different values would start to emerge.\n\nArtist Talk by Ryuji Nakamura (Japanese Only)\n\nNerhol\n\n“The survival skills to become naturalized in a new place, and put down roots there.”\n\nThoughts on “This New World”\n\nWe thought perhaps weâd think of something as we went about making the work, because, to be honest, at the start we had no idea.\n\nWe too in our works have tended to choose themes such as historical phenomena, or situations where these have merged entirely with the everyday, and also wonder how much impact the coronavirus will continue to have on day-to-day living. Itâs likely some aspects of the pandemic will be forgotten. Hopefully through our work for Tsubaki-kai we can turn our gaze to this, and contemplate the state of gestures toward a new world.\n\nInspiration from the collection\n\nNaoya Hatakeyama ãFindling -Klein Helgoland, Sassnitz, RÃ¼genã2009ï¼2015\n\nThe boulder in Naoya Hatakeyamaâs photo is known in geological terms as an erratic, and has been carried to its location by glacial flow, and left behind when the glacier melted. Transported some distance, it is of a different rock type to other boulders nearby. In Japanese such rocks are also known as “strays” or lost stones, but for the title of his series, Hatakeyama chose the word “findling.” According to his text1, the “find” of “findling” comes from the verb finden meaning in English to find, and is German for an orphan, or foundling; a name apparently given to these boulders as research revealed their origins and a connection grew between boulders and humans.\n\nWe recently learned that Japan also has large boulders of this sort, in this case washed up on shore by tsunami waves. Many are found in coastal and inland areas of the Sakishima Islands of Okinawa, mostly, it is said, deposited on land by the devastating tsunami following the Yaeyama earthquake of 1771. These boulders also have affectionate local nicknames, with some also having divine status, or forming the foundation of stories in the islandsâ oral tradition.\n\nTo us Hatakeyamaâs work seemed to trace centuries of human engagement with the workings of the natural world. Some of the boulders photographed have sturdy bolts attached, perhaps to moor boats, or hold signs. How do these rocks, transported here by the mighty force of nature, relate to humans, and vice versa, and what further scenarios involving them will emerge in future? We sensed here a mysterious power evoking myriad stories. That said, this is not simply some “man vs. Nature” relationship.\n\nHatakeyamaâs “CAMERA” series meanwhile, also presented at a previous Tsubaki-kai, consists of a row of works in which the light from a lampshade in a hotel room is used to illuminate the ceiling. One senses a relationship between things already there, and human, either as temporary visitor or person with roots in that place, that is as solidly capable of anticipating the future as it is of evoking the idea of traces, or history.\n\n1 “Tsubakikai 2015 â Shoshin,” exh. cat., p. 49.\n\nAbout the work Sonchus asper\n\n④ NerholãSonchus asperã 2021 Inkjet Paper\n\nThe weed Sonchus asper (oni-no-geshi/prickly sow thistle) is European in origin, but now distributed all over the world. It is commonly seen at roadsides, and produces a yellow flower resembling a dandelion, but the leaves have a tougher appearance than dandelion leaves, are darker and have prickles, giving the impression of a rather more robust plant. Sonchus asper was first found in Japan in 1892 as an accidental import, twenty years after the founding of Shiseido, and has since spread all over the country, thanks to its superb ability to adapt to every environment from cultivated field to orchard, grassland, lawn, roadside, and waste ground.\n\nA team of researchers including from Oregon State University recently revealed that marine life carried from the waters off Japan was still turning up on the West Coast of the United States several years later. According to the paper published in Science, species including shellfish, sea anemones and crabs had been carried on some of the vast amount of flotsam generated by the Tohoku tsunami of 2011, all the way to the Americas. Even just the species known to have arrived amount to almost three hundred. This means that ecosystems of different creatures living symbiotically arose among the floating debris, with at least three generations surviving there.\n\nIf each of us were destined to live out our entire lives in a limited space, how ought we to do so? This feels like a good place from which to begin looking at the world. The flora and fauna of Japan and elsewhere will after all continue to breed, and even if the result of something accidental, there are probably many things with the survival skills to become naturalized in a new place, and put down roots there.\n\nArtist Talk by Nerhol (Japanese Only)\n\nFutoshi Miyagi\n\n“If only the world could have patience, and the generosity to listen to someone who has lost their way, to await stories yet to be told.”\n\nThoughts on “This New World”\n\nIn Rain Kudoâs novel Tsurara no koe (Icicle voices) featured in the April 2021 issue of literary magazine Gunzo, was the line, “Because my own disaster could not be called a disaster.” The novel speaks frankly of guilt and distance still felt ten years after the event due to experiencing the Tohoku disaster in a location not damaged by the tsunami.\n\nIf only the world could have patience, and the generosity of heart to listen to someone who has lost their way, to uncertainty, pain and sadness they feel is insignificant compared to that of others; to await stories yet to be told.\n\nInspiration from the collection\n\n2020 was spent writing and revising Ikuyo (How Many Nights) (June 2021 issue of Subaru), a novel set in wartime Tokyo. What I realized during the writing was how little I knew of what the war was like in the capital. Having been born, raised and educated in Okinawa, conducted research there, and occasionally listened to the stories of those who had lived through the war, I had long imagined what the war must have been like in Okinawa. On the other hand, I had hardly ever imagined what war would have meant in the capital. I cannot for example imagine the cold of the Tokyo winter in March 1945.\n\nThe streetlights were removed from the streets of Ginza, and the beauty equipment confiscated from the Shiseido salon, all for use as war materiel/materials. At the roadsides were shallow uncovered air-raid ditches, offering protection in name only. I learned these things as I did my research. But inevitably, the finer details are lost. There are details of the landscape that remain elusive no matter how much research one does.\n\nI was drawn to Zon Itoâs Identified Creatures of Ginza and Unseen Field by their titles, and the manner of their storage. Identified, and unseen, yet they were kept in the same case. There are two see-through media players, with “Identified Creatures of Ginza” and “Unseen Field” written on them in drawing-like fashion. The visible/identified and invisible/unseen occupy the same space. Casting doubt on the detectable and the undetectable was also something I could relate to as I wrote Ikuyo, and in connection to what we were dealing with during this year. In Identified Creatures of Ginza various creatures form constellations only to disintegrate and morph into other forms. In Unseen Field, the appearance of the land changes as if history is being unraveled, or updated, by war, disaster, development. To me this resembled the landscapes I had imagined, or missed, while writing Ikuyo, and how they changed. I suspect it takes a very long time for the visible and invisible to join together as a landscape.\n\nOn the work Forgotten Scent / Letter to be Written\n\n⑦ Shiseido ãPerfume Serenadeã\n\nIn Ikuyo two girls called Chiyo and Yukiko spend the night together in wartime Tokyo. Yukiko is wearing the perfume “Serenade” by Shiseido. Chiyo takes a liking to the scent of Serenade, because it has the same name as a favorite song of hers by Schubert. The bottle features moon and stars, joined by lines in the manner of constellations, but never forming perfect constellations.\n\nAs Japanâs war takes a turn for the worse, Yukiko returns to her hometown of Shingu. On leaving the capital, she passes her bottle of Serenade on to Chiyo with the words, “I only ever wore it when I was with you anyway.” As Tokyo comes under increasingly ferocious aerial attack, the Serenade remains unused. One day, the air-raid siren sounds, and Chiyo, at home, grabs her bag of essentials and heads for the air-raid shelter in the garden. In the bag is the Serenade. In the dim light of the shelter, Chiyo wonders if its fragrance will gradually dissipate without ever being used again.\n\nShiseido no longer has the formula for Serenade. I have no idea what its scent was like. The fragrance that connected two people in wartime Tokyo is no more. But that fragrance named for a song sung at night definitely did exist. Quite likely there is someone, somewhere who knows what it was like. Perhaps one day the formula will be rediscovered, and the perfume recreated. Or perhaps a new Serenade fragrance will be born.\n\n⑧ Futoshi MiyagiãForgotten Scent / Letter to be Writtenã 2021\n\nYukiko, living in Shingu, writes to Chiyo. Perhaps that letter will remain in Yukikoâs hands, never to be sent. Chiyo also writes to Yukiko, but fearful of the censor, cannot write what she truly wants to say. How many letters are never sent, staying in the hands of the writer, or discarded? After the war, what kind of letter might Chiyo write to Yukiko? Putting fountain pen to writing paper, would she wonder how to start? Would there be so much to say, that sheâd pause, pen hovering over the paper? Perhaps a tiny spot of ink, like a star, would stay there.\n\nArtist Talk by Futoshi Miyagi (Japanese Only)\n\nAiko Myanaga\n\n“To be calm, generous, more flexible.”\n\nThoughts on “This New World”\n\nA world in which we can see each otherâs faces clearly without masks, and hear each otherâs voices directly: thanks to the pandemic we may have found it possible to do a great deal without meeting in person, but I suspect what we have learned most of all is how precious it is to see each other in the flesh, and sense things directly. When fear and insecurity strike is exactly the time to be calm, generous, more flexible. Iâd like to live and work in ways that allow each of us to mindfully confirm our place in the world.\n\nInspiration from the collection\n\nNaoya Hatakeyama ãFindling -Schwanenstein, Lohne RÃ¼genã, 2009ï¼2015\n\n⑨ Noe Aoki ãWhere water remainsã2005\n\nI chose Naoya Hatakeyamaâs Findling â Schwanenstein, Lohne RÃ¼gen and Noe Aokiâs Where water remains with the idea of mixing in my own work and presenting the resulting relationship. Findling â Schwanenstein, Lohne RÃ¼gen is a photograph of what is known as an erratic boulder. Also referred to in Japanese as âlost stonesâ these are boulders surrounded by glacial ice and carried along by the glacier until reaching their final destination. One of the ideas in my own practice is that of realms that change and persist, and the sight of these erratic boulders morphing and persisting struck a quiet chord with me. This boulder is like a time capsule awoken from a glacier, and it occurred to me that the way a stone geologically different to the place in the photo continues to spin a new strand of time there, is also similar to a personâs life. I was struck by the urge to combine this work with a reforming naphthalene sculpture. Another inspiration has been Noe Aokiâs Where water remains. Aokiâs works are invariably graceful and generous in form. One marvels at how she manages to take such hard materials and clothe them in such soft gestures. I wanted to present Aokiâs work on the same lineation as my own, from the perspective that it has the same sculptural element, and though the material is totally opposite to naphthalene in nature, it captures the sculpture with wonderful suppleness. So if I were to display my own work between these two: Findling â Schwanenstein, Lohne RÃ¼gen and Where water remains, I thought perhaps I should do a naphthalene sculpture resembling a message in a bottle drifting on the ocean. The idea of arranging the three in a kind of âaquatic triptychâ in Ginza, which once was ocean, holds great appeal.\n\n* Miyanaga discusses the CAMERA works in the artist interview on the website.\n\nAbout the work Message 2019/2021\n\nFor SHISEIDO THE STORE in 2019 I assisted with a window on the theme of memories of water. After the display was removed, I took the crystals that had reformed on the inside of the glass case and stored them away at home, along with the bottles.\n\nFor this Tsubaki-kai I decided to take this work sealed away at a time when we most of us had never even heard of coronavirus, and present it anew, with an added message. In the bottles Iâd place a pottery shard picked up near the sea. Iâve no idea where this piece of pottery was carried from, what form it previously took or how it was used, but it is a message from the ocean halfway to becoming a stone, just a subtle remaining hint of design telling us that it was pottery. The bottle containing the shard will link the time the work spends developing in Ginza, to the next time it is shown. The planet we inhabit now is an uncertain and unreliable place, but I believe that amid this scene with all its own metamorphosis, people too continue to be supple. My hope is that people will sense a gracefulness shared by all three works, and the individual certitude of each. The other day my five-year-old daughter looked up at the sky and said, âIf I could do magic, Iâd turn myself into water!â Changing shape to go anywhere, achieving an easy affinity, being able to help people: here in the early summer of 2021, the imagination runs to many things.\n\n⑩ Aiko Myanagaãmessage 2019/2021ã 2021 Naphthalene, stone (piece of Porcelain), mixed media 2021\n\nArtist Talk by Aiko Miyanaga (Japanese Only)\n\n[mÃ©]\n\n“The power of looking”\n\nThoughts on “This New World”\n\nThings like medicine and economics are indispensible to our lives, yet at the same time offer only one sort of viewpoint or guide. We believe the coronavirus pandemic has had an impact far greater on our world, and our sensibilities when it comes to apprehending that world, than anyone has yet identified, and anticipate that the as yet invisible potential of this development will come strongly into play, spawning a multiplicity of expression. We too hope to develop in new ways, taking our cue where possible from personal experience.\n\nInspiration from the collection\n\nWe chose Genpei Akasegawaâs Hagu I and Hagu II. Initially we felt some trepidation about referencing Akasegawaâs works, but viewing them in the galleryâs storage we were struck by their sheer power, and made our choice pretty much intuitively. These seemed solid examples of work by an artist not afraid to square up to this very simple act of âseeing a thing and grasping it.â\n\n⑪ Genpei Akasegawa 2 chairs from ãHagu IIã 2013\n\nAbout the works matter Î± #â ¦ and Position\n\n⑭ [mÃ©]ãmatter Î± #â ¦ã 2021 Sand, stone, rock particles, etc\n\nHagu I is a two-dimensional work consisting of an enlarged photo of a 1000-yen note, shot by Genpei Akasegawa. This work by Akasegawa calling into question the fabricated structure of banknotes, whose value lies not in the original but the duplication, went on to generate immeasurable value. [mÃ©] are currently experimenting with making a work that in a sense takes the completely opposite viewpoint from it: matter Î±, which endeavors to look at the world in a different way by taking an ordinary stone lying on the roadside, and making duplicates of this meaningless original. Though matter Î± has a different perspective, to our minds it shared something fundamental with Akasegawaâs work, so we decided to position it alongside Hagu I.\n\nSimilarly, we thought Hagu II was endowed with the ambiguity of the inevitable charm of an old and useless an object, in contrast to its value and function in this case as an item of furniture. By adding what for this chair was a layer of “brand-new damage,” Akasegawa seems to have been trying to further emphasize this reversal of meaning.\n\nTo this [mÃ©] has added a further layer calling into question “the eyes of the viewer seeing that” and “the unique fact of having seen.” Without revealing details, Hagu II is being moved around at irregular intervals by staff during this exhibition, raising the possibility of two separate chairs being swapped in and out.\n\nIn Hagu I and Hagu II, made by Akasegawa in his later years, we sensed not only the linguistic meaning of the works, but a force for which there are no words, like a scene from a fever dream. We donât know whether the works by [mÃ©] will also offer this, but what we do know is that this force only arises in tandem with the senses of the person in front of a work, viewing it. We hope that it will lead those who make their way to the exhibition to discover new kinds of scene.\n\nWe believe that “this new world” is one that will show us the power of looking.\n\nArtist Talk by [mÃ©] (Japanese Only)"
