It depicts four major journeys between the Kyoto area and Suruga, where Sōchō served as the poet laureate of the Imagawa daimyo house, as well as several shorter excursions and long periods of stasis at various hermitages. Much of Sōchō’s time in and around the capital was spent at Daitokuji or other temples related to his spiritual master, the Zen prelate Ikkyū; in the east, he generally divided his time between lodgings in the Suruga capital and in his Brushwood Cottage (Saioku), in Mariko not far away. The historical and literary context of the work is introduced in the companion volume to the translation, entitled Song in an Age of Discord: The Journal of Sōchō and Poetic Life in Late Medieval Japan. As described in that study, Sōchō’s journal was written during the Age of the Country at War (Sengoku jidai), a century of unprecedented collision between social groups and artistic genres. It was perhaps for that reason that linked verse was the most popular and widely practiced literary form during that era, for its practitioners linked not only verses but cultures as well. Renga masters traveled between the capital, still Japan’s cultural center, and the periphery, facilitating interaction and cultural borrowing as they linked verses into long renga sequences. Sōchō’s journal reﬂects the interaction of the period and the diverse upbringing of its author, a companion of daimyo and warlords, a disciple of Sōgi, the renga master who sought to preserve orthodox poetic neoclassicism, and a devotee of Ikkyū, the iconoclastic Zen priest. It provides one of the most personal literary self-portraits in the medieval literary corpus. The work is notable for its breadth and freshness of observation, not only of the activities of linkedverse poets and the aﬀairs of great courtiers and daimyo, but also of the lives of local warriors and commoners. This richness of cultural detail is matched by the\n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 14 of 383\n\nA Note to the Translation variety of genres included in the journal; the diarist was a master not only of formal ‘‘high’’ (ushin) renga but also of the unorthodox or comic (haikai ) verse that was becoming increasingly important at the time. Sōchō was rare among diarists of the period in the degree of attention he paid to both strains of contemporary poetry. His journal is an introduction in microcosm to many of the important types of contemporary literary composition; while it begins as travel diary, it also includes eremitic passages, historical chronicles, conversations, letters, and more than six hundred poems of nearly every type: renga, waka, haikai, chōka, and linked poetry in Japanese and Chinese. Such variety makes The Journal of Sōchō particularly evocative of the literary and cultural character of Japan during the century of transition from the medieval to the early modern era. But it also results in a work that is at times ill-organized and unbalanced. Modern readers may be inclined to skip, for example, the ‘‘Asahina Battle Chronicle,’’ a lengthy account of now-forgotten provincial warfare that Sōchō inserts immediately after he begins his narrative. The author’s warrior patrons, however, were doubtless particularly engaged by such passages. (For the background to the ‘‘Asahina Battle Chronicle,’’ see Appendixes A and B, and for a summary of the contents of the journal, see Appendix C.) The translation of The Journal of Sōchō is based on the Shōkōkan manuscript, reproduced in Shimazu Tadao, ed., Sōchō nikki (Iwanami Shoten, ), –. In preparing the translation and annotation, I collated Shimazu’s recension with the Saiokuji manuscript, which I photographed at Saiokuji temple (site of Sōchō’s Brushwood Cottage), and four alternative texts: Sōchō michi no ki (an abridged version of Sōchō shuki).

Poems in the original manuscripts are not numbered or indented, and subtitles do not subsect those manuscripts as they do here (those subtitles are taken by and large from the Shimazu edition).

In the translation, toponyms are occasionally abbreviated for euphony in poetic contexts.

Sayo no nakayama.2\n\nKakegawa\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\nKakegawa.3 Stayed at the residence of Yasuyoshi. A construction project is currently under way. The outer castle is about thirteen or fourteen hundred yards in circumference.4 Around it they have dug a moat and built earthworks, after the manner of the main compound.5 The ground here is hard as rock; they might\n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 24 of 383\n\n  as well have built of iron. There is also a moat between the main and outer compounds. The ramparts are so steep it is frightening to look over. I composed this hokku at the castle: 2\n\nsamidare wa kumoi no kishi no yanagi kana\n\nSummer rain— on cloud-covered cliﬀs, willow trees! 6\n\nThere is a lake to the south. With its tall cliﬀs and expanse of water, it is like the sea itself. One might call it ‘‘Dragon Pond.’’ 7 Another hokku here: 3\n\nike no omo ya kishi wa suminoe haru no umi\n\nThe surface of the pond— clear cliﬀs like Suminoe by the springtime sea.8\n\nThe History of Kakegawa Castle The following occurred four or ﬁve years ago.9 There is a well in the main castle’s compound. When the late Asahina Yasuhiro had just received his commission in this province, Tōtōmi, he chose this mountain on which to build his castle, but he could not locate a water source.10 His men dug with picks, pikes, spades, hoes, and many other implements of every description for two or three hundred days, but still did not strike water. Just when they were about to abandon the eﬀort, they discovered a small black frog and a small snake in a basket used to draw up excavated earth. All took heart, thinking water could not be far oﬀ, and in the end they reached it. They had dug down to the river at the foot of the mountain. The draw rope was more than one thousand feet long! 11 What can the Undiggable Well of Musashi have been like? 12 They probably named the castle Kakegawa because of the river that ﬂows below it.13 The fortress is on the highroad running east and west between the capital and the provinces.14\n\nThe ‘Asahina Battle Chronicle’ \n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\nThe following is a chronicle of Asahina Bitchūnokami Yasuhiro’s loyal service in battle in this province.15 Lord Saemonnosuke had been headquartered in a castle on Yashiroyama mountain.16 When he was exiled, he withdrew to Futamata Castle, where freebooters from this province and Owari ﬂew to his cause, bringing the uprising into the open. All the lands to the borders of Shinano and \n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 25 of 383\n\nSecond Year of Daiei () Mikawa fell to him, including the castle held for years by Horie Shimotsukenokami west of Tenryūgawa river at Murakushi.17 Called Kuroyama, it has a main fortress and an outer fortress and is bounded by Lake Hamana to the north and south. Sōun and Yasuhiro laid their plans then assaulted it with forces raised in this province.18 In two or three days the castle fell.19 Then Ōkōchi Bitchūnokami, commissioner of the Hamamatsu Estate (ﬁef of Lord Kira), joined with Horie Shimotsukenokami and absconded.20 Iio Zenshirō Katatsura was accordingly ordered down from Kira to serve as temporary commissioner in Ōkōchi’s stead.21 The appointment was in recognition of the extraordinary military service of his father Zenzaemonnojō Nagatsura, who had been commissioner of that estate when Yoshitada entered the province years earlier.22 When Yoshitada met with calamity while returning to his home province, Nagatsura too was struck down and killed, after loosing all his arrows at the enemy in the glorious defense of his lord.23 His son Zenzaemon Katatsura, Katatsura’s son Zenshirō Noritsura, and Noritsura’s uncle Zenrokurō Tamekiyo ever honor his exploits.24\n\nThe ‘Asahina Battle Chronicle’ \n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\nAt the beginning of the ninth month of the ﬁrst year of Eishō [], war broke out between the Yamanouchi and the Ōgigayatsu houses (known together as the ‘‘Two Uesugi,’’ the Yamanouchi being the deputies in Kamakura).25 The Ōgigayatsu were allied with Sōun and held Kawagoe and Edo.26 The Yamanouchi held Uwado and Hachigata. The conﬂict became general and overran the borders of Musashi Plain. For three Kantō leagues the foe would not fall back, nor could our allies advance.27 When the deadlock had continued more than ten days, the Ōgigayatsu requested support from Imagawa Ujichika, who immediately set out at the head of an army.28 On the thirteenth, Asahina Yasuhiro and Fukushima Saemonnojō followed with their forces from Tōtōmi and Suruga.29 On the twentieth, twenty-ﬁrst, and twenty-second of the same month, Sōun made camp at Masukata.30 The enemy appeared to have pulled back. Our allies pursued them, making camp one night in the open. The next day, at about nine o’clock in the morning, our allies and the foe caught sight of one another through the mist of Musashi Plain, both armies thick as a mountain forest. They met with a crash like thunder.31 At about noon the cavalry charged and the battle raged for several hours thereafter. The foe was defeated and their main force re-\n\n\n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 26 of 383\n\n  treated to their stronghold at Tachikawa.32 Contact was lost with them in the night. Two thousand and more were missing, killed, cut down and left for dead, or made prisoner, and horses and armor were taken in abundance. After a day and a night, Imagawa Ujichika withdrew, making camp in Kamakura on the fourth of the tenth month. He stayed two days, then took the waters in Atami for seven. He then rested from the rigors of battle for two or three days at Nirayama, after which he returned to Suruga.33 It was at that time that he petitioned the god of Mishima Shrine.34 I thereupon spent three days composing a thousand-verse sequence at that shrine, beginning on the tenth.35 The ten hokku followed the order of the four seasons.36 The ﬁrst and second were as follows: 4\n\ntanabiku ya chisato mo koko no harugasumi\n\nIt trails afar— over a thousand leagues, this springtime haze.37 Ujichika\n\n5\n\naoyagi ya kakesou mishima yūkazura\n\nThe light-green willows— a divine addition to Mishima’s garlands.38\n\nThe ‘Asahina Battle Chronicle’  Eight or nine more years passed, and Ōkōchi Bitchūnokami staged another audacious uprising.39 He invaded the Hamamatsu Estate and secured himself in Hikuma Castle with freebooters and farmers of the province. Thereupon Yasuhiro set out and burned every temple and house. Ōkōchi was about to be killed, but Lord Kira pleaded on his behalf, and he was pardoned. All returned to their camps. That winter Yasuhiro unexpectedly died of illness. As his son Yasuyoshi was not yet old enough to rule, Yasuyoshi’s uncle Yasumochi was made temporary regent.40\n\nThe ‘Asahina Battle Chronicle’ \n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\nThen Ōkōchi Bitchūnokami raised troops in Shinano, Mikawa, and Owari and fomented a great uprising.41 Ujichika now set out in person to quell it. He drew up his horse at Ryōgonji temple in the Kasai Estate, and his forces made \n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 27 of 383\n\nSecond Year of Daiei () camp at Daibosatsu Mountain across Tenryūgawa river.42 At Mitake Mountain to the north, Ii Jirō staunchly served the Martial Defender and also gathered freebooters and others of lower station.43 Their watchﬁres at night were many as the stars in the sky before dawn. Yasumochi easily defeated them, and the Martial Defender ﬂew to Okunoyama and thence to Owari.44 This was the castle that several thousand troops under Kai Minonokami had earlier assailed for three years without success.45 Because of Yasumochi’s military prowess, the province remained secure.\n\nThe ‘Asahina Battle Chronicle’  Thereafter Ujichika dispatched troops in support of a campaign launched by Takeda Jirō in Kai.46 Seeing their opportunity, Ōkōchi and freebooters in this province of Tōtōmi summoned local warriors from Shinano and requested aid from the Martial Defender.47 They then began seizing lands here and there on both sides of Tenryūgawa river. That winter, the Asahina built the Hachiman Shrine at Kakegawa Castle.48 My celebratory hokku: 6\n\nkore ya yo ni kōranu nagare iwashimizu\n\nIt ﬂows in all seasons without freezing, this rock-pent spring.49\n\nYasuyoshi’s uncle Tokishige steadfastly defended Hachiman Shrine and both Tōtōmi and Suruga in Ujichika’s absence.50 The next summer, in the latter part of the ﬁfth month, Ujichika set out for that castle.51 There was a ﬂood at the time and Tenryūgawa river was like a great sea. Ujichika built a pontoon bridge with three hundred and more boats lashed together with ten or twenty huge bamboo ropes. It was solid as the ground itself. I made a thousand verses in prayer for a safe crossing. The hokku: 7\n\nminazuki wa kachibito naranu seze mo nashi\n\nThe Waterless Month— no victor who does not cross on foot, as there are no waves.52\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\nIt now occurs to me I ought to have said, ‘‘a crossing made by victors, / all of them on foot.’’ 53 The enemy came out on the far side of the river, and their arrows fell like\n\n\n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 28 of 383\n\n  rain. Tens of thousands of Imagawa troops crossed easily, and the foe pulled back. Ujichika encircled their castle six or seven fold, covering an area about ﬁfty chō around.54 There, from the sixth through the eighth month, he harassed them.55 The soldiers inside the stronghold resisted for several days, then capitulated on the nineteenth of the eighth month. Ujichika used men from the Abeyama gold mines to undermine the well in the castle, and there was not a drop of water to be had inside.56 The Ōkōchi—brothers, fathers, and sons—the Ōmi, the Takahashi, and the others in the castle with them, were either killed, cut down and left for dead, or taken prisoner.57 The ﬂeeing men and women were a pitiful sight.58 Because of certain circumstances the Martial Defender was allowed to leave the castle, and he took holy orders at a nearby Zen temple called Fusaiji.59 All those in his service took orders as well and were sent to Owari. The castles at Yashiroyama, Futamata, and Okunoyama of the Ii house rose in this manner three or four times. How is one to account for it? Ōkōchi Bitchūnokami fought the Imagawa in Tōtōmi three or four times as well.\n\nThe ‘Asahina Battle Chronicle’ \n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\nThis province of Tōtōmi and half of Owari are Imagawa lands. Some time ago they were made the domain of the Martial Defender for a time (the reason for that decision is unknown).60 Norikuni (Lord Jōkōji) was born in the ﬁfth year of Einin (Hinoto tori) [], Noriuji was born in the ﬁfth year of Shōwa (Hinoe tatsu) [], Yasunori was born in the ﬁrst year of Kenmu (Kinoe inu) [], Norimasa was born in the third year of Jōji (Kinoe tatsu) [], Noritada was born in the ﬁfteenth year of Ōei (Tsuchinoe ne) [], Yoshitada was born in the eighth year of Eikyō (Hinoe tatsu) [].61 Was it in the time of Yasunori that the Imagawa house lost its rights in the province? The facts of the matter are unclear. Eighty-ﬁve years later, Yoshitada entered Tōtōmi and occupied the Fukōin estates of Kawawa and Kakegawa.62 The estates had been transferred to him, and he possessed documents for both in proof.63 At that time, Ōmi Shinzaemonnojō, a vassal of Lord Kira, administered those estates and was residing on them.64 He built a strong castle and together with Kanō Kunainoshō, then vice constable of Tōtōmi, he opposed Imagawa entry.65 Thereupon Yoshitada set out in person to deal with them. From the eighth through the eleventh month he kept the Kanō castle in the Tōtōmi provincial capital under attack, and on the twentieth of the eleventh month Kanō took his own life.66 \n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 29 of 383\n\nSecond Year of Daiei () This Kunainoshō was of the same family as Kanō Suke of Izu.67 He lent support to Kanō Kaganokami, a district constable in Tōtōmi Province and a subordinate of the Martial Defender, as they bore the same name.68 But Kunainoshō later caused Kaganokami’s son Jirō to be killed, took over the succession, and ran the province according to his whim.69 His defeat was brought about by the Asahina. Then Kanō Suke of Abe rose in rebellion against the Imagawa.70 The mountains in that region run into Kai province, and it was diﬃcult to attack him. Three years passed. Kunainoshō led several thousand Tōtōmi troops into those mountains to aid Kanō Suke. The Asahina, using guides, went in and destroyed all of them. Peace was immediately restored. This was an act of uncommon merit on the part of the Asahina. The recent Imagawa entry into Tōtōmi began when Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa sent an order by Isenokami during the Ōnin era instructing Yoshitada to reinforce allied troops, including those of Hosokawa Sanukinokami, who was then at war with Tōjō Ōminokami Kuniuji, vice constable of Mikawa.71 In return for that meritorious service, Yoshitada was to be granted rights to the province. That was the reason for the eradication of Kunainoshō and the Ōmi. Then he sent two forces, about one thousand troops, to Hikuma Castle near the border of Mikawa, and returned to his home province in the twelfth month.72 The next year freebooters rose up, and Horikoshi Mutsunokami was unexpectedly struck down along with some of his men at Sayo no nakayamaguchi.73 Our allies nevertheless met with good fortune in various other battles. But the remainder of the defeated forces would not desist, and Yoshitada was again forced to mobilize. His generals were not in accord, however, and they rejoiced when an ally met misfortune. In the end they fell to killing one another. And in three years Yabe Saemonnojō, Higonokami Yasumori, and Okabe Saemonnojō all died of illness.74 There was something unnatural at work. After meeting with setbacks in several battles, Yoshitada returned home.75\n\nThe ‘Asahina Battle Chronicle’ \n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\nIt was over twenty years after Yoshitada’s untimely death that Ujichika entered Tōtōmi Province.76 Though it was peaceful there, insurgents in surrounding provinces rose continually. Tahara Danjōnochū and Suwa Shinanonokami incited mercenary bands and captured a castle belonging to forces allied with the Imagawa on Funakata Mountain at the border of Mikawa.77 The lord of the \n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 30 of 383\n\n  castle, Tame Matazaburō, was killed, and the enemy took residence.78 Asahina Yasumochi wasted no time in crossing Lake Hamana.79 He recovered the castle, killing or capturing many, then dispatched over half his forces to the interior and returned to his castle at Kakegawa.80 Yasumochi served for ten years as advisor to Yasuyoshi then relinquished his position and asked leave to go down to Suruga, where he lives quietly near the provincial capital. But even so, one hears he cannot avoid the call of duty.81\n\nHamamatsu Spent two days with the commissioner of the Hamamatsu Estate, now Iio Zenshirō Noritsura.82 Then went by boat from Yamazaki in that estate past Inasa Inlet to the manor of Hamana Bitchūnokami, where we had a day’s renga:83 8\n\nmizu harete sora ya satsuki no amatsutsumi\n\nClear now over the water— the sky has dressed for the ﬁfth-month rain.84\n\nKachiyama We crossed Honsaka and were guided to lodgings with the Saigō, then spent a day at Kachiyama, castle of Kumagai Echigonokami.85 We composed renga: 9\n\nōchi saku kumoi o chiri no fumoto kana\n\nBead trees blossom in the clouds, though dust covers the slope below! 86\n\nLodgings with the Makino Near Yawata, at lodgings at the residence of Makino Shirōzaemonnojō, in a ﬁeld called Honnogahara, we had a day of renga:87\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\n10\n\n\n\nyuku sode o kusaba no take no natsuno kana\n\nGrasses tall enough to touch a traveler’s sleeve— a summer ﬁeld! 88\n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 31 of 383\n\nSecond Year of Daiei ()\n\nKariya Fighting has been breaking out from time to time with no warning in this province, so we could not cross Yahagigawa river and the Eight Bridges.89 We went by boat to the castle of Mizuno Izuminokami in this province and lodged in Kariya one night.90\n\nTokoname Stayed a day at Mizuno Kisaburō’s in Tokoname in Chita District, Owari Province.91 Yoshitomo’s tomb is located at a place called Noma.92\n\nIse Senku at Yamada in Ise Province We crossed to Ōminato harbor in Ise and proceeded to Yamada, where we visited Ise Shrine.93 The matter had been raised earlier of a thousand-verse sequence to be presented to the shrine, and I had invited the priest Sōseki down for that purpose.94 He arrived near the end of the seventh month, and we began composing the sequence soon thereafter, on the fourth of the eighth month. Two hundred verses a day for ﬁve days. The work was commissioned as a votive sequence by the present shogunal deputy, Hosokawa Takakuni, when he returned to the capital from Ōmi.95 Daitokuji temple in Murasakino received his patronage when I was staying there at Shinjuan, and I composed it in gratitude for that as well.96 His hokku for the ﬁrst hundred verses was sent from Kyoto: 11\n\nasahikage yomo ni nioeru kasumi kana\n\nEverywhere aglow in the morning sunlight— the haze! 97 Takakuni\n\n12\n\nume sakite arashi mo nabiku yanagi kana\n\nPlum trees blossom, willows bend, and even the wind abates! 98 Sōchō\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\nSuch hospitality in Yamada—I could not believe my eyes.99 Sōseki then left for Owari. Knowing it was likely to snow before long, I decided to set out for the north on the sixteenth.100 There has been ﬁghting in \n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 32 of 383\n\n  this province beyond Kumozugawa river and Anonotsu, making it diﬃcult to get from place to place.101 Beyond where they are ﬁghting lives Seki Minbunotaifu, who is now retired and goes by the name Kajisai.102 It was arranged that Miyahara Shichirōbyōenojō Moritaka from Take would provide us with escorts as far as Yawata in Anonotsu, and he personally accompanied us from Yamada to Hirao, where we spent the night.103 We left Hirao when it was still dark. It began to rain in earnest about nine o’clock in the morning. The tide was high at Three Crossings, and with that and the wind Kumozugawa river again overﬂowed.104 We were accompanied to the town by many people and palanquins from Moritaka. Anonotsu has been desolate for more than ten years, and nothing but ruins remains of its four or ﬁve thousand houses and temples.105 Stands of reeds and mugwort, no chickens or dogs, rare even to hear the cawing of a crow. The wind and rain at the time were terrifying. Our escorts all returned home and no others arrived to meet us. We lost our way, and after wandering in the wrong direction we hired a local foot soldier on the advice of an acquaintance. The soldier took us two leagues to a place called Kubota.106 That night the party sent by Kajisai, equipped with palanquins and such, found us. I am amazed we saw the day through safely. Stayed there one night and had a bath. On waking in the night: 13\n\nomoitatsu oi koso urami suzukayama yuku sue ika ni naran to suran\n\nHow bitter to set out at my age across the Suzuka Mountains— what is to become of me as I travel on my way? 107\n\nKameyama As I feared, the road to Ōmi has been impassable since yesterday. Kajisai’s castle at Kameyama is three leagues into the mountains.108 We stayed at the Jōjuin subtemple of the ritsuin Shinpukuji, three chō away.109 I was surprised by how clean and neat it was. Rested there more than ten days. Each day’s pleasant company moved me deeply. There was a renga session:\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\n14\n\n\n\nyaso no se no minakami takashi aki no koe\n\nHigh, the headwaters of the eighty rapids. The sound of autumn.110\n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 33 of 383\n\nSecond Year of Daiei () This simply refers to the lines ‘‘the eighty rapids / of Suzuka River.’’ 111 15\n\nnagare mo kiri no oku fukaki yama\n\nThe current in the deep mists of the mountain recesses. Kajisai 112\n\nAt the session were Kajisai’s three ﬁne sons, aged seventeen, thirteen, and eleven, resplendent as ﬂowers in autumn ﬁelds. Fighting near here as well. No time for anything but preparations for war. The castle of the Gamō in Ōmi was reduced by the constable, and for days freebooters have been banding together.113 One hears of rear-guard skirmishes from time to time. After leaving Kameyama, we were guided through the dangerous places along the route, but the road was ﬁt only for travel on foot.114 Since it was impossible to arrange for palanquins, I considered returning to Yamada, but the rain and wind were incessant, so I stayed near Kajisai’s residence: 16\n\nazusayumi oshite harusame kyō mo furu asu mo furu to te yado ya sadamen\n\nToday too spring rain, recalling catalpa bows that one bends to string. No doubt rain tomorrow too— shall I take up lodgings here? 115\n\nBy this I meant that if it were going to continue raining, I would stay on in luxury. I wrote that poem and others in a haikai vein, littering them about my inkstone. Someone must have shown them to Kajisai, for he sent this: 17\n\nika de kimi yadori sadamen azusayumi oshite kyō furu ame nakariseba\n\nWould you have chosen, good sir, to take up lodgings here if not for the rain, recalling bent catalpa bows, that falls upon us today?\n\nAn elegant reply. Composed on request for a hokku of mine from Rokudaiin in Kubota:116 18\n\nsuzukayama iroiro ni naru kokoro kana\n\nThe Suzuka Mountains— their essence multi-hued and all-encompassing.117\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\nThis refers to the nature of the central image of that temple, Kannon. \n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 34 of 383\n\n  To dispatch someone to Echizen, one sends an escort who knows the way from here to Sakamoto.118\n\nAnonotsu We were taken from Kajisai’s to a thatched dwelling like a salting hut in a village outside Anonotsu. Stayed there the next day waiting for our escort from Miyahara Moritaka. At the urging of some people from Anonotsu, we composed some linked verse: 19\n\nkaeru yo o matsu ya shiranami aki no umi\n\nWhen will they return? The pines know not, nor the white waves of the autumn sea.119\n\nThese villagers are no doubt waiting for the time they can move back to Anonotsu. I went out to the beach when evening fell. I could see into the far distance, and ‘‘the shore at the border of Ise and Owari’’ stood out bright and clear.120 As I tarried there, some young men gathered, bringing things on hand nearby to eat and drink, as well as ﬂutes and drums, and we made merry.121 I recalled the poem: ‘‘neither cherry blossoms / nor colored foliage’’ and composed this in response to it: 20\n\nkono yūbe hana mo momiji mo aru mono o ura no tomaya no hito no kokoro ni\n\nHere this evening cherry blossoms and colored foliage abound in the heart of one by the thatched-roof huts beside the bay! 122\n\nLater that night they left. There I was, feeling ‘‘pillowed on the waves,’’ when one of the youths returned from somewhere to ease my travel loneliness.123 After he left the next morning, I sent this poem:\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\n21\n\n\n\nomowazu no ashi no karine no seze no nami shikisuterareshi nagori nashi ya wa\n\nOf that unexpected brief rest upon the reeds, touched then abandoned by the ceaseless waves, can no trace still linger? 124\n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 35 of 383\n\nSecond Year of Daiei ()\n\nKumozugawa On the ﬁrst of the ninth month we left and went back to Anonotsu harbor, taking sake back with us. Later we departed with regret and reached Kumozugawa river, where we were met by a mountain ascetic sent by Asakura Tarōzaemon Norikage. I read the letters he brought, and we then accompanied him to lodgings in Hirao. The next morning I wrote a reply: 22\n\nkoshiji ni zo nani zo wa ari to uramitsuru na wa kyō kaeru suzukayama kana\n\nWhat is the point of its being in Koshi, one wonders, vexed.

On the second of the month we reached Yamada, and I recorded my old and bent wanderings of the last few days.\n\nSaigyō Valley After the twentieth of the same month, I visited Kenkokuji temple of the Inner Shrine at Ise.126 There it was decided that we should all go to Saigyō Valley, site of that great priest’s ancient dwelling.127 We crossed Isuzu Mimosusogawa river downstream and walked along the narrow paths between the rice paddies of Yamada, pressing through the bush clover and pampas grass withered under a thin frost.128 When we reached the grounds all was quite desolate. Mountain water brought in by a bamboo pipe, pine posts from the days of old, a fence of woven bamboo, a dozen or so nuns in tumbledown quarters, paper coverlets, stitched hempen garments, the smell of anise incense—I felt the past before my eyes and put into verse what arose in my breast:\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\n23\n\nkikishi yori miru wa aware ni yo o itou mukashi oboyuru sumai kanashi mo\n\nMore poignant the sight than anything I had heard— how moving, this dwelling, so redolent of the past, in which he renounced the world!\n\n\n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 36 of 383\n\n  I wrote it on a pine fence post and went back to Kenkokuji.

I happened to be staying in Yamada when he arrived at Ise Shrine on a pilgrimage; he called on me and stayed more than ten days, until I had to leave for Takigi in Yamashiro. They tell me he was fêted thereafter in Yamada morning and evening. Then came the news he had thrown himself into Futami Bay—what could have happened to make him do such a thing? I composed this on learning of it:150 33\n\nmujōshin okosu ikkyoku ika ni shite fukishizumiken ana umi no yo ya\n\nThat one melody ‘‘Perceiving the Law of Change’’— how could he play it then sink into the sea?

His sister, a nun of the Ji sect, told them several times she would like to have his shakuhachi ﬂute returned to her so that she might sell it to pay for services in his memory. But they never sent it back. No, they never sent back the shakuhachi to exchange for money, recalling the changing shallows of Tomorrow River.152\n\nAn Exchange of Poems with Sanjōnishi Sanetaka Hearing I was at Shūon’an, Lord Sanetaka sent this:153\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\n34\n\n\n\nori ni au takigi wa ari tomo\n\nThough you have ﬁrewood for this season in Takigi,\n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 39 of 383\n\nSecond Year of Daiei () haru chikaki miyako no hana no na o mo toe kashi\n\ngive some thought as well to the ﬂowery name of the capital now that spring is near! 154\n\nThough I could not manage a suitable reply, I sent him this about winter in my mountain hut: 35\n\ntsurezure to kurasu takigi no yamazato no na o nomi tanomu yuki no uchi kana\n\nI dwell in tedium with nothing to rely on save ‘‘ﬁrewood,’’ name of this mountain hamlet, in my hut beneath the snow!\n\nA Letter to Sōseki Sōseki went to the province of Tsu and back without sending me word.

Because of his uncommon taste for renga, I inaugurated a memorial thousand-verse sequence at An’yōji temple in Higashiyama for the repose of his spirit.28 I discussed the matter with Lord Sanetaka, and for the occasion the Zen priest Shōhaku, Sōseki, Teramachi, Hahakabe, Kawarabayashi Tsushimanokami, and others came up to the capital.29 It was quite a special event.

He sent a palanquin to Kyoto for me.42 I agreed to go and arrived on the ﬁfteenth of the third month, []. Asakura Tarōzaemon Norikage had promised to contribute to the building project, and I was asked to convey this information to Daitokuji.

I then received a letter from the abbot of Shinjuan saying it was to be held in abeyance.44 I too had made arrangements for a donation, so I instead gave ﬁfty kanmon toward the repair of the main gate at Myōshōji at Takigi.45 The matter of the Daitokuji Sanmon gate remained undecided.\n\nJourney to Echizen The abbot of Shinjuan then did me the honor of calling on me at my travel lodging and told me that the temple wished me to go to Echizen again and revive the matter of a donation.46 I demurred, wondering how I could do so since Norikage had already been told that Daitokuji was postponing the project. But it was diﬃcult to decline their request, and I ﬁnally agreed to go. When I arrived, I was informed that Norikage had prepared ﬁfty thousand hiki and that others with connections to Daitokuji had pledged over twenty thousand hiki more. I hear, however, that the funds have yet to reach the capital. Now all seems indeed to have borne out the judgment of the abbot of Shinjuan.47 I have donated about thirty thousand hiki myself to date through the sale of this and that. A man named Teraki Shirōzaemon, who was recently in the capital but is now back in his home province, promised to supplement my donations in view of our particularly deep friendship.48 As of the fourth month of last summer, he too had pledged thirty thousand hiki to the temple. He wrote to me saying that depending on the results, he would donate more.

Last year for the ﬁrst time two, one large and one small, hatched chicks. It was a very rare event. The retired abbot of Ikkeken at Kenninji temple wrote of the chicks in his Yōyōki, and various poems in Chinese and Japanese were written about them as well.25 I therefore composed this: 155\n\nmata kikazu togaeru yama no mine narade sudatasesomuru niwa no matsu ga e\n\nUnheard of before: bringing chicks up from nestlings not in the mountains where they go to molt, but in the boughs of a garden pine!\n\nLeaving the Capital\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\nI had received invitations now and again to stay for a time with an acquaintance in Owari, and I accordingly left the capital on the eleventh of the fourth month on a journey to the east.26 I went south ﬁrst to Shūon’an in Takigi near Yawata, where the reverend monk Ikkyū passed away, to light incense and an\n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 62 of 383\n\n  nounce my departure. Some of my friends accompanied me to the Lower Capital, and others saw me south as far as Hōshōji and Fukakusa.27 As I took my leave, regretting our parting, I composed this: 156\n\nnagaraeba mata mo noboran miyakobito motonaku negau koto shi aru rō\n\nShould I live so long, people of the capital, I will come again— there is no need to make a special request of this old one!\n\nSee appended note.28 A comic last line—a haikai in jest. ‘‘People of the capital’’ are the ones who had come to see me oﬀ.\n\nFushimi On the way I called on the Tsuda Bizen Lay Priest in Fushimi about a promise he had made earlier to arrange for carters to carry from this port to Daitokuji a donation of lumber from the mountains around Takigi.29 The sun was still high thereafter, and I decided to hurry and go up Ujigawa river by boat. Composed on request for a hokku: 157\n\nkuretake no natsu fuyu izure yoyo no kage\n\nBeneath the bamboo in both summer and winter, shade for all the ages.30\n\nThis was in celebration of the locale.\n\nThe Water Wheels of Ujigawa River\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\nAs we went upriver from Fushimi toward Uji Bridge, we could see Mizu no mimaki pasture and Yawata Mountain.31 Kotsugawa and Ujigawa rivers ﬂow together there to form an expanse as broad as a lake.32 The people we invited from Kyoto enjoyed themselves, ‘‘beating in time on the boat sides,’’ playing shakuhachi and pipes, and singing popular songs like ‘‘Water wheels revolving in Uji’s rapids—are they turning over thoughts of this woeful world?’’ 33 The deutzia on the banks and the irises at the water’s edge looked lovely, blooming together. There were innumerable stretches of rapids, and the boatman sang old songs like ‘‘struggling against the current at a tow rope’s end.’’ 34 We ﬁnally put into shore and alighted, sorry the trip was over. \n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 63 of 383\n\nFourth Year of Daiei ()\n\nShirakawa in Uji Spent the night at Tsujinobō at Shirakawa. Before dawn I heard the cry of a waterrail: 158\n\ntani fukami kuina no meguru toyama kana\n\nSo deep the valley, the waterrail ﬂies round and round in the nearby hills.\n\nThis is a haikai verse.35 Saw Tōunken at the constabulary of this province.36 Had sake with him while waiting for our escort arrangments to be made to Takigi. He wanted to compose a single sheet of verses, but we were pressed for time, so I only composed a hokku: 159\n\nhototogisu tsuki ya ariake no asahiyama\n\nA cuckoo! The late moon in the dawn sky over Sunrise Mountain.37\n\nI was sorry to leave.\n\nFrom Takigi to Ōtsu One night at Shūon’an. I arranged for the lumber to be transported and on the thirteenth burned incense before Ikkyū’s image. The same day the young monk from Miidera named Shōzōbō who had joined me in a linked-verse session in Kyoto this spring came to escort me to a lodging at the beach at Ōtsu. That evening to Jōkōin.38 The Bettō of Hakone in Sagami lived there for two or three years when he was still in youth’s attire.39 He took his vows this spring. Hyōbukyō had the sake cups brought out, and we stayed until late at night.40 The next day the master held a session to compose a single sheet of verses. I could not avoid composing the hokku:41 160\n\nhototogisu yama no i no akanu hatsune kana\n\nAs at a mountain well, one still thirsts for more— the cuckoo’s ﬁrst call! 42\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\nThis simply makes an association with the locale through the verse, ‘‘As one thirsts for more / at a mountain well too soon / muddied by the drops.’’ \n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 64 of 383\n\n  iwao mo shiroshi sakeru unohana\n\n161\n\nThe cliﬀs too are white! Blossoming deutzia. Hyōbukyō 43\n\nThis too was based on a foundation poem, ‘‘blooming / even on the rocky cliﬀs.’’ 44 I heard that Sōseki and two companions had arrived in Sakamoto the previous day to attend a festival, so I sent a messenger to them before dawn.45 They paid me a visit later in the morning; it was most enjoyable. After we ﬁnished a single sheet of verses, sake was brought out, and Tōenbō, an old monk near to receiving his Eighty-Year Staﬀ, played shakuhachi.46 At night Hyōbukyō took up his shakuhachi as well and performed a few pieces in the hyō mode.47 It brought to mind Shunzei’s poem on the sound of pine crickets in the mugwort that he composed for a hundred-waka sequence well after reaching his eightieth year.48 Near daybreak I returned to my lodgings in Ōtsu.\n\nŌmi On the ﬁfteenth, the master of this house, Sōkei, urged us to hold a linkedverse session.49 Unable to refuse, I began it with this: 162\n\nyoru nami ya hana no yamagoe natsu no umi\n\nBreaking billows! blossoms on a mountain pass— the summer sea.\n\nThis simply means that the waves at the foot of the hills looked just like blossoms. Halfway through the session a boat came for me from the residence of Motosu Yamatonokami in Konohama.50 In a complete ﬂurry while being rowed out, I recalled the hokku I made this spring in the capital at Shōzōbō’s linked-verse session: 163\n\nitsu idete kasumu yama no ha yūzukuyo\n\nWhen did it take leave of the hazy mountain crest, the evening moon?\n\nThe following verse was composed at this temple:\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\n164\n\n\n\ntsuki o nado matare nomi su to\n\nI never understood why the moon always\n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 65 of 383\n\nFourth Year of Daiei () omoiken ge ni yama no ha wa ideukarikeri\n\nkept us waiting. Now I ﬁnd how hard it is to leave the mountain crest!\n\nIs it from Senzaishū? 51 I felt just the same as my boat departed. When night fell a wind blew up from the south, and we raced across the lake in a moment.52 It was the night of the ﬁfteenth, and the full moon rose in unclouded brilliance from behind Mirror Mountain, looking itself very like a mirror hanging in the sky.53 Linked verse again two days later: 165\n\nkuina naku muranae hakobu asato kana\n\nThe waterrail calls and villagers carry rice shoots outside the door at morning! 54\n\nThen a palanquin came for me from Kawai Suruganokami.55 To Moruyama, past Mirror Mountain.56 Linked verse the day after: 166\n\nunohana ya miru miru fureru kigi no yuki\n\nThe deutzia— falling even as I watch, snowﬂakes from treetops.57\n\nTanemura Nakatsukasanojō and others came down from Kannonji.58 Suruganokami’s son, who is called Gorō, surnamed Kawaii like his father, took part in the linked-verse session, appearing in youth’s attire.59 It was so pleasant I forgot my old age.\n\nAcross the Suzuka Mountains\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\nOn the twenty-second we departed, after having been several times detained.

From place to place people came out to guide us, and at the barriers no one challenged us. We arrived at Sakanoshita, where I received another palanquin from Kameyama and rested my aged self from the rigors of the day. That night, an inn at Sakanoshita.

It was very much like Jingoji at Mount Takao.74 The ﬁrst temple one reaches is Dairyōji.75 A brook meanders through the valley, spanned by a bridge. One is reminded of Toganoo.76 It resembles a hermit’s dwelling; the handle of one’s axe might truly rot away there.77 Had an interview with the abbot of Shōhōji. Took sake with the noon meal and thereafter with Kajisai. Became quite intoxicated. Hurried to return to Kameyama before it started to rain. The next day, the ﬁrst of the sixth month, the sun shone bright and clear. I received an invitation from Kajisai. Took my morning and evening meals at his residence, after which I returned. We composed linked verse. When I visited here the autumn before last on my way to the capital, I made this hokku for a single sheet of verses: 171\n\nyaso no se no minakami takashi aki no koe\n\nHigh, the headwaters of the eighty rapids. The sound of autumn.78\n\nI therefore felt that it would not be right for me to compose the hokku this time and demurred several times.79 Whereupon Kajisai oﬀered this: 172\n\n173\n\ntoru tabi ni mototsuha takashi yaesakaki\n\nThe more boughs one breaks oﬀ, the higher the old leaves remain— sakaki trees.80\n\nyū kakete nake yamahototogisu\n\nCall throughout the evening, mountain cuckoo! 82\n\nIkkan 81\n\nSōchō\n\nSkipped the next day, then composed another single sheet of verses:\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\n174\n\nuete konata iku kotoshi oi sono no take\n\nSince they were planted, how many years have they grown, the garden bamboo?\n\n\n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 68 of 383\n\n \n\nSightseeing at Washinosuyama Two or three days later, we breakfasted at Shōhōji temple. Slept there the night before. A bath was provided for all in my company. The next day we decided to see Washinosuyama mountain by palanquin.83 Kajisai’s invitation. The narrow, mossy path was slippery, and the water cascaded down through the valley like the sea itself. The bearers reached out for what holds they could on the rock wall but could not stop their legs. They say there was a mountain temple here in the past. Might the site be used in battle? A natural shield of cliﬀs. Pillars of rock to support a gatehouse. It appears to cover ﬁfty square chō around the valley. Here one could confront tens of thousands of soldiers with impunity. That day we visited Shōhōji and also Kōzenji, a branch temple of Tōfukuji.84 The abbot arranged a session of linked Japanese and Chinese verse: 175\n\nwashi no sumu yama to ya tōki hototogisu\n\nIs it because this is the mountain where eagles dwell that the cuckoo is so distant? 85\n\n176\n\nhito gogatsu no ryō no gotoshi\n\nIn the ﬁfth month one feels cool.86\n\nWhen we reached the back of the single sheet, sake was brought out, and we shared several cups with the acolytes.87 Did not leave till evening. Again on the twenty-ﬁfth of this month, for a monthly dedicatory linkedverse session of a temple called Jionji:88 177\n\nsamidare ni masuge no mizu no sueba kana\n\nIn the summer rains, water builds on the outer leaves of the sedge grass! 89\n\nAnd again on the twenty-ninth, at Shinpukuji: 178\n\nkaoru ka wa hanatachibana no satsuki kana\n\nA fragrance rises from the orange blossoms— the ﬁfth month! 90\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\nThis was a proxy poem for Shirō Tanemori.91 Sixth month, second day. At Kajisai’s residence, a one-round waka sequence on ﬁfteen topics.92 His son Jirō Moriyoshi chose the topics from Meidaishū, and \n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 69 of 383\n\nFourth Year of Daiei () all composed impromptu.93 Again the sake cups were brought out, and we stayed late drinking. I gave someone a fan, and he asked me to write something on it: 179\n\ntare o ka mo tomo to wa iwan nagaraeba kimi to ware to shi takasago no matsu\n\nIs there no one left that I may call a friend? If we live longer, it will be you and me and the pine of Takasago.94\n\nThere was a picture of a pine on the fan. He, seventy-eight; I, seventy-seven. At my lodging in Kameyama, Nomura Ōinosuke’s residence, they had been keeping a goose in a cage since spring. Feeling sorry for it, I ﬁlled a cask from the garden with water, fed the bird some parsley, and otherwise did what I could for it. On the morning I was to leave, I aﬃxed this poem to a post: 180\n\nkari ni shi mo tsuyu kakesutsu na sasoikon aki o tanomu no tomo ni au made\n\nDo not neglect this goose even for a moment, until it can join its friends who will come calling with the advent of autumn.95\n\nKajisai’s son Jirō Masayoshi called at my lodging unexpectedly one night. The next morning I sent him this: 181\n\nhito yori mo oi no omowan koto o shi zo kesa wa midarete kokoro to mo naki\n\nI know not of yours, but the feelings this morning of this old one are all in confusion— I am completely at a loss.\n\nHis reply: 182\n\nkokoro ni mo arade midarete omou chō hito no koto no ha kuma ya nakaran\n\nThe words that you wrote about feeling all in confusion and completely at a loss are nothing less than eloquent.96 Masayoshi\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\nAt Kajisai’s I took great comfort from all the kind people who came to visit during the disagreeable summer rains. One of the most pleasant times was when, \n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 70 of 383\n\n  during the course of a conversation, Kanbe Ukyōnoshin Morinaga showed me a Mon’ami shakuhachi.97 I praised its beauty, so he said I must have it and brooked no refusal. I sent him a note expressing my joy: 183\n\nakatsuki no tomo o zo etaru isonokami furinishi oi no kai wa nakeredo\n\nI have just found a friend for the dawn, though there is no point for one old as Isonokami to go on living longer.98\n\nOn being sent some rice cakes and two kinds of rice crackers:99 184\n\nkokorozashi miyama no shigeki sasachimaki kazu wa senshū senbei ni shite\n\nI see your kindness in rice cakes abundant as mountain bamboo and rice crackers enough to last me a thousand autumns! 100\n\nAt Kameyama, I was shown a worm-eaten scroll of a hundred-waka sequence by Sugihara Sōi, the Iga Lay Priest, written in his own hand.101 I asked to copy it. The original had been sent by the present Iganokami Takamori.102 My usual poor attempt: 185\n\nima mo yo wa sa mo koso arame isonokami furu koto no ha tagui nakaran\n\nIt is true today just as in the past! These words ancient as Isonokami Shrine can nowhere ﬁnd their equal.\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\nThere are four ritsuin temples in Kameyama: Jionji, Shinpukuji, Amidaji, and Chōfukuji, each with the requisite seven buildings.103 Aside from those, there are inns here and there, as well as east and west markets. When I had already decided to leave for Owari, I twice received messengers bearing letters telling me to arrange to go to Suruga with the physician Sei Kunaikyō Hōin.104 It was unavoidable, so I sent various people to the capital, and Kajisai ordered ﬁfty or sixty horses with their grooms to be posted from the Minakuchi station to Sakanoshita in the Suzuka Mountains to escort him here. The doctor arrived in Kameyama on the ﬁfth of the sixth month. I cannot say enough about Kajisai’s hospitality and generosity.105\n\n\n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 71 of 383\n\nFourth Year of Daiei ()\n\nFrom Kameyama to Sunpu One day of rest. On the seventh, Mori Hayatonosuke said he would see us oﬀ.106 On the ferry ‘‘at the border of Ise and Owari,’’ I had the boat pause and sent this back to the others who had come with us from Kajisai’s:107 186\n\nshizuka naru nami no awai no umizura o kaeri miru miru yuku sora zo naki\n\nLooking back and looking back toward the border and the billows that break gently on its coast, I give no thought to the way ahead.108\n\nMy stay at Kameyama lasted ﬁfty days. I cannot thank Kajisai enough for his unfailing consideration. Sixth month, seventh day. Stayed at Ōno in Owari, Chita District.109 On the eighth, a night at Kariya in Mikawa, the residence of Mizuno Izuminokami.110 Then a day at Dora Ikkōdō in the same province.111 On the tenth, stayed at Makino Denzō’s residence in Imahashi.112 The eleventh, Kibi in Tōtōmi.113 The twelfth, stayed at Iio Zenshirō’s residence in Hikuma.114 The thirteenth, lodged at Kakegawa, and remained a day.115 The ﬁfteenth, Kiganji temple in Fujieda, Suruga Province.116 The sixteenth, Fuchū.117 An evening shower was falling when we arrived, and we took shelter at Utsunoyama.118 The teahouse has long been famous for its ‘‘ten dumplings.’’ 119 The girls scooped up exactly ten with each dip of the ladle, much to our amusement. Arrived in the provincial capital that night.\n\nSunpu Two days’ rest. Audience with Lord Ryūōmaro.120 Celebratory sake. The matter of Lord Ujichika’s eye medicine. He improves daily.\n\nOkitsu\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\nI had planned to visit the site of Kiyomi Gate and oﬀered to serve as a guide for the visitors from the capital. We arrived at the residence of Okitsu Tōbyōenojō Masanobu, and on the twenty-seventh of the seventh month decided to go out to the beach after nightfall:121\n\n\n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 72 of 383\n\n  187\n\nnami no oto yūyami fukete iwazutau isoma no michi o terasu isaribi\n\nThe sound of breakers deepens with evening’s darkness, and ﬁshing torches illumine the seaside path that winds around the cliﬀs.\n\nOn the twenty-eighth at the seaside we held a one-round waka sequence on thirty topics for the visitors from the capital. We composed on topics set by the Former Palace Minister, Ōgimachisanjō Sanemochi, who currently resides in the province.122 His poem led the sequence. This was sent from Kiyomi Strand by Ohara Chikataka:123 188\n\nmatsuran to koma no ashinami yoru idete kiyomigaseki ni hirune o zo suru\n\nThinking they awaited me, I set out, pony prancing, to where waves rush in at Kiyomi Gate, but now I nod here napping! 124\n\nMy reply: 189\n\nchigirishi mo wasurenikeri na oi no nami asa mitsu shio no hirune suru made\n\nThe aged waves forgot what they had promised until the tide that rises in the morning ebbed, and you took your noontime nap! 125\n\nOn the twenty-ninth, I recalled the journey that the late Sōgi made to this province years ago, and since it was the anniversary of his death, I made a single sheet of verses to forget the years:126 190\n\nomoiizuru sode ya sekimoru tsuki to nami\n\nMy sleeve remembers— like the gate it holds the moon and waves of teardrops.127\n\nThe poem is based on a hokku Sōgi composed for a single sheet of verses at the gate when I invited him years ago to this temple, Seikenji:\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\n191\n\n\n\ntsuki zo yuku sode ni sekimore kiyomigata\n\nThe moon is departing. At least hold it on my sleeve, Strand of Kiyomi! 128\n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 73 of 383\n\nFourth Year of Daiei () Thus my verse, ‘‘My sleeve remembers.’’ In Shinkokinshū this appears: 192\n\nmishi hito no omokage tome yo kiyomigata sode ni sekimoru nami no kayoiji\n\nHold the image of my dear one, Kiyomi Strand, in the channel of the waves of tears that slip past the gate and course down my sleeves.129\n\nMight that have been the poem on which Sōgi based his? This year marks the ﬁfty-eighth since Sōgi spent the night at this temple. After the single sheet of verses, I made a poor waka on the topic ‘‘recalling the past beneath the moon’’: 193\n\ntsuki wa shiru ya kono iso narete nanasoji ni mitsu yotsu made no aki no shiokaze\n\nIs the moon aware I have known this rocky strand for seventy years and seven with their salty autumn breezes oﬀ the sea?\n\nZuiun’an subtemple is higher than the pagoda of Seikenji temple proper.130 Leaning on my staﬀ, I climbed up and, ﬁlled with enthusiasm from the day’s events, I composed this haikai waka: 194\n\nmite mo mite mo nao mata mite mo nami no ue no kumo o katashiku akatsuki no tera\n\nThough I look and look and then look once more, it sleeps alone on clouds spread upon the waves— the temple before dawn.131\n\nA man from Kyoto named Unpa built a hut near Shōkaian subtemple here after having made a vow in the capital to do so, and he lived in it for ten years and more.132 He has long since passed away, and the hut has fallen to ruin: 195\n\nmusubi oku kiyomigaiso no kusa no io arasu ya nami o katami naruran\n\nThe cottage of grass that he fashioned for himself at Kiyomi Strand has gone to ruin— will these billows be his keepsake?\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\nShōkō too came down to Suruga years ago.133 I invited him to Kiyomi Strand as well and had a boat row us about Mihogasaki.134 On the return he composed this: \n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 74 of 383\n\n  196\n\ntsuki nagara iku yo no nami o kiyomigata yosete zo arasu seki no aragaki\n\nUnder the moonlight for how many ages have the waves rolled in on Kiyomi Strand and ravaged the fence at the gate?\n\nHe wrote it on a fence post of the old Kiyomi Gate. Now even that has completely rotted away. 197\n\nkakitsukeshi hashira dani koso aragaki no kuchite nokoranu nami no koto no ha\n\nEven the post of the rude fence at the gate on which he wrote them has rotted away, and the wave-like words remain no more.\n\nAfter this temple was burned all that was left was Lord Tōjiin’s image hall. Shōkō prayed before the statue of Kankoku that stood in a dusty corner and, weeping bitter tears, composed this:135 198\n\nkiyomigata seki no aragaki yoru nami o mukashi ni kaese kuni zo sakaen\n\nWould that the rude fence of the gate at Kiyomi might send back to the past the waves that come rolling in and see the nation prosper.136\n\nHe then returned. Shōkō thereafter desired to have a part of the fence made into a box for poem strips, and soon Lord Yoshitada ordered it done and sent oﬀ. Shōkō also asked him to include one of his own compositions: 199\n\ntazunetsu to miyako ni katare kiyomigata kore zo shirushi no seki no aragaki\n\nTell all in the capital that you were here— this piece from the rude fence at Kiyomi Strand will bear witness.\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\nShōkō had the poem lacquered in makie on the lid and treasured it. The constable of Noto now has it, I am told.137\n\n\n\n5973 Horton / THE JOURNAL OF SOCHO / sheet 75 of 383\n\nFourth Year of Daiei ()\n\nFujimasu Fujimasu, a lad of thirteen or fourteen, writes with a truly accomplished hand.138 At his father’s Ichikawa residence, the day after the beginning of the eighth month, we composed a single sheet of verses.139 Fujimasu as scribe: hayashisomete iku soma no hana hagi no tsuyu\n\n200\n\nPraise the bush clover growing up like mountain timber, dew on its blossoms.\n\nThis was meant as praise of the lad’s accomplished hand and correct demeanor, using the poem (from Man’yōshū?) that goes ‘‘made from bush clover / growing straight as timber / and just beginning to ﬂourish.’’ I believe that verse uses somakata to mean bush clover growing widely dispersed and therefore straight and tall.140\n\nSunpu We returned to Sunpu. A linked-verse session for the visitors from the capital: 201\n\nsasowareba miyako no fuji no aki no yuki\n\nWere it invited, Fuji would bring autumn snow to the capital.\n\nWhat this means is that if Mount Fuji here could be invited to the capital, there would be snow in the capital in autumn.141 Through the middle of the eighth month, the cuckoo sang both night and day, making my mealtimes unbearable: 202\n\nkiku tabi ni mune warokereba hototogisu hetotogisu to koso iu bekarikere\n\nEach time I hear you I feel queasy, cuckoo bird, so one really ought to call you ‘‘puke-oo bird’’ instead.142\n\nTseng 2002.2.16 15:18\n\nIn the beginning of the ninth month, I rode about four or ﬁve chō from here and on the way home fell from my horse.
