Hase is only the fifth governor of Ishikawa since 1947 when prefectural governors became elected offices, as Tanimoto had held the governorship for twenty eight years, first coming to office in 1994, succeeding Yōichi Nakanishi, who had served from 1963 until his death in 1994.\n\nThe Ishikawa Prefectural Assembly [ja] has 43 members and is elected in unified local elections (last round: 2011) in 15 SNTV electoral districts – six single-member, five two-member, one three-member, two four-member districts and the Kanazawa City district that elects 16 members. As of February 26, 2014, the LDP prefectural assembly caucus has 25 members and no other group has more than four members.[9]\n\nIn the National Diet, Ishikawa is represented by three directly elected members of the House of Representatives and two (one per election) of the House of Councillors. Additional members from the prefecture may be elected in the proportional representation segments of both houses: the Hokuriku-Shin'etsu proportional representation block in the lower house, the proportional election to the upper house is nationwide. After the Diet elections of 2010, 2012 and 2013, the five directly elected members from Ishikawa districts are all Liberal Democrats, namely:\n\nin the House of Representatives\n\nfor the 1st district that covers Kanazawa City: Hiroshi Hase, LDP, 5th term,\n\nfor the 2nd district that consists of Southern parts of Ishikawa and had been the district of former LDP president Yoshirō Mori until 2012: Hajime Sasaki, LDP, 1st term,\n\nfor the 3rd district in the North: Shigeo Kitamura, LDP, 3rd term,\n\nin the House of Councillors\n\nin the class of 2010 (term ends 2016): Naoki Okada, LDP, 2nd term, and\n\nin the class of 2013 (term ends 2019): Shūji Yamada, LDP, 1st term who was able to defeat Democratic incumbent and former defense minister Yasuo Ichikawa by a huge margin in 2013.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\n2024 Noto earthquake\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nNussbaum, Louis-Frédéric and Käthe Roth.
