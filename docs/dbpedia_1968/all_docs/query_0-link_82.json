GENERAL CHAPTER 1 THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF POST-WAR JAPAN AND THE PRESENT SITUATION (1957) Kikuo Yamaoka The subject of this paper is the Japanese economic situa- tion in 1957, but as it seems impossible to take up the problem by merely discussing the happenings of so brief a period, I believe that it is better to view thoroughly the causes of the problems which are now confronting Japan. I would like to do this by introducing a current economic phenomenon as an example. The Japanese economy in 1955 and 1956 enjoyed a pros- perity which was called the \" Jimmu Boom \"* According to the United Nations \" Report on World Economy \", Ja- pan stood first on the list among the advanced capitalist nations as to the rate of growth in industrial production. This \" Jimmu Boom \", however, came to an end and did an about-face when at the end of 1956 the nation's balance The reason why the prosperity, which lasted for almost two years from 1955 through the end of 1956, was commonly called the \" Jimmu Boom \" is that it was the greatest eco- nomic prosperity that Japan has enjoyed since the first Emperor Jimmu- It was also called the \" Quantity Boom \" because it was brought about without a price rise. 2 GENERAL of payments grew suddenly worse due to an excessive ex- pansion of the economy. The tendency toward excess of imports reached its climax in the first half of 1957. Under these circumstances the Japanese Government had to change from an expansionist economic policy to a \" tight money \" policy. The Japanese economy thus plunged into a deflationary period. What accounts for this abrupt change in the economic situation in 1957? The answer can be given only by reviewing the path along which the post-war economy of Japan has wandered. II The Japanese economy immediately after the surrender in August, 1945, was in a paralytic state because of the huge loss of national assets and the destruction caused by the prolonged war. The level of national assets remain- ing right after war was about the same as in 1935. The index of industrial activity (1934-36 base period) in 1945 was 63. 2 which was about one-third of the figure for 1944. The situation got worse in 1946. The index declined to 39. 2. An accumulation of innumerable difl^iculties stood in the way of the rehabilitation of the Japanese economy the level of production of which had fallen to the bottom. The first bottle-neck in industrial rehabilitation was the capital loss throughout industry and the shortage of natural resources resulting from the loss of land and territory. In addition there was a deficiency of raw materials as well as power. The rapid progress of inflation in the post-war period also became a hindrance to the recovery plan. The fall of real wages made the working class conscious of unequal distribution and led to frequent strikes. Thus, along with the loss of the will to work, a decrease of productivity was unavoidable. The reparations payments as part of the demilitariza- ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 3 tion policy, the core of the Occupation poHcy in its earher stage, affected the direction of development of the heavy chemical industry. The anti-monopoly policy, which was said to be one of the three main reforms, also was con- nected with demobilization. The dissolution of the Zai- batsu, or financial cliques, began in the autumn of 1945. The personal as well as capital Zaibatsu combinations, which had the leadership of Japanese industry for a long period, were eliminated causing a revolution in the basic structure of the Zaibatsu. The dissolution of the Zaibatsu, however, reached its peak when the Anti-monopoly Law and the Law for the Elimination of Excessive Concentra- tion of Economic Power came into effect in 1947. Further- more, the Law for Rural Land Reform, the second of the three big reform policies became effective in October 1946. As the result of the third policy, democratization of re- lations between capital and labor, the organization rate and power of labor unions rose rapidly. The unions which regarded economic ectivity as their major function organ- ized the Japan General Federation of Workers Union (Sodomei). The leftwing labor unions were united under the direction of the Industrial Workers Union Concil (San- betsu). They both underwent changes. In 1950, Sodomei split into several factions. It is worthy of note that San- betsu, which was labeled as the most leftist labor union, lost its power, while Sohyo (The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan) which belonged to Sodomei, came to represent the leftwing labor unions and is the most in- fluential labor union today. As a result of the economic paralysis after the war, a crisis of reduced production approached in the fall of 1946. Consequently, at that time the government adopted what is called the \" Inclined Production Formula \" and invested a great amount of national funds in such fundamental industries as coal and steel so that whole industries were 4 GENERAL stimulated to greater production. As a result of this for- mula, the reconstruction of industry got underway and the production level began to move upward. This \" Inclined Production Formula \" was backed financially by both the Financial Deficit Policy and the Reconversion Finance Bank. The former was a system aiming to cover the differentials of profitable condition with the subsidy ; the latter was a financial organization whose main purpose was to back the \" Inclined Production Formula \" financially. Since the \" production first policy \" required a large amount of funds, it depended almost entirely upon credit from the Bank of Japan for its source of money. Therefore, this policy could not hold in check the factors which accelerated the inflation. Ill In order to meet the situation, the GHQ gradually strengthened the stabilization policy, the purpose of which was to normalize the economy. The starting point of this stabilization program was marked by the Draper Reports (the reports made by the Draper Delegation) published in the spring of 1948. In addition, Japan was visited by the Young Delegation. After the Young Delegation returned to the USA, the GHQ recommended that the Japanese Government carry out the \" Ten Principles for Economic Stabilization \" which were announced by the Government. These \" Ten Principles \" concerned the general policies for checking the growth of inflation. Shortly after this, the *' Three Principles of Enterprises \" were announced by the GHQ. These principles stressed self-support of enterprise thiough the stabilization of wages. After having gone through these preparatory steps, the American Government instructed the Japanese Government in the so-called \" Nine Principles for Economic Stabiliza- ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 5 tion.\" This marked the beginning of the Dodge Line, which brought drastic changes in the Occupation poHcy. The aim of the \" Nine Principles \" was to end Japan's de- pendence on the American economy and to make her eco- nomically self-supporting through the development of ex- ports. As an indispensable means, the principles stressed the necessity of economic stabilization centering around the stabilization of the currency. They also insisted that the independent economy should be attained by a self- achieved expansion of exports which complemented the cut in aid. In order to achieve this aim the stabilization of the yen in connection with the world economy was given top priority. With the arrival of Minister Dodge in 1949, the single exchange rate was set up. Furthermore the deflation policy was put into practice at once by adopt- ing the so-called \" surplus budget \" which swept the red figure away and decreased the amount of currency with the black figure. The Dodge Line urged the Japanese economy to make an attempt, at self-support based upon a capitalistic budget with the abolition of subsidies. It also urged price cuts and rationalization in the free competitive market. The Japanese economy was switched from the *' Inclined Pro- duction Formula \" based on priority industrial fields to the \"Concentrated Production Program\" based upon priority enterprise. The change promoted the reorganization of of the basic industries and the export industries with a re- sulting increase in the operation rate and reduction in over - employment . On the other hand, however, the price fall, decrease in demand and the shortage of funds intensified the pressure on small and medium firms which were suffering from a shortage of capital. They were in a weak competitive position and were reduced to the status of subcontractors of the bigger firms. Thus stabilization was achieved. As 6 GENERAL a part of the Dodge Line, tax reform was to rationalize the tax system and to reduce inequahty by an increase in direct taxes. IV The outbreak of the Korean war in June, 1950, placed Japanese industries in a completely different situation which marked the beginning of a new stage in the development of the postwar Japanese economy. The Korean war altered American foreign and domestic policies. The national de- fense production law of September, 1950, the state of emergency proclamation of President Truman in December, 1950, cessation of an easy policy toward the communist countries and many other measures which promoted the defense system appeared in rapid succession. This was accompanied by a big change in the US attitudes toward Japan. The change was reflected in the creation of a police reserve force on August 10, 1952, and promotion of a peace treaty with Japan. Above all, the tense relations between the US and the Soviet Union placed pressure on Japan to join the western block. The move toward the peace treaty started in the first part of 1950 and brought forth the Peace Conference at San Francisco and the signing of the US- Japan Mutual Security Pact in September, 1951. In February, 1952, the US -Japan Mutual Administrative Agreement was signed and in April Japanese independence was restored with the effectuation of the peace talks as well as the Mutual Se- curity Pact. After the outbreak of the Korean war the US demanded that the Japanese economy become self-supporting at an early date and that Japan participate in the western de- fense block. Therefore, economic cooperation between ing US and Japan was intensified. However, the boom ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 7 resulting from the Korean incident began to show a tendency toward slackening from March, 1951. There were a good many reasons for this. First of all the US and the rest of the west European nations had obtained enough raw material stocks and their demand for materials from abroad became stagnant. Secondly, the war was making no progress, and a truce was proposed by Malik on June 26, which was followed by the Korean Armistice Conference and the easing of armament plans. The Korean boom had lost its impetus and investment for moderniza- tion became prevalent. The active investment of various industries concentrated around modernization of fixed capital and finally reached a postwar peak in 1953. It took such forms as modernization of techniques in steel and other heavy industries, expansion of equipment and development of new products in textile and chemical in- dustries, and domestic production of new types of machines. The investment for modernization in the fields of electric power and marine transportation had contributed greatly to the modernization of related industries. It was right that enterprises should be much concerned about over- coming technical backwardness. But the effect on pro- fitability was not ascertained. Investments were often carried out by management at the expense of price level stability. Excessive business dependence on loans in the course of modernization produced another inflationary trend. Moreover, increased investment for modernization resulted in an increase of income and consumption which stimulated imports. Because of high domestic prices ex- ports did not increase. The poor rice crop in 1952 neces- sitated unexpected payments for imported foodstuffs. Consequently, the international balance of payments showed a deficit of $300 million even with special procurements included. It was an unusually serious situation. The tight banking control which essentially aimed at the 8 GENERAL abolition of the favored import fund and restriction of bank loans began in October, 1953. It initiated a defla- tionary policy. Meanwhile, the Zaibatsu firms, which had been divided into many smaller enterprises, began reunifi- cation through the absorption and control of smaller firms. As the deflationary policy proceeded, business firms built up resistance against the deflation by adopting sound man- agerial policies. The large concerns, however, also tried to solve their problems at the expense of subcontractors, stopping orders and cutting costs as is usual with big business when it attempts to curtail operations in a de- flationary period. These small and middle-size enterprises suffered from a lack of funds because of the tight money policy, which began to take the form of enterprise adjust- ment. Adjustment through deflationary policy continued until early in 1954, but by the latter part of 1954 exports ex- panded in response to the prosperity in foreign countries. The international balance of payments for the fiscal year of 1954 showed a favorable balance amounting to $300 million. In 1955 exports increased by 30%. The economic prosperity in 1955 might be ascribed partly to the fact that investment for modernization began to have an effect on the rationalization of industry. From this time on industries began to take a persistent interest in higher productivity as a means of maintaining profits which had taken off the mionetary veil. Thus in 1955 Japanese industry began to pave the way toward greater economic stability and expansion. The accumula- tion of profits enabled business firms to pay back loans and to judge their profits from the standpoint of a reason- able basis. Since 1955 at least big industries could increase self-financing and also arranged the control operating body. In general, 1955 marked the most prosperous year Japan had enjoyed since the end of World War II. Three de- ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 9 velopments account for the prosperity. First, there was the improvement in the international balance, which suc- ceeded in achieving the long-term goal of a favorable balance with special procurements excluded. In 1953, al- though there were special procurements amounting to $800 million, the international balance showed a large red figure. In 1954 it narrowly showed a black figure with special procurements included. So the favorable balance in 1955 could be described as the culmination of hop, skip and jump improvement. The second reason for the prosperity was economic ex- pansion without inflation. Industrial production increased by 12%, agricultural output by 19% and national income by 10%. It was because the increase was attained with scarcely any rise in prices that the prosperity was called a quantity boom. The third reason was the development of economic normalization. The inflation which had con- tinued for a long time after the termination of war was distinctly improved in 1955 in its financial aspects. Al- though the inflationary trend left some scars in various fields of industry, the overloan situation was remarkably improved and both long and short-term interest rates were rapidly lowered. In 1956 the increase in industrial production was 23. 4%. This was three times as much as the 7% the Government anticipated in the \" Five-year plan.\" The national income increased by 13.9%, which was more than twice as much as the projected annual increase of 5%. The export in- crease of 21% was nearly three times the scheduled 8%. Civilian investment increased 60. 5% as against the pro- jected 7%. Thus from 1955 through 1956 the Japanese economy rejoiced in the \" Jimmu Boom,\" and in 1956 Japan attained first rank among nations, excluding Communist China, in the rate of increase of industrial production. In 1957, however, the prosperity hit a stumbHng block quite 10 GENERAL unexpectedly and the economy was forced to follow the road to deflation. How can this be accounted for? In 1956, backed by the world-wide prosperity, Japan's foreign trade expanded. However, during the latter part of the year the favorable international balance was rapidly reduced and by the end of the year an alarming stage had been reached. The balance of foreign exchange showed a favorable figure over a period of two years from 1954 to 1955, and in 1956 saw a sudden increase in payments. Though a slight black figure was kept on the balance sheet, it showed a big red figure in the actual balance and foreign currency reserves decreased rapidly. As was pointed out in the \" Economic White Paper,\" the situation was due primarily to too rapid expansion and to the in- vestment boom which caused the increase in imports. The so-called \" Quantity Boom \" from 1956 to the early part of 1957 and the innovation boom with its world-wide background involved the modernization and expansion of facilities in all industries. However, the rapid expansion was accompanied by not a few danger signals which should not be overlooked. The first red signal was the increase in dependence on foreign trade as a result of the expansion caused by the investment boom. There was such a great concentration of demand for iron and steel and electric power that the amount of imports of scrap iron, ore, coal and petroleum, etc., reached $400 million and constituted 40% of the total import excess. As is usual in the case of rapid economic growth in which production from raw materials cannot meet the demand Japan imported semi-manufactured goods. The result was a $200 million increase imports of steel, machinery, medicines, and chemical products. The import ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 11 structure of Japan shows a tendency towards a decrease in the relative importance of foodstuffs, cotton, and wool and an increase in iron, steel, and fuels. In 1956 fuels and goods related to heavy industry increased to 45% of the total amount of imports. The second indication was the shortage of capacity in such basic industries as iron and steel, electric power and transportation. The investment boom turned out to be a rapid increase of demand in these three fields. How- ever, the expansion in these fields could not keep pace with that of other fields and the shortage cast a gloomy shadow portending a rise in costs and stagnation in in- dustrial development. The third was the change in the financial situation. June was the turning point. From then to the end of the year the change proceeded rapidly. In March, 1957, an upward revision of the official rate of discount was put into effect to adjust the nation's in- ternational payments and another revision took place in May. As it was realized that the increase of imports was caused not only by the growth of raw material imports but by the rapid rise of domestic income levels due to the investment boom, an all-round policy, including the authori- zation of postponement of financial investment and ac- cumulation of funds as an emergency counter-measure for the improvement of the international trade accounts, was brought forth. Moreover, the positive financial policy based on the 1957 budget which was compiled in 1956 gave an impetus to civilian investment. It was true that this fact increased the domestic demand for imported raw materials to the detriment of foreign currency reserves. Thus, in preparing the fiscal 1958 budget during the sum- mer of 1957 emphasis was placed on avoiding undue stimulus to the economy. The tight money policy, as the first step toward the 12 GENERAL deflationary policy, began to exert a gradually stronger influence in May, June and July. All enterprises were heavily affected by the rapid development of financial dis- tress. The retrenchment of import funds gave an es- pecially hard blow to the traders. The shock caused by the measures taken to counteract the shortage of foreign currency appeared first in the financial area and then be- gan to extend to the production stage. There was a sign of a decrease of imports in July. In September the net change in the foreign exchange balance showed a black figure amounting to $19 million after a lapse of ten months. The substantantial black figures during the months of October, November and December reached $165 million. The temporary improvement of the international trade balance after September hid not a few problems among which was a declining trend in both exports and imports. VI The Japanese economy, which may be called the \" trad- ing type,\" has difficulty in adjusting to changes in the na- tion's international trade balance. Since the economy is still weak, compared with other advanced capitalistic countries, growth is an indispensable condition and invest- ments are important to achieve it. Excessive investment, however, through its adverse effect on the trade balance creates a situation which necessitates the restriction of growth itself. Of course, it is desirable for Japan, whose natural resources and capital are limited, to increase pro- duction as much as possible with imports and investment kept to a minimum. However, this requires increasing industrial productivity and economic efficiancy. Let us look into the agricultural field. Including 1957, Japan recorded above-average harvests thrice in succes- sion. The successive rich harvests were due to the land ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 13 reform which had been put into practice after the ter- mination of the war. The land reform established the foundation for the agricultural production and agricultural skills have been remarkably improved as the result of guidance by the government. These factors contributed to the growth of agricultural productivity, but many agri- cultural problems still remain to be solved. As far as income and consumption standards are concerned Japanese agriculture has made progress but the gap between the living standards of farming population and city dwellers is still wide. Again, Japan has not yet achieved self- sufficiency in foodstuff. Its weakness in international com- petition under the present situation of a world-wide sur- plus of foodstuffs is another problem. Side-occupations in agricultural areas are more popular now than in pre- war times. The farming population has increase more than 10% as compared with that of prewar days. Shorter working hours, older farmers and more women workers are becoming more characteristic. These facts not only indicate that the comparative productivity of agriculture is far below the level of industry but that the raising of its productivity should be given priority in future agri- cultural policies. However, one should not overlook the bright side of Japanese agriculture and that is its current trend toward modernization. The increased production of durable consumption goods of a new type manufactured by progressive industrial techniques together with increased demands have made modernization and higher consumption possible. This tendency was first seen in the cities, but in 1956-57 it reached the villages. Electrification of rural villages has also been common in recent years. Just a word in conclusion. The Japanese economy must follow a narrow path full of thorns and thistles in order to realize its economic goals. For instance, the differences between big industries and small- medium enterprises and 14 GENERAL agriculture are increasing, though there has been remark- able progress in industrial techniques and technical innova- tion in big industries. Reducing the disparity in producti- vity that lies between Japan and the advanced industrial nations, renovating the whole structure of economy, and completing the modernization of production methods are all tasks confronting the Japanese economy with may difficult problems which may take a long time to solve. CHAPTER 2 JAPAN'S EDUCATIONAL CURRICULUM by Yosaburo Naito Introduction In post-war Japan education has faced many difficulties due to changes in economics, politics and thought patterns. These changes have brought about a reformation of the school system and the teacher training system ; improve- ment of school facilities, equipment and educational meth- ods ; and revision of the educational curriculum. Im- mediately following the war under the direction of the U. S. Occupation these changes were accompHshed rapidly. The first change in education was adoption of the 6- 3-3-4 system. Administration and phvsical plants were also affected. Though there were not enough buildings those available were made to do. But these are only one part of education. There was still need to establish and improve the administrative system, consider the content of education and raise the level of educational efficiency. I. Revision of the Educational Curriculum In 1947 with the begining of the new educational system, compulsory education was enforced through junior high school. This was reemphasized in 1951 and is still in effect. This also was begun at the suggestion of the Occupation and did not entirely fit the needs of Japan. But now Japan has become an independent nation, has joined the United Nations, and has even become a member of the 16 GENERAL Security Council of that body. Thus it has become a member of a new international society. For this reason Japan must make up its mind to work for the peace of the world and the prosperity of the human race. It must try to live harmoniously with all countries. Meanwhile, the world has made such rapid progress in culture, science and industry that it is bewildering. Japan must make her industry prosperous and expand her trade in keeping with the world situation. This is the time for her to develop a truly independent country. After reviewing the educational situation of the past ten years, and taking into consideration the world situa- tion, Japan has decided to plan a rapid rise in the educa- tional standards of the country. Fundamental to this change is the desire to educate Japanese who are worthy of the respect and trust of people in international society. The aims have been considered and well carried out in schools in the present day. The Ministry of Education is planning to revise and to enrich the educational curri- culum so as to develop good Japanese citizens who are cultured, democratic and well trained, and at the same time useful citizens who are trusted and respected as in- dividuals in the world. However, the object is not to de- velop people with no definfte nationality traits. We want them to be Japanese with an understanding of the classics, traditions and culture of their ancestors ; of the Japanese history which shows the progress of Japanese culture ; and of Japanese geography which teaches them Japan's place in the world. But this does not mean a return to the narrow-minded nationalistic training of pre-war days. Japanese education is based on the philosophy of humanism and the principal of world brotherhood. We are trying to educate people who are willing to contribute to the prosperity of the race and a race that is willing to work for world peace. In order to do this we must JAPAN'S EDUCATIONAL CURRICULUM 17 try to eliminate racial prejudice which developed as a reaction to the Occupation and help youth to understand the serious fact of defeat. We must educate them to be Japanese of ability and self-confidence. This will make them respected by people of the world and able to con- tribute to an international society. We plan to improve scientific technique and moral education. Present changes in primary and junior high school were started in 1956 and the plan was put into force in March of this year (1958), after careful study by the Education Council. This Education Council, composed of scholars and teachers who are experts in this field, was organized by the Educational Minister and held more than forty meet- ings during the ten year period to discuss the program from all angles. Because of the lack of time to develop an adequate program and choose textbooks for all grades, we are emphasizing moral education, standard scholarship and scientific courses in the third year of junior high school. These courses will be in accordance with the total pro- gram. It will be put into force in August. It is expected that the new textbooks will be completed by April, 1961, for elementary schools, and by April, 1962, for junior high schools. II. Moral Education Until the end of the war, ethics was taught in all schools. However this ethics course, along with geography and history, was removed from the curriculum by order of the Occupation. This was because these courses were used to foster militarism and super-nationalism before the war. A new social science course containing geography, history and civics replaced these courses. While moral education taught through a social science course can emphasize human 18 GENERAL relations and man's place in society, this is inadequate unless it is developed to a higher level. For example, it is necessary to deepen moral feelings and understanding by practical application. This is not possible in the social science course. Moral teachings are also contained in Japanese literature, music and in physical education which trains the body and develops strong will. But this is only incidental to the content of the course. Moral education is also carried out in extra-curricular activities quite effectively but it is not systematic enough to teach real morals that become part of the students character. It is proper that moral education be taught as a part of all education and it is not our intention to eHminate it from any of the existing courses. Rather we hope to encourage and strengthen it. At the same time we de- cided to introduce a new course of '' morals \" in primary and junior high school from April. In Europe and Amer- ica it is generally accepted that morals and religion can not be separated. In those countries moral education is taught at home, school, church and in society, all based on Christianity. Usually schools teach courses on morals about two hours a week. For example, group service and religious education are required of all students in England. The constitution of West Germany requires that two hours a week of religious education be taught in the schools. In America, Bible reading takes the place of moral education in some states and in France they have required moral courses. Both Soviet Russia and China have very strict training and rules which students must follow. In Japan we have no established religion so moral edu- cation is very important. There are some who object to putting morals courses in primary and junior high school on the grounds that they will be like the old ethics JAPAN'S EDUCATIONAL CURRICULUM 19 courses, which, like the Imperial Rescript on Education, had the aim of teaching virtue combined with loyalty and filial piety. Those courses were taught on the basis of one-sided explanations by the teacher and memorization by the pupil. It is not our desire to revive this kind of education. Instead, we want to offer courses that will prepare the students for the new democratic society, based on the spirit to the Fundamental Law of Education and the Constitution. Therefore it must be based on the prin- cipals of the universality of mankind and appreciation of human beings. These principals are common to all coun- tries of the world. The objects of the morals course are to give the students an understanding of how to live each day ; to es- tablish habits of moral conduct ; to develop a moral con- sciousness ; to develop the ability to judge right and wrong ; to develop the individual and help him establish a creative attitude toward life ; to develop democratic citizens of the nation and society ; and to educate Japanese who can contribute to a peaceful international society. The teacher will teach the course through reading and discussing stories and actual experiences which are ap- propriate to the child's maturity and experience. The teacher must be careful not to limit the course to ex- planations and one-sided teaching only. This morals course was begun in elementary schools in April of this year and will be begun in junior high schools in April of next year. It will be taught one hour a week. Private schools that teach a special religious course as a required subject may substitute that course for the morals course. This is because of the recognition that religious education and moral education have common aims and effects. It is also important to establish courses of religious education in public schools at all levels. Beautiful and pure things should be used as teaching 20 GENERAL materials in order that the students may develop pure hearts of mutual love and a faith in eternity of a religious nature. III. Promotion of Education in the Scientific Field Since the end of World War II, there has been rapid advance in the scientific field which has had far-reaching effects upon management and administration as well as upon production and industry. This has made such a change in industry that we may say a second industrial revolution has begun. But in Japan scientific technology is far behind in development because of damage during the war followed by a period of confusion and exhaustion, superannuation of equipment and experimental apparatus, and the shortage of study funds. This lag in develop- ment is hindering industrial advance which is based on scientific technique. At present it is necessary for Japan to import foreign teclmology in order to open a new field of industry. If the Japanese people are to raise their standard of in- dustrial technology, it is important to emphasize scientific and industrial technology in the schools. Only in this way can Japan retrieve the autonomy of her industry, re- store its power to compete in the international market, extend trade, and develop the cultural life of the country. The development of scientific technique is possible only when people have developed a scientific way of think- ing and when they can behave rationally and pragmati- cally. Only on a basic application to daily life can science become wholesome and highly developed. In this sense, science education in primary and high school can be said to be the nucleus of scientific enlightment of the people. In order to promote science education, it is necessary to improve and enrich the school curriculum, provide good equipment, train new teachers, and retrain the old teachers. JAPAN'S EDUCATIONAL CURRICULUM 21 With regard to the improvement of the school curriculum in elementary and junior high school, m.any discussions are being held. In this connection the Deliberative Council for the School Curriculum made the following suggestions : (a) to enrich the content of the teachers' guides on arithmetic, mathematics, science, and the related subjects such as drawing, manual work, vocational subjects, and domestic science ; (b) to give more time to drill in science and mathematics ; and (c) to rearrange the present required subjects in high school and set up a new course with certain parts which are considered industrial and technical from the courses of drawing, handicraft, do- mestic science, and vocational subjects. The Ministry of Education is seriously thinking of putting the suggestions made in this report into effect. The present science curriculum is too full and some con- fusion is found concerning what is basic and what is not. Often students are taught trivial or fragmentary know- ledge about their daily life but not taught basic things in a systematic way. With the change in the curriculum, it is necessary to select the best materials that will teach the students the fundamental things in science. At present experimentation and observation in science classes are very poorly done because of a lack of well trained teachers and good equipment. The plan is to over- come this with the use of 30 million yen ($83,300) half of which was provided by the national government under the 1954 Promotion of Science Education Law and half of which was provided by the individual schools. Also elementary and junior high schools may use funds from their regular appropriations for this purpose. Additional funds will be made available in 1958. One of the most urgent needs at present is for better science classrooms. Another urgent need is for better trained teachers. The present teachers who are graduates 22 GENERAL of four-year universities lack adequate training in ex- perimentation and this is reflected in their classes which are largely textbook centered. The Ministry of Education, in an effort to overcome this, has planned a five-year series of lectures for the re- education of science teachers to begin in 1958. The Educational Committee of each prefecture will sponsor these courses with funds furnished by the Ministry of Education. During the five-year period it is expected that at least one teacher from each elementary school and half of the science teachers in junior and senior high schools will attend these lectures. We also plan to make it possible for students to take courses that will give them a good overall knowledge of science. Because of the advance in scientific technique all over the world, industry in Japan is in need of industrial tech- nicians in spite of the unemployment in other fields. By 1960, when the five-year plan ends, there will be a de- mand for 270,000 medium standard technicians in the fields of mechanics, electricity, civil engineering, chemistry, industrial chemistry, and architecture. And there will be a demand for 26,000 advanced technicians in these same fields. To meet this need we are striving to promote industrial science in junior and senior high schools through better teaching materials and equipment, and by cooperation with the educational programs of commercial companies. Education is compulsory only through junior high school, from which there are about two million graduates a year. Of these graduates, half go on to high school and the other half enter business or stay at home. With this in mind we have allowed students to elect courses in Englisli, vocational subjects, and domestic science. But the schools have not adequately met the needs of either of the two groups of students, because the system was not well JAPAN'S EDUCATIONAL CURRICULUM 23 plaimed. In revising the school curriculum, more electives are planned for the third year of junior high school so that those going into business can take technical and vocational courses and those going to senior high school can take such subjects as English or mathematics. The school cur- riculum should be more elastic so that it will fit the in- dividual student. This does not mean that we plan to have two separate courses, or that we plan to reestablish the plural school system that we abolished just after World War II. We do plan to make it possible for all people to pursue the course that fits them best. The Ministry of Education is planning to set-up a new required course in science technique and at the same time strengthen the vocational course. The new course will combine various elements previously taught in vocational and domestic science with some elements of industrial technique previously taught in mechanical drawing. This course will contain two types of . subjects ; one centered on handicrafts for ^boys and one centered on domestic science for girls. It will be carefully planned and closely connected with science and allow for elective subjects. Vocational and domestic science will be made elective courses. Agriculture, industry, commerce, and marine production will also be added as elective courses, thus giving a wide range of courses which will prepare the student for the future. At present the ratio of senior high students in normal courses and those in vocational courses is 6 to 4. Since only 25% of the students go on to college, this ratio is felt to be disproportionate, especially since those students desiring to find jobs have much difficulty in doing so. The Ministry of Education desires to change the ration to 4 to 6 in the future. In order to push this, it is urging 24 GENERAL senior high schools with technical courses to add mecha- nical and electrical courses so that there will be at least one in every prefecture in 1958. In night senior high schools, which serve working young people, much attention is being given to education along the lines of industrial technique. Over half of the students in these night schools take the normal course while only 6. 6% of the graduates go on to college. This indicates a need to enlarge the vocational course in such schools to give students practical education for their present jobs. Often urgent requests are received by the schools from business leaders to train low grade technicians in short courses. In order to meet these requests a special course is being considered by the Ministry of Education. This will help working young people raise the level of their technical knowledge. Each prefecture is being urged to establish such a course. It is hoped that they will have at least one each in 1958. At present many fectories and department stores have their own schools to teach technique to young employees. It is the urgent concern of the Ministry of Education to establish a connection between these schools and the public night schools, so as to avoid duplication. It is hoped that the factories and department stores can be presuaded to add additional courses so that they can be recongized as part of the night school system. This will make it pos- sible for students who take such courses to complete their senior high school unit requirements by correspondence and thus receive senior high school diplomas. This is in line with the present systems of England and Germany, where certain hours of compulsory education are given in the factory for workers under eighteen. Thus by pushing up the industrial education of work- ing young people, the standard of Japanese industry can be raised and at the same time young people in general JAPAN'S EDUCATIONAL CURRICULUM 25 can obtain hope and joy. Surely this will be a decisive factor for Japan's future in the world of international trade. V. Raising the Standard of Compulsory Education In order to improve the content of courses, promote moral education, and give greater emphasis to scientific teclinical courses, it is necessary to discontinue the over- crowded conditions existing in classrooms, and organize classes of normal size. At present 140,000 classes in ele- mentary and junior high school have more than 50 desks. The present plan calls for reducing classes to fifty or less in two years in junior high schools, and in five years in elementary schools. The size of the class has a close relationship with the number of available teachers. In 1958 there will be a de- crease in the numbe-i of junior high students by about 500,000, which means there will be a surplus of 10,000 teachers. These teachers should not be discharged but rather use to reduce the size of classes in other schools. Contrary to the situation in junior high schools, the number of students in elementary schools will increase by about 500,000, calling for an increase of about 10,000 teachers. Both in primary and high schools the peak in student load appears in 1958 after which time it will level off until a second peak is reached in 1961. This fact would seem to indicate that the standard of compulsory education and the normalization of class load can be ac- complished without additional financial expenditure to take care of the peak years. But the over-crowded classroom situation is another problem. Since it calls for multiplying classes, additional classrooms must be built. And of course there is the need for more teachers. We estimate that 20,000 new 26 GENERAL classrooms and as many new teachers will be required. This requires quite a large sum of m.oney if it is done at once. Thus it seems impossible with the poor resources available to change the overcrowded conditions immediate- ly. Instead it is the present plan to decrease the number of students per class gradually, taking advantage of the gradual decrease in the number of students over the next year or two. This will eliminate the need to spend money not in the present national budget. However this is not a matter of the national budget alone. It is said that the reduction in class load is being hindered in local areas due to a lack of funds. Nineteen prefectures are reported to have rehabilitation organiza- tions receiving help under the law established to help reestablish local finances. In these prefectures a decrease in the number of teachers is being considered deliberately. At present the law has only a vague reference as to the standard number of teachers required in the district and there is no guarantee that a standard number will be re- tained. Strong objection is being raised by groups relat- ed to educational administration which say that unless a standard number of teachers is maintained they will be unable to maintain the standard of compulsory education. But to secure a standard number of teachers there must be additional financial backing. Without money teachers cannot be hired and the national plan will be as inef- fective as the picture of a pudding. Of the salary fund for teachers in local districts, half comes from the na- tional government based on the Compulsory Education National Subsidy Law and the other half comes from the local government. This later half is raised under the Local Transfer Tax System. But as the basis for estimating the amount of the salary fund in the Local Transfer Tax System Law is not clear this often causes difficulty in securing the half of the fund to be furnished by the JAPAN'S EDUCATIONAL CURRICULUM 27 local government. In order to rationalize the procedure, it is necessary to establish a standard number of teachers in local districts. From the above standpoint the Ministry of Education drafted a law \"Concerning the Standard Number of Teachers and of Class Organization in Public Compulsory Education School.\" This law was presented to the 28th ordinary Diet for the purpose of maintaining the raising the standard of compulsory education. Much is expected from the passage of this bill in carrying out this objective, V. The Establishment of Order in Educational Administration It is needless to say that a school has a legal character and should not deviate from its own educational aim in management and administration. School management and its educational administration, therefore, are regulat- ed in many points by national law and by local re- gulations at the same time. This is in order to prevent the school from being disturbed by the interest of some individual or profit organization. In order to manage and administer schools so that children and students may be brought up correctly and healthily, every organization or group or individual must understand the aim of school education well and behave correctly. But in today's Japan this kind of order is apt to be disturbed. As you know, the order of school administra- tion and of schools is the foundation of school education and true education cannot be found where there is not such order. You know how society falls, how a nation collapses, and how households disperse when they lose this order. It is the teaching of history that education is no exception to this rule. As stated before, education in Japan is gradually com- 28 GENERAL ing back to the old normal road through the thorny path after the defeat of the war. But I must say that it is a great misfortune to the Japanese in general that the order of our national education is being disturbed by a special Teachers' Union in almost every case. This Japanese Teachers' Union was formed after World War II and it did many good things concerning the betterment of teachers' Hving standards. But recently this union inter- venes in school administration too much and is making strong opposition to every administrative procedure of the government and of the local authorities in spite of the fact that those authorities have been given the right to establish those procedures. To deny the authority of the responsible organization and say *' power only can decide which is legal or illegal \" is an attitude which can not be permitted in a constitutional state. The Union opposes everything. It opposes the way of promoting science teclinique planned by science specialists ; it fights against the approved system of textbooks ; and is is now fighting the efficiency rating system. The union opposes every measure taken or planned by the govern- ment whose right to take such measures is guaranteed by national law. The union tries to hinder the measures by the united power of the members. It appears that the union tries to destory every attempt in the field of edu- cation which is not within their own ideology. The union tries to get the leadership in educational administration and to take over the management of schools by all means. This effort to try to control all authorized school educa- tion under the leadership of a certain teachers' union is very strange and has no precedent in the history of world education. It is a sad thing for us Japanese that teachers, who are supposed to teach children to obey the law and to keep the order in society, are engaging in activities which lead JAPAN'S EDUCATIONAL CURRICULUM 29 to the negation of the law and to the ignorance of social order. The greatest tragedy in Japan today is that no firm order is found in educational administration and the confusion is always caused by the hand of the Union. The primary object of the Teachers* Union should be to elevate the working standard of teachers, raise salaries and shorten work hours, and as such, it was authori- zed by the law. It has no right to interfer with school administration. Those who are to participate in school administration are principals, education committees and teachers in school activities. The union and members of a union are not to interfere with school administration. The union of this country does not understand this, it seems. We hope earnestly that order will be established in school and that school management will be obtained by a responsible hand taking the school administration and having rejected outside power from any group. Thus, and only thus, can the hope for the bright future of our school education be realized. CHAPTER 3 POLITICS IN JAPAN Tomio Miito The General Election and the Political Climate The House of Representatives was dissolved on April 25, 1958 and the general election took place on May 22. The results are as follow : Parties Votes Percentage Members elected Liberal-Democrat 22,976,830 57.8 287(290) Socialist 13,093,384 32.9 166(158) Communist 1,012,036 2.6 1(2) Minor parties 287,990 0.7 1(0) Independent 2,380,796 6.0 12(2) Total 39,751,636 100.0 476 (Figures in parentheses indicate seats held in the last Diet totalling 467 with 15 vacancies) This list shows that the Liberal-Democrats lost three seats while the Socialists gained eight seats. However, as eleven of those independents joined the former after the election, the Conservative Party has 298 seats. The Social- ists, on the other hand, obtained one new member, so their actual number is 167. The Communists lost one seat while they obtained more than one million votes, which is about 40% more than the Party had in the preceding election held in February 1953. At that time the Communists re- ceived 733,120 votes. Generally speaking, the result of this election shows that more than one-third of the people support the Socialist Party, making it impossible for the Conservative Govern- ment to take initiative in amending the peace Constitution POLITICS IN JAPAN 31 and for lawfully rearming Japan. Also it indicates that the majority of people are for the pro- America policy of the Conservative Government. This is a superficial view of the results of the general election, because voting is not necessarily influenced by the policies each party advocates. Some voters are in- fluenced by their personal relations — kinship or other wise with a candidate ; some by their personal or local interest which a candidate will bring them or has brought them ; some by their mere sympathy for a candidate ; and some by their respect or trust for a candidate, no matter what party he belongs to. What is worse than these cases is that some are bribed to vote for a candidate, and others, being ignorant of what an election is, vote at random. Especial- ly in the case of the Conservative Party, it is the so-called \"Jiban\" (foothold) that tells. A politician, who often visits his electorate, who works hard to solve local and personal problems, who entertains cordially the inhabitants when they come to Tokyo, and who supports financially or politically local bosses, can make a strong \"Jiban\" in his electorate. He does this usually and thus fortifies his foothold so he can win when a general election is held. In such a case a party or a policy has little influence upon the voters. Later his personal connection with the people of his electorate is turned into votes. Most of the votes the Liberal-Democratic Party obtained belong to this category. Therefore the majority of the votes cannot show the majority opinion of the people. In the case of the Socialist Party, more than half of the votes it won are from the labour-organizations of which the General Council of Trade Unions (Sohyo) is most in- fluential. This is why the Socialsit Party is criticized by journalists and political commentators for being too depen- dent upon Sohyo. The opposition to rearmament, to pro- American policy and the support for neutral diplonacy or 32 GENERAL pro -Red-China policy are made manifest by these votes. More than one third of the votes of the SociaUst Party may be from the so-called intelligentia. In 1956, the Right Socialists and Left Socialist were merged into the present Socialist Party. In the election held in 1955, the former obtained 5,129,590 votes while the latter oblained 5,682,987 votes. The Leftists depended upon Sohyo or other labour- organizations while the Rightists were influential among intellectuals, most of their leaders being Christian states- men. Therefore in this election many intellectual people sup- ported the right-wing Socialist politicians. In the votes the Conservative Party and Socialist Party won, there are so-called fluctuating votes. In fact these votes had the function of giving the last touch to the for- mulation of public opinion. Nobody knows exactly the percentage of these votes among the total votes. They can be roughly estimated as 20%. Twenty percent of the voters make honest judgement and use their right accord- ing to the basic principles of democracy, and perform the role of \" casting a vote \" in formulating the climate of opinion. City areas have more fluctuation of votes than rural areas. This is especially true in Tokyo. The list below will explain this fact and show how the citizens of Tokyo are for the Socialist Party and how they are for peace and disarmament : The Percentage of Voters General Election Conservertive Progiessive (Socialist and Communist) 1952 Oct. 56.3% 38.7% 1953 April 56.7% 40.2% 1955 Feb. 55.1% 36.6% 1958 May 46.1% 46.3% 'Liberal-Democrats 12 seats^ .Socialists 15 seats^ POLITICS IN JAPAN 33 The Communist Party put forward 114 candidates in all, with one candidate in almost each electorate. However, they won only one seat in the Diet. This fact shows that the Japanese people do not wish to send Communist poli- ticians to the Lower House. Since they got about one million votes, the Party-members can be estimated at 150 — 200,000. The Communsit organization is very solid. If we mention a political party in the strict sense of the word, the Communist Party may be the sole political party in Japan. This means that the Liberal-Democrat Party is merely an aggregation of politicians and local bosses and has no solid organization among the people at large. The Socialist Party consists of those politicians wire-roped by labour unions and of people whose votes are said to be fluctuating. The real influence of the Communist Party is not made manifest in the general election. However, if there should be such a great international emergency that would shock Japan, its latent force will become active and exercise not a little influence upon the politics of Japan. Christian Statesman Eighteen Christians became members of the Diet through the general election. Twelve of them belonge to the Social- ist Party while six are Liberal-Democrats. New faces are two. It is remarkable that Rev. Kaniichi Nishimura, pastor of the Katada Church in Shiga Prefecture became a Social- ist member of the Lower House. By the way, most So- cialist Christian statesmen are rightists. For instance, Mr. Komakichi Matsuoka (ex-Speaker of the Lower House) , Mr. Tetsu Katayama (ex-Premier), Mr. Motojiro Sugi- yama (ex-Speaker of the Lower House) , Mr. Jotaro Kawa- kami (ex-president of the Right Socialist Party), while Mr. Tamotsu Hasegawa is leftist. Mr. Tokutaro Kitamura 34 GENERAL and and Mr. Junzo Sasamori of the Liberal-Democrat Party are noted Cliristian statesmen. Mr. Jiro Hoshijima, Speaker of the House is also a Christian. Christian statesman are described as being honest and sincere. Whether they belong to the Conservative Party or the Socialist Party, they make the conscience of Japa- nese polities. Can Christian statesmen then be organized into one party called the Japan Christian Party? It is possible. However, without funds earmarked for the use of Christian politics, such a party can hardly be organized. Ideology, principles and policies based on the Christian spirit can easily be established. However, a fund is necessary to start such a movement as organizing a Christian political party. It belongs to the problem of the future, because the number of Christians in Japan is as yet insufficient for supporting a political party. Our vision is that Christian statesmen belonging to a Christian Party gather in a room in the House and offer prayer just before the session is opened. What if we could, while passing by their room, hear hymns sung by these statesmen ! The Difference between the Two Parties The difference between the policies of the both parties was less sharp in this recent election. Both propagandized about social-security. Both laid emphasis on the minimum wage system. The conspicuous difference is in the rearma- ment and in the diplomatic policy toward Red China and America. The Liberal-Democrats did not push forward the reamament policy this time while the Socialists insisted on preserving the Ninth Article of the Constitution which provides that Japan should renounce war and should not rearm. The Socialist Party emphasized that Japan should recognize Red China and thus improve trade relation with POLITICS IN JAPAN 35 her. The Tories supported the existing foreign policy con- cerning America, Red China and Soviet Russia. Two weeks before election day, the Red China Govern- ment cancelled all the treaties and contracts between the Japanese Trade Missions and Red China Government. The reason for cancelling them was that, although a Japanese young man despoiled a Red China flag at Nagasaki a month before, the Japanese Government did not take measures to punish him. This was said to be an insult to Red China. Rumours said that Red China had intended by this act to injure the Liberal-Democrat candidates and hinder their campaign. However, the Tories took advantage of this blow. During the campaign, almost all the candidates of the Liberal- Democrat Party accused Red China of meddl- ing in this way in the internal affairs of Japan. On the other hand the Socialists criticized the Tory Government for its diplomacy toward Red China and its one-sided dependence upon America, thus arousing antipathy toward the Tories among those concerned with Red China trade. The effect on either side seems to have been plus-minus- zero, because the result of the election does not indicate much difference from what was shown in the previous election. Things to Come The most serious problem confronting Japan is its rearmament. She has already been rearmed to some ex- tent. However, the Government did it by ignoring the Ninth Article of the Constitution which prohibits her from being rearmed. The Conservatives say that Japan has been rearmed for the sake of her own defense and that this is not against the provision of the Constitution. However, this is a subterfuge. 36 GENERAL To recognize the illegitimate child — \" Jieitai \" (Self- Defense Force) — as lawful and to bring it up to a strong army, navy and air-force, amendment of the Constitution is an urgent matter. The Liberal-Democrat Party will do their best to set up a smaller constituencies system under which they expect to get througli the next general election more than two-thirds of the seats in the Lower House. By getting more than two-thirds of the seats, they can initiate amendment of the Constitution and put it to a plebiscite. Against this policy, the Socialists will continue their struggle. Thus the smaller constituencies system will be the point at issue before the amendment of the Constitution becomes the subject of debate in the House. The Second Kishi Cabinet The second Kishi Cabinet was formed on June 12, 1958. Its members are representatives of both Japanese capital- ism and breaucracy. The former will excercise influence upon financial and industrial circles and provide political funds for Kishi and his party, while the latter, being ex- officials of the government, will efficiently put the party's policies into practice. This Government will try more ardently than ever to promote friendly relations with the United States and strengthen the one-sided dependence on America. Also it will take more radical steps than ever to suppress the Communists' activity. As there is no specified legislation to prohibit communism, the government will not fail to take advantage of any opportunities whatever to arrest communist leaders, applying the existing laws and ordinances to any cases which can be regarded as criminal, even sometimes distorting the purpose and the meaning of such laws and ordinances. Toward the Socialists, the Tory Government will take two attitudes. POLITICS IN JAPAN 37 Toward the leftists, especially to Sohyo and the Japan Teachers Union (Nikkyoso) the government will become aggressive. It will take measures to attack and oppress them. Toward the rightists, the Government will take a compromising or appeasing attitude. So that there may take place a split among the Socialists. Possibility of the Third Party The formation of the second Kishi Cabinet seems to have stabilized the political situation. However, there still remain symptoms of future confusion. The Liberal Democrat Party, which was formed in 1956, through the amalgama- tion of two parties, consists of various groups or \" Habatsu.\" Each group has its bosses and leaders, with some thirty, forty or fifty followers. The second Kishi Cabinet suc- ceeded to some extent in excluding from the Government those who belong to other groups than Kishi's. Yet the influence of other groups among the Tories cannot be ignored. Though called \" Conservative,\" the Liberal-Demo- crat Party contains those statesmen who think that Japan ought to recognize Red China and enlarge the amount of trade with Communist states. Such politicians are inclined to advocate neutrality policy, while maintaining friendly relation with America. Therefore in time of political con- fusion, there may be some possibility of these people being combined with some of the rightists of the Socialist Party. On the other hand, the Socialist Party has within itself several factors which may cause a future split. Is the Socialist Party a \"class party\" or ''people's party \"? This question is often raised about this Party. The leftists tend to consider it a political party for laboures. The rightists wish it to be a political party for the people. This differ- ence in the way of thinking is the main factor making for its possible division. Many intellectuals, who have voted 38 GENERAL for the Tories, say that if the rightists of the Sociahst Party becomes an independent party, they are wiUing to support it. Such people detest the SociaHsts because they became a puppet of the Sohyo and other leftwing labour unions. There is another factor concerning the split of the Con- servative Party. That is the problem of moralization of politics. Most of the Tories spend not a little money for their political activities, more than three times, no, more than ten times, the salary they get. From where do they get the money? If not through bribery, through some measures akin to bribery, they may get their politi- cal fund. This is the original sin of the Tories, and here is the cause of their trespasses. To cleanse political circles, statesmen are required to be free from bribery or any- thing akin to bribery. This is the voice of many people. The moral elements of the Tories must leave their party if they wish to heed this voice. These three factors — groups among the Tories, the pos- sibility of a split of the Socialists, and the people's demand for moralization of politics, may work together to produce a Third Party, when an emergency takes place concerning serious home affairs or diplomacy. Then what shall Christians do in politics now and in future? Listen to the whisper of the Spirit and act ac- cording to what the Lord bids us do. In any case the authority is in the Bible. II THE CHRISTIAN MOVEMENT CHAPTER 4 CHRISTIAN PUBLICATIONS Norie Akiyama General Outlook Publications in general, with special attention to the Christian enterprise: Japan ranks high among the countries of the world in the number of books and magazines published. In fact, Japan has more publishers, and the amount of printed matter produced is greater, than any other nation in the world. This indicates what ravenous readers the Japanese people are. It also suggests the importance and effectiveness of proclaiming the Gospel through the printed word. In this regard, Japanese Christians are heartened by the fact that Churches abroad have recognized this importance and are supporting literature production as an instrument of evan- gelism. The publishing field in Japan faces some serious problems, however. First there is the fact that publishing houses gen- erally are small and financially unstable. Overproduction is a frequent consequence of this condition. These faults are complicated by an inadequate and unreliable system of distribution and sales. The need to make profits has led to the use of advertiz- ing and mass communications media to promote books without merit, meanwhile suppressing good literature for 40 THE CHRISTIAN MOVEMENT the lack of a promising market. Those who want to pro- duce better literature find the cost of advertizing in the daily press forbiddingly high. For instance, approximately ^% column inches of space on the front page of the Asahi Shimbun costs ¥140,000 ($400 US). Christian publishing firms find themselves plagued by all these problems. They also have some that are uniquely their own. For one thing, their potential reading public, although susceptible of some increase, is much more limited. Readers are few in number and most of them are young and poor (58% are students between the ages of 20-29 ; many of the rest are underpaid ministers). In addition, Christian publishers have lacked aggressiveness in encourag- ing Christian lay people to read their products. Further complications arise in the lack of an established marketing system and the fact that sales never rise high enough to make cost reduction really possible. The postwar period has been one of wild fluctuation in the publishing field. When the Pacific War ended, Japa- nese were given freedom of speech, religion and press. Because of this, people flocked to establish publishing houses. At the same time, every one wanted to know about Christianity, a demand which every new publisher sought to satisfy by publishing articles on the Christian religion. Some of these new publishing firms turned out nothing but Christian material. In 1950 there were 239 Japanese publishing firms that brought out more than one publica- tion dealing with Christianity. In all, 839 separate pieces of such literature were published (see Figure I). At that time, economic conditions took a turn for the worse. Inflation pushed small publishers back against the wall. All publishers were panic-stricken by the chaos among the distributors. Many firms failed. After the peak year of 1950 there followed an abrupt CHRISTIAN PUBLICATIONS 41 decline. This brought forth a period of readjustment and consolidation. Where formerly there had been 3,000 publi- shers, only 1,300 survived. Many Cliristian publishers went out of business. Other firms ceased to produce Christian matter because there was no longer any profit in it. This decline in things Cliristian marks the end of the postwar popularity of the Christian religion. From 1950 on, Christ- ianity became once more the work of the Church and less a cultural phenomenon of the victorious occupation powers. Only the best organized Christian publishing firms survived and they were exceedingly few. If independent Christian publishers one after the other have succumbed to bankruptcy, such is not the case with the publishing departments of the various denominational groups. Subsidized from abroad, they have grown by leaps and bounds (see Figure I). The publications of the denomination or mission board-related firms include several books, but the greater part of their output may be des- cribed as evangelistic pamphlets or sectarian tracts. The distribution of such materials in limited largely to people within each particular denomination. They are not pub- lishers who distribute throughout Japan by means of esta- blished trade outlets. Only 15 publishing houses in Japan issued more than five new Christian books in 1957. Of these, 10 had deno- minational relations, three were secular firms, and only two were independent Christian firms operating without foreign subsidy (Figures II & III). Christian Publications during 1957 According to the publication list issued in 1957 by the Christian Publishers' Association, there were 290 separate pieces of material published during the 12 month period frora October 1956 to September 1957. This includes both 42 THE CHRISTIAN MOVEMENT tracts and pamphlets and indicates an increase of 57 items over the previous year. Figures II and III show that evan- gehstic books, tracts and pamphlets and devotional brochures have been produced in numbers greater than last year. This indicates the increased activity of the mission boards in this sphere. The charts explain the various kinds of publications, but it should be noted that Bibles, hymnals and books in braille are not included.

Although many other centen- nial publishing projects have been undertaken, this is the largest. The new dictionary will come off the presses early in 1960, it is believed. Akira Ebisawa's History of Protestant Christianity in Japan and Michio Takeya's One Hundred Years' Christ- ian Growth in Pictures will appear in the fall of 1958. The Concordance to the Colloquial Bible, which has been four years in preparation, will come out in the spring of 1959. Through special effort the Dictionary of Church Terminology, utilizing English, romanized Japanese, and the ideographs, will be ready for the 14th World Christian Education and Sunday School Convention to be held in Tokyo during the summer of 1958. \" World Christian Books \" in Japanese translation are being produced by the Literature Commission in collabora- tion with the Publishing Department of the United Church of Christ in Japan. Six volumes already have appeared. The Young Boys' and Girls' Bible Story Series of 20 volumes is now on the market. It is a joint production of the Commission and the Shinkyo Shuppan-sha. The NCC Literature Commission has also engaged in the following activities : A. The third annual \" Training School for Writers of Christian Literature \" was held at Karuizawa from August 1-3, 1957. B. The sixth annual \" Christian Short Story Contest \" was held in late 1957. First prize was awarded to Mr. Shunsaku Shiba of Kyoto for liis story entitled, \" Kisaku CHRISTIAN PUBLICATIONS 49 and His Son.\" C. The fifth annual observance of \" Christian Literature Week \" was carried out from October 21 through Novem- ber 10, 1957. Both the Christian Writers' Association and the Christian PubHshers' Association cooperated with the Literature Commission in the promotion of this project. The 1957 theme was, \" Women, Let Your Reading Nourish Your Souls ! \" Public lectures were held in Japan's three largest cities, Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya. Mrs. Yoko Matsuoka and Mr. Teruko Kambe gave public lectures to more than 400 women at the Tokyo YWCA. The Vienna International Grand Prix motion picture, \" With Sis,\" was another feature of the evening's program. The Nagoya and Osaka lectures were given by the Rev. Norimichi Ebizawa and Professor Bunnosuke Sekine. D. The editors of 20 Christian journals met together for the first time in Japanese Christian history on Decem- ber 4, 1957. This epochal gathering took place at the Christian Center in Tokyo under the auspices of the NCC Literature Commission. Trends Within the Christian Publishers' Association The difficulties of publication in Japan already have been made clear. In order to improve these conditions the Christian Publishers' Association has undertaken the follow- ing program : A. To introduce publications widely ; recommend good books ; and to provide people with reading guides. B. To increase the market by strengthening sales meth- ods and by creating consumer interest. C. To cut advertizing costs by establishing a joint sys- tem of advertizement. In order to achieve these goals, the Christian Publishers' Association has launched a new magazine entitled, \"Kobun\" 50 THE CHRISTIAN MOVEMENT (Literature Promotion) . By means of this monthly review- journal, which first appeared in June 1957, readers, book- sellers and publishers have been brought closer together. It even has served to stimulate the publishers themselves to greater industry. For instance, the Publishers' Associa- tion, which has existed for several years, was inspired to hold its first conference during August of 1957 at Karui- zawa. It will be an annual affair from now on. Opportunity to exchange views and experiences with a Cliristian publisher from abroad came in the fall of 1957 when A. F. Melzler of the Mennonite Publishing House in the U. S. visited this country. A major concern of the Publishers was discovery of a means of achieving greater cooperation between denomi- nation or mission-related publishing firms and the inde- pendent publishers. The difficulty arises from the ability of publishers receiving subsidy to be relatively indifferent to the need for profit. Compared to their products, the books produced by independent publishers are bound to appear expensive. To this may be added the problem of the agreed cost-retail price ratio. In Japan at the present time, publishing costs must be figured at from 50-55% of the first edition retail price. Prior to the Pacific War it was only 35-40%. (Mr. Melzler said this ratio is only 30% in the U. S.) Another aspect of this problem arises in regard to dis- tribution. Independent publishers must sell through estab- lished agencies at the agreed price. However, denomina- tional or Board-related publishing firms usually do not retail through regular commercial channels. Rather they sell directly through churches and pastors ; and not infre- quently they discount even their unreasonably low list prices. It seems imperative for the health of Cliiistian publishing firms and their greater effectiveness both in immediate CHRISTIAN PUBLICATIONS 51 and long-range efforts to spread the Gospel to unify the activities and goals of these two groups through mutual understanding and cooperation. The General Prospect The Fourteenth World Convention on Christian Education will be held in Tokyo during the summer of 1958. Follow- ing that convention will be the East Asia Christian Litera- ture Conference. Then the 100th anniversary of Protestant- ism in Japan will be observed in 1959. To take part in these important functions the NCC Literature Commission and the Christian publishing firms have planned many enterprises and preparations already are under way. The field of Christian publication surely has a glorious future ahead. If steadily and wisely strengthened the publishers will be able to contribute much to the growth of the Christian Church, especially during this centenary period CHAPTER 5 CHRISTIAN SOCIAL WORK By Shiro Abe In the past few years, several ministers belonging to the United Church of Christ in Japan have occasionally raised some fundamental questions concerning Christian social work. The questions are as follows: (1) Does social work really function as a helpful medium for Christian evangelism? (2) What is the theological foundation for a church's social work? (3) Why do some social workers who are not directly affiliated with a church call their work *' Christian \" social work? (4) What form is most desirable for a church's social work? There are no conclusive answers from among the leading Christian social workers to these questions, but the young social workers are earnestly seeking for solutions. These questions mentioned above are not only the basic pro- blems of social work, but also are closely concerned with theological concepts. Therefore, it is not so easy for us to find the answers to these questions. Such questions are raised again and again, and the fundamental problems still exist for Christian social work in Japan. The questions, however, are concerned only with the United Church of Christ. In other denominations, these problems seem to have been solved already. For instance, in the cases of the Anglican Episcopal, Lutheran and Bap- tist churches, social work is included in the church system, whereas in the United Church they are not directly con- CHRISTIAN SOCIAL WORK 53 nected with social work. In the case of the United Church financial aid is not often given to social work and most of the social work institutions have been established by direct connection with a church as the result of either the believers' individual efforts or of missionaries' activi- ties. Besides, ministers in charge of social work institu- tions are not officially qualified as administrators like those at Christian schools. Representatives of social work in- stitutions also are not permitted to be delegates to the United Church's General Conference and its district con- ferences. In view of these facts, it is undeniable that the connection of social work institutions with the United Church is much less close than that of the Anglican Epis- copal Church in Japan. However, the reason for discussing the relationship of social work to the church lies in not merely their financial connection nor the problems of church systems. The pro- blem exists rather in what the status of social work should be. In olden days charity work was done voluntarily by either individuals or groups. But today, based upon the concept of the common responsibility of society for solv- ing every social problem, national responsibility for social welfare is being strongly emphasized. In recent years in Japan several laws concerning social welfare have been enacted and the social security system also has gradually been completed. This means that the center of social work has been shifted from a voluntary basis to public respon- sibility. For example, all social work institutions, includ- ing Christian institutions, are being subsidized by the gov- ernment. Therefore, it seems difficult for Christian social workers to know what makes Christian social work characteristic. That is to say, as the connection of social work with the church is lessend and relations with the government become closer, what should the status of Christian social work be? This problem, as an inter deno- 54 THE CHRISTIAN MOVEMENT minational issue, was discussed at various meetings and conferences in 1957. In several discussions made in regard to Christian social work, the following three ways were especially pointed out as possible alternatives for Christian social work : (1) To perforin on auxiliary role for public social work. For example, in the case of lepers the government sup- plies them with a 200,000 yen annual per capita subsidy according to the Social Security System. They are under comparatively fortunate circumstances. Therefore, Mission to Lepers merely assists some leprasariums, which are not under governmental protection, or gives the patients spiritual help. It does not supply the lepers' houses or the patients with any direct financial help. (2) Within the limits of its conditions andfimds, based upon profound Christian love, to take the lead in develop- ing scientific treatment and jnanagement techniques. Today most of the Christian institutions are going in this direc- tion and trying to do their best in supplying patients with the kind of spiritual and intellectual treatment that cannot be performed by public social work. (3) By developing new fields of work which are not reached either by the government or public social work. This is an extremely difficult task for Christian social work with its limited funds. However, among many Christian social workers, there is a rising interest and a will to cooperate in undertaking such experimental tasks. Some people are strongly emphasizing that even financial aid from the churches in America should be used for promoting such experimental work. However, it seems very hard for Christian social work to develop unless the problems are given a theological basis, as discussed by some ministers of the United Church. A correct direction to Christian social work would be sug- gested by an examination of its theological basis and by CHRISTIAN SOCIAL WORK 55 exploring its social scientific aspect in connection with the social practice of the church. Now the movements of Christian social work in 1957 can be seen from several points of view. (1) Regarding the relationship between church and social work, there still remain several problems to be studied theoretically and theologically. Mutual understand- ing and cooperation seems to have increased. The United Church appealed to every church to be interested in and to support social work by setting up a \" Social Work Sunday \" last December. The social committee of the Tokyo District Conference of the United Church holds social work seminars from time to time. In Osaka, church workers and Christian social workers jointly hold retreats sometimes and are strengthening their mutual understand- ing. In the East Shonan Area, namely Miura Peninsula, some twenty churches and social work institutions includ- ing two missionaries have meetings regularly. Ministers visit these institutions. On *' Social Work Sunday \" the pulpits were open to social workers. Thus cooperation is being established. Even some ministers and laymen not affiliated with the United Church also are included in this cooperative group. In this area, a joint meeting will be held soon to awake the member's interest in social work as well as their willingness to support the social work in- stitutions. Japan Church World Service has twice invited many church women to see Christian social work institu- tions in Tokyo. On the basis of mutual respect and under- standing as to their respective missions, the churches and the social work institutions are hand in hand moving to- ward a better cooperative order.
