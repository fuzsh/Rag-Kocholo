Japan is a land of contrasts – of tranquil zen gardens and steaming onsen, teeming crowds and robot restaurants – and it has charmed visitors for centuries because of it. Whatever your dream trip to Japan includes, this DK Eyewitness Travel Guide is the perfect companion.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 1 A stone statue of the Buddha at Eikan-do, Kyoto. 2 Neon lights of Tokyo’s frenetic Akihabara Electronics District. 3 A delicate plate of sushi. 4 Kiyomizu-dera Temple, surrounded by fall foliage.\n\n8\n\n4\n\nFormed of thousands of scattered islands, Japan’s impossibly varied landscape stretches 1,864 miles (3,000 km) from the edge of Siberia in the north to tropical Okinawa in the south. In between, you’ll discover the snow-covered slopes of Hokkaido, majestic Mount Fuji, the otherworldly Arashiyama bamboo grove, and much more besides. This is a land of eternal natural beauty, as well as the yearly flowering and falling of ethereal cherry blossoms. Japanese efficiency is no myth – these islands may be some of the most densely populated on the planet, but the country’s thronging cities really do run like clockwork. Tokyo, the capital, where it sometimes feels that the only constant is change, is a science-fiction movie brought to life, with its cosplaying locals, cat-filled cafés, and psychedelic neon street scenes. To the west,\n\nthe ancient capital of Kyoto – the ying to Tokyo’s yang – with its gilded shrines and graceful geisha, is a heritage wonderland, and – whisper it – a cosmopolitan city. And don’t forget Osaka, where proud locals, a chaotic downtown and vibrant food scene meet under the enormous shadow of the country’s largest castle. Even with its unparalleled rail networks, Japan can still overwhelm with the sheer number of unmissable sites on offer. We’ve broken the country down into easily navigable chapters, with detailed itineraries, expert local knowledge and colourful, comprehensive maps to help you plan the perfect visit. Whether you’re staying for a few days, weeks or longer, this Eyewitness guide will ensure that you see the very best Japan has to offer. Enjoy the book, and enjoy Japan.\n\n9\n\nDISCOVER Reasons to Love Japan\n\nREASONS TO LOVE\n\nJAPAN\n\nAn avant-garde capital that pulsates with quirky cosplayers and raucous karaoke bars, hovering trains that rocket through awe-inspiring countryside, engrossing traditions, and an obsession with etiquette – what’s not to love?\n\n1\n\nFAST TRAINS When Japan launched the shinkansen in 1964, they left the rest of the world in the dust. Silently speeding at 200 mph (320km/h), you’ll feel as if you’re already in the future.\n\n2\n\nSTAYING IN A RYOKAN These guesthouses provide the ultimate Japanese experience. Don a yukata (kimono), indulge in a communal bath and savour a home-cooked meal, washed down with plenty of sake.\n\n3\n\nCELEBRATING OTAKU Once an offensive term for a super fan, more and more people are calling themselves otaku. Explore the world of manga, anime, and cosplay in Tokyo’s Harajuku district (p94).\n\n10\n\n4\n\nRIOTOUS FESTIVALS Don’t let its introvert reputation fool you – Japan hosts some raucous celebrations. Expect loin-cloth-clad revellers, sumo wrestlers, and tantalizing scents drifting from stalls (p70).\n\n5\n\nFANTASTICAL CASTLES From the imposing fortresses of the Warring States Period, such as Kumamoto Castle (p274), to Himeji-jo’s graceful donjon (p224), Japan’s castles seem straight out of a fairy tale.\n\n6\n\nSIPPING SAKE Made from a large-grain rice and koji (yeast), sake gets its rich flavor from its unique fermentation process. Hot in winter, or cold in summer, it’s the perfect thirst quencher (p65).\n\n7\n\nDISCOVER Reasons to Love Japan\n\nHISTORIC KYOTO With 1,600 Buddhist temples and more UNESCO-listed World Heritage Sites than any other city on earth, the majestic city of Kyoto is an absolute must for any culture vulture (p180).\n\n8\n\nCHERRY BLOSSOM SEASON Each spring, as the cherry blossom front sweeps northwards, the Japanese population indulges in one of its all-time favorite pastimes: hanami – picnicking under blooms.\n\n9\n\nZEN GARDENS Some think that the rocks represent islands, while others believe that they symbolize emotional obstacles. Search for your own meaning in these mysterious gardens (p48).\n\n12\n\n10\n\nRELAXING IN AN ONSEN As one of the most active volcanic regions in the world, in Japan, onsen are everywhere you look. Wash away your troubles in one of these bubbling pools (p61).\n\n11\n\nSAVORING SUSHI You’ll find this dish on the menu at swanky Michelin-starred eateries and neighborhood dives. Get your chopsticks at the ready to sample sushi at its most authentic (p140).\n\n12\n\nKARAOKE NIGHTS Everyone from giggling teens to suit-clad businessmen belt out tunes in soundproof booths. Grab your earplugs, have your song at the ready, and enjoy the ultimate singalong.\n\n13\n\nEXPLORE\n\nJAPAN\n\nThis guide divides Japan into nine colorcoded sightseeing areas, as shown on this map.

Becoming familiar with each region will help when planning your trip to this sprawling country.\n\nPAGE 78\n\nDISCOVER Getting to Know Japan\n\nGETTING TO KNOW\n\n16\n\nTOKYO Japan’s capital may be rooted in the past but it is also a vision from the future. Traditional low-slung houses sit beside sleek skyscrapers, and historic Ueno Park is a few streets away from the Akihabara Electronics District. This city really comes alive after dark when serious-faced businessmen and giggling teenagers caterwaul beside each other in karaoke booths, and the glowing lanterns outside cozy, hole-in-the-wall izakaya tempt passersby. On top of this, Tokyo’s restaurants have garnered more Michelin stars than any other city in the world, but there also many cheap eats to sniff out here.\n\nBest for\n\nThat world-famous relentless buzz\n\nHome to Ginza, Ueno Park, and more\n\nExperience\n\nEverything from watching morning sumo wrestling practice to dining at the bizarre Robot Restaurant\n\nBest for\n\nAlthough it is home to the charming cities of Kamakura and Kanazawa, Central Honshu is best known for its breathtaking scenery. This stunning region is home to both Mount Fuji and the sprawling Japanese Alps, making it the perfect destination for those who yearn to explore the great outdoors. Despite being well-connected, parts of Central Honshu are still remote enough to have kept their traditional rural lifestyles, buildings, and festivals, making it seem far away from Tokyo.\n\nHome to\n\nPAGE 180\n\nPAGE 148\n\nCENTRAL HONSHU\n\nGetting lost in nature Yokohama, Kamakura, Mount Fuji and the Fuji Five Lakes, Takayama, Kanazawa\n\nExperience\n\nWatching snow monkeys relax in the hot pools outside of Nagano\n\nKYOTO CITY To truly understand Japan, you must spend time in its old imperial capital, where scores of the country’s famous monuments are preserved within a lively modern city. Kyoto is home to graceful parasol-carrying geisha, beguiling temples and towering bamboo groves. Life here is still largely tied to nature’s rhythms. Kyo-ryori, Kyoto’s celebrated cuisine, for example, makes much of seasonality, and the city’s exquisite gardens go through striking seasonal transitions, from fall’s bright-red maple leaves to spring’s blush-pink cherry blossom. Best for Traditional temples\n\nHome to Nijo Castle, Fushimi Inari shrine\n\nExperience\n\nA tour of the wooden-clad district of Gion\n\n17\n\nPAGE 210\n\nDISCOVER Getting to Know Japan 18\n\nWESTERN HONSHU\n\nBest for\n\nOsaka, western Japan’s largest city, is the cultural counterweight to the economic dominance of Tokyo. With its unique dialect, rough-and-tumble streets, and superlative foodie scene, it’s one of Japan’s unmissable cities. Away from Osaka, Western Honshu has many allures, including heavenly Himeji-jo and thought-provoking Hiroshima, as well as some of the country’s most stunning scenery. The giant Otorii gate of Miyajima, which seems to float above the waves, is a must-see for any visitor, while Yoshino is the best place to walk beneath pink blooms during sakura season.\n\nHome to\n\nCherry blossom Nara, Osaka, Kobe, Himeji-jo, Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, Miyajima Island, and Horyu-ji Temple\n\nExperience\n\nWatching the diving women searching for pearls in the water surrounding the Mikimoto Pearl Island\n\nPAGE 246\n\nSHIKOKU Isolated for centuries, Shikoku still feels like a backwater, and is all the more charming for it. The least explored of the Japanese islands, it offers a glimpse of the country as it used to be. The charming castle town of Matsuyama, with its clattering trams and ancient hot spring, is a great base from which to explore the island, while the more adventurous might attempt to master the famous 745-mile- (1,200-km-) long 88 Temple Pilgrimage. Best for Rural charm\n\nHome to Benesse Art Site Naoshima\n\nExperience\n\nPAGE 260\n\nWalking the historic 88 Temple Pilgrimage, which white-robed pilgrims believe atones for the worst transgressions\n\nKYUSHU\n\nBest for\n\nActive volcanoes, rolling grasslands, bubbling hot springs, and outgoing locals combine to give this island a very different feel to the rest of the archipelago. City-wise, bustling Fukuoka and beautiful Nagasaki are two of Japan’s most cosmopolitan metropolises, showcasing Kyushu’s historic role as Japan’s gateway to the rest of the world. The menu on the island reflects this cultural melting pot: unctuous Hakata ramen or crisp lotus roots satisfy hungry tummies, while shochu, made from sweet potatoes, leaves a fiery taste.\n\nHome to\n\nSteaming onsen Fukuoka, Nagasaki\n\nExperience\n\nA soak in the outdoor hot springs of Sakurajima, an active volcano\n\n19\n\nBest for\n\nMore than 1,242 miles (2,000 km) south of Tokyo lies a tropical paradise. Okinawa’s pristine beaches, spectacular diving, and slower pace of life have made it the local’s favorite holiday destination. Although it could be easy to just flop on the sand here, the islands reward a deeper look. Naha, the main city, is a heady mix of refined civilization and neon glitz. Here, traditional red-tiled Okinawan houses, topped with ceramic shisa lions, stand alongside pulsating karaoke bars. Outside the city, you’ll find poignant war memorials, sacred groves, and brimming craft stores to explore.\n\nHome to\n\nPAGE 294\n\nPAGE 282\n\nDISCOVER Getting to Know Japan\n\nOKINAWA\n\nRest and relaxation Beautiful beaches\n\nExperience\n\nAwamori, the local tipple made by distilling fragrant rice into a powerful liquor\n\nNORTHERN HONSHU This part of Japan’s largest island is steeped in myth and legend. Home to sacred mountains, dense forests, and vibrant folk traditions, Tohoku – as the Japanese call it – is a rugged and remote wonderland. The region overflows with literary connections, most famously to the haiku poet Basho, who chronicled his intrepid journey into the region in The Narrow Road to the Deep North. These days, with easy transport to the capital, this poem no longer holds true, and this tranquil region is as well connected as anywhere else in the country.

Characterized by fertile plains, perfect skiing conditions, and looming volcanoes, this spectacular island sometimes feels like a different world. The gateway to Hokkaido, Hakodate is famed for its bounteous morning market, supplied by the fertile seas that surround the island, while Sapporo – the capital – is best known for the intricate ice sculptures that take over the city during its annual snow festival.\n\nHome to\n\nWinter sports Boundless National Parks\n\nExperience\n\nSnowboarding on the powder-covered pistes of Niseko Ski Resort\n\n21\n\nDISCOVER Japan Itineraries 1\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1 Dinosaur skeletons on display at Intermediatheque. 2 Toji Temple in Kyoto. 3 The elaborate entrance to Ginza Six.\n\n2 22\n\n4 Cosplay participants in Tokyo’s Harajuku District.\n\nA land of dramatic contrasts, Japan rewards visitors who have the luxury of time.

Get off at Showa Dori Street for a spot of Japanese papermaking at Ozu Washi (www.ozuwashi.net), followed by lunch at Mitsukoshi’s huge food hall (p110). Next, walk to the Imperial Palace (p112). If the weather is good, check out the gardens; otherwise, the free Intermediatheque museum will keep you entertained (www.intermediatheque.jp). For dinner, try Edomae – the original Tokyo-style sushi – at Yoshino Sushi Honten (3-8-11 Nihonbashi), followed by a nightcap at the bar at the top of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, overlooking the neon-lit city (www.mandarinoriental.com).\n\nDay 2 Once dismissed as a clubbing hotspot, Roppongi (p90) has fast developed a reputation as a cultural hub. Purchase the ATRo Saving ticket and spend the day exploring the Roppongi Art Triangle; the Mori Art Museum, which specializes in contemporary art, is up first. Pause for lunch at Afuri (afuri.com), famed for its delicately scented ramen, before continuing your whistle-stop art tour at the National Art Center and the Suntory Museum of Art. Stick around Roppongi as the evening draws in; there’s no place better for a night on the town.\n\nDay 3 Today you’ll meet Tokyo’s quirky side. Start on the brash and bustling Takeshita-dori in the Harajuku District (p94); packed with trendy boutiques and vintage stores, it’ll\n\neasily absorb your morning. Indulge your sweet tooth at Marion Crepes for lunch (www.marion-crepes.com), then take the metro to Ikebukuro for more pop culture madness on Otome Road. Be sure to call into K-Books (www.k-books.co.jp) and take tea at Swallowtail, the butler café (www.butlers-cafe.jp).

Copy the locals and power up on some early morning ramen, before hitting the shopping mecca of Ginza (p106). Ginza Six is the district’s largest shopping complex, which even has a Noh theatre in its basement – buy a happy hour ticket before 2:30pm to see part of one of the plays staged here (kanze.net). After browsing the shops for the rest of the afternoon, arrive early (no reservations) at Umegaoka Sushi no Midori Sohonten (www.sushinomidori.co.jp) for a sushi dinner.\n\nDay 5 Board the shinkansen to Kyoto. After arriving in under 2.5 hours at the striking Kyoto Station (p189), make your way to Toji Temple (p188) for an introduction to Kyoto’s religious heritage.

Round off your day sampling different sakes at the Jam Sake Bar (p192).\n\nDay 7 Spend your final morning in Kyoto at the Kitano Tenman-gu Shrine (p198) and the glittering Kinkaku-ji (p199). Enjoy a quick tofu meal at nearby Maboya (9-1 Kinugasa Somoncho) before boarding the train to Osaka (p218). Head into lively Dotonbori in downtown Osaka for dinner and drinks – Tachinomi Nikou (p221) is a top option.\n\nDay 8 Spend the morning exploring Osaka Castle (p218). For lunch, sample marinated eel at Unagi Nishihara (4-12 Kita Shimmachi), 24\n\nthen continue learning about the city’s history at the 6th-century Shitenno-ji (p221). As the sun goes down, leave the past behind and head to the top of the sleek Conrad Osaka – with epic city views, this is the perfect cocktail spot.\n\nDay 9 Start by exploring Osaka’s subterranean National Museum of Art (p219), then make your way to Michelin-starred Kashiwaya (www.relaischateaux.com) for lunch in a traditional tearoom-style setting. Next, head to the distinctive Umeda Sky Building for panoramic views from its Floating Garden Observatory (p220). In the evening, explore the retro charms of the Shinsekai district, famed for its narrow lanes and old school bars.\n\nDay 10 Spend today in Nara (p214), just a onehour train ride from Osaka.

Start by walking up Kitano-zaka to Kitano-cho and touring the Europeanstyle villas. No trip to Kobe would be complete without trying its famed beef, so order it for lunch at Steak House Garaku (2-14-25 Yamamotodori). Spend the afternoon sampling sake at the Ginjo Brewery (p223), then take a sunset walk around the harbor to admire the striking Port Tower and Maritime Museum. Head to the city’s lively Chinatown for dinner.\n\nRise early for a morning exploring Naoshima’s museums, before heading back to Okayama and taking the shinkansen to Hiroshima. Have lunch at Okonomiyaki Nagata-ya (www.nagataya-okonomi.com), then pay your respects at the monuments and museum in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park (p228). Oysters are a Hiroshima staple – try them for dinner at Kakifune Kanawa (www.kanawa.co.jp).\n\nDay 12\n\nDiscover Hiroshima’s forward-thinking attitude at the Hiroshima Museum of Art (www.hiroshima-museum.jp) and Hiroshima Orizuru Tower. After slurping some slippery noodles at Bakudanya (2-12 Shintenchi), fly back to Tokyo. If you have the energy, go bar hopping in Shimokitazawa, or treat yourself to a meal at the renowned Inua (inua.jp).\n\nFrom Kobe take the shinkansen to Okayama (p236), famous for its beautiful Korakuen Garden. The garden is close to Okayama’s castle, as well as the city’s museums, so there’s plenty to fill the morning. After lunch at Shiroshita Cafe (1-1-8 Omotecho), catch a ferry to the Benesse Art Site\n\nDay 14\n\n25\n\nDISCOVER Japan Itineraries 1\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1 Shibuya Crossing, one of the busiest crosswalks in the world. 2 The vermilion Tokyo Tower in Shiba Park. 3 Tuna being prepared at the Toyosu Fish Market\n\n2 26\n\n4 Shoppers at one of the stalls that line the street up to Senso-ji Temple.\n\n5 DAYS in Tokyo Day 1 Head straight to the Shibuya Crossing (p93) to catch a glimpse of one of the city’s most iconic sights.

Round off your day with a meal of fusion cuisine at Bassin (1-9-63 Daimyo).\n\nDay 2 Pick up your rental car and make the two­ hour drive to Beppu (p271). Plan to arrive in time for lunch – the toriten (chicken tempura) at Tokyoken (www.toyoken-beppu. co.jp) is an excellent option. In the after­ noon, check out one of Beppu’s hot spring resorts; Myoban Hot Spring, perched high above the city, is a nicely secluded option.

Walk across the river to view Kumamoto’s striking black castle, before making the short drive to Suizenji, a superlative garden that re-creates sites from elsewhere in Japan. If you’re feeling adventurous, try the local basashi (horse meat sashimi) at Iroha (p277) for dinner. Don’t worry if it’s not for you – there are plenty of other dishes to choose from.\n\nDay 5 The mist-shrouded islands of Amakusa, less than a two-hour drive away from Kumamoto, were once home to Kyushu’s hidden Christian communities, who were driven out of the Shimabara Peninsula (p275). Learn more about this persecution at the Christian Museum in Amakusa City (19-52 Fumenoomachi), before lunch at Yakko Sushi (76-2 Higashimachi). It’s a 2.5hour drive to Nagasaki (p266) through epic scenery, including a car ferry trip across the Hayasakiseto Strait. Once you’ve settled into your hotel, walk to Kagetsu (p267) for a fusion meal.\n\nDay 6 Spend the morning exploring Dejima in Nagasaki harbour to learn about the Dutch, Portuguese and Chinese influences on the city.

Walk it off on a stroll to the Hakata Machiya Folk Museum, where you can watch a hypnotizing display of silk weaving. In the evening, go yatai-hopping on Nakasu Island again, resisting the temptation to go to the same stall as before. 35\n\nDISCOVER Japan Your Way\n\nPalatial Pads Over the centuries, the imperial family’s patronage led to the construction of impressive buildings across the country. Perhaps the most famous example is the Katsura Imperial Villa (p203), which was originally built as a princely estate in the early 17th century. This elegant mansion has shaped what is commonly understood to be traditional Japanese architecture, but was also hailed as the ideal modernist prototype by Bruno Taut, the German architectural theorist, in 1937. Book a tour of the villa and other sights, including the Kyoto Imperial Palace (p195) and Shugaku-in Imperial Villa (p204), through the Imperial Household Agency (sankan.kunaicho.go.jp).\n\nElegant 19th-century Kyoto Imperial Palace, the former ruling palace of the emperor\n\nJAPAN FOR\n\nARCHITECTURE\n\nArchitecture is one of the most influential expressions of Japan’s culture and creativity. Whether it’s the elegant minimalism of the Ise Shrine, or the utopian optimism of the 20th-century Metabolist movement, the country’s buildings encompass its multifaceted personality. Modern Mountains Roppongi is home to one of Japan’s modern marvels of engineering – the Mori Tower. This cutting-edge skyscraper mitigates the risks posed by earthquakes with 192 fluid-filled shock absorbers. These semiactive dampers are filled with a thick oil and, as the tower begins to sway – as a result of tremor or high winds – the oil sloshes in the opposite direction to balance the structure. Another modern wonder in the capital is the Tokyo Skytree. Completed in 2012, and designed to evoke a traditional pavilion, this tower stretches 2,080 ft (634 m) above Tokyo. This latter-day pagoda is ostensibly a TV broadcasting tower, but also has restaurants and observation decks that offer tremendous views of the city’s incredible skyline.\n\nThe Tokyo Skytree piercing the clouds high above the city’s inimitable skyline\n\nWHAT WAS METABOLISM?\n\nThe undulating exterior of Tokyo’s cutting-edge Yogogi National Gymnasium\n\nPostwar Parks Built for the 1964 Toyko Olympics, the Yoyogi National Gymnasium in Yoyogi Park (p96) fused tradition with cuttingedge design, and symbolized the country’s rebirth after the devastation of World War II. The architect Kenzo Tange also designed the Peace Memorial Museum in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park (p228). Along with the nearby A-Bomb Dome, it is an affecting memorial and symbol of peace. Join a communityled architectural walk of Hiroshima to understand how the city has reconciled with its tragic past (oa-hiroshima.org).\n\nPostwar reconstruction efforts in Japan’s cities spawned new ideas about the future of urban planning and design. One of the most important of these was Metabolism. This movement came about during preparation for the 1960 Tokyo World Design Conference, embraced the idea of modern cities in flux – constantly changing and adapting to meet the needs of their residents. This called for modular megastructures that could grow and shrink according to necessity. Although frustrated in their desire to build Tokyo anew, Metabolist devotees, such as Kenzo Tange and Kisho Kurokawa, exerted a major influence on the country’s architecture. Check out Kurokawa’s Nakagin Capsule Tower in Ginza (p106).\n\nSacred Structures Shrines and temples are some of the most distinctive buildings in Japan. Common features to look out for include vermilion torii gates, troughs for ritual washing, and shimenawa, the straw rope with white zigzag paper strips that marks the boundary between the everyday and spirit worlds. The Tosho-gu shrine (p300) in Nikko symbolizes the power of the Tokugawa shogunate. Take a two-week tour to hear an expert unpack Japanese religious architecture (www. architecturaladventures.org).\n\nThe five-story pagoda at the entrance to Nikko ‘s Tosho-gu Shrine\n\n37\n\nDISCOVER Japan Your Way\n\nJAPAN\n\nIN THE WINTER\n\nWhile Japan is most often associated with its springtime cherry blossoms, winter is also a superlative time to visit.

Red-faced macaques soak in the hot pools at the Jigokudani Monkey Park (p174).\n\nHit the Slopes Blessed with a mountainous landscape and some of the heaviest snowfall in the world, is it any wonder that Japan boasts some 600 ski resorts? Although the mountains might not compare to the scale of the Alps or the Rockies, the region of Hokkaido compensates by offering the most reliable ski season in the world, with certain resorts averaging 60 ft (18 m) of snowfall annually.

TOP\n\n5\n\nESSENTIAL JAPANESE FILMS\n\nLate Spring (1949) Looks at the relationship between a widowed father and his daughter. Rashomon (1950) Different characters give conflicting versions of events in this thriller. Tampopo (1985) A “ramen” version of a spaghetti Western. Spirited Away (2000) The tale of a little girl who is magicked into the spirit world. Our Little Sister (2015) Three sisters invite their younger half­ sister to live with them.\n\n46\n\nBe Spirited Away For many, the quintessential Japanese filmmaker is Hayao Miyazaki, cofounder of Studio Ghibli. Step into the animator’s imagination at Tokyo’s Ghibli Museum (p143), with its recreated sets, original sketches, and showreels of his films. For full immersion, why not visit one of the real­life spots that inspired Miyazaki’s fantastical worlds? The bathhouse in Spirited Away is said to be modeled on Dogo Onsen Honkan in Matsuyama (p256).\n\nWindows into the Past Written in the early 11th century by Murasaki Shikibu, a lady-in-waiting at the imperial court, The Tale of Genji is thought to be the oldest work of fiction in the world. Visit the room where Shikibu began to write this historic romance on a moonlit night in 1004 at the Ishiyamadera temple in Otsu, near Kyoto. Japan is also home to another ancient art form – the haiku. Learn more about these concise poems at Tokyo’s Basho Memorial Museum (1-6-3 Tokiwa), dedicated to the masterful Matsuo Basho. You can also recreate his long-form poem The Narrow Road to the Deep North by climbing up Mount Haguro (p308). As you walk the forest path, surrounded by towering trees, it is easy to see how Basho was inspired to write his meditative verses. And at the end of your trip, why not summarize your trip in your own haiku?\n\nIllustration depicting Lady Murasaki writing the Tale of Genji\n\nA still from Hayao Miyazaki’s Oscar-winning animated movie Spirited Away\n\nThrough International Eyes\n\nExploring the wonderful Ghibli Museum in Tokyo\n\nFor many people, Lost in Translation (2003) perfectly renders the realities of being a foreigner in Tokyo. Visit the New York Bar at the top of the Park Hyatt Tokyo (p89) to recreate the most iconic moments from Sofia Coppola’s film. Wes Anderson fans, meanwhile, should take a boat trip to Gunkanjima from Nagasaki (www. yamasa-kaiun.net/en).

You can easily imagine the Buddha meditating on an island in one of the gardens’ lotus ponds. Byodo-in in Uji City (p240) is one of the most famous examples, while the Motsu-ji garden in Hiraizumi (p306) makes use of “borrowed landscape” – trees or mountains outside the garden that appear to be part of it.\n\nIKEBANA The practice of using flowers as temple offerings originated in the 7th century, but formalized flower arranging, or ikebana, didn’t take hold until the late 15th century. Nowadays, it is seen as a meditative art. Arrangements are supposed to be created in silence, to allow the designer to observe the beauty of nature and gain inner peace.\n\nThe Phoenix Hall and lotus pond in Byodo-in garden in Uji City\n\nJAPAN’S\n\nGARDENS\n\nReflecting the Shinto love of nature and the Buddhist ideal of paradise, Japan’s gardens may seem like heaven on earth. From strolling in Westernstyle parks to meditating among curious rock formations in a zen garden, there are plenty of ways to appreciate these outdoor spaces. Zen Gardens Looking to be more mindful? Seek out a karesansui (Japanese rock garden) and focus on one of the stones, seemingly floating in a sea of raked gravel. Kyoto is home to some of the best examples, including Ryoan-ji (p200) – where the plain earthen walls enhance the abstract arrangement of the stones – and Daisen-in (p198). Kyoto Garden Experience (www. kyotogardenexperience.com) offers private tours and the chance to access gardens usually barred to the public.\n\nVisitors soaking up the peaceful atmosphere at Ryoan-ji in Kyoto\n\n48\n\nTOP\n\n3\n\nGARDENS IN JAPAN\n\nKenroku-en One of Japan’s “three great gardens,” this expansive park is equally breathtaking in every season (p165). Kairaku-en Located in Mito, the second of the “three great gardens” is at its most spectacular when its 3,000 plum trees blossom in February and March. Koraku-en The last of the “three great gardens,” this picturesque stroll garden in Okayama is unusual for its spacious lawns (p236).\n\nStroll Gardens The landscape comes to life on a walk through one of Japan’s stroll gardens, as vistas are concealed and revealed with every step. Suizen-ji Jou-en (p274) is one of the country’s finest, while the garden of the Katsura Imperial Villa (p203) replicates famous Japanese landscapes. Tokyo’s Rikugi-en Garden (p144) was inspired by famous poems.\n\nThe undulating landscape of the Suizen-ji Jou-en garden in Kumamoto\n\nTea Gardens To reach a teahouse for the tea ceremony, you must first pass through a roji. Lined with sweet-smelling moss, this garden is designed to resemble a mountain trail, leading from reality into the magical world of the teahouse. Head to the Kenroku-en The secluded Garden (p165) or the Ise surrounds of Shrine (p244) to take part a teahouse in this unique ritual.\n\n49\n\nDISCOVER Japan Your Way\n\nHorse Around Perfected in the 12th-century yabusame (horseback archery) involves an archer galloping down a 837-ft- (255-m-) long track, controlling his horse with his knees, while shooting an arrow at three targets.

The samurai – ruled by elaborate codes of honor – looked down on the ninja, who specialized in espionage, sabotage, and guerilla warfare. Experience the world of these dark assassins for yourself at the Koka Ninja Village, where the brave are put through their paces in a ninja training class (p233). Afterwards, watch the experts at work at the Iga Ninja Museum (p235).

Alas, this castle wasn’t as impenetrable as hoped: it was ravaged during the 1877 Satsuma Rebellion. Currently undergoing reconstruction due to damage sustained during the 2016 earthquake, this fortress can still be viewed from the outside.\n\nThe Last Samurai As warfare changed, the samurai transformed from mounted archers to master swordsmen, and finally to desk-bound bureaucrats.

When centuries of isolationism ended in the 19th century, the country embraced new technologies, and today Japan is a world leader in everything from fashion to robotics. The Emergence of Japan Japan’s first inhabitants arrived over 40,000 years ago, possibly via land bridges from the Asian continent. The Jomon hunting and gathering society emerged around 14,500 BC, and from 300 BC to AD 300 the Yayoi people spread from Kyushu to Honshu and Shikoku. In the west of Japan, between 538 and 710, a local clan – the forebears of today’s imperial family – began to con­ solidate its power. It was during this period that Buddhism and Chinese writing arrived in the islands, and a system of laws based upon Confucianism and Chinese legal standards were established.\n\n1 A map showing the prefectures of Japan. 2 Yayoi period dwellings in Yoshinogari Park. 3 Murasaki Shikibu, author of the Tale of Genji. 4 An illustration of the Mongol invasion in 1281.\n\nTimeline of events 794\n\n300 BC– AD 300\n\nHeian-kyo (Kyoto) becomes the capital, which it remains until 1868.\n\nMethods of farming, metalwork, and pottery reach Japan from the continent.\n\n239 Queen Himiko sends an envoy to the Wei kingdom in China.\n\n72\n\n710 Heijo-kyo (Nara) is made capital the capital of Japan.\n\n823 Kukai, an advocate of Shingon Buddhism, is made head of Toji temple.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFrom Nara to Heian Beginning with the establishment of an imperial capital in 710, the Nara Period saw spectacular literary, artistic, architectural and religious advances. The era ended with the relocation of the capital to Heian-kyo (Kyoto) in 794. There, Chinese influences blended with native Japanese elements in painting, calligraphy, poetry and prose. After the collapse of the Chinese Tang dynasty in 907, Japan began to distance itself from its neighbor and developed a culture that was more distinctly Japanese. Kamakura Period In 1185, the elegant world of the Heian court was shattered by the struggle between the Taira and Minamoto warrior clans. The result was the establishment of Japan’s first shogunate – rule by warriors – and power shifted from the imperial court to Kamakura, near modern Tokyo. The Mongols launched two invasion attempts in 1274 and 1281, both of which were halted by the weather, leading the Japanese to coin the term “kamikaze” – divine wind. In 1333, the Kamakura shogunate collapsed after the emperor Go-Daigo attempted to reassert imperial control.\n\nc 1000\n\n1274\n\nTale of Genji – possibly the world’s oldest novel – is written by court lady Murasaki Shikibu.\n\nThe first Mongol invasion attempt lands in Kyushu.\n\n1087 Emperor Shirakawa abdicates and becomes first cloistered emperor.\n\nPERIODS OVERVIEW Jomon 14,500–300 BC Yayoi 300 BC–AD 300 Yamato 300–710 Hakuho 645–710 Nara 710–794 Heian 794–1185 Kamakura 1185–1333 Muromachi 1333–1568 Momoyama 1568–1600 Tokugawa (Edo) 1600–1868 Meiji 1868–1912 Taisho 1912–1926 Showa 1926–1989 Heisei 1989–present\n\n1333 The Kamakura shogunate collapses.\n\n1180–85 Minamoto clan defeats the Taira and establishes Kamakura shogunate.\n\n73\n\nDISCOVER A Brief History\n\n1\n\n3\n\n2\n\nWarring States Period After years of civil war, the Muromachi shogunate emerged victorious in 1336. Whereas Kamakura had existed in equilibrium with the imperial court, the Muromachi took over the remnants of the imperial government. Rebellions followed and, in 1467, the Ōnin War broke out, leaving Kyoto devastated and effec­ tively ending the national authority of the shogunate. For the next century, Japan was racked by debilitating warfare between increasingly autonomous samurai sections. Oda Nobunaga – a daimyo (feudal lord) who rose through military ranks in the provinces – set out to unify the nation, but died unsuccessful in 1582. Nobunaga’s deputy, a former peasant named Toyotomi Hideyoshi, continued the work of unification. To achieve this, he set about destroying as many of the country’s castles and forts as he could and confiscating weapons belonging to farmers. After Hideyoshi died, daimyo from eastern and western Japan fell into dispute and sent their samurai, led by Tokugawa Ieyasu and Ishida Mitsunari respectively, to battle in Sekigahara. Ieyasu emerged victorious in 1600 and subsequently founded the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603.\n\n1 General and statesman Oda Nobunaha. 2 Statue of Toyotomi Hideyoshi outside Osaka. 3 The landing of Commodore Perry. 4 The Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923.\n\nDid You Know?

While Kyoto remained the official capital, Edo greatly eclipsed it in size. Japan isolated itself from the rest of the world until 1853, when the American Naval officer Commodore Perry challenged Japan’s refusal to enter into international relations. Weakened by internal unrest, the shogunate could only accede to Perry’s demands. Imperial power was restored in 1868, and Japan sw"
