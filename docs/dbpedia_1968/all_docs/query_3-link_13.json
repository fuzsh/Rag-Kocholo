        "text": "Meals included: Breakfast, Lunch\n\nThis morning over Breakfast at 7:30 am, for anyone interested, Dean Suttmeier will hold an informal discussion about “The Sumo diet”.\n\nAfterward, our group will depart the hotel and walk to the subway station and take the Asakusa line to Asakusa station.\n\nUpon arrival begin walking along Nakamise-dori Street to the very heart of Asakusa, Senso-ji Temple, Tokyo’s oldest temple. The street runs for 250 meters on the main approach to Sensoji Temple and is lined on both sides with shops selling traditional souvenirs, snacks, and sweets. This street is actually on temple property and so it starts and ends with a temple gate: at the southern end is the outer gate of Kaminarimon, and at the northern end is the inner gate of Hozomon. Asakusa’s Nakamise shopping street is believed to have got its start sometime between the late 17th and early 18th centuries when local people in Asakusa were granted permission to open shops on the temple grounds. Already, at that time, Sensoji Temple was a popular center of pilgrimage, and so the shopkeepers of Nakamise could do a great trade providing food and drink to weary pilgrims!\n\nAs you get close to the Hozomon gate and Senso-ji Temple, admire the unusual decorations: a pair of ōwaraji, or giant straw sandals that measure 4.5 meters (14.5 feet) tall and weigh 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds). The sandals are a larger version of a type of sandal made from straw ropes. Ōwaraji were common footwear in Japan until the 19th century. Senso-ji Temple’s giant ōwaraji were woven in the traditional way and made by the town council of Tate’oka-aramachi, Murayama in Yamagata Prefecture. It is said that the sandals represent the powers of Niō, the Herculean guardians of Buddhist temples. Their presence keeps demons at bay by making them believe that the temple is home to an invincible giant.\n\nExplore the temple before walking a few minutes to lunch at the Cha Shitsu Ryokan for a traditional Japanese lunch.\n\nAfter lunch walk a few minutes to Taro’s Origami studio. It is believed that paper was first made, and folded, in China in the first or second century. The earliest records of origami in Japan date to the Heian Period (794-1185). It was during this period that Japan’s nobility had its golden age, and it was a time of great artistic and cultural advances. Paper was still a rare enough commodity that origami was a pastime for the elite. Paper was folded into set shapes for ceremonial occasions such as weddings. Serrated strips of white paper were used to mark sacred objects, a custom which can still be seen in every shrine to this day. It was in the Edo Period (1600-1868) that much of today’s popular traditional culture developed as forms of entertainment for the merchant classes and the common people.\n\nMeeting the group will be David Koichiro Silvert, who was born in Japan, grew up in California and recently returned to Tokyo to live. The workshop will be about 45 minutes long and will include a brief introduction to the studio, its history, general origami knowledge, and an origami demonstration.\n\nWalk about 10 minutes to the Asakusa pier and board a boat for a relaxing ride (40 minutes) along the Sumida River with an opportunity to admire Tokyo’s sleek skyline while passing under more than 10 bridges.\n\nDisembark the boat at the Hama Rikyu gardens, a tranquil oasis in the heart of Tokyo. Walk through these scenic gardens which were once reserved for Imperial use and were only opened to the public in 1946. The gardens were built in the 17th century for the Tokugawa family, who hunted ducks on the garden’s tidal pools. Today Hama Rikyu is a beautiful public park and a refuge for ducks, herons and migrating birds. Explore the garden and discover moon-viewing pavilions, ancient pine trees clipped into dramatic shapes, and an island tea house.\n\nEnjoy a cup of matcha tea and a traditional Japanese sweet before walking to a small kimono shop run by Ms. Mie Chitani, who was born into the Chitani family. The family has been running a kimono and Japanese accessory store in Ginza since the first year of the Meiji era. Mie Chitani will meet the group and talk about her design work. Ms. Chitani graduated from Western Michigan State University in 1989, returned to Tokyo and joined Citibank. At that time, women were not allowed to be heirs, so Ms. Chitani’s parents were thinking of closing the store, but Ms. Chitani took over and then opened her own store focused more on a young people’s business model. Ms. Chitani is also very open to answering questions the group has about Japanese culture.\n\nDean Suttmeier will have a discussion with the group and present on “The History of Sushi” to set the stage for all sorts of eating!\n\nOn our return to the hotel we will stop by a major “Depato” (department store) to look about, and head to the lower level to see the activity that erupts just before dinnertime. If you haven’t made your first purchase in Tokyo, you certainly will — your chance to taste all sorts of snacks or perhaps pick-up even more samples for a full dinner.\n\nYou have free-time this evening.\n\nBut, after a little rest and relaxation, you can join Bruce for a “night out”, and “underground” as Bruce guides anyone willing on a late-night food and drink adventure.\n\nAccommodations: Dai-Ichi Hotel Tokyo or similar (4 Nights)\n\nMeals included: Breakfast, Lunch\n\nNow that you are adjusted to the time zone…\n\nFor anyone interested, Dean Suttmeier and Andrew will meet folks in the lobby at 5:30 am for an excursion to the Toyosu fish market. We will take taxis (12 minutes) there and back, look around at the fish coming in from the docks, and then have sushi for breakfast.\n\nLater in the morning, our whole group will use public transportation to travel to the Meiji-jingū Shrine, one of Tokyo’s most important shrines. The Meiji-jingū covers 175 acres and houses over 100,000 trees – making it a lush escape from the hard angles of the city. The shrine itself is austere and built in cypress and copper in the nagare-zukuri style, often busy with worshippers. The inner garden pre-dates the shrine itself and is said to have been designed by the Meiji Emperor for his wife. It is a tranquil spot and boasts a pond with large colorful koi and an interesting well.\n\nClose by is the Nezu Museum. Cloistered in the back streets of Aoyama, the museum houses the private collection of Kaichiro Nezu and consists of magnificent examples of Japanese painting, calligraphy and ceramics, some of which are registered National Treasures including the famous Shinto paintings ‘Nachi Waterfall’ and ‘Mandala with 81 Deities’. There will be time to explore both the museum and its gardens. The garden surrounding the museum, which is among one of Tokyo’s finest, consists of wonderfully arranged ponds, waterfalls, flowering trees and seven exquisite tea pavilions.\n\nTravel to Shibuya Crossing by public transportation for lunch.\n\nAfter lunch meet with Roland Kelts is a Tokyo-based writer, journalist, scholar and authority on Japanese and Western cultures. His first book, Japanamerica, is the ultimate guide to Japan’s pop culture juggernaut — required reading for many Hollywood producers, global artists and academics worldwide.\n\nHe is a primary Japan source for The New Yorker, The Guardian, The New York Times, CNN, the BBC and NHK, among others. He is also a columnist for The Japan Times and a professor at Japan’s prestigious Waseda University. He has given speeches on Japan for think tanks, embassies, universities, pop culture conventions and private events in the US, Europe and Asia.Kelts has taught at The University of Tokyo, New York University, Columbia University, Sophia University, and Harvard University. He has won several awards and fellowships, and he was a Nieman Fellow in Journalism at Harvard University in 2017.\n\nAfter lunch walk to Shibuya Crossing. The frenetic and scrambling center of modern Japanese culture\n\nShibuya’s iconic crossing continue to feature on the pages of global fashion and travel magazines, and for good reason. The chaotic, yet miraculously organized crossing has become a symbol of Tokyo’s dynamism and represents Shibuya—Japan’s trend-setting powerhouse dedicated to fashion and arts. Join the crowds as they diverge off into the many streets and alleyways to shop and hangout in hip cafes, bars, and restaurants. Spend time appreciating the area’s fiercely independent art scene, or simply visit to experience the rapid-beating heart of Tokyo.\n\nBefore an evening at leisure meet with Motoyuki Shibata, professor emeritus from the University of Tokyo. He’s Japan’s leading translator of American literature (Roth, Paley, Rebecca Brown, Pynchon, etc.) and a scholar of American culture. Shibata sensei can talk about Japan’s postwar Left and the bohemian coffee-house culture based on the Beats, Japanese folks music and how Japan’s perception of the US has changed over the years. Fascinating and brilliant speaker.\n\nDinner tonight is on your own. Head out on your own food exploration — Bruce and Andrew will certainly have some suggestions. For those who want to splurge you might want to try Japan’s fine dining scene (advanced reservations reccomended). Tokyo is the city with the most Michelin star restaurants in the world and it’s held that spot since 2007 with over 200 restaurants in the Michelin Guide\n\nAccommodations: or similar (4 Nights)\n\nMeals included: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner\n\nThis morning meet with Lully Miura, Ms. Miura is a political scientist who helps policy makers, media, and the public to understand the world and make it a better place. She founded and is president of Yamaneko Research Institute, Inc., an independent thinktank dedicated to the most pressing issues for Japan and the world.

Her first autobiography, The Meaning of Loneliness, the Taste of Life as a Woman, Shincho-sha 2019 touches on the difficulties facing modern women. The book has become a bestseller having covered sensitive topics such as sexual violence, raising a daughter, and losing a baby…\n\nAt midday take a bullet train to Kanazawa bringing lunch with us.\n\nThis incredible train is an amazing experience in itself –travelling so smoothly at such a speed. Incredibly, despite Japan’s huge population and the small size of the country, nearly two thirds of the land is still forested. Surprisingly, the extreme landscape did not deter construction of the Shinkansen line for the 1964 Olympics. It was carefully engineered to use the most direct routes, tunneled through mountains and on tracks over suburban areas, and in many cases is faster than flying between major cities.\n\nLocated between the Sea of Japan/East Sea and the Japanese Alps in western Japan, Kanazawa was spared from destruction during World War II and remains one of the best-preserved castle towns of the Edo Period. It is considered one of the country’s best places to learn about samurai’s history and lifestyle. In the past, the feudal lords invited skilled artisans from Kyoto and Edo (currently Tokyo) to introduce craft techniques that combined dynamism with the elegance of the samurai culture. The refined samurai of Kanazawa were an anomaly, made possible by their ruler’s disinterest in violence and an affection for the arts. This combination is what makes Kanazawa’s crafts unique. Although Samurai were abolished in the late-19th century much of their world remains in Kanazawa.\n\nArrive at the Kanazawa Station which was re-opened in 2005. The station’s wooden hand-drum-shaped Tsuzumi Gate and glass umbrella-shaped Motenashi Dome were controversial because they clashed with the traditional architecture of this old castle town but the station’s beauty in its sleek modern design is appreciated by those that see it.\n\nOur hotel, Hotel Nikko Kanazawa, is located just a few minutes by foot from the train station.\n\nIn the late afternoon explore the neighborhood of Higashi Chaya – miles away from the more modern city of Kanazawa. Walk through a labyrinth of teahouses, temples, beautiful, latticed buildings and restored samurai houses. Admire the roofs of the stately wood buildings with detailed carvings sprouting from clusters of gingko and maple trees. Kanazawa’s streets were partly designed to mislead and disorient outsiders.\n\nWe will gather for Dinner in the old town.\n\nAccommodation: Hotel Nikko Kanazawa or similar (2 Nights)\n\nMeals included: Breakfast\n\nBefore heading out, Dean Suttmeier will present about the “Organic Food Movement in Japan”.\n\nThis morning we will head south of Kanazawa into the Ryohaku mountains which are formidable if not especially high. Shirakawa-go and Gokayama are two scenic and secluded mountain village areas famous for their traditional architecture and are designated UNESCO World Heritage sites. The villages are connected by the Shokawa River but are within the bounds of two different prefectures: Gifu and Toyama.\n\nThe villages are famed for their magnificent A-frame farmhouses, built in a style called gassho-zukuri, or “hands in prayer.” Extended families of 30 or more members lived on the lower floors, while the upper floors were used to raise silkworms, which, especially in the Meiji era, provided the raw silk that fed Japan’s booming textile mills. The gassho-zukuri design proved exceptionally suitable for this; during different phases in their growth, silkworms require varying amounts of heat and light, which could be achieved by moving them from one floor to another.\n\nBuilding these houses was a major community endeavor. Professional carpenters were hired to make the ground floors, over which villagers would raise the roof. It took dozens of people several days just to tie down the thick layer of thatch. The magnificent dwellings standing today, however, do not give an accurate picture of the life of the average farmer. Most peasants lived in small, mean structures resembling a tent of thatch, such as one that is now used as a tool shed in Ainokura. Even residents of the large houses—village heads, their extended families and servants— found their quarters cramped.\n\nThis morning enjoy a walk through Gokayama village with its traditional family dwellings some of which are thought to be over 400 years old and with their high hedges and gardens give an idyllic picture of a prosperous farmer. The river, which marks the border between Shirikawa and Gokayama prefectures, twists and turns dramatically—at one stretch the road between the towns crosses the river seven times in quick succession. It is easy to understand why in former times, Gokayama and Shirakawa-go, seemingly so similar, were in fact worlds apart. At many of the large houses, formerly the homes of local headmen, there are cauldrons and implements used to make gunpowder in the Edo period. One of the finest gassho-zukuri houses is that of the chief of gunpowder production. The house is uncommonly elegant inside because it also served as lodgings for visiting domain officials\n\nMeet with the owners of a long-established tofu specialty shop has been making traditional Gokayama-dofu since the Taisho period (1912-1926). They carefully make their tofu by hand with underground water from the nearby mountains and a local Tonami soybean variety called “Enrei. We will visit their workshop, and learn the tofu making process and, for those who want. Make a tofu ice cream sandwich!\n\nWe have arranged a traditional lunch in a gassho-zukuri house\n\nWorking with Gokayama’s Organization for the Preservation of Folk Songs and Dances we have arranged a private Mugiya folk song and dance performance that originated in Gokayama.\n\nAfter exploring the two towns return to Kanazawa to explore the Nagamachi district. This was a samurai district located at the foot of the former Kanazawa Castle, where samurai and their families used to reside. The area preserves a historic atmosphere with its remaining residences, earthen walls, private entrance gates, narrow lanes, and water canals.\n\nVisit the Nomura Family Samurai House which once belonged to the Nomuras, a wealthy samurai family. The Nomura family had the job of providing security on horseback for the lord. During the time, this job was considered a high ranking one. Although many of the samurai houses were destroyed after feudal Japan came to an end in the late 1800s, the Nomura Family Samurai house fell under the hands of a rich businessman and, although altered, was preserved. The Japanese garden on the premise is acclaimed for its refined ambience. The engineering of the garden is done in a typical Edo style. The ponds use water drawn from a canal and created to have a difference in levels to add more depth to the overall look of the garden. Everything, from the trees to the bridges to the way the water flows, is done under much thought and calculation. The bayberry tree is 400 years old and designated as a tree for special preservation by the city of Kanazawa.\n\nThe rest of the day is at leisure, with Dinner on your own,\n\nAccommodation: Hotel Nikko Kanazawa or similar (2 Nights)\n\nMeals included: Breakfast, Lunch\n\nThis morning meet with staff at the Kyoto-based NGO, Kiko (Climate) Network. We have requested a meeting with Mr. Kenro Taura, executive director. Kiko Network is a non-governmental, nonprofit organization in Japan that focuses on putting together policy proposals for climate change prevention at the community level and beyond, disseminating information, and engaging in environmental education and training. Its aim is to change the actions of individuals, and make Japanese society—including the industries, economies, energy systems, lifestyles, regions—fair, peaceful, stable, and sustainable.\n\nAfter the meeting visit the Nishiki Market, “the Kitchen of Kyoto” which dates back to the 14th century. The market has been operating for over 400 years and covers five narrow long blocks with over 125 stalls. You’ll find all the major ingredients of traditional Kyoto cuisine on display here: tsukemono (Japanese pickles), fresh tofu, Kyo-yasai (Kyoto vegetables), wagashi (Japanese sweets), tea, and fresh fish and shellfish. Some shops sell takeaway food like skewers of yakitori or sashimi, and a few sit-down restaurants can be found amid the shops. Some of the best food to try at Nishiki Market include tako tamago (octopus and quail’s egg), goma dango (sesame dumplings), satsuma(fish cakes) and fresh grapefruit juice.\n\nAt the other end of the market visit the Nishiki Tenmangū Shrine, a Shinto shrine dedicated to the deity Tenjin. Despite its small size, Nishiki Tenmangū sees a lot of foot traffic from the market, and it is considered one of the preeminent Tenjin shrines. Easily spotted by the many softly glowing lanterns hung at the entrance, Nishiki Tenmangū’s cozy grounds contain a natural spring, some nostalgic fortune-telling, a statue of Tenjin’s divine messenger, and a sanctuary dedicated to Tenjin himself.\n\nThen we will drive to lunch at Nishio Yatsuhasi No Sato, located on the site of a Taisho era mansion designated as one of “the buildings or gardens chosen by Kyoto citizens to preserve as a part of Kyoto’s assets” in 2012. Enjoy a lunch of side dishes including freshly fried tempura and white miso soup, all made with seasonal ingredients unique to Kyoto\n\nNext door is Nishio Yatsuhashi, known for its Kyoto sweets, most famous of which is its freshly made Yatsuhashi. The Yatsuhashiya Bairin Tea Shop founded in the forest of Shogoin Temple in the first year of the Genroku era was the birthplace of the Nishio Yatsuhashi. In 1689 a simple rice cracker in the shape of a bridge, which became the prototype for the current Yatsuhashi, was born. Since then, while inheriting over 300 years of history, the store has earned countless laurels as it continues to spread Yatsuhashi’s deliciousness to foreign countries since the Meiji era. In 1889 the shop won a silver medal at the Paris World Expo. More recently the store introduced a fresh Yatsuhashi with filling, which is now widely known as the famous confectionery that represents Kyoto.\n\nEnjoy a stroll along the Philosopher’s Walk, a pretty path bordering a canal. Begin at Ginkaku-ji, the Silver Pavilion built for Ashikaga Yoshimasa in 1482. He filled the villa with paintings collected over a lifetime and made it a hub for all the different arts inspired by Zen.\n\nEnd the day at the Matsui Brewery which was founded was founded in the 11th year of Emperor Kyoho (1726). At that time, sake brewing was being carried out by the 4th-generation owner, Jiemon Matsui, who was a vassal of Takagi Castle in Tajima Province, in Shinoshoshimohama Village (later Kasumi Village, now Kami City, Hyogo Prefecture). After that, the Matsui family maintained the business for generations, following the name of Jiemon Matsui, until the 12th generation owner. At the end of the Tokugawa period, it moved to Takeya-cho, Kawaramachi, Kyoto and about 100 years ago moved to its current place, towards the end of the Taisho era. The water from a shallow well about 15m deep was used to brew the sake.\n\nDinner on your own. Bruce and Andrew will highlight some Kyoto specialty restaurants, or perhaps you want to revisit one of the markets from an earlier visit.\n\nAccommodation: Hotel Cross Kyoto or similar (3 Nights)\n\nMeals included: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner\n\nThis morning meet with Professor Mariko Akuzawa, an expert on Burakumin Liberation and Human Rights based in Osaka.Her research area are human rights education and sociology of education, focusing on challenges in disseminating concepts of universal human rights into local communities through education and training implemented by government, civil society, and national human rights institutions in Northeast and Southeast Asia region, and changing patterns of discrimination in contemporary Japan against minority Buraku discrimination. The Buraku, a caste-like minority among ethnic Japanese, face discrimination because of an association with work once considered impure, such as butchering animals or tanning leather. Originally meaning hamlet, the word Buraku began to acquire a new connotation after the Meiji era (1868 -1912) administrators started to use “Tokushu Buraku” (special hamlet) in reference to former outcaste communities. Even though the caste system was abolished in 1871 during the Meiji Restoration alongside the feudal system, many Burakumin, or as they’re also known, “untouchables,” still find it difficult to fully integrate into society. Burakumin communities are still rampant throughout Japan.\n\nEnjoy a taiko drum performance. In taiko history, there is a conscious disassociation of the production of the taiko, where handling of leather is considered ‘spiritually impure’, from the performance, which is often associated with ‘purifying’ religious rituals. While human rights, minority rights and cultural approaches have failed in emancipating the Burakumin in Japanese society. Innovative drumming groups comprised entirely of Burakumin have formed as a way to overcome the stigma and be written back into a narrative that historically silenced them.\n\nFrom here enjoy a two hour tour designed to provide an introduction to Osaka and the history and culture of this vibrant city. Explore Osaka’s growth from an early mercantile center to a bustling economic Asian powerhouse. Begin near Osaka Castle and learning about the rule of Osaka after the unification in the 16th century. Although not the original structure, the site offers an important location to discuss the rule of Toyotomi Hideyoshi and the violent emergence of the Tokugawa shogunate.\n\nFrom here travel to the buzzing district in Osaka: Dotonbori. Named after a 17th-century merchant, Yasui Doton, the area has a 400-year-long history of entertainment. Stroll through the warren streets and finish at Kuromon market - an arcaded local haunt with shops specializing in everything from fresh urchins to seasonal vegetables.\n\nLunch and afternoon at leisure.\n\nEnjoy a special farewell dinner this evening.\n\nAccommodation: Zentis Osaka Hotel"
