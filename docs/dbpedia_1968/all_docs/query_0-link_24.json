HALL AND TOSHIO NOH ANN ARBOR/THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN PRESS/1970 PUBLISHED FOR THE CENTER FOR JAPANESE STUDIES\n\nPage [unnumbered] Copyright ( by The University of Michigan 1970 All rights reserved Published in the United States of America by The University of Michigan Press and simultaneously in Toronto, Canada, by Ambassador Books Limited Manufactured in the United States of America\n\nPage I Foreword It has now been fourteen years since the publication of the first edition of this bibliography. During this period the number of American scholars and students using Japanese-language materials has constantly expanded, the appearance of studies in Japanese geography has increased significantly, and the strength and distribution of major Jananese-language collections in the libraries of this country has grown enormously. The purpose of this second edition is to bring up to date the listing and evaluation of Japanese works pertaining to the geography of Japan. The compilation of this edition, as in the case of the original edition, is a product of the collaboration of two distinguished geographers of Japan: Professor Robert B. Hall of the University of Michigan and Professor Toshio Noh of Tohoku University. The research for this bibliography extends over a number of years and the bulk of the work was done in Japan by Professor Noh and his assistants. This bibliography becomes the tenth volume in the Bibliographical Series of the Center for Japanese Studies which has aimed to bring to the attention of Western scholars major Japanese works in the humanities and social sciences. They are intended to serve as an introduction to Japanese research materials in the several disciplines and hence as an aid to research for teachers and students. Previous bibliographies in this series have covered the fields of Political Science, Japanese Dialects, Archaeology and Ethnology, History, Economics, Geography, Religion and Philosophy, and Literature of the Showa Period. Each bibliography is selective; each item is believed to be of some value or interest to the scholarly user and is described or evaluated to provide guidance in its use. The format is uniform within each volume. In general, the name of the author or compiler is given both in romanization and character. The surnames are given first and the given names next. The names of corporate authors, such as government authors, are given in romanization and characters; they are then translated. Similarly, the sequence of romanization followed by characters is followed in listing the title of each book or article. However, journal titles, the place of publication and the name of the publishers are given only in romanization. The present edition on Japanese Geography follows the classification system used in the 1956 edition, with the single exception of the elimination of a previous section on \"Areas of the Former Japanese Empire.\" In addition to up-dating the bibliography by the exclusion of out-of-date items in the first edition and the inclusion of a large percentage of new entries, the total number of 1254 entries in the first edition has been increased to 1486 in this revised edition. The scope of each section of the bibliography is defined by the compilers and the organizing principles used in producing this edition are well expressed in their introduction to the first edition, of which the following excerpts are pertinent: The intent in compiling this bibliography has been to bring to the attention of Western geographers and other interested scholars those geographical writings of the Japanese which have appeared in the Twentieth Century and which are regarded by the compilers as significant contributions. Thus, only materials which fall within the scope of geography as a modern science have been included. An exception to this rule, which seems a valid one, is the inclusion of the more important anthologies of pre-Meiji geographical writings published since 1900. The problem of selection has been a difficult one as a truly vast quantity of published research is involved. The Japanese are an unusually geographicallyminded people. This is particularly true in terms of local and regional interest - an attitude which has pertained in most periods of Japanese history, as evidenced by the enormous production of local and regional descriptions and maps. More recently, studies of national scope have become increasinglV more numerous. Conversely, there has been relatively little interest shown by Japanese geographers in areas other than Japan or in the compilation of systematic and exhaustive bibliographies of their own geographical materials. This general lack of standard bibliographies and guides to Japanese geographical literature has compelled the present compilers to place heavy reliance upon direct observation and upon the advice of Japanese experts. Direct observation would have been used, in any event where feasible, but neither compiler can claim expertness in all fields of geography. Furthermore, in this postwar period, Japanese scholarship has been rather sharply divided into different schools of interpretation and so it has not always been possible to secure impartial judgment. The standard for selection has been twofold: (1) which titles would prove most valuable to the general geographer, and (2) which would best bring to the attention of the Western scholar the extent and quality of Japanese geographical research? The authors have used their best judgment in selection but do not anticipate that this will be universally accepted as the wisest. i\n\nPage II The problems of organization and balance have also proved to be difficult ones, as there is little precedent, especially in light of the standard for selection employed. It was decided to allow the categories to develop as the materials selected took form and to make no attempt to balance categories but rather to let them assume proportion as the materials selected indicated. Much of the material, valuable to geographers, in Japan as elsewhere, is not geography in the strictest sense of the word or at least is hidden in the writings of other social and physical scientists. For this reason, reference to bibliographies in other disciplines is essential. Particularly is this true of the Bibliographical Series of the University of Michigan's Center for Japanese Studies and especially: No. 1, A Guide to Japanese Reference and Research Materials in the Field of Political Science, (Revised EditionT, by Robert E. Ward; No. 4, Japanese History: A Guide to Japanese Reference and Research Materials, by John W. Hall; and No. 5, Japanese Economics: A Guide to Japanese Reference and Research Materials, by Charles F. Remer and Sabur5 Kawai. As has been previously mentioned, the vast store of pre-Meiji and early Meiji geographical writings has been excluded. This is in part because of the limitations of space in this single volume. Even more important have been the problems of interpretation, evaluation, availability, and specialized emphases. The earlier material has great geographical value and should be covered in another volume, but the task will require the close cooperation of scholars of early Japanese literature and history. Again, much of this earlier material is not geography in the strictest sense. Rather it is commonly made up of general treatises with emphasis upon local and regional history, local customs and legends, local productions, and the lore and treasures of local shrines and temples. Nevertheless, it does contain much highly important geographical data not otherwise available. Such are the oft-cited fudoki, the compilation of which began when the first court order pertaining to them was issued in 713 A.D. and ended about 925 A.D. Unfortunately, most of these priceless documents were lost but, later, remnants were recovered, as in the case of the fudoki of Izumo, Hitachi, Harima, Hizen and Bungo. Others are known today only as fragments and through references in other writings. Travel diaries also contributed valuable materials. Among these is the Tosa nikki of Kino-Tsurayuki. The Engishiki, 905 A.D., was in the tradition of the early fudoki and encompassed all of the area then under control of the central government. There is nothing to take its place for this critical period. In the middle of the Eleventh Century, another great travel diary was written. This is the Sarachina nikki by a daughter of Sugawara Takasue. Mention, too, should be made of the preservation of original documents in temple and private collection through these and the following centuries. The Tokugawa era accounts for the enormous Edo period (1603-1868). A bibliography or rather book listing of some 70,000 titles has been compiled by Mr. Yasui Yoshitaro of Ojimachi, Nara prefecture. There are several significant collections of this material extant in Japan but only one has even a sizable part of the whole. This is to be found at the Tenrikyo library at Tambaichi. Very little Edo period material is to be found abroad. Not to entirely neglect these valuable pre-Meiji contributions which are so important a part of the modern Japanese geographer's tradition, the authors have included certain transcribed compilations of these early materials, published since 1900, such as the Dai-Nihon chishi taikei. In the period covered by the bibliography, both the quantity and quality of publications in physical geography have exceeded those in cultural or human geography. This is understandable in the light of the interests and training of the founders of modern geography in Japan and in the light of the security regulations and atmosphere which long prevailed. Until World War II, studies in cultural geography were largely morphological and/or purely descriptive. Currently, better interpretive studies in the cultural area are being produced and at an accelerated rate. The Center for Japanese Studies is deeply indebted to Professor Noh for the care and patience shown in the compilation of this bibliography and to Professor Hall for his sustained support in its completion. Special thanks are due to Miss Susan Dawkins for her painstaking typing of the manuscript and to Mrs. Chizuko Taeusch who wrote the characters. Roger F.

Although the tradition was thus very strong for the listing of previous written materials and the recitation of former works, the idea and the system of listing the materials was very different from modern bibliography in the Western sense. Few bibliographies of the pre-Meiji period could survive after the tests based on new standards, and the tradition in Japan has not been strong enough to produce many bibliographic publications since Meiji. Geographical bibliographies are very scarce and those which have appeared at all have had very narrow circulation. This is no cause for wonder, since the circle of professional geographers who are concerned with purely geographical bibliographies has never been large, and their scope of interest was not confined within the limits of geography in its strictest sense. 1. Hoyanagi Mutsumi ~t, S, Nihon no gakusha ni yoru Chugoku-hondo ni kansuru chirigakuteki kenkyu chosho shiryo rombun mokurok-u g~ )-:: t l' t^.......... (A bibliography of geographical books, research\" materials and articles on Mainland China by Japanese scholars), Tokyo, Tokyo Chigaku Kyokai, 1964, 109 pp. Research carried out mainly during the war by Japanese scholars on the geography of Mainland China is gradually being forgotten and is going to be lost. Hoyanagi is interested in discovering and preserving these studies in a bibliography, and selects the period from 1935 to 1950. The contents are classified into original books, translations, and articles; the books and the articles are classified by region: Mainland China as a whole, North China, Central and South China, Mongolia and the Frontiers. All the works listed here are acknowledged by the editor and are available in Japan. Lists of contents are attached to the original books. 2. Jimbun Chiri Gakkai /A i~ X'A (Society of Human Geography),ed., Chirigaku bunken mokuroku dainishu C (Bibliography of geography, volume 2), Ky7to, Yanagiwara Shoten, 1957, 378 pp. This is a sequence of the Bibliography of geography published in 1953 which covered the period 1945-51. The publications which appeared from 1952 to 1956 are listed not only by sub-field of geography but also by related fields. Yearbooks, statistical works, etc., are also given. Quantitatively, a large percentage of items relate to economic geography and historical geography, a fact which reflects trends in geographical study in Japan. The increase of proceedings from universities is anotheaspect worthy of note. A list of periodicals is included. 3. Kagaku Gijutsucho Shigenkyoku 'f, (Bureau of Resources, Board of Science and Technology), Nihon shigen bunken mokuroku Bu X/^^' \\ ^ (Bibliography on natural resources in Japan), Tokyo, Kagaku Gijutsucho Shigenkyoku, 5 vols., 1953 -1957, v. 1, 450 pp.; v. 2, 440 pp.; v. 3, 240 pp.; v. 4, 250 pp.; Index, 180 pp. About 220,000 publications are classified by the international decimal system. In this book \"natural resources\" is used in the broadest sense of the term. Consequently, the bibliography covers virtually all fields of knowledge. Geography is especially relevant to problems in natural resources, and is often referred to. 4.

It is impractical to attempt to list them all here. Only those with a definite geographical emphasis are included. In the case of specialized studies, reference should be made to the appropriate categories in the other bibliographies of this series, e. g., those listed in the section on historical geography in John W. Hall's Japanese history: a guide to Japanese reference and research materials. The Western geographer in his studies of Japan will find constant need for these types of reference material. This is particularly true as regards place names, local terminology, and the scholarly terminology in use at any one period. The Japanese, fortunately, have a strong tradition as compilers of such reference materials, and aids can be found in almost all areas of interest to the geographer. The Japanese have also long been prolific producers of travel guides, items alsays of interest to the geographer. Many are but slightly modified copies of previous publications. Many were designed for limited and short-time circulation and are not especially useful. The attempt has been made here to select tne most important ones for listing and comment. 14. Sokuryo Jiten Henshu Iinkai la, C~ t (The Compilation Committee for a Dictionary of Surveying), Sokuryo Jiten 'Bit (Dictionary of surveying), Tokyo, Morikita Shuppan, 1965, 185 pp. The Compilation Committee consists of the members of the Geographical Survey Institute, the Bureau of Land Survey, and the School of Engineering at Chuo University. In this dictionary, about 2,500 items are arranged in the order of the Japanese alphabet, and comments averaging 200 words are given. The items are indicated first in kana, then in Chinese characters, finally in English. Indexes in Japanese and in English are attached at the end of this volume. Recent developments in photogrammetry and in the use of electric and magnetic waves are treated with care. A. General 15. Heibonsha Ts, ed., Sekai daihyakka jiten is Lk (World encyclopedia), Tokyo, Heibonsha, 1955-1958, 32 v. This is the largest and most comprehensive of the modern Japanese encyclopedias. Volume 31 includes 264 pages of supplements and 134 pages of appendices consisting of historical and geographical tables. Volume 32 is a complete index. Geography is the largest of the classified divisions of contents. Continents, countries, and cities are handled in detail, and five color maps are attached to the more important of them. Many topics other than geography also contain geographical or semi-geographical information, especially those on natural history, population, industry, etc. The contents have been partially revised, and later editions appear in different numbers of volumes. 16. Iimoto Nobuyuki j ~ '4t 4 ed., Nihon chiri jiten (A dictionary of Japaneese geography), Tokyo, Seibundo Shinkosha, 1957,414 pp. This regional geography of Japan is written by 16 contributors for the purpose of compiling a reference book for teachers of social studies. Systematic descriptions and a detailed index enable the use of this volume as a dictionary. 17.

Kagami Kanji ~ 1, Nihon chimeigaku (kagaku-hen) 3c [( %tX (The study of Japanese place names: scientific section), Nihon Chimeigaku Kenkyujo, 1957, 406 pp. The author has found out that there are regional characteristics in the distribution of place names and that linguistic changes of pronunciation are associated with chronological changes of place names. From an analysis of root forms of place names, 20 fossil names are obtained, and five culture regions based on place names are defined. The phenomena of diffusion, shrinking, splitting and agglomeration of place names are left to be clarified by future study. 20. Nihon Hoso Kyokai, 13/ ~am- (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), Gaikoku chimei hatsuon jiten M15 - Ahvkl A (Dictionary of the pronunciation of foreign place names), Tokyo, Nihon Hoso Kyokai, 1956, 522 pp. An enlarged revision of the 1950 edition. 18,000 place names are listed, excluding Japan, China and Korea. The representation of pronunciation in kana as closely as possible to pronunciation in the respective country is the objective. Customary pronunciations are also adopted. Names of countries, states, cities with populations of more than 5,000, mountains, rivers, lakes, capes, islands, etc. are included. Generally speaking, however, emphasis is this connection falls on the former items. C. Travel Guides 21.

The breadth of geography is such that almost all publications of this sort contain some data pertinent to the subject. The selection of items here listed was based upon availability and largest value to the geographer. The Japanese are energetic collectors of this type of quantitative data. As in other countries, the practical problems of publication compel the grouping of local statistics into larger political wholes. This is seldom satisfactory to the geographer. Fortunately, local government units usually preserve these materials and they are available for field study. This is often true at the buraku level, and almost always so in the mura offices. One troublesome problem is that the categories for collection change very frequently and it is difficult to make comparative studies. Another is that the statistical services were interrupted or stopped by pre-war security regulations, by war time curtailment, and by change and adjustment during the occupation. If possible one should find the answer to the question, \"Why and for whom were these particular statistics produced?\" Changes in minor political divisions have been so numerous in recent years that the use of local statistics have become very different in many areas. 32.

The object of this classification is to define the nature of the respective industry and use the information as a statistic. The decimal system is adopted and there are four stages of classification: major, medium, minor, and subdivisions. The classification of industries in Japan was first carried out in 1930, and was revised in 1940. The system was perfected after the war in 1949, in association with international statistical activities. Minor revisions were made in 1951, 1953, 1954, 1957, and 1963.\n\nPage 6 6 JAPANESE GEOGRAPHY 33.

Many sets of books appeared in this period covering the geography of Japan as a whole. It would seem that enough local and regional studies had been made in the preceding years to allow broader generalization to be valid. There were also sets covering the world or large parts thereof. Some were by single authors, others by several authors. These sets on Japan are still the basic sources of material for the general geography of Japan. Some new sets have appeared since the war but for the most part they show no fundamental improvement over the older ones in either quality or amount of information, except that statistical and like data are more up to date. This category also includes sets and single volumes of collections of scholarly lectures and essays. Some are entirely by professional geographers while others include the work of other scholars whose interests penetrate or at least touch upon the field of geography. They contain some excellent work. In general these publications are not too well organized and rarely has there been any attempt at integration. 60.

After the national census of 1955, the Bureau of Statistics started to prepare population maps based on the results of the census. The contents of the maps are almost the same for the two censuses in 1955 and 1960. They consist of three sets of three sheets for all of Japan. The sets are: 1) Population density by shi, ku, machi, and mura, 2) Population changes by the same unit, and 3) Population density and densely populated areas. The scale of the maps is 1:1,000,000 for all sets. A text ex — plaining the procedures of making these maps and a list of densely populated areas are attached to set 1). 68. Tada Fumio 9 g and Ishida Ryujiro X?, ed., Gendai chiri koza,j)~tjp^ (Lectures on modern geography), Tokyo, Kawade Shobo, 1956-57, 7 v. Unlike former works of this kind, the problem approach was adopted in the compilation of this set. Each volume has a topical problem about which there are several articles by different authors. The merits and also the weakness of this program resulted in the elimination of the last volume, due to the insolvency of the publisher. The titles of the volumes are as follows: volume one, nature and society; volume two, geography of the mountain lands; volume three, geography of the plains; volume four, geography of cities and villages; volume five, geography of the ocean and ground water; volume six, geography of tropics, arctic zones, and inland areas; and volume seven, geography of production.\n\nPage 12 12 JAPANESE GEOGRAPHY 69.

This three-part set is designed to systematize the knowledge of modern geography. Part one (six volumes) deals with physical and applied geography; part two (seven volumes) with history of geography and human geography; and part three (eight volumes) with regional geography. By the end of 1965, nine volumes (geomorphology, climatology, and seven volumes of regional geography) were published. The quality is fairly high, but the profusion of articles written by too many contributors reveals the deficiency of the approach. 70.

A very considerable part of the nation's scientific writing appears in them. Most of these journals are so highly specialized that they have the support of only a limited number of subscribers. As a result they are often short-lived. The material which appears in them is generally not reproduced elsewhere so libraries are compelled to keep many fragmentary sets of now-defunct periodicals. In the field of geography, the journals associated with the foremost academic departments of geography are the most important. Chirigaku hyoron (Geographical review) is now the journal of the Nihon Chiri Gakkai or Association of Japanese Geographers, but it started as the house organ of the Geographical Institute of Tokyo University in 1925. Its publication continues to date and it is still closely bound to Tokyo University. The geographers of Kyoto University launched their journal, Chikyu (The globe), in 1924. Unfortunately, this excellent journal went out of existence in the late 1930s. Since the war Kyoto University has acquired a new geography staff which started a new journal called Jimbun chiri (Human geography) in 1948. Departments of geography in some other universities also have their own journals, notably Tokyo Kyoiku Daigaku (formerly Tokyo Bunrika Daigaku) and Tohoku Daigaku. An exception to the rule of university affiliation for research level journals is the Chigaku zasshi or Journal of geography of the Tokyo Geographical Society.\n\nPage 13 PERIODICALS 13 There were a number of other geographical journals before the war which served the needs primarily of grade school teachers. These had large subscription lists and ran over a good many years until the war brought them to an end. These journals cannot be overlooked by the research geographer, for a good many excellent studies appeared in them. 73. Chiba Daigaku Engeigakubu gakujutsu hokoku 'IttP Af?K^ (The technical bulletin of the Faculty of Horticulture, Chiba University), Matsudo, Faculty of Horticulture, Chiba University, 1953-, annual.

The staff and activities of the Association are closely related to Kokudo Chiriin (Geographical Survey Institute), a fact which more or less weakens the academic nature of this publication. However, it meets academic standards of map representation and projection, and also treats technical problems of cartography. The main papers are supplemented by English abstracts. Current topics and information about new maps are included. Sheets of up-to-date topical maps are attached, most of which are published by the Geographical Survey Institute. 77. Daiyonki kenkyu KSogZ t (Quaternary Research), Tokyo, Nippon Daiyonki Gakkai, 1957-, irregular.

This is a scientific journal created for the purpose of publishing the results of research by the staff of the Japan Meteorological Agency. The papers consist of articles and reports, the latter being shorter papers. Both of them are accompanied by English abstracts. The papers are mainly positive studies rather than theoretical. There are many studies in which the meteorological characteristics of various regions are analyzed, and hence they are of much geographical value as materials for the study of climatology. 92. Kisho shushi t, (Journal of the Meteorological Society of Japan), Tokyo, Nihon Kisho Gakkai, 18 2-, bimonthly. This is Japan's representative journal of meteorology, and most of the results of theoretical research and work dealing with large areas are published here.

Almost countless maps were printed, largely from wood block, before the Restoration and in the early Meiji period. These included maps of the world as Japan knew it, of Japan as a whole, of the great roads and the regions through which they passed, and of cities and towns. These early printed maps are intriguing collectors' items and are fast disappearing. They are generally of limited value for research, except in the history of cartography, as they were essentially pictograms and cannot be compared with the modern, scientifically compiled map. Researchwise, however, this early period produced many detailed manuscript maps of local areas, portraying irrigation systems, political holdings, land reclamation projects, and many other features. These are to be found today in the collections of temples, of great families, and in local governmental offices and are generally available to the field worker for study or reproduction. During the period of Japanese geography as a science, there have been two major lines of cartographic production. The first is the topographical sheets of the Imperial Survey, now being carried forward by the Chiri Chosajo or Geographical Survey institute of the Ministry of Construction. These sheets are in magnificent detail, have long been easily and cheaply available to the public, and cover the entire country. The major series were 1:50,000 and 1:25,000, although sheets of scales to 1:5,000 and even less were made for critical areas of Japan. These top sheets are the greatest single source of geographical data on Japan and have been of tremendous aid to geographers. It is safe to say that these sheets have been practically the sole source of cartographic data for non-government publishers of maps and atlases. The other main line of cartographic production has been in the publication of atlases. Most of these are small and cheap and are revised frequently for the use of school children. These number literally in the hundreds and are all very much alike, so there is little point in attempting to list them. Atlases at a more comprehensive level are few indeed, although since the war this condition has been much improved. Air-photographs originally were under the strict control of the Japanese Army and were not available for ordinary research purposes. SCAP also restricted them, and the current Defense Force seems unlikely to alter this established policy. Immediately after the war some of the old Japanese Army air-Dhoto material became public ana a few books of air-pnotos were printed. However, under conditions existing now this potentially excellent research material is not available. A large number of important mans have appeared since the publication of Volume I of this bibliography. Particularly significant are the publications of the Geographic Survey Institute and the Geological Survey Institute. 118. Aichi-ken Bosai Kaigi o^X' (Natural Disaster Defense Congress, Aichi Prefecture), Aichi-ken suigai kiken chiiki soteizu z ~, i XJo, _ — (A map of assumptive flood disaster in Aichi Prefecture), Aichi-ken, Aichi-ken Bosai Kaigi, 1962, 2 sheets, text, 15 pp. These are two sheets of 1:50,000 color maps of the eastern and western parts of Mikawa Province. Assumptive range of floods, possible outlets, the flow of flood water, and assumed depths are indicated. Available shelters, pumping stations, passable roads in time of flood, and other information are shown on the maps. An attached text explains the assumptions on which the maps were prepared. 119.

The editors are geologists of Tohoku University. In the lower part of the map, a detailed table is given showing the classification of post-Miocene layers correlating twenty-seven divisions of this prefecture, and the sharp contrast between Tsugaru Province to the west and the Shimokita-Hachinohe area to the east is well indicated. The text consists of two Darts, the Tertiary and the Quaternary. 120. Chiri Chosajo 3A /t1 4 (Geographical Survey Institute), Nihon jinko mitsudo X A~URAt (Japanese population density), Chiba, Chiri Chosajo, 1957, 3 sheets.\n\nPage 20 20 JAPANESE GEOGRAPHY Using the data of the 1950 census, population density by municipality is classified into eleven grades and is represented by color. The scale of the main map is 1:800, 000. Attached maps are: 1) 1:3.5 million map of population in which every five hundred people are represented by a dot, 2) 1:3.5 million map of population density in seven grades in early Meiji, 3) 1:3.5 million map of population density in four grades indicated by isopleths, and 4) 1:3.5 million map of the urban population. 121. Chiri Chosajo AS 61J' [j (Geographical Survey Institute), Nihon no chisei gEk t (Landforms of Japan), Chiba, Chiri Chosajo, 1958, 3 sheets. This is one of the series of 1:800,000 maps of Japan. Landforms printed in black and blue are indicated in bird's-eye view style. A 1:3.5 million map is inserted showing the division and names of geomorphic regions. 122.

These are six sheets of color maps in the scale of 1:75,000, showing damages from the flood of September, 1947, in the drainage area of the Tone and the Arakawa. They represent changes of the courses of the Tone River, an isopleth map of the inundation of Sakura-tsutsumi, the depths of the inundation of the Tone and the Arakawa Rivers, the lengths of the period of inundation of the Tone and the Arakawa, an isochronological map of the progress of the flood of the Tone and the Arakawa, and that of Sakura-tsutsumi. In the first map, the changes of river courses since the eighth century are shown; and their relation with the outlets of floods at the time of September, 1947, is well indicated. In the maps showing the march of the floods, the flow lines of the inundation are shown together with areas in which the houses were washed away. 123. Chiri Chosajo T and Sorifu Tokeikyoku Gun-shi-choson kai sozu _~?[ ^^ (Gun, shi, machi, and mura boundaries), Tokyo, Chiri Ch5sajo and Sorifu Tokeikyoku, 1958. The boundaries of administrative units, gun, shi, machi, and mura, are shown in three sheets of 1:800,000 maps in two colors. The boundaries are shown as of October 1, 1955, in order to be consistent with the National Census carried out on that day. The legends are the boundaries of prefectures and shicho (in Hokkaido), those of shi and gun, of ku, machi, and mura; and where the boundaries are not decided, areas of double belongings. The boundaries are printed in brown, and the numbers corresponding to those used in the National Census of 1955, volume five, are printed in blue. 124.
