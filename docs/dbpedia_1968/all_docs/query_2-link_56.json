        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Agu is the only native pig breed in Japan, which is reared in Okinawa prefecture, the southernmost region in Japan. Agu pigs are relatively small-bodied (around 100 kg at maturity) with coarse black hairs, semi-erect ears and a sagging abdomen. The reproductive performances of Agu sows are as follows: total number born, number born alive and number weaned was 4.8, 4.1, and 3.3, respectively which was smaller than half the number of European breeds [1]. Despite their low growth performance and lean meat productivity, Agu pigs have good meat qualities such as a lower cooking loss and higher intramuscular fat content than commercial pig breeds [2]. Meat of the Agu pig has been a source of food for the inhabitants of Okinawa islands [3]. The introduction of European breeds in the early 1900s for improving the performance of Agu pigs gradually reduced the number of pure Agu, which by 1980s stood at about 30 animals. Because of the continuous promotion of conservation and propagation by the local government, the population of Agu pigs has recovered and reached around 1,200 animals in 2016.\n\nAlthough the details of the origins of the Agu are not yet understood, It is generally believed that the ancestors of the Agu pig were introduced from the Asian continent in the latter half of the 14th century when the ancient Kingdom of Okinawa began to trade with China [4,5]. Nonetheless, recent studies on ancient mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from bones excavated at archaeological sites have suggested that the introduction of domestic pigs to Okinawa from the Asian continent dates back to prehistoric times [6,7].\n\nTo date, the sequences of the mtDNA cytochrome b gene of Agu pigs have matched perfectly with those of Meishan and Jinhua pigs [8]. Phylogenetic analysis has disclosed that the only haplotype of Agu mtDNA discovered was clustered into an East Asian clade [9–11]; however, the investigations were conducted on a limited number of individuals. The genetic background of Agu pigs remains unclear; therefore, elucidating the genetic structure of the Agu is important for furthering its conservation and breeding. In this study, to clarify the maternal genetic background of Agu pigs, firstly, the mtDNA control regions of Agu pigs was sequenced and the phylogenetic relationship among Agu, East Asian and European pigs was investigated with the use of 78 Agu individuals as representative of the entire population. Secondly, the mtDNA control region of the currently modern Agu pigs was compared with that of ancient pigs excavated at archaeological sites in Okinawa.\n\nRESULTS\n\nSixty-five polymorphic sites were observed within the sequences of the mtDNA control region, about 1,045 bp after exclusion of the repeat motif. Fifty-eight transitions, five transversions and two nucleotide gaps were obtained ( ). Twenty-seven polymorphism sites were observed within the Agu population, demonstrating five different haplotypes (type 1-type 5). Haplotype 1 found in 23 individuals was completely identical to the sequence observed in Taoyuan 2 and Wanan pigs, the indigenous breeds of China and Taiwan, respectively. Haplotype 2, the major haplotype in the collected samples was found in forty-four Agu pigs. The remaining haplotypes 3, 4, and 5 were obtained from two, four and five Agu pigs, respectively.\n\nThe maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model to infer the genetic relationship between Agu pigs, East Asian pigs, European pigs and wild boars ( ). Thirty-five mtDNA haplotypes were divided into two major clades: East Asian and European (except for Berkshire and part of Large White breeds). The East Asian clade was divided into two subclades, AI and AII; the former included domestic pigs and Japanese wild boars, the latter comprised haplotypes of Ryukyu wild boars. Agu haplotypes 1 and 2 were clustered within the AI clade: Agu haplotype 1 was clustered within Taoyuan 2, Wanan and Wanhua pigs; haplotype 2 was clustered within the haplotype of Putian and Cheju pigs. The other haplotypes (3, 4, and 5) found in the Agu population were classified within the European type clade. Sixty-seven out of 78 Agu individuals (85.9%) possessed mtDNA haplotypes 1 and 2 of the East Asian lineage. A median-joining network of haplotypes was constructed to visualize the relationship among haplotypes within Agu population ( ). Five haplotypes of the Agu were divided into two groups (type 1 and 2 vs type 3, 4, and 5), which is consistent with the maximum likelihood Phylogenetic tree ( ).\n\nIn comparing the haplotypes of Agu pigs with five haplo types of ancient pigs in Okinawa ( ), two haplotypes of ancient mtDNA were found identical to the Agu haplotypes in this study. One ancient mtDNA (Ryukyu 87 2000-1700 BP, 572 bp) was identical to Agu haplotype 1 and the other mtDNA (Noguni 569 7200-4400 BP, 215 bp) was identical to Agu haplotype 2 ( ).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe Agu is the only indigenous pig in Japan. We sequenced the complete mtDNA control regions of 78 Agu pigs from 24 farms as representative of the entire population. This is the first comprehensive survey of the mtDNA control region of the Agu pig population in which five haplotypes (type 1 to type 5) were detected. Haplotype 1 accorded with previous studies [9,11]. The other four haplotypes were newly found in the Agu pig population. These previous studies by Watanobe et al [9] and Takada et al [11] were conducted on a limited number of Agu pigs (one and six individuals from one farm). The present comprehensive survey with the use of 78 individuals from 24 farms provided four new haplotypes in the Agu pig population. In the phylogenetic analysis, 35 mtDNA haplotypes of Agu pigs, East Asian pigs, European pigs and wild boars were generally divided into two major clades: East Asian and European, as described in previous studies [10,18–20]. Agu mtDNA haplotypes 1 and 2 were clustered within the East Asian clade, whereas Agu haplotypes 3, 4, and 5 were clustered within the European clade ( ). In addition, a median-joining network divided five haplotypes of the Agu into two groups (type 1 and 2 vs type 3, 4, and 5). These results indicated that the Agu pig population has two distinct maternal lineages: East Asian pigs and European pigs; Eastern Asian lineage is dominant in the Agu population. Based on historical background, the ancestors of the Agu are assumed to have been introduced from Asian continent during the 14th century [3,4]. In fact, their morphological features are similar to some of the Asian breeds. Furthermore, the sequence of Agu haplotype 1 was identical to Wanan and Taoyuan 2 pigs, the indigenous breeds of China and Taiwan, respectively ( ). In 1904, Berkshire and Yorkshire breeds were introduced into Okinawa to improve the productivity of Agu pigs. In addition, after World War II many European breeds such as Hampshire, Chester White, Landrace, Large White and Duroc breeds were introduced into Okinawa [21,22]. In light of the history, Haplotypes 1 and 2 showed an East Asian lineage derived from the ancestors of the Agu pig. In contrast, the other three haplotypes (3, 4, and 5) showed European lineages were the result of a maternal gene flow from European breeds introduced into Okinawa after 1904.\n\nThe Ryukyu wild boar ( Sus scrofa riukiuanus) has inhabited the Okinawa islands since the Pleistocene [23]. In the present study, no haplotypes of the Ryukyu wild boar were found in Agu individuals. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis revealed that haplotypes of Agu pigs were distinct from those of Ryukyu wild boars ( ). Our results indicated the Ryukyu wild boar is not the ancestor of Agu pigs, and suggested that no maternal gene flow took place from the Ryukyu wild boar to the Agu pig population.\n\nThere are no historical records describing when the first domestic pigs were introduced into Okinawa. The earliest historical record about domestic pigs in Okinawa is found in the records of the Chosun Dynasty of Korea. The Annals of the Chosun Dynasty showed that Korean castaways who stayed in Okinawa for several months at the end of the 15th century saw domestic pigs. Although the exact time period is unclear, it is believed that the first introduction of domestic pigs in Okinawa was in the 14th century when the ancient Kingdom of Okinawa began to trade with China [4,5]. Nonetheless, ancient mtDNA haplotypes of the East Asian domestic pig lineage excavated at archaeological sites (2000-1700 and 7200-4400 BP, respectively) have been found in Okinawa [6,7], suggesting that domestic pigs were introduced into Okinawa from the Asian continent long before the commonly held view. In this study, two haplotypes (1 and 2) of the East Asian lineage were found in Agu pigs. Agu haplotype 1 has been reported as identical to an ancient mtDNA haplotype of Ryukyu 87 ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AB050869\",\"term_id\":\"13568412\",\"term_text\":\"AB050869\"}}AB050869) excavated at an archaeological site (2000-1700 BP) [6]. Our study, on the other hand, demonstrated that the new Agu haplotype 2 was identical to Noguni 569 ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AB900770\",\"term_id\":\"573461380\",\"term_text\":\"AB900770\"}}AB900770) found at an archaeological site (7200-4400 BP) by Takahashi et al [7] ( ). These results revealed the possibility that the mtDNA sequences of ancient pigs have been inherited by the modern Agu pig population. We are not able to come to that conclusion because of the short sequences of ancient mtDNA. In order to understand more clearly the relation between modern Agu pigs and ancient pigs in Okinawa, further analyses are needed, especially with the use of longer sequences of ancient mtDNA.\n\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrated that the Agu pig population has East Asian and European maternal lineages, that most Agu individuals possess East Asian haplotypes, and that East Asian lineage haplotypes of Agu pigs was derived from ancestral pigs introduced during the 14th century, or earlier, whereas European haplotypes are the result of maternal gene flow from European breeds introduced into Okinawa after 1904. Our results supported the hypothesis that the ancestors of the Agu pig were introduced from the Asian continent. The present study also provided useful information for further conservation of the Agu pig as the only native pig in Japan. However, mtDNA doesn’t reflect the characteristics of the nuclear genome, as it gives only maternal genetic information. Therefore, further molecular studies using nuclear genome markers are required for future management of this native pig."
