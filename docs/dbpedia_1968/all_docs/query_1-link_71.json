The visual assessment of kyphosis was associated with declines in ADL, suggesting that we can easily identify people at high risk to develop future ADL reduction in the community setting. Purpose: Age-related kyphosis is related with declines in activities of daily living (ADL). Its conventional diagnosis has been made by orthopedic surgeons and trained examiners using specialized equipment such as X-rays. We investigated whether visual classification of kyphosis by laypersons accurately predicted future ADL decline. Methods: This study was part of the Kurabuchi Study, a cohort study of community-dwelling elderly Japanese. Between 2009 and 2010, three layperson raters used reference illustrations to classify 532 participants without ADL decline at study baseline into four categories. Other examiners used conventional methods to assess kyphosis in the same participants: curve ruler, Spinal Mouse, and the block method. ADL decline was defined as the development of dependence according to the Katz Index, admission to a nursing home, or certification of long-term care need. Results: Thirty-five of the participants (6.6%) were classified with the most severe degree of kyphosis at baseline by visual assessment. Interrater agreement was high (Kappa = 0.73) for the most severe group. During 4.5 years of follow-up, 106 participants (19.9%) showed ADL decline. On the basis of visual assessment, the adjusted risk ratio for ADL decline among the participants with the most severe kyphosis was 2.6 (95% CI: 1.4–4.6). Assessments of kyphosis made with the Spinal Mouse also accurately predicted ADL decline. Conclusions: Visual assessment of kyphosis predicted future declines in ADL in this study. Since our method requires no special tools or training, it may be useful for identifying those at high risk of ADL decline.\n\n© 2018, The Japanese Society of Hypertension. While the association between 24-h urinary sodium and potassium excretion with blood pressure is well established, the relationships of these ions to spot urine measurements are unclear. Our purpose is to assess the association between blood pressure and the estimated 24-h sodium and potassium excretion from repeated single-spot urine samples. Spot urine and blood pressure were collected annually during a 5-year period from 4360 Japanese workers with ages ranging from 19 to 55 years. Estimates of 24-h sodium and potassium excretion were based on Tanaka’s formula. Overall, a single standard deviation increase in the estimated sodium excretion (36.5 mmol/day) was associated with a 1.3 mmHg higher systolic blood pressure and a 0.8 mmHg higher diastolic blood pressure (P < 0.001). A single standard deviation increase in estimated potassium excretion (8.9 mmol/day) was associated with a 1.1 mmHg lower systolic blood pressure and a 0.7 mmHg lower diastolic blood pressure (P < 0.001). As a combined measure of the excretion of both electrolytes, the estimated 24-h sodium-to-potassium ratio was positively associated with both blood pressures (P < 0.001). Associations of blood pressure with sodium and the sodium-to-potassium ratio increased with age and were stronger in men compared to women. Associations with potassium and the sodium-to-potassium ratio were stronger in individuals who were overweight. The findings provide evidence for an association between blood pressure and the estimated 24-h sodium and potassium excretion from repeated single-spot urine samples. As convenient measures of dietary intake for each electrolyte, repeated spot urine samples may be useful for assessing hypertension risk, especially in men, older individuals, and overweight individuals.\n\n© 2018 The Authors.

Objectives: The purpose of this study is to clarify the influence of social interaction on the effect of a cognitive intervention program using Go. Methods: A single-blind, randomized controlled trial using a classical board game “Go” was conducted. A total of 72 community-dwelling older adults, without previous experience playing Go, were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) a face-to-face group (FG) in which members attended 12 Go group lessons held once a week; (2) a non-face-to-face group (NFG) in which members individually underwent the same Go lessons as the FG using a tablet computer; or (3) a health education control group (CG). The main outcome variable, working memory, was assessed before and after the interventions using the Visual Memory Span Test (VMST) and the Visual Memory Span Backward (VMSB) task. Go performance and additional cognitive domains were also examined. Results: Analysis of covariance revealed that VMST scores significantly improved after the intervention in both the FG and NFG (both P <.05). Compared with the CG, the effect size of the FG (Cohen's d = 0.89) was greater than that of the NFG (Cohen's d = 0.67). Although VMSB scores significantly improved after the intervention in the FG (P <.05), no significant changes were observed in other groups. Conclusions: This study showed that Go game could improve visual working memory regardless of social interaction. Furthermore, findings suggested that playing board games face-to-face with others is more effective for cognitive function than playing alone.\n\n© 2019 The Authors. Journal of Occupational Health published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd on behalf of The Japan Society for Occupational Health Objectives: To establish an enzymatic deconjugation method to separately quantify urinary o-toluidine (OT), its six metabolites, another six chemicals present in an OT-processing plant, and one metabolite of p-toluidine, and to propose optimal urinary biological monitoring items of OT exposure. Methods: Thirty-six urine samples of an OT-processing plant's workers were obtained and pretreated by an enzymatic deconjugation method employing β-glucuronidase/arylsulfatase for 3 hours at 37°C and measured by liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). An alkaline hydrolytic pretreatment and 1-chlorobutane extraction procedure was also examined as a widely used urinary OT measurement method. Results: The 14 chemicals were separated by LC-MS condition set by us and 13 chemicals other than 2-chloroaniline showed satisfiable linearity and limits of determination. Standard substances of six OT metabolites decomposed after the alkaline heating. In the 36 urine samples, OT, N-(4-hydroxy-2-methylphenyl) acetamide (NHM), and 4-amino-m-cresol (ACR) accounted for approx. 90% of the total OT and OT metabolites, but inter-individual variation of the three substance excretion seemed to be wide. Time course of urinary excretion revealed that concentration of the three substances was higher 24 hours after the work shift's end rather than just after the work shift. Conclusions: OT and its six metabolites can each be determined with LC-MS. The alkaline method is not so optimal for exact biological monitoring. Rather, the sum of urinary OT, NHM, and ACR measured by the enzymatic method is a better index, and \"end of the workweek\" is a good urine-sampling time for the biological monitoring of OT exposure.\n\n© 2018 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd Background and Aim: Studies on the characteristics of elderly-onset ulcerative colitis (EOUC) and non-elderly-onset ulcerative colitis (NEOUC) have reported conflicting findings. The aim of this study was to compare disease characteristics of EOUC and NEOUC by analyzing the database of the Japanese nationwide inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) registry. Methods: We analyzed the age of disease onset, sex, disease severity, and disease extent in patients with ulcerative colitis that were newly diagnosed and registered within 1 year between 2004 and 2009 (n = 28 179). We also analyzed the medical treatment, rate of IBD-related surgery, and postoperative complications. We compared them between younger than 65 years old (NEOUC group) and 65 years old or older (EOUC group) patients. Results: A total of 25 401 (90.1%) and 2778 (9.9%) patients were included in the NEOUC and EOUC groups, respectively. In the EOUC group, disease activity was significantly higher, and extent of pathological changes in the colon more extended significantly. Laboratory findings showed that inflammatory markers were elevated significantly in the EOUC group. The proportion of those with IBD-related hospitalization was significantly higher in the EOUC group (54.2% vs 35.7%, P < 0.001). The proportion of patients who were treated with corticosteroids was significantly higher in the EOUC group (36.7% vs 30.8%, P < 0.001). Significantly more number of patients underwent IBD-related surgery in the EOUC group (0.68% vs 0.27%, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Elderly patients show higher disease activity, with a higher proportion requiring IBD-related hospitalization and IBD-related surgery, according to the nationwide registry in Japan.\n\n© 2018 Medknow.

Objective: This study aims to ascertain the incidence and association of falls and physical inactivity in patients with gastrointestinal cancer and hand-foot syndrome (HFS) after receiving chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Methods: The present cross-sectional study was conducted on 50 outpatients with HFS of Grade 1 or above, according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, following the receipt of chemotherapy or targeted therapy for gastrointestinal cancer in Japan between November 2016 and February 2017. For measurement, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire were used. Data were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Results: Of the participants, 18% experienced falls and 60% reported physical inactivity. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the DLQI treatment domain score was the only factor associated with falls (odds ratio [OR] =8.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.27-50.63, P = 0.027). Physical inactivity was associated with DLQI symptom and feeling domain scores (OR = 5.54, 95% CI = 1.26-24.33, P = 0.023) and the with-oxaliplatin or paclitaxel regimen (OR = 3.71, 95% CI = 1.06-13.03, P = 0.041). Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest patients should be informed that HFS is a risk factor for physical inactivity and falls.\n\n© Article author(s). Objectives: To clarify the priority given to periodical medical examination items among occupational physicians in Japan. Methods: Sixty-two occupational physicians who participated in this study selected statutory and non-statutory items within two types of budget plans: one lower (8,500 yen) than the total fee of statutory medical examinations (9,250 and 11,290 yen), and the other higher (12,000 yen) than the total fee. Medical fee points were used to set the cost of each medical examination item. A three round Delphi method was used from May to July 2016 to clarify the consensus opinion of occupational physicians. Results: The statutory items (selection rate: between 66 and 100%), except for waist circumference (15%) and sputum examination (0%), and serum creatinine (58%, non-statutory item ) were included in the smaller budget plan (8,500 yen) . In the larger budget plan (12,000 yen), the statutory items (selection rate: between 92 and 100%), except for waist circumference (39%) and sputum examination (0%), and some non-statutory items, namely serum creatinine (95%), leukocytes (92%), uric acid (89%), and fecal occult blood reaction (81%), had a selection rate over 80%. In addition, statutory items with higher accuracy were preferred, which included the following: air conduction pure-tone audiometry (92%), imaging diagnosis of thoracic X-ray examinations by a specialist (97%), glycated hemoglobin levels (98%), and electrocardiogram assessment by a specialist (100%). Conclusion: The statutory items, except for waist circumference and sputum examination, and some of the non-statutory items (e.g., serum creatinine ) were given higher priority among occupational physicians in Japan.\n\nWe aimed to evaluate the associations of individual-level social capital (SC) and physical activity (PA) among Japanese elderly men and women. Individuals aged 65 or above were selected via population-based random sampling of 3000 adults, aged 20 years or above and living in Fujisawa city, who were asked to complete self-administered questionnaires. The sample consisted of 260 men [median (25-75% tile) age 73 (68-78) yrs] and 274 women [73 (68-78) yrs]. The daily duration of PA, SC [e.g., norms of reciprocity (mutual support in the community), social networks (relationship with community people, exchange with other generations), social participation (participation in community organization activities)], socio-economic status [educational attainment, work with income, perceived household economic status], and demographic characteristics [sex, age, living arrangements, BMI, physical limitations] were assessed. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) for associations of SC with PA, stratified by sex. High level of mutual support in the community, relationship with community people, and exchange with other generations were associated with longer PA time in men after adjusting for potential confounders in the final model (OR = 2.40 (95% CI: 1.24-4.67), 5.28 (1.42-19.66), and 4.24 (1.15-15.67), respectively). In women, relationship with community people and participation in community organization activities were associated with longer PA time (3.10 (1.32-7.26) and 2.50 (1.27-4.91), respectively). The association of individual-level SC and PA differed between men and women. Future studies can investigate whether similar results can be obtained in other areas or attempt to conduct a large-scale survey.\n\nThe development of high-throughput metabolite measurement technologies has enabled the use of metabolomics for epidemiologic studies by profiling metabolite concentrations in large cohorts of human blood samples. Standard protocols are necessary to obtain unbiased profiles through multiple runs over long periods of time and to allow reliable statistical analyses. This study assessed the effects of sampling procedures and storage conditions on the stability of metabolomic profiles in plasma and serum. Charged metabolomic profiles were determined by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) and compared by multivariate analyses. The effects of pre-analytical procedures, including times for clotting and incubation of serum and plasma, respectively; incubation temperatures; and number of freeze-thaw cycles, were assessed. Overall, inter-individual differences in profiles were larger than intra-individual differences, and profiles in plasma showed better stability than those in serum. These quantified datasets of metabolites, along with their stability and variation, may help in interpreting data from long-term cohort studies.</p>\n\n<p>Purpose: Prejudices against palliative care are a potential barrier to quality end-of-life care. There have been few large-scale community-wide interventions to distribute appropriate information about palliative care, and no studies have investigated their impact on cancer patients, their families, and the general public. Thus, we conducted a 3-year community intervention and evaluated the effects of distributing such information at the community level, and explored associations among levels of exposure, perceptions, knowledge, and the sense of security achieved. Methods: Over a period of 3 years, we provided flyers, booklets, posters, and public lectures about palliative care in four regions of Japan, and carried out pre- and post-intervention surveys with repeated cross-sectional samplings of cancer patients (pre 859, post 857), bereaved family members (1110, 1137), and the general public (3984, 1435). The levels of exposure to the provided information were measured by a multiple-choice questionnaire after intervention. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to estimate multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for perceptions of palliative care, knowledge about opioids, and sense of security among the exposure groups. Results: Overall perceptions of palliative care, opioids, and receiving care at home improved significantly among the general public and families, but not among the patients at the community level. However, multiple regression revealed that patients of extensive exposure category had significantly more positive perceptions of palliative care to those of non-exposure category (p = 0.02). The sense of security regarding cancer care of all patients, family members, and the general public improved. Among others, the respondents who reported extensive exposure in the general public and family members scored significantly higher sense of security. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that providing palliative care information via small media and lectures in the community is effective in improving perceptions of palliative care and knowledge about opioids among the community dwellers, especially for caregivers of the patients. The acquisition of adequate knowledge about palliative care from various information sources may improve people’s sense of security regarding cancer.</p>\n\n<p>To determine the most important drivers of successful ageing at extreme old age, we combined community-based prospective cohorts: Tokyo Oldest Old Survey on Total Health (TOOTH), Tokyo Centenarians Study (TCS) and Japanese Semi-Supercentenarians Study (JSS) comprising 1554 individuals including 684 centenarians and (semi-)supercentenarians, 167 pairs of centenarian offspring and spouses, and 536 community-living very old (85 to 99years). We combined z scores from multiple biomarkers to describe haematopoiesis, inflammation, lipid and glucose metabolism, liver function, renal function, and cellular senescence domains. In Cox proportional hazard models, inflammation predicted all-cause mortality with hazard ratios (95% CI) 1.89 (1.21 to 2.95) and 1.36 (1.05 to 1.78) in the very old and (semi-)supercentenarians, respectively. In linear forward stepwise models, inflammation predicted capability (10.8% variance explained) and cognition (8&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;6% variance explained) in (semi-)supercentenarians better than chronologic age or gender. The inflammation score was also lower in centenarian offspring compared to age-matched controls with δ (95% CI)=-0.795 (-1.436 to -0.154). Centenarians and their offspring were able to maintain long telomeres, but telomere length was not a predictor of successful ageing in centenarians and semi-supercentenarians. We conclude that inflammation is an important malleable driver of ageing up to extreme old age in humans.</p>\n\n<p>Purpose: To examine the relation of work type with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in healthy workers. Methods: We cross-sectionally examined 4427 (3605 men and 822 women) healthy workers in Japan, aged 19–69 years. We assessed HRQoL based on scores for five scales of the SF-36. Multiple regression was applied to examine the relation of work type (nighttime, shift, day to night, and daytime) with the five HRQoL norm-based scores, lower scores of which indicate poorer health status, adjusted for confounding factors, including sleeping duration. Results: Shiftwork was inversely related to role physical [regression estimate (β) = −2.12, 95 % confidence intervals (CI) −2.94, −1.30, P &lt; 0.001], general health (β = −1.37, 95 % CI −2.01, −0.72, P &lt; 0.001), role emotional (β = −1.24, 95% CI −1.98, −0.50, P &lt; 0.001), and mental health (β = −1.31, 95% CI −2.01, −0.63, P &lt; 0.001) independent of confounding factors, but not to vitality. Day-to-nighttime work was inversely related to all the five HRQoL subscales (Ps 0.012 to &lt;0.001). Conclusion: Shiftwork was significantly inversely related to four out of the five HRQoL, except for vitality, and day-to-nighttime work was significantly inversely related to all five HRQoL, independent of demographic and lifestyle factors.</p>\n\n<p>Poor oral health and hygiene are increasingly recognized as major risk factors for pneumonia among the elderly. To identify modifiable oral health-related risk factors, we prospectively investigated associations between a constellation of oral health behaviors and incident pneumonia in the community-living very elderly (i.e., 85 years of age or older). At baseline, 524 randomly selected seniors (228 men and 296 women; mean age, 87.8 years) were examined for oral health status and oral hygiene behaviors as well as medical assessment, including blood chemistry analysis, and followed up annually until first hospitalization for or death from pneumonia. During a 3-year follow-up period, 48 events associated with pneumonia (20 deaths and 28 acute hospitalizations) were identified. Among 453 denture wearers, 186 (40.8%) who wore their dentures during sleep were at higher risk for pneumonia than those who removed their dentures at night (log rank P = 0.021). In a multivariate Cox model, both perceived swallowing difficulties and overnight denture wearing were independently associated with an approximately 2.3-fold higher risk of the incidence of pneumonia (for perceived swallowing difficulties, hazard ratio [HR], 2.31; and 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-4.82; and for denture wearing during sleep, HR, 2.38; and 95% CI, 1.25-4.56), which was comparable with the HR attributable to cognitive impairment (HR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.06-4.34), history of stroke (HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.13-5.35), and respiratory disease (HR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.20-4.23). In addition, those who wore dentures during sleep were more likely to have tongue and denture plaque, gum inflammation, positive culture for Candida albicans, and higher levels of circulating interleukin-6 as compared with their counterparts. This study provided empirical evidence that denture wearing during sleep is associated not only with oral inflammatory and microbial burden but also with incident pneumonia, suggesting potential implications of oral hygiene programs for pneumonia prevention in the community.</p>\n\n<p>Purpose To explore the associations between place of death and quality of death and dying and caregiver burden in terminally ill patients with cancer and their families. Methods Two bereavement surveys were conducted in October 2008 and October 2011. A total of 2,247 family caregivers of patients with cancer who were deceased responded to the mail surveys (response rate, 67%). Family members reported patient quality of death and dying and caregiver burden by using the Good Death Inventory and Caregiving Consequences Inventory. Results Patient quality of death and dying was significantly higher at home relative to other places of dying after adjustment for patient and/or family characteristics (adjusted means): 5.0 (95% CI, 4.9 to 5.2) for home, 4.6 (95% CI, 4.5 to 4.7) for palliative care units, and 4.3 (95% CI, 4.2 to 4.4) for hospitals. For all combinations, pairwise P &lt; .001; the size of the difference between home and hospital was moderate (Hedges' g, 0.45). Home was superior to palliative care units or hospitals with respect to \" dying in a favorite place,\" \" good relationships with medical staff,\" \" good relationships with family, \" and \" maintaining hope and pleasure \" ( P &lt; .001 for all combinations of home v palliative care units and home v hospitals). Home death was significantly associated with a lower overall (P = .03) and financial caregiver burden ( P = .004) relative to hospital death. Conclusion Dying at home may contribute to achieving good death in terminally ill patients with cancer without causing remarkably increased caregiver burden. Place of death should be regarded as an essential goal in end-of-life care.</p>\n\n<p>Pemphigus is a group of autoimmune blistering diseases that affect the skin and mucous membranes. A reliable and accurate disease severity tool to assess pemphigus severity is crucial for managing pemphigus and for clinical trials. The purpose of this study was to compare the pemphigus disease area index activity score (PDAI), the Japanese pemphigus disease severity score (JPDSS) and the physician's subjective impression, and also to find appropriate severity grading cut-offs for the PDAI. We also evaluated the correlation between PDAI activity score and the JPDSS. Thirty-seven pemphigus patients and 110 assessments were analyzed in this study. The optimal points of pemphigus disease severity score in PDAI were: mild (0-8), moderate (9-24) and severe (≥25). In mild or moderate cases, the JPDSS was well correlated with the PDAI, but in severe cases the JPDSS reached a plateau at a PDAI score of approximately 30. The PDAI evaluates disease severity more accurately than the JPDSS, particularly in severe cases. The PDAI is not only a useful tool to measure the extent of cutaneous lesions, but also an excellent scoring system for evaluating pemphigus disease severity.</p>\n\n<p>Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the fifth most common cancer type and the third highest cause of cancer death worldwide, develops in different types of liver injuries, and is mostly associated with cirrhosis. However, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease often causes HCC with less fibrosis, and the number of patients with this disease is rapidly increasing. The high mortality rate and the pathological complexity of liver diseases and HCC require blood biomarkers that accurately reflect the state of liver damage and presence of HCC. Methods and Findings: Here we demonstrate that a circulating protein, apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage (AIM) may meet this requirement. A large-scale analysis of healthy individuals across a wide age range revealed a mean blood AIM of 4.99±1.8 μg/ml in men and 6.06±2.1 μg/ml in women. AIM levels were significantly augmented in the younger generation (20s-40s), particularly in women. Interestingly, AIM levels were markedly higher in patients with advanced liver damage, regardless of disease type, and correlated significantly with multiple parameters representing liver function. In mice, AIM levels increased in response to carbon tetrachloride, confirming that the high AIM observed in humans is the result of liver damage. In addition, carbon tetrachloride caused comparable states of liver damage in AIM-deficient and wild-type mice, indicating no influence of AIM levels on liver injury progression. Intriguingly, certain combinations of AIM indexes normalized to liver marker score significantly distinguished HCC patients from non-HCC patients and thus could be applicable for HCC diagnosis. Conclusion: AIM potently reveals both liver damage and HCC. Thus, our results may provide the basis for novel diagnostic strategies for this widespread and fatal disease.</p>\n\n<p>Purpose Obesity contributes to the technical difficulty of rectal surgery and is considered to be a risk factor for postoperative complications. The impact of obesity on the long-term outcomes of rectal cancer surgery remains unclear. Methods A total of 263 consecutive rectal cancer patients who underwent surgery were categorized into two groups according to the body mass index (BMI) based on the Asian BMI classification: non-obese (BMI &lt;25 kg/m2) and obese (BMI ≥25 kg/m2). The postoperative survival and recurrence rates and oncological surgical quality indicators were compared between groups using the univariate and multivariate analyses. The differences in recurrence patterns were assessed by a competing risk regression analysis. Results 64 (24 %) patients were included in the obese group. The number of retrieved lymph nodes was significantly greater in the non-obese group than in the obese group (22.4 vs. 16.0, P &lt; 0.01). The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 86.5 and 68.8 % in the obese and non-obese groups, respectively (P = 0.01). The multivariate analysis demonstrated that obesity significantly decreased the postoperative recurrence rate (P = 0.04). Moreover, the BMI was significantly associated with distant metastasis (P = 0.04). Conclusions Obese rectal cancer patients have high DFS rates and a decreased incidence of distant metastases compared to non-obese patients. The BMI may be a key factor for predicting the postoperative prognosis and determination of an appropriate strategy for the treatment of rectal cancer patients. © 2014 Springer Japan.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between long-term changes in body mass index (BMI) during childhood and adolescent blood-pressure levels in a general Japanese population. We used health report data from 900 Japanese children between 1983 and 2007. After adjusting for baseline BMI and other confounding factors multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship between changes in BMI (ΔBMI) over a 6-year period (6-12 years) and blood pressure once children reached ages 14 or 15. Sub-group analyses were also performed to ascertain the relationship between ΔBMI and blood pressure at 9th grade for children who had been in the bottom BMI tertile at 1st grade. Endpoint blood-pressure levels in boys (systolic and diastolic) and girls (systolic) from the group whose BMIs increased the most were significantly higher than those from the group whose BMIs increased the least (P&lt;0.05, analysis of variance). After adjustment for baseline BMI and school-entrance year, the former group showed higher blood pressure at the endpoint than the latter (P&lt;0.05, multiple regression analysis). Further adjustment for baseline blood pressure also showed similar results in a combined-sex analysis (n=592). Higher ΔBMI was associated with higher SBP 9 even in children whose BMI was in the lowest tertile at baseline after adjustment for sex and school-entrance year (P=0.02, multiple regression analysis). Steeper BMI increases during primary school lead to adolescent increases in blood pressure even if baseline BMI is low. Growth during childhood should be carefully managed. © 2014 The Japanese Society of Hypertension All rights reserved.</p>\n\n<p>Background: Client reminders are known to increase cancer screening attendance rates. However, there are significant costs associated with them, and their effect by population size is unknown. Methods. In 2007 and 2008, the Japanese Government surveyed breast and cervical cancer screening in every municipality in Japan. From the results, we selected all 1,464 municipalities that carried out both screening types. We examined whether changes in screening attendance rates between 2007 and 2008 were associated with client reminders, number of public health nurses per 100,000 population, financial strength index, and 2007 attendance rates for different population sizes. We then calculated cost-effectiveness estimates of client reminders by population size and screening type. Results: Client reminders were associated with increased attendance rates in populations &lt;100,000. For populations of 50,000-100,000, there was a 2.76% increase in breast cancer screening (95% CI: 0.41, 5.11), and a 2.25% increase in cervical cancer screening (95% CI: 0.89, 3.61). The incremental cost per additional attendance was higher in populations &lt;50,000 than in populations of 50,000-100,000 (breast, $100 versus $54; cervical, $149 versus $67 respectively). Conclusions: Client reminders for breast and cervical cancer screening increased attendance rates in smaller municipalities in Japan. © 2014 Komoto et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</p>\n\n<p>Context Improving palliative care is one of the major issues throughout the world. Objectives The primary aim of this study was to explore how and why a regional palliative care program led to changes in a region. Methods As part of a nationwide mixed-methods study of a regional palliative care program, a qualitative study was performed with 101 health care professionals involved in the implementation of the program. In-depth interviews were done, focusing on perceived changes and the perceived reasons for the changes. We used thematic analyses. Results Seven themes were identified as follows: 1) improved communication and cooperation among regional health care professionals; 2) increased confidence in the system to care for cancer patients at home; 3) improved knowledge/skills, practice, and perception of palliative care; 4) contribution to self-growth; 5) wide variability in perceived changes in the knowledge and perception of patients, family members, and the general public; 6) wide variability in the perceived regionwide effects of the project; and 7) unresolved issues. Participants emphasized improved communication and cooperation among regional health care professionals and stated a variety of ways of how communication and cooperation influenced daily practice. The main reasons for changes included regionwide interdisciplinary conferences and informal interactions at a variety of meetings. Conclusion This study advances understanding of how the regional palliative care program created a change in the region. The findings are useful for developing a conceptual framework and identifying key interventions to improve regional palliative care for clinicians, researchers, and policy makers. © 2014 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee.

Methods: We examined the baseline data from 4,427 participants (81.4% male) aged 19 to 69 years old. The physical activity of each participant was classified according to the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). We defined the four MetS-DC in this study as follows: 1) high blood pressure (BP): systolic BP ≥ 130 mmHg, or diastolic BP ≥ 85 mmHg, or the use of antihypertensive drugs; 2) dyslipidemia: high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration &lt;40 mg/dl or triglyceride concentration ≥ 150 mg/dl, or on medication for dyslipidemia; 3) dysglycemia: fasting blood sugar level ≥ 110 mg/dl, or if less than eight hours after meals ≥ 140 mg/dl, or on medication for diabetes mellitus; 4) overweight: a body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2. We defined MetS as overweight plus two or more of the MetS-DC. Results: There were 3,094 subjects in the daytime work group, 73 in the fixed nighttime work group, 1,017 in the shift work group and 243 in the day-to-night work group. The Poisson regression analysis revealed that fixed nighttime (regression coefficient [b] = -0.233, P=0.028) and shift work (b=0.098, P=0.034) independently contributed to the number of MetS-DC, compared to daytime work. The multivariate logistic analysis not including sleep hours in the model showed that shift work was positively related to MetS (odd ratio = 1.47, P&lt;0.01). Conclusion: Shift work were significantly associated with the number of MetS-DC, and was related to risk of MetS compared to daytime work.</p>\n\n<p>Background: Rikkunshito, a standardized Japanese herbal medicine, is thought to accelerate gastric emptying and relieve dyspepsia, although no large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of rikkunshito have been conducted. This study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of rikkunshito for treating functional dyspepsia (FD). Methods: FD patients received 2.5 g rikkunshito or placebo three times a day for 8 weeks in this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. The primary end point was the proportion of responders at 8 weeks after starting test drug, determined by global patient assessment (GPA). The improvement in four major dyspepsia symptoms severity scale was also evaluated. In addition, plasma ghrelin levels were investigated before and after treatment. Key Results: Two hundred forty-seven patients were randomly assigned. In the eighth week, the rikkunshito group had more GPA responders (33.6%) than the placebo (23.8%), although this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.09). Epigastric pain was significantly improved (p = 0.04) and postprandial fullness tended to improve (p = 0.06) in the rikkunshito group at week 8. Rikkunshito was relatively more effective among Helicobacter pylori-infected participants (rikkunshito: 40.0% vs placebo: 20.5%, p = 0.07), and seemed less effective among H. pylori-uninfected participants (rikkunshito: 29.3% vs placebo: 25.6%, p = 0.72). Among H. pylori-positive individuals, acyl ghrelin levels were improved just in rikkunshito group. There were no severe adverse events in both groups. Conclusions &amp; Inferences: Administration of rikkunshito for 8 weeks reduced dyspepsia, particularly symptoms of epigastric pain and postprandial fullness.

All-cause mortality was followed by means of an annual telephone or mailed survey.Results.Age-specific disability patterns revealed that the older the age group, the higher the proportion of those manifesting independence in activities of daily living at any given age of entry. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified male gender and better cognitive function as consistent determinants of physical independence across all age categories. In a longitudinal analysis, better physical function was significantly associated with survival advantage until the age of 110. However, mortality beyond that age was predicted neither by functional status nor biomedical measurements, indicating alternative trajectories of mortality at the highest ages.Conclusions.These findings suggest that maintaining physical independence is a key feature of survival into extreme old age. Future studies illuminating genetic and environmental underpinnings of supercentenarians' phenotypes will provide invaluable opportunities not only to improve preventive strategies but also to test the central hypotheses of human aging. © The Author 2013.</p>\n\n<p>Objectives To examine the association between glycemic levels (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)) and hearing impairment in a general older population. Design Community-based prospective longitudinal cohort study. Setting Kurabuchi Town, Gunma Prefecture, Japan. Participants Residents (N = 831; 350 men, 481 women) aged 65 and older were examined in 2005 and 2006 and analyzed in a cross-sectional study. Residents without hearing impairment at baseline who participated in audiometric re-examinations 4 years later were analyzed (n = 338). Measurements Hearing impairment was defined as failure to hear a 30-dB signal at 1 kHz and a 40-dB signal at 4 kHz in the better ear in pure-tone audiometric tests. Results Mean HbA1c level (National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program) was 5.8 ± 0.8% (40 mmol/mol). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of hearing impairment associated with HbA1c were estimated using a logistic regression model. In the cross-sectional analysis, HbA1c levels were positively associated with hearing impairment (OR per 1.0% increase in HbA1c = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.00-1.68). This association persisted even after excluding 58 participants with a self-reported history of diagnosed diabetes mellitus. Longitudinal analysis revealed the temporality of the discussed association (OR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.03-2.23). Conclusion The present study provides supportive evidence for a causal link between hyperglycemia and age-related hearing loss. © 2014, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2014, The American Geriatrics Society.</p>\n\n<p>Objective: Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) appears to have a protective effect against depression, but evidence from prospective cohort studies is sparse. Therefore, weexamined the associationbetweenserumDHEAS levelsand depressive symptoms in older community-dwelling Japanese. Design: A community-based cohort study. Setting: Kurabuchi Town, Gunma Prefecture, Japan. Participants: A total of 554 residents (248 men and 306 women) age 65 years or older without depressive symptoms at baseline. Measurements: We performed a baseline examination of the subjects between 2005 and 2006 to determine serum DHEAS levels. The subjects were categorized into three groups based on age strata- and sex-specific tertiles of DHEAS. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Geriatric Depression Scale 15-item version (GDS-15) in face-to-face home visit interviews carried out once in 2007 and once in 2008. The association of DHEAS with depressive symptoms (GDS-15 ≥ 6) was analyzed with the use of logistic regression models. Results: The incidence of depressive symptoms was 12.1% in men and 19.6% in women. In men, the multiadjusted odds ratio of depressive symptoms was 0.24 (95% confidence interval: 0.06-0.94, Wald χ2 = 4.20, degrees of freedom = 1, p = 0.04) for the highest tertile compared with the lowest. The association observed for the highest versus the lowest remained significant even after adjustment for physical performance and cognitive function. In women, DHEAS was not associated with depressive symptoms. Conclusions: In this study, higher serum DHEAS levels were found to be protectively and independently associated with the risk of developing depressive symptoms in men, but not in women. © 2013 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.</p>\n\n<p>While hearing aids are recommended for people with age-related hearing loss, many with impaired hearing do not use them. In this study, we investigated how many elderly people in the study area needed hearing aids, and the factors that determined continued wearing of the devices. The study area was Kurabuchi Town, Japan, where 1,437 residents (those aged 65 years or over) were eligible for participation in the study; 1,414 participated, of whom, 103 (7.3%) were already using hearing aids at the start of the study. After the primary screening, hearing aids were lent to 68 participants (4.8%) who did not already have one, 38 of whom (60.3% of the borrowers, representing 2.7% of the total aged population) went on to wear the hearing aid continuously. The Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE) score was significantly elevated among these 38 participants. This study indicated that hearing aids are of potential benefit to many local residents. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that HHIE scores were associated with the extent of HA usage. The adjusted odds ratio for a 1-unit increase in HHIE score was 1.08 (95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.14). Programs like this, in which people with impaired hearing are identified at the local level and given appropriate assistance, are useful models for future use in societies with aging populations. © 2013 Mizutari et al.</p>\n\n<p>Recent advances in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with new agents require accurate histological subtyping at diagnosis to avoid the higher risk of an adverse response and to obtain the maximum therapeutic response. However, interobserver variability, tumor heterogeneity and the degree of differentiation may affect the decision concerning a pathological diagnosis of NSCLC. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify specific microRNAs (miRNAs) as standardized biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity in order to distinguish between squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (AC). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based miRNA array analysis was performed to identify microRNAs differentially expressed between SCC and AC using 86 resected NSCLC samples in addition to adjacent normal tissues. The results were confirmed by independent qRT-PCR assays with the same test samples and 88 additional validation samples, and from this we evaluated the usefulness of the identified miRNAs as biomarkers to distinguish between SCC and AC. Three miRNAs (hsa-miR-196b, hsa-miR-205 and hsa-miR-375) were identified. Discriminant analysis combining the three miRNAs appeared to distinguish SCC from AC accurately in the test and validation samples, demonstrating a sensitivity and specificity of 76 and 80%, and 85 and 83%, respectively. hsa-miR-196b, hsa-miR-205 and hsa-miR-375 were identified as biomarkers capable of distinguishing between lung SCC and lung AC. These newly identified miRNAs may prove to be highly valuable molecular markers for the classification of NSCLC histological subtypes and may contribute to the pathogenesis of each subtype of NSCLC.</p>\n\n<p>Background. Accumulated evidence shows how important spinal posture is for aged populations in maintaining independence in everyday life. However, the cross-sectional designs of most previous studies prevent elucidation of the relationship between spinal posture and future dependence in activities of daily living (ADL). We tried to clarify the association by measuring spinal posture noninvasively in a community-based prospective cohort study of older adults, paying particular attention to thoracic curvature, lumbar curvature, sacral hip angle, and inclination to determine which parameter is most strongly associated with dependence in ADL.Methods. Spinal posture was evaluated in 804 participants (338 men, 466 women, age range: 65-94 years) who were independent in ADL at baseline. We defined dependence in ADL as admission to a nursing home or need of home assistance. During the 4.5-year follow-up period, 126 (15.7%) participants became dependent in ADL. The relationship between the spinal posture parameters and outcome was assessed by dividing the participants into sex-specific quartiles of the parameters.Results. Only inclination (angle subtended between the vertical and a line joining C7 to the sacrum) was associated with outcome, although lumbar curvature also showed a marginal association. The age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio for a 1 unit increase in the quartiles of inclination was 1.79 (confidence interval: 1.44, 2.23). After mutual adjustment for the 4 parameters, statistical significance for inclination still remained, with no substantial changes in the association estimates.Conclusions. This study indicates that spinal inclination is associated with future dependence in ADL among older adults. © 2013 © The Author 2013.

Several studies have investigated whether or not this polymorphism affects weight reduction due to exercise, but the results of these studies have not been consistent. Moreover, information on a population characterized by a wide ranges of physical activities is scarce. Thus, to further understand the impact of this polymorphism, we examined whether the polymorphism modulates the relationship between physical activity due to exercise (PAE) and percentage of body fat (%BF). Methods: The study population was 70 Japanese male young adults with a high prevalence of habitual exercise. PAE was estimated by a questionnaire, and %BF was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Genotyping was done by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Results: The median PAE value of the subjects was 6.9 MET-h/day with an interquartile range of 1.5-10.3 MET-h/day. PAE correlated significantly with %BF in the entire population and within the two subpopulations, namely, carriers or non-carriers of the Arg allele. Multiple regression analysis of PAE, Trp64Arg polymorphism, and the interaction term revealed that while the PAE-derived independent variable was statistically significant, the interaction term was insignificant. When the two regression lines of subjects with and without the Arg allele were considered, the difference between the two slopes did not deviate from zero, nor did the vertical distance of the two regression lines. These findings suggest that the impact of this polymorphism is limited. Conclusions: In our study population of young adult Japanese males, the impact of the Trp64Arg polymorphism on the association between exercise and body composition was weak, if it existed at all. © 2013 The Japanese Society for Hygiene.</p>\n\n<p>Background: In 2009, influenza A (H1N1) infections spread worldwide. Because the use of immunomodulators is associated with an increased risk of infection, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients who are on immunomodulators might be concerned about H1N1 influenza infections. The aim of this study was to investigate the age distribution and risk factors associated with H1N1 influenza of IBD patients in 2009-2010. Methods: A multicenter, prospective study was conducted, and 570 IBD patients were enrolled. Patients were followed up for 10. months to identify any new infections. The incidence and age distribution of the H1N1 influenza infections were analyzed. IBD patients with H1N1 influenza infections and 2 matched, noninfected IBD patients were selected to assess the effect of specifying the medication on the incidence of infections. Results: A total of 38 patients (6.7%) developed H1N1 influenza infections. The incidence of H1N1 influenza infections in patients aged less than 20. years was significantly higher than that among patients in other age groups (p &lt; 0.01). The age distribution for H1N1 influenza infections in IBD patients was comparable to those in the general population. No patients needed hospitalization due to influenza infection. A total of 29 patients (76%) recovered from the H1N1 influenza symptoms within 7. days and 20 patients (53%) received antiviral treatment. The percentage of patients who used steroids or thiopurine was comparable between the cases of H1N1 influenza infection and the control group. Conclusion: Our prospective study showed that younger IBD patients were frequently infected with the influenza A (H1N1) virus as well as general population. Admission and fatal cases due to H1N1 influenza infections were not observed. © 2012 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation.</p>\n\n<p>Background &amp; Aims: There is controversy over the optimal management strategy for patients with branch-duct type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas (BD-IPMNs), precursors to pancreatic cancer. We aimed to identify factors associated with the presence of BD-IPMNs and changes in their diameter. Methods: Two separate analyses were conducted in a cohort of patients who underwent magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in a single year (2006). MRCP findings and clinical outcomes of these patients were followed for a maximum of 6 years. We evaluated initial MRCP findings and demographics associated with the presence of BD-IPMNs at baseline and increase in BD-IPMN diameter over time. Results: During the follow-up period, 154 patients developed BD-IPMN and 322 patients did not. Older age, diabetes mellitus, gallbladder adenomyomatosis, and absence of gallstones were associated with the presence of BD-IPMNs at baseline. Increases in diameter of BD-IPMNs were associated with 3 baseline factors: BD-IPMN diameter greater than 17 mm, gallbladder adenomyomatosis, and a common bile duct diameter less than 5.5 mm. Patients with BD-IPMNs could be stratified into 4 groups with varying risk for the enlargement of BD-IPMNs over time: those with 3 risk factors (hazard ratio [HR], 11.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.4-37.8), 2 risk factors (HR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.7-12.8), or 1 risk factor (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.2-8.2) compared with those without risk factors. Conclusions: For patients with BD-IPMNs, careful follow-up evaluation is particularly important for those with BD-IPMN &gt;17 mm in size, common bile duct diameter &lt;5.5 mm, or gallbladder adenomyomatosis. © 2013 AGA Institute.</p>\n\n<p>Aim: Associations between long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) and increased cardiovascular mortality have been reported, but few studies have investigated the associated incidence of cardiovascular disease, and none involved men. Methods: We used data on 78,057 participants (37,121 men, 40,936 women) to examine the associations of long-term exposure to PM with mortality and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases. Average PM levels in the relevant area during the study period were used as an index of individual exposure to each subject. Cox models adjusted for age, sex, smoking, environmental smoking, body mass index, and alcohol consumption were used, with further adjustments for nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide exposure, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and diabetes mellitus. Results: Increased PM levels were associated with an increased risk of incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and myocardial infarction (MI), particularly among smokers (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM for CHD: 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.93; for MI: 1.52, 1.08-2.13) and among women (for CHD: 1.63, 0.91-2.92; for MI: 1.99, 1.07-3.70); however, the observed positive association of PM exposure with the incidence of CHD and MI was not robust, and the association disappeared when one of the areas (Akita) was excluded. The association with CHD mortality was not statistically significant (adjusted HR per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM: 1.11, 0.92-1.33). There was an inverse association of long-term PM exposure with stroke mortality and incidence. There was no clear association between PM levels and lung cancer mortality and incidence. Conclusions: Long-term exposure to PM might increase the risk of incident CHD in middle-aged Japanese men and women. Our findings also suggest that women and smokers are especially vulnerable to PM exposure.</p>\n\n<p>Background.Oxidative stress is an important factor in the pathology of age-related hearing loss. Recent animal studies have reported that ultraviolet radiation in sunlight is related to systemic induction of oxidative stress. Chronic sun exposure leads to photodamaged skin, which is manifested as facial skin wrinkling and hyperpigmentation. We hypothesized that sunlight exposure, as assessed by the severity of facial skin photodamage, might be associated with hearing impairment through an oxidative stress mechanism. To examine this, we performed a cross-sectional analysis by using the baseline data from a community-based cohort study of older Japanese.Methods.A total of 805 residents (342 men and 463 women) aged 65 years or older living in Kurabuchi Town, Gunma prefecture, Japan, were examined between 2005 and 2006. Facial skin condition was quantified by image analysis of standardized facial images. Hearing impairment was defined as a failure to hear a 30-dB signal at 1 kHz and a 40-dB signal at 4 kHz in the better ear in pure-tone audiometric tests.Results.In men, facial wrinkle was positively associated with hearing impairment (for highest vs lowest: multivariate-adjusted odds ratio, 2.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-4.66; p for trend =. 01). Stratified analysis by age, educational level, smoking status, sunscreen or foundation use, and diabetes showed results similar to those for men as a whole. This association was particularly pronounced in men with the low levels of antioxidants and without occupational noise exposure. We observed no apparent association in women.Conclusions.The results support the hypothesis that chronic sun exposure is a risk factor of hearing impairment. © 2012 The Author.</p>\n\n<p>We reviewed the difference in data between the inhalation and intratracheal instillation studies of inhaled materials and how to diminish the difference in data between the two studies in order to examine the usefulness of intratracheal instillation study for the estimation of the harmful effects of manufactured nanomaterials. The differences in the data of the intratracheal instillation study from those of the inhalation study, which is the gold standard, are as follows: 1) artificial effect of the bolus, 2) nonuniformity of lung distribution of materials, 3) no threshold of clearance, 4) low deposition level of materials in the brain and neonates, and 5) the effect of dispersant on the lung. We consider that the approaches to diminishing the difference in data between the two studies are as follows: 1) maintain the dispersion of nanomaterials, 2) avoid the overdosing of nanomaterials, and 3) maintain a low concentration of the dispersant in the intratracheal instillation study.</p>\n\n<p>OBJECTIVE: Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) appears to have a protective effect against depression, but evidence from prospective cohort studies is sparse.

The association observed for the highest versus the lowest remained significant even after adjustment for physical performance and cognitive function. In women, DHEAS was not associated with depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, higher serum DHEAS levels were found to be protectively and independently associated with the risk of developing depressive symptoms in men, but not in women.</p>\n\n<p>Background Although the prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is reported to have reached a plateau in Western countries, it is increasing in Asia. The etiology of IBD is still under investigation. We performed an epidemiological study to clarify the characteristics of IBD in Japan, focusing on patients' family history. Methods We obtained clinical data on ulcerative colitis (UC) (46,114 cases) and Crohn's disease (CD) (11,305 cases) in 2007 from an electronic database maintained under the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfarés nationwide registry system, and analyzed the differences in disease characteristics between patients with IBD who had a family history of the disease and those who did not. Results A total of 2.7% of the patients with UC and 2.6% of those with CD had a family history. The present age and age at disease onset were lower among the patients with UC who had a family history than among those without (present age: p0.001; age at disease onset: p0.001; Mann-Whitney U-test), but no similar trend was observed in the patients with CD. Disease severity was worse among both the UC and CD patients with a family history. The clinical course of patients with UC was not affected by family history. Levels of independence in daily life were associated with family history among CD patients, whereas age was associated with levels of independence in daily life among UC patients. Conclusion Disease characteristics of IBD vary in some aspects according to the presence or absence of a family history. © 2012 Springer.</p>\n\n<p>Objectives To investigate whether self-reported hearing loss in older adults is associated with a decline in their ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) or a decline in social participation. Design Prospective follow-up. Setting Community. Participants One thousand two hundred fifty-four adults aged 65 to 98. Measurements Self-reported hearing loss, IADL, and social participation were evaluated through home-visit surveys. Self-reported hearing loss was measured according to responses to the question, \"Do you have difficulty hearing and understanding what a person says to you in a quiet room if they speak normally to you, even when wearing your hearing aid?\" Levels of IADL and social participation were measured using the subscales of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology Index of Competence (TMIG-IC). Results Of the 921 participants with a perfect baseline IADL score and valid follow-up scores, 105 also self-reported hearing loss at baseline. Of this group, 44.8% (total n = 105) reported a decline in their IADL score over the 3-year follow-up period. After adjusting for major confounders, a statistically significant difference in experiencing an IADL decline over the 3-year period was found between those with hearing loss at baseline and those without (odds ratio (OR) = 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.12-2.87). Self-reported hearing loss at baseline did not have a statistically significant effect on decline in social participation (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.63-1.76) over the 3-year follow-up period. Conclusion Self-reported hearing loss was associated with a decline in IADL, but not with social participation. © 2012, The American Geriatrics Society.</p>\n\n<p>Purpose Patients' knowledge, beliefs, or concerns about opioids, palliative care, and homecare can be potential barriers to providing quality palliative care. The primary aim of this study was to clarify knowledge about opioids, beliefs about palliative care, and concerns about homecare in advanced cancer patients. Methods An anonymous questionnaire was sent to 1,619 outpatients with advanced cancer at 25 hospitals in four different regions of Japan. The respondents were asked to report their knowledge about opioids, beliefs about palliative care, and concerns about homecare, in addition to the levels of their sense of security regarding receiving cancer care in the region. Results A total of 925 responses were received. In total, 28% believed that opioids are addictive and/or shorten life; 52% believed that palliative care is only for terminally ill patients; 75% agreed that being taken care of at home puts a heavy burden on the family; and 61% agreed that homevisit services cannot respond to sudden changes in a patient's condition. Levels of patients' sense of security were significantly higher in those who agreed that \"opioids can relieve most pain caused by cancer\" \"palliative care relieves pain and distress\", \"palliative care is provided along with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy\", and \"pain can be alleviated as effectively through home-visit services as it can at the hospital\", and those who disagreed with the statements that \"home-visit services cannot respond to sudden changes in a patient's condition\" and \"being taken care of at home puts a burden on the family\". Conclusions Advanced cancer patients frequently had incorrect knowledge about opioids, a belief that palliative care is only for terminally ill patients, and concerns about homecare, especially the family burden and responses to sudden changes. Providing appropriate information about the safety of opioids, the availability of palliative care during the entire course of the disease, and realistic information about homecare is of marked importance to promote patients' sense of security. © Springer-Verlag 2011.</p>\n\n<p>Background Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a heterogeneous disease, and categorized into postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS). However, many FD patients have overlap of both PDS and EPS. The present study was designed to examine whether FD could be categorized based on the presence of concomitant gastrointestinal symptoms. Methods A web survey comprised of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), Rome III criteria of FD, and demographic information was sent to public participants who have no history of severe illness. Factor and cluster analyses were conducted to identify sub-categories of FD based on GSRS. Key Results A total of 8038 participants completed the survey. A total of 563 participants met the criteria for FD, whereas 6635 participants did not have dyspepsia symptoms. The remainder had either organic disease (377) or uninvestigated dyspepsia (463). The cluster analysis categorized participants as constipation predominant (cluster C), diarrhea predominant (cluster D), or having neither diarrhea nor constipation (cluster nCnD). Cluster C and D were significantly associated with the presence of FD [odds ratio (OR) 2.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.06-3.21; OR 2.80; 95% CI 2.27-3.45, respectively]. In FD, especially in PDS cases, the scores of upper gastrointestinal symptoms were higher in cluster C or D than in cluster nCnD. Conclusions &amp; Inferences The severity of dyspepsia symptoms is associated with the presence of bowel symptoms especially in PDS. This novel categorization of FD based on concomitant constipation or diarrhea may improve classification of patients. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</p>\n\n<p>The Evaluation System of Investigational Medical Care (ESIMeC) is a new clinical trial system that Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare authorizes the coverage of medical expenses by Japanese health insurance system for the patients participating in the approved clinical trials with high quality control mechanism. This system became effective in 2008. The Kitasato University Clinical Trials Coordinating Center has supported two randomized, phase III trials being conducted under ESIMeC since 2009. One trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy of Carboplatin for ovarian cancer patients ; another trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new anticancer agent Bevacizumab for recurrent ovarian cancer patients. Carboplatin is approved for ovarian cancer by intravenous administration, but not for IP administration. Bevacizumab is not approved for ovarian cancer. However, the indication-directed trial has been completed for the first line chemotherapy for ovarian cancer, but not for the recurrent setting. In this article, we discuss the issues that need to be improved in the future, as well as the importance of the clinical trial coordinating center, so that ESIMeC will work better to accelerate investigator-initiated clinical trials evaluating new agents/medical techniques with no indication approval in Japan. Critical issues in cancer clinical trial coordination under ESIMeC include being familiar with the system itself, development of the clinical trial team, support of the application process for ESIMeC, establishment of serious adverse event reporting procedures, management of the study agents, and cost-effective study monitoring.</p>\n\n<p>Objectives To elucidate the independent relationship between masticatory and physical performance in community-living oldest old people (mean age ± standard deviation 87.8 ± 2.2, range 85-102). Design Cross-sectional analysis. Setting University research center or home-based examination. Participants Four hundred eighty-nine community-living individuals (219 men, 270 women) aged 85 and older. Measurements Maximum occlusal force (MOF) was measured using an occlusal force measuring device. Sociodemographic and functional factors, oral health, comorbidities, blood chemistry, lower extremity performance, and handgrip strength were assessed. Blood chemistry analyses included serum albumin, C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-6, and total and free testosterone. Results MOF was significantly associated with age, body mass index, and cognitive impairment in men but not in women. Comorbidities and blood chemistry were not associated with MOF except for a significant association with IL-6 concentration in women. In a multivariate model adjusted for various confounders, lower MOF was associated with greater risk for poor performance on the timed up and go (TUG) test in men and women (men: odds ratio (OR)=2.34, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.02-5.38; women: OR=2.44, 95% CI=1.12-5.33). MOF was similarly associated with performance in chair standing, one-leg standing, and handgrip strength only in men. These associations remained after adjustment for number of natural teeth. Conclusion MOF was strongly and independently associated with all measures of physical performance in men and with the TUG test in women after adjustment for various confounders, suggesting that age-related declines in masticatory and skeletal muscle functions share common mechanistic pathways in older age, particularly in men. © 2011, The American Geriatrics Society.</p>\n\n<p>Objective: To estimate the prevalence and risk factors of dry eye disease (DED) in a rural setting in Japan. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: We included 3294 subjects, aged &lt;40 years who were in the residential registry for Koumi town. Intervention: Subjects in a rural mountain area, Koumi town, completed questionnaires designed to detect dry eye diagnosis and risk factors. Main Outcome Measures: Clinically diagnosed DED was defined as the presence of a previous clinical diagnosis of DED by ophthalmologists or severe symptoms of DED (both dryness and irritation constantly or often). Current symptoms of DED and possible risk factors such as age, gender, educational history, smoking history, alcohol drinking history, height and weight, visual display terminal (VDT) use, and contact lens (CL) wear, and past/current history of certain common systemic diseases were the main outcome measures. We used logistic regression analysis to examine associations between DED and other demographic factors. Results: Of the 3294 eligible residents, 2791 residents (85%) completed the questionnaire. The percentage of women with a composite outcome of clinically diagnosed DED or severe symptoms (21.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 19.523.9) was higher than that of men (12.5%; 95% CI, 10.714.5; P&lt;0.001). A low body mass index (BMI; odds ratio [OR], 2.07; 95% CI, 0.984.39), CL use (OR, 3.84; 95% CI, 1.4610.10), and hypertension (HT) (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.942.06) were risk factors for DED in men. Use of a VDT (OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.124.85), CL use (OR, 3.61; 95% CI, 2.136.10), and myocardial infarction or angina were the risk factors (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.514.62), whereas high BMI was a preventive factor (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.481.01) for DED in women. Conclusions: Among a Japanese cohort, DED leading to a clinical diagnosis or severe symptoms is prevalent. Use of CLs was a common dry eye risk factor in both genders. The condition is more prevalent in men with low BMI, HT, and in women with myocardial infarction or angina and VDT use. Relevant measures directed against the modifiable risks may provide a positive impact on public health and quality of life of Japanese. © 2011 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.</p>\n\n<p>Background and objective. Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) can interfere with rehabilitation processes and lead to poor functional outcome. The purpose of this study was to determine whether prism adaptation (PA) therapy improves USN and functional outcomes in stroke patients in the subacute stage. Methods. A multicenter, double-masked, randomized, controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of a 2-week PA therapy on USN assessed with the Behavioral Inattention Test (BIT), the Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS), and activities of daily living (ADL) as evaluated with the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). A total of 38 USN patients with right-brain damage were divided into prism (n = 20) and control (n = 18) groups. Patients were divided into mild and severe USN groups according to BIT behavioral test (mild 55 and severe&lt;55). The prism group performed repetitive pointing with prism glasses that induce rightward optical shift twice daily, 5 days per week, for 2 weeks, whereas the control group performed similar pointing training with neutral glasses. Results. The FIM improved significantly more in the prism group. In mild USN patients, there was significantly greater improvement of BIT and FIM in the prism group. Conclusions. PA therapy can significantly improve ADL in patients with subacute stroke. © 2011 American Society of Neurorehabilitation.</p>\n\n<p>Aims/Introduction: To examine the cross-sectional relationship between sleep duration and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), including diabetes mellitus (DM), we analyzed a large-scale healthy workers database in Japan. Materials and Methods: We examined the baseline database of 4143 participants (3415 men and 728 women) aged 19-69years. Sleep duration of participants was categorized into four groups: &lt;6, 6 to &lt;7, 7 to &lt;8 and ≥8h. The physical activity of each participant was classified according to the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). We defined IGT including DM (IGT/DM) in the present study according to previous studies as follows: fasting blood sugar level ≥110mg/dL, or if &lt;8h after meals ≥140mg/dL, or on medication for diabetes mellitus, or those diagnosed as having DM. Logistic regression was applied to estimate the odds ratio (OR) to examine the relationship between IGT/DM, sleep duration and other related factors. Results: The number of participants with IGT/DM was 402 (9.7%). The factors that significantly associated with IGT/DM were age (OR 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.10, P&lt;0.001), high blood pressure (OR 1.94, CI 1.52-2.47, P&lt;0.001), and &lt;6h of sleep duration in comparison with 6 to &lt;7h sleep (OR 2.32, CI 1.18-4.55, P=0.015). The associations of difficulty in sleep initiation, IPAQ classification, current smoking and alcohol intake with IGT/DM were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Our results showed that shorter sleep duration (&lt;6h of sleep duration per night) was associated with a risk of IGT/DM independent of other lifestyle habits and metabolic risk factors. © 2011 Asian Association for the Study of Diabetes and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.</p>\n\n<p>Studies have associated hearing impairment with adverse health outcomes, but the actual impact of hearing difficulty has been barely investigated. We investigated among older adults (i) the prevalence of hearing difficulty, (ii) the association of hearing difficulty with a composite outcome of dependence in activities of daily living (ADL) and death, and (iii) the population attributable risk fraction (PAF) of hearing difficulty. In 2005, a home-visit survey of 1364 Japanese older adults aged ≥65 (participation proportion = 95.5%) was conducted to evaluate self-reports of hearing difficulty. Over 3 years, 99.4% of the initial sample was followed. Outcomes were measured by incidence of death or dependence in ADL. In the sample, the prevalence of hearing difficulty was 17.7% (age ≥65) and 25.7% (age ≥75). Hearing difficulty at high levels was associated with a composite outcome of dependence in ADL and mortality (adjusted odds ratio = OR and 95% confidence interval = 95% CI = 6.19 (1.92-19.92)) as well as with each outcome independently. Improving the hearing difficulty from high to moderate or no difficulty would reduce the composite outcome in 4.3% (age ≥65) and in 6.3% (age ≥75) of the target population. In conclusion, hearing difficulty was common, was associated with and had substantial impact on adverse health outcomes. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.</p>\n\n<p>Background: Barrett's esophagus has been divided into three categories based on the extent of the metaplasia: long-segment (LSBE), short-segment (SSBE), and ultrashort-segment Barrett's esophagus (USBE). While both LSBE and SSBE are thought to be induced by gastroesophageal reflux, the etiology of USBE is still unclear. Methods: We conducted a case-control study to identify the differences in the pathogenesis between SSBE and USBE in a hospital-based population. The endoscopic findings and clinical factors of 199 patients with short-segment endoscopically suspected esophageal metaplasia (SS-ESEM) and 317 patients with ultrashort-segment ESEM (US-ESEM) were compared with those of 199 and 317 age- and gender-matched patients without ESEM. Results: The severity of gastric mucosal atrophy was marginally associated with the presence of US-ESEM [odds ratio (OR) 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-1.46, p = 0.08], but not with that of SS-ESEM. On the other hand, the presence of gallstones and that of severe reflux esophagitis were associated with the presence of SS-ESEM (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.21-3.98; OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.08-2.75), but not with that of US-ESEM. Presence of gastric corpus atrophy without gallstones was associated with the presence of US-ESEM, but not with that of SS-ESEM. Conclusions: Presence of gastric corpus atrophy was associated with an increased likelihood of the presence of US-ESEM, whereas the presence of gallstones was associated with an increased likelihood of the presence of SS-ESEM, suggesting difference in etiology between US- and SS-ESEM. © 2010 Springer.</p>\n\n<p>Background: In older adults, kyphosis (slouching posture) can lead to underestimation of height, which may in turn lead to overestimation of body mass index (BMI). We investigated the extent to which inaccurate BMI assessments led to misclassification of elderly people as normal weight (when they were actually underweight) or overweight (actually normal weight). Methods: Anthropometric measurements were taken in 2005 and 2006 for 842 residents aged 65 years or older (women: 491; men: 351). We calculated BMI from measured height and weight (observed BMI) and then predicted BMI from height as determined by demi-span, which is unaffected by kyphosis (predicted BMI). Kyphosis was assessed by the number of blocks placed under the occiput required for the supine participant to achieve a neutral head position. Participants were classified as underweight (BMI &lt; 18.5), normal weight, or overweight (BMI ≥ 25.0) according to both observed and predicted BMI; classification accordance was investigated by cross-tabulation. Results. Kyphosis was present in 17.2% of the participants overall and in 23.6% of those aged 75 years or older. Predicted BMI measurements showed that 11 % of participants with kyphosis requiring ≥ 3 blocks were misclassified as normal weight and that 10% were erroneously classified as overweight. In those aged 75 years or older, the corresponding figures were 15% and 12%. Conclusions. Our results suggest that inaccurate BMIs due to kyphosis lead to substantial numbers of older adults being misclassified as normal weight or overweight, which can cause significant distortions in data on the impact of underweight and overweight on health outcomes. © The Author 2011.

To set a permissible exposure standard, an exposure-response relationship should be elucidated. Thus, epidemiologic evidence in relation to long-term, low-level exposure to environmental chemicals (i.e., lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, PM(2.5), carbon disulfide) was reviewed. As a result, there exists a clear exposure-response relationship between exposure to lead or PM(2.5) and cardiovascular diseases, but those cohort studies were carried out in the US only. From epidemiologic viewpoint, \"consistency\" of the observed relationship must be clarified, especially findings of a study in the Japanese population. It is well known that the distribution pattern of cardiovascular risk factors are quite different between two countries, which could modify the true relationship. This will require studies of large samples from the general Japanese population with control for potential confouders. Moreover, to detect a small effect of exposure within low-level range, random misclassification of exposure as well as that of effect must be minimized. Thus, for studies of heavy metals, sensitive biomarkers identified in toxicological studies would be applied. For PM(2.5), a wide range of population samples should be covered by a national sampling network in the near future. Finally, the integration of epidemiologic and toxicological evidence would be more important for risk assessment of environmental chemicals at low exposure levels, because an exposure-response relationship from only epidemiologic observation may be unstable with a wide confidence interval around the threshold.</p>\n\n<p>Colorectal cancer is one of the complications of ulcerative colitis (UC) and the risk of cancer increases as the duration of the disease becomes longer. Surveillance colonoscopy has been considered to be important for the early detection and early treatment of colorectal cancer, especially in longstanding UC. Because it is not always easy to detect neoplastic lesions in UC endoscopically, guidelines recommend the use of step biopsy in surveillance, in which either 4 biopsy specimens for every 10 cm or a total of 33 or more biopsy specimens are obtained. However, it has been pointed out that a step biopsy obtaining several tens of biopsy specimens may not be an ideal method in terms of invasiveness to the patient or medical cost. Instead of step biopsy, recent studies report the usefulness of target biopsy, in which biopsy tissues are obtained only from regions suspected of neoplasia. Therefore, the Research Group for Intractable Inflammatory Bowel Disease of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan has initiated a randomized controlled study to compare the efficacy of step biopsy and target biopsy. The present article gives an introduction to this ongoing randomized controlled trial in Japan. © 2010 Springer.</p>\n\n<p>Objective: To evaluate exercise intervention efficacy for the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia in the elderly. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search of randomized controlled trials in the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Report (before 2007), Pubmed, the Cochrane database, and Igaku Chuo Zasshi (January 2006 to August 2009) Data Extraction: Two authors independently extracted relevant data. A total of 951 articles were found by search engines, and 9 studies were finally selected after a review by 2 experts. The content of these studies, especially duration, sets, periods, frequency, and intensity of exercise intervention were extracted and summarized in a results table. Five of 6 articles concluded that high-intensity resistance training significantly increased soft lean tissue and muscle mass. The remaining 3 articles indicated that moderate-intensity resistance training did not affect soft lean tissue or muscle mass. Conclusion: This systematic review suggested that high-intensity resistance training with sufficient periods, frequency, repetitions, and sets is effective to counteract the loss of muscle mass associated with advancing age.</p>\n\n<p>Background: Prevalence of men with cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRF) is increasing in Japan. Few studies have comprehensively examined the relation between lifestyles and CMRF. Methods. We examined the baseline data from 3,498 male workers ages 19 to 69 years who participated in the high-risk and population strategy for occupational health promotion (HIPOP-OHP) study at 12 large-scale companies throughout Japan. The physical activity of each participant was classified according to the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Dietary intake was surveyed by a semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire. We defined four CMRF in this study as follows: 1) high blood pressure (BP): systolic BP 130 mmHg, or diastolic BP ≥85 mmHg, or the use of antihypertensive drugs; 2) dyslipidemia: high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration &lt; 40 mg/dl, or triglycerides concentration ≥150 mg/dl, or on medication for dyslipidemia; 3) impaired glucose tolerance: fasting blood sugar concentration ≥110 mg/dl; 4) obese: a body mass index ≥25 kg/m 2. Results: Those who had 0 to 4 CMRF accounted for 1,597 (45.7%), 1,032 (29.5%), 587 (16.8%), 236 (6.7%), and 44 (1.3%) participants, respectively, in the Poisson distribution. Poisson regression analysis revealed that independent factors that contributed to the number of CMRF were age (b = 0.020, P &lt; 0.01), IPAQ (b = -0.091, P &lt; 0.01), alcohol intake (ml/day) (b = 0.001, P = 0.03), percentage of protein intake (b = 0.059, P = 0.01), and total energy intake (kcal)(b = 0.0001, P &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, alcohol intake and its frequency had differential effects. Conclusions: Alcohol intake, percent protein and total energy intake were positively associated, whereas drinking frequency and IPAQ were inversely associated, with the number of CMRF. © 2011 Katano et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</p>\n\n<p>Background: Metabolic syndrome (MS) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, its prevalence in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients remains largely unknown. This study was planned to determine the prevalence of MS in Japanese IBD patients. Methods: The prevalence of MS among outpatients with IBD aged 18 or older was studied using the modified National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III definition. Results: A total of 107 quiescent IBD patients, including 76 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and 31 Crohn's disease (CD) patients, were studied. Sufficient data were collected from a total of 102 patients. Prevalence of MS was significantly higher in UC (23.0%) patients compared to CD patients (7.1%). MS prevalence was substantially higher among male IBD patients (21.1%) compared to female IBD patients (12.9%), particularly in patients over 30 years of age. No difference was observed in the prevalence of MS between our IBD cohort and the general population in both males and females aged 40 years and older (P = 0.707 in males, P = 0.328 in females). IBD patients with MS were also older than those without (50.2 ± 15.0 vs. 38.0 ± 11.9 years, P = 0.013). In a logistic regression analysis, age was the statistically significant predictor of MS among IBD patients. The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) was 1.064 (1.017-1.114). Conclusions: Prevalence of metabolic syndrome in our IBD patients was comparable to that of the general population. Because age was the independent risk factor for developing MS, evaluation for MS is needed for elderly IBD patients. © 2010 Springer.</p>\n\n<p>Objective: We analyzed the database of the Japanese nationwide inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) registry, which was started in 1975, to characterize basic epidemiological and clinical features of childhood IBD, comparing them to those in adults. Study design: We analyzed the age of disease onset, disease severity and anatomical distribution in patients that were newly registered between 2003 and 2006 (n = 2,940 for CD and 14,857 for UC). We also analyzed the current age, gender and family history of IBD of all patients filed in 2005, which included patients who were newly registered in 2005 and those who had been registered before 2005 and for whom an annual report had been received in 2005 (total number of subjects: 10,934 for CD and 37,846 for UC). Results: At the time of registration, 10.6% of CD and 5.9% of UC patients were ≤16 years old. In CD, the male to female ratio was 2.6 in adult- and 1.7 in childhood-onset patients (P &lt; 0.001). In UC, the male to female ratio was close to 1 in both age groups. In comparison with adults, pediatric patients more commonly had a positive family history for CD and UC (P &lt; 0.001), tended to have more severe disease at the time of registry (P &lt; 0.001 for CD, P &lt; 0.05 for UC) and more often had extensive colitis in UC (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: The nationwide registry in Japan showed IBD in children has clinical features that are distinct from those in adults. © 2010 Springer.</p>\n\n<p>Aim: To examine the relation between lifestyle and the number of metabolic syndrome (MetS) diagnostic components in a general population, and to find a means of preventing the development of MetS components. Methods: We examined baseline data from 3,365 participants (2,714 men and 651 women) aged 19 to 69 years who underwent a physical examination, lifestyle survey, and blood chemical examination. The physical activity of each participant was classified according to the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). We defined four components for MetS in this study as follows: 1) high BP: systolic BP ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥85 mmHg, or the use of antihypertensive drugs; 2) dyslipidemia: high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration &lt;40 mg/dL, triglycerides concentration ≥150 mg/dL, or on medication for dyslipidemia; 3) Impaired glucose tolerance: fasting blood sugar level ≥110 mg/d, or if less than 8 hours after meals ≥140 mg/dL), or on medication for diabetes mellitus; 4) obesity: body mass index ≥25 kg/m2. Results: Those who had 0 to 4 MetS diagnostic components accounted for 1,726, 949, 484, 190, and 16 participants, respectively, in the Poisson distribution. Poisson regression analysis revealed that independent factors contributing to the number of MetS diagnostic components were being male (regression coefficient b = 0.600, p&lt;0.01), age (b = 0.027, p&lt;0.01), IPAQ class (b = -0.272, p = 0.03), and alcohol consumption (b = 0.020, p = 0.01). The contribution of current smoking was not statistically significant (b = -0.067, p = 0.76). Conclusion: Moderate physical activity was inversely associated with the number of MetS diagnostic components, whereas smoking was not associated.</p>\n\n<p>Background and aims: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who want to have children are anxious to receive medical treatment. The consensus regarding pregnancy has not been surveyed for male IBD patients. The present study was investigated opinions among male IBD patients about pregnancy, conception and neonatal outcomes for partners. Methods: Subjects comprised 364 of 386 patients enrolled (94.3%). Subjects received a questionnaire regarding their opinions and thoughts about pregnancy. The course of partner's conceptions and presence of neonatal malformations was also surveyed. Results: The rate of live births for partners of male IBD patients was 91.6% (219/239). Most patients with CD (29/33; 88%) had their children after surgery had been performed. The rate of expressing hopes to have a child tended to be higher for patients with UC (93/128; 73%) than for patients with CD (61/97; 63%; p = 0.21). Furthermore, the rate of hesitation was significantly higher in CD patients (34/107; 32%) than in UC patients (38/188; 20%; p = 0.03).Patients considered that safety of medication (51%) and maintenance of remission (41%) was more important than receiving no treatment for IBD (19%) when planning to conceive. Mesalamine and infliximab were more favorable at conception than sulfasalazine and immunomodulators. Conclusions: This is the first report to survey the thinking of male IBD patients regarding pregnancy. Most male IBD patients considered \"maintaining remission\" as important at conception. Our study provides important information for IBD patients and for the treating physician when planning to conceive. © 2009 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation.</p>\n\n<p>Purpose: Bile and acid exposures are thought to be major risk factors for Barrett's esophagus in Western countries. The association of gallstones with Barrett's esophagus has not been fully evaluated. The present study was designed as a case-control study for determining the possible factors associated with endoscopically suspected esophageal metaplasia (ESEM), defined as an endoscopic finding suggestive of Barrett's esophagus, in Japanese patients. Methods: A total of 528 patients with ESEM were allocated to the case group, while 528 age- and gender-matched patients without ESEM were allocated to the control group. Findings on esophagogastroduodenoscopy and clinical background factors were compared using a multivariate logistic regression model. Results: The presence of gallstones and hiatus hernia and the severity of gastric mucosal atrophy were independently associated with the presence of ESEM [odds ratio (OR) 1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-2.69; OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.75-4.33; OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.01-5.6, respectively]. Compared with subjects with neither gastric corpus atrophy nor gallstones, although subjects with gallstones alone were not associated with the presence of ESEM (OR 1.59, 95% CI 0.87-2.92), having both gastric corpus atrophy and gallstones was strongly associated with the presence of ESEM (OR 2.94, 95% CI 1.40-6.17). Conclusions: The presence of gallstones was independently associated with the presence of ESEM in the Japanese outpatient population, suggesting a causal association of distal esophageal bile exposure with the development of ESEM. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings in cases with histologically confirmed Barrett's esophagus. © 2009 Springer.</p>\n\n<p>BACKGROUND: Mt. Oyama on Miyakejima Island erupted in June 2000 and all Miyake village citizens were forced to evacuate the island in the September, due to continuous eruptions and emission of unsafe amounts of volcanic gas, mainly sulfur dioxide (SO2). Beginning in February 2005, residents returned to live on the island despite the fact that volcanic gas was still being emitted. OBJECTIVE: To examine changes in the respiratory systems of included children from February 2006 to November 2006. METHODS: The study population was 141 children who participated in health checkups in November 2006, including 33 SO2 hypersusceptible children who had a current or past history of asthma, obstructive lung function, current symptoms of whistling and wheezing, and/or deterioration of respiratory symptoms. Respiratory effects were evaluated by a questionnaire for respiratory symptoms and by spirometry. SO2 was monitored at 7 sampling points within inhabited areas, and the mean SO2 concentration from February 2005 to November 2006 was 0.031 ppm. The area was categorized into four areas by average SO2 concentration, namely, areas L, H-1, H-2, and H-3, where the average SO2 levels were 0.019, 0.026, 0.032, and 0.045 ppm, respectively. RESULTS: Compared to children in area L, the frequencies of \"phlegm\" and \"irritation of the nose\" were significantly greater in the children in areas H-2 and H-3. %FVC and %FEV1 in hypersusceptible children were significantly reduced in November 2006 as compared to February 2006 (P = 0.047, 0.027), though no reduction observed in normosusceptible children. CONCLUSION: Respiratory functions in hypersusceptible Miyakejima children may be affected by SO2 exposure, and further follow-up observation is necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Aim: Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) is known to correlate well with alcohol consumption; however, the relation between GGT and diabetes and that between alcohol consumption and diabetes mellitus (DM) is inconsistent. Thus, several questions, such as whether light to moderate drinkers can be considered as low risk for diabetes incidence irrespective of their GGT level, is unresolved. In this study, we investigated the relation of GGT or alcohol drinking with DM incidence considering the body mass index (BMI) in healthy Japanese workers. Methods: We followed 3095 men who did not have DM at baseline for 4 years. Incident diabetes was defined as a fasting (non-fasting) plasma glucose level of ≥7.0 (11.1) mmol/L, or treatment of diabetes. Multiple adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using Cox proportional models. Results: Participants with higher GGT (GGT ≥27 IU/L) showed an increased risk of diabetes incidence even when their BMI level was low. Although a U-shaped relation between alcohol drinking and incident diabetes was observed, the risk to light to moderate drinkers (alcohol &lt;23 g/day) was not low if they were either overweight (BMI ≥25 kg/m2) or had higher GGT (HR= 2.60, p= 0.08) or both overweight and higher GGT (HR= 3.16, p= 0.07) compared with never drinkers without higher GGT and overweight. Conclusions: Higher GGT was associated with a higher incidence of DM irrespective of drinking status or obesity. Although a U-shaped relation between alcohol drinking and incident diabetes was observed, the risk to light to moderate drinkers was not low if they were either overweight or had higher GGT.</p>\n\n<p>Background: The prevalence of tinnitus is reported to be high in older Western populations, and several risk factors have been suggested. However, community-based evidence on prevalence is limited and, to our knowledge, there is no such information from older non-Western populations. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and factors associated with tinnitus in community-dwelling Japanese elders. Methods: In this community-based cross-sectional study, 1320 residents of Kurabuchi Town aged 65 years or older (584 men and 736 women; participation proportion = 98.7%) were interviewed at home in 2006, and information on tinnitus and factors associated with tinnitus was collected. We estimated the prevalence of tinnitus by age group and sex and used a logistic regression model to investigate associated factors. Results: The prevalence of tinnitus was 18.6% (men: 18.0%; women: 19.0%); there were no statistically significant differences by age group or sex.

Conclusions: These findings suggest that tinnitus is common in Japanese aged over 65 years. Because the factors associated with tinnitus in this cross-sectional study are potentially modifiable, they should be thoroughly investigated in a longitudinal study. © 2010 by the Japan Epidemiological Association.</p>\n\n<p>Objectives: We evaluated the association of nutrient intake with Fe deficiency with regard to lifestyle factors and health condition in young Japanese women. Uniquely among developed countries, dietary habits render Japanese populations vulnerable to Fe deficiency, owing to their relatively low intake of Fe and high intake of Fe absorption inhibitors, such as green tea and soyabeans. Design: A cross-sectional study. Setting and subjects: The subjects were 1019 female Japanese dietetic students aged 18-25 years. Dietary habits during the preceding month were assessed using a previously validated, self-administered, diet history questionnaire. Blood analysis was performed to assess body Fe status. Subjects w"
