Telefon Tel Aviv is an ambient duo from the US. Here is an excerpt from an interview they gave Joel Bordeaux:

JB:

Is there any significance of the name "Telefon Tel Aviv," other than the consonance?

Charles:

Just the poetic quality. We wanted it to be something to invoke imagery. I don’t think we need a meaning. But we were invited to go play in outside Tel Aviv, in the desert. It looked like The Last Temptation of Christ, which was really cool.

JB:

Did you do it?

Josh:

No. We got kind of scared, what with the suicide bombers and all that. We didn’t think two American Catholic boys would fare well over there with both sides trying to put an end to it. I’d probably the only person in the entire Middle East with dreadlocks.

How charming when "Tel Aviv" becomes just an exotic word, like "Tokyo", "Singapore" or "California". Then you remember that "Beirut" and "Sudan" are also just exotic words to most people.
