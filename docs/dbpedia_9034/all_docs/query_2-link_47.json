        "text": "Located across from a sandy beach with the warm, clear waters of the Mediterranean Sea, the Dan Panorama Tel Aviv Hotel is located midway between the modern city Tel Aviv, and Jaffa, an ancient port city.\n\nFurnished with contemporary flair and highlighted by splendid views, the Dan Panorama Hotel features elegantly appointed guestrooms. Guests can enjoy a host of in-house amenities: a sun deck, premium leisure facilities, and the city’s largest hotel pool. On the doorstep are boutique stores, restaurants and nightclubs. On top of that, the hotel is within walking distance of almost any major attraction in Tel Aviv\n\nFor a truly Mediterranean atmosphere, explore the Carmel Market - one of the largest open markets in Israel with ultra-fresh produce as well as meats, fish and baked goods. Also nearby is the Neve Tzedek neighborhood, which has an authentic village feel with its tiny alleyways and boutique stores. South of the hotel is the Old Railway Station complex, an exciting entrainment hub with restaurants, shops and nightclubs. Further south is Jaffa, famous for its association with the biblical stories of Jonah, Solomon, and Saint Peter. Jaffa’s ancient port has been in use since the Bronze Age and you can still watch the fishers going out to sea.\n\nThe Dan Panorama Tel Aviv Hotel is directly linked to the Dan Panorama Convention Center - the city’s biggest convention and exhibition center. Simply stroll across the lobby and you’re there."
