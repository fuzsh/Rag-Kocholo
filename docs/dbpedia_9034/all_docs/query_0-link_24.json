        "text": "Updated to reflect U.S. government restrictions on travel to Northern Israel, and information for U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents and qualifying immediate family members seeking assistance in Gaza.\n\nDo Not Travel To:\n\nGaza due to terrorism and armed conflict\n\nNorthern Israel within 2.5 miles of the Lebanese and Syrian borders due to the rising tensions between Hizballah and Israel\n\nReconsider Travel To:\n\nIsrael due to terrorism and civil unrest\n\nWest Bank due to terrorism and civil unrest\n\nCountry Summary: Terrorist groups, lone-actor terrorists and other violent extremists continue plotting possible attacks in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. Terrorists and violent extremists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. Violence can occur in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza without warning.\n\nSome areas have increased risk. Read the country information page for additional information on travel to Israel and the West Bank, and Gaza.\n\nVisit the CDC page for the latest Travel Health Information related to your travel.\n\nIf you decide to travel to Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza.\n\nVisit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas.\n\nCheck the most recent Alerts at the Embassy website for the latest information on travel in all of these areas.\n\nMaintain a high degree of situational awareness and exercise caution at all times, especially at checkpoints and other areas with a significant presence of security forces.\n\nAvoid demonstrations and crowds.\n\nFollow the instructions of security and emergency response officials.\n\nBeware of and report suspicious activities, including unattended items, to local police.\n\nLearn the location of the nearest bomb shelter or other hardened shelter. Download the Home Front Command Red Alert application for mobile devices (available on devices within Israel) to receive real time alerts for rocket attacks.\n\nObtain comprehensive travel medical insurance that includes medical evacuation prior to travel. Most travel insurance packages do not cover mental health related illnesses/care.\n\nEnroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\n\nFollow the Department of State on Facebook and X/Twitter.\n\nReview the Country Security Report for Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza.\n\nPrepare a contingency plan for emergency situations. Review the Traveler’s Checklist.\n\nGaza – Do Not Travel\n\nDo not travel due to terrorism and armed conflict.\n\nThe U.S. government is unable to provide routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Gaza as U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling there. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are conducting large-scale military operations in Gaza against Hamas, a U.S. government-designated foreign terrorist organization, which was responsible for the October 7 attack on Israel. As a result of the armed conflict, the security environment within Gaza and on its borders is extremely dangerous and volatile. The pedestrian crossing between Gaza and Israel was damaged on October 7 and remains closed, and the pedestrian crossing between Egypt and Gaza has been closed since May 7 and it is unknown when it will re-open. There are sporadic telecommunication and internet outages within Gaza further inhibiting the ability of residents to obtain information.\n\nIf a U.S. citizen, Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR), or qualified immediate family member desires our assistance and has not already provided their information to the Department of State, please email U.S. Embassy Jerusalem at JerusalemACS@state.gov with a copy of the individual’s travel document as well as an explanation or proof of relationship.\n\nVisit our website for Travel to High Risk Areas.\n\nIf you decide to travel to Gaza:\n\nBe prepared for an indefinite stay as the crossings between Gaza with Israel and Egypt can close without advance notice and for long periods during times of unrest and armed conflict.\n\nHave a plan for entering and departing Gaza that does not rely on U.S. government assistance.\n\nHouseholds with infants and young children should plan for food and supplies, such as diapers and wipes, formula or baby food, and a change of clothing.\n\nIf you take medication, make sure to have at least five days’ worth at any given time – if you can, we encourage enough for two weeks beyond your scheduled trip and have a copy of your prescriptions handy.\n\nIf you use assistive or medical devices that require a power supply, be sure to find backup power or other ways that will sustain your device or equipment during a power outage.\n\nDraft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.\n\nDiscuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.\n\nLeave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.\n\nPlease be sure to visit our website for How to Prepare for a Crisis for information that may be helpful.\n\nIsrael – Reconsider Travel (see below for specific advice on travel within 2.5 miles of Lebanese and Syrian borders)\n\nReconsider travel due to terrorism and civil unrest.\n\nThe security situation remains unpredictable, and U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness as security incidents, including mortar and rocket fire, often take place without warning.\n\nU.S. government employees in Israel under Chief of Mission security responsibility are currently restricted from personal travel to the following locations:\n\nWithin seven miles of the Gaza demarcation line, as well as the cities of Ashdod and Ashkelon; and\n\nWithin 1.5 miles of the Israel-Egypt border.\n\nAdditional travel restrictions may be imposed on U.S. government employees under Chief of Mission security responsibility, with little to no notice due to increased security issues or threats.\n\nNorthern Israel (within 2.5 miles of Lebanese and Syrian borders) – Do Not Travel\n\nU.S. government employees in Israel under Chief of Mission security responsibility are currently restricted from personal travel within 2.5 miles of the Lebanese and Syrian borders. Any U.S. government travel to this area is done in full coordination with Israeli security forces.\n\nDue to the ongoing active hostilities between Israel and Hizballah, the U.S. Embassy strongly recommends that U.S. citizens do not travel within 2.5 miles of the Lebanese and Syrian borders. Cross-border rocket, missile, and drone strikes continue to impact this area daily and have resulted in casualties. The Israeli authorities already restrict travel to these areas.\n\nWest Bank – Reconsider Travel\n\nReconsider travel due to terrorism and civil unrest.\n\nU.S. government employees in Israel under Chief of Mission security responsibility are currently restricted from all personal travel to the West Bank, except:\n\nU.S. government employees can use Routes 1, 90, and 443 at any time.\n\nU.S. government employees are permitted personal daylight travel to Jericho and Bethlehem, including Beit Jala and Beit Sahour. Given continued closures of checkpoints throughout the West Bank, the only permitted and accessible route into Bethlehem for U.S. government employees and their family members is through Checkpoint 300 near Rachel’s Tomb.\n\nU.S. government employees are permitted daylight travel to: Inn of the Good Samaritan, An-Nabi Musa, Wadi Qelt Nature Preserve, and St. George’s Monastery along Route 1; and Qumran, Kalia Beach, St. Gerasimos/Khogla Monastery, Al Auju, and Qasr al-Yaud baptismal site along Route 90.\n\nOver the past few months, there has been an increase in settler violence, Israeli military operations, and terrorist attacks.\n\nAdditional travel restrictions may be imposed on U.S. government employees under Chief of Mission security responsibility with little to no notice due to increased security issues or threats."
