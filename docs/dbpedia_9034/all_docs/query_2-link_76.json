        "text": "Travel Guide to Israel\n\nShalom!\n\nBon Voyage!\n\nWe wish you a wonderful journey and an enjoyable stay in the endlessly fascinating and beautiful land of Israel.\n\nIsram Israel will do everything possible to ensure that your tour will be an exciting and memorable experience, filled with the joy of discovery and remembered happily for many years to come.\n\nThis booklet is designed to answer many of your questions and to provide you with valuable information to make your trip to Israel more enjoyable. We hope you will find it useful.\n\nWe look forward to hosting you in Israel and thank you for choosing Isram Israel.\n\nSincerely,\n\nIlana Apelboim\n\nGeneral Manager\n\nIsram Israel, USA\n\nPassport\n\nTourists are required to hold passports valid for 6 months beyond the duration of their stay. Visitors are allowed to stay in the country for three months from the date of arrival.\n\nYou Do Not Need A Visa – U.S. and Canadian citizens do not need a visa to visit Israel – just a valid passport (valid for at least 6 months beyond the duration of your stay). Visitors from most European countries, Mexico, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and many other countries also do not need visas. To check the requirements for other nationalities contact the Israeli Consulate.\n\nUpon entering Israel, please be sure to retain the stamped separate slip that is issued at Israeli Passport Control. As your passports are not stamped, this is your official entry to the country and serves as ID while traveling within Israel. It is also required at hotel check in and car rentals.\n\nYou Don’t Need Vaccinations – No vaccinations or shots are required for U.S. or Canadian visitors to Israel. (If you’ve visited a country prior to coming to Israel where cholera, typhoid or yellow fever is endemic, you will need a vaccination certificate.)\n\nBaggage\n\nIn general, most Transatlantic flights allow one checked bag per person with neither to exceed 62 inches or 50 pounds currently, plus one carry-on bag not to exceed 39”. Infants: No baggage permitted. For domestic flights in the USA, some airlines permit one piece of checked luggage and have a charge for a second piece of checked luggage and some charge from the first piece. However, most of these charges do not apply to passengers who have purchased their domestic connecting flight on the same ticket as their transatlantic flight from/to the USA and are entitled to one checked piece per person not exceeding 50lbs per piece. Weight restrictions on some routes on inter-country or international air flights may apply. Please contact your airline or refer to its website for detailed information regarding your airline’s checked baggage policies. Airline policies vary and may change at any time. Isram Israel is not responsible for any excess luggage/weight charges levied by an airline. Baggage insurance is highly recommended, as we cannot be held responsible for lost or damaged luggage or personal items.\n\nNote: Due to space limitations in the touring vehicles we ask that you limit your luggage to 1 piece per person plus a small carry-on.\n\nArrival Transfers\n\nFor passengers entitled to an arrival transfer at Ben Gurion Airport, our transfer host will greet you inside the baggage claim area once you clear Passport Control. Should you have any difficulties locating him/her, please proceed to the information counter and they will gladly page ISRAM/SMILE host. If you are part of a tour group, or have private car arrangements, please affix the Isram Israel tags to your luggage for easy identification. Those who have selected the special VIP Laufer service for meeting at the sleeve of the aircraft, kindly refer to your documents for meeting details.\n\nIsraeli – Jordanian Border Crossings\n\nThere are three crossing points used frequently for travel between Israel and Jordan: The Arava crossing near Eilat, the Sheikh Hussein Crossing in the north, and the Allenby Bridge (King Hussein) crossing near Jerusalem. American & Canadian citizens can secure visas for Jordan locally when crossing at Sheikh Hussein (north). For crossings at the Arava Border (near Eilat), or at the Allenby Bridge (near Jerusalem) visas must be issued in advance of your arrival or you will not be able to enter Jordan at these borders. Isram Israel will review the procedure and in most cases, will apply for your visa through our representatives in Jordan (restrictions apply). Visa Fees and Border Crossing Fees are generally not included in the price of your tour unless otherwise indicated.\n\nIn some instances, you must apply to the Jordan Embassy directly for your visa. The address of the Embassy in Washington is: Embassy of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan Consular Office, 3504 International Drive, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20008. Application forms can be downloaded from the Jordan Embassy website. Please note that you should not apply more than 45 days in advance of your arrival in Jordan as the visa issued is valid for only 2 months from issue date.\n\nCustoms\n\nYou may bring in almost anything you’ll need for personal use and your convenience. Limited items per adult are: 44 pints cologne or perfume; 2 liters wine; 1 liter liquor; 250 grams cigars or loose tobacco; 250 cigarettes; gifts up to $200.00 in value.\n\nUpon return to the U.S., you may bring in up to $400.00 worth of items duty free. Please Note: Many Israeli-made items are not counted as part of your duty-free allowance as they are exempt from U.S. duty.\n\nForeign Currency Exchange\n\nTourists, who have changed foreign currency (U.S. dollars) into Israeli currency (NIS), may re-exchange their money into dollars by presenting the receipt of the transaction up to a maximum of $500. This may be done at any bank in Israel or at Ben Gurion Airport upon departure.\n\nCurrency\n\nThe Israeli Shekel (NIS) is the country’s legal tender. The Shekel is divided into 100 agorot. The bills are in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 shekels. There are coins of 1,5, and 10 shekels and 5,10, and 50 agorot. You may bring an unlimited amount of foreign currency into Israel – cash, traveler’s checks, letters of credit or State of Israel bonds. Upon departure you may take out up to NIS 1,000.\n\nYou may wish to change some currency at the bank so that you may pay for incidental items such as buses, taxis, fast food, newspaper, soft drinks, etc. However, we recommend that you change only a limited amount at one time, as it will cost you a fee to change back to USD. Most places accept traveler’s checks & major credit cards. There are also many ATM machines throughout Israel that dispense both NIS and USD.\n\nV.A.T. (Value Added Tax)\n\nThe V.A.T. (Value Added Tax) is 17% (Israel’s equivalent of U.S. Sales Tax) at printing time. All tourists in Israel are exempt from V.A.T. when paying in foreign currency for services provided in Israel. It is advisable to charge all of your extras, including meals, to your room and when checking out pay in U.S. dollars or credit card. Anything that is not charged to your room even if paid in dollars will be assessed the VAT. When purchasing items in approved shops, be sure to ask for a “V.A.T. Refund Form” if your goods are in excess of NIS 400. Be sure that the shopkeeper completes this form. This will entitle you to a V.A.T. refund at Ben Gurion International Airport upon departure at the Bank Leumi counter (after check in). The refund will be given in cash after presentation of your purchase invoice.\n\nPlease be sure to have with you the articles purchased as you may be asked to present them. Should the items you purchased include creams and liquids such as Ahava products, which are over the restricted quantity allowed by the airline, then you may not be able to take them on board as “carry on”. As such, although you may have wanted to secure the VAT refund for these items, we strongly advise you to pack such items as check in luggage and possibly forfeit the VAT refund. Otherwise, there is a risk that you may have to leave these items behind.\n\nKindly be advised that if you are exiting Israel to Jordan or Egypt at one of the border crossings and returning to Israel, the V.A.T. refund for your purchased items in Israel will apply only if your stay in Jordan or Egypt did not exceed 48 hours (from departure to return). Otherwise, for any VAT refund to apply, you must make your purchases only after returning from Jordan or Egypt.\n\nPlease Note: Passengers who are in possession of an Israeli Passport (including those with dual citizenship) may be subject to a 17% V.A.T. charge levied in Israel at the hotels or for car rentals. It must be paid, if requested, directly to the hotel/establishment. Please note that Isram Israel assumes no responsibility whatsoever for any charges to your account made by an establishment.\n\nBanking Hours\n\nSunday, Tuesday & Thursday from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and from 4:00 to 5:30 p.m., Monday & Wednesday from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and eve of holidays from 8:30 a.m. to Noon. Branches in leading hotels usually offer additional hours.\n\nState of Israel Bonds\n\nTourists holding State of Israel Bonds in their name or legally assigned to them, may redeem them at any bank prior to their date of maturity for Israeli currency (NIS) up to the equivalent of $2,500 per month of stay for each member of the family.\n\nTime\n\nIsraeli Standard Time is 2 hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time, 1 hour ahead of mid-European Time. Israel is 7 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time and 10 hours ahead of Pacific U.S.A time.\n\nElectrical Appliances\n\nThe electric current in Israel is 220 volts AC, single phase, 50 cycles. Sockets are usually three pronged and foreign-made appliances often require adapters for plugs. Israel’s voltage is 220 volts, like Europe. Most luxury hotels provide hair dryers, and virtually all hotel rooms have 110/220 electric shaver sockets. Our electricity outlets usually conform to European adapters, but hotels and electrical stores can easily supply you with the right adapter if necessary.\n\nWeather\n\nThe weather in Israel is often compared to the temperate climate in Florida and southern California. There are sun-drenched summers and mild, balmy winters. However, as in most countries there can be sharp contrasts dependent upon the season. Year-round swimming is possible from April to October along the Mediterranean coast and the Sea of Galilee and throughout the year at the Dead Sea and the Red Sea.\n\nThe summer season (April to October) has fairly constant temperatures and is unspoiled by sudden showers. The winter season (November to March) is mild but quite cold in hilly areas (Jerusalem). Spells of rain are interspersed with brilliant sunshine.\n\nMean Temperature (Fahrenheit)\n\nJerusalem Tel Aviv Haifa Tiberias Eilat Jan 43-53 49-65 45-63 48-65 49-70 Feb 43-57 47-65 47-64 48-67 51-73 Mar 47-60 51-68 47-70 51-72 56-79 Apr 53-69 54-72 54-77 55-80 62-87 May 59-77 63-77 58-76 62-89 69-94 June 63-81 66-82 63-81 68-94 75-98 July 65-83 70-86 68-86 73-98 77-103 Aug 65-85 72-86 70-86 74-99 79-104 Sep 64-82 68-88 67-85 70-95 74-97 Oct 60-77 59-83 59-81 65-89 68-91 Nov 54-66 54-76 55-73 58-78 60-82 Dec 46-56 47-66 48-64 53-68 51-74\n\nShabbat in Israel\n\nPublic transportation stops on Fridays about an hour before the onset of the Shabbat (except in Haifa, Nazareth and East Jerusalem) and starts again after nightfall on Saturday.\n\nMost theaters, motion-picture houses and restaurants are closed, but most non-Kosher restaurants are open. In the major cities most shops are closed, except in the non-Jewish neighborhoods.\n\nAlthough some museums, zoos and public places stay open, they do not sell tickets on Shabbat; you must buy them in advance.\n\nHotel restaurants and room service operate normally on Shabbat with menu limitations.\n\nIf you are driving on Shabbat, please be aware that if your route takes you through certain orthodox, deeply religious areas, residents may be disturbed to see motor vehicles operating through their neighborhood.\n\nSome private bus companies and sightseeing tours do operate on Shabbat.\n\nWhat to Pack\n\nSummer Season: Very light and comfortable clothing, preferably drip-dry for daywear. In the mountains (Jerusalem, Safed and Upper Galilee) a sweater is quite useful in the evening even in the middle of summer. This hold true for the desert also.\n\nIn-Between Seasons: Light coats, sweaters, suits and light shirts. The secret of dressing for this time of year is to “layer” and “peel” as the weather changes.\n\nWinter Season: Warm coat, raincoat, hat, sweaters, woolen or heavy suit, warm shoes and boots. Lighter clothing and a swimsuit are suitable if you are travelling to Eilat on the Red Sea or to the Dead Sea area.\n\nPlease note: Proper attire is a must for visits to Holy sites (no shorts or sleeveless blouses for women and no shorts above the knee for men).\n\nDon’t Forget to Pack:\n\nA scarf (for head and shoulders)\n\nVery comfortable shoes or Sneakers\n\nFirst-aid kit\n\nSewing kit\n\nBathing suit\n\nMedical and eyeglass prescriptions\n\nSoft, foldable slippers for the plane\n\nPackets of tissues and towelettes\n\nCrease-free and casual clothing\n\nTote-bag for day trips\n\nDecaffeinated coffee/tea packets\n\nRubber shoes for Dead Sea or Red Sea\n\nSunglasses, sunhat and sunscreen\n\nTravel alarm\n\nFor Dinners, we recommend shirts and slacks for the men, while dresses, slacks and blouses or pants suits are recommended for the ladies. On the Jewish Sabbath (Friday night) men may wear sports jackets although it is not mandatory in most hotels.\n\nPublic Telephones\n\nSince there is a service charge on international calls from hotels, even with Calling Cards, we suggest that whenever possible you use public pay phones. You may buy phone cards at the front desk or newsstand at your hotel. Instructions on how to use the pay phone is clearly illustrated and explained in English on the telephone. The most economical alternative for USA calls is to use AT&T USADirect® Service.\n\nPublic Transportation\n\nBuses, Trains & “Sheiruts”:\n\nYou will need Israeli currency, but not exact change. The public transportation (buses and trains) does not run on Saturdays and Jewish holidays (in the Jewish calendar the day starts and ends at sunset). On these days, and other days as well, you can use a “Sheirut” or a taxi. A “Sheirut” is a service that uses 7-seater minibuses and operates on the exact routes of public bus lines. You can get on and off the “Sheirut” anywhere along the line, not only at bus stops.\n\nTaxis:\n\nWhen using taxis, insist that the driver uses the meter. Remember that the amount shown on the meter is in Israeli currency and prices do change according to time of day. Evening rates are higher.\n\nIf you have not prearranged the transfer to your hotel, please be aware that there is an Airport Bus Service at Ben Gurion Airport, which operates hourly to all of the major hotels in Tel-Aviv and Jerusalem. The Information Desk will give you complete details as to the cost of the service. The buses also operate in reverse, picking up passengers at the hotels for return to Ben Gurion Airport. All hotels have a complete time table.\n\nDriving Yourself:\n\nAll international car rental companies are represented in Israel, and there is a variety of Israeli companies too. A passport, major credit card and U.S. or Canadian driver’s license is needed to rent a car in Israel. The highway system is advanced and up to U.S./European standards. Most signs are in English in addition to Hebrew. In Israel, we drive on the right, just like in the U.S.A.\n\nValuables\n\nWe recommend that you use safe in your hotel room (or in the hotel) for your valuables and passports, etc. It is advisable to make a photocopy of your passport and carry it with you. Visits to Bethlehem require a passport.\n\nKeeping In Touch\n\nHow to call Israel?\n\nTo call Israel from North America, dial 011-972 and then the number in Israel (omitting the initial zero).\n\nCalling Home from Israel?\n\nIt’s easy: AT&T, MCI and Sprint all have toll-free access numbers in Israel. Ask the hotel operator how to dial directly from your room. From a public phone check the instruction card (which will tell you to dial 012, 013 or 014 for overseas) then continue with 1 for the United States, the area code and phone number. If you are dialing from an office or a cell phone, dial 00 and then the number including the 1 before the area code. Other countries, please check with the Hotel Operator for the correct country code.\n\nCalling Cards:\n\nPublic phones in Israel operate with calling cards purchased from your hotel, post office, kiosks and newsstands throughout the country.\n\nCell (Mobile) Phones:\n\nIt’s easy to rent a cell-phone for Israel. Please see Isram Israel’s website www.isramisraelusa.com. Go to “Plan Your Trip” and there you will find cell phone rentals. If you are not a USA resident, it is also possible to rent a phone when you arrive at Ben Gurion International Airport and return it upon departure (advance reservations aren’t necessary). However, this may take time and delay your transfer service. If your U.S. cell-phone is a Tri-Band model, it will work in Israel.\n\nPostal Service:\n\nYou can buy stamps at your hotel, at kiosks and at post offices. The Post Office also sells calling cards and will help you with money transfers.\n\nInternet:\n\nTravelers can get on the internet in their hotel’s Business Center, or, with their own laptop, from the comfort of their hotel room (there may be a charge for internet access). You will also find Internet Cafes and public Internet outlets all over Israel.\n\nTour Guides\n\nThe Israeli Tour Guides are world-famous. They are well trained, extraordinarily knowledgeable and ready at all times to aid you with your special requests and arrangements. Your guide will be happy to make suggestions for evenings or free days and provide lists of available optional tours.\n\nSightseeing\n\nThere is so much to see in Israel and we want to show you the maximum during the short time you will be here. Therefore, we ask that you follow the guide’s instructions and be punctual at all times…this makes our job easier and your trip even better.\n\nSeat Rotation on the Motorcoach\n\nSeats on the bus are rotated on a daily basis in order to enable everyone to have the opportunity to sit in the front.\n\nSmoking\n\nSmoking is not allowed on any of our touring vehicles. However, rest stops are made with frequency for people who wish to smoke.\n\nEnglish Newspapers & Broadcasts\n\nThe Jerusalem Post is published daily and on weekends and is the major English newspaper in Israel. News broadcasts in English on the radio are aired in the evening. Most of the major hotels feature all of the major news channels.\n\nMedical Information\n\nWhile touring, please remember not to pack your medication in your luggage, since your luggage is not readily available during the day. We recommend that you keep your medication and valuables in your carry-on piece. Please be aware that every hotel does have a House Doctor on call, if necessary.\n\nPhotography\n\nIsrael’s stunning landscapes and picturesque inhabitants make it truly a “photographer’s paradise.” Please be aware, however, that there are certain religious communities whose members resent having their picture taken. These include certain Orthodox Jewish sects and observant Moslems. Your discretion will save embarrassment.\n\nBe sure to protect your camera against the sun and heat. Don’t take pictures between 12 noon and 3:30 p.m. when the light is too harsh, particularly in the summertime. In the Negev, don’t take color shots early in the morning or late in the afternoon as the result will be a reddish overtone.\n\nDeparture Transfer\n\nFor passengers who are entitled to departure transfers, our office in Israel will advise you as to the time of your pick up for departure to the airport. Please settle your hotel bill and be ready at the reception desk at the time indicated.\n\nShopping\n\nSeveral hundred shops are approved for tourists by the Israel Ministry of Tourism. These shops display a sign stating “Listed by the Ministry” and the Ministry’s emblem (two scouts carrying a bunch of grapes on a pole between them). Among the best buys in Israel are carpets, ceramics, copperware, religious articles, jewelry, silverware, diamonds, paintings and sculptures.\n\nStores are generally open from 9:30 A.M. to 7:00 P.M. Sunday to Thursday. The Jewish Shabbat is from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday where most stores and businesses are closed. On Friday and eve of holidays, stores close at Noon. Department stores and malls are open all day and some evenings. If you like to bargain, comb the colorful local markets and bazaars (Jerusalem, Acre, Jaffa) for handmade arts and crafts.\n\nRemember to ask for the “V.A.T. Refund Form” as discussed in the V.A.T. section.\n\nFood and Wine\n\nIsraeli food takes the best of Oriental and Western cuisine and adds its own flavor. Hungarian goulash, Russian borscht, Viennese schnitzel, American hot dogs, hamburgers and pizza are to be found side by side with Oriental falafel, humus, tahini, shishlik, kebab and Turkish coffee, as well as traditional Jewish dishes such as gefilte fish, chopped liver and chicken soup (like Mama makes)!\n\nThe wines of Israel compare well with those of Europe and range from light white to dry red to sweet rosé. There is also a good choice of local brandies and liqueurs. If you’re used to your “name brand” liquor, we suggest you bring it from the Duty Free Shop before you arrive in Israel – imported liquor is very expensive in Israel.\n\nYou will thoroughly enjoy the fruits and vegetables in Israel, as they are extraordinarily tasty, fresh and delicious.\n\nMost Israelis eat a large breakfast, a main meat meal at midday and a light dairy meal in the evening. The wide variety of restaurants throughout the country caters to this preference, but they are also prepared to suit individual tastes.\n\nYou Don’t Need to Worry About Water and Fresh Produce: The water is safe to drink throughout Israel, and Israel’s fresh fruit and vegetables are world-class. Bottled water is available everywhere as well.\n\nKosher Food: The Hebrew word “kosher” means food conforming to Jewish dietary laws. Certain animals and fish are prohibited and milk, cream or cheese may not be served together with meat. Most hotels have kosher food and many restaurants conform to the dietary laws. However, it is quite easy to find non-Kosher restaurants all over Israel.\n\nWater: Tap water is officially drinkable throughout Israel, but bottled mineral water is widely available for those who prefer to be cautious. In hot weather remember to drink much more liquid than usual to combat the effects of dehydration.\n\nIsraeli Breakfast: The famous Israeli Buffet Breakfast is included in your tour unless otherwise specified. You have free choice at the buffet and may eat as much as you want, but there may be a charge for some special items ordered from the waiter. Breakfast at some hotels may be ordered to your room, but please note that there is a small charge for room service. Please check with your hotel for clarification.\n\nLunches: When touring, stops are usually made at self-service restaurants for lunch, where you may choose from a large selection of dishes. We attempt to stop at clean places where you will be able to get fast service and have proper washroom facilities. Please bear in mind, however, that in some areas of the country these places are limited and not always up to standard. Restaurants do not permit eating of food brought in from outside.\n\nDinners: Our guides can recommend different restaurants in each city (for those days that dinner may not be included in your program.) There is a wide variation of restaurants specializing in international cuisine in Israel. You may, of course, always choose to eat at your own hotel.\n\nHalf-Board (Passengers with Meal Plans):No credit is given for meals that are missed, nor can they be eaten on another day and transferred. If arrangements are made in advance with the reception desk at the hotel, lunch may be substituted for dinner the same day.At some hotels, “Half-Board” dinners are limited to certain dining rooms and there may be a supplement for meals eaten at different outlets. Please check with the reception desk at the hotel to be sure that you are eating in the proper dining room. If you decide to eat in the Grill Groom at the hotel, we recommend making reservations in advance.\n\nTipping\n\nTipping in Israel is very similar to tipping in the U.S. Use your own judgment, based on your personal satisfaction with the services as to how much to tip.\n\nFollowing is a suggestion guideline:\n\nRestaurant & Hotel Dining Rooms: Average tip is approximately 15%. (Tips are not expected in hotels at breakfast.)\n\nIncluded Dinners on Tour: Tips are not included unless advised otherwise by your guide/tour manager. We suggest a tip of $3.00 per person.\n\nBellboys: Tipping for service to and from your room is recommended at $2.00 per bag.\n\nChambermaids: We recommend approximately $2.00 per person per day.\n\nTaxicabs: Although Israelis do not normally tip taxi drivers, if you are pleased with the service, we recommend tipping 10% of the fare.\n\nTour Guides & Drivers: It is customary to show your appreciation to the guide and driver of your tour.
