        "text": "International calls were once associated with long-distance operators and the occasional headache. But with the rise of mobile phones and VoIP tech, reaching countries outside the US is easier than ever.\n\nThese days, you can make phone calls to Israel from the US in under thirty seconds — if you know the right code to dial, that is.\n\nLet’s walk through each step of the calling process, including time factors to consider, current calling rates, and ways to save money while on the line.\n\nCall Israel from the US in four easy steps\n\nTo make a call to Israel from the United States, follow these steps:\n\nDial 011 – This is the international dialing code for the U.S.\n\nDial 972 – This is the country code for Israel.\n\nDial the area code – This is typically a single digit. For example, Jerusalem’s area code is 2.\n\nDial the local phone number – This is usually a seven-digit number.\n\nPlease note that the specific area code and local phone number will vary depending on the person or business you are trying to reach.\n\nAs long as you have a phone, laptop, or browser extension, you can make calls to Israel from virtually any device. 📲 However, there are different steps required depending on the type of number you’re calling. We’re going to break these down by mobile number and landline number, starting with the latter.\n\nCalling Israeli mobile phone numbers\n\nThe dialing code for landline phones in Israel can be broken down into four parts:\n\nUSA exit code\n\nIsrael’s country code\n\nLocal area code\n\nCustomer telephone number\n\nLet’s pick apart each step below.\n\n1. Punch in the exit code\n\nExit codes tell carriers you’re preparing to make an international call.\n\nYou won’t necessarily need to dial this manually. If you’re calling from a mobile phone or a VoIP number, just hit the plus (+) symbol. On OpenPhone, this will instantly add the exit code to your string of numbers.\n\nIf you’re using a desk phone and calling from the United States though, you’ll need to dial the exit code 011.\n\n2. Dial the country code\n\nEvery country has its own unique calling code — including Israel’s country code of 972.\n\n3. Add the area code prefix\n\nJust like the US, Israel breaks its country into smaller chunks with area codes routing to separate districts. But unlike the US (which typically has three-digit city codes), these are just one number.\n\nHere’s what this looks like for Israel’s major cities:\n\nLocationArea Code Ashdod8 Beersheba (Be'er Sheva)8 Eilat8 Haifa4 Jerusalem2 Nazareth4 Netanya9 Tel Aviv3\n\nIf the area code you need isn’t listed here, tools like CountryCode.org provide a more exhaustive collection.\n\n4. Enter the phone number\n\nAlmost done — now all you need is the specific phone number of your client, which will be nine digits long for a mobile number.\n\nTo recap, your string of numbers should look something like this if you’re calling someone in Tel Aviv:\n\n+972 31-2345-6789 (fictional phone number)\n\nCalling Israeli landline numbers\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, calling landline phones in Israel is different from calling someone’s mobile number — but only by a slim margin.\n\nLet’s break this down in greater detail.\n\n1. The exit code\n\nNo matter where you live, you’ll need to dial your country’s exit code to show carriers that you’re making an international call.\n\nHere in the US, the exit code is 011. Dialing the plus symbol (+) instead of the US exit code also works if you’re using OpenPhone or dialing from your personal cell number (with most carriers).\n\n2. The country code\n\nType 972 for Israel’s country code. No differences to worry about here!\n\n3. The area code\n\nThis step stays exactly the same as dialing an Israeli mobile number. The area code will be a one-digit number depending on the city you’re calling.\n\n4. The local number\n\nHere’s where you’ll see the difference between dialing a landline number in Israel and a mobile number.\n\nYou’ll still dial the customer’s phone number as before. However, Israeli landline phone numbers have eight digits rather than nine, skewing your final results.\n\nWhen you put all of the above steps together, you’re left with something like this:\n\n+972 3 (one-digit area code) 1234-5678 (fictional phone number)\n\nHow to factor in the time difference when calling Israel from the US\n\nAs tempting as it is to call clients when it’s most convenient for you, there’s a significant time difference between the US and Israel to keep in mind. ⏰ The entire country follows the same time zone: Israel Daylight Time and Israel Standard Time (for when DST is not in effect).\n\nDepending on your location, there may be more than half a day’s difference between yourself and your clients:\n\nEastern Time: You are seven hours behind Israel (your 12 PM is their 7 PM)\n\nCentral Time: You are eight hours behind Israel (your 12 PM is their 8 PM)\n\nMountain Time: You are nine hours behind Israel (your 12 PM is their 9 PM)\n\nPacific Time: You are ten hours behind Israel (your 12 PM is their 10 PM)\n\nAlaska Time: You are eleven hours behind Israel (your 12 PM is their 11 PM)\n\nHawaii Time: You are thirteen hours behind Israel (your 12 PM is their 1 AM)\n\nIn most cases, it’s easier to use a conversion tool to compare time zones. Time and Date is relatively popular, as is Timebie.\n\nHow much does it cost to call Israel from the US?\n\nThe price you’ll pay to call Israel from the US largely depends on your carrier.\n\nThe FCC doesn’t regulate maximum fees, but sources indicate a range from a few pennies to a few dollars. You might end up paying $5 or $6 per hour of conversation or a whopping $200 for 60 minutes and some change. Other carriers expect you to pay through calling cards (think prepaid debits) or flat monthly rates.\n\nThese options aren’t without drawbacks. Calling cards that run dry will cut your line in the middle of a convo, while flat rates limit the international minutes you can use per month. In either case, none of these situations are convenient.\n\nHow to lower your calling costs to Israel\n\nThe results are in: traditional service carriers and old-school ‘solutions’ just aren’t cost-effective. Making free calls to Israel may not be possible, but it is possible to save big with OpenPhone’s VoIP for international calls and messages.
