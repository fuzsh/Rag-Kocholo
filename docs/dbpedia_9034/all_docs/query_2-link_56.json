        "text": "Hark! Forget all those vocaloids and Tupac holograms, everybody — because the next stage in the Future of Live Performance™ is upon us with Actress’ newly announced fall tour!\n\nThe new string of dates (which follows a summer U.S. tour that we won’t talk about because we’re all about THE FUTURE here) will take the producer through the US — as well as a few fleeting dalliances across the Canadian border — as he debuts a brand new live A/V set featuring two “AI performers” and “a special appearance from Actress’ ‘Chrome Man’ figure on keyboard.” But enough of this impenetrable technical jargon. All you lay people need to know is that there’s lots of STATE-OF-THE-ART TECH and WHOZITS and WHATZITS going on behind the scenes to make the performance as groundbreaking and forward-thinking as, I don’t know, Blade Runner 2049 (I haven’t seen it yet, guys; so no spoilers!). The tour will also feature shows with similarly-minded futurist luminaries Nicolas Jaar and Telefon Tel Aviv, which is, you know, “nice”.\n\nSo, if you have an eye for tech and ear for electronic music (or you just really liked Actress’ most recent album, AZD) and you happen to call one of those big colorful areas in the top left quadrant of that old framed map in your grandparents’ basement home, then check out the full list of dates below and, like, buy tickets and stuff! In either case, until next time: I’ll see you…in the FUTUREEEE!!\n\nActress Tours Soon-To-Be Dystopian Urban Wastelands 2017:\n\n10.11.17 - Toronto, ON - Massey Hall *\n\n10.12.17 - Montreal, QC - Olympia *\n\n10.13.17 - Miami, FL - III Points Festival\n\n10.17.17 - Los Angeles, CA - UNION\n\n10.18.17 - San Francisco, CA - Grey Area\n\n10.19.17 - Brooklyn, NY - Brooklyn Steel *\n\n10.20.17 - Troy, NY - EMPAC\n\n10.21.17 - Brooklyn, NY - Brooklyn Bazaar\n\n11.30.17 - Dallas, TX - Dada ^\n\n12.01.17 - Austin, TX - Barracuda ^\n\n12.02.17 - Houston, TX - Walters ^"
