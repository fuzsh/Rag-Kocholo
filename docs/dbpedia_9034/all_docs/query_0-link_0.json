        "text": "American electronic music project\n\nTelefon Tel Aviv is an American electronic music act formed in 1999 by musicians Charles Cooper and Joshua Eustis. Since Cooper's accidental death in 2009, Telefon Tel Aviv has continued with Eustis as the sole official member.[1]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nTelefon Tel Aviv was formed in 1999 by Charles Cooper and Joshua Eustis, with their first album Fahrenheit Fair Enough, released in the fall of 2001 to positive reviews. In 2002, the group released an EP on the Hefty Records Immediate Action label. In 2004, the duo released their second full-length album, Map of What Is Effortless, and a compilation album of remixes titled Remixes Compiled in 2007. The group released its third full-length album in January 2009 on the BPitch Control label. Influenced by English electronic band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD),[2] Immolate Yourself peaked at #17 on the Billboard Top Electronic Albums chart.[3] In 2016, their debut was re-released with eight bonus tracks.[4]\n\nSince 2011, Eustis has been working on new music. In March 2012, Eustis mentioned on his Twitter account that he was \"trying\" to work on new Telefon Tel Aviv material.[5] In February 2013, Eustis was announced as a member of the touring lineup of Nine Inch Nails. He was originally slated to tour with band throughout 2013 and 2014.[6] However, on December 5, 2013, it was revealed by Trent Reznor that Eustis was no longer part of the Nine Inch Nails touring line-up, citing only Alessandro Cortini, Ilan Rubin, Robin Finck, and himself as band members during an IAmA on Reddit.[7] Eustis also confirmed this on the official Telefon Tel Aviv website.[8]\n\nDeath of Charles Cooper\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 22, 2009, Eustis announced on the group's MySpace blog that Charles Cooper had died. The information also appeared on the band's website: \"Charles Wesley Cooper III / April 12, 1977 - January 22, 2009\". Two CBS2 Chicago articles about Cooper's death specify that he went missing on January 21 before being found dead.[9][10]\n\nOn January 30, 2009, Eustis posted on the group's MySpace blog that all tour plans have been cancelled and the future of the band is uncertain.[11]\n\nOn March 22, 2009, Eustis posted on the group's MySpace blog that he will perform on stage with a close friend of the group, Fredo Nogueira.[12]\n\nOn July 22, 2009, Eustis posted on the group's MySpace in order to clarify some rumours about Cooper's death, stating that three autopsy reports ruled it was not a suicide but possibly an accidental mix of sleeping pills and alcohol.[13]\n\nSons Of Magdalene and Future\n\n[edit]\n\nOn December 9, 2013, Josh Eustis posted on the official Telefon Tel Aviv website that he was going back into the studio full-time, as he was no longer a touring member of Nine Inch Nails and presumably Puscifer as well. In the same post, Eustis stated that he has been sitting on a 95% finished full-length album under the moniker of Sons Of Magdalene, a name previously used for an EP released in 2008. Additionally, the post confirmed that after the record was finished, he would be working on Telefon Tel Aviv full-time.[14] The debut album from the Sons of Magdelene moniker, Move to Pain, was released June 24 2014.\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nIn interviews, Cooper and Eustis have stated that they use the following software: Digidesign Pro Tools, Native Instruments Reaktor/Electronic Instruments 2 XT, Ableton Live and Max/MSP\n\nAdditionally, the band has contributed samples to the Native Instruments Synthetic Drums 2 sample library.[15]\n\nFor the album Immolate Yourself the band drastically changed their production style, reverting to analog tape and analog synthesizers, claiming this method to \"sound more real\".[16]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\n2001: Fahrenheit Fair Enough\n\n2004: Map of What Is Effortless\n\n2009: Immolate Yourself (#17 Billboard Top Electronic Albums)\n\n2019: Dreams Are Not Enough (#2 Billboard Top Electronic Albums)\n\nExtended plays\n\n[edit]\n\n2002: Immediate Action\n\nCompilations\n\n[edit]\n\n2007: Remixes Compiled\n\nRemixes and Collaborations\n\n[edit]\n\n2000: John Hughes - \"Got Me Lost / Driving In LA\" (Immediate Action#6)\n\n2000: Nine Inch Nails - \"Where Is Everybody?\" (Things Falling Apart)\n\n2001: Phil Ranelin - \"Time Is Running Out\" (Remixes)\n\n2003: Midwest Product - \"A Genuine Display\" (Idol Tryouts : Ghostly International Vol. 1)\n\n2004: Slicker - \"Knock Me Down Girl\" (Knock Me Down Girl)\n\n2005: Marc Hellner - \"Asleep On The Wing\" (Asleep On The Wing)\n\n2005: Apparat - \"Komponent\" (Silizium EP)\n\n2005: Oliver Nelson - \"Stolen Moments\" (Impulsive!
