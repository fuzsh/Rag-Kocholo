Though he’s best known these days as the millionaire momma’s boy Osgood Fielding III in Billy Wilder’s 1959 classic “Some Like It Hot,” comic actor Joe E. Brown was one of Warner Brothers’ top stars in the 1930s. The former circus performer, semi-pro baseball player and Broadway star captivated audiences with his natural athletic ability, trademark yell, wide grin and crack comedic timing. Warner Archive has just released five of his comedies, including the 1931 pre-Code romp “Broad Minded,” which features Bela Lugosi; 1932’s “You Said a Mouthful” with Ginger Rogers pre-Fred Astaire; and 1933’s “Elmer the Great,” one of three baseball comedies he made at Warner, which was based on the Broadway play by Ring Lardner.
