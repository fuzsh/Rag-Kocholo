        "text": "Brown is buried at Forest Lawn Glendale, in the Sunrise Slope Section, his grave marked by a large memorial near the Great Mausoleum featuring a classical statue of a father and mother and their three young children, with the youngest child perched happily on the fathers shoulder.\n\nIn 1902, the 10-year-old Brown left home -- with the blessing of his parents -- and joined the circus. Brown became part of a tumbling act called The Five Marvelous Ashtons, touring the country and performing with circuses and in vaudeville theaters. Brown added comedy to the act, and he became a popular burlesque and Broadway performer in the early 1920s. Despite his talent as a comedian, Browns film debut in The Circus Kid (1928) featured him in a serious role as a lion tamer. He also starred in On With the Show (1929), the first full-length sound film produced entirely in color.\n\nBrown had more success with his early comedies and musicals, including Sally (1929), Hold Everything (1930), Maybe Its Love (1930), Song of the West (1930), Top Speed (1930) and The Tenderfoot (1932). A former semi-professional baseball player, Brown was able to show off his athletic talents in Fireman, Save My Child (1932), Elmer the Great (1933) and Alibi Ike (1935), his trio of baseball films. In his contract with Warner Bros. studios, Brown insisted on a clause that would allow him to organize a baseball team at the studio, and he would play whenever he had the chance.\n\nHe was also one of the few comedians to play Shakespeare, appearing as \"Flute\" in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (1935), which starred Olivia de Havilland, Dick Powell, Ross Alexander, James Cagney and Mickey Rooney, and was the first Shakespeare adaptation to be nominated for an Academy Award as Best Picture.\n\nKnown for his rubbery face, large mouth, infectious grin and ear-splitting yell, Brown was among the highest-paid actors in the mid-1930s. After Brown left Warner Bros. in 1937, he appeared in a long string of low-budget, relatively unsuccessful comedies. Following the death of his son in the crash of a military training plane in 1942, Brown announced his retirement from films, and focused his energy on entertaining U.S. troops around the world.\n\nInspired by the response he received from the troops, Brown returned to films with a serious role as a small-town minister in The Tender Years (1947). His next film role was as Capn Andy Hawks in Show Boat (1951). Brown appeared often on radio and television throughout the 1950s, and capped his career with one of his most memorable and popular roles as Osgood Fielding III, the millionaire who pursues Jack Lemmon in Some Like It Hot (1959).\n\nIn the final scene of the film, Brown and Lemmon -- dressed as Daphne -- take off in Browns speedboat, with plans to get married. Lemmon tries to explain to Brown why he wouldnt make a good wife, but Brown wont be deterred."
