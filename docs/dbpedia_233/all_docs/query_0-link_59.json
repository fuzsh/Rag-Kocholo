        "meta_description": "The\r\neffort to cast the motion picture adaptation of Margaret Mitchell’s classic\r\nnovel Gone with the Wind is almost as epic as the content\r\nitself.  For the role of madam Belle Watling, producer David O. Selznick\r\nconsidered such actresses as Tallulah Bankhead and Billie Dove…and even at one\r\npoint during pre-production (though many have surmised this was a publicity\r\nstunt) suggested Mae West portray Belle.  Eventually, the part of Rhett\r\nButler’s lady friend was awarded to Broadway veteran Ona Munson—born Owena\r\nElizabeth Wolcott in Portland, Oregon on this date in 1903.  Munson’s show\r\nbusiness career encompassed both stage and screen, and she even dabbled in\r\ntelevision before her unfortunate passing in 1955.  Old-time radio fans\r\nknow that Munson shone in the aural medium, however, appearing before the\r\nmicrophone in such venues as Suspense and The\r\nCavalcade of America.Ona\r\nMunson’s show business career blossomed on Broadway.  She was a chorus girl\r\nin the 1919 revue of George White’s Scandals when she was only\r\nsixteen and received her “big break” playing the titular role in No,\r\nNo, Nanette (1926; taking over from Louise Groody).  Munson would\r\nthen go on to grace the casts of successful stage musicals such as Twinkle,\r\nTwinkle (1926), Manhattan Mary (1927), and Hold Everything (1928)—it\r\nwas in this latter production that she introduced the Cole Porter\r\nstandard You’re the Cream in My Coffee.  Even\r\nafter she ventured out to the West Coast for moviemaking, Ona would return to\r\nher stage roots with roles in Hold Your Horses (1933)\r\nand Petticoat Fever (1935), and she tackled a more serious\r\nrole in Ghosts in 1936.  Her final Broadway work would\r\nsurface in 1952, with a small part in a revival of George S. Kaufman-Katharine\r\nDayton’s First Lady.Ona\r\nwas anxious to establish herself in motion pictures…and relished her first\r\nstarring role in Warner Brothers’ Going Wild (1930). Wild had\r\nbeen fashioned as a musical, but the tunes in the movie were excised to placate\r\nthe moviegoing public, who had soured on musicals because of so many having\r\nbeen released the previous year.  Munson would later get the opportunity\r\nto ply her musical stock-in-trade in The Hot Heiress (1931),\r\nwhich allowed her to sing a few numbers alongside her co-star, Ben Lyon. \r\nIn Broadminded (1931), she was reunited with Wild star\r\nJoe E. Brown, and that same year she played cub reporter “Kitty Carmody” in the\r\nsplendid Five Star Final (1931), starring Edward G. Robinson\r\nand Boris Karloff.Munson’s\r\nmovie resume also includes vehicles such as His Exciting Night (1938), Scandal\r\nSheet (1939), and Legion of Lost Flyers (1939)…but\r\nfor most classic movie fans, her turn in Gone with the Wind (1939)\r\nremains her best-known role.  Producer Selznick took a novel approach in\r\ngiving Ona the gig—in the book, the reader gets the impression that bordello\r\nproprietor Belle Watling was stacked like a burlap bag filled with\r\nbobcats…while the actress herself was of much slighter build.  But Ona\r\nmade the role her own and was so convincing that she would later portray\r\nanother madam in the persona of “Mother Gin Sling” in the 1941 cult\r\noddity The Shanghai Gesture (directed by Josef von\r\nSternberg).  Critic Chuck Stephens described her cinematic turns in Wind and Gesture as\r\n“the defining extremes of Ona Munson’s on-screen career” in a January/February\r\n2013 essay in Film Comment, noting her performance as Mother Gin\r\nSling was “Medusa in antennae braids and hairpins of ancient jade.”Her Five\r\nStar Final co-star Edward G. Robinson tabbed her to replace Claire\r\nTrevor in the role of Lorelei Kilbourne in the hit radio drama Big\r\nTown in 1940, on which Eddie G. also starred.  Ona would\r\nappear on the program until 1942, when Robinson decided to leave the series…but\r\nshe declined to follow the show when it was revived in the fall of 1943,\r\noriginating from the East Coast.  Munson kept busy in radio; she\r\nguest-starred on such anthologies as The Screen Guild Theatre and Family\r\nTheatre, and was the host of Ona Munson in Hollywood,\r\na popular program that dished up plenty of Tinsel Town gossip.  (Ona also\r\nheadlined CBS Open House; a surviving June 19, 1949\r\nbroadcast has her conducting an interview with actor Howard Culver, the last\r\nold-time radio personality to get a birthday shout-out on the blog.)  One\r\nof Munson’s most interesting radio jobs was producing the wartime series Victory\r\nBelles, a CBS variety program that featured Mabel Todd, Martha Mears,\r\nWilhelmina Gould, and Jean Ruth Hay (a.k.a. “Beverly” of Reveille\r\nwith Beverly fame).Fittingly,\r\nOna Munson’s cinematic swan song was The Red House (1947), a\r\nmovie starring her Big Town compadre Edward G.\r\nRobinson.  While Ona gave solid performances in such films as Lady\r\nfrom Louisiana (1941—with John Wayne), Idaho (1943—with\r\nRoy Rogers), The Cheaters (1945), and Dakota (1945—another\r\nwith John Wayne), the actress suffered from turmoil in her personal life and\r\nwas in ill-health in her final years.  In spite of that, she managed\r\nto make inroads on the small screen, appearing on such TV favorites\r\nas The Armstrong Circle Theatre and Martin\r\nKane, Private Eye.  Tragically, Ona would take her own life with\r\nan overdose of barbiturates on February 11, 1955 at the age of 51…leaving\r\nbehind a note that read: “This is the only way I know to be free again…please\r\ndon’t follow me.”Despite\r\nleaving us too soon, Ona Munson left behind an amazing legacy of movie\r\nmemories; Gone with the Wind fans love her\r\nperformance as Belle in that iconic film and speaking only for myself I highly\r\nrecommend the movies she made with Edward G. Robinson, Five Star Final and The\r\nRed House.  (The Shanghai Gesture is pretty\r\nwild and way out, too.)  Here at Radio Spirits, Ona is present and\r\naccounted for in our Big Town collection, Blind Justice, featuring vintage\r\nbroadcasts from the popular newspaper drama series (including a few rarities). \r\nWe extend hearty birthday greetings to Ona…because without question, she’s the\r\ncream in our coffee.",
