        "text": "Joe E. Brown by Susan King Joe E. Brown was one of the clown jewels of movie comedy. In fact, when he died in 1973 at the age of 81, The New York Times described him as beloved. And for good reason. Brown was one of the biggest stars at Warner Bros. during the 1930s. He had this amazing mouth often referred to as the “Great Open Space” and the “Grand Canyon.” Some described him as the only man who was unable to cover his mouth when he yawned. When he opened his mouth, Brown would emit this incredible howl akin to a human siren. Depression-era audiences couldn’t get enough of that howl. Brown once said, “I’ll open my mouth until my stomach shows if people think it’s funny.”\n\nThe former circus performer and baseball player was also a human-esque Gumby – a veritable elastic man in the vein of Buster Keaton. He excelled at slapstick antics, children loved him and he could sing and dance. And, he brought his baseball prowess to the silver screen making two of the best baseball comedies: ELMER, THE GREAT (’33) and ALIBI IKE (’35). He even brushed up his Shakespeare in Warner’s all-star A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM (’35) in which he played Flute.\n\nBrown was also beloved because he was by all accounts a great guy. Little wonder that one of his hit films was A VERY HONORABLE GUY (’34). During World War II, he made the troops smile while his heart was quite literally breaking. His oldest son Captain Don Evan Brown was killed in 1942 at the age of 25 when his Douglas A-20 Havoc bomber crashed near Palm Springs. Brown decided to honor his son by entertaining the troops and often on his own dime. He estimated that he traveled some 200,000 miles visiting the troops.\n\nHe performed in all types of weather and conditions. And at one point, Brown did his show for one dying soldier in a hospital. He brought back sacks of mail from the troops and made sure the post fffice delivered the letters. When he wasn’t on tour or doing a movie, he was entertaining G.I.’s at the famed Hollywood Canteen. Brown wrote the book Your Kids and Mine about his experiences with the troops and he even earned a Bronze Star for his work.\n\nBrown ran away from his home in Holgate, Ohio, at the ripe old age of 10 to join the circus, becoming a member of the aerial acrobat troupe the Five Marvelous Ashtons who performed with the Ringling Brothers Circus. He married his wife Kathryn in 1915. (Besides their two sons, Brown and his wife adopted two refugee girls in the 1930s. And in 1939, he testified before the House Immigration Committee offering his support for a bill that would allow some 20,000 German Jewish refugee children into the U.S.)\n\nBrown eventually left the circus, hit the vaudeville circuit then moved to Broadway and made his film debut in 1928. When he signed with Warner Bros., he insisted in his contract that the studio have a baseball team for him among the employees of the studio. He was part owner of the Kansas City Blues from 1932-35, and in 1953 he was a pre-game and post-game announcer for the New York Yankees. His son Joe L. Brown even became general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1955 and held that position for over 20 years.\n\nThe actor discovered that fame can be fleeting. He left Warner Bros. and signed a contract with producer David L. Loew. The films he made for Loew including WHEN’S YOUR BIRTHDAY? (’37) were poorly received by his fans and critics and soon he was relegated to B movies. By the time he made the Technicolor Betty Grable musical PIN UP GIRL (’44), Brown had billing below the title.\n\nHowever, he won a special Tony Award in 1948 for playing the whimsical Elwood P. Dowd in the touring company of Mary Chase’s Pulitzer Prize-winning Harvey. Brown also had played the role on Broadway when original star Frank Fay left the case. In 1951, Brown gave a heartwarming performance as Cap’n Andy in MGM’s SHOW BOAT. And, most audiences know him for his delicious turn as the multi-married playboy Osgood Fielding III in Billy Wilder’s comedy masterpiece SOME LIKE IT HOT (’59) in which he delivers one of the greatest final lines. Upon learning his latest fiancée (Jack Lemmon) is actually a man, Brown quips “Well, nobody’s perfect.”\n\nHe continued working until 1964. His health started failing in the late 1960s. A stroke incapacitated him and that once athletic body was riddled with severe arthritis at the time of his death. In 1952, Brown told an interviewer that he didn’t feel he was the comedian he once had been. “A comedian has to be slightly insulting, comedy has to be 70 percent insults, and I’m always afraid today when I say something funny it may hurt someone. If another comic makes a crack about my mouth, I just can’t insult him back.”"
