        "text": "1959\n\nCity Locations\n\nCoronado, Culver City, and West Hollywood, CA\n\nLocation Types\n\nFilm Studio, Hotels/Motels\n\nLocation Styles\n\nBuilding Dated/Retro, Old Hollywood, Hotel/Motel Style, Beachfront, Sail, Luxury Hotel\n\nAbout Some Like It Hot\n\nSome Like It Hot stands as a timeless 1959 comedy masterpiece under the direction of Billy Wilder, featuring stellar performances by Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, and Marilyn Monroe. The movie is a comedic masterpiece that follows the story of two musicians, Joe (played by Tony Curtis) and Jerry (played by Jack Lemmon). They accidentally witness a mob hit in Chicago, leading them into a challenging predicament.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to evade the mob, they disguise themselves as women, adopting the names Josephine and Daphne, and join an all-female band headed for a gig in sunny Miami. As they navigate their new identities, Joe falls for the band's sultry singer, Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe), while Jerry unexpectedly attracts the attention of a smitten millionaire.\n\nThe picture is a delightful blend of farce, romance, and screwball humor, with a hint of crime drama. It addresses issues of identity and gender with wit and sensitivity, and the key actors give outstanding performances, particularly Monroe's portrayal of the naive and fragile Sugar, which is hailed as one of her best.\n\nSome Like It Hot is a critically acclaimed film with high ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. Renowned critics have lauded its comedy, craftsmanship, and overall quality, calling it a must-see classic.\n\nSome Like It Hot Locations\n\nSome Like It Hot was shot in a variety of intriguing locations, adding to the film's charm and popularity. These locations not only provided a captivating backdrop for the film but also became renowned landmarks in their own right.\n\nMost of the scenes took place in the historic Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, California. With its Victorian style and wonderful views of the water, this grand hotel on the beach served as the location for the made-up Seminole Ritz in Miami, where the all-female band performs. The picturesque Coronado Beach, which is immediately next to the hotel, added to the movie's beauty.\n\nIt's intriguing that, despite the fact that the story takes place in Florida and Chicago, California is utilized to represent both. The sequences in Chicago were shot on studio grounds in Hollywood.\n\nThese sights are undoubtedly worth seeing for anyone who likes movies, particularly classic ones. The Hotel del Coronado, a National Historic Landmark, retains much of its old-world elegance and charm, serving as a living reminder of Hollywood's golden era.\n\nIn Chicago during Prohibition, around February 1929, we meet Joe, a jazz saxophonist known for his impetuous personality and attraction to women. His pal, Jerry, is a more nervous type who plays the double bass. They both work in a speakeasy run by the notorious gangster \"Spats\" Colombo (George Raft). However, when \"Toothpick\" Charlie (George E. Stone), an informer, calls in the cops, their normal night at the joint becomes a chaotic raid.\n\nThis scene was filmed at The Lot Studios in West Hollywood, a site which offers an important part of Hollywood history. This studio used to be connected to Warner Bros. It is located at the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and North Formosa Avenue. These days, it's a busy center for the theater business, combining historic preservation with cutting-edge new technology. Warner Hollywood Studios, which has changed its name, has been around since 1920 and is still an important part of making movies and TV shows.\n\nIf you're driving, Santa Monica Boulevard makes it easy to get to The Lot Studios at 1041 N Formosa Ave, West Hollywood. For people who use public transportation, this spot is close to multiple bus lines. Check websites for public transportation in your area to find the quickest way to get where you're going. There are parking lots close by for people who are driving.\n\nIn the midst of financial disaster, terror, and a desperate urge to flee the city, Joe and Jerry adopt feminine personalities and introduce themselves as Josephine and Daphne. They intend to link up with Sweet Sue (Joan Shawlee) and her Society Syncopators, an all-female music band traveling by train to Miami. During the train voyage, they develop a friendship with Sugar Kane, the band's singer and ukulele player.\n\nThe famous American TV and movie studio building Sony Pictures Studios is in Culver City, California, and itâs where this scene was filmed. Studio tours are a popular way to see how movies are made, and the building is known for both its old and new features. People can look around at the sets and props from well-known movies and TV shows, such as Spider-Man.\n\nTravelers can easily get to Sony Pictures Studios, which is at 10202 Washington Boulevard, Culver City, CA, by taking the bus, driving, or using a ride-share service. For people coming by plane, Los Angeles International (LAX) is the closest big airport. It will take about 20 to 30 minutes to get there by car or ride-share from LAX, based on traffic. The Culver City area is also served by public buses, so the studio can be reached from many places in the city.\n\nJoe and Jerry arrive at the hotel disguised as women and members of an all-female band, attempting to preserve their cover while dealing with the challenges of their new identities. The hotel's luxurious and magnificent environment heightens the humorous tension while also providing a dramatic contrast to their previous life in frigid Chicago.\n\nThe famous Hotel del Coronado, also known as \"The Del,\" is a beachfront resort in Coronado, California. The hotel is known for its beautiful seaside charm and high-end services. It offers a unique mix of sun, sea, and timeless style. It's a famous site that has been around since 1887 and offers many things to do, such as a wellness spa, an outdoor pool, and restaurants on the water. It is truly the best place to get away to the beach.\n\nIt's easy to get to the Hotel del Coronado, which is located at 1500 Orange Avenue, Coronado, CA. San Diego International (SAN) is the closest airport if you're coming by plane. On the other hand, you can drive from downtown San Diego to get to this famous spot in 15 to 20 minutes. Buses and taxis serve the area, making it easy for people who prefer public transportation to get to The Del.\n\nJoe, under the guise of Josephine, woos Sugar Kane, the band's lead singer, on the beach near the hotel. Meanwhile, Jerry (now Daphne), attracts the attention of an eccentric millionaire (Joe E. Brown), leading to a series of hilarious misunderstandings.\n\nThe beach scene from Some Like It Hot was filmed at Coronado Beach, which consistently voted as one of America's finest beaches. This stunning stretch of sand is open from 6am to sunset, and it offers a tranquil spot for sunbathing and relaxation. Known for its family-friendly atmosphere, the beach also features volleyball courts and a dedicated area for dogs. The iconic Hotel del Coronado provides a picturesque backdrop, adding to the beach's allure.\n\nTo reach Coronado Beach in California, if flying, land at San Diego International Airport. From there, a swift 15 to 20-minute drive across the iconic Coronado Bay Bridge will lead you directly into the heart of Coronado. Alternatively, opt for a scenic ferry ride from downtown San Diego. Public transportation, including buses and shuttles, also service the area, ensuring easy access to this stunning shoreline.\n\nSome Like It Hot is a classic masterpiece that shows off many beautiful filming sites. A lot of the early action and drama takes place in the busy city of Chicago, where the movie starts. However, the sun-drenched beaches of San Diego, particularly those at the historic Hotel del Coronado, truly steal the show. The hotel really does look like a Florida getaway, which is where our main characters run away from the mob.\n\nThe movie also goes to The Lot Studios in West Hollywood, which gives it a touch of old-school Hollywood glitz. There have been a lot of movies made at this famous studio, and its part in Some Like It Hot gives the movie even more appeal.\n\nFinally, Some Like It Hot is not only a great comedy, but it's also a movie tour of some of the most famous places in America. The variety of these places adds to the story and makes the movie an unforgettable experience."
