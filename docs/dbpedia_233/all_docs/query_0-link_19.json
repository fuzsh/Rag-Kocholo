        "text": "Born: July 28 1891, Holgate, Ohio, USA\n\nDied: July 6 1973, Los Angeles, California, USA\n\nby PETER T. TATCHELL (copyright 2010)\n\nIn the early 1930s cavern-mouthed Joe E. Brown was one of Hollywood’s top comedians. The public flocked to see his homespun characters triumph over adversity using physical heroics with a large dose of slapstick.\n\nWhen he was ten years old, Evan (as he was known to his family of four brothers and two sisters) joined a circus as part of an acrobatic act called The Five Marvelous Ashtons. By 1905 the troupe was appearing at a vaudeville date in San Francisco when the city was struck by the devastating earthquake.\n\nEscaping the rubble, the youngster made his way across the country and eventually formed a double act appearing at a Coney Island music hall. His partner suggested Joe include comedy in the routines. It was an idea that would create one of the best loved clowns in show business history.\n\nBy 1920, Brown was starring as a single in a Broadway revue and his humour relied heavily on eccentric dancing and acrobatics (which on occasion included falling onto a trampoline in the orchestra pit and bouncing back on stage). Success followed success and Joe was now firmly planted in the big time.\n\nTwinkle, Twinkle, a Broadway musical satirizing the movies, led him to appear in a one-reel (Warners) Vitaphone talkie version in 1927. A year later he made a follow-up short called Don’t Be Jealous and was then signed for a series of silent features by F.B.O (a forerunner of R.K.O.).\n\nBy 1929 he was back with Warner Bros. who launched him on the road to screen popularity in adaptations of the Broadway musicals Sally, Song of the West and Hold Everything. Critics and audiences alike warmed to his style and films like Maybe It’s Love, Going Wild and You Said a Mouthful did good business at the box office.\n\nIn 1932, Joe was able to highlight his love for baseball in Fireman Save My Child and the following year he played a rookie pitcher in Elmer the Great, which turned out to be his favourite role of all.\n\nWarners kept Brown busy in front of the cameras and despite successes like Alibi Ike and Bright Lights there were a few duds along the way. Studio head Jack L. Warner apparently wasn’t pleased when his star took an extended holiday and told the press he wanted to be out of the country when his latest venture A Very Honorable Guy was due for release.\n\nAfter the 1936 movie Polo Joe Brown and Warners parted ways but Joe was quickly signed for what turned out to be lesser efforts with R.K.O., Columbia, M.G.M., Paramount and (by the 1940s) the down market Republic.\n\nIn 1938 he turned his talents to the airwaves and The Joe E. Brown Show became a Saturday night fixture on CBS for twelve months. He also appeared on stage in productions of Elmer the Great, Rio Rita and The Show Off in between movie commitments.\n\nIn early 1942 (with America now embroiled in World War 2) Joe became one of the first performers to entertain troops in Alaska, across the Pacific and eventually to the Mediterranean and many other parts of the globe. The conflict hit him personally when his eldest son was killed during a training flight with the U.S. Army Air Corps. Joe later recounted the story of his experiences in a book called Your Kids and Mine in 1944.\n\nFollowing the war Brown spent several years starring in the stage production of Harvey, initially touring in the road company version before taking over the long-running Broadway version for its final twenty weeks. Critics were surprised at his more subdued performance which avoided his usual clowning. Joe later spent a large part of 1950 taking the play to Australia and augmented his income by appearing on radio in a twice-weekly show.\n\nNow approaching his 60s, Brown found himself back in front of the movie cameras as Captain Andy in M.G.M.’s new version of the legendary musical Show Boat and in a cameo for Mike Todd’s Around the World in 80 Days. And at the end of the decade Joe all but stole the show from Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in Billy Wilder’s Some Like it Hot uttering arguably the most famous last line in movie history.\n\nAlong the way he also appeared in a regular dramatic role in the NBC television series The Buick Circus Hour for the 1952/3 season and in 1956 wrote his autobiography Laughter is a Wonderful Thing.\n\nInto the 1960s Joe E. Brown made a couple more appearances on the big screen and guest starred on the television series The Greatest Show on Earth in April 1964. Soon after, his health began to deteriorate and the clown with the gaping grin died in 1973.\n\nFilms\n\nTwinkle, Twinkle (aka In the Movies) (1927 short)\n\nDon’t Be Jealous (1928 short)\n\nCrooks Can’t Win (1928)\n\nThe Circus Kid (1928)\n\nHit Of The Show (1928)\n\nTake Me Home (1928)\n\nOn With The Show (1929)\n\nPainted Faces (1929)\n\nThe Dancing Instructor (1929 short)\n\nMolly And Me (1929)\n\nMy Lady’s Past (1929)\n\nSally (1929)\n\nSong Of The West (1930)\n\nHold Everything (1930)\n\nTop Speed (1930)\n\nLottery Bride (1930)\n\nMaybe It’s Love (1930)\n\nGoing Wild (1931)\n\nSit Tight (1931)\n\nBroad Minded (1931)\n\nHow I Play Golf #1: The Putter (1931 short)\n\nHow I Play Golf #7: Trouble Shots (1931 short)\n\nLocal Boy Makes Good (1931)\n\nFireman Save My Child (1932)\n\nYou Said A Mouthful (1932)\n\nThe Tenderfoot (1932)\n\nThe Stolen Jools (1932 short)\n\nElmer The Great (1933)\n\nSon Of A Sailor (1933)\n\nThe Circus Clown (1934)\n\nA Very Honourable Guy (1934)\n\nSix Day Bike Rider (1934)\n\nAlibi Ike (1935)\n\nBright Lights (1935)\n\nA Midsummer Night’s Dream (1935)\n\nSons O’ Guns (1936)\n\nEarthworm Tractors (1936)\n\nPolo Joe (1936)\n\nWhen’s Your Birthday?
