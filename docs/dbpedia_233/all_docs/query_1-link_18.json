        "text": "BRENTWOOD, Calif., July —Joe E. Brown, the beloved elastic‐mouth comedian, died at his home here today. He was 80 years old.\n\nMr. Brown was incapacitated by a stroke several years ago, and he had also suffered from severe arthritis.\n\nThe funeral service and burial will be Monday at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale.\n\nHe leaves his wife, Kathryn; a son, Joe L.; 2 daughters, Mrs. Kathryn Lyle and Mrs. Mary Fair; 11 grandchildren and six great‐grandchildren.\n\nBy PETER MILLONES\n\nThey referred to his mouth as the. Great Open Space, the Grand Canyon and the Mammoth Cave, and they said that he was the only man who could not cover his mouth when he yawned.\n\nJoe E. Brown just shrugged off the endless descriptions of his mouth and commented: “I'll open my mouth until my stomach shows if people think it's ftinny.”\n\nAnd the people thought it was funny. Almost from the start of his movie career, in 1928, ‘until the nineteen‐forties, his pictures were among the 10 biggest box‐office attractions.\n\nHis mouth, from which often emerged a sirenlike howl, and his comic talentS made Mr. Brown a particular favorite of the younger generation, although he never achieved the fame of Eddie Cantor with his ogling eyes or Jimmy Durante with his large nose.\n\nJoseph Evan Brown was a stanch member of the slapstick school of humor. His early career as an acrobat in circuses.tatight him to fall safely. It was not unusual for him to be wearing ‘a white suit in one of his films and to fall face down in a mud puddle.\n\nHe was forever the hapless soul—whether a soda jerk, a football player being thrown over the goal line for a lastminute touchdown, a bungling reporter, a country yokel making lemonade in a finger bowl or a rookie baseball player baffling the manager.\n\nMr. Brown loved baseball and developed several routines, including one of a young pitcher harried by batters, umpires and base runners. He used it on the stage, in the movies and on television.\n\nWhen Mr. Brown, signed long‐term contract With Warner Brothers ‘he insisted on an unusual clause that required the, company to maintain a complete baseball team for him among the employes of the studio. For a while he played with the St. Paul team. He was part owner of the Kansas City Blues from 1932 to 1935, and in 19, 53 he was a pregame and postgame announcer for the Yankees.\n\n“I once had a major league job,” Mr. Brown often said. “The manager wanted me to play third base. He said that if I couldn't reach the ball with my hands, I could open my mouth and catch it between my teeth. I tried it once and darn near swallowed the ball.”\n\nDespite the popular impression, Mr. Brown's mouth was not of extraordinary size. He had a rubbery ‘face and the apparent magnitude of his mouth was achieved by throwing back his head so that his wide‐open mouth occupied the foreground of the audience's field of vision. The movie and television cameras took full advantage of this maneuver.\n\nMr. Brown learned the humorous possibilities of his mouth by chance. He was in a play in which he had only a few words to speak—and they were not funny. He decided he would attract attention by opening his mouth as wide as possible and holding it that way until the audience was staring at it with rapt attention, believing that he had forgotten his lines and was frozen with fear.\n\nWhen he had the audience's perfect attention, he whispered his line and the audience howled. There was rarely an occasion after that that he did not seek a laugh by calling attention to the size of his mouth. His antics sometimes wore thin on adults. One critic wrote in 1938:\n\n“Pitcher‐mouthed Joe E. Brown has gone to the well once too often.”\n\nBut Mr. Brown's gift for pantomime, his Cheshire Cat grin and his interminable yawns endeared him to thousands of servicemen overseas during World War IL He estimated that he had traveled more than 200,000 air miles visiting battle theaters. That figure did not include the number of jeep miles, ‘he explained, because a jeep mile was equivalent to 15 ground miles, because of the up‐and‐down movement of the vehicle.\n\nHis antics for the men in uniform were, in part, a work born of grief. In October, 1942, his elder son, Capt. Don Evan Brown, was killed in a crash near Palm Springs, Calif,, while ferrying an Army bomber.\n\nOn Luzon, in an American advance on the town of Bambang, Mr. Brown was permitted by the commanding officer, Mal. Gen. Robert S. Beighter. to carry a carbine and to ride in the lead tank. The officer later said that the comedian had shot two of the enemy.\n\nThis made for headlines back home, but was also sharply criticized by those who pointed out that Mr. Brown was in the uniform of a noncombatant. International law forbade him to engage in any hostile action.\n\nAfter the war, he appeared in films less frequently. In 1952, he filled in once a month for Milton Berle on his television show. Mr. Brown's show was titled “Circus Hour.” The critics found little to applaud.\n\nThe show allowed Mr. Brown to hark back to his premovie days. He was born in Holgate, Ohio, July 28, 1892, and attended grammar school in Toledo, but ran away when he was 9 to join a circus. After much drudgery he became the junior member of the Five Marvelous Ashtons, a troupe of aerial acrobats that was one of the main attractions of the Ringling Brothers Circus.\n\nIn 1906, he formed the acro batic team of Bell and Brown with Tommy Bell, a star acrobat, but a perfectionist. Mr. Bell frequently expressed anger when his partner turned a fraction of an inch too much, though audiences could not tell.\n\nOn one occasion, Mr. Bell tossed his partner high into the air, then uttered a low groan at Mr. Brown's imperfect movements and started walking off the stage. He was supposed to catch Mr. Brown, but didn't Mr. Brown hit the stage and broke a leg.\n\n“I warned you,” Mr. Bell said.\n\nMr. Brown married Kathryn McGraw in 1915. He went into burlesque in 1918. Before long, he appeared on Broadway in the hit “Listen Lester,” and was soon an established star.\n\nHe appeared in “Jim Jam Jems,” “Greenwich Village Follies,” “Betty Lee,” “Captain Jinks,” and “Twinkle, Twinkle,” and in the road company of “Elmer the Great.” In 1928 he started his movie career in melodrama, “Crooks Can't Win.”\n\nIn the next two decades, he appeared in about 50 films. They included: “The Gladiator,” “Wide Open Faces,” “Riding on Air,” “Sons o’ Guns,” “Earthworm Tractors,” “Six Day Bike Rider,” “Going Wild,” “Sit Tight,” “Alibi Ike,” “The Circus Clown,” “You said a Mouthful,” “Chatterbox,” “Pin Up Girl,” and “Hollywood Canteen.”\n\nIn 1959 he appeared as a millionaire in “Some Like It Hot,” with Marilyn Monroe. Mr. Brown considered his most succcessful movies to be “Elmer the Great” and “Hold Everything.” They involved roles in which his intimate knowledge of the circus, stage and sports aided him greatly.\n\nHe also appeared as Flute in “A Midsummer Night's Dream.” He contended later that he had never heard of Shakespeare. Hollywood laugh clockers reported that the best audience reaction followed his line, “I won't play any more.” This was not written by Shakespeare, but was ad libbed by Mr. Brown after he was thrown into a lake.\n\nMr. Brown was a big hit on the campus of the University of California at Los Angeles, when his sons, Don and Joe L. were there. The senior Brown joined a fraternity, although he was nearly 50 years old. He was a sparkplug of campus activities, including pep rallies and football games.\n\nJoe L., became general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1955, which gave his father another opportunity to deal personally with the game he loved."
