        "text": "ISBN 9781629337388\n\nJoe E. Brown was the most popular movie comedian in the 1930s, his films being bigger moneymakers than those featuring Laurel and Hardy, W.C. Fields, or The Marx Brothers. A regrettable business decision in the middle of the decade resulted in indie productions that relegated Joe to second-feature status. After losing a son in World War Two, Joe became a tireless entertainer for servicemen all over the world, resulting in his becoming one of two civilians during that time to be awarded the Bronze Star. His movie career effectively over by the 1950s, Joe took a supporting part in Billy Wilder’s Some Like it Hot, which ended up becoming the movie by which he remains best known. This book is a film-by-film look at his movies, from his early 1930s heyday through his B movies in the late 30s and early 40s, and finally his film career’s conclusion, only to be reborn with a handful of small parts in the 50s and 60s. Along with his work, this book will deal with Brown’s baseball enthusiasm, his kindness to others, and his lasting legacy.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nJames L. Neibaur is a film historian and educator who has appeared in video documentaries, given DVD commentaries, contributed several articles to the Encyclopedia Britannica and has authored over 30 published books.\n\nComedian Joe E. Brown...a reel baseball hero"
