        "text": "Ruby Catherine Stevens (aka “Barbara Stanwyck”) was born 113 years ago, on July 16, 1907. She had a very difficult childhood. At the age of 4, Ruby lost her mother to a streetcar accident. A drunk pushed her mother, then pregnant, off a moving streetcar. She subsequently miscarried, and died from the complications. Two weeks after Ruby’s mother’s funeral, her father joined a work crew digging the Panama Canal, bailed on his children, and was never seen again.\n\nRuby and her older brother, Byron, were taken in and raised by their eldest sister, Mildred. When Mildred obtained a job as a showgirl, Ruby and Byron were placed in foster care. Ruby ran away often from the multitude of foster homes she was placed in. In 1916 and 1917, when she was 9 and 10, Ruby spent her summers touring with her sister Mildred. It was this period in her life that influenced Ruby’s decision to pursue acting. At the age of 14, Ruby dropped out of school and started working.\n\nIn 1923, Ruby started her career as a chorus girl at the Strand Roof, the club on top of the Strand Theater in Times Square. She also spent two seasons as a dancer in the Ziegfeld Follies. In 1926, through her chorus girl work, Ruby was discovered and asked to play a chorus girl in the upcoming Broadway play, The Noose. The Noose was very successful, running for over nine months! It was during this period when Ruby Catherine Stevens received her new stage name: Barbara Stanwyck.\n\nAfter a couple years being a star on Broadway, Barbara screen-tested for the 1927 silent film, Broadway Nights. She did not win the leading part, but did make her screen debut, as a fan dancer, in the film. In 1929, Stanwyck appeared in her first sound film, The Locked Door. In 1930, Frank Capra selected Barbara for the lead in his film, Ladies of Leisure. This film served as the catalyst for Barbara’s film career. Between 1930 and 1933, Barbara starred in many memorable pre-code* films: Night Nurse (1931), So Big! (1932), and The Bitter Tea of General Yen (1933).\n\n*Pre-Code refers to the period between the advent of sound pictures (1929) and the implementation of the Hayes Production Code (mid-1934). Pre-Code films are known for their racy, controversial themes. Many of these films deal with premarital sex, abortion, promiscuity, violence, homosexuality, and many other themes.\n\nIn 1933, Barbara was on a roll, careerwise. This is the year she would make her star-making film, Baby Face. Just before Baby Face, however, Barbara appeared in one of my favorite pre-code films: Ladies They Talk About.\n\nFull disclosure, I love movies about ladies in prison. Well, actually I should amend that to I love seeing older films about ladies in prison. Some of the newer, more exploitative women in prison films, I wouldn’t have an interest in. In Ladies They Talk About, Barbara plays Nan Taylor, the sole female member of a gang of bank robbers. At the beginning of the film, Nan poses as a regular customer and distracts the security guard while her accomplices rob the bank. She ends up being arrested by a cop who recognizes her from a previous arrest. Nan is sentenced to prison and placed in the San Quentin State Prison.\n\nSan Quentin State Prison is an interesting place. The women are housed on one side, the men on the other. There is only a wall separating the two groups. On the ladies’ side of the prison, the women are given cute uniforms. Nan’s prison uniform is of course tailored to her perfectly and shows off her great figure. The prison also gives each woman her own cell, which she’s allowed to decorate to her liking.\n\nThe ladies play cards, do each others’ hair, and pursue other activities to pass the time. Meanwhile, Nan’s accomplices, the men, are housed on the other side of the prison, directly on the other side of the wall. Lefty, one of the members of Nan’s gang managed to avoid arrest. Through their weekly visits, Lefty and Nan scheme to break herself and Don (housed in the men’s prison) out. Nan is tasked with drawing a map of the layout of the women’s prison and making an impression of the matron key.\n\nGetting the impression of the matron’s key is absurdly easy, as the matron (Ruth Donnelly) basically does everything but make the impression herself. Nan talks the Matron up about her key ring and the Matron lets her see each and every key, and provides details as to which key goes to which lock. With all the necessary tools in place, Nan and Don are ready to make their escape.\n\nThis movie is a lot of fun. Besides the ridiculous women’s prison, you can’t go wrong with an escape from prison plot. Stanwyck is fantastic as are the supporting cast members. I also love the Matron’s cockatoo. This film isn’t nearly as stressful or sadistic as Caged! (1950), which I also loved. Donnelly’s Matron is an absolute saint compared to Hope Emerson’s portrayal that will come 17 years later. There is a scene where a woman prisoner sings a love song to a photograph of Joe E. Brown. Joe E. Brown!\n\nThis movie has a strange ending. I won’t divulge it here. After watching it though, you’ll think: “What was that ending?”\n\nSo far, this film only seems to be available on the 5th volume of the Forbidden Hollywood collection.\n\n“I’m Daphne!”\n\nAnd thus begins one of the all-time funniest screen performances. Jack Lemmon, who landed the role of Jerry/Daphne in Some Like it Hot after Jerry Lewis turned it down (thank goodness), delivers an Oscar-nominated performance and frankly, just one of the best portrayals ever to grace the silver screen. His little cackles, facial expressions, mannerisms, everything he implements to create “Daphne,” are fantastic. He makes the film. Without him, it might have been funny, but not hysterical. Don’t get me wrong, co-stars Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis and Joe E. Brown had their moments, but Some Like it Hot belongs to Jack Lemmon.\n\nIn other hands, like original choice Jerry Lewis’ for example, the role of Daphne could have easily evolved into something absurd and obnoxious. Lemmon’s portrayal is absurd, but in a good way. What makes his portrayal so successful is that he commits to the role. He is in no way self conscious about dressing in drag. What makes his introduction of Daphne so funny is how he suddenly embraces his persona while being introduced to Sweet Sue. Jerry and Joe had already agreed that they would be Geraldine and Josephine, respectively, and suddenly Jerry blurts out “Daphne.” “I never did like the name Geraldine,” he says. His enthusiasm is a contrast to the scene just a minute prior where complains about his outfit and shoes and then sees lead singer, Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe), walk down the train platform and is disillusioned that their charade is even going to work.\n\nJERRY: “Look at that. Look how she moves. That’s just like Jell-O on springs. They must have some sort of built-in motor or something. I tell ya, it’s a whole different sex.”\n\nThe train ride from Chicago to Miami is one of the funniest scenes in the film. Jerry is painfully aware that he’s supposed to be a woman–an awareness that only gets more cumbersome when he’s partying with a dozen girls inside his upper berth. When Sugar invites herself into his “room” (if you can call it that), he has to remind himself “I’m a girl. I’m a girl” only to lament, “I wish I were dead.”\n\nAnother of my favorite scenes is when Sweet Sue (the band manager) emphatically states “There are two things I will not put up with during working hours: liquor and men!” To which Jerry (as Daphne), who has completely embraced his female alter ego (and is bordering on trying too hard to be believable as a woman), says:\n\nJERRY: “We wouldn’t be caught dead with men! Rough, hairy beasts with eight hands. And they all just want one thing from a girl!”\n\nThe funniest part of that exchange is the disgusted look he makes afterward. Pretty much everything “Daphne” says is hilarious.\n\nThe best part of Some Like it Hot is Daphne’s budding romance with Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown), the oft-married (and oft-divorced) mama’s boy millionaire, who spends his time hanging out at the Seminole Ritz Hotel in Miami, always looking for his next ex-wife. When Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopaters enter the hotel lobby, Osgood immediately has his sights set for Daphne. While the subplot featuring the budding romance between Shell Oil-heir “Junior” (Tony Curtis doing his Cary Grant impression) and Sugar is amusing, the Daphne/Osgood courtship is comedy gold.\n\nWhile the audience and Jerry know that this relationship has no future, watching the millionaire become more and more enamored with Daphne is hysterical. The tango scene where they literally tango until dawn (originally meant as a scheme for Joe bring Sugar to rendezvous in Osgood’s yacht, without Osgood being present, of course). Jerry is really into their dancing and is having the time of his life. The tango night leads to Osgood proposing to Jerry and giving him a diamond bracelet as an engagement present. The scene where Jerry announces his engagement is one of the best parts of the film:\n\nJOE: “What happened?”\n\nJERRY: “I’m engaged.”\n\nJOE: “Congratulations. Who’s the lucky girl?”\n\nJERRY: “I am!”\n\nJOE: “What?”\n\nJERRY: “Osgood proposed to me. We’re planning a June wedding.”\n\nJOE: “What are you talking about? You can’t marry Osgood.”\n\nJERRY: “Do you think he’s too old for me?”\n\nWhen Joe tries to talk some sense into Jerry by asking the obvious question (well obvious in 1959 that is), “why would a guy want to marry a guy?” Jerry answers, “Security.” Then goes on to say:\n\nJERRY: “I don’t expect it to last. I’ll tell him the truth when the time comes.”\n\nJOE: “Like when?”\n\nJERRY: “Like right after the ceremony. Then we get a quick annulment, he makes a nice settlement on me and I keep gettin’ those alimony checks every month.”\n\nThroughout this entire scene, Jerry is shaking maracas and humming the tango. He is excited about his proposal, even though he knows that he can’t really marry Osgood. Though as someone who hocked his overcoat to gamble money on a dog at the track (and lost), the prospect of being financially secure is probably an enticing one and he’s probably considering it, even though realistically, it can’t happen. Jerry’s maracas weren’t originally in the script; however, they were added after preview audiences laughed so hard that much of Jerry’s dialogue was lost. Director Billy Wilder added the pauses and maracas and re-shot the scene so that the humor and the dialogue would remain intact.\n\nThe ending scene between Jerry and Osgood is one of the funniest (and most perfect endings) in film. The moment has come when Jerry really needs to come clean about his true identity and call off the engagement. He tries to hint to Osgood the reason why he can’t marry him:\n\nOsgood wants Jerry to wear his mother’s wedding gown:\n\nJERRY: “I can’t get married in your mother’s dress…she and I, we are not built the same way.”\n\nOSGOOD: “We can have it altered.”\n\nJerry tries again:\n\nJERRY: “I’m not a natural blonde.”\n\nOSGOOD: “Doesn’t matter.”\n\nJERRY: “I smoke. I smoke all the time!”\n\nOSGOOD: “I don’t care.”\n\nJERRY: “I have a terrible past. For three years, I’ve been living with a saxophone player.”\n\nOSGOOD: “I forgive you.”\n\nJERRY: “I can never have children.”\n\nOSGOOD: “We can adopt some.”\n\nExasperated, Jerry finally lays it all out on the table:\n\nJERRY: “I’m a man”\n\nThen, one of the greatest lines and endings of all time:\n\nOSGOOD: “Well, nobody’s perfect.”\n\nHow will Jerry ever get out of this mess?\n\nNothing to do with Jack Lemmon, but this is one of my favorite lines from “Some Like it Hot,”\n\nDOLORES: Have you heard the one about the one-legged jockey?\n\n…then later, we hear the punchline…\n\nDOLORES: “Don’t worry about me baby, I ride side-saddle!”"
