        "text": "Pre-Code.Com Site News for July 2016\n\nHey everyone! My June was completely nuts– I had friends visit, summer semester started, I went to Alaska for two weeks (with no internet), and my beloved dog, Chico, passed away. My plans for July are school and possibly faking my own death so nothing like June ever happens to me again, but we’ll see.\n\nI will be taking off from posting next week for my usual birthday celebration (33, woop woop) and the rest of the month I have reviews of a few early John Wayne films as well as a few books as I participate in Raquel’s Summer Reading Challenge. This will include at least a few books by other bloggers and possibly way too many books on Barbara Stanwyck, but you’ll see as we go.\n\nAugust will have a bunch of random movies and then the newest issue of The Pre-Code Companion! I’m currently editing the pieces now, and I think everyone will be happy with the stuff we’ve got.\n\nLastly, TCM in July is doing about fifteen different programs on all sorts of topics, so there’s not a lot of room for pre-Code. A number of great ones still pop up– Queen Christina, The Nuisance— but most of the list below is Joe E. Brown movies that are all being shown on the 28th. C’est la vie.\n\nPre-Code Hollywood Movies on TCM in July\n\nPlease note: All times are Eastern. This schedule is subject to change. See the full listings here.
