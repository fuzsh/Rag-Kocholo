        "text": "In about a half-hour, the portion of today’s TCM Summer Under the Stars tribute to the late, great actress-comedienne Thelma Todd that I’ve looking forward to since May will get underway—the channel kicks off with approximately three hours of classic Charley Chase two-reel comedies that feature “Hot Toddy” as his leading lady. The actual ToddFest started this a.m. at 6am with the Joe E. Brown feature film Broadminded (1931), but since I grabbed that last month during Brown’s birthday tribute I wasn’t going to have to technically rise and shine until 7:15am when Son of a Sailor (1933) comes on. But in digging through my recorded-off-of-TCM DVDs to find my copy of The Freshman (for some odd reason, my Region 2 copy stubbornly refuses to cooperate in the player) I learned that I already had Sailor, which means I didn’t have to be wide awake until 8:30. Then I remembered that with no need to re-record Sailor, I could grab the Gunsmoke episode “Catawomper” at 7am.\n\n(I didn’t realize I already had Sailor and would have recorded it again had I not stumbled across it by accident. But this is a two-way street. I neglected to record The Ruling Class [1972] Saturday because I thought I already had it…and as it turns out I didn’t. What I essentially need is a secretary around this place.)\n\nThe lineup of Chase shorts is as follows:\n\n08:30am The Real McCoy (1930)\n\n09:00am Whispering Whoopee (1930)\n\n09:30am Dollar Dizzy (1930)\n\n10:00am High C’s (1930)\n\n10:30am The Pip from Pittsburg (1931)\n\n11:00am The Nickel Nurser (1932)\n\nTwo Wheeler & Woolsey features follow the Chase comedies—Hips, Hips, Hooray! (1934; 11:30am) and Cockeyed Cavaliers (1934; 12:45pm). I’ve already recorded Hips except that the end credits were lopped off, and Cavaliers (my favorite W&W comedy) I purchased off eBay but I’m curious to see if I can record a better copy. Since these two movies run approximately an hour-and-a-fifteen minutes each, that means I can try to make some headway on this week’s Mayberry Mondays installment (which I started last night).\n\nFrom 2-5pm are the Todd/ZaSu Pitts shorts, and then the Todd/Patsy Kelly comedies follow from 5-8pm:\n\n02:00pm Catch as Catch Can (1931)\n\n02:30pm Red Noses (1932)\n\n03:00pm Show Business (1932)\n\n03:30pm Asleep in the Feet (1933)\n\n04:00pm Maids a la Mode (1933)\n\n04:30pm The Bargain of the Century (1933)\n\n05:00pm Soup and Fish (1934)\n\n05:30pm One Horse Farmers (1934)\n\n06:00pm Opened by Mistake (1934)\n\n06:30pm Sing, Sister, Sing (1935)\n\n07:00pm Hot Money (1935)\n\n07:30pm Top Flat (1935)\n\nAnd after this—it’s smooth sailing for the rest of the evening. I already have both of the Marx Brothers-Todd films, Monkey Business (1931; 8pm) and Horse Feathers (1932; 9:30pm), and the two features Thel did with Stan & Ollie, The Devil’s Brother (1933; 12:15am) and The Bohemian Girl (1936; 2am). I’ll need to tape Another Fine Mess (1930; 10:45pm)—don’t know why I don’t have it, but I don’t—and I may grab Chickens Come Home (1931; 11:30pm) just to be on the safe side. After that, I’ll program the player to grab Mary Stevens, M.D. (1933) at 4:45am before hitting the hay.\n\nI know what you’re saying—I could go ahead and just program the player for all of these shorts. But many of these comedies run 20-22 minutes in a half-hour slot…which means I’d have to endure eight minutes of things like Ben Mankiewicz shilling the TCM iPhone app (“How cool is that!”). It’s all in the editing, good people.\n\nI guess what I’m trying to say in my typically long-winded fashion is…if anybody calls today, I’m in conference."
