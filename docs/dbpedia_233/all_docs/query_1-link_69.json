        "meta_description": "At the tender age of 10, Joseph Evan Brown joined a troupe of circus tumblers in his native Ohio. He gradually added comedy into his act and transformed himself into a comedian. In the 1920's he moved to Broadway to pursue an acting career and began making films by late 1928. A year later he signed with, and started making films for, Warner Brothers where he quickly shot to stardom after appearing in a first all-color, all-talking musical comedy. By the 1930's he had become one of the top ten earners in film. Brown was a sports enthusiast both in film and his personal life. In 1953, he became a television and radio broadcaster for the New York Yankees. In 1973, just three weeks short of his 81st birthday, Brown died of a stroke in Brentwood, California. Joe E. Brown received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which is located at 1680 Vine Street.Exterior view of actor, comedian Joe E. Brown's residence, a beautiful two-story home located in an unidentified area of Los Angeles, which shows ivy-covered walls.",
