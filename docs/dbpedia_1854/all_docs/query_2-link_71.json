        "text": "RACHEL ASHENDEN\n\n‘I was born a female human animal’: Female and Animal Hybridity in Leonora Carrington’s\n\n“The Debutante”\n\nThis paper uses Leonora Carrington’s short story ‘The Debutante’ (1940) as a focus for\n\nexamining the surrealist negotiation of the boundaries of human and animal, masculine and\n\nfeminine, nature and culture. It sets Carrington’s battle with femininity in the context of\n\nsurrealism as a movement founded on male subordination of women’s artistic capacity.\n\nSituated on the periphery of surrealism, which feminists regard as ‘the radical other of\n\nmodernism’, Carrington created female-hybrid creatures in her painting and prose – always\n\npart human, part beast – to escape fixed constructions of femininity. I will read Carrington’s\n\nemployment of the female-hybrid amidst women’s lost sense of physical wholeness in the\n\nsurrealism cultural movement. Carrington responds to the male surrealists’ fragmentation and\n\nsexualisation of women’s bodies in their artwork by undermining bodily and psychic fixity.\n\nThis paper will therefore be interdisciplinary, reading ‘The Debutante’ alongside\n\nhypermasculine renditions of women as mythical creatures and sexualised objects.\n\nCarrington’s tool of changeable hybridity is predicated on the surrealist idea of\n\nmetamorphosis as a metaphor for physical transformation in which new identities can\n\nbecome manifest. In ‘The Debutante’, this takes the form of a hyena disguised as a maid. The\n\nstory presents a young female protagonist who, due to present herself at a ball in her honour,\n\ncolludes with a hyena to take her place. My reading will make a comparison between animal\n\nand cultural constructions of femininity, to reach a conclusion that Carrington combines\n\nconflicting identities in order to counter the notion that the female self is a fixed monolithic\n\nstructure grounded in hierarchical oppositions.\n\nBIO\n\nLast year Rachel graduated from my Masters in ‘Modernities’ at Glasgow University,\n\nfollowing my undergraduate degree at Exeter University in English Literature. Rachel runs a\n\nfeminist project called ‘Women Surrealists’, which reclaims the hidden artistic legacies of\n\nwomen who contributed greatly to the movement.

They hop, listen, hop, listen, never seem to eat.’ At the time, Beckett\n\nwas translating his 1951 novel Malone Dies into English, in which birds feature\n\nprominently. Its narrator spends a great deal of the start of the novel selecting the\n\nfinal stories he will tell within the time remaining to him, eventually deciding: ‘I think I\n\nshall be able to tell myself four stories, each one on a different theme. One about a\n\nman, another about a woman, a third about a thing and finally one about an animal,\n\na bird probably.’ A boy, Sapo, features in one of these stories. Malone gives him pale\n\nblue eyes and notes that ‘he loved the flight of the hawk and could distinguish it from\n\nall others’, but in agitation later says ‘I don’t like those gull’s eyes. They remind me of\n\nan old shipwreck.’ Birds in flight are associated with keen eyesight and the passage\n\nof time in several other works, including the early 1960s story ‘Fizzles 3: Afar a bird.’\n\nThe symbolic insubstantiality of birds seen from a distance collides with the clumsily\n\ngrounded and rather less poetic variety in the 1957 novella From an Abandoned\n\nWork, to the frustration of its narrator:\n\nBirds with my piercing sight I have seen flying so high, so far, that they\n\nseemed at rest, then the next minute they were all about me, crows have\n\ndone this. Ducks are perhaps the worst, to be suddenly stamping and\n\nstumbling in the midst of ducks, or hens, any class of poultry, few things are\n\nworse.\n\nThis talk draws on the work of Thom van Dooren, John Wilson Foster, Carrie\n\nRohman, Kari Weil, and Beckett and Animals, the 2013 collection of essays featuring\n\na chapter on parrots in his writing. Having surveyed what might be described as\n\nBeckett’s ‘bird period’ of the 1950s and 60s, I will concentrate on the 1960 play\n\nHappy Days, his most acute representation of the avian. Trapped up to her waist in\n\nthe first act of the play, Winnie, the bird-like protagonist, wears a hat with a crumpled\n\nfeather, fixates on the broad open expanse of sky that dwarfs her, uses her hands to\n\npeck at anything within reach, and flutters her arms like useless wings. The play\n\nends with her trapped up to her neck, singing. I will suggest that Winnie is a sentinel\n\ncreature whose warnings are ignored: the unnamed catastrophe that haunts the play\n\nbut is never named becomes frighteningly tangible during her periodic moments of\n\ncollapse.\n\nBIO\n\nDr Julie Bates is an Assistant Professor in the School of English in Trinity College\n\nDublin.

Animal figures and animality are a crucial to that relationship, and to the critical concept of ferality that informs my investigation of McKay’s work. Published in 1933, and featuring a Jamaican protagonist educated and cultivated abroad in colonial schools, the novel presents an ambivalent and often vexed relationship with notions of home and belonging. I show that McKay’s narrative challenges superficial definitions of racial identity that engage stereotypical\n\nmodernist oppositions of the black (animalized) savage and the cultured white human. Reading\n\nMcKay alongside Frantz Fanon, whose work on postcolonial phenomenology blurs the\n\ndistinction between specific and universal experience, I argue that McKay acknowledges such\n\nfacile racializations and disrupts them by crafting an aspirational narrative of humanism that\n\nenfolds animality, primitive magic, and Western intellectual history. Such utopian ideals never\n\npresented themselves in McKay’s lifetime, revealing the double bind of McKay’s feral\n\nmodernism: in bringing together these seemingly disparate identifications, McKay’s novel thus\n\npresents the character’s “home” of Banana Bottom as an amalgamation of desires that are\n\nimaginable but unrealizable, a tension paralleled by a domestic that is close at hand and yet\n\npainfully out of reach. Neither polemic nor conservative, the novel creates spaces to engage in\n\nquestions without formulating answers, surfacing a productive un-decidability that is at the heart\n\nof feral modernism.\n\nBIO\n\nLauren Benjamin is a PhD candidate in the departments of Comparative Literature and English\n\nLanguage and Literature with a certificate in Judaic Studies. Her dissertation, Feral\n\nModernisms, uses the concept of the feral animal to show that home in modernist literature is\n\nconceived in terms of domination and entrapment, longing and belonging, precarity and\n\npermanence.

BOWMAN\n\nAnimal Waste: Muckraking in Upton Sinclair\n\nAs the term ‘muckraking’ was first introduced in the opening decade of the twentieth century to describe a scandalous form of investigative journalism, the concept of waste was becoming a pejorative byword in American society. Whether understood as the inefficient use of time and resources, or the biological output of all living creatures (faeces), waste was a blotch on civilised human society. Attempting to banish what Cecelia Tichi terms the ‘industrial-era devil,’ modern technology was called upon to eliminate waste from inefficient and out-dated systems limited by the power of animals, both human and nonhuman. Efficiency was thus understood in relation to waste as clean is to dirty; mechanised production is to manual labour; civilised is to primitive; human is to animal. Machine technology, in this conventional arrangement, acts as a force which confirms human exceptionalism by reducing humanity’s contact with waste, interposing between ‘clean’ civilisation and ‘dirty’ nature. However, the use of this same technology for capitalistic gain is in fact premised upon the production of waste at unprecedented levels, whilst diversifying and rendering such waste invisible to ‘civilised’ society. The purpose of this paper is to explore how notorious muckraker Upton Sinclair (1878 – 1968) brings this waste to light through characters who do society’s dirty work (including literal muck raking), using examples from the oil fields of Oil! (1927) and the Chicago packing houses of The Jungle (1904) to unpack the conventional understanding of the relationship between humanity, animality, waste, and technology in the modernist period.\n\nBIO\n\nDaniel J Bowman is a PhD candidate in English Literature at the University of Sheffield, in his home town. After receiving funding from the White Rose College of Arts and Humanities, he is currently working on his thesis entitled Horsepower: Animals in Automotive Culture, 1895-1935. Daniel’s research is concerned with literary representations of animality and technology in the modernist period, with particular emphasis on the impact of early automotive culture on the lives of animals (both human and nonhuman).\n\n​\n\nMONIKA BREGOVIĆ\n\n‘The Fisherman Sunk in Dreams’: Fish and Artistic Imagination in Virginia Woolf’s Work\n\nVirginia Woolf’s fiction and non-fiction is permeated by images of water,\n\npopulated by fish, crayfish, sharks, or whales. Among Woolf’s water-creatures the image\n\nof the fish, plunging into the abyss, or darting to the surface, remains closely linked to\n\nthe author’s conception of artistic imagination. In Professions for Women she compares\n\nthe (female) artist to a “fisherman lying sunk in dreams”, fishing in “dark places where\n\nthe largest fish slumber”. In A Room of One’s Own she describes her flight of imagination\n\nbeing broken by the Beadle who drove her off the Oxbridge lawn, interrupting her line of\n\nthought, and sending her “little fish” into hiding. In Mrs Dalloway, Woolf again links\n\nartists to water-dwellers by labeling them with the idiom ‘queer fish’. Mircea Eliade\n\ndescribes water as the supreme symbol of creation and potentiality: it dissolves and\n\nbreaks up all forms, but also offers new knowledge and insight. Creatures associated\n\nwith it – fish, dolphins, shell-fish – enjoy its powers, sharing them with those they come\n\ninto contact (Patterns in Comparative Religion, 1958). To go back to Virginia Woolf, the\n\nimage of the fisherman fishing for creatures hidden in the depths of the sea is therefore\n\ncomparable to the artist’s waiting for creative inspiration, the ‘fish’ that animates their\n\nimagination. In this presentation, I analyze the image of fish in Virginia Woolf’s novels\n\nand essays, and its significance for her concept of artistic imagination. What are the\n\nprerequisites for artistic imagination, and how is imagination linked to inspiration? How\n\ndoes the artist externalize their vision?\n\nBIO\n\nDr. Monika Bregović graduated in English Language and Literature and Comparative\n\nLiterature from the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb in\n\n2008.

Paying close attention to nonhuman animals in\n\nViktor Shklovsky’s writings, I propose a new critical perspective which places Formalist\n\ntheories of arts and literature in dialogue with early twentieth-century advances in biomedical\n\nsciences, zoology, and experimental biology. When Shklovsky famously coined the term\n\nostranenie (“defamiliarization” or “estrangement”) in a 1917 essay “Art as Device,” he\n\nsuggested that seeing from the perspective of a nonhuman animal could correct the\n\nshortcomings of human perception. Unlike automatized human perception that relies on\n\nrecognition and habitually produces stagnant art forms, nonhuman cognition promises to\n\nequip artists with the ability to bypass preconceived notions about the world and provide their\n\naudiences with alternative ways of experiencing reality.\n\nI propose to examine the cultural and scientific background of Shklovsky’s theory that, in\n\nproviding the means of recreating the perspective of a nonhuman animal, literature is capable\n\nof correcting human perception. In particular, I place it within a broader trend in biomedical\n\nresearch which attempted to cure the insufficiencies of human bodies with the transplantation\n\nof animal organs and by administering animal excretions, such as Pavlov’s much publicised\n\n“natural gastric juice of a dog.” Both Shklovsky’s theory and his creative practice suggest\n\nthat inter-species empathy is instrumental not only in questions of ethics (such as animal\n\nconfinement, animal ownership, and breeding practices), but also in creating new neural\n\nconnections in the brain.\n\nBIO\n\nAsiya Bulatova is a research fellow at the University of Warsaw within the Marie\n\nSkłodowska-Curie programme POLONEZ.

Images of carnivorism continue to pervade the entirety of the text and are\n\nalmost always accompanied by expressions of masculine sexual desire. It is Joyce’s frank\n\nrepresentation of the human body and sexuality in particular which has become the site of\n\nmany of the text’s claims to a certain feminist, or more broadly progressive sensibility. Ulysses\n\noccupies the privileged status of modernist masterwork, representing for many a break with\n\naesthetic tradition concurrent with a certain social liberation of the human subject. However, I\n\nwould like to contend that approaching the text from an animal studies perspective, specifically\n\nthrough the concept of the carnophallogocentric, offers a more nuanced reading of the extent\n\nof Ulysses’s cultural subversion.\n\nIn my paper I intend to deploy the carnophallogocentric as first introduced by Derrida,\n\nand later elaborated by feminist thinker Carol Adams in order to bring to light the limits of\n\nUlysses’s as an exemplar of “freeing” literary sexuality. I argue that Joyce’s unabashed\n\ntreatment of sexuality remains inextricable from the patriarchal superstructure through its\n\nreliance on metaphors of carnivorous appetite. Finally, I will attempt to reconcile contemporary\n\nreadings of the text’s appropriation of animality with the reality of its complicity in the\n\ninterdependent subjugation of women and animals.\n\nBIO\n\nDevon Clifton is a doctoral student in the English department at Brown University.

This era witnessed the emergence of the RSPCA, anti-vivisection movements, and increased calls for moral concern towards animals. The fictionalized “animal autobiography,” most notably represented by Anna Sewell’s Black Beauty (1877), emerged as a prominent mode to protest animal cruelty by providing animals with a voice and depicting them as beings of consciousness and self-hood. My paper explores “The Animal Story” as a literary genre which influenced the modern imagination and traces the shift from seeing animals as objects – as machines, bodies to be used, and exploited things – to what Tom Regan terms “subjects-of-a-life.”\n\nUsing Sewell’s Ginger and Canadian Ernest Thompson Seton’s Lobo, from his collection Wild Animals I Have Known (1898), as my primary case studies, I posit that these literary animal stories offer an insight into the psychological, emotional, and mental states of animals. In this paper, I am particularly interested in how these narratives draw attention to the effects of familial bonds, trauma, and past experiences on character and mental state. I analyze Seton’s “realistic animal stories” alongside Sewell by examining what he calls the “personal histories” of wild animals. Using different methodologies, both writers nevertheless call into question the rights of animals, their relationships with humans, and ultimately their status as complex, conscious beings. In exploring Seton’s and Sewell’s works, I demonstrate how the “The Animal Story” can be understood as a genre that problematizes traditional conceptions of animal psychology and the notion that human beings are unique in being capable of experiencing and negotiating violence and trauma.\n\nBIO\n\nLauren Cullen is a doctoral candidate in English Literature at the University of Oxford.

Latter-day documentaries such as Life on Earth (1979), Trials of Life (1990), Life in Cold Blood (2008), Life (2009), and Life Story (2014) also remind us of the play inherent in the story of ‘life’ – as both a marker of the deeply private, uniquely held experience, and as a name for the widest of environmental processes. The nature documentary doubles these meanings into a personal and public life-writing of the Earth – a kind of surveillance of the clandestine encounters of both self and world. This paper will explore the nature documentary as a technology that can carry multiple “life” meanings, as well as life forms. I will explore these crossing contours of life writing and science writing to show how the (zoo-)biographical acts of nature documentary collide and cross-contaminate across this unstable signifier.\n\nBIO\n\nDr. Amy Cutler is a cultural geographer, film-maker, and live performer who works with ideas of geography and nonhuman others.

H. Munro\n\n(pen-name Saki). Being generally read as satirical critique of Edwardian society, Saki’s\n\nstories are populated with all kinds of animals—free-roaming hyenas, domesticated\n\ncompanion species, as well as livestock and zoo animals. Nevertheless, Saki’s oeuvre has\n\nonly received marginal scholarly attention over the years and, if addressed by literary critics,\n\nis mostly regarded through the lens of social satire. From this focal point, the animals of\n\nSaki’s stories are regarded as an externalisation of the beastliness of (especially upper-class) human society, a mirror reflecting human animality back at readers, an attempt to make visible the restrictions of social order through the creation of a “vindictive zoology” (Salemi\n\n430). While I would not venture so far as to claim that Saki’s stories present a straightforward proto-critique of anthropocentrism or speciesism, I would argue that the relations of co-existence between humans and animals in the short stories are much more complex than generally acknowledged. Thus, for example, The Music on the Hill presents a contrast between the power of nature and the alienation experienced in modern society, and The Stalled Ox can be read as a critique of the commodification of animals for material gains and a comment about an emergent meat industry replacing the hunting games of the English gentry. In this paper, I want to investigate this complexity by paying attention to the intersections between nonhuman animals, humanity and emergent cultural discourses around Darwinism, psychoanalysis and Marxism.\n\nBIO\n\nJulia Ditter is a Master student in British and North American Cultural Studies at the\n\nUniversity of Freiburg.

Though they span nearly a century, they all\n\nfollow essentially the same plot: stray dogs, or in the case of Dog Boy, stray dog figures, are\n\nremoved from the street and used for the sake of science. Sharik in The Heart of a Dog is lured\n\nby a scientist to undergo a brain transplant; Laika is netted by dogcatchers to go on to become a\n\nfamous Soviet space dog; and Puppy, one of the two dog boys in Dog Boy, is seized by the\n\nmilitzia to go on to be studied for the origins of what makes us human. The reader is enjoined to\n\nsympathize with the piteous existence of life on the street: Sharik is scalded by a cook, Laika is\n\nthrown by a cruel boy into the river, and the stray dogs with whom the dog boys cohabit undergo\n\nrecurrent exterminations by the authorities. If stray dogs live wretched lives on the street, they\n\nare treated even worse in the name of science, and all three novels provide detailed descriptions\n\nof their experiences. This chapter further addresses the pathos that is present in them, and how\n\nthat pathos is heightened as readers witness the dogs’ becoming unwitting posthuman subjects in the name of science. It considers how the factors of the writers’ nationalities and the different\n\neras of the novels—early, mid-, and post-Soviet—shape three books which are located in such\n\nsimilar settings and which follow such similar narrative trajectories.\n\nBIO\n\nJeanne Dubino is a professor of English and Global Studies at Appalachian State University in\n\nNorth Carolina.

We might think of this period as a moment of defeat\n\nor quiescence for anti-vivisectionist movements, especially after the First World War, but I will\n\nargue that in fact intense debates about animal bodies and the ethics of scientific took place in\n\nfiction of the day, both through metaphor and directly. Across the period I will examine, a re-\n\nenergised debate raged about the rightness of animal vivisection, exemplified particularly in the\n\nBrown Dog affair (1903 - 1910) and the science emerging from it. Critics have occasionally\n\nargued for the influence of the Brown Dog affair upon individual modernist authors’ practice: in\n\nthis paper I will take a wider, comparative survey across modern literature, including middle-\n\nbrow literature such as detective fiction. In the authors and texts I will examine as case studies,\n\nincluding Dorothy Richardson’s Interim (1919), Dorothy L. Sayers’s Whose Body? (1923), Aldous\n\nHuxley’s Those Barren Leaves (1925), John Cowper Powys’s Weymouth Sands (1934) and Agatha\n\nChristie’s Curtain (composed during WWII) the animal cost of scientific progress is deliberately\n\nhighlighted. Piers Beirne (2018) has recently argued for a concept of ‘theriocide’ (the killing of\n\nanimals by humans) to sit alongside homicide through readings of animal executions, visual art\n\nand modernist drama.

Her work asks the viewer-listener to control and hear commodified voices that are\n\nrecorded and sold in order to lure coyotes to their deaths and to consider the patriarchal power\n\nstructure inherent to hunting culture. The piece strives to create empathy in the viewer-listener\n\nby playing with the modernist technique of revisiting myths; taking inspiration from Native\n\nAmerican stories and critiquing modern myths that coyotes are “colonizing America’s\n\ncities”—the latter myths being ideological coverups for the actual colonization of other species’ territories by humans.\n\nBIO\n\nKathryn Eddy is an interdisciplinary artist who uses painting, drawing, collage, photography,\n\nsculpture, writing, and immersive sound installation to explore the complexities of the\n\nanimal/human-animal relationship.

Within such feline/feminine artistic imaginings, Carrington and Varo transformed the\n\nmisogynistic dialogues of Surrealism, re-defining the confines of the ‘idealised’ passive-female-\n\nmannequin. This paper shall explore the ways in which the two women’s unique sisterhood, founded in Mexico, interrogated the mutilation of the female body by their male Surrealist counterparts. Through the artistic conversations between Carrington and Varo, infused with feline imagery, the power of woman’s bodily fragmentation was kept within the female artists hands. The cat is an unquestionable surreal companion - a flaneur- occupying multiple co-existing identities. This paper delves into the surrealist woman’s ‘other dimensions’, through exploring the animal imagery of the feline, used to represent the multiplicity of woman’s identity as creative, transformative and most significantly, independent. I shall argue that Carrington and Varo interwove the female body alongside a feline companion, as both a witness and as a sisterly-force for the access of cosmic and occult transformation, and how their art can be positioned alongside Helen Cixous and Simone De Beauvoir’s feminist interrogation of the construction of ‘femininity’. I shall posit that Carrington and Varo created a new self-proliferating dialogue of ethereal feline sensuality.\n\nBIO\n\nCurrent Film, Exhibition and Curation MA student.

The short answer is 'Yes—But, in more ways than one!' This paper counts some of the ways, and after much calculation concludes with the numerical answer: '555'. The historical, lived dog, Flush, companion of the poet Elizabeth Barrett-Browning, given to her by Mary Russell Mitford, and the subject of Virginia Woolf's novel Flush: A Biography (1933) was apparently taught to count: 'It is amusing to see him stir his little head at \"two\" & then correct himself—and still more amusing to observe how, at every unqualified success, he turns round & looks at Arabel for applause.' But this parlour game is possibly the least interesting aspect of this paper's investigation into numbers and animality in Woolf's best-selling but least critically scrutinised novel. This paper considers canine counting and Woolf's own recorded suspicion of measuring—'Who shall measure the heat and violence of a poet's heart when caught and tangled in a woman's body?'—in relation to Derrida's dictum 'Counting is a bad procedure' to argue that Flush: A Biography, Woolf's much neglected ground-breaking work on animality, really does count.\n\nBIO\n\nJane Goldman is a Reader in English Literature at the University of Glasgow and a General Editor of the Cambridge University Press edition of the works of Virginia Woolf.

In this paper I will examine the way that Barnes presents the figure of the\n\nperforming animal as a mimic, physically enacting the anthropomorphism that makes\n\nthem intelligible but also necessarily relegates them to the realm of animal existence.\n\nBut, as Barnes reveals, the performing animal both fails in its mimicking (it is not a\n\nhuman nor civilised) and exposes the duality that captures it as Other to the human.\n\nAs I will consider in this paper, with such figures as the dancing bear, the bulls and\n\nfantastic beasts in Ryder (1928), and the inscripted animals of her bestiary,\n\nCreatures in an Alphabet (1982), Barnes examines how humanity has always and\n\nonly had nature as fabricated and deployed by culture and that, importantly for\n\nmodernism, evolution has not safely delivered the human to civilization. Barnes’\n\nvision of a beastly modernism, which transgresses the human structures of\n\nintelligibility, extends across her oeuvre, and I will argue that the transgressions of\n\nBarnes’ beastly modernism reconfigure the experience of being human in a profound\n\nway, challenging normative assumptions about an anthropocentric universe.\n\nBIO\n\nAlex Goody is Professor of Twentieth-Century Literature and Culture at Oxford\n\nBrookes University.

I have\n\nalways envied the beasts, their hard, adequate claws, their resonant hooves, their\n\nsparkling, phosphorescent scales, their deep coat[s], but especially their horns”\n\n(Fini, 1975: 44).\n\nThis is no idle musing; Fini’s work is full of human-animal (and fish) hybrids, some of them\n\ncaught in the very act of transformation.\n\nFini is most often thought of as a Surrealist, though she herself did not identify as such, and\n\nthis use of the human-animal also appeared amongst both her male and female Surrealist\n\npeers. However, the variety of Fini’s hybrids, their appearance in all areas of her oeuvre, and\n\nher own embodiments of a beastly identity in real life sets her apart. In repeatedly returning\n\nto the hybrid, Fini’s work ultimately raises questions about the unstable nature of\n\nsubjectivity and the boundaries of the human body, which tie into feminist and post-human\n\nconcepts of identity.\n\nConcentrating primarily on her art and design, this paper will explore a range of Fini’s\n\nbeastly hybrids, including the sphinx, the bird-woman, and the horned woman. In doing so I\n\naim to demonstrate the various ways in which Fini advocated a concept of selfhood that is in\n\ncontinual, metamorphic flux.\n\nBIO\n\nRachael Grew is a Lecturer in art history and visual culture at Loughborough University.

Eliot and Marianne Moore (with two others, Ezra Pound and H.D.,\n\nlurking in the background). This is part of a larger culture of animal nick-names in twentieth-\n\ncentury literature (of which both H.D. and Bryher, but also Winston Churchill and Philip Larkin\n\nwere part). It casts a strange light on the zoological imagination of these literary modernists, as\n\nwell as their taste for zoomorphic personae. Marianne Moore, with D.H. Lawrence whose animal\n\npoetry she admired, is one of the most systematically zoological of modern (or modernist)\n\nwriters, while Eliot, an admirer of Moore, in alluding to ‘apeneck Sweeney’ and ‘Christ the tiger’,\n\nis also obliquely invested in revisiting the relation of human and animal she makes her peculiar,\n\ndistinctively ‘queer’ speciality.\n\nMy paper will explore what the playfulness of their letters might tell us about the play of\n\nlanguage and representations of animals in their poetry, as well as their attitudes towards\n\npersonality and impersonality, human and animal, voice and audience, revelation and disguise.\n\nFocusing on the self-shaping but also shape-shifting of their letters, I want to discuss the\n\nrelationship between what the Marx brothers called animal crackers and poetic and biographical\n\nidentity in two of the great shape-changers of modern poetry.\n\nJOHN C. HAWKINS\n\nStrange and Friendly Beasts: The Politics of Animal Companionship in Sherwood Anderson’s “The Man who Became a Woman” and Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God\n\nIn response to this conference’s call for papers that deal with modernity as a period of\n\nintense focus on what it means to live with animals, this presentation draws attention to the\n\nbonds in modern U.S. fiction between humans and the horses, mules, and other working\n\ncreatures that share labor and affective space with them. As Derek Ryan has demonstrated in his\n\nreading of Flush as a companion species narrative, modern literature’s careful examinations of\n\ninteriority and personal connection provide powerful examples of Donna Haraway’s concept of\n\nhumans “becoming-with” other animals in meaningful formations of power that defy clean\n\nnotions of dominance and ownership while also refusing easy narratives of pure unproblematic\n\nlove.\n\nWhile British modernism offers its own menagerie of animal engagements, this paper\n\nturns to modern American literature to find relational animals holding affective signicance at\n\ncritical power junctures, especially in regional fiction. Threading Haraway’s concerns with\n\nrelationality through Brian Massumi’s Politics of Affect, I highlight the dynamics of power at\n\nplay in Sherwood Anderson’s “The Man Who Became a Woman” and Zora Neale Hurston’s\n\nTheir Eyes Were Watching God. The former establishes a deep, otherworldly bond between a\n\nstable hand and the horses he cares for in the context of a queerly modern confession of gender\n\nexchange, while the latter treats the town mule as an object of communal liberation from abused worker to citizen. Both texts, however, locate repression and exclusion at these very same sites,\n\nexposing their multivalent nature. These readings suggest that “beastly modernisms” bring\n\nincreased legibility to a wide range of modernist texts even as they reveal radical and dynamic\n\npower relations at work (and play) in the textual bodies of human and non-human animals alike.\n\nBIO\n\nJohn C.

In each of these images, however, the hat never looks the same. The hat’s life, very much like that of the artist’s, evolved over time. I argue that even though this inverted cork basket adorned with both natural and manmade décor features different elements in each photograph, it remains the same work of art; retaining what is essential, what Benjamin calls its aura. Its identity and authority remain intact.\n\nBIO\n\nChristy Heflin is a Paris-based PhD researcher working on Surrealism and marine life at Royal\n\nHolloway University of London.

Moore’s ode to the Columbidae praises the birds’ beauty and marvelous homing abilities, but not everyone felt the same way. The 1930s, as Colin Jerolmack has documented, is the decade in which the pigeon’s reputation as a dirty nuisance animal emerged, especially in cities like New York and London. During World War II, Britain awarded several carrier pigeons the Dickin Medal for their service as messengers, but by the 1950s wild pigeons were largely seen as carriers only of dirt and disease. They came to be stigmatized alongside the poor immigrant city dwellers who fed and sometimes bred them. In 1966, a parks commissioner coined the epithet that has dogged the birds ever since: “rats with wings.”\n\nIn this talk I want to briefly survey the role of the pigeon in twentieth-century literature, homing in on Moore’s poem but also flitting over Ahmed Ali’s Twilight in Delhi (1940), Sam Selvon’s The Lonely Londoners (1956), Isaac Bashevis Singer’s “Pigeons” (1970), and Karen Tei Yamashita’s Through the Arc of the Rain Forest (1990). Literary pigeons are metonymies for many themes we associate with modernist culture: urban life, cosmopolitanism, anti-imperialism, mobility, global networks of circulation, and the precarity of nonhuman life under a capitalist regime of growth. Today, we understand ourselves to be living in the Anthropocene. Pigeon virtues—adaptability, resilience, a strong sense of home—might help us think about how to live better with human and nonhuman others in this rapidly changing world.\n\nBIO\n\nCaroline Hovanec is Assistant Professor of English and Writing at the University of Tampa.

Joyce not only deeply engages with the ubiquity of nonhumans, their\n\nproducts and their lives within the metropolis, but also their relationship to histories of\n\nthe Irish famine and colonialism. Through descriptions of nonhuman suffering, Joyce\n\ncreates a compelling creaturely awareness which reflects not only the condition of\n\nanimals in 20 th Century Ireland but also the state of the nation. The ghostly, tortured\n\nbodies of beasts remind us of the lethal treatment of Ireland’s people.\n\nAnd yet, this description of Joyce’s nonhuman is perhaps reductive\n\nconsidering his complex construction of a nonhuman imaginary within the text.\n\nAnimals in Ulysses are not simply the symbols of a traumatised nation. Indeed, a far\n\nmore nuanced and densely crafted account of Dublin’s nonhuman population is\n\noffered as we are invited to gaze into and through the eyes of the animal. The forays\n\nthe novel offers into animal experience are not simply an imaginative exercise in\n\n“experiencing” the animal. Indeed, this analysis will argue that they constitute an\n\nethical engagement with the nonhuman, ultimately troubling the boundary between\n\nhuman and animal.\n\nProceeding from the works of theorists including David Rando, Peter Adkins,\n\nJM Coetzee and Carol J. Adams, this paper will explore Joyce’s troubling of the\n\nhuman-nonhuman boundary with a view to ascertaining how a Joycean ethics of the\n\nanimal can be identified in Ulysses and, furthermore, how we read these in the\n\ncurrent climate of nonhuman studies and the “animal turn”.\n\nBIO\n\nRory Hutchings obtained both his BA and MA in English and Literary Studies respectively at Goldsmiths, University of London.

I analyze how dominant political narratives influenced pest control\n\nand sanitary programs and how the biological shaped, challenged or hindered political\n\nmodernization projects.\n\nAs I am to demonstrate, most early postwar anti-rat materials symbolically deprived these\n\nrodents of their animality by attributing to them human features and present in a figure of\n\nan enemy. Although an intensification of rat control campaign in the turn of 1950s can be\n\nexplained by their population&#39;s sharp increase during the war period, the convergence of the\n\nanti-rat propaganda with political purges at the same time, as well as strategic and rhetorical\n\nresemblances between these two operations, do not seem coincidental. As creatures posing\n\nconsiderable threat both to public health (vectors of disease) and national economy (‘crafty\n\nthieves') rats can be perceived as embodiments of challenges to be confronted by the Polish state devastated during the war. Propaganda materials from Stalinist times explicitly\n\nemphasize the presence of rat populations in neglected areas as a touchstone of\n\nbackwardness and underdevelopment, making rats (or rather, their absence) a gauge of\n\nmodernization processes. I argue that the dynamics of post-war rat control programs can be\n\nexamined as a constant struggle between human and non-human (or, the cultural and the\n\nbiological) in pursuit of modernist ‘purification’ (Latour, 1993) and as such can cast new light on modernization and sanitation processes in Poland.\n\nBIO\n\nGabriela Jarzębowska is a PhD candidate at the faculty of Artes Liberales, University of\n\nWarsaw and a Fulbright Fellow at the Wesleyan University (supervisor: Kari Weil) as well as\n\nNational Science Centre&#39;s (NCN) grantee.

In the eyes of its contemporary critics, Watts had painted a polemic against the\n\n“Maiden Tributes” of London—child prostitution that caused an outcry that year. The painting,\n\nthen, is a paragon of Victorian visual didacticism. A beastly creature awaits its sacrifices from\n\nAthens, a city subjugated by Crete and forced to send its children to the Minotaur in his\n\nlabrinyth. An 1887 viewer of Watts’s painting called it a “brutal, cruel, and irresponsible power,\n\nan embodied Force without pity,” citing the “cold stare of his ravenous eye.” A later writer tells\n\nof the creature’s “savage eyes” and “hungry mouth,” and another identifies its mostly English\n\nviewers as Theseus, who might wish to slay the creature in the name of “High Greek\n\ncivilization.”\n\nAnd yet Watts’s creature is no evil monster, but a sad beast who casts a pensive glance\n\nacross a hazy sea. There is a silence embedded in this difference between the painting and its\n\nreception. This silence, I argue, holds the weight of the British Empire. In this paper, I compare\n\nthe Minotaur to the ambivalent descriptions of John Bull in nineteenth-century Britain. John\n\nBull—the symbol of England—was the imperial villain of the Tasmanian poet John Lewin’s The\n\nMinotaur! (1849), and made an appearance in Percy Shelley’s Swellfoot the Tyrant (1820) as a\n\nMinotaur hybrid, an engine of the state. These and other examples critique empire from within. I\n\nwonder, then, what is gained from envisioning a silently pathetic empire at its center, wrought in\n\nbestiality and shame. This is an empire of inheritance and invisible violence, one that embodies\n\nthe terms of Derrida’s Beast and Sovereign. Victorian artists like Watts are bracketed out of\n\nmodernist art histories. In this paper, then, I situate Watts in a modernity of beastly politics,\n\ntowards what T.J. Clark has called the accidental “contingency” of modern painting. It is less an\n\ninsular story of 1880s London, and more a picture in proleptic dialogue with Picasso’s modern\n\nbeasts.\n\nBIO\n\nAriel Kline is a PhD candidate in the Department of Art & Archaeology at Princeton University.\n\nShe is interested in animal studies, the monstrous, queer studies, and the visual history of the\n\nBritish Empire.\n\n​\n\nINA LINGE\n\nBeastly Butterflies: Sexual Nature in Sexology and Modern Dance\n\nButterflies are rarely described as beastly. In this paper, however, I want to argue that Loïe\n\nFuller’s ‘Butterfly Dance’, performed in Paris and elsewhere around 1900, brings out\n\nprecisely ‘beastly’ qualities via the figure of the butterfly: transgression, disturbance and\n\nsexual perversity. Not only does the figure of the butterfly bring out these unseen beastly\n\nqualities of Fuller’s pioneering modern dance, but in the metamorphosis performed on\n\nstage it also represents the essence of modernism as transformation.\n\nIn this talk, I want to explore how ideas about the sexually ‘normal’ and ‘natural’ were co-\n\nconstructed by German sexological discourses and dance after 1900 via butterflies, both\n\nliteral and figurative. Drawing on literature and science studies and queer and feminist\n\ntheoretical approaches to nature and non-human animals, the talk investigates the work of\n\nthe German-Jewish sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld and his interest in butterflies, both as\n\nmodel organisms for scientific study to prove the ‘intersexuality’ of all living things, and as\n\nartistic representations in the form of the Butterfly Dance. This Butterfly Dance was\n\npioneered by the American dancer Loïe Fuller (1862 – 1928) and adapted by the Welsh\n\naristocrat Henry Cyril Paget (1875 – 1905), the 5 th Marquis of Anglesey. Following Fuller’s\n\nand Paget’s performances of the Butterfly Dance, this talk investigates how both\n\nperformances explore concepts of sexual nature via the figure of the butterfly. I argue that\n\nboth performances express a version of sexual nature that does not offer a pastoral vision of\n\nnaturalised sexuality, but instead show an alternative vision of sexual nature, one that is\n\ntransgressive, disturbing and perverse and uniquely a product of modernist interventions\n\ninto the sexually ‘normal’ and ‘natural’. Finally, I argue that this competing vision of sexual\n\nnature influences Magnus Hirschfeld’s sexological work, which turns towards butterfly\n\nexperiments to understand natural sexual variation.\n\nBIO\n\nDr Ina Linge is Associate Research Fellow in the College of Humanities at the University of\n\nExeter, where she is also affiliated with the Wellcome Trust-funded ‘Rethinking Sexology’\n\nproject.

It\n\nembraces embodied empathy, emotion, and subjective experience – as well as the\n\ncuriousity Donna Haraway describes as the first duty of companion species – as\n\nvaluable resources for interspecies interaction and collaboration, and therefore\n\nvaluable sites for critical engagement.\n\nIn this creative paper, I apply a zoopoetic methodology to Virginia Woolf’s\n\nFlush, and J.M. Barrie’s Peter Pan and Peter and Wendy, by placing memoir alongside\n\ncritical analysis. I locate in these texts what Etienne Benson calls “embodied traces”\n\nof the nonhuman animal by comparing their representation of dogs with\n\nbiographical material about Woolf’s spaniel Pinka and Barrie’s dogs Porthos and\n\nLuath. Though engaged in the modernist task of interrogating the boundaries of the\n\nhuman, Woolf and Barrie are also interested in what Erica Fudge calls the “animal as\n\nanimal.” Neither author simply uses the dog as an allegorical tool for social\n\ncommentary. The categories of lady’s lapdog in Woolf, and man’s working-breed dog\n\nin Barrie, are deconstructed to reveal how gender and class influence the\n\noverlapping lived and bodily experience of both humans and their domesticated\n\ncompanion species. I include personal reflections on my relationship with my own\n\nNewfoundland dog to illuminate the ways in which writing and reading about\n\nanimals is reciprocal with actual interspecies interactions. Therefore, zoopoetics is\n\nof practical significance to the field of animal studies, which, as Cary Wolfe suggests,\n\nis burdened with questions of ethics, vulnerability, and action.\n\nBIO\n\nCameo Marlatt is a recent graduate of the University of Glasgow, with a Doctorate of\n\nFine Arts in Creative Writing, for which she wrote a series of essays and a collection\n\nof poetry on the topics of Companion Species and Zoopoetics.

No, she can jump me’: The feline presence in Ulysses\n\nFrank Budgen notes that James Joyce ‘had a considerable sympathy for the cat with its\n\npersuasive manners and its compact self-sufficiencies’. Joyce kept and observed cats\n\nwhile in Trieste, Zurich, and Paris, with a photograph of 1913 showing Giorgio and\n\nLucia at the window of their Trieste flat, a cat embraced in Lucia’s arms. The\n\nattentiveness to feline behavior and the cat's place in the Bloom family in Ulysses is thus\n\ndrawn from Joyce’s own observations of and cohabitation with this animal. Critically, the\n\nturn of the twentieth century saw an epistemological shift in the knowledge of the\n\nanimal’s place in Irish society, with an increased presence of animals in the home. This\n\ncreated a bifurcation of domestic animals into those kept as companions and those kept\n\nfor utilitarian purposes. My paper examines the trace of this dynamic bifurcation in the\n\nrelation of Leopold Bloom to his cat, and therefore offers a counterpoint to David\n\nRando’s 2009 essay ‘The Cat’s Meow: “Ulysses”, Animals, and the Veterinary Gaze’. It\n\nsituates the animal gaze of Bloom in its socio-economic context, in contrast to Rando’s\n\nnotion of the ‘veterinary gaze’. Further, I borrow ideas from the philosophy of Jacques\n\nDerrida and John Berger to argue that this social reconfiguration of animal-human\n\nrelations allows Bloom’s cat to be read as a substitute for his dead son, Rudy. This idea is explicated through an anthrozoological reading – this being the science of animal-\n\nhuman relations – to explore the nexus of associations between the cat and Rudy in Bloom’s psyche, which provides an insight into the often overlooked issue of the tripartite structure of Ulysses. I suggest that my reading offers a new way to explore this structure through the lens of deconstructing the animal-human divide, prompting the reader towards the limits of the human. My paper thus historicizes the integration of pets into the family unit in ways that disturb anthropocentrism and the anthropomorphic gaze.\n\nBIO\n\nJonathan McAllister is an M.Phil student at Jesus College, Cambridge.

Her first brush with\n\nfame was a meeting with modernist writer Djuna Barnes, who published her interview with\n\nDinah, “The Girl and the Gorilla,” in New York World magazine.

The radical otherness of these life forms troubles the\n\nboundaries of modernist form; much has been said about the Men of 1914’s disdain for the\n\n‘jellyfish attributes’ of the internal, stream-of-consciousness method with its associations\n\nwith degeneracy and feminine fluidity.\n\nYet if the apparent formlessness and categorical\n\ninstability of marine life posed a threat to modernist writers, then it also, to paraphrase\n\nElizabeth Grosz, inspired possibilities of being otherwise. This paper will explore H.D. and\n\nEliot’s mutual fascination with organisms that blur the boundaries between animal and\n\nvegetable – polyps, anemones, hydrophytes, sponges – occupying, in the words of H. G.\n\nWells, Julian Huxley, and G. P. Wells, ‘a sort of no man’s land (or rather both man’s land)’\n\nbetween the two.\n\nBoth writers detail formative encounters with aquatic life forms in their\n\nwork: Eliot spent his childhood summers staring into rockpools and collecting algae on the\n\nMassachusetts coastline, while the young H.D. helped her grandfather, renowned phycologist\n\nFrancis Wolle, in the production of thousands of drawings of magnified diatoms. These ‘hints\n\nof earlier and other creation’, I will argue, inspired H.D. and Eliot to recognise the creative\n\npossibilities of formal indeterminacy and passive receptivity in their writing, exploring ways\n\nof being that both precede and exceed humanist conceptions of the self as bounded, stable,\n\nand sovereign.\n\nBIO\n\nRachel is a Doctoral Prize Fellow at Loughborough University with research interests in\n\nliterary modernism, animal studies, and the environment.

The theme extended the journal’s prevalent fascination with\n\nmythological, speculative, and esoteric conceptions of animals and nature; yet, it also shows\n\nthat surrealism tends to exceed such symbolic projections. The contents page of the number in\n\nquestion was adorned with a photograph by Man Ray of a woman’s naked upper body. Her\n\nhead obscured by darkness, the woman’s arms are lifted over it to form two horns, while\n\nskilful use of shadows renders her torso into the visage of a bull. The issue also features many\n\nphotographs of animals, from owls to praying mantises. The latter illustrate Roger Caillois’s\n\nessay ‘Mimicry and Legendary Psychasthenia’, which, much like Man Ray’s photograph,\n\ninvestigate the mechanisms behind identity dissolution and the porous borders between\n\nhumans and other animals. In this paper, I seek to show that while the surrealists writing in\n\nand illustrating Minotaure tend to connect loss of instrumental reason with the animal, rather\n\nthan demonstrating a view of animals as void of reason and agency, these connections suggest\n\nintricate, interspecies relations. In an earlier issue of Minotaure the surrealist physician Pierre\n\nMabille wrote that humans and animals develop a shared visceral unconscious. Recalling\n\nGerman psychology influenced by notions of animal magnetism, Mabille’s essay indicates\n\nthat it is precisely in its conceptions of the unconscious, no longer believed to be confined to\n\nhuman interiority, that surrealism most effectively troubles the borders between humans and\n\nother animals. In that spirit, I argue, Man Ray’s photograph does not so much designate a\n\nheadless eclipse of reason, as it imagines an overlapping of human and animal faculties,\n\nwhich recurs throughout Minotaure and surrealism in general.\n\nBIO\n\nKristoffer Noheden is Researcher in the Department of Media Studies, Stockholm University.\n\nHe is the author of Surrealism, Cinema, and the Search for a New Myth (2017), and a number\n\nof articles and book chapters on surrealism in relation to ecology, film theory, and exhibition\n\nhistory.

The nonhuman, whether “animate” or “inanimate,” contributes to the distinct\n\nhumour and “queerness” of Bowen’s writing, affecting both form and content. Maud Ellmann\n\nhas observed of Bowen’s work that “every object has a psyche; in fact, her objects even have\n\nneuroses,” while Carrie Rohman maintains that modernism is the first literature to “register” the\n\npsychic eruption of “animality” through the fragmentation and discontinuity of “circuitous and\n\nunstable narrative devices.” The appearance of animals in a text always introduces formal\n\ninstability and poses a potential threat to the illusion of human superiority and identity, often\n\nthrough humiliation or comic deflation. The work of new materialists, such as Karen Barad, has\n\nproposed more radical challenges to received ideas about human centrality by undermining\n\nfoundational divisions including the assumed separation between the animate and the inanimate,\n\n“the human and its ‘others.’” Bowen has always disrespected this separation, and the\n\n“queerness” that refuses such divisions, while insisting on difference, demonstrates just how\n\npossible numerous impossibilities actually are, revising our understandings of, according to\n\nBarad, “causality, matter, space and time.”\n\nImpossibilities preoccupy Bowen, particularly those that obtain through the suspension\n\nof “logic” and allow for contradictory realities to co-exist. Houses and objects in The Last\n\nSeptember manifest more liveliness than any of the novel’s human characters, liveliness conveyed\n\nthrough unsettling figurative language, such as a doorway that “yearn[s] up the path like an eye-\n\nsocket,” or a piece of paper that creeps “on the floor like a living handkerchief.” The disavowed\n\nand terrifying closeness of the human and the nonhuman animal also disturbs the complacencies\n\nof Bowen’s characters. In her children’s book, The Good Tiger, rude, nosy neighbour Mrs Jones\n\ncan only express her terror at encountering a tiger at a birthday party by quacking, an unconscious acknowledgement of her position in the food chain as prey. The “pellucid, sane,”\n\nand thoroughly modern, logical sophisticates of the story “The Cat Jumps,” also revert to their\n\nanimal selves with very little provocation. The vexed status of the animal in Irish culture,\n\nwhether it is the historic “bestialisation” of the “native” Irish, or the often derisory association of\n\nthe Anglo-Irish with dogs and horses, along with Bowen’s treatment of inanimate “others,” are\n\ncentral to the unique Modernism of her fiction.\n\nBIO\n\nMaureen O’Connor lectures in the School of English in University College Cork.

It is in this manner of\n\never-presence yet marginalisation, as it were, that Joyce’s final work comes to resemble the\n\nstructure of medieval manuscripts, as ‘[b]y the thirteenth century […] the margins of [these]\n\nmanuscripts began to be populated with small animals in human parody’ (The Beast Within,\n\np.90). Joyce’s book, much like a medieval bestiary, contains a significant number of bizarre\n\nanimals; there are fabular beasts that sing and dance, animals that talk and act in so human\n\na manner that it is difficult to call them animals at all, and hybrid creatures that appear both\n\nhuman and animal simultaneously. Given this parallel to medieval texts, this paper will focus\n\non a comparison between Royal MS 12 F XIII (also known as the Rochester Bestiary) and one\n\nof the Wake’s most significant hybrids: the hen-woman Biddy Doran. Through this\n\ncomparison, accompanied by an application of Giambattista Vico’s theory on being human\n\n(found in The New Science), I will argue that this tale of a hen resembles a medieval bestiary\n\nentry, in which animals are used to teach humans how to be human.\n\nBIO\n\nKate O’Donovan is a PhD candidate in English Literature at Royal Holloway, University of\n\nLondon.

His extensive body of work is indicative of the wider cultural radicalism that germinated and flourished during this tumultuous transition. Mirroring what Harriet Ritvo terms the ‘animal turn’ in the contemporary humanities, scholars such as Jed Mayer and Wendy Parks lend increasing scrutiny to Carpenter’s pro-animal politics. Compassion toward the nonhuman animal forms an underexplored component of the complex unitary metaphysic Carpenter expresses throughout his writing, whereby humanity must strive towards ‘cosmic consciousness,’ a recognition of man’s intrinsic unity with all phenomenal life. To do so, Carpenter contends, humanity must shed the restrictive trappings of bourgeois, hyper-industrial Victorian ‘civilisation’; this rejection of Victorian society in favour of a radical utopian future is, I argue, a characteristically Modernist impulse. In a 1909 address to the Vegetarian Society, Carpenter describes the ‘nineteenth century’ as the ‘nadir of descent into the inferno of civilisation,’ symptoms of which include ‘the eating of meat,’ a diet catalysed by industrial slaughter. Vegetarianism, by contrast, is spreading ‘with rapidity amongst modern populaces,’ embedding a sensitivity towards nature that precipitates ‘a new plane of life.’ (Vegetarianism p.316). This paper focusses on Carpenter’s practice of vegetarianism, exploring its role in his broader self-fashioning as a modern radical who rejected the rituals of Victorian gentility. Noting Carpenter’s aversion to the ‘ancient looking patriarchs’ associated with prominent vegetarian movements, I delineate two strategies he used for vegetarianism’s re- presentation. Firstly, in place of morality-based and animal-centred arguments for vegetarianism, Carpenter favoured an esoteric brand of contemporary nutritional science. Secondly, he candidly described his lapses in vegetarianism, in line with a vociferous objection to ‘absolute rule[s]’ for living. (Carpenter 1916, p.101). These strategies demonstrate the contested, ambiguous nature of Carpenter’s nonhuman politic, signposting the need for its further critical exploration.\n\nBIO\n\nCharlotte O’Neill is a first year PhD student in English Literature at the University of Sheffield.\n\nFollowing on from previous research on the animal rights writing of late Victorian activist and writer\n\nEdward Carpenter, their thesis interrogates his work in the broader context of the nonhuman.\n\nRODOLFO PISKORSKI\n\n‘Deeper within darkness’: animal reality, poetic representation, and the nested form of Ted Hughes’s ‘The Thought-Fox’\n\nTed Hughes is known for nature and ‘animal’ poems such as ‘The Thought-Fox’ (1957), but in his essay ‘Capturing Animals’ he emphasises that any poem can be ‘like an animal’. He thus foregrounds a certain animality of poetic form, to the expense of a certain animal ‘content’, as crucial both to the overall work of poetry but especially to the vital project of representing animal reality. I take him at his word and read his famous poem for two crucial animalistic (i.e. formal) aspects: the visual playfulness of the repeated letter w standing in for a fox paw print on the snow and, more importantly, his use of punctuation (the colon) as a tool to section the poem. I argue that the formal architectonics of the poem both perform and present a project of poetic representation that sets it apart from regular human experience. Crucially, this representational practice grants the human the ability to approach the other-than-human hard materiality of animals (the scriptural paw prints), and thus singles out poetry as necessary to maintain any ‘communion’ with nature. I argue that this polemics regarding the representation of nature, as well as the formal techniques and the manifesto-like character of ‘The Thought-Fox’, stems from a desire to renovate poetic language and mimesis against the background of both a modern estrangement from nature and the modernist crisis in the representational powers of language.\n\nBIO\n\nRodolfo Piskorski holds a PhD in Critical and Cultural Theory from Cardiff University, Wales, where he is University Teacher in Portuguese.

Both were fantastical and frightening in\n\nequal measure.\n\nZoological gardens draw crowds all over the world in many countries. The exhibition of wildlife in the midst\n\nof civilized societies has been a constant of human history, because, suggests Rachel Poliquin in The\n\nBreathless Zoo, “it has helped people to place themselves in relation to the rest of the world. Human\n\nbeings seem to need the wild and endlessly seek it out.” Although purporting to offer insights into nature,\n\nzoos isolate species from one another, disrupting any natural interaction between different groups of\n\nanimals, reptiles, fish and birds. Animals are caged, or confined in glasshouses or pits – incarcerated,\n\ndisenfranchised, and disempowered.\n\nThe topographic method and formal visual geometry of the photography emphasises containment and\n\ndisplay. The camera articulates views for the spectator; perspective organises imagery around a single\n\nviewing position. This ego-centric system is not exclusive to the visual arts; the fourth wall viewpoint\n\noffered by the proscenium arch stage, similarly ‘plays’ to the audience. Zoological gardens, likewise, are\n\nconstructed in terms of the theatre of exhibition. Excluding the protagonist and therefore plot, we avoid any\n\npossibility of empathy, or worse, ‘anthropomorphism – the constant enemy.

H. Lawrence\n\nMy recent work on concepts of the bioaesthetic has led to an interest in the question of animal\n\n“authority” in modernist literature. How are animals represented or experienced as authorizing\n\nforces or as “authors” in literature of the modernist period? What qualities of authority are called\n\nupon when animals become sources of sanctioning, knowledge, or permission in literary work?\n\nIf we re-frame something like Foucault’s outlining of an “author-function” in discursive\n\npractices to accommodate animal authority, the question of the author becomes a much more\n\nradically open question than Foucault could have anticipated. What replaces the apotheosis of\n\nécriture in an animalized framework? Is it Derrida’s animot? Is it a zoopoetics that bears witness\n\nto humans’ entanglement with life, as a repressed or disavowed “given” of writing? How do\n\nanimal authorities profoundly affect the kinship between writing and death that Foucault (and\n\nBarthes) elaborate? Is the evocation of an animal authority in creative or artistic work a “radical”\n\nrefusal of the proper name, of the individual mark, or does it rather concede that the operations\n\nof authentification and verification (tied to self-presence, in at least some sense) ought to be\n\naccorded to animals, also? Along these lines, this paper explores moments of animal “authority”\n\nin D. H. Lawrence’s work such as the rabbit’s scratch in Women in Love, that can be read in\n\nrelation to theories of literacy, and the “piercing” beaks of birds in poems from Birds, Beasts,\n\nand Flowers, that suggest a blood-conscious animal marking or tracing.\n\nBIO\n\nCARRIE ROHMAN is Professor of English at Lafayette College.

Based mainly on the rather reduced definition that modernism equals progressiveness, some historians refused to acknowledge the Nazi’s entanglement with the modernist agenda outright, whereas others saw National Socialism as the dark side of modernism.\n\nThe tension between the futurist perspectives of a Thousand Year Reich that was at the same time to be seen as rooted in a mythical Germanic past was not easily resolved. Although the discussion has since been far less at the centre of what German historians saw as futile for the understanding of National Socialism as such, this original disagreement has not lost its weight. Based on my empirical findings and my approach of a political animal history of the Third Reich, I want to therefore show how bringing in the animals reveals this tension as the heart of where national socialist ideology stood in terms of modernism. Taking animal breeding as an example, I will present arguments that within this one single issue we can see the simultaneity of modern and anti-modern elements in Nazi-ideology and practices at work. Breeding the proper animals was seen as way for economic autarky, genetic enhancement and species survival, all of which can be regarded as modernist approaches. Yet at the same time, these approaches were based on an ideology that prioritised what can be dubbed “Germanic” animals over others, thereby reverting to anti-modernist and folklorist notions such as blood and soil and “Lebensraum”. Thus, I hope to contribute with the paper to the discussion of how, by looking at animals, we can help to provide a more nuanced picture of what modernity really entails.\n\nBIO\n\nMieke Roscher is assistant professor for social and cultural history and the history of human-\n\nanimal relations at the University of Kassel, Germany.

Eliot and James Joyce\n\nOver the last decade, a formidable body of scholarship—led by the likes of Carrie Rohman\n\nand Derek Ryan—has emerged to centre the animal as a fundamental concern for\n\nmodernism, opening up thrilling possibilities for modernism’s contribution to animal studies.\n\nHowever, this scholarship has not significantly addressed one of modernism’s central\n\nnarratives—its intimate relationship with the urban; rather, the investment has been in\n\nmodernist representations of the wilderness and the “primitive” (as in Philip Armstrong) or in\n\na primarily symbolic, linguistic or ontological/metaphysical understanding of the modernist\n\nanimal (as in Derek Ryan) without fully considering the urban habitat in which such animals\n\noften appear. Ecocritical scholars such as Joshua Schuster have emphasized the distinctive,\n\nindustrially inflected ecology that pervades modernist literature. In this aspect, I follow their\n\nwork while focusing more on the literary relationship between animal and urban environment\n\nthan on questions central to ecocriticism.\n\nA question I pursue in this context is whether urban animals in modernism appear as alien to\n\nthe city, injecting it with their nonhuman wilderness, or whether they emanate from urban\n\nmatter and express a fundamentally urban identity. In considering this question, I explore the\n\nrole of cats in T.S. Eliot’s poetry and cattle in James Joyce’s Ulysses (also linking them to\n\nless canonical authors). In both writers, I argue, animals are inextricable from their urban\n\nsetting but unsettle urban ubiquity by drawing attention to themselves and consequently,\n\nprovoking scrutiny of the features defining their urban origin. Further, I demonstrate how\n\nEliot’s animals exude their potency from within a classic definition of urban, rooted in the city,\n\nwhile Joyce’s animals delineate the different layers comprising an ambivalent, irregular\n\nversion of the urban. In the process, I wish to further the understanding of the urban as\n\nheterogeneous but always bound to the animal.\n\nBIO\n\nAnushka Sen is a PhD student from India, currently in her third year at Indiana University’s\n\ndepartment of English.

We have an ever-growing body of digitized sources, which has hugely increased our understanding. Modernist culture swims through bespoke presses and glossy Sunday supplements alike, and demands further analysis. But how might we read them, beyond biographies and indexes? Scholars such as Eric White and Céline Mansanti have made significant inroads into the field, focusing on transatlantic nationalisms, and “organic” or “soft” modernism respectively. This paper takes one document in particular, which is perhaps the largest of the “little” magazines: Eugene and Maria Jolas’s transition (1927–1938). I will attempt to outline a different kind of methodology, testing the idea that a good way of reading this extraordinary magazine—famous for publishing Joyce’s “Work in Progress” throughout its run—is through its animal metaphors. The magazine is, in fact, fullof animals. From Kafka’s unspecified Ungeziefer or “unclean” animal at the heart of “Metamorphosis” (published for the first time in English in transition) to the amoeboid shapes in abstract art and Surrealist-influenced poetry, one can, perhaps, read a shared fascination with creatures from what Jolas repeatedly refers to as the “telluric depths”, as part of his sustained “Revolution of the Word”. I will focus on one area in particular: the lizard. Why do we find figurative reptiles through the magazine? How do they related to the 1920s fascination with the inhuman “third” or “pineal eye”? The overlooked German poet Gottfried Benn’s various contributions over the years, some of which was highly dubious, offer space for consideration. By assessing this and related material I will tentatively propose what might be called a “primordial modernism”: a quasi-Jungian, quasi-antihumanist, not-quite collective sensibility as authors turned again and again to creatures furthest from ourselves as part of their aesthetic practice. What are the implications of reading in this way? Is it helpful in approaching what Andreas Kramer and Rainer Rumold have called the “dark side” of modernism?\n\nBIO\n\nCathryn Setz is an Associate Visiting Research Fellow at the Rothermere American Institute at the University of Oxford.

Her first book, Primordial Modernism: Animals, Ideas, _transition_ (1927--1938) (Edinburgh University Press, 2019) explores animal metaphors as a way of reading Maria and Eugene Jolas's major international modernist magazine, and her current research focuses on the history of popular biology and its intersections with North American literary journals, especially during the 1920s and the so-called \"Eclipse of Darwinism\".
