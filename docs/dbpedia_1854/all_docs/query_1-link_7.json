        "text": "Alaska Airlines and REI launched a partnership that offers exclusive travel and outdoor adventures with an exclusive discount for their members and customers. This highlights the power of creative, authentic partnerships in retail promotional strategies. This made me think of some key takeaways I learned over the years. Here's a list of do's and don'ts for effective retail promotional marketing strategies that I took away from this offer: üëá DO: ‚òë Craft a Strong Subject Line Use compelling language that offers value, such as discounts or exclusive access, to catch attention immediately. ‚òë Emphasize Exclusivity Highlight unique experiences or products to make offers irresistible and tailored to customer desires. ‚òë Create Urgency Set clear deadlines to encourage quick action while being considerate of customers' planning and shopping needs. ‚òë Use Compelling Visuals and Copy Incorporate eye-catching images and persuasive language that align with current trends and customer interests. DON'T: ‚úñ Neglect Cross-Platform Promotion Ensure all marketing channels are aligned to maximize campaign reach and coherence. ‚úñ Overlook Ease of Redemption Simplify the redemption process to avoid customer frustration and drop-offs. ‚úñ Forget Customer Engagement Missed opportunities for engaging customers can lead to lower campaign effectiveness. ‚úñ Ignore Authenticity Authentic partnerships and promotions resonate more with customers, enhancing brand loyalty and trust. Leveraging these insights can significantly enhance campaign performance and customer engagement. #RetailMarketing #PromotionalStrategies #BrandPartnership #CustomerEngagement #DigitalMarketing\n\nIt seems Uncommon's Cannes Lions Grand Prix winner 'A British Original' for British Airways has not only created positive waves within the advertising & media industry. Taking a closer look at if there are any brand demand effects of the campaign, based on Share of Search (SoS) data, here are a couple of points indicating there are. After the campaign period (started October -22); üëâBA broke their downward SoS trend, strongly indicating increased interest üëâThe holiday season is for the most part a travel intense period so volume would naturally go up. However, BA's SoS data saw a drastic spike vs the competitors üëâThey have maintained a higher search volume vs before the campaign start ‚òùÔ∏èMoreover, the follow up campaign launched around August 2023 and interestingly enough we see an even bigger SoS data result with its origin during the campaign period. The prolonged effect on consumer behavior - the adstock - of the BA advertising appears to be very real. #shareofsearch #brand #data #advertising\n\n‚ÄúGuest how you guest‚Äù Going through most airport experiences at the moment you can‚Äôt escape IHG‚Äôs advertising. Whilst IHG has focussed on building a house of brands its advertising is very much group focussed. The loyalty programme essentially the glue that holds it together. Whilst I understand the financial efficiencies something jars with me on this. ‚ÄúGuest how you guest‚Äù seems to be removing all responsibility from the experience provider to the guest. (Of course that‚Äôs not what it is suppose to say but having heard and seen it about 15 times in the last 3 days that‚Äôs what it made me feel) How do others experience it? Please put your thoughts below. #hospitality #branding #marketing\n\nDo Promotions actually work in #travelretail ? There are a vast array of different promotional mechanics that can be deployed in the channel. The picture highlights the most common ones. However, every year retailers and brands invest heavily in promotions. But why? What is the actual purpose of running the promotion? Is it to drive volume to reduce your production cost per unit and drive profitability? Is it so that you can hit your targets and get that bonus? Is it to steal share? (hint : retailer's really do not like that!!) Is it to drive brand awareness with the hope that the domestic market benefit from it? The big question really hits home..... are we burning money that we didn't need to? Right now I am loving listening to the team as they discuss various promotional mechanics and unravelling what is happening with performance and whether they indeed work. So do they work? Well.... yes and no. The story is a complex one. Bottom line is - if you are running a promotion - make sure you measure it! Tomorrow, I will talk about different mechanics for different brands. Until then, have a great day. Going to TFWA Cannes? Drop me a line! I write about Travel Retail - if my posts are useful / helpful, please consider adding me or following me. Thanks!

It's the only airline I've used with direct access to their Customer Service line. I've made bookings, changes and add-ons from my browser at no additional costs. McKinsey & Company states, 'the average customer looking to make a single reservation for accommodations (like a hotel room) online switched nearly six times between websites and mobile channels. If these customers encounter inconsistent information or can‚Äôt get what they need, they may lose interest in a brand‚Äôs products or services.' You want to build something your customer doesn't feel at odds with when they hop over from your social media to the website. Join me next month with Eldred F. Garcia John Outridge & Christopher Burns to further the conversation across the Caribbean. #ecommerce\n\nAn interesting story here as Fraport Twin Star Airport Management (FTSAM) signs not one but two master concessionaire agreements with travel retail powerhouses Lagard√®re Travel Retail and Avolta for Burgas and Varna airports. As we reported earlier, FTSAM awarded its master food & beverage concession to Lagard√®re Travel Retail while the company has also entered into a master retail agreement with Avolta (formerly Dufry and Autogrill) for the two airports. We are going to see more full master concessions (i.e. retail AND F&B) going forward given the convergence of the two categories within sector powerhouses Lagard√®re Travel Retail and Avolta though many other airports will choose to allocate their eggs to more than one basket, and in this case two. Both contracts run for a sensible eight-year term. Full details via the link below. https://lnkd.in/gMz4FsjG Svetlana Simeonova Frank Quante, Dr. jur.
