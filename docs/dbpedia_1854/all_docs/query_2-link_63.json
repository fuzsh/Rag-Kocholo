A buddy of mine, had saved me a bunk in his houch. Which may have saved my life, that night we came under mortar attack. The center was overcrowed, and there was no bunks, so much of the troops where left to the tents, in an open area of the compound,6 or 7 men died that night, so many wounded.

As it was, one aircraft lost the tail section and another had a hole in the wing, so they swapped tails to get one flyable aircraft. Often wonder how the maintenance guys kept the books straight.\n\nI had an assignment to the 45th TRS at Misawa AB, Japan, after Vietnam, but in the summer of 1966 that squadron came to me instead, so I wound up with the 315th Air Division at Tachikawa instead, often flying with the C-130 missions around Vietnam.\n\nMemorable years indeed.\n\nName: Dan Grace, Dec 28, 2001\n\nURL:\n\nComments: Surfing the net, trying to gather info for a VA claim.

Licciardi, A1C E4 USAF, Det 1, 45th Tac Recon Squadron (PACAF)\n\nI was at Tan Son Nhut for over a two year period, from 1964 to Dec 14, 1966 and I took my separation in Viet Nam and flew to Tokyo where I attended Sophia University for four years on the GI Bill.\n\nI was in Det 1, 45th Tac Recon Squadron (PACAF) and was an Aircraft Mechanic. At first we were originally based in Misawa and our people would rotate every three months down to VN, so I was at Tan Son Nhut on and off and then our squadron finally got permanently based at Tan Son Nhut. I had five months left to go in the service and spent that time in VN. I was the first one to leave VN from my squadron. While I was there, the base was attacked and the first mortar hit a ground power unit that was standing between the two RF101 Voodoos I was assigned to take care of. I was on mid shift and both of the birds came back without any pilot write-ups (highly unusual as something was always out of wack and needed attention). Also unusual was that my Sgt. came along and checked the forms and finding no write-ups said I could \"make my break,\" also unusual since they usually wanted us to stay until the replacements came at the next shift that ended at midnight. I left at about 10:30 and got back to the barracks and hopped into the shower and heard the first motar hit my ground power unit ... at about 11pm (Not exactly sure of the time) I looked towards the runway and saw a tower of flame coming from my reventment. If I had been there I would have been right near the MD-3 ground power unit and my name would have been on the black wall in Washington D.C. I will never forget it. I was so impressed by the Army guys, they jumped into their Huey Gun Choppers and were in the air over the runway so damn fast, firing their 50 caliber machine guns with tracers loaded every 5th round, and from where we were standing it looked like a solid neon light from the choppers to the ground. When they released the trigger you could make out the individual tracer rounds as the fire tapered off. We were standing on the barracks roof cheering them on while Puff the Magic Dragon was dropping parachute flares to light up the runway.\n\nI had two other close calls, I was dating a pretty VN girl who would not go out with me without a chaparone who was her girlfriend. After a great dinner and a lot of dancing in Saigon, her girlfriend had to get home and she lived in the rice paddies just outside Saigon. The cab stopped on a dirt road and Chi (her name) wanted to go to the farm house to say goodnite to her parents, I wanted to go, but she wouldn't let me, so I waited in the cab with the driver. While she was in the farm house, some truck lights appeared behind us down the road and the cab driver started babbling Vietnamese and pushing me down onto the floor of the cab. I managed to sneak a look at the truck as it went by and could see it was canvas covered and the back was open and I could see two rows of legs with kaki trousers and feet in sandals. When Chi got back I asked her what all the commotion was about and she translated what the cab driver said, that we have to be careful because there were a lot of VC moving around at night. I told her \"let's get outta here!\" We went to her sister-in-laws house whose husband was a Vietnamese Navy officer who patrolled the Mekong and he told me in English, that the VC can get the kakis but they can't get the boots, so if you see kakis with sandals, chances are they are VC.\n\nAnother close call. The day came for my discharge in VN and I got a letter of permission from the first Sargeant to stay in the barracks until my flight came in. I went to Saigon and had some civilian clothes order made at a Chinese Taylor to take to Japan with me. When it came time to pick them up I went back to Saigon which was to be my last trip there and coming out of the taylor I hailed down one of the hundreds little blue and yellow cabs and told the driver Tan Son Nhut. I was soon aware he was not taking the route I was framiliar with and we were heading out of Saigon. I could no longer see any military nor White Mice (VN police). I kept telling him Tan Son Nhut and he was trying to distract me asking if I wanted \"number one girl.\" He pulled up and stopped on a little island surounded by rice paddies and there was a building there and only two trees standing. He pulled the keys out of the ignition and jumped out of the cab and headed straight to the building ... my heart beat was racing and addrenalin pumping sensing the danger I was in and looked around entertaining a ridiculous thought of grabbing my clothes and climbing one of the trees to hide in hoping they wouldn't look up when \"they\" came back out. I had heard the rumors that went around of VCs posing as cab drivers to pick up a GI to get information before an attack, and that was all I needed was to make it through the Viet Nam War, and then get captured while I was a civilian. Just then another cab pulls up going in the opposite direction, a young girl in Ao Dai gets out and pays the cabbie, I grab my stuff and run over to the cab and jump in and repeated VC, VC! He wanted to overcharge me for the rate back to Tan Son Nhut and I agreed. When we got back to the main gate I told the U.S. Army MP about the incident, but never got the guy's license number so, there was nothing he could do.\n\nI often wonder would would have happened to me, if that other cab didn't come along. We were young, in excellent shape, and never so alive as we were being so close to death. Thanks for the wonderful web site ... It definitely makes me feel that someone appreciates us.\n\nBob Licciardi\n\nName: Clyde H. Queen, Dec 08, 2001\n\nURL:\n\nComments: Greetings,\n\nI was surprised to find this Web page, but glad to see that it exists.\n\nAlthough I was not active duty military, I served at Tan Son Nhut with the RMK-BRJ Co., a Naval Contractor. I was an Investigator with their Security Department, and my office was located on the back side of the Airport.\n\nAs I recall, a VN Army Major by the name of Thieu ran the Base, and every VN civilian that worked for us, was related to him. (It was the only way we could hire anyone, they had to be related to him.)\n\nAfter about a year, I moved into the main office downtown Saigon at #12 Thong Nhut, at the corner of Thong Nhut and Tu Do Streets.

Queen, Sr.\n\nName: Bill Marras, Dec 07, 2001\n\nURL:\n\nComments: My name is Bill Marras, I was at Tan Son Nhut from July 1966 to June 1967, I believe, have to check my DD214 for the exact dates. I was an E-3 in the Air Force and a jet engine mechanic. We were the VOODOO Witch Doctors and worked on RF-101's. I also did some work on Phantoms and a couple of converted black Canberra boomers that were used for night recon.\n\nReading through these entries I get insights to Tet that I didn't have when I lived through it. Us mechanics were not allowed to have weapons on a regular basis (good thing) during Tet. It may not mean much after thirty years but my thanks to the Air Police and all the other troops who kept us mechanics safe.\n\nIs there a place that I can see a map of the entire base?

I was a Major at the time and served as a Operations Support Officer (Navigator) etc.\n\nI have marked the site and will get back to you. I, like all the others, vividly remember the events of Jan 1968 and the rocket attacka in Feb. That evening ended my stay in one BOQ behind the VNAF Catholic chapel and resulted in my moving to the \"Momyer Kennels\" near the main gate. My daily route took me by the SP formation in the late afternoon and still remain the respect and esteem I held for the those individuals then and now.\n\nGood show.\n\nKeith W.

Until I was re-assigned to Nha Trang AB with numerous TDYs over the last 5 months including Bien Hoa, LBJ ranch (on the outside) and Hon Tre Island. An army radar post located between Nha Trang and Cam Rahn Bay. I was stationed at the TSN Main Gate, the night of the 68 TET offensive.\n\nI remember deploying at the main gate in a 6 pack (small covered pick-up truck) and as we hit the ground, I could feel the impact of the rounds hitting the ground around me and kicking dirt in my eyes and up my nose. The weapons fire was coming from the top floor windows of a hotel directly across from the Main gate. It was eventually silenced when either some ARVNs or Korean ROKs repelled off the roof top and took them out with frags.\n\nThe rest of the night was total caos for me and my next clear recollection was lying in a trench along some main road and watching some army tank battalion rolling in. That was the first time I closed my eyes in 32 hours ...... Does anyone know What tank battalion that was? I sure felt good when I saw those guys show up.\n\nMy condolences to the friends and families of my fallen brothers at Bunker 0-51\n\nMac\n\nP.S. I'm enclosing a poem I wrote in attachments.

It is ironic how I was introduced to it. This evening I received a phone call from the past. It was Gary Swelander, a fellow Air Force radio operator who was assigned with me to the 1876th Comm Sq, Tan Son Nhut AB from 1967 - 1968. I hadn't heard from Gary or talked with him since he left TSN thrity three years ago. He said he tracked me down via the internet and wanted to tell me about this great site. I have read all of the stories that are posted on this site, and they brought back a lot of memories.\n\nI was the NCOIC of the MARS (Military Affiliate Radio System) station on Tan Son Nhut AB from Jan 1967 to Jan 1968. It was our job as the Net Control Station to not only run \"phone patches\" from personnel of all branches of the service to to their loved ones in the CONUS, but also to insure that all the other MARS stations in country operated likewise. I am happy to say that during that one year period the MARS stations throughout Vietnam completed thousands of phone patches, thanks to Senator Barry Goldwater (AFA7UGA), and the Collins Radio Company of Cedar Rapids Iowa.\n\nI am attaching photos of the 1876th Comm Sq, MARS Station as it appeared in 1967, and some of it's personnel celebrating Christmas 12/25/67. The station was located directly across from the Heli-port.\n\nThe guys in the picture are:\n\nBack Row Standing Left to Right:\n\nA1C Center\n\nSSgt Connell\n\nSSgt Negro (Me)\n\nSSgt Gutowski\n\nFront Row Kneeling Left to Right\n\nSgt Work\n\nSgt Miller\n\nSgt Campbell\n\nI hope to hear from some of these guys or anyone else who was with the 1876th or who may have used the MARS facility during that period.

While I was at TSN I worked on the C-130's as an electrician for, Det 1 834th Air Division. I worked for the 315th Air Division Route Support Traffic while at Danang. I am trying to find documentation and or pics that will confirm that Danang was mortored, attacked and over run sometime during Thanksgiving of 1968. I am also trying to locate Steve Hamer, Tom Robbs and Ron Seckler who also served there either at the same time or around the same time. Steve and Tom worked with me in the electric shop at Clark Air Base form 68 thru 69. Ron was at Danang with me, he worked in the jet engine shop.

I am just checking out this site.\n\nMy Dad, Jerry Ingalsbe, served on Tan Son Nhut from 1967 to 1968. He was there for the TET Offensive in 1968. Vietnam is a part of my Dad's life that I will never be able to understand because it is something that changed him very much and that he is not able to talk about a lot.\n\nLately he has started feeling more comfortable discussing things. I know that it had a tremendous effect on my Dad's personality. I am sad that he had to go there, but I am very proud of his bravery and willingness to serve his country when called upon. I hope our country learned a lesson from Vietnam, but I wonder with what happened in Somalia, about supporting our troops where ever they may be. We must always stand behind our military ... and our government shouldn't send them into places that they don't mean to be successful in their mission.\n\nI hope we will keep this in mind as we have already sent our military over to Afghanistan and elsewhere. Two other men stationed on Tan Son Nhut were Mel Grover and Bernie DeNisio. These men and my Dad have remained lifelong friends, bound by experiences too terrible to mention. Thankfully, something great and wonderful came out of their service ... Friendship. I have known these guys all my life ... they are the brothers my Dad never had. I have a great picture of them and will try to scan it and send it to you to add to your photos.\n\nThank you,\n\nMisti Anderson\n\nPS - You have my Dad's name spelled incorrectly under your Officers section. It is there as Englesby, but it should be Ingalsbe.\n\nThanks!\n\nFROM THE WEB MASTER: The web master has placed on the Tan Son Nhut Association, the proposed TSNA Constitution.

Two tours were in Pleiku in the Central Highlands (1967 and 1969-70). I also served with DOD at MACV Headquarters 1972-73 with duties as a liaison to the 509th Radio Research Group and the US Embassy and, in 1974-75, as a DAO advisor to the ARVN Special Security Technical Branch. My living quarters were at the Massachusetts BOQ, BOQ One, the Duc Hotel and a townhouse on Don Dat Street in downtown Saigon.\n\nI can recall the drives to and from TSN from downtown could be quite exciting thru the streets crammed with cyclos, motorized pedicabs, bicycles, motorbikes, autos, trucks and just about anything else with wheels! The bar scene around the base was also interesting: How many remember names like the VNAF Club on TSN, the My Linh on Cach Mang Street and Steve's back in an alley off Cach Mang?\n\nSadly, I still remember how my last tour concluded. All of our ARVN counterparts sensed it was near the end, and my co-workers and I had trouble facing them. As Pan Am 842 lifted off TSN on April 15, 1975, I wondered what fate held for the \"Little People\" and their families when North Vietnamese troops would finally prevail.\n\nWithin two weeks, it was all over. The Communists marched victoriously into Saigon. I learned later that very few of our Vietnamese friends got out--thanks to poor planning or indifference by the US government -- and that many of them spent from two years to 14 years in North Vietnamese prison camps. Some died from the cruel treatment, but, when I visited in 1993, I was able to locate a small number of them. To my surprise, they held no ill will. The Bier 33 flowed freely!\n\nI've been privileged to read some very touching stories on this website. As you can see, my memories of Vietnam range from very good to very bad -- probably just like most of you. Hopefully, the website will endure and produce more guys (and gals) coming out of the woodwork with additonal stories of their Vietnam experience around the airbase.\n\nSPECIAL REQUEST: I've been asked by a Vietnamese friend here in Maryland to try to locate a GI who reportedly left Vietnam in October, 1969. His name is John L. Jones, RA ????????. A photo shows him to be about 21 years old, glasses, a mustache and dark hair combed straight back. He had a girlfriend named \"Mai\" and is said to have been stationed or lived in the TSN area at \"Dodge City - MACV - Room Number 206.\" The source believes he is from California, but his serial number prefix \"16\" indicates he enlisted in either Illinois, Michigan or Wisconsin (I have gathered a long list of \"John L. Jones\" addresses and phone numbers from the Internet, but I thought I would try this avenue first). Any info you can provide would be helpful. Thanks much.

My complements to the officers of the TSNA and especially to the Webmaster. You have created an outstanding site and should be proud of your accomplishments.\n\nI was a member of Alpha Co., 69th Signal Battalion, 2nd Signal Group, 1st. Signal Brigade from June, 1966 to June, 1967. The Battalion HQ along with \"A Co.\" enlisted barracks was stationed at Camp Gaylor on Tan Son Nhut but our signal sites were throughout Saigon, Long Binh, Nha Trang, and Can Tho.\n\nI remember serving with an outstanding group of men, officers and enlisted, during that time. It didn't take very long for a green 2nd Lt. to learn that the best place to be was as close as possible to one of the experienced warrants or non-coms and listening closely so as to learn as much as possible as quickly as possible. I truly believe that I served with some of the best non-coms in the Army, unfortunately time has erased most of their names and faces. However, there are always some like our Company \"Top\", 1st SGT Maples, and my platoon sergeant, SFC Medford that made such an impression that I'll never forget them. Our BOQ was downtown Saigon at the Kai Minh (sp??) and I remember the drive through the city to \"fin de Pasteur\" to get there.\n\nMany thanks for creating this great all-inclusive forum for all of us to share.

A TSGT Crewy was in charge and we also had a SSgt Celoni who work in this portion of training. I might say that we had the best OJT section in all of Vietnam.\n\nOne testing cycle (5 and 7 level) we tested 568 Security policeman and all passed but two. A letter from the Air Force stated that no one had tested as many with the outstanding results. We had only 8 exams and had to shuttle 8 troop at at time to the test site. Lt Tucker (now retired Col) was the officer in charge, along with Maj Bender, Ops Officer, Lt Col Carter , Commander. The next thing I know Crewy went on flight duty, and soon I was in charge of all training.\n\nDuring TET, I was assigned to Army 1.

I remember all the faces that are fixed in time staring back at me but I can only put one name to one of the faces, Bob McCoy. I really liked Bob and have thought of him many times over the years. Why him and not the others? I really dont know. The others, now looking at them in the picture, I can remember the sound of their voices, how they laugh and cried, but their names escape me. We were just a bunch of young kids, most of us away from the ones we loved for the first time. When someone got good news from home, they would read it out for all to hear, when my son took his first step, I had to tell everyone. You get to be like one big family, yes even in the not getting alone end to. How I wish I had kept some kind of record, their names, where they were from, but I didnt. I would like to ask them how everything was with them. I wonder if they are all still alive, I hope so. I hope life has been good to them especially in love and family.\n\nName: Peter E.

He also did some TDY at Cam Ranh Bay in 68.\n\nWhat I'm looking for, is anyone that served with him, particularly, anyone that might remember his being wounded during his time in country. He never received a Purple Heart for his wounds, even though I clearly remember seeing the pieces of shrapnel removed by military docs. (Some was left in place due to it's location).\n\nOne of the men he served with in 1968 was Ssgt Spang (A Pima Indian). He also wrote on one photo that Hanoi Hannah said that \"Gen.

Yeah we were kids. Sweating like hell not to misplot a target sending a crew off to some other place in possible problems. It was a really great bunch of folks to work with and play hard with.\n\nI will always remember my two greatest heros from that time. A great NCO, MSGT Collis Ivery who I later had the pleasure to work for in Germany. A great example of what I wanted to be. One of his sons serves today and recently made Lt Col. Col Lovic T. Hodnett (I sure hope I spelled his name correct) was the DO and showed more leadership and concern for the troops.

Anyone who was in the 16th TRS, 12th TRS, 360th TEWS, Det #1 45 TRS, FMS, RTS, AEMS,& HHQ were members of the 460th TRW. God knows there were other units attached to the wing but unfortunately the sands of time have erased their titles. It might prove interesting to build a wiring diagram of all the units at TSN. Would take some work but believe the technology exists.\n\nPlease update the date of Larry M. Schoenhals passing on the members memorial page. Larry passed away on Jan 6, 2001 and is buried in the town cemetery at Darrouzett, Texas. The association owes it to Larry to update his passing.

I was a Sgt. in the 377th Security Police Squadron at the time of TET in 1968. I was on a quick response team that morning going to the 0-51 Bunker. I was manning the M-60 machine gun, and got hit very early on, (probably about 3:30-4:00).\n\nTo this day I am not positive what it was but it was either rocket or mortar shrapnel which almost passed through my body. I spent the next 3 years in various hospitals, receiving my medical retirement in October of 1971. I have never been able to talk with anyone that was with me during that time, but yesterday, my wife received a call from Major Carl A. Bender.\n\nHis was one of the few names I remembered from that night. He told me of things I had no idea of. I thought he took me to a dispensary in a jeep, but he explained that he had dragged me to the jeep with another man who had been hit in the arm. He is still trying to find out who this is. I have no recollection. Major Bender told me the person who drove the jeep was actually Lt. Grover. I can only recall being transported to 3rd Field Hospital in Saigon. I was there for I think a couple of weeks, when they sent me to Japan, then back to Chanute Air Base in Illinois. I have never known the real story of that night until I started looking around the internet and found all of this information about Tan Son Nhut and the Security Police.\n\nNow I want to find out all I can, and try to find other airman who fought that night. I can't tell you how I feel about Lt.. Grover and Major Bender. I plan on meeting with Major Bender in the near future, as we do not live that far apart. There is so much I want to know. I would like to become a member of the Tan Son Nhut Association, and I am not sure how, but I would appreciate any information you can give me.

Well here goes... (I hope I have this right.)\n\nThere were two facilities in the area. One was directly across from the airbase. That facility was operated by 377th POL (USAF). The second facility (closer to Saigon) was operated by the Petroleum Distribution (PD) Detachment of the 223rd Supply & Transport Bn (USA) and was under the command of the 64th QM Bn (PO). To distinguish between the two, ask yourself if you saw a dusty white trailer on wheels to the right of the gate as you drove in. If you did, that is the US Army (223rd S&T) facility. If not, it was the USAF (377 POL) facility. What made matters worse is that personnel from both facilities were barracked at Camp Redball.\n\nIII Corps and IV Corps US Army area command was even more confusing. All POL distribution was under the control of 64th QM Bn.\n\n- POL facilities were located at Long Binh (64 QM) and Tan Son Nhut (223 S&T). - 64 QM ran pipeline from barge point at Dong Nai to Long Binh.\n\n- Transport units were 47th, 512th, 518th, 537th, 538th and 556th.\n\n- Tan Son Nhut POL Lab was detachment from Co A, 223rd S&T Bn.\n\n- Long Binh POL Lab was detachment from 525th QM Co (PD), 524 QM Bn (PO) in Cam Rahn Bay.\n\nAll food distribution was under the control of 67th QM Bn and 3rd Supply Bn.\n\n- Major distribution centers where Saigon, Tan Son Nhut, Long Binh, Bien Hoa.\n\nAll ammunition distribution was under the control of the 3rd Supply Bn.\n\n- I know only of the 3rd Ordinance Depot in Long Binh, although others existed.\n\nAll other distribution was under the control of 223rd S&T Bn.\n\n- includes 67th QM Bn supply depot in Long Binh\n\n- includes 223rd Transport maintenance in Tan Son Nhut\n\n- includes 64th Engineers maintenance in Long Binh\n\nIf your truck was a fuel tanker, and it said \"PETRO-MAIN\", it was under the command of 64 QM Bn. Anything else, your guess is as good as mine.\n\nName: Mike Mohr, Apr 30, 2001\n\nURL:\n\nComments: You and your comrades are to be commended for your excellent portrayal of the events in and around Tan Son Nhut AB. I was stationed with 525th QM Lab Det, 64th QM Bn (PD), Long Binh during the period 22 July 1967 - 18 Apr 1968 and would occasionally relieve lab staff at the 223 S&T Bn (POL) facility. I was not aware that things heated up around Tan Son Nhut earlier than Long Binh. Our earliest contact in Long Binh was 10 Feb 1968 when the VC attempted to blow up 3rd Ordinance Depot. We had one short round fall just outside the 64th Bn tank farm for which we got a written apology!?! I guess petrol was a golden commodity about then.\n\nName: Jim Downey, Apr 23, 2001\n\nURL:\n\nComments: I just viewed your web site and thought it was great. I'll be sending in my membership.

I was later selected to Heavy Weapons sector which provided support for base perimeter positions. I drove an Armored Personell Carrier (APC) with two M-60 caliber machine guns and a cache of ammunition for bunker resupply if needed. With us at night, would be a quad-50 unit and V-100 units. During my tenure, there were two APC units which patrolled during the night hours. One of the V-100 units had a mini-gun mounted, which was a little unusual and generally attributed to \" Puff the Magic Dragon \". I believe Heavy Weapons came into it's own after the loss of life during TET, Jan 1968. Having started out working the bunkers myself I felt a certain committment to those guys. In hindsight, it was an honor to work with the best young men the air force could offer.\n\nName: Charles Penley, Apr 05, 2001\n\nURL:\n\nComments: The email from Mr Doe was important, for the knowledge that he had to offer was indeed important.

However, this is the first, I have heard of these names.\n\nName: Jack Lee, Apr 04, 2001\n\nURL:\n\nComments: My name is Jack Lee. I was stationed at Tan Son Nhut from July, 1967 until April, 1968 when I was summoned home because of my mother's illness. While home, I applied for and received a compassionate reassignment to Fort Benning, Georgia .... about 90 miles from my (then)home of Albany, Georgia. My mother died shortly after my reassignment came through, but I remained at Fort Benning for the balance of my enlistment.\n\nI was in the 509th Radio Research Group and was billeted at Davis Station on Tan Son Nhut. When I first arrived in-country in July, I worked at our HQ, located on Tan Son Nhut. A few months later, we moved the HQ to a new building on the ARVN base.\n\nI was part of a guard detail assigned to our HQ building after the TET 1968 Offensive started up north. At about 0300 hrs., on January 31, 1968, all hell broke loose in Saigon. I was part of the first guard outside at that time. I remember the butterflies in my stomach as I put on my flak jacket and grabbed my M-14 (we weren't issued M-16's). My post was located at the left rear corner of the building. When I ran outside to take up my post, I entered a surreal world that until then, I had only known from movies ... explosive booms, and small arms fire. I can't say that I was scared ... I guess at that time the reality really hadn't set in. Our building was surrounded by a tall corrugated tin fence with barbed wire at the top. I was about four feet away from the fence, so the fence was all I could see.\n\nI guess at the time, I didn't give much thought about the only thing seperating me from a stray round was that thin tin fence. The pink glow of the flares dropped from the old bulky ARVN choppers overhead added to the surreal quality of the night. Reality must have set in sooner for my fellow guard at the other corner of the building because I remember looking his way once only to see him squatting and voiding himself. Later after I was relieved and went back inside to catch some sleep, and after the adrenilin had abated, then reality did take hold. I began shaking as if I were freezing. I guess I was fortunate for that delayed reaction. My friend was apparantly not so lucky.\n\nThe next day, once again on guard, but at a post in front of the building, I witnessed something that will forever be imprinted in my memory. We had just learned that the top floor of the U.S. Embassy had been taken over by the VC. I don't know now exactly how far from the Embassy our HQ was, but it couldn't have been more than a few blocks away. I watched as Huey Cobras fired mini-guns and rockets at the Embassy as part of an action to free the Embassy of the VC. I was amazed at the agility of the small aircraft ... not unlike a dragon fly darting and turning and zooming about. I felt an immense sense of pride in our Army aviators at that time. Later we learned that 27 brave MP's had died defending the Embassy. I was glad that I was witness to some payback for that.\n\nPrior to TET of '68, I really hadn't given much thought to not making it home alive. I guess in my mind, the real war was in the jungles. As of TET, I was reminded very much so that I was indeed in Vietnam. Oh, there were occasional mortars lobbed onto the airfield next to Davis Station before TET, but somehow, the war was still distant .... I can't really explain it, but I guess I knew that our billets weren't the primary target p... go figure ... I was just a stupid kid, I guess. After TET, however, I did a lot of soul-searching and sobering up to the fact that I was indeed in harm's way ever second of every day in-country. As a result, I missed my loved ones even more, I suppose, and was more depressed than I had been before.\n\nWithin a few months after returning home, my brother, an 11B SSG, was sent over. He served in the 9th Infantry Division, first as a sniper, then as a sniper instructor. I think I need to take this opportunity to voice a thanks for all the \"grunts\" who really went through hell over there. They are really the ones who carried the war for the rest of us. My brother, Robert, has and always will have my utmost respect. He never talks about his experiences ... and I don't ask .... but I'm sure they are as vivid in his memory today as when he was there.\n\nI hope my narrative hasn't exceeded by too much the norm for this fourm, but, the words just flowed as I sat here and remembered.

I was in the Air Force and assigned to the 1876th Communications Sq. My duty station was the torn tape relay station. If you worked there during that time I would really love to hear from you. One thing I really regret about being in the war was I didn't get the names and addresses of my friends when I rotated home.\n\nTET was probably the most memorable time in Vietnam. I was wounded the first day of TET and spent some time in the hospital. The second memory was that after TET they gave all us Air Force folks a flak jacket, helmet, and a canteen. Understood the flak jacket and helmet, but the canteen? You guessed it -- beer.\n\nI really enjoy the association's web site and the Revetments news letter. Because of the newsletter, I recently contacted Terry Love (69th Signal Battalion) who was taking photographs in the area, and at the same time, where I was wounded. He has recently sent me some photos of the day, and wow, what memories.\n\nBill Burckhalter\n\nName: Name Unknown, Apr 01, 2001\n\nURL:\n\nComments: Looking for anyone connected with the 7 th Finance Disbursing Section whose office was just in back of USASGV Headquarters building and aside of the fence surrounding the Air Force Hanger.

Please add my unit: US Army Engineer Command USARV/MACV HQ TSN/Saigon.\n\nI arrived at Tan Son Nhut, in June 72, during the same time as the Watergate break in. My unit moved from US Army HQs, in Long Binh, when the US Army moved its HQs to TSN sometime in late 1972.\n\nSome of my unit stayed at the Hotel Walling in Saigon. I used to make mail runs in a truck or jeep from Long Binh to TSN. Sometimes we came under small arms fire or grenade attacks in Saigon. I remember listening to a live Super Bowl broadcast in the middle of the night from Armed Forces Network, Jan 73 (Miami 14 Washington 7). My CO was Col Russell Lamp from Wash DC., CSGM from Long Binh was Leo Coates. We went through a rocket attack at TSN in Dec 72. This was after Nixon started bombing Cambodia. I have pictures and an article from Stars and Stripes. I left TSN on March 29, 1973 \"X+60\". I remember seeing the VC standing on the tarmac as we got on the plane home! I would like to hear from anyone who was with my unit in country during the time June 72 - March 73.\n\nThanks,\n\nSP4 David S.

Had just finished TDY tour at Bien Hoa with the 377th Security Police Squadron, Det 1. Spent several tours of duty outside of Peace Commission talks which began at Tan Son Nhut, in January 1973. I recall the humiliation of standing next to VC counterpart during the talks. NLF Delegation had been afforded the comforts of Camp Alpha during peace talks.\n\nSecretary Kissinger and Vice President Agnew had been through TSN, evidently, to convince RSVN President Thieu that the bogus peace pact was a good one. Anyway our bags were packed and it was obvious that we were leaving any day. At some point after returning from Bien Hoa, our 377th SPS air base defense unit was incorporated into the 377th SPS Law Enforcement unit. I think this is how I found myself on the Main Gate at TSN on the final night of the 1973 American military withdrawal from Vietnam.\n\nIt was not like the chaotic end of the American presence in RSVN which was to occur in 1975. As a matter of fact, it looked like it was just going to be another long and boring late shift. The lumbering C-130 gun ship circled above, dropping illuminating flares and it was approaching 2 A.M. My Quah Canh (QC) partner and I were somewhat surprised when a deuce and a half pulled up and the driver said to me, \"Get On.\" I think, I hesitated for half a second and was about to say goodbye to the QC. But he turned his back on us, not looking very pleased. I don't blame him. I knew and he knew that his future was not too bright. I very quickly got over his problem and hopped onto the back of the truch.\n\nBack in the contonement area, we changed into khaki uniforms and were transported out to the flight line. To my astonishment, two TWA 747's were parked on the tarmac. Cool! Maybe they had round eyed stewardesses aboard! It seemed like forever that we stood loosely about in ranks and the large, bright orange sun was beginning to come up. It was daylight when a convoy of vehicles pulled up. Out alighted all kinds of official looking people.\n\nI recall at least one table being set up with chairs. An NLF official was chatting on a field phone. And I'll never forget the female VC with a green chiffon scarf wrapped around her pith helmet. She began photographing us with an old (I think, eastern-block) camera. We began to board. Some of us flipped the female VC the bird. \"VC, beaucoupe toom-toom!\"\n\nA1C George T.

I am currently in the Air Force as Security Forces and doing some research on Louis H. Ficsher, as well, my father was an Air Policeman at Tan Son Nhut from Nov 64 to Nov 65. He arrived on a Wednesday morning and no sooner cleared the Tan Son Hut airport teminal before bombs ripped through it. He could also recall clearly a time in May, May 16 to be exact, seeing large explosions and hearing blast some miles away. It was a series of explosions at Bien Hoa. Stars and Stripes reported it as a disaster not caused by the enemy, but dad recalls differently. He recalled several things along those lines, things hard for him to recall. After talking to him for some length on things during that time, I stumbled onto your page. It is very informative and helped tie things together. Things today are much like then, Air Base Defense has come a long way, but at a great cost.

We were trucked to gate 51 and stayed on a firing line there for what seemed like an eternity. We were nothing but a handful of scrawny clerks and regimental types who had no real business meeting the enemy. I don't know how much ammunition was expended on that firing line, but it was a bunch.\n\nMy purpose in writing this is twofold. First, we lost a friend of mine there that night-a fine combat photographer named John L. Nielson from Maryland. His name belongs on this site memorialized in some way as much as anyone's does. The other purpose is to thank the Air Force security guy, a sergeant, to whom we were given for deployment that night. He went up and down our firing line for a long time and through a lot of gunfire keeping us organized and functioning.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that all of our group would have been killed that night had we been without the leadership of this man. Whoever you are, I thank you. My two children would not have seen this world had it not been for your courage.\n\nTom Shearon\n\nFROM THE WEB MASTER: I was also there for TET 1968. I was at a \"Special Post,\" adjacent to Central Security Control (CSC) intersection. Task Force-35, consisted of three (3) U.S. Army platoons on that fateful night.

The book details the 377th SPS's Battle at Tan Son Nhut Airbase, as well as the 3rd SPS's Battle at Bien Hoa Airbase.\n\nI am presently researching a book about the battles fought in Saigon during the so-called Mini-Tet Offensive of May 1968. I would like to hear from any 377th SPS veterans who were at Tan Son Nhut, during this second wave of communist urban attacks. Please contact me at this address:\n\nKeith W. Nolan\n\nHCR 32, Box 68\n\nBlackwell MO 63626-9606\n\nI am especially anxious to hear from individuals who can speak to two bizarre rumors that grew out of the May 1968 action in Saigon. The first rumor is that a three-striper from the 377th SPS opened fire with an M16 from a radar tower, shooting two airman who were exiting a messhall; in response to this sniper fire, so the story goes, an ARVN paratrooper unit blew the radar tower and the three-striper to pieces with a barrage of rifle and machine-gun fire.\n\nThe second rumor is that a team of VC hit the Tan Son Nhut perimeter in May 1968, and that this team included a U.S. Army deserter living in Saigon who had been pressed into service by the enemy to help guide them through the airbase perimeter defenses.\n\nDoes anyone out there know anything about these incidents? As noted, I'd be much obliged to hear from anyone who served at Tan Son Nhut in May 1968.\n\nFROM THE WEB MASTER: I have purchased and given away approximately thirteen (13) of Keith William Nolan's book, \"The Battle For Saigon, TET 1968.\" Having given them to other active duty historians and friends.

I arrived at Tan Son Nhut on or about April 16, 1966 and was assigned to the 2nd Signal Group there on the base (Camp Gaylor?) At about 2;00 a.m. the following morning, there was an intense mortar attack apparently intended to destroy as many helicopters as possible. Unfortunately, several rounds slammed into a small transit compound nearby, killing or wounding 6 or 7 men, who were either spending their 1st nite in-country or on their way home the next day. By the grace of God, I was not there, but only because my duty assignment was with the 2nd Sig Group.\n\nHowever from the sandbagged bunker (not really a bunker, just sandbags piled about 4 feet high) next to a perimeter fence, Charlie was so close that I could hear the motars being dropped into the tubes and their ignition. I will never forget a guy walking guard outside the fence, while this was happening. He never missed a beat and continued his duty standing tall. I was convinced that they were going to come right up on us when they got thru with expending their shells and blow us away. Yes, I dirtied my underwear(hell .. its all I was wearing, with steel pot on my on my head). I didn't notice reference to that approximate date on your memorial. Maybe you would like to look in to that night.\n\nI could also hear the explosions and the sounds of at least one man screaming. That was my introduction to Vietnam. I probably have some photos taken in or around the base(I was PIO, but took all my own photos). I would be honored to share them with you when I get a chance to go thru them. After 35 years and even a return trip in 1995, I am still dealing with it and soon will go on the waiting list for Menlo Park.\n\nTony Betterton, April 1966 -- March 1967\n\nEverywhere there was a signal site and too many events like the one I just described, sometimes up close and too personal.\n\nName: Peter Beyette, Feb 11, 2001\n\nURL:\n\nComments: This is my first visit and I noted that my unit is not on the membership list.
