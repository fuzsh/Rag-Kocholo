        "text": "Main text\n\nThe World Health Organization has now designated five variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as variants of concern, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529). The Omicron variant has recently been divided into four sub-lineages: BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3 ( A). The original Omicron (BA.1 sub-lineage) was first identified in Botswana and South Africa in November 2021 (Viana et al., 2022) and together with its derivative BA.1.1 (containing an extra spike R346K mutation) became dominant worldwide in replacement of Delta over the span of a few weeks. But subsequently, we saw a rapid surge in the proportion of BA.2, and this sub-lineage became the dominant variant globally. Compared with the BA.1 and BA.2 sub-lineages, the prevalence of BA.3 sub-lineage is currently very low ( B).\n\nBA.1, BA.2, and BA.3 have numerous mutations in common but also have distinct sets of mutations in their spike that can differentiate these sub-lineages ( C). Although the selective advantage of BA.2 could be partially explained by its higher transmissibility than BA.1 (Lyngse et al., 2022), their relative immune evasion property could also be counted. We (Ai et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022) and others (Cameroni et al., 2022; Cao et al., 2022; Carreño et al., 2022; Cele et al., 2022; Garcia-Beltran et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022; Planas et al., 2022; VanBlargan et al., 2022) have reported that BA.1 demonstrated considerable escape from neutralization by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and sera from vaccinated individuals. BA.2 has also been reported to severely dampen antibody neutralization (Bowen et al., 2022; Iketani et al., 2022). However, evaluation and comparison of susceptibility of all the major Omicron sub-lineages to vaccine-elicited or mAb-mediated neutralization are urgently needed. In this study, therefore, we constructed the Omicron sub-lineage pseudoviruses (PsVs) and compared side by side their neutralization sensitivity to vaccinee sera as well as a panel of mAbs.\n\nThe first question we asked for the Omicron sub-lineages is their extent of immune evasion of polyclonal antibody neutralizing activity elicited in humans after vaccination or infection. To answer this, we first assessed the neutralizing activity of sera from individuals vaccinated by two doses of inactivated whole-virion vaccines (BBIBP-CorV) (Table S1). Similar to what we reported before (Wang et al., 2022), although all the sera showed neutralization activity against wild-type (WT) virus, the activity was relatively weak, with geometric mean neutralizing titers (GMTs) about 55, and when it turned to BA.1, only two of 10 vaccinees showed marginal neutralization. When we tested these sera on the three other sub-lineages, most of them showed no detectable activity, except a few had very weak neutralization against BA.2 and BA.3 ( D and S1A). These results indicate that two-dose inactivated vaccine is inadequate to provide full protection against these newly emerging Omicron variants.\n\nOur previous study showed that a booster shot, either homologous or heterologous, can reduce Omicron BA.1 escape from neutralizing antibodies (Wang et al., 2022). To see if this is the case for the other Omicron sub-lineages, we then collected and tested 20 samples from healthy adults who had a third boosting vaccination shot with the same BBIBP-CorV vaccine (homologous booster group, Table S1). As shown in E and S1B, the sera had a neutralizing GMT against WT of 225 with 5- to 6-fold reduction against BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3 but at least 15 of 20 samples exhibiting detectable neutralizing activity against all four sub-lineages. We also collected 18 sera from individuals that received two doses of BBIBP-CorV followed by a protein subunit vaccine (ZF2001) 4–8 months later (heterologous booster group, Table S1). This cohort had higher neutralizing titers with GMTs of 537, 108, 81, 42, and 69 against WT, BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3, respectively. Although these numbers amount to 7- to 23-fold reductions of potency comparing Omicron sub-lineages to WT, almost all samples maintained detectable neutralizing activity against the Omicron variants ( F and S1C). The marked improvement in serum neutralization from individuals who received a booster dose over those who did not highlights the value of vaccine boosters for eliciting neutralizing antibody responses against Omicron sub-lineages.\n\nThe emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant led to an increasing number of breakthrough infection cases. To gain insight into their chance of re-infection by Omicron, we recruited 10 participants who were immunized with two-dose inactivated vaccines before being infected by the Delta variant (Table S1). Serum samples were obtained from them after 3–4 months of breakthrough infection and evaluated on WT and the four Omicron sub-lineage PsVs ( G and S1D). We found that breakthrough infection by Delta boosted the neutralizing antibody titers significantly to very high levels against WT virus (GMT = 1,740). However, the neutralization titers for Omicron sub-lineages were significantly reduced, more than 100-fold in comparison to WT. The reduction level was much higher than that of the homologous and heterologous vaccine booster groups, which may be associated with the antigenic difference between Delta and Omicron variants.\n\nTaking into account of all the serum samples, we also carried out a comparison between the original Omicron BA.1 and the newly emerging sub-lineages to see if there are inherent difference regarding their immune evasion properties. BA.1.1, with an additional R346K mutation on top of BA.1, showed slightly but statistically significant lower titers than BA.1. For BA.2 and BA.3, the neutralization titers were also lower than BA.1, which was mostly contributed by the heterologous booster group, indicating the receptor binding domain (RBD) subunit vaccine booster may induce some RBD-directed antibodies which could be evaded by the BA.2/BA.3 unique mutations (Figure S2).\n\nTo better understand these differences and examine which types of antibodies in serum lose their activity against these Omicron sub-lineages, we further evaluated the neutralization profile of a panel of 20 mAbs targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike. These included 10 authorized or approved mAbs with sequences available: REGN10987 (imdevimab) (Hansen et al., 2020), REGN10933 (casirivimab) (Hansen et al., 2020), LY-CoV555 (bamlanivimab) (Jones et al., 2021), CB6/LY-CoV016 (etesevimab) (Shi et al., 2020), S309 (sotrovimab) (Pinto et al., 2020), COV2-2130 (cilgavimab) (Zost et al., 2020), COV2-2196 (tixagevimab) (Zost et al., 2020), CT-P59 (regdanvimab) (Kim et al., 2021), Brii-196 (amubarvimab) (Ju et al., 2020), and LY-CoV1404 (bebtelovimab) (Westendorf et al., 2022), all of which are directed to RBD. We also included some other RBD-directed mAbs of interest, including 1–20, 2–15, 1–57, 2–7 (Liu et al., 2020); 2–36 (Liu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021) from our own collection and ADG-2 (Rappazzo et al., 2021) from Adagio Therapeutics; and four more NTD-directed mAbs, including 5–24, 4–18, 4–19 (Cerutti et al., 2021b; Liu et al., 2020), and 5–7 (Cerutti et al., 2021a; Liu et al., 2020). Overall, all four Omicron sub-lineages had severe impact on most of the antibodies, but they also showed important differences in neutralization patterns. Among the authorized or approved mAbs, seven were either totally inactive or severely impaired in neutralizing all four sub-lineages. S309, the only approved antibody found to retain its neutralizing activity against the original form of Omicron in our previous study (Wang et al., 2022), lost more neutralizing activity against BA.2 and BA.3. COV2-2130 completely lost its neutralizing activity against BA.1 and BA.1.1 while remaining largely active against BA.2 and BA.3. Luckily, LY-CoV1404, which has been granted emergency use authorization very recently, remained potent in neutralizing all Omicron sub-lineages, continuing to broaden its coverage of SARS-CoV-2 variants (Zhou et al., 2022). For the other RBD- or NTD-directed mAbs, none of them retained full neutralizing activity against all of the Omicron sub-lineages. Two class 4 antibodies, ADG-2 and 2–36, retained decent activity against BA.1 and BA.1.1 but lost their neutralizing activity completely against BA.2 and BA.3. Interestingly, 2-7, one of our class 3 antibodies, completely lost its neutralizing activity against BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.3 while remaining largely active against BA.2. A similar pattern was seen for another approved class 3 antibody, REGN10987. On the contrary, we found that the activity of 5-7, the non-supersite-directed NTD antibody, was partially retained against BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.3 but totally abolished against BA.2 ( A and S3 ).\n\nTo dissect the key mutations conferring antibody resistance and the specific mutations leading to the different neutralization patterns of Omicron sub-lineages, we constructed PsVs with each of the single-spike mutations alone or in combination, if they are spatially close, and tested them using the same panel of 20 mAbs. In total, 40 specific mutation viruses were tested, and their comprehensive neutralization profiles by these 20 mAbs are summarized in B as fold change in 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) relative to WT virus. For mutations affecting antibody activity, the first ones that caught our attention were S371L and S371F. Both broadly affected most of the RBD-directed mAbs, with S371F having a greater negative impact. Intriguingly, when we tested S371L, S373P, and S375F in combination, as they form a loop adjacent to a lipid-binding pocket (Dejnirattisai et al., 2022), we indeed observed synergistic effect of the triple serine mutations in the reduction of neutralization potency of some mAbs. Q493R appears to be another key mutation responsible for the loss in potency of many RBD antibodies, and again, when it was tested in combination with G496S and Q498R, apparent synergistic effect was seen for some mAbs (Table S2). G446S, which is lacking in BA.2 but presented in the other sub-lineages, may explain why COV2-2130 and 2-7 are not much affected by BA.2. Other mutations, such as D405N, K417N, N440K, E484A, and N501Y, distinctly affected the activity of different RBD-directed mAbs, most of which could be explained by the mutations falling into the antibody epitopes. For LY-CoV1404, as we saw for the Omicron sub-lineages, none of the single mutations significantly affected its neutralization potency, indicating that despite the constellation of spike mutations present in these viruses, there is still a patch within LY-CoV1404’s binding region that is not affected. For the NTD-directed mAbs, it was mostly the mutations falling into the NTD of the spike, including T19I, del24-26+A27S, and G142D+del142-145, that are responsible for the neutralization activity loss, as expected.\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant immediately raised alarms after its identification, and the scenario seems to getting worse, with the emerging Omicron sub-lineages, like BA.2, which has been reported to be inherently substantially more transmissible than BA.1 (Lyngse et al., 2022). Many research articles have been published studying the original Omicron BA.1 virus, but less is known about the BA.2 and other sub-lineages. Here in this study, we constructed all the major Omicron sub-lineage viruses to date—BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3—and investigated their antibody evasion property in parallel.\n\nWe previously reported the markedly reduced neutralizing activity against BA.1 of convalescent or BBIBP-CorV vaccination sera (Ai et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022). Here, we showed that all polyclonal sera also had a substantial loss in neutralizing activity against the other Omicron sub-lineages, with drops comparable to or even greater than that of BA.1, indicating that all these sub-lineages have a very far antigenic distance from the WT virus. Our results are quite comparable to studies on the mRNA vaccines (Iketani et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022), showing that neutralizing antibody titer against BA.2 was similar to or lower than that against BA.1. Based on these, we suggest that the selective advantage of BA.2 over BA.1 should be mainly contributed by its higher transmissibility rather than by immune evasion. On the other hand, we showed that a third homologous inactivated vaccine booster or a heterologous protein subunit vaccine booster could significantly elevate neutralization titer against BA.1 (Wang et al., 2022). This is also true for the other Omicron sub-lineages. Most recently, three recombinant lineages (XD, XE, and XF) have been reported (UK_Health_Security_Agency, 2022), but their antibody evasion should not be significantly different from the Omicron sub-lineages studied here, since their spikes are identical to either BA.1 or BA.2. Therefore, promotion and popularization of vaccine booster injection is still an effective means to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission.\n\nWe also investigated the immune evasion capacity of Omicron sub-lineages with mAbs. Similar to what we reported for BA.1 (Wang et al., 2022), most mAbs lost their neutralizing activity against BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3 completely or substantially. But we did observe some distinct neutralization patterns for certain mAbs among these sub-lineages, reflecting their different mutations. For example, S309 and 5-7, targeting some unique sites in RBD (Pinto et al., 2020) or NTD (Cerutti et al., 2021a), were the two mAbs reported to retain largely activity against BA.1 (Liu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022), but their activity was further abolished by BA.2. On the contrary, some mAbs such as COV2-2130 and 2-7 totally lost activity against BA.1 but regained activity against BA.2. The good news is that LY-CoV1404 or bebtelovimab kept its potent neutralization activity against all Omicron sub-lineages and other major SARS-CoV-2 variants (Westendorf et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022). Our data are in good consistency with others (Iketani et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022) regarding the mAb neutralization profile of the Omicron sub-lineages and single mutations, but we had more sub-lineage—BA.3—and combined some mutations in proximity to investigate their synergistic actions.\n\nAlthough LY-CoV1404 currently remains as our hope for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic antibodies, resistance may arise sometime if it is administered as mono-therapy for a prolonged period, given the error-prone property of RNA virus. Therefore, it is advisable to develop more potent and broad neutralizing antibodies to be administered as a cocktail to contain this ever-evolving pathogen. Meanwhile, vaccine boosters, either homologous or heterologous, could elicit neutralizing antibodies that help reduce the viral escape and should be pushed forward."
