a rose am I\n\nTo lose me in sweet music’s swell?\n\nFor I too have the gift of song\n\nWhich gives me courage to complain,\n\nBut ah! ‘tis none but God Himself\n\nWhom I, in sorrow, must arraign!\n\nI grant that we have earned repute\n\nAs ever reconciled to Fate,\n\nBut to Thee still a tale of pain\n\nI can no longer help narrate.\n\nThough we may seem like voiceless\n\nlyres,\n\nWithin, imprisoned anguish cries;\n\nIts urge compels, and I obey,\n\nFraming these plaintive melodies.\n\nHear Thou, O God! these sad complaints\n\nFrom those of proven fealty;\n\nBeneath proud spires in Western lands,\n\nAnd made that magic melody\n\nThrill over Afric’s burning sands.\n\nThe pageantries of mighty kings\n\nTo us were shows that mattered not,\n\nBeneath the shade of blades unsheathed\n\nIn Kalima we glory sought.\n\nOur only life was then to face\n\nThe perils 0f Thy holy wars;\n\nTo glorify Thy name we died,\n\nAdorned with hallowed battle scars.\n\nNot lust for power for our own sakes\n\nOur drawn‐sword’s playfulness\n\ninspired,\n\nNor roamed we hand‐in‐glove with\n\nDeath\n\nFor worldly riches we desired.\n\nOur people, had they set their hearts\n\nOn this world’s riches or its gold,\n\nNot idol‐breaking would have gone\n\nBut idols would have bought and sold.\n\nWe stood our ground like rocks when once\n\nThe foe had met our phalanx dread;\n\nBefore our might the bravest quailed\n\nAnd, vanquished, from the battle fled.\n\nAnd those who offered Thee affront\n\nOur swift, relentless fury faced,\n\nTheir mightiest arms we set at nought,\n\nTheir insolence and pride abased.\n\nOn all men’s minds we set Thy seal,\n\nThy tawhid’s firm and sure impress—\n\nThe selfsame message preached our lips\n\nWhen swords danced high in battle’s\n\nstress.\n\nDeclare Thou whose fierce valour once\n\nDid Khyber’s barriers overthrow?\n\nOr whose resistless might once laid\n\nFamed Caesar’s proudest cities low?\n\nWho smashed to dust man’s hand‐\n\nwrought gods,\n\nThose things of straw and earth and\n\nclay?\n\nAnd who did unbelieving hosts\n\nTo spread Thy name and glory slay?\n\nAnd who was it that quenched and cooled\n\nThe fiery urns of fair Iran ?\n\nThy holy Kaʹba’s hallowed shrine,\n\nWhose bosoms reverently held\n\nThy great and glorious Book Divine—\n\nIf our meed still the obloquy\n\nThat we have shirked the Faithful’s part,\n\nHow then canst Thou make claim to be\n\nThe kindly faith‐compelling heart?\n\nFor there are those of other faiths\n\nAmong whom many sinners ,\n\nSome humble, others puffed with pride,\n\nDrunken in their effrontery;\n\nIf some have vision, thousands are\n\nOf little worth, neglectful, worse;\n\nAnd millions upon millions live\n\nFrom Thy dear, glorious name averse.\n\nYet see how still Thy bounties rain\n\nOn roofs 0f unbelieving clans,\n\nWhile strikes Thy thunder‐bolt the homes\n\nOf all‐forbearing Mussalmans!\n\nIn idol‐houses, hark!

As per the legend Jahangir revolted against his father Akbar over his love for a common girl called Anarkali.\n\nIt was the top grossing Hindi film in the year of its release, and one of the biggest Hindi film hits in its decade.[1] Another film on the same theme was Mughal-e-Azam, made in 1960, which was again a major commercial[2] and critical hit.\n\nPlot[edit]\n\nShahenshah Jalaudin Akbar is the grandson of Babur, and the son of Humayun. He is known to have ruled over Hindustan with a humane and just heart. He knew in order to garner the support of the Hindus, he must treat them sensitively, allow them to worship freely, and in order to maintain this peace, he married Jodabai, a Hindu Rajput, the sister of Raja Man Singh. Through this marriage they became the proud parents of Shehzada Salim. Akbar first met Nadira in the Anar garden, while she was awaiting the arrival of her lover. So pleased he was with her that he wanted to reward her, but she only asked for an Anar, so he ended up bestowing her with the name of 'Anarkali'. He met her the second time when she was able to revive Salim, who was seriously wounded in a war in Kabul. Once again Akbar was pleased with her, wanted to reward her, but again she turned him down. The third time she ended up annoying Akbar when she sang and danced in his court under the influence of alcohol, and he has her imprisoned. The very foundations of Akbar's palace will be shaken to the roots, and his manner of meting out justice will be put to the extreme test, when he finds out that Salim is in love with Anarkali and wants to marry her. While Akbar may have been successful to end the strife between Hindus and Muslims, but will be able to break down the wall between the rich and the poor?\n\nCast[edit]\n\nBina Rai ...

As per the legend Jahangir revolted against his father Akbar over his love for a common girl called Anarkali.\n\nIt was the top grossing Hindi film in the year of its release, and one of the biggest Hindi film hits in its decade.[1] Another film on the same theme was Mughal-e-Azam, made in 1960, which was again a major commercial[2] and critical hit.\n\nShahenshah Jalaudin Akbar is the grandson of Babur, and the son of Humayun. He is known to have ruled over Hindustan with a humane and just heart. He knew in order to garner the support of the Hindus, he must treat them sensitively, allow them to worship freely, and in order to maintain this peace, he married Jodabai, a Hindu Rajput, the sister of Raja Man Singh. Through this marriage they became the proud parents of Shehzada Salim. Akbar first met Nadira in the Anar garden, while she was awaiting the arrival of her lover. So pleased he was with her that he wanted to reward her, but she only asked for an Anar, so he ended up bestowing her with the name of 'Anarkali'. He met her the second time when she was able to revive Salim, who was seriously wounded in a war in Kabul. Once again Akbar was pleased with her, wanted to reward her, but again she turned him down. The third time she ended up annoying Akbar when she sang and danced in his court under the influence of alcohol, and he has her imprisoned. The very foundations of Akbar's palace will be shaken to the roots, and his manner of meting out justice will be put to the extreme test, when he finds out that Salim is in love with Anarkali and wants to marry her. While Akbar may have been successful to end the strife between Hindus and Muslims, but will be able to break down the wall between the rich and the poor?\n\nCast[edit]\n\nBina Rai ...
