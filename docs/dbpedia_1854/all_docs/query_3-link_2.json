        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nIn general, the coexistence of multiple diseases in an individual is referred to as multimorbidity. When a primary disease, such as diabetes, is identified, the additional diseases present are known as comorbidities of the primary disease [1]. The study of comorbidity and multimorbidity has seen significant growth over the past four decades. A comprehensive analysis of global research on comorbidity and multimorbidity revealed that between 1970 and 2016, a total of 85,994 papers were published from 168 countries [2]. One contributing factor to the increasing importance of research in this area is the aging population. As people age, the likelihood of experiencing multiple diseases rises. This trend is observed worldwide, as all regions of the world are facing the challenges of an aging population. By 2050, it is projected that one in every six individuals globally will be aged 65 or older, compared to one in every eleven in 2019 [3]. A large-scale, multi-country study confirmed the high prevalence of multimorbidity among adults aged 50 and above in low-, middle-, and high-income countries [4].\n\nBesides examining levels, trends, and determinants, research on comorbidity and multimorbidity aims to uncover patterns and explore the etiological relationships between diseases. The aforementioned multi-country study identified and distinguished three types of multimorbidity patterns in the nine countries under investigation: “cardio-respiratory” (angina, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), “metabolic” (diabetes, obesity, and hypertension), and “mental-articular” (arthritis and depression) [4]. A large-scale cohort study conducted in the UK found that older patients, women, and socioeconomically deprived groups had a higher number of comorbidities. Additionally, the patterns of comorbidity varied according to age and sex [5]. Expanding on the work of Valderas et al. [1] proposed four etiological models of comorbid diseases: direct causation (where one comorbid disease causes the other), associated risk factors (when the risk factors of the comorbid diseases are correlated), heterogeneity (when the risk factors for the comorbid diseases are uncorrelated, but the risk factor for one comorbid disease is also a risk factor for the other), and lastly, independence (when the presence of diagnostic features of comorbid diseases is due to another comorbid disease).\n\nThe three primary sources of data for research on comorbidity and multimorbidity are electronic health records, surveys (either of patients or the general population), and administrative records [6]. Each source has its advantages, disadvantages, and specific tools and methods. The study by Garin et al. [4] serves as an example of research based on survey data, while the study by Tran et al. [5] exemplifies research based on electronic health records. Tonelli et al. [7] have described the methods for identifying 30 comorbidities from administrative data#. Administrative data and electronic health records often involve large datasets reaching millions of records. These datasets are increasingly being analysed using big data methods and machine learning [8,9].\n\nIn machine learning, it is stated that “a computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks T, as measured by P, improves with experience E” [10]. Some common machine learning tasks include classification, classification with missing inputs, regression, transcription, machine translation, structured outputs, anomaly detection, imputation of missing values, denoising, and density estimation. Regarding “experience E”, numerous algorithms are broadly grouped under unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms [11].\n\nThe Saudi population is at a high risk of various morbidities. Children, adults, and older adults of any gender are susceptible to these uncontrolled morbidities [12,13,14]. In the study by Alhabib et al. [15], which involved 2047 participants, approximately 30.3% had hypertension, 25.1% had diabetes, 49.6% were obese, and 32.1% had dyslipidaemia. These factors pose a high risk for cardiovascular disease, which can be controlled (modifiable) in the early years. From a public health perspective, one way to mitigate the risk of comorbidities is to address common modifiable behavioural risk factors [16].\n\nAdvancements in this century, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, have attracted numerous researchers in the field of public health. Poudel et al. utilised machine learning methods to predict cognitive health in adults by considering various lifestyle and sociodemographic factors, along with the neighbourhood environment [17]. Their research proposed a machine learning-based regression approach, employing techniques such as gradient boosting machines, support vector machines, neural networks, and linear models.\n\nJang et al. [18] presented a deep learning-based decision support system for establishing and implementing public health and social measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. They proposed using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for this purpose. Chadaga et al. [19] also utilised deep learning methods for diagnosing COVID-19 patients and proposed a decision support system incorporating explainable artificial intelligence techniques. Explainable artificial intelligence has also been employed to detect polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [20]. Additionally, deep learning methods have been used for tuberculosis detection and classification from chest X-rays [21].\n\nHaneef et al. [22] proposed a machine learning-based approach to estimate diabetes incidence in France using supervised machine learning techniques. They employed linear discriminant analysis (LDA), flexible discriminant analysis (FDA), and decision trees to estimate the occurrence of diabetes. In a nationwide study of the Danish population, diabetes prediction was performed using logistic ridge regression, classification was carried out using random forest, and a decision tree was validated using gradient boosting methods [8].\n\nLopes et al. [23] introduced an unsupervised machine learning approach for classifying the risk of preterm birth in Brazil, utilising municipality socio-economic data and the rate of preterm births. The data were clustered using three algorithms: K-means, principal component analysis, and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN).\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the studies highlight the application of advanced regression and machine learning models on extensive nationwide data. Logistic regression models utilise raw probabilities to predict outcomes, while neural network models employ numeric outputs with multiple layers and work with training, testing, and validation data. However, there is a gap in the literature regarding the prediction of multimorbidity using these models. Nevertheless, these models can assist in identifying and predicting risk factors for multimorbidity, a prevalent public health issue worldwide.\n\nThere is a lack of literature on predicting a risk assessment model for multimorbidities among the Saudi population. The Sharik Association for Health Research has developed the Sharik Health Indicators Surveillance System (SHISS), a nationwide, multi-wave, survey-based population health surveillance program initiated in early 2020 and conducted quarterly [24]. In this research, we utilised the dataset collected at different times in 2020 to estimate the health and risk factors in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, this study uses statistical and machine learning models to predict multimorbidity in the Saudi population.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Descriptive Statistics\n\nThe data include the participation of 23,098 individuals. compares the presence of multimorbidity across different independent variables. The results show that respondents with multimorbidity were older in age compared to respondents without any multimorbidity. About three quarters of males (76.2%) and a similar proportion among females (77.2%) were free of comorbidities. The difference between males and females was not significant. For all the health behavioural risk factors included, there was significant difference between the multimorbid and the non-multimorbid. This includes vegetable consumption per week, fruit consumption per week, intense physical activity per week, moderate physical activity per week, and smoker of any type.\n\nTable 1\n\nPresence of Multimorbidityp-ValueNoYesAge (years)33.8 (12.2)47.1 (14.2) <0.0001 GenderMale8717 (76.2%)2716 (23.8%)0.096Female9002 (77.2%)2663 (22.8%)Vegetable consumption per week (#)3.4 (2.1)3.6 (2.1) <0.0001 Fruit consumption per week (#)2.7 (2.1)3.1 (2.2) <0.0001 Intense physical activity per week (#days)1.8 (2.2)1.4 (2.0) <0.0001 Moderate physical activity per week (# days)2.3 (2.4)2.1 (2.3) <0.0001 Smoker of any typeNo12,966 (78.0%)3653 (22.0%) <0.001 Yes4753 (73.4%)1726 (26.6%)\n\n3.2. Logistic Regression Model\n\nshows the odds ratio with the 95% confidence interval from the univariable (unadjusted) and multivariable (adjusted) logistic regression model for the predictors of multimorbidity. For the univariable model, the highest odds ratios were for smokers (1.29). After adjusting for the other variables in the model, smokers continued to have the highest odds ratios followed by the female sex. In the unadjusted model, the odds ratio for females was close to 1 (0.95), but this increased to 1.32 in the adjusted model.\n\nTable 2\n\nUOR (95% CI)AOR (95% CI)Age (years)1.07 (1.07–1.08)1.08 (1.07–1.08)Females0.95 (0.89–1.01)1.32 (1.23–1.43)Vegetable consumption per week (#)1.06 (1.05–1.08)0.99 (0.97–1.01)Fruit consumption per week (#)1.09 (1.08–1.11)1.05 (1.03–1.06)Intense physical activity per week (#days)0.92 (0.91–0.94)0.97 (0.96–0.99)Moderate physical activity per week (#days)0.95 (0.94–0.97)0.98 (0.96–0.99)Smoker1.29 (1.21–1.38)1.74 (1.61–1.89)\n\nThe model accuracy was checked via the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, as shown in . The area under the curve was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.765–0.779). This indicates that the model is fitted relatively well to the data.\n\n3.3. Backpropagation Neural Network\n\nUsing the same sets of variables as used in the logistic regression model, a three-layer BPNN was designed in Matlab to classify the collected data into two categories, i.e., comorbid and non-comorbid patients. For training, 70% of the total data were used, while 15% of the data were used for validation, and 15% were used for testing, respectively. Accuracy and other parameters such as sensitivity and specificity were calculated for training, validation, and testing by varying the number of neurons in the hidden layer. shows the accuracy values for training, validation, and testing, respectively.\n\nTable 3\n\nInput NeuronsHidden Layer NeuronsOutput NeuronsTraining Accuracy (%)Cross EntropyEpochValidation Accuracy\n\n(%)Testing Accuracy\n\n(%)Overall Accuracy\n\n(%)810279.10.231984878.479.679.1820279.10.235915277.780.679.1830278.80.223986078.680.779.18402790.227254479.67979.1850279.20.226526778.679.379.1860278.70.227043279.579.578.9870279.30.230094678.68079.3880279.30.231286279.278.879.2890279.50.225096879.37879.28100279.50.23008747978.279.2\n\nfurther mentioned sensitivity, specificity, precision, the f-score, and AUC at different neurons.\n\nTable 4\n\nNo.No. of NeuronsSensitivity (Recall)SpecificityPrecisionF-ScoreAUCTrainingValidationTestingOverallTrainingValidationTestingOverallTrainingValidationTestingOverallTrainingValidationTestingOverallTrainingValidationTestingOverall1109493.993.59430.32631.929.981.58182.381.587.387.087.587.362.260.062.762.022094.19494.794.230.126.729.829.581.5808381.587.386.488.587.462.160.462.361.93309493.19493.929.729.633.430.281.281.683.381.687.187.088.387.361.961.463.762.144094.99594.994.926.429.327.3278181.48181.187.487.787.487.560.762.261.161.055094.994.694.594.827.726.326.627.381.180.881.781.187.587.287.687.461.360.560.661.166094.695.695.394.926.427.924.526.480.880.981.480.987.287.687.887.360.561.859.960.777094.994.795.194.928.424.129.527.981.280.881.881.387.587.288.087.661.759.462.361.488094.194.493.894.13128.229.430.381.781.581.581.687.587.587.287.462.661.361.662.299094.694.294.194.529.330.529.528.981.681.680.481.487.687.486.787.562.062.461.861.7101009594.694.894.927.827.327.327.781.581.18081.287.787.386.887.561.461.061.161.3\n\nThe overall accuracy is the average of three accuracies (training, validation, and testing). However, to examine the performance of a trained neural network, testing accuracy is of prime importance in contrast to other accuracies. It can be seen from the table above that the maximum testing accuracy of 80.7% was obtained for 30 neurons in the hidden layer. However, in contrast, the best value of training accuracy was 79.5%, while the best value for validation accuracy was 79.6%. Cross-entropy was used as a loss function. Note that the lowest cross-entropy of 0.22398 was achieved with 30 hidden layer neurons in the BPNN, with the highest testing accuracy of 80.7 % at 60 epoch. This is shown in the below with the help of a dotted line.\n\nSimilarly, shows the training state curve of BPNN with 30 hidden neurons. The gradient of the training algorithm achieved its optimal (minimum) value of 0.0051097 at epoch 66, where further training of the network was stopped to freeze the weights of the neural network.\n\nshows the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for training, validation, testing, and overall. The ROC curve is a characteristic plot between the true positive rate (TPR), also called sensitivity, to the false positive rate, also known as specificity. It is clear from the graphs for all the cases that the curves lie in the upper half of the plane. Therefore, the top left corner of the graph indicates a better classification capability of the classifier. The blue curve shows the ROC for multimorbidity, whereas the green one is for no- multimorbidity. It can be obviously seen in the testing ROC that the curves for the true positive rate and false positive rate lie far from the straight line toward the top left corner, therefore, showing better classification for the testing data.\n\nMoreover, it is also clear from the confusion matrices, shown in , that the sensitivity or TPR for testing data is 61.3%, for multimorbidity 83.3%, and for no-multimorbidity 80.7% for the testing data. The AUC values of training, validation, testing, and overall were 61.8%, 61.4%, 63.7%, and 62.1%, respectively.\n\nshows a plot of testing accuracy versus the number of hidden layer neurons. It can be observed that increasing the neuron number in the hidden layer results in increasing the accuracy. However, once the number of neurons reached 30, it reached its maximum value. After that, it drops down and increasing the number of neurons does not increase the accuracy further. The graph shows a general decreasing trend in accuracy with an increase in the number of neurons.\n\nSimilarly, shows the number of epochs versus the testing accuracy. Maximum testing accuracy of the trained network is observed at 60 epochs.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nWith the rapid increase in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes and hypertension, most Saudi health literature has focused on the comorbidities of these NCDs (as well as communicable diseases such as COVID-19) rather than multimorbidity in general [28,29,30]. One of the few exceptions is the study by Algabbanih et al. [31], which analysed multimorbidity in Saudi Arabia using Sharik data. Their study utilized pooled data from two national health surveys conducted in March 2018 and July 2018, based on the reported health status. Algabbanih et al. [31] included the following variables in assessing the risk factors for multimorbidity: age, gender, level of education, reported health status, smoking status, employment, marital status, and income. With the exception of education, at least one category was found to be significant for all these variables. The significant predictor categories for multimorbidity were: age over 45 years, being female, reported health status of ‘good’ or less, being retired or unable to work, being widowed, and a monthly income between SAR 10,000 to SAR 15,000. In our study, only three of these variables were included: age, gender, and smoking status. Additionally, we included ‘healthy behaviour variables’, namely, weekly vegetable consumption, weekly fruit consumption, intense physical activity per week, and moderate physical activity per week.\n\nAkter et al. [32] conducted a meta-analysis of machine learning approaches to assess the increased risk of COVID-19. Their study also identified age and gender as the most significant predictors. Similar to Algabbanih et al. [31], female gender and smoking status were found to be significant predictors of multimorbidity. In our study, we did not categorize age as was performed by Algabbanih et al. [31]. The average age of individuals with multimorbidity in our study was 47.1 years. Since this age range does not fall under the category of ‘older adult’, the age variable was not a significant predictor of multimorbidity. It is worth noting the caution raised by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) in their study of multimorbidity in Australia:\n\n“It is important to note that while some characteristics, such as age, sex, or smoking status, may be more common in people with multimorbidity, it is not possible to say that multimorbidity is caused by these characteristics with the current data. Similarly, it is not possible to say that the characteristics examined are the result of having multimorbidity. For example, while being overweight or obese may be a risk factor for multimorbidity, it could also result from a person being limited in the physical activity they can participate in due to their multimorbidity.”\n\nAlthough there was a significant difference between the multimorbid and non-multimorbid groups in terms of ‘healthy behaviour variables,’ they were not significant predictors of multimorbidity in the adjusted model, as all their odds ratios were close to 1.\n\nThe unadjusted logistic regression model helped us determine the effect of individual variables on multimorbidity. The unadjusted estimate can be implemented in further research if the researcher has different sets of variables. For instance, only three covariates were shared between our study and the study by Algabbanih et al. [31]. Hence, the results are comparable based on unadjusted estimates. However, the adjusted analysis helped us determine the best and most effective predictors for the outcome variable, i.e., multimorbidity. As discussed earlier, smoking was the most influential predictor for multimorbidity.\n\nThe overall accuracy of the logistic regression model was 77%. The machine learning model used in the paper slightly improved this accuracy to 80.7%. Further research can explore other machine learning methods for predicting multimorbidity.\n\nIn this paper, BPNN was used as a tool to classify patients as morbid or non-morbid. The results indicate that machine learning approaches can be used to classify patients into different groups associated with various data attributes. Furthermore, while the case study presented in this paper focused on a binary classification problem, machine learning approaches can also be applied to solve multiclass problems. Various algorithms, including supervised and unsupervised learning methods, can be used in future research. The potential use of machine learning in the field of public health can lead to the development of decision support systems that assist health experts in making decisions related to different public health issues and policies. In the case of high-dimensional data, dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA or ranking methods based on statistical approaches like ANOVA, combined with other machine learning algorithms, can be utilised for such decision support systems.\n\nThis study is the first to predict factors associated with multimorbidity using nationwide data and applying machine learning methods. One limitation of this study is the limited number of variables included, which makes it difficult to compare the results with the study by Algabbanih et al. [31]. It is hoped that this study will stimulate further Saudi research on the vital topic of multimorbidity."
