The learners’ creations addressed the evolving nature of commercial workspaces and the need for seating solutions outside of a conventional workstation.\n\nThis year’s design brief was created in collaboration with Nienkamper, the exclusive partner for the 2024 Chair Show. It was judged by a panel of noteworthy local design professionals from companies including Nienkamper, Borgo, Copernicus and more.\n\nEach year, hundreds of people attend the show including design professionals, industry insiders, students, family and friends.\n\nComing in first place was the team of Jhay Simon, Shariq Mohamed and Zach Hatanaka with JRMY. Finishing in second was Erika Zhu Zhong, Marcus Mayne and Ben Krautner for PICARD while Xander Adams, Derek Lin and Arik Stuffles finished in third for AVONA. Winning the People’s Choice award was Thea Shekaran, Pakhi Kandwal and Alycia Gutierrez Arana for OBA."
