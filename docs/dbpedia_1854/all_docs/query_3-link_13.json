        "meta_description": "Disney animated feature film is a big global entertainment arena. This paper analyzes multiple animated Disney classic movies based on the subject of women’s representation. These films are interesting to study because the targeted audience is children, and the stereotypical patterns that these Disney classic films portray may play an important role in their lives. It was found that the character development in the Disney animation films, focuses on giving the primary or the central character more pervasive roles, especially in cases where they are considered the female gender. However, they are gender role concerns in the Disney films that should be analyzed. One of the major results of this research was that Disney fails in the case of the representation matrix, especially when 8 of the most successful and popular films are analyzed. In the eight films studied, it was found that 63.3% of the characters were in the form of males while 36.6% were females. The analysis of films in Disney in the study has been done by focusing on the physical trade, the personality, behavior, and the occupation of the gender implicated in specific character development. The overall conclusion from this study provides that older Disney films contain more stereotypical traits, while new films are trying to break the stereotypes against female characters. However, the films still portray the female constant need for support and assistance.",
