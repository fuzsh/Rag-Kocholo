        "meta_description": "The multimedia exhibition HUM SAB EK (We Are One) launched this past week at CGIS South (read an interview with project leader Dr. Satchit Balsari here). Ahead of the April 15 Opening Reception, we spoke with some of the students who volunteered their time to make this exhibition a reality. Few had prior experience bringing an exhibit to life, yet they all pitched in to make it a reality. They hail from departments and schools across Harvard, with a variety of academic backgrounds and interests. Together they created something powerful, and look forward to bringing their immersive show to sites around the U.S. in in South Asia.",

        "text": "To kickstart the project, we undertook the task of transcribing and translating 30 hours of SEWA members’ testimonies from Gujarati to English. Simultaneously, I delved into Dr. Balsari’s field notes from 2022 to grasp SEWA members’ experiences and develop a preliminary catalog for our envisioned traveling exhibition using digital collage as a medium. Towards the end of this phase, I visited SEWA in Ahmedabad, conducting interviews with the members to present our exhibition proposal and refine it based on their feedback. We engaged with various subject matter experts, multilateral organizations, museums, and think tanks to introduce our project proposal and establish partnerships for this unique art-science collaboration. And by the end of January 2024, we had formed a strong interdisciplinary team consisting of engineers, researchers, filmmakers, and designers.\n\nThe several iterations of the proposed exhibition design catalog served as a broad framework for the individual installations that were detailed by our team members. For example, I had rendered an initial vision for our ‘You Are On Mute’ installation, showcasing SEWA’s massive digital literacy drive. This was depicted through 100 smartphones arranged asymmetrically, each lighting up sequentially to symbolize the multitude of Zoom calls the members engaged in—despite lacking any expertise in programming video loops or video editing. Soon, Bobby began experimenting by splitting a video across two phones, eventually escalating to over 70 devices to realize our vision. Deepak collaborated with him to sift through a myriad Zoom recordings to create a three-minute video montage showcased on the phones. Meanwhile, William constructed the framework that supports the installation, completing the task over a single weekend.\n\nAs the team worked on their individual installations asynchronously, I also took on the responsibility of coordinating with the venue’s building services team and the fabricators to ensure a significant part of the installation was completed over the spring break. This experience opened up a new realm of learning for me about spatial codes within the university, which differed significantly from my previous work as an exhibition designer in India.\n\nMittal Institute: Why did you decide to get involved in the first place?\n\nHiteshree Das: I enrolled in the GSD’s Masters of Design Studies program with the goal of expanding my skillset beyond traditional industrial and exhibition design. I was eager to explore an overlap between design and deep social science research and believed that the liberal arts environment at Harvard would support this pursuit, although I wasn’t sure how at the time. One day, before the class of the course GENED 1011: Entrepreneurial Solutions for Intractable Problems, co-taught by Dr. Balsari, I struck up a conversation with him about a recent trip to India, where he had interviewed informal working women. He was contemplating the idea of creating an archive and I was intrigued by the fact that a physician was exploring this concept and felt that it was something I could contribute to, especially considering my previous experience working with India’s first virtual museum through Google Arts and Culture. Now, a year later, we have developed a comprehensive exhibition that aims to start conversations about ways to include communities in policy decisions that impact their lives and livelihoods.\n\nMittal Institute: What did it mean to you to be involved in this project? What are you most proud of?\n\nHiteshree Das: Being part of this project has allowed me to evolve and reshape my design practice using systems thinking and participatory research approaches, while gaining a deeper understanding of the responsibilities associated with being a designer and researcher. I now view design as a process of negotiation–one that involves the democratic collection and creation of knowledge, and facilitates its sharing for collective objectives while carefully weighing trade-offs influenced by socio-political, economic, and geographic factors.\n\nI believe that through this journey of learning about SEWA and contributing to this exhibition, we absorbed SEWA’s values into our curatorial and design approach, albeit at a subtle level. Despite our initial lack of clarity, there was a strong foundation of trust demonstrated by the team which provided a lot of freedom to make mistakes and learn iteratively. I am proud of the fact that despite limited resources, technical challenges, and time constraints, we did not compromise on the shared vision of the project.\n\nDeepak Ramola: I’ve always been a firm believer in the wisdom and resilience of everyday people, and the women of SEWA epitomize this belief. Their stories reflect their grounded lives and aspirational dreams, showcasing the intersection of possibility and determination through resilience, hard work, and hope. Joining this project from its inception provided me with the chance to sit with some of India’s most inspiring women and hear their stories firsthand. Who could pass up such a remarkable opportunity for a masterclass in empowerment?\n\nMittal Institute: What did it mean to you to be involved in this project? What are you most proud of?\n\nDeepak Ramola: Words like “innovation,” “path-breaking,” and “revolutionary” are rarely associated with marginalized communities and the impoverished. Yet, delving into the world of SEWA and witnessing the vibrant legacy of its members, these are the only descriptors that seem fitting. Throughout the project, I navigated between two contrasting worlds: from the bustling streets of India to the quiet lanes of Cambridge. The unspoken dialogue between these worlds, characterized by mutual respect, enabled us to design with sensitivity and care. I take the greatest pride in the collaborative effort of every team member, coming together to envision, design, and deliver this truly unique exhibition experience.\n\nMittal Institute: Why did you decide to get involved in the first place?\n\nKarthik Girish: My entry into the project was unexpected. Initially, I was onboarded to design exhibit description panels and resize images. Having no experience working on a project of this scale, I was thrilled to work and learn more. But before I got my initial tasks, Dr. Balsari asked me to make one data graphic. And then another. Then six more after that, I ended up designing the two big-wall graphics for ‘Every Body Counts’ and ‘Super Spreaders’. My love for designing data was fulfilled with every graphic that was created. I enjoyed the iterative design process for such an important and impactful message. This was a surreal experience, and I am highly indebted to Dr. Balsari and Hiteshree for giving me this wonderful opportunity..\n\nMittal Institute: What did it mean to you to be involved in this project? What are you most proud of?\n\nKarthik Girish: The project was an eye-opener to me. I am happy I used my design tools to spread the effort and voices of poor working women and the SEWA organization. The intention to convey the recorded conversations and stories impactfully drove me and my design process. I am also extremely grateful to have worked with a multi-talented team."
