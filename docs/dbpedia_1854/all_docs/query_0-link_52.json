        "text": "Oh I see what you are saying. There is a LOT more known numbers than I thought. I thought the 2 you mention, were the only one known that came even close to mine. Any chance I can see a picture of the maybe the 10 on each side of my number? 20406? The reason I ask, is that I have reached out to the Historic Danish Home Guard division. I know its a long shot, but if there are several missing numbers in the Danish records, that matches up with your list, that means all of those were most likely shipped to the exact same place. Where that is, thats the question\n\nI also had another thought when I saw your list. I read somewhere that it was said that the Winchesters had a bad reputation back than, and that it was said: \"No Winchester should be shipped state side\". If that actually was the case, than these may have been shipped to a storage department and were meant to be used as reserve rifles. I have no idea where that would be in this case I figured that would explain the gaps as well. That it was never actually shipped to any camps or anything like that but kept in storage until they needed to use them - which would be 1941 in this case.\n\nThats absolutely awesome. This is where my nerdiness shines through a LOT. I spent 10+ years nerding about details and trying to figure out patterns in incomplete lists. So I love this part a LOT.\n\nRight away, I noticed 1 detail. Not 1 Remington or Eddystone was shipped to Camp Humphreys.\n\nRemingtons were mainly shipped to: US NW Penitentiary Lewisburg + 353 RD Inf Camp Funston + Camp Jackson to Midvale. Eddystone went a bit all over the place Eddystone was shipped to: Camp Gordon + 342 Camp Grant + 324th Camp Sevier + 328th inf + 165th Depot Brig Camp Travis + Camp Jackson to Midvale and finally a LOT to 349th inf.\n\nFor Winchesters thats totally different. From 291-56055 Winchesters were almost exclusively going to Camp Humphreys. The only exceptions are a few going to 317 Infantry Camp Lee + some either being repaired or going to a testing facility (several different places - all with early sn). I also noticed that when it was going to a testing facility, it always mentioned exactly where it was going and why. Because you wouldnt sent 1000 rifles to testing, I excluded those in the statistics. You would send maybe 5-10 to testing. Thats it.\n\nSo I had a closer look at the rifles Winchesters going to 317 Infantry Camp Lee. It looks like those were maybe recalls, as several of those have 2 shipping dates. So I googled Camp Lee.It opened August 1917 so it would make perfect sense that all the early rifles went to Camp Lee. At least I thought so. But thats when I noticed something else. It only existed for a very short time in 1917-1918. It was already demobilized/closed in June 1918. That ofcause is, unless I misunderstand the meaning of demobilized In any case, the last Winchester was shipped to Camp Lee in February and its one of those with dual shipping dates so that fits with that date as well.\n\nCamp Lee info found here:\n\nhttps://history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/regt/0317rgt.htm\n\nSo I looked at Camp Humphreys. That camp opened November 1918. Whats also interesting is that Camp Humphreys opened up with 50.000 soldiers + 4900 officers. Thats a huge camp. That shows in the list as well. They needed a LOT of rifles. Without counting the exact number, it looks like 90-95% of all the Winchesters are going to Camp Humphreys. The rest to Camp Lee. Again, no Remintongs or Eddystones are going to Camp Humphreys what so ever.\n\nBecause of that, I think its a safe bet to say that my rifle was sent to Camp Humphreys. If it was going to a testing facility, it would have been found on the list and what they were testing. If it had been a broken rifle somehow, it would have had dual shipping dates as well. The only other option is Camp Lee, but that was not a big camp from what I can figure out. At least nothing near the size of Camp Humphreys.\n\nYou should be able to see the same pattern on the next pages after these first 2. My guess is that you can see that whole pattern of Winchesters only going to Camp Humphreys until October 1918. After that, it will be sporadic where they go. From this link that number would be around 1076000 on the sn. Am I right in that assumption?\n\nSn search:\n\nhttps://oldguns.net/sn_php/mildateslookup.php\n\nAll in all, I think its a fair bet that my rifle was sent to Camp Humphreys on Oct 4th 1918 where it was used to train troops until it was shipped Canada in 1941. I think the odds are 95% chance of Camp Humphreys and 5% chance for Camp Lee. Its gonna be one of those 2 I think.\n\nNext step is to get a reply from the Danish Home Guard for a final confirmation to see if the gaps match up as well.\n\nFinally, a little funny sidenote. I have a sore shoulder today. Yesterday I took this rifle to the range for the first time. Talk about a BIG upgrade from the .22 I have been shooting so far. Yes you can laugh now I am still smiling ear to ear after yesterday\n\nJust in case I forgot before. Thank you so much for your help. This is AWESOME. I am so grateful for all of this."
