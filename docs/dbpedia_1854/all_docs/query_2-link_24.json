I feel the only good way forward is with compassion, kindness and taking personal accountability for positive action. Make your actions matter: Show up‚Ä¶ lean in‚Ä¶ do your absolute best‚Ä¶. And be kind. #action #impactthatmatterd #kindness #compassion #\n\nGreetings my LinkedIn family & friends. I am thrilled to invite you to join me for the next episode of Deloitte's Live Webcast TechTonic conversations, where I will host Jody Clayton, Group Vice President, Advanced Technology (SaaS, Analytics, AI & Emerging Tech) at Oracle. We will hear Jody's story and the story of Oracle, its history, current landscape, ambitions and strategy. We will also reflect on CIO's perspectives, and lessons we have learned about successful technology transformations. This will be an important conversation for anyone involved in planning or delivering large, tech-enabled business transformations. The session will be LIVE, so please plan to join the conversation by registering here: https://lnkd.in/gen_7vG3 #CIO #CTO #ERP #Oracle #Deloitte #Impactthatmatters Cheryl Manuel, Joe Arumainayagam, Sandra Di Liddo, Dejan Slokar\n\nOur lives are accumulations of our daily decisions and choices. Some are obviously big, others are small. Some deceptively small‚ÄºÔ∏è, but can completely change your life‚Äôs trajectory. Many are easy, some very hard. Choose wisely‚Ä¶. And own them!\n\nEssential skills for the 21st century: 1. (Genuine) Curiosity 2. Adaptability to change (resilience) 3. Focus (dealing with distractions) 4. Self Discipline (time mastery) Secret to success: 1. Show up 2. Lean in 3. Do your best 4. Be kind And‚Ä¶. Always have a goal, always stay true to your purpose and values. It‚Äôs actually quite simple‚Ä¶. Not easy, but simple üòâ. Then, apply this to everything you do."
