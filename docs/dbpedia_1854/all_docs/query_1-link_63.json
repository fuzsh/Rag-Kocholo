        "text": "This past month was filled with chapters closing and new ones opening. I graduated Magna Cum Laude from The George Washington University with a B.A. in International Affairs and two minors in Public Health and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. I received an award from the WGSS department and I was honored to speak as a community leader for the South Asian community at the Multicultural Student Services Center’s ceremony. I’m so grateful for the internships and mentors such as Fatima Salman, Harris Samad, Jae Yang and Shamila Chaudhary that gave me skills and opportunities. I’m even more grateful for the grace & compassion I was given during difficult times. I finished my last week at the Wilson Center Maternal Health Initiative. The team of Sarah Barnes, MPH , Deekshita Ramanarayanan, MPH , Chanel Lee, MSPH , Claire Hubley was powerful and inspiring. Up next, I have the blessing of attending the #1 public health school in the world, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. As a queer child of immigrants, I didn’t anticipate getting this far, let alone getting accepted into every grad school I applied to. However, higher education is still so inaccessible to marginalized communities and further exacerbates inequity with student loans & debt. As a student that had to juggle multiple jobs and still is in debt, I urge higher education leaders to make their prestigious programs financially accessible. Alhamdullilah for all of the support I received over the last four years and for all of those that shaped me into who I am today! I hope to bring healing into communities and revitalize public health :) #graduation2022 #publichealth #lgbtq #gwu #johnshopkins\n\nThrilled to announce that my creative work, Boy in the Mirror has been published in Sprinkle: an Undergraduate Journal of Feminist & Queer Studies. Special thank you to Jameta Nicole Barlow for inspiring me and nudging me to submit my work. The WGSS department at GW has always reminded me of the power of writing about my vulnerability, resilience, and joy that comes with my Queer Muslim identity. I feel empowered and heard as I tell my story. I hope the piece resonates with even a few- and can perhaps encourage others to share their story! Abstract: Expressing my queer resistance grew out of its imaginative roots to bloom into my liberation journey. Growing up, I never imagined I would write about the identity that I internalized as a dark secret. Concealment and self-preservation of the body is often a tool Queer folks must utilize as they navigate unfamiliar spaces. Queer Muslims face intersectional struggles in Islamophobia and queerphobia, along with other forms of oppression. In this piece, I narrate having to mute my queerness, and it is a tool I still have to use today to protect my sacred Queer body. Although there is distress on our queer bodies, we must acknowledge our joy, because that in itself is radical. Much of my childhood and teen years was spent in shameful seclusion as I became isolated, yet as I heal, I find strength in my individuality. At the same time, I have found community amongst those that share love with me, Queer Muslims, and my beloved partner who has shown me the power of our spiritually rooted love. The collection of these photos and this narrative aims to capture the complex nuance of my queer lived experience and a collective queer imagination. The Boy in the Mirror’s queer imagination may be an escape for many of us, but it can also be the gateway to our untethered, decolonized existence in a world of binaries.
