        "text": "Background Multimorbidity is a worldwide concern related to greater disability, worse quality of life, and mortality. The early prediction is crucial for preventive strategies design and integrative medical practice. However, knowledge about how to predict multimorbidity is limited, possibly due to the complexity involved in predicting multiple chronic diseases. Methods In this study, we present the use of a machine learning approach to build cost-effective multimorbidity prediction models. Based on predictors easily obtainable in clinical practice (sociodemographic, clinical, family disease history and lifestyle), we build and compared the performance of seven multilabel classifiers (multivariate random forest, and classifier chain, binary relevance and binary dependence, with random forest and support vector machine as base classifiers), using a sample of 15105 participants from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil). We developed a web application for the ...\n\nBackground Metabolic syndrome (MetS), a major contributor to cardiovascular disease and diabetes, is considered to be among the most common public health problems worldwide. Objective We aimed to identify and rank the most important nutritional and nonnutritional factors contributing to the development of MetS using a data-mining method. Methods This prospective study was performed on 3048 adults (aged ≥20 years) who participated in the fifth follow-up examination of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study, who were followed for 3 years. MetS was defined according to the modified definition of the National Cholesterol Education Program/Adult Treatment Panel III. The importance of variables was obtained by the training set using the random forest model for determining factors with the greatest contribution to developing MetS. Results Among the 3048 participants, 701 (22.9%) developed MetS during the study period. The mean age of the participants was 44.3 years (SD 11.8).
