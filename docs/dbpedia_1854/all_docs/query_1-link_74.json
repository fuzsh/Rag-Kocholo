        "text": "Academic knowledge creation takes place physically, mentally and/or virtually in interaction, in ba. Ba is an expression in Japanese meaning in English approximately ‘place’ (Nonaka & Konno, 1998, p. 40). This place is also an arena of discourse, a way of talking and writing about research (Watson, 2003, p. 113). Discourse varies situationally and is interpreted individually (see Creplet, 2000; Augier et al., 2001, p. 129). The article focuses on studying ba in the context of international academic knowledge creation. In this study, ba means the context and arena of discourse where knowledge is created.\n\nThe motivation for this study is to deepen the understanding of the context of discursive knowledge creation (ba) in internationalising universities. This is important for two reasons. First, in internationalising universities, research groups increasingly consist of persons originating from many countries. This poses various challenges for knowledge creation. Not all members of research groups communicate in their mother tongue, which may affect the content and interpretation of knowledge-creating discourse. On the other hand, research groups may become more innovative than internally homogeneous groups if they are diverse and exist long enough to create common understanding (Watson et al., 1993; Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995; Elron, 1997). Different group members have different views about the same research problem. For example, cultural backgrounds affect thinking and behaviour and generational diversity in a group enables researchers with more experience in work and life to share their experiences with younger researchers (e.g. Hofstede & Hofstede, 2004). Both the opportunities and challenges of knowledge creation in diverse groups come together in the ba, where common interest, commitment and language must find their places (e.g. Csikszentmihalyi & Sawyer, 1995; Barron, 2003).\n\nSecond, according to several researchers, ba needs to be conceptualised more deeply than scholars have done so far (Creplet, 2000; Augier et al., 2001; Ray & Little, 2001; Fayard, 2003; Nakamori 2006). Clarification requires understanding of the processes inside ba. In this article, ba is considered in association with discourse, which reveals new aspects from ba (see Barron, 2003, p. 309). To explore ba in practice, three different academic research groups highlighting three realms of knowledge creation at universities were selected. In general and in these case research groups, humanists create subjective knowledge about the social world that speaks, whereas engineers use available resources to create technology for people and scientists seek to understand nature objectively often through numerical data (Habermas, 1972; Eto, 2008). However, knowledge created in many academic projects combines these knowledge types and subjective and objective approaches to knowledge. In addition, researchers view the research problem individually. For example, a scientist might concentrate on the perspectives that are applicable to technological devices and combine objective data with subjective views on users’ needs. Even though the categories of humanists, engineers and scientists are simplifications of the academic realm, they are useful since academia is organised around them.\n\nThis study includes a case research group from each realm: a humanistic (the H-group), technical (the T-group) and scientific (the S-group) group from the University of Oulu in Finland, the country's most international large university with over 16,000 students and 3000 staff (University of Oulu, 2008). The H-group is applying a certain key concept to completely new contexts and by doing this also refining humanistic (hermeneutic) knowledge. The T-group is involved in computer science and promoting technical knowledge. The S-group studies plants with scientific knowledge. The groups are international; they include 5–20 researchers from both Finland and abroad, publish articles in international journals, frequently attend international conferences and communicate mostly in non-native language.\n\nThe more detailed research questions are:\n\nIn what kind of ba (here as a virtual, physical and mental context) do the research groups create knowledge?\n\nWhat does ba (here as an arena of discourse) consist of in the research groups?\n\nThe main findings suggest that different types of knowledge are created in different kinds of bas and discourses. The humanist knowledge of the H-group with abstract concepts and philosophical discussions is created through social and conceptual closeness, whereas such attention to language and social bonds is not needed in the T- and S-groups that create more specific knowledge. Technical knowledge in the T-group is created in a project organised like clockwork where employees trust one another, while the S-group's autonomous researchers create scientific knowledge as parts of the global scientific community. They are autonomous since each researcher works on their own study while a few senior researchers guide them and the programme as a whole. The three case research groups’ bas are blends of the type of knowledge created, suitable characteristics of a group-member and structural factors related to administrative responsibilities.\n\nThe article is organised as follows. Internationalising universities in Finland and the University of Oulu is presented first in the context of knowledge creation and ba in academia. The concepts of ba and discourse as elements of knowledge creation are reviewed in the second section. The aim is to illustrate their relation through theory. The third section introduces the methodology, materials and methods used in this study. In the fourth section, the case research groups are presented in more detail, as are the results of this study. This section answers what the bas of the groups consist of, and how these bas are related to their knowledge-creating discourses.\n\nUniversities are cradles of knowledge creation (Jaffe, 1989; Gibbons et al., 1994). Researchers compete internationally for space in best journals, patents to the best companies and research funding. Although the competition is global, the practices of knowledge creation are formed locally by people's actions in organisations.\n\nKnowledge creation is no longer aimed at generating knowledge, as such but, for enhancing countries’ economic and social performance by combining universities, businesses and public policies in the internationalising context (Etzkowitz & Leydesdorff, 2000). From this perspective, Finland is an interesting case. Despite its small population and language spoken in the world by less than 6 million people, Finland has been able to capitalise knowledge in various knowledge fields from arts to science and technology. Examples of this include the mobile technology solutions by Nokia, discoveries of Finnish scientists in the genetics of heritable diseases, and various globally recognised composers and music directors originating from Finland, as well as the Nobel Peace Prize laureate graduated from the University of Oulu. In addition, according to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), Finnish 15-year-old pupils are the best in sciences among 57 countries (PISA Finland, 2006).\n\nA high international level of research and teaching in universities is regarded essential in national innovation and regional development policies (Jauhiainen, 2008). Universities play a significant role in Finland, whose economy leans on knowledge and expertise. However, universities around the globe increasingly compete for the best researchers in the academic world. Finnish universities also are seeking for their share of experts. The current national education policy focuses on internationalisation of universities in Finland and, in addition, it includes tighter co-operation between universities. This process culminates in the establishment of the new ‘innovation-oriented’ university in the capital region, fusing together three currently separate institutions of higher education (Karjalainen, 2008).\n\nAmong the 10 Finnish multi-disciplinary universities, the University of Oulu has the most international ambitions, such as attracting foreign employees. According to the general, internationalisation and human resources strategies of all 10 universities, the internationalisation policy of the University of Oulu is strongly channelled towards foreign employees with a volume and accuracy not attained in the other nine universities. The word ‘international’ with its amounts and themes as well as comments on foreign employees are frequently mentioned in the strategies of the University of Oulu (University of Oulu International Strategy and Action Plan 2005–2010, 2005). Furthermore, when comparing both the absolute and the relative number of foreign employees in 2002–2006, the University of Oulu is notable compared to the other universities. The amount of foreign employees at the University of Oulu was 5–6% (165–185 persons) of all staff. At the twice-as-large University of Helsinki, there were more foreign employees than in Oulu; however, their share of all staff was substantially lower. Only in Åbo Akademi, a small university where Swedish is the only official language, is the relative amount of foreign staff higher than in Oulu (Statistics of Finland, 2008).\n\nEstablished in 1958, the University of Oulu's four focus areas are (1) sciences and health, (2) information technology, (3) cultural identity and interaction, and (4) environment, natural resources and materials. The university is divided into six faculties: technology, science, humanities, medicine, education, and economics and business administration. In addition there are several interdisciplinary research institutes. The faculties of technology, science and humanities have the most employees with foreign backgrounds. About 40% of the 760 employees in the faculty of technology have a foreign background, whereas 30% of the faculty of science's 560 employees and 6% of humanities’ 150 employees have roots abroad (Human resources, 2006).\n\nThe first research assessment exercise was carried out in the University of Oulu's departments in 2007. The panel members were international experts in each department's discipline. On a scale of 1–7 (1=lowest, 7=highest), the average quality of research in the faculty of technology is four, and in other faculties it is five. Seven departments out of 57 received the number six, this being the highest number of the assessment in the university (Jaako, 2008). Therefore, improving the international quality of research is essential for the University of Oulu. The keys to achieving this include international co-operation, publications and mobility of researchers, as well as organising researchers to work in groups and enhance the dedicated long-term work of the groups (Kinnunen, 2009, p. 31). Indeed, teamwork results more often in innovative knowledge creation than does work executed by solitary researchers (Ford, 1996; Lechler, 2001). Innovative knowledge creation leads to inventions or insights that are very useful to knowledge-creating groups and organisations. The number of foreign employees at the University of Oulu is aimed to be doubled in the near future (University of Oulu International Strategy and Action Plan 2005–2010, 2005), which is reflected in research groups increasingly consisting of employees from many countries and cultures. This is also the case in the three research groups portrayed in this article.\n\nAcademic knowledge consists of tacit (Polanyi, 1966) and explicit elements and is further justified in the global academic environment (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995). Knowledge is socially constructed, since its justification is done within the academic community. Although individuals express their knowledge, the basic unit of knowledge creation is a group that shares goals, passions and routines (Amin & Cohendent, 2004, p. 74).\n\nThree types of academic knowledge fall within the scope of this study: scientific, technical and humanistic (hermeneutic). Such categories are a simplification of the academic realm but useful, as the academy is organised around them. Empirical-analytic knowledge, in which scientific and technical knowledge are included, is ‘possible predictive knowledge’ (Habermas, 1972, p. 308). It relates to the technical interest of research and control over natural phenomena (Habermas, 1972, p. 309, see also Foucault, 1994). Both physical and technical opportunities and restrictions have to be acknowledged when designing technical products. On the basis of this, the pure sciences (physics, mathematics, chemistry and biology) can be distinguished from applied sciences (technology, medicine, agriculture and statistics) (Eto, 2008; see also Laestadius, 2000).\n\nThere are, nevertheless, similarities between science and technology. They are hard sciences concentrating on mathematical and statistical expressions in opposition to soft sciences – humanities (Wierzbicki & Nakamori, 2005). Technology and science ‘seek to explain a cosmos that has nothing to say’ (Luckmann, 2008, p. 280), whereas the social world speaks. The interest of subjective, hermeneutic knowledge is to understand and to interpret and mediate traditions (Habermas, 1972, pp. 309–310). Researchers’ material is consisted of human experience in the written and spoken form (Denzin & Lincoln, 2003, p. 56). The interpretation is done to, and through, already interpreted material.\n\nKnowledge is created through interaction in ba (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995; Lundvall & Borrás, 1999; Nonaka & von Krogh, 2009). Interaction is bound by time, space, participants, their different contexts and their trust for each other (von Krogh et al., 2000, p. 49). Nakamori's (2006, p. 12) definition of ba includes similar pieces: ba is a system of elements (e.g. infrastructure, actors), characteristics (e.g. hierarchy, communication) and relationships. Participants’ context is an ‘individual interpretation of a situation’ (Augier et al., 2001, p. 129). It is based on each individual's values, culture and experiences (see Gertler, 2003, p. 78). Therefore the context is limited. These limitations can be widened through combining participants’ contexts, through creating ba (Nonaka & Toyama, 2003, pp. 6–7; Nonaka et al., 2008, pp. 118–119).\n\nBa enables creating and sharing knowledge and its interpretations (Nonaka & Konno, 1998; Nonaka & Toyama, 2003). According to Nonaka & Konno (1998, pp. 40–41) ba is physical (e.g. café), mental (e.g. sharing personal experiences and ideas) and sometimes virtual (e.g. e-mail) (Konagaya, 2005; Senoo et al., 2007; Kivijärvi, 2008; Rafaeli et al., 2009). Ba exists in individual, group and organisational levels, which can convergence and form a ‘basho’; the ba of an individual is ‘team’ and ba of teams is ‘organisation’ (Nonaka & Konno, 1998, p. 41; Watanuki & Kojima, 2007; Nonaka et al., 2008, p. 134; Travaille & Hendriks, 2010). Similarly, Creplet (2000, p. 373) discusses generic and specific ba, the former describing general arenas of interaction in an organisation and the latter existing in context with a common goal, such as a project.\n\nAccording to Nonaka & Konno (1998, p. 45–47), different types of bas enable interaction characteristics for different phases of knowledge creation. In originating ba, tacit knowledge can be shared face-to-face through socialisation. Some parts of tacit knowledge can be externalised in interacting or dialoguing ba. Sharing and combining existing knowledge can result in new knowledge in virtual cyber ba. In exercising ba members of the group internalise knowledge whereupon it becomes part of their tacit knowledge pool. This SECI process (socialisation, externalisation, combination and internalisation of knowledge) leads to continuous learning and the subsequent iterations of knowledge creation in a group (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995).\n\nBa has found its way especially into the field of knowledge management. It has also been an issue in innovation studies and, for instance, in geography (Kostiainen, 2002). Although companies are the most common cases in these studies, some applications to the academic world can be pointed out (e.g. Brännback, 2003; Hansson, 2007; Tian et al., 2009; Travaille & Hendriks, 2010). An interesting research study focused on the possibility to design a scientific knowledge management environment (Oliveira et al., 2006), which allows the promotion of knowledge as well (Alvarenga Neto, 2007). According to Nomura (2002), ba can be designed when both the knowledge strategy and individual working styles of an organisation are taken into consideration. The restriction of designing ba points to its very core: social interaction. We can plan offices and software, but we cannot plan communication. For example, even though an organisation has an inviting coffee room, it is impossible to control who comes for a coffee and who does not, what is the topic of discussion there, and how employees interpret such talks and the related atmosphere. In the end, the understanding of ba comes down to interaction and discourse (see also Nonaka & Konno, 1998; Nonaka & Toyama, 2005, p. 249).\n\nLanguage, discourse and knowledge are related. Several studies show that a high level of interaction in a group positively influences innovative knowledge creation (Lechler, 2001; Barron, 2003). Language itself is a social construction and convention within a group of people. It is the ‘vehicle of knowing […] and carries meaning which we ascribe to words’ (Renzl, 2007, p. 46). To arrive at knowledge means to travel in a discursive space (Xu, 2000, p. 428). In other words, knowledge is created through discourse, which (re)forms through interaction in ba: a space of knowledge creation (Figure 1). Although most studies have not focused on ba’s relation to discourse, Nonaka et al. (2008) have considered ba as a narrative.\n\nApproaches and definitions on discourse are wide (Grant et al., 1998; Hardy et al., 2000, p. 1231). Discourse can be found in written texts and verbal interaction (Mulkay, 1974; Potter & Wetherell, 1987, p. 7). It reveals itself as the way to speak about the world in context; it is ‘language in its concrete living totality’ (Bakhtin, 1984, p. 181). Discourse is local and situational construction and inseparable from cognition and culture (Grant et al., 1998, p. 12; Alvesson & Karreman, 2000). Discourses influence our behaviour (Potter & Wetherell, 1987, p. 6; Watson, 2003, p. 113). In this line of research, discourse analysis can reveal aspects behind discourse (see also van Dijk, 1997), in other words, it can unveil ba as an arena of discourse.\n\nAdopted from Watson (2003, p. 113), discourse here means ‘a connected set of statements, concepts, terms and expressions which constitute a way of talking or writing about’ research, for example, how certain research groups justify and produce knowledge. In the article, this is empirically discussed with the case groups from the University of Oulu. The expression ‘way of talking or writing about’ refers to two issues. First, it refers to the presumption made through the theory of ba and discourse that individuals have a common context of knowledge creation (ba), within which they as a group communicate through discourse. For example, a research group shares the same research interest. Certain concepts become essential; some are adopted from researchers’ own experience and some from other scholars. These concepts are repeated in their discourse. Second, it refers to discourse's affect on employees’ actions as researchers (Watson, 2003, p. 113). For instance, when scholars find a new, interesting way to study a phenomenon, it becomes a part of their speech. Other researchers may find the idea interesting and start a new research project on it.\n\nKnowledge is both an input and output of discourse (Weinberger et al., 2007): employees use knowledge to influence others (Xu, 2000, p. 447). Discourses occur in episteme, which is a tacit system framing knowledge in historical time (Foucault, 1994, pp. 344–348). Each ba's arenas – mental, physical and/or virtual – shed their frame to discourse and emerge within the episteme of our time (Table 1). The relation is reciprocal: discourse also changes ba. Emotions, values and ideas are shared and processed through language. This creates a discourse that an individual interprets and in which s/he participates. The interaction takes place physically. When the participants interact face-to-face, they also communicate with many signals other than only language, for example, facial expressions, gestures and positions (Kayes et al., 2005, p. 584). Physical settings include socio-cultural expectations, also in different informal knowledge-creation contexts, such as how to speak and act in a fine restaurant or on a casual camping trip. Sometimes knowledge is created virtually, which might include a risk of misunderstandings, especially when communicating through a second language.\n\nThe glocal (Robertson, 1992, pp. 173–174) discourse in a research group consists of academic terms related to the global level of academic discourse shared by several scholars and a local, organisational language that is saturated by the organisation's employees, goals, strategies and practices. The discourse becomes reformed in every situation and interpretation (Nunan, 1993, p. 8). Researchers are a part of the academic world (basho) in which academic (global) discourse is intertwined with the practical, organisational (local) discourse.\n\nCase study is a suitable research strategy when it is necessary to study the phenomenon empirically in its context. The advantage of the case study method increases when the theoretical refinement of a concept, such as ba, is still in its process (Yin, 1994). This study includes three case research groups. The number of the groups is small, but in the context of exploratory research it is enough to illustrate the relation between group discourse and ba, and clarify the uniqueness of ba in relation to the knowledge-type created.\n\nThe case research groups for this research were selected from three faculties at the University of Oulu: those of technology, science and humanities. The T-group was selected from the Faculty of Technology because the group's research field belongs to one of the focus areas of the University of Oulu. The H- and the S-groups are more oriented towards basic research whereas the T-group co-operates with companies and its research is focused on developing a technological product with also commercial value. In addition, the groups differ in the time in which they have conducted their research, their size and their collaboration practices. Despite this, all the groups contribute to their international academic fields and create knowledge constantly.\n\nFurther criteria for the selection of the research groups were, first, some members are Finns and others foreigners; second, the groups have produced several international publications and attended international conferences; third, the groups had been working together for several months at the time of the interviews that were conducted in 2006–2007. Face-to-face interviews were conducted one-on-one. Altogether 12 interviews were conducted: three from the H-group, three from the S-group and six from the T-group. A single interview took about 30–60 min. The duration in minutes of the interviews are as follows: T-group 23, 26, 34, 37, 37 and 38, S-group 44, 47 and 55, and H-group 58, 62 and 74. The experience of the interviewees differs. The research group leaders were among the interviewees as well as the more experienced researchers together with the researchers in the early stage of their careers. The main themes of the interviews were the social working environment and processes of academic knowledge creation. From all these groups, the work of the T-group reminds most of the conditions in which the SECI-model and ba were created (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995). For example, they develop commercial products. Accordingly, the interviewees of the T-group found the questions considering the process of knowledge creation through socialisation, externalisation, combination and internalisation to be very realistic and the need to ask further questions was minimal. Therefore, the interviews remained shorter and more members were selected as the interviewees. Another basis for selecting more interviewees from the T-group is their task-based project. Employees work with certain tasks and cooperation has formed around these ‘task-groups’. Interviewees have been selected from different tasks to get the overall picture of their knowledge creation.\n\nWords, expressing concepts that form the foundation of thinking, appear as patterns in text. These patterns are the focus of discourse analysis (Tsoukas, 2005; see also van Dijk, 1997, p. 5) that analyses language in social contexts (Potter & Wetherell, 1987). Discourse analysis was applied to the interviews conducted for this research. The interviews were first transcribed word-for-word into text. Breaks, inhalations, exhalations, volume (quiet/loud), laughs, gestures and shifts of position were also documented. The outcome was a text corpus of 125 A4 pages. The text was then analysed part-by-part, each part consisting of one topic of talk. From these parts, the main words and all metaphors (e.g. ‘research work reminds digging’) were identified. They were coded with the QSR Nvivo8 software, extending the coding throughout the text. On the basis of empirical material, 8119 coded words were organised into 30 categories. Essential words and all analogies were selected from the material through the first data reduction detailed by relevant theories. Words and analogies were then analysed in more detail by posing questions to find discourse and answering these questions through careful reading of the whole text. Through the second data reduction, descriptive examples of speech were identified. From this, a 76-paged booklet was gathered as the basis for constructing the final discourses. An example of the quotations and conclusions is in Appendix.\n\nThe humanists’ H-group consists of five researchers: one professor, one senior researcher and three Ph.D. students (Table 2). The researchers with a foreign background are European. In addition to conducting research, all of them also teach. Their research idea evolved from the professor's previous project and observations they made about society. These observations led to acknowledging the importance of cultural understanding in international co-operation. The researchers started to discuss and develop the idea that a certain central concept of the discipline could be applied from conventional use to a wider context, to different societal phenomena. Their research includes the concept's usage as both a descriptive concept and a method to study phenomena. The most important recent event in the H-group was an international conference that they arranged in 2008. The theme of the conference dealt with the idea of applying the central concept of their field in new contexts and the conference attracted a lot of researchers. Presently the group is finishing an article and one of the researchers her Ph.D.\n\nThe technologists’ T-group's personnel include a professor and a senior researcher, who both are responsible directors. The two research assistants with a foreign background are European and the responsible director is Asian. Together with the steering group they lead and plan the research work in general. The project manager is in charge of more practical organisation of the work. The rest of the group consists of research assistants. They are developing a particular application for mobile phones. The T-group's project has created three new projects, and three of the research assistants have started to do their Ph.D.'s. During the project, nine international articles have been published.\n\nThe research programme built by the leader of the scientist S-group dealt with plants. The composition of the group is dynamic because of research exchanges and students, who contribute the group with short-term projects. Most group members are Ph.D. students and the rest include graduate students, technicians, and post-doctoral or senior researchers. The post-doc with a foreign background is European. The S-group has published altogether 17 articles in international journals during 2007–2009. In addition, they have received significant funding through an EU-project and the Finnish Academy. Two new foreign employees are joining the group in the near future.\n\nFrom each of these three groups, one discourse can be identified even though it is interpreted and altered individually. In the core of all discourses are the terms ‘research’, ‘knowledge’, ‘idea’, ‘we’ and ‘communicating’. The group discourses differ in their research-specific terminology and according to how the group understands and practices teamwork.\n\nH-group: social and conceptual closeness\n\nWe here are almost like a family […] I know uh what things they are interested in at this stage, I know whether it's appropriate to talk about this particular thing at this moment or if they have a sick child at home. (Researcher, the H-group)\n\nThere's very much sort of discussion and exchanging just very basic, maybe philosophical ideas or to make sure that everyone has the same perception of reality and some very fundamental things and a, and trying understand each other's research […] it evolves very much around coffee tables. (Researcher, the H-group)\n\nThe H-group's social practices of knowledge creation are based on informal face-to-face interaction and dynamic mutual understanding. Their common discourse of maintaining social closeness is coherent in all interviewees’ speech, for example, through the words ‘thinking’, ‘understanding’ and ‘we’. The group uses the word ‘we’ the most; it exists in their speech 0.8 times in a minute (155 times), whereas 0.6 times in a minute in the speech of the T-group (117 times) and 76 times in the S-group's interviews (0.5 times in a minute). ‘We’ for the H-group are the research group and the rest of the department. Their social closeness is partly a result of the initial stage in their research project in which forming mutual understanding of the research problem and terms is important.\n\nT-group: human trust and technical clockwork\n\nEverybody is a component. You need to interface to connect with others. Like we set some deadline and we need to make every component together to make the whole system work. If you don’t trust it, the rest of the system, it will be a big problem. You cannot take care of everything there. […] My feeling is that you have to try your best to make your component perfect. And you have to trust the others who are working together with you, who are interfacing with you, are working as good as you. (Researcher, the T-group)\n\nTechnology that the T-group is creating in co-operation with firms is unique and new to the world. The team is a forerunner, which can be heard in their speech. Especially the young researchers are proud of themselves and their work. The core of their discourse is a blend of human and technical matters. The researchers trust each other's know-how, which is why tasks are clearly divided in a group. The research project resembles a clockwork mechanism: it is divided into tasks conducted by pairs or groups of researchers that have one responsible person. Similarly, a technical device is concrete and can be divided into pieces. Technical research can be constructed the same way as long as there is a common goal is in engineers’ minds. The T-group meets each other regularly. More formal meetings are held with companies to demonstrate the group's achievements.\n\nS-group: autonomous researchers part of global scientific community\n\nIn the end there is a lot of such knowledge in operating within the academic community that is sort of like connected to, you know, social practices and to like operating within a community, and there are like no rules anywhere how to do it, […] let's say that an article was sent forward and it was returned with editing suggestions, well, there's no manual that would prescribe how this editor should be replied to. (Researcher, the S-group)\n\nThe S-group is formed of quite autonomous researchers who share a common interest. They are gathered around a certain research programme on plants. Each researcher works on their own study while a few senior researchers guide them and the programme as a whole. The leader is the practical core of the programme. This programme provides research topics for many interested international visiting researchers who come to Oulu for a short period. As a result, the research programme develops with an inflow of new ideas and personalities. To keep the researchers as a group, they have a weekly meeting that everyone must attend. Internationally relevant knowledge is created also in more informal personal meetings. The speech of these researchers shows that they are strongly bound to the global scientific community. Scientific knowledge is accurate, and professionals understand and interpret it quite similarly without clarification of philosophical backgrounds. Despite this, it is important to notice that field and laboratory work includes a lot of tacit knowledge. It requires great exactitude to form good data. That is one reason why it is important to work as a group.\n\nThe case research groups all have different physical, virtual and/or mental bas. Their main characters are shown in Table 3. The group discourses are formed and reflected in these common contexts.\n\nAlthough face-to-face communication is essential in all knowledge creation in the case groups, the role of physical ba is different in the case research groups. The H-group's social closeness is reflected in their physical environment. Researchers visit each other's offices constantly. Their offices are located side by side and their doors are always open. Those T-group's research assistants who work in the same task share the office. Therefore they communicate frequently and share tacit knowledge. For example, they explain their ideas to each other by showing technical language on the computer screen. The laboratory and meeting room are the key places for the S-group's interactive knowledge creation.\n\nThe discourses of the case research groups have grown under three main factors as explained below: knowledge type, individual characteristics and structural factors (Figure 2). The same factors frame the creation of ba.\n\nKnowledge type\n\nThe first element of ba and discourse is the knowledge type. The hermeneutic, technical and scientific knowledge the research groups create, are different philosophically, epistemologically and empirically. The social practices linked to the ways to create these types of knowledge are different in each group. In other words, the specific ba of knowledge creation, as well as the level and ways of interaction, vary. The H-group's hermeneutic knowledge is created with social and conceptual closeness. Technical knowledge is built up with a blend of human trust, and clockwork in the T-group. Scientific knowledge is created by the more autonomous researchers of the S-group, who are part of the global research community.\n\nThe groups have developed practical modes of organising themselves that support their knowledge creation. These modes include the level of social bond, the role of ‘second language’, and the relationship of researchers to knowledge and research subjects. The level of social bond varies between groups. The H-group's researchers talk more about ‘we’ than the other groups do. They are socially close to each other, which promotes their mutual understanding and the creation of hermeneutic knowledge seeking to understand the phenomena under research. The T-group's work-oriented team spirit built on trust is the core of the group's well-defined project. The S-group's researchers are the most autonomous, but their spirit relies on knowledge sharing and ample viewpoints enabled by the amount and exchanges of researchers.\n\nAcademic ‘second language’ is used as a medium of communication in different ways. Mutual understanding of the abstract concepts, whose application is central in the H-group's research, is essential. The researchers do not consider language plainly as a way of communicating – it is important to know the cultural tacit knowledge behind words. The researchers in the H-group communicate and publish articles in a common, Central European language, but also in Finnish, and cultivate analogies in their language. Their ability to use two languages and the wide use of analogies enable an in-depth language that is suitable for sharing abstract ideas.\n\nThe T- and S-group's language is more straightforward. Scientific and technical terms used in the groups are accurate as is the role of language. English is the language of technical terms and the T-group uses the work-related language fluently. The terms remain in English even when the language used otherwise is Finnish. However, to speak in English about topics other than work in English is difficult for some members. In addition, trust is related mostly to their professional know-how, not to the members’ personal relationships. The T-group has few analogies that relate to the practices of knowledge creation: they are ‘components’ who need to co-operate to form a ‘system’; a functional group.\n\nScientific language is based on well-defined terms that researchers of the S-group understand similarly. The language in weekly meetings often revolves around numeric data. In fact, data can be seen as an extension of language that is quite straightforward: ‘mostly we are just discussing the […] problem, so metaphors maybe not, we are more straightforward’ (Researcher, the S-group). In other words, English is a practical working language.\n\nThe role of the researcher in relation to knowledge and the object of the research vary in the groups as well. The H-group's members acknowledge their subjectivity as researchers. They do not believe that it is possible to produce objective knowledge about their research area. Due to this, they need to understand each other to understand the knowledge they are creating. The researchers of the H-group believe that their research subject becomes an inseparable part of their lives: ‘once you think of (a certain concept) in a very broad sense, then you also have to practise that’ (Researcher, the H-group). In contrast, in the S-group, scientific knowledge is thought to be objective. They stress the scientific and societal relevance of their research subject. Technical knowledge of the T-group is commercial and quite objective in terms of including scientific knowledge such as mathematics. Societal and commercial aspects are within the scope of the T-group's research since they need to be aware of the market demand and to consider what kind of technology users want.\n\nIndividual characteristics\n\nThe second element of ba is related to the individual characteristics of the ideal member for the S-, H- and T-groups. Although every researcher has their own interpretation of the discourse and ba (Augier et al., 2001), still a broad picture of the ideal member can be identified. If new members are employed on the basis of these ‘ideal characteristics’, the discourses are encouraged to continue.\n\nThe most important characteristic of the H-group's researcher is his/her social skills. This is in line with the creation of hermeneutic knowledge as a socially close group. The T-group values hard-working, innovative and genuinely interested researchers. The S-group appreciates researchers that have different backgrounds of career or culture, since it enables more viewpoints on same research area and therefore stimulates knowledge creation. New members participate in discourse in new ways that change it.\n\nStructural factors\n\nStructural factors of ba are related to administrative responsibilities. The university as an organisation, research funding and collaboration frame the research work. The discourse of the H-group develops within the context of a university that pressurises the department to write a growing number of international peer-reviewed articles and arrange teaching with fewer teachers. The H-group is ‘a sport team that is playing against transfer to a lower division’ (Researcher, the H-group). The idea of struggling together may result in a more cohesive group.\n\nThe T-group's collaboration with companies constrains the group to achieve concrete results within tight schedules. Several departments at the Faculty of Technology of the University of Oulu have long experience of projects and co-operation with companies. Certain practices to manage projects and co-operation have proven workable. The discourse of the S-group is formed through internationalisation and funding of their research, as well as having visiting researchers. The research area enables many viewpoints and studies.\n\nThe objective in this article was to study the ba of international academic knowledge creation. The concept of discourse is considered along with ba since it is ba's context and arena. The motivation for this study is two-fold. First, in internationalising universities, research groups increasingly consist of persons originating from many countries. This creates challenges for knowledge creation, for example, their working language is not often the mother tongue of all group members. Second, according to several researchers, the concept of ba has not been clarified enough (e.g. Creplet, 2000; Augier et al., 2001). As a result of this study, a deeper definition of ba is suggested. Ba is a physical, mental and/or virtual context of interactive knowledge creation that exists situationally in relation to the knowledge type created, individual characteristics of the participants and structural factors of an organisation. Ba is not only an individual's interpretation (see Augier et al., 2001) but a group's interpretation as well.\n\nAn exploratory dimension is added to the study through three case research groups that create humanistic (hermeneutic) (the H-group), technical (the T-group) and scientific (the S-group) knowledge. The research groups were selected from the University of Oulu, the most international large university in Finland by staff.\n\nAn exploratory case study obviously has its limitation when considering the results in wider contexts. There are only three groups studied, one from each academic realm (humanist, scientific and technical), which restricts the conclusions drawn. In addition, not all group members were interviewed, which means that the results do not represent the views of the entire groups.\n\nIn the three case groups, ba is formed in relation to the type of knowledge created, suitable characteristics of a group member and structural factors. The discourses of knowledge creation in the three groups are related to the type of knowledge being created. The H-group emphasises social and conceptual closeness, the T-group human trust and technical clockwork, and the S-group autonomous researchers’ part in the global scientific community. There are also differences in the role of second language according to different types of knowledge. When knowledge created includes abstract concepts and philosophical discussions, deeper language skills are needed. Deeper skills enable understanding of the cultural values behind language and its analogous use. This was found out in the H-group. The second element is individual characteristics that affect the interpretation and continuity of discourse. The third element is formed of structural factors, such as administration, funding and collaboration.\n\nFrom this study, one can also consider the applied side of ba. Although it is not possible to plan discourse and interaction, certain aspects of ba can be planned. This requires acknowledging what kind of knowledge is created in the group. The group should be aware of which practical modes of organising the group work support the creation of knowledge and which modes should be developed. Identifying the work-related discourse will help the group to focus communication according to their knowledge type. When the knowledge a group creates is shared easily with exact scientific terms and numerical data, virtual applications can be widely used together with meeting face-to-face. Although in-depth relations between personnel may improve atmosphere and affect knowledge creation indirectly, it might not be essential. Knowing and trusting each other's know-how may be enough and personal trust or friendships are not necessary. As a result, research periods by different researchers can be shorter and the flow of employees higher. This enables fresh ideas, boosts the group's international image and enhances its position in the global academic community.\n\nFurthermore, when knowledge includes abstract concepts and philosophical thinking, the emphasis should be on physical and structural applications that increase face-to-face contacts, informal discussions and activity outside working hours. In-depth language skills can be encouraged by research exchange, although visiting researchers coming to the group should stay long enough to learn to know members beyond their work identity. This quite slow flow of employees should not mean stability. New researchers are needed to guarantee the flow of ideas and insights.\n\nIn the future more case studies on the context of knowledge creation in international groups are needed. In general, ba is one key to understanding the knowledge-creation process and it should be considered, especially in international knowledge creation, both in and outside academia."
