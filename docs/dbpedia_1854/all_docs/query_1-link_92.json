        "text": "Liquid-liquid phase separation underpins the formation of membraneless organelles, such as nucleoli (Lafontaine et al., 2021), P-bodies (Brangwynne et al., 2009), stress granules (Molliex et al., 2015), cajal bodies (Neugebauer, 2017), and nuclear speckles (Fei et al., 2017). The integrity of such organelles is maintained by interactions between biomolecules that form condensates, or liquid droplet-like structures, in which the local concentration of individual components is higher than the surrounding environment (Yang et al., 2004). These condensates cluster relevant molecules together to facilitate interactions while allowing rapid material exchange (Yang et al., 2004; Souquere et al., 2009; Dundr and Misteli, 2010; Handwerger et al., 2005). Mounting evidence has revealed roles of phase separation in modulating reaction kinetics, enzyme catalysis, and binding specificity (Reber et al., 2021; Banani et al., 2017; Strulson et al., 2012; Banjade and Rosen, 2014; Li et al., 2012).\n\nThe protein SRSF1 (Serine/Arginine-Rich Splicing Factor 1, also known as ASF/SF2) is essential for the early-stage assembly of the spliceosome (Kohtz et al., 1994; Cho et al., 2011). Several in vivo studies have shown that SRSF1 is found in condensates (Fei et al., 2017; Hammarskjold and Rekosh, 2017; Haward et al., 2021; Lamond and Spector, 2003; Azpurua et al., 2021; Ilik et al., 2020; Li and Wang, 2021). Aberrant condensation behaviors have also been observed in disease states (Azpurua et al., 2021; Ilik et al., 2020; Li and Wang, 2021). SRSF1 belongs to the Ser/Arg-rich protein family (SR proteins), which contains 12 members possessing one to two structured RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs) and a repetitive Arg/Ser repeat region (RS domain; Shepard and Hertel, 2009; Tacke and Manley, 1995; Screaton et al., 1995). The RS region is also found in the much larger family of SR-related proteins, which contain the repetitive RS regions but not the other structural features (Blencowe et al., 1999; Cascarina and Ross, 2022). Two SR-related proteins, SRRM2 (serine-arginine rich repetitive matrix protein 2) and SON, are essential for the formation and structural maintenance of the membraneless organelles nuclear speckles (Ahn et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2022). Like many other splicing factors, SRSF1 modulates trafficking to the speckles (Tripathi et al., 2012). It has been demonstrated that SRSF1 is found in nuclear speckles when its RS domain is partially phosphorylated but that hyperphosphorylation causes the protein to leave nuclear speckles (Aubol et al., 2018; Gui et al., 1994). It is therefore evident that RS domains play an important role in the organization of nuclear speckles. However, an understanding of the nature of that interaction has been evasive due to a difficulty solubilizing the proteins involved. As with all 12 SR proteins and many speckle components, obtaining soluble SRSF1 has been an imposing challenge for decades, and this has substantially hindered our understanding of the functions of these proteins and of nuclear speckles as a whole (Shepard and Hertel, 2009).\n\nPhase separation is frequently mediated by repetitive sequences. Here, we find this to be the case for the protein SRSF1, whose phase separation is dependent on its RS repeats. Our bioinformatic analysis reveals a correlation of RS repeats with a tendency to phase separate. We successfully solubilize SRSF1 using short peptides that mimic RS repeats. Our success in solubilizing SRSF1 provides an unprecedented opportunity to elucidate the mechanism by which RS repeats interact with SRSF1. We find that this increase in solubility is due to a competition between the peptide and RS domains for the same binding sites on RRM domains. We further discover that acidic residues and aromatic residues from SRSF1 RRMs interact with the RS region through salt bridges and cation-pi interactions. We find that many of the RRM sites interacting with RS repeats are conserved among the SR protein family. These findings provide insight into how interactions between SR and SR-related proteins may occur within membraneless organelles. They also allow us to predict how the nature of these interactions might change when the RS domain becomes phosphorylated.\n\nThere is currently a need to improve methods for determining which proteins phase separate and by what mechanism they do so, but solubility concerns make isolated experiments out of reach for many proteins. To solubilize phase-separating proteins, denaturants or high concentrations of salts are typically used. Denaturants are unsuitable for experiments characterizing native state proteins. High concentrations of salts are flawed as they interfere with NMR (Wider and Dreier, 2006), SAXS (Putnam et al., 2007), and circular dichroism (Greenfield, 2006). Some proteins experience salting out when ionic co-solutes are introduced (Murthy et al., 2019; Ryan et al., 2018; Martin et al., 2021). For example, we found that the solubility of SRSF1 is around 2–7 μM in 1–5 M of NaCl (data not shown).\n\nThe protein solubilizing strategy used here is of wide applicability, not just confined to the examples of SRSF1 and Nob1. Our bioinformatic search revealed that RS-containing proteins are highly abundant and that there is a positive correlation between these repeats and phase separation. In addition to RS repeats, GG, KK, QQ, PP, and RG demonstrated both a strong positive correlation between repeat length and phase separation and robust enough sample sizes to render these results significant (Supplementary file 1). However, it is important to note that the repeats mentioned above are likely not a comprehensive list of repetitive sequences conducive to phase separation. In fact, aside from LL, SG, PL, and TA repeats, all dipeptides that exist in 8-mer sequences possess at least a weak positive correlation between repeat length and tendency to appear in condensates (Supplementary file 1). It is also important to note that with our current knowledge, there is a possibility for both overestimation and underestimation of phase-separating proteins when using these databases. Some proteins that phase separate may not yet be identified. Further, proteins reported to be in condensates do not necessarily phase separate on their own. It is also possible that a protein can have more than one type of repeated motif mediating phase separation. For these reasons, in vitro phase separation experiments using purified protein are imperative. We hope that the use of this method will expand the number of techniques available to perform such experiments. Development of peptide structure-activity relationships (SARs) may serve as a technique for identifying the repeats responsible for phase separation as well. For instance, if a SAR reveals that a protein with more than one repetitive sequence reaches optimum solubility with one particular peptide mimic, the repetitive sequence corresponding to the peptide mimic may contribute more towards driving phase separation. Likewise, if a SAR reveals that a mixture of multiple mimic peptides is optimal for enhancing solubility, it is possible that multiple repetitive sequences within the protein are responsible for phase separation.\n\nCharacterization of intermolecular interactions that occur in the dispersed (soluble) state is an accepted method of understanding what interactions lead to phase separation (Murthy and Fawzi, 2020; Ryan et al., 2018; Emmanouilidis et al., 2021). A previous comparison of intermolecular PRE spectra of the protein FUS in the dispersed versus the condensed (phase separated) state indicated that the transient intermolecular interactions seen between molecules in the solution state are comparable to the intermolecular contacts seen when the protein is phase separated (Murthy et al., 2019; Monahan et al., 2017 as discussed in Murthy and Fawzi, 2020). Our technique is unique in that it provides transient competition for the intermolecular interactions that lead to phase separation without abolishing these interactions entirely. We find that both RNA binding (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) and homotypic intermolecular interactions (Figure 4E) can still occur in a peptide-containing buffer. However, the presence of the peptide weakens intermolecular interactions enough to allow high quality NMR spectra to be obtained.\n\nHere, we find that targeted competition for intermolecular interactions provides direct control over the critical point for phase separation, enabling experiments to be performed in the dispersed state that otherwise might not be possible. The ability to compare dispersed and condensed states for more proteins is still desirable. NMR spectra of isolated low complexity domains in the condensed state have been obtained successfully for several proteins including HNRNPA2, FUS, and a Caprin1-pFMRP complex (Murthy et al., 2019; Ryan et al., 2018; Wong et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2019; Burke et al., 2015). However, interactions between the structured domains and low complexity domains of these proteins have not yet been probed using these techniques. One bottleneck to obtaining usable condensed state samples involves obtaining high concentrations of soluble protein before inducing phase separation in the sample (Murthy et al., 2019; Ryan et al., 2018; Wong et al., 2020). Due to the high concentrations needed for an NMR backbone assignment and the negative effect of sample viscosity on NMR spectral quality, it is also more practical to perform backbone assignments of proteins in the dispersed states (Murthy et al., 2019; Ryan et al., 2018; Wong et al., 2020). We hope our method may serve as a useful tool in expanding these techniques.\n\nHomotypic intermolecular interactions and interactions with the peptides involve residues similar to those involved in intramolecular interactions. However, intermolecular interactions seem to have a greater preference for the more negatively charged RRM1. Whereas interactions with RRM1 appear at all concentrations studied, a concentration of 25 mM peptide is needed to observe bleaching of W134 and A150 on the electropositive RRM2 domain (Figure 4C). This difference may be due to the fact that, while intramolecular interactions involve an RS domain tethered to RRM2 that helps facilitate interaction, external RS repeats do not have a method of compensating for this charge repulsion.\n\nThis preference for RRM1 is interesting because the interactions seen on RRM2 involve the same residues that bind to RNA (Cléry et al., 2013), but the interactions on RRM1 are opposite the RNA-binding interface (Cléry et al., 2021). In fact, chemical shift perturbations performed in a previous study indicate that the α1 helical residues on RRM1, in particular, remain virtually unaffected when two different RNA ligands are introduced, indicating there are also no allosteric effects (Cléry et al., 2021). Further, negative charges in this region are conserved across multiple SR protein family members (Figure 6). This suggests that RRM domains of SR proteins may have alternative sites used to mediate the protein-protein interactions that lead to phase separation. This is important because it means that the effect of phase separation on RNA binding can potentially be studied by disruption of these distal sites.\n\nAs we learn more about biomolecular condensates, it is of interest to understand what causes proteins to migrate to one condensate over another. It has been shown that the isolated SRSF2 RRM can localize to speckles on its own (Greig et al., 2020), which suggests there may be an additional molecular grammar within the structured components of these proteins that directs them towards nuclear speckles. It is known that speckles rely on RS repeats as scaffolds, as truncation of SRRM2’s regions containing RS repeats (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) disrupts speckles (Ilik et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2022). It is possible that these RS repeats function in part by providing multiple interaction sites for this type of RRM.\n\nIdeas and speculation\n\nWe demonstrate that electronegative α1 and α2 helices along with neighboring aromatic residues serve as interacting sites for unphosphorylated RS repetitive sequences. This finding has implications for how phosphorylation might change interactions within the speckles. If negatively charged residues are important for maintaining protein-protein interactions, charge repulsion between a hyperphosphorylated tail and acidic residues might be one reason that SR proteins leave the speckles upon hyperphosphorylation (Gui et al., 1994). Phosphoserines of RS repeats have been proposed to form salt bridges with neighboring arginine residues (Hamelberg et al., 2007), although any such contacts are likely short-lived and do not result in a stable secondary structure (Ngo et al., 2008; Xiang et al., 2013). Temporary phosphoserine-arginine contacts may be sufficient to compete with the highly transient cation-pi stacking interactions that we observe here."
