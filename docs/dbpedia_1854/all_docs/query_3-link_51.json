        "text": "Excerpts\n\nSahih Bukhari 1.2.76\n\nNarrated By Ibn 'Umar.7 Allah's Apostle said: Islam is based on (the following) five (principles):\n\n1. To testify that none has the right to be worshiped but Allah and Muhammad is Allah's Apostle.\n\n2. To offer the (compulsory congregational) prayers dutifully and perfectly.\n\n3. To pay Zakat (i.e. obligatory charity)\n\n4. To perform Hajj (i.e. Pilgrimage to Mecca)\n\n5. To observe fast during the month of Ramadan.\n\nSahih Bukhari 1.2.10\n\nNarrated By Abu Musa.8 Some people asked Allah's Apostle, \"Whose Islam is the best? i.e. (Who is a very good Muslim)?\" He replied, \"One who avoids harming the Muslims with his tongue and hands.\"\n\nSahih Bukhari 1.2.11\n\nNarrated By 'Abdullah bin 'Amr.9 A man asked the Prophet , \"What sort of deeds or (what qualities of) Islam are good?\" The Prophet replied, \"To feed (the poor) and greet those whom you know and those whom you do not know.\"\n\nSahih Bukhari 1.2.12\n\nNarrated By Anas.10 The Prophet said, \"None of you will have faith till he wishes for his (Muslim) brother what he likes for himself.\"\n\nSahih Bukhari 1.2.30\n\nNarrated By Al-Ahnaf bin Qais.11 While I was going to help this man ('Ali Ibn Abi Talib), Abu Bakra met me and asked, \"Where are you going?\" I replied, \"I am going to help that person.\" He said, \"Go back for I have heard Allah's Apostle saying, 'When two Muslims fight (meet) each other with their swords, both the murderer as well as the murdered will go to the Hell-fire.' I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! It is all right for the murderer but what about the murdered one?' Allah's Apostle replied, \"He surely had the intention to kill his companion.\"\n\nSahih Bukhari 1.2.32\n\nNarrated By Abu Huraira.12 The Prophet said, \"The signs of a hypocrite are three:\n\n1. Whenever he speaks, he tells a lie.\n\n2. Whenever he promises, he always breaks it (his promise).\n\n3. If you trust him, he proves to be dishonest. (If you keep something as a trust with him, he will not return it.)\"\n\nSahih Bukhari 1.2.37\n\nNarrated By Abu Huraira. Allah's Apostle said, \"Whoever observes fasts during the month of Ramadan out of sincere faith, and hoping to attain Allah's rewards, then all his past sins will be forgiven.\"\n\nSahih Bukhari 1.2.47\n\nNarrated By Abu Huraira. One day while the Prophet was sitting in the company of some people, (The angel) Gabriel came and asked, \"What is faith?\" Allah's Apostle replied, 'Faith is to believe in Allah, His angels, (the) meeting with Him, His Apostles, and to believe in Resurrection.\" Then he further asked, \"What is Islam?\" Allah's Apostle replied, \"To worship Allah Alone and none else, to offer prayers perfectly to pay the compulsory charity (Zakat) and to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan.\" Then he further asked, \"What is Ihsan (perfection)?\" Allah's Apostle replied, \"To worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you cannot achieve this state of devotion then you must consider that He is looking at you.\" Then he further asked, \"When will the Hour be established?\" Allah's Apostle replied, \"The answerer has no better knowledge than the questioner. But I will inform you about its portents.\n\n1. When a slave (lady) gives birth to her master.\n\n2. When the shepherds of black camels start boasting and competing with others in the construction of higher buildings. And the Hour is one of five things which nobody knows except Allah.\n\nThe Prophet then recited: \"Verily, with Allah (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour...\" (31. 34) Then that man (Gabriel) left and the Prophet asked his companions to call him back, but they could not see him. Then the Prophet said, \"That was Gabriel who came to teach the people their religion.\" Abu 'Abdullah said: He (the Prophet) considered all that as a part of faith.\n\nSahih Bukhari 1.6.302\n\nNarrated By 'Aisha.13 We set out with the Prophet for Hajj and when we reached Sarif I got my menses. When the Prophet came to me, I was weeping. He asked, \"Why are you weeping?\" I said, \"I wish if I had not performed Hajj this year.\" He asked, \"May be that you got your menses?\" I replied, \"Yes.\" He then said, \"This is the thing which Allah has ordained for all the daughters of Adam. So do what all the pilgrims do except that you do not perform the Tawaf round the Ka'ba till you are clean.\"\n\nSahih Bukhari 1.6.305\n\nNarrated By 'Aisha. Whenever anyone of us got her menses, she, on becoming clean, used to take hold of the blood spot and rub the blood off her garment, and pour water over it and wash that portion thoroughly and sprinkle water over the rest of the garment. After that she would pray in (with) it.\n\nSahih Bukhari 1.6.315\n\nNarrated By Anas bin Malik. The Prophet said, \"At every womb Allah appoints an angel who says, 'O Lord! A drop of semen, O Lord! A clot. O Lord! A little lump of flesh.\" Then if Allah wishes (to complete) its creation, the angel asks, (O Lord!) Will it be a male or female, a wretched or a blessed, and how much will his provision be? And what will his age be?' So all that is written while the child is still in the mother's womb.\"\n\nSahih Bukhari 1.17.125\n\nNarrated By 'Abdullah bin Zaid. The Prophet went towards the Musalla and invoked Allah for rain. He faced the Qibla and wore his cloak inside out, and offered two Rakat.\n\nSahih Bukhari 2.17.126\n\nNarrated By Sharik bin 'Abdullah bin Abi Namir. I heard Anas bin Malik saying, \"On a Friday a person entered the main Mosque through the gate facing the pulpit while Allah's Apostle was delivering the Khutba.14 The man stood in front of Allah's Apostle and said, 'O Allah's Apostle! The livestock are dying and the roads are cut off; so please pray to Allah for rain.' \" Anas added, \"Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) raised both his hands and said, 'O Allah! Bless us with rain! O Allah! Bless us with rain! O Allah! Bless us with rain!' \" Anas added, \"By Allah, we could not see any trace of cloud in the sky and there was no building or a house between us and (the mountains of) Sila.\" Anas added, \"A heavy cloud like a shield appeared from behind it (i.e. Sila' Mountain). When it came in the middle of the sky, it spread and then rained.\" Anas further said, \"By Allah! We could not see the sun for a week. Next Friday a person entered through the same gate and at that time Allah's Apostle was delivering the Friday's Khutba. The man stood in front of him and said, 'O Allah's Apostle! The livestock are dying and the roads are cut off, please pray to Allah to with-hold rain.' \" Anas added, \"Allah's Apostle I raised both his hands and said, 'O Allah! Round about us and not on us. O Allah! On the plateaus, on the mountains, on the hills, in the valleys and on the places where trees grow.' So the rain stopped and we came out walking in the sun.\" Sharik asked Anas whether it was the same person who had asked for the rain (the last Friday). Anas replied that he did not know.\n\nSahih Bukhari 2.18.152\n\nNarrated By Ibn 'Umar. The Prophet said, \"The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of the death or life (i.e. birth) of someone but they are two signs amongst the signs of Allah. When you see them offer the prayer.\"\n\nSahih Bukhari 2.26.596\n\nNarrated By Abu Huraira. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, \"Whoever performs Hajj for Allah's pleasure and does not have sexual relations with his wife, and does not do evil or sins then he will return (after Hajj free from all sins) as if he were born anew.\"\n\nSahih Bukhari 2.26.601\n\nNarrated By Ibn Abbas.15 Allah's Apostle had fixed Dhul Hulaifa as the Miqat16 for the people of Medina; Al-Juhfa for the people of Sham; and Qarn Ul-Manazil for the people of Najd; and Yalamlam for the people of Yemen. So, these (above mentioned) are the Mawaqit for all those living at those places, and besides them for those who come through those places with the intention of performing Hajj and 'Umra and whoever lives within these places should assume Ihram17 from his dwelling place, and similarly the people of Mecca can assume lhram from Mecca.\n\nSahih Bukhari 3.46.693\n\nNarrated By Abu Huraira. The Prophet said, \"Whoever frees a Muslim slave, Allah will save all the parts of his body from the (Hell) Fire as he has freed the body-parts of the slave.\" Said bin Marjana said that he narrated that Hadith to 'Ali bin Al-Husain and he freed his slave for whom 'Abdullah bin Ja'far had offered him ten thousand Dirhams or one-thousand Dinars.\n\nSahih Bukhari Volume 3.46.709\n\nNarrated By Qais : When Abu Huraira accompanied by his slave came intending to embrace Islam, they lost each other on the way. (When the slave showed up) Abu Huraira said (to the Prophet), \"I make you witness that the slave is free for Allah's Cause.\"\n\nSahih Bukhari 3.49.856\n\nNarrated By Anas : It was said to the Prophet \"Would that you see Abdullah bin Ubai.\" So, the Prophet went to him, riding a donkey, and the Muslims accompanied him, walking on salty barren land. When the Prophet reached 'Abdullah bin Ubai, the latter said, \"Keep away from me! By Allah, the bad smell of your donkey has harmed me.\" On that an Ansari man said (to 'Abdullah), \"By Allah! The smell of the donkey of Allah's Apostle is better than your smell.\" On that a man from 'Abdullah's tribe got angry for 'Abdullah's sake, and the two men abused each other which caused the friends of the two men to get angry, and the two groups started fighting with sticks, shoes and hands. We were informed that the following Divine Verse was revealed (in this concern): \"And if two groups of Believers fall to fighting then, make peace between them.\" (49.9)\n\nSahih Bukhari 4.52.49\n\nNarrated By Samura : The Prophet said, \"Last night two men came to me (in a dream) and made me ascend a tree and then admitted me into a better and superior house, better of which I have never seen. One of them said, 'This house is the house of martyrs.\"\n\nSahih Bukhari 4.52.83\n\nNarrated By Anas bin Malik : The Prophet said, \"Plauge is the cause of martyrdom of every Muslim (who dies because of it).\"\n\nSahih Bukhari 4.52.88\n\nNarrated By Anas : The Emigrants and the Ansar started digging the trench around Medina carrying the earth on their backs and saying, \"We are those who have given a pledge of allegiance to Muhammad that we will I carry on Jihad as long as we live.\" The Prophet kept on replying, \"O Allah, there is no good except the good of the Hereafter; so confer Your Blessings on the Ansar and the Emigrants.\"\n\nSahih Bukhari 7.69.481\n\nNarrated By Ibn 'Umar : Allah's Apostle said, \"Whoever drinks alcoholic drinks in the world and does not repent (before dying), will be deprived of it in the Hereafter.\"\n\nSahih Bukhari 7.69.484\n\nNarrated By Abu Huraira : The Prophet said, \"An adulterer, at the time he is committing illegal sexual intercourse is not a believer; and a person, at the time of drinking an alcoholic drink is not a believer; and a thief, at the time of stealing, is not a believer.\" Ibn Shihab said: 'Abdul Malik bin Abi Bakr bin 'Abdur-Rahman bin Al- Harith bin Hisham told me that Abu Bakr used to narrate that narration to him on the authority of Abu Huraira. He used to add that Abu Bakr used to mention, besides the above cases, \"And he who robs (takes illegally something by force) while the people are looking at him, is not a believer at the time he is robbing (taking).\"\n\nSahih Bukhari 4.55.657\n\nNarrated By Abu Huraira : Allah's Apostle said, \"By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, surely (Jesus,) the son of Mary will soon descend amongst you and will judge mankind justly (as a Just Ruler); he will break the Cross and kill the pigs and there will be no Jizya (i.e. taxation taken from non Muslims). Money will be in abundance so that nobody will accept it, and a single prostration to Allah (in prayer) will be better than the whole world and whatever is in it.\" Abu Huraira added \"If you wish, you can recite (this verse of the Holy Book): 'And there is none Of the people of the Scriptures (Jews and Christians) But must believe in him (i.e Jesus as an Apostle of Allah and a human being) Before his death. And on the Day of Judgment He will be a witness Against them.\" (4.159) (See Fateh Al Bari, Page 302 Vol 7)\n\nSahih Bukhari 1.8.345\n\nNarrated By Abu Dhar : Allah's Apostle said, \"While I was at Mecca the roof of my house was opened and Gabriel descended, opened my chest, and washed it with Zam-zam water. Then he brought a golden tray full of wisdom and faith and having poured its contents into my chest, he closed it. Then he took my hand and ascended with me to the nearest heaven, when I reached the nearest heaven, Gabriel said to the gatekeeper of the heaven, 'Open (the gate).' The gatekeeper asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel answered: 'Gabriel.' He asked, 'Is there anyone with you?' Gabriel replied, 'Yes, Muhammad I is with me.' He asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel said, 'Yes.' So the gate was opened and we went over the nearest heaven and there we saw a man sitting with some people on his right and some on his left. When he looked towards his right, he laughed and when he looked toward his left he wept. Then he said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.' I asked Gabriel, 'Who is he?' He replied, 'He is Adam and the people on his right and left are the souls of his offspring. Those on his right are the people of Paradise and those on his left are the people of Hell and when he looks towards his right he laughs and when he looks towards his left he weeps.'\n\nSahih Bukhari 1.8.345\n\nThen he ascended with me till he reached the second heaven and he (Gabriel) said to its gatekeeper, 'Open (the gate).' The gatekeeper said to him the same as the gatekeeper of the first heaven had said and he opened the gate. Anas said: \"Abu Dhar added that the Prophet met Adam, Idris, Moses, Jesus and Abraham, he (Abu Dhar) did not mention on which heaven they were but he mentioned that he (the Prophet) met Adarn on the nearest heaven and Abraham on the sixth heaven. Anas said, \"When Gabriel along with the Prophet passed by Idris, the latter said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious brother.' The Prophet asked, 'Who is he?' Gabriel replied, 'He is Idris.\" The Prophet added, \"I passed by Moses and he said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious brother.' I asked Gabriel, 'Who is he?' Gabriel replied, 'He is Moses.' Then I passed by Jesus and he said, 'Welcome! O pious brother and pious Prophet.' I asked, 'Who is he?' Gabriel replied, 'He is Jesus.\n\nThen I passed by Abraham and he said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.' I asked Gabriel, 'Who is he?' Gabriel replied, 'He is Abraham. The Prophet added, 'Then Gabriel ascended with me to a place where I heard the creaking of the pens.\" Ibn Hazm and Anas bin Malik said: The Prophet said, \"Then Allah enjoined fifty prayers on my followers when I returned with this order of Allah, I passed by Moses who asked me, 'What has Allah enjoined on your followers?' I replied, 'He has enjoined fifty prayers on them.' Moses said, 'Go back to your Lord (and appeal for reduction) for your followers will not be able to bear it.' (So I went back to Allah and requested for reduction) and He reduced it to half. When I passed by Moses again and informed him about it, he said, 'Go back to your Lord as your followers will not be able to bear it.' So I returned to Allah and requested for further reduction and half of it was reduced. I again passed by Moses and he said to me: 'Return to your Lord, for your followers will not be able to bear it. So I returned to Allah and He said, 'These are five prayers and they are all (equal to) fifty (in reward) for My Word does not change.' I returned to Moses and he told me to go back once again. I replied, 'Now I feel shy of asking my Lord again.' Then Gabriel took me till we '' reached Sidrat-il-Muntaha (Lote tree of; the utmost boundry) which was shrouded in colors, indescribable. Then I was admitted into Paradise where I found small (tents or) walls (made) of pearls and its earth was of musk.\"\n\nSahih Bukhari 4.55.657\n\nNarrated By Abu Huraira : Allah's Apostle said, \"By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, surely (Jesus,) the son of Mary will soon descend amongst you and will judge mankind justly (as a Just Ruler); he will break the Cross and kill the pigs and there will be no Jizya (i.e. taxation taken from non Muslims). Money will be in abundance so that nobody will accept it, and a single prostration to Allah (in prayer) will be better than the whole world and whatever is in it.\" Abu Huraira added \"If you wish, you can recite (this verse of the Holy Book): 'And there is none Of the people of the Scriptures (Jews and Christians) But must believe in him (i.e Jesus as an Apostle of Allah and a human being) Before his death. And on the Day of Judgment He will be a witness Against them.\" (4.159) (See Fateh Al Bari, Page 302 Vol 7)\n\nSahih Bukhari Volume 4.55.658\n\nNarrated By Abu Huraira : Allah's Apostle said \"How will you be when the son of Mary (i.e. Jesus) descends amongst you and he will judge people by the Law of the Quran and not by the law of Gospel (Fateh-ul Bari page 304 and 305 Vol 7)"
