Playside OLB steps down. Runyan(+2) hits him, allowing Bredeson(+1) to step around. Runyan then gets a LB block. Gentry(+1) passes up the OLB and moves to the ILB he’s exchanging with. CB goes from man look to zone just before the snap and DPJ is caught off guard when he jets for the backfield. That guy goes too hard and can’t redirect. Mason(-1) might be able to find this guy and block him; he doesn’t. No problem, but when Mason gets to the second level DPJ is already blocking the safety and he doesn’t turn inside to find a guy. DPJ(+0.5) does hit the S and allow Higdon(+1) to run to the edge for a nice gain; a little better job there and Higdon might beat the angle for six. M33 1 10 Shotgun 2-back TE 2 1 2 4-3 under 7.5 Pass Waggle FB flat Mason 15 Playside LB attacks and the mesh here gets him to head upfield—advantage of running this from the gun. Patterson pops outside and hits a wide open Mason(+2). Mason hurdles(!) a guy at about six yards and runs through another tackle. (CA, 3, protection N/A, RPS +1) M48 1 10 Shotgun 2-back TE 2 1 2 Base 3-4 7 Run Zone stretch Higdon 1 MD blitzes two LBs inside the playside DE and DT, with that DE widening out. Ruiz(+1) passes up the NT as he slants away and gets one LB. Runyan(-2) can’t manage the same. He’s got Bredeson behind him but doesn’t know that; he stops and turns and both LG and LT are spending themselves on one LB. Higdon’s able to clear this to the outside as Gentry does just enough to give Higdon a lane. Higdon does have to bend. Mason(+0.5) kicks a safety who walked down. Higdon has one gap to attack and the weakside LB meets him in it. Almost had it. M49 2 9 Shotgun trips TE 1 1 3 Base 3-4 6.5 Pass Hitch Perry 6 Obvious zone for MD, quick hit between two LBs. This throw takes Perry off his feet and would normally be an MA , but it does so because Perry took a step away from the LB and Patterson’s throwing it to where Perry stopped, minus the step. I think this is more Perry than Patterson. (CA, 2, protection 2/2) O45 3 3 Shotgun trips TE 1 1 3 Base 3-4 7 Run Inside zone Higdon 0 Patterson(-2) has to pull this and does not. Backside end crashes and TFLs. JBB(+1) and Ruiz(+1) both took and moved their guys, FWIW. Drive Notes: Punt, 0-0, 12 min 1st Q. Ln Dn Ds O Form RB TE WR D Form Box Type Play Player Yards M20 1 10 Shotgun empty 2 1 2 4-3 under 7 Pass Hitch Gentry 15 M motions from an I-form. This results in a lot of movement from MD and a terrible blitz where a LB starts well after the snap. Patterson looks off Gentry and then immediately comes to him and fires. He’s able to turn up for a chunk play. (CA, 3, protection 1/1, RPS +1) M35 1 10 Pistol 2TE 1 2 2 Base 3-4 7 Pass Out and up DPJ Inc Press coverage from MD; with Gentry absorbing the S to DPJ’s side he’s one on one. DPJ(route-) doesn’t sell his double move well and CB does a great job to dominate the route and get a PBU. Ball is more or less on point but there’s no window. Could have checked down; I don’t mind Patterson taking the shot. (MA, 0, protection 2/2) M35 2 10 Shotgun trips TE 1 1 3 4-3 even 7 Pass Throwaway N/A Inc Pocket is solid but everyone on the trips side is blanketed. Patterson breaks the pocket to the other side, starts motioning people around, and throws it OOB when nobody is open. Usually I TA these throws but literally nobody is available. (MA, 0, protection 2/2) M35 3 10 Shotgun trips 1 1 3 3-2 dime 5 Pass In Perry 12 Perry and Gentry stacked in the slot; Gentry runs a seam and Perry (route +) feints out and cuts back in just as Gentry clears the area. Patterson finds it and hits it. Throw is a bit in front of Perry, necessitating an out-of-frame catch, but does not hold up his momentum or prevent him from converting. (CA, 2, protection 1/1) M47 1 10 Ace 1 2 2 Base 3-4 7 Run Inside zone Higdon 3 Ruiz(+1) and Onwenu(+1) blow out the NT as Onwenu climbs to a LB. Runyan(-0.5) and Bredeson(-0.5) get some drive but get split by their guy; Higdon’s cutting behind the other double anyway. JBB(-1) loses against Cowart, giving ground and getting controlled; Cowart comes off to tackle. 50 2 7 Pistol twins twin TE 1 2 2 4-3 even 7 Run Down G Higdon 4 (Pen +5) MD jumps. Not relevant to the play. M runs a down G after a couple of stretches and is again one block from a thing; Runyan(-1) loses against a guy shaded inside of him. He steps inside on the start and Maryland DE stands him up and discards. Otherwise this was a nice gain. Ruiz, McKeon, and Gentry(+0.5) all find second level folks and at least harass; Bredeson kicks an OLB who mostly kicks himself. Higdon hits the gap but that DE tackles. O45 2 2 Pistol 2TE 1 2 2 4-3 over 7 Run Down G Higdon 12 The other way this time. Playside OLB is lined up as a standup DE and chases McKeon as McKeon releases. Onwenu has no one to hit and MD has no edge. McKeon(+0.5) gets a bit grabby but doesn’t get called (refs +1); nothing else is really relevant. JBB(+0.5) does a solid job on a not that relevant block on the DE, I guess. RPS +2. O33 1 10 Ace 1 2 2 4-3 under 7.5 Run Inside zone Higdon 4 Similar theme. NT slants to Ruiz(+1), who engages and fires him back. Onwenu(+1) picks it up too, hammering that guy. He’s three yards downfield; Ruiz gets out to a linebacker. Higdon’s running at the left side; Bredeson(-0.5) doesn’t offer much help against Cowart and Runyan(-1) is again controlled and discarded for Cowart to tackle as the back passes. Interior blowout provides M some yards. JBB(-0.5) didn’t provide much of a cutback lane. O29 2 6 Shotgun 3-wide 1 1 3 4-3 even 6.5 Pass PA waggle TE flat Gentry Inc Batted down at the line as MD blitzes right into this. Mesh point doesn’t help this time. (BA, 0, protection N/A, RPS -1) O29 3 6 Shotgun trips 1 1 3 Nickel even 6 Pass TE out McKeon 5 McKeon has a pretty good shot of getting the first down here as the DB on him has to run around Gentry first; Patterson wings it high. McKeon is able to bring it in and impressively keeps his feet; he’s stumbling and falls a yard short. (MA, 2, protection 1/1) O24 4 1 Offset I Big 2 2 1 Goal line 10 Run FB dive Mason 0 I have to assume this is a screwup but it’s also a bad playcall to offset Mason behind the weakside of the line and then give it to him. Runyan(-2) inexplicably blocks down on no one. DE outside of him slants in, no real chance for Gentry. Mason has to cut behind into no one. RPS -1. Drive Notes: Turnover on downs, 0-0, 4 min 1st Q. Ln Dn Ds O Form RB TE WR D Form Box Type Play Player Yards M45 1 10 I-Form Big 2 2 1 Base 3-4 7.5 Pass PA TE Y cross Gentry 31 Excellent example of what PA can buy you when you time it right, as MD’s rushers are all run focused and Patterson has forever. That’s required as Gentry is running from one hash to the other numbers on a 20-yard route; FB flat, DPJ deep, and McKeon on a seam run off the zone defenders. Gentry’s wide open and hit. (CA, 3, protection 2/2, RPS +2) O24 1 10 Shotgun 2-back TE 2 1 2 4-3 even SAM 7 Run Split zone Higdon 3 MD CB blitz; things get mucked. Runyan(+0.5) and Bredeson(+0.5) both get slanters across their face and handle them, can’t do much to prevent them from getting their gaps. Mason heads backside; Higdon cuts back there as the DL demands. Mason’s able to get a LB but the CB forces Higdon into him anyway. RPS -1. O21 2 7 Ace 3TE 1 3 1 4-4 over 8 Pass Waggle throwaway N/A Inc Patterson has absolutely nothing as the flat is covered and there are no other routes. I think Gentry gets jammed out of existence by a LB who may or may not be trying to do this. Martin’s offscreen, dunno what’s going on with him. Patterson dumps, it, another throwaway that I’m not filing in the negative bin (MA, 0, protection N/A, RPS -2) O21 3 7 Shotgun trips bunch tight 1 2 2 Nickel even 6 Pass TE out McKeon 5 Exactly the same thing they ran on third and six on the previous drive. Maryland does better, unsurprisingly. McKeon is the obvious read, is hit, tackled. I don’t get this. (CA, 3, protection 1/1 RPS -1) Drive Notes: FG(34), 3-0, 1 min 1st Q. Kick return TD, offense back out. Ln Dn Ds O Form RB TE WR D Form Box Type Play Player Yards M27 1 10 Pistol 2TE 1 2 2 Base 3-4 7 Run Down G Higdon 2 Cowart shades inside Runyan(-1) and steps inside; he’s able to redirect out and win that, stalemating Runyan and then ripping to the play. Bredeson(-0.5) gets an eh kick that he falls off as the defender tries to get back to the play; safety is coming down hard and doesn’t have to guess where Higdon will be. M29 2 8 Shotgun empty 1 1 3 Dime even 5 Pass Improv Gentry INT Time for a second and then Bredeson(-2) gets ripped through. Patterson’s able to scramble out past this. He takes a shot at Gentry, who’s covered. He puts it in the #buttzone. DB makes a play, deflection, second DB peeling back gets a gift. I don’t mind this throw at all. Make plays. (CA, 1, protection 0/2) Drive Notes: Interception, 3-7, EO1Q Ln Dn Ds O Form RB TE WR D Form Box Type Play Player Yards M5 1 10 Ace trip TE 1 3 1 4-3 under 7 Run Inside zone Mason 6 Three TEs in a bunch to the right. DL spread. Ruiz(+2) points out the overhang LB creeping and then understands the implications in a way I love. NT rips across his face. Ruiz knows this is coming and blasts the guy yards downfield and out of the picture. LB barely able to scrape over this but it’s a huge gap that Mason(+0.5) hits and gets some YAC on. M11 2 4 Shotgun 2-back 2 0 3 4-3 even 8 Run Down C Higdon 3 Runyan(+1) steps around and seals a vertical DE; Ruiz(+1) is able to scrape around this smoothly and get to his man. LB is hammering for the gap on the snap so this is pretty decent. Wangler(+0.5) gets a decent kick. Higdon goes as N/S as possible on this run and ends up running into pursuit; that’s fine. Close to more. M defused a weird blitz pretty well here. M14 3 1 I-Form Big Twin TE 2 2 1 Goal line 9 Run Down G Higdon 6 Down G to the right with both TEs over there. Onwenu(+0.5) gets a kick on a feinting OLB. JBB(+1) wins against DT. McKeon(+1) and Gentry(+1) both stand up their guys. Gentry’s guy is Cowart! That’s all she wrote for a first down. M20 1 10 Shotgun trips TE 1 1 3 Base 3-4 6.5 Run Inside zone Higdon 3 Not a lot of movement either way. JBB(-0.5) gets shed a bit; stays attached and shoves. Higdon(-0.5) doesn’t cut behind this and instead runs directly into the DL, with some shoving getting 3. Bit of a tough cut but gotta try it. M23 2 7 Ace 1 2 2 Base 3-4 7 Pass PA post Collins 51 This is Mills, a play Spurrier made famous, with a post behind a dig. Deep S sucks up on the dig, post is there. Patterson holds this ball a bit too long and leaves it short; this ball is still in the air for almost 60 yards. Collins is able to adjust and bring it in despite being interfered with. (CA, 2, protection 3/3). Patterson had ages here. Almost too much time. O26 1 10 Shotgun 2TE 1 2 2 4-3 under 7 Pass Reverse pass McKeon 12 McKeon is wiiiide open and this is a TD if Perry doesn’t leave it way short. McKeon does a good job to dig it out. (not charted, 2, protection N/A, RPS +3) O14 1 10 I-Form Big Twin Te 2 2 1 4-4 under 8 Run Down G Higdon 5 McKeon(+1) and Gentry(+1) seal their guys in; Bredeson(+0.5) with the short kick. MD flowing to this hard so no chance for Ruiz to get a second level block. Mason(+1) finds a LB and hits him. Higdon decides to cut into this since there’s an unblocked overhang guy; Mason basically shoves both guys three yards downfield. O9 2 5 I-Form Big 2 2 1 4-4 under 8 Run Down G Higdon 4 Same play to the other side of the line. Gentry(+0.5) does a pretty good job to seal in the DE but loses him as the back passes; McKeon(+1) seals the playside LB with authority. Onwenu is able to mirror an OLB who threatens inside before becoming the force; Mason(+0.5) gets a piece of the playside S. Ruiz again w no chance, can’t even get out this time. Higdon’s spun down just short. O5 3 1 Ace trip TE 1 3 1 4-4 under 8 Run Dive Higdon 4 Not an IZ, just a play on which Onwenu(+1) and JBB(+1) obliterate a DT and Higdon runs up their backs. O1 1 G Goal line 2 2 1 Goal line 11 Run Down G Higdon 0 Gentry(+1) fires in a DE. McKeon(-0.5) gets to a LB but kind of catches him; he’s at risk of a hold(refs +1) and doesn’t move a LB. Mason(-1) appears to trip on his way through the hole; he falls and MD does a nice job to hit and stop Higdon. O1 2 G Ace trip TE 1 3 1 Goal line 10 Run Dive Mason 1 Same deal with Onwenu(+0.5) and JBB(+0.5) moving their guy in to the endzone; Ruiz(-1) helps there, unnecessarily, allowing a LB through the gap.

Gentry(+1) hits and moves a linebacker out of the lane. Ruiz(+0.5) is able to harass a LB this time; to do that he has to brush by the NT and that guy can flow. He’s able to shut down the distance and tackle. M43 2 3 Ace 1 2 2 4-3 under 7 Run Inside zone Higdon 2 CB blitz mucks with M assumptions. Ruiz(-0.5) takes too long to hit a DT and can't fully get out on a charging LB. He does get a thwack in to stall LB’s momentum. Gentry surprised by the OLB dipping inside but that’s more RPS than anything. JBB(+1) and Onwenu(+1) again blow out a DT to create the space. Higdon(+0.5) is able to run up their backs to near the first down. RPS –1. M45 3 1 Ace trip TE 1 3 1 4-3 under 7 Run Dive Mason 2 LB runs up to prevent the double on that poor DL. No motion as JBB(-1) falls down after an initial push and it’s one on one. Mason(+0.5) is able to cut to open space between Onwenu(+0.5) and Ruiz(+0.5) who are fending dudes off adequately. Slightly uncomfortable conversion. M47 1 10 Shotgun empty twin TE 1 2 2 Weak 3-4 7 Pass TE out Gentry 6 Good coverage by MD but ball is right in the spot it has to be.

Guy cannot disconnect largely because Bredeson(-0.5) gets away with a shoulder-pad hold(refs +1). NT slants between Ruiz(-0.5) and Onwenu; neither of them can get off the LOS. LB is free to scrape and gets to the rather large gap the Bredeson encounter created. Wilson is able to grind out a yard after contact. Runyan(+0.5) did hit a LB to prevent him from doing anything, although the end of that block gets squirrelly as well.

Split zone; JBB(-1) doesn’t get depth or control his man; Ruiz(+0.5) and Onwenu(+0.5) eject the NT with a double that sees Onwenu get a LB but Mason(+0.5) has to cut away from this as Cowart sheds JBB to the inside. Wangler(+1) is able to pop a LB and create the gap. O41 1 10 Ace tight 1 2 2 4-3 even SAM 7.5 Run PA TE screen Gentry 6 Four rushers all gone; ton of space and no pursuit. Runyan(+1) gets a good cut block on a LB; looks like M is three on two on the edge with the other two OL and DPJ. Gentry(-3) inexplicably runs away from his dudes. Run with your dudes! The strength of the screen is the pack! RPS +2. O35 2 4 Shotgun trips TE 1 1 3 4-3 even 7 Pass Fake flash seam DPJ Inc M fakes the flash screen and breaks DPJ open deeper. Like the earlier Perry play this looks like a missed connection between WR and QB based on what QB expects. Here I think DPJ is probably right because Perry’s got a wheel route behind him and post/wheel is a classic combination.

O29 1 10 Shotgun 3-wide 1 1 3 4-3 even 7 Pass Fade DPJ Inc DPJ wins over the top just by running by his guy and has a step and a few yards to the outside. Patterson just misses by a hair wide. DPJ makes a tough basket catch but jumps and can’t get a foot down. Someone tell these guys to stop jumping near the sideline unless they absolutely have to.

Gentry(+0.5) gets a block and another LB is lost as he’s in coverage. Onwenu(+0.5) gets a kick. Good gap for Higdon. Michigan should obviously call a TO but instead take their sweet ass time, wasting 13 seconds before the next snap.

PA, eons of time for Patterson. Max pro against a three man rush will do that. Patterson checks down to Higdon(+2), who dodges a tackle to turn five yards into a big play. DPJ(-2) blocks in the back and then gets hammered; targeting means the penalties offset, bizarrely. I feel bad for this MD player, who is chasing Higdon and reacts instinctively when DPJ presents himself. I don’t think he even saw him until just before the collision.

M inverts their usual thing here with a TE on the LOS and Perry tucked behind. No presnap motion but blocking is same as jet so jet. Gentry(-0.5) is game on the edge but gives up ground on initial contact and Perry(+1) has to bend. He threatens inside to gets Gentry’s guy to rip there, then bounces back out, then dips inside a DT pursuing from the inside. JBB(+1) got an extended downfield block to help.

Ruiz gets out, LB buries himself in backside of line, he looks for more work, can’t really find any. MD safety starting at 6 yards is unblocked and tackles.

O34 3 1 I-Form Big 2 2 1 4-4 under 8.5 Run Power O Higdon 2 Runyan(+1) and Bredeson(+1) shove playside DT well downfield and catch a LB in their wake. Onwenu(-2) has a bad pull that doesn’t get tight enough to this block and ends up overrunning the hole and the LB; Mason(+1) kicks Cowart. Higdon(+0.5) is able to burrow under the tackler to convert. O32 1 10 Shotgun 2-back TE 2 1 2 Base 3-4 7 Run Down G Wilson -2 I don’t really know what to do with this one; Ruiz gives the brush to the NT and moves on. This is as planned; Ruiz has done this all year. This time the NT is able to rip through it and blow up the play for a TFL. Ruiz meanwhile releases downfield into already blocked guys. I guess Ruiz -1, RPS -1, Onwenu -1 for releasing to a not useful guy instead of harassing the NT. McKeon(+1) got a good edge block on a guy Runyan had engaged. O34 2 12 Shotgun empty TE 1 2 2 Nickel over 6 Pass Improv DPJ 34 MD gets a free blitzer as the standup end backs out and two LBs head to the bubble in the line. Free run for a LB; Patterson shakes him by going to the field and then spinning the other way. DPJ is wide open on a little crossing route. Patterson hits him, and then the dam breaks as the downfield blocking looks like a screen, perfectly executed. Gentry(+1), Eubanks(+1), and Wilson(+1) all block guys and DPJ is gone.

O23 1 10 Ace twin TE 2 1 2 4-3 under 7 Run Split zone Wilson 0 Runyan(-2) runs outside Cowart and lets him in the backfield free; Cowart tackles. Play otherwise decently blocked with Onwenu(+1) moving a guy out of the gap; JBB(+0.5) does enough to let the back through minus Cowart.

O23 2 10 Shotgun 2-back 2 0 3 Nickel even 6.5 Run Split zone Wilson 3 Onwenu(+1) again moves his guy down the line a fair distance, nice gap; Wangler(+0.5) gets a kickout. Ruiz(-1) spends too long hitting a DT who is not likely to be relevant if this play cuts back, allowing LB through. He gets off at the last second and slows him up a bit but if he’s able to stall him this goes to the safety; JBB(+0.5) sticks with a DB trying to get around him decently. O20 3 7 Shotgun 4-wide 1 1 3 Exotic 6 Pass Dumpoff Wilson 5 + 8 Pen M has some trouble with a stunt. JBB(-1) doesn’t realize he’s got nobody outside and should help on Onwenu’s guy; he’s able to get through. Michigan's picked up the rest of it well enough to get Patterson a lane; Ruiz gets a gold star for putting the other stunter on the ground. Patterson scrambles and hits his dumpoff option. Wilson is a yard short but tackled by his facemask. Also Maryland called for holding on Martin.

Drive Notes: Touchdown(2PT), 35-14, 6 min 4th Q. Final snaps are M running out the clock.\n\nI DON'T KNOW HOW TO FEEL\n\nFair enough. I complained in the game column about a couple of fancy plays emerging from the garage for no reason because this game was never in doubt; two of those plays were in the first half when Michigan was either losing or up three points. I also didn't really know how to feel about this game. (He is still slightly peeved about the RPO in the fourth quarter.)\n\nIn this situation let's check the drive chart:\n\nTouchdown drives of 95, 81, 64, and 43 yards.\n\nFour more drives of about 40 yards in length, two of which end in short FGs. A third is a punt; the last is a turnover on downs.\n\nAn interception after two plays.\n\nWell, heck.\n\nThat's... very good?\n\nIt is. The wobbly feelings come because of yet another slow start. Slow-ish, anyway. At least in this game Michigan was moving the ball a bunch instead going three and out like the Northwestern game. But BPONE rather loomed when Michigan opened up with the punt, turnover on downs, and INT on three of their first four drives. From there it went TD, TD, FG, TD, TD.\n\nIn contrast to the Northwestern game, which felt short but was about average length in terms of possessions, this was a short game. Nine drives provides relatively fewer opportunities to put up whiz-bang buckets of yards. If there were 11, as there were in the Northwestern game, Michigan probably adds another 100 yards of offense and this game looks like the dominating performance it (mostly) was.\n\nDoes this mean anything?\n\nI don't really know. As mentioned in the game preview, Maryland's D looks like it's taken a significant step forward this year. It's still not great—currently 57th on S&P+. But it's worth noting that fancystats think this is an absolute hammering. MD's D checked in with a 15% percentile performance, by far their worst of the year. Maryland did play Texas. Texas was significantly worse on offense than Michigan was against Maryland.\n\nAnd we did get to see some developments we were hoping for.\n\nSuch as?\n\nShea Patterson confidently zinging the ball into pockets in a zone:\n\nHe comes off a WR to find Gentry there and the ball is out so fast it would be a surprise if that was not Patterson's intent from the beginning of the play. The quick, decisive throw allows Gentry to turn a five yard hitch into a 15-yard chunk. There's a similar look-off, bang feel to other Gentry catches:\n\nMore generally, Patterson had an excellent bounce-back game after a Northwestern outing that was gritty but middling— especially if you are just focusing on the throwing:\n\nSHEA PATTERSON\n\nGood Neutral Bad Ovr Game DO CA SCR PR MA BA TA IN BR DSR PFF Notre Dame 2+ 18(4)+ 1 5 1 1(1) 2 2 1* 77% - WMU 3++ 9(2)++ 2 1 1 2 77% - SMU 3+ 9(1)+ 3 1 2 1 2* 74% - Nebraska 2 11(2)+ 1 2 1 79% - Northwestern 2 12(2)+ 3 1 3 3* 4 68% - Maryland 3 17(1) 1 1 4 1 1 1 87% -\n\nThat's a nice chart. A very nice chart. There were some borderline MA/CA or MA/IN throws so YMMV a little. If you wanted to move the McKeon throw that should have been a first down but was high into the IN category I wouldn't yell at you. That doesn't change the overall picture much: a hamblasting.\n\nPatterson went over 10 YPA by dodging blitzers...\n\n...and threading various needles. This could have been bad, but instead it was good:\n\nRight in stride for a TD, rescuing a rather baffling time management sequence. If the safety doesn't slip is that a disaster? Maybe! But also maybe not. Patterson's best throw was another somewhat awkward body position that didn't matter; here he is throwing off his back foot and hits DPJ perfectly:\n\nThat kind of stuff is why Patterson is the #1 QB in the Big Ten on deep balls, per PFF.\n\nMichigan even broke out an RPO for him:\n\nThat's well covered but it's also a safety one on one with Gentry with no LB level intervening. Patterson puts it in exactly the right spot; there are many other situations that Michigan could run similar plays and find them far more open. It's a little weird they haven't incorporated more of these into the offense—the only person this really changes anything for is the QB, and Patterson just came from an offense with a heavy dose of RPO.\n\nErrors were relatively few and benign. Patterson had a couple wobbles that seemed more like communication/expectation issues than inaccurate balls. On an early hitch to Perry he throws it right where Perry is; Perry is taking a step away from the zone LB and has to leave his feet to catch the pass.\n\nI thought that was more Perry than Patterson since he doesn't have to drift away from the LB; on the other hand that's probably good policy whenever you hitch up against a zone. Something to work on, but miscommunication rather than an errant throw.\n\nThe miss to DPJ was similar. DPJ starts to drift inside on his route; Patterson throws it as if he's going to continue straight up the field.\n\nI did assign that one to Patterson since post/wheel is a classic route combination and fly/wheel is not; I'd expect DPJ to move to the middle of the field. Also that's a high hard fastball. It is also an expectations conflict between WR and QB. Must polish.\n\nA couple other throws were a wee bit off. One was benign, as Grant Perry was able to snag a ball a bit in front of him and still get the first down. The other was less so, as Sean McKeon has an easy first down here if Patterson allows him to catch and turn upfield:\n\nThe failed fourth and one was the next play.\n\nThe interception I don't mind at all. He finds his TE, throws it up high, and Maryland makes a play:\n\nBrian Griese's inner Lloyd Carr was on display for most of this broadcast, but I am unswayed! Take that shot every time, especially when you are dealing in all other respects. This was a quarterback performance that's going to win a lot of games.\n\nThe other major thing?\n\nThe other thing that jumped out was another week where Patterson was rarely under pressure. TEAM gathered a plurality of the protection minuses; as mentioned in the game column that's where I prefer they cluster since it's relatively easy to fix protection decisions, last year notwithstanding. When your tackles are the Black Knight biting at opponent's knees that's harder to fix.\n\nLike the Northwestern game this does come with some caveats: early-down play action was extremely effective at converting edge rushers into run defenders and Maryland didn't blitz a ton. But Patterson was more comfortable sitting and waiting for things to develop. He in fact waited too long on the shot to Collins, because nobody was getting home. Another chunk play was a crossing route to Gentry that took a long-ass time to pop open:\n\nThe only tackle minus went to Bushell-Beatty, and that was for not recognizing a stunt rather than getting whooped up on.\n\nThis has a distinct aura of \"too good to be true,\" but Maryland has a legit edge rusher and it's getting easier to believe that Notre Dame was a crazy outlier instead of the truth. Wisconsin won't actually be the final exam they would normally be—they're 115th in sack rate and have just one from a DL/OLB. That's from their planet NT Olive Sagapolu.\n\nSo that's the OL settled then.\n\nMostly? Maybe? But not entirely.

Runyan gets a tough matchup and comes in slightly negative; I have a weird lack of numbers for Bredeson; the Big Big Boys all come in with numbers that are highly encouraging.\n\nRunyan is not an offense destroying black-hole but this is the second straight week he's been a bit of an issue on the ground. He was erratic with his decisions on the ground—see the stretch section below—and had some difficulties against Cowart. Here Cowart's able to control and shed him:\n\n#75 LT\n\nThat was fairly consistent. Cowart is a former five-star and looked impressive; I'd bet he's an upper-echelon Big Ten player. Runyan's come a long way since Notre Dame but probably isn't an upper-echelon Big Ten player. I would expect similar struggles when he runs across Cowart-level players.\n\nOn the other hand, Gentry is usually in the right spot and doesn't do a whole lot of moving people but he did win decisively against Cowart once:\n\n#83 inline TE second from top\n\nThat takes second place in the \"most unlikely block of the day\" category, behind Tru Wilson.\n\nI thought you said they couldn't make the whole plane out of Down G? Seemed like there was a lot of it again.\n\nMore than last week, yes. Less than against Nebraska. Michigan is doing the Harbaugh thing where they diversify their ground game over the course of the season. This week's innovation was an honest to God stretch play on the first snap, and it worked:\n\n#75 LT Runyan seals first level defender, passes off, gets LB\n\nMichigan hasn't been able to run a stretch since David Molk was here. This one isn't an old RR style stretch, or at least it doesn't work out quite like one. Those usually got chunks when the C was able to reach block a guy. Here Michigan plays on the expectation of Down G and is able to beat a corner blitz.\n\nMichigan ran that a few times early, then mixed in some inside zone, and then down G came back out, to both sides of the line. Once Michigan had established a couple other things they were able to go back to Down G fairly heavily: Michigan's first TD drive featured four down G plays that went for 6, 5, 4, and 0 yards. (The last one was from the one.) They also mixed in some other stuff, including what for lack of real terminology I'm calling \"down C\"—same thing, pull the C to kick out—and \"down T\"—twin TEs block down, T pulls for kickout, C leads through the hole.\n\nThey are barely running power. One of just two instances in this game was a third and one conversion that worked out but looked real hairy as Onwenu overran the gap:\n\n#50 RG pulling\n\nMichigan continues to run plays in weird directions, IMO. Instead of having Onwenu grind a DL into dust and pulling the more agile Bredeson around, this goes to the left. Maybe opponents are overplaying the Big Big Boys.\n\nSo we can run a stretch now?\n\nWellllll... I wouldn't say they're great at it. A few plays later they ran another and a gap exchange to the front side got Michigan blocking all the wrong guys. Runyan hit and kept going on the first play. Here he hits and stops, which means there's nobody trying to harass the LB who eventually makes the play:\n\nHe's got Bredeson back there but doesn't trust that fact, which is a symptom of unfamiliarity with one of the most rep-dependent plays in football. I'm not sure how effective they can be with it. We'll see. Ruiz is uncommonly agile for a center and could get some things done.\n\nRuiz is grading out pretty well these days.\n\nHe is, and he did a thing I very much enjoyed in this game. You may have heard me complain about knowing the implications of certain defensive alignments, and reacting based on those implications. This usually means that there's an almost-certain blitzer out there who implies a DL slant away from the blitz. Notre Dame was able to get some stops by bringing a linebacker down in an area with no eligible WRs; I felt like someone should be able to see that and read the implied slant.\n\nWell, here's a Maryland linebacker creeping down, and Cesar Ruiz pointing it out:\n\n#51 C\n\nThen he goes and whoops the NT he knows is going to slant to him, creating a giant gap for Mason. That guy doesn't know what hit him.\n\nRuiz did have an error or two; I'm not sure what to do with this Down G on which he brushes by a guy who will TFL:\n\nThat looks bad. It's also something Ruiz has been doing all year.\n\nPresumably that's as intended, but better opponents who have seen this approach before can exploit it. On this play in particular it seemed like Michigan had the blocks even if Ruiz took a more conservative approach and just locked this guy out after successfully reaching him. I split the damage there between Ruiz and RPS.\n\nBlips were rare and plays on which it looked like Michigan was completely lost were nonexistent. When a run play failed it had specific causes; it was not an issue where a bad read of the D caused everything to go higgeldy-piggeldy. I don't know how much of that is Warinner and how much is Ruiz but it's certainly both of them having an impact.\n\nYou said to use Mason until they stopped it!\n\nWell, okay, hear me out—\n\nTO ANN ARBOR TORCH AND PITCHFORK!\n\nI don't know if I explicitly stated that the thing that should happen until someone figures out a way to defy physics was Mason running behind the Big Big Boys on the right. This continued to work just fine. Michigan pounded the ball in from the 5 for their first touchdown with a couple of BBB dives assisted by that 3TE formation (the zero-yard down G is between these plays):\n\n#50 RG and friends\n\nIn contrast the failed dive is veritably nude, with just Runyan and Gentry at the point of attack. Runyan's recovered from a rough start but is no Onwenu when it comes to picking large men up and throwing them in a swimming pool; Gentry is a 6'8\" TE who's game but necessarily meh as a blocker. With Mason offset behind them there's no mystery, either:\n\nThat looks broken, as Runyan is blocking down on nobody while Gentry tries to deal with the DE. Does this work if Gentry and Runyan double this guy? Eh, probably.\n\nI'm still a little confused by this. If you're going to break tendencies and run it weak, why on earth offset the fullback and indicate that is your plan? I dunno. The trip TE formation worked so well because it didn't actually involve any mission-critical TE blocking. It did successfully spread the front so that it was easy for Onwenu and JBB to double team a DT into the endzone. The above is asking Gentry to do a lot, far more than the BBB dives ask of the OL.\n\nDo we have some Concerns About The Receivers?\n\nare you Todd McShay\n\nSir, I have never once suggested that a mid-tier Big Ten quarterback is a first round talent.\n\nFair enough. The announcers for this game spent a lot of time talking about how Michigan's WR corps is a sore spot. This was very much the case last year. This year... you could look at it in a few different ways. They're thin, it's true. They're young, with sophomores backed by sophomores and a freshman. And there are some issues with polish.\n\nFor the second straight week it felt like a Michigan WR gave up an important completion because he jumped for a ball that he didn't have to. Last week it was Collins on a quick out. This one is DPJ in a more difficult situation:\n\nTough over the shoulder catch but also one where extending your arms probably does what the jump does and gives you a better chance of staying on the field. Add in a few different Collins issues from last week and you could make the case.\n\nOn the other hand, they're making all the routine catches and a fair number of tougher ones. DPJ keeps scoring. Collins shook a Northwestern safety for a coulda-shoulda TD last week and brought in a tough downfield catch this week.\n\nDPJ had a 40-yard TD called back, and while this wasn't apparent on TV from the stadium it was clear that DPJ had to adjust his route to get to the ball, which he did. Not a huge thing, but DPJ does not have Stonum disease.\n\nThey're not clearly awesome but that is in large part an artifact of Michigan's offense, which is close to dead last in tempo and runs 65% of the time on standard downs. Data is still relatively thin. The catching data:\n\n[0 = uncatchable, 1 = circus catch, 2 = moderate difficulty, 3 = routine]\n\nTHIS WEEK SEASON Player 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 DPJ 0/1 0/1 2/2 2 0/2 1/2 17/17 Collins 1 1/1 0/1 4/5 8/9 Martin 2 1/3 4/4 Perry 2/2 2 0/2 2/2 6/6 Bell 2/2 1/1 2/2 McCurry 1/1 1/1 Black McKeon 2/2 1/1 1 3/3 6/7 Gentry 1 0/1 2/2 5/5 4 0/1 5/5 15/17 Eubanks 1 1/1 2/2 Mason 1/1 1/1 Evans 4/4 Higdon 1/1 3/3 Wilson 1/1 2/2 Thomas 0/1\n\nWhere's the damn hurdle?\n\nWell, okay then:\n\nIn addition to the very flashy Mason things—HELLO LINEBACKER GET ON MY BACK AND LET'S GO TO THE ENDZONE—there were a couple other items worth noting. Mason was able to shove a Higdon-defender package about four yards downfield on one important redzone carry:\n\n#42 FB\n\nAnd he displayed a little change of direction on his single carry outside of short yardage. People are uttering Toby Gerhardt's name, which is silly. But a little less silly than last week.\n\nHeroes?\n\nPatterson was dealing. Gentry was receiving many of said deals. The Big Big Boys all checked in with excellent days.\n\nMaybe not so heroic?\n\nNobody stood out as actively bad. Runyan did take a solid L on the ground, but didn't give up a pass pro minus.\n\nWhat does it mean for Wisconsin and beyond?\n\nTime to open it up. Michigan's entering a stretch of critical games against some extremely mediocre pass defenses. Mediocre pass defenses without the kind of DEs who could cause an OT reversion to form. Wisconsin: 115th in sack rate. MSU: 77th. PSU: 45th. The best efficiency D of that bunch against the pass is PSU at 47th. With Patterson hitting the groove and Gentry fully weaponized, Michigan should take their passing offense out of the garage and do... shifty things. I don't know, I'm not a car guy. This metaphor was a bad idea.\n\nOne more data point about tackle survival. Six more and we have a season.\n\nThe right side of the line will move people. Hopefully M can figure out some power/counter stuff to do with that. Keep running behind them in short yardage please.\n\nBen Mason is a dude. This is the obvious portion of our program.\n\nThrowing it to the ent is a good idea. Keep it going."
