        "text": "KONVOI only works because of our team effort and yes, obviously thats a key aspect for many organizations. To give you a little more color on what it needs to establish a #deeptech security system at a truck trailer, this Wednesday was the perfect example: For more than 2,5 years we run test systems at truck trailers on the road finding out about detail by detail what is still to improve. And even since we started only equipping by paid customer plans for almost 1 year now, for sure we keep our test systems run for our own internal purpose. Newest #roadtrip, let's collect the extra data we need 🚛 On the picture from Wednesday you can see 6 people, but you can also see Team #sensor, Team #machinelearning, Team #riskfactor, Team #software, Team #operations, Team #assembly, Team #procurement, Team #productplanning, Team #mounting, Team #marketing, Team #design. Our core is being a #data company, but enablement for the basis is huge surrounding. 🎛️ Let's keep going team KONVOI. 🚀 Which technical topics did you expect from a 6 people team at the truck? 😇\n\n💡 Remembering our first. It was Electrum. What a great client to start our journey with 🙏 – we had a lots of fun working on the campaign, and it proved what we already knew: that our methodology not only works, but can work fast. It took 43 days to hire Electrum’s outbound team, develop a playbook, integrate the sales tech stack, and book the first sales meeting. Over 6 months, the team generated $5m in sales pipeline. 📈✨ Link to the full case study in the comments. #FirstClientSuccess #ElectrumJourney #SpeedySuccess #SalesMagic #MethodologyMatters #DeltaV2024\n\nWhat would a 33% increase in successfully onboarded customers mean to your business? This is what Pleo experienced once they integrated Scrive's eID Hub into their product. Their Director of Engineering Paulo Unia had this to say: “Scrive makes my job so much easier! Having the ability to scale to a growing number of countries with one integration rather than having to work on a new integration for weeks or months for each eID is what makes me crazy about your product.” Reach out today to find out how we can help you and, in the meantime, read the full case to learn more about how we helped Pleo achieve this. #eID #IDVerification #Security #CustomerOnboarding #eSign\n\nDo you need an extra help in your customer service department? I´ve got your back! Turns out Guadalajara is becoming a hub for this area, because of its great location and amazing talent. Learn everything you need to know about this and how Wexpand can help you out in this blog: https://lnkd.in/e97STCc8 #Guadalajara #RemoteTeams\n\nNext up in our Meet the Team feature, we meet David - Our Technical Director and Co-Founder of MPX 🚀 Alongside our Ops Director, David started crafting MPX almost 10 years ago to fill the void between rigid ‘off-the-shelf’ systems that don’t quite tick all the boxes, and expensive in-house development teams. He's currently leading an exciting automation project with our awesome developers; to streamline, automate, decrease human error, reduce staffing overhead, and increase data accuracy 🎯 Hit the link below to find out more about this project, and get to know David a little more! 🔗 #meettheteam #dreamteam #customersuccess #bosssystem #erpsystem #wearempx"
