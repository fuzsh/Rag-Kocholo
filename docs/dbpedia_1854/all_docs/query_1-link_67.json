        "text": "Kurt Vonnegut was a World War II soldier and prisoner of war, peace activist, free speech champion, bestselling writer, artist, father, and lover of jazz, comedy, theater, and film. Celebrating our 15th anniversary in 2024, we at the Kurt Vonnegut Museum and Library (KVML) conduct tours of our museum’s diverse and accessible exhibitions. Members borrow books from our lending library. Students, teachers, veterans, and prisoners benefit from our programs that encourage storytelling to “make your soul grow.” From its German foundation in the 1800s, our gorgeous building is one of the few remaining buildings from the period when Indiana Avenue was known nationwide for its rich jazz history and Black excellence in business and culture. Our Bokonon Lounge is more than a bar but also a space that people use for weddings, birthday parties, and more.\n\nOutside of Indianapolis, we are widely known for our tough stance on free speech. We send hundreds, if not thousands, of free books to students around the country to support anti-censorship. As Kurt said, we want to remain “vibrant and alive and relevant” to support our local, state, national, and international audiences.\n\nBanned Books Week 2024\n\nSeptember 22-28\n\nJoin KVML for an engaging and thought-provoking 2024 Banned Books Week.\n\nKick off the week with an inspiring opening reception featuring Edith Vonnegut’s Essential Workers art exhibition on Sunday.\n\nThroughout the week, immerse yourself in discussions and performances, including a book talk on Vonnegut’s Player Piano and Jess Walter’s The Cold Millions, an opera performance of Figaro! The Bunny of Seville for young audiences, and a lecture on the intersection of censorship and discussions of nuclear war by KVML’s Activist-in-Residence Charlotte Yeung. Also, don’t miss Craig Pinkus’s intriguing lecture on banned music, and end the week with a fun Censorship Pub Quiz.\n\nIn addition, you’re invited to explore KVML’s permanent exhibits and the new “KVML: On the Avenue” exhibition celebrating Indiana Avenue’s Black history.\n\nHelp us bring Vonnegut to your state. Starting in 2022, KVML has been traveling the United States bringing programming, books, and Vonnegut’s message of free expression and common decency. Through this initiative, we hope to partner with schools and libraries as well as new and old Vonnegutians to further Kurt’s legacy. Visit our Events page to find out more about 2022 events in your state."
