His current project entails assessing the effects of electronic cigarette use on renal blood flow, renal tissue oxygenation and aortic function in healthy individuals using a novel functional magnetic resonance strategy.\n\nNoah Siegel, MD Candidate (2022-2023)\n\nBoston University\n\nProject Title: Cluster analysis of urinary tobacco biomarkers and health outcomes among U.S. adult smokers and nonsmokers\n\nNoah Siegel is a medical student at Boston University School of Medicine. He received his Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin with a minor in Studio Art in 2021. His interests include patient-provider relationship, tobacco and other substance use research with an eye towards harm reduction. His previous research involved work with novel agents for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer. His current research involves using a machine learning approach to classify data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study and examine longitudinal health outcomes.\n\nBriana Trifiro, MA PhD in Progress (2022-2023)\n\nBoston University\n\nProject Title: Association of FDA Health Warning Label Compliance in Instagram Advertisements of Synthetic Nicotine E-Liquids and E-Cigarettes with Post Engagement\n\nMs. Trifiro is a PhD student in the Division of Emerging Media Studies at Boston University’s College of Communication. She received her master’s degree in Communication from Bryant University. Her research interests focus on the intersection of political communication and media psychology, with a particular focus on the societal impacts of social media use. Through her research endeavors, Ms. Trifiro seeks to work on projects that can enact meaningful change, particularly to legislation and regulatory policies. Her current research examines how synthetic nicotine products are promoted via social media advertising and how these marketing campaigns can target and influence health behaviors among vulnerable populations, particularly youths.\n\nMuhammad Shariq Usman, MD (2022-2023)\n\nUniversity of Mississippi Medical Center\n\nProject Title: The Effect of Menthol Versus Non-Menthol Cigarettes on Urinary Volatile Organic Compounds and Cardiovascular Risk Markers in African Americans\n\nDr. Usman is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Medicine at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. He earned his MBBS from Dow University of Health Sciences in Pakistan. His research focuses on cardiovascular disease outcomes, particularly heart failure. He is interested in studying how non-traditional forms of smoking, including menthol cigarettes and vaping, are affecting cardiovascular health at a population level. Additionally, he wishes to study whether the cardiovascular effects of non-traditional smoking vary by age, sex and race.\n\nJohnathan Berlowitz, MD in progress (2021-2022)\n\nBoston University\n\nProject Title: Association of Cigarette-to-E-Cigarette Transitions with Respiratory Symptom Development and Remission: A Longitudinal Analysis of the PATH\n\nStudy, 2013-2019\n\nMr. Berlowitz is a medical student at the Boston University School of Medicine. His research interest focuses on evaluating the population-level health implications of e-cigarette use.. His recent work has involved using Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study data to model the longitudinal association between e-cigarette use and clinical cardiovascular and pulmonary outcomes. He has also examined the association of cigarette-e-cigarette transitions with respiratory symptom development and resolution.\n\nEllen Boakye, MD, MPH (2020-2022)\n\nJohns Hopkins University\n\nProject Title: The impact of E-cigarette or Vaping product use Associated Lung Injury (EVALI) and Covid-19 outbreaks on the interest in Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) and brand preference among persons in the United States\n\nDr. Boakye is a postdoctoral research fellow at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseases. She earned her MD degree from the University of Ghana Medical School.
