        "text": "Dr. Gary Alan Bass currently serves as an Assistant Professor of Surgery at the University of Pennsylvania, and as an Attending Surgeon and Intensivist at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, Pennsylvania Hospital and GrandView Hospital.\n\nDr. Bass brings a wealth of experience and academic rigor to his practice and teaching. His extensive educational background includes an MD from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, a BSc and MSc in Physiology from University College Dublin, an eMBA from Quantic School of Business, a Certificate in Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics from the University of Pennsylvania and a recent PhD in Surgical Sciences from Örebro University, Sweden. Following residency training in general surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dr Bass undertook fellowship training first in Surgical Critical Care and then Trauma and Acute Care Surgery at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nIn addition to his clinical and teaching roles, Dr. Bass is deeply involved in research and professional society leadership. At Penn, he is a Senior Scholar at the Center for Perioperative Outcomes Research and Transformation (CPORT) at the University of Pennsylvania. Nationally, he is a member of the Multicenter Trials committee of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma, member of the Adult Comprehensive Critical Care Education Committee and the Gamification Taskforce of the Society of Critical Care Medicine. His contributions to the field are recognized internationally, with roles such as Examiner for the European Board of Surgery, the inaugural Chair of the Research Committee for the European Society for Trauma and Emergency Surgery (ESTES), Honorary Fellowship of the Serbian Society of Emergency Surgery and adjunct appointment to the Institute for Global Surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.\n\nDr. Bass’s research portfolio is both diverse and impactful, focusing on improving outcomes in trauma and emergency surgery through innovative methodologies and multidisciplinary collaboration. He has authored 7 book chapters, 100 papers, and 40 invited lectures or conference presentations. His work has been cited over 4500 times (h-index = 25). His work on the snapshot audit methodology has provided a framework for prospective observational cohort studies in surgery, emphasizing the importance of real-time granular patient-level data collection and analysis. Dr. Bass has also made significant contributions to understanding the management of esophageal and colorectal cancers, with studies demonstrating the impact of emergency presentations on patient prognosis and the benefits of chemoradiotherapy in esophageal cancer. His dedication to advancing surgical science is evident in his numerous publications, which continue to influence clinical practices and policymaking on a global scale.\n\nDr. Jeremy Cannon is Professor of Surgery in the Division of Traumatology, Surgical Critical Care & Emergency Surgery. He serves as Co-Director of the Penn Acute Research Collaboration (PARC), a multi-disciplinary and multispecialty collaborative that promotes interdepartmental translational research at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center. PARC brings together Penn investigators from wide range of disciplines including Trauma, Critical Care, Emergency Medicine, Neurosurgery, Neuro-Critical Care, and Orthopedic Surgery to support urgent and emergent clinical trial patient enrollment. Dr. Cannon also serves as Surgeon Champion for the Penn Medicine-US Navy Trauma Program Partnership. In this role, Dr. Cannon applies his own battlefield experiences as a Trauma Surgeon in Iraq and Afghanistan along with his engineering background to examine three broad fields: early identification and management of hemorrhagic shock, improved management of thoracic trauma, and military-civilian trauma team collaboration.\n\nHemorrhagic Shock\n\nAs the leading cause of potentially preventable death in trauma patients, hemorrhagic shock represents an optimal condition for research innovation. Dr. Cannon leads multiple efforts addressing different aspects of this challenging problem from using machine learning and artificial intelligence to facilitate early recognition to nudge protocols to optimize patient resuscitation. Exception from informed consent (EFIC) trials conducted at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center for these patients include (1) the Trauma and PCC (TAP) trial evaluating the role of early prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) agents to improve hemostasis in these patients and (2) the Trauma Resuscitation with Group O Whole Blood or Products (TROOP) trial comparing massive transfusion protocols using whole blood vs standard component therapy protocols.\n\nThoracic Trauma\n\nAcute hemothorax (HTX) and hemo-pneumothorax (HTX-PTX) commonly occur after trauma, yet treatments for this condition remain surprisingly ineffective with a high rate of failure requiring further intervention or re-intervention. Efforts to address this challenge include quantifying the epidemiology of this problem and then addressing the most common causes for initial treatment failure.\n\nMilitary-Civilian Collaboration\n\nBattlefield trauma care strongly resembles the care we provide in our civilian trauma bay every day. Thus, we have an opportunity to provide military teams education and training to ensure those wounded in combat will benefit from the most advance care possible delivered by trauma experts. Research efforts to support this training include team resuscitation assessments using enhanced video capture.\n\nDr. Elinore Kaufman is Assistant Professor of Surgery in the Division of Traumatology, Surgical Critical Care, and Emergency Surgery. She serves as Research Director for the division, and as Medical Director for the Penn Trauma Violence Recovery Program, a hospital-based violence intervention program. She is a Senior Scholar at the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics and the Penn Injury Science Center, for which she serves as content lead for firearm injury. Dr. Kaufman holds an MD from Harvard and a Master of Science in Health Policy from the University of Pennsylvania. She completed her residency in general surgery at New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center and her fellowship in surgical critical care and trauma surgery at the University of Pennsylvania. She joined the faculty in the division of Traumatology, Surgical Critical Care, and Emergency Surgery in 2020.\n\nDr. Kaufman’s research focuses on reducing harm from injury and violence in three main ways, using qualitative, quantitative, and geospatial methods. First, with a focus on injury prevention, she studies the impact of social, structural, and policy determinants on the root causes of injury and violence. Second, advances in trauma care have yielded unprecedented survival rates. However, survivors of injury and violence are at high risk of adverse health and social outcomes. Dr. Kaufman is dedicated to improving patient experiences of acute care and their long-term outcomes through dedicated, trauma-informed care, improving access to mental healthcare, and economic interventions that address poverty as a root cause of poor outcomes. Third, Dr. Kaufman’s research focuses on leveraging acute, unscheduled care encounters to improve holistic health by connecting patients to insurance, needed medical care, and community resources. To date, her work has been supported by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency, the Fund for a Safer Future, the Civic Coalition to Save Lives, and numerous\n\ninstitutional sources.\n\nNiels D. Martin, MD, FACS, FCCM is the Chief of the Division of Traumatology, Surgical Critical Care, & Emergency Surgery at the University of Pennsylvania. He is also the Vice Chair for Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion for the Department of Surgery. He is the Program Director for the Traumatology & Surgical Critical Care Fellowships and is the Medical Director of the Trauma & Surgical Intensive Care Unit at the Penn Presbyterian Medical Center and the Organ Donor Management Center at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nHis research areas of expertise involve caring for critically injured and ill surgical patients. More specifically, he focuses on innovating clinical trials and outcomes research in clinical efficacy, quality, and safety. This focus includes trauma and surgical critical care populations with elements on end of life care, surgical futility, and organ donor management. He also had specific interest in surgical education as it relates to the training of the next generation of surgeons. In these endeavors, he has served as primary investigator in numerous clinical trials and performed extensive retrospective and prospective outcomes work. He has partnered with many collaborators including outside institutions, foundations, and industry. His work has been presented to numerous national & international organizations and published in a variety of prominent medical and surgical journals.\n\nJose Pascual is a professor of surgery and neurosurgery specialized in trauma and critical care who has a special interest in shock and head injury. His research interests are shared in translational and basic science investigation where he evaluates, through intravital microscopy, the real time microcirculation of the pia in live rodent brains after Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). He seeks to learn how a variety of insults including head injury, shock and sepsis affect the brain and systemic microcirculation and how different management strategies influence these changes. This basic science work is translated into several clinical projects both retrospective and prospective, evaluating the effects of different neuroprotective agents and strategies in multi-injured and TBI patients across the Penn SICUs, the TSICU and NeuroICUs. He serves in multiple national and international research groups seeking to improve outcomes in polytrauma and traumatic brain injured patients as well as studying the immunemodulating effects of different resuscitation fluids and management strategies in different forms of shock.\n\nJose Pascual’s research interests also include the dissemination of critical Illness management education utilizing high fidelity simulation. In the last 5 years, this has become heavily weighted out of the Simulation center and into the regular clinical hospital beds, spearheading the now monthly flash (unscheduled), bedside, in situ simulations that are lead and hosted by different groups across the health system (HUP, PPMC) across cardiac, heart & vascular, medical, neuro, trauma and surgical critical care units. Results of this education have been presented at national meetings and several published in peer reviewed journals.\n\nDr. Seamon is recognized for his clinical experience and expertise in managing critically injured patients and has combined this experience with scientific data to produce evidence based guidelines that are utilized throughout the trauma world. Dr. Seamon currently serves as the Director of Education for the Division of Traumatology, Surgical Critical Care and Emergency Surgery.
