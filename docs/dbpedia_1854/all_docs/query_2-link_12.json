        "text": "Background\n\nOn November 28, 1240, the Mongol Horde laid siege to the great City of Kiev. They breached the walls on December 6 and commenced their final assault the next day. The Mongols prevailed and subsequently plundered Kiev. They burned most of the city and massacred nearly the entire population. (Wikipedia, 2021)\n\nWritten in the late 1240’s, The Ystoria Mongalorum quos nos Tartaros appellamus (History of the Mongols, which we call Tartars) is the report compiled by Friar Giovanni Deplano Carpini, of his trip to the Mongol Empire. Friar Giovanni passed through Kiev in February 1246, and again on his return home in 1247. About Kiev, he wrote:\n\nThey [the Mongols] attacked Russia, where they made great havoc, destroying cities and fortresses and slaughtering men; and they laid siege to Kiev, the capital of Russia; after they had besieged the city for a long time, they took it and put the inhabitants to death. When we were journeying through that land we came across countless skulls and bones of dead men lying about on the ground. Kiev had been a very large and thickly populated town, but now it has been reduced almost to nothing, for there are at the present time scarce two hundred houses there and the inhabitants are kept in complete slavery.\n\n(UToronto, 2016)\n\nScholars reason that the inhabitants of Kiev feared plunder by the Mongol Horde and accordingly buried their valuable jewelry in caches, hoping to return later to retrieve them. However that was not to be, and these treasure caches called “Klads” are still being discovered and unearthed today.\n\nThe jewelry artifacts from the Kiev Klads are thus dated to no later than mid XIII century.\n\nFollowing is an image overview of\n\nPre-Mongol Arched Plate Ochelye of the Kievan Rus’\n\nOchelye (pronounced “Ah-chill-yay”); (Russian: ОЧЕ́ЛЬЕ) also spelled ochelle, ochelé, ochel’ya, ochillya, is a decorated headband that covers the forehead.\n\nMap of Unearthed Klads\n\n1827 Klad, found in the village site of Avgustinovich, Kiev.\n\nEleven gold headband arches made of smooth and ribbed wire. The treasure was kept in the Skovoroda Museum in Kharkiv and perished during World War II.\n\n1880 Klad, found at Zhitomirskaya Street, Kiev.\n\nTwo gold headband arches and one gold end-cap. The end-cap is decorated with cloisonné enamel images and has fastening loops positioned in the indented pearl tray. The treasure was kept in the Skovoroda Museum in Kharkiv and perished during World War II.\n\n1876 Klad, found at the Leskov Estate, Kiev.\n\nThirty-four gold headband arches and four end-caps. The end-caps are decorated with cloisonné enamel and have fastening loops positioned in the indented pearl tray. The one pictured below still has some pearls wired into the tray. This treasure is kept at the Museum of Historical Treasures, Kiev.\n\n1887 Klad, found in the fence of the Mikhailovsky Monastery, Kiev.\n\nTwenty-two gold headband arches and two end-caps. The end-caps are decorated with cloisonné enamel images and have fastening loops positioned in the indented pearl trays. At present, this headband is kept in an assembled state at the State Russian Museum, St. Petersburg (BK-2771).\n\n1900 Klad, found on Devich Mountain near the village Sakhnovki (Kanevsky district, Cherkasy region).\n\nEighteen gold headband arches. Kept at the Museum of Historical Treasures, Kiev, MZDM-1938.\n\nKlad, from the M.P. Botkin Collection, Kiev\n\nFourteen gold headband arches. Shown in an assembled state in the 2015 exhibition dedicated to the ancient Russian treasures. State Russian Museum, St. Petersburg\n\nUndocumented Klad, Amateur Treasure Hunter\n\nSeven gold headband arches, said by an Amateur Treasure Hunter to have been found in the forest between the swamps, 15 km from Novgorod-Seversky, Chernihiv region (destroyed by Mongols in 1239). This treasure is included here but is not documented as being from the Kiev Klads. The limited documentation about the find is questionable. The arches may have been put to auction. The storage location is unknown.\n\n1824 Klad, found near the Mikhailovsky Monastery, Kiev.\n\nEight gold headband arches decorated with large and small stones in high sockets. This treasure is lost and thought to have been stolen. The storage location is unknown.\n\n1904 Klad, found near the village of Kolesishche, Kiev.\n\nFive gold headband arches. These differ from all the others. They are small but wide, steeply curved, and differ in width. Wide arches alternate with narrower ones. Ribbed wire divides their surface into longitudinal bands filled alternately with either high ringed conical protrusions, or pearls on wires. The storage location is unknown.\n\n1997 Klad, found on the territory of the St. Michael Golden Dome monastery, Kiev\n\nNine gold headband arches decorated with amethysts and imitation filigree, each with two trays for holding pearl strands. They were found attached to a band of textile worn over the forehead. The Museum of the History of St. Michael Golden Dome Monastery.\n\nOF NOTE: Scholarly papers typically include these rare Arched Plate Ochelye along with the Ochelye made from Three-Bead Arches.\n\nPersonal interpretations of arched plate Ochelye\n\nOchelye #1 – Inspired by the 1997 Klad\n\nSeven decorated brass headband arches sewn onto a stuffed fabric headband.\n\nIn October 2018, while researching unrelated jewelry parts, I purchased the book Jewellery of Princely Kiev (Pekarska, 2011) which contained a very clear photograph of the 1997 Klad Arches. I spent a lot time imagining how these could be created and finally decided to try a mock-up. The search for materials began upon returning home from July Coronation 2019. This Headdress was completed in September 2019.\n\nMade using 3/4″ wide strips of 28 gauge brass, bent into arches against a 1.5″ wood dowel. Tubes are tightly curled at each end to run a wire for sewing. Dot textured 1.7 mm brass gallery wire (2 per side) added to create pearl trays. Tiny 1.5 mm Pearls strung on fine wire and held in place with wire loops. Down the center, three decorative 10 mm brass shank buttons along with two 10 mm carnelian cabochons in brass settings. The center arch has a tiny brass laurel wreath mounted on a silver-toned flat button head.\n\nI call my results a mock-up (to learn why, see process pics for Ochelye #3), however if everything stays together, it can be worn as-is.\n\nOchelye #2 – Loosely inspired by the 1904 Klad and upcycling\n\nSeven gold-toned metal headband arches sewn onto a stuffed fabric headband.\n\nAn Tir Merchant Sidequest Forge had a booth at Wastekeep’s Baron’s Ball in October, 2019. There was a ziplock bag on one of their tables containing eight fancy napkin rings. They reminded me of the ornateness of the arches from the 1904 Klad. With a little work, I thought they could possibly make a lovely ochelye. This piece was completed in June 2020.\n\nThe Arches started out as round napkin rings. The rings appear to be made from pot metal with some type of gold-tone finish. The ornament resembles hearts that when placed upside-down become the sacred symbol of the Rus’ Seed. Approximately 2/5ths of each ring was removed (sawed out) to create arches that did not need to be bent. (Too much bending caused the metal to break – ask me how I know). Simply, tiny 1.5 mm pearls were strung on fine brass wire and then wired to each side of each arch.\n\nThe arches are sewn to a wool-stuffed fabric half-tube. Tablet Woven Bands are attached to both ends of the half-tube to be tied together at the back of the head, completing the headband.\n\nOchelye #3 – In Progress – Inspired by the 1997 Klad\n\nProcess Pictures – Similar to Ochelye #1, using Amethyst cabochons and Larger Pearls\n\nThis project was started in February 2020 to use up the excess material from my Ochelye #1 project. I did purchase new 10 mm amethyst cabochons, more dot textured gallery wire, and larger 3.5 – 4 mm pearls. It was put aside for loss of interest, to work instead on Ochelye #2 which seemed more fun at the time. The project was picked back up in April 2021, with the goal of having progress photos for this Athenaeum exhibit.\n\nThere are many steps in the process of making things. Sometimes, when you do not have the tools, the workshop, the knowledge, and/or the skills to create as they would have done in period, you might end up using questionable methods to create a mock-up, like superglue and clothespins. I’m here to tell you it is okay to start there.\n\nReferences\n\nJewelry World. (2016, 5 7). Old Russian treasures from the collections of the Russian Museum. Exhibition at the Mikhailovsky Castle.
