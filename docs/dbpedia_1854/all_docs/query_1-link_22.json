Prior to Sakhi, Kirti provided individual and couples therapy to BIPOC and queer individuals. She strives to co-create a therapeutic space that is as non-hierarchical as possible and driven by curiosity. Kirti believes that our experiences of existing within unjust environments and systems can take a toll on us. As such, her approach to therapy is anti-oppressive and anti-racist. Kirti is passionate about working with historically marginalized groups, especially the South Asian community. Outside of work, she enjoys reading fiction novels, boxing, running, and spending time with her friends and family.\n\nPria Sibal | Housing Program Senior Manager\n\nshe/her\n\nPria joined Sakhi as a volunteer in August 2015. Pria has a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in English Literature from Delhi University. She then began a career as a journalist and documentary film producer. Starting in the nascent broadcast news industry in India in 1993, she moved on to directing travelogues and documentaries based on human interest stories. Her experience as a journalist with leading Indian broadcasters gave her an analytical scope. Her love for research and desire to make a social impact gave her that extra push to make documentaries. Pria believes every career professional reaches a point where they desire unconventional returns from a job and had the desire to create value in society in her own modest capacity. As part of the Sakhi team, she is committed to empowering women as she feels no woman should be in a situation where she feels inadequate or helpless.\n\nSiddhi Vora | Advocate, Housing Justice Program\n\nshe/her\n\nSiddhi has had experience working in Kutch on issues such as gender justice and racial discrimination among the marginalised. Born in India and raised in Kentucky, Siddhi is committed to community care, advocacy, and social justice. In university, she studied Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies alongside History and South Asian Studies. Her one-year research stint in the coastal city of Mumbai, India and the district of Kutch in Gujarat, India gave her an opportunity to engage with the marginalised community fighting injustice. She’s excited to move to New York City and join Sakhi’s Housing Justice Program! Siddhi is fluent in Kutchi and Hindi. In her free time, Siddhi loves to learn new skills and pick up new hobbies along the way – whether it’s rollerskating, stained glass cutting, or experimenting with natural dyeing. In her free time, she can be found reading, playing cards with friends and family, learning more about deserts and seas, or forcing her loved ones to indulge her and participate in her weekly self-published crosswords. Her ideal way to relax is by taking a long walk, specifically at twilight, or practicing playing her tabla.\n\nJason Yoon | Grants Manager\n\nhe/him\n\nJason joined Sakhi in January 2019.

A native New Yorker and child of Korean immigrants, Jason is excited to support Sakhi’s important work."
