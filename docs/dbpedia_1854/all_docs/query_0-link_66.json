        "text": "She decided to study this course because she wanted to grow personally, professionally and develop her skillset as a practitioner.\n\n“I wanted to get a degree in early years and I was looking for a course that would allow working full-time whilst in full-time education. I needed a course with mature students because it would be more relatable to my situation, and I was not feeling confident enough because of the 10-year gap in education.”\n\nWhile Khush was working in an early-years setting, a few of the staff members were studying the early years course at UWTSD, and after some research she thought it would be beneficial to study this course too as it suited her needs perfectly.\n\nKhush said that this course was the best thing that happened to her as it has not only helped her professional development but also contributed towards her personal growth and self confidence. She adds:\n\n“This course is remarkably close to my heart as it allowed me to be a better version of myself. I am a single parent with no family around and I was working full-time while studying.\n\n“The best thing about this course is studying with other professionals from diverse backgrounds and having group discussions helped me to understand the world from different perspectives. It allowed me to critically evaluate my thought process and develop a better understanding of the world. It encouraged me to think critically why we think certain ways, how our personalities are shaped by our early childhood experiences.”\n\nKhush said that the department was understanding, supportive and encouraging. As a mature student, the lecturers support and encouragement kept her going through challenging time.\n\n“During this course I felt like we all are a part of a family learning from each other. I could not thank enough to the lecturers for believing in me when I could not believe in myself and pushing me through.”\n\n“As a student from an Asian origin and after being schooled abroad, I never felt that I was indifferent to anyone throughout the course - I felt more included, heard and appreciated for sharing my experiences.”\n\nShe really want to thank her lecturer Jessica Pitman as her support and encouragement throughout her learning journey has led her to where she is now.\n\nIn terms of employability, Khush said that the BA in Early Years Education and Care degree opens up the doors of countless job opportunities in public and private sector and after enrolling on the course, she has worked in nurseries, residential childcare and at the moment she is working as a Parenting Practitioner in a local Council.\n\nWhilst studying this course Khush had developed a specific interest in how personalities develop and the effects it has due to Adverse Childhood Experiences that led to mental health and psychology. Presently, she is studying a Masters in Mental Health Psychology to train to be a Cognitive Behaviour Therapist.\n\nUWTSD Early Years Lecturer Jessica Pitman said:\n\n“I have been very proud to be Khush’s year tutor through her journey in UWTSD. Khush came to us with determination to be the best person she can be, and with an interest in early years and working closely with families.\n\n“ Watching students develop as a person and an academic is the best part of my job. It is always part of our practice to honour the student and their life experiences and responsibilities outside of study. I know our lecturers make a concerted effort to understand each student’s motivations and their difficulties in their journey. I am so very grateful to have been part of it with you Khush.”\n\nKhush would recommend anyone who wishes to enrol on this course to do so as it does not matter if you have a gap in education, lack of experience or if you are a single parent discussing your circumstances and concern with lecturers – they will provide courage and support as\n\n“We are all very different in our circumstances, appearance, and beliefs but this course is a place that brings a sense of belonging.”"
