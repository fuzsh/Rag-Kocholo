Show portfolio with or without a lightbox, in the free version of the portfolio you have a bootstrap lightbox with navigation.\n\nyou can also show title with images and the title will also appear with bootstrap lightbox in the bottom. If you don’t want lightbox you can also link your portfolio for an external project.\n\nThe default layout of the portfolio is the masonry layout. If you want to use the grid layout you can use the same size image for the portfolio. then you can show your portfolio with grid layout also.\n\nShow your portfolio gallery with a border or you can show your portfolio without spacing or with spacing.\n\n📱 DEFINING MASONRY LAYOUT IN PORTFOLIO\n\nThe term Masonry layout probably owes its name to the popular jQuery Masonry plugin that is used to generate this type of layout.\n\nMasonry layout is also referred to as the Pinterest Style Layout, as www.pinterest.com was the first major website to use this layout style. Masonry layout gives a great look of your portfolio gallery\n\nThe plugins listed contain unique features in addition to the common feature set. It is difficult to understand the difference between each plugin just by looking at a Masonry layout generated by each one. All of the layouts will appear quite similar. It is important to consider the available features before choosing a plugin. Generally, most plugins provide an API and documentation for identifying their features.\n\nI suggest looking at the available features of each plugin before making your choice. I have compiled the following list of common features from the plugins listed in the previous section. These are some of the main features, but each plugin also has its own unique ones. It’s up to you to choose the best plugin based on your application requirements.\n\nMasonry layouts can have fixed-size columns or dynamic columns. Fixed-size columns are the norm. It is better to choose a plugin that allows dynamic columns, as it enhances flexibility.\n\nSorting and Filtering – Plugins like Isotope allow you to sort and filter the elements without losing the structure of the layout. It is a good feature to have when you need dynamic Masonry layouts.\n\nAnimation – Unlike normal layouts, Masonry layouts change completely with the addition or removal of elements. Because of this, it is better to have animation effects for adjusting elements – this creates an awesome user experience.\n\nDynamic Elements – Generally, we create the layout on page load using the available elements. But some sites might require the ability to add or remove elements without refreshing. In such cases, the plugin should have the ability to auto adjust the layout to provide the optimal structure.\n\nLayout Options – The plugin should allow you to set column width, gutter size, alignment, etc.\n\nDevelopers and designers are accustomed to seeing web pages laid out with CSS floats. But this common type of layout doesn’t take the size of the elements into consideration. Instead, it adds elements one after another, first in the horizontal direction, then vertically.\n\n(PORTFOLIO ) CUSTOM CSS OPTION\n\nCustom CSS is part of Custom Design, which is a feature of the WordPress.com Premium and WordPress.com Business plans. … CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a markup language that controls the appearance of HTML elements on a web page.\n\n(PORTFOLIO ) LINK OPTION\n\nLink portfolio by giving a link on separate images\n\nFAST CUSTOMER SUPPORT\n\nLow response time\n\nWe always try to respond within hours or within a day.\n\nResolving an issue within 24 hours.\n\nGENERAL Features\n\nPortfolio Filtration\n\nSparate page of portfolio filters\n\nCreate filters\n\nEdit filters\n\nDelete filters\n\nBootstrap Lightbox\n\nOnclick lightbox on the gallery\n\nNavigation with the portfolio\n\nDisplay title with the gallery\n\nMultiple Column Layout\n\nShow in 2, 3 column layout with portfolio\n\nManage space of the gallery\n\nResponsive Portfolio\n\nShow portfolio gallery with responsive mode\n\nShow gallery with desktop and mobile with center align\n\nTitle On Portfolio\n\nShow title on gallery in a unique way\n\nTitle with background color option on the gallery\n\nShow discription with gallery no limit\n\nShow read more link option\n\nEase Of Customization\n\nCreate your portfolio with the easiest way on the WordPress\n\nCreate filters on a separate page\n\nChoose filters with your images of portfolio\n\nFilter images according to the category\n\nMasonry Portfolio Gallery\n\nMasonry layouts are a great choice for creating galleries\n\nShow your portfolio with an uneven height of images\n\nManage sccording to window size\n\nLink Option\n\nLink your portfolio with external page or site\n\nYou can link your portfolio gallery with separate image\n\nOption for open link into same tab or new tab\n\nVideo Option\n\nShow your work or portfolio with images and videos\n\nShow portfolio gallery with vemio or youtube videos\n\nYoutube icon on hover\n\nVemio icon on hover\n\nClose button availabe\n\nEsc close option\n\nPro Features In Detail\n\nUnlimited Filters\n\nCreate unlimited filter and category in the premium version, the plugin has a unique separate category page for creating the filters so you don’t need to use WordPress categories.\n\nusers will really like the ease of use the plugin.
