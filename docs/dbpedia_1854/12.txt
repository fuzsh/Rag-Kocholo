High Noon Talks are back and better than ever! Get ready to discover interesting and often untold stories of Texas at our classic, casual lunchtime talk series.

Join Bullock Curator Lisa Sharik for an introduction to two important WWII military initiatives: the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron and the Womenâ€™s Airforce Service Pilots. This talk will offer a brief history of these two programs that saw women piloting military aircraft and contributing to the war effort. It will also highlight the stories of some of the Texas women who participated in the programs.
