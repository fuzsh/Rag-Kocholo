        "text": "Although the majority of social insect colonies are headed by a single queen, some species possess nests that contain numerous reproductive queens (polygyny), a trait that is particularly widespread amongst the ants. Polygyny is often associated with a lack of conspecific inter-nest aggression between workers. This is hypothesised to result from increased nestmate cue diversity within nests, since polygynous nests are more genetically diverse than monogynous nests. Alternatively, it may reflect the common origin of polygynous nests that form polydomous networks. We exploit the recent discovery that the nestmate discrimination system in the ant Formica exsecta is based on cuticular hydrocarbons to investigate cue (Z9-alkenes) diversity in several monogynous and polygynous populations. Contrary to previous predictions, in all polygynous populations, the variation between nests in the Z9-alkene profiles was reduced relative to that found in monogynous populations. However, nest-specific Z9-alkene profiles with little variation amongst nestmate workers were still maintained irrespective of nest type or population. This suggests a very effective gestalt mechanism that homogenises the chemical discrimination cues, despite genetic diversity within colonies. Although the reduction in variation between nests was associated with reduced worker aggression on the population level, it cannot totally explain the weak aggression associated with polygynous populations.\n\nThere is accumulating evidence that genetic diversity improves the behavioral performance and consequently the fitness in groups of social animals. We examined the behavioral performance of colonies of two co-occurring, congeneric harvester ant species (Messor arenarius and a non-described Messor sp.) in fitness-related behaviors, pertaining to foraging performance, nest maintenance, and aggression. We linked these behaviors to the colonial genetic diversity, by genotyping workers, using six and five microsatellite markers for M. arenarius and M. sp., respectively. Correlations of genetic diversity with colony performance and aggression level contrasted between the two species. In M. arenarius, genetic diversity was correlated with foraging performance and nest maintenance but not with the overall aggression level, while in M. sp., genetic diversity was correlated with the overall aggression level, but not with foraging performance or nest maintenance. The two species exhibited similar specific aggression levels, with higher aggression shown towards heterospecifics and lower towards non-nestmate conspecifics and nestmates. However, M. sp. workers displayed a tendency to interact for longer with heterospecifics than did M. arenarius. We speculate that the different foraging strategies, group vs. individual foraging, and possibly also the different mating systems, contribute to the differences found in behavior between the two species. There has been a growing interest in recent years in the effect of within-population diversity on performance. Elevated population diversity enables specialization and exploitation of a broader range of resources and reduces intraspecific competition 1,2. Similarly, groups of related individuals often benefit from within-group diversity, because heterogeneous groups possess a larger pool of skills, which better conduce to contending with fluctuating conditions than those of homogenous groups 3. Such benefits can be reflected in improved survival, foraging, and parental care compared to more homogenous groups 4–6 (but see 7,8 for a more complex effect). In social insects, the effect of within-colony diversity on colony efficiency has been studied mostly in hon-eybees. Genetic diversity in honeybees contributes to the colony efficiency in performing important tasks, such as nursing and removing carcasses 9,10. This higher efficiency has led to elevated productivity 11 and enhanced survival 9,10,12–15. The mechanism behind this could be that of diversification of the workers' response thresholds and optimizing task allocation according to colony needs 16–18. More diverse social insect colonies also forage more efficiently: some ant colonies forage over a longer part of the day 19 , and honey bee colonies exchange more recruitment signals 14,20 and collect more pollen 21. Genetic or phenotypic diversity in ants has been positively correlated with colony growth, success in various tasks, and parasite resistance 22–25. Colony diversity may also positively affect nest maintenance activities, such as nest reconstruction in ants (as implied in 26,27) and temperature regulation in bee colonies 28,29. Similarly, in colonies in which queens mate more than once, some studies have shown a link between patrilines and tendencies to perform specific tasks, plausibly resulting in a more efficient division of labor 26,27,30,31. Nevertheless, the positive link between within-colony diversity and colony performance is not a general rule and other studies have found no such correlation 32–34 ."
