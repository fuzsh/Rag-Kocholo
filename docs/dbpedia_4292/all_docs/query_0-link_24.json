        "text": "Identification & Distribution\n\nAdult apterae of Nippolachnus piri (see first picture below) have the head yellowish-green, the pronotum green, and rest of thorax light green with green longitudinal stripes on the margin. The abdomen is light green with green longitudinal marginal stripes, green spinal patches on abdominal tergites I, IV, and V, and green cross-bars on tergites VI-VII. Antennae are pale to light green with a light brown terminal process. Fore and middle legs are pale green with dusky tibiae, hind legs have greenish femora, light brown tibiae and dark tarsi (cf. Indolachnus himalayensis & Pyrolachnus piri, which have the legs mainly dark). Antennae are 0.26-0.42 times body length, with the terminal process 0.41-0.54 times base of antennal segment VI. Antennal segments IV and V each have 0-1 secondary rhinaria. Longest hairs on antennal segment III are 4.07-7.50 times basal diameter of that segment. Apical rostral segment is 0.70-0.86 (1.0) times second hind tarsal segment. The abdomen is pale membranous. Siphunculi are low, delicate, and unpigmented, set on hardly visible sclerites and with rather large rounded pores. Genital and anal plates are very poorly sclerotized, unpigmented, and hardly visible. The cauda is rounded. Body length is 2.3-3.7 mm. Immature Nippolachnus piri have the head orange yellow with similar dark green markings to the adult aptera.\n\nNote: Nippolachnus piri, Nippolachnus micromeli (= Neonippolachnus betulae) and Nippolachnus xitianmushanus are a group of similar species, for some time synonymized as Nippolachnus piri. Kanturski et al. (2018) & Kanturski et al. (2024) demonstrated 'Nippolachnus piri' is not polyphagous and widely distributed but is at least 3 distinct species: (A) 'Nippolachnus piri' on Sorbus and Rhaphiolepis should be treated as Nippolachnus micromeli; (B) 'Nippolachnus piri' on Pyrus and Eriobotrya japonica correspond to Nippolachnus piri; (C) a unique haplotype (H6) on Eriobotrya japonica in China, (Genbank accession number JX035029.) which showed 8.1-8.5% and 6.7-7.6% of genetic divergence to groups A & B respectively; (D) Nippolachnus xitianmushanus, a morphologically distinct species, only recorded from Eriobotrya japonica. (Presumably C and D are the same.)\n\nImages above copyright Kanturski et al. (2024) under a creative common licence.\n\nThe alate vivipara of Nippolachnus piri has the head and thorax reddish-brown. The freshly moulted alate (see second picture above) has the abdomen light yellow-green with darker patches in the central and marginal part, and is without wax; the mature alate (see third picture above) has the abdomen yellow-brown with sclerotized dark patches and white wax patches. Antennae are 0.28-0.33 times body length, with the terminal process 0.42-0.50 times body length. There are 8-11 secondary rhinaria on antennal segment III, 2-3 on segment IV and 1-2 on segment V. The apical rostral segment is 0.70-0.90 times the second hind tarsal segment, with 18-20 accessory hairs. The media vein is once-branched. Abdominal tergite I has a spino-pleural cross-band and small marginal sclerites, tergites II and III have pleural and marginal sclerites and some very small scleroites, tergite IV has marginal sclerites more or less fused with siphuncular sclerites and large sclerotic spino-pleural cross-band, tergite V has the proximal part with spino-pleural cross-band fused with the previous one, tergites VI and VII are without sclerites, and tergite VIII has a cross-band.\n\nThe clarified slide mounts below are of adult viviparous female Nippolachnus piri : wingless, and winged.\n\nImages above copyright Kanturski et al. (2018) under a creative common licence.\n\nNippolachnus piri feeds on both loquat (Eriobotrya) and pear (Pyrus spp.), both in the Malinae. It appears (see below) that this is a case of host alternation, with Eriobotrya as the primary host and Pyrus as the secondary host. Ant attendance has been observed on the primary host (by Camponotus japonicus and Pristmyrmex punctatus), and on the secondary host (by Formica japonica). Recent work suggests the species is restricted to Japan, the Korean peninsula, Taiwan, and Laos, and possibly the Russian Far East.\n\nBiology & Ecology\n\nLife cycle\n\nRecent studies by Yamamoto et al. (2020) showed at least one member of the Lachninae host alternates between two woody hosts, which also appears to be the case for Nippolachnus piri. Kanturski et al. (2024) found three colonies of Nippolachnus piri in mid-May on the undersides of leaves of Eriobotrya japonica. Each colony had one fundatrix, alate viviparous female adults, and nymphs; however, apterous viviparous females were not observed, so it was inferred that the second generations likely consisted entirely of alate viviparous females for host plant migration. From mid-May, alate viviparous females moved to another species of host plant and began forming colonies on Pyrus pyrifolia, with apterous outnumbering alate viviparous females at a ratio of 9 to 1. At the turn of summer and autumn in September, colonies of alatoid nymphs and alate viviparous females were observed on Pyrus. In November, alate viviparous females returned to the primary host where they produced males and oviparae. After mating these laid eggs in a row with consistent spacing, on the undersides of leaves near the main vein of the host plant, which then overwintered."
