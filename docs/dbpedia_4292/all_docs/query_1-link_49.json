        "meta_description": "As one of the most abundant and complex groups of terrestrial insects, ants have associations with many other organismal groups, such as hemipteran insects producing honeydew. With the aim of expanding the knowledge base of ant species associated with aphids, this study analyzed mitochondrial COI barcodes of 301 ant samples for 37 aphid-associated ant species in a subtropical area of southern China. Sequence analyses revealed that the intraspecific and interspecific distances ranged from zero to 7.7%% and 0.2 to 31.7%, respectively. Three barcoding approaches – Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery, Bayesian Poisson Tree Processes and Generalized Mixed Yule-coalescent – were used to help delimit ant species based on COI sequences, and their results corresponded well with most of the morphospecies. All three approaches indicate cryptic diversity may exist within Tetramorium bicarinatum and Technomyrmex albipes, with intraspecific genetic distances of 7.7% and 6.24%, respectively. Our analyses also reported five species for the first time from Fujian Province of China, and the COI sequences of nine species are newly added into the GenBank. This study provides information about species diversity of aphid-associated ants in subtropical China and compiles a DNA barcode reference library for future ant barcoding work.",

        "text": "Relationships between various organisms are crucial for upholding the ecological function of natural communities. The interactions between ants and aphids are classic examples of mutualism and are important to support ecosystem function (Fischer et al. 2015). The aphids have positive interactions with ants, which can play important role in their survival rate. The ant-aphid associations even have a great impact on local insect faunal diversity (Billick et al. 2007), especially dominant ants. They even determine the structure of the local ant community by interfering with the foraging of other ants (Carval et al. 2016). These interactions are very diverse and complex in nature. For a better understanding of their complex interactions, it is very important to know the species diversity of each part of this association. Ants are the part that collect honeydew of aphids and protect them from natural enemies (Stadler and Dixon 2005). The diversity of ants is highest in tropical regions, while aphids are supposed to be most diverse in temperate regions (Hölldobler and Wilson 1990, Heie 1994). As transition zones where the two groups encounter one another, subtropical regions may have an elevated diversity of ant-aphid associations. However, there have been no published studies focusing on diversity of both partners in this association. In this work, we tried to explore the diversity of aphid-associated ants in the subtropical Fujian in southern China.\n\nAnts (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) are a dominant terrestrial insect group. They have colonized almost the entire world except Antarctica, especially in the tropical regions (Rizali et al. 2008). There are 17 subfamilies having about 13,500 described species worldwide (Bolton 2018). This group of insects has been present on Earth for about 120 Mya (Brady 2003). Ants play essential roles in seed dispersal (Hanzawa et al. 1988). Many grass species in fire-prone graze lands mainly depend on ants for their survival (Fisher et al. 2003). Also, they are efficient biocontrol agents and improve soil aeration as well (Hölldobler and Wilson 1990). For example, the predatory Asian weaver ants are the most efficient biocontrol agents of certain field crops and predatory ants of genus Oecophylla can control 50 different species of pests species feeding on eight tropical trees (Peng and Christian 2009, Offenberg 2014). Due to the obligatory interactions between ants, plants and other animals, the diversity of ants usually is a good indicator of the strength of ecosystems (Alonso and Agosti 2000).\n\nBiological classification based on morphological characters has been a routine practice to identify biodiversity on the Earth. Nowadays, biodiversity quantification is a challenge for taxonomist if only based on morphological identification. The recognition of minute anatomical differences between closely related species sometimes is complicated morphologically (Ojha et al. 2014). Ants usually have different castes with apparent variations in their body structure within the same species, which makes them more diverse and challenging to identify. To overcome these problems, DNA barcoding has been shown to be a reliable technique for rapid and accurate species identification (Hebert et al. 2003a, Savolainen et al. 2005). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been extensively used in molecular studies. A partial fragment of cytochrome c oxidase I gene (COI) is employed for easy identification of closely related or cryptic animal species along with biological diversity assessment (Hebert et al. 2004, Ojha et al. 2014). The utility of DNA barcoding as a rapid and accurate tool for species identification is well recognized in a wide variety of animal taxa across the globe (http://www.ibol.org/resources/). DNA barcoding techniques have been used by some researchers in ant identification and phylogenetic analysis (Smith et al. 2005, Jansen et al. 2009, Ng’endo et al. 2013, Smith et al. 2013, Ojha et al. 2014, Chen and Zhou 2017). However, to our knowledge, little is known about the regional fauna of aphid-associated ants especially in subtropical areas.\n\nThe present study aimed to investigate the subtropical ant fauna associated with aphids with the help of DNA barcoding. Both the morphological and DNA barcoding approaches were used and results were compared. Our study provides information of species composition and species diversity of ants in a subtropical region, and a DNA library for future ant barcoding work.\n\nAnts are eusocial insects having the high degree of caste polymorphism with various distinct anatomical characters and size variations (Wheeler 1986, Mysore et al. 2009, Wills et al. 2018). The complexity of ant groups usually makes them difficult to identify to species only based on morphological characters. For example, species of genus Crematogaster have been reported to be morphologically diverse and having cryptic species with high genetic intraspecific variation (Blaimer 2012). There are few studies that combine morphological identification with DNA barcode analysis for ants (Ng’endo et al. 2013, Kanturski et al. 2018). However, various barcoding approaches of species delimitation can be more suitable and useful in describing ant species diversity (Smith et al. 2005, Ojha et al. 2014). Our paper may be the first study of a regional fauna of aphid-associated ants to use a combined species delimitation approach.\n\nMost of the morphospecies identified were supported by DNA barcoding approaches. According to the Guénard and Dunn (2012) Fujian Province has 184 ant species and this study added five new ant species (F. sinae, N. flaviabdominis, P. emmae, C. egidyi and P. smythiesii) to the provincial ant fauna. Moreover, COI sequences of nine species (C. nicobarensis, C. vitiosus, A. smythiesii, C. egidyi, C. osakensis, M. chinense, N. flaviabdominis P. fervida and P. smythiesii) were newly added into the GenBank and BOLD databases. Geographically, we also found highest species diversity in the Wuyishan Nature Reserve with 21 species. This is related to the fact that the Wuyishan Nature Reserve has the highest habit heterogeneity compared to the other three geographic areas (Ding et al. 2015).\n\nIn the present study, three ant species (P. punctatus, C. egidyi and P. noda) were found associated with a maximum number of aphid species on various host plants (Suppl. material 1: Table S1). All of them belong to the subfamily Myrmicinae. The parthenogenetic ant species P. punctatus is known as seed harvester ants; they are abundantly present in forests and natural vegetation (Satow et al. 2013; Zhu and Wang 2018). They have the ability to fuse their colony into neighbouring colonies of same species (Satow et al. 2013), which may make them more abundant. In a previous study P. punctatus was found to be the most dominant ant in natural grassland in Japan (Suetsugu 2015). In the current study this species is mainly found in natural vegetation in Shouning and Wuyishan Nature Reserve interacting with 17 aphid species. Due to their high abundance, this species was found as the most dominant aphid-associated ant in our study areas. Crematogaster egidyi is known as an aggressive predatory arboreal ant species (Longino 2003). They are considered to be strong and aggressive towards other dominant ant species and compete for food and space (Richard et al. 2001). In the current study C. egidyi was found associated with 16 species of aphids. In our sampling sites this species was also found dominant and aggressive towards other ant foragers, which may influence the local ant diversity. Pheidole noda is a seed dispersal ant species mostly found in the open lands and forest vegetation (Yamawo et al. 2012) and mainly distributed in the east Asian countries (Sarnat et al. 2015).It has been found abundant from Iwo-jima island of Japan (Ikudome and Yamane 2007) and also reported from rainforest of Yuanan, China (Liu et al. 2015). In the current study, P. noda was also found abundantly associated with 12 aphid species on various host plants in the Wuyishan Nature Reserve and mountainous areas of Shouning. It was observed that these three species associated with the most aphids, mainly found in natural habitats, and therefore may influence other aphid-associated ant species.\n\nSpecies delineation and identification on the basis of DNA sequence distance analysis, like the DNA barcoding gap (Hebert et al. 2003b, Hebert et al. 2004) and other related methodologies (Ferri et al. 2009), have been used repeatedly to develop effective standards for species delimitation. Genetic distance-based methods are regularly being used in DNA barcoding studies of various groups to indicate the possible incidence of cryptic species diversity among morphologically similar species (Lefébure et al. 2006), including termites (Roy et al. 2014), butterflies (Ashfaq et al. 2013) and snails (Prévot et al. 2013). Genetic divergence of ant species was previously calculated by different researchers on the basis of COI gene sequences, but they focused on ant groups solely (Ng’endo 2011, Ojha et al. 2014). Actually, the interactions between ants and other insect groups, for example aphids, are critical to regional community function. Considering that morphologically similar ant species may occur in a same area and sometimes co-occur with same aphid species, molecular identification is helpful to understand the regional diversity of aphid-associated ants. In this study, we observed that several morphospecies produced multiple MOTUs using the different barcoding methods; also, the MOTUs were separated in the phylogenetic tree analysis (Figs 2–4, Suppl. material 4: Figure S2). The ABGD, bPTP and GMYC methods all supported T. albipes and T. bicarinatum as each having two clear MOTUs. These two species showed higher mean (>3.34%) as well as maximum (>6.24%) intraspecific genetic distances. The GMYC method revealed five more species with multiple MOTUs: P. punctatus, N. flavipes, P. noda, T. caespitum and C. egidyi. The maximum intraspecific distances were 5.84%, 2.19%, 2.01%, 2.01% and 1.51% respectively; however, the mean intraspecific genetic distances were all below 1.55%, which is lower than the practical criterion for insect species delimitation (Foottit et al. 2008). This may be the reason that the ABGD and bPTP methods found them each to be a single MOTUs.\n\nThe comparative performance of different algorithms to species delineation has been studied previously. ABGD considered as the most computationally effective approach. It needs a priori specification of an intraspecific distance threshold, and this method is based on the genetic distances calculated from a single locus (Puillandre et al. 2012). Empirical studies have revealed that the GMYC approach tends to over-split species compared to alternative methods of species delimitation (Esselstyn et al. 2012, Paz and Crawford 2012, Sauer and Hausdorf 2012, Talavera et al. 2013). Other studies indicate that the ABGD and bPTP may be better strategies and that these encounter less computing errors than GMYC (Puillandre et al. 2012, Luo et al. 2018). Our study also showed GMYC delimited more MOTUs. However, considering GMYC combines the Yule model of species birth with neutral coalescent model of intraspecific branching, its results may also have implications for understanding population divergence for some species. For example, previous studies reported diverse cryptic species within the T. caespitum complex (Wagner et al. 2018). In this study, the individuals of T. caespitum were grouped into two MOTUs by GMYC, and the maximum intraspecific genetic distance was 2.0%, which may also indicate possible differentiation within this species.\n\nThe ML and BI phylogenetic analysis produced almost same topologies on the basis of the COI sequences and produced two discrete clades. One clade included two putative sister clades representing the subfamilies Myrmicinae and Formicinae (Figs 3, 4). It has been thought that the two subfamilies evolved from a common ancestor (Brady et al. 2006, LaPolla et al. 2010, Ward et al. 2015). Moreover, a second cluster comprised species of subfamily Dolichoderinae. The grouping of the six genera presented in this study was similar to that reported by Chiotis et al. (2000), but our DNA sequence data alone provide insufficient support to comment on relationships among the ant subfamilies. Leaving aside the assemblages supported by lower posterior probability values, on the basis of the sole barcode sequence data set, the three subfamilies (Dolichoderinae, Formicinae, and Myrmicinae) mostly appear as monophyletic. The overall topology of phylogenetic trees corresponds well with most results of ABGD, bPTP and GMYC species delimitation approaches. For the new MOTUs we found beyond the known morphospecies further DNA diagnostics based on more sampling and morphological work are needed to verify whether they can be well-defined species."
