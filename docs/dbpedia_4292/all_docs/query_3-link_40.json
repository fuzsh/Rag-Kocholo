        "text": "Formica\n\nThe endemic Nearctic Formica pallidefulva group of the genus Formica is a conspicuous group in pine flatwoods forests in northern Florida. Four of the 5 species in the pallidefulva group (F.archboldi, F. dolosa, F. pallidefulva, and F. sp. nov) occur in this region. Only the three known to host P. lucidus in this area: F. archboldi, F. dolosa, and F. pallidefulva (Figure 2) are discussed here. All three Formica species can typically be found at any given area in the Apalachicola National Forest. Nests of different species may be found as close as ∼ 2 m to one another, however, nests of the same species have never been found closer than ∼ 5 m to one another and are often much farther apart (JRK personal observation).\n\nTable 1.\n\nBody size (Weber's length in mm) and colony size for Polyergus lucidus and 3 host Formica species in Florida. Weber's lengths for Formica species are averages ± SD (JCT, unpublished data) while values for Polyergus are averages ± SD from this study. For Polyergus species, the Weber's length values in parentheses are for queens. Colony sizes for Formica are averages ± SD from this study (3 colonies each). Colony sizes for Polyergus are totals (1 colony) and include the number of Polyergus and Formica hosts (in parentheses).\n\nAcross northern Florida F. dolosa (Figure 2B) and F. pallidefulva (Figure 2C) were more abundant than F. archboldi (Figure 2A) and occur in a greater variety of upland ecosystems (JRK unpublished data). Formica archboldi was less common; restricted to pine flatwoods and sandhill in the region. Formica dolosa was the most abundant species among these species in the Apalachicola National Forest; locally often more than twice as common as F. archboldi, on average (Figure 3). Formica dolosa also had the largest average mature colony size (Table 1) and the largest worker body size (Table 1), although all species were slightly variable in size.\n\nNests of all Formica species were typically found at the base of vegetation. The nests were only visible from less than 3 m distance as they were often obscured by vegetation. The nests of F. archboldi were often the most difficult to locate because, in addition to their relative rarity, they were frequently at the base of wiregrass clumps that obscure excavated soil. The nest architecture of all three Formica species was variable within species, in the number of shafts, depth, and number of chambers (all of these features are also probably related to colony size: larger colonies tend to dig deeper nests, excavate a larger volume of soil, and have more shafts and chambers). There were, however, distinctive features common to each species. The nests of F. dolosa were the most obviously different from the other two species (Figure 4B). Specifically, there were often two or more nest entrances, the shafts tended to diverge from the central entrance, and the shafts tended to be much larger in diameter. The nests of F. archboldi (Figure 4A) and F. pallidefulva (Figure 4C) tended to have only one or two shafts that converged on the center of the vertical plane of their nests. Additionally, the shafts of their nests tended to be more obviously distinct, and smaller, than the chambers. Colonies were found to move after disturbance, including after raids by Polyergus colonies (Trager and Johnson 1985).\n\nAll of the Formica colonies collected for this study began to produce brood in March, even under laboratory conditions. Sexuals were produced by mature (non-incipient) colonies in the first round of brood. No mating flights were observed in the field. Under laboratory conditions, up to ten females and an equal or greater number of males were produced in the first round of brood. More sexual brood are produced by large, healthy colonies under natural conditions (JCT personal observation). One incipient colony of F. dolosa (8 minim workers) and one of F. pallidefulva (6 minim workers) were also collected in April 2007. These colonies produced only worker brood (like many temperate species, colonies do not produce sexuals in their first year). All of the colonies collected for this study were monogyne, although there are records of polygyny for F. archboldi elsewhere in Florida (Trager and Johnson 1985). Queens of F. archboldi (Figure 2A) and F. pallidefulva (Figure 2C) tend to be much larger than workers. However, F. dolosa queens are variable in size throughout their range. The F. dolosa queens collected for this study were only slightly larger than workers (Figure 2B).\n\nWithin laboratory nests, queens and brood were located centrally and attended by a circle of up to twenty workers (Figure 2). Under laboratory conditions the queens of all three species laid eggs at a rate of approximately 1 per hour. Younger workers, including callow workers, tended to be in close proximity to the queen and brood while older workers tended to be located at the periphery of the nest near the entrance or foraging, suggesting that a temporal worker caste system is operating for these species. Workers in queenless colonies of F. dolosa had functional ovaries and produced male offspring. Queenless colonies of F. archboldi and F. pallidefulva did not produce any brood in this study.\n\nWorkers of all three species forage solitarily (Figure 5A-C), although they recruited up to several nestmates for larger food items or to honeydew-excreting hemipterans and nectaries that are close to the nest (Robson and Traniello 1998; JRK personal observation). These species were predaceous and were active scavengers as well, often found carrying dead insects back to their nest (Trager and Johnson 1985; JRK personal observation). All three species have also been observed actively tending membracids, aphids, and scales, most commonly on flowering palmetto (S. repens) and sapling pines (P. palustris) in the spring. Formica archboldi is probably a specialized predator and scavenger of the ponerine Odontomachus brunneus (Patton) (Trager and Johnson 1985), showing preference for this species over other ants and arthropods in field and laboratory trials (A.A. Smith and JRK, unpublished data). All species were diurnal foragers and were tolerant of high temperatures, often the only species found foraging at the height of the day (noon-3 pm) during the summer months (JRK personal observation). However the peak period of foraging was during morning (7 am-10 am) and evening (4 pm-6 pm) during the spring and summer. During the winter (∼ November – February) colonies (including foraging workers) are almost entirely inactive. A characteristic of both of these genera of formicines, including the species at the southern range limit in Florida, is that colonies overwintered in a relatively inactive state, without brood.\n\nPolyergus\n\nTo avoid confusion and unnecessary repetition, throughout this section the subspecific names assigned to P. lucidus by Trager et al. in press are used. These names are useful because each subspecies is associated with enslaved hosts as follows: (1) P. lucidus undescribed with F. archboldi, P. lucidus longicornis with F. dolosa, and (3) P. lucidus montivagus with F. pallidefulva (Figures 2 and 5). The use of the subspecific variant names of P. lucidus should not be construed as a formal taxonomic change.\n\nThe P. lucidus undescribed colony and the P. lucidus montivagus colonies were collected with their hosts in February, 2006 less than 4 m from each other. Both of these colonies were collected in an overwintering state. That is, they were almost entirely inactive and devoid of brood. The P. lucidus longicornis colony was collected with its host in June, 2004 in a similar pine flatwoods habitat about 2 km east of the site where the other colonies were collected. Colonies and individuals of P. lucidus were similar in size to the average size of their respective hosts (Table 1). In all of these colonies, P. lucidus workers made up 12–20% of the number of workers (Table 1).\n\nThe P. lucidus undescribed and the P. lucidus montivagus colonies began to produce brood by March 2006, even under laboratory conditions. Sexuals were produced in the first round of brood by both colonies and consisted of 1 female and 7 males (P. lucidus undescribed, Figure 6) and 6 males (P. lucidus montivagus) that emerged as adults in May. The P. lucidus longicornis colony had 4 females and 18 males when it was collected in 2004 and 3 more females and 20 males emerged over the next month in the laboratory. No mating flights were observed. Queens of all 3 species were larger than the largest Formica workers in their respective colonies (Table 1, Figure 7) and P. lucidus longicornis was the largest queen, although the P. lucidus queens were all smaller than their Formica queen counterparts, except P. lucidus longicornis which was similar in size to the F. dolosa queens in the Apalachicola National Forest. This pattern was similar in the workers and P. lucidus longicornis (Figure 5E) was the largest of all the species (Table 1). The P. lucidus workers were mildly polymorphic and tended to be either similar in size or slightly larger than their Formica hosts (Table 1, Figure 5).\n\nLike Formica colonies, within laboratory nests, queens and brood were located centrally and attended by a circle of up to twenty workers (Figure 7). Under laboratory conditions the queens of all three species laid eggs at a rate of approximately 1 per hour, however there were frequently gaps of up to 3 hours where eggs were not laid. Also like Formica, younger Polyergus workers, including callow workers, tend to be nearer to the queen and brood while older workers tend to be located at the periphery of the nest near the entrance or outside the nest, suggesting that a temporal worker caste system was operating for these colonies similar to that documented previously (Kwait and Topoff 1984). However, no Polyergus workers were ever within the circle of Formica workers that tend to the queen, nor did they spend more than a few seconds in her immediate vicinity.\n\nTable 2.\n\nEthogram of Polyergus lucidus longicornis and host Formica dolosa workers from the same colony. Observed frequencies are followed by values in parentheses indicating the frequency of each act relative to the total number of behaviors performed by the slaver and the host.\n\nQueen dominance over Polyergus workers is obvious as they never interacted aggressively with her (Table 2). This is likely a chemical cue which may contribute to the spacing between Polyergus workers and the queen. In contrast, aggression in the form of biting, appendage pulling, and even occasionally spraying, is frequently observed between Polyergus workers and Formica workers, although the Polyergus workers are invariably the dominant individuals in the interspecies interactions (Table 2). Interestingly, Formica workers often acted aggressively toward their Polyergus queen. On two occasions (once with P. lucidus longicornis and once with P. lucidus undescribed), after several months in the laboratory the aggression of Formica workers escalated to the point that the queen was killed over the course of a few days of continuous harassment. This suggests that the chemical and behavioral cues that Polyergus queens employ to enslave their Formica hosts is, at best, imperfect and this probably contributes to the rarity of the species.\n\nObservations of worker behavioral repertoire of the P. lucidus longicornis colony revealed that other than self grooming and raiding, Polyergus workers' only other tasks were occasionally removing dead of either species and trophallaxis with host Formica (Table 2). In contrast the behavioral repertoire of the host Formica workers consisted of dozens of tasks from nest maintenance, brood care, queen care, and foraging."
