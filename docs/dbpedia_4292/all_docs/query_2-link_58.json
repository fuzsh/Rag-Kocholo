        "text": "July 9, 2024\n\nNational Institute for Environmental Studies\n\nJapanese honey bees are known to use their wings to protect their hives from intruding ants, but detailed observations of this behavior and its ecological significance have not been previously reported. Yugo Seko, Kiyohito Morii, and Yoshiko Sakamoto of the National Institute for Environmental Studies, Biodiversity Division photographed this behavior with a high-speed camera and obtained detailed recordings of Japanese honey bees rotating their bodies and flicking ants away with their wings (âwing-slapping;â Figure 1; https://youtu.be/8N2IURbwzJA (a link to an external site)). This behavior is very different from the defensive behavior previously observed among honey bees in other parts of the world, in which the bees use wind pressure from their flapping wings to force ants away. Importantly, the wing-slapping behavior observed in this study involves direct contact between honey bees and intruding ants. This new wing-slapping behavior was found to be the main method used by Japanese honey bees to defend against intruding ants. The results of this study provide important insights into the evolution of bee defensive behaviors in various regions around the world.\n\nThe results were published in the July 9, 2024 issue of Ecology, an academic journal published by the Ecological Society of America.\n\nIn this study, we showed that wing-slapping is the main behavior used by Japanese honey bees to defend against intruding ants, and developed a new hypothesis about the conditions under which this behavior might evolve. To test this hypothesis, more research is needed to identify the defensive behaviors of bees in various regions around the world in relation to the risk of predation by ants.\n\nIn addition, in recent years, many nonnative ant species have become established or even invasive in Japan, and the probability of contact between these species and Japanese honey bees is increasing each year. Eventually, there may come a time when Japanese honey bees will have to contend with nonnative ants that actively prey on adult bees. Wing-slapping is not expected to be effective against such ants because of the high risk of predation. In the future, we hope to do more to assess and predict the impacts of nonnative ants on honey bees, including from the perspective of defensive behavior.\n\nThere are many unknowns about wing-slapping, including which species in what regions perform the behavior. If you have any information about this behavior, please do not hesitate to contact us."
