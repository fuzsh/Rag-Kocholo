        "meta_description": "Social insect colonies constantly produce dead insects, which cause sanitary problems and potentially foster deadly pathogens and parasites. Hence, many social insects have evolved a variety of hygienic behaviors to remove cadavers from the colonies. To that end, they have to discriminate dead insects from live ones, where chemical cues should play important roles. In ants, bees and termites, such corpse recognition signals, also referred to as “death pheromones” or “necromones”, have been identified as fatty acids, specifically oleic acid and/or linoleic acid. Meanwhile, there has been no such report on social aphids. Here we attempted to identify the “death pheromone” of a gall-forming social aphid with second instar soldiers, Tuberaphis styraci, by making use of an artificial diet rearing system developed for this species. On the artificial diet plates, soldiers exhibited the typical cleaning behavior, pushing colony wastes with their heads continuously, against dead aphids but not against live aphids. GC-MS and GC-FID analyses revealed a remarkable increase of linoleic acid on the body surface of the dead aphids in comparison with the live aphids. When glass beads coated with either linoleic acid or body surface extract of the dead aphids were placed on the artificial diet plates, soldiers exhibited the cleaning behavior against the glass beads. A series of behavioral assays showed that (i) soldiers exhibit the cleaning behavior more frequently than non-soldiers, (ii) young soldiers perform the cleaning behavior more frequently than old soldiers, and (iii) the higher the concentration of linoleic acid is, the more active cleaning behavior is induced. Analysis of the lipids extracted from the aphids revealed that linoleic acid is mainly derived from phospholipids that constitute the cell membranes. In conclusion, we identified linoleic acid as the corpse recognition factor of the social aphid T. styraci. The commonality of the death pheromones across the divergent social insect groups (Hymenoptera, Blattodea and Hemiptera) highlights that these unsaturated fatty acids are generally produced by enzymatic autolysis of cell membranes after death and therefore amenable to utilization as a reliable signal of dead insects.",

        "text": "Insect collection, sampling, and rearing on artificial diet\n\nA total of ten galls (#1–10) of T. styraci were collected from the host tree S. obassia at Shomaru, Saitama, Japan, or Minakami, Gumma, Japan, and brought to the laboratory. The insects were collected from the galls, sorted under a dissection microscope, and maintained on the artificial diet rearing system as described previously [20, 26].\n\nInsect sampling, sorting and staging\n\nThe collected insects were sampled, sorted and staged as described [26].\n\nNymphs and adults. Normal first, second, third and fourth instar nymphs, second instar soldiers, and adults were identified based on their size and morphology.\n\nNon-soldier nymphs. Normal second to fourth instar nymphs (excluding first instar nymphs) were defined as non-soldier nymphs.\n\nYoung adults and old adults. For obtaining age-defined adult populations, many fourth instar nymphs were kept on artificial diet plates and inspected every day, and newly-molted adults were collected and transferred to new diet plates. Adult insects within 7 days after molt were defined as young adults, whereas adult insects no less than 8 days after molt were defined as old adults.\n\nNew soldiers, young soldiers and old soldiers. For obtaining age-defined soldier populations, many first instar nymphs were kept on artificial diet plates and inspected every day, and newly-molted soldiers were collected and transferred to new diet plates. Soldiers within one day after molt, 10 days after molt and 20 days after second instar molt were defined as new soldiers, young soldiers and old soldiers, respectively.\n\nObservation of cleaning behavior against dead aphids\n\nYoung soldiers were individually placed on an artificial diet arena and presented with 30 live old adults or 30 dead old adults that had been kept for 0, 1, 3 and 7 days at room temperature. The dead aphids were prepared by killing live aphids in a freezer at − 20 °C. For assaying the cleaning behavior, each insect on an artificial diet arena was continuously observed for 10 min under a dissection microscope. When an insect continuously pushed a test object (live colony mate or colony mate corpse) for 5 s or longer, the insect was regarded as performing cleaning behavior. For each of five test arenas, a total of 30 insects, which consisted of 10 young soldiers from 3 different galls (#1–3), were subjected to the behavioral observations.\n\nAnalysis of fatty acids\n\nCuticular fatty acids were extracted from live aphids (groups of ten old adults or thirty old soldiers) and dead aphids (groups of ten old adults or thirty old soldiers that were 0, 1, 3 and 7 days after freeze-killing) by soaking for 1 min in 25 μl hexane containing 10 ng/μl erucic acid (absent in the insect extracts) as an internal standard. The fatty acids, including the internal standard, in the crude extracts were converted to methyl esters via reaction with diazomethane for identification by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and quantitative determination by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). Each of the samples was dried under a nitrogen stream and re-suspended in 5 μl of hexane, and 1 μl aliquots of the solvent were subjected to the analyses. The identification of fatty acids was conducted by comparing retention times and mass spectra with those of authentic reference compounds. For quantification of fatty acids in each sample, individual peak areas were compared to the peak area of the internal standard. For comparing the fatty acid profiles, the relative proportion of each compound to the total fatty acids (excluding the internal standard) was calculated for each sample. The extraction and quantification of the cuticular fatty acids of the live aphids and dead aphids of each caste with different post-mortem times were conducted with 6 replicates (= 2 replicates × 3 galls [#1–3]).\n\nAnalysis of lipids\n\nAfter the hexane extraction of their cuticular fatty acids, the aphids were homogenized, and their body lipids were extracted two times with 500 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) for a day. The extracts were combined, dried, and chromatographed on a 500 mg silica gel column (Wako-gel C-300, Wako, Tokyo, Japan) with stepwise elution with 5 ml each of ether (two times) and methanol (two times), by which neutral lipids and phospholipids were recovered in the ether and methanol fractions, respectively. To determine the fatty acid compositions of the two lipid classes, each of the fractions was dried, re-suspended in 25 μl of hexane containing an internal standard (10 ng/μl erucic acid), and divided into two equal parts. One of them was reacted with diazomethane to evaluate the amounts of free fatty acids, and the other one was subjected to an alkaline hydrolysis with 5% KOH/ethanol followed by diazomethane reaction to evaluate the neutral lipid fatty acid composition or phospholipid fatty acid composition. The extraction, fractionation, and reaction to evaluate the neutral lipid/phospholipid fatty acid composition of live aphids were conducted with 2 replicates (= 1 replicate × 2 galls [#4–5]). Each of the samples was dried and re-suspended in 5 μl of hexane, and 1 μl aliquots were subjected to GC-MS and GC-FID analyses, respectively, as described below.\n\nGC-FID\n\nGC-FID was conducted on an HP6890 (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA, U.S.A.) equipped with a bonded-phase FFAP column (25 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness). Samples were injected in the splitless mode (sampling time: 1 min) at an injection port temperature of 280 °C. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml/min in the constant flow mode. The oven temperature was set at 70 °C for 1 min, then raised to 280 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min, and held at the final temperature for 10 min. A flame-ionization detector (FID) was operated at 280 °C and the chromatograms were analyzed by an HP ChemStation software.\n\nGC-MS\n\nMass spectra were obtained by GC-MS. Samples were injected into an HP6890N gas chromatograph operated under the same condition for GC-FID, except that the column (a fused silica HP-1MS column, 30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness) outlet was introduced at 280 °C into an MS-600H mass spectrometer (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Temperature of the ionization chamber was set at 190 °C and the ionization was done in the electron impact mode at 70 eV. The data were acquired in the scan mode (scan range 40–600 amu; scan speed 0.29 s) and analyzed by a TSS2000 software (ver. 2.00, Shrader Analytical and Consulting Laboratories Inc., Detroit, MI, USA).\n\nBehavioral assay against glass beads treated with fatty acids and aphid extracts\n\nThe insects were individually placed on an artificial diet arena with 300 glass beads (0.4 mm in diameter) that had been soaked in 20 μl of crude hexane extract or 20 μl of hexane solution containing test compound(s) and then air-dried, and their behaviors against the glass beads were observed (Fig. 5a). For obtaining crude hexane extract, about 500 old adults (3 days or longer after freeze-killing) were extracted with 1 ml of hexane for 1 min, and the extract solution was concentrated to the final volume of 20 μl. The six most abundant compounds, lauric acid (C12:0), myristic acid (C14:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), oleic acid (C18:1) and linoleic acid (18:2), were tested alone (3000 ng each) or blended at the ratios of 0.6: 0.8: 1.1: 0.8: 1.0: 1.0 (= 1800 ng lauric acid + 2400 ng myristic acid + 3300 ng palmitic acid + 2400 ng stearic acid + 3000 ng oleic acid + 3000 ng linoleic acid), mimicking the cuticular fatty acid profile of 1-week-old dead adult aphids. The final concentrations of the test samples applied to individual glass beads were adjusted to 10 ng or 1 ng linoleic acid per bead with or without other compounds. Control glass beads were treated with pure hexane. For assaying cleaning behavior, each insect on an artificial diet arena was observed for 10 min under a dissection microscope. When an insect continuously pushed a glass bead for 5 s or longer, the insect was regarded as performing cleaning behavior. For each assay, a total of 50 insects, which consisted of 15–20 aphids in each of the six caste/age classes (non-soldier nymphs, young adults, old adults, new soldiers, young soldiers, and old soldiers) from 3 different galls (#6–8), were subjected to the behavioral observations.\n\nBehavioral assay against live and dead aphids treated with linoleic acid\n\nLive and freshly killed non-soldier aphids, which consisted of third instar nymphs, fourth instar nymphs and adults, were randomly divided into groups and used for the experiments. The following seven treatment groups were prepared: intact live insects as negative control (10 intact non-soldier aphids plus 100 young soldiers per arena); live insects treated with hexane as solvent control (10 hexane-treated non-soldier aphids plus 100 young soldiers per arena); live insects treated with linoleic acid (10 non-soldier aphids treated with linoleic acid plus 100 young soldiers per arena); freshly killed insects as negative control (10 dead non-soldier aphids plus 100 young soldiers per arena); freshly killed insects treated with hexane as solvent control (10 hexane-treated dead non-soldier aphids plus 100 young soldiers per arena); freshly killed insects treated with linoleic acid (10 dead non-soldier aphids treated with linoleic acid plus 100 young soldiers per arena); and dead insects 3 days after killing as positive control (10 dead non-soldier aphids plus 100 young soldiers per arena). Application of 0.2 μl hexane containing 10 ng linoleic acid or 0.2 μl pure hexane was conducted onto the dorsal surface of each insect using a 5 μl micro-syringe. For behavioral assay, 10 non-soldier test insects were introduced into an artificial diet arena containing 100 young soldiers, and observed under a dissection microscope for 30 min continuously. When a non-soldier insect was continuously pushed by soldier(s) for 5 s or longer, the insect was regarded as “cleaned”. Each assay was replicated 4 times (= 2 times × 2 galls [#9–10]), and the data were pooled to calculate the proportion of the test insects cleaned by soldier(s) per total number of the test insects.\n\nMicrowave heat treatment\n\nIn order to suppress autolytic production of fatty acids in aphid cadavers, groups of ten old adults were killed in a freezer, then heated in a microwave oven for 1 min at 600 W, and kept at room temperature for 0, 1, 2 and 3 days. Control groups were not subjected to heat treatment after freeze-killing. Cuticular fatty acid profiles of the two experimental groups were compared in a time course. Each treatment was replicated 6 times (= 2 times × 3 galls [#1–3]).\n\nStatistics"
