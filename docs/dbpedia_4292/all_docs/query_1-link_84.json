        "meta_description": "Home is a special location for many animals, offering shelter from the elements, protection from predation, and a common place for gathering of the same species. Not surprisingly, many species have evolved efficient, robust homing strategies, which are used as part of each and every foraging journey. A basic strategy used by most animals is to take the shortest possible route home by accruing the net distances and directions travelled during foraging, a strategy well known as path integration. This strategy is part of the navigation toolbox of ants occupying different landscapes. However, when there is a visual discrepancy between test and training conditions, the distance travelled by animals relying on the path integrator varies dramatically between species: from 90% of the home vector to an absolute distance of only 50 cm. We here ask what the theoretically optimal balance between PI-driven and landmark-driven navigation should be. In combination with well-established results from optimal search theory, we show analytically that this fractional use of the home vector is an optimal homing strategy under a variety of circumstances. Assuming there is a familiar route that an ant recognizes, theoretically optimal search should always begin at some fraction of the home vector, depending on the region of familiarity. These results are shown to be largely independent of the search algorithm used. Ant species from different habitats appear to have optimized their navigation strategy based on the availability and nature of navigational information content in their environment.",

        "text": "1. Cost Minimization Model\n\nThe first model finds the fraction of the HV which minimizes the expected cost of finding the familiar route. We obtain abstract expressions of the cost independently of search strategy, and find the start of search which minimizes the cost.\n\nTo an animal, the costs of searching are complex and include intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as time wasted, energy lost, predation risk, and exposure to the elements. Here we abstract the cost of searching to be any monotonically increasing function of the distance to a point to be found. Hence the further a point, the more costly the search for that point.\n\nWhen a navigating agent searches for any point along a route, the overall cost must account for the cost of searching all possible points, weighted in some way. At the start of search, the agent does not know precisely where the familiar route is relative to itself. Hence whatever search strategy is used, it has no way to guarantee that it will find one particular part of the familiar route first. It could not, for example, decide to find the nearest point first, since it does not know where that point is relative to itself, nor can it maintain a noise-free course towards such a point even if it guessed correctly. It may even fail to recognize that point on the first encounter (for exponential detection law, see [31]). Thus, it is reasonable to suppose that there is some probability that any part of the familiar route may be found and recognized first over a large number of trials and random displacements. It is important to note that while the navigating agent may be searching for all points simultaneously with the goal of detecting any of them, on any particular trial, it is assumed that there is a single point which is detected first, after which it finds its way home.\n\nFor a set of points such as a familiar route, the expected cost function is modelled in two ways. Firstly, all points along the familiar route are assumed to contribute equally to the expected cost of search (Model 1a). In this way, the expected cost is found over all points along the familiar route. Secondly, the expected cost is found over the angular extent of the familiar route, subtended at the point of (ideal) start of search (Model 1b). In effect, the latter analysis provides a reweighting of points along the familiar route, reducing the contribution of points which are far away at the start of search.\n\nThe major advantage of these two ways of modelling the expected cost function is that they do not require a particular search strategy or distribution to be assumed. A disadvantage is that neither explicitly account for the probability distribution of points along the familiar route being found. The latter requires specification, at the very least, of a search distribution (see later).\n\n1. Cost Minimization Model\n\nA geometric construction illustrating the following analysis is shown in Figure 3. The distance between the start of search, , and the position of a familiar location is(1)\n\nThe two locations being compared are denoted and . These represent two possible locations to begin searching for the familiar route, one exactly midway along a line parallel to the familiar route, and one slightly displaced from the midpoint. It is assumed the searcher has been displaced by some distance perpendicularly to the familiar route (NB: if , the searcher has found the familiar route). Congruent triangles (dashed lines) show equivalent distributions of distances to points along the familiar route, while the shaded areas show unequal distributions of distances (see text for details).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0050451.g003\n\nIt is assumed that the cost of searching, , is some monotonically increasing function of . This assumption implies that the further a familiar location, the greater the cost to the ant of finding it. The quantitative contribution of each point along a familiar route to the overall cost of search depends on the relative proportion of time which is spent searching for that particular point, which depends both on the search strategy and distribution of target points.\n\nFrom the midpoint i.e., , the expected (average) cost of searching for all points along the familiar route is(2)\n\nShifted by some distance i.e., , the expected cost of searching for all points along the familiar route is(3)\n\nIt can be seen that(4)because there is no change in the relative position between the search start and familiar route segment of interest (both shifted by ). However,(5)since\n\n(6)This means ,(7)\n\nBy symmetry of construction, equivalent arguments apply . Therefore, the expected cost of search, , is minimized if and only if(8)\n\nIt is important to note that this result is independent of the search distribution or search algorithm.\n\nA similar argument applies in considering the maximum cost of search rather than the expected cost of search. The monotonicity of implies that(9)so that(10)if and only if ( ). Hence the maximum cost of search is also minimized when search begins after homing for half the distance of the familiar route.\n\nHowever, the minimum cost , and is independent of over the length of the familiar route. Hence the fraction of the HV used prior to searching does not affect the minimum cost of search. Nonetheless, there is no contradiction with the position minimizing the maximum or expected cost.\n\nIt can also be shown that the expected cost of search with respect to the angular extent of the familiar route is also minimized when (Model 1b, Text S1, see also Figure S2). The consistency between Models 1a and 1b is not surprising because the underlying assumption in both models is that the cost of search increases with distance. Since the distance to the furthest end of the familiar route increases with , points of the familiar route contributing to the most costly search are minimized by setting . These results support the hypothesis that the search initiation point which minimizes search cost is relatively insensitive to the search distribution, and should be midway along the familiar route according to PI.\n\nThe validity of the above theoretical assumptions is illustrated using three simple search algorithms, in simulation (Figures S3, S4, S5, S6, Table S1, S2). Firstly, the random displacement immediately prior to homing (red dashed lines in Figures S3A, S4A and S5A) combined with sensorimotor noise in the execution of any search strategy result in a distribution of first detections over the entire familiar route (Figures S3B, S4B and S5B). This is true even if the familiar route is detected on every encounter (perfect detection). Secondly, expressed as the average number of steps needed to detect the familiar route, the average cost of search increased monotonically with the distance to a point along the familiar route (Figures S6A, S6C and S6E). Most importantly, the average cost of search was minimized when , irrespective of whether the ‘cost’ was the mean number of steps until first detection of the familiar route, or the ‘cost’ was the probability of failure of detecting the familiar route within a predefined number of search steps (Figures S6B, S6D and S6F, including insets).\n\n2. Optimal Search Distribution Model\n\nThe previous analysis did not define a particular search distribution to most efficiently find the familiar route. The problem modelled next is an extension of [32] and similar assumptions are made (see also [18]). Some key results from Koopman [32] relevant to the current work are outlined below.\n\nAssuming an exponential detection law, the optimal search distribution for a point target was proven to be the natural logarithm of the prior distribution of the target [31]. For a Gaussian prior distribution, the optimal search density function is therefore an inverted parabola. The exponential detection law was derived assuming that target recognition is imperfect, so that for some small search effort, , allocated to the vicinity of the target, there is some probability, , of detecting the target, and that is constant for each equivalent search effort applied to the vicinity of the target, independent of previous allocations of search effort at that location. In the limit, . See Koopman [31], [33] for more detailed analytic treatment of the target detection process, and underlying assumptions and limitations of this model.\n\nThe original optimal search problem was defined for a point target, and where the searcher’s position is known at all times. This concept can be extended to a target which is an entire route in 2D space, and where the searcher’s position is uncertain. The route itself may be considered as a set of points, each of which is detectable by the searcher according to the same detection function.\n\nConsider firstly the simplified problem of searching for either of two point targets in 1D, denoted and , separated by a fixed distance r. The search succeeds if either target is found. This is equivalent to two small targets which are fixed in allocentric space, but due to the searcher’s uncertainty about its own position, the position of either target relative to the searcher is uncertain, but the uncertainty distributions are perfectly correlated (since and are fixed in their relative positions).\n\nSuppose the prior distribution of the targets, i.e., and are known to the searcher. The optimal search problem becomes one of finding the search density function which maximizes the probability of detecting either or for any planned search horizon (predetermined total search effort - illustrated in Figure 4, see also [32]).\n\nA. Probability density heat map for a familiar route (straight line segment) between and , with Gaussian uncertainty whose standard deviations . B. The marginal optimal search density for a total search effort, , of 1, 2 or 4 arbitrary units. Note that the integral under each search density function equals the total search effort [32]. C and D as per A and B, respectively, with (twice the width of the uncertainty distribution as A).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0050451.g004\n\nFrom the searcher’s perspective, the above problem is similar to the original problem of finding a single target whose position is uncertain. Firstly, for the purpose of target search, the relative uncertainty between searcher and target can be considered to be independent of whether positional uncertainty is associated with the searcher or the target. That means the uncertainty in allocentric position of the searcher (due to cumulative PI errors) can be considered to be equivalent to the uncertainty in position of the target relative to the searcher. Secondly, it is assumed here that search success does not depend on which target is found, only that a target is found (which is true if the aim of search is to find any point along a familiar route).\n\nThe probability of being at is , while the probability of being at is . Note that and can never be at simultaneously as they are always separated by . The two-target problem differs from the one-target problem in the following way. Suppose a search distribution is fully executed even if a target is found early. For one target, the probability of detecting that target is equivalent to the expected number of targets detected per search, always between zero and one. For two targets, the expected number of targets detected per search may exceed one, under the assumption that pre-allocated search is executed fully. In other words, in some searches, both targets are detected within the pre-allocated search effort. In practice, the searcher may abandon search once the familiar route is found.\n\nStrictly, maximizing the expected number of targets detected in the two-target problem is not mathematically equivalent to optimizing the probability of detecting either target. For example, if the probability of detecting both targets is increased without affecting the probability of detecting individual targets, the expected number of targets detected is increased, without increasing the probability of detecting either target. However, by maximizing the expected number of targets detected, it is likely that a realization of the search distribution will detect a target early, providing benefit to the searcher. Furthermore, this formulation of the problem provides a simple mathematical solution for the optimal search effort distribution which can be found directly following Koopman [32].\n\nFrom the earlier example, the combined density function is,(11)which is the probability density of either or being at . Note the normalization factor is required to preserve the property that . Normalization to preserve the properties of a probability density function is convenient when this result is generalized as a convolution (see later). However, an alternative formulation without normalization can also be used, i.e., . Intuitively, may be considered as the frequency of targets at (or close to) . Hence the total frequency of two targets over all space is two, i.e., .\n\nAn analogous can be found for any number of points . Next consider that a line segment (representing a familiar route) is a continuum of points. For a familiar 1D route along segment , the density function is simply the convolution of a uniform distribution of points along the line segment, with the uncertainty distribution. Simplified, it is(12)\n\nMore generally, the convolution may be written as(13)where is the distribution of points along the familiar route.\n\nFor instance, if is Gaussian, and along the familiar route as above,(14)\n\nSimilarly if is Gaussian in 2D, and assuming a familiar route along the straight line segment between and ,(15)\n\nFigure 4 shows two examples of the optimal search distribution for different uncertainty standard deviations.\n\nThe bivariate Gaussian is a good approximation of the positional uncertainty distribution of a PI system which has a compass [7], [8]. However, the precise distribution of the positional uncertainty is not critical for the model results to hold. From Eq 12, as long as uncertainty and search properties are such that the optimal search distribution is symmetric and unimodal for any point target, is also unimodal with global maximum at .\n\nFollowing Koopman [32], the optimal search distribution is:(16)where is the total search effort. Graphically, the value of the Lagrange multiplier may be found by sliding a horizontal line up or down until the area between the logarithm of and the logarithm of is exactly . For a Gaussian , the optimal distribution of search effort, is therefore an inverted parabola. Note that is independent of constant scaling of , so that using or yields the same result for . For further details see Koopman [32], [33].\n\nTwo important consequences of Eq 16 are as follows. Firstly, if has a global maximum at then so does the optimal search distribution . Secondly, total search effort may be increased at any time, without affecting the optimality of the search up to that point in time. This is because the effect of increasing is equivalent to lowering , which means all previous search effort is still included in the new optimal search distribution. However, if the total search effort is not pre-allocated, there is only one location which is guaranteed to be part of any optimal search distribution, which is the global maximum of , i.e. . Therefore, this is an optimal position to begin search, irrespective of the total search effort which will eventually be exerted.\n\nIt is worth noting that the arguments presented above may be generalized to alternative target detection models. For instance, Wehner & Srinivasan [15] assumed that the ideal search density function should match the prior uncertainty distribution rather than its logarithm. Under this assumption, the search effort distribution should also be maximal when is maximal, which occurs when , under the assumptions stated earlier."
