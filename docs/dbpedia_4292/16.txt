Polyergus samurai is parasitic on Formica - Formica japonica, Formica hayashi, Formica candida and so on. For paratization, we need Formica's cocoons and some young Formica workers as Polyergus can't hatch cocoons. And we should put Formica's cocoons into Polyergus colony repeatedly.

<2014.08.12.>

In August, my acquaintance gave me a Polyergus queen & 200 Formica workers.

When I got them by parcel service, the Polyergus queen & Formica workes were poisoned with Formica workers' formic acid. OMG...I thought they had been dead.

As some Formica workers moved, I taked out the Polyergus queen & Formica workers.

Fortunately, the Polyergus queen moved weakly.

I laid them with pine needles on wet tissue. After a while, they struggled to their feet.

I put the Polyergus queen & Formica workers into keeping bin and planned to collect Formica's cocoons tomorrow.

Proof that Polyergus can be kept in captivity.
