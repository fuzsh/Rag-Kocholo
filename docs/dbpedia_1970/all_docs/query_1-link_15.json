        "text": "Eagles pitcher and eight-year major league veteran Brandon Duckworth: \"First and foremost, he throws pretty hard. Then, there's the split-finger, which he throws with the same arm speed so that it comes out just like a fastball. It's crazy because that thing just falls off the table.\"\n\nCraig Brazell, the Chiba Lotte first baseman who had cups of coffee with the Mets and Royals: \"His split is one of the best I have ever seen. When facing him this year, you just had to hope he made a mistake over the plate, and he did not make many of them.\"\n\nA Japanese baseball writer, patting his chest for emphasis: \"He's so strong in his heart.\"\n\nFormer Lotte Orions (now the Lotte Marines) pitcher Choji Murata, a 215-game winner: \"While there was the fuss about the ball, he didn't back away from anyone. You rarely find that kind of performance anywhere in the world.\"\n\nEagles pitcher Jim Heuser: \"It's been a lot of fun watching him kick it in gear, watching him just flip the switch when he needs to. Just from watching him last year, you see how he's grown. You can tell if he goes to the States, he's gonna be a good weapon for whatever team.\"\n\nAn unnamed MLB scout: \"You can't really say for sure, but he's got the stuff, the ability and the mentality to be as good as anybody who's gone over.\"\n\nThe long (and getting longer) list of Japanese pitchers in the majors seems equally divided between seikou (Darvish, Uehara, Hideo Nomo, Hiroki Kuroda) and shitsubou (Hideki Irabu, Kazuhito Tadano, Kei Igawa, Daisuke Matsuzaka. But Tanaka seems as sure a thing as Darvish was when he was signed at the age of 25, coming off an 18-6 season with the Fighters.\n\nThere are differences, though. Darvish has a relatively smooth delivery that belies the velocity of his pitches, while Tanaka seems to pause over his right leg before uncoiling his arm with a force that produces tremendous speed and/or spin.\n\nDarvish is shy and businesslike, which makes the softer light in Texas a good fit for him. Tanaka is more approachable and personable -- the bigger fishbowls in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago should not be a problem for him.\n\nTanaka also likes to have a little fun. When the Eagles won the Japan Series, they did not forget Darrell Rasner, their American reliever who had gone home to the States for Tommy John surgery toward the end of the season. Reliever Koji Aoyama brought a cardboard cutout of Rasner onto the field, and Tanaka posed for pictures with his two-dimensional American friend. After the Eagles won the Pacific League pennant, Aoyama put on Rasner's uniform, which cracked Tanaka up when he saw it near the mound during the celebration. Tanaka turned Aoyama around and took a picture with him so that Rasner's name was showing on the uniform next to Ma-Kun.\n\nTanaka should also do just fine with American hitters, at least according to Tony Barnette, a pitcher with the Yakult Swallows. \"The team that gets him will have to hold his hand a little bit in spring training to make sure he's comfortable and confident in the American game, but I don't see too many adjustments needing to be made. He and Darvish are both smart guys with a lot of confidence. And in America, they can throw their power stuff at the bottom of the strike zone, which just drives guys crazy.\"\n\nThere is one skeptic, however. After the season, Yu Darvish was asked on Twitter about Tanaka's MLB prospects. \"You can't really say about any player,\" he tweeted, \"but you never know until you actually go over there.\"\n\nIn other words, Jinsei wa naniga okoruka wakaranai.\n\nIf seeing is believing, then this might up the bidding.\n\nIt's the middle of the ninth inning of Game 7 of the 2013 Japan Series. The day before, Tanaka had thrown 160 pitches in a 4-2 loss to the Giants. But now the Eagles, who had never been in the Series before, have a 3-0 lead over a franchise that has won 22 of them. And Ma-Kun is warming up in the bullpen of Kleenex Stadium, which had been damaged by the flooding that followed the quake.\n\nA light rain has begun to fall. You see the Eagles manager, Senichi Hoshino, talking to the plate umpire and smiling. (The last manager to ask his best pitcher to do such a thing was Rogers Hornsby of the Cardinals in 1926, when he called on Grover Alexander to close out the Yankees in Game 7.)\n\nThe Japanese play-by-play announcer says, \"Tanaka Masahiro desu!\" (\"It's Masahiro Tanaka!\") The color man responds, \"Sugoi na!\" (\"Amazing!\")\n\nAs No. 18 warms up, the fans begin to sing along to the Funky Monkey Babys song while clapping their orange thunder sticks. As the camera pans over the faces, one of whom is the beautiful Mai Satoda in a hooded red raincoat, you can see just how much this game, and the pitcher on the mound, means to them. This very stadium had been damaged in the earthquake, and the region is still in recovery.\n\nTanaka gives up a single on a ground ball that just gets by shortstop Kaz Matsui. (Sorry, Mets fans.) After a strikeout, he gets Giants outfielder John Bowker to ground out to first, moving the runner to second. Then, he gives up a single to right, putting runners on first and third and bringing the tying run to the plate.\n\nIn this crucial moment, you see what makes Ma-Kun special. Facing Kenji Yano, a .358 pinch hitter during the regular season, he gets ahead 1-and-2 and then throws an outrageous splitter that would have fooled any batter in either major league. Tanaka roars in triumph, and the fans release white victory balloons. As the Eagles begin to gather on the field -- mixing daps with ceremonial bows -- the speakers blare a Japanese cover of \"We Are The Champions.\" At one point in the celebration, manager Hoshino succumbs to the Japanese tradition of doage -- he lies back to be thrown into the air once, twice â€¦ eight times.\n\nThe fact that there isn't a dry eye in Kleenex Stadium has nothing to do with the rain.\n\nAfter the game, and just before the traditional Japanese beer celebration in a tent next to the indoor practice facility, Hoshino expressed his trepidation about using Ma-Kun, saying, \"Tanaka is a human being, not a god, at the end of the day. I had a bad feeling, but it was Tanaka who gave us a chance to be here.\"\n\nTanaka admitted, \"It wasn't easy, but I thought I had to do it. I didn't have much gas left.\"\n\nAnd Darvish tweeted after Game 7, \"I bet major league scouts are worried.\"\n\nBut on the victory tour in the days and weeks after the game, Tanaka said he has fully recovered: \"I am doing fine now, as you can see, so I've got no worries.\"\n\nHe accompanied the Eagles to the Asia Series in Taiwan to thank the Taiwanese for their help in the earthquake recovery, but he did not pitch.\n\nSince then, Tanaka has been necessarily cagey about his plans, finally saying earlier this week that he wants to move to MLB in 2014. Wherever he pitches, those plans include another title. After the Nov. 24 parade, he said, \"I didn't expect that a parade would be that much fun. Hopefully, I will be able to have another one during the rest of my life in baseball.\"\n\nWhere the rest of that life plays out is still a matter of conjecture. Just over a week ago, Eagles president Yozo Tachibana expressed his disappointment over the new posting system in an impromptu news conference in the lobby of the Dolphin Hotel at baseball's winter meetings in Walt Disney World, and owner Hiroshi Mikitani is said to be furious with the other 11 Japanese team owners for agreeing to the new system. There is even a rumor that the other clubs will sweeten the posting deal to: (1) appease Mikitani and (2) get Tanaka out of NPB.\n\nBut Rakuten is an e-commerce company similar to Amazon, so Mikitani, a Harvard MBA, is not hurting for money. And even if he holds on to Tanaka, the Eagles could lose him to international free agency after the 2015 season.\n\nIn the end, Mikitani may accede to the wishes of both Tanaka, who can't really top what he's done in Japan, and the Japanese public. As beloved as Ma-Kun is in Japan, many of his fans there would welcome the chance to see how he does in America. One male fan from Sendai put it this way: \"If he goes now, he can play over there at his peak. So it is what it is, and we wish him well.\"\n\nAnd a woman from Morioka said, \"I can understand that he wants to go over there and be successful. We'd definitely miss him, but I want to say, 'Good luck!'\"\n\nGood luck, too, to his suitors.\n\nDo we hear $125 million?"
