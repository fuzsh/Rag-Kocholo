        "text": "This first photo was taken on October 24, 1916. The Hawaiian Travelers, a multi-ethnic, barnstorming baseball team from Hawaii, toured the American mainland between 1912 and 1916, playing in 132 exhibition games. The team was also known as the “Chinese Travelers.” In 1913, the Travelers played games in the tristate region against teams that included the New York Lincoln Giants, a Negro League team, and the Seton Hall Pirates, a college team. Among the team members were three nisei, James Chinito (“Jimmy”) Moriyama (1893-1950), his brother Clement .(‘Clem”) Moriyama (1894- 1970), and Andy Masayoshi ‘Yamashiro (1896-1941). To align himself with the team’s alternate name, ‘Yamashiro adopted the pseudonym “Andy Yim.” The Travelers demonstrated to American audiences the ability of Asian Americans and Native Hawaiians to play competitive baseball against white and black Americans.\n\nThe second photo is of Andy Yamashiro playing football for Temple Preparatory School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, November 22, 1916. In 1916, when the Hawaiian Travelers completed their national tour, Andy Yamashiro, still known as “Andy Yim,” returned to Philadelphia and enrolled at Temple Preparatory School. During his studies, Yamashiro became a right guardsman on the school’s football team, memorialized in this photo from November 22, 1916. His athletic pursuits paid off, and he went on to play professional baseball for a minor league team in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Yamashiro is among the first Asian Americans to play professional baseball.\n\nThis is an undated publicity photo of the All Hawaiian Nine. Buck Lai is third from the left in the photo. In 1928 Buck Lai, in the disappointing wake of losing his contract with the New York Giants, crossed the Hudson to play four games with the Jersey City Skeeters of the International League. He then rejoined the Brooklyn Bushwicks, the semi-pro team he had played on before signing with the Giants. Seven years later, in 1935, Lai left New York to return to his native Hawai’i. He soon formed a barnstorming team named the “All Hawaiian Nine,” a team composed predominantly of players of Chinese or Japanese ancestry.\n\nThe All Hawaiian Nine played exhibition games across the United States and brought Lai back to New York City to compete against the Brooklyn Bushwicks, Pennsylvania Red Caps, and Central Park Pine Grovers. World War II brought their tour to a stop, and post-war Lai returned to Brooklyn to work as a scout and instructor for the Brooklyn Dodgers. He later served as the baseball and basketball coach for the Long Island University (LIU) Brooklyn Blackbirds, and the athletic director and Provost at LIU Brooklyn.\n\nIn December 1941, with the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the entry of the United States into World War II, the foundations of Japanese American life began to shake. As the United States descended into racial hysteria, American political leaders and the media raised unfounded concerns of espionage and sabotage by nikkei. Two months after the Pearl Harbor attack, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, which authorized the forcible removal of all persons of Japanese ancestry – two-thirds of whom were American citizens – from their homes on the Pacific coast. They were taken to makeshift assembly centers (converted horse racing tracks and fairgrounds), and then to concentration camps, euphemistically named “War Relocation Centers,” situated in deserts or swamps. The ten isolated camps housed more than 120,000 Japanese Americans. For all of the nikkei, the transition was unjustly abrupt and devastating. A few communities were given a mere 48 hours to sell their valuables, homes, and businesses, while the remainder had only a few months to uproot their lives. In the camps, daily oppression and heavy surveillance were heavy reminders to Japanese Americans that they were outsiders in their own country.\n\nSeemingly overnight, life for Japanese Americans turned horrifically upside down. For many incarcerated families, baseball served as a source of comfort from their past life and brought a semblance of their former freedom. Many Japanese Americans turned to the sport as a way to overcome the drudgery of daily life in the camps. Fred Oshima, a sportswriter for the Rohwer Outpost – a newspaper published at the Rohwer War Relocation Center in Arkansas where he was incarcerated – recalls, “Japanese American baseball served a meaningful socioeconomic role and entertainment lifestyle for this closely knit ethnic group on the wrong side of the tracks.”\n\nOn the East Coast a lesser number of Japanese Americans were incarcerated, ironically on Ellis Island, and most avoided forcible removal or arrest. However, the general atmosphere of distrust and racism towards Asian Americans after the outbreak of World War II led many issei and nisei to lose their jobs. Some were placed under government surveillance, others were subjected to warrantless searches of their homes, and all non-citizen issei had to register as “enemy aliens” and carry special identification cards. In 1994, New York City Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia verbalized unfounded discrimination, expressing that Japanese Americans resettled from camps in Manhattan and Brooklyn could pose “potential dangers” near New York’s military installations, plants, or shipping facilities.\n\nWally Yonamine (1925–2011), born in Maui, Hawai’i, was a nisei of Okinawa and Japanese ancestry and the first ethnic Japanese to play professional American football. In 1947, he was a running back for the San Francisco 49ers, but an off-season injury led to his dismissal in 1948. Yonamine did something radical – he changed sports. In 1950, he began playing minor league baseball for the Salt Lake City Bees. That autumn, Yonamine had dinner with two men who changed the course of his career: Joe DiMaggio, the Yankees’ star outfielder, and Lefty O’Doul, a two-time NL (National League) batting champion and the manager of the minor league San Francisco Seals. Both were knowledgeable about baseball in Japan, O’Doul even helped to popularize baseball in Japan during the 1930s. He arranged for Yonamine to sign with the Yomiuri Giants, a team in the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) league. Yonamine moved to Japan and enjoyed a 12-year career as an outfielder and first baseman. He brought his American idiosyncrasies to the Japanese game, and today is credited with introducing aggressive tactics such as sliding with spikes up toward infielders’ legs and diving for fly balls. His tenacity won the Central League’s MVP award in 1957 and finished his career with a .311 lifetime batting average.\n\nOfficial Cincinnati Reds MLB headshot for Mike Lum, 1976. Michael Ken-Wai (“Mike”) Lum (b. 1945) became the first Japanese American to play in MLB when he debuted with the Atlanta Braves in 1967. Lum was born in Honolulu, Hawai’i to a nisei mother and white American soldier father. He was raised and adopted by a Chinese American couple, Mun Luke and Winnifred Lum. It is unlikely that most New York Japanese knew about Lum’s Japanese ethnicity as the American press rarely mentioned his Japanese heritage – even after the adoption was revealed by the Associated Press on July 4, 1970.\n\nAn outfielder, Lum had difficulty breaking into the Braves’ starting lineup due to presence of Henry Aaron, Ralph Garr, and Dusty Baker. However, he received more playing time, beginning in 1971, when he was utilized at first base, as well as in the outfield. Lum had his best season in 1973, batting .294 with 16 home runs and 82 runs batted in 568 at-bats. After the 1975 season, the Braves traded Lum to the Cincinnati\n\nReds where he encountered a similar clogged outfield situation, and at first base. Lum had now become a bench player. Reds manager Sparky Anderson called Lum “the most underrated player in the National League.”\n\nRyan Yoshimoto Kurosaki (b. 1952) poses for an official team photograph with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1973. Born in Honolulu, Hawai’i, Ryan is a sansei (third-generation Japanese American). His parents, Katsuto Kurosaki and Toshiko (“Eleanor”) Fujii Kurosaki, were nisei. The Cardinals called up Kurosaki to the big club soon after the start of his second season in the minors. The St. Louis press was quick to point out Kurosaki’s Japanese ancestry and used it to signify his “otherness” and connections to a former World War II enemy. Before Kurosaki’s first game, an article in the St. Louis Post Dispatch stated, “Forget it, Ancient order of Hibernians [the largest Irish Catholic organization in America]. His first name may be Ryan, but he’s all Japanese.”\n\nAfter a poor pitching performance for the Cardinals, another article in the St. Louis Post Dispatch declared, “Ryan Kurosaki was bombed like Nagasaki.” Kurosaki pitched a total of 13 innings to a 7.62 ERA in seven games with the Cardinals, and then was sent back down to the Double-A Arkansas Travelers, never to return to the majors. Bill Valentine, the Traveler’s announcer and later the team’s general manager, described what happened to Kurosaki in the following terms: “Here was a kid who had pitched one year in A ball, a few weeks in Double-A, and they pulled him up to pitch relief in the big leagues. No way he could have been ready. Then they sent him back and forgot about him.”\n\nImage of a cropped 1980 Baltimore Orioles baseball card of Lenn Sakata. By the 1980s Japanese players and nikkei of all generations still did not have significant representation in Major League Baseball. Murakami, the first Japanese player in MLB in 1964, paved the way for Japanese Americans Mike Lum and Ryan Kurosaki. Lenn Haruki Sakata (b. 1954), a high school teammate of Kurosaki, was next. Sakata, a yonsei (fourth-generation Japanese American) born in Honolulu, signed with the Milwaukee Brewers in 1977 after he graduated from Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington. As a second baseman and shortstop, Sakata was primarily used as a utility player during his 11-year MLB career. While not a starting player, Sakata’s defensive prowess and reliability led him to the Baltimore Orioles, where he was part of the team that won the World Series in 1983. He was the first Asian and Asian American to be part of the highest victory in baseball. Sakata finished his major league career through the most famous gateway: the New York Yankees. He played two and a half months for the renowned team in 1987, his final season as a MLB player. Sakata went on to enjoy a lengthy career as a minor league manager.\n\nThis is a photograph of the Hawaiian Rainbow Warriors head coach Les Murakami (left) and Derek Tatsuno (right) in 1979. Hideo Nomo made it big, and other Japanese players such as Ichiro Suzuki and Hideki Matsui followed. Yet, after 1980 and before 2005 only a handful of nikkei utility players made it to MLB. In a 2021 interview with the Hawaii Herald, Lenn Sakata spoke candidly about the difficulties for Asian Americans in the league, saying, “There were a lot of instances where it wasn’t just blatant racism, but their attitudes about Asians were just condescending. . . . We were a bunch of second-class people sometimes; just invisible. The Asian stereotype at the time was that nobody was athletic, or even taken seriously. So I think that’s probably why nobody even attempted to try to come at it. It just didn’t seem like we fit in.”\n\nMajor League Baseball’s racist climate, combined with interest from Nippon Professional Baseball teams, led some talented nikkei players to avoid the league altogether. Derek Tatsuno (b. 1958) – the first 20-game winner and the all-time season leader in strikeouts in NCAA Division I college baseball – turned down contract offers from four MLB teams (including one team that drafted him in two different years) between 1976 and 1981. Instead, he pitched at the college level, and then for a team in Japan’s amateur league. Tatsuno’s objective wasn’t the fame and turbulence of MBL, it was stability. The NPB offered greater job security and a solid salary -and a way around the racial and professional stressors imposed by the major leagues. However, because MLB teams continued to draft him every year, Tatsuno was prohibited from signing a contract with a NPB team. Finally, in 1982, when the Milwaukee Brewers drafted Tatsuno, he signed. By 1988, Tatsuno had played six years for the Brewers’ AA affiliate and Single-A teams. He left baseball without ever playing a game in MLB.\n\nBaba, Scott. “LENN SAKATA RETURNS TO HIS FIRST LOVE.” The Hawaii Herald, 18 June 2021, https://www.thehawaiiherald.com/2021/06/18/sports-lenn-sakata-returns-to-his-first-love/.
