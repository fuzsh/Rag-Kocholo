        "text": "NAGO, Japan — On the side of the Nippon Ham Fighters’ spring training bullpen reserved for fan viewing, onlookers clutching cellphones, video cameras and even children jockeyed to capture a glimpse of the pitcher who had started throwing. The center of attention was not Yu Darvish this time, for he had signed a six-year contract with the Texas Rangers.\n\nThe commotion surrounded 23-year-old Yuki Saito, who went 6-6 in 19 starts as a rookie last year. Saito is not expected to fill the void in the rotation left by Darvish’s departure, but he may be just the kind of player who helps buoy interest in Japanese baseball.\n\nSaito was a star of the national high school baseball tournament, the summer sporting event that has gripped Japan for 93 years. As a senior in 2006, he started all seven games his team played in the 16-day tournament to help win his school’s first national championship.\n\nHis last four starts, on successive days, included pitching 15 innings of the championship game that ended in a 1-1 tie, then all nine innings of the 4-3 victory for the title. His 69 innings and 948 pitches set tournament records, and his 78 strikeouts were the most in 48 years. He also endeared himself to the nation by tucking into his uniform pocket a handkerchief that he used to wipe his brow."
