Their Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters counterparts, however, head back to Sapporo thinking that snowballs have a nasty tendency to start avalanches.\n\nThe Carp parlayed a leadoff double and a play at the plate, one so close it needed a replay review, into a tiebreaking run in the sixth inning. Then they added three more, as the wheels fell off for Nippon Ham, to move halfway to a long-awaited title with a 5-1 victory on Sunday night in front of a crowd of 30,638 at Mazda Stadium.\n\n\"We played Carp baseball yesterday and today,\" Hiroshima manager Koichi Ogata said. \"It was a great game.\""
