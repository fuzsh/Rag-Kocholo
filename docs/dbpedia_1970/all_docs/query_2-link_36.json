        "text": "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. One of the longest droughts in baseball history came to an end in 2004 when the Boston Red Sox won their first World Series since 1918. With that victory, a new age was dawning. One in which even the Chicago Cubs could start hoping for a title of their own sooner rather than later. (And it came, in 2016.)\n\nHowever, on the other side of the ocean, Nippon Professional Baseball experienced one of the most trying, core-changing seasons in its history. Two Pacific League teams, the Orix BlueWave and the Kintetsu Buffaloes, reached an agreement to merge at season’s end, leaving an imbalance (five teams) in league structure.\n\nThe players, voicing concern over the potential ramifications of this merger (one possibility floating around was a reduction from 12 to 8 teams in a single-league format), went on strike for two days. (This was the first and only strike in NPB history.) However, instead of downsizing, the league searched for a corporation to form an expansion team. The two main candidates were Livedoor, an internet company, and Rakuten, a commerce conglomerate owned by Hiroshi Mikitani, which won the right to join NPB, forming the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles in 2005.\n\nAmid the restructuring of the league came the announcement that interleague play would begin during the coming season, a draft scandal, and rumors of a second merger between two more flailing Pacific League franchises.1 On top of this, Japan was coming out of 2004 still feeling the sting of losing their semifinal match against unheralded Australia at the Summer Olympics in Athens. They would ultimately take the Bronze, but it was a disappointing finish for a nation expecting to contend for the Gold.\n\nThe 2004 Japan All-Star Series was more than just a feel-good series of friendly games between star players from two baseball organizations. Japan yearned to show it belonged in the conversation of baseball juggernauts. It needed to assure its fan base that the health of its de facto national sport was sound as well. And so, when the MLB representatives came to play eight games in 10 days at five domed stadiums across Japan, winning was actually important to one of the teams.\n\nThe 28 major leaguers comprised 19 Americans, 3 Venezuelans, 2 Dominicans, 2 Puerto Ricans, and 2 Japanese – Kazuhisa Ishii and Akinori Otsuka, who had played the previous season with the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres respectively.\n\nThe All-MLB Roster\n\nPitchers: Kiko Calero (St. Louis Cardinals), Roger Clemens (Houston Astros), Kazuhisa Ishii (Los Angeles Dodgers), Ray King (St. Louis Cardinals), Scott Linebrink (San Diego Padres), Kyle Lohse (Minnesota Twins), Jason Marquis (St. Louis Cardinals), Akinori Otsuka (San Diego Padres), Jake Peavy (San Diego Padres), Mark Redman (Oakland Athletics), Chris Reitsma (Atlanta Braves), Francisco Rodriguez (Anaheim Angels), Scot Shields (Anaheim Angels), Dontrelle Willis (Florida Marlins)\n\nCatchers: Johnny Estrada (Atlanta Braves), Victor Martinez (Cleveland Indians)\n\nInfielders: Hank Blalock (Texas Rangers), Alex Cora (Los Angeles Dodgers), Marcus Giles (Atlanta Braves), David Ortiz (Boston Red Sox), Jack Wilson (Pittsburgh Pirates), Michael Young (Texas Rangers)\n\nOutfielders: Moisés Alou (Chicago Cubs), Miguel Cabrera (Florida Marlins), Carl Crawford (Tampa Bay Devil Rays), Manny Ramirez (Boston Red Sox), Vernon Wells (Toronto Blue Jays), Brad Wilkerson (Montreal Expos)\n\nCoaching Staff: Bruce Bochy (San Diego Padres), Jim Colborn (Los Angeles Dodgers), Pat Corrales (Atlanta Braves), Bill Robinson (Florida Marlins)\n\nNote: Albert Pujols (Cardinals), Alfonso Soriano (Rangers), Miguel Tejada (Orioles), and LaTroy Hawkins (Cubs) were selected but did not participate due to injury.\n\nThe All-NPB Roster\n\nPitchers: Nagisa Arakaki (Fukuoka Daiei Hawks), Ryota Igarashi (Tokyo Yakult Swallows), Kei Igawa (Hanshin Tigers), Hirotoshi Ishii (Tokyo Yakult Swallows), Takeharu Kato (Yokohama Bay Stars), Hiroyuki Kobayashi (Chiba Lotte Marines), Hisashi Iwakuma (Kintetsu Buffaloes), Daisuke Matsuzaka (Seibu Lions), Koji Mise (Fukuoka Daiei Hawks), Koji Uehara (Yomiuri Giants), Shunsuke Watanabe (Chiba Lotte Marines), Kazuo Yamaguchi (Orix BlueWave), Yukiya Yokoyama (Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters)\n\nCatchers: Shinnosuke Abe (Yomiuri Giants), Atsuya Furuta (Tokyo Yakult Swallows), Kenji Johjima (Fukuoka Daiei Hawks)\n\nInfielders: Kazuya Fukuura (Chiba Lotte Marines), Hirokazu Ibata (Chunichi Dragons), Makoto Imaoka (Hanshin Tigers), Akinori Iwamura (Tokyo Yakult Swallows), Hiroyuki Nakajima (Seibu Lions), Toshihisa Nishi (Yomiuri Giants), Michihiro Ogasawara (Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters)\n\nOutfielders: Norihiro Akahoshi (Hanshin Tigers), Takahiro Saeki (Yokohama Bay Stars), Shigenobu Shima (Hiroshima Toyo Carp), Hitoshi Tamura (Yokohama Bay Stars), Kazuhiro Wada (Seibu Lions)\n\nCoaching Staff: Sadaharu Oh (Fukuoka Daiei Hawks), Takao Obana (Fukuoka Daiei Hawks), Hiromasa Arai (Fukuoka Daiei Hawks)\n\nNote: Fan selections Kosuke Fukudome (Chunichi Dragons), Yoshinobu Takahashi (Yomiuri Giants), Tsuyoshi Shinjo (Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters), Nobuhiko Matsunaka (Fukuoka Daiei Hawks), Tomohiro Nioka (Yomiuri Giants), Hiroki Kokubo (Yomiuri Giants), plus manager selection Tadahito Iguchi (Fukuoka Daiei Hawks) did not participate due to sickness and/or injury.\n\nStarting on November 5, 2004, the two teams played three games in three days at Tokyo Dome. They took a day off to travel to Fukuoka, located in southwestern Japan. After a single game there, they migrated east to Osaka for a game the next day. The very next day they flew up to the northernmost island of Hokkaido to play a game in Sapporo. Then it was down to Nagoya in central Japan, followed by a day of rest. The series wrapped up where it started, in Tokyo, on November 14.\n\nGame 1: November 5, Tokyo Dome\n\nAmong those in attendance were Japanese-born major-league players Kazuo Matsui (New York Mets), Tomo Ohka (Montreal Expos), and Shingo Takatsu (Chicago White Sox). Also celebrating the opening of the tournament was the US ambassador to Japan, Howard H. Baker Jr., who said the tour was beginning to take on an atmosphere similar to the World Series in recent years.2\n\nMuch of the focus in this game was on MLB starter Roger Clemens, who at age 42 had already won six Cy Young Awards in his illustrious career. It took the NPB All-Stars until the bottom of the fifth inning to open the scoring with two runs (one earned) off Clemens. Japanese shortstop Hirokazu Ibata said after the game that Clemens felt a lot closer to home plate than regular pitchers do because of his intimidating size.3 Kenji Johjima said Clemens was beyond the realm of good pitchers: His fastball was fast, his forkball was amazing, and he was grateful to just make contact with his pitches.4 Clemens left the game before finishing the fifth inning, much to his dismay. He said it was hard for him to figure out the hitters, with this being his first time ever facing them, but that, all things considered, he felt he had done well.5\n\nThe major leaguers, who had been stymied by starter Koji Uehara up to this point, put up three runs in the top of the sixth. David Ortiz singled home Carl Crawford and Hank Blalock, and the pinch-runner for Ortiz, Brad Wilkerson, scored on Vernon Wells’s sacrifice fly. Ortiz said he had noticed that Uehara’s forkball was coming in low on other batters, but the one he got hold of stayed up in the zone. That said, he felt that if Uehara were able to adjust to the major league strike zone and get ahead in counts, he would have no problems succeeding in America.6\n\nThe MLB All-Stars put up four more runs in the top of the seventh on five singles and a walk, all coming against Kazuo Yamaguchi, to win 7-2. Kiko Calero earned the win by completing the fifth inning for Clemens.\n\nAfter the game, Clemens said, “I really enjoyed it but I was surprised that the crowd was more quiet compared to last time I visited here (1992).”7 Manager Bruce Bochy said Ortiz was the spark plug that helped his team overcome a two-run deficit, and that they would need to keep playing this way in order to win more games in this series.8 Japanese manager Sadaharu Oh said he had hoped his team would win while the major leaguers were still adjusting to Japan, but that they would need to hit better. He also had high praise for the MLB hitters’ bat speed.9\n\nThis game was of added interest because Uehara grew up idolizing Clemens and even attended Game Three of the 2004 National League Championship Series in Houston, for which Clemens was the Astros’ starter. “There was a lot I could learn by watching the game live. But I would not have gone all that way if I wasn’t also interested in pitching there someday,” Uehara said.10 The two were able to sit down and talk to each other on November 3 when the MLB team arrived in Japan, and Clemens signed a jersey and gave it to Uehara. “I have never before and will probably never again pay that much attention to how another pitcher goes about his business on the mound during the game,” an awestruck Uehara said after the game. “I have tried to model my own form after his. The signed uniform will get framed and hung in my house.”11\n\nGame 2: November 6, Tokyo Dome\n\nThe first-ever Japanese major-league player, left-handed pitcher Masanori Murakami, threw out the ceremonial first pitch while wearing a San Francisco Giants uniform. The 60-year-old commented that he was looking forward to seeing a lot of good games in the series.12\n\nThe scoring in this seesaw battle began in the bottom of the first with Carl Crawford’s leadoff home run off starter Shunsuke Watanabe. The NPB All-Stars responded with Norihiro Akahoshi’s two-run triple in the top of the second.\n\nThe MLB team tied the game in the bottom of the frame, as Brad Wilkerson doubled Vernon Wells home. David Ortiz then hit the most talked-about home run of the entire tour in the bottom of the fourth, taking Watanabe deep to right. The estimated distance of his home run was 160 meters (525 feet). “I knew when I hit it that I got all of it,” Ortiz said. “I thought for a second that it might land in the Dominican (Republic).13 It was a 3-and-0 count, maybe he didn’t think I would swing. He’s not exactly like (MLB reliever) Takatsu, but pitchers like him who have an unorthodox delivery are hard to hit. But I saw the ball well, and he threw it right down the middle, so [hitting a home run] is to be expected.”14 Watanabe took the blow in stride, commenting, “It felt like he hit that ball almost twice the length of the stadium. You can’t make any mistakes against these guys.”15 He was even a little self-deprecatory, joking, “It actually felt good to be part of one of the best home runs ever hit.”16\n\nThe talk about Ortiz’s home run did not end there. Carl Crawford said, “If that building had not been a dome, there is no telling how far it would have traveled.”17 Daisuke Matsuzaka speculated that if they had used NPB regulation balls, which were livelier than MLB balls, the home run could have traveled more than 180 meters (590 feet).18 Bruce Bochy said it was the longest home run he had ever seen. Furthermore, Hirotoshi Ishii, who later in the game struck Ortiz out, said, “He looked mad at the end when I did not challenge him with my fastball. But I took the matchup seriously and after seeing what he did to the last fastball he faced, I could not dare to throw him another one.”19\n\nWith the Japanese down a run in the top of the fifth, Akahoshi scored on Akinori Iwamura’s single to tie the game, 3-3. After the game, Bochy had high praise for Akahoshi: “He’s an exciting player. Just like Crawford, he is able to make a difference with his speed and his bat. Very impressive.”20\n\nThe game was decided in the bottom of the eighth, as Victor Martinez and Wilkerson hit back-to-back RBI singles to help their team win 5-3. Said Ortiz: “We came here to win. We’re still a little tired, but we’re going to keep on playing hard.”21\n\nKyle Lohse started for the MLB team, surrendering three runs in 4⅔ innings. “We’re playing in (Hideki) Matsui’s home country. We have to be careful and throw well,” he commented postgame.22\n\nThe win went to Chris Reitsma, who pitched a clean eighth inning. Sadaharu Oh said that despite his team having a chance to win, the MLB squad was playing hard, too. He was glad that it was not a one-sided affair and hoped his team would do better the next day.23 As for Ortiz’s home run, he said with a smile, “It was perfect. His batting is all about power.”24\n\nGame 3: November 7, Tokyo Dome\n\nThe game was preceded by a home-run derby that featured two players from each team. The NPB team of Hitoshi Tamura and Akinori Iwamura won 6-4 against Manny Ramirez and Hank Blalock, and Iwamura expressed his excitement at being part of the showdown: “There was a different kind of nervousness and tension during the derby. I felt goosebumps when Ramirez told me afterward that I should give the majors a try.”25\n\nMoises Alou and Vernon Wells opened the scoring in the top of the fourth by hitting back-to-back home runs off NPB starter Kei Igawa. Alou’s home run gave him and his father, Felipe, bragging rights as the second father-son duo to both hit home runs during tours of Japan. Felipe hit four homers during the 1960 tour.26 The Griffeys were the first to do this with the father hitting two during the Reds’ 1978 tour and the son hitting one in 1990. Moises had this to say about his home run: “I was waiting on a fastball but he threw me a changeup. I am not sure how I stayed back on it, but I’m glad it left the park.”27\n\nTeam Japan responded with a run in the fifth, as Kazuhiro Wada knocked in Norihiro Akahoshi. They tied the game in the sixth, thanks to doubles by Hitoshi Tamura and Kazuya Fukuura, followed by an RBI single from Akinori Iwamura. However, Wells knocked in two more runs in the top of the eighth on a double, and then Johnny Estrada and Brad Wilkerson opened the ninth with back-to-back home runs to seal the 7-3 win for the Major League team. Kazuhisa Ishii made the start against his countrymen, allowing just one run in five innings of work. His comments after the game were telling of the level of competition up to this point in the series: “I hope someone as good as (Yankees outfielder) Hideki Matsui comes out of Japan soon. Not just some guy who can hit 30 home runs, but a player who enraptures baseball fans.”28\n\nRay King collected the win. Igawa said he enjoyed playing against the MLB representatives. “Obviously, I would have preferred to keep them off the board, but I really enjoyed the game atmosphere. I just followed (catcher) Furuta’s signs, and threw inside a lot. I jammed them a lot and felt like I was able to keep them off the bases for the most part.”29 Alou had high praise for Igawa despite the home run: “He’s great. His fastball, off-speed pitches, control, everything was good.”30 Bruce Bochy also weighed in: “No problems whatsoever. He could play in the majors right away. He hits the corners really well.”31 Wells expressed his satisfaction with the results after the game: “I’m really glad I was able to contribute to the team’s win today. I’ll do anything to win. We’ve got 5 more games, and hopefully, we can win them all. I hope to use this time to make a name for us players, but also to give the Blue Jays a little more fan recognition in Japan, too.”32\n\nManny Ramirez left Japan after the game because of problems with his left hamstring. He played in Game 1, sat out Game 2, participated in the home-run derby on this day, and played a part of the game before cutting his tour short. “I tried to play to the end. But I decided it’s best for me to return now and rest. I regret not being able to participate until the end of the tour and I had a great time here.”33 According to the Japanese press, Ramirez requested a car wash and gas fill-up. He handed $1,000 to the clubhouse attendant, saying, “This should cover it, right? Keep the change.”34\n\nGame 4: November 9, Fukuoka Dome\n\nCarl Crawford reached base on a first-inning error, advanced to third on a throwing error, and scored on Hank Blalock’s single. Four hits later, including a two-run single by Moises Alou and an RBI double from Brad Wilkerson, the Major League All-Stars grabbed a four-run lead through one inning. “The first three games were all close ones, so we were glad to be able to put up runs early on and get ourselves a nice lead,” said Blalock, who added a solo home run the very next inning.35 “I was late on the first pitch, so I got my bat head out and just had to make a good swing.”36\n\nStarter Jake Peavy was strong through three innings but allowed a run in the fourth inning and another in the fifth. Still, manager Bochy had praise for his starter after the game. “To me, Peavy is one of the best pitchers in the game today. He has great stuff, is a great competitor and has a huge heart.”37\n\nThe Major League All-Stars replied to the NPB comeback attempt with single runs in the sixth and seventh – Alex Cora and David Ortiz, respectively, hit RBI doubles – to make the final score 7-2.\n\nAfter the game, Bochy talked about how the team was able to win all four games to this point. “The players are all on top of their games and doing their part, and that is why we’ve been able to win four straight. It’s just a collection of guys who know nothing but how to win, so we’ll just go out there again tomorrow with the same approach.”38\n\nGame 5: November 10, Osaka Dome\n\nIn the early hours of the day, Clemens received a call from the secretary-treasurer of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America, Jack O’Connell. He had just won his seventh Cy Young Award after a highly successful season with the Houston Astros. In a press conference before the game, he said, “It was neat receiving the call here early this morning. … I told him I never get tired of hearing his voice.”39\n\nIt was the Japanese team that opened the scoring in the second inning against Clemens on back-to-back RBI hits by Shigenobu Shima and Hiroyuki Nakajima. In all, Clemens allowed three runs on eight hits in 5⅔ innings of work. Though the day was all about Clemens and his accolades, the game itself was controlled by his counterpart, Hisashi Iwakuma, who threw seven innings of two-hit, one-run ball. The lone run he gave up – in his final inning – was produced almost entirely by outfielder Carl Crawford, who singled, stole second and third, and came home on a wild pitch. Japan used Hirotoshi Ishii, Ryota Igarashi, and Koji Mise in relief to shut the door on the major leaguers and earned their first win of the series, 3-1. Igarashi and Mise needed just one pitch apiece to record the game’s final two outs.\n\nIwakuma admitted to being nervous before the game: “I thought deeply about tonight’s game and only slept for about 30 minutes (last night). But once I got on the mound, I stopped thinking. I had fun out there, and I think the fans enjoyed themselves, too.”40 Bochy chimed in about the winning pitcher: “He shut us down tonight. His fastball and slider were on, but it was his control more than anything.”41 Oh agreed, saying, “Tonight was all about Iwakuma. He had great movement on his pitches and did not allow them to swing the way they wanted to.”42\n\nStill, after the game, Clemens was the hottest topic on both sides. Koji Uehara, who idolized Clemens in his playing days, received a signed glove from the veteran before the game. “What a waste, giving it to someone like me,” a grateful Uehara said. “It goes without saying that I’m going to treasure it.”43\n\nClemens hinted at the possibility of retirement, but left the door open, saying, “I know there are some people in the Houston organization who want to talk to me. I just don’t know yet.”44 He continued, “This first month is going to be about taking a vacation. After that, I will spend a few months talking to friends and family about it. I will leave myself a 1 percent window to come back, but if this is how I retire, I will have absolutely no regrets about it.”45\n\nGame 6: November 11, Sapporo Dome\n\nThe MLB team got a foretaste of a future major-league pitcher named Daisuke Matsuzaka, who kept them at bay the entire game. His lone blemish was in the sixth, when consecutive hits by Carl Crawford and Jack Wilson combined to plate a run.\n\nBy then, though, the NPB All-Stars had already scored two runs off Mark Redman plus another one, unearned, off Kyle Lohse. Redman said after the game that “[on] the whole, I thought I pitched well. I made a few mistakes, though, and it took me a while to get used to the mound.”46\n\nIn the eighth, the NPB stars got two insurance runs off Francisco Rodriguez, including Japan’s first home run of the series, a solo shot to right by Takahiro Saeki. Saeki admitted that he got a bit of a hint from Ortiz, though. During Game 4, when he led off the top of the third inning right after Ortiz recorded the third out of the previous frame, Saeki said, he noticed Ortiz’s footprints at the very back of the batter’s box. “He stood so far back, and I thought I would try to do what he did and see if I could buy myself a bit more time to see the ball.”47\n\nMatsuzaka was ecstatic after the 5-1 win, saying, “I had been waiting a long time for this day. It felt so good when we recorded the final out and got the win. Even though I was anxious to get up on the mound, I was able to stay calm the entire way.”48 He continued, “I was hoping to face Ramirez and Ortiz but I still feel satisfied because I beat a very good major-league lineup.”49 When asked about the possibility of playing in the majors, he made his intentions clear: “I’ve already said that I want to play over there, so I really needed to put on a good show tonight.”50 … “The sooner I can play over there, the better. That’s why I wanted so badly to pitch well tonight.”51\n\nMany on the MLB squad believed Matsuzaka was ready, too. Bochy said, “Without question he could pitch in the major leagues. He has four major-league pitches, he has a good idea of what he’s doing on the mound. It’s hard to compare him to anybody because of his unique delivery.”52 Pitching coach Jim Colborn added, “He mixes speeds better than major-league pitchers. Our hitters were not able to figure out their timing. There is no doubt his stuff will work in the majors.”53\n\nThe hitters also praised Matsuzaka lavishly. Cabrera said his fastball in particular was unhittable, and said, “Hats off to him.”54 Wilson said about his hit off Matsuzaka, “I got lucky. His slider was especially amazing.”55\n\nMatsuzaka’s own manager, Sadaharu Oh, said, “He mixed speeds well and kept them off their game. He is the kind of pitcher that takes responsibility for the job he is given. The fact that he went the distance at this time of year is amazing.”56\n\nMatsuzaka became the first Japanese pitcher in 51 years to throw a complete-game win against an all-star team of major leaguers. It was previously achieved by Atsushi Aramaki in 1953. (Kazuhisa Kawaguchi did it to the Baltimore Orioles on October 27, 1984.)57\n\nGame 7: November 12, Nagoya Dome\n\nNeither starter went particularly deep, though it wasn’t due to ineffectiveness. Kazuhisa Ishii threw two shutout innings before giving the mound up to Jason Marquis. Koji Uehara went five scoreless innings and then gave way to the bullpen. The MLB Stars opened the scoring in the top of the seventh as reliever Koji Mise walked two and gave up a hit to load the bases. Consecutive sacrifice flies by Johnny Estrada and Brian Giles each plated a run. However, Marquis gave up a single run in the bottom of the eighth to end his time on the mound after six innings.\n\nMaking his return to his former home ballpark, Akinori Otsuka took the mound in the ninth and gave up two runs. A walk-off single by Michihiro Ogasawara gave the NPB All-Stars a 3-2 victory. Ogasawara had worked a 3-and-1 count on a questionable call by the umpire. After the game, Otsuka commented, “That was definitely a strike.”58 Ogasawara was practically in agreement, saying, “He froze me with that pitch. It was really good.”59 He also said he was so glad to have had his turn come around when it did. “I haven’t done much in this series so far, so it was nice to come up with a big hit in that situation.”60\n\nBochy recognized that it was a tough situation but wanted Otsuka out there for the last inning: “The Japanese batters were really good and that is what cost us the game. We know that one more win gives us the series, so I guess it’s going to come down to tomorrow. It’s a must-see game now, isn’t it?”61\n\nOtsuka reflected on his overall performance, saying, “I’m glad I am playing in America now because I get lit up by Japanese hitters.”62\n\nGame 8: November 14, Tokyo Dome\n\nBochy was all business before the game, saying, “We haven’t lost a series in Japan since 1990. If we don’t come through with a series win here, we can’t show our faces back home.”63 An NPB All-Stars win would have given them a series tie, though they would have needed a 10-run margin to take the tiebreaker (run differential).\n\nIt was not meant to be, as starter Kei Igawa served up two home runs: one in the fourth to David Ortiz and another in the fifth to Vernon Wells. He also gave up another run in the fifth inning on Hank Blalock’s single. Though Ortiz’s home run was not nearly as impactful as his blast earlier in the series, Kazuhiro Wada was still left in amazement: “The MLB ball does not carry well, and I thought for sure it was going to come down … but it just kept going until it cleared the fence. Unbelievable.”64\n\nTeam NPB’s best chances came in the fourth (runners on the corners with two outs) and ninth (runners on first and second, one out), but starter Jake Peavy and reliever Francisco Rodriguez prevented any runs from scoring as the MLB All-Stars won 5-0. Peavy allowed just two hits in his six innings of work. After the game, he said, “I took the mound as though it were Game 7 of the World Series.”65 … There was a different feel in the clubhouse today. We had the ‘A’ lineup out there. There was a lot on the line after losing the last three games.”66\n\nThe series was memorable for many of the MLB team representatives. David Ortiz talked about the many outstanding Japanese players and expressed a desire to return to Japan again should the opportunity present itself. One player in particular, the speedy Norihiro Akahoshi, caught his eye: “I would love to bring him home in my suitcase. He’s small enough to fit in there! If he comes to the majors, I want him on my team!”67 Akahoshi denied the request, pledging his loyalty to Hanshin for life. Ortiz instead stuffed his suitcase with other Japanese goods, like kimonos and soy sauce.68\n\nVernon Wells, who won Series MVP (.407 average, 2 home runs, 7 RBIs), said, “To play with these guys against the best in Japan has been a blast. Unfortunately, we made it a close series but we managed to win. We made it entertaining and that’s what we’re here for.”69 The MVP Award earned him a new Honda Legend worth around 6 million yen. He keyed his comments on Akinori Iwamura, who also received an award for Outstanding Player for his .440 average and 7 stolen bases, which tied a series record. “Everyone is calling him Japanese A-Rod. Come to America soon!”70\n\nIwamura, who stole only eight bases in 138 regular-season games in 2004, received compliments and invitations from several others. Manny Ramirez said, “When are you coming to the majors?”71 The 25-year-old Iwamura responded via the press, saying, “I am starting to realistically consider it. I’d love to go over there before I reach my prime, if possible.”72 He did, in fact, reach the majors in 2007 and stayed until 2010.\n\nDaisuke Matsuzaka also talked enthusiastically about the prospects of playing in the majors: “I’ve always had a strong desire to do it.”73 Wells gave that sentiment his stamp of approval, saying, “If I get a chance to face him again, I’m going to have to do a better job of hitting the ball!”74\n\nNPB catcher Atsuya Furuta declared that the Japanese still had work to do before they could catch up with major leaguers. “We had a chance to stop them but could not quite do it. There is still a gap between the leagues. The number of elite players is incomparable.”75\n\nManager Oh agreed to an extent: “The gap in technique and skill is lessening. Now we need to do something about power and game preparation.”76\n\nThe major-league team earned a million dollars ($500,000 for winning the series and $100,000 for each win from game sponsors). Its players each got $120,000 to come to Japan.\n\nAs the final MLB tour of Japan held before the inaugural World Baseball Classic in 2006 (which Japan won), this would arguably be the last time that Japanese baseball was viewed as “inferior” to the North American product. Nine of the 28 players on the 2004 All-Nippon Professional Baseball team also represented Japan in that first WBC. Ultimately, eight of the players on the 2004 team would play professional baseball for a US major-league (or affiliate) team in the first decade of the twenty-first century.\n\n(Click images to enlarge)\n\nNotes\n\n1 Rob Smaal, “Martinez Breaks Up Tie as Big Leaguers Bag Game 2,” Japan Times, November 7, 2004: 20.\n\n2 Shigeki Goto, “Kuremensu saikō no sutāto!
