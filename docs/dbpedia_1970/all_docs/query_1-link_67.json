        "text": "Incidence of Elbow Ulnar Collateral Ligament Surgery in Collegiate Baseball Players\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRothermich, Marcus A.; Conte, Stan A.; Aune, Kyle T.; Fleisig, Glenn S.; Cain, E. Lyle; Dugas, Jeffrey R.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBackground: Recent reports have highlighted the progressive increase in the incidence of ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injuries to the elbow in baseball players of all levels. However, knowledge of the incidence and other epidemiological factors regarding UCL injuries, specifically in college baseball players, is currently lacking. Purpose: To evaluate, over a period of 1 year, the incidence of UCL injuries requiring surgery in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I baseball programs. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: A total of 155 Division I collegiate baseball programs agreed to participate in the study. Demographics (position, year, background [location of high school]) for all players on these rosters were obtained from public websites. At the conclusion of the 2017 collegiate baseball season, the athletic trainer for each program entered anonymous, detailed information on injured players through an electronic survey into a secured database. Results: All 155 teams enrolled in the study completed the electronic survey. Of the 5295 collegiate baseball players on these rosters, 134 underwent surgery for an injured UCL (2.5% of all eligible athletes), resulting in a team surgery rate of 0.86 per program for 1 year. These 134 players came from 88 teams, thus 56.8% of the study teams underwent at least 1 surgery during the year. The surgery rate was 2.5 per 100 player-seasons for all players and was significantly higher among pitchers (4.4/100 player-seasons) than nonpitchers (0.7/100 player-seasons). The surgery rate was also significantly higher in underclassmen (3.1/100 player-seasons among freshmen and sophomores) than upperclassmen (1.9/100 player-seasons among juniors and seniors) (incidence rate ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4). Players from traditionally warm-weather states did not undergo UCL surgery at a significantly different rate from players from traditionally cold-weather states (2.7/100 player-seasons vs 2\n\nIncidence of Elbow Ulnar Collateral Ligament Surgery in Collegiate Baseball Players.\n\nPubMed\n\nRothermich, Marcus A; Conte, Stan A; Aune, Kyle T; Fleisig, Glenn S; Cain, E Lyle; Dugas, Jeffrey R\n\n2018-04-01\n\nRecent reports have highlighted the progressive increase in the incidence of ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injuries to the elbow in baseball players of all levels.

All patients undergoing hip arthroscopy were prospectively assessed with the modified Harris Hip Score. On review of all procedures performed over a 12-year period, 44 hips were identified among 41 intercollegiate or professional baseball players who had achieved 2-year follow-up. Among the 41 players, follow-up averaged 45 months (range, 24 to 120 months), with a mean age of 23 years (range, 18 to 34Â years). There were 23 collegiate (1 bilateral) and 18 professional (2 bilateral) baseball players, including 10 Major League Baseball players. Of the 8 Major League Baseball pitchers, 6 (75%) also underwent ulnar collateral ligament elbow surgery. Improvement in the modified Harris Hip Score averaged 13 points (from 81 points preoperatively to 94 points postoperatively); a paired-samples t test determined that this mean improvement of 13 points was statistically significant (P < .001). Players returned to baseball after 42 of 44 procedures (95%) at a mean of 4.3 months (range, 3 to 8 months), with 90% regaining the ability to participate at their previous level of competition. There were no complications. Three players (1 bilateral) underwent repeat arthroscopy. This study supports the idea that arthroscopic treatment for a variety of hip pathologies in high-level baseball players provides a successful return to sport and improvement in functional outcome scores.

This speed-accuracy trade-off (SATO) is evident across a number of throwing groups but remains poorly understood. The goal was to describe the SATO in baseball and cricket players and determine the speed that optimizes accuracy. 20 grade-level baseball and cricket players performed 10 throws at 80% and 100% of maximal throwing speed (MTS) toward a cricket stump. Baseball players then performed a further 10 throws at 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% of MTS toward a circular target. Baseball players threw faster with greater accuracy than cricket players at both speeds. Both groups demonstrated a significant SATO as vertical error increased with increases in speed; the trade-off was worse for cricketers than baseball players. Accuracy was optimized at 70% of MTS for baseballers. Throwing athletes should decrease speed when accuracy is critical. Cricket players could adopt baseball-training practices to improve throwing performance.\n\nAnthropometric and performance comparisons in professional baseball players.\n\nPubMed\n\nHoffman, Jay R; Vazquez, Jose; Pichardo, Napoleon; Tenenbaum, Gershon\n\n2009-11-01\n\nThis study compared anthropometric and performance variables in professional baseball players and examined the relationship between these variables and baseball-specific performance (i.e., home runs, total bases, slugging percentage, and stolen bases). During a 2-year period, 343 professional baseball players were assessed for height, weight, body composition, grip strength, vertical jump power, 10-yard sprint speed, and agility. Subject population consisted of players on the rosters of one of the minor league affiliates (Rookie, A, AA, AAA) or major league team (MLB). All testing occurred at the beginning of spring training. Players in Rookie and A were significantly (p < 0.05) leaner than players in MLB and AAA. These same players had significantly lower lean body mass than seen in MLB, AAA, and AA players. Greater grip strength (p < 0.05) was seen in MLB and AAA than in Rookie and A. Players in MLB were also faster (p < 0.05) than players in AA, A, and Rookie. Vertical jump power measures were greater (p < 0.05) in MLB than AA, A, and Rookie. Regression analysis revealed that performance measures accounted for 25-31% of the variance in baseball-specific power performance. Anthropometric measures failed to add any additional explanation to the variance in these baseball-specific performance variables. Results indicated that both anthropometric and performance variables differed between players of different levels of competition in professional baseball. Agility, speed, and lower-body power appeared to provide the greatest predictive power of baseball-specific performance.\n\nArm pain in youth baseball players: a survey of healthy players.\n\nPubMed\n\nMakhni, Eric C; Morrow, Zachary S; Luchetti, Timothy J; Mishra-Kalyani, Pallavi S; Gualtieri, Anthony P; Lee, Randall W; Ahmad, Christopher S\n\n2015-01-01\n\nOveruse injury in youth baseball players is increasing in prevalence, and these injuries have been correlated to pitching mechanics and pitch counts/types. Prior studies regarding arm pain in these athletes have focused simply on presence or absence of pain during the season rather than on detailed factors related to arm pain with respect to frequency, severity, and associated performance and psychosocial effect. The goal of this study was to investigate frequency, quality, and effect of arm pain in healthy youth baseball players. The hypothesis was that arm pain will affect a majority of healthy baseball players and will be associated with adverse psychosocial effects. Descriptive epidemiological study. A novel survey focusing on arm pain in youth baseball players was developed for the purpose of this study. Survey questions were formulated by a consortium of trainers, clinicians, and coaches. Surveys were administered to healthy youth baseball players throughout the states of New Jersey and New York. A total of 203 healthy players completed the survey; 23% of players (n=47) reported a prior overuse injury. Only 26% and 20% of players reported that their arm never hurt when throwing or the day after throwing, respectively; 30% of players reported that arm pain at least sometimes caused them to have less fun playing; and 46% of players reported at least once being encouraged to keep playing despite having arm pain. Pitchers were more likely to report arm pain while throwing and the day after throwing and to indicate that arm pain held them back from being a better player (all P<.05). Those with prior overuse injury were more likely to have arm pain while throwing, to have arm fatigue during a game or practice, and to be encouraged to keep playing despite having pain (all P<.05). A majority of healthy (actively competing) youth baseball players report at least some baseline arm pain and fatigue, and many players suffer adverse psychosocial effects from this pain. Â\n\nLittle League Baseball and Players' Self-Esteem.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHawkins, Donna B.; Gruber, Joseph J.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nThe effect of a season of little league baseball on the self-esteem of 94 pre-adolescent players was investigated. The Coopersmith Self-esteem Inventory and a newly devised Baseball-Self scale were administered. Significant improvements in players' total Self-esteem, Home-Parents and School-Academic scores were found. (Author/PN)\n\nA comparison of static near stereo acuity in youth baseball/softball players and non-ball players.\n\nPubMed\n\nBoden, Lauren M; Rosengren, Kenneth J; Martin, Daniel F; Boden, Scott D\n\n2009-03-01\n\nAlthough many aspects of vision have been investigated in professional baseball players, few studies have been performed in developing athletes. The issue of whether youth baseball players have superior stereopsis to nonplayers has not been addressed specifically. The purpose of this study was to determine if youth baseball/softball players have better stereo acuity than non-ball players. Informed consent was obtained from 51 baseball/softball players and 52 non-ball players (ages 10 to 18 years). Subjects completed a questionnaire, and their static near stereo acuity was measured using the Randot Stereotest (Stereo Optical Company, Chicago, Illinois). Stereo acuity was measured as the seconds of arc between the last pair of images correctly distinguished by the subject. The mean stereo acuity score was 25.5 +/- 1.7 seconds of arc in the baseball/softball players and 56.2 +/- 8.4 seconds of arc in the non-ball players. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.00001). In addition, a perfect stereo acuity score of 20 seconds of arc was seen in 61% of the ball players and only 23% of the non-ball players (P = 0.0001). Youth baseball/softball players had significantly better static stereo acuity than non-ball players, comparable to professional ball players.\n\nAnthropometric Characteristics of Columbia, South Carolina, Youth Baseball Players and Dixie Youth World Series Players\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFrench, Karen E.; Spurgeon, John H.; Nevett, Michael E.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to compare measures of body size in two samples of youth baseball players with normative data from the United States National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) growth charts. One sample of youth baseball players participated in a local little league. The second sample of youth baseball players were members of eightâ¦\n\nRelationship between performance variables and baseball ability in youth baseball players.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakata, Hiroki; Nagami, Tomoyuki; Higuchi, Takatoshi; Sakamoto, Kiwako; Kanosue, Kazuyuki\n\n2013-10-01\n\nThe present study investigated the relationship of performance variables and anthropometric measurements on baseball ability in 164 youth baseball players (age: 6.4-15.7 years). To evaluate their baseball performance, ball speeds in pitching and batting were recorded and kinetic energies of the pitched and hit balls were calculated. To record anthropometric and physical fitness characteristics, height and weight were measured and a battery of physical fitness tests covering standing long jump, side steps, sit-ups, 10-m sprint, trunk flexion, back strength, and grip strengths of both hands were conducted. The results of a multiple regression analysis revealed several significant predictors: age, body mass index (BMI), standing long jump, 10-m sprint, and grip strength for pitched ball kinetic energy and age, BMI, standing long jump, and back strength for hit ball kinetic energy. This study provides scientific evidence that relates certain specific physical performance tests and body characteristics with high achievement in the actual performance of pitching and batting. Youth players, their parents, coaches, and trainers would benefit by addressing these characteristics when planning training programs to improve the baseball performance of youth players.\n\nBaseball Players With an Ulnar Collateral Ligament Tear Display Increased Nondominant Arm Humeral Torsion Compared With Healthy Baseball Players.\n\nPubMed\n\nMeyer, Casey J; Garrison, J Craig; Conway, John E\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPrevious work has suggested that an increase in the amount of developmentally acquired, dominant arm humeral retrotorsion (D HRT) in the thrower's shoulder may be a potentially protective mechanism. Although the relationship between HRT and shoulder injuries has been reported, the relationship between HRT and ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) tears in baseball players is not known. To determine whether D HRT and nondominant arm HRT (ND HRT) measurements in baseball players with a UCL tear differ statistically from a matched healthy cohort. Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. D HRT and ND HRT were measured in 112 male competitive high school and collegiate baseball players seen over an 18-month period from 2013 to 2015. A total of 56 participants with a clinical and magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed diagnosis of a throwing-arm UCL tear (UCLInj group) were compared with 56 healthy baseball players with no history of an elbow injury who were matched for age, experience, and position (NUCLInj group). The mean ages in the UCLInj and NUCLInj groups were 17.9 Â± 2.2 and 17.6 Â± 2.8 years, respectively. Using a previously validated ultrasound method, D HRT and ND HRT were measured in the supine position, and the HRT side-to-side difference (D HRT - ND HRT) was calculated. A 1-way multivariate analysis of variance was used to determine the mean statistical differences between groups ( P < .05). Baseball players with a UCL tear displayed significantly more humeral torsion (ie, less retrotorsion) in their nondominant arm compared with healthy baseball players (UCLInj = 33.27Â° Â± 10.27Â°, NUCLInj = 27.82Â° Â± 10.88Â°; P = .007). Baseball players with a UCL tear did not display any differences in D HRT compared with healthy baseball players (UCLInj = 18.67Â° Â± 9.41Â°, NUCLInj = 17.09Â° Â± 9.92Â°; P = .391). Significant side-to-side differences in HRT existed between groups (UCLInj = -14.60Â° Â± 6.72Â°, NUCLInj = -10.72Â° Â± 6.88Â°; P = .003). There was a significant\n\nIncidence of injuries in high school softball and baseball players.\n\nPubMed\n\nShanley, Ellen; Rauh, Mitchell J; Michener, Lori A; Ellenbecker, Todd S\n\n2011-01-01\n\nParticipation in high school sports has grown 16.1% over the last decade, but few studies have compared the overall injury risks in girls' softball and boys' baseball. To examine the incidence of injury in high school softball and baseball players. Cohort study. Greenville, South Carolina, high schools. Softball and baseball players (n = 247) from 11 high schools. Injury rates, locations, types; initial or subsequent injury; practice or game setting; positions played; seasonal trends. The overall incidence injury rate was 4.5/1000 athlete-exposures (AEs), with more injuries overall in softball players (5.6/1000 AEs) than in baseball players (4.0/1000 AEs). Baseball players had a higher initial injury rate (75.9/1000 AEs) than softball players (66.4/1000 AEs): rate ratio (RR) = 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.4, 1.7. The initial injury rate was higher than the subsequent injury rate for the overall sample (P < .0001) and for softball (P < .0001) and baseball (P < .001) players. For both sports, the injury rate during games (4.6/1000 AEs) was similar to that during practices (4.1/1000 AEs), RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 0.7, 2.2. Softball players were more likely to be injured in a game than were baseball players (RR = 1.92, 95% CI = 0.8, 4.3). Most injuries (77%) were mild (3.5/1000 AEs). The upper extremity accounted for the highest proportion of injuries (63.3%). The incidence of injury for pitchers was 37.3% and for position players was 15.3%. The rate of injury was highest during the first month of the season (7.96/1000 AEs). The incidence of injury was low for both softball and baseball. Most injuries were minor and affected the upper extremity. The injury rates were highest in the first month of the season, so prevention strategies should be focused on minimizing injuries and monitoring players early in the season.\n\nIncidence of Injuries in High School Softball and Baseball Players\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShanley, Ellen; Rauh, Mitchell J.; Michener, Lori A.; Ellenbecker, Todd S.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nContext: Participation in high school sports has grown 16.1% over the last decade, but few studies have compared the overall injury risks in girls' softball and boys' baseball.

Cross-sectional. Laboratory. 30 collegiate baseball players with no recent history of upper extremity injury. Bilateral pronation, supination, wrist flexion, and wrist extension peak torque (PT) and peak torque to body weight (PT/BW) strength were measured at speeds of 90 and 180Â°/second. Paired t-tests showed that the throwing arm of baseball players produced significantly less PT/BW strength for supination at 90Â°/second compared to the non-throwing arm (PÂ =Â .001). The throwing arm produced significantly more PT/BW strength for pronation (PÂ =Â .001) at 180Â°/second compared to the non-throwing arm. Furthermore, the throwing arm had more PT and PT/BW strength for wrist extension (PÂ <Â .005) at 180Â°/second. Conversely, the throwing arm had less PT and PT/BW strength for supination (PÂ <Â .004) and wrist flexion (PÂ <Â .004) at 180Â°/second compared to the non-throwing arm. Significant bilateral strength differences exist in pronation, supination, wrist flexion, and wrist extension among collegiate baseball players. With the steady increase in ulnar collateral ligament injuries of the elbow among baseball players and the proven resistance to valgus force provided by the flexor-pronator mass of the elbow, the results of this study may prove beneficial in the prevention, evaluation, and rehabilitation of such dysfunctions.

Surgical injuries involving the ACL in youth, high school, collegiate, and professional baseball players were queried for an 11-year period (2001 to 2011). Over the study period, 42 baseball players were identified who had undergone arthroscopically assisted primary ACL reconstruction by 1 of 3 attending surgeons. Retrospective chart review was performed for all 42 patients to evaluate variables of age, level of competition, position, mechanism of injury, graft choice, and associated meniscal injuries. Twenty-six patients were reached for telephone survey and International Knee Documentation Committee questionnaire and they answered questions about their original injury and playing history. The most common mechanism of injury was fielding, followed by base running. Infielders and outfielders (32% each) were the most commonly injured position, followed by pitchers (29%). Among the 32 players for whom it could be determined, 30 (94%) were able to return to playing baseball at a mean follow-up of 4.2Â years (range 1.0 to 9.9Â years). The mean International Knee Documentation Committee score was 84.0 (range 63 to 91). Among the 26 patients contacted for telephone interview, no one required revision ACL surgery, but 3 required a subsequent procedure for meniscal tear. Twenty-five patients (96%) denied any episodes of instability in the knee after reconstruction. The overwhelming majority of baseball players that sustain ACL injuries do so while fielding or base running. Outfielders are significantly more likely than infielders to suffer ACL injuries while fielding versus base running. The results with respect to return to play are promising, as nearly all patients were able to return to baseball and none required a revision ACL surgery at a mean follow\n\nHip and Groin Injuries in Baseball Players.\n\nPubMed\n\nMlynarek, Ryan A; Coleman, Struan H\n\n2018-03-01\n\nTo discuss the clinical significance of the most common hip and groin injuries in baseball players, as well as an algorithmic approach to diagnosis and treatment of these injuries. (a) Limitations in throwing velocity, pitch control, and bat swing speed may be secondary to decreased mobility and strength within the proximal kinetic chain, which must harness power from the lower extremities and core. (b) Approximately 5.5% of all baseball injuries per year involve the hip/groin and may lead to a significant amount of time spent on the disabled list. Injuries involving the hip and groin are relatively common in baseball players. Our knowledge of the mechanics of overhead throwing continues to evolve, as does our understanding of the contribution of power from the lower extremities and core. It is paramount that the team physician be able to accurately diagnose and treat injuries involving the hip/groin, as they may lead to significant disability and inability to return to elite levels of play. This review focuses on hip- and groin-related injuries in the baseball player, including femoroacetabular impingement, core muscle injury, and osteitis pubis.\n\nMild traumatic brain injury in major and Minor League Baseball players.\n\nPubMed\n\nGreen, Gary A; Pollack, Keshia M; D'Angelo, John; Schickendantz, Mark S; Caplinger, Roger; Weber, Kathleen; Valadka, Alex; McAllister, Thomas W; Dick, Randall W; Mandelbaum, Bert; Curriero, Frank C\n\n2015-05-01\n\nAlthough mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is not as common in professional baseball as in collision sports, it does occur and frequently results in significant loss of time away from the sport. To date, no study has investigated MTBI among an entire cohort of professional baseball players. To investigate MTBIs in major and minor league baseball players to determine the most common mechanisms of injury, activity at time of injury, position, level of play, and time lost, as well as ultimately inform prevention efforts. A secondary objective was to document the association between MTBI and return to play using several different measures. Descriptive epidemiologic study. Data were captured from a newly implemented league-wide injury surveillance system that records injuries among all professional baseball players as entered by certified athletic trainers and physicians. The MTBIs were identified with respect to level of play, activity, field location, and mechanism of injury. Time loss was assessed by 3 measures of return to play, and MTBI game rates were reported as injuries per 1000 athlete-exposures. Data were combined over the 2011-2012 seasons for analysis, and results were presented separately for minor and major league players. Chi-square tests were used to test the hypothesis of equal proportions between the various categories of MTBI injury characteristics. There were 41 reported MTBIs in the major leagues and 266 in the minor leagues over the 2-year period under study. The overall MTBI game rate across both major and minor league ball clubs was 0.42 per 1000 athlete-exposures. The median time lost was 9 days. Mild traumatic brain injury accounted for 1% of all injuries resulting in time lost from play. For MTBIs that occurred while fielding, catchers were significantly overrepresented. No differences were noted among the 3 measures of time lost. Mild traumatic brain injury is an important problem in professional baseball players, especially for catchers\n\nPrevalence of posterior elbow problems in Japanese high school baseball players.\n\nPubMed\n\nKida, Yoshikazu; Morihara, Toru; Furukawa, Ryuhei; Sukenari, Tsuyoshi; Kotoura, Yoshihiro; Yoshioka, Naoki; Hojo, Tatsuya; Oda, Ryo; Arai, Yuji; Sawada, Koshiro; Fujiwara, Hiroyoshi; Kubo, Toshikazu\n\n2016-09-01\n\nVarious posterior elbow problems cause posterior elbow pain among baseball players. We aimed to determine the prevalence and diagnoses associated with posterior elbow problems and post-treatment recovery time for returning to sports in Japanese high school baseball players when treated in the off-season. A total of 576 Japanese high school baseball players who participated in baseball skill training camp during the off-season were enrolled in the study. The elbow of each player's throwing arm was assessed by use of a questionnaire and physical examination. Players with abnormal results were advised to visit the hospital. Players who visited the hospital were initially treated conservatively and underwent surgery if necessary. Retrospectively, players with positive physical examination results associated with posterior elbow pain, defined as olecranon tenderness and/or a positive elbow extension impingement test, were selected. Information about their position, elbow pain, physical examination results, diagnosis, treatment, and recovery time before returning to playing sports was assessed. Olecranon tenderness and/or positive elbow extension impingement test results were found in 76 players (13.2%). Of these, 33 agreed to visit the hospital for further diagnostic imaging and 25 players (75.8%) were diagnosed with posteromedial elbow impingement. By the next spring, 87.9% of players returned to sport, and 100% of players returned to sport before the next summer. The average recovery period was 77âÂ±â47 days. Physical examinations related to posterior elbow injuries were positive in 13.2% of high school baseball players. The most common diagnosis for posterior elbow pain was posteromedial elbow impingement. All players returned to competitive sports activity levels within 77âÂ±â47 days.

Research has shown that any decrease in vision is likely caused by low-order optical aberrations. This study is designed to validate the SVOne autorefractor, and describe the amount and type, of low-order optical aberrations present in a large cohort of professional baseball players. A retrospective chart review on the 608 Major League Baseball players evaluated during the 2016 Spring Training Season was performed. Results for a subset of players who had both manifest refraction as well as autorefraction were calculated. Subsequently, after determining the accuracy of the autorefraction system in this population, refractive results for the entire population were determined. There was a borderline statistically significant difference in mean spherical refractive error (M) between the manifest refraction and the SVOne auto refraction (-0.273D in the manifest refraction method vs. -0.503D in the SVOne method, P = .06) in the subset of athletes who underwent both tests. Additionally, there was no difference in the J0 or J45 cylindrical component vectors for each method. For the entire eligible population, the SVOne autorefraction system found a mean spherical refractive error (M) of -0.228D, a J0 value of -0.013D, and a J45 value of -0.040D. These data suggest that the SVOne autorefraction system is generally able to measure the refractive error in the baseball population. The system was slightly biased, often reporting more myopia in myopic subjects. Thus, careful evaluation of the refractive status of these athletes coupled with careful subjective refractive correction for those with less than average vision for baseball is strongly suggested.\n\nEpidemiology of shoulder and elbow pain in youth baseball players.\n\nPubMed\n\nMatsuura, Tetsuya; Suzue, Naoto; Iwame, Toshiyuki; Arisawa, Kokichi; Fukuta, Shoji; Sairyo, Koichi\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThere are relatively few published epidemiological studies examining the differences in the risk of shoulder and elbow pain in young baseball players. The purpose of this study was to investigate risk factors for shoulder and elbow pain in child and adolescent baseball players. A total of 1563 players aged 7 to 12Â years participated in this investigation. Subjects were asked whether they had experienced episodes of shoulder or elbow pain. We investigated the following risk factors for shoulder and elbow pain: age, position, years of baseball experience, and training hours per week. Data from the groups with and without shoulder and elbow pain were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression models. Among the 1563 participants, 15.9% and 29.2% reported episodes of shoulder and elbow pain, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that shoulder pain was associated with age 10, 11, and 12Â years, and that elbow pain was associated with age 10, 11, and 12Â years, playing catcher, and >2Â years of baseball experience. Training hours per week were not associated with either shoulder or elbow pain. In over 1000 baseball players aged 7 to 12Â years, 15.9% reported episodes of shoulder pain, while 29.2% reported elbow pain in the throwing arm. The associated risk factors were different for each type of pain. Shoulder pain was associated with increased age while elbow pain was associated with increased age, increased years of baseball experience, and playing catcher.\n\nLeft-handed skeletally mature baseball players have smaller humeral retroversion in the throwing arm than right-handed players.\n\nPubMed\n\nTakenaga, Tetsuya; Goto, Hideyuki; Sugimoto, Katsumasa; Tsuchiya, Atsushi; Fukuyoshi, Masaki; Nakagawa, Hiroki; Nozaki, Masahiro; Takeuchi, Satoshi; Otsuka, Takanobu\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIt is known that the humeral retroversion of baseball players is greater in the throwing arm than in the nonthrowing arm. An investigation measuring dry bone specimens also showed that the right humerus had greater retroversion than the left. Considering these facts, it was hypothesized that humeral retroversion would differ between right- and left-handed players. This study aimed to compare the bilateral humeral retroversion between right- and left-handed skeletally mature baseball players. We investigated 260 (196 right-handed and 64 left-handed) male baseball players who belonged to a college or amateur team. Bilateral humeral retroversion was assessed using an ultrasound-assisted technique (humeral torsion angle [HTA]) as described by previous studies. Analysis of covariance, adjusted for handedness and baseball position, assessed the effect of throwing arm dominance on HTA. In comparison of the throwing arm, HTA was significantly smaller in left-handed (left humerus) than in right-handed (right humerus) players (77Â° vs. 81Â°; Pâ<â.001). In comparison of the nonthrowing arm, HTA was significantly greater in left-handed (right humerus) than in right-handed (left humerus) players (73Â° vs. 69Â°; Pâ<â.001). The mean side-to-side difference of HTA was significantly smaller in left-handed than in right-handed players (3Â° vs. 12Â°; Pâ<â.001). Humeral retroversion of left-handed skeletally mature baseball players was significantly smaller in the throwing arm, greater in the nonthrowing arm, and smaller in side-to-side differences than that of right-handed players. These findings may be key to understanding some of the biomechanical differences between right- and left-handed baseball players.

However, onset of the thickening is unclear among young baseball players. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the thickness of the medial ulnar collateral ligament in junior high and high school baseball players. Seventy-one uninjured and asymptomatic junior high and high school baseball players were included in the study. Participants underwent physical examination after completing a questionnaire, followed by ultrasonographic evaluation. The thickness of the medial ulnar collateral ligament was measured bilaterally. The thickness of the throwing and non-throwing sides in high school and junior high school baseball players, and within each group, was compared and statistically analyzed. The medial ulnar collateral ligament in the throwing arm of high school baseball players was thicker than that in the non-throwing arm (5.5 vs. 4.4 mm), although no significant difference was seen in junior high school baseball players. High school baseball players showed a significantly thicker medial ulnar collateral ligament in the throwing arm than junior high school baseball players. Thickening of the medial ulnar collateral ligament in the throwing arm of asymptomatic and uninjured baseball players may begin by the time the players reach high school.\n\nPerformance enhancement among adolescent players after 10 weeks of pitching training with appropriate baseball weights.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Wen-Wen; Liu, Ya-Chen; Lu, Lee-Chang; Chang, Hsiao-Yun; Chou, Paul Pei-Hsi; Liu, Chiang\n\n2013-12-01\n\nCompared with regulation-weight baseballs, lightweight baseballs generate lower torque on the shoulder and elbow joints without altering the pitching movement and timing. This study investigates the throwing accuracy, throwing velocity, arm swing velocity, and maximum shoulder external rotation (MSER) of adolescent players after 10 weeks of pitching training with appropriate lightweight baseballs. We assigned 24 adolescent players to a lightweight baseball group (group L) and a regulation-weight baseball group (group R) based on their pretraining throwing velocity. Both groups received pitching training 3 times per week for 10 weeks with 4.4- and 5-oz baseballs. The players' throwing accuracy, throwing velocity, arm swing velocity, and MSER were measured from 10 maximum efforts throws using a regulation-weight baseball before and after undergoing the pitching training. The results showed that the players in group L significantly increased their throwing velocity and arm swing velocity (p < 0.05) after 10 weeks of pitching training with the 4.4-oz baseball, whereas group R did not (p > 0.05). Furthermore, the percentage change in the throwing velocity and arm swing velocity of group L was significantly superior to that of group R (p < 0.05). Thus, we concluded that the 10 weeks of pitching training with an appropriate lightweight baseball substantially enhanced the arm swing velocity and throwing velocity of the adolescent baseball players. These findings suggest that using a lightweight baseball, which can reduce the risk of injury without altering pitching patterns, has positive training effects on players in the rapid physical growth and technique development stage.\n\nDominant-limb range-of-motion and humeral-retrotorsion adaptation in collegiate baseball and softball position players.\n\nPubMed\n\nHibberd, Elizabeth E; Oyama, Sakiko; Tatman, Justin; Myers, Joseph B\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBiomechanically, the motions used by baseball and softball pitchers differ greatly; however, the throwing motions of position players in both sports are strikingly similar.

Baseball players had greater glenohumeral internal-rotation deficit, total-range-of-motion, and humeral-retrotorsion difference than softball players and male controls. There were no differences between glenohumeral internal-rotation deficit, total-range-of-motion, and humeral-retrotorsion difference in softball players and female controls. Few differences were evident between softball players and female control participants, although range-of-motion and humeral-retrotorsion adaptations were significantly different than baseball players.

To determine the OCD prevalence in adolescent competitive baseball players and to investigate the clinical characteristics of these patients. Cross-sectional and case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. A total of 2433 baseball players (mean age, 14.5 Â± 1.5 years) belonging to junior high school and high school baseball clubs were enrolled. Players completed a questionnaire, and the elbow of each player's throwing arm was assessed by ultrasonography. Participants with abnormal results on ultrasonography were further examined through radiographic study. The OCD lesions were classified into stages based on radiographic results, and demographic data were compared between players with and without OCD lesions. Osteochondritis dissecans of the humeral capitellum was found in 82 (3.4%) elbows by ultrasonography. Players with an OCD lesion began playing baseball at an earlier age (P = .016), had a longer duration of competitive play (P = .0013), and had experienced more present (P = .0025) and past (P < .0001) elbow pain compared with players without a lesion. There were no differences between the 2 groups in the position played (P = .26). Sixty-eight patients underwent further radiographic examination for OCD (radiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging). Of these players, 10 (14.7%) were classified as having stage I OCD (radiolucent stage); 26 (38.2%), stage II (fragmentation stage); 9 (13.2%), stage III (loose body stage); 9 (13.2%), stage IV (residual stage); and 14 (23.5%), stage V (postoperative stage). The prevalence of OCD of the humeral capitellum, including latent cases, was 3.4% among adolescent baseball players. Players with OCD lesions began playing baseball at earlier ages, had played for longer periods, and had experienced more elbow pain.

Previous research on dynamic balance in soccer players has shown that test performance depends on competition level. However, dynamic balance has yet to be examined in baseball players. Objective: To understand normative values and determine differences in dynamic balance, as measured by the Lower Quarter Y-Balance Test, across competition levels in baseball players. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Preseason physical examinations. Patients or Other Participants: Dynamic balance was measured in 88 high school (HS), 78 collegiate (COL), and 90 professional (PRO) baseball players. Main Outcome Measure(s): All participants completed the Lower Quarter Y-Balance Test using the standard protocol. In unilateral stance, they reached with 1 foot in the anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral directions. We calculated 1-way analyses of variance to compare performance, composite score, and reach asymmetry for each direction as well as the sum of the asymmetry values (P < .05). Composite score was calculated by averaging the maximum normalized reach scores. Reach asymmetry was determined by calculating bilateral differences in reach ability. Results: In comparison with the HS and COL groups, the PRO players exhibited greater posteromedial (P < .01; effect size index [ESI]HS = 1.06, ESICOL = 0.95) and posterolateral reach (P < .01; ESIHS = 0.82, ESICOL = 0.84) as well as a greater composite score (P < .01; ESIHS = 0.60, ESICOL = 0.87). In contrast, HS baseball players exhibited increased anterior reach (P < .01; ESICOL = 0.60, ESIPRO = 0.39) compared with the COL and PRO cohorts. No significant differences in reach asymmetry were observed among groups. Conclusions: Lower extremity dynamic balance performance differed based on the baseball players' competition level.

The prevalence of UCL reconstruction will be higher among pitchers than nonpitchers, and Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers will have a higher prevalence than will minor league pitchers. Descriptive epidemiology study. An online questionnaire was distributed to all 30 MLB organizations. Certified athletic trainers from each team administered the questionnaire to all players in the organization, including major league players and 6 levels of minor league players. Demographic data were compared between major and minor league players. Continuous variables (age, years of professional baseball, country of origin, etc) were compared with Student t tests (P < .05). Categorical variables (level, position, etc) were compared using chi-square analysis (P < .05). A total of 5088 professional baseball players (722 major league and 4366 minor league) participated in the survey. Pitchers represented 53% of all players, and 497 players reported at least 1 UCL reconstruction, demonstrating a prevalence rate of 10% (497 of 5088). Pitchers reported a significantly higher prevalence of UCL reconstruction (16%; 437 of 2706) than nonpitchers (3%; 60 of 2382; P < .001). Among major league pitchers, 25% (96 of 382) had a history of UCL reconstruction, while minor league pitchers showed a 15% (341 of 2324) prevalence (P < .001). Major league pitchers were also significantly older (28.8 Â± 3.9 years) than minor league pitchers (22.8 Â± 3.0; P < .001). The majority of major leaguers (86%) had their UCL reconstruction as professional pitchers, whereas the majority of minor league pitchers (61%) underwent their UCL reconstruction during high school and college (P < .001). The rates of UCL revision, prior elbow surgery, prior shoulder surgery, and types of UCL graft were similar\n\nAssessment of professional baseball players aerobic exercise performance depending on their positions.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Seung-Won\n\n2014-11-01\n\nThis study reports the average and SD of professional baseball players' cardiorespiratory endurance, maximum oxygen consumption, oxygen consumption during anaerobic threshold, maximum oxygen consumption of anaerobic threshold %, maximum heart rate, and heart rate of anaerobic threshold. We also report the comparison between pitchers and fielders. Considering the total number of results, percentile was used and results were classified into 5 grades. One professional baseball players' organization with more than 14 years of experience participated in this study. First, we observed that the average pitchers' V[Combining Dot Above]O2max was 53.64 mlÂ·kgÂ·min, whereas the average fielders' was 52.30 mlÂ·kgÂ·min. These values were lower than other sports players. Second, in case of the V[Combining Dot Above]O2AT, pitchers showed 39.35 mlÂ·kgÂ·min and fielders showed 39.96 mlÂ·kgÂ·min. %V[Combining Dot Above]O2AT showed a significant difference of 71.13% between pitchers and fielders-pitchers, whereas fielders showed 73.89% (p < 0.01). Third, maximal heart rates were measured at 188.69 bÂ·min (pitchers) and 187.79 bÂ·min (fielders). These were lower than college baseball players and higher than other sports players. In conclusion, both professional baseball pitchers and fielders should be aware of the necessity of systematic cardiorespiratory endurance data analysis. Moreover, baseball teams, athletic trainers, and coaches should also be aware of the importance of cardiorespiratory endurance.\n\nComparison of three baseball-specific 6-week training programs on throwing velocity in high school baseball players.\n\nPubMed\n\nEscamilla, Rafael F; Ionno, Michele; deMahy, M Scott; Fleisig, Glenn S; Wilk, Kevin E; Yamashiro, Kyle; Mikla, Tony; Paulos, Lonnie; Andrews, James R\n\n2012-07-01\n\nThrowing velocity is an important baseball performance variable for baseball pitchers, because greater throwing velocity results in less time for hitters to make a decision to swing. Throwing velocity is also an important baseball performance variable for position players, because greater throwing velocity results in decreased time for a runner to advance to the next base. This study compared the effects of 3 baseball-specific 6-week training programs on maximum throwing velocity. Sixty-eight high school baseball players 14-17 years of age were randomly and equally divided into 3 training groups and a nontraining control group. The 3 training groups were the Throwers Ten (TT), Keiser Pneumatic (KP), and Plyometric (PLY). Each training group trained 3 dÂ·wk(-1) for 6 weeks, which comprised approximately 5-10 minutes for warm-up, 45 minutes of resistance training, and 5-10 for cool-down. Throwing velocity was assessed before (pretest) and just after (posttest) the 6-week training program for all the subjects. A 2-factor repeated measures analysis of variance with post hoc paired t-tests was used to assess throwing velocity differences (p < 0.05). Compared with pretest throwing velocity values, posttest throwing velocity values were significantly greater in the TT group (1.7% increase), the KP group (1.2% increase), and the PLY group (2.0% increase) but not significantly different in the control group. These results demonstrate that all 3 training programs were effective in increasing throwing velocity in high school baseball players, but the results of this study did not demonstrate that 1 resistance training program was more effective than another resistance training program in increasing throwing velocity.\n\nRisk factors for shoulder and elbow pain in youth baseball players.\n\nPubMed\n\nMatsuura, Tetsuya; Iwame, Toshiyuki; Suzue, Naoto; Arisawa, Kokichi; Sairyo, Koichi\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThis study sought to quantify the 1-year cumulative incidence of shoulder and elbow pain among youth baseball players and identify risk factors associated with the occurrence of shoulder and elbow pain. In total, 900 youth baseball players (aged 7-11Â years) were enrolled in a 1-year prospective follow-up study. One year later, the players were asked whether they had experienced episodes of shoulder or elbow pain and the following risk factors for such pain were investigated: age, position, length of baseball experience, training hours per week, and history of shoulder or elbow pain. Data for the groups with and without shoulder or elbow pain were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression models. Episodes of shoulder pain were reported by 18.3% of players and episodes of elbow pain were reported by 35.2% of players. Multivariate analysis showed that shoulder pain was associated with pitcher position, catcher position, longer training hours per week, and history of shoulder and elbow pain, and that elbow pain was associated with age, pitcher position, catcher position, longer training hours per week, and history of elbow pain. Length of baseball experience was not associated with shoulder or elbow pain. History of elbow pain, pitcher position, catcher position, and longer training hours per week were associated with both types of pain. History of shoulder pain was associated with shoulder pain but not elbow pain. Age was associated with elbow pain but not shoulder pain.\n\nThe Epidemiology of Hip and Groin Injuries in Professional Baseball Players.\n\nPubMed\n\nColeman, Struan H; Mayer, Stephanie W; Tyson, Jared J; Pollack, Keshia M; Curriero, Frank C\n\n2016-01-01\n\nInjuries of the hip and groin among professional baseball players can result in a significant number of disabled list days. The epidemiology of these injuries has not been delineated. The purpose of this study is to describe the incidence, mechanism, type, and rehabilitation course of hip and groin injuries among Major League Baseball (MLB) and Minor League Baseball (MiLB) players. The MLB injury database for hip and groin injuries from 2011-2014 was analyzed. Occurrence of injuries was assessed based on level of play, field location, activity during which the injury occurred, mechanism of injury, and days missed. The treatment was recorded as nonoperative or surgical. The subsequent rehabilitation and return to play were recorded. Chi-square tests were used to test the hypothesis of equal proportions between the various categories of hip and groin characteristics. From 2011-2014, 1823 hip and groin injuries occurred among MLB and MiLB players, which accounted for approximately 5% of all injuries. Of these, 1514 (83%) occurred among MiLB players and 309 (17%) among MLB players; 96% of injuries were extra-articular. Among all players, a noncontact mechanism during defensive fielding was the most common activity causing injury (74%), and infielders experienced the most hip and groin injuries (34%). The majority of extra-articular injuries were treated nonoperatively (96.2%), resulting in an average of 12 days missed. Intra-articular pathology more commonly required surgery, and resulted in an average of 123 days missed. Hip and groin injuries can be debilitating and result in a significant number of days missed. Intra-articular pathology and athletic pubalgia were usually treated surgically, while the majority of extra-articular hip injuries were treated successfully with nonoperative modalities. Correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment can lead to a high rate of return to play for professional baseball players with injuries to the hip and groin.\n\nThe immediate effect of lumbar spine patterns of neuromuscular joint facilitation in young amateur baseball players.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuo, Ming; Maruyama, Hitoshi; Kaneko, Takasumi; Naito, Daiki; Koiso, Yuta\n\n2013-12-01\n\n[Purpose] The aim of the study was to investigate the changes in baseball pitching velocity, the functional reach test (FR) and the simple reaction times (SRT) in young amateur baseball players after lumbar spine patterns of neuromuscular joint facilitation (NJF) treatment. [Subjects] The subjects were 11 young amateur baseball players. An NJF intervention and a proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) intervention were performed. The interventions were performed one after the other with one week between them. The order of the interventions was completely randomized. [Methods] The baseball pitching velocity, the FR and the SRT were evaluated before and after treatment. [Results] In the NJF group, there were significant differences in baseball pitching velocity, FR and SRT after treatment. In the PNF group, there was a significant difference in SRT after treatment. [Conclusion] NJF intervention shortens the SRT, increases the baseball pitching velocity and FR, and may be recommended to improve performance in baseball players.\n\nTHORACOLUMBAR RANGE OF MOTION IN BASEBALL PITCHERS AND POSITION PLAYERS\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLynall, Robert; Williams, Jeffrey G.; Wong, Regan; Onuki, Takashi; Meister, Keith\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIntroduction/Background: Optimal baseball throwing mechanics require a significant contribution of thoracolumbar motion, particularly in the sagittal and transverse planes. This motion is key for proper transmission of forces from the lower to upper extremity, thereby minimizing a throwing athlete's risk of injury and maximizing athletic performance. Purpose: To define the activeâassisted thoracolumbar ROM of both baseball pitchers and position players and to compare these motions both within and between groups. Methods: Fiftyâsix asymptomatic, collegiate and minor league baseball pitchers and 42 position players volunteered to participate. Activeâassisted thoracolumbar flexion, extension, and bilateral rotation ROM, were measured in a standing position, using two bubble inclinometers. Twoâtailed t tests were used to determine differences in ROM between and within the pitchers and position players. Results: The pitchers had significantly more rotation to the nonâthrowing arm side as compared to the position players (p = .007, effect size = .61). The pitchers also had more rotation to the nonâthrowing arm side as compared to their throwing side (p = .006, effect size = .47). There were no other significant differences between the pitchers and the position players (p > .53). Furthermore, the position players did not have a sideâtoâside rotation difference (p = .99). Conclusions: Pitchers have a greater amount of rotation ROM towards the nonâthrowing arm side as compared to position players. Pitchers also have a greater amount of rotation ROM to the nonâthrowing arm side as compared to their throwing side rotation. Because pitchers often present with posterior shoulder tightness and subsequent altered shoulder horizontal adduction and internal rotation ROM, the increase in nonâthrowing side rotation ROM may occur in response to these adaptations. More specifically, this increase in nonâthrowing side trunk rotation ROM may allow such athletes to\n\nShoulder and elbow pain in elementary school baseball players: TheÂ results from a nation-wide survey in Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nTakagishi, Kenji; Matsuura, Tetsuya; Masatomi, Takashi; Chosa, Etsuo; Tajika, Tsuyoshi; Watanabe, Mikihiko; Iwama, Tetsu; Otani, Toshiro; Inagaki, Katsunori; Ikegami, Hiroyasu; Aoki, Mitsuhiro; Kato, Ko; Okuwaki, Toru; Sairyo, Koichi; Kameyama, Yasushi; Maeda, Akira; Beppu, Moroe\n\n2017-07-01\n\nDespite recommendations on how to prevent baseball injuries in youths by the Japanese Society of Clinical Sports Medicine, shoulder and elbow pain still frequently occurs in young baseball players. We conducted a questionnaire survey among baseball players at elementary schools across the country to understand the practice conditions of players, examining the risk factors of shoulder and elbow pain in baseball players. The questionnaire survey was conducted among elementary school baseball players as members of the Baseball Federation of Japan in September 2015. A total of 8354 players belonging to 412 teams (average age: 8.9) responded to the survey. Among 7894 players who did not have any shoulder and/or elbow pain in September 2014, elbow pain was experienced in 12.3% of them, shoulder pain in 8.0% and shoulder and/or elbow pain in 17.4% during the previous one year. A total of 2835 (39.9% of the total) practiced four days or more per week and 97.6% practiced 3Â h or more per day on Saturdays and Sundays. The risk factors associated shoulder and elbow pain included a male sex, older age, pitchers and catchers, and players throwing more than 50 balls per day. It has been revealed that Japanese elementary school baseball players train too much. Coaches should pay attention to older players, male players, pitchers and catchers in order to prevent shoulder and elbow pain. Furthermore, elementary school baseball players should not be allowed to throw more than 50 balls per day. Retrospective cohort study. Copyright Â© 2017 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association.

To determine the career length, performance, and return-to-play rates of professional baseball players after undergoing arthroscopy for symptomatic FAI. Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Forty-four professional baseball players (51 hips) underwent hip arthroscopy for FAI between 2000 and 2015 by a single surgeon. Data were retrieved for each player from MLB.com , MiLB.com , Baseballreference.com , and individual team websites. Age, surgical procedure, and intraoperative findings were also used in analysis. Return to play was defined as playing in a preseason or regular season major or minor league game after arthroscopy. Career length was measured as total years played before and after arthroscopy. Performance measures included earned run average for pitchers, batting average for position players, and games played for all players. Of the 44 players, there were 21 pitchers and 23 position players. Ninety-five percent (n = 42) were able to return to professional baseball after hip arthroscopy. The mean career length for all players was 9.5 years. The mean career length after return to play was 3.6 seasons (range, 1-14 seasons). Pitchers had a mean career length of 8.7 years (3.3 after surgery), and position players averaged a career length of 10 years (3.9 after surgery). There were no differences in performance measures between preinjury and postoperative values. Professional baseball players undergoing hip arthroscopy for FAI returned to sport and had similar performance as they did before injury. The average career length was 9.5 years. In our study cohort, more pitchers than position players underwent hip arthroscopy. Hip arthroscopy appears to be an effective surgical intervention, allowing for\n\nThe Youth Throwing Score: Validating Injury Assessment in Young Baseball Players.\n\nPubMed\n\nAhmad, Christopher S; Padaki, Ajay S; Noticewala, Manish S; Makhni, Eric C; Popkin, Charles A\n\n2017-02-01\n\nEpidemic levels of shoulder and elbow injuries have been reported recently in youth and adolescent baseball players. Despite the concerning frequency of these injuries, no instrument has been validated to assess upper extremity injury in this patient population. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to validate an upper extremity assessment tool specifically designed for young baseball players. We hypothesized that this tool will be both reliable and valid. Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2. The Youth Throwing Score (YTS) was constructed by an interdisciplinary team of providers and coaches as a tool to assess upper extremity injury in youth and adolescent baseball players (age range, 10-18 years). The psychometric properties of the test were then determined. A total of 223 players completed the final survey. The players' mean age was 14.3 Â± 2.7 years. Pilot analysis showed that none of the 14 questions received a mean athlete importance rating less than 3 of 5, and the final survey read at a Flesch-Kincaid level of 4.1, which is appropriate for patients aged 9 years and older. The players self-assigned their injury status, resulting in a mean instrument score of 59.7 Â± 8.4 for the 148 players \"playing without pain,\" 42.0 Â± 11.5 for the 60 players \"playing with pain,\" and 40.4 Â± 10.5 for the 15 players \"not playing due to pain.\" Players playing without pain scored significantly higher than those playing with pain and those not playing due to pain ( P < .001). Psychometric analysis showed a test-retest intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.90 and a Cronbach alpha intra-item reliability coefficient of 0.93, indicating excellent reliability and internal consistency. Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.65, 0.62, and 0.31 were calculated between the YTS and the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument sports/physical functioning module, the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic Shoulder and Elbow score, and the Quick Disabilities of the\n\nLong-term Outcomes After Ulnar Collateral Ligament Reconstruction in Competitive Baseball Players: Minimum 10-Year Follow-up.\n\nPubMed\n\nOsbahr, Daryl C; Cain, E Lyle; Raines, B Todd; Fortenbaugh, Dave; Dugas, Jeffrey R; Andrews, James R\n\n2014-06-01\n\nUlnar collateral ligament reconstruction (UCLR) has afforded baseball players with excellent results; however, previous studies have described only short-term outcomes. To evaluate long-term outcomes after UCLR in baseball players. Case series; Level of evidence, 4. All UCLRs performed on competitive baseball players with a minimum 10-year follow-up were identified. Surgical data were collected prospectively and patients were surveyed by telephone follow-up, during which scoring systems were used to assess baseball career and post-baseball career outcomes. Of 313 patients, 256 (82%) were contacted at an average of 12.6 years; 83% of these baseball players (90% pitchers) were able to return to the same or higher level of competition in less than 1 year, but results varied according to preoperative level of play. Baseball career longevity was 3.6 years in general and 2.9 years at the same or higher level of play, but major and minor league players returned for longer than did collegiate and high school players after surgery (P < .001). Baseball retirement typically occurred for reasons other than elbow problems (86%). Many players had shoulder problems (34%) or surgery (25%) during their baseball career, and these occurrences most often resulted in retirement attributable to shoulder problems (P < .001). For post-baseball career outcomes, 92% of patients were able to throw without pain, and 98% were still able to participate in throwing at least on a recreational level. The 10-year minimum follow-up scores (mean Â± standard deviation) for the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), DASH work module, and DASH sports module were 0.80 Â± 4.43, 1.10 Â± 6.90, and 2.88 Â± 11.91, respectively. Overall, 93% of patients were satisfied, with few reports of persistent elbow pain (3%) or limitation of function (5%). Long-term follow-up of UCLRs in baseball players indicates that most patients were satisfied, with few reports of persistent elbow pain or limitation of\n\nAbsence of Bilateral Differences in Child Baseball Players with Throwing-related Pain.\n\nPubMed\n\nMickeviÄius, M; Rutkauskas, S; SipaviÄienÄ, S; Skurvydas, A; JÃ¼rimÃ¤e, J; Degens, H; Kamandulis, S\n\n2016-11-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to assess whether side-to-side differences in morphology and function of the upper limbs in 11-12 year-old male baseball players with throwing-related pain (n=14) were more pronounced than that of age-matched healthy untrained subjects (n=16). Baseball players 1) had played baseballâ¥4.5âhÂ·wk -1 for â¥â4 years and (2) suffered from moderate-intensity (3-6 points on 10-point questionnaire scale) throwing-related pain in the shoulder or elbow in at least 2 training sessions within the past month. The range of motion (ROM), function and structure of the elbows and shoulders were assessed using goniometry, isokinetic dynamometry and ultrasonography. While the ROM and eccentric external peak torque of internal shoulder rotation were lower, the thickness of the supraspinatus tendon, the ulnar collateral ligament and articular cartilage of the humeral head were larger in baseball players than controls. There were, however, no significant side-to-side differences in any parameter in either group. In conclusion, it is unlikely that side-to-side differences in shoulder and upper limb structure and function contributed to the throwing-related pain in young baseball players, but low shoulder eccentric external peak torque and range of internal rotation may predispose to throwing-related pain.

[Subjects] The subjects were 18 healthy males who were divided into two groups: a NJF group and a control group. The NJF group consisted of 10 subjects, and the control group consisted of 8 subjects. [Methods] Participants in the NJF group received NJF treatment. The baseball pitching velocity, the EMG-RT, the premotor time (PMT), and the motor time (MT) during shoulder internal rotation movement were measured before and after 8 weeks of exercise. [Results] There were no significant differences among the results of the control group. In the NJF group, there were significant differences in baseball pitching velocity, EMG-RT and MT after NJF treatment. [Conclusion] NJF intervention shortens not only EMG-RT but also MT, which implies that NJF is effective for motor processes. Since the baseball pitching velocity increased, NJF may be recommended for the improvement of the performance of baseball players.\n\nShoulder range of motion measures as risk factors for shoulder and elbow injuries in high school softball and baseball players.\n\nPubMed\n\nShanley, Ellen; Rauh, Mitchell J; Michener, Lori A; Ellenbecker, Todd S; Garrison, J Craig; Thigpen, Charles A\n\n2011-09-01\n\nRange of motion deficits in shoulder external rotation (ER), internal rotation (IR), total rotation range of motion (ER + IR), and horizontal adduction (HA) have been retrospectively associated with overhand athletes' arm injuries. The authors expected the incidence of upper extremity injury in high school softball and baseball players with side-to-side shoulder range of motion deficits to be greater than the incidence of upper extremity injury in players with normal shoulder range of motion. Cohort study (prognosis); Level of evidence, 2. High school softball and baseball players (N = 246) participated. Before the start of the season, passive shoulder ER, IR, and HA were assessed at 90Â° of abduction with the scapula stabilized. Relative risk (RR) was calculated to examine range of motion measure, by categorical criteria, and risk of upper extremity injury. Twenty-seven shoulder and elbow injuries (9 softball, 18 baseball) were observed during the season. The dominant shoulder of all injured players and baseball players displayed a significant decrease in HA (P = .05) and IR (P = .04). The dominant shoulder total rotation of injured baseball players displayed a significant decrease (mean difference = 8.0Â° Â± 0.1Â°; P = .05) as compared with the dominant shoulder of uninjured baseball players. Players who displayed a decrease of â¥25Â° of IR in the dominant shoulder were at 4 times greater risk of upper extremity injury compared with players with a <25Â° decrease in IR, especially for baseball players. While we observed a 1.5 to 2 times increased risk of injury for the 10Â° to 20Â° loss in rotational range of motion for the overall sample and baseball, the risk estimates were not statistically significant (P > .05). There are large mean deficits in shoulder IR and HA between injured and noninjured players, but not in ER or total rotation. Passive shoulder IR loss â¥25Â° as compared bilaterally was predictive of arm injury.

Although most of the current orthopedic literature regarding baseball injuries pertains to the shoulder and elbow, lumbar spine injuries are another common reason for time out of play. Back and core injuries may represent as many as 12% of all injuries that result in time out of play from MLB. This high rate of injury is likely related to the critical role that the spine plays in every major baseball-related movement. Linking the upper extremities to the hips and lower extremities, a healthy, strong, and stable spine and core is a prerequisite for performance in all levels of baseball. It has been well documented that baseball players with poor spinal control and stabilization are at increased risk for future injury. Common etiologies of lumbar injuries include stress fractures, muscle injury, annular tears with or without disc herniation, facet joint pain, sacroiliac joint pain, and stenosis. This review discusses the epidemiology of spinal injuries in baseball. Special attention is paid to the role of the spine in baseball-related activities, common injuries, tips for making the correct diagnosis, treatment options, outcomes, rehabilitation, and injury prevention.\n\nMechanisms of Shoulder Range of Motion Deficits in Asymptomatic Baseball Players.\n\nPubMed\n\nBailey, Lane B; Shanley, Ellen; Hawkins, Richard; Beattie, Paul F; Fritz, Stacy; Kwartowitz, David; Thigpen, Charles A\n\n2015-11-01\n\nShoulder range of motion (ROM) deficits have been identified as injury risk factors among baseball athletes. Despite the knowledge surrounding these risk factors, there is a lack of consensus regarding the specific tissues responsible for these deficits in ROM. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the primary mechanisms of posterior shoulder tightness (capsular, musculotendinous, bony) by examining the tissue responses that occur with the application of an acute intervention in baseball players with ROM deficits. The hypothesis was that posterior rotator cuff stiffness, not glenohumeral joint mobility, would be primarily responsible for ROM gains observed within an acute treatment setting. Controlled laboratory study. Through use of ultrasound elastography, electromagnetic motion analysis, and ultrasound imaging, posterior rotator cuff stiffness, glenohumeral joint translation, and humeral torsion were examined in 60 asymptomatic baseball players (age, mean Â± SD, 19 Â± 2 years) with shoulder ROM deficits. Tissue mechanisms were examined concurrently, with the ROM gains elicited by an acute application of instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization plus self-stretching (n = 30) versus self-stretching only (n = 30). Separate 3-way analyses of variance (group Ã arm Ã time) and linear regression analyses were used to determine the treatment effects and relationships between tissue mechanisms and ROM gains. ROM gains were associated with decreases in rotator cuff stiffness (internal rotation: r = 0.35, P = .034; horizontal adduction: r = 0.44, P = .008) and increased humeral retrotorsion (internal rotation: r = -0.35, P = .034), not joint translation (P > .05). Players receiving instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization plus stretching displayed greater shoulder ROM gains (internal rotation, +5Â° Â± 2Â° [P = .010]; total arc of motion, +8Â° Â± 6Â° [P = .010]; horizontal adduction, +7Â° Â± 2Â° [P = .004]; and decreased posterior rotator cuff stiffness, -0\n\nHuman face structure correlates with professional baseball performance: insights from professional Japanese baseball players.\n\nPubMed\n\nTsujimura, Hikaru; Banissy, Michael J\n\n2013-06-23\n\nIn our daily lives, we use faces as a major source of information about other people. Recent work has begun to highlight how one's facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) is linked to a number of behaviours (e.g. deception, aggression and financial performance in firms). fWHR has also been linked to several factors that may be beneficial for sport (e.g. achievement drive, winning mentality and aggression). Despite this, few studies have examined the relationship between fWHR and sports performance, and these have focused on Caucasian sportsmen. Here, we investigated the relationship between fWHR and baseball performance in professional Japanese baseball players. We show that fWHR is positively related with home run performance across two consecutive seasons. The findings provide the first evidence linking fWHR to baseball performance and linking fWHR to behavioural outcomes in Asian participants.\n\nBennett lesions in baseball players detected by magnetic resonance imaging: assessment of association factors.\n\nPubMed\n\nPark, Jin-Young; Noh, Young-Min; Chung, Seok-Won; Moon, Sung-Gyn; Ha, Dae-Ho; Lee, Ki-Sun; Chung, Seok Won\n\n2016-05-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of Bennett lesions in baseball players compared with those without a Bennett lesion and to identify other possible factors associated with Bennett lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We investigated 388 male baseball players with a career >1 year. Demographic factors and a routine physical examination, including glenohumeral internal rotation difference, scapular dyskinesis, and various pathologic changes, were reviewed on MRI to identify relative factors for Bennett lesions. Of the 388 patients evaluated, 125 (32.2%) were diagnosed with Bennett lesions of the shoulder. No significant differences were observed between the groups in demographic factors, physical examination results, visual analog scale score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, or prevalence of concomitant diseases. However, players with Bennett lesions had played baseball longer than those without the lesions (Pâ<â.001). An association was found between Bennett lesions and the length of time that a patient with a Bennett lesion had played baseball. The prevalence of pathologic lesions detected on MRI and the physical examination results were not different between players with and without Bennett lesions.

To examine the incidence, associated injuries, and outcomes associated with forearm flexor injuries among major and minor league baseball players. Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Injury data attributed to forearm flexor injuries among Major League Baseball (MLB) and minor league teams between 2010 and 2014 were obtained from the professional baseball Health and Injury Tracking System. This analysis included the number of players injured, seasonal timing of injury, days spent on the disabled list (DL), preinjury performance data, and subsequent injuries. A total of 134 and 629 forearm flexor injuries occurred in MLB and the minor leagues, respectively. The mean player age was 28.6 and 22.8 years in the MLB and minor leagues, respectively. The mean time spent on the DL for MLB players was 117.0 days, as opposed to 93.9 days in the minor leagues ( P = .272). Interestingly, pitcher performance declined in all categories examined leading up to the season of injury, with significant differences in walks plus hits per inning pitched ( P = .04) and strike percentage ( P = .036). Of MLB players with a forearm injury, subsequent injuries included 50 (37.3%) shoulder, 48 (35.8%) elbow, and 24 (17.9%) forearm injuries. Among injured minor league players, subsequent injuries included 170 (27.0%) shoulder, 156 (24.8%) elbow, and 83 (13.2%) forearm injuries. These rates of subsequent injuries were significantly higher compared with the rates of injuries sustained among players without forearm injuries in both leagues ( P < .001). Finally, 26 (19.4%) MLB and 56 (8.9%) minor league players required an ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction, rates that were significantly higher compared with players without a flexor strain ( P < .001).

To identify the risk factors for an initial medial elbow injury in junior baseball players. Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Junior baseball players (aged 6-12 years) without a history of elbow pain underwent a clinical assessment, ultrasonography, and physical function measurements before the baseball season started. Bilateral passive range of motion (ROM) of elbow extension and flexion, external rotation (ER) and internal rotation (IR) of the shoulder, and ER and IR of the hip were measured. IR and ER strength of the shoulder and scapular muscles were measured on both sides. The thoracic kyphosis angle was measured with participants in a relaxed standing position. Before these examinations, every participant completed a questionnaire regarding his or her age, sex, total years of baseball played, position in baseball, number of balls thrown, and episodes of pain during throwing. After the initial test session, each participant was followed up for 12 months to assess for the occurrence of a new injury. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors for a medial elbow injury. Seventy-eight players (22.1%) sustained a medial elbow injury. Age â¥9 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.708; 95% CI, 1.224-5.990), pitcher position (OR, 2.620; 95% CI, 1.389-4.941), >100 throws per day (OR, 1.936; 95% CI, 1.072-3.497), thoracic kyphosis angle â¥30Â° (OR, 2.501; 95% CI, 1.381-4.531), and elbow extension deficit â¥5Â° (OR, 1.973; 95% CI, 1.022-3.809) were significantly associated with a medial elbow injury. The incidence of an initial medial elbow injury was 22.1%. Age, number of throws per day, thoracic kyphosis angle, and elbow extension deficit are newly discovered risk factors related to physical function. Improvement of the posture and early detection of a silent elbow extension deficit may prevent a medial elbow injury.\n\nA study of static, kinetic, and dynamic visual acuity in 102 Japanese professional baseball players\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHoshina, Kohji; Tagami, Yuichi; Mimura, Osamu; Edagawa, Hiroshi; Matsubara, Masao; Nakayama, Teiichi\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground It seemed that visual functions might have some effects on the performance of baseball players. We measured static, kinetic, and dynamic visual acuity (SVA, KVA, and DVA, respectively) of Japanese professional baseball players to ascertain whether there would be any difference in SVA, KVA, and DVA among player groups stratified according to their performance level. Methods The subjects were 102 male professional baseball players with a mean age of 26 years who were members of a Japanese professional baseball club from 2000 to 2009. They were stratified into three groups according to their performance level: A (players who were on the roster of the top-level team all the time throughout the study period), B (players who were on the roster of the top-level team sometimes but not all the time), and C (players who were never on the roster of the top-level team). They were interviewed for the use of corrective visual aids, and examined for SVA, KVA, and DVA. The measurements of these parameters were compared among groups A, B, and C. We also investigated and analyzed the association of KVA or DVA with player position (pitchers or fielders) and with hand dominance for batting. KVA was compared between the pitchers and the fielders because they each require different playing skills. DVA was compared between the right-handed and the left-handed batters. Results There was no statistically significant difference among groups A, B, and C. There was a statistically significant difference in KVA between the pitchers and the fielders (t-test; P < 0.05) There was no statistically significant difference in DVA between the right-handed and the left-handed batters. Conclusions There was no significant difference in the examined visual functions among player groups with different performance levels.

Little information is available on the bilateral symmetry of hip rotational measures in unilaterally dominant upper extremity athletes. Side-to-side differences in hip joint range of motion may be present because of asymmetrical loading in the lower extremities of elite tennis players and professional baseball pitchers. Cohort (cross-sectional) study (prevalence); Level of evidence, 1. Descriptive measures of hip internal and external rotation active range of motion were taken in the prone position of 64 male and 83 female elite tennis players and 101 male professional baseball pitchers using digital photos and computerized angle calculation software. Bilateral differences in active range of motion between the dominant and nondominant hip were compared using paired t tests and Bonferroni correction for hip internal, external, and total rotation range of motion. A Pearson correlation test was used to test the relationship between years of competition and hip rotation active range of motion. No significant bilateral difference (P > .005) was measured for mean hip internal or external rotation for the elite tennis players or the professional baseball pitchers. An analysis of the number of subjects in each group with a bilateral difference in hip rotation greater than 10 degrees identified 17% of the professional baseball pitchers with internal rotation differences and 42% with external rotation differences. Differences in the elite male tennis players occurred in only 15% of the players for internal rotation and 9% in external rotation. Female subjects had differences in 8% and 12% of the players for internal and external rotation, respectively. Statistical differences were found between the mean total arc of hip range of internal and external rotation in the elite tennis players with the dominant side being greater\n\nDifferences in humeral retroversion in dominant and nondominant sides of young baseball players.\n\nPubMed\n\nKurokawa, Daisuke; Yamamoto, Nobuyuki; Ishikawa, Hiroaki; Nagamoto, Hideaki; Takahashi, Hiroyuki; Muraki, Takayuki; Tanaka, Minoru; Sato, Katsumi; Itoi, Eiji\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThe relationship between the disabled throwing shoulder and humeral retroversion has recently attracted a great deal of attention. However, none of the previous studies clarified when the side-to-side difference of humeral retroversion in young baseball players would start. This study aimed to clarify when the difference of humeral retroversion in the dominant and nondominant sides appeared in baseball players. The bicipital-forearm angle in bilateral shoulders of 172 elementary school baseball players was measured by ultrasound. The bicipital-forearm angle was defined as an angle between the perpendicular line to the bicipital groove and the ulnar long axis with the elbow flexed at 90Â°. The correlation between the bicipital-forearm angle and the grade and the difference of the bicipital-forearm angle between the dominant and nondominant sides were analyzed. In the nondominant shoulders, the bicipital-forearm angle increased with the grade in school (râ=â0.32, Pâ<â.0001), but this was not observed in the dominant shoulders. In the fourth to sixth graders, the bicipital-forearm angles were significantly smaller in the dominant shoulders than in the nondominant shoulders. Our findings indicated that humeral retroversion decreased with age in the nonthrowing side but not in the throwing side and that the side-to-side difference of humeral retroversion in the baseball players became obvious from the fourth grade. We assume that the repetitive throwing motion restricts the physiologic humeral derotation process and the difference became apparent from the fourth grade when the growth spurt begins in boys.

Research has shown that decreasing the weight of baseballs may limit the severity of both chronic arm and collision injuries. Unfortunately, reducing the weight of the ball also increases its exit velocity, leaving pitchers and nonpitchers with less time to defend themselves. The purpose of this study was to examine impact probability for pitchers and nonpitchers. Hypothesis: Reducing the available time to respond by 10% (expected from reducing ball weight from 142 g to 113 g) would increase impact probability for pitchers and nonpitchers, and playersâ mean simple response time would be a primary predictor of impact probability for all participants. Study Design: Nineteen subjects between the ages of 9 and 13 years performed 3 experiments in a controlled laboratory setting: a simple response time test, an avoidance response time test, and a pitching response time test. Methods: Each subject performed these tests in order. The simple reaction time test tested the subjectsâ mean simple response time, the avoidance reaction time test tested the subjectsâ ability to avoid a simulated batted ball as a fielder, and the pitching reaction time test tested the subjectsâ ability to avoid a simulated batted ball as a pitcher. Results: Reducing the weight of a standard baseball from 142 g to 113 g led to a less than 5% increase in impact probability for nonpitchers. However, the results indicate that the impact probability for pitchers could increase by more than 25%. Conclusion: Pitching may greatly increase the amount of time needed to react and defend oneself from a batted ball. Clinical Relevance: Impact injuries to youth baseball players may increase if a 113-g ball is used.

Cricket, the world's second most popular sport, is enjoyed by hundreds of millions of participants in such countries as India, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh, South Africa, West Indies, Sri Lanka, United Kingdom, and Zimbabwe. Although any player can develop skin disease as a result of participation in these bat-and-ball sports, competitive team athletes are especially prone to skin problems related to infection, trauma, allergy, solar exposure, and other causes. These diseases can produce symptoms that hinder individual athletic performance and participation. In this review, we discuss the diagnosis and best-practice management of skin diseases that can develop as a result of participation in baseball, softball, and cricket.\n\nEffect of age on anthropometric and physical performance measures in professional baseball players.\n\nPubMed\n\nMangine, Gerald T; Hoffman, Jay R; Fragala, Maren S"
