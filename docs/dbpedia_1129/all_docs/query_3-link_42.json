        "text": "The feature generated a huge response, partly because the resulting list wasn’t just one person’s opinion. It was a top 50 that took a lot of time to compile, but the results, we think, were worth it.\n\nMany readers had the same response: do the same for Irish songs.\n\nWe listened, and here it is.\n\nAs with the albums, we have asked 50 people who really know their stuff — musicians, gig promoters, critics, broadcasters, DJs, music PRs, arts podcasters — to come up with their top Irish songs ever in order of preference. A score was then applied — 10 points to the song at number one, down to one point for the song in 10th place — and the results totted up for the final rundown.\n\nThere were ground rules, of course. No songs from overseas artists of Irish extraction. Sorry Morrissey, Paul McCartney, Kate Bush… Songs from international bands featuring an Irish musician were permitted. Cover versions were also allowed and the song did not have to have been released as a single.\n\nHappy reading — and listening.\n\n50 The Fat Lady Sings, Arclight (1991)\n\nWith bands such as the Blue Nile and Prefab Sprout doing a fine line in sophisti-pop — as the genre is often risibly known — it was inevitable that some Irish contemporaries would get in on the act.\n\nFor a few years in the early 1990s, the Dubliners, led by Nick Kelly, were our finest exponents of the genre and this polished, upbeat highlight from their debut album, Twist, is their crowning achievement. — JM\n\n49 The Pogues, Fairytale of New York (1987)\n\nPenned by Jem Finer and Shane MacGowan, this beloved seasonal ballad is frequently cited as the best Christmas song of all time — and with good reason.\n\nThe plaintive piano intro, jaunty tin whistle, playful accordion, shimmering strings and lyrics that capture the frailty and wonder of romantic love prove a transcendent combination. But it is the enchanting chemistry and buoyant back-and-forth between MacGowan and Kirsty MacColl that provide the magic.— RD\n\n48 Richard Harris, MacArthur Park (1968)\n\nBest known for a stellar acting career that peaked in 1991 with an Oscar for his towering performance in The Field, the Limerick native also released several albums.\n\nHe collaborated with the great American tunesmith Jimmy Webb on a number of songs, most notably on this extraordinary seven-minute epic. Harris’ vocal performance is remarkable: passionate, but not histrionic. The song, inspired by a break-up suffered by Webb, remains magical and mysterious. — JM\n\n47 Stiff Little Fingers, Alternative Ulster (1978)\n\nThe Clash took a day trip to the Falls Road and posed in front of RUC vans; for Stiff Little Fingers, war-torn Belfast was a daily reality. Alternative Ulster is a blistering agitpop attack that engages head-on as the authorities worked on their clampdown. It fired up acts like U2, Green Day and Rage Against The Machine. As fellow Northern Irish band That Petrol Emotion might say, this one will detonate your dreams. — AC\n\n46 CMAT, I Wanna Be A Cowboy, Baby! (2022)\n\nYoung gun goes for it. The second most recent song on this list comes from Ireland’s most talked about and gawped at new pop icon, bold and brassy Dubliner Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson.\n\nCall it kitschy and western, but this tale of suburban longing about what should have been captures her artfully oblique take on bayou blues and big city badness. I Wanna Be A Cowboy, Baby! may be new, but it already sounds like a classic. — AC\n\n45 Gemma Dunleavy, Up De Flats (2020)\n\nA contemporary Irish pop song filtered through an artist’s distinct lens, Gemma Dunleavy’s debut single is a breath of fresh air.\n\nDrawing from 2-step, ambient pop and dreamy electronica — all wrapped around a glimmering harp sample — Up De Flats is an evocative, nostalgic song rooted in her Dublin city background. “I engraved me name on the pillars of the arch,” she sings, “so that when I left I’d always leave me mark”. — LM\n\nThe youngest artist to feature: Ash’s Tim Wheeler was just 16 when he wrote Girl From Mars\n\n44 Ash, Girl From Mars (1996)\n\nPenned by the youngest artist in this Top 50, Tim Wheeler wrote this firecracker at the tender age of 16 and the band famously performed it on Top of the Pops two weeks after their A-Levels.\n\nTaken from their explosive debut album, 1977, the track oozes adolescent excitement, youthful naivety and teenage thrills. Walls of crashing guitars and blissful melodies collide to create this perfect pop-rock earworm. — RD\n\n43 Boomtown Rats,I Don’t Like Mondays (1979)\n\nA 1979 US high school massacre provided the inspiration for the Dubliners’ second UK number one single. Sixteen-year-old shooter Brenda Ann Spencer did it, she said, because “I don’t like Mondays — this livens up the day.”\n\nBob Geldof seized on the line, and with his pop sensibilities finely tuned, turned a horrible subject into a New Wave classic. Despite its huge success here and Britain, it barely dented the US charts. — JM\n\n42 Mic Christopher, Heyday (2000)\n\nTry listening to this and not breaking into a dopey grin. A troubadour with a real bohemian soul, the late Mic Christopher was a member of the Grafton Street busking brigade before he formed the Mary Janes and then stuck out on his own.\n\nReleased in late 2000, Heyday was very much his calling card and it’s a song so simple and so uplifting that it sounds like it’s been around forever. — AC\n\n41 Van Morrison, Madame George (1968)\n\nOne of the most highly regarded tracks on meisterwerk Astral Weeks, Madame George remains an unadulterated classic — swooning strings, playful flute, melancholy arrangements and the Belfast Cowboy name-checking local landmarks. Despite rampant speculation, the identity of Ms George has never been unearthed, with Van asserting it is the amalgam of six or seven people. — RD\n\n40 The Cranberries, Linger (1993)\n\nWhen you consider that the Cranberries had barely hit their 20s when they wrote and recorded their first record, it makes Linger all the more impressive.\n\nThe song, from the Limerick outfit’s debut album Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can’t We?, has aged like a fine wine. A winning combination of the production nous of Stephen Street (the Smiths/Blur), those majestic sweeping strings and Dolores O’Riordan’s achingly beautiful vocal performance make it a modern masterpiece. — LM\n\n39 Fontaines DC, Boys in the Better Land (2019)\n\nGuttural, swaggering and very real. The Irish band we had all been waiting for delivered this shot across the bows on their celebrated debut album Dogrel all of five years ago. Front man Grian Chatten’s flat Dublinese speak-singing sounds both sullen and dazed amid splashing percussion and guitars that flash from jumpy rhythm parts to power-chording lead. This bolt of post-punk romanticism sounds like Shane MacGowan downing pints with Mark E Smith. — AC\n\n38 My Bloody Valentine, Only ­Shallow (1991)\n\nThe opening track on MBV’s second album is an alt-rock staple and a stunning achievement from the band’s visionary leader Kevin Shields.\n\nBilinda Butcher’s ethereal (if hard to decipher) vocals sit atop Shields’ distinctive guitar sound — the track is a key example of his ‘glide guitar’ technique — and relentless percussion from Colm Ó Cíosóig. It’s a sound collage typical of Loveless, voted best Irish album ever in this newspaper last year. — JM\n\n37 Aslan, Crazy World (1993)\n\nIt is a song that has practically become a staple of any Irish gathering: weddings, funerals, house parties. Everyone knows the words of Aslan’s hugely popular single, with its eternally hummable melody and rousing chorus.\n\nEven so, it remains an underestimated gem. Christy Dignam’s conflicted lyrics, directed at his family while acknowledging his own troubles, add a layer of poignancy that is often disregarded during those big singalongs. — LM\n\n36 A House, Endless Art (1992)\n\nReleased as a single from the Dubliners’ third album, I Am The Greatest, Endless Art is a beloved Irish classic, its popularity boosted by an inventive stop-motion video.\n\n“All art is quite useless according to Oscar Wilde,” declaims Dave Couse, before listing an assortment of artists and their birth and death dates over a shoegazey distorted guitar riff and some repurposed Beethoven (Symphony No 5). Sprinkled with magic production dust by the mighty Edwyn Collins. — RD\n\n35 Whipping Boy, Twinkle (1995)\n\nBurning brightly, if all too briefly, the Dublin quartet were the most thrilling Irish rock band of the mid-1990s.\n\nTheir second album, Heartworm, has proved especially enduring and of its many great tracks, this potent rocker holds a special grip. “She’s the only one for me,” sings Ferghal McKee, in a song shot through with menace and foreboding. “You’re going to pay for all the hate I’m giving.” — JM\n\n34 For Those I Love, I Have A Love (2021)\n\nDavid Balfe’s debut single is a powerful meditation on loss and grief following by the sudden death of his friend and fellow artist Paul Curran.\n\nTaken from his self-titled Choice Prize-winning album, the track combines plaintive piano, shimmering electronics, spoken-word vocals, conversational excerpts, synths and keys to create a potent reflection on the devastating nature of bereavement, and the intense love and joy of close friendship. — RD\n\n33 Denise Chaila, Chaila (2020)\n\nZambian-Irish hip-hop artist Denise Chaila grew up with people mispronouncing her name. On this startling single, she unapologetically puts her detractors in their place.\n\nChaila nods to her African heritage with zingers like “Don’t need your Concern if you’ll look at me and see a Trócaire kid”, simultaneously encompassing chest-thumping bravado and a sense of vulnerability. As statements of intent go, it’s both devastatingly clever and insanely catchy. — LM\n\n32 Sultans of Ping FC, Where’s Me Jumper? (1993)\n\nOne of the great earworm songs by any Irish act: once heard, never forgotten. It remains an absurdist anthem, beloved by each new generation — play this song at a wedding party, and watch the guests jump around with abandon.\n\n“At first the band refused to play the song because they thought it was a bit crap,” frontman Niall O’Flaherty recalled, “but they’ve come round now.” And the Corkonians are still playing it. — JM\n\n31 My Bloody Valentine, You Made Me Realise (1988)\n\nBefore Dublin-London pioneers MBV conjured up cathedrals of sound and vaporous dream states on their still peerless Loveless album, they cooked up this art-punk racket from their astonishing third EP.\n\nTheir first release on Creation Records was the beginning of something very bruised and very beautiful. You Made Me Realise is an exhilarating sonic shakedown that will leave your windowpanes rattling, your chandeliers tinkling — and you shaking. — AC\n\n30 Clannad & Bono, In a Lifetime (1985)\n\nWritten by brothers Pól and Ciarán Brennan, this was the third single to be released from Clannad’s eighth album, Macalla. At the time, U2 were riding high on the success of their Live Aid performance that summer, as were Clannad, who had just won a Bafta for their theme song for Robin of Sherwood.\n\nRecorded over just two nights in Windmill Lane Studios, In a Lifetime is a magical confluence of potent artistry; Moya Brennan’s haunting vocals contrast sublimely with Bono’s impassioned delivery over mesmeric melodies and glorious sax. — RD\n\n29Thin Lizzy, Whiskey in the Jar (1972)\n\nThere are few guitar riffs in rock music as memorable as Eric Bell’s indelible contribution to Whiskey in the Jar.\n\nThin Lizzy repurposed a 17th century Irish trad ballad, stripping away the jauntiness and adding swagger, anguish and an insouciant poise to the tragic tale of the rapparee who was betrayed by his lover, Molly. Phil Lynott’s yearning vocal is the cherry on top of this iconic rendering of the ballad, staking a strong claim as the definitive version — or, at the very least, the coolest. — LM\n\nThe most recent song to make the list: Lankum, Go Dig My Grave (2023)\n\n28 Lankum, Go Dig My Grave (2023)\n\nTaken from their Choice Prize-winning fourth album False Lankum, Go Dig My Grave is the folk troupe’s chilling and evocative interpretation of the traditional song made popular by Jean Ritchie.\n\nA study on the visceral nature of grief also inspired by the Irish tradition of keening, the song commences with Radie Peat’s powerful lone voice and layers gradually with eerie, augmenting instrumentation. The otherworldly, despairing nature of her vocal instils this tragic story of a young girl’s suicide with a wretched sadness before the song descends into ominous percussion replete with swooning, vertiginous strings. A brooding masterpiece. — RD\n\n27 Republic of Ireland football squad, Put ’Em Under Pressure (1990)\n\nIt may be a cliché to suggest the country went football mad in the summer of 1990, but it did. In the pre-internet age and when the Celtic Tiger was still several years away, qualifying for our first World Cup was a huge deal.\n\nBuilt around manager Jack Charlton’s oft-quoted mantra, the song is a rousing, feel-good belter that features some of Irish music’s biggest names. Clannad’s Moya Brennan sings the intro, the guitar riff is from Horslips’ Dearg Doom and the production is from Larry Mullen. It was number one for 13 weeks. — JM\n\n26 U2, The Fly (1991)\n\nAfter “cutting down the Joshua Tree” (it was the bloated folly of Rattle and Hum that was the real issue), citizens of the world U2 shacked up in the hallowed halls of Hansa Studios in Berlin just as the wall came tumbling down — and discovered they had a sense of humour.\n\nFeaturing a 108 BPM engine room (someone clearly had an ear on the Madchester scene), industrial discord and, best of all, the demented buzz of Edge’s guitar, The Fly trades gravitas for glee. Not to be confused with The Fly (Ssh Song) by Foster and Allen. — AC\n\n25 Jape, Floating (2004)\n\nA mystical haze of droney synthesiser and a sparsely plucked acoustic guitar riff launches into a shuffling, quietly euphoric groove; the opening track on Jape’s second album remains the Dublin band’s defining moment, two decades on.\n\nRichie Egan’s meditation on life and love manages to be both profound and humorous, an ethereal electro-indie comedown packed with quirky melodies and lines like: “We took our first pill when the music was shit / I said ‘fuck dancing all night’, but then that’s just what we did.” A bona fide Irish indie classic. — LM\n\n24 Microdisney, Town to Town (1987)\n\nAs a songwriter and producer of great renown between the 1960s and 1980s, Mickie Most truly knew what made the perfect song. On hearing this effervescent track penned by Cathal Coughlan and Sean O’Hagan, he declared it at the time to be “one of the greatest pop singles of the past 15 years”.\n\nAnd what a joyous thing it is, even if it’s not particularly representative of the band’s very fine oeuvre. “She’s trying to pronounce my name,” sings Coughlan, the London-transplanted Corkonian. It should have been a big hit. — JM\n\n23 U2, Bad (1983)\n\nThey’re a band renowned for their anthems and big singalong moments, but with Bad, U2 proved that they were more than capable of writing tender, soul-stirring songs too.\n\nA track from fourth album, The Unforgettable Fire (produced by Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois) and inspired by the heroin epidemic of the 1980s, its emotion is slowly eked out over six glorious minutes. Building to a goosebump-inducing crescendo, this is surely one of Bono’s most impassioned vocal deliveries. Their extended performance of the song at Live Aid cemented it as a fan favourite. — LM\n\n22 The Blades, Downmarket (1983)\n\nFor a while, at the end of the 1970s, the smart money was on the Blades, rather than their Dublin contemporaries U2, to move into the big time. We all know how that worked out. The Blades’ apparent failure to ‘make it’ wasn’t down to a shortage of great songs. Paul Cleary and friends seemingly wrote them with ease.\n\nDownmarket is nothing short of irresistible with its jangly guitars and sunny brass. It’s not just a great pop-rock song, but a commentary on the unemployment-scarred Ireland of the 1980s. — JM\n\n21 The Cranberries, Zombie (1994)\n\nGiven its recent popularity with Irish rugby fans and its eminently anthemic chorus, it can be easy to forget just how political a song Zombie was on release — and still is today. Written by the late Dolores O’Riordan following the IRA’s bombing in Warrington in 1993, the song is an angry condemnation of the violence of the Troubles.\n\nAs well as being an astounding rock composition, with its deliciously grungey bassline and siren-like guitar riffs, O’Riordan’s forlorn lyrics remain as relevant as ever. Zombie is a war protest song for the ages. — LM\n\n20 Aslan, This Is (1988)\n\nThe song that made the Finglas folk heroes Irish music’s best hope since U2 began life as a demo single in 1986 before blooming into full crimson glory two years later on their debut album, Feel No Shame.\n\nThose gated drums date it somewhat but it’s the pleading vocals of almost feral frontman Christy Dignam that makes this an undimmed anthem of desperation and defiance that will always strike a universal chord. Of course, since Christy’s sad death last year, it has taken on a new poignancy and power. — AC\n\n19 U2, Where the Streets Have No Name (1989)\n\nWith its instantly recognisable guitar arpeggio intro, Where the Streets Have No Name was the third single taken from 1987’s The Joshua Tree. Bono wrote the lyrics while on a humanitarian visit to Ethiopia and says they are about “transcendence, elevation, whatever you want to call it”.\n\nPropulsive drumming, driving bass, Edge’s distinctive guitar and Bono’s emotive, powerfully pleading tenor take us on a journey that seems to catalogue the destruction of both a romantic relationship and a home place: “The city’s a flood/ And our love turns to rust.” Rock at its most compelling. — RD\n\n18 Luke Kelly, On Raglan Road (1986)\n\nThe Patrick Kavanagh poem about unrequited love was originally published in 1946. After a meeting with Luke Kelly in the Bailey bar some 20 years later, the co-founder of the Dubliners set the verse to the traditional song The Dawning of the Day.\n\nThere are several Kelly recordings, including live renditions with the Dubliners, but the most indelible version was taped in 1983 and released on a compilation album two years after his untimely death in 1984. The plaintive banjo perfectly compliments Kelly’s gruff and heartfelt vocal. — JM\n\n17 The Cranberries, Dreams (1992)\n\nThe Limerick quartet’s debut single introduced the world to the dulcet tones of Dolores O’Riordan, for whom superstardom beckoned.\n\nWritten about the singer’s first love, it certainly captures an emotional rollercoaster — her vocals run the gamut from sweetly angelic to a piercing lament, that by jangly guitars and wistful melodies which build to a layered dynamic climax. Spin Magazine declared it “one of the best rock singles of the ‘90s”. — RD\n\nThe oldest song to make the list: Them, Gloria (1964)\n\n16 Them, Gloria (1964)\n\nOften covered but never bettered, Van Morrison (only 19 at the time) and Them nonchalantly laid down a foundation stone of rock ’n’ roll itself with this three-chord trick garage rock classic.\n\nLong before he disappeared into the mystic, Van could already blow Mick Jagger off the stage. Like a lusty Lead Belly or a horny Howlin’ Wolf, young Ivan serves notice that there is a new blues shouter in town with the bug-eyed strut of Gloria. Incredibly, it was a B-side. — AC\n\n15 U2, Sunday Bloody Sunday (1983)\n\nControversial in its day, U2’s strident anti-war song explodes into widescreen life and remains a cornerstone of their live set over 40 years later. A splenetic broadside about the Troubles, it’s as exhilarating and galvanising as ever — Larry Mullen goes full Artane Boys’ Band on militaristic drums and the harsh metallic ring of The Edge’s guitar is an irresistible force.\n\nThe song achieved anthemic mortality when it featured on the band’s incendiary live album U2: Under a Blood Red Sky. This is the track that propelled U2 to another level entirely. — AC\n\nThe most streamed song on Spotify to make this list: Hozier’s Take Me to Church\n\n​14 Hozier, Take Me to Church (2013)\n\nTalk about setting a standard: Hozier’s first single made him a star and laid out a path for global domination that he is still treading more than a decade later. It’s not hard to see why this song connected with such a wide audience: its denunciation of the Catholic church entwined with a love song, coupled with Hozier’s remarkable voice and the soulful drama of the composition, make a memorable first impression. Famously demoed in his parents’ attic, Take Me to Church topped charts around the world and remains his signature tune. — LM\n\n13 Van Morrison, Into the Mystic (1970)\n\nMoondance is an album that boasts many riches but Into The Mystic may be its finest moment. At times spiritual — “We were born before the wind” — and at others unaffected and almost commonplace — “When that foghorn blows I’ll be coming home” — these oppositional elements are part of its appeal and charm.\n\nPiano, bass, guitar and tambourine coalesce to provide a melodic warm embrace, punctured playfully by alto and tenor sax while Van conjures a panoply of emotions with that voice — a mystic force in itself. — RD\n\n12 U2, One (1991)\n\nThe song that nearly broke up U2 — and then miraculously proved to be their rebirth. In 1991, the band decamped to Berlin’s fabled Hansa Studio to dream it all up again; instead, “the hats and the haircuts” went to war with each other. “We weren’t getting anywhere until One fell into our laps,” Adam Clayton recalled. “And suddenly we hit a groove.”\n\nWith a lyric that could have been written by Bob Marley (it was also influenced by Prince’s equally smouldering 1987 song The Cross), it remains the missing link between Old and New Testament U2. — AC\n\nMy Favourite Irish Song Ever\n\n11 U2, The Unforgettable Fire (1983)\n\nThe title track of the U2’s fourth album has an atmospheric breathiness that wouldn’t sound out of place over a 1980s action film sequence; the Bond theme that never was? Either way, The Unforgettable Fire is a searing, dance beat-driven thrill ride.\n\nThe Edge’s distinctive layered and textured guitar sound, coupled with the headlong rush into the chorus as Bono implores us to “Walk on by, walk on through / Walk till you run” has the same spine-tingling effect that it did in 1984 — when it became the band’s first Irish number one single. — LM\n\n10 My Bloody Valentine, Soon (1991)\n\nPerhaps My Bloody Valentine’s most danceable track, Soon captures everything magical about early 1990s indie. The song is taken from 1990’s Glider EP, which Creation head honcho Alan McGee released to maintain momentum between 1988’s Isn’t Anything and the then still a work-in-progress Loveless, on which it would also appear.\n\nSoon’s component parts — swirling melodies, shimmering rhythms, deep grooves and ethereal vocals — succeed in transporting the listener to a blissful shoegaze trance. Another part of its genius is the tumbling interplay between bass and beat which drive the song forward in a rush of almost giddy excitement. Add to that Kevin Shields’ great washes of landsliding guitar, the sun around which the other elements rotate. Perfection. — RD\n\n9 Thin Lizzy, The Boys are Back in Town (1976)\n\nIt’s hard to believe now, but this evergreen anthem was almost left off breakthrough album Jailbreak. It became unexpectedly popular in the US, with guitarist Scott Gorham crediting a couple of DJs in Kentucky with playing it relentlessly. Later, he said that were it not for Boys kickstarting sales of the album, Thin Lizzy would be finished. Gorham’s guitar riff is one of the most celebrated in all of rock and Phil Lynott sings as though he’s having the time of his life.\n\nThere’s been much conjecture about who the song is about — many think it’s inspired by the so called Quality Street Gang who were responsible for a crime spree in Manchester between the 1960s and 1980s. But the song has long since been co-opted as part of the Irish — and, specifically, Dublin — experience and regularly booms from the speakers at Croke Park and the Aviva Stadium. — JM\n\n8 Thin Lizzy, Dancing in the Moonlight (1977)\n\nSongs written about the first flush of love are usually soppy, saccharine affairs that conjure images of doe-eyed romantics exchanging longing glances. But not Dancing in the Moonlight. In Phil Lynott’s icy cool hands, this capricious recollection of young love from the band’s Bad Reputation album encapsulates the heady rush of forbidden lust in all its grubby, finger-clicking glory; he even makes the words “I always get chocolate stains on my pants” sound beautiful.\n\nFrom the satisfying thwack of that bassline in the opening notes, to the jazzy saxophone solo, to Scott Gorham’s freewheeling guitar solo, this is one of the funkiest, most assured songs in Thin Lizzy’s impressive canon.\n\nIt has been covered by everyone from the Smashing Pumpkins to Alt-J to former X Factor aspirant Diana Vickers, but none could match the feelgood jubilation of the original. — LM\n\n7 Philip Lynott, Old Town (1982)\n\nAfter ruling the roost in the latter half of the 1970s, Thin Lizzy’s steep decline at the start of the new decade took many by surprise. Numerous issues plagued the band, not least Phil Lynott’s increasing dependence on drugs. But he could still write great songs when inspiration took hold and that’s certainly the case with this beloved gem, the highlight of his uneven second solo LP, The Philip Lynott Album.\n\nAlthough a cockney voice at the start intones “That old Covent Garden, I remember it well”, here, this break-up classic is associated with Lynott’s hometown thanks to an RTÉ-made video that sees Philo traverse the Ha’penny Bridge, stroll down Grafton Street and ‘play’ the trumpet in Herbert Park. On record, the trumpet solo is performed by John Wilbraham, the principal player in the BBC Symphony Orchestra. — JM\n\nTom Dunne on Old Town\n\nI first saw Thin Lizzy when I was at school. It was in the National Stadium, and I’ve only patchy memories of the show. But the big gig was Dalymount [in 1977]. Punk had arrived and we saw the Boomtown Rats and the Radiators, but then Lizzy came on and they were at the absolute peak of their powers and Phil was a superstar. Old Town captures his sensitivity and it has such a great pop melody. He was a fan of the Beatles and you can hear that in this song. It’s one I never tire of listening to. One of the things I love most about Old Town is that it’s got a piccolo trumpet solo on it — and that’s one of the most beautiful things of all time. The idea of it came from Penny Lane. When Something Happens were recording the Stuck Together With God’s Glue album in LA, I travelled over with a seven-inch copy of Old Town. We wanted to do something similar on a song called The Patience Business. It’s one of my favourite songs of ours — I thought it should be a single after Parachute. So our piccolo trumpet solo is a distilled version of Phil’s solo, which is a distilled version of the Beatles’.\n\nTom Dunne is the lead singer of Something Happens and presenter of The Tom Dunne Show on Newstalk, which airs from 10pm nightly\n\n6 Enya,Orinoco Flow (1988)\n\nCritics sniffed but record buyers the world over propelled it to number one. Recorded by the holy trinity of Eithne ‘Enya’ Ní Bhraonáin and the husband-and-wife team of Nicky and Roma Ryan, this is the song that established the former member of Donegal family band Clannad as everyone’s favourite one-word New Age demi-goddess. It’s a multilayered wonder of studio wizardry with the impossibly demure Enya singing an otherworldly lyric about a voyage around the South Seas. Or something.\n\nThe key to this song’s still magical allure is those pizzicato chords, generated by altering the Roland D-50 synthesizer’s ‘Pizzagogo’ patch, and the sense of momentum and mystery. It had a difficult gestation but, little did she know it then, Enya was about to set off a fantastic voyage all of her own. — AC\n\n5 The Pogues, A Rainy Night in Soho (1986)\n\nAt his best, Shane MacGowan’s poetic verse was up there with Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell, and that’s certainly apparent on this marvellous, evocative and unashamedly romantic love song. Originally appearing on the Poguetry in Motion EP, when the band were at the peak of their powers, virtually every line of the song is quotable. “You’re the measure of my dreams,” MacGowan sings, beautifully. Elvis Costello’s production is sublime and brings out the sheer virtuosity of the band — even if he and the frontman were at loggerheads in the studio.\n\nThe song was apparently inspired by Shanne Bradley, with whom MacGowan formed the punk band the Nipple Erectors. Nick Cave delivered a marvellous version of the song at MacGowan’s funeral in Nenagh last year and Bruce Springsteen performed it at his shows in Kilkenny, Cork and Dublin last month. — JM\n\n4 Sinéad O’Connor, Troy (1987)\n\nVeering between quiet intensity and visceral rage, Troy is epic in both musical and emotional scope. O’Connor’s debut single offered the first taste from her outstanding first album, The Lion and the Cobra. Inspired by Yeats’ No Second Troy, it seems to deal with a romantic partner, but O’Connor subsequently revealed it is based on a traumatic childhood experience involving her mother.\n\nThe anguish is palpable as she opines: “I know you’re always telling me that you love me/ But just sometimes I wonder if I should believe.” Fury, pain and torment permeate the song through stricken lyrics and thunderous vocals which seem to channel a primal scream. This ferocity is reinforced by lush, frenzied orchestration. Sinéad at her most potent. — RD\n\n3 Sinéad O’Connor, Nothing Compares 2 U (1990)\n\nIt takes a lot to put your own stamp on a song by a legendary artist. The fact that the late, great Dubliner made this Prince song her own is testament to her prowess as both a vocalist and translator of emotion. Originally featured on her second album, I Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got, it remains the jewel in her glittering crown; an astonishing vocal performance laced with anguish, vulnerability and regret.\n\nWhen you’ve heard a song so many times, it can be easy to brush over the intricacies of what makes it special, but when the beat kicks in after that tender opening and O’Connor launches into that sublime first chorus, it never fails to raise goosebumps. Whether it was written by her or not, you simply can’t imagine anyone else singing it better. — LM\n\n2 Sinéad O’Connor, Mandinka (1987)\n\nMy Favourite Irish Song Ever\n\nAlthough she had been tipped as one to watch for a couple of years, it was this strident song from The Lion and the Cobra that helped elevate the 21-year-old Dubliner to superstardom. It landed her an appearance on David Letterman’s late night show and she fervently seized the opportunity. She had first heard about the West African people, the Mandinkas, in Roots, the famed US drama series from the 1970s that was based on Alex Haley’s bestseller, and felt a kinship with the music-loving tribe.\n\nAlthough she never considered herself much of an electric guitar player, it is O’Connor herself who plays the dynamic riff that forms the song’s bedrock. Above all, Mandinka is a showcase for her extraordinary vocals. Thirty-seven years on, and it still sounds as fresh and exciting as the day it was cut at Oasis Studios in London’s Camden. — JM\n\nNaimee Coleman on Mandinka\n\nIt’s an amazing song and I can remember hearing it when it was first released in 1987. I was 10 and it just stopped me in my tracks. To this day, I still feel the same way about it. I adore its power in the song, its energy. Sinéad O’Connor’s performance is just profound. I love the production in it and the way the guitar descends. It gives me goosebumps and always has. I feel in life there aren’t many songs that we come across that have that effect on us and stay with us for so long. It was pretty easy choice for me.\n\nNaimee is a musician. Her latest album, ‘The Edges’, is out now\n\n1 The Undertones, Teenage Kicks (1978)\n\nMy Favourite Irish Song Ever\n\nSo good that John Peel famously burst into tears when he first heard it and then played it twice in a row on his BBC Radio 1 show. The forever boyish Derry act with a gut instinct for melody kicked the door off the hinges of Northern Ireland’s nascent punk scene with this Molotov cocktail of a debut single. Released on Belfast maverick Terri Hooley’s Good Vibrations label, it’s an ode to onanism (the original lyric was said to be “hold it tight”) sung in Feargal Sharkey’s sandpapery yowl and remains almost unparalleled in the Great Irish Songbook.\n\nTeenage Kicks also remained Peel’s all-time favourite song until his death in 2004. As the great man sagely pointed out in 1978, “It doesn’t get much better than this.” — AC\n\nEd Smith on Teenage Kicks\n\nThere’s something completely timeless about Teenage Kicks. It could have been recorded last week — or 40 or 50 years ago, which it was. Magic, if you believe in it, was present the moment that song was born. It’s undeniable. I don’t think anyone could hear Teenage Kicks for the first time and go: “Hmmm, it’s alright.” It has that sort of stumbled-upon genius. The song speaks to the hopeless yearning of teenage life that goes back to the 1950s. It brings it up in a visceral, fun, instantly catchy and relatable way. Every second of it just grabs you right from the very first moment when you hear those drums. The very sound of it encapsulates the impatience, confusion and exasperation of teenage years when all those emotions are swirling around.\n\nEd presents Rocks with Ed Smith on Today FM which airs from 10pm nightly\n\nOur 50 judges, in alphabetical order\n\nJohn Barker, broadcaster, host of Tilt on Dublin City FM\n\nAoife Barry, author and arts journalist\n\nBren Berry, musician and promoter at Aiken Promotions\n\nKate Brayden, arts journalist and music publicist\n\nKate Brennan-Harding, broadcaster and producer, RTÉ\n\nJohn Brereton, editor music magazine, the Goo, and Totally Dublin\n\nLouise Bruton, music critic and journalist\n\nPaul Burgess, musician and academic\n\nEamon Carr, musician and arts journalist\n\nJim Carroll, editor Brainstorm, RTÉ\n\nPat Carty, music critic and arts journalist\n\nTony Clayton-Lea, music critic and arts journalist\n\nTracy Clifford, broadcaster, 2FM\n\nNaimee Coleman, musician\n\nLinda Coogan Byrne, music publicist\n\nAlan Corr, RTÉ multimedia journalist\n\nSinéad Crowley, author, ex-RTÉ arts and culture correspondent\n\nTom Dunne, musician and presenter The Tom Dunne Show, Newstalk\n\nRoisin Dwyer, publicist, National Concert Hall\n\nStef Edwards, music publicist\n\nSinéad Egan, producer Arena, RTÉ\n\nJennifer Gannon, arts journalist\n\nEmma Harney, music publicist\n\nTara Harrison, social media manager, Minding Creative Minds\n\nZara Hedderman, music critic and arts journalist\n\nDan Hegarty, presenter The Alternative, 2FM\n\nChris Jones, DJ, broadcaster and music critic\n\nCiara King, broadcaster, RTÉ and others\n\nPhilip King, musician, film-maker and broadcaster\n\nSheena Madden, music publicist\n\nPaul McLoone, musician and broadcaster\n\nJohn Meagher, music critic and features writer, Irish Independent\n\nRuth Medjber, music and arts photographer\n\nLauren Murphy, music critic and arts journalist\n\nPete Murphy, music publicist\n\nCian Ó Cíobháin, presenter An Taobh Tuathail, Raidió na Gaeltachta\n\nDan Oggly, artist manager and publicist\n\nMyles O’Reilly, musician and film-maker\n\nEvelyn O’Rourke, arts and culture correspondent, RTÉ\n\nEoghan O’Sullivan, podcast host, The Point of Everything\n\nLeagues O’Toole, promoter, Foggy Notions\n\nStephanie Rainey, musician\n\nJeff Robinson, music publicist\n\nEd Smith, presenter The Ed Smith Show, Today FM\n\nLillian Smith, presenter Rising Time, RTÉ\n\nEamon Sweeney, music critic and arts journalist\n\nTanya Sweeney, Irish Independent journalist\n\nDean Van Nguyen, author and arts journalist\n\nKarl Whitney, author and journalist\n\nDee Woods, presenter Nova Lunchbreak on Radio Nova"
