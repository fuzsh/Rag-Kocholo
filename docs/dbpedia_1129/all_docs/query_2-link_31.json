        "text": "Our Under-18s have been busy since coming back for pre-season, having recently returned from their training camp in Portugal. Now, they face a series of friendly fixtures before kicking off the Under-18 Premier League action in mid-August.\n\nEven before signing his scholarship earlier this summer, Shumaira Mheuka was heavily involved in Hassan Sulaiman’s squad last season, making 16 league appearances and scoring nine goals.\n\nThe attacker also played a key role in the Blues lifting the Under-18 Premier League South trophy and experienced playing at Stamford Bridge back in May during the national final against Manchester United.\n\nThroughout pre-season, he aims to continue growing and progressing his skills, hoping to achieve even more in the upcoming campaign. With the new season on the horizon - his first with the Under-18s full-time - we got to know a little more about the striker.\n\nWhat are your biggest strengths?\n\n'My biggest strength is finishing – I love scoring goals. I also like the build-up and creating different opportunities, whether that’s for me or my team-mates.\n\n'I love driving on the ball and pushing up the pitch, using my strength and agility. I get a buzz from taking on players in one-on-one situations, as I feel I am effective in those scenarios.\n\n'So yeah, anything to do with attacking!'\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to developing more this season?\n\n'Definitely playing in the Under-18s full-time. I was fortunate enough to play a fair bit last season despite being so young, but I am looking forward to playing each week in the squad.\n\n'I always like to set goals as it continues to push me. I want to be the top goal scorer. With my current level of play and confidence, I think if I continue to work hard, I will get there.\n\n'I always push for more. It’s important to continue to progress mentally and physically. I hope this season, I can earn a debut in the Under-21s, as it would be a great achievement and give me a taste of what the next level of football is like.\n\n'In the back of my mind, I always think I’m playing for Chelsea – I need to be at my top level all the time. I’m here to score goals and be the best I can be.'\n\nWhat’s your favourite position on the pitch?\n\n'Striker, obviously! Sometimes I play the number 10 role, but I’m happy whenever I am in a position to score goals and make a difference.\n\n'Confidence is key. I believe if you’re confident and believe in yourself off the pitch, your performance just naturally excels. I am the most confident in front of goal – it is just a natural position for me.'\n\nWho would you say you look up to?\n\n'Cristiano Ronaldo. He is the best striker out there – I always look up to his performances and statistics, as those numbers are the ones I want to achieve in my career.'\n\nWho are your role models?\n\n'My number one role model is my dad. The way he carries himself, his confidence and his personality are qualities I really respect and want to emulate when I am older. I look up to him and I’m thankful to say I have a lot of similarities.'\n\nWhat do you do in your free time away from football?\n\n'When I’m not playing football, I like to be chilling and fully relaxed. Most of my downtime is spent hanging out with my brother and family. Spending time with my family is crucial, as it completely allows me to shut off from the football world.'"
