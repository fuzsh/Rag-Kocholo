        "text": "Model Measurements & Body Size â The classic model career every up-and-coming model dreams of almost always depends exclusively on the modelâs body size. There are only a few exceptions, perhaps one in a thousand, who made it anyway due to their special nature. Everybody knows supermodel Kate Moss. She combines everything: a special look, a special charisma and she is always extremely committed to her work. In addition, she leads a very interesting private life for the media and thus also the right story.\n\nWhy are model dimensions so crucial for jobs?\n\nWhy are measurements so important for models? You always have to imagine there are many models. No matter if a designer has his presentation in London, Paris, Hong Kong, Cape Town or also New York and Berlin, fashion collections are cut to a certain size, especially if they have been tailor-made for the next season and are first shown to customers at fashion shows or in showrooms with a few sample pieces. These collection pieces are usually cut to a standard size, this standard size corresponds e.g. with High Fashion to a body size with female models of 178 cm and as a rule a confection size of 34 or 34, 36 (EU). Women should not be taller than 181 cm. For men, it is especially important that your body is not too well trained. Whatâs the matter with you? It makes it harder for normal men to identify with you. Male models should have a minimum size of 185 cm and a maximum size of 195 cm. When female models wear high heels, the biggest differences are not too extreme. At a fashion show then all models are about the same size and nothing distracts from the fashion has pieces.\n\nThe same applies of course to online shops, especially when it comes to the first pieces of a collection, standard sizes are issued. Whether it is clothing, size S or M (US), or standard size shoes from 36 to 38 (EU) for women and 42 or 43 (EU) for men.\n\nDimensions & Sizes at a glance: National and International\n\nBefore we go into detail, these are the general âstandardsâ for 95% of all jobs. The closer you are to these dimensions, the better the conditions â apart from personality.\n\nWomen\n\nBody size for Fashion: 176 â 180cm / International\n\nBody size for advertising: 172 â 181cm / Germany\n\nSlim figure, usually long hair\n\nMen\n\nBody size for Fashion: 186 â 190cm / International\n\nBody size for advertising: 184 â 194cm / Germany\n\nSlim or slightly sporty figure\n\nDimensions for models for advertising\n\nIf you only want to work in advertising, i.e. not in the field of high fashion fashion, the dimensions are no longer so decisive for you. Here women with a height of 170 cm can have success as well as with a height of 183 cm. Also for men models the measures are more flexible, advertisement does not require any more the âabsolute ideal measuresâ and the figure can deviate also a little bit.\n\nPrerequisites for Plus Size Models\n\nPlus Size Models are really trendy. More and more fashion designers and creative arts directors are turning to curvaceous women in advertising. There is a small difference between Plus Size Models and Curvy Models. Plus Size Models are models that are a little above the ânormalâ fashion model sizes, i.e. Plus Size Models are women who have a clothing size of 38 or 40 (EU). Plus Size models can do a great job because more women can identify with them as they do with high fashion models. As a Plus Size Model you can therefore not only work for fashion customers, but also in advertising. That makes the job opportunities varied and so you can earn good money as a Plus Size Model in the industry. You want to be a Plus Size Model? Then send us your application!\n\nTake measurements yourself: Measure hips, waist and chest\n\nHere you see all important points on the body to take your measurements yourself. Make sure that you wear as little clothing as possible when measuring and be honest with yourself when measuring!\n\nCurvy Models: Dimensions and fabrication\n\nCurvy models in women with a clothing size between 42 and 44. Also the cup size is much bigger and can go up to a G-Cup. Curvy Models are as popular as Plus Size Models, as they are most appealing to the average woman. The average woman in Europe has a clothing size of 44, which means that even Curvy models with an average clothing size of 42 to 44 are only generally average. Also as Curvy Model we are very happy about your application in our model agency.\n\nHere you can find our Curvy Models!\n\nCamomille @Berlin Fashion Week: Video\n\nCamille from Hamburg visited us at the Berlin Fashion Week and voila, a new video! Here you can find the first shoots of Camille!\n\nPeople Models\n\nThe last part of the modelâs section revolves around those who have very special traits. Extremely wild hair, tattoos, best agers and many more. As a people model you work mainly in the advertising sector, whether it is for a muesli commercial or for a comfortable mattress. People Models correspond to the normal look of everyday people. You have a special gap in your teeth, a lot of curls or a conspicuous and striking nose. If you want to work as a people model, you should not apply in a model agency but in a special people agency. Whatâs the difference? People agencies also work in advertising, the only thing they serve less is the field of fashion. But as a People Mode you can also get jobs in advertising, for online shops or even classic advertising materials such as image brochures and catalogs.\n\nModel dimensions are as varied as the job itself. There is a suitable agency for every area.\n\nIn fact! Body size makes the difference in jobs for models\n\nEvery model agency is happy about such a diamond. For most people, however, the rule remains the same: Your modeling career is almost always decided on the basis of body size. When we go through applications in the agency, the first information displayed is not name or your residence, first we see the height. Of course, we always take a look at the photos. But as a smaller model you always need the special, international look or a finished model folder. For international customers, the body and clothing size of the models is particularly important. But first we look at what a typical customer from Germany attaches importance to in his inquiry.\n\nBasically, the following specifications are usually given by the customer for the model agency:\n\nBody size of the model (80% of the requests)\n\nModelâs clothing size (70% of requests)\n\nLooks of the model (hair length, hair color, skin tone, etc. to 65% of inquiries)\n\nRecognition value (only 10% of the requests)\n\nElegant presentation of fashion requires slim bodies\n\nElegance â In order for products to be presented elegantly, the figure of the model is crucial for fashion designers and their agencies. The proportions of the model must be right so that the overall presentation is right. Whether fashion show, advertising poster or commercial. Clothing looks much more elegant on slim bodies. We all know the famous âdream measurementsâ of 90-60-90 (hip/waist/breast). These three measures are considered ideal if they are in proportion to the body size.\n\nAs a high fashion model in Milan or Paris this is often too much. Your hip may be New Face gladly still narrower, also the chest. An 87-58-82 (H/T/B) has a good chance at casting in the fashion capitals.\n\nSmall models have less chances of getting big jobs\n\nYou donât stand a chance as a woman at castings in fashion cities under 175cm. If you are smaller than 175 cm, you will unfortunately have no chance in the castings of the big designers. For online shops, labels and advertising in the national market, you still have the chance to get jobs, so itâs worth it, even as a smaller model, if you pay attention to your proportions. For example, if a product is presented by a person, not a group, body size is much less important. If the proportions are right and you have less than 90-60-90 at less than 175cm, the overall picture is right. However, PR and advertising agencies know that you tend to be less booked as a smaller model, so the fees are slightly lower. The sooner you are a model the scheme is: big and attractive, the easier it is for you.\n\nOver 181cm it becomes again more difficult as a woman. Just as there are limits at the bottom, there are also limits at the top. Female models over 181 cm have it again more difficult. For one thing, youâre bigger than your colleagues. But you are also often taller than your male colleagues. With high heels you are as tall as most boys with 187 cm. Even on the catwalk. The fashion collections are only produced in one size for the first presentation. Mostly for dress size 34 (max. 34/36) at 175-179cm. Designers, teams and producers would have to change every single piece or book all models larger.\n\nThese are just two factors to describe why it becomes difficult to model successfully at a certain height. Nevertheless, you have good chances in the national advertising markets, for example in people agencies. They often have jobs very similar to model agencies: commercials, fairs & co. In every big city there are people agencies.\n\nAdvertising effect of elegance for brands of all kinds\n\nIn the international fashion industry, the rules are much stricter, as mentioned earlier. Instead of 90-60-90 it can be 87-58-82. Fashion designers as well as agencies are looking for models to present their products as high as possible. The higher the quality and more exclusive the product is to the consumer in the commercial or from the poster, the easier it is to justify a high price for the product or service. Therefore, as a good model who can sell products through looks and poses, you can also earn a lot of money. Even for individual advertising campaigns, four and five-digit amounts are quickly possible for one-day advertising productions, even for ânew facesâ. Why does advertising need models for events, photos and videos? Read more here: Advertising and its function in marketing.\n\nExpensive or cheap: fashion must be presented elegantly\n\nEven cheaper labels always try to reach the level of high-priced labels in advertising. Whether exclusive, international label or fashion startup, the model must have a slim body so that the garments fall optimally, no wrinkles throw and fit perfectly. This applies to all fashion metropolises and models in New York, Paris, London and Milan.\n\nFashion is always something special. Fashion thrives on being special! New fashion collections are regularly launched by designers worldwide, every season. Not only major international fashion designers and retail chains work in this way. Even small fashion labels have to constantly present their customers with new designs and cuts to attract their attention. So designers and fashion have to reinvent themselves again and again in order to remain interesting for consumers.\n\nCurvy Model: Supersize models become more and more popular\n\nNever before have they been so in demand â Curvy Models. Personality instead of âideal measuresâ. The curves of the 50âs and together with the still prevailing size 0 models bring the next development in the fashion world, the Curvy Model. It is important to note this: Curvy isnât just lazy and fast food. Nutrition is the A&O of every model, because you donât want to lose your sporty curves. The market for Curvys is growing steadily and is being sought everywhere.\n\nShows in Milan, New York, Paris, Hong Kong and London\n\nThe new masterpieces are regularly presented at the Fashion Weeks. Milan, New York, Paris, Hong Kong and London. In spring, summer, autumn and winter people are always looking for new looks and trends. Almost all designers have one thing in common: they tailor their collections for tall, slim people. The clothes fall more elegantly, fabrics unfold their full effect, everything looks more exclusive and higher quality! Gracile figures make clothes and their possible price more expensive. Even if not all fashion brands work in this scheme, it is still the majority of the industry.\n\nFashion show dimensions\n\nFashion shows and fashion presentations are subject to an unwritten norm. For female models, a clothing size of 34 (max. 34/36) with a body size of 177-180 (176-181) cm is considered ideal at the beginning of their career. Your hip should be under 5 inches. For men models there is usually a clothing size of 48 (max. 50/52) with a body size of 185-192 cm. Hereâs a tip for male models: At the beginning of your career, as a male model you should also pay attention to a younger look. If you already look too masculine in your first years as a model, youâll quickly get a chance for jobs in the fashion industry and at castings. Thatâs why you as a male model should always go to castings with a shaved beard during the first years.\n\nModel Casting Berlin â Video of the Agency Casting\n\nHere a small insight into a model casting, here from Berlin in summer and in the highest club of Berlin, the House of Weekend.\n\nModel Coaching Days â How our models learn\n\nHere you can see one of our last Model Coaching Days (exclusively for our models)."
