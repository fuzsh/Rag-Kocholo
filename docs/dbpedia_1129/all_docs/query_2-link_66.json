        "text": "Acetaminophen (a see tah MIN o fen) is the generic name for Tylenol® (TIE len ol). Other names for this medicine are Tempra® and Feverall®. Many grocery stores and pharmacies have their own brands.\n\nYou can get acetaminophen as a liquid, chewable tablets, regular tablets or capsules, and suppositories. It comes in different strengths and does not need a prescription.\n\nAcetaminophen is used to reduce fever and treat pain. Your child’s symptoms should get better in 15 to 30 minutes after taking a dose.\n\nHow to Give This Medicine\n\nShake this medicine before using if it is a liquid.\n\nUse a pediatric measuring device such as a syringe, spoon or cup (available at the pharmacy) to get the exact dose. Many packages will have their own measuring device in the box. Do not measure liquid medicines in kitchen spoons.\n\nRead the label carefully and make sure you are giving your child the right amount. It is easy to confuse the different forms and strengths.\n\nGive the exact dose of medicine that your child’s health care provider ordered (Picture 1).\n\nAsk your child’s pharmacist, nurse or health care provider before crushing any medicine.\n\nChewable tablets may be chewed, dissolved in liquid or swallowed whole.\n\nStay with your child until they have swallowed the dose of medicine.\n\nSuppositories should be moistened with water or Vaseline® before inserting into your child’s rectum.\n\nDo not give more than 5 doses of this medicine in a 24-hour period unless ordered by your child’s health care provider.\n\nDo not give this medicine for more than 3 days without checking with your child’s health care provider.\n\nIf a Dose is Vomited\n\nIf your child gags or chokes and spits out the dose before swallowing it, let the child calm down and then give the same amount one more time.\n\nIf the medicine is vomited (thrown up) right after you give it, wait 20 minutes. Then give the same size dose one more time. If the vomiting continues, call your child's doctor.\n\nDrug and Food Interactions\n\nAcetaminophen should not be taken with the following:\n\nAlcohol. Drinking alcohol when taking acetaminophen may cause liver damage.\n\nSome daily prescription medicines. Long-time treatment with acetaminophen and certain prescription medicines that are taken every day may cause liver damage. Examples include carbamazepine (Tegretol®), isoniazid (INH), lamotrigine (Lamictal®), phenytoin (Dilantin®) and warfarin (Coumadin®). Ask the prescriber or pharmacist if your child’s medicines can be taken with acetaminophen.\n\nNarcotic pain medicines that contain acetaminophen (such as Tylenol® with codeine, Vicodin®, Lortab®, Norco®, and Percocet®). Giving these with plain acetaminophen may cause your child to overdose on acetaminophen.\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines. Many OTC medicines for cough and cold, allergies, pain and sleeplessness contain acetaminophen. Read the label or check with your child’s health care provider or pharmacist first.\n\nVitamin or mineral supplements. Ask your child’s health care provider if it is all right to give these.\n\nWarnings\n\nIt is not safe to give your child more than 4 grams (4,000 milligrams (mg)) in 24 hours. Let your child’s health care provider know if your child:\n\nis allergic to acetaminophen.\n\nhas a condition called G6PD deficiency.\n\nhas a condition called phenylketonuria (PKU). Some acetaminophen products, like the chewable tablets, contain aspartame which can be harmful to children with PKU.\n\nhas liver or kidney disease.\n\nMedicine Storage\n\nStore all medicine out of the reach of children.\n\nAlways keep medicine in the original bottle from the pharmacy.\n\nDo not keep this medicine in the refrigerator.

This helps doctors and health care providers who may not know your child.\n\nLearn the name, spelling and dose of the medicines. Also, teach your child if they are old enough. You will need to know this information when you call the doctor or pharmacist.\n\nIf your child takes too much of any medicine, or if someone else takes your child’s medicine, first call the Central Ohio Poison Center at 1-800-222-1222 (TTY 614-228-2272). They will tell you what to do.\n\nDo not use this medicine if the package has been opened or if the plastic seal or safety wrap is broken before you use it the first time.\n\nWhen this medicine is no longer needed, mix the leftover medicine with an unwanted material like coffee grounds or kitty litter. Place the mixture into a container or a bag that will not leak. Then, throw it away in the trash where children and pets cannot reach it.\n\nAcetaminophen (PDF)\n\nHH-V-58 ©1982, revised 2020, Nationwide Children’s Hospital"
