        "text": "SUBJECTS AND METHODS\n\nThe study design was cross-sectional, wherein all the participants were tested in a single testing session. Healthy males and females who were 18–29 years old were recruited for this study. Subjects were excluded if they showed any lower-extremity or spinal dysfunction or had undergone any surgery, had a history of dizziness or falls, showed any visual or inner ear problems, showed any neurological dysfunctions, showed altered feet sensation, or were pregnant. The participants were college students at King Saud University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. All of the participants signed informed consent forms approved by the College of Applied Medical Sciences Human Subjects Review Board at King Saud University before participation.\n\nThe procedure of the testing session was as follows: completion of a general information form by each participant, YBT practice trials, completion of LEFS-Ar, followed by YBT actual test trials, in that order; the session ended with measurement of the weight, height, and lower-extremity length of each participant.\n\nThe YBT was conducted according to a published protocol7). Barefooted participants started the YBT with 6 practice trials in each direction before they underwent the formal testing. The order of the practice trials was right anterior reach (6 trials), left anterior reach (6 trials), right posteromedial reach (6 trials), left posteromedial reach (6 trials), right posterolateral reach (6 trials), and left posterolateral reach (6 trials). The formal testing trials were performed in the same order as the practice trials, with 3 trials performed in each direction. In each trial, the participants were instructed to reach as far as they could by using their reach foot while keeping their reach foot in contact with the reach indicator, and then return to the starting point while they maintained their balance on the stance limb. The maximum reach distance was recorded to the nearest 0.5 cm in each reach trial. The maximum reach distance of the 3 formal trials in each direction was used for the analysis. Reach distances recorded in centimeter (cm) were also normalized to each participant’s leg length by dividing the reach distance by limb length and then multiplying by 100 to account for the influence of the leg length on test performance23). Normalized composite reach distance was computed for each leg as the sum of the maximum reach distances (in centimeter [cm]) in the 3 directions, divided by 3 times the limb length, and then multiplied by 100.\n\nThe LEFS-Ar is a 20-item region-specific scale19). Each item was scored on a scale of 0–4, where 0 indicates extreme difficulty or inability to perform the activity, and 4 indicates no difficulty. The scores of the items were summed up to yield a total score, ranging from 0 to 80, with lower scores representing greater degrees of activity limitation. LEFS-Ar has been shown to be a valid and reliable measure of activity limitation in patients with lower-extremity musculoskeletal dysfunction22).\n\nLower-limb length was measured from the anterior superior iliac spine to the most distal part of the medial malleolus for each participant by using a tape measure while the participant lay in the supine position. Measurement of the limb length using tape measure has shown excellent reliability12). The dominant lower extremity for the participants was determined on the basis of their response to the question “which foot do you use to kick a ball with”.\n\nThe required sample size to estimate the mean YBT reach distance with 95% confidence level (CI) was computed using a standard deviation of 7 cm7) and an acceptable error of 2.5 cm above and below the mean24, 25). This computation revealed a required sample size of 30 participants. The required sample size to estimate the mean LEFS-Ar score with 95% confidence level (CI) was computed using a standard deviation of 5 scale points and an acceptable error of 5 scale points above and below the mean24, 25). This computation revealed a required sample size of 24 participants.\n\nBecause the aim of this study was to establish gender-specific reference values, a sample consisting of 30 males and 30 females would be adequate for the establishment of gender-specific reference values for the YBT and LEFS-Ar. The reference values for males and females were obtained by computation of means, standard deviations, and 95% CI for each reach direction in the YBT and also for the LEFS-Ar scores. Independent t-tests were used to examine gender differences in YBT and LEFS-Ar, whereas paired t-tests were used to examine interlimb differences in the YBT.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThirty-one females and 30 males participated in this study ( ). The males were slightly older, had higher body weight, and were taller than the females were ( ). Reference values for the YBT for both the females and males are shown as percentage of the leg length in . Gender-specific reference values for the LEFS-Ar are also presented in . The females showed no interlimb differences (right versus left) or (dominant versus non-dominant leg) in all directions of the YBT (p > 0.25), whereas the males showed significant interlimb differences only in the posteromedial direction (right versus left, p = 0.04; dominant versus non-dominant leg, p = 0.03; ). Based on these results, the reference values were obtained for each leg separately in addition to the references values corresponding to the average performance of both the legs.\n\nTable 1.\n\nVariableFemales\n\nMean ± SDMales\n\nMean ± SDAge (year)20.61 ± 1.121.40 ± 1.4*Height (m)1.56 ± 0.041.74 ± 0.08*Mass (kg)54.8 ± 12.977.6 ± 19.9*Body-mass index (kg/m2)22.4 ± 4.825.6 ± 5.6*Leg length (cm)87.6 ± 3.493.2 ± 5.2*\n\nTable 2.\n\nVariableFemalesMalesGender difference Mean ± SD 95% CIMean ± SD95%CIMean difference (95% CI)Anterior (%LL)Right 70.1 ± 4.168.6–71.673.1 ± 7.370.4–75.82.9 (−0.08 to 6.0)Left 70.4 ± 4.368.8–71.973.5 ± 8.570.4–76.73.2 (−0.32 to 6.6)Dominant70.2 ± 4.368.6–71.773.0 ± 7.570.2–75.82.8 (−0.3 to 6.0)Non-dominant70.3 ± 4.168.8–71.973.6 ± 8.370.6–76.73.3 (−0.1 to 6.7) Averagea70.3 ± 3.968.8–71.773.3 ± 7.070.7–75.93.1 (0.1 to 6.0)*Posteromedial (%LL)Right 93.7 ± 7.391.0–96.4104.2 ± 8.4101.1–107.410.5 (6.5 to 14.6)*Left 92.9 ± 7.890.0–95.8107.0 ± 8.7103.8–110.214.1 (9.8 to 18.3)*Dominant93.4 ± 7.490.7–96.1104.3 ± 8.6101.0–107.510.8 (6.7 to 14.9)*Non-dominant93.2 ± 7.990.3–96.1107.0 ± 8.5103.8–110.213.8 (9.6 to 18.0)*Average93.3 ± 7.390.6–96.0105.6 ± 7.8102.7–108.612.3 (8.4 to 16.2)*Posterolateral (%LL)Right 92.3 ± 8.089.4–95.3105.0 ± 10.0101.3–108.812.6 (8.0 to 17.3)*Left 92.8 ± 9.089.5–96.1105.3 ± 11.6101.0–109.712.5 (7.2 to 17.8)*Dominant92.3 ± 8.589.2–95.4105.8 ± 10.5101.9–109.713.5 (8.7 to 18.4)*Non-dominant92.9 ± 8.689.8–96.0104.5 ± 11.2100.4–108.711.6 (6.5 to 16.7)*Average92.6 ± 8.089.6–95.5105.2 ± 10.3101.3–109.012.6 (7.8 to 17.3)*Composite (%LL)Right 85.4 ± 5.783.3–87.594.1 ± 7.291.4–96.88.7 (5.4 to 12.1)*Left 85.4 ± 6.383.0–87.795.3 ± 7.492.5–98.19.9 (6.4 to 13.4)*Dominant85.3 ± 6.083.1–87.594.1 ± 7.091.5–96.88.8 (5.5 to 12.2)*Non-dominant85.5 ± 6.183.2–87.795.3 ± 7.692.5–98.19.8 (6.3 to 13.3)*Average85.4 ± 5.883.2–87.594.7 ± 7.092.1–97.39.3 (6.0 to 12.6)*LEFS-Ar74.3 ± 6.671.9–76.774.8 ± 5.272.8–76.70.44 (−2.6 to 3.5)\n\nTable 3.\n\nVariableFemalesMalesMean difference (95% CI)Mean difference (95% CI)Right minus leftAnterior (cm)−0.2 (−1.2 to 0.8)−0.4 (−3.0 to 2.1)Posteromedial (cm)0.7 (−0.7 to 2.2)−2.5 (−4.9 to −0.1)*Posterolateral (cm)−0.4 (−2.2 to 1.4)−0.3 (−2.6 to 2.0)Composite score (%LL)0.0 (−1.1 to 1.2)−1.2 (−2.7 to 0.4)Dominant minus non-dominantAnterior (cm)−0.2 (−1.2 to 0.8)−0.6 (−3.2 to 1.9)Posteromedial (cm)0.2 (−1.2 to 1.7)−2.6 (−5.0 to −0.2)*Posterolateral (cm)−0.6 (−2.4 to 1.2)1.2 (−1.1 to 3.5)Composite score (%LL)−0.2 (−1.3 to 0.9)−1.2 (−2.8 to 0.4)\n\nIn the anterior direction of the YBT, the males showed better performance in terms of only the average performance of both the legs than the females did (p = 0.04; ). In the posteromedial direction of the YBT, the males showed better performance than the females did, when the values of the right, left, dominant, and non-dominant leg and the average of performance of both the legs were compared (p < 0.001; ). Similarly, the males showed better performance in the posterolateral direction of the YBT than the females did, when the values of the right, left, dominant, and non-dominant leg and the average performance of both the legs were compared (p < 0.001; ). The YBT composite score also showed better performance of the males than of the females, when the values of the right, left, dominant, and non-dominant leg and the average performance of both the legs were compared (p < 0.001; ). The LEFS-Ar values did not show any differences between the males and the females (p = 0.77; ).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn the present study, gender-specific reference values were obtained for the YBT and LEFS-Ar in healthy young adults in Saudi Arabia. These gender-specific reference values would enhance the interpretation of the YBT and LEFS-Ar measurements in daily clinical practice and provide reference values against which the performance of patients could be compared; furthermore, these reference values could be used as reach targets during the course of rehabilitation of patients.\n\nThe YBT reference values in the current study were presented as means and 95% CI. YBT scores that fall within the boundaries of the 95% CI suggest performance similar to that of healthy individuals, whereas YBT scores lower than the lower limit of the 95% CI are indicative of dynamic balance lesser than the dynamic balance of healthy individuals. Research papers on YBT scores of participants from either Saudi Arabia or other countries with similar culture and lifestyle could not be found. A comparison with general college students from the USA with similar characteristics as the participants in the current study26) showed that Saudi males and females showed lower YBT composite scores and lower scores in the posteromedial and posterolateral directions than their USA counterparts did. However, the performance in the anterior direction of the YBT of Saudi males and females was rather similar to that of their USA counterparts. The difference in the YBT performance could be attributed to cultural and lifestyle differences14). This observation supports the aim of the current study that culture-specific reference values for the YBT are needed.\n\nThe YBT reference values for the right, left, dominant, and non-dominant leg and also for the average performance of the 2 legs were obtained. The average performance of the 2 legs is commonly reported in the literature27,28,29). In the current study, no differences were noted between the limbs, except in the posteromedial direction in only the males. This observation indicates that the average composite score and the average scores corresponding to the anterior and posterolateral performance in both males and females as well as the average score corresponding to the posteromedial performance in females could be used as reference values. In the posteromedial direction, males performed better while standing on the left than on the right leg and while standing on the non-dominant leg than on the dominant leg. Seventy-seven percent of the males in the current study stated that their left leg was their non-dominant leg, which might explain the better performance while standing on the left than while standing on the right leg. Previous research studies using SEBT showed no difference in the dynamic balance performance between the dominant and the non-dominant leg30,31,32). These studies included only female participants30) or did not conduct within-gender comparisons32); furthermore, in these studies, the participants performed the test in only 3 directions of the SEBT, excluding the posteromedial direction, in which the interlimb difference in the males was found to be significant in this study30, 31). Another study also using SEBT showed significant interlimb differences in the medial direction in healthy control subjects33). Further studies are needed to examine the pattern of interlimb differences in males and females during the performance of the YBT.\n\nIn addition to providing reference values for the YBT (percent leg length), this study yielded data on the normal interlimb difference in healthy individuals during performance of the YBT. Thus, this study provided valuable information on the differences between the limbs of an individual6). Interlimb differences observed in this study seem to be lower than those observed in other studies14, 27). Data presented in could help clinicians in determining whether the interlimb difference observed in patients with lower-extremity dysfunction falls within or beyond the limits of the normal interlimb difference. Interlimb difference greater than the absolute value of either the upper or the lower limit (whichever is higher) of the 95% CI could be considered beyond the normal range of interlimb difference in YBT performance. For instance, an interlimb difference between the right and left leg of >3 cm in males and of >1.2 cm in females is beyond the normal interlimb differences in the anterior direction ( ). An interlimb difference of >4 cm in YBT anterior direction was associated with an increased risk of lower-extremity injury12, 34); these results suggest that interlimb comparison could be a useful and rapid screening tool for lower-extremity dysfunctions.\n\nThe males in the current study showed higher normalized reach scores in all 3 direction of the YBT and also showed higher composite reach scores than the females did. Furthermore, the males showed greater absolute interlimb reach difference in the posteromedial direction of the YBT than the females did. These results are in line with the previous results, which indicated that males showed greater normalized reach distances in the posteromedial and posterolateral directions and higher composite reach scores than the females did27). In another study, males seemed to show higher composite scores and greater normalized reach distances in all directions than females did, although this difference was not statistically tested by the authors26). Data of the previous study yielded between gender differences with meaningful effect sizes26). Many previous studies27, 35) indicated greater interlimb differences in males than in females in the anterior reach direction, whereas the results of the current study indicate gender difference in the magnitude of interlimb difference in only the posteromedial direction.\n\nThe LEFS-Ar score ranges from 0 to 80, with lower scores representing higher levels of activity limitation19, 22). When patient-reported outcome measures are used, clinicians are faced with the challenge of determining a target for their patients36). With improvement in patient’s physical function, LEFS-Ar score is expected to increase, and this increase could be judged as real and important by comparing it to the minimal detectable change on the scale and minimal clinically important difference19, 22); however, the question about what should be the target for the patient remains unanswered. The 95% CI of the mean LEFS-Ar score obtained in the current study could be used by clinicians as the target for their patients. LEFS-Ar scores of 72–77 in females and 73–77 in males could serve as targets during treatment of lower-extremity dysfunctions in young adults who have similar characteristics as the participants in this study.\n\nThe current study established gender-specific reference values for the YBT and LEFS-Ar in healthy young adults in Saudi Arabia. However, further efforts are needed to establish reference values for the same outcome measures in different age groups to enhance the clinical usefulness of these measures in daily clinical practice."
