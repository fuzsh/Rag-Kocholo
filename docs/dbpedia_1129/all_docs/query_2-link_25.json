        "text": "A measure of success in the Chinese language is how well you can use the Chinese measure words.\n\nAlthough youâll likely hear that there are shortcuts to avoiding the measure words, the truth is that you wonât attain true Chinese mastery unless you have a good handle on the measure words. Luckily for you, measure words shouldnât be a completely foreign concept â English uses measure words quite frequently. The difference is that measure words arenât always required in English, whereas they are always required when quantifying in Chinese.\n\nIn English, most nouns have pretty universal measurements, making the use of measure words unnecessary in most situations. For example, if you say you want to have a beer or a coffee, few people would have trouble picturing what youâll be drinking. But the same isnât true if you said you want âan ice cream.â Are you having a scoop of ice cream? A pint? A cone? A sundae? Youâll have to be more specific and say you want a pint of ice cream (no judgment!).\n\nIn Chinese, you always have to specify the unit of each noun, making measure words infinitely more important than in English. So, in this guide, weâll get into everything you need to know about measure words, including what they are, what the most indispensable ones are, and â of course â some handy tips for learning measure words quickly.\n\nIf you canât count the minutes until youâve learned a few helpful measure words, weâll get started right away!\n\nHow Chinese measure words function in the language\n\nA measure word helps us indicate the amount or quantity of a specific noun or verb. In Chinese, these are known as éè¯ (liÃ ng cÃ­) and are also known as classifiers.\n\nFor example, when you go to a restaurant, you might start by asking for a cup of water, followed by a bowl of noodles and perhaps one or two bottles of beer or a can of soda. The words cup, bowl, bottle, and can are all measure words, as they help quantify how much of something you want.\n\nMandarin measure words are used similarly to English measure words, and they generally follow this simple structure:\n\n=Number + Measure word + Noun\n\nHere are some examples of the structure in action:\n\nChinese Pinyin Pronunciation English æ¥ä¸¤ç¶å¤é ã lÃ¡i liÇng pÃ­ng pÃ­ jiÇ. lai leang pyng pyi jeou. Iâll have two bottles of beer. æå »äºä¸åªçã wÇ yÇng le sÄn zhÄ« gÇu. woo yeang .lhe san jy goou I have raised three dogs. ææ³ä¹°ä¸è¾è½¦ã wÇ xiÇng mÇi yÃ­ liÃ ng chÄ. woo sheang mae yi lianq che. I would like to buy one car.\n\n10 must-know measure words in Chinese\n\nBefore we show you our ultimate list of Chinese measure words, we want to make sure that we can steer you in the right direction. Spending your time memorizing measure words definitely wonât be a productive use of your time. Although being able to pair the right measure word to the appropriate noun is the true sign of an advanced speaker, you wonât have to worry about that for a long time.\n\nLuckily, there are a few measure words that are much more common than the others. That means that mastering even just ten measure words will put you ahead of the rest, and you wonât have to worry too much about the rest of the measure words until you significantly grow your vocabulary.\n\nHere are ten of the most helpful measure words in Chinese.\n\nä¸ª (gÃ¨)\n\nThe first measure word on our list simply has to be ä¸ª (gÃ¨). This is perhaps the most basic of the measure words, and it simply means âindividualâ or âunits.â Although not all Chinese nouns use this measure word, you can think of this as a universal measure word that you can use when in doubt. Though it will still sound weird if you use ä¸ª (gÃ¨) for a noun that goes with a different measure word, it will be less weird than using the incorrect measure word. So, when in doubt, go with ä¸ª (gÃ¨)!\n\nWith that said, there are also countless nouns for which ä¸ª (gÃ¨) is the appropriate measure word, so itâs still worth being the first one on your list. Here are some examples. Note that ä¸ª (gÃ¨) loses its fourth tone when used as a measure word, and instead uses the neutral tone.\n\nChinese Pinyin Pronunciation English ä»æ¯ä¸ä¸ªå¥½äººã tÄ shÃ¬ yÃ­ ge hÇo rÃ©n. ta shyh yi .ge hao ren He is a good man. è¿ä¸ªé®é¢å¾é¾è§£å³ã zhÃ¨ ge wÃ¨n tÃ­ hÄn nÃ¡n jiÄ juÃ©. jeh .ge wenn tyi heen nan jiee jyue This problem is very hard to solve. ä¸ä¸ªå°å°çè¯¯ä¼ã yÃ­ ge xiÇo xiÇo de wÃ¹ huÃ¬. yi .ge sheau sheau .de wuh huey A very small misunderstanding.\n\næ¬¡ (cÃ¬)\n\nThis is one of the most useful measure words for actions. As opposed to ä¸ª (gÃ¨), which is used exclusively with nouns, æ¬¡ (cÃ¬) is used with verbs to express the number of times something has happened. It is used very similarly to the word âtimes,â in English. As in English, youâll need to use some Chinese numbers right before it to indicate the number of times something has happened.\n\nChinese Pinyin Pronunciation English æå»äºä¸¤æ¬¡ã wÇ qÃ¹ le liÇng cÃ¬. woo chiuh .lhe leang tsyh I went two times. ææ¯å¨å»å­¦æ ¡ä¸æ¬¡ã wÇ mÄi zhÅu qÃ¹ xuÃ© xiÃ o sÄn cÃ¬. woo meei jou chiuh shyue shiaw san tsyh I go to school three times a week. è¿æ¬ä¹¦æå·²ç»çäºä¸¤æ¬¡ã zhÃ¨ bÄn shÅ« wÇ yÇ jÄ«ng kÃ n le liÇng cÃ¬. jeh been shu woo yii jing kann .lhe leang tsyh I have already read this book twice.\n\nä»½ (fÃ¨n)\n\nThis measure word means âportionâ or âpart,â and is another very versatile measure word. You can use this for portions of food as well as for things that come in parts or volumes, like gifts, newspaper, magazine, papers, reports, and more!\n\nChinese Pinyin Pronunciation English ä¸¤ä»½ç±³é¥­ liÇng fÃ¨n mÇ fÃ n leang fenn mii fann Two orders of rice. ä¸ä»½æ¥çº¸ yÃ­ fÃ¨n bÃ o zhÇ yi fenn baw jyy A newspaper. ä¸ä»½çé¢ yÃ­ fÃ¨n chÇo miÃ n yi fenn chao miann An order of stir-fried noodles.\n\nå®¶ (jiÄ)\n\nIf youâre a beginner Chinese learner, then youâre probably already familiar with this word. Itâs a word that can wear many hats, such as family, house, and schools of thought. On top of that, this word can also work as a measure word for businesses like shops, restaurants, and families.\n\nChinese Pinyin Pronunciation English è¿å®¶é¤é¦å¾å¥½åã zhÃ¨ jiÄ cÄn guÇn hÄn hÇo chÄ«. jeh jia tsan goan heen hao chy This restaurant is very good. é£å®¶é å§å·²ç»å ³é¨äºã nÃ jiÄ jiÇ bÄ yÇ jÄ«ng guÄn mÃ©n le. nah jia jeou ba yii jing guan men .lhe That bar is already closed. ä¸å®¶é¶è¡ sÄn jiÄ yÃ­n hÃ¡ng san jia yn harng Three banks.\n\næ¯ (bÄi)\n\nIf youâre still working up the courage to order at Chinese restaurants, then you need to get acquainted with this measure word. Any time you want to order a cup of any beverage, you can use æ¯ (bÄi). Here are some examples.\n\nChinese Pinyin Pronunciation English æ¥åæ¯çéº¦æ¿éã lÃ¡i sÃ¬ bÄi yÃ n mÃ i nÃ¡ tiÄ. lai syh bei yann may na tiee Weâll have four oat milk lattes. æåäºä¸¤æ¯çº¢é ã wÇ hÄ le liÇng bÄi hÃ³ng jiÇ. woo he .lhe leang bei horng jeou I drank two glasses of red wine. ä¸æ¯ç»¿è¶ yÃ¬ bÄi lÇ chÃ¡. yih bei liuh char A cup of green tea.\n\nå (kuÃ i)\n\nThis is another measure word thatâs used for pieces of things, although it also has a very popular use with money. You may have already heard of å  (yuÃ¡n) being used for money, which is certainly true. However, å (kuÃ i) is used much more frequently in informal settings. So, if youâre shopping for fruits and vegetables on the street, youâre much more likely to hear å (kuÃ i) instead of å  (yuÃ¡n) to refer to prices.\n\nChinese Pinyin Pronunciation English ä¸åèç³ yÃ­ kuÃ i dÃ n gÄo yi kuay dann gau One piece of cake. ä¸ç¾åé± sÄn bÇi kuÃ i qiÃ¡n san bae kuay chyan 300 Yuan (RMB). äºåå·§å å wÇ kuÃ i qiÇo kÃ¨ lÃ¬ wuu kuay cheau keh lih Five pieces of chocolate.\n\nç (piÃ n)\n\nThis measure word is very helpful as it can be used to refer to slices of all kinds of thin, round things. You can use it to ask for a slice of bread or a slice of watermelon. You can also use it to ask for thin and flat things, like cookies and discs.\n\nChinese Pinyin Pronunciation English ä¸çé¥¼å¹² yÃ¬ piÄn bÇng gÄn yih pian biing gan One cookie. ä¸¤çé¢å liÇng piÃ n miÃ n bÄo leang piann miann bau Two slices of bread. ä¸çè¥¿ç yÃ¬ piÄn xÄ« guÄ yih pian shi gua A slice of watermelon.\n\næ¡ (tiÃ¡o)\n\nThis measure word is used for long and skinny things like rivers, snakes, fish, pants, roads, and more. Perhaps surprisingly, itâs also the measure word for dogs! Now not all dogs are long and skinny, but imagine a funky little dachshund when thinking of the right measure word for your favorite pup.\n\nChinese Pinyin Pronunciation English ä¸æ¡é±¼ yÃ¬ tiÃ¡o yÃº yih tyau yu One fish. è¿æ¡è·¯å¾é¾æ¾å°ã zhÃ¨ tiÃ¡o lÃ¹ hÄn nÃ¡n zhÇo dÃ o. jeh tyau luh heen nan jao daw This road is very hard to find. æåªæåæ¡è£¤å­ã wÇ zhÇ yÇu sÃ¬ tiÃ¡o kÃ¹zi. woo jyy yeou syh tyau kuh.tzy I only have four pairs of pants.\n\nå¼ (zhÄng)\n\nThis object is used for flat things like papers, cards, tables, tickets, beds, newspapers, pictures, and much more. When not used as a measure word, this word can also mean âto open upâ or âto spread,â so imagine opening up a newspaper next time youâre thinking of the right measure word for paper.\n\nChinese Pinyin Pronunciation English ä¸¤å¼ ç«è½¦ç¥¨å·²ç»ä¹°å¥½äºã liÇng zhÄng huÇ chÄ piÃ o yÇ jÄ«ng mÇi hÇo le. leang jang huoo che piaw yii jing mae hao .lhe I already bought two train tickets. è¿å¼ ç»æ¯ä½ èªå·±ç»çåï¼ zhÃ¨ zhÄng huÃ shÃ¬ nÇ zÃ¬ jÇ huÃ de ma? jeh jang huah shyh nii tzyh jii huah .de .mha Did you paint this painting yourself? æåªæä¸å¼ é¶è¡å¡ã wÇ zhÇ yÇu yÃ¬ zhÄng yÃ­n hÃ¡ng kÇ. woo jyy yeou yih jang yn harng kaa I only have one bank card.\n\nåª (zhÄ«)\n\nAlthough many animals have different measure words, many of them use the measure word åª (zhÄ«). You can think of this as the general measure word for animals. Itâs also used for body parts that come in pairs, like hands, arms, and feet.\n\nChinese Pinyin Pronunciation English é£åªç«æ¯è°çï¼ nÃ zhÄ« mÄo shÃ¬ shÃ©i de? nah jyy mhau shyh sheir .de Whose cat is that? ååªé¸ sÃ¬ zhÄ« niÇo syh jyy neau Four birds. é£åªçç«å¤ªå¯ç±ï¼ nÃ zhÄ« xiÃ³ng mÄo tÃ i kÄ Ã i! nah jyy shyong mhau tay kee ay That panda is too cute!\n\nA handy list of 232 Chinese measurement words\n\nThere are over 200 measure words in Chinese, and weâve compiled a list of 232 of them to help you out in any situation. While this list can seem daunting even to intermediate speakers, keep in mind that not all of them are used on a regular basis. In fact, an overwhelming majority of them are frequently ignored, and native speakers often simplify by using a generic measure word even if thereâs a more appropriate measure word.\n\nHowever, this list can serve as a reference for you as you advance in your Chinese studies, so feel free to bookmark this page!

Although learning specific measure words for each noun can feel tedious, itâs also one key thing that distinguishes serious Chinese learners from casual enthusiasts. Not only will using the correct measure word impress your native-speaking friends, but itâs also something that comes later in the learning journey.\n\nWith that said, here are a few tips for learning the Chinese measurement words.\n\n1. Immersion\n\nTotal immersion is one of the best things you can do for your Chinese learning. Thatâs one of the main pillars of the Berlitz Method, which has been helping students increase their foreign language proficiency level for over a hundred years.\n\nPart of the reason this immersive method works so well is that you get to see first-hand how people interact with the language. At the end of the day, you want to be able to communicate with people, not textbooks. Thatâs the beauty about living languages â people interact with them in creative ways, resulting in a spoken language that differs significantly from the official rules.\n\nSo, if youâre looking for a less painful way than simply memorizing hundreds of measure words, then youâll want to find a way to increase your immersion. The obvious route is to spend some time in a Chinese-speaking country, but here are some other creative ways to experience some Chinese immersion:\n\nUse Chinese apps. Letâs face it, we all spend quite some time on social media! Try using Chinese social media apps like Weibo, Xiaohongshu, and WeChat, and start learning Chinese in your free time!\n\nWatch Chinese media. Itâs very easy to find Chinese movies and TV shows nowadays, even on platforms like Netflix. If you prefer watching YouTube, then check out Bilibili, which is Chinaâs equivalent platform!\n\nVisit Chinese-owned businesses. No matter where you live, thereâs probably an authentic Chinese restaurant nearby. Even if your pronunciation isnât fully there, most native Chinese speakers will appreciate that youâre making an effort to learn their beautiful language.\n\nUse sticky notes. This is a tried-and-true method that no student should overlook. It consists of using sticky notes for all items in your home. Just add the measure word in front of the noun, and youâll naturally learn new vocabulary and measure words!\n\nMake new friends. Who doesnât love making new friends? Fortunately, this is one of the best ways to ensure that you spend as much time as possible engaging with the Chinese language. That means more chances for you to see the measure words in action!\n\nAlthough the first few times you experience full immersion will surely come as a shock to you, the beauty of it is that it gets easier the more you do it. So, donât be scared to put yourself out of your comfort zone!\n\n2. Memorization\n\nAs any advanced Chinese learner will tell you, there is no escaping memorization when learning Chinese. Since there isnât such a thing as a Chinese alphabet, youâll have to memorize thousands of characters on your own. While there are tools to help you figure out the sound or meaning of characters â like the Chinese radicals â youâll have to find an efficient way to memorize new words.\n\nScience has shown time and time again that spaced repetition is one of the best study techniques for memorization. This involves using flashcards or software to schedule reviews of vocabulary based on each wordâs difficulty. In other words, youâll review difficult words much more frequently than words you get right consistently, helping you conquer those tough words.\n\nââMeasure words in Chinese Chengyu\n\nLearning Chinese cannot be separated from learning about Chinese culture and history, and Chengyu are a clear example of this. Also known as the Chinese idioms, Chengyu most often consist of four characters that tell a longer story. Of course, to understand Chengyu, you must also be familiar with the story that is being referenced.\n\nAs you progress in your Mandarin Chinese learning journey, youâll start understanding some of the wise and interesting stories behind these Chengyu. To help you move right along, here are some helpful Chengyu including measure words.\n\nChengyu Pinyin Pronunciation Literal meaning Chengyu meaning æ¤æ¤è®¡è¾ jÄ«n jÄ«n jÃ¬ jiÃ o jin jin jih jiaw To worry about every catty (500 grams) To be precise about every little detail å¾å¯¸è¿å°º dÃ© cÃ¹n jÃ¬n chÇ der tsuenn jinn chyy Win an inch, want a foot The more you get, the more you want äºååå shÃ¬ bÃ n gÅng bÃ¨i shyh bann gong bey Half the work, double achievement To attain maximum results with minimal effort åæ¤å «ä¸¤ bÃ n jÄ«n bÄ liÇng bann jin ba leang Half a catty (500 grams), eight 1/16 of a catty A negligible difference\n\nFAQs about Chinese measure words\n\nWhat are the measure words for money in Chinese?\n\nChinese uses several measure words for money, including:\n\nå (fÄn) - CNY 0.01\n\næ¯ (mÃ¡o) - CNY 0.10\n\nè§ (jiÇo) - CNY 0.10\n\nå (kuÃ i) - CNY 1.00\n\nå  (yuÃ¡n) - CNY 1.00\n\nThe most common measure word in spoken Chinese is å (kuÃ i), while the most common in written Chinese is å  (yuÃ¡n).\n\nWhat are the common Chinese measure words for people?\n\nThe most common Chinese measure word for people is ä¸ª (gÃ¨), which also happens to be the most common measure word out there. Chinese also uses the following measure words to refer to people depending on the context:\n\nDescribing Individuals:\n\nå (mÃ­ng)\n\nä½ (wÃ¨i)\n\nå£ (kÇu)\n\nDescribing a group of people:\n\nå¸® (bÄng)\n\nä¼ (huÇ)\n\nç¾¤ (qÃºn)\n\nLearn the Chinese measure words to speak like a true native!\n\nStudying Mandarin Chinese is a long process, and it can often feel like your progress is very slow. Lucky for you, learning Mandarin measure words is a quick and easy way to score a significant improvement in your proficiency level.\n\nHowever, donât stress yourself out too much by attempting to learn 200+ measure words in Chinese. Just getting a handle on the ten most common measure words will have a tremendous impact on the accuracy of your Mandarin!"
