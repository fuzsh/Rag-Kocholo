        "text": "How much will my teen grow?\n\nThe teenage years are also called adolescence. During this time, teens will see the greatest amount of growth in height and weight. Adolescence is a time for growth spurts and puberty changes. A teenager may grow several inches in several months followed by a period of very slow growth. Then they may have another growth spurt. Changes with puberty may happen slowly. Or several changes may occur at the same time.\n\nIt's important to remember that these changes will happen differently for each teen. Some teens may experience these signs of maturity sooner or later than others. And being smaller or bigger than other boys is normal. Each child goes through puberty at their own pace.\n\nWhat changes will happen during puberty?\n\nSexual and other physical maturation that happens during puberty result from hormonal changes.\n\nIn boys, it's hard to know exactly when puberty is coming. There are changes that happen, but they occur slowly over time rather than as a single event.\n\nThere are certain stages of development that boys go through when developing secondary sex characteristics. Here is a brief overview of the changes that happen:\n\nIn boys, the first puberty change is the enlargement of the scrotum and testes. At this point, the penis doesn't enlarge. The testicles may become uneven, which is normal.\n\nAs the testes and scrotum continue to grow, the penis grows.\n\nThe first growth of pubic hair makes long, soft hair that is only in a small area around the genitals.\n\nThis hair then becomes darker and coarser as it continues to spread.\n\nThe pubic hair over time looks like adult hair, but in a smaller area. It may spread to the thighs and sometimes up the stomach.\n\nThese changes may also happen to a boy as he goes through puberty:\n\nBody size will increase. Sometimes the feet, arms, legs, and hands may grow faster than the rest of the body. This may cause a teen to feel clumsy.\n\nSome boys may get some swelling in the breast area. This is a result of the hormonal changes that are happening. This is common among teenage boys and is often a short-term (temporary) condition. Talk with your son's healthcare provider if this is a concern or if the swelling is not going away or is getting worse.\n\nVoice changes may happen, as the voice gets deeper. Voice changes often happen just after the peak in growth. Sometimes the voice may \"crack\" during this time. This is a temporary condition and will improve over time.\n\nHair will start to grow in the genital area. Boys will also have hair growth on their face, under their arms, and on their legs.\n\nAs the puberty hormones increase, teens may have an increase in oily skin and sweating. This is a normal part of growing. It's important to wash daily, including the face. Acne may develop.\n\nAs the penis enlarges, the teen boy may begin to have erections. This is when the penis becomes hard and erect because it is filled with blood. This is due to hormonal changes and may happen for no reason at all. It may also happen when the boy fantasizes about sexual things. This is normal.\n\nDuring puberty, a boy's body also begins making sperm. Semen, which is made up of sperm and other body fluids, may be released during an erection. This is called ejaculation. Sometimes this may happen while the teen is sleeping. This is called a wet dream (nocturnal emission). This is a normal part of puberty. Once sperm is made and ejaculation happens, teen boys who have sex can get someone pregnant.\n\nWhat does my teen understand?\n\nThe teen years bring many changesâ€”not only physically, but also mentally and socially. During these years, teens increase their ability to think abstractly and over time to make plans and set long-term goals. Each child may progress at different rates, and show a different view of the world. In general, these are some of the abilities you may see in your teen:\n\nDeveloping the ability to think abstractly\n\nConcerned with philosophy, politics, and social issues\n\nThinking long-term\n\nSetting goals\n\nComparing himself to his peers\n\nYour teen's relationships with others\n\nAs your teen starts to struggle for independence and control, many changes may happen. Here are some of the issues that your teen may experience during these years:\n\nHe wants independence from parents.\n\nPeer influence and acceptance is very important.\n\nPeer relationships become very important.\n\nHe may be in love.\n\nHe may have long-term commitments in relationships."
