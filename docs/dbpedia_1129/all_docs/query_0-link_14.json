        "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground: With federal abortion protections under threat, it is important to consider how abortion care access will change in certain places and populations if abortion laws revert to states. Abortion policy and access have strong spatial patterns in the US. State-level bans could severely reduce access in vast regions, worsening access in areas with already poor access. This may exacerbate disparities and lead to large-scale impacts on reproductive health. Beyond describing where abortion care may change, we sought to describe which populations could experience the most dramatic impacts if state-level bans are enacted.\n\nMethods: We conducted an ecological and spatial analysisof abortion facilities and county-level populations in the contiguous United States (CONUS). Outcomes were Euclidean distance to abortion care, as well as change in distance after policy changes.\n\nFindings: If states enact abortion bans as expected, 46.7% of the country’s women would see an increase in distance to abortion care. Currently, more than half (62.6%) of all U.S. women live within 10 miles of an abortion clinic, but if state-level abortion bans go into effect, only 40.2% of women would live that close. The median distance would increase from 38.9 miles to 113.5 miles. In particular, women in the Deep South, Midwest, and Intermountain West could have to travel much farther for care. State-level bans may disproportionately impact women of color, those living in poverty, and people with less education.\n\nInterpretation: The impacts of state-level abortion bans will span across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic demographics, but the effects will be felt disproportionately by Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and impoverished women and those with less education. The changes have potential to exacerbate disparities in maternal healthcare outcomes at a large scale.\n\nFunding: We have no funding sources to disclose.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs abortion-restricting legislation has been enacted at the state level, spatial disparities in abortion care access have grown1 — and with the Supreme Court’s expected majority ruling to strike down Roe v. Wade, access to abortion care will likely become substantially worse in large regions of the country.\n\nIn the decades since the Roe v. Wade decision, abortion has been the target of numerous legal restrictions.2 By mid-year, 2021 was already the most prolific year for abortion legislation, with 21 state governments enacting restrictive abortion laws.3 In the most extreme case, the Texas legislature prohibited abortion beyond six weeks of gestation with Senate Bill 8 (SB 8), effectively banning most abortions; healthcare providers estimated that 85 to 90% of patients seeking an abortion in Texas were beyond the six-week mark.4\n\nOn December 1, 2021, the Supreme Court heard arguments in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, in which the state of Mississippi has asked the court to reverse all prior abortion decisions. This would remove federal protections of the right to abortion before fetal viability, allowing states to establish laws that could restrict abortion completely. While a formal decision is not expected until June 2022, the majority of justices are in favor of reversing or weakening Roe v. Wade.5,6\n\nWhen abortion access is restricted, women seeking an abortion experience more stress, incur more out-of-pocket expenses, and must travel farther to obtain care.7 Restricting access to abortion services is also associated with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes.7–9 When restrictive legislation was enacted at the state-level in Texas, women of color were disproportionately affected. Average abortion rates progressively decreased as distance to clinics increased, but women of color were less likely to successfully obtain an abortion than White women.10 While disparities in abortion care have previously been documented, the scale and degree of impact on sociodemographic groups with state bans has not been investigated in a published study.11 Herein we quantify how distance to abortion care is expected to change in the US without Roe v. Wade.\n\nMethods\n\nA list of 1,045 abortion clinics was obtained from the Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH) group’s Abortion Facilities Database. ANSIRH is based at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), and the database is updated periodically. Clinics that have closed (N = 238) or do not provide abortion services (N = 294) were excluded, leaving a total of 739 clinics for analysis.\n\nCounty-level characteristics were obtained for women aged 15–49 in 3,108 counties in the contiguous US, and these attributes were applied to the county population-weighted centroids. We examined differences in expected increase in distance to care by race (Black, White, American Indian, Asian, Pacific Islander, Multiple Races), ethnicity (Hispanic or Latinx, not Hispanic or Latinx), educational attainment (some high school, high school diploma, some college, college degree), poverty, and rurality. Racial and ethnic composition and population estimates for 2019 were obtained from the US Census Bureau (USCB).12 Poverty, education, and rurality measures were obtained from the USDA Economic Rural Development Society (ERDS), which were based on the 2020 Census and 2015-2019 American Community Survey (ACS).13,14 Of note, ACS measures of educational attainment only describe individuals aged 25 or older.\n\nTwenty-one states have legislation in place that would almost certainly ban abortion if Roe v. Wade were overturned or weakened, and five additional states would be likely to ban abortion without federal protections in place.15 These include most Southern states (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia), areas of the Midwest (Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Wisconsin) and parts of the West (Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Wyoming).15\n\nChange in distance to abortion clinics was out primary outcome, with a secondary outcome of the amount of change in distance. Using ArcGIS Pro software from the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), Euclidean distance to the nearest abortion clinic was calculated in miles for all county centroids.16,17 Clinics in states likely to ban abortion were then removed, and the Euclidean distance was re-calculated. If distance to abortion care increased, that county population was considered to be affected by potential abortion bans. These geographic measures were merged with sociodemographic variables, and the resulting data were analyzed further in R statistical software. Counties were grouped by expected increase in distance to abortion care (no change, ≤50 miles, ≤100 miles, ≤150 miles, ≤300 miles, ≤400 miles, and >400 miles). Distance increments were chosen for interpretability and visualization, with larger increments at greater distances.\n\nResults\n\nMore than half (62.6%) of all U.S. women currently live within 10 miles of an abortion clinic, but if state-level abortion bans go into effect, only 39.0 percent of women would live that close. Most counties (N = 1694, 62.0%) would experience an increase in distance to abortion clinics. The median distance to the nearest clinic is currently 38.9 miles, but with bans the typical distance would increase almost three-fold (median: 113.0 miles).\n\nWith state-level abortion bans, about 50 million women aged 15–49 (59.5% of this population) would live in counties without a clinic — 1.7-times more than present. As Figure 1 shows, wide swathes of the country would have to travel hundreds of miles for care, including most of the South, portions of the Midwest, and throughout the Intermountain West. Figure 2 illustrates where the change would have the most pronounced impact, with county populations experiencing the greatest change in distance to care. In the top map of Figure 2, dark red areas represent counties with an increase of greater than 100-fold. These are primarily urban counties containing abortion clinics, and populations in these areas would experience the most dramatic impacts. For instance, a typical person in Miami-Dade County, Florida currently needs to travel less than a mile for care — but that distance would increase by 426 miles. The lower map in Figure 2 shows this change in distance in terms of miles. Distance to care would increase by hundreds of miles for the Deep South, with no bordering states providing care. Table 1 shows county-level sociodemographic characteristics by expected change in distance (no change, ≤50 mi, ≤100 mi, ≤150 mi, ≤300 mi, ≤400 mi, >400 mi).\n\nBoth rural and urban areas will be impacted if state-level bans are implemented. About 59% of rural counties (N = 1,077) and 66% of urban counties (N = 865) will be affected. Of Both rural and urban areas will be impacted if state-level bans are implemented. About 66% of rural counties (N = 680) and 60% of urban counties (N = 1,014) will be affected. Of the 46 counties that will see an increase of more than 400 miles, 89.1% are also urban. As shown in Figure 2, the relative change in distance to care would increase most dramatically in urban areas, where most clinics are currently located.11 More than 36 million women in urban areas will be impacted to some degree. Relatively small changes (increases of less than 50 miles) will be experienced by more rural areas (56.9%), because most clinics are further from rural populations. Across all groups, 68.7% of women of reproductive age in rural populations would see an increase in distance required to reach an abortion clinic.\n\nEconomic measures tend to change as distance to care increases. The most affluent group, with the highest median household income at $60,724, will experience no change in distance to care. Poverty levels (11.1%) are also lowest in this group and highest (14.0%) in the next group, which will experience the smallest impacts (change of ≤50 mi). In unaffected areas, a college degree is the most common educational attainment (24%). In places with relatively minor impacts (change of ≤50 mi), a high school diploma is more common than a college degree (21.9% vs. 16.3%). Areas with the biggest impacts (change of >400 miles) also have the highest proportion of people without a high school diploma at 10.9% and the highest poverty rate (14.9%).\n\nProportions of Asian people and those of two or more races were highest in areas with no change. In these counties, 12.0% of people are Black. By contrast, counties with the biggest expected impacts are 18.5% Black. This group also has the lowest proportion of White people at 74.3%, although 45.0% of the people in these areas are also Hispanic or Latinx. This area, visualized in the absolute change map of Figure 2, consists of most of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, encompassing large regions of Texas and Florida, most of Louisiana, and areas of Mississippi and Alabama. It also includes one county in Montana.\n\nAbout 45 million women of reproductive age (53.5%) will experience no change in distance to abortion care. Roughly 16 million (19.3%) may have to travel up to 150 miles further than they do currently. Combined, 24 million women (29.3%) will see an increase in travel distance greater than 150 miles to obtain care.\n\nIt is important to note that, while the degree and relative amount of impact varies across demographic groups, all sociodemographic groups would, on average, see an increase in distance to abortion care on average.\n\nDiscussion\n\nMillions of women would be affected by state-level abortion restrictions, and racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in distance to care would be exacerbated. These results represent the worse-case scenario, assuming Roe v. Wade is overturned all 26 states restrict abortion to the point that all clinics close. However, because 12 states (including Utah) have “trigger” bans3 — set to take effect immediately if Roe v. Wade is overturned — some of these impacts are guaranteed to take effect, if the Supreme Court rules in favor of Mississippi.\n\nWhile distance to abortion care will increase dramatically in some areas, access will be more difficult for some than others. Women with resources enabling them to travel will likely be more successful in obtaining an abortion. However, our results show that distance to abortion care would increase the most for counties whose populations are already the most disadvantaged. This could exacerbate existing healthcare disparities, both geospatial and sociodemographic.19\n\nAcross all distance to care, there will be urban and rural populations. Rural areas, which already have disparate access to healthcare, will be positioned even further from abortion care. Some urban areas, despite having concentrated populations and greater demand for health services, would become deserts for abortion care, as shown in Figure 1. Salt Lake City, Utah, for example, has the nearest abortion clinic to some parts of Wyoming, Idaho, and Nevada. Without it, even Salt Lake City residents would need to travel hundreds of miles to reach the nearest clinic, in Colorado. Changes like this could create a complex issue of managing reproductive care for a variety of geographically diverse populations, and meeting this need will likely require a multi-pronged approach.\n\nGiven the magnitude of state-level bans, we expect to see a variety of large-scale impacts from state-level bans, particularly if these policies do not increase contraceptive access. Unfortunately, some women will likely be desperate enough to resort to unsafe methods for terminating their pregnancy.8 Poor access to abortion care is associated with poor maternal and infant health, and many groups may experience increases in these impacts.9 With millions more women living farther from care, the clinics that remain open will likely experience higher patient volume. After restrictions were imposed in Texas in 2020, the number of out-of-state abortions increased by more than 600%.20\n\nIn some ways, the Supreme Court’s decision could set women’s health back decades — however, America today is not the same as pre-Roe America. Women can easily learn about their options online. They can find providers, connect with advocates, and learn about the dangers of attempting to end their pregnancy without a medical professional. As always with the internet, misinformation will likely spread as well.\n\nLimitations\n\nBecause we used areal units, this study is subject to ecological bias. The ability to obtain an abortion likely varies within counties, and beyond this, people with financial means can travel farther distances for care. Furthermore, the demographic composition of counties does not perfectly reflect the populations seeking an abortion.\n\nWe used Euclidean distance to approximate travel distance. Calculating Euclidean distance with population-weighted centroids tends to underestimate driving distance to healthcare facilities in both rural and urban areas.19 However, not all women have access to a vehicle, and in regions where women may need to travel hundreds of miles for care, those with financial means may choose to travel by airplane. Because Euclidean distance performs equally well for rural and urban areas and does not assume mode of travel, we preferred this method.\n\nMedication abortions are becoming more widely available, although these may be targeted by state-level policies, as well. These may be sought online, preventing travel, but it will be difficult to predict the scale of medication abortions, particularly when obtained illegally.\n\nThe disparities described here only reflect the disparities in distance to care — but this will likely compound with other disparities. As this study was conducted at the county level, we were not able to parse out the intersectionality of these issues, although it is worthy of further investigation.\n\nConclusion\n\nMillions of women will be impacted if Roe v. Wade is overturned or weakened. State-level abortion bans may exacerbate racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities. Healthcare professionals and patient advocates should prepare to address these disparities and provide for patients as abortion care dynamics evolve.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH), University of California, San Francisco, for providing abortion facility data.\n\nFunding: The authors have no conflicts of interest or funding sources to declare.\n\nData Sharing: County-level data and a data dictionary will be made available to others upon publication (brenna.kelly@hsc.utah.edu).

Associations between prepregnancy and prenatal depression and/or anxiety and PTB were evaluated using Poisson regression models accounting for stratified survey sampling.\n\nResults: Women with prepregnancy and prenatal depression and anxiety, compared to those without, had a 67 percent (95% CI: 19%, 134%) higher probability of experiencing PTB, after controlling for relevant sociodemographic, lifestyle, and reproductive history factors. Impact of depression on PTB was slightly higher than impact of anxiety. Hispanic/Latina ethnicity was found to protect against PTB for those with prepregnancy and prenatal depression alone (aPR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.24, 1.21) or both depression and anxiety (aPR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.18, 1.40) compared to being non-Hispanic/Latina (aPR: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.25, 2.55 for depression alone; aPR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.18, 2.21 for depression and anxiety).\n\nConclusions: Overall, Utah women reporting prepregnancy and prenatal depression and anxiety were more likely to have a PTB. Being of Hispanic/Latina ethnicity was found to mitigate the risk of PTB among women with depression and anxiety.\n\nImplications: Prepregnancy and prenatal mental health screenings and treatment are key to lessening the impacts of depression and anxiety on both mother and infant. Hispanic/Latina ethnicity may be protective against PTB among women experiencing mental distress. Whether this is through increased social support or through a different mechanism should be explored in future research.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn 2019, the national preterm birth (PTB) rate rose for the fifth year in a row, affecting approximately 10 percent of infants and causing growing concern among medical and public health officials.2 PTB poses several risks to an infant including immature lungs, difficulty regulating body temperature, poor feeding, and slow weight gain.3 Maternal depression and anxiety have been directly linked to PTB, with long-term effects on both mother and baby.4-7 This is especially relevant since depression is the most common psychiatric disorder in the US and highest among women, with anxiety not far behind.9 A recent study reported that women with both mental health disorders were found to have a higher rate of PTB than those with only depression, only anxiety, or without either disorder.10 An extensive body of prior literature has established that a history of prepregnancy depression and anxiety is a strong risk factor for prenatal depression11-17 and that prepregnancy and prenatal depression and anxiety are highly comorbid.18,19 For that reason, this study explores the potential cumulative impact of prepregnancy and prenatal depression and anxiety (PPDA) on the likelihood of PTB in Utah. Ethnicity is also highly associated with the risk of PTB,20 and this study will look at what effect Hispanic/Latina ethnicity, which makes up the second-largest ethnic group in Utah, may have on risk for PTB.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy Population: This is a cross-sectional study design using data from the Utah Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (UT-PRAMS) survey, Phase 8 (January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2019). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) developed the standardized data collection methodology used for the national-level PRAMS survey and continues to provide oversight for the survey’s methodology and protocol.21-23 PRAMS is a mixed-mode surveillance system (mail and telephone) that uses birth certificate information as its population-based sampling frame. One key aspect of PRAMS is the stratified systematic sampling, which oversamples on features related to high-risk women such as mothers of low­-birthweight infants, living in high-risk geographic areas, and belonging to racial/ethnic minority groups.21\n\nUT-PRAMS Phase 8 drew stratified (by maternal education and infant birthweight) samples of approximately 200 new mothers (2–6 months after delivery of a live birth) every month.24 New mothers were contacted via mailed questionnaire (available in English and Spanish) multiple times and telephone follow-up. An informed consent document was included with each survey packet explaining the participants’ rights. Consent is implied if the survey is completed. The total sample of Utah mothers completing the PRAMS Phase 8 questionnaire was 5814, reflecting an estimated population of 188,700 women. The sample comprises 16.2 percent Hispanic/Latinas and 10.9 percent non-White, making it representative of Utah’s race/ethnicity makeup consisting of Hispanic/Latinas (14.4%), Blacks or African Americans (1.5%), American Indians or Alaskan Natives (1.6%), Asians (2.7%), Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders (1.1%), or those of two or more races (2.2%).25 The expected national PRAMS response rate is 60%, with Utah exceeding this goal at 65% (2016), 66% (2017), 62% (2018), and 69.5% (2019).\n\nMothers’ responses were linked to extracted birth certificate data items, including pregnancy complications for index birth. The PRAMS weighting process produces an analysis weight considering the stratified sampling along with nonresponse and noncoverage components. The analysis weight of the PRAMS data can be interpreted as the number of women like herself in the population that each respondent represents. This study and the use of PRAMS data (de-identified) have been acknowledged by the University of Utah Institutional Review Board as nonhuman subject research.\n\nOutcome: The primary outcome of interest was whether or not a woman experienced PTB, defined as a live birth before 37 weeks into the pregnancy.2 The obstetric estimation of gestation, which uses ultrasonography within the first two trimesters to determine gestational age and the estimated delivery date, is added to the birth certificate within 24–48 hours of the birth.26,27 However, it is important to note that the obstetric estimation of gestation may vary by up to 10–14 days.28\n\nExposure: The PRAMS questionnaire asks women whether they had experienced depression or anxiety (each requiring yes/no answers) during the 3 months before the most recent pregnancy (prepregnancy) or during the most recent pregnancy (prenatal). We created a combined impact variable to include women who had both depression and anxiety in the 3 months prior to conception and during pregnancy (PPDA). This combined impact variable was chosen due to the common comorbidity of these 2 disorders in women (both prepregnant and prenatal) as well as the possibility that the combination for a sustained period of time may result in a cumulative impact increasing the risk for PTB.\n\nCovariates: Confounding factors believed to influence both depression and anxiety as well as PTB were determined based on prior literature. Demographic and lifestyle factors included race/ethnicity, maternal age, marital status, maternal education, total household income, and body mass index (BMI). Additionally, smoking, drinking, and prior history of high blood pressure and diabetes as well as reproductive history were also considered as potential confounding factors.7,20, 29-32 Given prior theories on the role that maternal race/ethnicity may play in mental health-adverse birth outcome associations,33 we additionally tested whether Hispanic/Latina ethnicity may modify the association between prepregnancy and prenatal depression and/or anxiety and PTB.\n\nStatistical Analysis: Participant characteristics were reported by the exposure of interest (ie, PPDA) and took into account PRAMS’ weighted analysis formatting.19 All variables were dichotomous or categorical and reported as weighted percentages.\n\nTo explore the associations between prepregnancy and prenatal depression and/or anxiety and PTB, we used Poisson regression models with a robust error variance. The models, accounting for PRAMS’ use of stratified sampling, generated adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).34,35 The referent group was women without PPDA. Mothers who did not have data for key exposure variables were removed from the analysis population. Effect modification by Hispanic/Latina ethnicity was conducted via a stratified analysis and on a multiplicative scale using the Wald test. Stata 15.1 was used for the analysis.\n\nResults\n\nAfter excluding missing values from key exposure variables (depression before/during pregnancy and anxiety before/during pregnancy), 4166 women (72%) were included in the primary analyses, reflecting an estimated population of 136,090 women (Figure 1).\n\nAmong this study population, 13 percent had PPDA while 87 percent did not (Table 1). White non-Hispanic/Latina women were more likely to report PPDA (16%) compared to white Hispanic/Latina women (11%).\n\nThe median age was 28 years (mean age 28.8, SE 8.7). The majority of women were White (89.1%), non-Hispanic/Latina (83.8%), married (83.3%), had at least some college (72.9%), and did not smoke (91.5%) or drink alcohol (67.6%) within 2 years before pregnancy. A high percentage did not have the common comorbidities of diabetes (99.6%) or high blood pressure (98.8%) within 2 years prior to pregnancy. Household income ranged from $20,001 to $57,000 for 46.4 percent of the population and was above $57,001 for the remaining participants (Table 1).\n\nAlmost a third of mothers in this study gave birth for the first time (34.8%) while the others had experienced 1–3 (56.7%), 4–7 (8.2%), and 8+ (0.3%) previous live births, respectively. Of those with previous live births, 98.1% delivered a single child, 1.8% delivered twins, and 0.1% delivered multiples. Of women with a previous live birth 5% of women reported previous PTB. The prepregnancy BMI categories for participants was underweight (10.7%), normal weight (50.8%), overweight (13.5%), and obese (25%). Women with PPDA, compared to those without, were more likely to have a history of smoking and/or drinking alcohol within the past 2 years, to be obese, have high blood pressure, a history of PTB, and/or given birth to multiples.\n\nAssociation Between Depression and/or Anxiety and Preterm Birth: In the unadjusted analysis we found that women reporting PPDA, compared to those without, were 1.55 (95% CI, 1.22, 1.99) times more likely to experience PTB. Those with depression alone were 1.48 (95% CI, 1.18, 1.85) times more likely to experience PTB, and those with anxiety alone were 1.44 (95% CI, 1.17, 1.78) times more likely (Table 2).\n\nAfter adjusting for maternal race, age, household income, marital status, and education level, women with PPDA, compared to those without, were 1.67 (95% CI, 1.19, 2.34) more likely to have PTB. Those with depression were 1.54 (95% CI, 1.15, 2.07) times more likely to experience PTB, while those with anxiety were 1.51 (95% CI, 1.16, 1.96) times more likely (Table 2).\n\nAfter additional adjustment for previous preterm births, number of previous live born, recurrent diabetes and/or high blood pressure, BMI, and smoking and drinking within the previous 2 years, those with PPDA were 1.59 (95% CI, 1.05, 2.40) more likely to have PTB, while those with depression were 1.56 (95% CI, 1.08, 2.24) more likely to experience PTB and those with anxiety 1.31 (95% CI, 0.95, 1.78) more likely (Table 2). Stratification by Hispanic/Latina ethnicity showed effect modification for prepregnancy and prenatal depression and PTB in both the parsimoniously adjusted model and fully adjusted model (Wald P for both=0.04) (Table 3).\n\nDiscussion\n\nAfter accounting for relevant sociodemographic, lifestyle, and reproductive history factors, women with prepregnancy and prenatal depression and anxiety, compared to those without, had a 67 percent higher probability of experiencing PTB. Women experiencing depression but not anxiety had a 56 percent higher probability of experiencing PTB, and those with anxiety but not depression were 51 percent more likely to have PTB. Our findings indicate that among the entire study population, the cumulative effect of depression and anxiety has a greater potential impact on PTB risk than either alone. Effect modification by Hispanic/Latina ethnicity was found to act as a protective factor against PTB for those with prepregnancy and prenatal depression and anxiety as well as those with depression only.36\n\nStrengths of the Study: The use of PRAMS data allows for a population-based analysis that is representative of all women in Utah, including at-risk women, due to its systematic stratified sampling scheme. Our ability to capture self-reported depression and anxiety data before and during pregnancy and to link these data to birth records for PTB assessment is novel, especially since questions on maternal depression and anxiety were added to the UT-PRAMS survey only in 2016.37 The UT-PRAMS questionnaire and linked birth records also allow us to take into account multiple important confounding factors including sociodemographic, lifestyle, health, and reproductive history.\n\nLimitations of the Data: This study faces the limitation of selection bias by only focusing on mothers who had a live birth.38,39 The precision and accuracy of obstetric estimation of gestation, which can vary up to 14 days, may potentially lead to misclassification bias. Missing data for the outcome, key exposures, and covariates could lead to selection bias. Recall bias may also be a factor, as the questionnaire asks women at 2–6 months postpartum on experiences they had before and during pregnancy. Social desirability bias may also be a factor as not all mothers may wish to report on their smoking, drinking, or drug use due to the stigma associated with them. Additionally, the PRAMS questionnaire asks women to confirm that they experienced anxiety and/or depression before and during pregnancy without regard to standardized testing and clinical diagnoses.40 This may result in the data overestimating the prevalence of diagnosed depression and anxiety or underestimating based on poor screening.41 The severity of the mental disorder(s) is also not addressed. During PRAMS Phase 8, 43.8% of women were screened for depression during the 12 months before pregnancy, compared with 68.9% during prenatal care visits, and 85.9% during postpartum health care visits. This study did not explore the impact of stress and abuse factors on PTB among UT-PRAMS participants. The intensity of alcohol consumption and tobacco use are not provided in the data, which may directly impact the potential association between health behavior and the risk of PTB; these questions should be included in future questionnaires. The impact of prepregnancy and prenatal depression and/or anxiety on postpartum depression would also benefit from additional study.2, 42 Finally, we were not able to explore how race may modify the association between maternal depression and/or anxiety and PTB due to only having access to dichotomous race variable (White vs non-White). Given the high rate of PTB among Black women, more research is needed on potential factors that can explain this disparity.33\n\nInterpretation: The findings of an association between prepregnancy and prenatal depression and anxiety and PTB is in harmony with a large body of prior research.2, 7, 25, 34-45 It is notable that many studies look at depression and anxiety separately instead of as ongoing comorbidities, and this has led to varying results in the literature.2,17,27 Adhikhari, et al, found that when depression and anxiety coexist, the symptoms are likely to be more severe and pose a higher risk of PTB.7 Similar to our findings, both maternal smoking and alcohol consumption can increase the risk of PTB.46-50 Unlike other studies,24,29 however, our study did not find that age played a significant role in predicting PTB among women with prepregnancy and prenatal depression and anxiety. This may be because only 13.4% of this sample fell in the high-risk categories of under 18 or over 35 years of age. Liu, et al, reported that prepregnancy obesity is associated with PTB in the general population, which is similar to this study’s findings of a mild association between obesity (BMI >29) and PTB.\n\nThe finding of Hispanic/Latina ethnicity as a protective factor against PTB is also in line with existing literature.26, 27, 46 Future research should delve further into reasons that Hispanic/Latina ethnicity may be protective, including through increased social support, as has been hypothesized.26, 27, 46\n\nHealth Implications\n\nPregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time for mothers, and the cumulative impact of prepregnancy and prenatal depression and anxiety can affect maternal mood and increase the likelihood of PTB and impaired fetal development. This, in turn, can lead to long-lasting psychological and neurological effects for the child.32 Additional research with a larger, more diverse group is needed to further test the overall associations between a mother’s age, race, ethnicity, and prepregnancy and prenatal depression and anxiety, and PTB.52,53 Mental health screening during prepregnancy, prenatal, and postpartum visits is imperative to develop appropriate mitigation measures.54\n\nConclusion\n\nBy looking at the existence of both depression and anxiety from prepregnancy to birth, the prevalence and cumulative impact of these mental disorders and their association with experiencing PTB can be better understood. This study highlights a positive association, which translates into a higher risk for PTB among women who experience the cumulative impact of prepregnancy and prenatal depression and anxiety, compared to those with only one disorder or none at all. The finding of an effect modification by Hispanic/Latina ethnicity emphasizes the impact of, most likely, social factors associated with maternal ethnicity and the risk of PTB.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nData were provided by the Utah Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System (PRAMS), a project of the Utah Department of Health (UDOH), the Office of Vital Records and Health Statistics of the UDOH, and the Centers for Disease Control Prevention and Prevention (CDC) of the US Health and Human Services Department.

Printed by request in The Utah Women’s Health Review\n\nSetting the Stage\n\nThe benefits of physical activity are well documented and improve all aspects of health and overall wellbeing.1 Globally, on average, 37.1% of women are insufficiently physically active while only 23.4% of men are2; this trend is also found in Utah, where 19.4% of women are insufficiently physically active while only 17.6% of men are.3 While women often live longer than men, they are frequently in worse health.4 Physical inactivity con-tributes to the development and severity of chronic diseases including cardiovas-cular disease, diabetes, and hypertension.5 In addition to affecting physical health, physical inactivity is also associated with poor mental health. Physical activity can contribute to positive self-image and improved confidence, which is critical for meaningful community participation as well as developing interpersonal relationships.\n\nThe Utah Women & Leadership Project (UWLP) seeks to better understand the status, experiences, and challenges of Utah women in order to strengthen the impact of women and girls.6 This snapshot summarizes research regarding physical activity levels, access, and barriers for girls (ages 7–11) and young women (ages 12–17) to help decision makers understand that instilling physically active habits early can improve the health and wellbeing of Utah women for the rest of their lives. This research snapshot reviews three key areas:\n\n1) Gender physical activity levels and the importance of physical activity;\n\n2) Gender physical activity factors; and\n\n3) Recommendations to increase physical activity of Utah girls and young women.\n\nGuidelines & Comparison\n\nNational Recommendations\n\nThe majority of Americans do not meet the physical activity guidelines recommended for their age. It is advised that children and adolescents, ages 6 to 17, get 60 minutes or more of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity each day. For adults, at least 150–300 minutes of moderate intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity per week, or a combination of both, is recommended.7 In terms of steps, the daily recommended average for adolescents and adults is 10,000, and for girls it is 11,500.8 However, due to a number of barriers (see “Specific Gender Barriers” section), women and girls are not meeting the guidelines at disproportionately high rates compared to men and boys.\n\nUtah Comparison\n\nIn Utah, 28% of boys meet the recommended physical activity levels set by the state, compared to only 14% of girls (see Figure 1).9 These numbers have been consistent over the past ten years, meaning half as many girls and young women are regularly getting recommended physical activity as compared to boys and young men. An analysis of the American College Health Association’s National College Health Assessment III data found that female college students were significantly less likely to meet physical activity guidelines compared to male college students.10 Research has found that women of various ages report facing more barriers to physical activity than men.11\n\nSpecific Gender Barriers\n\nLack of Options\n\nA major barrier for girls and young women mentioned in the literature in terms of participating in fitness activities is the lack of options for physical activity that they prefer.13 Most physical education classes consist primarily of competitive sports, which young women identified as their least favored activity. Women, young and old, show preferences for yoga, walking, biking, and dancing. The scarcity of what they see as viable options, in combination with the lack of discussions with girls and young women on their preferred choice for physical activity, leads to lower rates of participation. When girls and young women are offered different options for physical activity, studies show there are increased levels of autonomy, self-determination, and participation.14 Studies also suggest that accounting for preferences when developing physical education curricula and after-school physical activity programs can increase participation among young women.15\n\nMen prefer different types of physical activity than women. Unsurprisingly, men prefer strength training, and women tend to prefer moderate intensity cardiovascular activities.16 One study found that when given a list of common exercises to perform, male teens and young adults chose strength training exercises and females chose low-impact cardiovascular activities.17 Interestingly, the benefits of physical activity differ for men and women depending on what types of exercise they participate in. One research team found that women who participate in regular, low-impact activities report higher levels of self-esteem and quality of life compared to women who participate in regular, high-intensity activities.18 These researchers found that the opposite is true for males, which suggests the need for a gender-tailored approach to engaging young adults in physical activity.\n\nGender Roles and Perceptions\n\nSocietal gender roles are strongly associated with young women’s lack of participation in physical activity. Children, youth, and young adults have differing views on the functionality of their bodies based on their biological sex.19 Notably, young women experience negative social feedback after participating in a school physical education class if they are not able to shower or change clothes because of how they appear to others, especially to boys.20 Teen women prioritize conforming to socially accepted ideals of beauty, which include being small, slight, and soft. This may come from the perceived lack of social capital for women participating in physical activity beyond maintaining feminine attractiveness.21\n\nPositive body image is correlated with increased levels of physical activity,22 yet Utah women have low rates of body acceptance, which may be a factor in correlated low rates of physical activity. A 2017 UWLP report23 revealed the high rates of cosmetic surgery per capita in Salt Lake City in past years, which trumped that of Los Angeles and was second only to Miami. This report documented the problem that follows from society assessing a woman’s success based on her attractiveness, which reduces a woman’s identity and potential to the shape of her body and increases sexual objectification.\n\nAnother study found that the benefits of physical activity, including reduced levels of stress, were lost if the motivating factor to exercise was weight loss or body toning.24 More specifically, it found that motivating reasons to exercise predicted quality of life outcomes for women over actual exercise. This is concerning as research has found that conforming to societal ideas of attractiveness, including thinness, is, again, young women’s main motivator to participate in physical activity. Encouraging girls and women of all ages to participate for reasons beyond maintaining or achieving attractiveness has been shown to increase their motivation to be physically active.\n\nLack of Social Support\n\nSocial support from friends was noted as a key factor to girls and young women engaging in physical activity, yet many noted that social support from friends, parents, and teachers to participate was lacking. Girls and young women report less enjoyment in physical activity and less confidence in their abilities as they get older, which may stem from consistent lack of societal encouragement to be physically active, as well as societal pressure to not be competitive or strong.25 The lack of social support also appears in the inadequate facilities and gym attire provided for young women.26 Young women report inadequate changing and showering facilities, a lack of time for showering, and inappropriate gym attire (such as short skirts) as reasons they do not participate in physical education.27 Feeling self-conscious about their physical appearance while wearing exercise or fitness clothing is another barrier to participation in physical activity that teen women face.28\n\nAdditional Barriers for Women of Color\n\nSeveral research studies have reported a variety of additional barriers related to physical activity for girls and women of color.29 For example, one Utah study found that, culturally, Pacific Islanders felt it was unacceptable for women to be in the sun and sweat, which could reduce women’s physical activity. In addition, research by the Women’s Sports Foundation found that the drop-out rate for urban girls of color doubles that of suburban white girls, largely due to increased poverty resulting in a lack of resources.30 Several studies identified hair health among young African American women as a barrier to physical activity.31 One team of qualitative researchers found that perspiration on hair and hair style maintenance, image, and social comparisons, along with the lack of solutions to overcome hair-related issues, were all barriers to physical activity for the women of color interviewed.32 Participants of the study also mentioned how the monetary and time burdens of fixing and maintaining hair styles further contributed to the issue.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nSince the passage of Title IX in 1972 mandated that federally funded educational institutions must provide women equal opportunity in sports, the number of women participating in sports went from one in 27 girls to today’s two in five girls participating.33 While large strides have been made in women’s sports, gaps still exist. According to The National Federation of State High School Associations, in 2018–2019, boys across the nation had 1.13 million more sports opportunities than girls.34 In Utah alone, close to 39,000 boys participate in sports compared to just over 28,000 girls. A nearly 1:1 male-to-female population ratio in Utah leaves almost 11,000 more opportunities for boys to participate in sports than girls.35 About 87% of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) schools still provide disproportionately more opportunities to men.36\n\nWhile there are many programs in Utah and the nation that promote physical activity, few have the specific goal of increasing physical activity levels of girls and young women. Although the problem is recognized, solutions have been slow to be adopted. Research has suggested the following recommendations to address and resolve these problems:\n\nFirst, parents and guardians should encourage physical activity for girls and young women. Fewer things have greater impact on a girl’s long-term physical activity levels than her parent’s own physical activity and their enthusiastic encouragement. Findings from the LOOK Longitudinal Study revealed that lower participation in physical activity among girls was associated with weaker influences at the school and family levels.37 These findings suggest that a girl’s lack of involvement in physical activity has roots in sociocultural norms and can be changed with education. Another study reviewed 180 nine-year-old girls and their parents to examine parenting strategies that led to long-term increases in their daughter’s physical activity levels.38 It was found that logistic support (e.g., registering their daughters for sports teams and facilitating transportation to sports events) and explicit modeling (such as the parents themselves participating in physical activity) led to increases in physical activity among the girls studied. The study also reported that having just one physically active parent can have a positive impact on a girl’s long-term participation in physical activity and overall health.\n\nSecond, the most basic way to ensure that girls and women have physical activity options that are favorable to them is by asking what they enjoy doing and then tailoring physical activity options accordingly as preferences may vary by age group, particularly in school physical education classes. Studies39 have reported that girls and women are more likely to be physically active when they enjoy what they are doing and have opportunities to participate with friends and peers as well.\n\nThird, promote gender inclusivity in all types of sports. Researchers40 have found that gendered trends in sports limit teens’ potential by pressuring young men to participate in competitive sports while discouraging girls and young women from doing the same. Encouraging children to explore sports and physical activities that interest them, rather than the ones that girls typically play, can lead to increased interest and engagement.\n\nFinally, improving the visibility of women’s athletics can improve girls’ and young women’s interest in sports, and it can increase societal interest as well. Ensuring that women athletes have access to adequate and equitable facilities, preventative care, media coverage,41 sponsorship, and funding can increase the credibility of women’s sports. In turn, the fanbase and social support will increase, resulting in expanded opportunities. An important byproduct will be the encouragement young women show for each other as they pursue athletics and, in the long term, a physically active life.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe benefits of physical activity are clear, yet thousands of Utah girls and women are participating at significantly lower levels than boys and men. With only 28% of boys and 14% of girls meeting the recommended physical activity levels set by the state, change is needed for all.42 Exploring the barriers associated with the lower levels of participation, specifically for females, has laid the groundwork for the recommendations for change offered in this snapshot. The way forward requires parental involvement and role-modeling, asking girls and women what they want to do and then providing support for those activities (even if the choices are historically associated with the male gender), and making women’s athletic pursuits and events equally visible for everyone. Finding ways to increase the physical activity of girls and women will improve their overall health and wellbeing, which, in turn, will impact the health and wellbeing of Utah families, communities, and the state as a whole.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nSpecial thanks to Angie Kleven for her research support and to our expert reviewers for their feedback: Lori Andersen Spruance (Brigham Young University), Robyn Bretzing (Alpine School District), Tim Brusseau (University of Utah), Ryan Burns (University of Utah), Liz Darger (Brigham Young University), Brett McIff (EPICC), Maya Miyairi (Utah State University), Brenda Ralls (EPICC), and Jason Slack (Utah Valley University).\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Reproductive history and life stress (partner-related, traumatic, financial, and emotional), women with a history of physical abuse had a 1.56 higher adjusted prevalence ratio (95% CI: 1.19, 2.07) of experiencing PPD compared to their counterparts after adjusting for sociodemographic factors. In addition, partner-related stress was also independently associated with PPD, with a 1.32 higher prevalence ratio (95% CI: 1.07, 1.65) of PPD among women reporting partner-related stress compared to those who did not, adjusting for the same factors.\n\nAbstract\n\nObjective: To assess whether a history of physical abuse and stressful life events were associated with postpartum depression (PPD) among at-risk women.\n\nMethods: Included were Utah women who gave birth between 2016 and 2018 who agreed to participate in the Utah Pregnancy Risk Monitoring System (UT-PRAMS). UT-PRAMs follows a stratified systematic sampling scheme, oversampling on lower levels of education and lower infant birth weight. Considering important confounding factors and a stratified sampling scheme, relationships between maternal history of physical abuse, life stressors (partner, traumatic, financial, or emotional stressors), and PPD were assessed via Poisson regression models with robust error variance.\n\nResults: From January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018, 4,101 participants, representative of an estimated population of 142,963 women, completed the UT-PRAMS survey. After adjusting for maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, income, marital status, prior preterm births, parity, depression before and during pregnancy, tobacco or alcohol use and life stressors, women who experienced pre-pregnancy or prenatal physical abuse had a 1.56 (9% CI, 1.19, 2.07) higher adjusted prevalence ratio compared to women who did not. In the same fully adjusted model, partner-related stress was also independently associated with PPD (aPR 1.32; 95% CI, 1.07, 1.65).\n\nConclusion: Physical abuse and partner-related stress (including divorce/separation, frequent arguments, partner who is not supportive of the pregnancy) were significant predictors of PPD after accounting for numerous other sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health history indicators.\n\nIntroduction\n\nNegative consequences of post-partum depression (PPD) are significant, for both birthing parents and their offspring.1-6 Morbidity and mortality associated with PPD are deserving of increased scrutiny overall and especially in Utah, the nation’s youngest state (median age 30.5 years)7 and fourth-most fertile state, with a fertility rate of 68.4 births per 1,000 women aged 15 through 44 years.8 National prevalence of PPD among postpartum women is 12.5 percent9; in Utah, the PPD prevalence is 15.3 percent among mothers.\n\nSeveral factors known to contribute to risk for PPD are pronounced in Utah.10 The state ranks last in the nation for pay parity between men and women.11 A growing body of research demonstrates that socioeconomic factors, including lack of pay parity, may collectively have multiplicative synergistic impact on adverse health outcomes, including depression and addiction.12-15 Significantly, an estimated 36.9 percent of Utah women have been victims of domestic violence, compared to the national average of approximately 25 percent, and Utah is rated the 17th-worst state in the nation for domestic violence.7\n\nThe 2-fold purpose of this study was to examine (1) the association between physical abuse (pre-pregnancy and prenatal) and PPD and (2) the impact of stressful life events on the risk of PPD.16, 17 A better understanding of the predictors of PPD may be instrumental in designing and implementing interventions that have the potential to decrease the incidence of PPD and its adverse impacts.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy Population: This cross-sectional study18 was conducted among women who participated in the Utah Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitory System (UT-PRAMS) survey between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2018, recalling pre-pregnancy, prenatal, and early postpartum events and exposures. PRAMS is a surveillance program of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that gathers data across the nation (most states and territories as well as tribal and local health departments) and provides geographic-specific data critical in accomplishing its primary goal of reducing infant mortality, which is a common world-wide measure of overall national health.19 Since its inception in 1987, PRAMS has been utilized as a useful data source in ascertaining the changing risks and health outcomes associated with pregnancy for women and children. In addition to measuring pregnancy health, data is collected on socioeconomic status, life experiences, and quality of life, with the additional goals of mitigating risks and adverse health outcomes for women and children.\n\nTo address health risks and outcomes that are most pertinent to their unique populations, states and territories maintain a measure of control over stratifying data collection. UT-PRAMS oversamples women of lower education levels and infant birth weight to purposely capture data on a known high-risk population.20 Approximately 200 women are contacted each month and asked to complete the survey. Those contacted are randomly selected within each stratum.\n\nPrimary Exposure, Physical Abuse: The primary exposure of interest was physical abuse experienced before and during pregnancy. Participants were asked the following questions: (1) “In the 12 months before you got pregnant with your new baby, did any of the following people push, hit, slap, kick, choke, or physically hurt you in any other way?”, with options being“husband or partner,” “ex-husband or ex-partner,” and “someone else.” Participants were instructed “for each person to check ‘No’ if they did not hurt you during this time or ‘Yes’ if they did.” (2) A similar question was asked for the period of pregnancy, switching the first part of the question to “During your most recent pregnancy.”\n\nSecondary Exposure, Life Stress: The secondary exposure of interest for this study was life stress. The Phase 8 PRAMS questionnaire includes 13 questions regarding specific stressful events in the 12-month period prior to the birth of the child. The stressful events listed are (in order asked):\n\n(1) A close family member was very sick and had to go into the hospital;\n\n(2) I got separated or divorced from my husband or partner;\n\n(3) I moved to a new address;\n\n(4) I was homeless or had to sleep outside, in a car, or in a shelter;\n\n(5) My husband or partner lost his job;\n\n(6) I lost my job even though I wanted to go on working;\n\n(7) My husband, partner, or I had a cut in work hours or pay;\n\n(8) I was apart from my husband or partner due to military deployment or extended work related travel;\n\n(9) I argued with my husband or partner more than usual;\n\n(10) My husband or partner said he didn’t want me to be pregnant;\n\n(11) I had problems paying the rent, mortgage, or other bills;\n\n(12) My husband, partner, or I went to jail;\n\n(13) Someone very close to me had a problem with drinking or drugs;\n\n(14) Someone very close to me died.\n\nA dichotomous variable (yes/no) was used for each event, and the events were categorized into 1 of 4 groups: partner-related stress (questions 2, 7, 8, 9), traumatic stress (questions 4, 11, 12), financial stress (questions 5, 6, 7, 10) and emotional stress (question 1). Question 3 (move to new address) was not included in our analysis given that the outcome could be either a positive or negative experience.21\n\nPrimary Outcome: Postpartum Depression: The primary outcome measure of interest for this study was PPD, which was determined by having answered “always” or “often” to either of the following 2 UT-PRAMS questions that captured postpartum depressed mood and anhedonia: (1) “Since your new baby was born, how often have you felt down, depressed, or hopeless?”, and (2) “Since your new baby was born, how often have you had little interest or little pleasure in doing things you usually enjoyed?”\n\nCovariates: Covariates considered as potential confounding factors known to impact risk of abuse, life stress, and PPD included maternal age (continuous), race (White/non-White), ethnicity (Hispanic/non-Hispanic), marital status (married/not married), income level (≤$30,000, $30,000-$55,000, ≥$55,000), parity (continuous), history of preterm birth (yes/no), tobacco or alcohol consumption in past 2 years (yes/no), and depression before or during index pregnancy (yes/no). Lower educational attainment has also been shown to be more common among women who experience PPD,22-24 and the differences between the overall population of Utah women and the study participants are shown in Figure 1. Accounting for some missing data, 58 individuals surveyed in this data sample were under the age of 18 years and too young to have achieved education levels measured here.\n\nStatistical Analysis: Sociodemographic and health history characteristics among women with and without PPD were compared using the chi-square test for categorical and t test for continuous variables, considering the complex sampling design. To test the association between physical abuse, life stressors, and PPD, unadjusted and adjusted robust Poisson distribution models were used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Adjusted models considered maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, income, marital status, prior preterm births, parity, depression before and during pregnancy, and tobacco or alcohol use in last 2 years. An additional adjustment for pre-pregnancy and prenatal partner-related, traumatic, financial, and emotional stress was done for the final model looking at physical abuse and PPD. Similarly, an additional adjustment for pre-pregnancy and prenatal physical abuse was done for the final model looking at stressful life events and PPD. Data analysis was generated using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and Stata Software 14.2 (StataCorp, LLC, College Station, TX).\n\nResults\n\nSample Characteristics: A total of 4,101 women, representing 142,963 Utah women who delivered during that time frame, completed the UT-PRAMS survey between 2016 and 2018. Among the respondents, 72.7 percent were White, 15.0 percent White-Hispanic, 5.3 percent non-White–Hispanic, and 7.0 percent non-White, non-Hispanic. Over 77 percent of study subjects were married, 20.2 percent never married, and 2.3 percent divorced or widowed. The mean age was 28.4 years (range, 15-44 years), with approximately 22 percent living at very low income levels of $20,000 or less per year, and the highest education level of almost half of the participants (46.8%) was a high school diploma. While the World Population Review reports that nearly 37 percent of Utah women experience abuse in their lifetimes,7 only 5 percent of respondents in this study reported pre-pregnancy and/or prenatal abuse. Women with PPD compared to women without PPD were inclined to be younger, unmarried, and more likely to consume alcohol, smoke, and have a history of depression and life stress (Table 1). They also leaned toward lower education and income levels (Figures 2 and 3).\n\nPhysical Abuse and Postpartum Depression: Four percent of women reported abuse, with 3 percent reporting abuse during pregnancy (1% by husband or partner, 1% by ex-husband or ex-partner, and 1% by someone else) and 4 percent reporting abuse before pregnancy (1% by husband or partner, 2% by ex-husband or ex-partner, and 1% by someone else). Twelve percent of women with any abuse prior to or during pregnancy experienced PPD compared to 3% of women who did not report abuse (Table 1). In the unadjusted analyses, women who experienced any physical abuse had a 3.06 higher PR (95% CI, 2.43, 3.85) of having PPD compared to women who did not (Table 2). After adjusting for maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, income, marital status, prior preterm births, parity, depression before and during pregnancy, and smoking or alcohol consumption in the last two years, the aPR was 1.74 (95% CI, 1.32, 2.29). Further adjustment for partner-related, traumatic, financial, and emotional stress did not appreciably alter findings (aPR 1.56; 95% CI, 1.19, 2.07) (Table 2).\n\nLife Stressors and Postpartum Depression: Among the total sample, 25 percent of women reported partner-related stress (42% with PPD and 22% without PPD), 12 percent traumatic stress (24% with PPD and 10% without PPD), 47 percent financial stress (57% with PPD and 45% without PPD), and 28 percent emotional stress (34% with PPD and 27% without PPD) (Table 1). In the unadjusted analyses, women who experienced any partner-related, traumatic, financial, or emotional stress had a 2.12 higher PR (95% CI, 1.77, 2.53), 2.35 higher PR (95% CI, 1.93, 2.84), 1.53 higher PR (95% CI, 1.28, 1.84), and 1.29 higher PR (95% CI: 1.07, 1.56) of having PPD, respectively, than women who did not (Table 2). Adjustment for potential confounders including other stressors and physical abuse attenuated the results. However, women who reported partner-related stress, compared to those who did not, still showed a 32 percent higher prevalence of PPD (95% CI, 7%-65%) (Table 2).\n\nDiscussion\n\nFindings from this study revealed that women who were exposed to pre-pregnancy and prenatal abuse were at a 1.6 higher probability for PPD after considering numerous confounding factors such as life stressors in the year before birth. The results also suggested that exposure to life stressors, notably partner-related stress, is associated with a 1.3 higher probability of PPD after similar adjustment. Age, educational attainment, income, and marital status, among other elements, are known demographic factors that may reliably predict PPD risk. Screening of these demographic indicators in conjunction with careful exploration of exposure to partner-related abuse and experienced stress may provide opportunities for PPD prevention and mitigation interventions.\n\nThe findings from the UT-PRAMS data are validated by other studies in both low-income and high-income countries.25-29 For example, a study by Desmaraids et al. conducted in Western Canada looking at intimate partner abuse before and during pregnancy showed that 84 percent with postpartum mental health problems reported abuse before pregnancy, and 70 percent experienced abuse during pregnancy.30Similarly, Tsai et al. employed secondary data analysis among women during pregnancy and postpartum in South Africa; the study reported a significant association between intimate partner violence and depression during pregnancy and postpartum.31 Additionally, this study found both independent and adjusted significant associations between physical abuse and PPD. In a study conducted in France, Gaillard and colleagues corroborated these findings with physical abuse and depression during pregnancy having significant associations with PPD.32 Although the present study utilized a cross-sectional study design, other studies using different methods arrived at similar findings and conclusions. Rogathi et al., in a prospective cohort study of postpartum depression among women who experienced intimate partner violence, showed that the odds of having postpartum depression increased by more than 3 times compared to women who did not.33 Similar to the present study, younger women were inclined to develop more PPD than older women.33\n\nThe effects of physical abuse, coupled with other social health factors, can be long-lasting. A study of physical, sexual, and social health factors with associated trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms in pregnant women showed that 32.7 percent of women manifested subclinical depressive symptoms with 9 percent showing persistent symptoms of depression up to 4 years postpartum.34\n\nThe present study also found that partner-related stress, such as arguments, was a significant predictor of PPD. This is consistent with findings from other studies.35 A Japanese study by Miura et al. revealed that verbal and physical abuse during pregnancy was significantly associated with PPD even after adjusting for potential confounders (OR=7.05, 95% CI, 2.23-10.55).35 The findings from Muira and colleagues are important for this present study because similar questions and responses were used in determining the occurrence of physical abuse. These similar results established the co-existence of physical and verbal abuse from intimate partners. Thus, establishing the history of exposure to physical violence and verbal abuse serves as an important measure in determining association. In a study conducted in Ohio, Das et al. concluded that a documented history of exposure to depression during pregnancy is significant in identifying mothers who are at higher risk of anxiety and stress. Furthermore, stressful life events determined by using the Life Events Questionnaire (LEQ) to measure the degree of life stress have been found to be significantly associated with the prevalence of PPD.27 Thus, these factors should be screened in combination with depression.36\n\nLimitations\n\nOur study has limitations. First, the outcome of interest, PPD, lacks an official medical diagnosis and is dependent on participant responses to survey data. While screening questions mimic validated clinical screening tools,37 they may not always correctly classify the actual condition of PPD. Second, an important demographic factor for which this data set differs from the overall Utah population is race and ethnicity. The dataset contains the following racial breakdown: 72.7 percent White, 6.9 percent non-White, non-Hispanic, and 20.3 percent Hispanic (higher than the national average). Thus, findings from this study will be generalizable for White and, to some extent, Hispanic women but no other minority groups prevalent in Utah.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt may be of value to explore the relative impact of specific factors associated with adverse outcomes, as this data may help inform decisions about use of finite resources in mitigating and preventing harm. Our study found that exposure to abuse before and during pregnancy, in addition to partner-related stress, were significant predictors of PPD. Further examination may be warranted to explore the interplay between partner-related physical abuse, life stressors, and perceived stress on risk of PPD, as women may suffer similar negative life events but appraise the impact or severity differently.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nData were provided by the Utah Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, a project of the Utah Department of Health (UDOH), the Office of Vital Records and Health Statistics of the UDOH, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States Department of Health and Human Services.
