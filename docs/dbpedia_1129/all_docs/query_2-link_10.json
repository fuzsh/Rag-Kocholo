        "text": "Fernando Musa leads something of a double life. He is co-founder and chairman of the ad network David, which was “born from the legacy of David Ogilvy, the pioneer of modern advertising” and has six offices across the US, South America and Europe. But he is also CEO at Ogilvy Brazil. This seems like a lot of jobs for one man to manage, but he wears the situation surprisingly lightly.\n\n“I love it,” he says of having both jobs. “People keep asking me why I do it but I love it. Seeing and living both sides gives me more cards to play and makes me smarter to understand different points of view…. This is a tool that gives me more references to play better, simple as that.”\n\nAnd he seems able to juggle both while also having a personal life. “I still have time for my kids, otherwise it won’t work,” he continues. “Because it’s about people and if you don’t have the whole experience of being a person, you cannot do good work. So you have to have time to play.”\n\nIf you’re left feeling a bit lazy reading about this, you’re not alone. Yet there is a logic to Musa’s point about the different perspectives that his two jobs bring. While both David and Ogilvy Brazil are part of the WPP network, they have distinctly different styles.\n\nSign in\n\nMore from CR\n\nWhat can brands learn from Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign?\n\nCR speaks to Teemu Suviala, global chief creative officer at Landor, about how Harris is cutting through the political noise, and what lessons brands can take from her bold approach\n\nVisceral campaign calls out anti-homeless spikes\n\nTBWA\\MCR has created simple yet potent posters that expose hostile architectural design features in our towns and cities\n\nThe hidden carbon costs of making an ad\n\nWe might reassure ourselves that there are for worse industries for the planet than advertising, but that’s before you break down all the steps involved.
