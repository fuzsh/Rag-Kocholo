        "text": "The 1970s was arguably the single decade of the 20th century when recorded music was most central to culture. There were, of course, fewer kinds of media competing for the average consumer’s time—television meant just a handful of channels, video games were the size of refrigerators and could be found in arcades. As the used vinyl bins of the world are still telling us, records were the thing. Labels were flush with cash, sales of LPs and singles were brisk, and record stores were everywhere. Home stereos were a standard part of middle-class culture. Analog recording technology was at its zenith, FM radio was ascendant, and the AM dial still focused on music. The children of the baby boom were coming into their late twenties and thirties—young enough to still be serious music consumers, but old enough to have their own generation of children who were starting to buy music.\n\nAnd then there was the music itself. Disco, an entire cultural movement fueled by a genre of music—with massive impact on fashion, film, TV and advertising—was utterly ubiquitous. Rock music emerged from the ’60s as to go-to choice of white youth culture. Soul and funk were reaching new levels of artistry. Punk, the first serious backlash against the rock mainstream, came into its own. Records from Jamaica were making their way to the UK and, eventually, the U.S., changing sounds and urging a new kind of political consciousness. As culture moved in every direction at once, there were more great songs than anyone could count.\n\nAs voted by our full time staff and contributors, these are Pitchfork's 200 best songs of the 1970s.\n\nListen to the best songs of the 1970s on Apple Music and Spotify.\n\n200.\n\nMarianne Faithfull: “Broken English” (1979)\n\nThere’s no shame in being a muse—preening in silk robes on the couch, tousled hair parting to reveal full lips pouting around a cigarette, tossing off bon mots of aching elegance that nestle into the subconscious and reappear as pop hits. If that’s how Mick Jagger wanted to spend his days, more power to him. Marianne Faithfull was most famous in the ’60s as the blonde, boho moll of the Rolling Stones frontman, whose career was twined to his and widely assumed dependent on his gifts: her version of the Stones’ “As Tears Go By” was a hit in England; her near-fatal heroin overdose became “Wild Horses,” and her literary interests begat “Sympathy for the Devil;” she co-wrote “Sister Morphine.” But Jagger was also something of Faithfull’s muse, inspiring many entries in her prodigious Decca Records output of the late 1960s.\n\nBy the end of the 1970s, a decade in which she’d weathered drug abuse and homelessness (and long ended her high-profile love), Faithfull refused to be diminished for one more day. Broken English, her first rock record in 12 years, was the comeback triumph no one expected, not least in how gritty it was. The chilling title track is a prophetic merging of punk and dance, with lyrics that plumb the depths of her losses. “Could have come through anytime/Cold lonely, puritan,” she intones harshly, gliding into a bloodless snarl that would make Johnny Rotten flinch. “What are you fighting for?/It’s not my security.” It’s a terse, battle-scarred declaration of autonomy with hairpin melodic turns, early in its embrace of dance music’s dark possibilities. “Broken English” is the portrait of a true survivor, starting a new era on her terms, alone. –Stacey Anderson\n\nListen: Marianne Faithfull: “Broken English”\n\nSee also: Lene Lovich: “Lucky Number” / Amanda Lear: “Follow Me”\n\n199.\n\nPatrice Rushen: “Haven’t You Heard” (1979)\n\nEven as her sensibilities shifted from jazz to fusion to R&B and disco, Patrice Rushen focused on her keyboards while everything else swirled around them. On “Haven’t You Heard,” the piano is an anchor for the song. This can make it feel like an early skeleton of house music, which is appropriate—it was a touchstone of Larry Levan’s sets at the Paradise Garage, and was eventually reborn as gospel house in Kirk Franklin’s 2005 single “Looking for You.”\n\n“Haven’t You Heard” is a formally perfect expression of disco. The best disco songs imply infinity in both their length and groove, and always feel as if they’re attached to a black hole. “Haven’t You Heard” enhances time until it feels like the glitter of a cityscape unfurling through a cab window. It manages this even as the lyric itself is private—the literal text of a classified ad. “It only says ‘I’m looking for the perfect guy,’” Rushen sings, searching for connection not through direct communication but with ambient speech. This kind of intimacy, personified by the whispery translucence of Rushen’s voice, is just as easily exported to the dance floor. –Brad Nelson\n\nListen: Patrice Rushen: “Haven’t You Heard”\n\nSee also: Anita Ward: “Ring My Bell” / Herb Alpert: Rise”\n\n198.\n\nWaylon Jennings: “Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way” (1975)\n\nLike the best outlaw country, “Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way?” looks backwards and forwards simultaneously, finding inspiration in the past even as it wonders what’s around the next curve in the road. Jennings and his peers were traditionalists who bucked the very notion of tradition. All of them had been manhandled by the industry, but few bristled against the mainstream quite as strongly as Jennings, who found himself on a series of poorly planned tours that left him deep in debt to his label and addicted to amphetamines.\n\nIf this were just a song about all the “rhinestone suits and new shiny cars” that defined country music around the bicentennial, it would have been only a minor antagonism. But outlaw country rarely gets credit for its humor or its self-deprecation, and what lends the song its gravity, aside from the world-weariness of Waylon’s vocals, is his sly assessment of his own place in the industry. Despite the hits he’d been notching for a decade, he was still just another road warrior who idolized Hank Sr. but still saw him as an almost hilariously impossible standard against which to measure himself or anybody else. –Stephen Deusner\n\nListen: Waylon Jennings: “Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way?”\n\nSee also: Willie Nelson: “Whiskey River” / Jerry Reed: “Amos Moses”\n\n197.\n\nArt Ensemble of Chicago: “Théme de Yoyo” (1970)\n\nA healthy portion of Chicago’s musical avant-garde decamped for France in 1969, but the group that made the biggest splash in Paris was the Art Ensemble of Chicago. The band’s exuberant stage show reinforced its members’ organizing slogan—“Great Black Music: Ancient to the Future”—with bassist Malachi Favors often dressed like an Egyptian shaman and saxophonist Roscoe Mitchell donning the garb of a contemporary urbanite. Over the course of a dozen-plus records cut in the 1970s, the band’s sound made good on the malleability suggested by this varied public image, as they created delicate improvisations and noise blowouts alike.\n\nOn “Théme de Yoyo,” the opening song on a soundtrack to a now-forgotten film, the Art Ensemble’s rhythm section offers up a funk groove. When the group’s notoriously wild horn players enter, they begin by playing things pretty straight—only reaching for avant-garde theatrics in brief pauses of the swinging, mod theme. Guest vocalist Fontella Bass—the wife of Art Ensemble trumpeter Lester Bowie—contributes soulful phrasings that sound downright commercial until you focus on the absurdist lyrics (“Your fanny’s like two sperm whales floating down the Seine”). No matter how out there each instrumentalist ventures, every feature spot contains references to the track’s pop-song foundation. As a piece of free-jazz funk that predates Ornette Coleman’s Prime Time band, “Théme de Yoyo” is an early reflection of the benefits the Art Ensemble reaped from their refusal to be tied to a single genre. –Seth Colter Walls\n\nListen: Art Ensemble of Chicago: “Théme de Yoyo”\n\nSee also: Brigitte Fontaine, Areski Belkacem & Art Ensemble of Chicago: “Comme à la Radio” / Pharoah Sanders: “Love Is Everywhere”\n\n196.\n\nJorge Ben: “Taj Mahal” (1976)\n\nJorge Ben’s “Taj Mahal” is ostensibly about the famous tomb in Agra, India. The building was created by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, as a tribute to his fourth wife, Mumtaz Mahal, after her death during the birth of the couple’s 14th child. “Foi a mais linda historia de amor,” sings the Brazilian singer Ben: “It was the most pretty story of love.” The couple’s romance must have been strong stuff: the tomb was commissioned the year after her death, in 1632, and wasn't finished until 1653, at a cost of approximately $827 million in today’s dollars.\n\nBen’s original version of the song, recorded for his 1972 album Ben, is a subdued gem. But the version recorded for his massive 1976 crossover album Africa Brasil exudes joy, sparks flying from every exuberant note. The record would end up getting Rod Stewart—whose “Do Ya Think I’m Sexy?” bore a strong resemblance—sued. It’s not difficult, though, to see what Stewart saw in its jubilant DNA (unconsciously, according to his autobiography). “Taj Mahal” captures an unselfconscious excitement, a purity of a deeply familiar feeling, yet projects it at a scale that can cross decades—perhaps centuries. –David Drake\n\nListen: Jorge Ben: “Taj Mahal”\n\nSee also: Jorge Ben: “Ponta De Lanca Africano (Umbabarauma)” / Tim Maia: “No Caminho Do Bem”\n\n195.\n\nLee Perry & the Full Experiences\n\n“Disco Devil” (1977)\n\nThis track is really three ’70s reggae classics in one: Max Romeo’s “Chase the Devil,” Prince Jazzbo’s “Croaking Lizard,” and Lee Perry’s mix of both with his own vocals. All this and more gets tossed in the pot in the nearly seven-minute-long “Disco Devil.”\n\n“Disco” doesn’t reference the flashy dance genre of the same name but rather the concept of the “discomix,” a 12” vinyl format that contains a vocal song seamlessly followed by a dub remix or a deejay version (meaning a rapped performance over the rhythm track). Perry essentially released a dub version of the Romeo and Jazzbo tracks, then followed it with a dub of the dub. It’s a particularly effective example of Perry’s innovative, eccentric production style that transforms the studio into an instrument itself. The approach to “Disco Devil” demonstrates the many ways he was able to pull pieces of a song apart and put them back together, add snippets of lyrics and sounds, and shape deep bass and rippling guitar to glide as if underwater. –Erin Macleod\n\nListen: Lee Perry & the Full Experiences: “Disco Devil”\n\nSee also: Max Romeo: “Chase the Devil” / Augustus Pablo: “Kings Tubbys Meets Rockers Uptown”\n\n194.\n\nManu Dibango: “Soul Makossa” (1972)\n\nA decade before Michael Jackson lifted it for “Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’,” and long before Rihanna sampled Jackson’s version in “Don’t Stop the Music” (and both got sued for uncleared usage), “Soul Makossa” was a disco scene staple. It started as the B-side to a hymn Manu Dibango wrote for his native Cameroon’s football team in honor of their country hosting the 1972 Africa Cup of Nations. By then, the jazz saxophonist was already well established, but the record was a huge flop. In his autobiography, Dibango recalls how kids and adults alike ridiculed his stuttering repetition of that now-familiar refrain: “Ma-ma-ko ma-ma-sa mako-makossa!” It was only when he rerecorded it in Paris, and that version fell into the hands of New York Loft DJ David Mancuso and radio DJ Frankie Crocker, that it spread like wildfire, even cracking the American Top 40.\n\nHistorically, makossa, the popular Cameroonian dance music, is a mix of soukous, highlife, and traditional Douala dance rhythms. Dibango douses it in soul, funk, and jazz to the point that “Soul Makossa” is more funky proto-disco than it is makossa. But that reimagining is also what made the song such a phenomenon; it played to people’s ideas of what a cosmopolitan African continent sounded like, presented in a format they were familiar with. In the decades to come, “Soul Makossa” would be sampled countless times over, including by the Fugees on The Score and Kanye on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. “Soul Makossa” remains brilliant in its musical malleability. –Minna Zhou\n\nListen: Manu Dibango: Soul Makossa\n\nSee also: Chakachas: “Jungle Fever” / Lafayette Afro Rock Band: “Darkest Light”\n\n193.\n\nJames Chance & the Contortions: “Contort Yourself” (1979)\n\nThe no wave scene in late ’70s New York was notorious for its room-clearing nihilism. Noisy, confrontational bands such as Mars, DNA, and Teenage Jesus & the Jerks looked to bury the corpse of rock’n’roll by rejecting its rules. Yet one of the most iconic no wave tunes, James Chance & the Contortions’ “Contort Yourself,” is less an anti-song than a body-moving dance-craze ditty. “Now is time to lose all control/Distort your body, twist your soul,” Chance yelps over the tightly wound groove of his quintet, who sound like an unhinged version of James Brown’s band the J.B.’s.\n\nBut as “Contort Yourself” progresses, Chance’s destructive attitude creeps in. His screams get longer (“Forget about your future!”), his saxophone gets noisier, and slide guitars scrape across the song like rakes over concrete. By the end, Chance advocates total annihilation: “Once you forget your affection for the human race/Reduce yourself to zero, and then you’ll fall in place.”\n\nStill, “Contort Yourself” is nihilism you can dance to, and it typified the Contortions’ unique mix of punk, funk, and jazz. That mix would influence many danceable early ’80s New York bands—Bush Tetras, ESG, Liquid Liquid—and point toward the disco scene that eventually took over Manhattan. But no one could replicate the sharp mania of “Contort Yourself,” a song that still twists and shouts. –Marc Masters\n\nListen: James Chance & the Contortions: “Contort Yourself”\n\nSee also: A Certain Ratio: “Do the Du (Casse)” / Teenage Jesus & The Jerks: “Orphans”\n\n192.\n\nBrian Eno: “Baby’s on Fire” (1973)\n\n“Baby's on Fire” is barely a song, in the conventional sense—two chords mercilessly alternating for five minutes, a single snatch of melody repeated with almost no variation, a lyric that sidles around clear sense, and a guitar solo that takes up more than half of its running time. It divided the listeners of Eno’s first solo album, Here Come the Warm Jets, into those who got it and those who were left eating its ashes.\n\nFor all its minimalism, there's a lot going on in this song: a celebration of a catastrophe happening in plain view, knotty wordplay and snappy onomatopoeia, and the vicious camp of Eno’s vocal (there’s an arch, shivering grin behind the way he enunciates, “This kind of experience/Is necessary for her learning”). The track’s centerpiece is the conflagration of Robert Fripp and Paul Rudolph’s all-devouring instrumental break with Eno’s “treatments” spraying fuel all over it. Before “Baby’s on Fire” and Warm Jets, Eno had been the eccentric, glammy keyboardist in Roxy Music; after them, he became known as the ingenious weirdo who thought about sound in ways nobody else did. –Douglas Wolk\n\nListen: Brian Eno: “Baby's on Fire”\n\nSee also: Brian Eno: “Here Come the Warm Jets” / Brian Eno: “Third Uncle”\n\n191.\n\nTom Zé: “Doi” (1976)\n\nThe story goes that, sometime in the mid-’80s, David Byrne found Estudando o Samba (“Studying Samba”) in a record store in Rio De Janeiro. He assumed it would be like the rest of the samba records he was collecting, but its cover gave a hint of something subversive: the image of a barbed wire fence scrawled across a white surface. Of course, Byrne became so obsessed with the record, he tracked Zé down and asked if he could release the album in the States, as the first dispatch of his then-new Luaka Bop records. Soon after, Zé was enjoying overdue fame as samba’s best deconstructionist.\n\nZé grew up in the Hinterlands of Bahia, Brazil, in a village so remote that it didn’t get electricity until he was 17; soon after, he studied modernist composition and hooked up with the tropicalistas in urban Salvador. Zé’s music reflects both these worlds; it’s rooted in rural tradition and laced with a cynical cosmopolitanism. “Doi,” from 1976’s triumphant Estudando o Samba, strikes a perfect balance: its percussion forms from earthy, machinelike clanks, and a minimalist guitar is the only other actual instrument on the song. Its thrust comes from a chorus that feels universal, primordial even, and Zé allows himself to disappear into it. It’s a strange and satisfying effect, and a rigorously intelligent way to balance formal experimentation with heritage. “Doi” exists in some nether-zone between the past and the future, and nothing in music sounds like this, still. –Kevin Lozano\n\nListen: Tom Zé: “Doi”\n\nSee also: Tom Zé: “Um Oh! E Um Ah!” / Secos & Molhados: “Sangue Latino”\n\n190.\n\nBetty Davis: “He Was a Big Freak” (1974)\n\nBetty Davis’ voice is where pleasure meets pain, so of course she had to cut a song about S&M. People speculated whether “He Was a Big Freak” concerned her ex-husband, Miles Davis, or her rumored (and denied) lover, Jimi Hendrix. It wasn’t about either, Davis said, though she admitted that her dominatrix’s “turquoise chain” was a reference to Hendrix’s favorite color. Gossip aside, Davis’ act was scandalizing because it starred a powerful young black woman in control of her own desires.\n\nOn “Freak,” she takes on various roles in order to meet her partner’s needs—housewife, geisha, mother—but sounds so intoxicated by her power that his satisfaction becomes secondary. Her delivery evokes a woman possessed as she roars and vamps through her seduction. Davis keeps switching gears until a new darkness emerges from her throat, and a storm rises from the guitar. Her pointillist funk thrust loses its precision and starts stumbling in the perilous ascent towards climax. Eventually, “Freak” fades out, though Davis is still roaring as the mix dims. It feels like she’s just getting started. –Laura Snapes\n\nListen: Betty Davis: “He Was a Big Freak”\n\nSee also: Betty Davis: “Anti-Love Song” / Millie Jackson:“ If Loving You Is Wrong (I Don't Wanna Be Right)”\n\n189.\n\nIdris Muhammad: “Could Heaven Ever Be Like This” (1977)\n\nBorn Leo Morris, drummer Idris Muhammad played with dozens of jazz giants before and after taking his Muslim name, but found his artistic voice at Kudu, CTI’s soul crossover label, where he collaborated with David Matthews, a keyboardist who arranged and co-wrote several James Brown hits. You don’t have to have a degree in composition like Matthews did to wrap your head around the melodic composure of “Could Heaven Ever Be Like This,” their peak achievement together and Muhammad’s biggest hit. Singular, spiritual, and straight-up gorgeous, “Heaven” silences even the staunchest disco-hater.\n\nElements of the song have been repeatedly sampled and replayed, but its bittersweet harmonies are best experienced the way DJs played it back in the spring of 1977 and for many years to come: from its first effusive note to its very end. Over the course of eight-and-a-half minutes, “Heaven” takes dancers on an exquisite journey, the arrangement soaring from ethereal harp to Brecker Brothers horn blasts to raucous rock guitar. Too otherworldly to be championed by every DJ, “Heaven” was nevertheless so beloved by those who did that it reached No. 2 on Billboard’s dance chart. The only subsequent record to truly do it justice, Jamie xx’s “Loud Places” honors that it’s not simply a dance song, but also a prayer. –Barry Walters\n\nListen: Idris Muhammad: “Could Heaven Ever Be Like This”\n\nSee also: Candido: “Thousand Finger Man” / Kiki Gyan: “Disco Dancer”\n\n188.\n\nJunior Murvin: “Police & Thieves” (1976)\n\nFalsetto is frequently used in reggae, but not often is there a track as gently piercing as Junior Murvin’s 1976 classic. As resonant now as it was then, Murvin’s song about the militarization of police reflects reality far beyond Jamaica, leveling the playing field between the illegal and the legal. “All the peacemakers turn war officers,” sings a prescient Murvin. “Police and thieves in the streets, oh yeah/Scaring the nation with their guns and ammunition.” It was an important soundtrack of protest when it was released in London in the summer of 1976, during racial tensions that led to riots during the Notting Hill Festival and unrest in Brixton.\n\nThe track has been re-recorded a number of times, most famously by the Clash on their debut album. However, the original, recorded in the legendary Black Ark studio, is a textbook Lee Perry production. There’s that perfect amount of echo, carrying Murvin’s vocal improvisations and the humming chorus along, making them bounce off the walls and charge ever forward. –Erin Macleod\n\nListen: Junior Murvin: “Police & Thieves”\n\nSee also: Junior Murvin: “Cool Out Son” / Horace Andy: “Skylarking”\n\n187.\n\nCerrone: “Supernature” (1977)\n\nOn his previous Eurodisco hits, the French drummer Marc Cerrone mirrored Giorgio Moroder’s long, sensual suites with Donna Summer while accentuating both their symphonic splendor and kickdrum wallops. For the title track of his second 1977 album, he took a page from Summer’s “I Feel Love” and similarly traded soaring strings for undulating synths, but did so without the overt sex. Instead, he and cowriter Alain Winsniak introduced an unprecedented strain of dystopian disco dread. Neither Kraftwerk nor Berlin-era Bowie had an immediate international dancefloor impact as profound as “Supernature.”\n\nYears before GMOs became a food source and organic crops a common alternative, “Supernature” sang of an imagined past when science introduced agricultural breakthroughs with unanticipated consequences. “The potions that we made touched the creatures down below/And they grew up in a way that we’d never seen before,” warns English session vocalist Kay Garner with a star-quality growl oozing menace and authority. As the track grows more sinister, mutant monsters take their revenge until humanity reverts to a primitive state where it must once again earn its place.\n\nHow did such a deep sci-fi theme find its way into an album that sold huge numbers and paved the way for space disco, techno, acid house, and other dark dance floor strains? The future new wave icon Lene Lovich wrote these uncredited ecological lyrics. She’d soon use her fame to raise consciousness for animal rights. –Barry Walters\n\nListen: Cerrone: “Supernature”\n\nSee also: Space: “Carry On, Turn Me On” / Gino Soccio: “Dancer”\n\n186.\n\nThe Whispers: “And the Beat Goes On” (1979)\n\nThe Whispers formed in Los Angeles in the mid-’60s and were hardly seen as cutting-edge by the time they released “And the Beat Goes On” in 1979. But they were in fact pushing boundaries, thanks in large part to the genius of SOLAR label producer Leon Sylvers, who, along with record producer Kashif, was one of the most important composers in late-’70s/early-’80s R&B. Together, on opposite sides of the country—Kashif in New York, Sylvers in Los Angeles—the two charted a path post-disco, incorporating new electronic elements and playing with grooves.\n\n“And the Beat Goes On” was one of Sylvers’ most successful records as a producer, hitting No. 19 on the Hot 100. The groove was so modern, it was the product of a Will Smith one-track-jack in the late ’90s, when the rapper’s “Miami” lifted liberally from the post-disco classic; the record had aged well, its quick strings and electronic textures as fresh as they day they were recorded. –David Drake\n\nListen: The Whispers: “And the Beat Goes On”\n\nSee also: Detroit Emeralds: “Feel the Need in Me” / Leon Haywood: “I Want' A Do Something Freaky To You”\n\n185.\n\nThelma Houston: “Don’t Leave Me This Way” (1976)\n\n“Don’t Leave Me This Way” first took shape in 1975 in a more modest arrangement, as a Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes song sung by Teddy Pendergrass. Pendergrass’s tender vocals keep the songs as two distinct components—a verse and a chorus separated neatly by scale and intensity. When Thelma Houston recorded the song for Motown a year later, her arrangement reached for the sky; the version accelerates steadily, a gentle melancholy lifting off into the denser and more pressurized atmosphere of disco. Throughout, Rhodes piano shimmers like light filtering through clouds.\n\nHouston’s performance is remarkable: her vocals are as composed as they are exposed, stable as they are sensitive. “I can’t survive,” Houston sings, her voice occasionally collapsing into a whisper. “I can’t stay alive/Without your love.” It’s this complexity that, years later, led the song to be embraced as a metaphor for the devastation of AIDS in the gay community. –Brad Nelson\n\nListen: Thelma Houston: “Don’t Leave Me This Way”\n\nSee also: Harold Melvin & The Bluenotes: “Don't Leave Me This Way” / Evelyn \"Champagne\" King: “Shame”\n\n184.\n\nThe Spinners: “Could It Be I’m Falling in Love” (1972)\n\nIt’s ironic that one of the all-time greatest Philly soul acts weren’t even from Philadelphia. The Spinners hailed from Detroit—they were even billed as “the Detroit Spinners” in the UK—and like most of the city’s top talent at the time, they recorded on Motown, where they landed the Stevie Wonder-penned hit “It’s a Shame.” But it was only after signing to Atlantic Records that they truly found their voice. Under the guidance of super-producer Thom Bell, they embodied the sound of ’70s Philadelphia soul: lush, sensual, and ridiculously generous, all strings and bells and orchestral grandeur.\n\nThat’s a lot to juggle, and some of Bell’s lesser productions collapsed under the weight of their arrangements, especially once disco pressured them to become busier and busier, but the Spinners had the delicate touch to pull it all off. Just years earlier, they’d been shouting and wailing, but the best moments of “Could It Be I’m Falling in Love” are practically whispered; every time lead vocalist Bobbie Smith is offered the opportunity to go loud, he goes soft, letting Bell’s dulcet accompaniments do the singing for him. The restraint adds even more depth to his coos of, “I don't need all those things that used to bring me joy/You've made me such a happy boy.” The ’70s yielded countless songs about falling in love, but few are as blissful as this. –Evan Rytlewski\n\nListen: The Spinners: “Could It Be I’m Falling in Love”\n\nSee also: Spinners: “I'll Be Around” / Isley Brothers: “(At Your Best) You Are Love”\n\n183.\n\nTodd Rundgren: “International Feel” (1973)\n\nNot many can challenge Todd Rundgren as the foremost architect of ’70s rock. As a producer, he shaped defining albums for Grand Funk Railroad, Hall & Oates, and Meat Loaf...but also the New York Dolls, Patti Smith, and the Tubes. In his simultaneous solo career, he stayed one step ahead of the trends he solidified with other artists, veering between soft-rock rebellion, prog fantasias, and experiments in song suites and remakes.\n\nTriangulating Rundgren’s busy decade is nearly impossible, but “International Feel”—the lead track from his frenetic A Wizard, A True Star—does a fine job. Recorded at the ad-hoc Secret Sound studio Rundgren built in a New York City loft, the song balances between his audiophile obsessions and pop instincts. It’s Philly soul in a spacesuit, fading in with revving engine sound effects, tickled from all sides by synthesizer sprites, propelled by heavily filtered drums that sound lifted from a Led Zeppelin IV session. The use of “International Feel” in Daft Punk’s 2006 film Electroma only confirmed its otherworldly futurism, and that Rundgren was ahead of his time even as he played a preeminent role in defining it. –Rob Mitchum\n\nListen: Todd Rundgren: “International Feel”\n\nSee also: The Move: “Feel Too Good” / Dennis Wilson: “Pacific Ocean Blues”\n\n182.\n\nDelta 5: “Mind Your Own Business” (1979)\n\nWhen guitarist Julz Sale, bassist Ros Allen, and other bassist Bethan Peters came together to form Delta 5 in 1979, they decided to double up on the low end because, as Allen has said, “neither of us played guitar, and we thought it would make the music more exciting.” They were not wrong.\n\nPart of a contingent of Leeds art instigators that included Mekons and Gang of Four, the socialist funk-punk pioneers released their iconic debut single on Rough Trade just as the ’70s were petering out. The song opens with a tense soda-counter come-on that bleeds feminist sarcasm: “Can I have a taste of your ice cream?” the three women deadpan in unison. “Can I lick the crumbs from your table? Can I interfere in your crisis?” They gnarl knots of guitar noise until the whole song sounds like a collective effort to suffocate those same questions, but only after telling the leader of the pack to fuck right off: “No, mind your own business!” This one genius idea on loop set Delta 5 on their way. –Jenn Pelly\n\nListen: Delta 5: “Mind Your Own Business”\n\nSee also: Mekons: “Where Were You” / Slits: “I Heard It Through the Grapevine”\n\n181.\n\nVan Morrison: “Caravan” (1970)\n\n“Caravan” fits into an established tradition of songs about listening, a metatextual lyric about gathering with friends and dancing to a song on the radio, made into a song one might gather with friends and dance to. When it appears on a classic rock radio playlist, the lyric becomes abruptly instructional. “Turn it up!” Van exhorts. “Little bit higher! Radio!” Syntax crumbles in the whirl and flutter of his emotions. “Caravan” has a kind of rhomboid structure, its energies constantly building toward an acute angle; the individual instruments in the song—including Van Morrison’s voice—combine and swell into a wordless chorus: “La la la la la la la.” This is, essentially, the vocabulary of rhythm and blues, which Morrison, on “Caravan”’s album Moondance, had finally, almost seamlessly absorbed into his own music, and of which “Caravan” is its most excited expression. –Brad Nelson\n\nListen: Van Morrison: “Caravan”\n\nSee also: Van Morrison: “Into the Mystic” / Randy Newman: “Sail Away”\n\n180.\n\nThe Damned: “Neat Neat Neat” (1977)\n\nStiff Records hustled to ensure the Damned were the first British punk band to get a single to market, issuing “New Rose” just weeks prior to the Sex Pistols’ “Anarchy in the UK.” The full-length Damned Damned Damned was also rushed out, anchored by “Neat Neat Neat,” the nastiest single of the first wave of UK punk. It opens with a bass line so slippery, it’s almost sexy, but once the band kicks in—no more than five seconds later, because in the early days, the Damned never weren’t in a hurry—the recording descends into chaos, growing faster and filthier with every chord change.\n\nWords don’t matter so much here—images of violence and desperate dominance bat up against each other, creating a vague menace. But “Neat Neat Neat” isn’t just a performance, as Elvis Costello & the Attractions made clear; their 1978 live revision of the song swapped the abandon for funk, turning “Neat Neat Neat” into tense, profane jazz-rock worthy of Ian Dury and revealing the sharp, cynical song underneath the Damned’s bluster. Still, “Neat Neat Neat” is really about that visceral, ugly rush, a record that hits harder than any other early punk single. The Sex Pistols plodded, the Clash marshaled their forces, but the Damned attacked indiscriminately, wanting to take down everybody in their eyesight. –Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nListen: The Damned: “Neat Neat Neat”\n\nSee also: Damned: “New Rose” / Wipers: “Better Off Dead”\n\n179.\n\nThe Germs: “Lexicon Devil” (1978)\n\nTo watch the Germs perform in the seminal 1981 punk documentary The Decline of Western Civilization is to witness a band living on borrowed time, abused while onstage by an adoring audience, a lurching Darby Crash slurring his vocals beyond incoherence. Inconsistent of lineup and unerringly high, their salvation laid in the sheer quality of their songwriting: catchy yet erudite, desperate yet empathetic, a conduit for connection.\n\nAt surface level, “Lexicon Devil” is pogo-stick punk bubblegum, a startling burst of left-coast Ramones with all those chummy, hammy “gimmies” that Crash chants. He refuses to fully succumb to punk’s cynicism and anarchism; instead, he dares to openly daydream about dismantling a jaundiced today and building a better tomorrow, welcoming along anyone who can pitch in. “Together we’ll run to the highest prop,” he cries. “Tear it down and let it drop!” It’s a romantic, substantial notion, one that remains well worth striving for. –Raymond Cummings\n\nListen: The Germs: “Lexicon Devil”\n\nSee also: Misfits: “Bullet” / Dead Kennedys: “California Uber Alles”\n\n178.\n\nSiouxsie and the Banshees: “Hong Kong Garden” (1978)\n\nWhen Siouxsie and the Banshees released their debut single in 1978, goth was still years away from becoming a subculture and the first wave of post-punk acts were just finding their sounds. The band had been kicking around London for quite a while before that—Siouxsie had been a teenage punk scenester in the Sex Pistols’ orbit, and the Banshees played a disastrous first set at Malcolm McLaren’s historic 100 Club Punk Festival in the fall of 1976. But, as Jon Savage explains in England’s Dreaming, punk was in a dark place two years later. Nazi imagery adopted purely for the sake of provocation, like the swastika armbands Siouxsie often wore, was now attracting real white supremacists.\n\n“Hong Kong Garden,” with its chiming electric xylophone-and-drum intro and jagged guitar riff, represented the evolution of a punk aesthetic that had become so stripped down, it was starting to feel reactionary. The song’s pseudo-Asian aesthetic hasn’t aged perfectly, but it did have an explicitly anti-racist message. Its culture-clash lyrics were inspired by the scene at a Chinese takeout in Siouxsie’s suburban hometown of Chislehurst. “I used to go along with my friend and just be really upset by the local skinheads that hung out there and gave the staff such a hard time—really racist, just intolerant,” she told Uncut. Listeners must have been hungry for that message, because “Hong Kong Garden” landed the Banshees their Polydor deal and became a surprise hit, reaching No. 7 on the UK pop charts. –Judy Berman\n\nListen: Siouxsie and the Banshees: “Hong Kong Garden”\n\nSee also: Patti Smith: “Because the Night” / Magazine: “The Light Pours Out of Me”\n\n177.\n\nFaust: “It’s a Rainy Day, Sunshine Girl” (1972)\n\nIf Faust’s eponymous 1971 debut demonstrated a facility for fusing rock, classical, and spindly pop, “It’s a Rainy Day, Sunshine Girl” proved that the German group was capable of mainstreaming its youthful id. “Girl” thrives on crisp drumbeats, droning organs, and a scraping chug of guitars. Sung in English, the title registers as an almost mystic incantation that rises and falls with the mix. The result is a delicious contradiction: the act of repetition engendering hypnotic psychedelia, precision and looseness seeming downright interchangeable. Krautrock would inspire generations to rewrite the pulse of music, but “Rainy Day” found the members of Faust at their most streamlined, intuitive, and accessible; even today, its bedheaded bounce feels new. –Raymond Cummings\n\nListen: Faust: “It’s a Rainy Day, Sunshine Girl”\n\nSee also: The Fall: “It's a New Thing” / Amon Düül II - “Rattlesnakeplumcake”\n\n176.\n\nLoretta Lynn: “The Pill” (1975)\n\nIn 1975, Time magazine named “American Women” their Person of the Year, recognizing 12 months when “the women’s drive penetrated every layer of society, matured beyond an ideology to a new status of general—and sometimes unconscious—acceptance.” The feminist movement had helped force through anti-discrimination laws, which gave women a new foothold in the workplace. For the first time ever, American households were shrinking and marriage rates were declining; a few years earlier, oral contraception had been legalized for all women, not just married ones, and Roe v. Wade followed.\n\nThe last person you’d expect to soundtrack these advances was a 43-year-old country singer who skewed Republican more often than not. Loretta Lynn took a dim view of the women’s liberation movement, preferring to appeal to her female fans about their lives rather than their rights. Whatever she thought, this was a staunchly feminist tactic, as was choosing to record “The Pill,” a pro-birth control track that chimed directly with her own experiences: married at 15, with six kids in total, three of them born before she turned 19.\n\nPastors, particularly in the South, were quick to denounce the song, and it was blacklisted from dozens of country radio stations. But, as with most proscribed art, the controversy only amplified its popularity. It’s an easy sell, anyway: “The Pill” is funny (“This old maternity dress I’ve got is going in the garbage/The clothes I’m wearing from now on won’t take up so much yardage”), burbling along on blithe pedal steel, but its strength derives from its lack of showiness. Rather than laying on the sass, Lynn delivers a straight-talking PSA to women about the liberation that choice brings, and a cool warning to men about their wives’ newfound bargaining power. With every reminder that she’s “got the pill,” she reclaims ground from the patriarchy, jimmying the door open for women to make their way into the world and enjoy carefree sex, just like a man. Lynn’s radical treatise didn’t just enshrine prevention but pleasure, too. –Laura Snapes\n\nListen: Loretta Lynn: “The Pill”\n\nSee also: Loretta Lynn: “Rated X” / Loretta Lynn: “Coal Miner's Daughter”\n\n175.\n\nGiorgio Moroder: “Chase” (1978)\n\nAny time someone describes a piece of music as “cinematic,” there’s a decent chance they’re thinking, consciously or subconsciously, of “Chase.” Giorgio Moroder’s Oscar-winning score to Midnight Express holds up far better than the film and its now-decried “evil Turks” overtones; remarkably, this was his first soundtrack work and, to the public imagination, the foundational electronic soundtrack. (Technically, Tangerine Dream got there first, but there’s a reason they’re in a parenthetical.)\n\nUsing the strict synths of “I Feel Love” to generate the mechanical pulse of the action movie, to depict life as heightened and dreamlike and deeper than human, is an obvious idea now, but at the time, it was revelatory. It’s impossible to overstate, let alone list, the amount of composers and films who’ve ripped off “Chase”—it’s responsible for a lot of deeply uncool ’80s kitsch (much produced by Moroder himself) but also for a lot of undeniably transcendent moments. Moroder says he’d already gotten sick of it after two years; the next few decades must have been a special but not-so-secretly gratifying hell. –Katherine St. Asaph\n\nListen: Giorgio Morodor: “Chase”\n\nSee also: Giorgio Moroder: “(Theme From) Midnight Express” / Sparks: “No. 1 Song In Heaven”\n\n174.\n\nDillinger: “Cokane in My Brain” (1976)\n\nThe earliest known instance of the phrase “a knife, a fork, a bottle, and a cork, that’s the way we spell New York” (or something close to it) comes from a 1915 newspaper explaining the recent popularity of nonsense phrases that rhyme with major American cities. (It unfortunately doesn’t explain why they were popular.) The line had long since faded from the collective consciousness when reggae singer Dillinger stepped into Channel One studio in Kingston, Jamaica with producer Joseph “Jo Jo” Hoo Kim—but somehow, in his attempt to vocalize the sensation of a racing and coked-up mind, he managed to pluck those words out of the air. “Cokane in My Brain” was pressed and sent out into a new world that had no idea what the fuck he was talking about, but liked it anyhow.\n\nOld-timey American word games weren’t the only source material Dillinger and Kim raided on the track; the insistent beat was a loop lifted from Philly funk group the People’s Choice’s hit “Do It Any Way You Wanna” (played by the studio’s house band the Revolutionaries), and the chorus was borrowed from Reverend Gary Davis’s “Cocaine Blues.” The postmodern pastiche of “Cokane”—not to mention its wired freak-funk energy—would be a major influence on dance music and hip-hop in the coming decades, so it’s fitting that acts like the ’80s avant-electronic group Information Society and modern-day disco revivalists Escort have repurposed Dillinger’s cryptic secondhand jibberish in their own jams. –Miles Raymer\n\nListen: Dillinger: “Cokane in My Brain”\n\nSee also: Linval Thompson: “I Love Marijuana” / Dennis Brown: “The Man Next Door”\n\n173.\n\nEddie Kendricks: “Girl, You Need a Change of Mind” (1972)\n\nIn the ’60s, Eddie Kendricks’ falsetto added a plushness and sensitivity to several classic Temptations singles. In the early ’70s, alienated by the new psychedelic digressions of his group, he split and signed as a solo artist to the Motown imprint Tamla. “Girl, You Need a Change of Mind,” from his second solo album, 1972’s People...Hold On, is decidedly unpsychedelic, but there’s something hallucinatory produced by its groove, a spectral presence at its edges. The insistent shudder of the piano, bass, and drums form a kind of stirring rhythmic fog, the horns piercing through. It’s almost a work of impressionism.\n\nLyrically, the song is a straight male fantasy of how love and relationships work; Kendricks considers love a kind of formlessness in which the power discrepancies between men and women disintegrate. “Love, it is an occupation,” he sings, “a true liberation.” His resolve fractures with the shifting tempos and topologies of the seven-and-a-half minute song; at one point, the arrangement is reduced to only conga drums and his falsetto, which is first isolated and then multiplies in shivering fractions. Because of its length and its emphasis on digression, “Girl, You Need a Change of Mind” quickly became a standard in gay clubs, even as the aesthetics of disco were still forming. –Brad Nelson\n\nListen: Eddie Kendricks: “Girl, You Need a Change of Mind”\n\nSee also: Eddie Kendricks: “Keep On Truckin'” / Dramatics: “Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get”\n\n172.\n\nThe Equals: “Black Skin Blue Eyed Boys” (1970)\n\n“Okay, I’m loosened up now, children!” shouts Derv Gordon, lead singer of the Equals, at the start of the band’s 1970 single “Black Skin Blue Eyed Boys.” It’s not an empty exclamation. Up to that point, the British band had specialized in stomping, happy, bubblegum rock; their preceding single was about taking a bath (1969’s “Rub a Dub Dub”). However, there’s nothing squeaky clean about “Black Skin Blue Eyed Boys:” Whiplash funk, revolutionary grit, and very loosened-up anger coalesce into a bolt of righteousness.\n\nBefore “Black Skin Blue Eyed Boys,” the Equals—a group made up of white native Britons and black Caribbean immigrants—had relied on their name alone to make a statement about racial unity. Now they were making their point far more explicitly; the song calls for widespread interracial coupling as the path to glory and utopia. Sadly, the Equals’ sudden transformation didn’t last long: guitarist, songwriter, and bandleader Eddy Grant fell ill around the time of the single’s release, forcing him to leave the band. (He’d resurface in the ’80s with his solo hit “Electric Avenue”). But for one brief, shining moment in 1970, the Equals were the most potent, relevant band in the world. –Jason Heller\n\nListen: The Equals: “Black Skin Blue Eyed Boys”\n\nSee also: Cymande: “Bra” / Segun Bucknor & His Revolution: “La La La”\n\n171.\n\nThe Walker Brothers: “The Electrician” (1978)\n\nThe death-rattle guitar twang and the searing tone clusters that open “The Electrician” make for an almost-comically ominous set piece—coming, as it did, from a reunited ’60s boy band who, only a year earlier, had tried to chart with a Boz Scaggs cover.\n\nWith their label about to fold—and after a good half-decade of mercenary cover albums recorded to foot rent and bar tabs—lead singer Scott Walker had finally embraced the opportunity to make something of their studio time. Among the four original songs Scott wrote for the Walker Brothers’ final 1978 album Nite Flights, “The Electrician” was the most unprecedented, hinting at the hermetic, committedly avant-garde Walker of today. Like much of his brutalist Bush-era nightmare The Drift, “The Electrician” is a conversation of mangled sentences, circumscribing obscure scenes of pain and despair.\n\nSome perceived BDSM dynamics in its lyrics, and while Walker mentioned “lovers” in one ’80s interview, he also alluded to U.S. operations in Chile related to the Pinochet regime. The narrator feels the lash, and then stares bleary-eyed into a divine floodlight of lush, cruelly beautiful strings. The curlicued refrain—one of the most indelible Walker ever wrote—pleads, “kill me.” Brian Eno and David Bowie would offer to produce Walker’s next record after hearing Nite Flights. Eno later called “The Electrician” a future vision for music, one no one ever managed to follow up. –Winston Cook-Wilson\n\nListen: The Walker Brothers: “The Electrician”\n\nSee also: Lee Hazlewood: “The Night Before” / Captain Beefheart: “Her Eyes Are a Blue Million Miles”\n\n170.\n\nThe Roches: “Hammond Song” (1979)\n\nThis is one of those songs: Meteoric, out of the blue. Even in the context of upmarket ’70s folk—Linda Ronstadt, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Phoebe Snow—the Roche sisters were anomalies: Too funny, too weird, too insular to face the camera, or at least to connect with it. “Hammond Song,” the second track on their first album, has more in common with children’s music and the unearthly 16th-century chorales of Palestrina than anything happening around New York in 1979; it’s music of clarity and distance, so out of step with its surroundings that it becomes alien.\n\nTo dissect their harmonies (occasional, forceful, unprecedented) would only insult them. To dissect their lyrics (perfect, vernacular, the words of a plainspoken friend who always says the right thing) would cloud their wisdom. “They say we meet again/On down the line,” Suzzy Roche sings over an acoustic guitar and the simple click of what sounds like glass on glass. “Where is ‘on down the line’?/How far away?” You only hope that when questions this hard come for you, they’re in a language easier to avoid. –Mike Powell\n\nListen: The Roches: “Hammond Song”\n\nSee also: Sibylle Baier: “Tonight” / Michael Hurley: “Werewolf”\n\n169.\n\nPlastic Bertrand: “Ça Plane Pour Moi” (1977)\n\nIt’s not entirely inappropriate that one of the great early punk songs was created as a trend-hopping cash-in, or that very little is certain about the circumstances of its origin. The Belgian songwriter Yvan Lacomblez seems to have come up with the souped-up Chuck Berry blues, rapid-fire absurdist lyrics (mostly in Belgian French slang with a little English thrown in), and wordless swoon of a hook. Producer Lou Deprijck apparently sang “Ça Plane Pour Moi,” though the credited artist, Plastic Bertrand, claimed for years that it really was his own performance.\n\nTo confuse things a bit more, an English-language version (“Jet Boy Jet Girl”) with the same backing track and vastly less charming lyrics was credited to Elton Motello—a rock 'n' roll ripoff name, if ever there was one—and appears to have been released first. Motello, aka Alan Ward, had earlier played with guitarist Brian James of the Damned, whose bandmate Captain Sensible recorded a 1978 “Jet Boy Jet Girl” cover that ended up being gerrymandered onto the Damned's 1981 greatest-hits album. Despite all these efforts to reframe “Ça Plane Pour Moi,” it was the delirious Francophone version that became an international hit—even in the States, where it was arguably the first punk song to crack the Hot 100’s Top 50. –Douglas Wolk\n\nListen: Plastic Bertrand: “Ça Plane Pour Moi”\n\nSee also: Flying Lizards: “Money (That's What I Want)” / Buggles: “Video Killed the Radio Star”\n\n168.\n\nSun Ra: “Door of the Cosmos” (1979)\n\nLabeling Sun Ra as “progressive jazz” somehow sells his work short; he made cosmic jazz as perplexing as it was vast. His sounds were as confounding as their purported origin: Ra claimed he was sent from Saturn to unite the people of Earth through his music, a bebop for the space age. But his real story is even more remarkable: He was a prodigious black musician and composer who received an academic scholarship to college in the 1930s, overcoming racism and crippling cryptorchidism to helm one of the great fusion jazz movements of the 20th century.\n\nWith his Intergalactic Myth Science Solar Arkestra, Ra released Sleeping Beauty in 1979, continuing the most prolific decade of his career—it was his sixth release that year alone. At its center was “Door of the Cosmos,” a nearly nine-minute, free-moving track that threatened to provide insight into Ra’s Afrofuturistic, post-racist universe. It’s hard to deny the transcendental properties in the spirited performance: Written and arranged by Ra, the track is a wonder, a shot of that prism of light he claims beamed him down from the stars and started his revolution all those years ago. It’s a maelstrom of sound—drums, bass, trumpet, and vibraphone—that whips up enough speed to power a rocket’s burst, anchored by animated sax playing from Marshall Allen, who now carries on Ra’s legacy as leader of the Arkestra. There’s enough thrust to make you reconsider the odds of interplanetary travel. –Sheldon Pearce\n\nListen: Sun Ra: “Door of the Cosmos”\n\nSee also: Sun Ra: “When There Is No Sun” / Sun Ra: “Space Is the Place”\n\n167.\n\nMilton Nascimento: “Tudo Que Você Podia Ser” (1972)\n\nAfter the 1964 coup that turned Brazil into a military dictatorship, the regime grew increasingly oppressive, suspending habeas corpus and censoring media and music alike. After Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil were arrested and exiled, the cultural climate in the early ’70s grew increasingly bleak, a time referred to as “vazio cultural” (cultural void) or “o sofoco” (the suffocation). Yet Milton Nascimento and the loose collective of players and poets who comprised Clube da Esquina made some of the most evocative music of the era; their 1972 Clube da Esquina double album holds up against anything from the Beatles or Beach Boys.\n\nTaking in rock, doo-wop, bossa nova, jazz and more, Nascimento’s most inspirational moment might be on the three stunning minutes of “Tudo Que Você Podia Ser” (“All You Could Be”). Reminding his audience that “you still think and it's better than nothing,” the carefully chosen words and soaring melody inspired many. It instilled perseverance in those slowly being crushed by the junta. –Andy Beta\n\nListen: Milton Nascimento: “Tudo Que Você Podia Ser”\n\nSee also: Milton Nascimento: “Cravo e Canela” / Chico Buarque: “Construção”\n\n166.\n\nKaren Dalton: “Something on Your Mind” (1971)\n\nIn Greenwich Village’s storied early-’60s folk scene, Karen Dalton was the one who got away. While her peers signed big money contracts and became international stars, she receded from the spotlight, moving to Colorado where she performed for friends in her cabin. Bob Dylan called her a favorite, and folk singer Fred Neil, in the liner notes of her 1971 album In My Own Time, wrote, “She sure can sing the shit out of the blues.” Her difficult personal life made a successful recording career even less likely—the Oklahoma native was married and divorced twice by the time she was 21, was a victim of domestic violence, and, up until her death in 1993, struggled with drug and alcohol addiction. Producer Harvey Brooks said that her life was a “mess” during the Woodstock sessions for In My Own Time, and a friend remembered that she was in the hospital around the time recording started.\n\n“Something on Your Mind,” a song written by Quicksilver Messenger Service’s Dino Valente, another Greenwich Village peer, was the highlight of that strong set. The song is addressed to someone who seems to have abandoned their dreams, wants to hide, and feels like they’ll never stop crying. There’s real weight in hearing Karen Dalton sing the words, “Didn’t you know, you can’t make it without ever even trying?” as she, in the final recording she’d release in her lifetime, implores you not to give up. Fred Neil was right: She could sing the shit out of the blues. But this time, she used her considerable powers to express empathy. –Evan Minsker\n\nListen: Karen Dalton: “Something on Your Mind”\n\nSee also: Vashti Bunyan: “Diamond Day” / Robbie Basho: “Blue Crystal Fire”\n\n165.\n\nDonnie & Joe Emerson: “Baby” (1979)\n\nThirty-eight years ago, Don Emerson Sr. bought a new tractor for his family farm that came equipped with an AM-FM radio. During the hours and hours of chore work, Don Sr.’s sons Don Jr. and Joe glommed onto a strange amalgamation of rock, soul, funk, and R&B through Smokey Robinson, Hall and Oates, Bruce Springsteen, and Kris Kristofferson. Don Sr. decided to build them a state of the art studio on an empty plot of land, and the result of a year's playing was Dreamin’ Wild, the only complete album the Emerson brothers would ever release. Contained in this record is “Baby,” a yearning, sexy, and discomfitingly perfect love song. When it was rediscovered and reissued in the 2000s, it made its way through blogs and was championed deservedly as a lost gem. –Kevin Lozano\n\nListen: Donnie & Joe Emerson: “Baby”\n\nSee also: Shuggie Otis: “Island Letter” / Delfonics: “Hey! Love”\n\n164.\n\nDon Cherry: “Brown Rice” (1975)\n\nWith an eight-note motif serving as the song’s anchor, trumpeter Don Cherry’s “Brown Rice” is a feat of experimentation. The song is somewhat ambiguous, neither happy nor sad nor angry, suggesting instead a tone of curiosity, a kind of intrigued tip-toe sporadically interrupted by bursts of woodwinds or brass. In the tension between the predictable and the unexpected lies the song's energy, locking in listeners only to take them to unexpected places.\n\nCherry forged a name playing with Ornette Coleman, whose disregard for earlier rules of rhythm, harmony, and melody proved as divisive as they were liberating. “Brown Rice” is a likewise fusion: free jazz is subsumed by the song, leaving just one strand of DNA. Bassist Charlie Haden further pushes boundaries with funky wah-wah bass. Then come those otherworldly vocals by the world music guru Verna Gillis, a music producer who spent much of the mid-’70s recording the musical tributaries of Africa, the Caribbean, Latin America, Afghanistan, Kashmir, and Iran. “Brown Rice” was 180 degrees from Cherry's origins; when faced with limited options, he broke free. When overwhelmed by possibility, his art became one of reassembly. –David Drake\n\nListen: Don Cherry: “Brown Rice”\n\nSee also: Archie Shepp: “Attica Blues” / George Duke: “For Love I Come”\n\n163.\n\nBruce Springsteen: “Darkness on the Edge of Town” (1978)\n\nThe mid-1970s were dark times for Bruce Springsteen, as he followed his breakthrough album Born to Run with a drawn-out contract dispute with his former manager. It took a few years for him to disentangle himself legally and get back to making music. Perhaps that long idle period gnawed at him, because Darkness on the Edge of Town, finally released in June ’78, was his bleakest record to date. Recording live in the studio, the E Street Band sounded leaner, rawer, and more strident, yet still capable of achieving an aching grandiosity, while the Boss himself punctured the rock’n’roll romanticism that formed the basis of his first three albums. The album’s title track stands out as one of his most despairing tales, ostensibly about a guy yearning for an old lover and the sense of renewed possibility she represents.\n\nThat narrator could be almost any character in any of Springsteen’s previous songs: a guy who’s grown up and away from his dreams, who has faced the world and been trampled down. “I lost my money and I lost my wife,” he sings. “Them things don't seem to matter much to me now.” Like so many of the people who inhabit this album, the “Darkness” narrator lives in a haze of longing for the freedoms of his youth. Springsteen’s first three albums had chronicled the thrill of young men and women trying to escape the pain and drudgery of their lives, but this song and its namesake album suggest that they might only find more of the same, wherever they run. –Stephen Deusner\n\nListen: Bruce Springsteen: “Darkness on the Edge of Town”\n\nSee also: Bruce Springsteen: “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)” / Bruce Springsteen: “Promised Land”\n\n162.\n\nBlack Flag: “Nervous Breakdown” (1979)\n\nBy early 1979, punk’s second wave was in full force. Black Flag had established a brutal self-promo cycle: relentless rehearsals begat furious flyering begat chaotic, violent gigs typically cut short by police. So it’s of little surprise that the opening track to the Southern California group’s debut release erupts like the soundtrack to a prison riot. Volcanic, whiplash, and deeply nihilistic, “Nervous Breakdown” is all panic and no promise, a mission statement for a journey to nowhere that perfectly embodies the era’s pervasive pessimism. The group’s formative influences—the Ramones, the Stooges, Black Sabbath—were already colliding here in brusque, economical fashion, with vocalist Keith Morris presiding as a wild-eyed, cackling Puck. Almost four decades on, “Nervous Breakdown” stands as a tuneful rejection of a status quo that seemed beyond its audience’s ability to upend. Psychosis, inebriation, social disobedience, and mosh pit bloodletting were reasonable enough alternatives. As a rallying sentiment, it still makes too much sense. –Raymond Cummings\n\nListen: Black Flag: “Nervous Breakdown”\n\nSee also: Dead Boys: “Sonic Reducer” / The Bags: “Survive”\n\n161.\n\nThe Nerves: “Hanging on the Telephone” (1976)\n\nThe Nerves only released one power-pop EP in 1976 before falling apart two years later. They were a self-contained, punk-spirited trio from California before the notion of D.I.Y. had been codified. Written by guitarist Jack Lee and famously covered by Blondie on Parallel Lines, “Hanging on the Telephone” is a rudimentary guitar song made perfect by all the things it does wrong: the endearingly flat but totally committed whoa-ohs, the abrupt shifts in rhythm, the pained and outsized yearning. Throughout, the Nerves audibly strive for something that is slightly beyond their reach.\n\n“Hanging on the Telephone” is a film scene in miniature: The Nerves sound like greasers with their T-shirts tucked in, leaning against the phone booth across the hall, desperate for a voice to pick up on the other end. “If I don’t get your call/Then everything goes wrong,” Lee pleads. “Your voice across the line/Gives me a strange sensation.” His vulnerability powers this little track; even the rattling landline ring that opens it sounds melancholy. It might feel like a relic now, but in an era when our phones facilitate and strain so much around matters of the heart, “Hanging on the Telephone” is more relevant than ever—the most disarming song ever written about the fear of being ghosted. –Jenn Pelly\n\nListen: The Nerves: “Hanging on the Telephone”\n\nSee also: Adverts: “One Chord Wonders” / Saints: “(I'm) Stranded”\n\n160.\n\nThe Chi-Lites: “Have You Seen Her” (1971)\n\nThe Chi-Lites’ late-’60s/early-’70s run was strange and erratic, veering from the instantly recognizable “Oh Girl” to the iconic vamp of “Are You My Woman? (Tell Me So),” later immortalized by Beyoncé. But “Have You Seen Her” towers over the group’s catalog, their weirdest and greatest hit. A fuzz guitar worthy of Os Mutantes (or J Mascis) cuts through the track, the perfect distorted tone conveying anguish and mourning before anyone has even said a word on record. And while the song’s tropes are so ingrained into the fabric of pop, R&B, soul, and rock as to be little more than cliches now, “Have You Seen Her” still packs a wallop. It shifts between its obvious debts to doo-wop’s harmonies and a spoken-word narrative influenced by Isaac Hayes’ Hot Buttered Soul, but with a hook so impeccable and graceful it can imbue a cartoon about a missing fish with wistfulness. It exists outside of time, yet it also serves as a reminder of a very specific moment when gospel harmonies and secular heartbreak were allowed to cohabitate on radio. –Matthew Ramirez\n\nListen: The Chi-Lites: “Have You Seen Her”\n\nSee also: Chi-Lites: “Oh Girl” / Temptations: “Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)”\n\n159.\n\nRose Royce: “I’m Going Down” (1976)\n\nThis is one of the all-time great torch ballads. After the Temptations and Marvin Gaye producer Norman Whitfield left Motown, he found his first hit in the former backing band Rose Royce, who recorded the soundtrack and arguably raison d’etre for ensemble comedy Car Wash. Singer Gwen Dickey’s hyper-emotive performance depicts heartbreak like the last stand of a battle, dissolving into tears halfway then rallying once more into the plea; it’s immaculate, but even without him, the impact lands via puttering bass, keening guitars, and piano that lands like teardrops.\n\n“I’m Going Down” is arguably the best-known Rose Royce track, but unlike their future 10th Kingdom theme “Wishing on a Star,” it’s hardly been covered. Aside from reality show aspirants, which hardly count, the only singer to really take on “I’m Going Down” is Mary J. Blige, and even she coats it with enough gloss to blur the message. It’s the rare song that consensus has deemed untouchable. –Katherine St. Asaph\n\nListen: Rose Royce: “I’m Going Down”\n\nSee also: Rose Royce: “I Wanna Get Next to You” / Jackson 5: “I’ll Be There”\n\n158.\n\nTom Petty and the Heartbreakers: “American Girl” (1976)\n\nThe sustained relevance of “American Girl” can be taken as a cynical parable of original sin: Innocence is false, all who are pure of intent do not stand a chance in this world. Nearly every reading of Tom Petty’s 1976 single has infused it with corruption: The most common is that it’s about a woman who leapt to her death from University of Florida’s Beaty Towers (though that urban myth was busted by Petty himself). Silence of the Lambs took the assumed morbidity and escalated it exponentially by contrasting an oblivious singalong with a gruesome fate. It portended doom for an unwitting Hillary Clinton during her failed 2008 campaign. And there’s arguably nothing more sinful than the umpteen covers of this song by seemingly every milquetoast mid-’90s alt-folk band.\n\nAnd yet, “American Girl” endures, as it should. Sonically, it’s the platonic ideal for American rock music: Bo Diddley meets the Byrds, updated for new wave. It’s got a beat, and you can dance to it. Oh yeah and all right, take it easy, make it last all night, cars, girls, boys—it speaks the universal language. Granted, it’s a classic archetype where the girl is left with a broken heart of gold, and the boy’s out there probably doing what boys do. But both are motivated by rock’n’roll’s profound sense of yearning for something—anything—bigger than what this town can provide, that those promises we were raised on are going to come true. –Ian Cohen\n\nListen: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers: “American Girl”\n\nSee also: Bob Seger: “Night Moves” / Joe Walsh: “Life's Been Good”\n\n157.\n\nBobby Caldwell: “What You Won’t Do for Love” (1978)\n\nWhen Bobby Caldwell’s “What You Won’t Do for Love” began its chart ascent in 1978, many heard its impeccable groove, soaring arrangement, and sharp depiction of romance and preemptively labeled him one of the next great black soul artists. There was only one problem: Caldwell was a white Floridian. Fearing that the “blue-eyed soul” label would cost Caldwell his black audience, his label, T.K. Records, obscured his appearance for as long as they could. But as live performances revealed the singer’s identity, his song soared in popularity anyway, ultimately cracking the Top 10.\n\nCaldwell would remain a working musician for three more decades, but his releases never reached the height of his earliest hit. “What You Won’t Do for Love” wasn’t just a surprising debut that balanced smooth jazz, soul, and pop; it transcended racial lines with equal finesse. White soul singers, from Simply Red to Justin Timberlake, have followed its footsteps ever since. –Corey Smith-West\n\nListen: Bobby Caldwell: “What You Won’t Do for Love”\n\nSee also: Isley Brothers: “Footsteps in the Dark” / Bill Withers: “Lovely Day”\n\n156.\n\nWilliam DeVaughn: “Be Thankful for What You Got” (1974)\n\nWilliam DeVaughn’s 1974 single “Be Thankful for What You Got” is a reflection on economic inequality addressed to a disenfranchised black community. It builds its message environmentally; the song shimmers into view like buildings bruising in the heat. “You may not have a car at all,” DeVaughn sings, his voice slipping into a glassy falsetto, “but remember brothers and sisters/You can still stand tall.” It even expresses itself with economy: the arrangement is a lesson in jazzy restraint, all subtleties and small gestures, guitars and organs ebbing until they form a landscape of overlapping shadows. The chorus—“Diamond in the back/Sunroof top/Diggin’ the scene/With a gangster lean”—has been functionally amputated from the song into a larger and more disorganized context; DeVaughn’s words and cadence have been absorbed into the lexicon of hip-hop and modern R&B through both sampling and interpolation, appearing in fragments in songs as varied as N.W.A.’s “Gangsta Gangsta” and Miguel’s “Candles in the Sun.” Wherever it appears, in whatever mutation, it floats in the atmosphere of black urban experience. –Brad Nelson\n\nListen: William DeVaughn: “Be Thankful for What You Got”\n\nSee also: Timmy Thomas: “Why Can't We Live Together” / Curtis Mayfield: “The Makings of You”\n\n155.\n\nChic: “I Want Your Love” (1978)\n\nOf the Chic holy trinity, “I Want Your Love” endures best as a song, rather than a historical landmark (“Le Freak”) or a blueprint for an entire genre (“Good Times”). The group’s essential ingredients are here, with Nile Rodgers’ jangle and Bernard Edwards’ supple bass combining for optimal bounce, but they never quite came together like this. Disco was considered a genre for producers and vocalists, but Chic were a proper band, playing and singing live with such precision they almost sounded mechanical. Here, Chic showcased that sheen while proving they were human after all—the church bells, the sudden blotting of strings that peak during the chorus then reappear later, the stuttered command of the title phrase that pauses long enough to feel menacing. “I Want Your Love” is a disquieting hymn to desire, anchored by a Rodgers/Edwards performance potent enough to suggest the song working its magic in perpetuity, drunk on its own rhythm. –Matthew Ramirez\n\nListen: Chic: “I Want Your Love”\n\nSee also: Norma Jean: “Saturday” / Sister Sledge: “Thinking of You”\n\n154.\n\nT. Rex: “Metal Guru” (1972)\n\nGlam-rock wasn’t just about dudes putting on women’s clothing, it was about giving rock ‘n’ roll itself a makeover by filtering ’50s hot-rod rave-ups through ’60s psychedelia and turning pop music into science fiction. At T. Rex’s early ’70s commercial peak, Marc Bolan didn’t so much write tunes as devise characters begging for their own comic book and action figure spin-offs. His songbook is populated by prosaic subjects transformed into superheroes with single, evocative descriptors: “Mystic Lady,” “Rabbit Fighter,” “Cosmic Dancer,” “Baby Boomerang,” “Telegram Sam.” The songs were mostly nonsense, but rather than sounding like gibberish, Bolan seemed to be speaking in an alien code that, to this today, we’re still not cool enough to decode. And “Metal Guru”—the grand-slam capper to a string of four consecutive UK No. 1 singles—is the most deliriously inscrutable of them all.\n\nEmerging at a moment when rock stars had stopped getting spiritual guidance from maharishis and were starting to think they were deities themselves, “Metal Guru” is Bolan in excelsis, an all-chorus/no-verse bacchanalia of platform-boot stomps, regal orchestration, and helium-buzzed harmonies. At the time, “T. Rextasy” was a popular buzzword in the British music weeklies, but “Metal Guru” renders it as an actual physical sensation; from its opening blast of symphonic fuzz, the song makes you feel like you’ve been thrust into a New Year’s Eve party one second after midnight amid flying streamers, gushing champagne bottles, and a raging dance floor united in screaming, wordless elation. The song’s swooning, swaying melody famously inspired Johnny Marr to write the Smiths’ “Panic,” but its spirit of instantaneous excess can still be felt today every time Wayne Coyne fires off a confetti cannon. –Stuart Berman\n\nListen: T. Rex: “Metal Guru”\n\nSee also: T. Rex: “20th Century Boy” / T. Rex: “Jeepster”\n\n153.\n\nFaces: “Ooh La La” (1973)\n\nFaces weren’t a band, they were a gang—five musketeers united by booze and blues. Underneath that drunken revelry ran a bittersweet undercurrent that often manifested as tattered modern folk tunes. Rod Stewart capitalized on this ragged homespun sound on “Maggie May,” the solo single that turned him into a star in 1971, but Ronnie Lane—the other Face who would take lead vocals—shared an affinity for wearing his heart on his tattered sleeve. Both men attempted lead vocals on “Ooh La La,” a sprightly sing-along Lane wrote with guitarist Ron Wood, which wasn't an unusual move in the band's world. Producer Glyn Johns rejected each in turn, choosing instead Wood, who had never fronted the Faces on record before. Where Lang had a wry sense of irony and Stewart was an unapologetic raconteur, Wood sang with a flat, friendly affect, delivering “Ooh La La” like a bedtime story, which in a sense it was. Written from the perspective of a young man remembering his granddad remembering his travails with women, “Ooh La La” is inherently melancholy. Its chorus,“I wish that I knew what I know now/When I was younger” suggests so much regret, but with its clanging acoustic guitars, barrelhouse piano, and harmonies, the song is as joyous as it is sad.\n\nSo it's a song whose meaning can shift over time. When the Faces cut it in 1973, it felt like closing the book on adolescence; a quarter-century later, Stewart covered it in the wake of Lane's death as an elegy to old friends. Just a year after that, Wes Anderson concluded his coming-of-age comedy Rushmore with \"Ooh La La,\" suggesting that his lead character Max Fischer was the callow youth the song's narrator remembered being, and turning the track—which never was released as a single—into something of a standard. “Ooh La La” endures because of its eternal truths, words written by scamps who had no idea just how wise they were. –Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nListen: Faces: “Ooh La La”\n\nSee also: Faces: “Stay With Me” / Rod Stewart: “Maggie May”\n\n152.\n\nHarry Nilsson: “Without You” (1971)\n\nTo an even greater degree than his fans in the Beatles, Harry Nilsson had a gift for rehabilitating kitsch as something worth taking seriously. The signs of his mastery were there early—the puns (dumb, brilliant), the violins (corny, gorgeous), the perfumed 1920s swoon—but never as clear as they were when Nilsson stepped into an English recording booth having taken what he once described as “a little mescaline” and, in one take, provided a vocal performance so agonizingly dramatic that Derek Taylor, press officer for the Beatles and one of the first people to hear the recording in full, said it would forever remind him of hemorrhoids.\n\nThe performance elevated Nilsson from whimsical with a dash of genius to viable commercial presence. It also more or less invented the power ballad, paving the way for artists with very little to say to say it as meaningfully as possible (“Total Eclipse of the Heart,” “I Will Always Love You,” related karaoke offenses too empty to love but too human to resist). Viewed in the wider context of Nilsson’s erratic, inimitable career, the song is a fluke, an instance of an artist taking it to the bank seemingly just to prove that he could. His Grammy acceptance speech, in full: “Thank you very, very much.” –Mike Powell\n\nListen: Harry Nilsson: “Without You”\n\nSee also: Carole King: “So Far Away” / Carpenters: “Superstar”\n\n151.\n\nTownes Van Zandt: “Pancho & Lefty” (1972)\n\nTexas troubadour Townes Van Zandt’s songbook is situated somewhere between Hank Williams, Lightnin’ Hopkins, and Nick Drake, but “Pancho & Lefty” stands alone. Perhaps the single greatest song penned in the outlaw country movement, it was Townes’ most evocative number, his greatest hit, the song that validated his stature as the songwriter’s songwriter. But it was also his downfall, the success that Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard had with a cover of the song bankrolling Van Zandt’s descent further into alcoholism and substance abuse in his later years. “Pancho & Lefty” reflects its maker: enigmatic, stoic, hardened, surrounded with death on all sides. Take it as a parable about Pancho Villa, or two desperados (one of whom betrayed the other), or perhaps as a foretelling of Van Zandt’s own life, cursed to perpetually live on the road in cheap hotels, his “breath hard as kerosene,” a singer who can’t sing the blues like he used to do. Seek not the polished studio version that features hand drums, mariachi horns and strings, but the skeletal version from Live at the Old Quarter, or the version he sings on Heartworn Highways, showing a young spry man already waiting around to die. –Andy Beta\n\nListen: Townes Van Zandt: “Pancho & Lefty”\n\nSee also: Gene Clark: “Lady of the North” / Willie Nelson: “Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain”\n\n150.\n\nGrateful Dead: “Friend of the Devil” (1970)\n\nWhile known (not incorrectly) for their sprawling, spiraling jams and for being a general acid circus, the Grateful Dead—and, specifically, guitarist Jerry Garcia and lyricist Robert Hunter—contributed a healthy bundle of songs to the modern folk canon. Synthesizing post-psychedelic wisdom with old turns and images pulled from years of devoted folk freakdom, “Friend of the Devil”—co-written with New Riders of the Purple Sage guitarist John Dawson—was a perfect product of the Dead’s short trip from mind-blowing, double-drummer ecstasy to almost literal campfire songs.\n\nFor the Dead, the country vibes were synchronous with a new mission of writing strummable tunes, hymnals, and gentle boogies for all the longhairs settling down in communes or the suburbs. (The band migrated from San Francisco to the idyllic hills of Marin County just as the Summer of Love was ending.) With its pro-Satanic wink right there in the title, a barely coded countercultural handshake, “Friend of the Devil” remained edgier than the peaceful, easy strums of southern California’s burgeoning country-rockers. With its easy descending lick, “Friend of the Devil” exists outside of recordings and charts, ready to be struck up wherever there’s an acoustic guitar and some space to noodle. –Jesse Jarnow\n\nListen: Grateful Dead: “Friend of the Devil”\n\nSee also: Grateful Dead: “Box of Rain” / Creedence Clearwater Revival: “Long As I Can See the Light”\n\n149.\n\nShuggie Otis: “Inspiration Information” (1974)\n\nShuggie Otis’ third album, Inspiration Information, first surfaced in 1974, but it feels tethered to 2001, when a high-profile reissue on David Byrne’s Luaka Bop Records secured its place in the early-’70s soul canon. Up to that point, Otis was infamous as the Frank Zappa sideman who turned down an offer to replace Mick Taylor in the Rolling Stones; his closest brush with pop success came when Quincy Jones turned his 1971 song “Strawberry Letter 23” into a Top 5 hit for the Brothers Johnson six years later. But that Luaka Bop reissue turned wider audiences onto a secret that crate-diggers had professed for years: Otis was less a budding guitar hero than an unsung R&B auteur, the missing link between the funk superstars of yore and modern-day lo-fi bedroom savants.\n\nOtis began recording Inspiration Information in 1971, the same year Marvin Gaye dropped What’s Going On and Sly Stone released his murky, drum-machined masterpiece There’s a Riot Goin’ On—and like those records, Otis’ work re-imagines soul and funk as interior experiences. But while his peers were taking temperature readings of an overheated America, Otis was just trying to keep it cool on a rainy day. Inspiration Information’s title track is a lustrous blur of wah-wahed guitars, cranial-massaging organ, and heavenly harmonies, like the wavy effects that signal the start of a movie dream sequence. The song scans as a literal love note, etched on “pencil pad,” but Otis sings of romance in a language that anticipates digital-age courtship. “I’m going to spread some information,” Otis declares. “You, making me happier/Now I am snappier/While I’m with you.” The phrase “inspiration information” is Otis’ peculiar way of saying “love song”—and today, it retains the eternal promise of finding the former in a world overdosing on the latter. –Stuart Berman\n\nListen: Shuggie Otis: “Information Inspiration”\n\nSee also: Donald Byrd: “(Fallin' Like) Dominoes” / Leroy Hutson: “All Because of You”\n\n148.\n\nWire: “Outdoor Miner” (1978)\n\nIn 1977, Wire were a punk rock band, arty and snappish and loud; in “Outdoor Miner,” they mutated into something else. There's nothing overtly aggressive or confrontational about the track: Wire replaces the buzzsaw guitar tones of Pink Flag with a friendly chime, tempers Colin Newman's urgent bark to a clear-eyed murmur (with harmonies!), tables their \"riff until the lyric runs out\" blurt-structures for more conventional verse-chorus-verse forms. \"Outdoor Miner\" is, in fact, as sweet-sounding a pop song as you could hope to hear, but within that framework, it's an exceptionally weird artifact.\n\nFor one thing, Graham Lewis’ tricky, playful lyrics mostly concern a larval insect, the serpentine leaf miner, which devours its own home. (Wire's previous single, “I Am the Fly,” featured a similar bugs-and-infiltration theme.) Thanks to the band's knack for concision, it's also the very rare case of a song whose single version is substantially longer than the album: EMI, noting that “Outdoor Miner” clocked in at 1:45 on Chairs Missing, asked the band to extend it to be more radio-friendly. (They added a piano solo and a third chorus.) \"Outdoor Miner\" didn't become the crossover hit Wire were hoping for, but it's remained a cult favorite, and it was a point of inspiration for the shoegaze scene: The 2004 compilation A Houseguest's Wish consisted of 19 covers of the song, including versions by Lush, Flying Saucer Attack, and Swervedriver’s Adam Franklin. –Douglas Wolk\n\nListen: Wire: “Outdoor Miner”\n\nSee also: Wire: “The 15th” / Wire: “Map Ref 41°N 93°W”\n\n147.\n\nNina Simone: “Baltimore” (1978)\n\nNo one song can sum up Nina Simone’s brilliant and tumultuous career, but “Baltimore” demonstrates many of its main themes: her ability to best pop’s greatest performers on their own songs, her talent for approaching social issues from new emotional angles, and the gulf between her fans’ opinions of her work and her own. While Simone was outspoken in her criticism of the eponymous 1978 album it appears on, complaining in interviews about jazz vet Creed Taylor’s frequently too-slick pop-reggae production, her cover of “Baltimore” has come to be one of her most beloved songs.\n\nIn his original version, Randy Newman pours on the melodrama in his elegy for a crumbling city, but Simone delivers the lyrics with a world-weary shrug that manages to hit even harder, casually but resoundingly answering the song’s central question—“Ain’t it hard just to live?”—with the heavy, pragmatic truth that yeah, it really fucking is. Nearly four decades later, Baltimore remains a symbol of urban collapse and the unequal distribution of power and justice in American society, and Simone’s tribute has only grown in power. There’s a reason why, when singer Jazmine Sullivan released a cover in the wake of Freddie Gray’s death, it was billed as a Simone cover and not a Newman one. –Miles Raymer\n\nListen: Nina Simone: “Baltimore”\n\nSee also: Gil Scott-Heron & Brian Jackson: “We Almost Lost Detroit” / Labi Siffre: “I Got The...”\n\n146.\n\nDonny Hathaway: “A Song for You” (1971)\n\n“A Song for You,” written and performed by Leon Russell in 1970, went on to be covered by dozens of singers, some of the most important in popular music: Aretha Franklin, Willie Nelson, Whitney Houston, Karen Carpenter, Amy Winehouse, Christina Aguilera, even Bizzy Bone (with help from DMX). It says a lot then that the song is most closely associated with Donny Hathaway. His 1971 version, part of his eponymous second record, is almost uncomfortable to listen to; it feels like something overheard in a corner booth after midnight. “But we’re alone now/And I’m singing this song to you.” With the exception of some well-placed strings, the arrangement is spare, mainly Hathaway at the piano, singing. Or is he confessing? (“I treated you unkindly…”). He may as well have sung it a cappella. He certainly had the voice—warm, well-practiced, with great range, as good or better than any in that already-breathtaking era of R&B and soul.\n\nHathaway, who struggled with depression through the ’70s, didn’t make it out of the decade. On January 13, 1979, at the age of 33, he was found dead outside the Essex House on Central Park South, below the window of his 15th floor room. It was ruled a suicide and makes this refrain in “A Song For You” all the more affecting: “And when my life is over/Remember when we were together/We were alone and I was singing this song to you.” –Michael J. Agovino\n\nListen: Donny Hathaway: “A Song for You”\n\nSee also: Donny Hathaway: “I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know” / Harold Melvin & the Bluenotes: “If You Don't Know Me By Now”\n\n145.\n\nRamones: “Sheena Is a Punk Rocker” (1977)\n\nStories about the Ramones rarely make them seem like a group of guys you’d want to spend time with. Dee Dee Ramone carried an enormous switchblade and once, in a panic, nearly stabbed his landlord. Their famous go-to prank was to put a little urine in their friends’ beer. Their behind-the-scenes reputation was volatile, but their branding instincts were impressive: Even now, after all four original members have passed, the Ramones remain the perfect spirit animals for small-town kids who want to make a break for the big city.\n\nThe music was as fun as it was familiar; their melodic instincts were cribbed from old surf, girl-group, and bubblegum records, but they brought the volume and power they learned from predecessors like the Stooges and MC5. It was tough music for dancing—music you could experience live if you escaped the suburbs and found a place to crash in New York. And so “Sheena Is a Punk Rocker” is a perfect Ramones song for that reason; the band illustrates Sheena’s escape to New York and newfound life as a runaway punk with bubblegum glee and power chord bliss. There are handclaps, sleigh bells, and saccharine harmonies circling Johnny’s oddly jubilant riff. “Well New York City really has it all,” Joey sings. For those listening in their bedrooms, this was the dream—to dance as hard as possible while the four sketchy dudes from the cover of Leave Home played upbeat songs in a filthy room. –Evan Minsker\n\nListen: Ramones: “Sheena Is a Punk Rocker”\n\nSee also: The Ramones: “Judy is a Punk” / Vibrators: “Baby Baby”\n\n144.\n\nElvis Costello & the Attractions: “Radio Radio” (1978)\n\nLike many of the songs cut in 1977 by Costello’s newly assembled band, the Attractions, the instrumental attack of “Radio Radio” carries a clear punk energy, and the song’s lyrics likewise suggest punk sympathies. In protesting the blandness of the BBC’s playlists—and its refusal to give airtime to certain notorious punk records—Costello’s cynicism is easy enough to identify in the bridge: “They say you better listen to the voice of reason/But they don't give you any choice ‘cause they think that it’s treason.” But the track also changes tenor over its course. One claim—“Radio is a sound salvation/Radio is cleaning up the nation”—is sarcastic early on. Yet by the end, the possibility of grace achieved through broadcasting is so palpable, the singer can obviously envision it for real.\n\nOn “Radio Radio,” Costello wills a new, more honest radio landscape into being. It’s this gradually emerging idea of a station “broadcasting from within you”—as Costello put it in his memoir—that allows the bashing anthem to transcend the language of the snide takedown and become a call to aesthetic action. –Seth Colter Walls\n\nListen: Elvis Costello & the Attractions: “Radio Radio”\n\nSee also: Blondie: “Hanging on the Telephone” / Wire: “Ex Lion Tamer”\n\n143.\n\nXTC: “Making Plans for Nigel” (1979)\n\nXTC never needed to skewer nationalist pageantry to capture the gray essence of 1970s England. Even before the parents in “Making Plans for Nigel” affirm their son’s future in British Steel, their conservative aspirations evoke a very specific backdrop: the black and white lattices of the mock-Tudor suburbs that imprison poor, inert Nigel. His “whole future is as good as sealed,” which plays more like a bad omen than a promise of security, with its jittery musical friction. Shaken by the perceived diss, British Steel reportedly gathered four Sheffield employees named Nigel to talk about job satisfaction for trade publication Steel News.\n\nBut “Nigel,” off the Swindon band’s third album Drums and Wires, is more tender and complex than a straightforward anti-establishment tirade. For one, Nigel—who “likes to speak and loves to be spoken to”—never gets a voice. And there’s a subtle panic to his parents’ insistence: They’re defensively only making plans for Nigel, certain he must be happy “in his world,” as leader Andy Partridge harmonizes like a soured Beach Boy. He unleashes erratic cries of “wee-ooh!” like party-blowers into bassist Colin Moulding’s funky geometric scheme, distilling the chaos that any well-meaning parent would have felt in 1979 as their kids’ futures became ever less certain. That year’s Winter of Discontent offered economic collapse and unprecedented striking. Entering power on May 4th, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher would ruthlessly sell off nationalized industries like British Steel. On the sleeve of “Making Plans for Nigel,” XTC’s members aren’t listed by name, but as the sons of Vera and Charlie, Eileen and Peter, Margaret and Roy, and so on. In a splenetic musical era, they sensitively identified the common anxieties shared by both young people and their parents. –Laura Snapes\n\nListen: XTC: “Making Plans for Nigel”\n\nSee also: The Police: “Message in a Bottle” / Joe Jackson: “Is She Really Going Out With Him?”\n\n142.\n\nCheap Trick: “Surrender” (1978)\n\n“The next one is the first song on our new album,” Robin Zander declared to a sold-out crowd at Nippon Budokan in Tokyo, turning a simple remark about sequencing into one of the decade’s most famous bits of stage banter. What makes that introduction so memorable is the fact that it so perfectly understates the song that follows: “Surrender” is a stone classic of American power pop, and on the live version, the audience punctuates the performances with a continuous barrage of shrieks and cries. Onstage or in the studio, Rockford’s finest play the song with such urgency that it’s easy to forget just how funny “Surrender” is, both as a response song to the Who’s “The Kids Are Alright” and as a surprisingly sweet-natured story of generational rebellion. The parents are just as weird and as wild as their teenagers, making out on the couch to Kiss and spinning wild tales of the Women’s Army Corps. Even today, “Surrender” plays like the inversion of Bruce Springsteen’s contemporaneous anthems, promising that it’s possible to grow up and settle down without surrendering or giving yourself away. –Stephen Deusner\n\nListen: Cheap Trick: “Surrender”\n\nSee also: Boston: “More Than a Feeling” / Raspberries: “Go All The Way”\n\n141.\n\nThe Undertones: “Teenage Kicks” (1978)\n\nPunk’s class of 1977 isn’t known for its sensuality. The closest the Sex Pistols ever came to writing a love song was “Submission,” a chronicle of degradation that mocks itself with kissing sounds. X-Ray Spex took another angle on BDSM, comparing women’s subjugation to sadomasochism in “Oh Bondage! Up Yours!” Even Buzzcocks’ lovesick early singles are mostly about wanting people you can’t (or shouldn’t) have. Maybe that explains why the Undertones’ “Teenage Kicks” affected John Peel so powerfully in the fall of 1978: The Irish band’s enthusiastic slobber of a debut single surrendered wholeheartedly to the basic human urges most British punks either attacked or ignored.\n\nBut novelty can’t account for why the song could still reduce Peel to tears in 2001. At the time, the legendary Radio 1 DJ offered this simple, perfect explanation for his decades-long obsession with a two-and-a-half-minute paean to young lust: “There's nothing you could add to it or subtract from it that would improve it.” When Peel died a few years later, its opening line, “Teenage dreams so hard to beat,” became his epitaph. At the risk of reading too much into the inner monologue of a dude fixated on bedding the hot girl he just saw in the street, that’s the lyric that makes the song an unparalleled encapsulation of youth. There’s nothing more teenage than the tendency to confuse desire with less carnal forms of aspiration. –Judy Berman\n\nListen: The Undertones: “Teenage Kicks”\n\nSee also: Television Personalities: “Part Time Punks” / The Only Ones: “Another Girl, Another Planet”\n\n140.\n\nThe Raincoats: “In Love” (1979)\n\nSometime after guitarist Ana da Silva and bassist Gina Birch formed the Raincoats at London’s Hornsey College of Art in 1977, the two musicians—who both sang and were only just learning to play—were listening to a lot of Lou Reed’s Transformer. Birch, then a student of conceptual art, heard a song on the glammy, Bowie-produced album that used a striking amount of echo and was amazed to hear two Lou voices at once. With no immediate access to an echo box herself, she endeavored to apply her own D.I.Y. logic. She just repeated her words over and over—“IN IN IN LOVE LOVE”—giving them a primal edge.\n\nAching and dizzy and thrilling and alive, 1979’s “In Love” echoes like a feeling you can’t get rid of. Like love itself, its rave-ups fall in and out at unexpected turns. Co-produced in a rudimentary basement studio with Texan rock eccentric Mayo Thompson and Rough Trade founder Geoff Travis, Vicki Aspinall’s violin lines sear like barbed wire, drawing out drama. Da Silva’s minimalist noise guitar scrapes at the skull. The clatter of Palmolive’s gleeful tom-bashing reels it all in close.\n\n“In Love” is The Raincoats’ most direct song, and yet it describes the most indirect feeling ever, one called “lovesick” for a reason that “In Love” proves. It is the sound of infatuation that crawls under your skin and makes you delirious, of butterflies that possess you. Its power is elemental—“I’m so happy/Happy sad,” Birch proclaims, “In love is so tough on my emotions”—capturing the exacerbated pain of uncertainty, the distinct absurdity of love as a concept, the obliterating euphoria of an obsession that becomes an avalanche. The contradictions driving “In Love” are what life is about. If you have a beating heart then you know what “In Love” is, and maybe that’s how it manages to twist you from inside. –Jenn Pelly\n\nListen: The Raincoats: “In Love”\n\nSee also: Raincoats: “Fairytale in the Supermarket” / Scritti Politti: “Skank Bloc Bologna”\n\n139.\n\nThrobbing Gristle: “Hot on the Heels of Love” (1979)\n\nBy the time the UK experimentalists Throbbing Gristle released 20 Jazz Funk Greats in December 1979, disco—and the inclusive freedoms it represented—was more or less on its last legs. Margaret Thatcher was in power, and Reagan was on the horizon. The dire times called for satire. Throbbing Gristle answered that call.\n\nTheir grotesque music—synthetic and industrial and strange—offered a defiantly skewed perspective. “Hot on the Heels of Love,” a snickering homage to Giorgio Moroder and Donna Summer’s “I Feel Love,” should be a joke, but it doubles as an acerbic love letter to ’70s pop and a rough prototype for dance music to come. The gonzo four-to-the-floor beat, the nursery-rhyme keys, and the sweeps of vocoder madness make it strangely bacchanalian. There is charm in its frailties; it is meant to dissolve, unravel before your ears, and disappear.\n\nIn some life-affirming way, Throbbing Gristle’s art has always relied upon a radical relationship with standard notions of failure and a satirical understanding of capitalistic success. “Hot on the Heels of Love” is like a guidebook for how to stick a thumb in the eye of normality, its relentless thump offering a profane heartbeat for freaks through the ages, standing up against the oppressive nightmare of picket fences and nuclear families. –Kevin Lozano\n\nListen: Throbbing Gristle: “Hot on the Heels of Love”\n\nSee also: The Normal: “Warm Leatherette” / Devo: “(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction”\n\n138.\n\nBauhaus: “Bela Lugosi’s Dead” (1979)\n\nAesthetic evolution typically unfolds as gradually as evolution in nature, and it’s usually just as hard to pin down when a genre originated as to decide when dinosaurs became birds. Not so for goth rock, though, whose birth we have down to the second: exactly 170 of them into Bauhaus’ debut single, “Bela Lugosi’s Dead,” when Peter Murphy materializes out of a murky fog of dissonant instrumental jamming to declare eternal life as an undead ghoul the new ne plus ultra of cool. He’s freakishly, vampirically convincing enough in this moment to get several successive generations of teenagers, spanning an impressive array of cultures, to join him.\n\n“Bela”’s enduring power is surprising, considering how technically flawed it is. The band recorded it live in one take, and it’s clear that they’d only been playing together for six weeks—the guitar goes out of tune at a few points, and Daniel Ash manages to repeatedly flub a four-note bass line. It’s also nine-and-a-half minutes of messing around with a tape delay trying to make dub reggae sound effects (courtesy of David J, mostly). But that fucked-up, falling-apart quality only makes the song creepier and cooler, and it’s partly why “Bela” is still a dance-floor filler wherever goths flock together. –Miles Raymer\n\nListen: Bauhaus: “Bela Lugosi’s Dead”\n\nSee also: Tubeway Army: “Are ‘Friends’ Electric?” / Iggy Pop: “Sister Midnight”\n\n137.\n\nGil Scott-Heron & Brian Jackson: “The Bottle” (1974)\n\nGil Scott-Heron had one of the most distinctive voices in American music. Better still were his lyrics—cerebral, witty, satirical, caustic, sometimes hilarious, informed by American history and the nuanced black experience within it. Scott-Heron was a poet—he had an MFA in creative writing from Johns Hopkins—but he was also a novelist, and his songs had the feel of indelible short stories. For “The Bottle,” though, he took a nonfiction approach, conducting interviews with alcoholics as background. The song, created with vital collaborator Brian Jackson, was rare for Scott-Heron in that it was danceable, and it was as close as the tandem came to a radio hit, despite the heft of the lyrics. Scott-Heron shows up as a character in the song (“They turn to me/And they ask me Gil/Now don’t you think it’s a crime…”) and then finally, foreshadowing a future that would be bogged down by substance abuse, it ends with his declaration: “Look around on any corner/If you see some brother lookin’ like a goner/It’s gonna be me.” –Michael J.

Written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David for Casino Royale and originally sung by Dusty Springfield, the song has been covered dozens of times. But as remarkable as the original was, paired with Hayes’ ambitious, uncompromising ear for arrangements, it morphed into something else entirely. Backed by a full horn section and symphony orchestra, Hayes refurbished Bacharach and David’s pop gem into an 11-minute gospel-tinged soul odyssey. Coming through the singer’s silky baritone, even the lyrics take on a new feel; while Springfield sang with a cool, sultry air, Hayes belts out the song’s longing with raw desperation. –Corey Smith-West\n\nListen: Isaac Hayes: “The Look of Love”\n\nSee also: Barry White: “Never, Never Gonna Give You Up” / Tom Brock: “I Love You More and More”\n\n135.\n\nMarvin Gaye: “I Want You” (1976)\n\nThough initially intended as producer and co-writer Leon Ware’s own solo album—and his own Musical Massage makes a perfect companion LP—Marvin Gaye’s I Want You is like few other records in R&B history. At a time when hard-driving disco was the norm, Ware’s lush, elegant instrumentation had a subtle poise that felt out of place. But compared with the aggressive grit of soul stars past, it was far too light, too effervescent to be anything but new.\n\nWhere “Let’s Get It On” has an obvious carnality, “I Want You” is a song that suggests a heretofore unexplored intimacy, a vulnerability. This music is naked, and Ware’s delicate instrumentation swirls around as lust tips over the edge of uncertainty. This is the grown-up’s “Let’s Get It On,” a song in which the directness is that much more bold: “Oh, I’ll give you all the love/I want in return, sweet darling,” Gaye purrs over a randy funk beat. “But half the love is all I feel/Ooh, it’s too bad, it’s just too sad.” This is no casual fling: these are adult choices, with a singularly earnest intensity typically heard only in private. –David Drake\n\nListen: Marvin Gaye: “I Want You”\n\nSee also: Leon Ware: “Learning How to Love You” / Minnie Riperton: “Inside My Love”\n\n134.\n\nBrothers Johnson: “Strawberry Letter 23” (1977)\n\nBrothers Johnson were a duo of actual brothers who backed Quincy Jones on a number of his ’70s recordings before stepping out on their own. Their biggest hit, oddly, was thanks to 18-year-old singer/songwriter Shuggie Otis, whose hippie-dippie acid trip of a folk song, “Strawberry Letter 23,” they turned into a serious barn burner. It was a bold decision that paid off. “Pretty music I hear/So happy and loud/Blue flowers echo from a cherry cloud,” go the lyrics, certainly the most childlike and shamanistic words ever paired with a bassline as funky as this one. Supposedly an ode to a paramour and her strawberry-scented love letters, the song’s deeper meaning has always been a mystery and is also beside the point. Its poetry is, above all, a vehicle for bass so big you can take a bite out of it, subtle vocal oohing, keys that define “twinkling.” There’s what you could call a guitar solo in the latter third, but really, it’s more of a dainty impression of a rocket launch. The song soared so high, it still hasn’t landed. –Matthew Schnipper\n\nListen: Brothers Johnson: “Strawberry Letter 23”\n\nSee also: Rufus & Chaka Khan: “Do You Love What You Feel” / Lamont Dozier: “Going Back to My Roots”\n\n133.\n\nThe Abyssinians: “Satta Massagana” (1976)\n\n“Satta Massagana” is central to the sound of Jamaica in the 1970s. Though not a hit upon its release, it has since become a common Rastafari chant that expounds that belief’s culture, as well as a classic reggae anthem. The title of the song is an approximation of the Ethiopian language of Amharic, a very loose transliteration of, roughly, “Give thanks to God.” More than the title that references Ethiopia; allusion to Haile Selassie and Biblical prophecy unspool throughout as the Abyssinians—a trio of Rastafari singers—provide an outline of their beliefs in a chant: “There is a land far far away/Where there's no night, there's only day/Look into the book of life and you will see.”\n\nThe groove of “Satta Massagana” spurred on many reggae acts in Jamaica, and continues to still.
