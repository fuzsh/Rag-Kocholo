        "text": "“I will follow him, follow him wherever he may go / There isn’t an ocean too deep / A mountain so high it can keep me away”\n\nIntroduction:\n\nWelcome back to Cover Me Badd, where we look at good covers, bad covers and what makes them tick. And because I only ever really do these articles once a month, it’s surprising that I’ve never actually developed any sort of backlog doing these articles. At least, until now. This one has been at least 4 months in the making; the idea came to me at least in July, but I wasn’t able to finish it in time for my projected deadline, so I kept it on the wayside, long after the reason why I even decided on this article faded from relevance. What can I say, other, better article ideas came to me and I followed my muse. But I think it’s about time to finally get this one out there.\n\nBack in July, we saw the commemoration of the 10-year anniversary of a boyband that, for better or worse, made a massive impact on pop music.\n\nThe reactions garnered by this video were… mixed, as you’d expect from the fanbase of any long broken-up band as rabid and devoted as the Directioner fanbase. Many fans were expecting something more than just a video, like new music or a tour or whatever. You’d think we would’ve learned by now after the fiasco that was N’Sync’s “hiatus”, but it seems The only other 10-year anniversary tease I can think of that attracted this much disappointment was the My Chemical Romance box set of 2016. Back then, though, it was big news, so much so that I thought it appropriate to finally tackle one of their actual covers for Cover Me Badd–their cover of “One Way or Another/Teenage Kicks”.\n\nI postponed this article because I wanted to do this one justice. Full disclosure, I wanted to be really careful with this one because these two songs are probably two of my favorite songs of all time. The late 70s and early 80s punk and new wave scene is one of my favorite musical periods; it was a fertile ground for some of the most stylish, artistically pioneering sounds in music history, and the impact of this period cannot be overstated. It was a bold, new, fresh, exciting scene whose legacy is still felt in every facet of the modern pop landscape, from our propensity towards music videos, eye-catching visuals, simplicity and the DIY spirit, and so many others. There’s a reason why your average indie band will inevitably look to this period when they wanna do retro throwbacks; this period is still the gold standard of cool in both the rock and pop worlds.\n\nAnd these two bands are some of my favorite acts from that scene. Blondie is one of my all-time favorite bands period, while the Undertones’ “Teenage Kicks” is, for my money, one of the greatest songs ever written. So it’s a tall order for me to have to be objective about this topic; I’d naturally be protective over these two songs. But One Direction have covered many songs over their illustrious career, and the boys have enough talent and musicality that I’m willing to give credit for. They’ve proved surprisingly willing to delve into musical styles they’re unfamiliar with, and they have artistically matured over the course of their career.\n\nSo one way or another, let’s look at how I’m gonna find this ambitious mashup of two great new wave classics.\n\nThe original:\n\nYou talk to just about any music nerd, music writer, music journalist or just about anyone with a passing familiarity of music history, and with rose-colored glasses they will tell you about the spirit of ‘77, and the birth of punk rock.\n\nPunk rock was an explosive movement in a lot of ways. It was an aggressive reaction against what was perceived to be an increasingly bloated rock scene, full of artsy-fartsy prog rock multi-instrumentalists who did nothing but pump out twenty-minute long musical suites, whose emphasis on craft over substance was so overblown that the music was seen as inaccessible to the masses. So when it hit the scene, no one really knew what to make of it. The conventional wisdom was that you had to know how to play in order to make it big as a rockstar, but here were these snot-nose brats who only knew like two or three chords making these aggressive, fast and hard-hitting songs that rarely went over two minutes, all of which sounded like abrasive, tuneless garbage. But it was abrasive, tuneless garbage that evidently captured something real, and so it spread like wildfire, taking ahold of the music industry and changing the way we perceived what constituted music forever.\n\nOr at least, that’s the legend. But if you were there at the time, it all depended on where you were, and what scenes you were aligned with. If you were in the US, and, for that matter, in a small town without a real scene, your only real options for rock were either AOR fluff or the increasingly-embarrassing attempts of classic rockers to try and go disco.\n\nThe first wave of punk rock was not big in the way we know it, at least not in America, where tastes have always skewed more conservative. Oh, sure, there was a burgeoning moral panic early on, but the music didn’t really cross over into like, actual mainstream radio play or anything. This kind of nervy, confrontational rock wasn’t capturing the mass consciousness as music; Jan Brady wasn’t going to put on ‘I Wanna Be Sedated’ or ‘Blank Generation’ in his spare time, you feel? This wasn’t really stuff that your grandma would ever hear on the radio, so even though many of the first punk acts were American, if you were a punk musician your options were pretty much limited to the CBGBs and other highly specific scenes. Sure, you had your outliers; Patti Smith, the godmother of punk, scored a Top 20 hit in 1978 with ‘Because The Night’, but only thanks to a Bruce Springsteen co-write, and her adoption of a very un-punk, classic rock sound.\n\nOn the other hand, if you were in the UK, where the population is smaller, the scenes tend to be far less regionalized and it’s not as difficult to reach across demographics, and where the people were more comfortable with daring stylistic shifts, then you were on fertile ground.\n\nPunk rock grew further and faster in the UK; it was far easier to become a punk megastar there. Punk was in the national consciousness on both sides of the Atlantic, but it was far easier to become a fixture of pop culture there. The Brits had more of an appetite for this sort of thing; they were just coming off the glam rock era, and many of punk’s stylistic cues, from its structural simplicity to its wild, outrageous aesthetics, had come from British glam acts like T. Rex and Slade. So it’s really no surprise that it was in this musical environment where our two acts, Blondie and The Undertones, began their stories.\n\nNow, Blondie are American, and The Undertones are Northern Irish, but it was really in the UK punk scene where they both made their names. Blondie formed in New York in the spring of 1975, when founding members Debbie Harry and Chris Stein, having performed in a few bands together, teamed up with drummer Clem Burke, bassist Gary Valentine (later replaced by Frank Infante and Nigel Harrison), and keyboardist Jimmy Destri. They named themselves after a cat-call Harry would regularly receive after she’d bleached her hair blonde (one of the greatest ironies in music history).\n\nThey were big in the New York punk scene, playing regular gigs at CBGB in the mid-70s, around the time punk was just beginning to blow up. By this time Blondie released their debut in ‘76, Patti Smith and the Ramones were already becoming big damn deals. It was as good a time as any to break through, and when an Australian countdown show accidentally played their twee, cutesy ballad ‘In The Flesh’ instead of their more abrasive single ‘X Offender’, it caught on to a wide audience and netted them mainstream success for the first time. They became huge worldwide, especially in the UK, where there was more of a market for punk rock, but for the longest time, their success just wasn’t translating to an American market. How could a hardscrabble, abrasive punk band like them ever hope to get big there?\n\nAs it turns out, they had to do it by jumping on the disco bandwagon.\n\nAs a punk band, Blondie only had limited success, but their brief flirtation with disco, ‘Heart of Glass’ took them all the way to #1 in January 1979. Their album Parallel Lines skyrocketed to the top of the charts, finally allowing them to break through in America. And incidentally, as the first wave of punk began to dissolve into its constituent subgenres, Blondie’s overnight success made them the leading lights of a rapidly emerging splinter genre that would soon emerge as the defining aesthetic of the early 80s–new wave.\n\nThere were already numerous artsy weirdos playing with the bizarro concepts and eye-catching visuals that would come to be associated with the genre, of course, but new wave owes something to Blondie’s pop-friendly take on punk vacancy. Debbie Harry had an iconic look and style that made her the focal point of the group, and as one of the earliest bands to film actual music videos for their work, they pretty much pioneered the pop girl video vixen model that would come to define pop music for the MTV generation, long before even Michael or Madonna.\n\nBut another reason that they caught on so much is that Parallel Lines is just a damn good album. It’s the best of both worlds, balancing out the punk energy with a knack for infectious, razor-sharp hooks. Debbie Harry was always influenced by ‘60s girl groups, and her approach reflected that, which is why her voice could seamlessly alternate between blank euphoria and guttural fierceness. Case in point–\n\n‘Heart of Glass’, as great as it was, could’ve easily ended up just another black-sheep hit for Blondie, the kind of unrepresentative sample of their catalogue that dooms lesser bands to one-hit wonderdom. It’s ‘One Way or Another’, which in itself became a decent-charting hit, that helped balance out the band’s reputation. By the summer of 1979, punk and new wave wasn’t nearly as much a novelty, so there was more of an audience for this, but I still can’t imagine another song before this that was this unabashedly unhinged. And I mean unhinged. The song’s approach isn’t exactly subtle, but it’s amazing just how much of it permeates even the musical structure. That chord pattern is no joke; the way it shifts from major key to minor key is deliberate; the point is to unnerve you. The way the song just starts descending, with Harry making full use of her lower register, it all comes together in a glorious way.\n\nBut more than anything else, it’s the attitude of the song that makes it great. The song was written about a stalker ex-boyfriend of Harry’s who just wouldn’t leave her alone. Harry describes it as her attempt at injecting a little levity into the situation by putting herself in the stalker role, and you can tell she was having fun with it all the way through. That’s what made Blondie so great; even as the 80s got more and more self-impressed, the band never really took themselves all that seriously. They approached everything with a disinterested smirk and a wink; it was a kind of unabashed cool that you just didn’t find in a lot of places, not even in the ‘90s, the era of irony for irony’s sake. And the net effect is that in the rare times when they tear it up, they tear it up and you notice. So when the insane carousel ride that is ‘One Way or Another’ ends, you don’t forget it.\n\nBut while Blondie may have proven their trans-Atlantic appeal, the Undertones’ cultural impact is decidedly far narrower and more specific.\n\nBefore we begin, It is absolutely important for you to understand that these guys come from Northern Ireland, because we’re talking about the year 1979. And let’s just say those times were… troubled.\n\nThe decades of sectarian violence that wracked Northern Ireland may seem like a distant memory to most people now, so it’s surprising to remember just how recently it all ended, just in 1998. It was recent enough that most people were still around to hear it immortalized in ‘Zombie’. And considering how things are currently unfolding in the UK, it looks like it might not be so distant anymore… but anyway. The point is that times were rough; Northern Ireland was deeply divided among ethnic and religious lines. Car bombs were a constant threat, and basically anyone could be held hostage and blown up should they be in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was a difficult time, to put it mildly.\n\nSo to hear this band of young, scrappy ragamuffins, releasing fun, upbeat songs that weren’t about the war, but were about normal teenage things like girls, shoes and young love? That had to be refreshing, and it’s in fact one of the reasons why the band remains so beloved to this day. And indeed, it struck a chord, not just with Northern Irish teenagers, but with legendary BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, who, when he was first introduced to the band’s debut EP, he became captivated by one song one in particular, the title track.\n\nThis song was their ticket to the big time. Peel loved it so much that it went on to become one of his favorite songs of all time. With his pull, the song was able to attract a mass audience, and in the feeding frenzy that followed, the band managed to get signed to burgeoning indie and punk label Sire Records, run by legendary record executive Seymour Stein, who heard ‘Teenage Kicks’ on the radio himself. This made the Undertones big damn deals, and as their debut EP swept the nation, they were able to score a gig opening for The Clash’s American tour in 1979.\n\nAnd honestly, there was no way ‘Teenage Kicks’ was never not going to get big, at least in the UK. From that very first opening blast, you know this song was destined to be a hit; it just feels grand, in a way you don’t really get from most punk songs. And it’s weird because the song wasn’t trying to sound grand, I don’t think. At its core, it’s pretty simple–it’s just about young love budding; it’s a guy who can’t’ get over the rush he gets when he thinks about his love interest. But it’s just so damn catchy and earnest, not to mention bouncy and sincere, that you can’t help but love it with all your heart. I don’t think a song has ever grown on me as quickly as this one did; it just has so much charm and personality oozing out. It’s not really easy to put into words, but when you hear it, you hear it.\n\nThe delivery by lead singer Feargal Sharkey does a lot to sell the song; the innocent desire in his voice ends up lending tremendous depth to innocuous-sounding like ‘A teenage dream’s so hard to beat’ . Technically, this is pop punk, but it’s pop punk in the most primitive sense, in that there wasn’t really a line separating the two genres the way there is now. But it gets at the heart of the genre, what makes it resonate–it perfectly captures the yearning and restlessness that characterizes teenage life. What this song is is just simple, fleeting emotions, but in the moment you feel them so powerfully that nothing else really seems to matter. It’s an approach to portraying teenage emotions that I wish ore of the pop punk bands of my youth had taken, rather than the narcissistic self-absorbed whining they often devolved into.\n\nSo there you have it, two great new wave standards, both from the same year. So let’s see which bus One Direction takes in order to follow them home.\n\nThe cover:\n\n*sigh* Okay, let’s get to it.\n\nOkay, so enough British pop culture has attracted a global audience that most of us have at least a vague idea of the basic trappings, but they do still have many traditions peculiar to their island. One of which is their weird obsession with charity singles.\n\nSo… there’s this ongoing charity relief program in Britain called Comic Relief. It’s been running since 1986, and it hosts an annual event called Red Nose Day, which is like this annual telethon thing where celebrities and other big names participate, rally support and help raise money. It basically adopts a variety show and sketch show format, and the ultimate vibe it’s going for is to be both funny in order to gain traction, and serious enough to get you to donate.\n\nAnd considering that this is a British charity event that started in the 80s… well you can imagine just how well they portray the starving African masses, you feel? Nothing about this event has aged well at all, and even though it’s still a British institution that attracts millions of viewers, it has come under fire in recent years for its seeming perpetuation of white savior narratives, among other things, along with all the other criticisms of charity in general, like the superficial feel-goodism that fails to address the root causes of poverty and all that jazz.\n\nNone of that is why we’re discussing them today, though. Look, they may do good work in Africa or something, but I’m speaking as a music critic here, and as a music critic, the only thing Comic Relief has ever done for me is spout an endless string of terrible, terrible charity singles.\n\nCharity singles are bad, as a rule, but no other charity has produced so much of them, and so varied a selection as Comic Relief. That these singles tend to raise tons of money is, I can only assume, the ultimate act of charity, because I can’t believe anyone actually buys these singles because people like them. I went on a sampling of all of these charity singles, and while most of them tend to just be bland (special mention to Westlife’s gutless cover of ‘Uptown Girl’ and McFly’s ‘All About You’) some of them just made my jaw drop.\n\nWhy do I bring this all up? Well, because, for one, I really wanted you guys to hear Mr. Bean fronting Iron Maiden. But also, it’s because it was for Comic Relief that One Direction decided to record their infamous mash-up of “One Way or Another” and “Teenage Kicks”. I mean, their participation in Comic Relief was happening, one way or the other (pun intended). It was 2013, they were at the peak of their fame and success. For any British celebrity trying to cater to a family audience, it was the next logical step.\n\nNow, you might be thinking that One Direction deciding to cover two hardscrabble punk songs from the ‘70s is an inherently terrible idea. And it’s not like I’m gonna be bursting any bubbles in this article or anything, but I will say that this cover, as bizarre and ill-conceived as it seems, actually did have a shot. One Direction were kind of unique in their inception, in that they were subtly calculated to break every single boy band stereotype out there. As Kitty Empire puts it, they were kind of the ‘middle class’ boy band, geared more towards appealing to a sense of authenticity and goofiness more relatable to millennial teenagers than their heavily made-up 90s counterparts. They didn’t adopt any of the electropop or EDM sounds then prevailing in the market, they didn’t have choreographed dances or matching outfits, and they were more likely to cover Wheatus than they were 98 Degrees. It could’ve happened; after all, 5 Seconds of Summer successfully positioned themselves as a sort of scrub-clean All Time Low. One Direction could’ve, too.\n\nOf course, it’s safe to say that’s not what happened here.\n\nLook, when I say that this cover wasn’t an inherently bad idea, I was talking purely sonically. But considering who One Direction are, their status as a squeaky-clean bunch of goofballs, and the fact that this single is in service of a saccharine charity musical program, yeah this was pretty much doomed from the start. Like I said, the best thing about ‘One Way or Another’ is how cohesive and solidly executed the concept is. The whole ‘crazed stalker’ theme permeates the entire song, down to each individual note, and it’s precisely that tight conceptual bedrock that allows the band to let loose and have fun with it. That’s where the magic comes from, and because it’s so well-orchestrated, you can enjoy it for the theatrical thrillride that it is.\n\nBasically, what I’m saying is that One Direction’s approach is fundamentally incompatible with the very essence and spirit of the song.\n\nI mean, just listen to how it starts. I wasn’t expecting any abrasive or snotty punk energy from One Direction or anything, but still, the sound of those processed guitars, the loss of Clem Burke’s energetic drumming, or even just the way they ditch the entire rhythmic structure of the original, it’s just painful to hear. The cheap, overpolished sheen of the entire thing killed my interest from the very beginning, and it’s not helped by the fact that One Direction inexplicably took a fun, upbeat jock jam approach to their reinterpretation. Of this song, of all songs. The original is fun, but it’s fun in a manic, darkly comedic way; it doesn’t quite work translated into a pump-up stadium anthem. The worst part is when they replace the carousel breakdown of the bridge, which is, y’know, the clearest indicator of the sheer insanity that informs the song, and replace it with a ‘We Will Rock You’ style slew of na-na-nas; there’s never been a clearer example of a cover missing the point than this.\n\nSee I think the approach they were going with was, y’know surface level, just reading it as a vanilla yandere sort of thing, which is bolstered by the specific way they interpolate ‘Teenage Kicks’. But rather than come off cutesy or adorable like they were probably hoping to, it just comes off kind of confused and watered down. Again, if they had chosen literally any other song, it could’ve worked, but because comic horror is so infused in the bones of ‘One Way or Another’, the One Direction approach fails to fully wash away the essence of the original. Beneath the upbeat sheen, the subtle notes of horror still lurk underneath, like that descending chord pattern, the minor key, the threatening lyrics, they’re still there.\n\nSo instead of getting a charming boyband number, all you do get is a song that’s just subtly discordant and off-putting. Which is not helped by the fact that a song about a crazed stalker is significantly less charming when it’s coming from five dudes. Seriously, I can’t believe no one in the recording booth even thought of the possibility that it might not have been the best idea. It was fine when it was being hammed up and played for shits and giggles by Debbie Harry, and I can stand ‘Every Breath You Take’, but the significantly less theatrical take of the boys, and the lack of intention behind it, makes it all the harder to stomach. Seriously, try listening to this song without actually watching the video, and you’ll see what I mean.\n\nWhich makes me wonder–if they wanted so badly to make a fun upbeat song about teenage love… why not just cover ‘Teenage Kicks’ by itself? The song was right there; they clearly knew about it. Sure John Peel might roll in his grave, but it’s a perfectly serviceable song for a band like One Direction, and they had enough British-Irish cred to pull it off. Why didn’t they just do that instead?\n\nThe verdict:\n\nThis cover is an overpolished, soulless rerendering of the original that misses the point entirely. It’s basically the Glee or Kidz Bop version of the original. But more than that, this cover sucks because it’s ultimately forced to work against itself. Rather than try to play on what made the original great, One Direction systematically scrubbed ‘One Way or Another’ of everything that made it so special, and instead tried to force it into a role it wasn’t meant to play. The moral of the story being, maybe sometimes it’s better to just have Mr. Bean spouting electoral gibberish over heavy metal riffs."
