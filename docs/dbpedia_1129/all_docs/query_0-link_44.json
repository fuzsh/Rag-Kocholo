        "text": "Conscious Business AI: Mindful Technology\n\nCome and discover the transformative power of AI for your conscious business. I’m hosting what I feel is a groundbreaking online workshop that will be both fun and exciting, not to mention very helpful to get your skills out into the world.\n\nRead more\n\nWhy Is This The Best Online Yoga Nidra Teacher Training\n\nI’m absolutely passionate about Yoga Nidra! Seriously. I’ve taught and practiced literally THOUSANDS of hours of classes, privates sessions and Yoga Nidra Teacher Trainings. This is why I created what I feel is the best online Yoga Nidra teacher training program out there. I understand the power and importance of Yoga Nidra and becoming an extraordinary and effective Yoga Nidra teacher to truly make lasting transformation for your clients and students so I created what I feel is the best online Yoga Nidra teacher training out there.\n\nRead more\n\nHelp Us. Help Us.\n\nMay we all celebrate every new day we get to live on this beautiful and complicated earth. And like Ram Das says, may we all help each other by taking each other by the hand as we walk each other home.\n\nHelp us [to] help us.\n\nRead more\n\nLive Yoga Nidra Training: What Do You Love?\n\nEverybody’s got their thing.\n\nJulia loved to cook.\n\nPicasso loved to paint\n\nHoudini loved to submerge himself in water upside down, locked by his ankles with padlocks to see if he could get out alive.\n\nWhatever.\n\nWe all gotta lean into whatever we love, right.\n\nMe? I love teaching Yoga Nidra. I feel I was BORN for it, you know?\n\nI love helping people not only find massive benefits in their life through practicing better rest, better sleep, and managing stress, but also with other important things. Things like aligning personal and global perspectives, about sourcing a sea of creativity within, and relaxing deep enough to finally turn off the chatter in the incessant hamster wheel of the mind. With Yoga Nidra a person can tap the part of themselves that already knows the solution to life’s biggest and smallest problems and allows those solutions to rise to the surface.\n\nI love that you don’t need any prior experience of yoga or meditation to do Yoga Nidra and that a person can get massive benefits even from their first session. I love that it offers even the newest of practitioners—often people who roll into class in cuz their wife told them that unless they learn to chill the $%^& out they would need to find a new place to call home—an easy way to experience effortless and lasting rest.\n\nAnd when you’ve spent as much time as I have practicing, teaching, thinking and writing about Yoga Nidra, the topic gets really expansive. So I love exploring the nitty-gritty of not only what Yoga Nidra is—its history, its method, its purpose—but alo why it works, the neuroscience and psychology of it.\n\nFor me, I love to connect the dots between Yoga Nidra and myths, storytelling, poetry, and my own personal life stories—YOUR life stories—to see how it’s such a powerful and available pointer that reminds us of who we truly are and how we are all truly connected.\n\nWho knew you could get all of this from a guided nap?\n\nIn addition to teaching Yoga Nidra I also love, love, LOVE teaching OTHERS how to teach Yoga Nidra. I think what I love most about it is training other people how to facilitate massive and positive benefits in the lives of the people who are in their particular niche, those they encounter regularly whether they are clients, students, family, or members of a particular community. I love teaching about how Yoga Nidra is more than just guided meditation, more than another guided visualization. So much more. It’s more than checking out and dreaming yourself into bliss. It’s also a pathway to awakening to the truth of who you are. That’s why I call my method, Waking Up with the Yoga of Sleep.\n\nWhat do you love to do?\n\nDo you love to make a difference in people’s lives?\n\nMaybe you’re a teacher, a therapist, a coach.\n\nMaybe you teach yoga or meditation.\n\nMaybe you’re a school teacher.\n\nCould Yoga Nidra be one of the tools you use regularly to help you do whatever you love to do? Could it help you stand out in your field? Could it help those you’re in contact with every day?\n\nThis weekend begins my next live Yoga Nidra training where together we will dive deep into the art and science of Yoga Nidra and explore how it can help you to facilitate positive transformation for your clients, students, family, and especially for yourself.\n\nWhat is the particular niche of people you hang with regularly, whether through your job, history or situation in life? Could they benefit from Yoga Nidra offered in only the way that you can offer it?\n\nSo, whether you’re connecting with others through coq au vin, cubism, or conjuring an escape, Yoga Nidra can help you help others in massive ways.\n\nNow’s the time for you to learn to teach Yoga Nidra for yourself and for others.\n\nCheck out the details below.\n\nLive and In-Person\n\nand via Zoom\n\nSalt Lake City, Utah\n\nAn in-depth Yoga Nidra training\n\nfor teachers, coaches, and therapists\n\ninterested in facilitating powerful transformation\n\nfor self and others.\n\nMay 11th & 12; 18th & 19th\n\nYoga Nidra and Small Kindnesses\n\nToday, I am excited to tell you about my next live Yoga Nidra teacher training, Restore Yoga workshop, as well as offer you this incredible poem …\n\nI heard Helena Bonham Carter read this poem and it stopped me in my tracks. Granted, she could read the IRS filing instructions and it would sound inspiring and poetic.\n\nSmall Kindnesses\n\nBy Danusha Lameris\n\nI’ve been thinking about the way, when you walk\n\ndown a crowded aisle, people pull in their legs\n\nto let you by. Or how strangers still say “bless you”\n\nwhen someone sneezes, a leftover\n\nfrom the Bubonic plague. “Don’t die,” we are saying.\n\nAnd sometimes, when you spill lemons\n\nfrom your grocery bag, someone else will help you\n\npick them up. Mostly, we don’t want to harm each other. We want to be handed our cup of coffee hot,\n\nand to say thank you to the person handing it. To smile\n\nat them and for them to smile back. For the waitress\n\nto call us honey when she sets down the bowl of clam chowder, and for the driver in the red pick-up truck to let us pass.\n\nWe have so little of each other, now. So far\n\nfrom tribe and fire. Only these brief moments of exchange.\n\nWhat if they are the true dwelling of the holy, these\n\nfleeting temples we make together when we say, “Here,\n\nhave my seat,” “Go ahead—you first,” “I like your hat.”\n\nI love the notion of “these fleeting temples we make together” the container of love made by a simple gesture, a kind word, a smile.\n\nTo me, this poem epitomizes that fascinating intersection I like to play at and study, that crossroads between our humanness and our beingness. Here, we can celebrate the messiness of being human, knowing that behind the hot mess that is being human, there is a foundation of goodness, and compassion.\n\nWe are Source and Source is love.\n\nI love practicing our ability to compassionately respond to life’s ups and downs instead of reacting to them. Practicing this essential skill through Yoga Nidra is like learning to become a ninja of life, except of course that instead of mastering nunchucks and throwing stars, you get to lie down and practice napping your way to enlightenment while drifting on clouds of bliss. When you get done, you get to go back out into the world and show up as your best, most responsive self.\n\nTo help us all practice this essential life skill, I invite you to join me for my Restore Yoga and Yoga Nidra workshop and my live, in-person and online Yoga Nidra training.\n\nLive Yoga Nidra Teacher Training:\n\nMay 11–12; 18–19, Salt Lake City and via Zoom\n\nYoga Nidra is far more than guided visualization—it's a profound pathway to personal transformation and even spiritual awakening.

In my Yoga Nidra teacher training I encourage people to make this practice accessible and for some that might mean calling it something different. Maybe the name “Yoga Nidra” would turn off someone who could potentially be interested in the practice.\n\nHere, I share an idea of my encounters with this issue and I’ve come up with some alternate names, many are so bad that they’re good.\n\nI meet a lot of people thanks to my dog.\n\nAustralian Cobberdogs are absurdly social creatures and so when I’m with my dog and we are walking the neighborhood or running trails or throwing the ball at the dog park and my dog finds someone he simply cannot pass by (everyone) without greeting, with loving, without pouring his doggie heart to, when he is literally shaking and crying at the feet of his current victim of affection, the person who he has forcefully pulled into his presence with the tractor beams of his puppy love emanating from his big brown uber-cute eyes, as he is quivering with unfettered delight as his most recent best friend is scratching his ears scratched, of course, the humans gotta start to talk. I mean you can only coo over a dog for so long.\n\nSo as the conversation starts, inevitably, I see it coming. Sooner or later I know I’m going to get hit with the question.\n\nYou know the question.\n\nIt’s the default question we all ask, almost unconsciously, when we are trying to get to know someone. We are trying to understand who this person is. We are trying to politely size them up. When we are trying to somehow mentally wrap them up in a bow and place somewhere on a familiar shelf in our mind.\n\nThe question: What do you do?\n\nWe ask because subconsciously we want to know whether we can trust this person. We are curious whether this new person we’ve just met is a doctor, a doorman, a student, a stunt double, a stay-at-home parent or a stay-away-from-me bodyguard. I don’t know, maybe they are an accountant. But regardless, we all are curious to know, right?\n\nWe ask what a person does because that kind of implies their financial and social status— and we like to size people up like that. Gross.\n\nPersonally, I feel a far better question is to ask a person what they LIKE to do. This opens the door for a much more interesting conversation.\n\nFortunately for me, I can give the same answer whether I’m asked what I do (for a living) or what I like to do.\n\nBut here’s the problem …\n\nIt’s kind of hard to tell people what I do. What I REALLY do I fear they don’t get it, won’t understand.\n\nI tell people, “I’m an author, teacher, and mentor around the subjects of yoga, mindfulness, and wellness.”\n\n“Oh.”\n\n“… Cool ….”\n\nI see the gears whizzing away in their heads as they stand there and try to figure me out. I see them looking for the crystals hanging around my neck. I see them start sniffing for the not-so-faint scent of patchouli. I see them scanning my body to see what a career of practicing yoga has done to my form.\n\nIf they press on with more questions, I’ll get a little more specific. I’ll tell them that while I teach a lot of forms of yoga I’m an expert teacher and trainer in a relaxing form of yoga called Yoga Nidra.\n\nYoga Ninja?!\n\n“What? Yoga Ninja?! Like martial arts?”\n\n“Oh.”\n\n“… Cool ….”\n\n“No, it’s Yoga Nidra. Nidra means something like sleep in Sanskrit, or better said, that interesting place between sleeping and consciousness. Yoga Nidra feels like a guided meditation and is the practice of using systematic relaxation and layered awareness to deeply rest the body. It’s super effective at nourishing the body, the nervous system, and can also calibrate a person’s entire personal and global perspective on life. I call my Yoga Nidra program Waking Up with the Yoga of Sleep because through guided rest practices, a person can wake up from the illusions of limitation and wake up to the truth to their true potential as they celebrate the intersection between their human-ness and their being-ness.”\n\nThen I take a deep breath.\n\n“Oh.”\n\n“… Cool ….”\n\nOften it’s at about this point, I realize that I’ve gone too far. They start looking at their watch and start addressing my dog, telling him that despite his plaintive whimpers and uber-cute eyes, they MUST get going, that they have a meeting happening soon.\n\nA Rose Buy Any Other Name\n\nIn truth, I think I lose people at the name.\n\nYoga Nidra may be what it’s called but when people hear the word yoga, they think stretchy pants and impossible poses and what in the hell is Nidra, anyway?\n\nI think I might be better off calling Yoga Nidra something different. You know, to help people realize that what happens in these sessions is approachable, enjoyable, yet very necessary.\n\nIn my Yoga Nidra teacher training program, I teach the value of making the practice accessible. If the name Yoga Nidra would turn someone off and potentially preclude them from experiencing the benefits of this life-changing practice, then perhaps you’d be better off calling it something different.\n\nAfter all, “A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.”\n\nSo I’ve been brainstorming some names that I could call this practice and I’d love to get your feedback.\n\nHere goes … (not all of these are winners and some of them are so bad that they are good.\n\nRested Development\n\nSnooze Fest\n\nThe Chill Pill\n\nRelax Shack\n\nRest and Roll\n\nRestafarian (so bad it’s good)\n\nRelaxed Witnessing\n\nBeing Chill\n\nRelax, already.\n\nTrue Rest\n\nRest Teacher\n\nRest Method\n\nRested Soul\n\nThe Rest Guy\n\nRight Rest\n\nAwakened Sleep\n\nRest Ninja\n\nThe Rest Fest\n\nRight Rest\n\nRest Right\n\nBest Rest\n\nAnyway, those are a few ideas that came off the top of my head.\n\nWhat are your ideas? If you’re familiar with Yoga Nidra, how would you describe it? Do you have any killer names that would make someone be just a little curious about this practice?\n\nPlease reach out, I’d love to hear from you.\n\nArt Doesn't Happen In A Vacuum: The Context of A Love Supreme\n\nA Love Supreme: What Was Going On In 1964–5?\n\nArt doesn’t happen in a vacuum.\n\nIt’s the product of the events that preceded it.\n\nAnd in some cases art can even forecast the future, or at very least guide us into the future with wisdom and hope.\n\nI think with a lot of art that seems so immortal, so timeless, art that can withstand the test of time, it’s easy to think that it just somehow arose out of the ether one day and will forever live untouched by the events surrounding its inception.\n\nI mean, think about Picasso’s masterpiece Guernica. Though we may think of it now as timeless, it’s rooted as a statement against war after the bombing of the city of Guernica in the Basque country in 1937.\n\nThe inimitable novel Les Misérables by Victor Hugo was written in 1862 and inspired by the political and social unrest during the 1832 June Rebellion in Paris, a specific time and place. In its preface Hugo portends its importance: “… so long as ignorance and misery remain on earth, books like this cannot be useless.”\n\nAnother example of art holding a cultural context is one of my favorite punk rock albums of all times, London Calling by the Clash, recorded in December of 1979. Do you know this album? LOVE IT! Throughout the album you can hear references to the nuclear age as well as rising unemployment, racial conflict, and drug use, especially in Great Britain.The concepts and lyrics are all completely historical, political, and social.\n\nThough Picasso, Les Misérable, and Punk Rock all seem to have a particular context, their art continues to speak to our souls today.\n\nToday, I’m thinking about the enduring art of John Coltrane’s album, A Love Supreme which is also rooted with a fascinating cultural context. I’m fascinated by this iconic, spiritual, and deeply moving piece of sonic art and I want to share it with you at a bright, open venue with the space and time to truly experience this immortal album in a way that I believe it was meant to be heard.\n\nBetter than at a nightclub, I believe this album is best suited to be absorbed at yoga and meditation studio. After all, this album is more like a meditation than a traditional jazz album. So, let’s meditate together to the spiritual sounds of A Love Supreme. And if you don’t live near Salt Lake City, you can Zoom in and catch it that way.\n\nChanging Times\n\nA Love Supreme was recorded in late 1964 and hit the record stores and airwaves in early 1965. And like I said, this album—this musical meditation, this masterpiece—didn’t happen in a vacuum. It’s fascinating to consider the events that were happening in America and around the world at this time because it gives a greater context understanding for the music and message of this album.\n\nWere you around in 1964–1965? What do you remember about the events of that era?\n\nI recently learned some cool perspectives around what was going down at the time that John Coltrane recorded A Love Supreme. Starting last week, I’ve started conducting in-person and Zoom interviews with clients and students to better learn about what I can do to better serve my students’ needs and so last week I met at a coffee shop with Bob and Cindy, friends and students who were both around 1964–1965, and by chance, not knowing that I was studying this era as it relates to A Love Supreme, they told me about what it was like to be a teenager/young adult at this time.\n\nBob, from New Jersey, told me that he graduated high school in 1965 and noticed a massive cultural shift in the summer of 1965. From his perspective, early in the year, when he graduated high school everyone had short hair and nobody smoked weed. People around him seem to live an Ozzie and Harriet lifestyle. But by the end of 65 he said that things changed drastically. What seemed like overnight, all the guys had long hair and smoking weed was suddenly a thing. With rock and roll firmly underway and Vietnam raging, the younger generation were definitely starting to think outside of the box. He also said that the parents of the younger generation had zero context nor preparation to cope with much less understand the massive shift in attitude of their kids.\n\nIn the same year that John Coltrane created and recorded A Love Supreme, Bob Dylan released his album named for its title track, “The Times They Are a-Changin’.” And whether it’s Dylan or Coltrane, analyzing the events of the day, it’s obvious that nothing could have been more of an understatement.\n\nCrossing the Threshold\n\n1964–65 marks a big threshold for the US and the world socially, artistically, and politically.\n\nA Love Supreme is a compassionate and enduring response to a massive change that was happening both personally in John Coltrane’s soul as well as throughout myriad domains in the world. In moments of huge change like this I think it would be easy for an artist or writer to be cynical, foreboding, or negative about the changes they are noticing. But recognizing the monumental shifts that are happening in the world, shifts that will change the world forever, John Coltrane instead chooses to help usher us over the threshold to a new era by laying bare his heart and exposing his deeply personal spiritual conviction, the result of his spiritual awakening, by reminding us that no matter what, we are all being carried over this threshold by a Love Supreme. Afterall, Coltrane made a deal with God: If he could kick heroin and booze, he would devote his life to sharing love and making people happy by the power of his music.\n\nIn a nutshell, this is what A Love Supreme is all about.\n\nContext\n\nOne way to gain a deeper insight, context, and appreciation for this important masterpiece of music is by understanding what was happening at the time that it was born. Have you ever researched the newspaper archives and read the current events on the day you were born? It’s a trip, right? Well how about we explore what was going on around the time that A Love Supreme was born.\n\nTo take a snapshot of 1964–5 when this album was recorded and released, I’ve made a list of notable events and lumped them into very general categories, Social/Political, Art And Culture, and Other. They aren’t necessary in either chronological order or in order of importance.\n\nCheck this out …\n\nSocial/Political\n\nJuly 2, Lyndon Johnson signs the Civil Rights act, abolishing racial segregation in the United States\n\nFebruary 3, Black and Puerto Rican groups in New York City boycott public schools.

On December 10 Martin Luther King Jr. is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, Norway. On December 11th iconic soul singer Sam Cooke is shot and killed. By January of 1965 A Love Supreme is released to the public. In February of 1965, Malcolm X is killed.\n\nJohn Coltrane dies July 17th 1967.\n\nWere you around in 64-65? What was your experience like during that time?\n\nUnderstanding the personal, social, and cultural context in which A Love Supreme was created helps us have a deeper connection and understanding to this music yet as a timeless piece of art, it remains as important a voice today, one that continues to shape our individual soul as well as the soul of our world.\n\nPlease come and experience this divine piece of music for yourself at my John Coltrane and A Love Supreme yoga and meditation experience and see what this music says to you today.\n\nThis experience will be perfect for both those who are either new or already familiar with yoga, meditation, and jazz. If you're familiar with yoga, meditation, John Coltrane, A Love Supreme, or jazz in general, come to experience it in a way that you likely never have before. If you’re new to any or all of it and are curious this will be a really cool introduction to all of it.\n\nAt this event, we’ll do some gentle movement then we will meditate while listening to the album. We’ll discuss, process, and integrate its feeling and message.\n\nPlus, I will play some live music on my sax along with one or two other musicians.\n\nYou don’t want to miss this!\n\nA Love Supreme\n\nYour One Message\n\nIf you could say ONE thing to the entire world, what would it be?\n\nWell, John Coltrane's big something to the world was clear and direct: \"All praise to God, who is a Love Supreme.\"\n\nToday, I want to explore the relationship between John Coltrane, Eastern thought, yoga and meditation the the lens of A Love Supreme. I want to explore why Coltrane's big something is so important in general, but more personally, why it's so vital to me.\n\nI also want to invite you to join me for a very unique and special listening experience, one that I'm confident JC himself would approve of.\n\nInfluencer\n\nTo begin, John Coltrane was a straight-up genius. He was one of, if not THE greatest saxophone players in jazz, as well as a bandleader and composer. He was a thinker, an intellectual, even mystical. Everybody from Bono to Radiohead, to...well, everyone, when asked about their primary inspirations in music, will usually put John Coltrane on their short list.\n\nWhy? What makes him such an important and influential musician, one we still talk about today, almost 60 years after his death?\n\nAs one of the most iconic and important figures in contemporary music, not just jazz, his music stretches the boundaries of harmonics, improvisation, and composition. But all these years later, his music continues to transcend musical genres and cultural boundaries.\n\nJohn Coltrane's chops were absolutely mind-blowing, but more than just flaunting his virtuosity on the sax, what makes his music so impactful, even to this day, is the fact that he wrote and played to be deeply felt. His music is nothing if not spiritual and connective. He intended for his music to be heard not only with ears but also with the heart and entire being. I think this is because his spirituality was the center of his life.\n\nSpirit\n\nAfter all, spirituality was in his blood. Literally, both of his grandfathers were ordained ministers of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. Yet, despite his upbringing in formalized religion, even from a very young age, he was and remained throughout his life constantly curious and searching. He did not adhere to any one religion. Rather, Coltrane openly embraced all religions who, he felt, at their core, shared an essential message of love.\n\nHe was constantly reading books about religions and spirituality and was no stranger to yoga and eastern thought. In fact, trombonist Curtis Fuller recalls the time he saw John Coltrane reading the Bhagavad Gita, then JC handed him the book \"Autobiography of a Yogi\" by Paramahansa Yogananda and told him to check it out. That was out there for jazz musicians.\n\nThe Spirit of Music\n\nFor Coltrane, music was not a deviation or distraction from the divine. In fact, he believed that the role of a musician was, at its essence, spiritual, akin to that of a prophet, someone who is given the gift of music for the sacred purpose of touching hearts and sharing a message of divine love through the medium of sound.\n\nIn 1957, after hitting rock bottom (read: Fired from Miles Davis' band for being addicted to drugs and alcohol—he even went off heroin cold turkey), John Coltrane had a spiritual awakening, which was the catalyst that drove him to create what is largely known as the most spiritual recording in jazz—what I believe to be his masterpiece—the album, A Love Supreme.\n\nHe recorded this album at the height of his famous quartet's powers. John Coltrane and his bandmates had developed such a connection and such harmony between their individual souls that they had created a united soul. This album is truly witnessing that unified soul singing to the divine. It's a musical miracle unfolding in real-time.\n\nFor me, listening to this album, it is difficult, if not impossible, not to feel a connection to the divine. I can't listen to this album as background music. It's too engaging. In fact, most of Coltrane's music is like this for me, but especially A Love Supreme. And even if you don't consider yourself very spiritual, at least listening to A Love Supreme, I think all can agree, is the sound of someone communing with the divine.\n\nMind, Heart, and Horn Blown\n\nGet this: Unlike any of the other 25 albums he created as a bandleader (25 in only 10 years, mind you), John Coltrane insisted on crafting every part of A Love Supreme down to the most minute detail. He even wrote the liner notes, a heartfelt message to the listener—to us.\n\nIn complete humility and sincerity, he writes, \"During the year 1957, I experienced, by the grace of God, a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer, fuller, more productive life. At that time, in gratitude, I humbly asked to be given the means and privilege to make others happy through music. I feel this has been granted through His grace... At this time, I would like to tell you that NO MATTER WHAT... IT IS WITH GOD. HE IS GRACIOUS AND MERCIFUL. HIS WAY IS IN LOVE, THROUGH WHICH WE ALL ARE. IT IS TRULY—A LOVE SUPREME.\"\n\nI get chills reading this. I mean, here's John Coltrane at his lowest point. He knows he's got gobs of talent and opportunities, but he is blowing it on booze and drugs. And as he's staring into the teeth of withdrawal, he literally sees the face of God and basically says, \"Look, I don't want drugs and booze. What I really want in this life is simply to share my gifts to make people happy.\" And God is like, \"Let this moment bring you to the light, John. Go. Blow your horn.\"\n\nBoom!\n\nFor John Coltrane, the effect of this awakening obliterates both any doubt about his purpose for being on the planet as well as the goodness of God, who is, well, A Love Supreme.\n\nThe suite starts with the ringing of a gong, and I translate that as the moment John Coltrane gets his heart and mind blown from this awakening of eternal love.\n\nWhat also touches me to the core about his message to us in the liner notes is how, in jazz, a world that epitomizes being too-cool-for-school, here he is, the KING of jazz, taking a right turn from hip and steering headlong into raw, vulnerable, and sincere.\n\nIt's so John Coltrane.\n\nVenue\n\nWhile most people associate jazz with smoky nightclubs, booze, and goateed hipsters, it is completely in line with the ethos of John Coltrane to transcend convention and experience his music in alternative settings. An invitation to get out of the nightclub could not be more clear than with A Love Supreme. And while I can attest that a smoky nightclub can be the perfect sanctuary for deeply spiritual experiences, especially when jazz is cutting the air, I would argue that a meditation hall or yoga studio could be an even more conducive venue to absorb the message and spirit of A Love Supreme.\n\nPlus, unlike most other jazz albums, this album is meant to be listened to from start to finish. There's not a wasted or unintentional note on the album. With such pure heart and emotion seeded into this music, it warrants an open and beautiful space with uncluttered time to offer it a deep listen and truly absorb the spirit exuding from it.\n\nMy Own Love Supreme\n\nIf you'll allow me to be vulnerable for a bit, I've also had an awakened moment where my own Love Supreme blew open my heart and mind. And without going into all the details, what I can tell you is that at that moment, I realized that I really have only one message: Love is EVERYTHING.\n\nI believe it's all of our greatest work on this planet to share love with the world in the form of our gifts. I believe that ANY way in which we love the world benefits the world.\n\nAs for me, I love the sax, I love John Coltrane's music, I love, love, love teaching yoga and meditation. So as a way of sharing my love with the world, I want to share all of these things with you at a special listening and meditation experience. This will be an opportunity to have the time and space to do a deep listen and meditate to the most spiritual piece of music in jazz. We'll read John Coltrane's words to us from the liner notes. This experience will also allow us to stretch and move our bodies a bit, as well as integrate, discuss, and journal about our experience.\n\nPlus, you may have heard me play the clarinet in class, but not this time. This time, I'll be blowing spirit through my sax.\n\nThis will be better than any sermon in church!\n\nSo please mark your calendar for the following:\n\nA Love Supreme: A Listening, Meditation, and Yoga Experience Set to the Most Spiritual Recording in Jazz.\n\nWhen: Sunday, April 7th, from 2–4 pm MDT\n\nWhere: Live, in person at Mosaic Yoga, 1991 South 1100 East, SLC, UT 84106. Available via Zoom as well.\n\nHow much: Suggested donation is $25–$50... or jazz vinyls.\n\nHow to register: Space is limited, so you'll need to register in advance, which you can do here.\n\nSo yeah, this listening experience is going to be quite different from how most people might listen to A Love Supreme, but it'll be so John Coltrane. I'm confident that he'd dig it.\n\nThere's so much about A Love Supreme that I want to share with you, about its message, history, and impact, that I'll be sending some other messages about this soon, so stay tuned.\n\nTobar Phádraig: St. Patrick's Well\n\nSt. Patrick’s Holy Well or Tobar Phádraig is a sacred site tucked away in the Maumturk mountains in the Connemara region of Galway, Ireland. Tobar Phádraig is an active pilgrimage site to this day and dates back to the fifth century and beyond.\n\nRead more\n\nLament Over Daylight Saving Time\n\nToday I want to discuss some of the benefits of Yoga Nidra, how rest and napping help rejuvenate you, and how crazy Daylight Saving Time is.\n\nIt’s Daylight Saving Time.\n\nYou know what’s weird? Time.\n\nYes, time.\n\nWhat’s also weird is that a helpful student chimed in to let me know that it’s not “Daylight Savings Time” but rather Daylight Saving (no s) Time. Good to know. Thanks!\n\nToday is one of the worst “time events” that happens twice a year.\n\nThat’s right. Today the U.S. switches to Daylight Saving Time. Well, everyone but Arizona and Hawaii. It’s nice to know that some states have kept their sanity.\n\nWhy Daylight Saving Time?!\n\nEvery organism on this planet has some sort of a rhythm and sleep cycle that is dependent upon the circadian rhythm, the natural rhythm of the daylight hours as dictated by the seasons. This rhythm directs cycles from when to sleep, when to eat, when to migrate, etc. It makes sense.\n\nWhat doesn’t make sense to me is the fact that as humans we are advanced enough to send Gobots to Mars 203 MILLION miles away and have them send pics back to us in real time as it rolls around collecting specimens and amusing itself yet we don’t have the smarts to keep to the natural rhythm that all organisms on this planet have been following since, oh, the beginning of life on this planet. Instead humans create a rhythm of life based not on the seasons or the natural impulses of our bodies, impulses that have been ingrained into our very DNA, but rather an artificial rhythm set to a clock that is designed to make us more productive and earn more money.\n\nIf that were not bad enough, then every 6 months we have to mess it up with adding or taking away Daylight Saving Time.\n\nI don’t need to have an opinion about it … but apparently I do.\n\nPutting Daylight Saving To Rest\n\nLuckily I’m not alone here. Thankfully some really smart people like Kenneth P. Wright Jr. Ph.D at the Sleep and Chronobiology lab at the University of Colorado Boulder thinks that for optimal physical, mental, and emotional health we should do away with Daylight Saving Time and stick with one standard time, for crying out loud. (If you care about a reference for Write’s work, whether or not I’m not making this up, you can click here.)\n\nBut until we all come to our senses and ditch Daylight Saving, those of us who are in the US are waking up an hour earlier today (except Arizona and Hawaii—starkly different places but who at least share a modicum of sanity).\n\nSolutions For Fatigue\n\nSo, here’s what I propose.\n\nMore napping.\n\nYes, more napping. I mean, I’m about a third the way into Scott Carney’s book about Dreams and I love how he is exploring the fact that throughout history and cultures, before the industrial revolution and electricity (light bulbs meant people could work longer), people would follow a more natural pattern of sleeping and sleep about 9 hours a night and would also take a siesta in the afternoon which follows the natural rhythms of a person’s body.\n\nThis is both sane and healthy.\n\nYou know, sleeping a solid 7–9 hours is normal and healthy. Then, it’s natural to start to wane mentally and energetically after about 8 hours of being awake, after lunch time, usually. This is the PERFECT time to take a bit of a nap. It’s not being lazy. It’s being healthy.\n\nYou don’t need to nap for long. In fact, 20–30 minutes will do absolute wonders for your overall wellness. Plus, you don’t even have to fall all the way asleep. You can just rest. It’s a revolution!\n\nMore Productive with Yoga Nidra\n\nBut what about being productive and all that?\n\nWell, turns out that when you follow this more natural cycle of sleep and allow yourself a sanctioned nap in the middle of the day, your brain functions even better, your emotions are more regulated and for those who care … YOU’RE EVEN MORE PRODUCTIVE.\n\nTo boot, you have better ideas, tend to think out of the box more often, and are generally more creative and able to learn. In fact, many of the outliers of art and industry— math and science geniuses, tech gurus, writers and artists—are ardent nappers.\n\nYep.\n\nAnd guess what? Listening to a Yoga Nidra recording serves this need for a mid-day nap PERFECTLY.\n\nSo as a way of compassionately responding to this insane biannual change to/from Daylight Savings, I’m offering you a free Yoga Nidra for deep relaxation.\n\nYou’re welcome.\n\nAnd if you’d like to make this resting and napping a regular part of your life, please join me for my weekly live, online Yoga Nidra class, happening at 9 am MDT. You can participate from the comfort of your own home (hell, your own bed). We’ll breath, move, talk a little, but then the main event will be me leading you through a luxurious Yoga Nidra practice where you get practice waking up to your True Being through the process of engineering that liminal state between waking and sleeping. That’s the Nidra state.\n\nTruly we are waking up with the yoga of sleep.\n\nEven if you can’t make it live, by registering, you’ll get the replay so you can do this Yoga Nidra practice any time you want, as often as you want.\n\nSo next week, as your dragging your butt around the office, sluggish and tired from the time change, tell your boss that at about 2 pm every day, you’ll have to excuse yourself, that you have an urgent 30 minute appointment which involves you lying down, closing your eyes, and napping your way to enlightenment.\n\nYour boss will thank you later.\n\nIf you need a note from your yoga teacher for permission, let me know.\n\nI’ll send one. Or better yet, just print this one =>\n\nHope to see you at the Live Online Yoga Nidra class and enjoy this free Yoga Nidra recording for Deep Relaxation.\n\nTogether, we can get through this nightmare that is Daylight Saving!\n\nMaker of All Things\n\nI believe the healing suggested in the title is the moment when one realizes that EVERYTHING is sacred, even those most difficult parts of life, the parts that make all of us some time or other flee for the sake of our small and precious lives.\n\nRead more\n\nHow Long Should A Yoga Nidra Practice Be, Anyway?\n\ntoday I thought I’d discuss the optimal lengths for a Yoga Nidra practice: What is too long and what is too short.\n\nRead more\n\nPerfect Not Perfect\n\nAlmost 9 years ago, I remember standing in front of my yoga class and expressing how utterly nervous I was . I wasn’t nervous about teaching yoga or being in front of people. I was shaking in my boots because at 39 years old, I was about to embark on perhaps the largest endeavor of my life, a massive journey, a challenge I’d never ever done before: becoming a dad.\n\nRead more\n\nChange Rooms In Your Mind For A Day\n\nYoga is the practice of joining all the different parts of ourselves as we explore what it means to be one. Sure, we are physical beings. We are also spiritual beings. We are mental, emotional, social beings. What fascinates me is the provocative idea of learning to live in a Both/And relationship with things that seem otherwise at odds, different, or opposite. Such a mindset and awareness for life opens us up to the truth of who we are as part of Source.\n\nAfter all, in the wild road trip of life, aren't we are all balancing paradox while sitting at the corner of Human and Being.\n\nRead more\n\nThe Yoga of The New Year\n\nThis is going to be your best year yet!\n\nAs you begin this new year, I invite you to muster the courage to dream big. Really big.\n\nWhat is something you’ve always wanted to do, become, or complete?\n\nYou have a Universe inside of you. You’re made of Source and as such, have the potential to accomplish and receive all things.\n\nYour spirit is indomitable. Your creativity, limitless. Don’t be afraid to imagine what is possible for you in 2024.\n\nThis is the imaginative and spiritual part of growing into the next version of yourself but it doesn’t stop there. Just dreaming, hoping, and scheming won’t get you there.\n\nNext, since we aren’t ONLY spiritual beings, since we are spirit married to physical, practical beings—give your dreams some legs by mapping out in realistic terms how to accomplish those dreams.\n\nRemember to start small knowing it will grow into something big.\n\nIf you want to run a marathon but haven’t been running in a while, have enough foresight to start by walking, then running/walking, then running. Commit to being in it for the long-term which means that there will be ups and downs.\n\nDon’t give up when things don’t work out the way you’d hoped. It’s just another chance for calibration and learning.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, it’s not about accomplishing your goal.\n\nNot really.\n\nIt’s about who you become in the process.\n\nAccomplishing your goal is just the happy byproduct.\n\nWhatever you dream up for 2024, having a regular meditation practice is of the first order. It clarifies, relaxes, and hones your body, mind, and spirit. It’s like the underlying framework for all other work to be done.\n\nWhy New Year's Resolutions Go Nowhere\n\nI’ve always hated New Year’s.\n\nAssociations:\n\nDrunk people\n\nThe cold\n\nFeeling tired\n\nWhat if there were a different way?\n\nNew Year’s resolutions too often devolve into premeditated disappointments and we go back to business as usual. Why is that? It’s because in order to make lasting change, we have to change our fundamental state of mind and stage of consciousness? Like Einstein said: “No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it.”\n\nRead more\n\nMeditation: One of the Most Important Little Big Things\n\nIt’s time to recommit to doing a little bit of essential self-care, the kind that helps you be at your best. Cuz we all know that it’s those little things that we do regularly for ourselves that eventually turn into the big things, the things that help us live the kind of lives we want to live and be the kind of people we need to be.\n\nRead more\n\nEach Other's Business: Scrooge and Yoga Nidra\n\nAt very least, exploring A Christmas Carol through the filter of Yoga Nidra may help us to appreciate this story anew and add a deeper insight and meaning into this well-worn story. It may help us to reflect upon our own awakening that can happen at any time of the year. And I think what I’m really angling at here is that this story illuminates so perfectly how the altered state of sleep can catalyze a massive change in spirit which can lift us from our habitual, broken way of being and help us wake up to the truth that we are all One, that veritably we are each other’s business.\n\nRead more"
