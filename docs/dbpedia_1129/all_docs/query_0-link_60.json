Also present: John R. Stark, executive director; Lucy A. Falcone, Jerry J. Jasinowski, and Larry Yuspeh, professional staff members; George D. Krumbhaar, Jr., minority counsel; and Michael J. Runde, administrative assistant. O p e n in g S t a t e m e n t of C h a ir s ia n H um phrey Chairman H u m p h re y . It’s my privilege, as chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, to call to order and convene this conference on the 80th anniversary of the Employment Act of 1946. Our fundamental purpose is to assess national economic policies on the occasion o f the 30th anniversary of the Employment Act of 1946. At the time of its passage it was considered to be the Magna Carta of the American economy. The Employment Act established the responsibility o f the Federal Government to maintain and to adopt economic policies conducive to a healthy economy for all of citizens. You may recall the charge of the Employment Act, calling upon the Government to adopt and effectuate such policies as to assure maximum employment, production, and income. Now, there have been good years under the act, with benefits to °ur citizens that none of us should want to minimize. But in recent y©ars our economic performance by almost any standard has been less than satisfactory. This national conference will focus on why that has been the case, and what we, as a Government, as an economy, and J® a nation can do about it. This national conference is the culmina­ tion of an inquiry into these questions that the Joint Economic Combegan many months ago. Vve have had a series of regional hearings, looking into the diffi­ culties and the challenge of our economy. We have traveled to ChiNew York, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Boston, and Fall River, Mass.; We nave traveled to these areas to listen to the people, and to listen (l) 2 to the elected representatives of the people. To listen to them about their economic situation and what the people in these localities felt could and should be done. Now we want to put these elements to­ gether here in the Nation’s capital, in this conference, to see what can be done to improve our situation—in simple language, to act. Today, we are especially fortunate to have the Vice President of the United States, Mr. Nelson A. Rockefeller, with us to open this national conference. Although it may not be too well known, let me just state here for the record that our Vice President, among his many accomplishments, also has a degree in economics from Dart­ mouth College. His exceptional record in public service since then has been one of consistent concern for economic and social progress, and consistent concern about dealing with the problems that afflict and affect our Nation. During his four terms as Governor of New York, he made major strides in improving the health, welfare, and employment of that great State. Vice President Rockefeller has always been a man of crea tiv ity and innovation; his leadership with the Commission for Critical Choices is but the most recent example. I am sure he is going to have an important message for us today* I am very pleased that he has accepted our invitation to open this conference, not only because of his enviable public record, not only because of his many qualifications for speaking to us on matters of economic policy, but I’m particularly pleased to welcome him and to introduce him because I consider him a very good friend and a good American. I present to you the Vice President. [Applause.] STATEMENT OF HON. NELSON A. ROCKEFELLER, VICE PRESIDENT OP THE UNITED STATES Vice President R o c k e fe lle r . Thank you very much. Senator and distinguished members of the Joint Economic Committee, I would first like to say that for me to be in any meeting, or any gathering with Senator Humphrey, on any occasion, is always a pleasure. He is <a very generous friend, as you could tell from his overly generous remarks. I ’m delighted to be with him here, and especially to be with him today because of his leading role in the program which this occasion is celebrating. So, for me this is both a personal pleasure, Senator Humphrey, to be with you and to join others in giving you important credit for haying been the inspiration back of this pro­ gram ; for your leadership during the history of the development of tms program, and in our confidence, as we look forward, in the role this joint committee can play in the future policy formulations for the strength and well-being of our Nation. . ,am delighted at the opportunity to be here before one of the most prestigious and influential bodies of the Congress, the Joint onoimc Committee, on the 30th anniversary of the legislation wtoch created your committee. Wavlre PaJs?'g,e the Employment Act of 1946 was an economic land­ mark and I particularly want to compliment the key arch itect of 3 that historic measure, Senator Hubert Humphrey. And I compliment all the other members who serve on this prestigious committee with him. There can be no better time than this bicentennial year to review the objectives of the Employment Act of 1946—to achieve maximum employment, production, and purchasing power for our Nation. The American Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution signified a major economic revolution as well as achieving our poli­ tical freedom. They opened the vast heart of this Nation to settle­ ment and development by free men and women seeking individual opportunity for a better life. The American enterprise system was by no means a totally private endeavor. Government has always played not only a significant but a crucial part in American economic life. Examples include agricul­ ture, the railroads, the automobile, and aviation industries. But the basic concept is to encourage the individual and private or voluntary enterprise—within a framework of law that sets the basic rules and seeks to protect the public interest. Yet, today, there are growing and legitimate claims that a dom­ inant central government in Washington is already placing impedi­ ments and nonproductive restraints upon individual activity, volun­ tary association and economic enterprise. We must ask, therefore, is there a threat to human liberties because economic freedoms are being restricted, initiative discouraged and individual creativity thwarted ? Human liberties are not possible under the statism that now exists in most of today’s world. The risk here in America, however, is not so much that we will take up the worship of the false gods of totalitarian ideologies, it is more that we may drift into statism as a reaction to corruption, and by governments progressively legis­ lating such overwhelming and detailed responsibilities for the order­ ing of society that liberty will be surrendered in the process. I made the following recommendations to regain our economic strength and vitality and the unrivalled opportunity which the American enterprise system offers our people: 1. That Government encourage labor and management to develop specific productivity programs in industry, encourage upgrading of skills, and facilitate adoption by labor and management of new and improved work rules and industrial processes. ^ 2. A conscious national commitment to retaining our leadership in science and technology through education, training, and a greater capital investment, public and private. 3. That our tax policy be reevaluated and that new legislation be enacted to lessen the impact of those provisions which deter capital formation and to provide new incentives for capital formation and an accelerated rate o f investment. 4. That Government and industry give top priority to plant mod­ ernization in their tax and investment policies. Enactment at this session of Congress of the Energy Independ­ ence Authority to get our economy rolling again, by stimulating the investment needed to assure that this country will have an adequate and dependable supply of energy. 6. That the Federal Government act to stimulate and protect the investment of a substantial portion of public and private pension funds in housing. . 7. That the executive and legislative branches of Government— (a) Establish clear objectives and criteria for regulation; the present regulatory p rocess; and (e) Determine the effects of regulation, intended and unintended. 8. Change, where necessary, existing laws, rules, and procedures to assure that they are promoting, not hindering, the attainment of our overall national objectives. We have all been through a difficult period—especially in term s of the political turmoil within the United States, but I am optimistic about the future. With the creativity and imagination of our free people, their sci­ entific and technological abilities, the managerial skills of the great American enterprise system, and the abundant resources within our borders, we can develop the needed new sources of energy, the needed raw materials or substitutes. And the same is true for food. The opportunities are unlimited, for cooperation to help other nations achieve comparable goals, in a world that grows smaller and more interdependent all the time. This can well prove to be the most exciting moment, with the greatest opportunities, in the history of civilized man. Confident of our heritage, with faith in the future, we can lead this country and all mankind to new heights of achievement and fulfillment. Ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion I would like to say that Sena­ tor Humphrey, he and his committee in my opinion hold the key to achieving and realizing these opportunities for our Nation, and that I am deeply honored and deeply privileged by the invitation and the opportunity of being here present on this occasion, this historic oc­ casion; and that I wish this committee, all who come before it, and all who participate in these discussions well because I think it is going to be a- very significant and historic moment in the develop­ ment of the kind of long-range planning which is essential to the realization of opportunities for the peoples of this Nation and the peoples of the world under the leadership of the greatest free nation that exists m this world of ours. ^°U l ery m?ck indeed, Senator, and I appreciate the op­ portunity you have given me in being here today, it was a pleasure.

S u m m ary o f R e g io n a l H e a r in g s hearing to *** bt C h a ir m a n H um phrey a *ew m^nutes to summarize the regional XZsloJQfBZpredlcateorbaseforwhatwehope 5 In Washington the condition of the economy is often evaluated on the basis of changes in key statistics. Members of Congress, the President refer to shifts in the consumer price index, the wholesale price index, or the unemployment rate when they debate the fate of proposed or existing economic policy. Now, by this statistical standard the U.S. economy has reached depths of historical proportion in 1975, numbers like 9 percent unemploj^ed, or an inflation rate that reached in 1 month as high as 12 percent, and 9 million jobless. These figures were often quoted to describe a recession the likes of which Americans have not known since the Great Depression. Now, the numbers told a story, to be sure, and its generally the story which comes out of Washington; but it was just a partial story. To speak, for example, only of a 9 percent national unemploy* ment rate, or 7.6 percent unemployment rate, whatever it now may be, is a sterile and misleading exercise. If an economic policymaker ignores the human factor in our economy’s condition, he will be unable to frame policies that are both effective and compassionate. Policies that are applied to a large sector of the American public move us uncomfortably close to the 18th century, when economics was known as the “ dismal science.” In order to go beyond the na­ tional statistics and to learn how the American people are coping with an economy in a difficult and critical condition, the members of the Joint Economic Committee journeyed, as I have indicated earlier, to the Nation’s major regions. We traveled to these areas to take this part of the Government out to the people, rather than merely asking for the people to come to Washington. We found that economic conditions in the cities that we visited were generally worse than the national averages. Might I say that the economic problems that afflict us today are very much urban related, and therefore in our discussion in these 2 days, much of what we have to say will be related to, and referred to the problems that afflict our core cities and our metropolitan areas. For example, in New York, Mayor Beame told us that, “ New York City’s 11.9 percent unemployment rate is expected to increase to 16 percent in the next 12 to 18 months.” In December of 1975 the unemployment rate in Massachusetts was 11.8, well above the national average at that time of 8.3; and the Boston unemployment rate was even worse, it was at 15 percent, which underscores what I said earlier, the relationship, the economic difficulties, and urban problems, or urban centers. Chicago’s jobless rate was similarly high, 11.9 percent, in Septem­ ber of last year. Now, these data demonstrate that national economic indicators all too often do not tell us all that we must know. We also heard from several economic experts, such as Mr. Ray Marshall in Atlanta, and Mr. Charles Killingsworth in Chicago, whose guidance we normally do not receive. These people as well as others convinced me, at least, that the country has many intelligent people who understand our economic problems, and who have con­ structive suggestions as to what to do about them. We have used such advice to propose changes to the Employment Act of 1946, through the Full Employment and Balanced Growth 6 Act of 1976, which Congressman Hawkins and I introduced in the House and the Senate just 2 days ago; and may I add that we have members of the committee here who are cosponsors. Senator Javits of New Yory is a cosponsor; Congressman Bolling is a a cosponsor; I ’m not sure, but I believe Congressman Long is a cosponsor, and there are others. It is a basic piece of proposed legislation designed to meet some of the deficiencies of the Employment Act of 1946. But surely the most moving and most useful testimony we heard came from the jobless themselves. I and other members of the com­ mittee heard firsthand what it means to be out of work for 6 months, a year, or longer. These were articulate, sensitive and able people who, despite their skills, have met with a series of rejections in re­ sponse to their search for a job. Their words tell a poignant story and are worthy of being reported here. Mrs. Annie Pearl Smith, a mother of seven, and an unemployed auto worker, testified in Atlanta: I want to work, I don’t want to be unemployed* I ’m on welfare, but I’d rather been working. I ’m able to work, and I want my children to realize that they have to work. Ruth Schaffner, an unemployed worker in Chicago told us: I’ve been unemployed for 1,240 hours. I’ve been a recipient of only one un­ employment compensation check. I want a job, I need a job. I can produce, I am akUled. . Now, probably Gregory Roy summed up best the conditions of the jobless in his testimony m Boston, he said: No one likes to hear the words, “sorry, we cannot use you” : Government has to be reeducated to the feet. He went on to say: Here we are, folks, we are out here. We have been looking for work for months and months—we want a job. I remember this young man very well, he was what yon might call * white-collar worker, and a capable and trained man, but was re­ jected repeatedly. Now, tnese are not the words of malingerers, one message that per­ meated the statements of all the unemployed who testified in the vari­ ous regions was—they want jobs. . ~ have long believed that to accept enormous numbers of jobless 181 ° waste, waste of skill, waste of energy and physi­ cal effort. The words of these unemployed workers have reenforced in me the sense of outrage and shame. addition to the massive waste that accompanies high unemploy™ .a\" ? learned that various kinds of social trauma result from as well. In each region citizens, the jobless, and unemployment’ the sooi* 1 costs “ socaated with high Ha*7®y Brenner— and I believe Mr. Brenner is studied thp'rel u ° s Hopkins University, a man who has S p h S e d ; relatlonshlP hrtween unemployment and social conditions, c a K a r o a T r o ? ^ tt^ l ^ de,1Ce« that trends “ d MtioBal lndithe genewl population, w H a tio f a8 well as °n **• * * * °*and ***** and physical health of on aggretoton other criminal behavior. 7 W e will be hearing from Mr. Brenner more in this conference. James Q. Wilson of Harvard testified in Boston that: It is quite likely that there is a relationship between the unemployment rate of teenagers and young adults on the one hand, and the rate of property crime committed by persons of this age group on the other hand. Doris Davis, the mayor of Compton, Calif., told us in Los Angeles: No one has dealt with the fact that we have had these levels of hardcore, continuous unemployment. The family has no models of employment where there are several generations on welfare and public assistance. Now, this testimony documented the way that prolonged high un­ employment undermines both the spirit of the unemployed and the society in which we live. This testimony documents the relationship of unemployment, particularly amongst the young, to alcoholism, to drug abuse, to mental disorders, to heart disease, to homicide, and other serious matters. W e all bear these costs, all of us, whether it be in the form of high health care expenses, or higher crime rates. And since the number of jobless is so high, the aggregate impact on society is great. Business and labor leaders have also talked to us, and they have expressed their concern over the unemployment situation. Hugh O’Malley of the Small Business Service Bureau, testifying in Fall River, Mass.— Congresswoman Heckler brought her subcommittee to her district— Mr. O’Malley testified: The high unemployment rates over the last few years are largely responsible for the high rate of business bankruptcies. A major Federal job program is essential for the health of the small business community. A Mr. Jack Spiegel, the director of the Chicago Shoemakers’ Union had a terse but pointed comment, “I f you don’t send us help in jobs, you had better send us troops.” State and local government representatives explained how the un­ employment situation in their regions was threatening their govern­ ments’ abilities to provide public services. John Crozier, the director of the Massachusetts Division of Em­ ployment Security explained: During the 5 years ending on December 31, 1975, the employer-contributed balance to the Massachusetts Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund fell from a $374 miUion surplus to a $119 million deficit. By 1976, we estimate, that Massachusetts employers will owe the Federal Government $258 million. Mayor Richard Fulton of Nashville, Tenn., testified in Atlanta on the need for a national manpower policy. He said to us: We are helpless to provide the unemployed with a work experience due to the absence of a national manpower policy, which would take into account emer­ gencies such as the present one. Mayor Maynard Jackson of Atlanta bluntly told the members of the Joint Economic Committee that, “The crucial economic issue is jobs.” He said: I tell you now, my No. 1 frustration as mayor is to see people not begging for welfare—although they need it; not begging for food—although they are hun­ gry ; not begging for money— although they are broke, but begging for a job. e need the help of Congress in this issue. The testimony says it clearly, our cities are suffering badly from high and prolonged unemployment t Our journey now ends where it began, this conference is the cul­ mination of the Joint Economic Committee hearings across the coun­ try. We have found a unique way to retain the able guidance of those who testified at our regional hearings. On each of our panels during these 2 days regional witnesses will act as discussants after each panel member lias presented his views and the committee members have had an opportunity to ask questions. The four discussants for the panel will be provided their chance to question either the panelists, or the committee members. In this way our full employment debate will gain a new dimension which is almost always absent in congressional meetings. Also, we can be assured that because of the participation of these regional witnesses, this conference will build upon the views that we heard when we met in the various regions of the United States. With these regional meetings and this national conference the Joint Economic Committee has demonstrated how the Federal Gov­ ernment can practice human economics. As Lucy Benson, a former national president of the League of Women Voters said in our Bos­ ton hearings, “ I believe it is important to talk directly about people and their needs, far too often people get lost in numbers.” I believe that the record of the Joint Economic Committee’s re­ gional meetings will serve as a guide to the human side of the key economic indicators. Now, I have listened to that human side, and it is a moving story. I do not believe that we can afford to deny it, or ignore it; m fact, we must accept it and to build on it in terms of public policy. Now, at this time, we will have our panel. May I take the privilege of introducing our panel, and asking our panel to proceed, Ths first panelist is Kenneth Gibson, mayor of Newark, N.J. Mr, Mayor, we welcome you, we are very honored to have you. He is representing the U.S. Conference of Mayors. I believe Mayor Gibson a president and will be the incoming president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

KENNETH GIBSON, MAYOR OF NEWARK, N.J., AND VICE PRESIDENT, U.S. CONFERENCE OF MAYORS Mayor G i b s o n . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Members of the committee, I appreciate the opportunity to appear here today as mayor of the city of Newark and vice president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. First, I would like to commend the distinguished Senator and the cosponsors for the reintroduction of S. 50, the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1976. We are indeed pleased with the re­ draft of this important legislation and are anxious to lend our sup­ port to its enactment. The cities of America are struggling to retain the progress they have achieved over the past decade in meeting the needs of their populations. The prolonged era of economic stagnation which now confronts this Nation threatens to erase their hard-fought gains and very directly endangers the viability of urban areas. The impact of joblessness and lost income, human despair, and foregone oppor­ tunity has been especially concentrated in cities. The cavalier atti­ tudes of the administration officials toward projections of prolonged recession belies a frightening disregard for the enormous social and economic costs of their misguided policies. In order to present constructive alternatives to these policies, the U.S. Conference of Mayors urges the Congress to develop a positive program for achieving full employment. We view this as an immedi­ ate Federal priority. The growing acceptance of previously intolerable levels of unemployment by members of the administration clearly sig­ nals danger for America. The young, the minorities, the women, the workers whose jobs have been lost to machines and foreign competition niust not be cast aside in the vast junkpile to be fed only with food stamps and supported by welfare. Jobs are the heart of the issue. Holding on the present course will not only keep us headed toward the eventual financial collapse of 10 local government, but toward massive upheavals in our social and economic systems. . . The questions and solutions involved are highly technical and com­ plex For this reason, we intend today to merely outline the broad areas which we, as mayors, see as critical to restoring the economy to full employment. As policies in this area are refined, we shall con­ tinue to trust the critical importance of local, as well ^as, national economic well being. As a nation, we have been preoccupied too often with the macroeconomic picture -and have given far too little atten­ tion to addressing the problems of local and regional areas which suffer severely even in the best of times. The essential elements of our program for restoring economic vitality include: 1. COUNTERCYCLICAL ASSISTANCE TO STATE A N D LOCAL GOVERNM ENTS Such a program is essential to assure that the use of Federal fiscal policies to stimulate the economy is not negated by tax increases and expenditure reductions that local governments are mandated to enact when their revenues decline. Almost one-half of the potential stimu­ lus to the economy in the Tax Reduction Act of 1975 was not realized because of tax hikes, layoffs, and expenditure cutbacks made by State and local governments. 2 . TAXES The recently enacted tax-reduction compromise goes only part of the way towards giving the economy adequate stimulus to sustain a reasonable recovery. Attempts by the administration to tie tax re­ ductions to tax cuts avoid economic rationality, and according to congressional budget efforts, would serve to actually depress the economy during 1976. A restructuring of the tax system to remove the distortions caused by inflation and promote private capital formation is necessary in order to restore equity and strengthen the business investment foun­ dation of the economy. The President and the Congress must follow the mandate of the Employment Act of 1946 and aggressively use the Federal fiscal process to promote full employment objectives. The time is now for this country to adopt a national policy of full employment. 3. JOBS j prolonged levels of joblessness we face must be immediately addressed by the creation of 1 million public service jobs and a pro­ gram of accelerated public works in depressed areas. The need for these programs is twofold. First, the tax cuts which have been enacted will not have sufficient stimulus to adequately re^ceunemployment levels, as I said previously. becond, large amounts of public investments are needed to provide tu retf f e ^ S d 1^ '1 the 1<mg neSlected economic infrastruc- 11 As an important part of this effort, it is critical that a complete reexamination of Federal income transfer programs be conducted. Too often, we see Federal programs spending billions to subsidize unemployment when those very same billions could be used to create productive jobs. Americans want the dignity of meaningful work, not a fat unemployment insurance check and we, in the cities, have plently of work that needs to be done. In addition to the antirecession measures, an ongoing public service employment effort is needed to combat structural unemployment. 4. C A PITA L ALLOCATION Geographic areas of the country and various sectors of the econ­ omy that have been hardest hit by previous Federal insensitivity and current economic disruption are in desperate need of capital resources to rebuild. Enormous capital investments will be needed over the next decade in both the private and public sectors to support needed growth, increased productivity levels, meet the cost of environmental protection, build and rebuild our transportation system, assure an adequate supply of quality housing at reasonable costs, and provide for our energy needs. We must insure that these demands are met and that urban areas have the tools they need to vigorously compete for new development. 5 . LO N G -T E R M POLICY CONSIDERATIONS In order to achieve and sustain the goal of full employment, Fed­ eral policies in a number of critical areas will have to be developed and coordinated. There is a desperate need for rational economic planning, capable of establishing priorities and guiding Federal policies. As capital and natural resources become increasingly scarce and Federal programs and agencies increasingly numerous, the need for coordinated action targeted to specific goals becomes essential. We can no longer afford to have fiscal policies contradicted by mone­ tary policies, housing programs undermined by interest rates, and what little energy policies we have, canceled out by what little trans­ portation policies we have. These anomalies have caused Americans to lose faith and respect for all levels of Government. As elected officials, we recognize that the failure of the Federal Government to meet its basic responsibili­ ties in protecting the jobs and incomes of Americans and its growing inability to effectively and efficiently conduct the operations have severely shaken the confidence in Government in general. , In conclusion, this great Nation, which has been beset by mount­ ing economic problems must vigorously pursue solutions, solutions to the problems of unemployment at a time when many seek to re­ flect on a history of achievements in this, our Bicentennial year. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Chairman H u m p h re y . Mayor Gibson, w e are most grateful to y ou . a ou have been a witness with us before, and we welcome your testi­ mony on behalf of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

JORDAN, JR., EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUE Mr. Jord an . Mr, Chairman, members of the committee, I want to extend my congratulations to this committee for this creative and innovative approach to the process of public policymaking, and the Xational Urban League is pleased to be represented. I want to apologize in advance, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I have to catch a 12 :lf> plane, and therefore, when I leave it’s not because the discussion is heated, but because I have to catch a plane. Chairman H u m p h rey. We’ll let you get out of here. We’ll get to you before you leave. Mr. Jord an . Thank you. The 30 years since passage of the Employment Act o f 1946 have seen vast changes in our world, significant alterations in the way in which economic problems are viewed, and also the partial confirma­ tion of the fears of the framers of the Employment Act of 1946. Many people believe that the coming of peace might mean a re­ turn to breadlines, soup kitchens and mass unemployment. Thus, the impetus for passage of the Employment Act, and for subsequent Fed­ eral programs in manpower and in economic development came from the fear of renewed depression, a fear that ate away at the insides of policymakers and workers alike. Now, after 30 years, at least part of that fear has come true. De- spite the juggling of official figures, the barrage of optimistic forecasts, and the assurances that the downturn is temporary, our Nation suflered its highest unemployment levels since the Great Depression last year. And despite some marginal improvement in the first months fe v e k o f 7 o b l i s S . arS ° ° ndem ned to liv e w ith un conscion ably h ig h j ° W <ssness i? n ot spread equ ally a m on g o u r p o p u la bv novflt+v r ^ cau E o f t h l rated ? n ^ 86 w^ os® jiv es alread y are con stricted opportunities are alrea d y u n equ al b e- nomic mnrmnoiv S ^ raci^ discrimination, and on those whose ecoM\" 1 d e e p e n e d b e c “ ” se o f ” ®tio n a l Ererv wl-fwlr that this is no passing phenomenon.

Back in 1946, black and white unemployment was roughly proportionate; today black unemployment is more than double that of white and has been for the past two decades. On social grounds, this reflects a dangerous divisiveness in our society. On economic grounds it reflects a tremendous waste of hu­ man resources. On budgetary grounds, it reflects a gross misallocation of national priorities. For every million unemployed, it costs the Federal Government some $16 billion in lost taxes and in necessary support payments. Is it not wiser to spend on job creation and on manpower training that will bring productive jobs to the unemployed? The National Urban League, through its labor education advance­ ment program has spent $22 million since 1967 on counseling, train­ ing and job-finding for minority individuals in the construction trades. That was all Federal money contracted for by the League. Some would say that was “ social spending”—Federal tax dollars diverted to a nonprofit agency for social programs. I say it was not social spending. It was an investment whose return would be re­ garded by envy by anyone on Wall Street. Just look at what that relatively small amount spread over 9 years yielded: About 16,000 people found jobs through the program. Many of them are now in nontraditional jobs and in construction jobs, once barred to blacks. In 1975, those 16,000 persons earned over $131 million in salaries; since 1967, they earned a cumulative $380 million in salaries. Since 1967, the Federal Government has received back in taxes on those earnings over $90 million. In 1975 alone, taxes on the program’s participants totaled over $31 million, or $9 million more than the Government’s investment in the whole program for over 9 years. All of this is terribly important because the League’s program and other programs can only deal with a very tiny percentage of the huge number of people in need of economic security. It is my contention that the extent of poverty and joblessness in our land is grossly underestimated and that the Nation must be alerted to the real dimensions of the problem. Officially, 7.2 million people are jobless, 1.3 million of them black. But in addition, there were about 5 million people, 1*4 million of them black who were no longer counted (as part of the labor force because they were not actively looking for jobs they knew did not exist. Some three million people, 600,000 of them black, were working part time because they could not find the full time jobs they wanted and needed. And 2 million workers, 400,000 of them black, worked full time for wages that amounted to less than the official poverty level. And two-thirds of those persons were family heads. So, talk of 7 million jobless is fantasy. There are today some 17 Million people either unemployed or subemployed. And black people have suffered proportionately greater economic damage. Of the black unemployed, 35 percent have been out of work 14 for 15 weeks or more, and that represents a rise from 31 percent in the third quarter of 1975. Of the black unemployed, 21 percent have been out of work tor 27 weeks or more, and that too represents a rise from 18 percent in the third quarter of 1975. Black female teenage unemployment too is up, from 36.7 percent in the third quarter of 1975, to 38.2 percent at year’s end. These are, of course, figures applicable only to the of­ ficially defined unemployment, and we have already demonstrated how that is an understatement. The overall 12.9 percent unemploy­ ment rate for black people in America, Mr. Chairman, translates into a 24.6 percent unofficial rate, or one in every four black workers out of work. , . . Such figures impose social as well as economic costs this Nation can ill afford. The cold figures on supportive expenditures, loss o f tax revenues, loss of potential productivity, and other elements of economic calculation tell only part of the story. There are also hidden social costs and unbearable personal costs as well. One such hidden cost is crime. Earlier this week, the New York Times headlined a page-1 story, “ Crime Rose in Richer Neighbor­ hoods.” Now, this does not mean that rich folk have taken to burglar­ izing their neighbors; it means that people who are poor, who are out of work, who see no prospects, will find any means to survive, even if it means breaking laws. Another social and economic cost imposed unnecessarily on our society is the inability of our economy to make places for young people, especially black youngsters. Our society has thrown millions of youngsters on the scrap heap. It seems willing to accept crime, supportive expenses and other economic costs, rather than invest in increasing productive capacity of individuals in the economy. This is a bitter situation, one that may find us reaping a harvest of social discontent and internal class and race divisions that could endanger our Nation. What is to be done? I would hope that this distinguished body will go on record in support of a national full employment policy that guarantees a de­ cent job at a decent wage to all Americans able to work. I envision a three-pronged program to achieve this goal. It would include: . A' Incentives to private industry to recruit, train, and hire the jobless. 2. For the Federal Government to create a, public works program along the lines of the old WPA that helped sustain millions during the depression of the 1930?s. , Finally, a vastly expanded public service employment program that would help build the pressing need for public services while assuring employment opportunities for millions of people. A national full employment policy along the lines I have outlined here would make unemployment a thing of the past, turn revenueconsumers into producers, generate tax income to pay for itself, and remove the curse of ]oblessness from the land. Mr* (J ia^rman? that the joint committee can help to pro^sab.^Congress and the administration toward adoption of these 15 Thank you very much. Chairman H u m p h r e y . We are very grateful to you, Mr. Jordan, not only for your statement, but for your statistical evidence to support your contentions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Jordan follows:] P repared S t a t e m e n t op V ernon E. J o r d a n , J r. The thirty years since passage of the Employment Act of 1946 have seen vast changes in our world, significant alterations in the way in which economic problems are viewed, and also the partial confirmation of the fears of the framers of the Act. In 1946 our nation was disbanding an immense military machine, sending miUions of men and women back into civilian life, and at the same time, closing down war plants and defense factories. Behind all this loomed the spectre of the Great Depression that was ended by the coming of World War Two. Many people believed that the coming of peace might mean a return to bread­ lines, soup kitchens and mass unemployment. Thus, the impetus for passage of the Employment Act, and for subsequent federal programs in manpower and in economic development came from the fear of renewed Depression, a fear that ate away at the insides of policymakers and workers alike. Now, after thirty years, at least part of that fear has come true. Despite the juggling of official figures, the barrage of optimistic forecasts, and *the assur­ ances that the downturn is temporary, our nation suffered its highest unemploy­ ment levels since the Great Depression last year. And despite some marginal improvement in the first months of this year, it appears condemned to live with unconscionably high levels of joblessness. Further, this joblessness is not spread equally among our population. It is concentrated on those who lives already are constricted by poverty, on those whose opportunities are already unequal because of the effects of racial dis­ crimination, and on those whose economic marginality is confirmed and deepened because of national misplaced priorities. I believe we must understand that this is no passing phenomenon. Every post­ war recession has been followed by higher unemployment. Every post-war reces­ sion has claimed its permanent victims—people unable to re-enter the produc­ tive labor force. And in the course of time our concepts of what constitutes full employment have changed. Not very long ago three percent unemployment was the magic number. Then it moved up a notch to four percent. Then five. Now every indica­ tion points to acceptance of a range of 6 to T percent as nationally acceptable. The rationale for this lies in the myth propounded by the so-called “ Phillips Curve” that ties inflation rates to employment rates. Recent experience strongly suggests that this explanation for inflation be scrapped. Economists have made devastating technical analyses that kick the props out from under this formula­ tion, and in the past five years we've suffered both high inflation and high unemployment. Another rationale lies in the myth that the federal government has too large an economic role, and that the federal debt must be restrained, thus discourfederal spending for social and economic programs. This too is a destructive myth. Back in 1946, when the Employment Act was Passed, the federal debt actually was larger than the gross national product. Jhis year it is expected to be only about 30 percent of the GNP. Federal spending too, is relatively modest in comparison with the GNP. * rom 1953 to 1974 it held steady at about twenty percent of GNP. The slight nse since 1973 is directly attributable to recession-related costs of manpower ^r?f^ams» unemployment compensation and welfare. it is clear then that the rationalizations for accepting high unemployment are without foundation. The Administration's budget proposals and its callous plans o cut social services while maintaining high unemployment should not be snared by the Congress. They would only worsen and make permanent what should be just a temporary tragic chapter in our history* . tbis is all the more urgent because of the differential impact economic troubles have on those least able to shoulder them. Back in 1946 black and 16 white unemployment was roughly proportional; today black unemployment is more than double that for whites and has been for the past two decades. On social ground, this reflects a dangerous divisiveness in our society. On economic grounds it reflects a tremendous waste of human resources. On budg­ etary grounds, it reflects a gross misallocation of national priorities. The fact is that our nation has poured countless billions into waging war, arming for defense and in encouraging capital-intensive development that de­ mands skills we have not imparted to all of our labor force. It has been estimated that since 1946 the military has absorbed an amount equal to almost two-thirds the value o f everything man-made in our nation. Had just a small portion of that immense sum been diverted to domestic pro­ ductive enterprise that creates more jobs per dollar than do military expendi­ tures, we would have no need for a Conference such as this. Military-related expenditures help account for the deterioration of our cities, as tax dollars are drained from older urban areas of the northeast and diverted to military installations and plans in the so-called sunbelt states. In 1974, these sunbelt states collected about $13 billion more from Washington than they paid in federal taxes while nine northern states had a net loss of $20 billion. New York City's recent fiscal crisis was brought about by many factors, but surely one of the most important must be the fact that it paid out billions more in federal taxes than it received in federal expenditures. At a time when the City's teachers are being dismissed and its university system dismantled, New York will pay over $1 billion earmarked for the Pentagon. This is not an argument against adequate defense spending; rather it is an argument for keeping our economy on an even keel and not encouraging through fiscal policies the deterioration of our large urban centers whose populations are disproportionately black and minority. Our policy seems to be to spare nothing in military spending and to clamp down on social investment while spending whatever minimum is necessary to maintain the economically marginal population. Thus some $40 billion will go into unemployment compensation programs to provide some help to the victims of unemployment. Is it not wiser to spend positively to make people productive rather than such negative spending that only confirms their dependency ? For every million unemployed it costs the federal government some $16 bil­ lion in lost taxes and in necessary support payments. Is it not wiser to spend on job-creation and on manpower training that will bring productive jobs to the unemployed? Part of the problem is the stigma social programs have as “ spending” pro­ grams. They should more accurately be seen as investment programs in our nation's future and in the futures of the individuals that make up our work force. The National Urban League, through its Labor Education Advancement Pro­ gram has spent $22 million since 1967 on counseling, training and job-finding for minority individuals in the construction trades. That was all federal money contracted for by the League. Some would say that was “ social spending” — federal tax dollars diverted to a non-profit agency for social programs. It was *** investment whose return would be regarded with envy by anyone on Wall Street yielded 3°°^ what that relatively small amount spread over nine years About 16,000 people found jobs through the program, many of them are now in non-traditionai jobs and in construction jobs once barred to blacks. in 1975 those persons earned over $131 million in salaries; since 1967 they earned a cumulative $380 million. ' 19^ thf„?ederal government has received back in taxes on those earnmgs, over $90 million. for^rer^nlne ^eara p o S ^ J l 4Le program’s Participants totalled over $31 million, government’s investment in the whole program Si tuation for lfc teaches 08 a number of imsocia1 spending actually is investment that I f recouped. Second, that people dismissed as being unemployable are tiv^ th®.training and the skills to enable them to hold produc­ tive skilled craft jobs. Finally, it teaches us that our national priorities have- 17 been distorted; that if so small an investment could yield so large a human and financial return, then a large investment would yield proportionately greater results. All of this is terribly important because the Urban League’s LEAP Program and other of our programs can only deal with a very tiny percentage of the huge number of people in need o f economic security. It is my contention that the extent of poverty and joblessness in our land is grossly underestimated and that the nation must be alerted to the real dimensions of the problem. Bad as seven percent unemployment is, it is understated. Bad as seven mil­ lion jobless are, the figure is again, grossly understated. The official figures are misleading in that they do not include discouraged workers, people working part-time because they can’t find full-time work, and full-time workers who are earning less than poverty-level income. The poverty level itself is misleading, for while it has been increased over the years, those small increases have not matched the rise in the cost of living. Thus we are under the impression that some 24 million people live in poverty, when a more realistic poverty level would show some 40 million fellow-Americans who are poor. The National Urban League has examined the unreleased official statistics on employment, and we have discovered the situation to be far worse than publicly acknowledged. Officially, 7.2 million people are jobless, 1.3 million of them black. But in addition, there were about five million people, one-and-a-quarter million of them black, who were no longer counted as part of the labor force because they were not actively looking for jobs they knew did not exist. Some three million people, 600,000 of them black, were working part-time because they could not find the full-time jobs they wanted and needed. And two million workers, 400,000 of them black, worked full-time for wages that amounted to less than official poverty level. And two-thirds of those person?! were family heads. So talk of seven million jobless is fantasy. There are today some 17 million people either unemployed or sub-employed. And black people have suffered proportionately greater economic damage. Of the black unemployed, 35 percent have been out of work for 15 weeks or more, and that represents a rise from 31 percent in the third quarter of 1975. Of the black unemployed, 21 percent have been out of work for 27 weeks or more, and that too, represents a rise from 18 percent in the third quarter of 1975. Black female teenage unemployment too is up, from 36.7 percent in the 3rd quarter of 1975, to 38.2 percent at year’s end. These are, of course, figures applicable only to the officially defined unemployed, and we have already dem­ onstrated how that is an understatement The overall 12.9 percent unemploy­ ment rate for blacks translates into a 24.6 percent unofficial rate, or one in every four black workers. . Such figures impose social as well as economic costs this nation can ill afford. The cold figures on supportive expenditures, loss of tax revenues, loss of poten­ tial productivity, and other elements of economic calculation tell only part o f the story. There are also hidden social costs and unbearable personal costs as well. One such hidden cost is crime. Earlier this week, the New York Times head­ lined a page-one story, “ Crime Rose in Richer Neighborhoods.” Now this does not mean that rich folk have taken to burglarizing their neighbors; it means that people who are poor, who are out of work, who see no prospects, will find any means to survive, even if it means breaking laws. I f you do not offer a man Productive employment and self-respect and the opportunity to earn his way, he will seize whatever means are available to him, regardless of legality. Thereis a direct correlation between joblessness, especially teenage unemployment, Poverty, and other forms o f economic deprivation, and the rising crime rate. Another social and economic cost imposed unnecessarily on our society is the inability of our economy to make places for young people, especially black youngsters. In many o f our cities two-thirds of black teenagers are jobless, and that situation has been with us since before the 1973-76 recession. Thus, there very real danger that an entire generation will come to adulthood without h id in g a job, without ever learning the skills that will make possible a P oductive future. In effect our society has thrown millions of youngsters on the* 18 scrap heap. It seems willing to accept crime, supportive expenses, and other economic costs rather than invest in increasing productive capacity of indi­ viduals and the economy. Beyond this, our society will have to deal with a cynicism, distrust and bitter­ ness engendered by its broken promises. Black people have seen their economic gains in both income and employment rolled back to levels of a decade ago. White people have played the game, entered the consumer society, mortgaged their futures, and then been tossed out of their jobs because Washington fears inflation or higher federal spending. This is a bitter situation, one that may find us reaping a harvest of social discontent and internal class and race divisions that could endanger our nation. What is to be done? I would hope that this distinguished body will go on record in support of a national full employment policy that guarantees a decent job at a decent wage to all Americans able to work. I envision a three-pronged program to achieve this goal. It would include: Incentives to private industry to recruit, train and hire the jobless. The private sector can’t do the job alone, but public policies that make it less attrative for a business to hire more workers compounds the difficulty. Federal regulations, subsidies and tax incentives should all be directed at increasing the private sector’s ability to create jobs. A second step would be for the federal government to create a public works program along the lines of the old WPA that helped sustain millions during the Depression of the 1930s. Those public works projects lined our country with roads, with bridges, with schoolhouses and other public facilities still in use today. A similar program in the ’70s would not only create jobs, but it would provide a new generation of vitally-needed houses, transportation facilities and other public works our nation needs. Finally, a vastly expanded public service employment program would help fill the pressing needs for public services while assuring employment opportuni­ ties for millions of people. Some years ago a Presidential commission deter­ mined that public sector manpower needs in conservation, safety, education and health could accommodate some five million new jobs, offering an opportunity to sharply improve necessary public services. A national full employment policy along the lines I have outlined here would make unemployment a thing of the past, turn revenue-consumers into producers, generate tax income to pay for itself, and remove the curse of joblessness from the land. Such a policy would not, by itself, end poverty, for there would remain those who are unable to work, who are incapable of working and thus in need of assistance that would enable them to maintain a decent living standard. The welfare system is supposed to do this, but its faults are too numerous to detail here. Everyone agrees that the welfare system is a mess, that it discourages work, penalizes the poor, and encourages dependency. It is an inconsistent patchwork of bureaucratic interference in people’s lives, wildly varying benefit scales, and costly administrative charges. But its worst fault is that it doesn’t work. The welfare system for the poor is not nearly as efficient as the welfare system composed of tax loopholes and subsidies for the wealthy. That’s why there is growing support fo r a welfare reform program that assures a liveable minimum income while relieving state and local governments of the increasing burden o f providing fo r the needs of the pootr. I believe the most efficient reform would be a universal refundable credit income tax that would extend a basic annual grant, or tax credit, to all. That grant would be taxable income, so that the poor would keep all o f it, the nearpoor would keep some of it, and middle and upper income families would return it all in taxes. This system would be financed by removal of most o f today’s tax deductions and loopholes and the imposition of a flat tax rate on all income. Such a system would limit subsidies to those in need, and not, as at present, to the better-off* It would supplement the incomes o f working families who cannot make ends meet. And because the tax credit would be automatic and universal, it would bring big savings in administrative costs and reduce abuses so prevalent in the present system. 19 In fact, we have the beginnings of such a system today. Families whose in­ comes are below $4,000 now get $400 cash payment from the IRS. Those be­ tween $4,000 and $8,000 get lesser amounts. The tax credit route to welfare reform has attracted increasing support in­ cluding key elements within the Administration. Support for federal take-over of welfare has also mounted, with several governors urging such action. It is clear that some such reform will come sooner or later, and the national nature of the problem, the continuing economic crisis confronting low-income citizens and the growing disenchantment with the present malfunctioning system all argue for sweeping reforms as soon as possible. My proposals for a national full employment policy and for a universal re­ fundable credit income tax are pro-work, pro-human dignity proposals. They would increase national productivity, stimulate the economy, end unemployment and lessen poverty. And they would go a long way toward removing the eco­ nomic causes of racial antagonism. It is my hope that the Joint Committee can help to move the Congress and the Administration toward adoption of these proposals. I fully understand the political realities of our time, although I cannot understand why the white poor and the white jobless have not yet joined with black people to support the reforms that would benefit both groups. I know it is difficult to achieve such widespread structural reforms, but I have faith that it can be done. I have faith that our people can act in their own enlightened self-interest to finally end unemployment's curse. I have faith that our recent history of economic drift and hardship will engender changes along the lines I have outlined. And I have a faith in my country that should not be out of place in this Bicentennial year. It is a faith I would like to share with you in the words of my predecessor at the Urban League, Whitney Young: “I do have faith in America—not so much in a sudden upsurge of morality nor in a new surge toward a greater patriotism—but I believe in the intrinsic intelligence of Americans. I do not believe that we forever need to be con­ fronted by tragedy or crises in order to act. I believe that the evidence is clear. I believe that we as a people will not wait to be embarrassed or pushed by events, into a posture o f decency. I believe that America has the strength to do what is right because it is right. I am convinced that given a kind of col­ lective wisdom and sensitivity, Americans today can be persuaded to act cre­ atively and imaginatively to make democracy work. This is my hope, this is my dream, this is my faith.” Chairman H u m p h re y . Bishop Rausch, we are looking forward your testimony. to STATEMENT 0E BISHOP JAMES S. RATISCH, GENERAL SECRETARY, U.S. CATHOLIC CONFERENCE Bishop R a u s c h . Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, dis­ tinguished panelists, and guests. I am Bishop James S. Rausch, general secretary of the U.S. Catholic Conference, the chief administrative officer of the national level action agency of the Roman Catholic Bishops of the United States. I am pleased and honored to have the opportunity to participate in this historic and innovative conference on full employment. I intend this morning to only summarize the prepared statement that has been prepared for the committee, that I ask to be placed in the record. Chairman H u m p h re y . W e w ill include all portions of statements were not read, or presented as part of the original testimony. Thank you. Bishop R a u s c h . My brief reflections this morning are based on a major policy statement on economic issues passed unanimously by 20 the C ath olic bishops o f th is country in N ovem ber. I h ave m ade copies o f th is statem ent as w ell, and I presum e those w ill also ap p ear in the record. Chairman H u m p h rey. They will be printed a lo n g with you r t0 B^hop R a u sc h . My comments today will not focus on the technical workings of the economy, or detailed remedies for relief of economic distress. Rather, I wish to discuss the human, social, and even moral dimensions of economic life; what economic forces mean for fam­ ilies and individuals. We cannot forget that the economic interaction of labor, industry, and Government has concrete implications far beyond the market place, the board room, the halls of G ov ern m en t and the stock exchange. Behind the jumble of statistics and the rise and fall of economic indicators lie human lives and individual tragedies. Speaking from my own particular religious perspective, I am re­ lying on a long tradition of teaching and concern for economic jus­ tice and human dignity. We believe that economic policy must re­ flect broad values of social justice and human rights. In our November statement, the bishops drew on traditional Cath­ olic social teaching and laid out several principles of economic life. I wish to share several of them with you. 1. Economic activity should be governed by justice and be carried out within the limits of morality. It must serve people’s needs. 2. The right to have a share of earthly goods sufficient for oneself and one’s family belongs to everyone. 3. Economic prosperity is to be assessed not so much from the sum total of goods and wealth possessed by the Nation as from the dis­ tribution of goods among the people according to norms of justice. 4. Opportunities to work must be provided for those who are able and willing to work. Every person has the right to useful employ­ ment, to just wages, and to adequate assistance in cases of real need. 5. Economic development must not be left to the sole judgment of a few persons or groups possessing excessive economic power, or to the political community alone. On the contrary, at every level the largest possible number of people should have an active share in directing that development. 6. A just and equitable system of taxation requires assessment ac­ cording to ability to pay. A related and controversial matter is the appropriate role of Goveconomic life of its citizens. In their recent statement the bishop said: ‘Government must play a role in the economic actm ty of its#citizens. Indeed, it should promote in a suitable manner ihe production of a sufficient supply of material goods. Moreover, it should safeguard the rights of all citizens, and help them find oppor­ tunities for employment.” Government has the responsibility of coordinating, regulating and complementing our free market system. It should operate in those aims where private enterprise is unable or unwilling to do so, or \"where the nature of the problems require public participation. Onainnan H u m p h re y . Bishop, can I interrupt you for just a moment. Senator Javits and I will have to go down and oast a vote. 21 it takes us about 5 minutes. But we want you to proceed, and Con­ gressman Bolling will chair the hearing while I ’m away. You have to forgive the interruption, the work of the Senate goes on. We will be back with you immediately. Bishop R a u s c h . In addition, Government policies should promote full employment, production and purchasing power. As these comments make clear, it is our view that the formulation and implementation of economic policy cannot be left solely to tech­ nicians, interest groups or market forces. Our economic life is gov­ erned by its own laws and realities, yet it must be the aim of private economic activity and public policy to so direct and manage economic forces so that the public welfare will be served. Our economic policy must fundamentally serve the public interest, the common good and the needs of people. That is why broad public debate and dialog over economic policy is essential and why this con­ ference and the hearings that preceded it are so important. Despite recent gains in employment, official measures of joblessness indicate that some form of unemployment presently afflicts more than 11 million Americans. In 1975, almost one-third of the American people were touched by the reality of joblessness within their own family. While we pray that the recovery will grow in strength and in­ tensity, the recent improvement in unemployment levels represents only relative progress. The fact that more than 10 million Americans are unemployed, far from being an encouraging sign, is only a fur­ ther indication of the depth and damage of the worst recession since the 1930’s. It cannot be cause for rejoicing, nor an excuse for inaction. I wish now to discuss the tremendous human and social costs of long-term unemployment. The experience of prolonged joblessness dramatically affects a person’s perception of self and his or her hopes for the future. It cannot fail to influence personal attitudes and be­ havior toward society. Although we do not believe that a person’s worth and value is de­ termined by his or her economic productivity, in our culture, persons without employment lose a critical measure of their place in society and a source of individual fulfillment. They perceive that society has no productive role for them, or that there is no contribution they can make. As a result, alienation and loss of confidence intensifies and oftentimes leads to increased anxiety and antisocial behavior. Mr. Harvey Brenner, who is one of our discussants here today, has thoroughly documented the direct and startling relationship be­ tween economic distress and increased mental illness, cardiovascular disease, and prenatal deaths. We also know that high levels of unem­ ployment frequently leads to greater alcoholism, drug abuse, child abuse and crime. High unemployment also contributes to rising social and racial tensions. In a situation of job scarcity, one individual or group can obtain and keep employment only at the expense of another. Threat­ ened by loss of a livelihood, workers too often look for scapegoats ^nd may blame minorities, aliens, women or young people, with senous consequences for intergroup relationships. 22 Of special concern to us is the n egative impact of the loss of income* and employment on personal and family relationships. It can destroy hopes and dreams, it can erode family life, interfere with the healthy rearing of children and greatly increase feelings of insecurity and inadequacy. It can result in the loss of the home itself. It places in­ tense strains on family and community life. In short, long-term unemployment threatens basic human dignity and lowers the quality of life for all those affected. There is also a spiritual aspect to this issue. What happens to a nation that begins to accept the notion that it cannot use the talents and labor of all its people ? What happens to us as a pople as we watch families which have made the slow and painful climb up the economic ladder, only to be pushed down once again into poverty and dependence by the loss of a job? As a society, can we accept the notion that some will have jobs and income while others will be told to wait a few years and to subsist on welfare in the interim? What does it mean when our leaders say there is no way in the foreseeable future to harness the idleness of so many for work on vital social needs such as housing and transpor­ tation? It seems to me that those questions pose profound issues of national purpose and identity. It is our position that the current levels of unemployment are unacceptable and these human, social and spiritual costs are intoler­ able. As the Catholic Bishops declared last November: “ Fundamen­ tally, our Nation must provide jobs for those who can and should work and a decent income for those who cannot. An effective national commitment to full employment is needed to protect the basic human right to useful employment for all Americans. It ought to guarantee, through appropriate mechanisms, that no one seeking work be denied an opportunity to earn a livelihood. Full employment is the founda­ tion of a just economic policy; it should not be sacrificed for other political and economic gains. Just 4 days ago, we testified in basic support for H.R. 50, the Full Ji-mployment and Balanced Growth Act of 1976, and we expressed the view that it provides the most comprehensive and useful approach W Te^ P yrn?nt n?w the Congress. \\Ve believe this legislation, as it continues to be refined and im­ proved, will provide through its comprehensive planning process an job creation programs, a workable and practical way to achieve ^ rr'P*°.ynient. By stimulating the private sector and providing ^ <Ta job reservoirs. it will insure that no one will be denied an opportunity to earn a livelihood. *_• eJLup,port Public service jobs for persons who are unable to obwithin the private sector. We specifically reject l• «. ? 'vor W1thin the public sector is necessarily less produccannot use£^ t^®n employment in private industry. We a nuMif c*,Jrr no, *hat a nurses aide in a general hospital or how W rehabilitating homes in our cities is sometor who Jot r>!^1Ve* ° r ^Htobutes less than those in the private seco 7 o u r ^ l^ iV i*r iW0^ \\ n a fact°ry. Clearly, the vast majority the maTor^vMio1 / u. ^e employed in the private sector, and major focus of economic policy ought to be efforts to stimulate 23 and increase private employment. However, we should not exclude the essential role of public employment at times of major joblessness. We believe it is far better to spend funds to create and maintain em­ ployment than to require families to subsist on unemployment com­ pensation and other forms of assistance with the economic and human consequences we have described. We are encouraged by the recent decline in the rate of inflation. This trend is welcome, although additional strong measures against inflation must be taken. We urge that policymakers seriously consider a voluntary program of wage and price guidelines, involving the articulation of specific wage and price targets and vigorous action to achieve voluntary compliance on the part of business and labor. In addition, greater efforts to increase real competition and oppose monopolistic practices ought to be undertaken to strengthen the competitive forces in our economy. The American Bishops oppose efforts to control inflation through high idleness of workers. They said in their recent statement: There are those who insist that we must tolerate high levels of unemployment for some, in order to avoid ruinous inflation for all. Although we are deeply con­ cerned about inflation, we reject such a policy as not grounded in justice. PoUcymakers should seek and use measures to combat inflation which do not rely upon high rates of joblessness. For many o f our fellow citizens, the major pro­ tection against inflation is a decent job at decent wages. This is an important moment in the economic and political history of our land. As we emerge from the deepest recession since the De­ pression of the thirties, we face a basic choice concerning national economic and social policy. We can harness the concern and experi­ ence of our people to enact fundamental reforms in our economic life or we can return to old policies and programs which offer little hope of achieving greater social and economic justice. I do not be­ lieve we can continue to neglect the realities of poverty, poor distri­ bution of financial resources and economic power, inequitable taxa­ tion, and high levels of unemployment and subemployment. We call on our national leadership to act boldly, to enact an effec­ tive and workable national commitment to full employment. To establish a compassionate and fair system which will guarantee an adequate income to those who are unable to work. In the words of our statement of last November: We ask the private and public sectors to join together to plan and provide better for our future, to promote fairness in taxation, to halt the destructive impact o f inflation, and to distribute more evenly the burdens and opportuni­ ties of our society. A central question before the Nation in this bicentennial year is the economy—massive unemployment, continuing inflation and wide­ spread poverty. We believe that this Nation has the compassion, wis­ dom and resources to meet the basic needs of its people and to harness their talents and energy. Our economy is the richest and strongestAin the world. The task before us is to harness that strength and affluence so that all our people will be served more effectively. Thank you. 24 Representative B o llin g [presiding]. Thank you very much, Bishop. Rausch, and thank you for your excellent statement on behalf of the U .S. Catholic Conference. [The prepared statement of Bishop Rausch and a statement of the' Catholic Bishops of the United States follow:] P repared St a t e m e n t of B is h o p J a m e s S. R au sch INTRODUCTION Mr. Chairman, Members of the Joint Economic Committe, Distinguished Panelists and Guests. I am Bishop James S. Rausch, General Secretary of the United States Cath­ olic Conference, the chief administrative officer of the national-level action, agency of the Roman Catholic Bishops of the United States. I am pleased and honored to have the opportunity to participate in this his­ toric and innovative Conference on Full Employment. In Chicago and Atlanta, the U.S. CathoUc Conference was represented through the testimony of Bishop McNicholas and Archbishop Donnellan, at your regional hearings which have led to this important meeting on the 30th Anniversary of the passage of the Employment Act of 1946. My brief reflections this morning are based on a major policy statement on economic issues passed unanimously by the Catholic Bishops of this country. I have made copies of this statement available to the committee and I ask that the text of the statement appear in the record. In addition, my testimony today is based in part on several detailed studies of unemployment, inflation and related issues prepared for our use by six dis­ tinguished economists. They include: Dr. Paul Samuelson, Dr. Leon Keyserling, Dr. Robert Eisner, Dr. Lester Thorow, Dr. Daniel Larkins, and Dr. Helen Ginsberg. The National Conference of CathoUc Bishops also conducted a three-day hearing on economic issues last faU as part of our preparation of a five year plan of action on social justice. My comments today will not focus on the technical workings of the economy or detailed remedies for relief of economic distress. Rather, I wish to discuss the human, social and even moral dimensions of economic life ; what economic forces mean for families and individuals. We cannot forget that the economic interaction of labor, industry and government has concrete implications far beyond the market place, the board room, the haUs of government and the stock exchanges. Behind the jumble of statistics and the rise and fall of economic indicators lie human lives and individual tragedies. In these remarks, I wish: 1) to outline a few general principles that we be­ lieve ought to guide economic life; 2 ) to discuss some o f the dehumanizing aspects of unemployment; 3) to express our position on full employment legis­ lation ; and 4) to consider very briefly the impact of inflation in our economy. ECONOMIC PURPOSE AND PUBLIC POLICY Speaking from my own particular religious perspective, I am relying on a long tradition of teaching and concern for economic justice and human dignity. We beUeye that economic policy must reflect broad values of social justice and human rights. The search for economic justice is an essential extension o f the long and continuing struggles for basic civil rights and human dignity. Already we are seeing some o f the progress of the last decade washed away In the wake of recession and massive unemployment. In onr November statement, the Bishops drew on traditional Catholic social' teaching and laid out several basic principles o f economic Hfe. I wish to share several o f them with you : “ (a) Economic activity should be governed by justice and be carried out within the limits o f morality. It must serve people’s needs. “ ( 6 ) The right to have a share of earthly good sufficient for oneself and one's family belongs to everyone. u(c) Economic prosperity is to be assessed not so much from the sum total of goods and wealth possessed by the nation as from the distribution o f goods among the people according to norms of justice. 25 u{&) Opportunities to work must be provided for those who are able and willing to work. Every person has the right to useful employment, to just wages, and to adequate assistance in cases of real need. “ (e) Economic development must not be left to the sole judgment of a few persons or groups possessing excessive economic power, or to the political com­ munity alone. On the contrary, at every level the largest possible number of people should have an active share in directing that development “ (/ ) A just and equitable system of taxation requires assessment according to ability to pay.” A related and controversial matter is the appropriate role of government in the economic life of its citizens. In their recent statement the Bishops said: “Government must play a role in the economic activity of its citizens. Indeed, it should promote in a suitable manner the production of a sufficient supply of material goods. Moreover, it should safeguard the rights of all citizens, and help them find opportunities for employment.” Government has the responsibility of coordinating, regulating and comple­ menting our free market system. It should operate in ttiose areas where pri­ vate enterprise is unable or unwilling to do so or where the nature of the problems require public participation. In addition, government policies should pro­ mote full employment, production and purchasing power. As these comments make clear, it is our view that the formulation and im­ plementation of economic policy cannot be left solely to technicians, interest groups or market forces. Our economic life is governed by its own laws and realities, yet it must be the aim of private economic activity and public policy to so direct and manage economic forces to serve the public welfare. Our system of private incentive and freedom is strong, yet continued neglect of the basic issues of poverty, fairness o f taxation and inequitable distribution of wealth and economic power threaten to weaken our economic and political system. Economic policy must fundamentally serve the public interest, the common good and the needs of people. That is why broad public debate and dialogue over economic policy is essential and why this conference and the hearings that preceded it are so important. The joint Economic Committee has done a commendable job in stimulating this kind of broad public discussion through its many activities. u nem ploym ent: cubrent s it u a t io n Despite recent gains in employment, official measures of joblessness indicate that seven million Americans are presently unemployed. In addition, 3 million persons have part-time jobs although they desire full-time work and almost one million additional persons have dropped out of the labor force in frustration. This means some form of unemployment presently afflicts more than 11 million Americans. In 1075, almost one-third of the American people were touched by the reality of joblessness within their own family. These overall figures mask the seriously inequitable distribution o f unem­ ployment. Racial and ethnic minorities, blue collar workers, women, and young people experience far higher levels o f joblessness than the rest of our society. Unemployment actually increased in February for minority teenagers, and minorities generally, and one out of five young people of all races are still w*thout employment. . 4 While we pray that the recovery will grow in strength and Intensity, the Jecent improvement in unemployment levels represents only relative progress. The fact that more than 10 million Americans are unemployed, far from being an encouraging sign, is only a further indication o f the depth and damage of the worst recession since the 1930’s. It cannot be cause for rejoicing, nor an excuse for inaction. „ , „ _ The reality is that we have had a serious unemployment problem for decades, exacerbated by recurrent recession. The implementation of the Employment Act of 1946, whose 30th anniversary we commemorate in these hearings, has not fulfilled the law’s broad social and economic purposes nor has it peen an ef­ fective remedy for joblessness. We are presently falling far short of the max­ imum employment, production and purchasing power” it sought to promote. We nave alternated between boom and bust cycles. This instability Pjace? a cmt strain on families, individuals- and our society. Businesses and individuals cannot make reasonable plans for the future. Even in good times, we are often nhappy f or of wkat may lie ahead. 26 H U M A N COSTS OF UNEMPLOYMENT Other witnesses will dicuss in detail the substantial economic costs of high unemployment in the form of lost production, lost revenues and greatly in­ creased costs for unemployment compensation and other forms o f assistance. I wish to discuss the tremendous human and social costs of long-term unem­ ployment. The experience of prolonged joblessness dramatically affects a per­ son’s perception of self and his or her hopes for the future. It cannot fail to influence personal attitudes and behavior toward society. Although we do not believe that a person’s worth and value is determined by his or her economic productivity, in our culture, persons without employment lose a critical measure of their place in society and a source of individual ful­ fillment. They perceive that society has no productive role for them or that there is no contribution they can make. As a result, alienation and loss of con­ fidence intensifies and lends to increased anxiety and anti-social behavior. Dr. Harvey Brenner, who is one of our discussants today, has thoroughly documented the direct and startling relationship between economic distress and increased mental illness, cardiovascular disease, and pre-natal deaths. We also know that high levels of unemployment frequently leads to greater alcoholism, drug abuse, child abuse and crime. High unemployment also contributes to rising social and racial tensions. In a situation of job scarcity, one individual or group can obtain and keep em­ ployment only at the expense of another. Threatened by loss of a livelihood, workers too often look for scapegoats and may blame minorities, aliens, women or young people, with serious consequences for intergroup relationships. Of special concern to us is the negative impact o f the loss of income and employment on personal and family relationships. It can destroy hopes and dreams, erode family life, interfere with the healthy rearing of children and greatly increase feelings of insecurity and inadequacy. It can result in the loss of the home itself. It places intense strains on family and community life. In short, long-term unemployment threatens basic human dignity and lowers the quality of life for many Americans. In the years to come we will be pay­ ing a great economic and social price for our continuing tolerance o f high levels of joblessness. There is also a spiritual aspect to this issue. What happens to a nation that begins to accept the notion that it cannot use the talents and labor of all its people? What happens to us as a people as we watch families which have made the slow and painful climb up the economic ladder, only to be pushed down once again into poverty and dependence by the loss of a job? As a society, can we accept the notion that some will have jobs and income while others will be told to wait a few years and to subsist on welfare in the interim? What does it mean when our leaders say there is no way in the foreseeable future to harness the idleness of so many for work on vital social needs such as housing and transportation? These questions pose profound issues of national purpose and identity. These social, human and spiritual dimensions of unemployment deserve equal consideration in deUberation on future economic policy. NATIONAL COMMITMENT TO FULL EMH0 TMEKT It is our position that the current levels of unemployment are unacceptable and these human, social and spiritual costs are intolerable. As the CathoUc Bishops declared last November: “Fundamentally, our nation must provide jobs for those who can and should work and a decent income for those who cannot. An effective national commitment to full employment is needed to pro­ tect the basic human right to useful employment for all Americans. It ought to guarantee, through appropriate mechanisms, that no one seeking work would be denied an opportunity to earn a livelihood. Full employment is the foundation of a Just economic policy; it should not be sacrificed for other political and economic goals.” Just four days ago Bishop Eugene Marino, representing the U.S. Catholic Conference, testified before a subcommittee of the United States House of Rep­ resentative? in \"basic support for H.R. 50, the Foil Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1076, and expressed the view that It provides the most camp** hensive and useful approach to foil employment now before Congress/* 27 We believe this legislation, as it continues to be refined and improved, will provide through its comprehensive planning process and job creation programs, a workable and practical way to achieve full employment. By stimulating the private sector and providing for federal job reservoirs it will ensure that no one will be denied an opportunity to earn a livelihood. As we testified on Monday, we support public service jobs for persons who are unable to obtain employment within the private sector. We specifically re­ ject claims that work within the public sector is necessarily less productive, efficient or useful than employment in private industry. The kinds of jobs out­ lined in H.R. 50 would help to meet the vital needs of our people in housing, transportation, education, recreation and health care. We cannot accept the notion that a nurses aide in a general hospital or a public service employee rehabilitating homes in our cities is somehow less productive or contributes less than those in the private sector who sell products or work in a factory. Clearly, the vast majority of our people will and should be employed in the private sector and the major focus of economic policy ought to be efforts to stimulate and increase private employment. However, we should not exclude the essen­ tial role of public employment at times of major joblessness. We believe it is far better to spend funds to create and maintain employment than to require families to subsist on unemployment compensation and other forms of assist­ ance with the economic and human consequences we have described. INFLATION A second major economic problem facing our people is inflation which weak­ ens our economic stability and erodes the economic security of our citizens. The impact of inflation is most severe on the very poor and those who live on fixed incomes, particularly on the elderly. In 1973 and 1974, most American families experienced an actual decline in real income as a result of the combined im­ pact of recession and high rates of inflation. We are encouraged by the recent decline in the rate of inflation. In 1975 con­ sumer prices rose 7% compared to 12.2% in 1974. Most projections for the com­ ing year indicate an additional slight decline in inflation. This trend is welcome although additional strong measures against inflation must be taken. We urge that policy-makers ser"
