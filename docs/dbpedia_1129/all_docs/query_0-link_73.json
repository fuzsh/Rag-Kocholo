        "text": "This article is about the Jedi Master.\n\nYou may be looking for other uses of \"Obi-Wan,\" \"Kenobi,\" \"Ben,\" or \"Negotiator\".\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi was a legendary Force-sensitive human male Jedi Master who served on the Jedi High Council during the final years of the Republic Era. As a High Jedi General, Kenobi served in the Grand Army of the Republic that fought against the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars, and was nicknamed \"the Negotiator.\" Kenobi, however, was forced into exile as a result of the Great Jedi Purge initiated by the Republic's own clone troopers when Republic Supreme Chancellor, secretly Darth Sidious, implemented Order 66. As a mentor, Kenobi was responsible for training two members of the Skywalker family, Anakin and Luke Skywalker, both of whom served in turn as his Padawan in the ways of the Force.\n\nKenobi was born on the planet Stewjon in 57 BBY. He was Force-sensitive, and therefore taken from his family and inducted into the Jedi Order as a child. Raised in the Jedi Grand Temple on the planet Coruscant, Kenobi was assigned to Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. In 32 BBY, Kenobi attained the rank of Jedi Knight by defeating the Sith Lord Darth Maul during the Invasion of Naboo. He also chose to train Anakin Skywalker—the prophesied Chosen One who was destined to destroy the Sith and restore balance to the Force—having promised Jinn who died in the lightsaber duel against Maul.\n\nWith the advent of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, Kenobi adopted the military rank of High Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic, and was given command of the Open Circle Fleet, the Third Systems Army, and the 7th Sky Corps. Clone Marshal Commander Cody served as his second-in-command throughout the galaxy-wide conflict, with their forces achieving multiple victories over the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In the midst of the war, his old enemy Maul re-emerged into galactic affairs, bent on revenge against Kenobi for his debilitating defeat decades prior. Though they clashed in heated duels on multiple occasions, Maul failed to end Kenobi's life or cripple his spirit, despite murdering his former love, Satine Kryze, Duchess of Mandalore.\n\nIn 19 BBY, Kenobi killed the Separatist Supreme Martial Commander, General Grievous, during the Battle of Utapau, effectively ending the Clone Wars. He later survived the initial onslaught of the Great Jedi Purge against the Jedi Order, which resulted from the machinations of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. After discovering that Skywalker had turned to the dark side of the Force, becoming Sidious' Sith apprentice under the name of Darth Vader, Kenobi defeated his former Padawan on Mustafar and exiled himself to the Outer Rim planet Tatooine as the Galactic Empire rose to power. Adopting a hermit lifestyle as \"Ben Kenobi,\" he watched over Vader's and Senator Padmé Amidala's son, Luke.\n\nTen years later, Kenobi left exile to rescue Leia Organa, Luke's twin sister, and was pursued by the Empire's Inquisitorius and Vader himself. Later, Kenobi was hunted down once again by Maul, whom he finally slew to protect the young Luke. Kenobi began the boy's Jedi training in 0 BBY, and soon after encountered Vader aboard the first Death Star, where he sacrificed himself to ensure that Luke and his allies escaped from the Sith Lord. In death, Kenobi became one with the Force which allowed him to continue guiding Luke throughout the Galactic Civil War. In 4 ABY, Kenobi reunited with his former student, Anakin Skywalker, who died destroying his Sith Master in order to save his son. Kenobi was remembered as a legendary Jedi Master during the rise of the New Republic; Ben Solo, the son of Luke's twin sister, Princess Leia Organa, was named after Kenobi. Solo's turn to the dark side left Luke disillusioned with the Jedi Order's legacy, and he held Kenobi responsible for Anakin's transformation into Vader. However, Luke's faith would eventually be restored with the aid of Darth Sidious's granddaughter Rey, to whom Kenobi would lend his voice and strength in a final battle and victory against her resurrected ancestor on Exegol in 35 ABY.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi was born on the planet Stewjon in 57 BBY.[2] Despite being very young when he left his family, he still had glimpses of his father's hands, his mother's shawl and he remembered a baby he believed to be his brother although he barely remembered him.[9]\n\nJoining the Jedi Order\n\nWhen Kenobi was discovered to be Force-sensitive, he was taken from his homeworld to the Jedi Temple on the Core Worlds planet Coruscant to be trained as a Jedi[5] within the first six months of his life.[1][5] In the Jedi crèche he was placed with other Jedi younglings[18] in the Kybuck Clan[11] during his early years, including his friends Gehren[11] and Prie.[18] Kenobi received basic Initiate training alongside his peers in the Jedi Order's Temple[10] and began training in several simple Force techniques by the age of three[18] in 54 BBY.[19]\n\nKenobi studied in the ways of the Force[1] and Jedi traditions[20] under Grand Master Yoda,[1] eventually coming to respect him and the Jedi Council greatly.[18] He also received instruction in the art of lightsaber combat from Jedi Master Cin Drallig[21] in the basic lightsaber forms and techniques.[18] At some point before he was selected as a Padawan, Kenobi attended a class centered around meditation.[10] Unlike how he acted as he got older,[22] Kenobi, during his days as a youngling, gained a reputation for breaking rules and having a rebellious nature,[18] resulting in very few Masters who were willing to train the boy as their Padawan.[22] To curb Kenobi's behavior, Yoda searched for a teacher for Kenobi that had unorthodox methods, which would mold the student into rebelling by being dutiful.[18]\n\nQui-Gon Jinn's Padawan\n\nInitial endeavors\n\nAround 44 BBY, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn chose Kenobi as his Padawan learner when he was thirteen years old. During his apprenticeship he became friends with Jape, a fellow Padawan who he kept correspondence with, and also maintained contact with crèche-mate Prie[18] and the Mon Calamari Bant Eerin.[24] In their first months together, Jinn attempted to adapt his teaching methods to suit Kenobi's strengths, but felt he failed to do so adequately.[18] At some point during his training, Kenobi constructed his first lightsaber, modeled after Jinn's lightsaber hilt style and his own personality.[25] As the pair struggled to establish a workable affinity, the Master continued to train his Padawan in the basic cadences of lightsaber combat, preventing him from picking a specialty.[18] Jinn was proud of his apprentice's skills, and sparred with him in training sessions[10] while at the Temple between missions. Kenobi, in turn, spent a significant amount of time in the training dojos to hone the techniques taught to him.[18]\n\nIn their lessons, Jinn taught Kenobi that there was a strength and nobility in restraint.[26] As time passed, Kenobi's demeanor shifted to become more serious and respectful of the Council, in contrast to Jinn's usual way of approaching situations based on his instincts in the present. Both carried differing philosophies on focusing on the future versus the present, and interpreted the Force in varying ways. Despite their differences, Kenobi strived to be a good student, and supported his Master's hobbies regarding ancient Jedi prophecy research. To Kenobi's chagrin, the majority of his free time in the Temple was consumed by gathering information from the Jedi Archives and the holocron of prophecy under the watchful eye of the Jedi Master librarian Jocasta Nu. Over time, he learned the language Old Alderaanian, which many of the holocron's prophecies were written in. As an escape from the workload, Kenobi played rounds of[18] the game[5] dejarik in the lower levels of Coruscant in the evenings after finishing his Master's research requests.[18]\n\nEarly travels and visit to Kashyyyk\n\nThe pair's continuing training issues were discussed with Jedi Councilors Depa Billaba and Mace Windu in an attempt to find a remedy, without success. At some point during his time as a Padawan, Kenobi and Jinn visited a fortress on[18] the planet[5] Lah'mu, the world Alderaan's royal palace, and[18] the planets[5] Ryloth and Gatalenta.[18] While training, he became acquainted with the Jedi trainee Siri Tachi and developed some feelings for her, but refrained from acting on them.[20] Not long after Kenobi became Jinn's Padawan, he was eager to prove himself on a mission, but when he and Jinn were set to leave on one, his Master was nowhere to be found. Feeling angry by his master's abandonment, Kenobi decided to set off on the mission to the planet Lenahra alone. While he was there, he encountered a group of teenagers and datachips hidden on the world by the Jedi Orla Jareni long before his visit.[28] He met a Besalisk named Dexter Jettster, who became a close friend.[29]\n\nDuring his training, Kenobi traveled to[27] the planet[5] Kashyyyk with his Master during the Life Day holiday. Jinn used the trip to teach his student about the Wookiee's way of life and harmony, and how it related to their own connection to the Force. The festivities slightly overwhelmed Kenobi, though he took the lessons to heart, and met one of Jinn's acquaintances, the Wookiee Brennonn. However, their gathering was interrupted by Trandoshans who captured several Wookiees, intending to use them in a hunt for sport. Despite Kenobi's best efforts, Jinn was snared in a net as well and taken away.[27]\n\nThough held captive, Jinn believed that his Padawan would rescue him from the Trandoshan hunters. Kenobi, though reluctant to put any more Wookiees in danger, formulated a plan with Brennonn to break the imprisoned individuals free. He proceeded to surrender himself to the Trandoshans, claiming that as a simple student, he stood no chance against them. While conversing with the hunters' leader, Kenobi subtly used the Force to open the cage holding Jinn. Once both Jedi brandished their lightsabers, several other Wookiees rushed to the scene and assisted in setting their friends free. After the situation was settled, the Wookiees opted to leave the group in peace, citing Life Day as reason to pursue a resolution without violence. When back at the festivities area, Kenobi remained confused as to why Jinn did not break himself free. However, the Master informed him that it was intended as a learning experience, and to gain insight from Wookiee perspectives on life.[30]\n\nProtecting Satine Kryze\n\nSometime between the years 41 BBY and 39 BBY, Kenobi and Jinn spent a year on the planet Mandalore protecting Duchess Satine Kryze from insurgents who were threatening her world. Bounty hunters were sent after them, forcing them to live as fugitives, never knowing what the next day would bring them.[33] The mission forced them to work and fight together as a team, resulting in them forging a close bond.[34]\n\nKryze called Kenobi by the nickname \"Ben.\"[29] During that time, they had an incident with a swarm of venom-mites on the terrestrial object Draboon, where Kenobi carried Kryze to safety.[33] However, he fell and dropped the Duchess, who then acquired a scar as a result. Kenobi fell in love with Satine during his stay on Mandalore, but despite his feelings toward her, he continued with his training and was reassigned to another mission after his objectives were complete. Kenobi regretted leaving her, but ultimately followed the Jedi Code he had sworn to live by. Meanwhile, Satine chose to stay and lead her people, having not asked Kenobi to stay, knowing it would have been a difficult choice.[33]\n\nIncident on Teth\n\nIn 40 BBY, Kenobi and Jinn were sent to the planet Teth to investigate the disappearance of agricultural shipments through the Triellus trade route. The pair ran into difficulties finding information, and their investigations quickly aroused the suspicions of the guilty parties. As their situation rapidly turned violent, Kenobi and Jinn stormed a building, using their lightsaber skills to force their way through the compound. In the chaos, Jinn felt that Kenobi was not responding to instructions well, and chose to make an escape.[18]\n\nJinn instructed Kenobi to find a ship, though the Padawan failed to do so upon being stopped in a hangar. Kenobi was briefly held hostage by Wanbo the Hutt's majordomo, Thurible, but was soon released in exchange for Wanbo, who had been captured by Jinn. Eventually, the Jedi managed to depart the planet after making tenuous peace with Wanbo. Though both Jedi attempted to remain lighthearted about the outcome of the mission, Kenobi felt that he had failed his Master.[18]\n\nOnce on Coruscant, Jinn recounted the communication issues that had plagued him and Kenobi during the Teth mission to the Jedi Council. While citing their continued inability to form a strong bond, he surmised that they may not have been meant to be a pair. Jinn received an invitation to join the Council after the mission, which displeased Kenobi when he found out shortly after during a meeting with Supreme Chancellor Kirames Kaj. Jinn resolved to make a decision regarding the invitation after meditation, knowing accepting the invite would result in Kenobi's reassignment to another Master.[18]\n\nMission to Pijal\n\nDays after his mission to Teth, a political dispute erupted on the Inner Rim planet Pijal, which caught the attention of Kaj. Initial reports suggested a performance troupe called the Opposition was engaging in increasingly violent initiatives protesting the signing of the Governance Treaty— a move would end the absolutist monarchy. Jinn and Kenobi were informed that Lord Regent Rael Averross had requested their aid on the planet and its moon to curb the attacks, discover more about their origins, and ensure the opening of the Pijal Hyperspace Corridor hyperspace route. Both Jedi were additionally instructed to to protect the Pijali Crown Princess Fanry until she could sign the treaty at her coronation, and ratify the initiative on behalf of the Republic.[18]\n\nKenobi and Jinn were dispatched to the planet, and the Master took the opportunity to inform his Padawan about Averross's training under Dooku. Upon their arrival to the Pijal system, they spotted several soulcraft vessels suffering from plasma attacks, and moved to save the ships. Helped by an antiplasma charge, Kenobi and Jinn rescued several soulcraft and the slaves inside. Jinn and Kenobi were regally greeted by Fanry upon their arrival to the Pijali palace. Upon being briefed on the situation, the pair used a small shuttle to meet with the gemstone thieves Rahara Wick and Pax Maripher on the world's moon. After some negotiation, the thieves agreed to assist the Jedi in their search for the Opposition and its leader, Halin Azucca.[18]\n\nKenobi and Jinn made several trips to the moon, and their scans for the Opposition came up unsuccessful. While on the palace grounds, Kenobi participated in the ritual Grand Hunt while riding a Pijal varactyl. During the ceremonial hunt, the crab droid prey of the event attacked Fanry, prompting Kenobi to destroy the threat. Upon investigation, he and his Master concluded that the sabotage must have been conducted by someone within the palace, and not the Opposition.[18]\n\nEventually, Kenobi and Jinn met with Azucca on Pijal's moon, and she claimed that her group of performance artists had been framed for the attacks blamed on them. With this knowledge, Jinn refused to ratify the Governance Treaty at Fanry's upcoming coronation after receiving a violent Force vision about the events. Azucca later provided information to the Jedi proving that the attacks on Czerka facilities were found to have originated from blackguards, a division of the Pijali royal guards secretly under the orders of Captain Deren and Fanry.[18]\n\nKenobi, knowing that Jinn would refuse to sign the treaty, was appointed to ratify the initiative on the Republic's behalf in his place by the Jedi Council. However, at Fanry's coronation, the princess violently seized power as an absolute monarch to prevent the signing of the treaty, decrying democracy. Kenobi attempted to protect the Skykeeper leader from her when Fanry ordered the death of those she percieved had betrayed her. Kenobi listened to Fanry's speech about the greed of her elders, and used his kohlen crystal sabotaged lightsaber to attack Deren. Following the injury of her captain, the newly crowned queen escaped the Celestial Chalice where the event had been held with her confidante Cady, leaving the Skykeeper, the jeweler, and Kenobi behind.[18]\n\nWhile Jinn tried to negotiate with Fanry over hologram, Kenobi helped the slaves aboard the Czerka cruiser, Leverage revolt with Maripher's help. Eventually, Cady ended her rule by holding her at blaster-point until she surrendered. However, because Fanry had threatened to harm Kenobi while he was acting as a Republic representative, the crowning was deemed illegitimate. Kenobi and Jinn helped the planet establish a democratic Assembly after Fanry's abdication, and reported back to Coruscant afterwards. Kenobi felt that the mission had been one of the first that he and his Master were able to work well together.[18] However, he also realized that his pairing with Jinn had strengthened his resolve to be a \"Perfect Jedi\" and follow the Jedi Code in all aspects, if only to be rebellious towards an unorthodox teacher.[20]\n\nSaving Th'er\n\nThe Jedi Order later sent Kenobi and Jinn to the planet Bri'n to resolve a conflict on the world. On Bri'n, the leader of the Metal Clan attempted to capture priestess Th'er so that either her word or her blood could be used to destroy her trees. Surrounded by forces of the Metal Clan, Jinn chose to escape with Th'er in an Eta-class shuttle and return to Coruscant. Once on planet, Kenobi watched, without interjection, as Th'er attempted to convince Qui-Gon to intervene in her conflict. However, she eventually chose to seek allies on Coruscant instead.[35]\n\nOperating near Botor\n\nAt some point prior to 32 BBY, Jinn and Kenobi were operating in the vicinity of a planet that served as a base of the Flesh Mongers pirate group, flying a pair of Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptors. The two received a message from the surface of the planet from Jedi Master Yoda, who was asking for assistance. Landing on the planet, Jinn and Kenobi discovered that Yoda had taken out the entire pirate gang in order to rescue a young Force-sensitive child, known as Lo, as the pirate had planned to sell him due to his abilities in the Force. After leaving the child in Kenobi and Jinn's care, Yoda departed for his next objective.[36]\n\nInvasion of Naboo\n\nAmbassadors to the Supreme Chancellor\n\nIn 32 BBY,[3] by the time Jinn considered Kenobi to be ready for his trials, they were sent by Galactic Republic Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum to negotiate with the Trade Federation, who had set up a blockade around the planet of Naboo.[13] Both Jedi extensively studied political documents and trade relations between the parties prior to the endeavor, sensing its necessity.[38] The two Jedi were tasked with negotiating a settlement with Trade Federation representatives.[13]\n\nThe pair traveled to the system on the Consular-class space cruiser Radiant VII and landed on the modified Lucrehulk-class LH-3210 cargo freighter Saak'ak, the flagship of the blockade. There, Kenobi and Jinn were brought to a conference room, where protocol droid TC-14 informed them that a Trade Federation representative would be with them shortly, and invited the pair to make themselves comfortable. However, upon learning that the pair were Jedi from TC-14, Viceroy Nute Gunray of the Trade Federation instead sent the protocol droid back into the room to distract them, with the droid offering Kenobi and Jinn drinks. Gunray then ordered his security to get rid of the Jedi and their assets, with an overhead turret destroying the Radiant VII and its crew.[13]\n\nThe two Jedi sensed the loss of their vessel and rose from their seats, drawing their lightsabers before noticing poisonous dioxis gas being pumped into the room around them and holding their breaths. OOM-series security droids were then sent to confirm that the Jedi were dead, however Kenobi and Jinn escaped into the hallway and destroyed the battle droids before making their way to the Saak'ak's bridge. Kenobi held off the battle droids while Jinn attempted to cut through the doors to the bridge. However, droidekas summoned by Gunray arrived, and the two Jedi were forced to flee into a nearby ventilation shaft, using Force speed to escape. The two escaped to Naboo's surface by stowing away on separate C-9979 landing crafts in the Saak'ak's hangar bay, discovering a droid army preparing to invade Naboo in the process.[13]\n\nRescuing Queen Amidala\n\nAfter arriving on Naboo, Kenobi was attacked by two Federation Single Trooper Aerial Platforms while en route to Jinn's location. He was rescued by his Master, who was accompanied by Jar Jar Binks, a member of Naboo's native Gungan species. After some debate, Binks agreed to lead the two Jedi to Otoh Gunga, a hidden underwater Gungan city where the group was brought before the Gungan leader Boss Nass. Though unable to convince the Gungans to help the humans of Naboo, Jinn influenced Nass to obtain transport, to allow them to reach Naboo's capital Theed. Piloting the transport through the planet's core, the trio was attacked by an Opee sea killer at one point, which led to the ship being damaged and electronic systems shutting down. Kenobi quickly fixed the issue with some rewiring, and after a brief encounter with a Sando aqua monster, Kenobi, Jinn, and Binks reached Theed.[13]\n\nUpon their arrival, the group discovered that the Trade Federation had already taken control of Theed, finding empty streets. The two Jedi came across a group of battle droids taking Queen Amidala and several others to an internment camp, and quickly engaged the droids, freeing the queen and her companions. Following this, the Jedi moved to a nearby hangar, intending to use a Naboo starship to take the queen to Coruscant. Kenobi moved to liberate several pilots who were held prisoner by battle droids, while his master took the rest of their group to a ship. After a brief skirmish, the group fled Naboo in the queen's starship in an attempt to reach Coruscant with news of the Trade Federation invasion. During the escape, the ship's hyperdrive was damaged by droid starfighters, preventing them from jumping straight to Coruscant and forcing them to instead land on Tatooine for repairs.[13]\n\nReturn of the Sith\n\nAfter landing on the desert world, Kenobi remained on the ship, while Jinn, Binks, the droid R2-D2, and Amidala, who was disguised as a handmaiden, went to search for a new hyperdrive unit. While searching, Jinn discovered Anakin Skywalker, a young enslaved human from whom he retrieved a blood sample for analysis, believing the child to be strong in the Force. Jinn sent the data to Kenobi on the ship, with instructions for Kenobi to analyze it. Kenobi's analysis revealed that the boy's midi-chlorian count was higher than that of any Jedi. When Jinn arrived, accompanied by Skywalker, Darth Maul, a Sith apprentice, attacked Jinn prompting Kenobi to order the ship to take off, with Jinn leaping into the ship as it ascended. The group then proceeded to Coruscant.[13]\n\nUpon their arrival on the planet, Jinn and Kenobi went directly to the Jedi Council to report on the mysterious attacker, whom Jinn believed to be a Sith Lord. After being briefed on what to do about their mysterious attacker, Jinn discussed about Skywalker with the Council, believing him to be the Chosen One. Nevertheless, the Council was determined that the boy not be trained. However, Jinn persevered, telling them that he would take the boy as his Padawan, despite the Jedi Code's restrictions, but Kenobi insisted he was ready to take the trials, and his master agreed. Instead of discussing the matter further, Mace Windu sent the pair back to Naboo to protect the Queen and also as an attempt to lure out the mysterious assailant.[13]\n\nAfter returning to Naboo, Binks located the Gungans and Amidala, revealing herself to be the true Queen, begged Boss Nass to provide assistance in fighting the droid armies of the Trade Federation. Boss Nass agreed to fight the droids as a diversion, while the Queen's forces slipped into Theed and captured Gunray. However, they soon encountered Maul once again and engaged in a duel with him, biding time for Amidala and her forces to reach the throne room. During the duel with Maul, Kenobi was separated from his master and forced to watch as Maul impaled Jinn with his double-bladed lightsaber so, when the opportunity arose, Kenobi, filled with rage, retaliated against the Sith. However, the Dathomirian Zabrak gained the upper hand and knocked Kenobi into a nearby shaft, where he was barely able to grab onto a knob jutting out from the side before falling to his death. Maul used this opportunity to kick his lightsaber into the shaft. Despite his predicament, Kenobi was able to use his Jinn's lightsaber to cut the Sith in half, whose body fell down the shaft, presumably dead. Kenobi then ran to his master's side and promised a dying Jinn that he would train Skywalker.[13]\n\nMaster of the Chosen One\n\nThe first years\n\nFollowing the end of the Battle of Naboo, Kenobi was promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight by the Council, with Yoda reluctantly accepting his decision to train Skywalker. Kenobi was later present during Jinn's funeral, where he informed the boy that he would become a Jedi.[13] Along with Amidala and her court, Kenobi and Skywalker remained at the funeral long after the Jedi Council had left, waiting until every last ember had gone out.[38] Though he deeply grieved the loss of his teacher, Kenobi also felt that Jinn had abruptly cast him aside in favor of prophecies and unbending belief in Skywalker as the Chosen One. Nonetheless, as he watched his mentor's body in its final moments, he promised that he would chose to believe the prophecies.[18] Later on, Kenobi, alongside his new Padawan and several members of the Jedi Council, took part in a victory celebration in Theed.[13]\n\nDuring his first year as Skywalker's Master, he sometimes woke up at night to see his Padawan was sleeping on the floor next to his bed; he realized Skywalker, having lost both his mother and Jinn, was clinging onto him, desperate to ensure his new master did not vanish one night.[20] During one of their many adventures, Kenobi fell into a nest of gundarks, prompting Skywalker to rescue him.[39] At the Jedi Temple, Kenobi trained Skywalker in meditation and levitating rocks. Though Skywalker wished to know more about his mentor's early life, he did not remember much of it by that point.[10] Kenobi had several misgivings toward taking on Skywalker as his Padawan, but stuck to his firm commitment of honoring his late master's dying wish. But Kenobi was still mourning Jinn, and he began to have the perspective that Skywalker got a very raw deal being forced to be with a master who was hardly fit to be a teacher and had just barely got beyond the Jedi trials himself.[40]\n\nMission to Dallenor\n\nKenobi was given a mission to go to the planet Dallenor, where an archaeology team had discovered a Jedi holocron. Kenobi decided to take Skywalker with him as part of his training. Kenobi went to the Temple Archives to find information on Dallenor and about any Jedi that went there, to no avail. He told Master Yoda that he would bring his apprentice with him, to which Yoda surprisingly agreed. Kenobi and Skywalker took a T-6 shuttle to Dallenor.[10]\n\nUpon their arrival, Kenobi met mistress Clatriffe, who told of her troubles with the local pirates. Kenobi was told of Clatriffe's discovery of centuries-old droids and how she had to hire several of the locals for protection. Kenobi examined the Holocron, but did not open it due to the arrival of the Krypder Riders and their leader, Hudso Shaku. Kenobi attempted to convince them to leave, but Shaku and the riders demanded the artifacts and Kenobi's lightsaber. Kenobi fought the riders and subdued them. Kenobi then saw that Shaku had taken Skywalker hostage and demanded his lightsaber. Before Obi-Wan could give a reply, Anakin was able to knock Shaku out with rocks.[10]\n\nOther adventures with Skywalker and a crisis of faith\n\nA couple of years later, Obi-Wan and Anakin traveled to the planet Ilum so that Skywalker could build his first lightsaber;[42] after its construction, Kenobi said to him, \"Anakin, this weapon is your life.\"[43][44] When Skywalker was twelve years old, Kenobi was assigned a mission to study a star system that revolved, seemingly impossibly, around a dead dwarf star. Upon realizing Skywalker had secretly snuck aboard his starship, Kenobi elected to turn the mission into a teaching experience, telling Skywalker of the dead star as a metaphor for how Jedi needed to learn to let go of their attachments.[29] Despite his initial misgivings about Skywalker, having once believed him to be dangerous and would do more harm than good, Kenobi soon grew to view the boy as a his equal, finding a partner in their missions, and came to see him as his brother.[40]\n\nAt some point, Kenobi and Skywalker, during a mission in which they were they were joined by Jedi Master Shaak Ti, were involved in complicated business on the terrestrial astronomical object of Naran-Shiv.[29] In 29 BBY, Skywalker sought to impress his peers at the Jedi Temple. During a training session, he defeated a training droid, which he had programmed to mimic the appearance of the Sith of Naboo. All the while, Mace Windu, Kenobi and Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine watched—the latter of whom was impressed.[41]\n\nSometime later, Skywalker struggled to learn the skill of taming creatures when Kenobi told him that the Chancellor wanted to see him. The two arrived at his office, where Palpatine requested that Skywalker accompany him on an errand, declining Kenobi's company.[46] Upon Skywalker's return to the Jedi Temple, he confided in Kenobi that he wished to leave the Order, feeling uncomfortable at the prospect of his entire life being decided when he was only nine years old, and surrendered his lightsaber to his master. Though Kenobi took the weapon, he pleaded Skywalker to reconsider.[47]\n\nKenobi later confided to Yoda about Skywalker's thoughts about leaving the Jedi Order and that he himself thought he had failed Skywalker despite doing the best he could to teach him, that Skywalker belonged with the Jedi Order and that he was too young not ready to be out on his own. Yoda confirmed that Kenobi himself was still young as well and that Skywalker was still a child and that it was natural for him to have questions. Yoda then asked if Kenobi would be breaking his vow to Qui-Gon Jinn by allowing Skywalker to leave, but Kenobi asserted that he would still train Skywalker in the Force in case the dark side found him. Yoda reminded Kenobi that Jedi training was exclusive to the Jedi Order, to which Kenobi responded that if Skywalker left, so would he.[48]\n\nMission to Carnelion IV\n\nBefore Skywalker could give his definite answer, at Yoda's behest, both student and master responded to a mysterious distress signal from the supposedly-dead world of Carnelion IV that specifically called for Jedi intercession. They began their journey to the coordinates, but their shuttle was damaged due to the planet's atmospheric debris field and the two had to eject from the doomed vessel, landing below the Celadon Sea. Not too long afterwards, they came to be aware of there being life on the planet as a sky battle raged over them, and Kenobi returned his lightsaber to him so that he could defend himself. As one of the combatant airships began to fall, Skywalker and Kenobi saved its two-person crew by delaying the crash.[41]\n\nThe survivors, Kolara and Mother Pran, were unaware of the distress signal and who the Jedi were.[41] Kenobi was then able to use a mind trick on Pran to lower her weapons. However, they came under attack by the other airship. Kenobi then used his lightsaber to destroy the airship. Kenobi then stopped the pilot, Grecker from shooting at Skywalker, Pran, and Kolara. After Skywalker destroyed their blasters, Kenobi then pulled their knives away. Kenobi reasoned with Grecker, Kolara, and Pran that they needed to get to safety. As they made their way, they came across Corpse-leeches. Kenobi and Skywalker then drew their lightsabers and tried to use the force to connect with them to no avail. Kenobi and the others then boarded an airship.[46]\n\nKenobi then refused to give them the location of the distress signal. He also told Grecker that Skywalker was not his son, but his Padawan at the dying request of his master. Kenobi and Grecker then defended the airship against the corpse-leeches. However, Pran and Kolara took Skywalker with them and abandoned the airship. Kenobi was then left behind on the airship as Pran destroyed it.[49]\n\nKenobi and Grecker were then able to jump off the airship before it crashed. Kenobi was then able to use the force to make the creatures understand him. Kenobi then asked Grecker to tell him where Skywalker was taken to. Grecker told him that he did not know where the open was. Kenobi then decided to go after him with Grecker after getting air masks on. Kenobi and Grecker then found the location of the distress signal. They then came under attack by a creature. Grecker then fired a flare. Kenobi and Grecker then fought until a masked man came out and let them in. Kenobi was able to get inside before Grecker closed the door. The man, Sera, then showed Kenobi his collection of his world's remnants. Kenobi was then told that Sera was the one who sent the distress signal. He then told Kenobi about his collection of relics and how both the open and closed wanted him dead.[47]\n\nKenobi then learned about how Sera sent the signal and learned about both the Jedi and Sith. Kenobi and Sera then went to the roof to watch as Grecker's forces attacked his fortress. Despite Sera's pleas for Kenobi to kill them, Kenobi told her that the Jedi spare everyone. Kenobi then spoke with Grecker and convinced him to stop their attack. However, Mother Pran attacked with her machines. Kenobi was then saved by Skywalker. Kenobi then took Skywalker to the Sera's communication unit. There, Skywalker was able to send out a signal off-planet. Republic and Jedi forces arrived where they ended the conflict.[48]\n\nMission to Glee Anselm\n\nGrand Master Yoda was captured by battle droids and taken to the planet Glee Anselm. Kenobi and Skywalker were sent to rescue him. Whilst on Glee Anselm, they located Yoda in an underwater base, where they learned that the Grand Master had never really been captured. In reality, the operation was a test for Kenobi and Skywalker, which they passed. The adventure marked the start of Kenobi and Skywalker coming to view each other as brothers.[24] Kenobi and his Padawan were also dispatched on a mission to Taris at one point.[29]\n\nCapturing a thief\n\nWhile visiting Dex's Diner, the Pa'lowick thief Tri Tellon stole an object from Kenobi. She escaped through the world's lower levels, through CoCo Town and to her den, which she shared with the old rogue Magreda. Expecting to find Magreda, she instead found Kenobi who explained that the object she had stolen was just a tracking device wrapped in some paper. In came Dexter, who had asked Kenobi to trick Tellon as she had stolen a lot of goods from his customers. Dexter thanked him and told Kenobi he owed him one, which the Jedi accepted.[50]\n\nHumbling the Chosen One\n\nSometime after Skywalker reached adulthood, Kenobi and Skywalker would engage in a lightsaber sparing session in the Jedi Temple. After Skywalker thought he was victorious, Kenobi told him that despite his victory, his need to win blinded him, and Kenobi was able to overpower Skywalker and take Skywalker's lightsaber away from him.[51]\n\nSeparatist Crisis\n\nProtecting Senator Amidala\n\nIn 22 BBY,[3] Kenobi and Skywalker were involved in a border dispute on Ansion[52] that involved Presidente Shu Mai of the Commerce Guild. Following their success on Ansion,[53] the two Jedi were sent by the Jedi Council—at the behest of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine—to protect the now Senator Amidala from future attacks following an assassination attempt on her life. Kenobi and Skywalker made their way to Padmé's Apartment and whilst they traveling up a turbolift, Kenobi sensed Skywalker's anxiety and warned him of over-stepping their duties, only to be told later of Amidala's plan to use herself as bait.[39]\n\nThat night, Zam Wesell attempted to kill the Senator with venomous kouhun deployed from a probe droid, but her plot was foiled when Kenobi and Skywalker sensed a disturbance in the Senator's room. While Skywalker eliminated the creatures, Kenobi leaped out of the window and held onto the droid as it attempted to flee into the skylanes of Coruscant. The probe droid moved rapidly between the express ways in an attempt to dislodge the Jedi, unsuccessfully. As the droid moved closer to Wesell's position, the assassin shot the droid with her rifle, destroying it and causing Kenobi to fall rapidly towards the surface of the planet. Skywalker was quickly approaching Kenobi's position in a speeder, and moved beneath him in order to catch him. The pair then proceeded to pursue the bounty hunter through the skyways of Coruscant through traffic lanes and industrial areas, until Skywalker leaped to her speeder and disabled it, causing it to crash outside the Outlander Club.[39]\n\nThe pair followed her in, realizing she was a changeling, able to mask her appearance. Kenobi made his way to the bar where he was offered death sticks by Elan Sel'Sabagno, an offer he declined. Kenobi encouraged Sel'sabagno to return home and rethink his life, using the force for persuasion. He sensed Wesell's presence and cut her arm off with his lightsaber before she could shoot him. Before she could tell the Jedi who she was working for, Wesell was shot and killed by a toxic dart fired by Jango Fett.[39]\n\nSubsequently, Kenobi and Skywalker were sent on separate missions by the Council—while Kenobi continued an investigation on Amidala's aggressors, Skywalker would protect her on Naboo. Despite thinking his Padawan was not prepared for his first solo mission, he abided by Council's request. Kenobi, then, took the toxic dart to his friend Dexter Jettster, who told him that it was a Kamino saberdart. Using Dex's information about Kamino, Kenobi visited the Archives, but he was unable to locate the system. When he asked Jocasta Nu about it, she surmised that the system must not exist since it was not in the archives. Unconvinced, Kenobi visited Master Yoda, who was teaching the Bear Clan, and the two agreed that someone had erased the files on Kamino from the Archives, and that Kenobi needed to visit the location of the lost planet.[39]\n\nDiscovery of the Clone Army\n\nUpon arriving on Kamino, Kenobi was greeted by the Kaminoan Taun We who told the Jedi that they had been expecting him. She took Obi-Wan to Prime Minister Lama Su, who said Sifo-Dyas would have been proud of the army they had created in accordance with his request—to create a clone army for the Republic. Kenobi was then shown the clones' prowess and growth, and was told that the original template was Jango Fett. After asking to meet Fett, Taun We took Kenobi to Fett's quarters, where the Jedi Knight asked the bounty hunter questions concerning any recent visits to Coruscant.[39]\n\nAfter their meeting, Jango and his clone son, Boba Fett, attempted to flee Kamino in the bounty hunter's ship, Slave I. Obi-Wan confronted Jango, and the two fought on the landing platform. At the end of the battle, Obi-Wan fell off the platform, and Jango believed he had fallen into the sea. However, Obi-Wan managed to catch hold of a bridge, and he returned to the platform to see Slave I taking off with just enough time for Obi-Wan to attach a homing beacon to Jango's hull.[39]\n\nCapture on Geonosis\n\nKenobi pursued the Slave I in his starfighter all the way to Geonosis and managed to survive Fett's attacks with seismic charges. Tricking him into believing he had died, Kenobi managed to land on the planet, where he discovered a multitude of Trade Federation ships. Furthermore, he infiltrated and overheard Count Dooku addressing the Separatist Council and mentioning the attempts on Senator Amidala's life were at the request of Nute Gunray. Realizing the importance of his discoveries, Kenobi sent a message to Skywalker in Tatooine as his signal could not reach Coruscant on its own. Before he could end his message, however, Kenobi was captured by the Separatists and imprisoned.[39]\n\nInside the prison tower, Dooku visited him; he revealed that the Republic was under the influence of a Sith Lord named Darth Sidious, and tried to convince Kenobi to join him and destroy the Sith together, but Kenobi refused.[39] Kenobi did not believe what Dooku said about the Republic being controlled by the Sith, just as Dooku had hoped.[21]\n\nThe Clone Wars\n\nFirst Battle of Geonosis\n\nSentenced to execution in Geonosis' Petranaki Arena, Kenobi was joined in the arena by Skywalker and Amidala who were also captured in their attempt to rescue him. Though reassured that his message had been re-transmitted, he expressed disappointment that Skywalker had come and failed to free them from the situation. The trio worked to control the three creatures deployed to kill them—a reek, an acklay, and a nexu. After they had freed themselves from their restraints, Kenobi fought the[39] most formidable[55] of the three creatures—the acklay. Kenobi, Amidala, and Skywalker were saved by the arrival of a Jedi task force led by Mace Windu who refused to surrender to Dooku, intending to complete their rescue. The Jedi fought back against the overwhelming droid armies, but soon only a few survivors were left in the center of the arena surrounded by battle droids. When Windu declined Dooku's offer to let the Jedi surrender,[39] Kenobi stood in solidarity with the decision, intending to go down fighting.[55]\n\nMoments prior to their execution, clone army forces arrived in transports led by Master Yoda. The clones fought back against the droids and rescued the Jedi and Amidala, forming a perimeter around the survivors. Kenobi then boarded the same Republic LAAT/i transport with Skywalker and Amidala while the rest of the Jedi task force also escaped. As they flew, Skywalker instructed their clone pilots on how best to shoot down enemy forces, which Kenobi complimented. Soon, both caught sight of Dooku fleeing on his speeder with a droid escort. Kenobi felt that there was not enough time to pursue reinforcements, assuring Amidala that he and his Padawan could handle the situation alone. When Dooku's escort rattled their LAAT/i, the Senator fell out of their vehicle, causing Skywalker to panic.[39]\n\nSkywalker pleaded to rescue her, though Kenobi insisted that catching up to Dooku was the highest priority and that if the Padawan stayed behind he would be removed from the Jedi Order. Once they landed, Kenobi and Skywalker pursued Dooku as he prepared to flee the planet. After confronting him about the Jedi he had killed earlier that day, the pair engaged in a lightsaber duel with Dooku. The former Jedi's use of Force lightning revealed his fall to the dark side, prompting Kenobi to be wary when his apprentice was downed by it.[39] Now knowing that he had underestimated Dooku's skills,[55] dueled Dooku, but was eventually disarmed by the former Jedi during the duel and injured on the shoulder and thigh. Kenobi tossed his lightsaber to Skywalker so that he could continue the fight.[39]\n\nHowever, after the Padawan's arm was cut off by Dooku's lightsaber, he too was tossed to the floor beside his Master. Dooku moved toward them both, but Yoda arrived shortly after to fight his former apprentice in a lightsaber duel. However, he was forced to focus on saving Skywalker and Kenobi from being crushed to their deaths by falling debris moved loose by Dooku. As a result, the Separatist leader escaped in his ship, leaving the three Jedi behind. Amidala arrived with a group of clone troopers shortly afterward, embracing Skywalker as Kenobi stood nearby.[39]\n\nPromotion to Jedi General\n\nFollowing the Geonosis battle, Kenobi traveled back to Coruscant while his Padawan escorted Amidala to Naboo.[39] Skywalker's absence was noticed by[56] Vice Chancellor[5] Mas Amedda, who informed Chancellor Palpatine of his whereabouts after seeing he did not return with Kenobi.[56] In the Temple on Coruscant, Kenobi met with Mace Windu and Yoda in the Jedi Council room to discuss the confrontation that had just taken place. He told the Councillors that his apprentice was escorting Amidala back to Naboo before returning to the Temple, which they accepted. Although Kenobi noted that the Geonosis battle would not have been a victory without the clones, Yoda did not think of it as victory, as it marked the beginning of the Clone Wars. Though Kenobi passed on Dooku's warning about a Sith controlling the Senate to his peers—both mostly dismissed it due to the former Jedi's actions and fall to the dark side. However, the trio resolved to continue monitoring the Senate instead.[39]\n\nWhile Skywalker was on Naboo to escort Amidala home,[39] he wondered how his Master was doing in the aftermath of the battle. Additionally, the Padawan reflected on what their responsibilities in the upcoming war would be like while having to collaborate with clone troopers in battle. However, he firmly chose to keep knowledge of his relationship with the Senator secret from Kenobi despite the strain of the deception. Skywalker married Amidala, despite knowing his Master would disapprove. As days passed, Skywalker eventually chose to return to Coruscant, citing that he had not informed his Master of a reason to remain on Naboo. After meeting with their superiors, both Kenobi and Skywalker were sent on their first deployment.[56]\n\nNow greatly respected both in and outside of the Jedi Order, Kenobi was promoted to Jedi General like many of his colleagues and was later bestowed the rank of High Jedi General while he led the Third Systems Army and commanded the Open Circle Fleet in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. While deployed, he held command of the 7th Sky Corps and often led its 212th Attack Battalion into combat personally until the war's end. The Clone Marshal Commander Cody served as his second-in-command, accompanying him on many missions against the Separatist Droid Army and other Separatist targets. Kenobi's military engagements, often alongside Skywalker, led to many famed victories that he was praised for by the Republic.[55]\n\nFor his diplomatic skills, he came to be known as \"the Negotiator\"—[5] a title mirrored by the name of his flagship, the Venator-class Star Destroyer Negotiator.[57] Early in the Clone Wars, Kenobi met the Supreme Martial Commander of the Separatist Droid Armies, General Grievous. The two developed a rivalry and fought each other numerous times during the war,[55] with Grievous considering Kenobi to be a Jedi he needed to kill \"face to face.\"[58] Their skills were equal, and they quickly became mortal enemies.[59] Grievous harbored a deep animosity for Kenobi.[60] At some point during his travels, Kenobi visited the planet Gazian, which was strong in the Force. The planet, which had a Force vergence, captured an imprint of those who traveled there, including Kenobi.[61] As his last lightsaber was destroyed,[39] Kenobi built a new lightsaber, which he would break in through his service in the conflict[62] and use throughout the remainder of his life.[4]\n\nInitial engagements\n\nRocky planet deployment\n\nShortly after the battle on Geonosis, Kenobi was sent to a rocky planet alongside his Padawan, Commander Cody, and several troopers, including a clone soldier named Sister, to destroy Separatist forces. Kenobi was dismayed by how much Skywalker seemed to enjoy combat, and asked how his apprentice found enjoyment in their combat. After receiving a reply, Kenobi worked with his student to complete their objectives and resolved to find better cover for their future engagements. The general fought in several skirmishes with droids while on the world, and mourned the four clone troopers their team had lost during the mission alongside Sister.[56]\n\nFeeling that the Jedi needed more generals, he resolved to suggest to the Jedi Council that Skywalker take the Jedi trials after watching him in combat. He mused that it was a move that would allow them to work together, but also afford the younger man the freedoms of a higher rank along with his own command. Not long after on Coruscant, the handmaiden Sabé initially worried that Kenobi would notice her posing in Amidala's place while at a meeting in the Jedi Temple. When Skywalker left the gathering, Sabé noticed Kenobi attempt to convince his former apprentice to talk to the Alderaanian Senator Bail Organa. Skywalker's time as a Padawan ended, as he was risen to the rank of Jedi Knight[56] for the war not long after.[29] As a result, Kenobi was promoted to Jedi Master after his apprentice's knighting.[5]\n\nRising through the ranks\n\nAfter Skywalker had already been promoted, Kenobi attended his former apprentice's official Knighting Ceremony, which was being officiated by Master Windu. Kenobi had just recently become the next of many Jedi to rotate into the council seat of the late Coleman Trebor, and it was unknown if this arrangement would be permanent. Kenobi treated the tasks presented to him in this role with a certain amount of seriousness, and even treated the ceremony as if it was a war decision. As Windu gave his speech, Kenobi stared at Skywalker, who could feel the weight of the stare. When Windu brought up the possibility of the recently-knighted Jedi receiving Padawans of their own, Kenobi caught Skywalker's eye, smirking as the thought of an apprentice irked Skywalker.[29]\n\nFollowing the conclusion of Windu's speech, Kenobi, confused, glanced around the other Jedi Masters present. Despite his usual skill with improvisation and negotiations, Kenobi found himself flustered by scheduling problems. Skywalker was amused by Kenobi's confusion, as his former master ran his fingers through his now-longer hair. Upon noting that the Chancellor, various senators, and multiple clone commanders were still not present, Kenobi commented that their guests were late, albeit certain that they would arrive shortly. However, the Chancellor's attendance was not in person, but instead via a holo-transmission. Addressing Yoda and Windu, Palpatine announced that the Purse World Cato Neimoidia had been bombed. As Yoda instructed the Padawans and younglings to leave, Kenobi grabbed Skywalker's shoulder, ensuring him that they were equals, and he was welcome to stay. Skywalker then asked if he still had to call Kenobi \"Master,\" and Kenobi jokingly replied that it would only be the case if he knew his place.[29]\n\nAs the group was informed that the Cadesura district of Cato Neimoidia's capital city, Zarra, had collapsed, Kenobi stood side by side with Skywalker. His thoughts lingered on his former apprentice for several seconds, pondering how his emotional transition into a Jedi Knight had been rougher than expected. He believed that, while Skywalker had made progress in coming to decisions confidently, he often reverted into deference, unsure of what his place was. It reminded Kenobi of his own ascension to the rank of Jedi Knight, thinking about how long it had taken for him to feel as though he had earned his title, in contrast to his peers who had taken their promotions in stride. Remembering Jinn's advice to not linger on his anxieties, Kenobi exhaled, focusing his mind on the moment.[29]\n\nThe Cato Neimoidia affair\n\nKenobi was then sent to look into the explosion, which was being blamed on the Republic[29] by the Purse World Cato Neimoidia, the headquarters of the Trade Federation.[63] As Kenobi investigated with the help of a Neimoidian guard named Ruug Quarnom, the newly-knighted Skywalker disobeyed orders and joined him.[29] During their mission, events transpired that led to a situation where the two Jedi were in peril. Skywalker believed that he had saved his former mentor from the danger, while Kenobi believed the action did not count towards the ever-growing total of times his former apprentice had saved his life.[12] For his actions on Cato Neimoidia, it was decided Kenobi's council seat would be permanent.[29]\n\nKrystar rescue\n\nAt some point that year, Kenobi and his battalion were sent to the planet Krystar to rescue several clones being held captive. Though hesitant to pursue an assault on the planet, which was aligned with the Republic, he agreed with Cody that saving the hostages was important. After meeting with Amidala, he was made aware of intelligence gathered from Senator Vishar Koss of Krystar. Using this, Kenobi helped form a plan for the operation to infiltrate a compound rumored to be built near the Krystar palace with Amidala's assistance. Escorted to the planet's surface by Amidala under the guise of an aid mission, Kenobi and his troopers investigated the claims of the captured clones.[64]\n\nThough his soldiers wished to take action immediately to free their brothers, the Jedi insisted on having adequate proof before responding accordingly due to the planet's Republic affiliation. Kenobi's men proved able to confirm the claims made by Koss when they found trapped troopers in the compound and contacted their commanding officer about it. Kenobi then received a transmission from Amidala, who informed him that Krystar's Regent Queb was selling the captured clones to Trandoshans. Kenobi instructed his men to free their brothers, which they did successfully before returning to their ship. Though a Trandoshan hunter was upset at the recapture of the clones, Kenobi faced his fury by throwing him out of range with the Force. The general then allowed Koss and Amidala to travel off the planet with them, with the former seeking protection until Queb was taken care of. After the event, Kenobi vowed to protect his allies until the end of the war as much as possible—despite the political challenges—and promised that Queb would be arrested.[64]\n\nCaliban bridge building\n\nKenobi and his troopers were present on the Outer Rim moon Caliban and were captured by General Grievous. Though the Jedi attempted to argue that prisoners of war cannot be forced into labor due to a provision in the Galactic Accords war statutes, Grievous insisted that they build a lunar ice bridge for him. Grievous claimed he would kill them if they did not complete the task, and that they would be lucky to leave alive. Despite the frigid temperatures, Kenobi made a plan to construct a sabotaged project to replace the bridge the Separatist leader had originally destroyed and instructed the clone troopers with him to assist.[66]\n\nNear the build site, the Jedi and his men climbed a rise and met a qubey native of the world trapped on one side of a ravine, attempting to reach its parent on the opposite end. After Kenobi saw this, he decided to rebuild the bridge out of compassion and relayed this order to his troopers. Further observation of the creatures showed indication of their displeasure with the Separatist presence on their world, leading to Kenobi counting them as allies. As the structure was being made, the qubey distracted Grievous enough for Kenobi to retrieve his lightsaber when the enemy leader came to inspect it's construction in a surprise ambush. After the bridge's completion, Kenobi implored the general to let his men leave the planet. When Grievous declined, the qubey attacked him and his droids while the Jedi also engaged the Separatist in lightsaber combat. Kenobi goaded the general into stepping onto the sabotaged new bridge, then used the Force to start an avalanche. Grievous fell into the ravine after being swept away, allowing Kenobi to escape the planet with his men in a ship and destroy the bridge after takeoff.[66]\n\nHisseen siege\n\nKenobi traveled to the planet Hisseen and participated in a siege of the planet alongside Skywalker, Jedi Master Plo Koon, and their battalions. After working swiftly to destroy an encampment of battle droids, Koon instructed the trio that their objective was to prevent the Hisseenian premier from revealing the location of his fellow parliament members to Dooku and[67] his apprentice,[5] Asajj Ventress—who would kill or threaten them. The Jedi leave and headed into mountainous terrain while leaving their troopers to handle the Separatist ground assault.[67] The Jedi searched to discover the location of the parliament, initially coming up with nothing. However, they soon met Dooku and Ventress, engaging in a lightsaber fight with the pair that prevented them from seeking out the parliament. Koon attempted to contact their clone commanders of the deteriorating situation while Kenobi and Skywalker fought the Separatist darksiders,[68] though the message broke up[67] due to the mountainous terrain surrounding them.[68]\n\nKoon relayed the coordinates of the Hisseenian government members to Wolffe, trusting him and the other commanders to rescue them while he helped Skywalker and Kenobi.[68] As Dooku continued keeping the trio occupied,[68] their soldiers freed the parliament members by destroying the droids guarding them, reminded of the situational similarity of the Krystar mission that Kenobi had embarked on.[64] The siege on Hisseen continued with more waves of droids attacking, reminding Cody of the mission to Caliban. As the clone troopers prepare to fight, Kenobi, Skywalker, and Koon return, slicing the Separatist reinforcements into pieces. Though Ventress and Dooku escaped, Kenobi congratulated the soldiers on their success rescuing the parliament. He then relayed that Yoda had called them back to Coruscant for their next deployment.[66]\n\nDeployment to Kudo III\n\nKenobi traveled to the Corvair sector with Skywalker during the Battle of Corvair, watching the skirmish take place from a Venator-class Star Destroyer. Following the battle, the pair received instructions to investigate rumors of a droid foundry being established on a moon in the sector, Kudo III. Kenobi encouraged his former Padawan to trust in the Force in the investigation, and while acknowledging the skepticism of Yularen, supported Skywalker's intuition on the matter.[69]\n\nAs they shared a meal together, Kenobi shared Skywalker's concerns about civilians being involved in the Kudo III developments. He encouraged him to protect any innocents, while still dealing with discovered Separatist threats. Ultimately, Skywalker found that the Separatists had been attempting to goad the Republic into attacking the facility with falsely fed information to kill the innocent slaves inside, then using the assault as negative war propaganda against the Jedi. Kenobi praised Skywalker for his approach of the situation and discovery of the plot. Afterward, Kenobi and Yularen discussed the implications of attacking a neutral party, and whether the planet Kudo would consider joining as a result of the discovery on their moon.[69]\n\nArrival on Christophsis\n\nKenobi and Skywalker were sent on a mission to bring relief supplies to Senator Organa and the Republic forces that were trapped on the planet Christophsis because of[57] a thirty-ship strong[63] Separatist blockade led by Admiral Trench. Kenobi, who arrived later than his former apprentice, brought with him a stealth ship prototype provided by the Republic. He ordered Skywalker to retreat from his current position and meet him aboard his cruiser, where he presented the stealth ship and its capabilities to his companion. Kenobi then gave orders to Skywalker to sneak past the blockade and deliver the supplies to Organa's encampment in secret, which his former apprentice felt was similar to an errand. Though Skywalker wished for more of the prototypes, Kenobi informed him that only one was available—which was not to be used to attack Trench's ship alone.[57]\n\nEmboldened by his own skills, Skywalker tested the capabilities of the ship further and found that Trench's initial missiles were unable to detect it. Kenobi attempted to order his former apprentice to cease and head to Christophsis' surface with increasing urgency after making contact with Organa's bombarded command center and hearing the senator's pleas, but was ignored. Closing communications with his former Master, Skywalker proceeded to attack the flagship of the Separatist Admiral Trench with his stealth ship and broke the blockade with the attack. Afterward, Kenobi issued Skywalker his congratulations after the supplies were safely delivered to Organa on the world's surface.[57] Following the skirmish in space, the two Jedi Generals and their clone troopers were sent to the planet's surface to fight off the droid army taking control of the world.[70]\n\nTraitorous clone\n\nAfter flying to Christophsis' surface on gunships,[63] he and the troopers with him established a base of operations on the planet.[63] Kenobi and Skywalker then planned and prepared to lead a surprise assault on Separatist forces in the world's crystalline capital city Chaleydonia with their men. However, they were forced to abort their mission due to a large droid ambush. Skywalker led his troopers to Kenobi's trapped position and both escaped with their soldiers into a ship from the roof of a double-towered building. One of the troopers with them took the severed head of a T-series tactical droid.[70]\n\nAfter analysis, Cody and Skywalker's clone officer, Clone Captain Rex, reported to the Jedi that the enemy had known exactly where their ambush was going to be. Kenobi ordered both to root out the spy within the Republic's forces, insisting on the secrecy of the operations at hand while he left base with Skywalker to further investigate. When the Jedi took BARC speeders behind enemy lines, Separatist forces jammed their transmissions, which left Rex and Cody unable to contact them. Acting under their generals' orders, both clone officers discovered that the clone trooper Slick was the traitor and arrested him, but not before the traitor destroyed the majority of the Republic base's weapons depot. As Kenobi and Skywalker continued heading towards the Separatist headquarters, both surmised whatever was waiting for them there was a trap due to the number of droids observing them from a distance.[70]\n\nUpon entering the headquarters, both Jedi met minimal resistance on the lower level. After meeting Ventress in the building, however, Kenobi and Skywalker engaged in a lightsaber duel with her. Kenobi exchanged banter with Ventress as they engaged, but eventually was forced to escape with his colleague on stolen droid STAPs after an ambush. When the two Jedi returned to the command center, Rex and Cody presented an apprehended Slick. Kenobi and Skywalker expressed disappointment in Slick and the destruction of the weapons depot.[70] Fearing more troopers would decide to defect, they decided to keep the knowledge of Slick's incident secret.[63] The Jedi Master informed Rex and Cody that they should prepare for a large number of incoming battle droids, with minimal heavy cannons to defend their position with.[70] As Republic forces prepared to engage the droids, the blockade above Christophsis began reforming.[63]\n\nChaleydonia defense\n\nKenobi and Skywalker maintained control over the planet for a short period of time, reporting its capture to the Jedi Council. The Jedi Master then sent a ship back to the Republic fleet above Christophsis for a supplies restock, regretting the decision shortly after. Not long after, Palpatine requested that Jedi be sent to return Rotta—the son of the Hutt crime lord Jabba—to his father in exchange for the usage of Outer Rim trade routes. As a result, Windu and Yoda sent orders through Admiral Wullf Yularen to ensure that the new Padawan Ahsoka Tano landed on Christophsis to inform Kenobi and Skywalker of their next rescue mission assignment—assuming that the Jedi pair was done with their current engagement. However, on Christophsis, the Jedi pair continued to fight against more waves of enemy Separatist droids. While deflecting blast fire alongside Cody, Kenobi surmised that reinforcements would be needed soon.[71]\n\nKenobi defended the Republic's defensive positions alongside his men, helping Skywalker with a plan to wipe out droids in a large avenue while heavy cannons gave them cover fire. The Separatist General Whorm Loathsom decided to order his forces into a tactical retreat, surprising the Jedi. Seeing a Republic ship fly overhead, both assumed reinforcements or assistance had arrived. However, Kenobi and Skywalker then met Tano, who had arrived in the ship alone. Kenobi and his former apprentice used the ship to contact Yoda, who told them to return to Coruscant for a new mission. When Yoda learned of the impending Separatist threat preventing their departure from Christophsis he promised to send reinforcements, but cut off mid-transmission. Though the Kenobi assumed Tano would be his new apprentice, she corrected him, relaying that Skywalker was to be her teacher.[71]\n\nWhile they awaited assistance, Loathsom used a deflector shield to protect his droids from attack while steadily advancing on the Republic's heavy cannons. Kenobi used a holographic display to brief others about the location of the shield generator, after which Skywalker and Tano brainstormed a plan to take it out while the Jedi Master and Rex stayed behind as a diversion. As the shield boundary increased, Kenobi ordered his men to fall back to a position further into the city. Meanwhile, he went under the shield with some of his troopers and began attacking enemy forces. Seeing that their efforts were in vain, Kenobi instructed Rex to have his men guard the heavy cannons while he delayed the droids. The Jedi Master proceeded to offer himself up in defeat to Loathsom, claiming that there were terms of surrender to discuss.[71]\n\nAfter Kenobi spent an extended period of time stalling by delaying to set terms of surrender or offer a flag of truce during which he was held at blasterpoint, Skywalker and Tano destroyed the shield using explosive charges. His refusal to stand down his forces angered and distracted Loathsom who had Kenobi seized and threatened to destroy him. On the destruction of the shield, Kenobi freed himself and was able to quickly restrain the Separatist general as Republic reinforcements arrived on the planet. Upon landing in a gunship before Kenobi, Yoda greeted the Jedi Master to begin telling him of Rotta's capture.[71] While he managed to give Tano and Skywalker enough time to win the day for the Republic, his capture and subsequent stalling was a boon to Separatist propaganda for they were able to paint Kenobi's ruse as a false surrender and proof of Republic treachery. Ultimately, it ensured very few peace talks were held over the course of the war,[72] with Kenobi indeed coming to show regret for the conflict's ongoing bloodshed.[8]\n\nTeth and Tatooine\n\nAfter greeting Yoda on Christophsis, Kenobi gave parting advice to Skywalker about training Tano before heading to Tatooine to negotiate with Jabba. The Jedi Master promised that Republic forces would successfully rescue his son, and listened to the Hutt's additional terms about capturing the kidnapper of his son, dead or alive. Kenobi then informed Skywalker that he had one planetary rotation to return Rotta[71]—and also privately reflected that his meeting with Jabba had made him believe the Hutt had never bathed in his life due to the smell.[26] The Jedi Master ordered his troops to depart for Teth next in an effort to reinforce his former Padawan's forces. After Skywalker and Tano rescued Rotta from Teth's B'omarr Order Monastery, Kenobi arrived and fought with a fleet of fighters in Teth's atmosphere, but was unable to contact the other Jedi due to jammed transmissions.\n\nFrom the skies, he noticed a battle occurring on the rooftop of a building and followed his men down to the surface to find Skywalker. Kenobi found Ventress inside the monastery and fought in a brief lightsaber duel with her while exchanging banter. Skywalker and Tano escaped the planet with Rotta during their fight, and he eventually forced Ventress to flee after disabling one side of her lightsabers. Once the fight concluded, Kenobi contacted his former apprentice and informed him that he would come to Tatooine to help as soon as Teth's situation settled. After Skywalker and Tano successfully returned Rotta to Jabba and cleared their name from the framing schemes of the Hutt Ziro and Dooku, Kenobi and Yoda met the Jedi pair on Tatooine to negotiate a treaty with the crime lord.[71]\n\nA suspected defection\n\nAt some point following the negotiation of the Hutt Clan and Republic's treaty, the Jedi Council caught wind of Lannik Senator Zast Tri'vak's plans to defect to the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Due to the risk Tri'vak's defection would present to important Republic supply routes, the Council took action. Skywalker and Senator Amidala were sent on board the Hutt-owned MPO-1400 Purgill-class star cruiser known as the Halcyon to catch the rogue senator, while Kenobi staked out the planned arrival port of the Halcyon with a unit of clone troopers. As things went awry on board the star cruiser when Asajj Ventress arrived to extract Tri'vak, the Dark Acolyte taunted Skywalker, claiming he was not much of a challenge without Kenobi by his side. Ultimately, the risk of Tri'vak's defection was negated with his death, as Ventress killed him to prevent him from spilling Separatist secrets to the Hutt Clan.[73]\n\nRyloth's blockade\n\nAt some point, Kenobi met with members of the Jedi Council in a hologram call to meet with Admiral Dao from his post in the orbit of the planet Ryloth, who was calling for aid at Jedi General Ima-Gun Di's request. Dao informed the Councillors that his fleet was unable to continue aiding Republic forces on the world's surface due to the Separatist blockade around the planet, and his plea for help cut off mid-sentence when his flagship was destroyed. Following this, the Kenobi and his colleagues sent a CR90 corvette blockade runner loaded with relief supplies to planet Toydaria accompanied by Representative Jar Jar Binks of Naboo.[74]\n\nKenobi and his colleagues then proceeded to contact Senator Bail Organa and request his assistance in negotiating with King Katuunko of the planet Toydaria. Doing this, Kenobi explained, would allow Republic relief supplies to flow through the world as a staging ground. Moved by Kenobi's words, Organa agreed to travel to the negotiations to help the starving citizens of Ryloth. Eventually, the Senator was successful in delivering some of the supplies and gaining the favor of the Toydarian king.[74]\n\nMissions across the galaxy\n\nA secret superweapon\n\nWhen Master Plo Koon's fleet was destroyed in the campaign of the Malevolence—a secret Separatist superweapon—during the Battle of Abregado, and Skywalker reported the Kel Dor's interrupted message and loss of contact from the Abregado system. Kenobi watched his report alongside with Chancellor Palpatine, Windu, and Yoda, remarking that the Separatist operations were unusually tidy to maintain the secrecy of their weapon. In the meeting, Skywalker was ordered to reinforce Kenobi's fleet to protect supply convoys and not send a rescue for the attack's possible survivors from the Abregado system. Though Tano disagreed, she was overruled, with Kenobi fondly remarking that her outspoken behavior was likely learned from her Master.[75]\n\nKenobi's forces were joined by Admiral Yularen, who was commanding Skywalker's fleet. Upon questioning where his former apprentice was, Yularen explained the other general's self-redeployment to search for survivors in the Abregado system against orders. Kenobi then confronted Skywalker about his deviation from orders in a holographic call, prompting the wayward Jedi to meet with the Republic fleet as soon as possible. Though Tano claimed that the idea was hers, the Jedi Master doubted her claim, ordering them back to defensive escort duty upon learning no survivors had been found. In a meeting with Palpatine, Windu, and Yoda, Kenobi relayed Skywalker's detour and his hope to find Koon and his troopers still alive. Though the decision was deemed reckless by Yoda, Kenobi assured the group that his former apprentice's fleet was where it needed to be in defensive formation, as he had gone with only a small ship and his Padawan. Shortly after, Skywalker and Tano managed to rescue Koon and some of his men from the debris of their destroyed ships, escaping Separatist pursuit. As the first survivors of the superweapon, they were able to report to the Jedi Council what the Malevolence's capabilities were, including its ion cannons.[75]\n\nUpon learning of the Malevolence's next target—the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center in the Outer Rim—Kenobi and Skywalker formulated a daring plan to engage and destroy the Malevolence's ion cannons with his Shadow Squadron clone pilots. While Skywalker traveled through the nearby Kaliida Nebula with his squadron, Kenobi led the Republic fleet of ships through hyperspace to the medical station. As his former apprentice engaged the enemy vessel, Kenobi entered the system and began destroying the massive warship using the combined firepower of his fleet as the enemy vessel fled. Along with Wullf Yularen, Kenobi helped organize the evacuation of the medical center with Yularen, dispatching medical frigates. While Skywalker's task force proved successful in destroying its cannons,[76] the Malevolence's defenses withstood the fire of Kenobi's fleet for some time.[77] After thanking Skywalker for his assistance, Kenobi ordered the ships under his command to continue pursuit of the Malevolence as it fled to Separatist space[76] with a damaged hyperdrive.[77]\n\nMalevolence encounter\n\nDuring the pursuit, Kenobi discussed contacting additional reinforcements with Koon, but resolved to continue with the ships he had due to a lack of available forces in the area. The Master concluded that this could be the Republic's opportunity to destroy Grievous by firing on the enemy ship's bridge, having surmised that the Malevolence's hyperdrive was damaged due to the vessel not fleeing. Shortly after, in a trap arranged by Dooku and executed by Palpatine, Amidala arrived at the battle's scene having been fed false information regarding a diplomatic mission in the system. Using her as a hostage, Grievous forced the Republic's fleet to stall their attack, further encouraged by Skywalker's insistence on mounting a rescue.[77]\n\nKenobi joined Skywalker in a small ship, intending to sneak on the Separatist warship by slipping past the ship's damaged sensors and docking at an emergency airlock. Though the older Jedi was skeptical of the plan and his former apprentice's flying tricks, Skywalker claimed that the enemy forces were focused on handling repairs rather than watching for intruders. After successfully landing on the Malevolence, the pair quickly destroyed the battle droids greeting them. Kenobi and Skywalker were patched through to direct communication with Amidala, who informed them of her location and also berated them for coming to rescue her rather than continue with destroying the warship. Tano informed the trio that the best place to meet would be a large, open area in the center of the ship, which the Jedi and Senator began heading to.[77]\n\nAfter the Jedi rescued Amidala from droids at their rendezvous, Kenobi used the Force to levitate C-3P0 toward him, though the droid got carried away by a rail jet hovertrain. He informed Skywalker of this, and left his former apprentice to reacquire the droid while he would sabotage the hyperdrive. Kenobi's transmission was intercepted by Grievous, who challenged the Jedi's skills in front of the droids on his bridge. The Jedi Master then made his way to the ship's hyperdrive, but was met with an ambush consisting of many battle droids and Grievous himself. After escaping the situation by destroying the majority of the droids, Kenobi fled to the rail jets on the Malevolence while followed by Grievous. He and the cyborg engaged in a brief lightsaber duel that ended when the Jedi landed on a lower platform and made his way to Skywalker's escape ship.[77]\n\nAmidala, Skywalker, Kenobi, and their droids fled the Malevolence and contacted the Republic fleet as Grievous pursued in a personal starship. As they fled towards safety, the droids aboard the enemy warship completed repairs of its hyperdrive. Grievous gave the order for the Malevolence to flee, which resulted in the warship crashing into the nearby Dead Moon of Antar due to the coordinates in its navi-computer being sabotaged. Kenobi was surprised by the move, and was informed by Skywalker that it was always part of their plan. After the destruction of his warship, Grievous fled in his ship while the Jedi and their fleet celebrated.[77]\n\nAttack of Rishi Station\n\nAs weeks passed, Kenobi and Skywalker continued their search for Grievous and his fleet and sent Cody and Rex on an inspection run of their quadrant of space. The pair briefly discussed the intelligence they had regarding the matter, with Kenobi noting that they would find the enemy general eventually. He and his former apprentice were present for Cody's report on his inspections to a Pastil tracking station, and the commander further said that his next inspection would be at a listening post station in the Rishi system—an outpost crucial to warning Kamino of potential Separatist attacks. After thanking Cody for his work, Kenobi praised the clone to Yularen and Skywalker, then suggested that his former Padawan get some rest.[78]\n\nWhile on the Rishi Moon outpost, which had been taken over by droid forces, Cody and Rex's ship was destroyed and they lost contact with Kenobi's fleet. Hours after their scheduled check in, Yularen attempted to contact them to no avail. Though Kenobi felt that perhaps Rex was the cause of the delay, Skywalker retorted that the opposite could be true of Cody. Both resolved to devise a more efficient strategy to find Grievous, leaving Yularen in charge of contacting the clone officers. Not long after, Yularen was notified that the all-clear-signal on Rishi had been deactivated, prompting Kenobi to sound an invasion alarm and order his fleet to the Rishi system. The Jedi's fleet arrived just in time to force Grievous' ships out of the system, foiling the cyborg's plot to launch a surprise attack on Kamino. After the incident, Kenobi thanked the surviving clones that had defended the station—Echo and Fives—in a medal ceremony.[78]\n\nSkytop Station campaign\n\nFollowing his escape, Grievous began ambushing Republic fleets in the Skytop Station campaign and defeated forces on[79] the planet[80] Falleen.[79] Both the Jedi and the Republic has struggles against Grievous, who achieved many victories for the Separatists, proving to be a nearly indestructible opponent for them, leaving a trail of conquest and destruction across the galaxy.[81] Kenobi advised Skywalker to retreat from his post at[79] the gas giant[3] Bothawui, citing that Grievous' fleet outnumbered his. Tano agreed with the Master, though Skywalker insisted on staying to protect the sector. Skywalker managed to destroy the cyborg's flotilla at the cost of losing his droid, R2-D2.[79]\n\nA captured R2-D2 managed to send the coordinates of Skytop Station—a secret Separatist listening post—to Skywalker and Tano. After reporting the information to Kenobi using scramble code 1477, he instructed them to wait for reinforcements. Though Skywalker wanted to rescue his droid, Kenobi ordered him to destroy the station instead. After the mission and unsanctioned rescue, an exasperated Kenobi grudgingly accepted Skywalker's retrieval to the droid with only a brief rebuke for the reckless behavior. While Tano agreed that the Kenobi's reasoning, Skywalker explained that he knew she could complete the mission on her own so he could rescue R2-D2.[82]\n\nDooku on Vanqor\n\nIn their efforts to track the location of Dooku, Kenobi helped devise a plan to trick the Sith into revealing his location. As part of this plot, Skywalker allowed himself to be captured[83] by pretending his Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor was dead in space, which prompted the Count to tow it[84] aboard a Separatist Munificent-class star frigate to discover where it was stationed. Kenobi then traveled to his friend's last known location—an ice field near the Outer Rim planet Vanqor—using an enviro-suit[84] and jetpack to travel through space. After sneaking aboard the frigate, Kenobi successfully freed Skywalker from his detention cell and returned his lightsaber to him. The younger Jedi felt annoyed that he had been the one to be captured, which led Kenobi to tease that when he became a Jedi Master, he could make the plans.[83]\n\nKenobi and Skywalker confronted Dooku in his meditation chamber, acting in a proud way that disgusted the older man. The Sith quickly used an escape chute to head towards the vessel's hangar to head to his Punworcca 116-class interstellar sloop, followed by Skywalker. After Dooku successfully took off in his escape vessel,[84] Kenobi and Skywalker pursued him in a stolen Sheathipede-class transport shuttle and called on Tano to rally Republic reinforcements.[83] The Jedi scored a direct hit on Dooku's sloop that knocked out his engines, forcing him to make a crash landing on Vanqor.[84] However, the damage done to Kenobi and Skywalker's stolen shuttle by the Sith's escort also necessitated their own emergency landing on the same world. As their ship touched ground, both Jedi exchanged playful banter about piloting and destroyed the homing beacon on Dooku's crashed ship.[83]\n\nThe Jedi pair surveyed the area, deciding to start their search for the Sith in Vanqor's caves.[83] Dooku manipulated the Force to flare the barest hint of his Force presence within the caves, which the Jedi picked up as he had planned.[84] When Kenobi and Skywalker entered the caves, Dooku crashed down the loosened rock above the entrance using telekinesis, trapping them inside. Though both survived, Skywalker had lost his lightsaber, which Kenobi chided him for while cleaning his own weapon. The Jedi Master watched in amusement as a large gundark went after his former apprentice, but eventually helped him throw rocks at the creature to cease its attacks. When the caves started to fill with poison gas, Tano rescued the pair—though both indignantly claimed that they had not needed help and were productively tracking Dooku. After escaping, Kenobi and Skywalker contacted the Jedi Council.[83]\n\nOhnaka's pirates\n\nAfter learning that Dooku was captured by Captain Hondo Ohnaka's pirates on Vanqor and brought to the planet Florrum, who hoped to trade him for a hefty ransom from the Republic, the Jedi Council agreed to send Kenobi and Skywalker to verify his capture following the suggestion of Amidala. Windu informed the Jedi of their next assignment, and the stipulation that they arrive unarmed. Though both Kenobi and Skywalker were uneasy with what could become a hostile situation, Windu insisted on the importance of the mission. After landing in a small ship, both were led to the pirates' stronghold cells and saw Dooku hanging from restraints. Though the Sith attempted to warn the pair that the pirates would turn traitor on them, both refused spent time sneering and scoffing at him. When the two Jedi reported in after speaking to Ohnaka, Palpatine had Binks and Senator Kharrus lead a diplomatic mission to trade a ransom for the Count.[83]\n\nKenobi and Skywalker attended a feast after their business concluded, and accepted offered refreshments. However, before a toast both swapped their cups with their pirate neighbors and discovered shortly after that Ohnaka had attempted to poison them when both collapsed.[83] After taking a sip of their drinks, both woke up in restraints connected to the Dooku's bindings. After briefly arguing with the Sith, Kenobi and Skywalker agreed that they would form a plan to escape their situation. When Dooku opened their cell using a Force-levitated knife, Kenobi grudgingly told his former apprentice to let the Separatist focus. Though the trio escaped from the room they were in, they were recaptured by Ohnaka's pirates shortly after.[85]\n\nOhnaka confronted Kenobi, Skywalker, and Dooku, warning them not to escape again to ruin his chance at a profit. When the captain left Kenobi mind tricked a guard into opening their cell. The trio crept through the pirate compound, exchanging tense banter. Eventually, Dooku broke them through a wall and they raced to the edge of the compound. However, Ohnaka caught up to them and put them back in a cell, eventually having them separated from Dooku and hung by restraints in front of a group of pirates. The captain informed them that their Republic had not arrived with Dooku's ransom and proceeded to electrocute the pair. When Dooku escaped the compound and knocked out the area's electrical supply, Kenobi and Skywalker were freed, holding Ohnaka as a hostage using their lightsabers. Binks and his clone escort arrived, providing the Jedi with transport off Florrum. Though it surprised Ohnaka, Kenobi ordered Skywalker to let him go free, as Jedi do not take revenge—though warned that Dooku did not share their same mindset.[85]\n\nOrto Plutonia\n\nCalled to the cold planet Orto Plutonia to ascertain why the Republic had lost contact with a clone outpost, Kenobi and Skywalker, along with Pantoran Chairman Chi Cho and Senator Riyo Chuchi from the nearby moon Pantora, traveled to the Republic base. They found it to be to be devoid of life, as all clones stationed there having been killed—with a monument of their helmets erected inside. After visiting a nearby Separatist base, similar destruction was found, leading Kenobi to believe that the murders at the Republic's base were done by a third unknown party. Logs showed mysterious warriors had taken out the Separatist droids when investigating the world's southern canyon, which Kenobi decided would be a good starting point for their investigation.[86]\n\nWhen Skywalker and Kenobi headed to the location they met the leader of the Talz people Thi-Sen and their associates, communicating with the natives using rudimentary hand signals and drawings. The Jedi learned that battle droids had attacked the Talz and the clones were accidentally caught in the middle of the conflict. The pair returned to the Republic base, and knowing that the Talz only wanted peace, arranged a diplomatic meeting between the Pantorans and Talz. However, Chi Cho angrily refused to accept any peaceful outcome and provoked a war between him and Thi-Sen's people as he refused to accept peace despite the protests of Chuchi and the Jedi. He declared it an internal affair of Pantora to remove the Jedi from the equation, ordering them to submit to him because they were under the Senate's jurisdiction.[86]\n\nWhen Skywalker and Kenobi appealed to Chuchi to find a way to resolve the political matter diplomatically, she contacted the Speaker of the Pantoran Assembly who granted her the authority to negotiate peace and declared the Chairman out of order. Though Chuchi wanted the Jedi to negotiate on Pantora's behalf, they refused, as it was her people who the Talz were warring with. However, the solution came too late as Chi Cho was attacked before Kenobi, Skywalker, and Chuchi landed and halted the Talz's attack. To settle the conflict between the Pantorans and the Talz, Chuchi met with Thi-Sen, establishing an agreement that allowed the Talz to live in peace on the planet. As the Senator and the Jedi boarded a gunship off-world, Kenobi congratulated the Senator in establishing peace and urged her to make it last and act as an example to others.[86] The Jedi Master felt that the peace achieved through the balancing of both sides had been a unique challenge.[55]\n\nBlue Shadow Virus\n\nThe Jedi Council later agreed to send Kenobi, Skywalker, and Tano, to Naboo in response to intelligence that suggested that a Separatist bio-lab had been set up on the planet at Amidala's suggestion. When Amidala and Binks lost contact while searching for the lab, Skywalker sent Tano along with the Gungan native Peppi Bow to locate them. Meanwhile, Kenobi and Skywalker arrived on Naboo learned from new information discovered by Captain Gregar Typho that Separatist scientist Nuvo Vindi was using the lab to perfect the deadly Blue Shadow Virus so as to release it into key Republic star systems. Kenobi and Skywalker proceeded to plan an infiltration of the facility to prevent the virus from being spread across the galaxy.[88]\n\nWhile they waited in the hangar bay, Kenobi took note of Skywalker's increased levels of agitation during the mission. After being contacted by Tano, Kenobi and Skywalker left instructions for her to cause a diversion. On the other side of the lab, the pair entered and met with her before beginning a search for Vindi's viral bombs. Kenobi located the room where the bombs were held with his clone troopers, instructing his men to deactivate them all. Though Vindi attempted to release the virus, the Jedi were able to apprehend him and rescue Amidala and Binks.[88]\n\nAs Kenobi and Skywalker prepared to transfer Vindi to Coruscant for trial, Tano, Amidala, and several clones discovered that a vial of the virus was missing. Though the alarm was sounded prior to the vial's detonation, the virus was released throughout the lab. Tano, Amidala, and the clones with them were compromised and infected by the virus. As they worked to ensure droids would not escape the facility, Skywalker and Kenobi implored the Naboo as to what the cure for the virus was. Upon learning it, the Jedi then flew to planet Iego to search for the reeksa root antidote to the virus found there.[87]\n\nWhile on Iego, Skywalker destroyed a number of reprogrammed battle droids owned by the local native Jaybo Hood, which Kenobi chided him for. Hood then told the pair where to find the antidote they were looking for, though warned it was dangerous. The young man also informed the Jedi that the phantom leader of Iego, Drol, would not allow any individual to leave the planet. Kenobi and Skywalker rode a xandu to the bottom of a ravine and quickly gathered some reeksa root before escaping from the carnivorous plant. Upon trying to leave Iego, the two Jedi discovered that \"Drol\" was actually a Separatist laser security system surrounding the planet and enlisted Hood's help in destroying it despite the skepticism of the other natives. When successful, Kenobi and Skywalker traveled back to Naboo and delivered the antidote that saved Tano, Amidala, and the clone troopers. Kenobi also offered Binks blaster training to hone his skills, which the Gungan enthusiastically accepted.[87] After the event, the Jedi Master became more keenly aware of Skywalker's emotional instability when around Amidala and resolved to watch the pair more closely as the war continued.[55]\n\nInvasion of Ryloth\n\nAfter the Techno Union leader Wat Tambor seized control of the planet Ryloth and its inhabitants, he implemented a blockade around the world with his Lucrehulk-class Battleship and two Munificent-class frigates. The Jedi Council devised a plan for Kenobi and Windu to lead a ground assault to invade and liberate the planet after the Senate requested them to intervene. Skywalker and Tano were dispatched to destroy the Separatist blockade surrounding the planet to support their effort.[90]\n\nThe initial attempt to break the blockade was unsuccessful, which Skywalker reported to Kenobi and Windu as a heavy loss through hologram, considering the deceased clone pilots and sacrifice of the Venator-class Star Destroyer Redeemer. Kenobi advised him to give Tano time to grieve the loss of her squadron, but added that he would need her assistance to complete their objectives. Windu informed Skywalker that he needed to break the blockade within the next planetary rotation for the invasion to continue. When Skywalker and Tano's second attempt is successful, Kenobi arrived with the rest of the invasion forces in the planet's vicinity. Kenobi contacted Tano and she cleared them to begin their ground assault.[90]\n\nIn preparing their assault, Windu asked Kenobi to consider capturing the city Nabat first to secure a landing zone, which he agreed to. Kenobi then boarded a small transport with some of his men from Ghost Company and instructed them to do minimal damage to the local habitat and not harm natives. In space, the rest of Windu's fleet came under attack by Separatist forces. Windu contacted Kenobi and informed him that the Republic would be unable to use Acclamator-class transgalactic military assault ships and other gunships from Crumb Bomber until the Separatist surface proton cannons were wiped out.[89]\n\nKenobi and his men landed and steadily made their way to the outskirts of the city, taking out droids as they went. Using telekinesis, the Jedi helped levitate the droid poppers thrown by his troopers Waxer and Boil to take out a bunker. After securing the wall perimeter Kenobi ordered Cody to send his best men to scout ahead, and the commander ultimately selected Waxer, Boil, and Wooley. Scouting yielded useful intelligence, leading Cody to report to Kenobi and Windu the placements of the gun encampments as well as the Separatists' use of living Twi'lek shields. However, one of the tactical droid commander TX-20's probe droids recorded their strategy session and provided it to the leader. When Waxer and Boil failed to report in from scouting after meeting the Twi'lek child Numa, Kenobi became concerned.[89]\n\nThe general and his troops decided to move forward without the missing troopers, entering the village outskirts. They soon encountered starved native gutkurrs that began to attack them. The Jedi lured the creatures into an alley using the Force so that the clones could trap them by collapsing a bridge between them. Shortly after, a pothole near them began to rattle, though Kenobi ordered his men to hold fire. When Waxer and Boil then emerged out of an underground tunnel with Numa, Kenobi talked to the girl in Twi'leki and learned that she could lead them to the prisoners. Tasking Cody with creating a diversion for the droids, Kenobi went with Waxer, Boil, and Numa to the underground passages and freed the Twi'lek hostages who fled into the tunnels.[89]\n\nThen, the general proceeded to take control of a proton cannon and managed to take out their cannons with the help of Waxer and Boil loading fuel cartridges in. However, TX-20 blasted the three aside and threatened Kenobi, who was holding Numa in his arms. Before the droid could blast them, other Twi'leks rushed the droid and protected Kenobi, with the Jedi attempting to shield Numa's eyes from the violence. As Windu's transports from the Acclamatorlanded, Windu commended Kenobi on his victory and they continued with their next mission.[89]\n\nAs the Republic's forces departed for the capital city Lessu Waxer and Boil inquired Kenobi about the meaning of \"nerra,\" which the Jedi General translated as \"brother.\"[89] After Windu and and his forces reached Lessu, Kenobi led his contingent to capture the southern hemisphere of Ryloth and was able to successfully capture the Jixuan desert. With Windu taking Lessu and capturing Wat Tambor, the two Jedi Generals freed the planet from Separatist rule.[91]\n\nA stolen holocron\n\nDuring the First Battle of Felucia, Kenobi was sent along with Skywalker and Tano to the Separatist-invaded planet Felucia. While Kenobi stayed with the main body of troops to defend their clearing-based emplacement of AT-TE walkers, Tano led two AT-TE walkers and a Juggernaut tank on a patrol of the dense jungle. Kenobi realized that they were outnumbered, seeing that droids would soon outflank their position. He ordered an immediate retreat as soon as General Koon arrived to help them, prompting clones to prepare gunships for fleeing. The Jedi Master contacted Tano to do so as well, but the Padawan refused to retreat—claiming her foes were retreating. When Skywalker and Kenobi arrived to pick her up, she refused to pull back until Skywalker convinced her that the battle was lost. As their gunship flew away, Kenobi, Skywalker, and Tano observed the position she had been at erupt in flames.[92]\n\nOnce back at the Jedi Temple, Kenobi reported to rest of the Jedi Council about Tano's reckless actions during the battle. As a result, she was assigned to guard duty in the Jedi Archives under the supervision of Jocasta Nu. Kenobi and Skywalker attended a strategy session after the meeting to discuss the effects of Felucia's loss. As they talked, Yoda felt a disturbance in the Force and warned the pair that there would be intruders in the Temple soon. Kenobi and Skywalker surmised that any intruders would likely be breaking in to steal Jedi transmitter codes and military information, and set out to protect the communications center. However by using the assistance of the helper droid Todo 360, the bounty hunter Cad Bane managed to sneak into the Temple. The Jedi pair noticed their systems rebooting and acting strangely and located a disturbance in the Temple's ventilation shafts with advice from Yoda.[92]\n\nKenobi and Skywalker discovered the vent Bane had entered, but were unable to locate the criminal despite their best efforts. Yoda informed them that their intruders were deep in the Temple and had likely received outside help. From the Archives, Tano captured Bane's changeling associate Cato Parasitti and informed the pair of this. Kenobi and Skywalker assumed that Bane would try to access the communications tower from the Holocron Vault and headed to the tower. Bane took the opportunity to steal a Jedi holocron and sneak out of the building while Kenobi and Skywalker narrowly avoided a bomb set off by Todo 360 in the ventilation shafts. Parasitti revealed Bane's next target would be the Jedi Bolla Ropal, the keeper of a kyber memory crystal that stored the names of every Force-sensitive child in the galaxy. Kenobi then proceeded to lead Parasitti away while Skywalker and Tano set out to warn Ropal.[92]\n\nPursuit on Rodia\n\nBane managed to capture and torture Ropal, only stopping when Jedi arrived on his ship. Despite Skywalker and Tano's best efforts, the criminal escaped in his ship.[94] Both reported back to Kenobi and Yoda afterward, who worried about the future harm done to the children on the list. Kenobi and other Jedi meditated to sense through the Force which children would be harmed first, coming up with a small list of locations for their efforts—including a child on[93] the planet[5] Rodia that he sensed. Kenobi then flew to the planet and met the Rodian Mahtee Dunn, the child's mother, and informed her that her child Wee Dunn had been taken by a bounty hunter posing as a Jedi. He caught up to Bane shortly after while he was holding the child while using a Jedi cloak as a disguise.[93]\n\nUsing a grappling hook, Kenobi pursued Bane across several rooftops, but eve"
