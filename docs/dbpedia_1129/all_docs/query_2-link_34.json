        "text": "Find The Right Car Seat\n\nCar Seat Types\n\nLearn about the four types of car seats, while keeping in mind the following tips:\n\nAs children grow, how they sit in your car will change. Make sure you use a car seat that fits your child’s current size and age.\n\nNot all car seats fit in all vehicles. Make sure the car seat is the right fit for your vehicle (PDF, 1.77 MB). Test the car seat you plan to buy to make sure it fits well in your vehicle.\n\nBuy a car seat that can be installed and used correctly every time.\n\nRear-Facing Car Seat\n\nThe best seat for your young child to use. It has a harness and, in a crash, cradles and moves with your child to reduce the stress to the child's fragile neck and spinal cord.\n\nTypes\n\nInfant Car Seat (Rear-Facing only): Designed for newborns and small babies, the infant-only car seat is a small, portable seat that can only be used rear-facing. Most babies outgrow their infant seats before their first birthday. When that happens, we recommend that parents purchase a convertible or all-in-one car seat and use it rear-facing.\n\nConvertible Seat: As a child grows, this seat can change from a rear-facing seat to a forward-facing seat with a harness and tether. Because it can be used with children of various sizes, it allows for children to stay in the rear-facing position longer.\n\nAll-in-One Seat: This seat can change from a rear-facing seat to a forward-facing seat (with a harness and tether) and to a booster seat as a child grows. Because it can be used with children of various sizes, it allows for children to stay in the rear-facing position longer.\n\nForward-Facing Car Seat\n\nHas a harness and tether that limits your child's forward movement during a crash.\n\nTypes\n\nConvertible Seat: As a child grows, this seat can change from a rear-facing seat to a forward-facing seat with a harness and tether.\n\nCombination Seat: As a child grows, this seat transitions from a forward-facing seat with a harness and tether into a booster.\n\nAll-in-One Seat: This seat can change from a rear-facing seat to a forward-facing seat (with a harness and tether) and to a booster seat as a child grows.\n\nBooster Seat\n\nRaises and positions a child so the vehicle’s lap-and-shoulder belt fits properly over the stronger points of a child’s body, the hips and across the chest.\n\nTypes\n\nBooster Seat With High Back: This type of booster seat is designed to boost the child’s height so the seat belt fits properly. It also provides neck and head support and is ideal for vehicles that don’t have head rests or high seat backs.\n\nBackless Booster Seat: A backless booster seat is designed to boost the child’s height so the seat belt fits properly. It does not provide head and neck support. It is ideal for vehicles that have head rests.\n\nCombination Seat: As a child grows, this seat transitions from a forward-facing seat with a harness into a booster.\n\nAll-in-One Seat: This seat can change from a rear-facing seat to a forward-facing seat (with a harness and tether) and to a booster seat as a child grows.\n\nSeat Belt\n\nShould lie across the upper thighs and be snug across the shoulder and chest to restrain your child safely in a crash. It should not rest on the stomach area or across the neck or face.\n\nFind The Right Car Seat\n\nCar Seat Recommendations\n\nThere are many car seat choices on the market. Use the information below to help you choose the type of car seat that best meets your child’s needs or print out NHTSA’s car seat recommendations for children (PDF, 370 KB).\n\nSelect a car seat based on your child’s age and size, then choose a seat that fits in your vehicle, and use it every time.\n\nAlways refer to your specific car seat manufacturer’s instructions (check height and weight limits) and read the vehicle owner’s manual on how to install the car seat using the seat belt or lower anchors and a tether, if available.\n\nTo maximize safety, keep your child in the car seat for as long as possible, as long as the child fits within the manufacturer’s height and weight requirements.\n\nKeep your child in the back seat at least through age 12.\n\nRecommended car seats based on your child's age and size\n\nRear-Facing Car Seat\n\nBirth-12 Months\n\nYour child under age 1 should always ride in a rear-facing car seat. There are different types of rear-facing car seats:\n\nInfant-only seats can only be used rear-facing.\n\nConvertible and all-in-one car seats typically have higher height and weight limits for the rear-facing position, allowing you to keep your child rear-facing for a longer period of time.\n\n1 – 3 Years\n\nKeep your child rear-facing as long as possible. It’s the best way to keep him or her safe. Your child should remain in a rear-facing car seat until he or she reaches the top height or weight limit allowed by your car seat’s manufacturer. Once your child outgrows the rear-facing car seat, your child is ready to travel in a forward-facing car seat with a harness and tether.\n\nForward-Facing Car Seat\n\n1 – 3 Years\n\nKeep your child rear-facing as long as possible. It’s the best way to keep him or her safe. Your child should remain in a rear-facing car seat until he or she reaches the top height or weight limit allowed by your car seat’s manufacturer. Once your child outgrows the rear-facing car seat, your child is ready to travel in a forward-facing car seat with a harness and tether.\n\n4 – 7 Years\n\nKeep your child in a forward-facing car seat with a harness and tether until he or she reaches the top height or weight limit allowed by your car seat’s manufacturer. Once your child outgrows the forward-facing car seat with a harness, it’s time to travel in a booster seat, but still in the back seat.\n\nBooster Seat\n\n4 – 7 Years\n\nKeep your child in a forward-facing car seat with a harness and tether until he or she reaches the top height or weight limit allowed by your car seat’s manufacturer. Once your child outgrows the forward-facing car seat with a harness, it’s time to travel in a booster seat, but still in the back seat.\n\n8 – 12 Years\n\nKeep your child in a booster seat until he or she is big enough to fit in a seat belt properly. For a seat belt to fit properly the lap belt must lie snugly across the upper thighs, not the stomach. The shoulder belt should lie snugly across the shoulder and chest and not cross the neck or face. Remember: your child should still ride in the back seat because it’s safer there.\n\nSeat Belt\n\n8 – 12 Years\n\nKeep your child in a booster seat until he or she is big enough to fit in a seat belt properly.

Before you install your car seat, make sure you’re familiar with vehicle and car seat parts used in the installation process and these important installation safety tips.\n\nVehicle and Car Seat Parts Explained\n\nEvery car seat needs to be installed using either the lower anchors or a seat belt to secure it in place, never both. If you choose to use a seat belt to install your car seat, pay close attention to how to “lock” your seat belt according to the vehicle’s owner manual. With a forward-facing car seat, use a tether if one is available. Before installing your car seat make sure you understand the function and location of the vehicle and car seat parts that are used in installation.\n\nCar Seat Glossary\n\nVehicle Parts\n\nLower Anchors\n\nUsed for installing a car seat using its lower anchor attachments\n\nThe lower anchors are found in a minimum of two rear seating positions in a vehicle. Each lower-anchor-equipped seating position has two small horizontal bars found in the space between the vehicle seat’s back and bottom cushion (the “seat bight”).\n\nTether Anchor\n\nUsed for attaching a car seat's tether to the vehicle\n\nTypically there are a minimum of three tether anchors in a vehicle. In sedans, these are usually located above/behind the vehicle’s back seat on the rear shelf. In some larger vehicles such as vans, pickup trucks, and SUVs, these tether anchors may be found on the back of a vehicle seat, on the floor, the ceiling, or other location.\n\nTo avoid confusing tether anchors with other hardware such as luggage tie-downs, be sure to read your vehicle’s owner manual carefully to find out where they are located in your particular vehicle.\n\nCar Seat Parts\n\nAttach top tether from the car seat to the tether anchor in the vehicle.\n\nFasten lower anchor attachments on the car seat to the lower anchors in the vehicle.\n\nLower Anchor Attachments\n\nUsed to install the car seat in a vehicle with lower anchors\n\nTether\n\nUsed to secure a forward-facing car seat and limit forward head movement in a crash\n\nThe tether is located on the top rear of convertible, combination, and all-in-one car seats. It’s adjustable and has a hook and strap that connects to one of your vehicle’s tether anchors. Most rear-facing car seats in the United States do not use a tether for installation. However, installations vary from model to model, so you must review your particular car seat’s instructions and your vehicle’s owner manual carefully.\n\nFollow your car seat manufacturer’s instructions regarding when and how to use the tether for your particular seat. NHTSA recommends always using a tether with a forward-facing car seat—installed with your vehicle’s seat belt OR the lower anchors—as long as it is permitted by both the car seat and vehicle manufacturers. IMPORTANT: Both installation methods are designed to work with the tether to achieve the highest level of safety for child passengers restrained in forward-facing car seats.\n\nLower Anchor Weight Limits\n\nLower anchors have weight limits set by the vehicle and car seat manufacturers. You can determine the lower anchor weight limit by checking the warning label or installation diagrams located on the side of the car seat. If your car seat does not have a label, you can determine the maximum allowable child weight for lower anchor use by subtracting the weight of the car seat (usually available in the car seat’s instruction manual) from 65 pounds.\n\nLower anchor weight limit = 65 lbs – weight of car seat\n\nKnow the Facts\n\nOnce your child outgrows the vehicle or car seat manufacturer’s established limits for the lower anchors, stop using the lower anchor attachments and reinstall the car seat using the vehicle’s seat belt."
