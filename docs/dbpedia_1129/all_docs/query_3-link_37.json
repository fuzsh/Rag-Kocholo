        "text": "UPDATE April 26, 2023: A lot has changed since I first published this article in 2012. In the last 10 years, we have seen an expansion of resources for finding rep, MusicNotes.com has drastically expanded its library, and vocal coaches are no longer relying on the Singer’s Anthology series. I am leaving this article for reference, but I no longer think this list is necessary. Instead, I would like to direct you to a newer article about “Do Not” lists. Thanks for checking out the blog! ~ Matt\n\n———\n\nNOTE: I am receiving large numbers of requests for feedback on audition pieces. My schedule no longer allows me to respond to every request in a timely manner. I will still try to respond to requests, but I may approve your comment and leave it on the website for others to respond before I can personally chime in. Thanks for checking out the site! ~Matt\n\n“DO NOT” lists can be controversial but can also be a great starting place to figure out if your singing something everyone else will be singing as well. The following serve as a starting place for your rep search. I will update this list as I receive updates from agents, colleagues, etc.\n\nIn general:\n\nNothing with excessive profanity\n\nNothing that puts yourself up on a pedestal/says look at me! (i.e. Gorgeous from Apple Tree)\n\nNothing with excessive sexual innuendo\n\nDo not play a mentally challenged person\n\nDo not ask rhetorical questions of a sexual nature to the audition panel\n\nNothing from a current Broadway show\n\nNothing made famous by a specific artist (i.e. Barbara Streisand or Kristin Chenoweth)\n\nFrom a top agent in NYC:\n\nAnything Jason Robert Brown\n\nAnything from Phantom of the Opera\n\nGirl in 14 G\n\nTaylor the Latte Boy\n\nGorgeous (Apple Tree)\n\nTake a Chance on Me\n\nRun Away with Me\n\nI Gotta Run\n\nNeverland (Scott Alan)\n\nMama Says\n\nForest for the Trees\n\nNot for the Life of Me\n\nGimme Gimme\n\neverything from Wild Party\n\nScrew Loose\n\nPrivilege to Pee\n\nHere I Am\n\nAstonishing\n\nShow off\n\nOverused selections (This is not always as important for college auditions, but it can serve as a warning and you may want to bring other songs. If the song is perfect for you, its probably ok for a college audition if its on the list below, for the list above, its probably not a good idea regardless of how well you sing it.)\n\nAll I need is the girl\n\nAlways true to you\n\nAnyone Can whistle\n\nAt times like this\n\nBeing Alive\n\nCorner of the sky\n\nHow ’bout a dance?\n\nI’m not that smart\n\nIn a very unusual way\n\nIn my life\n\nIt hurts me\n\nJohanna\n\nNot for the life of me\n\nNot while I’m around\n\nNotice me, Horton\n\nOn the street where you live\n\nSara Lee\n\nShe Loves Me\n\nShould I be Sweet (or Hot)\n\nDon’t rain on my parade\n\nEasy Money\n\nEverybody’s girl\n\nExtraordinary\n\nFifty Percent (50%)\n\nForget about the boy\n\nGimme Gimme\n\nGoodbye, old girl\n\nGood Think Going\n\nGorgeous\n\nHome (Beauty and the Beast)\n\nHome from Phantom\n\nI cain’t say no\n\nI enjoy being a girl\n\nI met a girl\n\nI wanna be bad\n\nIce Cream\n\nLife of the Party\n\nLonely Town\n\nLook what happened to Mabel\n\nLost in the wilderness\n\nLove Look Away\n\nLuck be a lady\n\nMamma Says\n\nMan Wanted\n\nMany a new day\n\nMaybe this time\n\nMeadowlark\n\nMemory\n\nMiracle of Miracles\n\nMy new philosophy\n\nMy white night\n\nNo man left for me\n\nNobody does it like me\n\nShow me\n\nStranger to the rain\n\nTake a chance on me\n\nThat’ll show him\n\nThe Story Goes on\n\nTonight at 8\n\nWaiting for life to begin\n\nWhat do I need with love\n\nWhat is it about her?\n\nWhat you’d call a dream\n\nWhen did I fall in love\n\nWhen will my life begin (from Tangled)\n\nWherever he ain’t\n\nYes, my heart\n\nYou can always count on me\n\nYou’ve got possibilities\n\nShows to watch out for:\n\nAnnie\n\nBaby\n\nSecret Garden\n\nChildren of Eden\n\nThe movie “Fame”\n\nGodspell\n\nThoroughly Modern Millie (this one applies to college too)\n\nPhantom of the Opera (this one applies to college too)\n\nAny Disney films\n\nThe Fantasticks\n\nWicked\n\nTop Monologues:\n\nJoan Cusack’s monologue (Is there, oh, ANY OTHER TIME you could have told me this?) — this has been VERY popular for at least three years now. Give it a rest.\n\nSqueaky Fromme from Assassins\n\nDarleen Dances\n\nBridal Registry from A My Name is Still Alice\n\nBelize’s monologue about the national anthem from Angels in America\n\nMom’s Ashes from I Think I Love You — I can’t BELIEVE this is STILL so popular… it is really getting ridiculous\n\nMurder Your Fish/Mess up your life a little… don’t know what it’s from but it must be in a monologue book somewhere because HOLY COW\n\nDiana from Moving (Quaker school… awards… someone is going to prick your bubble)\n\nAnything from Kellie Powell’s website (notmyshoes.net) – she’s a great person, lately every 1 out of 5 female auditionees at SU has a monologue from her site.\n\nFrom: http://www.musicaltheatreaudition.com/performance/auditions/overdoneauditionsongs.html\n\nGood Morning Baltimore from Hairspray\n\nOn My Own from Les Miserables\n\nAdelaide’s Lament from Guys and Dolls (why are teenagers always singing this? the character has been engaged for 14 years!)\n\nMemory from Cats\n\nI Hate Men from Kiss Me Kate\n\nAll That Jazz from Chicago\n\nWash That Man… from South Pacific\n\nCan’t Help Lovin’… from Show Boat\n\nBig Spender from Sweet Charity\n\nYou Can Always… from City of Angels\n\nShy from Once Upon a Mattress\n\nTomorrow from Annie\n\nI Enjoy Being A Girl from Flower Drum Song\n\nBroadway Baby, Hard Hearted Hannah, Hit Me With a Hot Note from Follies\n\nSurrey With The Fringe On Top & I Can’t Say No from Oklahoma\n\nThey Call the Wind Mariah from Paint Your Wagon\n\nCorner of the Sky from Pippin\n\nSummertime from Porgy & Bess\n\nThe Music of the Night from The Phantom of the Opera\n\nHero & Let’s Hear It For The Boy from Footloose\n\nSeasons of Love from Rent\n\nBig Spender from Sweet Charity\n\nPart Of Your World from The Little Mermaid\n\nIn My Own Little Corner from Cinderella\n\nPopular from Wicked\n\nAnthem from Chess\n\nThis Is The Moment from Jekyll & Hyde\n\nOverdone Audition Songs Not Associated With A Specific Show\n\nI Get a Kick Out of You\n\nMiss Bird\n\nEmbracable You\n\nNew York, New York\n\nOverdone Shows That Directors Are Sick Of\n\nAny show that the company you are auditioning for has done in the last five years.\n\nWhatever the “Hot New Musical” is… right now it’s Wicked\n\nThe Sound of Music\n\nA Chorus Line\n\nRent\n\nMy Fair Lady\n\nTitanic\n\nFootloose\n\nGrease\n\nJekyll & Hyde\n\nLittle Shop of Horrors\n\nThe Fantastiks\n\nLes Miserables\n\nPhantom of the Opera\n\nEvita\n\nAlmost everything by Andrew Lloyd Webber\n\nWatch Out For… Songs that are Problematic\n\n(These songs may not necessarily be overdone, but have something that may make them inappropriate for auditions)\n\nOver The Rainbow fom The Wizard of Oz (this song belongs to Judy Garland)\n\nAny other “Signature Song”\n\nOne Last Thought\n\nAlmost every voice teacher in this country owns the Musical Theatre Anthology published by Hal Leonard. If the song you are planning to use is out of that book, there’s a strong possibility its overdone (not always) but if every voice teacher owns it, your odds for hearing others sing it are high. To increase your chances of finding something unique, try finding songs from books specific to a certain show (i.e. Vocal Selections from Aida). If you have a library in your home town, try looking for complete vocal piano scores of Golden Age shows. Also, remember most schools are only looking for a cut. If there is a part of a larger ensemble piece or duet, but it makes a good cut, you can use it.\n\n~Matt\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
