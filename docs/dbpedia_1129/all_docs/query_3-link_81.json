Brown is set to go in heat four.\n\nShe will hope to book her place in the final, which will take place at 4:30pm later in the day.\n\nHow to watch Sky Brown at Olympics\n\nTV channel: In the UK, the women’s park will be shown on BBC and Eurosport.\n\nLive stream: Subscribers can visit the discovery+ | Paris 2024 app and website to watch the fight in full, while BBC’s coverage schedule has not yet been confirmed."
