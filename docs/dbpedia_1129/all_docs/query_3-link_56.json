        "text": "This is an oft repeated them and I think if you cast back a few threads you will see that in my case Bowie was the absolute soundtrack to my youth and teenage years. His music changed almost in time with the changes I was going through as well, he created a series of outstanding albums from IMHO 1968 through to 1980, so from when I was 4 to 16 or thereabouts. Maybe 17. He then had a smattering of good singles, some awful albums and in his latter period some great work again.\n\nHis records are the soundtrack to my life, I cannot think of any major event in my life that does not have Bowie as the musical backdrop. I have every record he ever made, including as far as I can tell every collaboration and soundtrack appearance, obscure appearances, you name it.\n\nBut.....when I think of him I think of three things:\n\nA summer staying with my Granny. I had three tapes. The Space Oddity tape, Stage and Low.\n\nA trip on ss Uganda where I must have annoyed everyone putting on Boys Keep Swinging on the Jukebox, wonder if Miss Fillyouarky was on that trip....\n\nThe Ashes To Ashes single and my wee pal and I trying to get all four of the stamp inserts in the singles from our local Woolies.\n\nGreat memories.\n\nBowie - anything.\n\nMy teenage years were spent in the late 60's and early seventies - a period much derided because it is synonymous with prog - but much else was happening.Conversely, the list of things below my pals and myself were into is testament to the quality of the music going on around us and which we justifiably thought fantastic. Matter of fact,if anything, we were privileged.\n\n1968:\n\nMartha My Dear - The Beatles (White Album)\n\nBorn Under A Bad Sign - Cream (Wheels Of Fire)\n\nEverlasting Love - the Love Affair\n\n1969\n\nI Talk To the Wind - King Crimson (In The Court Of the Crimson King - I bought it of for the cover, and fell in love with it)\n\nSon Of A Preacher Man - Dusty Springfield\n\nGood Times,Bad Times - Led Zeppelin - (Led Zeppelin)\n\nPinball Wizard - The Who\n\nTickets To Waterfalls - Jack Bruce (Songs For A Tailor)\n\nNever Comes The Day - The Moody Blues - (On The Threshold Of A Dream)\n\nBehind A Painted Smile - The Islay Brothers (from the world's best ever compilation album- Motown Chartbusters Vol 3)\n\nBadge - Cream - (Goodbye Cream)\n\nThe Stomp - Ten Years After - (Schush)\n\n1970\n\nKeep The Customers Satisfied - Simon & Garfunkel (Bridge Over Troubled Water)\n\nDon't Say You Love Me - Free (Fire & Water)\n\nWhen You Dance - Neil Young (After The Goldrush)\n\nWhat Is Life - George Harrison (All Things Must Pass)\n\nSpirit In The Sky - Norman Greenbaum\n\n1971\n\nGimme Some Truth - John Lennon (Imagine)\n\nReason To Believe - Rod Stewart (Every Picture Tells A Story)\n\nInner City Blues - Marvin Gaye - (What's Goin' On)\n\nHot Love - T Rex\n\nWild Horses - The Rolling Stones\n\nMy Wife - The Who - Who's Next\n\nDouble Barrel - Dave & Ansel Collins\n\nStarship Trooper - Yes (The Yes Album)\n\nMeet Me On The Corner - Lindisfarne - (Fog On The Tyne)\n\n1972\n\nMoonage Daydream - David Bowie - (Ziggy Stardust)\n\nRip This Joint - The Rolling Stones - (Exile On Main Street)\n\nDirty Work - Steely Dan -(Can't Buy A Thrill)\n\nI Saw The Light - Todd Rundgren - (Something/Anything)\n\nSupper's Ready - Genesis - (Foxtrot)\n\nPerfect Day - Lou Reed - (Transformer)\n\n1973\n\nDo The Strand - Roxy Music - (For Your Pleasure)\n\nLet Me Roll It- Paul McCartney (Band On The Run)\n\nSylvia - Focus - (Focus 3?)\n\nUs And Them - Pink Floyd - Dark Side of The Moon\n\n1974\n\nFor A Dancer - Jackson Browne - (Late For The Sky)\n\nWall Street Shuffle - 10CC - (Sheet Music)\n\nHelp Me - Joni Mitchell - (Court & Spark)\n\nYou Got It - Average White Band (Average White Band)\n\nMidnight At The Oasis -Maria Muldaur\n\nRock Your Baby - George (and Gwen?) McCrae\n\nthat'll do,\n\nregardez youse\n\nhenri\n\nfascinating list, Henri, particularly as I would second pretty much all your 60s songs - and then diverge completely for the 70s. Wonder how that happened?\n\nWell anyway, how on earth do you sum up the teenage years in one song? A time of life choreographed to an endless stream of music from Luxembourg, radio 1, Top of the Pops, LPs listened to in friends' houses, LPs bought with Saturday/summer job money, jukeboxes in cafes and pubs - impossible task\n\nMotown obsession\n\nGet ready - the Temptations\n\nradio 1\n\nLike a Rolling Stone - Bob Dylan\n\nAlan Freeman's Saturday rock show\n\nRock & Roll Hoochie Koo - Rick Derringer\n\nXL cafe jukebox\n\nToo Busy Thinking About my Baby - Marvin Gaye\n\nKettledrum jukebox\n\nThe Mighty Quinn - Manfred Mann\n\nTOTP\n\nWhole Lotta Love - Led Zeppelin\n\nPaddleboat jukebox\n\nBellbottom Blues - Eric Clapton\n\nfriend's house\n\nEmpty Rooms - John Mayall\n\nborrowed LP\n\nHere they Come - Ten Years After\n\nle disco, la Baule\n\nDon't let me Down - the Beatles\n\nand on and on\n\nMy teenage years began in Nov 74 and ended in Nov 81. During that time I would earn street cred amongst my school classmates as the one who would nip home tues lunchtimes and write down the new chart and deliver it to my classmates in the afternoon. We had four record shops in Airdrie, Menzies, Boots, Woolies and Mills* and every week I would use pocket money to buy 3 or 4 ex chart singles from the 35p box. Much cheaper than current chart singles. The downside was wanting a song I Loved to drop out the chart so I could buy it. My singles collection grew rapidly until I was raiding Fine Fare Supermarket* for the right size of cardboard boxes to house them all. They were my ticket to a few teenage parties at the time. And then came the coloured vinyls, the laser etches, the picture discs and shock horror the weird and wonderful shaped singles that wouldn't fit neatly into my alphabetically arranged boxes. Albums were something you bought from birthday and record tokens and latterly from student grants.\n\nI could list a hundred reasons for a hundred different songs but I'm gonna pick one I've never heard on the tranny before. I first heard it sung at a Scout Camp by a guy with a guitar around 1975 and managed to get a tape copy of it. So many of my mates got to know that song through that tape until tapes of tapes were getting made and the quality got worse and worse. From that scout camp in 1975 to a drunken student all night party in the sand dunes at Nairn in July 1981 that song got laldy.\n\nI never actually owned it on vinyl till my 20's.\n\nIt'll Shine when it Shines / Ozark Mountain Daredevils\n\nYuletide felicitations,blogetariat!My early teenage years were spent listening to Radio Luxembourg and watching Ready Steady Go,Jukebox Jury and Thank your Lucky Stars.Always remember on Luxembourg some guy called Horace Bachelor spelling out Keynsham,thats K-E-Y-N-S-H-A-M!(You'd have to have been around then to know what I'm on about!)There's a Bonzo Dog Do Da Band album of the same name!First lps were Bob Dylan's \"Bringing It All Back Home\" and like Henri a great Motown compilation called \"Hitsville USA\"with really early(US) hits like Brenda Holloway's \"Every Little Bit Hurts\"and the Temptations\"The Way You Do the Things You Do\".Would be great to hear any of these two or Dylan's\"Love minus Zero\"Cheers, Willie Bartke\n\nBilly Bragg -- \"The Saturday Boy\"\n\nI was 15 when I first heard that one. I feel like my life was never quite the same again after hearing it -- it's so funny, sad, and true. All these years later, it's amazing being in the crowd at his shows when Billy does this one, with everybody there singing along and reliving the adolescent traumas that made them fall in love with this song in the first place.\n\nRich in North Carolina\n\nI have to agree most of the blog were teenagers at a much more musically interesting time than myself (and possibly most people younger than me, too). Which doesn't mean I don't look back on 80's music with some affection. Towards the end of that era I gave up on \"popular\" music. Call it a musical hiatus or hibernation - I was no longer feeding off my siblings' tastes and retreated into a more backwards-looking appreciation of other styles and eras. But that's for another night. Bated breath all round, I'm sure.............\n\nSongs from my teens - some special, others just memorable.\n\n1982\n\nIcehouse Hey Little Girl\n\n(My sister loved this - so did I)\n\n1983\n\nDown Under Men At Work\n\n(A very dear friend who bought this for my 14th. RIP, Sarah)\n\n1984\n\nFrankie Goes To Hollywood Relax\n\n(After It's Raining Men, my second dance with future husband. Red faces all round. My Christmases had all come at once. ;o))\n\n1985\n\nSimple Minds Don't You Forget About Me\n\nDon Henley The Boys of Summer\n\n1986\n\nRobert Palmer Addicted To Love\n\nCameo Word Up\n\n1987\n\nCrowded House Don't Dream It's Over\n\n1988\n\nS Express Theme from S'Express\n\nAye, that's more than enough of that.\n\n#21\n\nInteresting your should mention Gonzo, Willie: Smiffy bought her dad a hat for Xmas and when he put it on, he turned into the sax player in the Muppet band.\n\nBut I can't remember his name, so no longer know what to call my de facto father in law? He's staying with us, so I'd kinda like to be settled on the subject because it's bugging the hell out of me. I thought it was Floyd, but I think he's the guitarist?\n\nregardez vous\n\nhenri\n\nTeenage kicks...\n\n'76 to '82 saw Punk, New Wave, oh, aye & a MOD revival, Ska, Psychobilly & New Romantics.\n\nBlessed? that's matter of opinion!\n\nHere's my highlights...\n\n1976\n\nRoadrunner ~ T.
