        "text": "Civilization 4 is an epic of a game. The strategy game puts you in charge of a settlement and tasks you with expansion: Do you conquer everyone else? Control most of the land? Head to the stars? Become a world leader? A game with such lofty goals needs to begin strong. And for Civ 4, that meant starting with a musical epic: “Baba Yetu,” the game’s legendary title song created by freelance composer Christopher Tin.\n\nOriginally released in 2005 alongside the game, “Baba Yetu” has gone on to earn acclaim well beyond the video game industry, and will forever hold a place in its history. In 2009, Tin put the song on his classical album, Calling All Dawns. That inclusion made “Baba Yetu,” which Time Magazine called a “rousing, anthemic theme song,” eligible for a nomination at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards; on Feb. 13, 2011, it won, making “Baba Yetu” the first piece of music composed for a video game to win a Grammy. (It won “Best Instrumental Arrangement With Vocalist(s).”)\n\nTo this day, it’s still a major part of Tin’s life. In May, Tin and the Washington National Opera hosted the “Christopher Tin Sing-In” with the Washington Metropolitan Gamer Symphony Orchestra — an event that invited singers (and gamers) to sing along to Tin’s Civilization compositions. (Tin returned to the Civilization franchise with “Sogno di Volare” for Civilization 6, and he’s had a successful career as a composer in video games, movies, and elsewhere. You can hear his work in PGA 2K21, Splitgate, Civilization Online, and Karateka, among others.)\n\nTin recently told Polygon he was initially expecting around 150 people to register for the Civilization event. More than 1,200 ended up registering. “The event was a huge success, and we were able to introduce a lot of gamers to the opera world — and likewise, a lot of people in the opera community got their first taste of video game music as well,” he said.\n\nIn an email interview with Polygon, Tin discussed the creation of “Baba Yetu” for Civilization 4 and the impact of video game music. Tin himself was a fan of the original game, Civilization, and the sequels that followed; “Baba Yetu” was his first video game composition — and with it, he left a lasting legacy.\n\n[Ed. note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.]\n\nPolygon: What mood or themes were you looking to touch on when creating “Baba Yetu?”\n\nChristopher Tin: I’m a very visual person, and so much of “Baba Yetu” was inspired by the visual assets that Firaxis gave me. Specifically, they sent me an early rendering of the main menu screen, which was a video loop of the earth as seen from outer space. It was a shot of North Africa, and every 30 seconds or so the sun would rise over the horizon. It was beautiful and serene, and almost instantaneously the opening notes of the piece started playing in my head.\n\nFiraxis actually asked me to compose something that was a fusion between African gospel vocals, orchestra, and big cinematic percussion, so the overall sound world was already established from the start. I decided I wanted the music to take a more joyous tone, as that was already more idiomatic to African choral music.\n\nWas video game music respected among the wider music community when the song was released?\n\nCivilization 4 was released in 2005, and while there were definitely already fans of video game music, I would not say that it had the same broad cultural reach that it does now. There were certainly franchises and specific game composers who already had their fanbases (Nobuo Uematsu comes to mind) but broadly speaking, games weren’t as ubiquitous as they are today, and the ability for games to have recorded audio as their soundtracks (as opposed to general MIDI) was still relatively new. So it’s fair to say that for the most part, no, video game music was definitely not as respected from outside the industry as it is today.\n\nBack in 2005, the concept of a symphony concert devoted to video games was still very novel. The very year that Civilization 4 was released, in fact, was also the same year that Video Games Live (the longest running and most prolific video game music concert tour) did their first ever concert at the Hollywood Bowl. Since then the idea of a video game music concert has exploded, and we’re currently in a landscape with multiple touring video game music concert shows, and symphony orchestras around the world putting on dedicated video game music concerts (like the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra putting on a video game music concert for the prestigious summer Proms classical concert series in London). There are even many homegrown video game orchestras forming around the country (on my recent residency in Washington DC I did masterclasses with two dedicated game symphony orchestras in the DC area alone!). That speaks to the passion that people have for hearing video game music, but moreover, the fact that the orchestral music that speaks to many young classical musicians nowadays is actually video game soundtracks.\n\nWhat changed from 2005 to the Grammy win in 2011?\n\nThe big change between 2005, when “Baba Yetu” first came out, and the 2011 Grammys was less about game audio, in my opinion, and more about the spread of gaming in mainstream culture. 2006 was when the Wii came out, and suddenly gaming as a family was a thing. 2007 was when Apple launched the iPhone, and then suddenly mobile gaming was born. Then just a couple years later was the explosion of Facebook games like FarmVille. Gaming became more mainstream and ubiquitous, and I think more people started realizing that it was a rich industry full of highly creative people working on high-level artistic products.\n\nDo you feel like the Grammy win pushed the video game music industry forward?\n\nIt was a huge moment and honor for me personally, but I can’t claim any credit for pushing the industry forward. I think it was just a single moment in the ongoing history of game development. Gaming is the industry that currently attracts a lot of the most capable and creative minds in the world. I expect to see many more examples of gaming culture entering the mainstream.\n\nWhat are you up to now?\n\nI spent much of this summer in Washington DC where I had my first opera commission staged at the Kennedy Center. It was a completion of Giacomo Puccini’s “Turandot” — the last opera that he composed, which was left unfinished at the time of his death 100 years ago. I was commissioned alongside playwright Susan Soon He Stanton to write a new completion of the opera (the standard ending, composed by Franco Alfano 100 years ago, hasn’t aged particularly well).\n\nThe production got rave reviews and sold out its entire run, so I was incredibly honored to be a part of it. But the interesting thing is that I got the job because of my video game music! The artistic director of Washington National Opera, Francesca Zambello, was in her kitchen one day when she heard some classical music coming from her teenage son’s bedroom. She thought that was very uncharacteristic of him, and so she knocked on the door and asked what he was listening to. It turns out he was actually listening to my Civilization music! So she then went on to look me up, listen to my other music, and read up on my credentials. A few days later I got an email from her saying that she wanted to meet with me to discuss whether I’d be interested in composing an opera."
