        "text": "We’ll admit it first, getting your child to stand still for an accurate measurement of his or her feet is one of the biggest challenges in the process of buying kids shoes. And, it is not even possible to cheat, especially when it's when you are buying the first pair of pre-walker shoes for your baby's first steps. We have tried measuring while our child is lying down sleeping and did not get the right size.\n\nSo here are 3 easy yet accurate ways to measure your child’s feet to ensure that you don’t purchase the wrong sized shoes.\n\nHow to measure kids shoe size?\n\nTo have an accurate measurement, you should:\n\nmeasure both feet, as each foot may differ in length. Sizing should be based on the larger foot.\n\nmeasure feet with full body weight on them, equally. This ensures feet are at their largest when supporting body weight.\n\nHere, we compare three methods of measuring a child’s feet to see which gives us the closest fit for Two Little Feet’s kids shoe collection:\n\n1) Basic measurement\n\nItems needed: White A4 paper, pen/pencil, ruler, a wall\n\nSteps:\n\nPlace a piece of white A4 paper against the edge of a wall. Make sure the paper is level on the floor and against the wall edge.\n\nHave your child stand on the paper with the back of his/her heel touching the wall. Both feet should be squared with the full body weight resting equally on them.\n\nUse the ruler to draw a line where the longest toe ends.\n\nMeasure the distance between the end of the paper and the line drawn.\n\nFollow the same steps to measure the other feet. Take the longest measurement of both feet.\n\nOur results: 15.5cm length\n\nTo provide ample wiggling room for toes, Shoes' insole should be at least 16.5cm (1cm longer than foot length)\n\n2) Tracing/Footprint measurement\n\nItems needed: White or coloured A4 paper, pen/pencil, ruler.\n\nSteps:\n\nPlace paper on the floor and have your child stand equally on it.\n\nUse a pen or pencil to trace the outline of the feet.\n\nMeasure the the distance between the back of the heel and the longest toe. Make sure to measure both feet and take the longest measurement.\n\nOur results: 15.5cm length.\n\nTo provide ample wiggling room for toes, Shoes' insole should be at least 16.5cm (1cm longer than foot length)\n\n3) Foot ruler measurement\n\nItems needed: Kids foot ruler or the original Brannock Device\n\nSteps:\n\nPlace foot ruler on an even floor surface.\n\nHave your child step evenly on the ruler and take the measurement of both feet. Go with the longest measurement.\n\nOur results: 15.2 cm length\n\nTo provide ample wiggling room for toes, Shoes' insole should be at least 16.2cm (1cm longer than foot length)\n\nWith the above measurements, our child wears Kids Size 8.5 (insole length 16.6) for Sandals and Kids Size 9 (insole length 17.1cm) (with socks) for Shoes with her regular width feet.\n\nKids shoe size chart\n\nIf you’re still puzzled about how to measure or check your kid’s foot size, you could try to download our printable kids shoe size measurement chart to get a more accurate reading.\n\nOnce you have your child’s measurements, you can try out our size assistant below to get size recommendations for our shoes and sandals.\n\nAlternatively, if your child is already wearing shoes from another brand, you may convert the current shoe brand's size into ours using this Size Conversion Guide.\n\nNote: If the shoes still didn’t fit nicely on your kid, you could still enjoy a one-time shoe size exchange (T&C apply).\n\nDon’t forget to check out our children's shoe sizing update to better understand our sizing and find out about 5 tips when choosing children’s footwear as advised by a podiatrist.\n\nTips to measure kids shoe size\n\nHere are some other useful tips when measuring and buying children’s shoes:\n\nIt’s natural for feet to swell in the day so avoid measuring your child’s feet in the morning. It’s always best to try on new shoes when you’ve been up and about for a few hours.\n\nGive your child about 1cm from the end of the shoe to the full extended toe so that there is space for feet to grow.\n\nDo not get shoes that are too big as this can cause harm to foot development. Additionally, kids may trip and fall if shoes are too big.\n\nDo not get shoes that are too small either. If your child’s feet are in between sizes or two different sizes, go with the bigger size.\n\nStand, walk, jump, and dance. The best way to ensure a perfect fit is to have your child be active in them, rather than just stand and walk.\n\nSigns that your child’s shoes are too big\n\nA smaller shoe size may be needed if:\n\nYour child trips or twists the ankles frequently.\n\nYour child’s heel lifts off and out of the shoes when they are walking.\n\nYour child is dragging the feet.\n\nYou child’s walk is affected.\n\nYour child has blisters.\n\nSigns that your child’s shoes are too small\n\nA bigger size is most likely needed if:\n\nThe shoes are pressing deeply against your child’s skin.\n\nYour child has blisters.\n\nThere is no space in the toe box - your child’s feet are squished!\n\nYour child complains that the shoes are tight or uncomfortable. Knees, back, hip or joint pain can also be a sign of ill-fitting shoes.\n\nYour child doesn’t seem to want to wear the shoes anymore.\n\nHow often do you need to measure your child’s feet?\n\nChildren’s feet grow by half a size every three months on average. So it’s best to measure your child’s feet every three to four months to ensure that their current pair of shoes still fit well.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt’s important that your child wears shoes that fit them well as ill-fitting shoes can cause harm to their feet in addition to falls and accidents. If you’re unsure whether you’ve got the right size for them, check out our sizing guide today.\n\nDepending on your child's walking phases, pick your choice of footwear from our wide range of kids’ sneakers and sandals.
