        "text": "As dorky as the 1990s were, those among us that grew up with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the Backstreet Boys have a fond place in their hearts for the decade that provided the backdrop to their awkward adolescence. As such, it’s the perfect theme for an equally-dorky crawl to some of the city’s buzziest bars.\n\nThis weekend, you can relive your teenage years at the inaugural 90’s Bar Crawl. The roving boozefest, one of many scheduled across the country, encourages 90s babies to “saddle up their Furbies” for the country’s “largest 90s event.” Whatever that means, you know you’ve been dying for an opportunity to drag your Doc Martens out of the closet.\n\nThe festivities kick off at 504 Bar & Grill, where ticketholders will pick up a wristband that grants them access to dirt-cheap drink specials at venues across town, including The Quarter Bar, British Beverage Company, and Nickel & Rye. Each bar will offer themed drink specials at $2, $3, $4, and $5, perfect for getting sloshed on both nostalgia and shots."
