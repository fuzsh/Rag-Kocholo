        "text": "Click Here To Hear the New (And old) Watershed\n\n(this story is from Oct 2016, Watershed playing Ace of Cups- Columbus, Ohio Dec23 2016.)\n\nColin Answers Your Watershed Questions Before Gig This Weekend\n\n--So what’s going on in Detroit this Saturday?\n\nC.G. – Our good pals The Fags are doing a reunion show at Small’s in Detroit and asked us to come open the show. In fact they are working on a new record. (Click here for more info on that at Pledge music) It was too good of an offer to pass up, so Joe is flying to Cbus, we are going to rehearse for a bit and then pile in the van for the short ride to Motown. We are on around 10pm.\n\n(Note: As of this publishing, Joe Oestreich is literally filling sandbags to protect his pad in S.C. from Hurricane Matthew. If he can't make the show, the rest of us will and it will rock. Besides, it's The Fags show anyway.)\n\n(Note 2: Due to said hurricane 'n' stuff we got cancelled for the show in Detroit. Read more on that here )\n\n--That sure seems like a lot of work for just an opening gig. Why?\n\nC.G. - Obviously, we are huge fans of the band and go way back with John and Jimmy, but without Tim Patalan producing “The More it Hurts” and “5th of July,” it’s safe to say Watershed would have disappeared long ago. He was the missing - and much more musical - member of Watershed we never had. I love all of our albums but anytime Tim works with us, something special happens. Though I’m sure we are literally in some sort of debt to Tim, we will figuratively be in his debt forever. And those Fags sure can party.\n\n--There is a new Watershed single produced by Tim Patalan but I can’t find it anywhere. WTF?\n\nC.G. - Yes, in Oct. 2015 we returned to The Loft for four chilly days and long nights. It had been a long time since we had worked with Tim, not because we didn’t want to, just life and all that stuff getting in the way. Tim has a certain production style that doesn’t lend it self to tidy schedules and advance planning. Though I love his method, it’s tough to implement with jobs, kids, travel and all that.\n\nWe brought in about 8 songs. Tim listened patiently to all and said, “I think the chorus of the last one is good, but we need to rewrite the rest of it. And you guys should just write another brand new song while you are here. Okay, get to work, I’ll be back later.” We got to work and eventually ended up with “Hey Lydia” (song #1) and “Best Worst Night.” Shout out to Andy Harrison for jumping on board at the last minute to help in all fashions. It was some serious Brill Building shit as Andy would help engineer upstairs while the rest of us worked on the songwriting downstairs.\n\nBut I’m off track – we offered an advance version through Kickstarter as part of the Single Series. It had the two new tracks, plus a slew of old nuggets all tied directly into the book Hitless Wonder. Biggie did an amazing job with the artwork and we hit the goal in just two days (THANK YOU!) and sent them all out this summer. Sorry, no hard copies available that I know of. I bet Ricki C. could hook you up, though. Good news is that is all goes streaming I-Tunes Friday Oct. 7th before the gig in Detroit.\n\nLast time Watershed played in Columbus, Herb Schupp was back on drums. What happened to Dave?\n\nC.G. - Sorry to say, for a variety of reasons, it just wasn’t happening with Dave anymore. It was a decision we took very seriously to the point we considered just ending the band. Dave’s drumming, along with Tim Patalan’s production took us to heights we never imagined. Dave at his best is as good as any rock n roll drummer that ever played. I know it sounds crazy, but I’m telling you it’s true. Give a listen to Watershed Three Chords and a Cloud of Dust II if you want to hear for yourself. That record is basically a rock n roll drum clinic with some hacks singing over top of it. He played with finesse, musicality and personality. He played for the song. He knew where the song was going. He showed up to every practice and every gig and never sweated the small stuff. He rode in the van and never complained. He loved it all.\n\nBut in the end, we lost the thread. It was time to move on. Many drummers were considered but it was a pretty easy choice to go back to original drummer Herb Schupp. Watershed are friends first, so that dictates many of our decisions for better or worse. I think anybody who saw the “new” line-up last summer in Columbus would agree it was the right call. It’s sorta like Tom Petty going from Ron to Howie on bass, then back to Ron.\n\nDoes Dave play on the new single?\n\nC.G. - Yes, that is Dave in all his glory trying to please Tim Patalan. It was the prefect way to go out. And his last gig with Watershed was opening for Cheap Trick. I feel good about that. (click here to read more about that show)\n\nWhat happened to Joe Peppercorn?\n\nC.G. - For those not from Columbus, Joe is a powerhouse in his own right. Around the time of Brick and Mortar, Joe was a little burned out leading his own projects while juggling raising young kids. He would tend bar at the Treehouse on Wednesdays and I would stop by some nights to chat. I could empathize with where he was at in his career because I had been there myself. Drummers leaving the band, no money and young kids running around the house.\n\nWe knew that doing the record in Columbus without Tim, we could really use a person with the musical talent of Joe Peppercorn. So we proposed that he join the band and help with the new record. For once, he wouldn’t have to shoulder the load all alone. Contribute some tunes, play some parts and drink some beer. Or put in rock n roll terms, he could be the Ron Wood of Watershed for a while. Essential to the sound, but free not worry about all of the nonsense.\n\nHe jumped at the opportunity and I think the record we made and live shows we played together more than justified the decision. That was some of the most fun I’ve ever had in my life. And we could not have done it without Joe Peppercorn. (And Mike Landolt.) Alas, Joe is a bandleader par excellence himself and eventually got back to doing his own thing. His band The Whiles have a new record due out soon and every December he fronts a band that plays EVERY Beatles song in chronological order in one 13 hour show. Yup. Whatever Joe Peppercorn does, you need to take an interest. He is one of the best.\n\nWho was the other guy on guitar at Ace of Cups?\n\nC.G. - That would be the man behind the curtain, Rick Kinsinger. He produced The League Bowlers, Dead Schembechlers, and helps out on our studio stuff. Since we all play in the Bones together it was a no-brainer for him to join up.\n\nWhat are the chords to Plan B?\n\nC.G. - G-E-C-D (sometimes I capo up a step)\n\nA question from New Zealand: How can I get some Watershed shirts over here?\n\nC.G. - I will pass this on to Biggie, but hit us up with a FB message and we will find a way to hook you up. I am a fan of The Bats. Could we trade shirts?\n\nWhy Isn't Ted Nugent in the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame instead of Cheap Trick?\n\nC.G. - Easy. Because of this..\n\nI've been getting lots of messages about Watershed not performing on the long-awaited bill with The Fags in Detroit Saturday night. To be clear, we did not cancel the show, we got cancelled. The powers that be decided that a hobbled Watershed was better replaced than to perform. Even just third on the bill was a no-go. Sure, Joe O. couldn't leave his wife and young kids alone with a major hurricane bearing down on his home but Herb, Biggie,Rick K., Ricki C. and myself were one hundred percent committed to putting on a first class rock show for any fan who was making the trip to Motown. After all, this is our only scheduled show this year. We were amped. You saw Biggie's cool flyers and Watershed ARMY sticker he customized for the gig? We had to make every effort to pull this off at any cost.\n\nIn fact, as early as Monday when the hurricane was just starting to threaten our rock n roll party, Herb and I swung into gear with nightly rehearsals to put together something different (and SPECIAL) on the small chance that Hurricane Matthew would hit Joe's house in Myrtle Beach Friday night. (I guess he could have flown back Thursday, but what kind of guy leaves his family alone with that kind of uncertainty hanging over their heads? Not Joe O.)\n\nAnyway, after some fits and starts we locked into a 18 song, 40 minute buzz-saw set with no breaks. Biggie had some cool stage ideas & lights and even a video greeting from Joe to intro the show. Alas, it wasn't meant to be. Would it have been as good as Watershed with the full line-up? No. But would it have been a unique little moment that Watershed fans would have enjoyed? I would like to think so, but now we'll never know. Though I'm obviously disappointed, it isn't our show so I respect the decision. Natural disasters aren't really something anybody plans for so things get tossed around. This storm is going to take lives, pets and property. I just lost a a few hours of raucous fun. No big deal in the big scheme of things.\n\nAnyway, It's going to be an amazing night of rock n roll with or without Watershed. Small's is an excellent venue and The Fags are truly, truly one of the best rock n roll bands you will ever see. Click here to check out their pledge music campaign and pick up their new record. Do it!\n\nOn the upside, the new Watershed single produced by Tim Patalan is available TODAY! So check it out here or on Spotify or whatever.\n\nIn case you were wondering, this is the non-stop medley we planned for Saturday night.\n\nThe Gear: One Telecaster, One 100 watt Marshall Cabinet and a drum kit right next to me at the front of the stage, bottled beer (brand TBA)\n\nThe Players: Herb Schupp and myself.\n\nThe Set:\n\nWords We Say/Broken/Obvious/Small Doses/Mecurochrome/He's a Whore/Suckerpunch/Romantic Noise/Breaking the Habit/Superstressed/Nightshade/New Depression/How Do You Feel?/Hey Lydia/Manifesto/Best is Yet to Come/ Black Concert T Shirt/ Over Too Soon.\n\nEncore: Drink more beer and watch The Fags.\n\nWatershed will be opening for The Fags at Small's Bar in Hamtramck, MI, this coming Saturday night, October 8th.\n\nTEN YEARS AGO, AN AMAZING RECORD WAS RELEASED. IT WAS ALMOST PERFECTION, EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE MAJOR FLAW…..\n\nIt’s been almost exactly 10 years since the release of one of my favorite records on the planet. I learned of this anniversary by total coincidence as I sat down with an idea to write about some (any) great, great record that had one flaw that bothered me. I thought I might write about London Calling by The Clash having both records crammed into one jacket and not listing the song “Train in Vain (Stand By Me)” on the back but that really doesn’t bother me that much. I’m a little OCD, but come on, it’s The Clash so who cares? It didn’t take me long to figure out what record was the perfect fit; that one record that is so perfect and yet has that one fatal flaw. The amazing record I decided to write about, which as it turns out is going to be 10 years old on October 31st, is called Light ‘Em Up by The Fags. This is one of those records on which every song is spectacular. The artwork is edgy and I like it a lot. The record title is perfectly rock ‘n’ roll. The name of the band is…..unfortunately horrible.\n\nThe Fags were (are) a band from the Motor City, Detroit, Michigan. The band is fronted by the excellent John Speck. The Fags came along after John’s mildly successful band Hoarse, which was not remotely as good as The Fags in my opinion. Watershed fans will remember a split single with Hoarse from around 1997. Watershed fans also will know that Fags bass player Tim Patalan has been a valued collaborator/producer for Watershed. So anyway, I had this theme and this band in mind – great record, one fatal flaw – and by pure coincidence, the record is being celebrated with a live show to commemorate its tenth anniversary, and Watershed is opening. Damn I wish I was a few hours closer to Michigan so I could see that show.\n\nBut let me talk more about Light ‘Em Up. This record did not go totally unnoticed. Spin Magazine listed it as one of forty great records in 2006. I haven’t seen the list, but I guarantee Light ‘Em Up was better than probably every one of the records they listed, whatever they were. The record had eleven songs on it. I’ll get to my favorite in a minute, but let’s start with “Truly, Truly.” That song could have been a big radio hit, but I’m willing to bet that there were a lot of radio stations passing on playing a song by a band called The Fags. I should say that I don’t know why they chose that name for the band, maybe there was a great reason for it, but I wish they hadn’t. I read an article that seemed to suggest that they were just messing around when they did a gig as the Smokin’ Fags and after that it just stuck. That’s a shame. My personal favorite song on the record is “Mistake.” The song just oozes regret: “I just can’t help thinking we’re making a big mistake.” That line and the way it is sung gives me a chill even now. My favorite lyric on the record (also from “Mistake”) is “I try to do what’s right, but what’s left keeps egging me on / It may end up on my face, that’s the risk that I take.” I also can relate to the line “The radiator hisses in a soft assuring way.”\n\nThe song “List” is right up there, as is “Rockstar.” “List” has that great line “I sat down to write a list of every girl I ever kissed / I couldn’t remember them all, I guess it’s a case of selective recall.” And “Rockstar” just makes you feel good—“Grab the keys off the counter, check the mirror on the way out….You’re a rockstar on a Saturday night.” The title track is an instant classic as well. I could make a good case for the brilliance of every track. Light ‘Em Up is just a great rock and roll-power pop-whatever you want to call it record from start to finish. It should have been HUGE. Light ‘Em Up was actually completed in 2005 but sat on a shelf for an extended period. Just like Watershed and countless other great bands, the recording industry completely failed The Fags, but their name almost certainly had something to do with their fate.\n\nIf you go to the anniversary celebration show at Small’s Bar in Hamtramck, Michigan on October 8th please tell me how it was. A chance to see Watershed and The Fags at a small club together on one night is a chance not to be missed. And it’s on a (Rockstar) Saturday night! I really should be flying up there from Virginia. I wish that John and Tim and drummer Jimmy Paluzzi would extend their reunion after this show, change their name and give it another shot. At the very least, I wish they would go on a tenth anniversary tour down the east coast (and bring Watershed with them of course).\n\nBREAKING NEWS: The Fags are planning to release a new record containing some old demos and outtakes, and you can get in on funding that now! – JCE"
