        "text": "The most popular TikTok songs aren’t just (extremely) catchy vehicles for whatever the latest trending dance is. They’re also a great way to discover new tunes — even if that “new” tune first hit airwaves decades ago.\n\nHelping songs new and old go viral is, after all, at the heart of the app’s origin. Most Gen Zers won’t need to be told that TikTok started out as the lip-synching video platform Musical.ly, before it was acquired by a Chinese tech company and refashioned as TikTok in August 2018. In the years since, TikTok — and TikTok music — has grown exponentially. Out of the platform’s one billion users, 75% say they’ve discovered new artists to listen to on the app, according to 2021 research commissioned by TikTok, and 63% have been introduced to music they’ve never heard before thanks to trending TikTok songs.\n\nIn sum, making music go viral is kind of TikTok’s jam. And if you’re wondering what the latest trending songs on TikTok are, as well as where to find the top TikTok songs of all time — or, erm, since 2018 rather — you’ve come to the right place. We’ve rounded up the best TikTok songs out there, from pandemic-friendly jingles to songs you may not even realize had a TikTok takeoff. Either way, we think these hall of famers are worth spending more than 15 seconds on.\n\n1. “So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings,” Caroline Polachek\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nLooking for new TikTok songs? Polachek’s got you covered. It was only a matter of time before the lyrics from this total bop of a song — plus the dance moves from the music video — made their way onto the app.\n\n2. “About Damn Time,” Lizzo\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nLizzo led the world in copying her own choreography for her 2022 hit — and we all followed.\n\n3. “It’s All Coming Back to Me Now,” Celine Dion\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThis karaoke song par excellence recently made a resurgence as a highly TikTok-able ballad.\n\n4. “Abcdefu,” GAYLE\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nA prime example of the app’s impact on the music industry, the breakout popularity of “Abcdefu” on TikTok helped catapult then-unknown 17-year-old singer GAYLE into the spotlight (and into a recording deal with Atlantic Records).\n\n5. \"Telepatía\" by Kali Uchis\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nPeople love this 2020 song from Colombian-American singer Kali Uchis. The TikTok search page is full of people simply appreciating her vocals, with a dance video here and there.\n\n6. “Bored in the House”, Tyga ft. Curtis Roach\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nCould there be a better song for the pandemic? Nope. That’s why “Bored in the House” went beyond viral in COVID’s early days. The tongue-twisting lyrics and fresh beat helped too, of course.\n\n7. \"Beggin'\" by Måneskin\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThere’s a ton of concert footage of this song being performed live, and that’s fun in itself. And then there’s musician Crash Adams faking out a bunch of passersby before nailing this chorus. But we’re partial to this version where a violinist keeps pace with the rolling speed of this song.\n\n8. “All Too Well,” Taylor Swift\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nFollowing the release of “All Too Well: The Short Film,” this song was everywhere — TikTok included — as 2021 drew to a close, making it one of the top TikTok songs of the year.\n\n9. “Peaches”, Justin Bieber\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nDaniel Caesar’s smooth voice pairs perfectly with Justin’s peppy lyrics in this unexpected collab. That’s just one of the reasons why “Peaches” became one of the most popular TikTok songs around.\n\n10. “Dance Monkey”, Tones and I\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nIt’s impossible to sit still when you hear this song, as evidenced by the staggering number of TikTok videos that feature it. From beauty tutorials to choreography and everything in between, “Dance Monkey” has earned a spot as one of the best TikTok songs.\n\n11. \"Wait a Minute!\" by WILLOW\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nBack in 2015, Willow released a song that would eventually catch the eye of lip syncers across the world. The low-fi, selfie videos of people tackling this song is like ASMR for TikTok users who have seen one too many hair stylist reaction videos.\n\n12. “Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)”, Edison Lighthouse\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThis sweet lil’ jingle quickly became TikTokers’ perfect excuse to share selfies.\n\n13. “Best Friend”, Doja Cat, Saweetie\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe song behind the wildly popular “Best Friend Challenge” had BFFs the world over pairing up to create their own moves to this catchy song.\n\n14. \"Please Don't Go\" by Mike Posner\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nPet owners are hopping back to this 2015 jam for a fun moment with their furry friends. And it’s way cute. Think: Dogs and guardians in cars, speeding down the highway in matching outfits. We love to see it.\n\n15. “Toxic x Pony,” ALTÉGO\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nLeave it to trending TikTok songs to introduce us to mashups that nearly blow their original songs out of the water.\n\n16. “Dior”, Pop Smoke\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nIt seems like everyone from middle schoolers to housewives on TikTok had their own ideas about the #mood of this song.\n\n17. “International Super Spy”, The Backyardigans\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nEvery single song from this random kids show from the early 2000s happens to be completely legit. In 2021, the International Super Spy challenge trended across the app, with TikTokers revealing unexpected facts about themselves to the words of the song.\n\n18. “Circus”, Britney Spears\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe darling of the early 00’s, Britney Spears’ music is still totally relevant. That’s why we loved this TikTok trend set to Britney’s hit, “Circus.” Here, people reimagined themselves as early 2000’s pop stars, and platform flip-flops were obviously a must-have.\n\n19. “Drivers License,” Olivia Rodrigo\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nIt’s not only dancey beats that tend to take over TikTok. When Rodrigo released this sad girl anthem in January 2021 during the middle of our first COVID winter, it offered TikTok users some needed (and postable) catharsis.\n\n20. “Day 'n' Nite”, Kid Cudi\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nIn which Cudi’s “Day ‘N’ Nite” lyrics “now look at this” became the — you guessed it — #nowlookatthis TikTok trend.\n\n21. “Vibe”, Cookiee Kawaii\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nOnce you find your vibe, turn the cameras on, because this is the perfect tune to shimmy your way to being a TikTok star. Or at least, that’s the opinion of the legions of TikTokers who’ve performed it.\n\n22. “Pope Is a Rockstar,” Sales\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThis song is a major hit for cat videos especially — or maybe you only think that because 95% of your FYP is cat videos.\n\n23. “DNA”, BTS\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThese challenging, incredible dance moves aren’t for the faint of heart! But that doesn’t stop some hardcore BTS fans from trying them.\n\n24. “Say So”, Doja Cat\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nTikToker Haley Sharpe (yodelingHaley) became a star in her own right when she posted her unique TikTok dance to this song. It went so viral that it made its way into the official music video for the song.\n\n25. “Freakum Dress,” Beyonce\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThere are more than 80,000 videos (and counting) of TikTokers doing the #freakumdresschallenge, earning this Queen Bey ‘06-era gem a spot among the top TikTok songs.\n\n26. “Death Bed (Coffee for Your Head)”, Powfu feat. Beabadoobee\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nWho doesn’t love a song that captures the magic of a perfectly timed brew?

Beyonce\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nIf there’s one thing the year 2020 needed, it was a vital dance anthem. And that’s just what Megan Thee Stallion delivered on this collab with Beyonce. Tons of TikTok users have tried their hand at the cutting-edge moves timed to this TikTok dance song.\n\n28. “Own Brand Freestyle Transition,” Beautee\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nA built-in reason to show off your OOTD, this song had everyone on TikTok down to JoJo Siwa getting in on the trend.\n\n29. “It’ll Be Okay,” Shawn Mendes\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nMendes’ line “I will love you either way” was repurposed as a (sometimes sweet, mostly just funny) TikTok meme we’re pretty sure you’ll remember.\n\n30. “Buss It,” Erica Banks\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe first challenge to go viral on TikTok in 2021, everyone and their grandmother (sometimes literally) was posting #bussitchallenge videos.\n\n31. “Whatever You Like,” T.I.\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nIn 2020, Rapper T.I.’s “Whatever You Like” became a sort of pro-Biden anthem on TikTok, garnering tons of views when someone discovered the words “I want your body” sound eerily similar to “I want Joe Biden.”\n\n32. “Supalonely,” Benee ft. Gus Dapperton\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nTotally apropos considering it dropped right as the pandemic started, TikTok videos featuring this song have been viewed hundreds of millions of times.\n\n33. “Wake Me Up and Whisper (Evanescence x Ying Yang Twins),” Oscar Scheller\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThis mashup by singer-songwriter Oscar Scheller has since served as backdrop to many, many a TikTok’ed moment.\n\n34. “Motive x Promiscuous” mash up, Nelly Furtado ft. Ariana Grande\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nWhile we can all agree these two songs were great individually, this expert mashup is next level. The song reached viral TikTok status when user SamoBam0 created a dance we still can’t get enough of.\n\n35. “I Am Woman,” Emmy Meli\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nWith 174,000 videos using this song, it’s an example of TikTok music you’re bound to encounter — even if you, like this particular TikToker, are less-than thrilled about it.\n\n36. “Meet Me at Our Spot,” The Anxiety\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThis bop, from Willow Smith and boyfriend Tyler Cole’s band, is known on TikTok mostly as the backdrop to “show yourself four summers in a row” posts.\n\n37. “Good 4 U,” Olivia Rodrigo\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nA veritable gold mine for TikTok-able songs, Olivia Rodrigo had another breakup anthem — this one of a decidedly more eff-you nature — go viral on the app.\n\n38. “Rockstar”, Dababy with Roddy Ricch\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nIf you have dreams of becoming a TikTok star, there’s a pretty good chance you’ve tried your hand at the “Rockstar” TikTok meme.\n\n39. “Cannibal”, Kesha\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe chorus of this song became a TikTok dance that swept the app (and beyond).\n\n40. “Up,” Cardi B\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nEveryone from half your graduating class to celebs like Halle Bailey and Ciara have put their spin on the #upchallenge, created by (and not always properly credited to) 15-year-old dancer Mya Johnson.\n\n41. “positions,” Ariana Grande\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nWhen Grande released her 2020 album “Positions,” the title track quickly became TikTok fodder for those stuck at home who were looking for a (slightly saucy) way to pass the time.\n\n42. “Laxed (Siren Beat)”, Jawsh 685\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nSuper simple choreography and a sound you can’t get enough of had just about everyone stepping in front of the camera to try their hand at making TikTok videos to this tune.\n\n43. “Potential Breakup Song,” Aly & AJ\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nWe can thank TikTok for this mid-aughts jam’s (overdue) comeback.\n\n44. “Heat Waves,” Glass Animals\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nGive TikTokers the lyrics “sometimes all I think about is you,” and boom!

Pick your poison.\n\n46. “Yellow Hearts,” Ant Saunders\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nBack in 2019, “Yellow Hearts” was one of the most popular songs on TikTok, more recently inspiring a wave of nostalgia posts.

Doja Cat\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nConcert footage, dances, wedding first looks.

What you’ll usually see attached to these vocals: pet guardians aiding cats and dogs in simple dances and choreographed group dances.\n\n55. \"Castaways\" by The Backyardigans\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nWe can’t put together this list without including this absolute banger. From choreographed group dances to more subtle reaction videos, this beyond-relatable song isn’t going anywhere.
