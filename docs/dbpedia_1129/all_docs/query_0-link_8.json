        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn a typical right-handed adult, it is well accepted that language dominance is lateralized to the left hemisphere of the brain, and that this lateralization emerges between early childhood and adolescence. Behavioral studies have suggested that boys and girls develop language differently. This is most evident in early childhood (Bornstein et al., 2000; Dionne et al., 2003) and continues through to adolescence, where girls reportedly show slightly better expressive language skills than boys.\n\nClinical neuroimaging studies, first completed with patients with epilepsy and brain lesions prior to surgery (Bowyer et a., 2004; Bowyer et al., 2005; Pirmoradi et al., 2010), determined that verb generation tasks had the highest accuracy for localizing frontal language areas. This accuracy was confirmed in studies directly comparing fMRI and MEG (Kamada et al., 2007; Pang et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012). It was confirmed that, using the verb generation task, control adults demonstrated a left hemisphere dominance for language (Fisher et al., 2008; Ressel et al., 2006) and both functional MRI (fMRI: Brown et al., 2005; Holland et al., 2001; Szaflarski et al., 2006) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies (Kadis et al., 2011; Ressel et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2012) concur that this laterality emerges from early childhood to adolescence. While these neuroimaging studies have consistently reported language lateralization increases as a function of age during childhood, there is no clear confirmation of the behavioral findings of sex differences in language development.\n\nIn adults, fMRI studies of sex-related language laterality are equivocal. Some have reported different patterns of brain activation during language processing with a greater degree of lateralization in adult males and more bilateral activation in adult females (Baxter et al., 2003; Clements et al., 2006; Jaeger et al., 1998; Kansaku & Kitazawa, 2001; Kitazawa & Kansaku, 2005; Shaywitz et al., 1995; Weiss et al., 2003). However, other fMRI studies in adults have not found sex differences in language lateralization (Allendorfer et al., 2011; Buckner et al., 1995; Frost et al., 1999; Gur et al., 2000; Hirnstein et al., 2012). These discrepant findings could be attributed to the use of different language tasks, varying sample sizes in the studies, and/or different approaches utilized in data analysis (Allendorfer et al., 2011; Gaillard, et al., 2003a; Harrington & Farias, 2008; Hirnstein et al., 2012).\n\nAlthough there have been quite a few neuroimaging studies investigating language lateralization in children, to date, there are four imaging studies which specifically address the issue of sex-related differences in language lateralization in the developmental domain. Three of these studies used fMRI (Burman et al., 2008; Gaillard et al., 2003b; Plante et al., 2006) and one used event-related potentials (ERP; Spironelli et al., 2010). The two earlier fMRI studies (Gaillard et al., 2003b; Plante et al., 2006) did not find main effects of sex and suggested that sex differences may be age- and task-dependent (Plante et al., 2006). In the latter study, (Plante et al., 2006), fMRI was recorded from 205 children aged 5 to 18 years while they performed four different language tasks. Although no significant sex differences (main effect) were found for laterality across all language tasks, they found a strong interaction of sex and age, particularly, on the auditory verb generation task. Instead of a simple level-of-activation difference, they observed different slopes for the age effect between boys and girls. They suggest that these sex effects may be due to a differential allocation of physiological resources to the task by boys and girls, depending on the task and depending on their age.\n\nThe third fMRI study, however, found a significant sex difference in language lateralization in children (Burman et al., 2008), as did an ERP study (Spironell et al., 2010). Burman and colleagues (2008) tested 62 children aged 9–15 years as they performed spelling and rhyming language tasks in both the visual and auditory modalities.. They observed that activations in frontal and temporal regions were bilaterally stronger in girls, whereas boys always exhibited unilateral left activations in all regions. The authors suggested that the activation patterns may reflect different approaches to linguistic processing, where girls rely on a supramodal (modality in-specific) language network and boys relied on modality-specific network. In the ERP study, Spironelli and colleges (2010) recorded data from 28 ten-year-old children as they performed three language (phonological, semantic, and orthographic) tasks. Consistent with Burman et al.’s finding (2008), they demonstrated left lateralization for boys over anterior sites during the phonological task whereas girls exhibited bilateral activation in all tasks.\n\nIn recent years, MEG has increasingly been used to investigate the localization (Kadis et al., 2008), lateralization (Kadis et al., 2011; Ressel et al., 2008), and performance (Kikuchi et al., 2011) on language tasks in children. In young children, the MEG may be a preferable imaging modality as it offers a less restrictive and less noisy testing environment compared to the fMRI (Pang, 2011). As well, MEG offers better temporal resolution and can be used to examine both evoked (time-locked) and induced (task-related oscillatory-changes) responses in the brain. Studies have reported that gamma band cortical oscillatory activity is associated with higher-order cognitive processes such as lexical processing (Eulitz et al., 1996; Ihara et al., 2003; Pulvermuller et al., 1996; Pulvermuller et al., 1995), attention (e.g., Tiitinen et al., 1993), and reading (e.g., Hirata et al., 2002). While there have been few studies on the developmental trajectory of gamma oscillations, an EEG study found task-specific gamma changes with age (Yordanova et al., 2002) and an MEG study found significant reduction of movement-related gamma in children and even adolescents (Gaetz et al., 2010). Kadis et al. (2008; 2011) used changes in high beta / low gamma desynchronization to localize frontal language areas in a group of children. Given the lack of evidence for sex-related developmental differences in language task-related oscillatory changes, there is a need to systematically examine this question.\n\nOf the four imaging studies which specifically addressed the question of sex-related differences in language lateralization in children, the study by Plante et al. (2006), described above, suggested that verb generation may be most promising when looking for sex-related developmental changes in language processing. The verb generation task, which involves word retrieval, semantic and expressive language processing, has been widely used in many imaging studies underlying language processing (e.g., Baciu et al., 1999; Gaillard et al., 2003; Pujol et al., 1999). Across studies, the verb generation task has consistently been found to activate the inferior frontal, dorsolateral prefrontal, superior temporal and middle temporal gyri. To gain insight into the maturation of the lateralization of the language neural network, we tested boys and girls, children and adolescents, on a visual verb generation task in the MEG, to determine whether there are cortical oscillatory changes in brain regions known to be involved in language processing. Our specific aim was to investigate the sex-related differences in language lateralization in children using magnetoencephalography (MEG).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe goal of this study was to investigate the sex differences in spatiotemporal patterns of language lateralization in children across development. To our knowledge, this is the first MEG evidence of language-related sex differences in childhood, although this is a well-accepted phenomenon in the behavioral literature. In our data, gamma band event-related desynchrony (ERD) was found consistently within language-related areas during the verb generation task for all participants. Our data concur with other MEG studies where low-gamma ERD activity was observed to reflect language processing (Hirata et al., 2002; 2004; Ihara et al., 2003). In fact, Hirata et al. (2002) concluded that low gamma-band (25–50 Hz) activity is related to both syntactic and semantic aspects of language processing (Hirata et al., 2004). ERS was not consistently seen in this cohort. It should be noted that we did not find beta ERS or ERD which has been reported in other studies of expressive language localization in children (Kadis et al., 2011; Ressel et al., 2008). This may be due to our intentional exclusion of motor and pre-motor areas (BA4 and BA6) from our analyses whereas both Kadis et al. and Ressel et al. included the whole frontal lobe, defined as the area anterior to the central sulcus. Motor control is known to be in the beta band (Pfurtscheller & Lopes da Silva, 1999), thus by excluding these areas, we were able to dissociate the language from the motor control aspects of verb generation.\n\nConsistent with examples in the literature (Baciu et al., 1999; Gaillard et al., 2003; Kunii et al., 2013; Pujol et al., 1999), our data demonstrated that inferior frontal and superior temporal gyri, along with other language associated regions, were active during a verb generation task, although the level of activity in these regions varied depending on the age and sex of the participant. Whereas boys showed a stronger left lateralized activation in the frontal and temporal areas during the verb generation task, girls failed to show this typical lateralized pattern and exhibited a more bilateral activation, particularly with extensively bilateral distribution in the frontal regions ( ). This is in alignment with the findings of Burman et al. (2008) and Spironelli et al. (2010). Our results suggest that measurement of changes in gamma ERD activity track the development of different aspects of the language network in boys and girls.\n\nOur data further demonstrated that left hemisphere language lateralization emerged in early childhood for the boys and remained lateralized throughout adolescence, whereas girls exhibited a more bilaterally activated language network at a younger age, with more left lateralization appearing around the age of 16 years. Typically, a left lateralized language network is associated with more mature language function, thus, at first glance, it appears that the mature pattern of language lateralization arises earlier in boys than in girls, and girls do not acquire this typical left-lateralized pattern until after puberty. This is in contrast to the developmental literature which suggests that girls have slightly better expressive language skills than boys, and to our neuropsychological assessments which did not find any differences in language ability between boys and girls. While our participants were typically developing control volunteers recruited from the community, their PPVT and EVT scores were in the high range of normal, and this should be taken into consideration when interpreting these results. However, taking together the participants’ behavioral performance and their lateralization patterns, it is unlikely that the lateralization pattern seen in our study reflects sex differences in language development or performance, but may instead reflect differences in brain functional neurophysiology between boys and girls.\n\nAnother interesting finding in the present study is the different patterns seen in ERD magnitude in the language related regions between boys and girls. While performing the verb generation task, boys demonstrated more focal clusters of higher magnitude ERD within language-related areas from an early age through to adolescence; in contrast, girls exhibited less focal and lower magnitude ERD over language areas at an early age; this changed around the age of 10 years and became more similar to what was seen in the boys. Again, given the absence of differences on performance of the task and on neuropsychological assessment, these different patterns cannot be attributed to differences in language development but could reflect functional differences in activation of the language network between boys and girls.\n\nWhile it is not clear is why the lateralization of growth patterns between boys and girls in the language-related areas converge at around 10 years of age. The suggestion of differences in the functional neurophysiology of the brain between boys and girls is supported by evidence of neuroanatomical changes related to sex and age. Males show more prominent age-related gray and white matter volume changes during brain development (De Bellis et al., 2001; Lenroot et al., 2007; Lenroot & Giedd, 2010; Perrin et al., 2009) whereas females show greater and earlier changes in the corpus callosum (De Bellis et al., 2001; Lenroot & Giedd, 2010). This could explain the asymmetry of brain processing seen in our language task where boys demonstrate left hemisphere dominance across development while girls show bilateral activation as the changes in their corpus callosum would facilitate interhemispheric communication. Indeed, Sakai (2005) suggested that developmental callosal changes during early childhood shapes language processing in the brain network and is integral to cortical maturation and learning to speak, read or write. However, in our data, it is not clear why the shift from bilateral to left lateralization occurred later in girls, and, in the boys, it is not clear why lateralization did not become bilateral with the development of callosal pathways. One possible explanation is that the left hemisphere is necessary for efficient language processing. As the boys already show left lateralization at a younger age, the development of the callosal pathway does not affect this laterality and does not cause a shift into the right hemisphere. For the girls, however, as they show bilateral activation at a younger age, the development of the callosal pathway allows them to shift more into the left hemisphere to take advantage of the more efficient language processing system. This explanation is entirely speculative and requires further testing and validation.\n\nAn alternative explanation for the different ERD patterns observed in our study is that boys and girls may utilize different strategies during the verb generation task. There is evidence from behavioral studies for sex-related differences in language processing strategies, where males recall words in the order of presentation (Kimura, 1999; Kramer et al., 1988), while females employ categorical organization to recall words in memory tasks (Cox & Waters, 1986; Kimura, 1999; Kramer et al., 1997; 1988). Several fMRI studies have reported that the recruitment of right frontal cortex was associated with the categorization process in semantic memory (Grossman et al., 2002b; Olga et al., 2008). As well, significantly reduced activation in this area for multiple categories of knowledge was observed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (Grossman et al., 2002a). In line with these findings, our results suggest that girls may use the typical left-lateralized language network, but draw on regions in the right hemisphere as part of their strategy for language processing. This would result in a more bilaterally active system for girls and a more typical, language-specific system, for boys.\n\nOur study design tracked subject accuracy and compliance on-line. As subjects performed the verb generation task, their responses were checked by a research assistant for accurate, appropriate responses; however, these verbal responses were not recorded. This is consistent with fMRI studies where subjects completed the task overtly. In future MEG studies, audio recordings of the subjects’ responses would allow further and more detailed analysis of subject strategy and may capture more subtle sex-related behavioral and neuroimaging differences.\n\nWithin the larger context of neuroimaging studies, two recent structural imaging papers report interesting sex differences in brain laterality. Ingalhalikar and colleagues (2014) used fiber tractography and diffusion tensor imaging to compute structural connectectomes in >900 children and young adults (aged 8–22 years). Similar to our findings, they report that males showed strong laterality (intra-hemispheric connectivity) that was established early in life and preserved throughout development. On the other hand, females showed dominant inter-hemispheric connectivity at a young age, and this decreased with increasing age. O’Muircheartaigh and colleagues (2013) used a DTI measure of myelin water content to examine the relation between language ability and myelination asymmetry in 108 children aged 1–6 years. In this very young cohort, they report relations between language measures and subcortical white matter; however, they did not find effects for lateral frontal and temporal areas – possibly these children were too young to have established well their language networks. Our study addresses the gap in age between the former and latter papers, and we find some consistent results and some differences, probably due to development. These three studies taken together emphasize the need for large scale developmental studies that not only consider age as a variable, but take into account sex and individual differences in functional ability."
