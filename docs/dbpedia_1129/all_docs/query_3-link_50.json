        "text": "Don‚Äôt get us wrong‚Äîwe really love city life. But sometimes day-tripping to a nearby summer music festival doesn‚Äôt quite satiate our need for escape, and that‚Äôs where these classic road trip songs come in. When the urge strikes, it‚Äôs time to hit the highway/motorway/whatever for a good, old-fashioned road trip. Of course, you can‚Äôt drive in complete silence‚Äîwell, you can, but the very thought is giving us a flat tyre‚Äîso we‚Äôve compiled our list of the best road trip songs to get your motors running and propel your journey into fifth gear. Crank up classics from the Boss, the Dead and Prince, and even some Whitesnake, as you cruise along the open road, forgetting every care in the world.\n\nRECOMMENDED:\n\nü§ùThe best songs about friendship\n\nüéâ The best birthday songs of all time\n\nüé∂ The best ‚Äô80s songs\n\nüé§ The best karaoke songs\n\nüï∫ The best pop songs of all time\n\n1. ‚ÄòBorn to Run‚Äô by Bruce Springsteen\n\nLike Bruce Springsteen‚Äôs ‚ÄòBorn in the U.S.A.,‚Äô ‚ÄòBorn to Run‚Äô is darker than it may seem. Embedded in the scuffed poetry of the lyrics is a potent combination of rebellion, sex, disgust and determination‚Äîbrought to life by the throaty passion of Springsteen‚Äôs voice, the liberating wail of Clarence Clemons‚Äôs sax and the sheer propulsive force of the E Street Band‚Äôs backup. ‚ÄúSomeday girl, I don‚Äôt know when/We‚Äôre gonna get to that place where we really wanna go,‚Äù Springsteen promises. ‚ÄòBorn to Run‚Äô, for all its spikes, takes you there. It‚Äôs a love song, an urban-jungle cry and a perfect anthem of pedal-to-the-metal escape.\n\n2. ‚ÄòLittle Red Corvette‚Äô by Prince\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt take a B.A. in poetry to figure this ditty‚Äôs got nothing to do with cars. In the world of Prince, coup√©s are women, horsepower is a pack of Trojan condoms, and gas is stamina in the sheets. The beat takes its time, synthetic drums echoing into the distance, just as the Purple One implores his one-night stand to take it slow, to make it two, three or more nights. Dez Dickerson peels out in the guitar solo, but she‚Äôs the one driving here. Perfect choice of car model‚Äîelusive, American, curvy, risky. It wouldn‚Äôt work as a Ferrari or Rolls.\n\nAdvertising\n\n3. ‚ÄòHere I Go Again‚Äô by Whitesnake\n\nBeen dumped recently? You need to go for a drive (preferably in a Jaguar XJ). You‚Äôve made up your mind. You ain‚Äôt wasting no more time. So tease your hair, don your pleather, and crank up the volume on this 1982 hit‚Äîjust try not to get stuck in traffic. This power ballad works better on the open road (with no adjacent drivers to judge your Coverdale cover moves).\n\n4. ‚ÄòWhere the Streets Have No Name‚Äô by U2\n\nThis anthemic opening track from U2‚Äôs landmark 1987 LP, The Joshua Tree, is an ideal kick-starter for any road trip (particularly if you're wandering about the California desert where the titular yucca plant is commonly found). From a whisper, the sound of an organ builds up like a spiritual beacon being unveiled. It‚Äôs well over a minute before the Edge‚Äôs churning guitar and Adam Clayton‚Äôs propulsive bassline kick in, and another 40 seconds before Bono‚Äôs vocals touch down. By then, you‚Äôre ready to hit top gear and wail along: ‚ÄòI want to run/I want to hide/I want to tear down the walls that hold me inside.‚Äô Though this road trip song is about Bono‚Äôs vision of an Ireland free from class boundaries, it has inspired countless highway warriors to venture out to those places that maybe aren‚Äôt on the map.\n\nAdvertising\n\n5. ‚ÄòLove Shack‚Äô by the B-52s\n\n‚ÄòHop in my Chrysler! It‚Äôs as big as a whale, and it‚Äôs about to set sail!‚Äô booms Fred Schneider on this all-time great party song. Admittedly, it‚Äôs hard to dance like no one‚Äôs watching when you‚Äôre behind the wheel of a Chrysler (or a Fiat Punto, for that matter), but ‚ÄòLove Shack‚Äô will liven up any road trip. If your bum‚Äôs getting numb, just whack it on and have yourself a little front or backseat disco.\n\n6. ‚ÄòSweet Home Alabama‚Äô by Lynyrd Skynyrd\n\nAmerican football possibly killed off Southern boogie rock. Hear us out. Because of college pigskin rivalries, this song could not be made today. College football is a matter of life and death down there, literally. Iconic trees and people have been murdered over games. Skynyrd was born deep in SEC country: The boogie-rock brothers were from Jacksonville, not Alabama, and cut the track in Georgia. Could you imagine a bunch of Gators fans cutting a tune that could in any way be construed as ‚ÄòRoll Tide‚Äô? Yankees and rivals love to mock and loathe the Crimson Tide, but when this ditty plays, every human in the room, no matter the allegiance, becomes a temporary, gen-u-wine Mobile redneck.\n\nAdvertising\n\n7. ‚ÄòI Drove All Night‚Äô by Cyndi Lauper\n\nThe irreverent thrift-shop spunk that defined Cyndi Lauper‚Äôs persona in the 1980s sometimes overshadowed her killer range and sensitivity as a vocalist, but ‚ÄòI Drove All Night‚Äô‚Äîfrom her third album, 1989‚Äôs ‚ÄòA Time to Remember‚Äô‚Äîfinds her in a different mode. Driven by a feverish desire, she takes the wheel and makes her own way to her lover‚Äôs bed. (She may coyly ask, ‚ÄòIs that all right?‚Äô but by that time she‚Äôs already done it.) And Lauper‚Äôs impressively sustained last note is a perfect expression of the song‚Äôs sense of undeterrable yearning.\n\n8. ‚ÄòFast Car‚Äô by Tracy Chapman\n\nTracy Chapman‚Äôs beautifully direct 1988 hit, from her eponymous debut album, gives escapism an especially poignant twist. The speeding car and its romantic freedom (‚ÄòCity lights stretched out before us/Your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder‚Äô) can‚Äôt be separated from what it‚Äôs speeding from: a life of urban poverty, trapped taking care of deadbeats‚Äîfirst a drunk father and then, at the end, the very driver that she had dreamed might carry her to rescue.\n\nAdvertising\n\n9. ‚ÄòKeep the Car Running‚Äô by Arcade Fire\n\nIf there‚Äôs one quality that characterizes Arcade Fire‚Äôs sound, it‚Äôs urgency‚Äîand nowhere is that more evident than on ‚ÄòKeep the Car Running‚Äô from the band‚Äôs super noir, grandiose 2007 ‚ÄòNeon Bible‚Äô album. Based on singer Win Butler‚Äôs childhood nightmares (‚ÄòMen are coming to take me away!‚Äô he pines), ‚ÄòKeep the Car Running‚Äô expands these fears into a sense of global anxiety, and the certainty that there must be something better down the road (‚ÄòDon‚Äôt know why, but I know I can‚Äôt stay‚Äô). On its release, the song was likened to prime-era Bruce Springsteen; imagine fans‚Äô joy when Butler and R√©gine Chassagne made a surprise showing at the Boss‚Äôs stadium gig to bust out the song with him. Warning: You will need to be super-careful not to break the speed limit if you play this song while driving.\n\n10. ‚ÄòTruckin‚Äô‚Äô by Grateful Dead\n\nLet us pause, and acknowledge the fact that this road trip song has been recognised by the U.S. Library of Congress as a national treasure. Mmmm. Written and performed communally by Jerry Garcia, Phil Lesh, Bob Weir and lyricist Robert Hunter, the catchy, bluesy shuffle turns the band‚Äôs misfortunes on the road into a metaphor for getting through life‚Äôs constant changes. And really, what‚Äôs a good trip‚Äîor a good life‚Äîif you can‚Äôt exclaim at the end, ‚ÄòWhat a long, strange trip it‚Äôs been‚Äô?\n\nAdvertising\n\n11. ‚ÄòRoad to Nowhere‚Äô by Talking Heads\n\nThe gospel-choir intro to this upbeat single, off 1985‚Äôs ‚ÄòLittle Creatures‚Äô LP, makes for a great start to any road-trip mix. The song celebrates the journey over the destination‚Äîas frontman David Byrne puts it, ‚ÄòI wanted to write a song that presented a resigned, even joyful look at doom.‚Äô (Typical of him.) Not every end point is a good one, but we‚Äôll be damned if this march doesn‚Äôt have us enjoying the ride.\n\n12. ‚ÄòGraceland‚Äô by Paul Simon\n\nRoad trips are a time for contemplation, whether we expect it (or like it) or not. Paul Simon‚Äôs 1986 single is a perfect, toe-tapping example‚Äîwe‚Äôre treated to what‚Äôs basically his stream of consciousness on a drive to Graceland with his son after the failure of his marriage to the late, great Carrie Fisher. At turns both nostalgic and hopeful, it runs the gamut of emotions we always seem to experience a little more profoundly on the road.\n\nAdvertising\n\n13. ‚ÄòTake It Easy‚Äô by the Eagles\n\nThe Eagles took flight in 1972 with their debut single: a quick but mellow paean to the romance of the road, where a world of troubles‚Äîromantic and otherwise‚Äîcan be shucked at the mere sight of a girl (my lord!) in a flatbed Ford. Cowritten by frontman Glenn Frey and his friend Jackson Browne, the song‚Äôs rejection of worry and release into insouciant adventure are perfect for relieving tension on a drive. As the lyrics gently urge: ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy.‚Äô\n\n14. ‚ÄòAmerica‚Äô by Simon and Garfunkel\n\nAdd this one to your bucket list: Everyone should be required (at least once) to listen to their restless side, hitchhike, board a bus and go to another city/state/country to find something better‚Äîas described in Simon and Garfunkel‚Äôs 1968 classic, which follows two young lovers on a Greyhound in search for America. Take your sweetie along for the ride, smoke cigarettes on the side of the road, chat with the weirdos you meet on your journey, and by all means, indulge in a few slices of all-American pie.\n\nAdvertising\n\n15. ‚ÄòRoute 66‚Äô by Chuck Berry\n\nThis R&B standard, written in 1946 by Bobby Troup, has been covered by everyone from the Rolling Stones to John Mayer and Depeche Mode. We‚Äôre partial to Chuck Berry‚Äôs 1961 rendition, which matches the 2,400-mile pilgrimage on the L.A.‚ÄìChicago-connecting titular highway to a T. Who better than the father of rock & roll to accompany a trip past greasy-spoon diners, tiny towns frozen in time and striking Americana landscapes?\n\n16. ‚ÄòHome‚Äô by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros\n\nFirst and foremost a love song, the L.A. troupe‚Äôs jingly-jangly 2010 smash single is also, obviously, about coming home ‚Äì making it the perfect road trip song. Naturally, the feel-good tune should be played at the end of your voyage, when you‚Äôre speeding a bit because you just can‚Äôt wait to get home to your significant other/parents/puppy/comfy bed.\n\nAdvertising\n\n17. ‚ÄòGoing Up the Country‚Äô by Canned Heat\n\nReleased in 1968 and adapted from a 1920s blues song, Canned Heat‚Äôs highest-charting single was the unofficial anthem of Woodstock‚Äîand even after all this time, it‚Äôs the perfect track to kick off a road trip, a steering-wheel-tapping, grin-inducing song that makes you immediately pine for sun-drenched fields: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going where the water tastes like wine, we can jump in the water, stay drunk all the time.‚Äù Those dudes had their priorities straight‚Ä¶just so long as they had a designated driver.\n\n18. ‚ÄòI‚Äôve Been Everywhere‚Äô by Johnny Cash\n\nMusic has always had the power to educate. Billy Joel‚Äôs ‚ÄòWe Didn‚Äôt Start the Fire‚Äô taught us more 20th-century American history than a year‚Äôs worth of school hisoty lessons. For a CliffsNotes anatomy lesson, we turned to Professor Sir Mix-a-Lot. And when it comes to geography, there is no better musical resource than this name-dropping country ditty, first released with North American locales in 1962 by Canadian crooner Hank Snow. In four verses, 91 places are rattled off in rapid-fire succession‚Äîdestinations both big (Chicago and Nashville) and small (Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, and Haverstraw, New York). This road trip song has been covered many times and adapted for different regions of the globe, but we‚Äôre partial to the Man in Black‚Äôs 1996 rendition, simply because his weathered, gravelly bass-baritone suggests a man who has indeed been everywhere.\n\nAdvertising\n\n19. ‚ÄòHit the Road Jack‚Äô by Ray Charles\n\nFiendishly simple with its descending piano chords, ‚ÄòHit the Road Jack‚Äô is sung from the perspective of a philanderer being ejected by his lady. By all rights this 1961 R&B classic should win a prize for being impossible not to sing along to: ‚ÄòWhat you say?!‚Äô screams soul hero Charles to his velvet-voiced Raelettes. Later he complains, ‚ÄòYou can‚Äôt mean that,‚Äô about as convincingly as a cat picking bird feathers from between its teeth. The track's most memorable use in a road trip appears in the 1989 comedy movie The Dream Team.\n\n20. ‚ÄòHoliday Road‚Äô by Lindsey Buckingham\n\nHard to hear this seemingly happy little sock hop without thinking of the Griswold family station wagon zooming to Walley World. As its dark video helps to underline, the lyrics speak more of feeling trapped than free. The Fleetwood Mac man was an ace at hiding his boyish ache behind melodic smiles. Which is why this road trip song is such simple genius: It works the same whether you‚Äôre chained to a desk and longing for a vacation or finally on the highway, shooting to God knows where with no deadlines.\n\nAdvertising\n\n21. ‚ÄòMr. Blue Sky‚Äô by Electric Light Orchestra\n\nThe sweet spot is 176 beats per minute. That‚Äôs a giddy run, the pace of your footsteps hitting the pavement as you jog home after a first kiss. Though we haven‚Äôt tested this, we theorise it is the precise cadence of fence posts whipping past your window as you motor down a highway just above the speed limit. ‚ÄòMr. Blue Sky‚Äô is 176 beats per minute, which is why, whenever it plays, you have the urge to run like a big dumb puppy dog to a boyfriend/girlfriend, or let the wind blow through your hair at 76mph, as you croon along to the vocoder like a robot. Warning: When ‚ÄòMr. Blue Sky‚Äô is used without such outlets, it can cause deep wanderlust.\n\n22. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm Gonna Be (500 Miles)‚Äô by the Proclaimers\n\nIf there‚Äôs one road trip song that can unite everyone in the car in the simple act of thumping whatever surface is near them in time with a ludicrously catchy tune, it‚Äôs this one‚Äîa hit in 1988 for Scottish twins the Proclaimers. Fun fact: The ‚Äòhavering‚Äô referred to in the first verse (‚ÄòAnd if I haver, I know I‚Äôm gonna be the man who‚Äôs havering to you‚Äô) is Scots slang for babbling foolishly. So now you know.\n\nAdvertising\n\n23. ‚ÄòRide Like the Wind‚Äò by Christopher Cross\n\nTake your EGOT and stuff it. Chris Cross has the transportation trifecta‚Äîmega-hits for the sea (‚ÄòSailing‚Äô), sky (‚ÄòArthur‚Äôs Theme‚Äô) and road (‚ÄòRide Like the Wind‚Äô). People condescendingly pigeonhole the guy as yacht rock (the pink flamingo on his smash album doesn‚Äôt help), but he‚Äôs truly yacht-jet-and-rental-car rock. Despite its lily-white reputation, ‚ÄòRide‚Äò is cool and dangerous. It‚Äôs possibly‚Äîno, probably‚Äîabout drug smuggling. Racing away to Mexico with Michael McDonald as the devil on your shoulder. Hearing those percolating bongos, wind effects, electric piano and oily guitar licks, it could fit right on Daft Punk‚Äôs ‚ÄòRandom Access Memories‚Äô album. It remains DJ gold. Call it ‚ÄòGet Unlucky‚Äô.\n\n24. ‚ÄòRamblin‚Äô Man‚Äô by the Allman Brothers Band\n\nWe may not have been born in the backseat of a Greyhound bus (thanks, mum!), but for whatever reason, the idea of being a ramblin‚Äô man (or woman) is endlessly appealing. And when we play this 1973 hit‚Äîbased on Hank Williams‚Äôs 1951 song of the same name‚Äîon the open road, that‚Äôs exactly who we are. At least until Monday.\n\nAdvertising\n\n25. ‚ÄòOn the Road Again‚Äô by Willie Nelson\n\nNothing beats hitting the open road, where you can escape the stress of work, family, bills, city life and just be free, man. Just ask tireless road dog Willie Nelson. The Red Headed Stranger penned this 1980 country hit‚Äîthe ultimate get-the-hell-out-of-town anthem‚Äînot in the back of a tour bus but rather, of all places, on a barf bag midflight.\n\n26. ‚ÄòRunnin‚Äô Down a Dream‚Äô by Tom Petty\n\nSome would argue that we could have built this entire list solely out of Petty tunes‚Äîbut we had to make a choice, and we picked this 1989 single from the song man‚Äôs first solo record, ‚ÄòFull Moon Fever‚Äô. Not only does it take place in a car, but the tune‚Äôs reference to Del Shannon‚Äôs ‚ÄòRunaway‚Äô and killer guitar solo make it a perfect fit for blasting out of your speakers while cruising down the interstate in pursuit of the American dream, your future destination or simply that next roadside burger.\n\nAdvertising\n\n27. ‚ÄòLet Me Ride‚Äô by Dr. Dre\n\nDr. Dre‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Chronic‚Äô album arrived on the heels of the 1992 South Central riots. Folks in Compton were looking to escape and could not‚Äîand not just because of the traffic on the 110 and 405. This was a cry for cruising with the bucket seats dropped back, slow rolling on a resting-heart-rate rhythm and those G-funk dog-whistle keyboards. ‚ÄòSwing down, sweet chariot, stop, let me ride,‚Äô goes the chorus lifted from Parliament‚Äôs ‚ÄòMothership Connection,‚Äô itself based on a slave spiritual. But just because the song hides a deeper political meaning the way lowriders hide a subwoofer in the trunk, there‚Äôs no reason Dre can‚Äôt roll in style. Specifically, in a 1964 Chevy Impala shoed with Dayton rims (a.k.a. ‚ÄòDs,‚Äô as in ‚ÄòThrow some Ds on that bitch‚Äô).\n\n28. ‚ÄòBorn to Be Wild‚Äô by Steppenwolf\n\nThe riff, like the rev of a motorcycle throttle, has become so terribly commonplace, it‚Äôs hard to imagine what it must have been like to hear its ‚Äòheavy-metal thunder‚Äô with virgin ears during the opening credits of Easy Rider. Today, Steppenwolf‚Äôs monster hit is a movie-trailer clich√© on par with ‚ÄòBad to the Bone‚Äô and ‚ÄòI Got You (I Feel Good).‚Äô What was once-tough biker rock is now Viagra-ad fodder. Still, if you can wash out the soundtrack memories of Problem Child, Dr. Dolittle 2, Rugrats Go Wild, et al., the dirty little number still rips, along with a deep huff of exhaust fumes and jazz cigarettes.\n\nAdvertising\n\n29. ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt Stop Believin‚Äô‚Äô by Journey\n\nA thousand terrible karaoke performances have somewhat dulled the lustre of this once-gleaming classic ‚Äô80s song, but once it comes on in the car, you‚Äôll be in love with it all over again within seconds. Just don‚Äôt use it as a road map‚Äîthere is no such place as South Detroit. Okay, there is, but it‚Äôs in Ontario, Canada, so you might need your passport.\n\n30. ‚ÄòInterstate Love Song‚Äô by Stone Temple Pilots\n\nThe underrated STP (hey, that‚Äôs a fuel additive) was never truly a grunge band. The ‚ÄòCore‚Äô album was a trend-surfing foot in the door, the American equivalent to Blur‚Äôs baggy-riding ‚ÄòLeisure‚Äô. Really, the bands have more melodic ambitions. Scott Weiland, as his solo albums and pink fur coat proved, had far more Bowie in him than his peers. ‚ÄòInterstate Love Song‚Äô was the lifting of the veil, when the Pilots announced, Hey, we actually listen to the Beatles, not the Melvins. It chugs along with drop-top bliss, even if the chorus is oddly about trains, not driving.\n\nAdvertising\n\n31. ‚ÄòRadar Love‚Äô by Golden Earring\n\nAppropriately for a song about driving, this 1973 cut from Dutch rockers Golden Earring is one of the best road trip songs ever written. ‚ÄòThe road has got me hypnotised, I‚Äôm speeding into a new sunrise!‚Äô wails singer Barry Hay, as that bassline gets your head nodding and your foot instinctively pressing down on the gas. ‚ÄòRadar Love‚Äô also has the best breakdown of any rock song ever. This is an indisputable scientific fact.\n\n32. ‚ÄòLife Is a Highway‚Äô by Tom Cochrane\n\nOkay. We know how heavy-handed these metaphors are. And how forced the rhymes are. We never said every song on this list was a masterpiece. But we dare you not to sing along with the chorus of this 1991 cheesefest‚Äîespecially on a highway. Maybe no one ever listens to the song in its entirety (sorry Tom), but one or two ‚Äòlife is a highway‚Äôs are pretty much mandatory. Give in.\n\nAdvertising\n\n33. ‚ÄòThe Way‚Äô by Fastball\n\nAlt-rock band Fastball had a breakout 1998 hit with this fast-driving tale of a married pair that ditches its conventional home and family, in favour of a dream life on the highway with no destination. The feel-good, sing-along optimism of the chorus‚Äî‚ÄòThey‚Äôll never get hungry, they‚Äôll never get old and grey‚Äô‚Äîhas a dark undercurrent: Weeks after their disappearance, the bodies of the real-life Texas couple who inspired the song were discovered in an Arkansas ravine. But all of life‚Äôs roads hit a dead-end eventually: Better, maybe, at least to leave the driveway.\n\n34. ‚ÄòCalifornia‚Äô by Phantom Planet\n\nContrary to popular belief, the hair-metal power ballad did not die by grunge‚Äôs bullet. The hair just got shorter and the trousers got looser. Case in point: this 2002 theme from The O.C. It is emo made only from the emotion of uncut nostalgia. It is basically Motley Cr√ºe‚Äôs ‚ÄòHome Sweet Home‚Äô for mollycoddled millennials, right down to the video compiled from sentimental tour footage. And it is oddly reminiscent of Al Jolson‚Äôs ‚ÄòCalifornia, Here I Come.‚Äô That‚Äôs some feat, finding the common ground between Jolson and the Cr√ºe. Man, remember when Ryan became a cage fighter after Marissa died?\n\nAdvertising\n\n35. ‚ÄòShut Up and Drive‚Äô by Rihanna\n\nThis electro bop from 2007 isn‚Äôt a top-tier Rihanna tune, but it still kinda rips. Driven ‚Äì pun definitely intended ‚Äì by a crafty sample from New Order‚Äôs club classic ‚ÄòBlue Monday‚Äô, it‚Äôs an unashamedly fluffy new wave pastiche that‚Äôs as much about sex as hitting the open highway. Don‚Äôt even pretend you can resist it ‚Äì especially when the chance of RiRi releasing new music any time soon seems to get slimmer with each passing year.\n\n36. ‚ÄòRunning on Empty‚Äô by Jackson Browne\n\nThere‚Äôs a reason this song soundtracks the Forrest Gump protagonist‚Äôs famous transcontinental jog: Few pop tunes capture the rush of earthbound travel‚Äîby foot, by car or, in Jackson Browne‚Äôs case, by tour bus‚Äîbetter than this autobiographical FM-radio staple. But what makes it a classic is the ambiguity in Browne‚Äôs message. ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm running now; I‚Äôm just running on,‚Äô he sings, perfectly summing up how the desire for escape can be its own kind of trap.\n\nAdvertising\n\n37. ‚ÄòTwo of Us‚Äô by the Beatles\n\nThe Fab Four‚Äôs back catalogue is replete with songs about travelling around: ‚ÄòDrive My Car,‚Äô ‚ÄòDay Tripper,‚Äô ‚ÄòTicket to Ride,‚Äô ‚ÄòYellow Submarine‚Äô‚Äîthe list goes on and on like a long and winding road. No Beatles track, though, captures the feeling of setting off into uncharted territory with someone special better than ‚ÄòTwo of Us,‚Äô penned by Paul McCartney in 1969. There is debate as to whether McCartney‚Äôs partner in crime in this song is future wife Linda Eastman, as he claims, or John Lennon, which some of the nostalgia-infused lyrics would suggest. No matter‚Äîan impromptu road trip is a good time whether your passenger-seat companion is your new flame or your counterpart in the greatest songwriting tandem of all time.\n\n38. ‚ÄòChicago‚Äô by Sufjan Stevens\n\nSome songs make your heart beat faster from the get-go, and 2005 road-trip song ‚ÄòChicago‚Äô is just such a gem, announcing its entrance in a whirlwind of strings and a rush of percussion. The backing cuts suddenly to Stevens‚Äôs voice, whispering that most universal human sentiment: ‚ÄòI fell in love again‚Äîall things go, all things go,‚Äô and then later, another familiar feeling: ‚ÄòI made a lot of mistakes, I made a lot of mistakes.‚Äô It‚Äôs this acknowledgement of our frailty, coupled with our irrepressible capacity for hope and excitement that gives ‚ÄòChicago‚Äô its electrifying, driving charge. That and the fact it features in the ridiculously touching road movie Little Miss Sunshine.\n\nAdvertising\n\n39. ‚ÄòFade Into You‚Äô by Mazzy Star\n\nNight driving found a shimmering musical complement in this ethereal 1994 track from dream popsters Mazzy Star. In a rare bit of sonic magic, it seems that no matter how fast you‚Äôre driving, the low beats per minute on ‚ÄòFade Into You‚Äô always manage to sync up perfectly with the passing dividing lines visible from your car‚Äôs two headlights. And a night drive, preferably undertaken as you‚Äôre pining for an unrequited love, wouldn‚Äôt be complete without Hope Sandoval‚Äôs dusk, haunting vocals echoing throughout your ride. Two-lane highway bliss, by moonlight.\n\n40. ‚ÄòThe Golden Age‚Äô by Beck\n\nThis 2002 road trip song, off Beck‚Äôs desolate, heartbreaking ‚ÄòSea Change‚Äô, is one of the most perfect and profound illustrations of driving as a means of escape. It‚Äôs best played at night, in the desert if you‚Äôve got one handy, when you feel like crap but have pretty much come to terms with it. And when, as Beck says, ‚ÄòYou've gotta drive all night just to feel like you‚Äôre okay.‚Äô Go forth, drive and wallow. Maybe you‚Äôll feel better in the morning.\n\nAdvertising\n\n41. ‚ÄòScar Tissue‚Äô by Red Hot Chili Peppers\n\nThe L.A.-bred Peppers clearly know a thing or two about hitting the highways, as evidenced by a song catalogue riddled with Cali-inspired, crank-up-the-dial tunes. For a journey out on the open road, we like this lead track off the band‚Äôs 1999 album, ‚ÄòCalifornication‚Äô, due to its lilting desert-by-twilight vibe. The song‚Äôs main attraction is John Frusciante‚Äôs wailing guitar solos, which achingly embody Anthony Kiedis‚Äôs lyrics about isolation and the twisted, drug-fuelled paths he‚Äôs traversed (‚ÄòWith the birds I‚Äôll share this lonely view‚Äô). Enter tumbleweed, stage right.\n\n42. ‚ÄòEvery Day Is a Winding Road‚Äô by Sheryl Crow\n\nThe little sister to Tom Cochrane‚Äôs ‚ÄòLife Is a Highway,‚Äô Sheryl Crow‚Äôs 1996 hit unabashedly co-opts the use of automotive byways as metaphors for life‚Äôs ups and downs. (Billy ‚Äòthe world is a vampire‚Äô Corgan apparently misread the memo.) The ‚Äòwacky‚Äô characters in Crow‚Äôs songs are often a bit too precious for our liking‚Äîin this case, a vending-machine repairman with a daughter he calls ‚ÄòEaster‚Äô (what?)‚Äîbut the chorus always gets us fired up for some hairpin turns, even when we‚Äôre cruising down a seemingly endless straightaway. This road trip song works perfectly when your destination is San Francisco‚Äôs iconic Lombard Street, whose residents probably have this tune swirling in their heads 24/7.\n\nAdvertising\n\n43. ‚ÄòJack & Diane‚Äô by John Cougar Mellencamp\n\nInevitably, your road trip is going to hit some lulls: You‚Äôre fighting off the yawns, your passengers have passed out, and it's 57 miles to the next pit stop. When this happens, there‚Äôs one sure-fire way to get your journey back on course: Unleash the Cougar. Indiana‚Äôs favourite son specialiaes in songs about the heartland, and his crowning jewel is this 1982 chart topper about two high-school sweethearts and the twists and turns of their American Dream. Despite the jaunty beat and an epic drum breakdown rivaling the one in Phil Collins‚Äôs ‚ÄòIn the Air Tonight,‚Äô the tale is cautionary, urging us to savour those thrilling, carefree teenage years. Oh, to be young, in love and suckin‚Äô on chilli dogs outside the Tastee Freez.‚Ä¶\n\n44. ‚ÄòKing of the Road‚Äô by Roger Miller\n\nDid our dads play this 1964 ditty on long car rides when we were little? You betcha. Do we think they contemplated the potential consequences of making penniless vagabonds sound super cool? Doubtful. Regardless, it‚Äôs a timeless everyman‚Äôs anthem, and darn if it isn‚Äôt catchy. We really like listening to it in our van down by the river.\n\nAdvertising\n\n45. ‚ÄòGreen Onions‚Äô by Booker T. & the M.G.‚Äôs\n\nThis R&B instrumental, recorded in 1962, is the perfect soundtrack for an unhurried drive, when you‚Äôre sick of singing along and ready to just cruise. It‚Äôs repetitive, much like the open road, but with a steady beat and some soulful Hammond organ to keep things interesting. Widely considered to be one of the greatest songs of all time, it‚Äôs received accolades from Rolling Stone, Acclaimed Music, the Grammy Hall of Fame and the Library of Congress. If AAA had a greatest songs list, we‚Äôre sure ‚ÄòGreen Onions‚Äô would be on that, too.\n\n46. ‚ÄòMustang Sally‚Äô by Wilson Pickett\n\nYou can probably blame censorship for our automobile sex fetishes. Early rock & rollers couldn‚Äôt sing about sex, so they sang about their cars‚Ä¶with not-so-subtle undertones. ‚ÄòMustang Sally,‚Äô the grandmother of ‚ÄòLittle Red Corvette‚Äô only wants to ‚Äòride around,‚Äô and Pickett howls with his thumb out, looking to hitch. Don‚Äôt let this song‚Äôs karaoke staple status let you forget what it‚Äôs really about.\n\nAdvertising\n\n47. ‚ÄòGoing Back to Cali‚Äô by LL Cool J\n\nFrom Al Jolson to Led Zeppelin and Phantom Planet, dozens of artists have tapped into the westward dream of the Golden State. Heck, the tradition stretches back to Gold Rush ditties of the mid 19th century, Smithsonian Folkways fodder like ‚ÄòLife in California.‚Äô But only one man made the trip wrapped in precious metals, not seeking them. Cool J cruises to the coast, as he proclaims in verse, in a Corvette with a Laurents chrome chain steering wheel, Dayton wire rims and a gold-leaf convertible top. Rick Rubin‚Äôs stark 808 beats thunder under the extremely relaxed rhymes of Mr. Ladies Love. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going back to Cali,‚Äô he nearly whispers before shrugging it off. ‚ÄòHmm, I don't think so‚Äô He might go, he might not. With his riches, he is a walking California. That‚Äôs cool. Cool enough to pull off one of the few sax solos in hip-hop history.\n\n48. ‚ÄòThe Distance‚Äô by Cake\n\nWith the band‚Äôs signature horns and a self-serious melody that practically requires head-bobbing and Speed Racer‚Äìesque intensity (you may even want to invest in racing gloves), this single off of 1996‚Äôs ‚ÄòFashion Nugget‚Äô album is irresistible. The album is filled with more on-the-nose driving songs than this one (‚ÄòRace Car Ya-Yas,‚Äô ‚ÄòStickshifts and Safetybelts‚Äô), but this is the money single‚Äîand got the album platinum status. Throw it on repeat and hit the open road. Just take an occasional break for track No. 7, the band‚Äôs excellent cover of Gloria Gaynor‚Äôs ‚ÄòI Will Survive.‚Äô\n\nAdvertising\n\n49. ‚ÄòRoadrunner‚Äô by the Modern Lovers\n\nTalk about a brilliant juxtaposition: Jonathan Richman‚Äôs 1972 cut, written when he was 19, beautifully contrasts the Velvet Underground‚Äôs bare-bones, dirty-as-hell chugalug sound with a subject matter so suburban that Richman‚Äôs heroes Lou Reed & Co. wouldn‚Äôt dare touch it: The thrill of being young, driving in a car and blasting the radio. The song‚Äôs repetitive two-chord propulsion is a perfect late-night road-trip pick-me-up. And there‚Äôs a bangin‚Äô cover by Joan Jett & the Blackhearts to check out, too.\n\n50. ‚ÄòHave Love, Will Travel‚Äô by the Sonics\n\nAt some stage in your life‚Äîat any point between getting your driver‚Äôs licence and getting married, really‚Äîyou‚Äôll drive from ‚ÄòMaine to Mexico‚Äô for a piece of ass, as Gerry Roslie does in this proto-punk classic. The high-tension twang of the guitar sounds like the strings are about to snap, the perfect sonic emulation of sexual frustration. A recent ad for Mexican beer claims you need an ‚Äòencyclopedic knowledge of garage rock‚Äô to pull up this song, as if from some lost, dusty volume. Nah, this is Rock & Roll 101."
