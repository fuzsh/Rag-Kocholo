        "text": "Jay Simons is the president of Atlassian.\n\nHe joined the company in 2008 as vice president of sales and marketing to lead Atlassian's pioneering efforts to develop a high-velocity, low-touch sales model. Jay's overseen the company's global expansion, introduction of its Starter License program (a disruptive approach to \"freemium\" where the company donates all proceeds to a charitable cause), and its growing worldwide customer community and programs.\n\nJay has more than 20 years of experience in the software industry. He began his career at Plumtree Software where he held a variety of senior marketing and sales roles. Significantly, Jay oversaw the company's expansion throughout Europe and Asia Pacific. When Plumtree was acquired by BEA Systems in 2005, Jay became vice president of marketing for BEA Systems, which was later acquired by Oracle in 2008.\n\nJay serves on the board of directors for HubSpot and holds a bachelor's degree in political and environmental science from the University of Washington.\n\nLinkedIn\n\nMartin Seibert states on his profile page:\n\n\"I am passionate about Atlassian Software. I am currently helping to introduce Linchpin, a Confluence-based intranet solution and a SAFe solution called Agile Hive to our customers. I have been working on and in //SEIBERT/MEDIA for our customers and employees since I was 17. I founded the company in 1996 and it now employs about 180 people in Wiesbaden (Germany) and USA. In 2018 we made about 30M US$ in revenues and have been profitable as a company for many years. We offer agile software development and are one of the five biggest Atlassian partners worldwide.\n\nIt took me many years to understand that only teams can be successful. But that was years ago. Now, I want everyone to understand and spread the word that teams are the things that rock. Be it in your own company or when looking at //SEIBERT/MEDIA, it's always teams that \"rock'n'roll\" with software.\"\n\nFind Martin on social media: Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Xing, Quora, YouTube, ...\n\nSee his complete profile\n\nThis speaker also appears in:"
