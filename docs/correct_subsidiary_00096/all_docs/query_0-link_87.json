The following table lists recommended values for a user, a group, and AquaLogic User Interaction directories.\n\nThe same values for these users, groups, and directories should be used across all machines hosting portal components. Local users and groups with fixed IDs are recommended. Secure deployments should avoid NIS users for machine security. Using the same local user and group for all AquaLogic User Interaction services allows an administrator to lock down host machines and audit activity.\n\nFor convenience, preinstall.sh, a script to create users, groups and directories, is provided in the Product Center.\n\nThe Pre-Install Script: preinstall.sh\n\nThe preinstall.sh script creates a user, a group and directories with permissions appropriate for BEA AquaLogic User Interaction. The script is interactive, asking you a series of questions about the values to be configured.\n\nFor a one-machine install using the standard values, the preinstall.sh script can be used as-is. The following values can be specified dynamically as the script runs:\n\nIf the user or group you designate to the script to use already exists, the script does not attempt to create them.\n\nTo run the script, complete the following steps:\n\nWindows User Requirements\n\nTo install portal components, you must log in to the host machines as the local administrator.\n\nVirtual Memory Requirements for .NET Portals\n\nIf you are running your portal on .NET, you must configure the AquaLogic Interaction host machine to run using 3 GB of virtual memory. To do so:\n\nNote: You must add the /3GB flag to the boot.ini file correctly; editing this file incorrectly might negatively affect the stability of your portal machine. For this reason, we strongly advise that you refer to appropriate documentation at msdn.microsoft.com when performing this procedure. If you experience technical difficulties, contact Microsoft support."
