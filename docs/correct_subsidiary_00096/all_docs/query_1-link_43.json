These estimates come from someone who my family knows, who works at Berkeley. She says this is 90% what I’ll get.</p>\n\n<p>vs</p>\n\n<p>**-Emory ** full ride (our family income is low)</p>\n\n<p>Some tidbits:</p>\n\n<p>My major would be Computer Science, and I would minor in French Literature. Eventually, business (Wall Street) and politics would be of interest, and/or perhaps some involvement with Computer Science (Google, artificial intelligence etc).</p>\n\n<p>I would either want to go to graduate school for CS, or get a top MBA.</p>\n\n<p>I hold some very liberal views, along with some other more conservative ones.</p>\n\n<p>I love Californian politics, while I never cared for Georgia.</p>\n\n<p>Haas proximity would be nice, but it’s not a necessity.</p>\n\n<p>Berkeley is big, which I like, while Emory is more international?</p>\n\n<p>Berkeley is near Silicon Valley, and is famous for CS</p>\n\n<p>I REALLY want to live and/or get internships in NYC. I love New York. Emory might be better for this?\n\n(L.A/Sil.Val. are great too though)</p>\n\n<p>So… Emory or Berkeley?</p>\n\n<p>Wow, tough decision. I would normally recommend Emory for the small classes and the free ride. Cal freshman classes are huge and I suspect Cal is quite a pressure cooker because you don’t even get accepted into your major until junior year and I imagine you have to have a certain GPA to get into some majors. Cal is also struggling financially. On the other hand, for CS, Cal has the name recognition and is close to companies where you could intern and/or co-op. If you were majoring in straight science or French and poli sci, I would recommend Emory, but for CS or engineering, I think Cal gets the nod.</p>\n\n<p>Well, it seems that if you want to go to business, you need to go to graduate school. So I assume you shouldn’t be so concerned about recruiting right out of undergrad. I ** highly** recommend you visit Berkeley and Emory. I can tell firsthand as a Norcaller, Berkeley isn’t for everyone at all. Theoretically the same applies for Emory.</p>\n\n<p>Since you’re going to do a masters and your family is in a tough financial position, I highly recommend you look into Emory.\n\nYou will get just as great opportunities there. Personally speaking, I’m not quite sure of Berkeley undergrad…I remain skeptical, but I suggest you research this with a counselor or parents or some higher educated individual.\n\nSure Berkeley Computer Science is top notch, but I’m not sure how that’s relevant to an undergraduate education…I can be wrong. But why not try Berkeley for graduate school?</p>\n\n<p>I’m sure plenty of Emory grads come to the Bay Area for jobs. Its not biggie.</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in both CS and Business… (rankings based on USNews)</p>\n\n<p>-Cal’s undergrad business is #2. Emory’s is #13 I believe. Rankings in general are to be taken with a grain of salt. However, proximity to the prestigious Haas COULD grant you stronger opportunities than proximity to Goizueta, IMO.</p>\n\n<p>-Cal’s graduate computer science is #1… Emory isn’t even ranked. (And yes, graduate school prestige DOES influence the undergraduate atmosphere. You will be among much more CS people. You will have some of the most prominent CS figures within a short walk… however you would need to take advantage of this for the benefits to manifest themselves. I’ll assume you have strong initiative.)</p>\n\n<p>Emory’s cost is unbeatable, but Berkeley would be cheap. Graduating with less than $16,000 of debt is something many would envy.</p>\n\n<p>Emory has no football team…</p>\n\n<p>Emory might be more “international” when looking at percentages, however perhaps Berkeley’s size brings more internationals overall.</p>\n\n<p>As for living locations… you listed NYC, Silicon Valley, and Los Angeles. 2 in CA, but none in GA! You also said you care about CA politics, not GA politics.</p>\n\n<p>Most of Berkeley’s classes are small. I read some statistics that reported the distribution of Berkeley class sizes vs those of some private schools… and they were almost identical. (Does anyone have those statistics?)</p>\n\n<p>Berkeley name recognition is worlds ahead of Emory… though Emory is still fine in that regard.</p>\n\n<p>You’re interested in Google, Artificial Intelligence, and Silicon Valley… not CNN, Coca Cola, or the CDC.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and your username…</p>\n\n<p>Go to Berkeley.</p>\n\n<p>OP, there is a huge gap that separates Berkeley CS to Emory CS and both the academic people and the top employers in the IT industry are very much aware of such gap. While Emory is good, Berkeley is just excellent for CS. It is consistently ranked within the very top CS dept in the US - solid top 3. You’re also going to get paid much more having a Berkeley CS degree than an Emory CS degree.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re interested in business, I suggest that you take up MBA instead. Many successful people who’ve founded IT companies have not studied business at undergrad, but CS or EECS.</p>\n\n<p>\n\n[quote]\n\nFounders and co-founders</p>\n\n<pre><code>* Tom Anderson, B.A. 1998 - co-founder of social networking website MySpace (acquired by News Corporation for $580 million)\n\nStephen D.

This nonsense advice of “saving Berkeley for grad school because it’s the only thing it’s good for” is tiring. This may be the OP’s only chance of getting into Berkeley for his/her intended major. </p>\n\n<p>Also, if the OP eventually wants to settle back down in California (family located here) vs. the South, Berkeley would be a better option. </p>\n\n<p>\n\nYes, and they are awesome undergrad programs as well.</p>"
