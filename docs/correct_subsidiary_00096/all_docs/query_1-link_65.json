Establishing our Advisory Board with world-class leaders in the cybersecurity arena will help us continue to advance innovation for our clients and allow us to consistently deliver leading edge Machine Identity and Access Management solutions.\"\n\nIn today's digital landscape, vulnerable APIs have become the preferred attack vector for hackers, posing significant risks and costs to enterprises across various sectors, including national security, manufacturing, healthcare, and financial services. With the average cost of a data breach in the US now at $9.4 million and the majority of traffic moving across our networks and the cloud being API-driven not UI-driven, securing machine-to-machine communication is critical. Corsha is pleased to introduce its Advisory Board members, who will contribute their category and industry insights as we innovate to enhance application security for our clients. Each Advisory Board member brings unique expertise and backgrounds to the team, playing a vital role in guiding Corsha's growth and strategic objectives.\n\nAbout Corsha\n\nCorsha is a D.C.-based cybersecurity startup that has come up with a novel way to secure machine-to-machine communication, whether that “machine” is a workload running in the cloud or a piece of industrial IoT equipment on a shop floor. Many companies today leverage static secrets such as keys, tokens, and certificates in order to secure communication between machines, but these secrets are getting leaked at an alarming rate and high-profile enterprises across the public and commercial sectors continue to suffer data breaches due to vulnerabilities surrounding these insecure non-person connections. Corsha has developed a Zero Trust security platform that sits at the intersection of machine identity, Zero Trust and API Identity. They are focused on elevating machine identity, enforcing strong authentication and access for systems and services, and securing critical service-to-service traffic such as:\n\nHybrid OT to IT communication\n\nSecure movement of data across networks\n\nAutomated software supply chains\n\nAutomated security operations centers (SOCs)\n\nCloud-native communication within/across Kubernetes clusters\n\nCorsha’s patented technology builds dynamic identities for trusted machines and brings MFA to the world of APIs for greater security, visibility, and control of our application ecosystems. Corsha's Zero Trust Security Platform is fully automated, cloud-native, highly scalable, and platform agnostic."
