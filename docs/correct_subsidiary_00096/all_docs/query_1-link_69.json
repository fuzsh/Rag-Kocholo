Many software vendors, including BEA Systems, IBM Software, MySQL AB, Novell, Oracle, Red Hat and SpikeSource, distribute their software in downloadable, pre-installed virtual machine environments as part of the VMware Technology Network (VMTN). Software distribution in VMware virtual machines allows these vendors to more easily bring new technology to users for development, evaluation, testing and validation. Instead of spending time installing and configuring applications, developers, QA teams and IT organizations are able to focus their efforts on development and testing.\n\nFor more information, please visit www.vmware.com/isvsupport and www.vmware.com/vmtn/vm.\n\nAbout VMware, Inc.\n\nVMware, an EMC company (NYSE: EMC), is the global leader in virtual infrastructure software for industry-standard systems.
