He serves on the boards of BrowserStack, HubSpot and Zapier, and he is actively involved with investments in Locus and Sentry.\n\nPrior to BOND, Jay was the President of Atlassian and part of its early leadership team that scaled the company from startup to IPO. During his 12 years at Atlassian, Jay pioneered a go-to-market model that expanded to hundreds of thousands of customers worldwide - from SMBs to the Global 1000 - and achieved ~$2 billion in annualized revenue. He also helped lead 22 acquisitions and strategic investments, propelling the company into adjacencies such as workflow automation, security, and real time communications.\n\nBefore Atlassian, Jay was Vice President of Marketing at BEA Systems (acquired by Oracle in 2008). At the start of his career, Jay held senior marketing and sales roles at Plumtree Software, which went public in 2002 and was acquired by BEA Systems in 2005."
