        "text": "Hi,\n\nI am using documentum 5.3Sp6 for managing web content ,SCS source and target for content publishing to weblogic portal servers and content services\n\nfor BEA weblogic portal to integrate BEA virtual repository with weblogic portal.Now I am planning for upgrade to D6.5 Sp2 and are looking at alternative publishing architecture due to following problem...\n\nI am upgrading weblogic portal from 9.2 MP2 to 9.2 MP3 or maybe weblogic 10.X.Content services for BEA weblogic are supported only for weblogic 9.2 MP2\n\nas per their documentation and there is no content services for BEA weblogic in D6 product/Service roadmap.\n\nPls suggest an alternative integration solution as I am stuck with the content services for BEA weblogic and would like to have better alternative...My requirement is still the same \"Publish web content onto portal server machines but it's the content display on portal which is the issue.\"\n\n\"Publish web content onto portal server machines but it's the content display on portal which is the issue.\"\n\n- Is the display of the content done through portal software or through content services you refer to? If you are strictly publishing the content to the portal server machines, then in reality, DCTM is no longer part of the picture once it has been published. If the content services is used to retrieve metadata about the content, you can configure SCS to publish metadata as well.\n\nHi Johnny,\n\nI am using content services for BEA weblogic (provided by documentum) and publishing both content and metadata.Also,my portal application\n\nis deployed as an EAR and content is in a different directory.The problem I am facing is the content services for BEA weblogic product roadmap\n\nas EMC does not certify this product for weblogic 9.2 MP3 and 10.x.But now since I am upgrading to D6.5 sp1,I would like to explore a better\n\narchitecture at portal server end for displaying my published content.I want to get rid of dependency on \"content services for BEA weblogic\"\n\nas it seems that EMC is not keen on implementing oracle content management interfaces post D6.\n\nSaurabh,\n\nWe were in the same situation and i agree with you. EMC is not providing any roadmap for \"Content services for weblogic\" beyound 8.1 version of weblogic.\n\nIn fact i have talked to their technical team and response was really vague. After further research they clarified saying that it is not supported for D6 also.\n\nSo we had to find alternative ways to display content. I used DM JDBC services and ran queries againt _s and _r tables in the SCS schema. We are still in the process of implementing D6.5 version and weblogic 10.3. I'll update you as i find some solution.\n\nThanks\n\nSai Peddiboyina\n\nWithout knowing what your portal app does, its nearly impossible to answer your question. If your portlet only browsers cabinets/folders to get to content and display metadata, you can duplicate this by publishing the metadata for documents/folders. If you are using Inbox to perform workflow tasks, then you pretty much have to develop your own portlet. You should be able to \"decompile\" your existing portlet and build your own.\n\nHello Sai,\n\nWe are facing the exact same problem here. There's no current supported SPI implementation to access Documentum's content directly from WebLogic Portal's Virtual Repository.\n\nHave you found any 'straightforward' way of doing something like this?\n\nI mean, if we use Documentum's SCS what we get is static files directories, which are not tasty for Portlets built on WebLogic Portal.\n\nAre DCTM JDBC Services 'easy' to consume from WLP Portlets?\n\nThanks a lot for your help, we are almost drowning here .\n\nBest regards,\n\nHector Castro."
