        "text": "Does every single employee have his own portal? That’s how it sometimes appears to frustrated IT managers seeking to streamline their infrastructures.\n\nIn the past several years, many enterprises have seen portals—or tiny intranet sites that users think of as portals—spring up like dandelions. Frequently created by an enthusiastic power user with little or no IT oversight, portals may belong to a satellite office, a department or a functional group of employees (such as salespeople). They may be little more than a welcome screen and a half-dozen links, or they may be true transactional sites used by customers and trading partners.\n\nToday, businesses are waking up to the fact that portal proliferation is a potentially expensive mess at best and a disaster waiting to happen at worst. As a Gartner Inc. report in October 2003 put it, “Many enterprises—instead of easily reaping rewards from their portal implementations—find themselves dealing with a jungle of multiple portals that compete for the same resources and audiences.”\n\nThe resulting expense is difficult to track, because small portals are scattered across geographic regions and lines of business. “You want to save money eventually [by consolidating portals], sure,” says Steve Ellis, executive vice president at Wells Fargo & Co.’s Wholesale Services division. “But it’s almost as important just to understand where that part of your spend is going.”\n\nTracking content on unauthorized and unsupervised portals is essentially impossible, a circumstance that sets the scene for disaster, given today’s strict accountability regulations. Laws such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act require enterprises to monitor and control all outward-facing communication.\n\nOrganizations seeking to consolidate portals are soon confronted with a number of thorny technology issues. “Each [existing] portal has different tool sets, languages and approaches to content and applications,” says Frank Torbey, a consultant at TandemSeven Inc., a Plymouth, Mass.-based firm that helps large businesses build portals. Log-on and user-identity features may also be handled differently, he adds.\n\nToday, businesses typically have separate portals for employees in general, the sales force, customer service and perhaps suppliers. Each portal must access data from a range of applications (human resources, payroll, CRM, ERP, supply chain management, accounting and purchasing) and then add a presentation layer. When a company considers consolidation, IT’s challenge is to rationalize existing portals into one system that addresses the data, functionality, personalization and authentication needs of all users.\n\nThe good news for IT managers is that there are more tools available for portal consolidation than there were a few years ago. Longtime portal specialists such as San Francisco-based Plumtree Software Inc. and Austin-based Vignette Corp. are facing competition from nearly every major vendor of enterprise software.\n\nThis widespread availability of portal software has altered the purchase decision landscape, according to Torbey. “Many of our clients started their portals with a Plumtree or a Vignette,” he says. “But if that company is a heavy SAP user and now they see SAP has a strong portal offering, do they migrate [all their portals] to SAP?” Torbey says many TandemSeven clients face a similar decision if their company is heavily invested in IBM, PeopleSoft Inc., Oracle Corp. or Microsoft Corp. applications.\n\nEllis says Wells Fargo’s investment in BEA Systems Inc.’s enterprise software played a major role in the San Francisco-based company’s decision to use BEA’s WebLogic Portal to create a consolidated portal for employees. “We already used BEA for application servers, and that connection was important because it simplified pulling data and workflow out of [existing applications],” he says.\n\nA few years ago, businesses seeking to implement portals were likely to perform a “runoff” among leading portal-software specialists. Today, Torbey says, the choice is different: A large company is likely to be a customer of at least a few vendors that now offer portal tools, so the question is, which one does the company migrate to?\n\nIf that seems like an easier choice, think again. In late 2001, Whirlpool Corp. in Benton Harbor, Mich., decided to streamline its portals picture.\n\n“We had a lot of Web sites that people called portals—less than 50—but we were headed down that [proliferation] path,” says Gil Urban, Whirlpool’s information systems director. Various Whirlpool factories, regional offices and business units had each thrown together Web sites or portals.\n\nInitially, the manufacturing giant leaned toward Plumtree’s portal software, which Urban describes as “the leader at the time.” But Whirlpool’s goals expanded when the company decided to develop a portal for all 15,000 of its employees. “We’re a heavy IBM user with lots of IBM infrastructure,” Urban says. As a result, Whirlpool opted to use IBM’s WebSphere Portal, even though he thought some competitors’ products were superior at the time.\n\n“In 2001, it was a good product, but not best in class,” Urban says. “But we thought that in the future it would be the best, and now it is.”\n\nHere’s where things get complicated, though, not just for Whirlpool but potentially for other large businesses: The manufacturer is also a major user of SAP enterprise applications. When Whirlpool selected IBM, SAP’s NetWeaver portal product wasn’t yet available. Now that it is, Whirlpool is implementing a split strategy that will tack an SAP front end onto WebSphere Portal for the 2,000 or so employees accustomed to working with SAP. “Those 2,000 will have an SAP interface to the operational side,” Urban says. “But for standard employee services, they’ll be on MyWhirlpool,” the company’s IBM-based portal.\n\nContent Management\n\nWhen companies start to consolidate portals, one of the big headaches they run into is scattershot content updating. Depending on the enthusiasm and expertise of employees, some departments diligently update their portals or Web pages—while others may lag behind by months or even years.\n\nThat was the case when the nation of Bermuda undertook a project to convert its 38 departmental portals and Web sites into a single portal that would serve citizens, businesses, tourists and government workers. Bermuda’s government considered more than a dozen vendors before settling on Plumtree. According to Nigel Hickson, Bermuda’s e-commerce chief, content management and related workflow were key Plumtree differentiators.\n\nBermuda plans to designate a content maintainer in each government agency, then train agency workers to fill out templates provided in Plumtree Content Server. IT has created standardized portlet templates so content maintainers don’t have to worry about issues such as formatting. For example, when an e-mail address or phone number changes, the maintainer simply calls up a “Contact Us” portlet, keys in the new data and saves.\n\nLike many other organizations, Bermuda’s government early on decided to blow up its existing portals and Web sites and rebuild from scratch. Hickson says that in the long run, this involved less work and made for a cleaner final product than would have been possible through integration.\n\nWhat happens next varies by agency—that’s the flexibility Hickson likes. “In the Department of E-commerce, it’s just me,” he says. “So the approval process, such as it is, consists of me checking my spelling.” In a larger agency with a more defined workflow, the people who need to sign off on a change are automatically notified that the content maintainer has made one.\n\nGetting a grasp on the myriad Web, intranet and portal sites that most businesses have is a task more and more IT managers are facing. But much of the work is just a matter of excising unneeded content—Ellis says Wells Fargo turned 10,000 pages of content into 2,000—and a variety of applications automate significant parts of the process.\n\nThe taxonomy products offered by portal vendors can help with this consolidation. Taxonomy tools use Web services to scan other data sources, such as Web pages, for new or deleted content, thus automatically updating an enterprise portal directory. Without such a directory, the applications and content in the portal can result in sprawl."
