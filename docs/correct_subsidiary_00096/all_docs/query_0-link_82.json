        "text": "Careers of alumni\n\nWhat can you do with a degree in Computer Science? Some computer science graduates have moved into industry (as programmers) or entered graduate programs (from applied sciences to medicine to law).\n\nStill others have pursued entrepreneurial/business routes, found a home in the evolving world of digital media, or used their computational skills to move into finance, banking, or health care.\n\nPut simply, computer science serves as an entryway into just about every scientific and business-related field, and increasingly acts as an accelerator for success in academia and industry.\n\nIn fact, our alumni have been going into so many different fields and areas, that we find it difficult to keep up with them and maintain this page…\n\nCareers By Area\n\n“I found that being around so many intelligent and motivated people inspired me to think very big about what I wanted to do in my own life.\" Danielle Feinberg ‘96, Pixar\n\nSome examples of areas you can explore are\n\nArtificial Intelligence: Develop computers that simulate human learning and reasoning ability.\n\nComputer Architecture: Design new components and systems for everything from high-performance, networked parallel machines to low-cost and lowpower iPods.\n\nComputer Design and Engineering: Design new computer circuits, microchips, and other electronic components.\n\nTheoretical Computer Science: Investigate the fundamental theories of how computers solve problems, and apply the results to other areas of computer science.\n\nInformation Technology: Develop and manage information systems that support a business or organization.\n\nOperating Systems and Networks: Develop the basic software that computers use to supervise themselves or to communicate with other computers.\n\nSoftware Applications: Apply computing and technology to solving problems outside the computer field - in education or medicine, for example.\n\nSoftware Engineering: Develop methods for the production of software systems on time, within budget\n\nOccupations post graduations\n\nThe following is a table of where our students go post graduation, though it’s hard to keep this table updates as career options for CS graduates keep expanding!\n\nPrimary Occupation Post Harvard % Computer Software, Hardware, Systems 23 Banking, Finance, Communications 11 Engineering & Science 11 Education 8 Full-time student 7 Law 6 Consulting 6 Medicine, Healthcare, Public Health 5 Arts, Government, Politics 5 Other 18\n\nAlumni Stories\n\nSalil Vadhan ‘95\n\nGordon McKay Professor of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, Harvard University\n\nAfter completing his undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at Harvard, Salil Vadhan received a C.A.S. in Mathematics from Cambridge University (1996) and then went on to earn his Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at MIT (1999).\n\nHis primary research interests are in computational complexity theory, cryptography, randomness in computation, and the interplay between these areas.\n\nGary Schermerhorn ’85\n\nCo-Chief Operating Officer for the Technology Division of Goldman Sachs, with operational oversight of the division’s business units* Schermerhorn joined Goldman Sachs (in Equity Systems) in New York in 1990, and has headed technology for the NASDAQ Business Group as well as the Asset Management Group.\n\nHe became a managing director in 1998 and a partner in 2000. In addition to gaining a lifelong friendship with Harvard College Professor Harry Lewis, Schermerhorn also met his wife, Miriam Esteve ‘85 (Applied Math), at Harvard. She now serves as Head of Operations and Technology for the Global Wealth Management Division of Citigroup.\n\nDanielle Feinberg ‘96\n\nLead lighting artist at Pixar Animation Studios\n\nAs lead lighting artist at Pixar Animation Studios, Feinberg led the team that rendered the aquatic universe in Finding Nemo, from the surge and swell of plant life to the bounce and pop of billions of bubbles. Her exposure to computer graphics began at age eight with designing spirographs in LOGO.\n\nToday she has a list of future classics to her credit, including A Bug’s Life; Toy Story 2; Monsters, Inc.; and most recently, The Incredibles and WAL-E.\n\nEven More\n\nCS empowers you to solve problems in all sorts of domains.
