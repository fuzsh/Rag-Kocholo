His focus is primarily cyber-security and machine intelligence, looking for companies that seek to push the boundaries of what is possible and aim for long term independence. Prasanna was a member Mithril’s investment team (that’s Peter Thiel’s growth fund), and before that he was a Lead Engineer at Plumtree Software Inc., which was later acquired by BEA Systems in 2005 (and itself acquired by Oracle in 2008). He is a QUT IT graduate.\n\nPlease come join us for our monthly robotics meetup, and as always, feel free to bring your ideas and robots to show off - we'll open the floor for project introductions and pitches.\n\nAgenda\n\n• 18:15 - 18:30 Welcome and BRIG introduction, Juxi\n\n• 18:30 - 18:45 IEEE QLD; Luis Mejias Alvarez\n\n• 18:45 - 19:00 About startups; Prasanna Srikhanta\n\nFollowed by\n\n- some tours through the robotics lab\n\n- robotics discussions, questions, answers, and maybe some basic hands-on\n\n- more cold beverages\n\nThanks to the Group’s sponsors: QUT, the ACRV, and the IEEE QLD Joint Chapters on Control Systems/Robotics and Automation Society."
