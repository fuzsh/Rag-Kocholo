        "text": "11.1 About the Integration with Plumtree Corporate Portal\n\nThe integration between Oracle Access Manager and Plumtree Corporate Portal provides companies with a Web enterprise solution for building customized, secure business portals with integrated, identity-based Web access management.\n\nIn the integrated solution, Plumtree Corporate Portal acts as a gateway to an enterprise intranet or extranet, providing users centralized access to a broad variety of applications and content hosted by the enterprise.\n\nOracle Access Manager provides a robust identity management and access security system to accurately track and manage the identities of Plumtree Corporate Portal's employees, customers, and partners. Oracle Access Manager also provides a common enterprise security and user identity infrastructure that controls access to Plumtree Corporate Portal as well as to other enterprise applications and resources.\n\nThe integration supports single sign-on (SSO) between the applications within the portal framework and the enterprise Web applications that are secured by the Access System.\n\nThis integration offers these major benefits:\n\nSingle Sign-On: The Access System's single sign-on services offer authorized users a secure connection with minimal authentication challenges to the resources that they need. Users need to log in only once to gain access to all resources that they need at a given level of authentication. The access provided by Access System's single sign-on services improves user efficiency, productivity, and user satisfaction.\n\nDelegated Administration: Oracle Access Manager offers delegated administration capabilities that complement those of Plumtree Corporate Portal. Oracle Access Manager's delegated administration distributes responsibilities for managing identity and security policy information. Users can update some of their information; managers, suppliers, and partners can set up, change, and delete user identity information.\n\nUser and Group Management: Oracle Access Manager manages an LDAP directory server that contains user identity information. Plumtree Corporate Portal synchronizes its own user database with the LDAP directory. This eliminates the need to create and manage separate identity profiles for each application.\n\nOracle Access Manager also provides strong group management capabilities, including support for static, dynamic, nested, and hybrid groups. The Identity System manages the group information that the Plumtree Corporate Portal application uses to personalize the portal. Group affiliation is immediately reflected in the portal without manual changes.\n\nCentralized Security Management: Oracle Access Manager provides a common security management platform for all applications within an enterprise. This facilitates the maintenance of consistent security policies across an entire enterprise.\n\nUser Personalization: Oracle Access Manager enables you to personalize portal content based on any user attribute, such as job title.\n\nThis integration does not change the users' experience in Plumtree Corporate Portal. Users can continue to access the portal guest pages without logging into Plumtree Corporate Portal. When a user attempts to log in, the Access System intercepts the request and uses an authentication scheme to determine whether the user is authorized to access the portal. Those who are not authorized are denied access to Plumtree Corporate Portal.\n\nFigure 11-1 illustrates how Oracle Access Manager components protect the Plumtree Corporate Portal.\n\nFigure 11-1 Overview of Plumtree integration\n\nThe following summarizes the integration.\n\nTask overview: Integrating with Plumtree\n\nEnabling single sign-on for the Plumtree Corporate portal as described in \"Enabling Single Sign-on in PlumTree 5.0.4\" on page 11-4.\n\nIn the Plumtree installation, you set up single sign-on and LDAP authentication sources, edit configuration files to support single sign-on, and then synchronize data from the Oracle Access Manager LDAP directory with the data in the Plumtree database.\n\nSetting up the Access System to protect the Plumtree Corporate portal as described in \"Setting Up the Access System to Protect Plumtree 5.0.4\" on page 11-8.\n\nIn the Access System, you create policies that specify the content that you want to protect. Policies are created in the Policy Manager.\n\n(Optional.) Allow anonymous users to view the portal guest pages and creating a banner for the portal as described in \"Integrating Other Features\".\n\n(Optional.) Personalize user pages, and embed Identity System identity management functions as described in \"Integrating Other Features\".\n\n11.3 Enabling Single Sign-on in PlumTree 5.0.4\n\nThis section describes the following tasks for enabling single sign-on on the Plumtree portal:\n\nCreating a Single Sign-On Authentication Source\n\nCreating an LDAP Authentication Source\n\nEditing Configuration Files to Support Single Sign-On\n\nSynchronizing LDAP Data with Plumtree Database\n\nEnabling Single Sign-On Logout\n\n11.3.1 Creating a Single Sign-On Authentication Source\n\nAuthentication is the process of users proving their identity to a server. After users present their credentials to the server, authentication plug-ins process those credentials. To enable the Access System to authenticate users and groups on Plumtree, you must create a single sign-on authentication source so that the Access System can authenticate users and groups in the Plumtree portal. To do this, you must first create a single sign-on password to use when you configure the single sign-on authentication source.\n\nTo create a single sign-on password\n\nLaunch the Plumtree Administrator Control Panel application and navigate to Start, select Settings, select Control Panel, then click Plumtree Administrator.\n\nThe Plumtree Administrator dialog box appears.\n\nClick Single Sign-On.\n\nEnter an SSO secret key.\n\nNote:\n\nThis secret key can be any string of characters. Make note of the string.\n\nClick OK to close the Plumtree Administrator dialog box.\n\nTo create a single sign-on authentication source on Plumtree\n\nLog in to Plumtree as the administrator. Click Administration. The Administration Menu appears.\n\nClick Authentication Folder. In the Create Object drop down box select Authentication Source-SSO. The Authentication Source Wizard appears.\n\nEnter the single sign-on password.\n\nClick Validate Options to confirm that this password matches the secret key you entered in the Plumtree Administrator Control Panel.\n\nOn the Properties and Names page, enter a name and description for the new authentication source. Describe the source carefully, as this description appears in a list during Authentication Source setup.\n\nSpecify the properties for the Authentication Source.\n\n11.3.2 Creating an LDAP Authentication Source\n\nTo update the Plumtree database with the current user and group information, you must synchronize users and groups in the Plumtree database with information in the LDAP directory. To do this, you must first create an LDAP Authentication Source to import users and groups data from the LDAP directory into your Plumtree portal. To create an LDAP authentication source on Plumtree.\n\nLog in to Plumtree as the administrator and click Administration.\n\nThe Administration Menu appears.\n\nClick Authentication Folder. In the Create Object drop down box, select Authentication Source-SSO. The Authentication Source Wizard appears.\n\nIn the Authentication Source Category box, type the prefix used to distinguish the users and groups imported from this domain. For example, if you enter myDomain, each user name and each group name will be prefixed by the string myDomain. Thus, myUser becomes myDomain\\myUser and myGroup becomes myDomain\\myGroup.\n\nYou can set the category to any value you want, but after you create this authentication source, you cannot change this value.\n\nTemplates can populate configuration options with common default values. To use an existing template to populate the values in this editor, choose one from the Template list.\n\nAdd values under LDAP Settings to facilitate portal access to the LDAP server from which you are importing users. Consult online help for instructions.\n\nTo confirm the domain you entered, click Validate Options.\n\nAfter the portal has attempted to find the domain, it displays a message stating whether it connected successfully or not.\n\nIf the validation fails, check for errors in your settings.\n\nIf the validation succeeds, go to the Synchronization page.\n\nSelect the single sign-on authentication source you created earlier from the list labelled Select an Authentication Partner. Select Full Synchronization.\n\nOn the Schedule page, select Create a Job/Add a Job for this Authentication Source. Consult online help for instruction on creating or adding a job.\n\nAdd appropriate properties on the Properties and Names page.\n\n11.3.3 Editing Configuration Files to Support Single Sign-On\n\nBy default, the portal expects Oracle Access Manager to forward the user name header named uid. If you configure Oracle Access Manager to forward a user name header with a different name, you must configure your single sign-on implementation as BasicSSO service. For details about BasicSSO service, see the PlumTree Administration Guide.\n\nConfigure elements under the <Authentication> parent element in the PTConfig.xml, as detailed in Table 11-1.\n\nTable 11-1 Parameters In Ptconfig.xml\n\nParameter Value\n\nThe following example enables integration with an Oracle Access Manager authentication server:\n\n<SSOVendor value=\"3\"/><DefaultAuthSourcePrefix value=\"HQ\"/><CookiePath value=\"/\"/><CookieDomain value=\".company.com\"/><SSOCookieIsSecure value=\"0\"/>\n\n11.3.4 Synchronizing LDAP Data with Plumtree Database\n\nData synchronization ensures the updating of information on group memberships and users, which is crucial for portal access and personalization. You can synchronize data manually or automatically at specific time intervals. To synchronize manually, you schedule a job and run it once for immediate synchronization. For periodic synchronization, you schedule a job to run at specified time intervals.\n\nAfter you run a job, you can view its status to see if it ran successfully. When a job has run successfully, you can view the replicated LDAP data in the Plumtree database.\n\nCaution:\n\nInitial full synchronization requires a long time if you have many entries.\n\nYou must fully synchronize at least once to enable single sign-on between Plumtree and Oracle Access Manager.\n\nTo automatically synchronize data\n\nOn the Plumtree portal host, navigate to Control Panel, then Services, and verify that the Plumtree Job Dispatcher service has started.\n\nLog in to Plumtree as the administrator, then click Administration.\n\nIn the Administration Menu, navigate to the Administration folder, click Jobs, then select the job you earlier created / added for the LDAP Authentication Source. The main settings page appears.\n\nSpecify the time period when the synchronization job is to be run.\n\nThe Edit Job User page also provides options for checking the job log and history through the Job History tab. It also lets you check security-related options.\n\nTo manually synchronize data\n\nOn the Plumtree portal host, navigate to Control Panel, then select Services, and verify that the Plumtree Job Dispatcher service has started.\n\nLog in to Plumtree as the administrator, then click Administration.\n\nIn the Administration Menu, click the Administration folder, select Jobs, then select the job you earlier created / added for the LDAP Authentication Source. The main settings page appears.\n\nSelect Run Once - Now option in the settings. This job runs once, starting immediately.\n\n11.3.4.1 Viewing Synchronized Information\n\nAfter synchronization has been completed, you should be able to see all the users and groups from the LDAP data source replicated in the Plumtree database.\n\nTo view the updated Plumtree database\n\nIn the portal, click Administration.\n\nIn the Administration Menu, click your administration folder.\n\nExpand the Users tab. The user names will be prefixed with the LDAP source name.\n\nFor example:\n\nLDAPUsers\\Accounting Managers\n\nIn a Group folder, you can also view the members of the groups.\n\n11.3.5 Enabling Single Sign-On Logout\n\nWhen a user clicks the PlumTree Log Off button in an Access System-protected PlumTree session, users are logged out from PlumTree, but the ObSSOCookie generated for the users is not killed. Hence, the Oracle Access Manager session for that particular user remains active. Users need to customize the PlumTree logout functionality to facilitate logout from PlumTree as well as Oracle Access Manager.\n\nConsult \"Customizing the Portal UI: Using Plumtree Event Interfaces (PEIs)\" section in \"Enterprise Web Development Documentation\" on the PlumTree Web site for information on modifying the PlumTree UI. Users need to implement the \"OnBeforeLogout\" interface as:\n\npublic virtual Redirect OnBeforeLogout(Object _oUserSession, ApplicationData _appData) { PTDebug.Trace(Component.Portal_UI_Infrastructure, TraceType.Error, \"Before logout event\"); String myCookie = _appData.GetCookie(\"ObSSOCookie\"); if(myCookie != null) { Redirect myredirect = new Redirect(); myredirect.SetLinkToExternalURL(\"http://<AccessManager_Server_Name:port>/access/oblix/lang/en-us/logout.html\"); return myredirect; } return null; }\n\n11.4 Setting Up the Access System to Protect Plumtree 5.0.4\n\nTypically, users click the Login button to log in to the Plumtree Corporate Portal. Once they are authenticated, they can view their personalized pages. To log out of the portal, users click the Logout button. In an alternate configuration, you might want all users to see a guest portal, then authenticate users only when they log in to the portal. (If you have enabled user access to the guest pages, then any user can go the main portal page and view those guest pages without ever logging into the portal).\n\nWhen a user attempts to login, the Access System authentication policy challenges the user. Once the Access System authenticates the user, it checks to see if the user is authorized. If the user is authorized, an ObSSOCookie and a header variable are sent to enable single sign-on into Plumtree. The user is then logged in to Plumtree.\n\nYou can configure the Plumtree Corporate Portal so that when users log out, they are automatically logged out of both Plumtree and Oracle Access Manager. To set up the Access System's single sign-on service for Plumtree, after you have installed the Access System, you must create policies in the Policy Manager that specify the content you want to protect.\n\nSetting up the Access System to protect Plumtree consists of the following tasks:\n\nInstalling Oracle Access Manager Components\n\nCreating a Policy Domain\n\nConfiguring the WebGate\n\nConfiguring WebGate for IIS\n\n11.4.1 Installing Oracle Access Manager Components\n\nTo integrate with Plumtree, you must install the following applications:\n\nIdentity Server\n\nAccess Server\n\nWebPass\n\nPolicy Manager\n\nWebGate\n\nTo enable the Access System to protect the portal, install a WebGate on the Plumtree Corporate Portal Web server.\n\nNote:\n\nYou can install the Identity server, WebPass, and Access System on the same server. However, Oracle recommends that you do not install the Identity Server and WebPass on the server where Plumtree has been installed. For more information on installing and configuring Oracle Access Manager, see the .\n\n11.4.3 Configuring the WebGate\n\nConfigure your WebGate following the procedure appropriate for your portal deployment in the :\n\nWebGate for Apache\n\nWebGate for IIS\n\nUse the version of the WebGate that matches the version of your Oracle Access Manager.\n\nTo see the supported versions and platforms for this integration, refer to Metalink as follows.\n\nTo view information on Metalink\n\nGo to the following URL:\n\nhttp://metalink.oracle.com\n\nClick the Certify tab.\n\nClick View Certifications by Product.\n\nSelect the Application Server option and click Submit.\n\nChoose Oracle Application Server and click Submit.\n\nTo set up the WebGate for Apache\n\nOn the host computer for the Portal Server, install the version of Apache required by the WebGate.\n\nNote:\n\nThe version of Apache provided by Plumtree and described in the Installation Guide for Plumtree Corporate Portal cannot be used with the WebGate. You must download the required Apache version from the Apache Web site.\n\nOn the host computer for the Portal Server, install the WebGate for Apache. For details, see the.\n\nOn the Web application server to which the portal application is deployed, modify the Web application server setting to turn off URL rewrites. For details, refer to your Web application server documentation or Plumtree Knowledge Base article DA_239501, \"Configuring Web Application Servers to not Rewrite URLs.\"\n\n11.4.4 Configuring WebGate for IIS\n\nInstall the version of the WebGate that matches your Oracle Access Manager.\n\nTo set up WebGate for IIS, run the WebGate for IIS installer on the host computer for the Portal Server.\n\n11.5 Integrating Other Features\n\nOracle Access Manager offers several other features that you can integrate with Plumtree such as allowing guest users to view portal pages, personalizing user pages, and embedding other identity management functions into your portal. You can also set up single sign-on to other portals, and manage passwords and self-registration.\n\nThe following tasks are discussed in this section:\n\nEnabling Anonymous Users to View Portal Guest Pages\n\nUsing the Knowledge Directory\n\nPassword Management\n\nSelf-Registration\n\n11.5.1 Enabling Anonymous Users to View Portal Guest Pages\n\nYou can allow anonymous users to access guest pages without logging into the portal. To do this, you must create a policy domain in the Access System that uses the Anonymous authentication scheme for the Oracle Access Manager Anonymous user. The Anonymous authentication scheme is a default that is supplied with the Access System.\n\nThis allows users to go to the main portal page and view guest pages without being challenged by the Access System.\n\nYou then lock the NetPointAnonymous account to allow anonymous users to view the guest pages without logging into the Plumtree portal. When a user goes to the main portal page but does not log in, the Access System logs in the user as NetPointAnonymous and creates an ObSSOCookie for this anonymous user. The ObSSOCookie is sent to the Plumtree portal but the portal treats the user as a guest because the account is locked. Thus, the user can view guest pages.\n\nTo create a policy domain for guest access\n\nLaunch the Policy Manager and click Create Policy Domain.\n\nIn the General tab, enter a name and description for the new policy domain.\n\nIn the Resources tab, select HTTP as the resource type.\n\nTo use a host identifier, create a host identifier in the Access System Console.\n\nYou must add a fully qualified host name as one of the host name variations; for example, plum1.oracle.com.\n\nSee the for more information.\n\nSelect the portal URL prefix from the list or create a new one. For example, /portal.\n\nIn the Default Rules tab, click Authentication Rule and from the Authentication Scheme list, select Anonymous Authentication.\n\nThis enables a user to view guest pages without logging in to Plumtree.\n\nIn the Policies tab, enter the following information:\n\nName: Enter a name for the policy.\n\nDescription: Enter a description of the policy.\n\nResource Type: Select HTTP.\n\nResource Operations: Select GET.\n\nHost ID: Enter the ID of the portal host.\n\nResource: Select /portal.\n\nURL pattern: Enter admin/loginoblix.asp.\n\nHost identifiers: Enter the host identity.\n\nQuery String: Enter a query string.\n\nQuery String Variable: Enter User ID as the name and 2 as the value.\n\nNote:\n\nThe Netscape Web server is case-sensitive. Do not change the case of the query string variable name.\n\nClick Save to save the policy.\n\nIn the Policies tab, click the name of your policy.\n\nThe policy details page appears.\n\nClick Authentication Rule and create an authentication rule.\n\nYou can use any authentication scheme such as Basic over LDAP or any custom authentication scheme.\n\nIn the Authorization Rules tab, select Actions, and add a header variable that you specified in the file oblix.asp.\n\nTo facilitate single sign-on, you must specify this header variable to direct Plumtree to look for this header variable as described in \"Editing Configuration Files to Support Single Sign-On\".\n\nIn the Return Attribute field, enter the Login ID attribute and click Save.\n\nEnable the policy domain.\n\nOn the Plumtree Portal, lockout the user as described in the section \"To lock the NetPointAnonymous account\".\n\nTo lock the NetPointAnonymous account\n\nOn Plumtree, log in as the administrator to the portal.\n\nClick Users and click the folder that matches the authentication source category you created as your LDAP authentication source.\n\nClick the user for the Anonymous authentication scheme.\n\nIt will have the prefix of the name you gave to the LDAP authentication source.\n\nIn the user page, select Lock this User so it cannot be used for login.\n\nThe NetPointAnonymous user becomes the equivalent of the Plumtree guest user.\n\nNote:\n\nIf you want to log in to Plumtree with the Plumtree database credentials (such as administrator), you must first authenticate yourself to Oracle Access Manager and then click Login as a different User. The Plumtree Login screen appears and you can log in as a different Plumtree user.\n\nTo log in to Oracle Access Manager as a different user, first click Logoff to log out of Plumtree and then click Login. The Login box appears, and you can log in as a different user.\n\n11.5.2 Using the Knowledge Directory\n\nThe PlumTree 5.0.4 Knowledge Directory is a portal area that users browse to discover document records containing links to documents that have been uploaded by users or crawlers. Users can add Identity System links and Access System-protected resources links to the knowledge directory. Whenever a user tries to access links in the knowledge directory, the ObSSOCookie for that user, if it exists, is passed to the resource for user authentication, thus facilitating single sign-on.\n\nThe knowledge directory information is organized into subfolders in a manner similar to file storage volumes and shares. The default portal installation includes a Knowledge Directory root folder with one sub-folder named Unclassified Documents. Before you create additional subfolders, you must define your Knowledge Directory taxonomy, as described in the Deployment Guide for the Plumtree Enterprise Web.\n\nThis section discusses the following topics:\n\nSetting Preferences in the Knowledge Directory\n\nCreating Folders\n\nUploading Documents\n\n11.5.2.1 Setting Preferences in the Knowledge Directory\n\nYou specify how the Knowledge Directory displays documents and folders, including whether to generate the display of contents from a Search Server search or a database query, by setting Knowledge Directory preferences.\n\nTo set Knowledge Directory preferences\n\nClick Administration.\n\nIn the Select Utility list, click Knowledge Directory Preferences.\n\nSpecify preferences according to the instructions provided through online help.\n\nClick Finish.\n\n11.5.2.2 Creating Folders\n\nTo create a Knowledge Directory folder, complete the following procedure.\n\nTo create a Knowledge Directory folder\n\nNavigate to Directory, then click Edit Directory.\n\nNavigate to the folder into which you want to place a new subfolder.\n\nLaunch the Folder Editor.\n\nSpecify a name and description, then click OK.\n\nSelect the Edit Details icon, then complete the settings according to the instructions supplied in the online help.\n\n11.5.2.3 Uploading Documents\n\nTo upload documents to the Knowledge Directory folder, complete the following procedure.\n\nTo upload a document\n\nBrowse to the folder where you want to upload the document.\n\nFrom the Submit a Document list, choose Simple Submit or choose a data source.\n\nComplete the submission forms as described in the online help.\n\nUse filters to control what content goes into which folder. A filter sets conditions to sort documents into associated folders in the Knowledge Directory. Please see PlumTree documentation for more details.\n\n11.5.3 Password Management\n\nThe password policies that you set on the Access System are always enforced because Oracle Access Manager manages passwords and the Access System evaluates the policies when a user logs in to the portal.\n\nUsers who are not logged in to the Plumtree portal must have access to the Lost Password feature in Oracle Access Manager. This enables users who have lost their passwords to set a new one. See the for details.\n\nTo enable password management, you must create appropriate policies in the Access System. You also need to use the knowledge directory to upload a document that contains a link to the Lost Password Management feature in Oracle Access Manager. See \"Using the Knowledge Directory\" for details.\n\nNote:\n\nOracle recommends that you back up configuration files before you modify them.\n\n11.5.4 Self-Registration\n\nYou need to enable, manage, and configure self registration. To enable self-registration, the appropriate self-registration workflow must be created in the User Manager. See the for details. This workflow is used in the self-registration portal insert. To manage self-registration, you need to use knowledge directory to upload a document that invokes the Identity System self-registration feature. See \"Using the Knowledge Directory\" for details. The Plumtree database must then be synchronized to be updated with the newly created user."
