Ten Square makes these transactions work harder -- for retailers, advertisers and consumers -- by delivering valuable, relevant information to customers through the ATMs, gas pump displays and credit-card readers retailers already have in their locations. In the process, it gives people something to do while they wait for their transactions. Ten Square is the only broadbase marketing strategy that gives consumers something they want, right when they want it -- without taking any of their time, money or effort. Information and promotions go from advertisers to retailers and directly to consumers through existing point-of-service devices connected to the Internet. By eliminating the conventional delivery methods, costs or media, Ten Square offers merchants the ability to provide their customers with a virtually limitless variety of useful services through the Ten Square digital network.\n\nCurrently, enterprise businesses are looking for ways to improve information flow, productivity and enable real-time decision making while supporting a growing remote workforce.
