G L O S S A R Y: RETURN ON INVESTMENT (ROI) A measurement, expressed as a percentage, of the total value of a given investment divided by the cost of the investment. Example: a $100 investment is worth $133 one year later, yielding a one-year ROI of 33.3%. INTRANET A private network, similar to the Internet and using the same protocols and technology, that is contained within an enterprise. It may consist of many inter-linked local area networks (LANs), desktop computers, websites and portals, and email system(s). CORPORATE PORTAL A primary website on the enterprise intranet. A web-based gateway to most, if not all, tools and information on the enterprise intranet. The portal can be a ‘catch all’ for all of the intranet, or a business unit or function specific portal (i.e. Sales or HR portal). Finding ROI 3 © 2001-2009 Prescient Digital Media\n\n4. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY As with any critical business system, an intranet or portal must deliver measurable performance and remain accountable to the investment. If the site’s value is not being measured, then it risks failing the needs and demands of employees and management. When asked how executives determine whether an intranet or portal is delivering value, most people typically point to reducing costs and improving productivity. Of course, IT budgets are increasingly tied to company-wide business and strategic initiatives. The cost justification for any expenditure, including IT must have a clear bottom line that answers the question, “What’s the payback?” In recent years, business challenges and subsequent solutions/ applications have been the driving force behind intranet investments. They will continue to play this role in the future. Executives will make investments in intranets and portals (see definition in the adjacent glossary) if such investments spur growth, cut the cost of operations, and/or help enhance the customer experience (retaining and building the customer base). The challenging economic climate means that more and more organizations will allocate dollars to IT systems and applications that can demonstrate a measured solution and ROI to a business problem or provide enhanced service and growth. ROI A N A L Y S I S: AGGRESSIVE STUDIES: ROI: > 1000% > payback in 8-24 weeks CONSERVATIVE STUDIES: ROI: 23% to 88% > payback in 1-2 years Measuring the precise value of an intranet or portal is likely impossible. It is, at best, an imperfect science. However, more and more organizations are measuring the ROI of their intranet investment. While only a handful of technology companies measured intranet ROI a few years ago, there are encouraging signs of change. A study, Finding ROI 4 © 2001-2009 Prescient Digital Media\n\n5. conducted by Prescient Digital Media Ltd., found that 6% of organizations undertake ongoing, specific measurement of the ROI of their intranet, while occasional measurement is undertaken by 26% of the respondent organizations. While extensive ROI measurement has not yet become mandatory at a majority of organizations with intranets, ROI is considered a priority by 76% of the survey respondents.

Finally, while appraising the ROI of an intranet or portal is critical for most executives, there exists a great deal of untapped, intangible value that is perhaps even more critical than the measured dollars and cents. When properly deployed, intranets improve communication, collaboration and employee satisfaction, which in turn can improve productivity. All benefits are clearly important to any organization, but not always a measurable ROI. Finding ROI 5 © 2001-2009 Prescient Digital Media\n\n6.

HR Intranets, Corporate However, intranets and corporate portals Leadership Council, June 1999; can be extremely complex systems and, META SURVEY: Microsoft.com) therefore, at times, expensive endeavors. Despite the expense, many organizations understand the implicit and/or explicit value and are willing to make notable intranet investments. A study, published in 2002 by the UK Department of Trade and Industry, revealed intranet and extranet adoption at about 60% of North American, UK, German and Swedish companies. A 2001 META Group study of Global 2000 companies found an adoption rate of 85% for implemented or developing intranets. It is not only large multi-nationals that understand the benefits and potential rewards of a well-funded, high- value intranet. According to Modalis Research, more than 70% of all small and medium-sized businesses, including government agencies and not- for-profit organizations, believe that having an intranet is important and either have an intranet or plan to deploy one (2001 study). C A S E S T U D Y: Cisco System’s intranet portal, Cisco Connection Online, is the source of much pride and significant ROI for the California-based technology giant. While Cisco clearly understands the inherent value of the intranet, it also carefully tracks and measures specific ROI benefits including purchasing, expense reporting, printing and distribution, and more. Cisco estimates that the total ROI savings for its entire intranet in fiscal 2003 surpassed $2.1 billion. Finding ROI 6 © 2001-2009 Prescient Digital Media\n\n7. The growing popularity of portals, perhaps the hottest intranet system or application today, was highlighted in a report by Gartner, which estimates the enterprise portal market as a whole grew at a rate of 16.5 percent and now tops $1.1 billion. In fact, IBM estimates that the portal market topped $1.4 billion in 2008 (with IBM leading this market segment with about 1/3 of all sales). However, despite the investment, very few organizations measure the value of the investment. While early intranet deployments benefited communications, sales and marketing, and human resources, other corporate areas including operations, manufacturing, customer service, engineering, finance, and IS/ IT are also reaping the rewards. However, while implicitly understanding an intranet’s value is second nature for many leading organizations, measuring the value remains a significant challenge. C A S E S T U D Y: Rogers Communications is a major telecommunications company with over 100 locations across Canada. With its national reach and need to remain competitive, Rogers implemented a new corporate-wide HR portal. Prior to doing so Rogers engaged in a thorough assessment of its internal environment as a precursor to developing a strategic plan. The ensuing plan included detailed functional recommendations, the information structure detailing the portal’s navigation, creative design, content recommendations, and a business case indicating current and future ROI. Before the implementation of the new corporate-wide HR portal, Rogers faced efficiency and practical issues such as multiple intranet sites in each operating company, content that was not maintained or badly maintained, and duplication of information on various sites. The plan saw the creation of a new enterprise HR portal, HR Xpress. The new portal attracted greater use and an increased awareness of other intranet sites for an estimated $100,000 in annual administrative savings.

Once planned, executed and launched, an Internet, intranet or extranet site cannot rest on its laurels. The pace of technology, customer and employee demands, and competitive pressure require that an intranet achieve and exceed expectations and continually show measured value. As with any critical business system, the intranet must be delivering measurable performance and remain accountable to the investment. If you are not measuring your site’s value, then you risk failing the needs and demands of customers, employees and management.

ROI DILEMMA Appraising the value of corporate intranet While 76% of and portal investments is, at best, an respondent imperfect science. In fact, most analysts organizations believe contend that precise ROI measurement ROI to be important is not possible due to an intranet’s or very important, only expansive and far-reaching nature. 6% of organizations However, while measuring the precise undertake ongoing, ROI may not be achievable, there are specific measurement of means by which many organizations the ROI of their intranet. can and do quantify both potential and existing ROI. Generally speaking, intranet ROI can be lumped into one of three broad categories: 1. Hard savings that result from the cost avoidance of printing or distributing documents 2. Latent, soft savings from enhanced access to information, communication, collaboration, and decision-making, among other things 3. Increased revenue as a result of an intranet implementation The principal challenge for appraising intranet ROI is that it is often easier to assess the ROI of specific applications deployed on an intranet than measure the ROI of infrastructure and/or the portal itself. In fact, most demonstrable ROI case studies highlight application ROI – such as employee self-service and e-procurement – rather than the ROI of the entire intranet or portal. Hence the chicken-or-egg dilemma: you cannot aggregate and deploy high-value web applications without the underlying infrastructure, but it is difficult to justify the infrastructure investment without the greatly desired ROI from such high-value applications. Not at all 23 To what extent is your organization measuring Only guesswork 24 the ROI of your intranet or portal?

Prescient’s Intranet ROI study found that while 76% of respondent organizations believe ROI to be important or very important, only 6% of organizations undertake ongoing, specific measurement of the ROI of their intranet. Occasional Finding ROI 9 © 2001-2009 Prescient Digital Media\n\n10. measurement is done by only 24% of organizations and 51% either do no measurement (or guess). Finally, while most ROI is thought to come from specific applications, it is important not to lose sight of the role the intranet home page and information architecture in delivering this application ROI. It is helpful to think of the intranet as the “shopping mall” to the application “stores”. Why do stores like the Gap, Target, Nordstrom’s, etc. locate in malls? Malls exist because they attract a lot of shoppers and therefore retailers like the Gap are willing to pay a lot of rent to realize the sales and ROI that come from those shoppers. If the shopping mall doesn’t exist, a lot of retailers lose out. The stores don’t get the sales, and they don’t get the ROI. The intranet benefits applications as the mall benefits stores; intranets drive traffic to applications which reap the big ROI. C A S E S T U D Y: A European hospital intranet had 8,000 different guideline documents (e.g. relating to medical procedures, etc.) – with no search engine. Traditionally, users (doctors and other professionals) had to navigate a folder structure. A discussion with the hospital’s risk manager revealed that the hospital spent $5 million in insurance. But, if they could put in a search engine to help doctors find medical guidelines within 30 seconds, they could reduce their insurance substantially. The hospital spent $100,000 on the search engine, and received full pay-back within 3 months, and saved $1 million in insurance as a result. (Source: Martin White, Intranet Focus, 2009 INHERENT VALUE It is the less tangible, inherent intranet benefits that are the most difficult to measure, and potentially the most valuable. The implicitly understood and inherent worth of a corporate intranet is often likened to the value of a telephone system. As with the phone system, most organizations, if asked, could ascribe an inherent, latent value to the intranet. Has your organization ever been asked to measure the ROI of its phone system? Not likely. Most people and organizations inherently know and understand the value of the phone and don’t require Finding ROI 10 © 2001-2009 Prescient Digital Media\n\n11. a detailed ROI balance sheet. Most organizations and executives know full well that the telephone is a mission-critical instrument for most, if not all, organizations. In many ways, intranets are like telephone systems – they assist us in accomplishing mission-critical work all the time. Yet, much of their value is latent, with unseen savings that are inherently or implicitly understood. Likening a robust intranet or corporate portal to a telephone system will help to illustrate your case, but it likely won’t persuade your CFO or accountant to open the vault. To do that, you need to provide tangible, measured intranet ROI. There are three general approaches for measuring intranet ROI: 1. Ascribe the intranet a value equal to the investment, dollar in equals dollar out 2. Ascribe a non-monetary value to the intranet as a collaborative communication and knowledge management asset 3. Measure and appraise specific benefits from implementing an intranet and/or corporate portal The first two approaches are rather obvious, but should not be ignored by any organization. However the third approach – measuring specific benefits – is the most precise and tangible means for quantifying intranet ROI. To this end, the ROI measurement of specific intranet benefits is the focus of this paper. C A S E S T U D Y: In 2000, brash Oracle CEO Larry Ellison made waves when he announced Oracle would save US$1 billion in operation efficiencies through their internal e-business initiatives. Oracle’s 2000 savings include $200 million from consolidated IT; $550 million in improved customer relationship management (CRM); $150 million in e-procurement savings; and $100 million in savings from employee self-service tools (particularly HR tools). In 2001, Oracle forecasted an expected savings of $2 billion with the majority coming from improved CRM.

HARD COSTS Hard cost savings and avoidance – from paper reduction and reduced information distribution, to labor reductions – are the most commonly reported ROI benefits, and perhaps the easiest to find and calculate. BENEFITS: • Reduced paper printing and circulation • Software downloads rather than manual installation • Headcount reduction and savings resulting from automated functions • Reduced or eliminated processing errors 2. SALES Many successful sales organizations rely on sales software and web applications to improve their sales success. Online sales tools allow sales representatives to access greater volumes and media-rich (multimedia) information faster than previously possible – driving increases in sales. Intranet sales tools vary from applications that allow the sales force to enter and access customer data, track sales leads, forecast sales and profit margins, schedule joint meetings and more. BENEFITS: • Better customer service leading to more sales • Reduced time to market for promotions • Increased collaboration amongst sales people • Enhanced collaboration between reps and customers • Migration of sales brochures to the web C A S E S T U D Y: PR agency Ketchum deployed a portal to increase sales for the company. Using an independent research firm, META Group, it was estimated that the Ketchum intranet could lead to revenue growth between 0.5% (conservative estimate) and 5% (liberal estimate). Using 2000 revenues of $167 million as a baseline and a compound annual growth rate of 10%, Ketchum could increase its sales by $18,350,640 (using moderate estimates) over 3 years.

C A S E S T U D Y: The SodhexoUSA intranet (see Best practices case study: Sodexho USA) features a highly innovative, and valuable sales generating tool. SuperSleuth is an intranet application that encourages employees to submit sales leads and prospective clients via the intranet. Successful leads submitted via the SuperSleuth intranet page generate cash rewards of up to $1000 for the person making the submission. Sodexho says it has contributed to a 100% increase in sales leads in the past year and led to US$90 million dollars in managed volume (net client sales including sales by client). SuperSleuth is an intranet based tool that would be no means receive that volume of leads nor generate the dollars it does without the intranet to drive those leads.

Initial benefits will include email simplification which will dramatically cut-down on the number of document copies – sometimes up to 5,000 – being sent as an email attachment. While this annual benefit has been estimated in the six-figure range, it also aims to cut in half the amount of ‘information search time’ – sometimes up to 50-60% of an employee’s time – producing a potential savings of CDN$45 million per year on an initial EDMS investment of CDN$1 million.

C A S E S T U D Y: The answer to any question at Cisco Systems is “Check the Website” (intranet or Internet). By webifying most of its customer service functions – questions, answers and tools – through their intranet and Internet sites, Cisco is able to resolve 70% of help desk calls online. As a result, Cisco has accrued savings of US$86 million saved through electronic downloads and $107 million through online configuration and documentation while increasing customer satisfaction by 25%.

HUMAN RESOURCES While the business culture, personal compensation and the opportunity for advancement are all critical motivators of employees, many employees will also cite the ‘right tools to do the job’ as a prime motivating factor. By arming employees with the right tools and technology to perform their work, employee satisfaction and retention rates will be greater while improving productivity and saving money. BENEFITS: • Higher employee retention • Reduced training expenses • Reduced knowledge loss and resulting competitive threat • Improved productivity and reduced ‘downtime’ due to employee desertions Mitre Corp. estimates that it saves US $860,000 a year in clerical staff overhead by using online, automated property tracking, in lieu of physical audits, (600 clerks across the company at US$9 per hour for four weeks). Additionally, Mitre calculates that the intranet enabled it to retain 15 teleworkers that would have otherwise left the company, saving Mitre about US$300,000 in recruiting costs during 1998 (about US$20,000 per employee).

B E N C H M A R K: To enhance existing training programs and to find cost savings Compaq introduced online training in mid-1995. Today Compaq’s Learning Utility is a single interface and search and retrieval tool to access to all training courses and information resources at the global computer company. The Utility supports both novice and expert users and provides access to proprietary, vendor and local content and is divided into three categories: Licensed Courseware (from market vendors such as SmartForce and business specific companies such as Microsoft, Cisco, etc.), Compaq Specific Courseware (Compaq product specific courses, etc.) and Documentation (downloads of hardware/ software manuals, sales advisory guides, etc.). In total Compaq’s Learning Utility offers over 3000 courses and over 5000 documents. In 2000, total learning downloads (and courses taken) equaled 342,412 with the average download cost reduced from $9.59 in 1999 to $7.78 in 2000. Excluding travel costs that would have been saved by employees having to previously travel to attend training, the Utility achieved total annual savings surpassing US$13 million in 2000.

In August of 2000, AGENT began to rollout a number of HR self-service tools for employees as part of a three year plan. Online self-service includes accessing, updating and managing personal information for compensation, benefits, absence tracking, personal contact information (including emergency contacts), and time benefits including flextime. Planned tools to be phased in include expense claims, updating information on dependents, online training, full benefit selection and full time tracking. AGENT’s self-service program has a three-year budget of CDN$4.8 million with a budgeted return on investment of CDN$1.3 million per year.

A BALANCE While precisely measuring the ROI of an intranet’s far-reaching benefits would be difficult for even the best accountants and auditors, measuring just a few of the surface benefits can sway even miserly CFOs to open the coffers. As demonstrated by the many examples, benchmarks and case studies highlighted in this white paper, many successful intranet organizations do achieve and measure significant ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ intranet ROI. This ROI is often more than enough to justify the intranet or portal’s existence and frequently achieves a higher level of appreciation as a value added, mission-critical business necessity. Generating significant return on investment is not reserved solely for large organizations; small and medium-sized organizations also extract measured value from their intranets and portals. For example, the American Medical Association in Chicago has only 1,400 employees, yet has deployed 50 to 60 intranet applications. Despite its small size, the AMA estimates that the return on investment for its HR self-service tools had hit 40% by early 1999.

INTRANET 2.0 Like Web 2.0, Intranet 2.0 represents the evolving collection of social media tools that are revolutionizing the intranet, and the way organizations and employees connect and collaborate. Specifically, Intranet 2.0 tools like blogs, wikis and social networking sites promote collaboration, people connection, and ongoing dialogues that augment, but not replace the traditional top-down communications model.

Rowe Price adds 1,500 workers to work in its call center for each tax season (for approximately 3 months). Training these workers is large, involved exercise, but imperfect. Price’s corporate trainers got smart and transferred the entire train- ing program to a wiki. Price encouraged new employees to take notes during the sessions and then add notes, comments and rec- ommendations to the wiki. As a result, the company estimates that it saves one to two minutes per call at $20 per minute (the net result is in the millions of dollars).

C A S E S T U D Y: Sabre, the company that runs most of the world’s airline flight reservation systems among many other systems, is an impressive example of the power of Intranet 2.0. With about 9,000 employees, they are a medium-sized company that have embraced Intranet 2.0 with spectacular results. Building from scratch, Sabre launched their own intranet social networking site for employees (built on Ruby on Rails) called SabreTown. SabreTown has all the features of most social networking sites: • Employee profiles with lots of details • Shared photos • Blogs • User commenting • Network connections & feeds • Enterprise question & answer functionality On Sabre Town, users can post a question to the entire organization, and the site’s inference or relevance engine will automatically send the question to the 15 most relevant employees (based on what they’ve entered in their profile, blog postings and other Q&As that have been previously posted). The results have been spectacular: 60% of questions are answered within one hour; each question receives an average of 9 responses. The system has already led to more than $500,000 in immediate, direct savings for the company, with much greater benefits not yet measured. SabreTown’s success is summarized in one spectacular metric: 65% of all Sabre employees became active SabreTown members in the first 3 months! More than 90% of employees are active today. Forrester estimates the enterprise Web 2.0 (Intranet 2.0) collaboration market will hit $1.8 billion by 2013. According to Forrester, social networking tools and internal wikis will have the greatest impact on workplace collaboration (see Forrester Projects Which Enterprise Web 2.0 Collaboration Technologies Will Grow, Which Will Decline). Technologies such as forums and RSS have a future in the enterprise but are currently underused, while podcasts have a limited future as an enterprise tool to increase productivity and enhance collaboration. Whether you’re ready or not, your organization can no longer ignore Intranet 2.0. Employees are reading blogs on the web, contributing to wikis, listening to podcasts, and networking via Facebook, MySpace, Orkut, or others. Moreover, they’re probably talking about your organization, and you’re not part of the conversation. Finding ROI 24 © 2001-2009 Prescient Digital Media\n\n25. Before they implemented their own employee social networking site, MyBT, BT (British Telecom) discovered that 4,000 employees had voluntarily joined a BT Facebook community in their own time. Employees were connecting online, in their own time, talking about BT, and BT wasn’t part of the conversation. “Many believe that trying to stop social media tools seeping onto intranets is a futile activity anyway, so it is better to introduce them on your terms C A S E S T U D Y: BlueShirt Nation (BSN) is a secure and private social networking site for more than 100,000 Best Buy employees. Established by Best Buy as a means of engaging employees for ideas for innovation and improving the business, the online community encourages discussion about whatever they want to talk about (e.g. pets, sports, etc.). “In general, they talk about how to make Best Buy a better place,” says founder and sponsor Gary Koelling. “Improve on the things we don’t do well, share the things that we do do well, talk about and express the culture that we have, talk about customers- both good and bad.” Some control was sacrificed to help increase the engagement which among other things encouraged employees to participate in a video contest that promoted their 401k retirement campaign. Employees were encouraged to upload their own videos to the site as part of the contest (see a sample at Best Buy Using Social Media for Employee Engagement). Out of 140,000 Best Buy employees (almost all young), BSN helped increase the number of employees signing up for 401(k) accounts by 30%, and no doubt has contributed to a significant increase in employee retention in a tight staffing market. in a managed way,” says BT’s social media chief Richard Dennison, who quite candidly shares this though and BT’s work on his blog Inside out. While BT’s management was reluctant to introduce these tools to employees, they really had little choice: employees were already using them and BT was in danger of being left out, and left behind. Adds Dennison: “If you don’t think about what value you can deliver in an enterprise 2.0 environment, you are going to become irrelevant!!” Intranet 2.0 has indeed exploded at BT. In addition to social networking, BT employees blog, podcast, collaborate in discussion forums, and they wiki too. In fact, the wikis are so popular and successful that there are Finding ROI 25 © 2001-2009 Prescient Digital Media\n\n26. more than 750,000 employee wikis – and the vast, vast majority of them are dedicated to business topics that help BT compete in the global workplace. According to Prescient Digital Media’s study on Intranet 2.0 (with more than 430 participating), these numbers are very average indeed (though much, much lower in medium size, and small organizations) and echoed by many recent studies: most organizations have not introduced Intranet 2.0 tools, but want to. C A S E S T U D Y: At Placemaking, the entire intranet is built on a wiki platform (Intranet case study: Intrawest Placemaking). A Placemaking project manager using the intranet (wiki) created a page about a method of finishing concrete floors that creates an appearance better than tile at a substantially lower cost – saving the company $500,000 and reducing the project timeline. Other project managers in Florida and Nevada posted comments to the page, asking further questions and adding comments. In response, Hartigan posted photos of the finished job and addressed their comments. The other construction managers planned on using this valuable knowledge in future projects, potentially saving the company millions of dollars. Many, many others of course have blazed that trail and so while some organizations struggle with the ‘how’, IT and communications managers need only look to the trailblazers like BT, IBM, and many others that have shared their successes. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADOPTION: Adopting an intranet wiki or blog however should not be done without the requisite planning and change management. Here are a number of suggestions for proceeding: 1. Listen - Understand and monitor the social web to see what is being said about you, and ask your customers / employees what they want. 2. Monitor - Ensure you’re aware of which community websites (e.g. YouTube) your audience and competitors are using 3. Benchmark - Understand the ingredients of a good blog, wiki or podcast; watch and cherry-pick from the leaders 4. Leadership – Senior management must set the tone; your executives must be leading the dialogue and controlling the message Finding ROI 26 © 2001-2009 Prescient Digital Media\n\n27. 5. Plan - Planning is an essential requisite for success; develop a plan that is based on a thorough assessment and contains key performance indicators (KPIs) 6. Governance – very tool needs an owner and a policy (terms of use) 7. Technology - choose your vendors carefully based on business requirements & needs 8. Refresh – keep your content and tools relevant and fresh, and ensure they cross-promote your latest products and services 9. Measure - Document the link between social media and the business and develop a set of performance metrics with baselines that are regularly measured 10. Engage – gather constant feedback and act quickly on necessary changes Finally, consider an Intranet 2.0 undertaking as “evolution not revolution” – there’s no need to solve the world on your first attempt; test and pilot solutions and enhance as necessary before trying to conquer the world.

ENTERPRISE INFORMATION PORTALS A portal is a door or gateway of importance. Your custom-built or content management driven intranet home page may be a portal. However, the enterprise portal solution (sometimes referred to as the Enterprise Information Portal (EIP)) is a multifaceted piece of software that has some distinguishing features from an average intranet home page. The enterprise intranet portal solution has three distinguishing characteristics: • advanced user personalization capabilities; • security (authorization and authentication); and, • enterprise application integration (EAI, the software and processes that link together or integrate an organizations many applications (e.g. ERP, CRM, HR applications). Silver bullets that solve all your problems are rare in life; and nearly non-existent in the intranet world.

Some solutions like the powerful Oracle Portal or IBM WebSphere Portal come with hundreds of portlets, many, many bundled applications, and a bevy of plug-in suites and additional solutions with some big and complex tools unto their own including: • Search • Content management • Document management • Records management • Digital asset management • Business process management Finding ROI 28 © 2001-2009 Prescient Digital Media\n\n29. • Web 2.0 tools (blogs, wikis, etc.) • Collaboration suites (e.g. team pages) • Analytics and reporting • Development platforms, tookits and ‘factories’ Although the EIP solution may sound ideal, rarely does a ‘silver bullet’ solution exist. These and other powerful enterprise portal products from Sun, Vignette, SAP, and the ubiquitous Microsoft SharePoint (MOSS 2007), have massive horse-power capable of solving complicated business requirements. The catch: it comes at a price, and an opportunity cost. For starters, most of the above functionality, often referred to as utility applications, are ‘thin’ versions of stand-alone products.

However, Plumtree is realistic in their approach and cautions that “quantifying costs and benefits is a necessary exercise, but not a science.

The firm was planning to serve as a national co- coordinator for thousands of product-liability claims against a major client. But new ideas were needed when it was deemed impossible to set up a physical presence in 50 states, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Finding ROI 35 © 2001-2009 Prescient Digital Media\n\n36. Dozens of local law firms were recruited to act as ‘local counsel’ on behalf of Eckert Seamans to handle claims in their own states. The network connecting them all is the Eckert Seamans extranet, which contains all related documents, including briefs, transcripts, interviews, research, medical and scientific information, and correspondence. This provides clients with a consistent nationwide defense by making sure that all the lawyers are literally on the same page. In addition, it saves time and money by providing those geographically dispersed partners with research to strengthen the cases in their states. And the extranet lets the firm’s 215 lawyers co-ordinate cases like never before. The system didn’t come cheap. It is estimated that Eckert Seamans has invested US $1.3 million so far, including construction costs to create a separate technology centre. Eckert Seamans is concerned about security breaches – and not just from hackers. The firm must protect against possible security breaches involving the very partners for whom it established the intranet – those local-counsel firms. They are working together for now, but they are still competitors relying on a combination of firewalls, multiple passwords, and encryption to make sure those faraway lawyers get access only to the appropriate cases and only for the length of their contracts.

As traveling sales people have limited time in their hotel rooms at night, it was important to spare them the hassles of switching from database to database, application to application. The new portal called My Global Source, was put together with multiple portal vendors. Currently, 2,000 Hyperion employees use the enterprise portal, and the company is in the process of adding a version for outside distributors. And that opens new issues – primarily security-related.

Publishing management process. that once took hours, can take seconds with the right rules and templates. Not surprisingly, an intranet study published by Melcrum Research showed that the number one issue facing intranet managers is content management. The number three issue was content overload. Sales of web content management software was estimated to reach nearly US$1 billion by 2010, and will grow at an annual rate of 15% through 2012 (representing 25% (Source: “Survey data: Management of the intranet and of the total ECM issues companies face” – Melcrum Research Report, market). Managing and Developing Intranets for Business Value,) Of course, one of the biggest drivers behind content management is the push for efficiency and cost savings. Specific drivers and principles of content management include: Finding ROI 37 © 2001-2009 Prescient Digital Media\n\n38. • Create and publish content in a timely manner • Organize content to support work processes • Delineate roles and responsibilities for managing content • Develop policies to guide content processes • Create personalized ‘workspaces’ • Use one tool to publish information across different sites • Reduce site creation, maintenance, and deployment costs • Reduce the cost of publishing content The last point, ‘reduce the cost’, is perhaps the most important driver, and certainly the most saleable one if you’re attempting to justify an investment in an expensive content management solution. C A S E S T U D Y: MERANT has calculated the estimated savings of implementing its CMS tool, called PVCS Content Manager, at a typical 2,500-person company. Factoring in estimates for content creation (headcount), maintenance, deployment (publishing), and enhancement costs, MERANT estimates the annual savings at US$2.1 million. MERANT is quick to point out, however, that in addition to the traditional hard cost savings there are “numerous” soft benefits, which are more difficult to measure for ROI, but perhaps more valuable in the long run. (Source: MERANT, “Assessing ROI for Content Management Systems”, 2001) Content management ROI benefits include: • Print/paper savings • Mail/delivery savings • Publishing time savings • Employee productivity savings • Reduced IT reliance • Reduced meetings/sign-off/preparation • Reduced site development/maintenance There are scores of content management system (CMS) vendors from the Cadillac vendors such as Interwoven (Autonomy), Vignette, and Oracle, to more reasonably priced solutions from Red Dot and The Level. Prescient Digital Media worked with one CMS vendor, Anzer IT (formerly TiCORP) to analyze and estimate the potential ROI value of implementing its PowerCentral content management platform in a typical work environment. To understand the cost breakdown of publishing online, a typical scenario of publishing five static HTML pages is documented with cost estimates below.

Under the traditional publishing model, assuming an average Traditional HTML publishing often content/communications requires a technical programmer manager costs approximately to hard-code each HTML page by $45 per hour ($50,000 per scratch – often at a rate of one hour year, with $25,000 in support/ per HTML page. By empowering administrative costs), and content owners to publish and a technical manager costs manage their own content, many approximately $69 per hour organizations are removing or ($65,000 per year, with $32,500 retasking expensive technical in support/administrative support and programming from the costs), the average cost to process – saving tens-of-thousands publish five pages will cost of dollars per year, or possibly more. approximately $500 (required time multiplied by hourly costs).

As a result, the cost of publishing five pages drops from approximately $500 to approximately $19 – an impressive savings of 96%. If the same estimates hold true for the standard CMS (not necessarily the case), a $100,000 content management solution (costs vary depending on the solution) would realize a 100% ROI after approximately 1000 pages, or 20 weeks in an organization that publishes 10 pages per business day.

It goes without saying that there are many other factors that would affect the ROI (for example, rarely would it take 5 minutes to cut and paste copy into a simple template – seconds would suffice) – from training costs to support costs (either could increase or decrease). Nonetheless, the above example and accompanying tables provide a quick snapshot of the potential value an effective CMS can deliver if planned and implemented properly. C A S E S T U D Y: Before implementing its CMS, investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) had five methods of publishing content to distribution servers and three methods for intranet applications. Using a customized version of Interwoven’s OpenDeploy, CSFB reduced network utilization costs 88% in one year. CSFB uses the CMS to publish press releases, research reports, white papers and other materials to multiple servers on different platforms.

Organizational Diagnostics is a management-consulting firm in California specializing in research in high-tech Silicon Valley companies. Over the past decade, it has conducted research on the effect of employee satisfaction on employee retention. They conclude that for every 2% increase in employee satisfaction, there is a 1% increase in employee retention. Put another way, to the extent that you satisfy your staff with the resources and services they need, you can reduce employee replacement costs. (The ABCs of Return on Investment, PeopleSoft White Paper, June 2001) As well, as employees stay on longer, their productivity rises and training costs fall. The combination of a higher employee job satisfaction rating, along with improved knowledge and experience, leads to better customer service. C A S E S T U D Y: In January 2001, PeopleSoft began to deploy its own software, PeopleSoft 8 Human Resources Management, for HR, benefits administration, payroll, job postings and other self-service tools for 10,000 users in 26 countries. With self-service tools requiring no phone calls, fax or mail to complete tasks, employees are more productive and red-tape paper trails have virtually been eliminated. Projected over a 5-year period, PeopleSoft hopes to realize an ROI of 415%, or more than US$8 million, with the initial investment being recouped within 1.5 years.
