        "text": "Oracle WebLogic, WebCenter, BPM\n\nxCelerated offers solutions focusing on process and usability improvement solutions like Business Process Management (BPM), Portals, and Content Management - all enabled in a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).\n\nFrom analysis through implementation, we have a successful track record of delivery of enterprise portal and CMS projects for clients in a variety of industries. To ensure usability and adoption, our methodology focuses on user-centricity, starting with requirements analysis and Web design and continuing throughout the delivery process. xCelreated has partnered with and established effective working relationships with many customers in developing user-centric, collaborative, transaction-based solutions. We have significant experience delivering solutions utilizing portal products for many companies, working on everything from Intranet solutions to partner and supply Extranet portals as well as company dot-com sites and corporate dashboards.\n\nAs early as 2002 we were performing portal implementations using Plumtree's portal application as well as BEA WebLogic Portal. As these portal vendors have been acquired by Oracle over the years — Plumtree by BEA Systems, before BEA Systems itself was acquired by Oracle — we have continued to hone our skills by implementing solutions using the various iterations of each product, including Oracle's WebCenter Suite portal platform. Our longstanding commitment to these best-of-breed portal applications and platforms means that xCelerated is uniquely positioned to support any Oracle-centric portal implementations. Although Oracle represents our main technology area of focus for portals, we also have significant experience with open source portal frameworks and the following enterprise portal platforms: IBM WebSphere, Microsoft SharePoint, and Sun Java Enterprise System (JES) Portal.\n\nWebCenter Suite\n\nFollowing are a few of the areas that xCelerated serves for the Oracle WebCenter product:\n\nWebCenter Design and Architecture\n\nPortlet Development (JSR168, 170, and JPDK)\n\nPortal Strategy and Site Structure\n\nPortal Solution Implementation\n\nLDAP Integration\n\nInstallation, Configuration, and Maintenance\n\nCustom Application Integration\n\nComposer, Spaces, Wikis, Blogs, Forums, Tags, and the many unique WebCenter services\n\nBoth Oracle Application Server as well as WebLogic\n\nHaving years of SOA, Oracle Portal, Web/Enterprise 2.0, and Java/J2EE experience, xCelerated has been uniquely positioned to rapidly deliver solutions using Oracle's WebCenter Suite. xCelerated has developers in the US and offshore with experience building applications with Oracle WebCenter Suite.\n\nBPM Services\n\nOur team has a broad range of skills and experience providing BPM solutions for all sizes of organizations throughout the world. We offer consulting services that can help your organization deliver value added, process-oriented solutions and allow you to become more competitive in the marketplace.\n\nxCelerated provides solutions for full lifecycle BPM implementations including resources like Project Managers, Architects, Developers, and Process Analysts to ensure a smooth implementation and an effective solution.
