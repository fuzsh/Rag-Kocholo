        "text": "I remember walking out of the movie theater with my friends after watching director Roland Emmerich’s 1998 version of Godzilla wondering what in the hell we just watched. That was such a terrible film, and what’s hilarious is that Hollywood still hasn’t learned from its mistakes! They still continue to tell shitty Godzilla stories!\n\nGodzilla Minus One director Takashi Yamazaki, manages to find the good in the film, though. During a recent interview with MovieMaker, the filmmaker talked about the 1998 Godzilla movie, saying:\n\n“The 1998 Godzilla was fairly well put together and a fun film, but I can understand the people who also say this isn’t Godzilla. I think as a Kaiju-horror type of film, it is quite well executed. And to their credit, I think it was the first time Godzilla was rendered in a digital context and methodology, so that was a huge achievement for its time.”\n\nHe might be the first person I’ve heard say anything good about that movie! It’s definitely its own thing. The director went on to talk about what Legendary is doing with Godzilla, saying:\n\n“And with respect to Legendary’s Godzilla franchise, I think what those films have done is really explore the diversity and different takes you can see through the world and IP of Godzilla. The adaptability, if you will. If you look at more recent Toho or Japanese Godzilla films, Shin Godzilla and Godzilla Minus One, there’s a very serious, almost darker tone and theme being explored. But at the same time, the fact that Hollywood/ Legendary’s Godzilla can coexist and take a very different interpretation for Godzilla shows how developed and diverse the IP or franchise can be.”\n\nYes, but you can still have a fun and playful Godzilla movie with a strong script and story. Unfortunately, Legendary is lacking in the writing and storytelling side of things. The Godzilla movies they have been making could’ve been great! But they’ve lowered their storytelling standards to make them.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the 1998 Godzilla movie!?"
