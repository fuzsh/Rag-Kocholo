        "text": "Review by CJ\n\nDirector:\n\nRoland Emmerich\n\nStarring:\n\nMatthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Maria Pitillo, Hank Azaria\n\nOther notable appearances:\n\nHarry Shearer, Kevin Dunn, Nancy Cartwright, Michael Lerner\n\nTag line:\n\nSize does matter\n\nRunning time:\n\n139 minutes\n\nWatch this if you liked:\n\nIndependence Day, Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, Godzilla (2014)\n\nEveryone’s favourite giant radioactive lizard returns in his first reboot. Godzilla makes his way to Manhattan to start a family. It’s up to biologist Nick Tatopoulos (Broderick), French agent Philippe Roaché and the national guard to stop him.\n\nThis Godzilla gets a lot of criticism, and I can see why, but I really enjoyed it. It doesn’t stick to much of the source material. The acting is a bit iffy at times. The dialogue is unintentionally hilarious at points. All in all though, Godzilla is the perfect big budget Hollywood film for the b-grade monster movie fan and has been rated as such.\n\nThere are a lot of plot holes in Godzilla. For the most part though the minutiae of the plot isn’t really paramount. There is a giant lizard destroying Manhattan and people want to stop it from doing that. Anything else is incidental.\n\nGodzilla is a good representation of popular action films from the mid-to-late 90s. It has lots of big explosions, weapons with unlimited ammunition and an underlying love story. It’s a formula that worked well at the time and remains enjoyable today.\n\nThe special effects in Godzilla aren’t state-of-the-art, even for the time, but the creature is overall great looking. It brings to mind the creature creation in Jurassic Park. Though the eyes do bother me a smidge as the round pupils don’t feel reptilian.\n\nOverall, I found Godzilla to be a fun movie which, while very different from its predecessors and the second reboot, was very entertaining. Despite the general disdain that surrounds this film, I recommend it for fans of b-grade monster movies and action films that don’t require much thinking.\n\nRating:"
