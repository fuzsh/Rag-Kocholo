The \"Godzilla\" itself--and to even call it by that sacred name is a disgrace--is some of the worst special effects and creature design ever put to film. Just abysmal in every respect. This goes double for the whole last third of the movie which features dozens of baby godzillas, which I truly did not want to look at. However this movie does have two interesting virtues of note.\n\nFirst, a surprisingly funny cast that includes Jean Reno as a French secret agent, Hank Azaria continues his streak of being the go to ethnic stereotype guy, playing a \"dumb wop\" to quote directly from the movie, fellow Simpsons God Harry Shearer as a douchey anchorman, Michael Lerner as a fatter Michael Bloomberg, Kevin Dunn as a flummoxed army man, and Matthew Broderick as Matthew Broderick.\n\nSecond and more importantly, the film demonstrates the uncanny pre-9/11, pre-Covid resonance best captured by Adam Curtis in \"Hypernormalization.\" This strain of 90s summer blockbusters in which Manhattan had to be ritualistically destroyed over and over again in ways that seem a little stomach-turning in retrospect. This whole genre of movie--Armageddon, Independence Day, etc.--would seem to imply that our culture was courting exactly these kinds of disasters. That we subconsciously wanted and needed to see our gleaming towers of glass and steel implode and collapse. Behind every fear there is a wish and so forth. Ronald Emmerich's Godzilla is a part of this cultural wish-casting and ritual magic and is an interesting artifact despite being a horrible movie.\n\nI've long suspected that art is how human beings express messages that are sent into the past from our unconscious minds in the future and this movie is a good example of my long held belief along these lines."
