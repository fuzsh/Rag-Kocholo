        "text": "Attribute_Accuracy_Report:\n\nIndividual sample ID's, collection dates, sampling locations, band numbers, and reported sex of individual samples provided by collectors were cross-checked and verified to match the accompanying worksheet. Sampling locations were verified with collectors and formally labelled and cross-referenced to the Geographic Names Information Service (GNIS) or NGA GEOnet Names Server when possible. Species identification by collectors were informally verified by confirming genetic \"signatures\" (e.g. microsatellite size or DNA sequence) fell within expected values for the species. Field sex was not confirmed with a laboratory analysis. Genbank accession numbers were cross-referenced to the appropriate markers in attribute definitions. For quality control purposes, all genotypes were scored relative to known size standards run on each gel. These size standards were established by running them with an M13 DNA sequence ladder of known size. Additionally, ten percent of the samples were amplified and genotyped in duplicate for the 8 microsatellite loci to double-check genotype scores. Final genotype scores were reviewed by a second laboratory specialist.\n\nMethodology:\n\nMethodology_Type: Field\n\nMethodology_Description:\n\nSex of the sampled goose was determined in the field based on morphological characteristics or cloacal examination of the bird (Ely et al. 2005).\n\nMethodology_Citation:\n\nCitation_Information:\n\nOriginator: Ely, C.R.\n\nOriginator: Fox, A.D.\n\nOriginator: Alisaukas, R.T.\n\nOriginator: Andreev, A.\n\nOriginator: Bromley, R.G.\n\nOriginator: Degtyarev, A.G.\n\nOriginator: Ebbinge, B.\n\nOriginator: Gurtovaya, E.N.\n\nOriginator: Kerbes, R.\n\nOriginator: Kondratyev, A.V.\n\nOriginator: Kostin, I.\n\nOriginator: Krechmar, A.V.\n\nOriginator: Litvin, K.\n\nOriginator: Miyabayashi, Y.\n\nOriginator: Mooij, J.H.\n\nOriginator: Oates, R.M.\n\nOriginator: Orthmeyer, D.L.\n\nOriginator: Sabano, Y.\n\nOriginator: Simpson, S.G.\n\nOriginator: Solovieva, D.V.\n\nOriginator: Spindler, M.A.\n\nOriginator: Syroechkovsky, Y.V.\n\nOriginator: Takekawa, J.Y.\n\nOriginator: Walsh, A.\n\nTitle:\n\nCircumpolar variation in morphological characteristics of Greater White-fronted Geese (Anser albifrons)\n\nGeospatial_Data_Presentation_Form: journal article\n\nOther_Citation_Details:\n\nEly, C.R., A.D.

PCR amplifications were carried out in a 20-Î¼L volume with 2â100 ng genomic DNA, 0.5 Î¼M each primer, 1.0 Î¼M dNTPs, 10× PCR Perkin Elmer Cetus #1 buffer, and 0.2 units Taq polymerase. PCR reactions began with 94 ºC for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 50 °C for 30 sec, and 72 °C for 90 sec with a 30 min final extension at 72 °C. ExoSAP-IT® (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH) was used to remove excess primers and dNTPs in PCR products.
