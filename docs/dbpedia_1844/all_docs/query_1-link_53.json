        "text": "What Can I Do With This Tool!\n\nMerge GPS Files:\n\nThis tool will allow you to take GPX, TCX, or FIT files and combine them into one single file for upload to Strava. There are two ways that people commonly combine files. The first is if their GPS dies during a ride, and they start another activity (on their phone, for example). In this scenario, the user uploads both ride files, and then combines them into one, single GPS file. This is a concatenation of files. The other thing this tool can do is combine overlapping files. For example, a user has a Wahoo device that records heart rate, and TCX output from their indoor trainer. Both devices record at the same time, but the user wants to merge the heart rate data with the ride data. This tool can do that too! Just select the stream you want from each file.\n\nRepair Corrupted FIT Files:\n\nThis tool can read corrupted FIT files that some other tools cannot open. Once you have uploaded a corrupted FIT file, you have the option to repair the file manually. Usually the best choice is to click on the blue \"Edit Points\" button (you will see this on the next page after you upload). In that window, you can delete any offending points using the trash-can icon.\n\nAccepted File Types:\n\nThe tool accepts FIT, GPX, CSV and TCX files. It also accepts ZIP files containing any of these file types. Click for more information about supported file types.\n\nWhat if my files are too big?\n\nFIT Files can contain A LOT of data. If you are trying to merge all of your files from a one month long trip, please don't use 1-second recording; it is just too much for the tool (or Strava) to handle. If you do have such high-precision files, try uploading them to this tool one at a time and select the option to \"Use every xxx Trackpoint\" (this option is under the \"Do Not Discard Trackpoints\" dropdown). Also, export as GPX, which produces the fastest-reading file size. Once you have discarded trackpoints and exported as GPX, re-import all of these files en-mass to merge. If it was a 30 day trip, you don't need to record every single second. Discarding every 5th trackpoint will be FINE.\n\nWhat Can I Do With This Tool?\n\nConvert FIT to CSV:\n\nThis tool is the first step in my long-term plan. The idea is to allow the user to download a CSV file from a FIT file so they can modify the CSV file in a spreadsheet program such as Excel, Open Office or Google Sheets. After they modify their CSV file, they can upload it back to my tool and convert the CSV into a FIT file.\n\nThis tool is Beta:\n\nAt this time, this tool can only read the existing fields that Garmin puts into FIT files. The maximum number of fields in the FIT format is only 256, but there are still a lot of empty fields left. This tool ONLY puts \"Record Data\" into the CSV. \"Record Data\" contains all the \"stream\" information... in other words, measurements that are recorded along with timestamps. For example, your speed is \"Record Data,\" but your GPS Serial Number is not. That is because the Serial Number is a one-time item.\n\nFuture Plan:\n\nThe first step is for me to read ALL of the data in the FIT file. This means that you will get \"Record Data\" as well as \"Developer Data.\" Developer Data consists of special fields that can be added into a FIT file - for example using a ConnectIQ app. An Example of this is the Stryd Power meter for running. This device can record your running power - even though that isn't really a native Garmin field. In addition to the \"Developer Data\" I'd like to reveal much of the other data - such as the device ID, Serial Number, Session Information, Laps, etc. I'm still trying to figure out how to dump all that data into one CSV file in a readable format. The \"Record Data\" tabulates nicely in a spreadsheet because it is like a long list... but some of the other data is just key-value pairs... so I still need to determine the format for the CSV file. I'd like for the user to be able to make edits to esoteric CSV fields, and then re-upload it to my tool and export a corresponding FIT File.\n\nFurther in the Future:\n\nOnce I standardize my CSV files, I plan to build up the CSV uploader so you can start importing more data fields. Already, you can upload a CSV file to the Merge Tool and the Time Stamp Tool. Both of these tools will allow you to convert a CSV file to GPX, TCX, or FIT.. so you can upload them to Strava. However, while these tools insert popular fields like heart rate, power, speed, etc... they do not yet insert some of the more esoteric data fields like left/right power balance from power pedals. That is what I aim to improve in the upcoming months.\n\nAccepted File Types:\n\nThe tool accepts FIT files only. There is no size-reduction benefit to zipping a FIT file, so this tool ONLY accepts FIT files and nothing else. Click for more information about supported file types.\n\nWhy does this tool exist?\n\nStrava provides an automatic sync with Garmin Connect. The problem I was having is that activities would appear on Strava before I got a chance to name them. Furthermore, fragmented (accidental or test activities) would clutter up my feed. I'd have to go back and delete these items later. It was embarassing to get 50 kudos for measuring my heart rate variability and going zero miles. This tool still preserves the convenience of background bluetooth sync from Garmin Connect - but lets you control what appears on Strava.\n\nTo use the tool, connect your Garmin Account to your GOTOES account on the GOTOES login page. Once connected, this page will start receiving your Garmin Activities uploaded AFTER YOU MAKE THE CONNECTION. Garmin does not allow GOTOES to see activities you uploaded prior to connecting.\n\nIn the text field, you can supply a name for your activity. Click on one or more checkboxes to select which activity you want to transfer from Garmin Connect to Strava. If you select \"Edit or Merge Checked Files..\" then the Garmin activities will go to the GOTOES merge tool where you can combine them into a single activity.\n\nWhy do you want me to donate?\n\nI strongly believe in providing you with FREE tools to fix your Strava tracks. It provides me with great joy to be able to help people out.\n\nAs usage of this tool has grown exponentially, I started to notice that more and more people were getting \"Out of Memory\" errors due to the heavy usage. For a small website, processing over THREE MILLION files a year is a big ask (especially if you consider that some of the activities people are uploading have millions of data points in each file). I don't want anyone to get those error codes (500 Server error) caused by an overloaded server! I decided to make some of the heavy-hitting features available to a smaller group of users (i.e. Donors...) so that the tool has a lower risk of being overloaded. Every single Strava field (power, cadence, temperature, etc.) can be merged for FREE if you export as GPX. The donation-only features are mostly \"convenience\" features or features related to other tools such as Training Peaks or Garmin Connect.\n\nIf you really need help and cannot afford to donate, contact me and I can usually fix your GPS track for you. Also, if you just want to get rid of the nag screen you can do that for free too.\n\nAccepted File Types:\n\nGPX:\n\nThis used to be the old standard for GPS, but it only can include Latitude, Longitude, and Elevation. Strava has a special non-standard format that allows one to embed Heart Rate, Temperature, Power, and Cadence. If you export GPX from this tool, it will use the Strava non-standard format which may not be accepted by some programs\n\nTCX:\n\nThis is Garmin's early attempt at embedding additional data in a position (GPX) file. These files will include Latitude, Longitude, Elevation, Heart Rate, Power, and Cadence - but NOT Temperature.\n\nFIT:\n\nThese Files contain every bit of data you can imagine tracking. At this time, the tool ONLY reads in Latitude, Longitude, Elevation, Heart Rate, Calories, Power, Cadence and a few other supporting variables. Also, on the next page, you can choose to import \"Developer Data\", which are the Garmin ConnectIQ fields present in some files. The reason I don't import all of the data is that some people try to upload 20+ activities at a time, and if you import all of that data at once, the tool can crash.\n\nCSV:\n\nYou can import CSV files - but they need to be carefully formatted! The first row must contain the column headers. There must be one and only one \"Timestamp\" header. Your CSV can be comma or tab delimited. For more info on proper CSV format, click here (opens new window).\n\nZIP:\n\nAny of the above formats can be placed in a ZIP file to save yourself upload time. For more info on how to make your ZIP files, click here.\n\nDIRECT FROM STRAVA:\n\nThis early-access feature is currently only for my Donation Supporters. Please let me know if you encounter any issues with uploads directly from Strava. You can mix-and-match meaning that you could select one file from your Strava by checking a box - and merge it with a file uploaded from your desktop computer. Because this feature is new, I need to know if you encounter any issues! If, instead, you want to Merge GPS files from your Garmin Connect Account, Click Here.\n\nSAFARI ISSUES\n\nHow to work-around Safari 14.0.2 being broken. As of November, 2020, Apple has broke the \"Choose File\" button... for some people using Safari 14.0.1 browsers. I have rewritten the button code to try and work-around this bug, which I suspect they will fix soon. If you do decide to add more \"Choose File\" buttons by clicking the link for iOS buttons, please make sure that you at least select a file with the first (top) button. If no file is selected with that button, you will get an error\n\nTime Zone\n\nSetting the time zone is important for visualizing your files in my tool. Setting it correctly will make the time bars on the 2nd (upload) page have the correct start and stop times. If your file has GPS coordinates (longitude and latitude), then you can simply select \"Let Tool Guess My Time Zone\" (that option is at the top of this drop down). The tool will remember your previous time zone in a cookie so the next time you use the tool, it will automatically select the correct time zone for you. That works great - unless you do activities that start in different time zones. In that case, you will have to re-select the time zone, or tell the tool to select the time zone for you.\n\nIndoor Workouts / Trainer / Turbo Rides / Pool Swims\n\nThese types of activities do not contain GPS information, so you MUST select the correct time zone - the tool cannot figure it out for you. When you upload an indoor workout to Strava, Strava will use the location set in your profile to determine the time zone. The GPS files all use a time called UTC - which is the time at the Prime Meridian (remember that from gradeschool?). If your indoor workout time is wrong, make sure you have selected the correct time zone here\n\n*WARNING*\n\nYou should not check this box unless you really need it. This option slows the tool and may result in your file merge crashing if you have a lot of data/files. It is fine if you are doing a smaller merge.\n\nRarely Used Fields\n\nThere are some rarely used fields in SOME FIT files. For the most part, you do NOT need these fields. None of these fields are displayed in Strava - and they are only pertinent on websites such as Garmin Connect or Training Peaks. Moreover, they only contain data if you have additional sensors connected such as power meter pedals (that can record left/right balance) or running devices that measure vertical oscillation. If you check this box, you're going to slow down the processing of your data. If your FIT files are big, you may even crash your session.\n\nWhich Fields will be included?\n\nHere is a FAQ on the FIT fields that GOTOES can export (opens new window)\n\nExample of some of the fields that will be added (as seen in in Garmin Connect)\n\nInserting Extra Fields in CSV Files\n\nWhat are Extra Fields?\n\nGarmin has many types of fields that can be stored in a FIT file. First, you need to know that there is more than one type of FIT file. You can have a FIT file that stores Device Settings... or Workouts... or Schedules... or Blood Pressure... or Weight... or an Activity. Each of these FIT files have different types of data, but this tool is only concerned with Activity Files. An activity FIT file contains all sorts of data about what was recorded while you were riding/running/swimming/etc. Some of that information is probably not very interesting to you... information like device_settings or field_capabilities. Other information, such as sport (they type of sport you did), or the file_id (tells which GPS model you used) can be more useful.\n\nGOTOES CSV Format\n\nI've developed a simple CSV format for FIT Files exported from GOTOES|Strava Tools. The idea is that in the future, you will be able to make edits to various fields in your favorite spreadsheet program, re-upload the CSV to my tools - and export a FIT file that is ready for Strava or Garmin Connect.\n\nAll GOTOES CSV exports include the \"Record\" fields. Those are the streams of data that are recorded on a second-by-second basis. That is usually what people are most interested in. If you scroll to the right in the CSV output, you will see that I have column headers for all of the currently available Garmin \"Record\" fields. The maximum possible number of fields is 255, but as you can see, Garmin has only used some of them so far. You will also notice that there are some blank spaces in the headers. That is because I've had the column number match up with the Garmin-Assinged ID for each field.\n\nTime Shift.\n\nIf you check the Time Shift box and your GPX file has time stamps in it, the tool will set the very first point in your ride to the time stamp you supply in \"Activity Start Time.\" It will then calculate the difference in time between the time you supplied and the time provided in the track. It will apply that time-shift to every point in the track. This way, the exact speed you traveled is maintained; the only difference is the time that you did it. If you select this option, \"Desired Average Speed\" and \"Use Elevation in Calculating Speed\" will be ignored (and grayed out). The time zone you supply is important - if you supply the wrong time zone, your track may be time-shifted by more (or less) than you expect.\n\nTime Shift Multiple Files\n\nAs of October 2022, I have changed how the tool works when trying to modify multiple files. I discuss this in detail here. (opens new tab)\n\nDesired Average Speed.\n\nThis works by the tool taking each and every point and analyzing the distance between them. If you do not select to use the elevation when calculating speed, the tool just takes a simple distance over time calcuation to produce a speed. If you select the bike or run option, the tool uses a complicated formula that includes smoothing between points to try and produce an accurate speed between each individual point. The accuracy of this output relies heavily on your track. If your track has points that are very far apart, you're going to want to use the Interpolate / Add Trackpoints option (you will see this option on the next page). If your points are too close together, you could have some speed spikes that are impossibly fast, so you will want to reduce the number of trackpoints to increase the accuracy. If you leave this field blank, the tool will just assume 20 miles per hour.\n\nRead this link for a discussion for uploading BIG files to the tool.\n\nOther options:\n\nTo save yourself upload time - and to bypass the size limits, you can ZIP compress your files before uploading. **IF THIS DOESN'T WORK, PLEASE CONTACT ME AND I WILL HELP YOU - EVEN WITH EXTRA BIG FILES.\n\nOn a Mac:\n\nHighlight all of the files that you want to upload (to highlight multiple files, use the shift key while selecting, or use the command key and click on individual files). Once the files are selected, click with your right mouse button and select the option that says \"compress.\" A new file that looks like it has a zipper on it will appear in the same location, and you can upload that to my tool. This file can contain FIT, TCX, or GPX files.\n\nOn a PC:\n\nRight-click the file you want to zip, and then select Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder\n\n**Important:\n\nDo not put the items in a folder, and then compress the folder. If you do that, my tool will not be able to see your files.\n\nConnect With Strava\n\nStarting May 2, 2024, I began introducing a new and more secure method to send your activities from GOTOES to Strava. Previously, GOTOES would store your Strava tokens in your cookies which meant that someone with access to your device could potentially upload an activity to Strava on your behalf. Admittedly, this is unlikely, but it's 2024 and we need to focus on Security and Privacy. From here on out, if you want to send to Strava from GOTOES, you will need to create a GOTOES account and then link your Strava from within the account.\n\nAdded Benefits\n\nThere are many additional benefits to GOTOES accounts. I plan to store your Donor Status, Garmin Tokens and User Preferences in the account as well. Once that is complete, you should be able to log into any browser and have GOTOES be ready to use! No more clicking donor links and having to re-connect to Strava and Garmin when you change browsers!"
