        "text": "Time Zones and Units\n\nAll of the data collected by CDIP is archived by the UTC time. While some of our web products are available for other time zones, many of CDIP’s files and products are tagged only with the UTC time.\n\nWhat is Universal Time Coordinated (UTC)?\n\nUTC is the time at 0 degrees longitude, a.k.a. GMT (Greenwich Mean Time).\n\nUTC = US Eastern Standard Time (EST) + 5 hours or UTC = US Pacific Standard Time (PST) + 8 hours\n\nFor US Daylight Savings Time the difference is 1 hour less, e.g.,\n\nUTC = EDT + 4 hours UTC = PDT + 7 hours\n\nFor the state of Hawaii\n\nUTC = Hawaiian Standard Time + 10 hours\n\nWorld UTC Table\n\nUTC time difference for various locations through out the world.\n\nLocal Time\n\nGeographic Zone\n\nUTC-12\n\nEniwetok\n\nUTC-11\n\nSamoa\n\nUTC-10\n\nHawaii\n\nUTC-9\n\nAlaska\n\nUTC-8\n\nPST, Pacific US\n\nUTC-7\n\nMST, PDT\n\nUTC-6\n\nCST, MDT\n\nUTC-5\n\nEST, CDT\n\nUTC-4\n\nAtlantic, Canada\n\nUTC-3\n\nBrazil, Buenos Aries\n\nUTC-2\n\nMid-Atlantic\n\nUTC-1\n\nCape Verdes\n\nUTC\n\nGreenwich Mean Time, Dublin\n\nUTC+1\n\nBerlin, Rome\n\nUTC+2\n\nIsrael, Cairo\n\nUTC+3\n\nMoscow, Kuwait\n\nUTC+4\n\nAbu Dhabi, Muscat\n\nUTC+5\n\nIslamabad, Karachi\n\nUTC+6\n\nAlmaty, Dhaka\n\nUTC+7\n\nBangkok, Jakarta\n\nUTC+8\n\nHong Kong, Beijing\n\nUTC+9\n\nTokyo, Osaka\n\nUTC+10\n\nSydney, Melbourne, Guam\n\nUTC+11\n\nMagadan, Soloman Is.\n\nUTC+12\n\nFiji, Wellington, Auckland\n\nPST,PDT\n\nPacific Standard/Daylight Time\n\nMST,MDT\n\nMountain Standard/Daylight Time\n\nCST,CDT\n\nCentral Standard/Daylight Time\n\nEST,EDT\n\nEastern Standard/Daylight Time\n\nUnit Conversions\n\nCDIP archives its data in metric units. In the website’s Recent-Observed section - which displays the latest data from currently active stations - a number of products can be viewed using either English or metric units. On the nowcast swell models and forecast models English units are used, with wave heights measured in feet. Everywhere else on the site, metric units are used. Below is some conversion information that may help in interpreting data.\n\nLength conversions\n\nThe primary unit of length used by CDIP is meters(m). To convert from\n\nmeters to feet, the formula is as follows: (feet) = 3.28 * (meters)\n\nMeters to Feet Conversion Table\n\nm\n\nft\n\n1\n\n3.3\n\n2\n\n6.6\n\n3\n\n9.8\n\n4\n\n13.1\n\n5\n\n16.4\n\n6\n\n19.7\n\n7\n\n23.0\n\n8\n\n26.2\n\n9\n\n29.5\n\n10\n\n32.8\n\n11\n\n36.1\n\n12\n\n39.4\n\nWhen describing station locations and on maps, distances may given in miles(mi), nautical miles(nm), or kilometers(km). The conversions between these units are as follows: 1 mi = 1.61 km = 0.87 nm\n\nTemperature conversions\n\nThe temperature unit used by CDIP is degrees Celsius(C). To convert from Celsius to Farenheit(F), the formula is as follows: (F) = (9/5)*(C) + 32\n\nCelcius to Farenheit Conversion Table\n\nC\n\nF\n\n0\n\n32\n\n5\n\n41\n\n10\n\n50\n\n15\n\n59\n\n20\n\n68\n\n25\n\n77\n\n30\n\n86\n\n35\n\n95\n\n40\n\n104\n\n45\n\n113\n\n50\n\n122\n\n55\n\n131\n\nOther conversions\n\nWind speed is archived in meters per second (m/s). 1 m/s = 1.94 knots = 2.24 miles per hour\n\nPressure is archived in millibars (mB). 1 mB = 0.0295 inches of Hg"
