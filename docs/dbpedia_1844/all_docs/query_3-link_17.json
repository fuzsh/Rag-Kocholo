Y.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThe occurrence probability of the Io-controlled Jovian decameter radio emissions depends on the central meridian longitude and the orbital phase of the satellite Io. Investigations by Galopeau et al. (2004, 2007) have shown that some specific Jovian \"active\" longitudes favor the radiation. The authors proposed a model which involves the cyclotron maser instability (CMI) as the mechanism at the origin of the Jovian radio emissions produced near the local gyrofrequency, along an active magnetic field line carried away by Io through its revolution around Jupiter. Those studies brought out the existence of an active longitude anchored in Jupiter's magnetic field and directly related to the efficiency of the CMI. In the present analysis, we model the four occurrence regions associated to Io-controlled sources. This approach is in a reverse way of the parametric method developed by Galopeau et al. (2007). The properties of the propagation and polarization of the radio wave, derived from the CMI, are the key ingredients for the study of the beaming cone. It is shown that the lead angle of the active magnetic field line relative to Io has a significant effect on both the selection of the propagation conditions and the limit between the right- and left-hand polarization states. The modeled and observed occurrence regions are found to be similar for a lead angle of about 20Â°. However, it seems that the behaviors of the southern and northern sources are not alike despite a common generation mechanism.\n\nLongitude through time\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTorsvik, T. H.; Steinberger, B.; Cocks, R. L.\n\n2007-12-01\n\nEarth scientists today have had no objective method of calculating what the palaeolongitudes of tectonic plates and other geological units were in the long eons prior to the oldest known hotspot trails, which are only of Cretaceous age (ca. 130 Ma). Before this time, palaeomagnetism is the only method by which to position plates quantitatively on the globe. Palaeomagnetic studies only directly yield latitudes and plate rotations, but the longitude uncertainty can be minimized by selecting an appropriate reference plate: if one can determine which plate has moved least, then it should be used as the reference plate. Africa has been nearly surrounded by mid- ocean ridges since the break-up of Pangea, and thus the ridge push forces should have roughly cancelled each other out. Moving hotspot-based plate motion models show minimal longitudinal motion for Africa (<10 degrees) for the past 130 million years, confirming the lack of significant longitudinal motion inferred from consideration of the plate driving forces. It is uncertain whether the 'zero-longitude' assumption about Africa holds before Pangea's break-up, but in the absence of better reference points, we have regarded zero longitudinal average motion for Africa as the best assumption. With this approach we have been able to demonstrate that virtually all Large Igneous Province (LIPs) for the last 300 million years project radially onto the edges of the African and Pacific Large Low Shear Velocity Province (LLSVPs) near the core-mantle-boundary (CMB). The LIPs must for this reason be derived from mantle plumes, and CMB heterogeneities must have remained quite stationary since the formation of Pangea. LIPs have erupted since Archean times and there is no reason to preclude that they were all derived from LLSVPs in the deep mantle. That inspired us to consider whether older LIP events would yield similar results. We attempt to reconstruct Gondwana in longitude in Cambrian times based on the substantial Antrim\n\nInfluenza and Pneumonia Mortality in 66 Large Cities in the United States in Years Surrounding the 1918 Pandemic\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAcuna-Soto, Rodolfo; Viboud, CÃ©cile; Chowell, Gerardo\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe 1918 influenza pandemic was a major epidemiological event of the twentieth century resulting in at least twenty million deaths worldwide; however, despite its historical, epidemiological, and biological relevance, it remains poorly understood. Here we examine the relationship between annual pneumonia and influenza death rates in the pre-pandemic (1910â17) and pandemic (1918â20) periods and the scaling of mortality with latitude, longitude and population size, using data from 66 large cities of the United States. The mean pre-pandemic pneumonia death rates were highly associated with pneumonia death rates during the pandemic period (Spearman Ïâ=â0.64â0.72; P<0.001). By contrast, there was a weak correlation between pre-pandemic and pandemic influenza mortality rates. Pneumonia mortality rates partially explained influenza mortality rates in 1918 (Ïâ=â0.34, Pâ=â0.005) but not during any other year. Pneumonia death counts followed a linear relationship with population size in all study years, suggesting that pneumonia death rates were homogeneous across the range of population sizes studied. By contrast, influenza death counts followed a power law relationship with a scaling exponent of â¼0.81 (95%CI: 0.71, 0.91) in 1918, suggesting that smaller cities experienced worst outcomes during the pandemic. A linear relationship was observed for all other years. Our study suggests that mortality associated with the 1918â20 influenza pandemic was in part predetermined by pre-pandemic pneumonia death rates in 66 large US cities, perhaps through the impact of the physical and social structure of each city. Smaller cities suffered a disproportionately high per capita influenza mortality burden than larger ones in 1918, while city size did not affect pneumonia mortality rates in the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. PMID:21886792\n\nA computer program for converting rectangular coordinates to latitude-longitude coordinates\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nRutledge, A.T.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nA computer program was developed for converting the coordinates of any rectangular grid on a map to coordinates on a grid that is parallel to lines of equal latitude and longitude. Using this program in conjunction with groundwater flow models, the user can extract data and results from models with varying grid orientations and place these data into grid structure that is oriented parallel to lines of equal latitude and longitude. All cells in the rectangular grid must have equal dimensions, and all cells in the latitude-longitude grid measure one minute by one minute. This program is applicable if the map used shows lines of equal latitude as arcs and lines of equal longitude as straight lines and assumes that the Earth 's surface can be approximated as a sphere. The program user enters the row number , column number, and latitude and longitude of the midpoint of the cell for three test cells on the rectangular grid. The latitude and longitude of boundaries of the rectangular grid also are entered. By solving sets of simultaneous linear equations, the program calculates coefficients that are used for making the conversion. As an option in the program, the user may build a groundwater model file based on a grid that is parallel to lines of equal latitude and longitude. The program reads a data file based on the rectangular coordinates and automatically forms the new data file.

The measurements show that the planet exhibits librations in longitude that are forced at the 88-day orbital period, as predicted by theory. The large amplitude of the oscillations, 35.8 +/- 2 arc seconds, together with the Mariner 10 determination of the gravitational harmonic coefficient C22, indicates that the mantle of Mercury is decoupled from a core that is at least partially molten.\n\n\"Michael Jackson World Tour:\" Maps and Globes--Latitude and Longitude.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBenscoter, Gloria Dee\n\n1988-01-01\n\nPresents a mapping activity which helps students understand the purpose of latitude and longitude lines.

E.\n\n2005-12-01\n\nI present a brief history of the ``Lunar Distance\" technique for determining Longitude at sea, as developed by Astronomer Royal Neville Maskelyne (1732-1811) and others. I illustrate this history using images and results from a recent (2001) BBC History project to re-enact part of Captain James Cook's first voyage, from near-shipwreck on the east coast Australia, back to the relative safety of Batavia (modern-day Djakarta). I demonstrate the practical use of Lunars to determine longitude at sea, illustrated through comparison to GPS coordinates obtained along the voyage. During windows of lunar visibility, using new tables drawn up at HMNAO, we were able to match or exceed Maskelyne's stated accuracy of 30 nautical miles (0.5 degrees). Close to New Moon, dependent on our own skills of dead-reckoning, we prove far less able navigators than Cook and his cohort! I acknowledge the enormous assistance of Catherine Hohenkerk of the HMNAO, Tanya Batchelor of the BBC, George Huxtable, John Jeffrey, and John Selwyn-Gilbert in researching this subject. I gratefully acknowledge funding from the BBC, and HM Bark Endeavour Foundation for the use of their glorious ship, the Endeavour.\n\nClean Cities Technical Assistance | State, Local, and Tribal Governments |\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nNREL Toggle navigation Menu Technical Assistance Technical Assistance States Tribes Clean Â» State, Local, and Tribal Governments ÃÂ» Clean Cities Technical Assistance Clean Cities Technical reduce petroleum use in transportation by providing technical assistance, educational and outreach\n\nLatitude and longitude vertical disparity\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRead, Jenny C. A.; Phillipson, Graeme P.; Glennerster, Andrew\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe literature on vertical disparity is complicated by the fact that several different definitions of the term âvertical disparityâ are in common use, often without a clear statement about which is intended or a widespread appreciation of the properties of the different definitions. Here, we examine two definitions of retinal vertical disparity: elevation-latitude and elevation-longitude disparity. Near the fixation point, these definitions become equivalent, but in general, they have quite different dependences on object distance and binocular eye posture, which have not previously been spelt out. We present analytical approximations for each type of vertical disparity, valid for more general conditions than previous derivations in the literature: we do not restrict ourselves to objects near the fixation point or near the plane of regard, and we allow for non-zero torsion, cyclovergence and vertical misalignments of the eyes. We use these expressions to derive estimates of the latitude and longitude vertical disparity expected at each point in the visual field, averaged over all natural viewing. Finally, we present analytical expressions showing how binocular eye position â gaze direction, convergence, torsion, cyclovergence, and vertical misalignment â can be derived from the vertical disparity field and its derivatives at the fovea.

Funded by DOE, the six-station network provided 5-minute averaged measurements of direct normal, global, and diffuse horizontal solar irradiance. The data were processed at NREL to improve the assessment of the solar radiation resources in the southeastern United States. Historical HBCU data available online include quality assessed 5-min data, monthly reports, and plots. In January 1997 the HBCU sites became part of the CONFRRM solar monitoring network and data from the two remaining active stations, Bluefield State College and Elizabeth City State University, are collected by the NREL Measurement & Instrumentation Data Center (MIDC).\n\nThe Martian Prime Meridian -- Longitude \"Zero\"\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2001-02-08\n\nOn Earth, the longitude of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England is defined as the \"prime meridian,\" or the zero point of longitude. Locations on Earth are measured in degrees east or west from this position. The prime meridian was defined by international agreement in 1884 as the position of the large \"transit circle,\" a telescope in the Observatory's Meridian Building. The transit circle was built by Sir George Biddell Airy, the 7th Astronomer Royal, in 1850. (While visual observations with transits were the basis of navigation until the space age, it is interesting to note that the current definition of the prime meridian is in reference to orbiting satellites and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) measurements of distant radio sources such as quasars. This \"International Reference Meridian\" is now about 100 meters east of the Airy Transit at Greenwich.) For Mars, the prime meridian was first defined by the German astronomers W. Beer and J. H. MÃ¤dler in 1830-32. They used a small circular feature, which they designated \"a,\" as a reference point to determine the rotation period of the planet. The Italian astronomer G. V. Schiaparelli, in his 1877 map of Mars, used this feature as the zero point of longitude. It was subsequently named Sinus Meridiani (\"Middle Bay\") by Camille Flammarion. When Mariner 9 mapped the planet at about 1 kilometer (0.62 mile) resolution in 1972, an extensive \"control net\" of locations was computed by Merton Davies of the RAND Corporation. Davies designated a 0.5-kilometer-wide crater (0.3 miles wide), subsequently named \"Airy-0\" (within the large crater Airy in Sinus Meridiani) as the longitude zero point. (Airy, of course, was named to commemorate the builder of the Greenwich transit.) This crater was imaged once by Mariner 9 (the 3rd picture taken on its 533rd orbit, 533B03) and once by the Viking 1 orbiter in 1978 (the 46th image on that spacecraft's 746th orbit, 746A46), and these two images were the basis of the martian\n\nAn Extraordinary Partnership between Arizona State University and the City of Phoenix\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFriedman, Debra\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe Arizona State University Downtown Phoenix campus is a grand-scale exemplar of a city-university partnership.

For this study an extensive database on â450 solar proton events have been constructed using various available sources and solar cosmic ray measurements, which included the data about the time of the event, fluences of protons of various energies in it and the coordinates of its source on the Sun. The analysis has shown the significant inhomogeneity of the distribution. In particular a region of âpassive longitudesâ has been discovered, extensive over the longitude (from â90-100Â° to 170Â°) and the life time (the whole period of observations). From the 60 most powerful proton events during the 19-24 solar cycles not more than 1 event was originated from the interval of 100-170Â° Carrington longitude, from another 80 âmediumâ events only 10 were injected from this interval. The summarized proton fluence of the events, which sources belong to the interval of 90-170Â° amounts only to 5%, and if not take into account the single âanomalousâ powerful event - to just only 1.2% from the total fluence for all the considered events. The existence of the extensive and stable interval of âpassiveâ Carrington longitudes is the remarkable phenomenon in solar physics. It also confirms the physical relevance of the mean synodic period of Sunâs rotation determined by R. C. Carrington.\n\nHot Topics: Cities, Energy Use, and Local Energy Decision Making | State,\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nMaking Hot Topics: Cities, Energy Use, and Local Energy Decision Making August 08, 2015 by Alexandra United States, read Alexandra's paper titled City-Level Energy Decision Making: Data Use in Energy Local, and Tribal Governments | NREL Hot Topics: Cities, Energy Use, and Local Energy Decision\n\nYouth Voting: State and City Approaches to Early Civic Engagement.

The data were taken in May and June, 2014, with the 4.2-m Isaac Newton Telescope at Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory in the Canary Islands, using the ACAM (auxiliary-port camera) in spectrometer mode, and using two solar analog stars. The new spectra clearly show absorption bands of solid CH4 at 620, 728, and 850-910 nm, which were known from earlier work. The 620-nm CH4 band is intrinsically very weak, and its appearance indicates a long optical pathlength through the ice. This is especially true if it arises from CH4 dissolved in N2 ice. Earlier work (Owen et al. Science 261, 745, 1993) on the near-infrared spectrum of Pluto (1-2.5 Âµm) has shown that the CH4 bands are shifted to shorter wavelengths because the CH4 occurs as a solute in beta-phase crystalline N2. The optical pathlength through the N2 crystals must be on the order of several cm to produce the N2 band observed at 2.15 Âµm. The new spectra exhibit a pronounced red slope across the entire wavelength range; the slope is variable with longitude, and differs in a small but significant way from that measured at comparable longitudes by Grundy & Fink (Icarus 124, 329, 1996) in their 15-year study of Plutoâs spectrum (500-1000 nm). The new spectra will provide an independent means for calibrating the color filter bands on the Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC) (Reuter et al. Space Sci. Rev. 140, 129, 2008) on the New Horizons spacecraft, which will encounter the Pluto-Charon system in mid-2015. They will also form the basis of modeling the spectrum of Pluto at different longitudes to help establish the nature of the non-ice component(s) of Plutoâs surface. It is presumed that the non-ice component is the source of the yellow-red coloration of Pluto, which is known to be variable across the surface.\n\nSpectroscopy of Pluto, 380-930 Nm at Six Longitudes\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCruikshank, D.

Salt Lake City lies between the shores of the Great Salt Lake (the dark area on the left side of the image) and the Wasatch Front Range (the mountains in the upper half of the image). The Salt Lake City area is of great interest to urban planners because of the combination of lake, valley and alpine environments that coexist in the region. Much of the southern shore of the Great Salt Lake is a waterfowl management area. The green grid pattern in the right center of the image is Salt Lake City and its surrounding communities. The Salt Lake City airport is visible as the brown rectangle near the center of the image. Interstate Highway 15 runs from the middle right edge to the upper left of the image. The bright white patch east of Interstate 15 is the downtown area, including Temple Square and the state capitol. The University of Utah campus is the yellowish area that lies at the base of the mountains, east of Temple Square. The large reservoir in the lower left center is a mine tailings pond.

A.; Wimmer-Schweingruber, R. F.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nContext. The interstellar flow longitude corresponds to the Sun's direction of movement relative to the local interstellar medium. Thus, it constitutes a fundamental parameter for our understanding of the heliosphere and, in particular, its interaction with its surroundings, which is currently investigated by the Interstellar Boundary EXplorer (IBEX). One possibility to derive this parameter is based on pickup ions (PUIs) that are former neutral ions that have been ionized in the inner heliosphere. The neutrals enter the heliosphere as an interstellar wind from the direction of the Sun's movement against the partially ionized interstellar medium. PUIs carry information about the spatial variation of their neutral parent population (density and flow vector field) in their velocity distribution function. From the symmetry of the longitudinal flow velocity distribution, the interstellar flow longitude can be derived. Aim. The aim of this paper is to identify and eliminate systematic errors that are connected to this approach of measuring the interstellar flow longitude; we want to minimize any systematic influences on the result of this analysis and give a reasonable estimate for the uncertainty. Methods: We use He+ data measured by the PLAsma and SupraThermal Ion Composition (PLASTIC) sensor on the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory Ahead (STEREO A) spacecraft. We analyze a recent approach, identify sources of systematic errors, and propose solutions to eliminate them. Furthermore, a method is introduced to estimate the error associated with this approach. Additionally, we investigate how the selection of interplanetary magnetic field angles, which is closely connected to the pickup ion velocity distribution function, affects the result for the interstellar flow longitude. Results: We find that the revised analysis used to address part of the expected systematic effects obtains significantly different results than presented in the previous study.

Todd; Scherrer, Phil H.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nIn order to investigate how solar activity is organized in longitude, major solar flares, large sunspot groups, and large scale photospheric magnetic field strengths were analyzed. The results of these analyses are reported. The following results are discussed: hot spots, initially recognized as areas of high concentration of major flares, are the preferred locations for the emergence of big sunspot groups; double hot spots appear in pairs that rotate at the same rate separated by about 180 deg in longitude, whereas, single hot spots have no such companions; the northern and southern hemispheres behave differently in organizing solar activity in longitude; the lifetime of hot spots range from one to several solar cycles; a hot spot is not always active throughout its lifetime, but goes through dormant periods; and hot spots with different rotational periods coexist in the same hemisphere during the same solar cycle.\n\nCities with camera-equipped taxicabs experience reduced taxicab driver homicide rates: United States, 1996-2010.\n\nPubMed\n\nMenÃ©ndez, Cammie Chaumont; Amandus, Harlan; Damadi, Parisa; Wu, Nan; Konda, Srinivas; Hendricks, Scott\n\n2014-05-01\n\nDriving a taxicab remains one of the most dangerous occupations in the United States, with leading homicide rates. Although safety equipment designed to reduce robberies exists, it is not clear what effect it has on reducing taxicab driver homicides. Taxicab driver homicide crime reports for 1996 through 2010 were collected from 20 of the largest cities (>200,000) in the United States: 7 cities with cameras installed in cabs, 6 cities with partitions installed, and 7 cities with neither cameras nor partitions. Poisson regression modeling using generalized estimating equations provided city taxicab driver homicide rates while accounting for serial correlation and clustering of data within cities. Two separate models were constructed to compare (1) cities with cameras installed in taxicabs versus cities with neither cameras nor partitions and (2) cities with partitions installed in taxicabs versus cities with neither cameras nor partitions. Cities with cameras installed in cabs experienced a significant reduction in homicides after cameras were installed (adjRR = 0.11, CL 0.06-0.24) and compared to cities with neither cameras nor partitions (adjRR = 0.32, CL 0.15-0.67). Cities with partitions installed in taxicabs experienced a reduction in homicides (adjRR = 0.78, CL 0.41-1.47) compared to cities with neither cameras nor partitions, but it was not statistically significant. The findings suggest cameras installed in taxicabs are highly effective in reducing homicides among taxicab drivers. Although not statistically significant, the findings suggest partitions installed in taxicabs may be effective.\n\nVenus - Computer Simulated Global View Centered at 0 Degrees East Longitude\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n1996-03-14\n\nThis global view of the surface of Venus is centered at 0 degrees east longitude.

The active longitudes are not fixed in the Carrington system, they have a well recognizable migration path between the descending phase of cycle 21 (from about 1984) and ascending phase of cycle 23 (until about 1996), out of this interval the migration path is ambiguous. The longitudinal distribution on both sides of the path has been computed and averaged for the length of the path. The so-called flip-flop phenomenon, when the activity temporarily gets to the opposite longitude, can also be recognized. The widths of the active domains are fairly narrow in the increasing and decaying phases of cycle 22, their half widths are about 20Â°-30Â° for both the main and secondary active belts but it is more flat and stretched around the maximum with a half width of about 60Â°.\n\nRole of the state in solving the environmental problems of the industrial monoprofile cities\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMusina, L. M.; Neucheva, M. U.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nNowadays the problem of sustainable socio-economic development of monotowns refers to one of the priority issues of the state policy. The author analyzes monotowns state policy support in Russia with main focus on programs aimed at ecological restoration of industrial monoprofile cities. The processes of program control in monotowns within the state economic policy are analyzed. In order to evaluate the results of programs (of city-forming enterprises and monotowns level) the principles of development of criteria development system have been substantiated. The environmental situation of monotowns depends on a complex system of interaction between the city (represented by its people and municipal authorities), private capital and the state. Long-term sustainable development of monotowns requires the interests of all three parties to be in balance. This is possible to achieve by increasing the social responsibility of businesses, increasing the development of local government and urban identity and active influence of local communities on the activities of the municipal authorities.\n\nUS National Large-scale City Orthoimage Standard Initiative\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nZhou, G.; Song, C.; Benjamin, S.; Schickler, W.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nThe early procedures and algorithms for National digital orthophoto generation in National Digital Orthophoto Program (NDOP) were based on earlier USGS mapping operations, such as field control, aerotriangulation (derived in the early 1920's), the quarter-quadrangle-centered (3.75 minutes of longitude and latitude in geographic extent), 1:40,000 aerial photographs, and 2.5 D digital elevation models. However, large-scale city orthophotos using early procedures have disclosed many shortcomings, e.g., ghost image, occlusion, shadow. Thus, to provide the technical base (algorithms, procedure) and experience needed for city large-scale digital orthophoto creation is essential for the near future national large-scale digital orthophoto deployment and the revision of the Standards for National Large-scale City Digital Orthophoto in National Digital Orthophoto Program (NDOP). This paper will report our initial research results as follows: (1) High-precision 3D city DSM generation through LIDAR data processing, (2) Spatial objects/features extraction through surface material information and high-accuracy 3D DSM data, (3) 3D city model development, (4) Algorithm development for generation of DTM-based orthophoto, and DBM-based orthophoto, (5) True orthophoto generation by merging DBM-based orthophoto and DTM-based orthophoto, and (6) Automatic mosaic by optimizing and combining imagery from many perspectives.\n\n76 FR 31991 - All Items Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers; United States City Average\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-06-02\n\n...

This is more prevalent in the developing countries. The concomitants of this are high density, heavy traffic movement and increased pollution levels. To reduce the stressful life of city dwellers it is important to have open spaces, where one can pursue leisure time activities a few removes from clutter. A public space is a space that is generally open and accessible to people. Roads, public parks, libraries etc, are typically considered public space. The term âpublic spaceâ is also often misconstrued to mean other things such as âgathering placeâ, which is an element of the larger concept of social space. Hyderabad, the historical city is the capital of Telangana, India and extends from longitude 78o23â to 78o33âE and latitude of 17o17â to 17o31âN. It is the second largest city in terms of area and fifth largest in terms of population. It is one of the fastest growing cities in India. There is a huge influx of people from other states in search of better opportunities. The main objectives of the study are; to study the sprawl and changing demographic structure of the city of Hyderabad, to study the accessibility of parks, to study the need for the emergence of a local public sphere. The data base will be mainly on secondary data collected from various government sources. A primary survey will be conducted based on a structured questionnaire. GIS and other mapping techniques will be applied to analyse the data.\n\nState arterial highway system peer city study : Task Assignment #C-04-03 : final report.\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n2006-08-01\n\nAddressing state highways within urban areas is a challenge for New York State, New York City and Buffalo.

The GEO arena is home to hundreds of communications, data transmission, and intelligence satellites collectively insured for an estimated 18.3 billion USD. As the lack of natural cleansing mechanisms at the GEO altitude renders the lifetimes of GEO debris essentially infinite, conjunction and risk assessment must be performed to safeguard operational assets from debris collisions. In this thesis, longitude-dependent debris congestion is characterized by predicting the number of near-miss events per day for every longitude slot at GEO, using custom debris propagation tools and a torus intersection metric. Near-miss events with the present-day debris population are assigned risk levels based on GEO-relative position and speed, and this risk information is used to prioritize the population for debris removal target selection. Long-term projections of debris growth under nominal launch traffic, mitigation practices, and fragmentation events are also discussed, and latitudinal synchronization of the GEO debris population is explained via node variations arising from luni-solar gravity. In addition to characterizing localized debris congestion in the GEO ring, this thesis further investigates the conjunction risk to operational satellites or debris removal systems applying low-thrust propulsion to raise orbit altitude at end-of-life to a super-synchronous disposal orbit. Conjunction risks as a function of thrust level, miss distance, longitude, and semi-major axis are evaluated, and a guidance method for evading conjuncting debris with continuous thrust by means of a thrust heading change via single-shooting is developed.\n\nInfluence of Miles City Line 1 on the United States Hereford Population\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nThe goal of this research was to document the influence of Line 1 (L1) Hereford cattle developed by the United States Department of Agriculture at its research facility in Miles City, Montana, on the United States Hereford population.

H.; Jones, H. P.; Henney, C. J.; Hill, F.\n\n2000-12-01\n\nWe present a high-school level educational/research module for a project that improves computer and analytical skills and contributes new scientific results to the field of solar astronomy and physics. The module has been developed within the RET (Research Experience for Teachers) program as a new application of a cooperative project between the RBSE (Research-Based Science Education) initiative of the NSF and the NASA Education/Public Outreach program. The research goal is to improve our knowledge of the characteristics of solar active longitudes, where sunspots tend to cluster. In particular, the rotation rate of these regions is poorly known. It is suspected that the active longitude rotation rate (ALRR) is different from the rotation rate of the solar surface. If this is true, the ALRR can be compared with the internal rotation rate deduced by helioseismology providing an estimate of the active region depth. A good determination of the ALRR requires the measurement of the position of thousands of individual active regions, a step best done by interactive examination of images, selection of regions, and determination of heliographic position. These tasks are well-suited for high school students, who are thus provided with a motivation to improve their computer and scientific thinking skills. ScionImage (PC)/NIH Image (Macs) macros for this purpose have been developed which access a CD-ROM of 25 years of NSO/Kitt Peak magnetogram data and laboratory exercises developed previously for classroom use. In the future, a web site will be created for collecting the data from classrooms across the US, and for status reports on the results.\n\nCities' Role in Mitigating United States Food System Greenhouse Gas Emissions.\n\nPubMed\n\nMohareb, Eugene A; Heller, Martin C; Guthrie, Peter M\n\n2018-05-15\n\nCurrent trends of urbanization, population growth, and economic development have made cities a focal point for mitigating global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The substantial contribution of food consumption to climate change necessitates urban action to reduce the carbon intensity of the food system. While food system GHG mitigation strategies often focus on production, we argue that urban influence dominates this sector's emissions and that consumers in cities must be the primary drivers of mitigation. We quantify life cycle GHG emissions of the United States food system through data collected from literature and government sources producing an estimated total of 3800 kg CO 2 e/capita in 2010, with cities directly influencing approximately two-thirds of food sector GHG emissions. We then assess the potential for cities to reduce emissions through selected measures; examples include up-scaling urban agriculture and home delivery of grocery options, which each may achieve emissions reductions on the order of 0.4 and â¼1% of this total, respectively. Meanwhile, changes in waste management practices and reduction of postdistribution food waste by 50% reduce total food sector emissions by 5 and 11%, respectively. Consideration of the scale of benefits achievable through policy goals can enable cities to formulate strategies that will assist in achieving deep long-term GHG emissions targets.\n\nThe State of City Leadership for Children and Families: Innovations and Trends in Education\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nNational League of Cities Institute for Youth, Education and Families (NJ1), 2009\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe Institute for Youth, Education, and Families (YEF Institute) is a special entity within the National League of Cities (NLC).

L.; Marsh, J. G.; Williamson, R. G.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nAn estimation is made of the principal long-period spherical harmonic parameters in the representation of the M2 ocean tide from the orbital histories of the three satellites 1967-92A, Starlette, and GEOS 3. The data used are primarily the evolution of the orbital inclinations of the satellites in conjunction with the longitude of the ascending node from GEOS 3. Analysis procedure and analytic formulation, as well as ocean tidal parameter estimation and deceleration of the lunar mean longitude are outlined. The credibility of the M2 ocean tide solution is further enhanced by the close accord between the computed value for the deceleration of the lunar mean longitude and other recently reported estimates. It is evident from the results presented that studies of close earth satellite orbits are able to provide important information about the tidal forces acting on the earth.\n\nIonospheric Longitude Storm Dependence Upon the Magnitude of the Earth's Magnetic Field\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSojka, J. J.; David, M.; Schunk, R. W.\n\n2007-12-01\n\nThe Earth's magnetic field in the ionosphere is understood to be non-dipolar with significant deviations in magnitude and orientation across the globe. This study models the mid-latitude ionospheric response to a geomagnetic storm for different idealizations of the Earth's magnetic field strength. In so doing the study addresses the question whether or not a longitude dependence in ionospheric storm responses could exist due to the longitude dependence of the magnetic field [ Huang et al., 2005], and if so, how significant is the effect? The mechanism by which the magnetic field magnitude has a first order effect is through the E x B plasma drift that has a vertical components, i.e., usually described as a meridional plasma drift caused by the zonal electric field. This vertical drift is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the magnetic field. A vertical drift raises or lowers the F-region into regions of lesser or greater recombination rates respectively, hence, directly affecting the plasma density. The Utah State University (USU) Time Dependent Ionospheric Model (TDIM) uses a tilted dipole magnetic field model to represent the Earth's field. The magnitude of magnetic field is specified by the dipole moment, in fact, the magnetic field strength on the surface of the Earth at the magnetic equator. Changing this one parameter enables studies to be made under identical storm conditions of the effect of different magnetic field magnitudes. For this study the normal 0.31 Gauss surface magnetic field is replaced by 0.24 Gauss and 0.41 Gauss. These two numbers represent the magnitude of the minimum and maximum observed field strength around the Earth equatorial region. The TDIM results are shown for a storm simulation that occurred on 5-6 November 2001. For otherwise identical model conditions and drivers, the difference in magnetic field strength results in a factor of 2 difference in TEC, NmF2, etc. Since the magnetic field magnitude is weakest in the Atlantic\n\nTEC Longitude Difference Using GIMS and the IRI Model\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNatali, Maria Paula; Meza, Amalia Margarita; Mendoza, GastÃ³n\n\n2016-07-01\n\nThe main geomagnetic field declination has a global distribution with positive and negative values showing maximum east-west differences over North America and Oceania and minimum differences over America and Asia. Several authors study one or more of these regions using TEC data derived from GNSS observations to describe variations in TEC. They reported a pronounced longitudinal variation respect to zero magnetic declination. One of the important factors that cause the longitude difference at mid-latitude is a combined effect of the longitude variations of magnetic declination and the variations of the zonal thermospheric winds with local time. We propose to study this effect using Global Ionospheric Maps (GIMs) and the respective TEC values generated from the International Reference Ionospheric (IRI) model, during a solar cycle, applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Our works is focused over different local times and regions at mid-latitude. PCA involves a mathematical procedure that transforms a number of correlated variables into a number of uncorrelated variables using the data itself. The spatial structure of the ionosphere variability and its temporal evolution, together are called modes, and there are ordered according to their percentage of the variability of data from highest to lowest. In this analysis the first mode has more than the 90 % of the variability, representing the nominal behavior of the ionosphere, and the second and third modes are the more important for our analysis, because they show the strong longitudinal variation in the different regions using either GIMs or the IRI model.\n\n12.2-GHz methanol maser MMB follow-up catalogue - IV. Longitude range 20Â°-60Â°\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBreen, S. L.; Ellingsen, S. P.; Caswell, J. L.; Green, J. A.; Voronkov, M. A.; Avison, A.; Fuller, G. A.; Quinn, L. J.\n\n2016-07-01\n\nThis is the fourth and final instalment of a series of catalogues presenting 12.2-GHz methanol maser observations made towards each of the 6.7-GHz methanol masers detected in the Methanol Multibeam (MMB) survey. This final portion of the survey covers the 20Â°-60Â° longitude range, increasing the 12.2-GHz follow-up range to the full MMB coverage of 186Â° â¥ l â¤ 60Â° and |b| â¤ 2Â°. Towards a total of 260 6.7-GHz MMB methanol masers (we were unable to observe five of the MMB sources in this longitude range) we detect 116 12.2-GHz masers counterparts, 64 of which were discovered in this survey. Including data from the literature, we find that there are 12.2-GHz methanol masers towards 47.1 per cent of the 6.7-GHz methanol masers in this portion of the Galaxy. Across the entire MMB survey range, we find a detection rate of 45.3 per cent. We find that the detection rate of 12.2-GHz methanol masers as a function of Galactic longitude is not uniform and there is an excess of masers with broad velocity ranges at longitudes near 30Â° and 330Â°. Comparing the occurrence of 12.2-GHz methanol masers with MMB-targeted CO observations has shown that those outflows associated with a 12.2-GHz source have a larger average dynamical time-scale than those associated with only 6.7-GHz methanol masers, supporting the notion that the 12.2-GHz masers are associated with a later phase of high-mass star formation.\n\nCity and State Takeover as a School Reform Strategy.

E.; Mason, G. M.; Cohen, C. M. S.; Nitta, N. V.; GÃ³mez-Herrero, R.; Haggerty, D. K.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nA prevailing model for the origin of 3He-rich solar energetic particle (SEP) events attributes particle acceleration to processes associated with the reconnection between closed magnetic field lines in an active region and neighboring open field lines. The open field from the small reconnection volume then provides a path along which accelerated particles escape into a relatively narrow range of angles in the heliosphere. The narrow width (standard deviation <20Â°) of the distribution of X-ray flare longitudes found to be associated with 3He-rich SEP events detected at a single spacecraft at 1 AU supports this model. We report multispacecraft observations of individual 3He-rich SEP events that occurred during the solar minimum time period from 2007 January through 2011 January using instrumentation carried by the two Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft and the Advanced Composition Explorer. We find that detections of 3He-rich events at pairs of spacecraft are not uncommon, even when their longitudinal separation is >60Â°. We present the observations of the 3He-rich event of 2010 February 7, which was detected at all three spacecraft when they spanned 136Â° in heliographic longitude. Measured fluences of 3He in this event were found to have a strong dependence on longitude which is well fit by a Gaussian with standard deviation ~48Â° centered at the longitude that is connected to the source region by a nominal Parker spiral magnetic field. We discuss several mechanisms for distributing flare-accelerated particles over a wide range of heliographic longitudes including interplanetary diffusion perpendicular to the magnetic field, spreading of a compact cluster of open field lines between the active region and the source surface where the field becomes radial and opens out into the heliosphere, and distortion of the interplanetary field by a preceding coronal mass ejection.

The results indicated that both large metropolitan and rural counties have lost population and income due to migration. Small metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties closer to cities gained population and income. Counties in South Florida attracted a large number of higher-income migrants from the largest cities in the US. In the last 13 years, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, the three most populous cities in the US, had negative migration effectiveness. Suburban areas and second-tier cities continued to attract people from large metropolitan areas.\n\nSacramento City Unified School District Chapter 1/State Compensatory Education Handbook Series.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSacramento City Unified School District, CA.\n\nFour handbooks developed by the Consolidated Programs Department of the Sacramento City Unified School District (California) provide a means by which the multitude of federal, state, and district rules and regulations pertaining to compensatory education can be understood.

W.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Traffic-related noise is a growing public health concern in developing and developed countries due to increasing vehicle traffic. Epidemiological studies have reported associations between noise exposure and high blood pressure, increased risk of hypertension and heart disease, and stress induced by sleep disturbance and annoyance. These findings motivate the need for regular noise assessments within urban areas. This paper assesses the relationships between traffic and noise in three US cities. Methods Noise measurements were conducted in downtown areas in three cities in the United States: Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York City. For each city, we measured ambient noise levels, and assessed their correlation with simultaneously measured vehicle counts, and with traffic data provided by local Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO). Additionally, measured noise levels were compared to noise levels predicted by the Federal Highway Administrationâs Traffic Noise Model using (1) simultaneously measured traffic counts or (2) MPO traffic data sources as model input. Results We found substantial variations in traffic and noise within and between cities. Total number of vehicle counts explained a substantial amount of variation in measured ambient noise in Atlanta (78%), Los Angeles (58%), and New York City (62%). Modeled noise levels were moderately correlated with measured noise levels when observed traffic counts were used as model input. Weaker correlations were found when MPO traffic data was used as model input. Conclusions Ambient noise levels measured in all three cities were correlated with traffic data, highlighting the importance of traffic planning in mitigating noise-related health effects. Model performance was sensitive to the traffic data used as input. Future noise studies that use modeled noise estimates should evaluate traffic data quality and should ideally include other factors, such as local roadway, building, and meteorological\n\nTime and Time Again; Determination of longitude at sea in the 17th Century\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nde Grijs, Richard\n\n2017-11-01\n\nDetermination of one's longitude at sea has perplexed sailors for many centuries. The significant uptake of world trade in the 17th and 18th Centuries rendered the increasingly urgent need to solve the 'longitude problem', an issue of strategic national importance. Historical accounts of these efforts often focus almost exclusively on John Harrison's role in 18th-Century Britain. This book starts instead from Galileo Galilei's late-16th-Century development of an accurate pendulum clock, which was first achieved in practice in the mid-17th-Century by Christiaan Huygens in the Dutch Republic. It is primarily based on collections of letters that have not been combined into a single volume before. Extensive introductory chapters on the history of map making, the establishment of the world's reference meridian at Greenwich Observatory, and the rise of the scientific enterprise provide the appropriate context for non-expert readers to fully engage with the book's main subject matter.\n\nKid-Friendly Cities Report Card, 2001.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPolansky, Lee S., Ed.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nThis report examines the health and wellbeing of children in the United States' largest cities, covering every city with a population of 100,000 or more, as well as the largest cities in states without any cities of this size.

Citizenship is generally accorded only to those who reside in Vatican City for reasons of office of employment. Supreme legislative, executive, and judicial power is currentily exercised by Pope John Paul II, the 1st non-italian pope in 5 centuries. The State of Vatican City is recognized by many nations as an independent sovereign state under the temporal jurisdiction of the Pope. By 1984, 108 countries had established diplomatic relations with the Holy See, most of which are not Roman Catholic. Third World countries comprise a large proportion of countries that have recently established relations with the Holy See. The US re-established relations with the Vatican in 1984 and there is frequent contact and consultation between the 2 states on key international issues.\n\nKinematics of symmetric Galactic longitudes to probe the spiral arms of the Milky Way with Gaia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAntoja, T.; Roca-FÃ brega, S.; de Bruijne, J.; Prusti, T.\n\n2016-05-01\n\nAims: We model the effects of the spiral arms of the Milky Way on the disk stellar kinematics in the Gaia observable space. We also estimate the Gaia capabilities of detecting the predicted signatures. Methods: We use both controlled orbital integrations in analytic potentials and self-consistent simulations. We introduce a new strategy to investigate the effects of spiral arms, which consists of comparing the stellar kinematics of symmetric Galactic longitudes (+l and -l), in particular the median transverse velocity as determined from parallaxes and proper motions. This approach does not require the assumption of an axisymmetric model because it involves an internal comparison of the data. Results: The typical differences between the transverse velocity in symmetric longitudes in the models are of the order of ~2 km s-1, but can be larger than 10 km s-1 for certain longitudes and distances. The longitudes close to the Galactic centre and to the anti-centre are those with larger and smaller differences, respectively. The differences between the kinematics for +l and -l show clear trends that depend strongly on the properties of spiral arms. Thus, this method can be used to quantify the importance of the effects of spiral arms on the orbits of stars in the different regions of the disk, and to constrain the location of the arms, main resonances and, thus, pattern speed. Moreover, the method allows us to test different origin scenarios of spiral arms and the dynamical nature of the spiral structure (e.g. grand design versus transient multiple arms). We estimate the number of stars of each spectral type that Gaia will observe in certain representative Galactic longitudes, their characteristic errors in distance and transverse velocity, and the error in computing the median velocity as a function of distance. We will be able to measure the median transverse velocity exclusively with Gaia data, with precision smaller than ~1 km s-1 up to distances of ~4-6 kpc for\n\nInvestigating Systematic Errors of the Interstellar Flow Longitude Derived from the Pickup Ion Cutoff\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTaut, A.; Berger, L.; Drews, C.; Bower, J.; Keilbach, D.; Lee, M. A.; Moebius, E.; Wimmer-Schweingruber, R. F.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nComplementary to the direct neutral particle measurements performed by e.g. IBEX, the measurement of PickUp Ions (PUIs) constitutes a diagnostic tool to investigate the local interstellar medium. PUIs are former neutral particles that have been ionized in the inner heliosphere. Subsequently, they are picked up by the solar wind and its frozen-in magnetic field. Due to this process, a characteristic Velocity Distribution Function (VDF) with a sharp cutoff evolves, which carries information about the PUI's injection speed and thus the former neutral particle velocity. The symmetry of the injection speed about the interstellar flow vector is used to derive the interstellar flow longitude from PUI measurements. Using He PUI data obtained by the PLASTIC sensor on STEREO A, we investigate how this concept may be affected by systematic errors. The PUI VDF strongly depends on the orientation of the local interplanetary magnetic field. Recently injected PUIs with speeds just below the cutoff speed typically form a highly anisotropic torus distribution in velocity space, which leads to a longitudinal transport for certain magnetic field orientation. Therefore, we investigate how the selection of magnetic field configurations in the data affects the result for the interstellar flow longitude that we derive from the PUI cutoff. Indeed, we find that the results follow a systematic trend with the filtered magnetic field angles that can lead to a shift of the result up to 5Â°. In turn, this means that every value for the interstellar flow longitude derived from the PUI cutoff is affected by a systematic error depending on the utilized magnetic field orientations. Here, we present our observations, discuss possible reasons for the systematic trend we discovered, and indicate selections that may minimize the systematic errors.\n\nDissipation in a tidally perturbed body librating in longitude\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEfroimsky, Michael\n\n2018-05-01\n\nInternal dissipation in a tidally perturbed librating body differs in several respects from the tidal dissipation in a steadily spinning rotator. First, libration changes the spectral distribution of tidal damping across the tidal modes, as compared to the case of steady spin. This changes both the tidal heating rate and the tidal torque. Second, while a non-librating rotator experiences alternating deformation only due to the potential force exerted on it by the perturber, a librating body is also subject to a toroidal force proportional to the angular acceleration. Third, while the centrifugal force in a steadily spinning body renders only a permanent deformation (which defines the oblateness when the body cools down), in a librating body this force contains two alternating components-one purely radial, another a degree-2 potential force. Both contribute to heating, as well as to the tidal torque and potential (and, thereby, to the orbital evolution). We develop a formalism needed to describe dissipation in a homogeneous terrestrial body performing small-amplitude libration in longitude. This formalism incorporates as its part a linear rheological law defining the response of the rotator's material to forcing. While the developed formalism can work with an arbitrary linear rheology, we consider a simple example of a Maxwell material. We demonstrate that, independent of the rheology, forced libration in longitude can provide a considerable and even leading-and sometimes overwhelming-input in the tidal heating. Based on the observed parameters, this input amounts to 52% in Phobos, 33% in Mimas, 23% in Enceladus, and 96% in Epimetheus. This supports the hypothesis by Makarov and Efroimsky (2014) that the additional tidal damping due to forced libration may have participated in the early heating up of some of the large moons. As one possibility, such a moon could have been chipped by collisions-whereby it acquired a higher permanent triaxiality and, therefore, a\n\n78 FR 6832 - Notice of Mailing Address Change for the Utah State Office, Salt Lake City, UT\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2013-01-31\n\n...The mailing address for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Utah State Office, in Salt Lake City, Utah, will be changing from P.O.

S.; Mewaldt, R. A.; Mason, G. M., E-mail: cohen@srl.caltech.edu\n\nSince the 2006 launch of STEREO , multi-spacecraft studies have yielded several surprising results regarding the spread of solar energetic particles (SEPs) within the inner heliosphere. We have investigated the role of energy and ridigity, using ACE and STEREO 10 MeV n{sup â1} oxygen data to identify 41 large SEP events observed by two or three spacecraft. We calculated fluence spectra from â¼0.1 to >10 MeV n{sup â1} for H, He, O, and Fe for each event at the observing spacecraft (including SOHO and GOES ). The particle fluences at 0.3, 1, and 10 MeV n{sup â1} were examined asmoreÂ Â» a function of the distance between the associated solar flare longitude and the spacecraft magnetic footpoints at the Sun to determine the longitudinal spread of particles and study how the distribution centers and widths depend on energy and charge-to-mass (Q/M) for the first time. On average, the three-spacecraft event distributions were centered at 22 Â± 4Â° west of the flare site and were 43 Â± 1Â° wide, though there was substantial variability, while the fit to the aggregate of the two-spacecraft event fluences yielded significantly wider distributions at 0.3 and 1 MeV n{sup â1}. The widths derived from both the three- and two-spacecraft events show an energy dependence with distributions narrowing with increasing energy, consistent with lower energy ions experiencing more field line co-rotation, or being accelerated over a larger portion of the CME-driven shock or for longer times as the shock expands. Surprisingly, no clear evidence was found for a Q/M dependence to the widths or centers suggesting that rigidity-related processes are not the dominant means of spreading particles in longitude.Â«Â less\n\nActive Longitude and Solar Flare Occurrences\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGyenge, N.; LudmÃ¡ny, A.; Baranyi, T.\n\n2016-02-01\n\nThe aim of the present work is to specify the spatio-temporal characteristics of flare activity observed by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) in connection with the behavior of the longitudinal domain of enhanced sunspot activity known as active longitude (AL). By using our method developed for this purpose, we identified the AL in every Carrington Rotation provided by the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data. The spatial probability of flare occurrence has been estimated depending on the longitudinal distance from AL in the northern and southern hemispheres separately. We have found that more than 60% of the RHESSI and GOES flares is located within +/- 36^\\\\circ from the AL. Hence, the most flare-productive active regions tend to be located in or close to the active longitudinal belt. This observed feature may allow for the prediction of the geo-effective position of the domain of enhanced flaring probability. Furthermore, we studied the temporal properties of flare occurrence near the AL and several significant fluctuations were found. More precisely, the results of the method are the following fluctuations: 0.8, 1.3, and 1.8 years. These temporal and spatial properties of the solar flare occurrence within the active longitudinal belts could provide us with an enhanced solar flare forecasting opportunity.\n\nLabor Trends: Overview of the United States, New York City, and Long Island.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nJagoda, Anna May; Goldstein, Cheryl\n\nThis overview of labor trends in the United States, New York City, and Long Island is a compilation of information and statistics derived from seven major sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Lebenthal & Co., Inc.; Queens County Overall Economic Development Corporation; Suffolk County Department of Labor; The New York Times; U.S. Department ofâ¦\n\n76 FR 31991 - All Items Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers; United States City Average\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-06-02\n\n...

The aim of this study was to broaden the knowledge about the presence of dermatophytes in soils of urban (empty lots, schools, slums, squares, beaches and homes) and rural areas and about the evolution of their prevalence in soils of varying pH in cities of the four mesoregions of Paraiba State, Brazil. Soil samples were collected from 31 cities of Paraiba State. Of 212 samples, 62% showed fungal growth, particularly those from the Mata Paraibana mesoregion (43.5%), which has a tropical climate, hot and humid. Soil pH varied from 4.65 to 9.06, with 71% of the growth of dermatophytes occurring at alkaline pH (7.02 - 9.06) (Ï = 0.000). Of 131 strains isolated, 57.3% were geophilic species, particularly Trichophyton terrestre (31.3%) and Mycrosporum gypseum (21.4%). M. nanum and T. ajelloi were isolated for the first time in Paraiba State. The zoophilic species identified were T. mentagrophytes var. mentagrophytes (31.3 %) and T. verrucosum (7.6 %), and T. tonsurans was isolated as an anthropophilic species. The soils of urban areas including empty lots, schools, slums and squares of cities in the mesoregions of Paraiba State were found to be the most suitable reservoirs for almost all dermatophytes; their growth may have been influenced by environmental factors, soils with residues of human and/or animal keratin and alkaline pH.

Significantly depleted ionosphere have been observed at stations north of 50Â°N geographic on March 18, 2015 following the above storm over a longitude swath 11.9Â°-21Â°E covering the Eastern Africa and Western European longitude sector.

Daytime thermospheric (O/N2) ratio was markedly less on March 18th at latitudes above 60Â°N geographic which is suggested to be the major driver behind depleted high latitude ionosphere during the recovery phase of the storm on March 18, 2015.\n\nCalculation of Latitude and Longitude for Points on Perimeter of a Circle on a Sphere\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMorris, Heidi E.\n\n2015-08-14\n\nThis document describes the calculation of the Earth-Centered Earth Fixed (ECEF) coordinates for points lying on the perimeter of a circle.

A number of convenient cues are available to define latitude on the basis of geomagnetic and celestial information, but very few are useful to defining longitude. To investigate the effects of displacements across longitudes on orientation, we recorded orientation of adult and juvenile migratory white-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii, after passive longitudinal displacements, by ship, of 266-2862 km across high-arctic North America. After eastward displacement to the magnetic North Pole and then across the 0 degrees declination line, adults and juveniles abruptly shifted their orientation from the migratory direction to a direction that would lead back to the breeding area or to the normal migratory route, suggesting that the birds began compensating for the displacement by using geomagnetic cues alone or together with solar cues. In contrast to predictions by a simple genetic migration program, our experiments suggest that both adults and juveniles possess a navigation system based on a combination of celestial and geomagnetic information, possibly declination, to correct for eastward longitudinal displacements.\n\nFurther foraging for pristine nonmare rocks - Correlations between geochemistry and longitude\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWarren, P.

Sixteen nonmare samples are characterized petrographically and by composition, among them numerous key trace elements (siderophiles, incompatibles). Current knowledge about nonmare lunar rocks is surveyed, with emphasis placed on correlations between geochemistry and longitude. Several systematic differences between western ANT (that is, nonKREEPy, nonmare) rocks and the much more thoroughly studied eastern ANT rocks are noted. It is noted that western ANT rocks, whether pristine or nonpristine, tend to have higher Eu/Sm than their eastern counterparts. Pristine western ANT rocks, however, tend to have lower Sc/Sm and Ti/Sm than pristine eastern ANT rocks.\n\nThe State of the Cities, 2000: Megaforces Shaping the Future of the Nation's Cities.

These studies typically use ambient monitoring data as a surrogate for exposure leading to potential exposure misclassification. The level of exposure misclassification can differ by city affecting the observed health effect estimate. The objective of this analysis is to evaluate whether previously developed residential infiltration-based city clusters can explain city-to-city heterogeneity in PM2.5 mortality risk estimates. In a prior paper 94 cities were clustered based on residential infiltration factors (e.g. home age/size, prevalence of air conditioning (AC)), resulting in 5 clusters. For this analysis, the association between PM2.5 and all-cause mortality was first determined in 77 cities across the United States for 2001â2005. Next, a second stage analysis was conducted evaluating the influence of cluster assignment on heterogeneity in the risk estimates. Associations between a 2-day (lag 0â1 days) moving average of PM2.5 concentrations and non-accidental mortality were determined for each city. Estimated effects ranged from â3.2 to 5.1% with a pooled estimate of 0.33% (95% CI: 0.13, 0.53) increase in mortality per 10 Î¼g/m3 increase in PM2.5.

M.; Escapa, A.; Baenas, T.; Getino, J.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nPrecession in longitude is affected by the internal structure of the Earth. Although this effect is small, typically described as of second-order, it must be considered in current precession theories due to the stringent accuracy and consistency requirements. The current IAU2006 precession theory is based on Capitaine at al. (2003, 2005). The influence of the Earth's geophysical model is taken into account in IAU2006 only through a sole contribution, the so-called \"non-linear effect\" computed by Mathews (2004). In elastic Earth models the contributions are twofold. A main part comes from 2nd order terms of the mathematical solution stemming from crossed influences of certain nutation-rising terms. Only the Hamiltonian theory of the non-rigid Earth has succeeded in deriving a solution for those terms so far, and they were not considered in IAU2006 precession theory. Another contributions are caused by geopotential variations resulting from the tidal deformations of the Earth, or redistribution tidal potential. IAU2006 non-linear effect belongs to this category, although it just represents a partial, simplified approach to the total effect (Lambert & Mathews 2006, 2008). The mass redistribution is induced by the gravitational action of Moon and Sun, but also by the tidal variations of the Earth's angular velocity and the resultant changes of the centrifugal potential. We present a comprehensive study of the contributions to the precession in longitude due to the non-rigidity of the Earth, based on the Hamiltonian formalism developed by Getino and FerrÃ¡ndiz for a two-layer Earth elastic model. To this end, we recall the achievements made by our group recently (FerrÃ¡ndiz et al 2016, Baenas et al 2016) and complete them by incorporating the contributions due to the tidal variations of the Earth's angular velocity, as well as anelasticity effects consistent with the IERS Conventions.

As part of this effort, NREL has undertaken a number of evaluation projects, including conducting telephone surveys with fleet managers and drivers of AFVs in the federal fleet. This report summarizes themoreÂ Â» results of the survey of state and city government fleet managers.Â«Â less\n\nProfiles of gamma-ray and magnetic data for aerial surveys over parts of the Western United States from longitude 108 to 126 degrees W. and from latitude 34 to 49 degrees N.\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nDuval, Joseph S.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThis CD-ROM contains images generated from geophysical data, software for displaying and analyzing the images and software for displaying and examining profile data from aerial surveys flown as part of the National Uranium Resource Evaluation (NURE) Program of the U.S. Department of Energy. The images included are of gamma-ray data (uranium, thorium, and potassium channels), Bouguer gravity data, isostatic residual gravity data, aeromagnetic anomalies, topography, and topography with bathymetry. This publication contains image data for the conterminous United States and profile data for the conterminous United States within the area longitude 108 to 126 degrees W. and latitude 34 to 49 degrees N. The profile data include apparent surface concentrations of potassium, uranium, and thorium, the residual magnetic field, and the height above the ground. The images on this CD-ROM include graytone and color images of each data set, color shaded-relief images of the potential-field and topographic data, and color composite images of the gamma-ray data. The image display and analysis software can register images with geographic and geologic overlays. The profile display software permits the user to view the profiles as well as obtain data listings and export ASCII versions of data for selected flight lines.\n\nAre autonomous cities our urban future?\n\nPubMed\n\nNorman, Barbara\n\n2018-05-29\n\nCities are rapidly expanding in size, wealth and power, with some now larger than nation states. Smart city solutions and strong global urban networks are developing to manage massive urban growth. However, cities exist within a wider system and it may take more than technological advances, innovation and city autonomy to develop a sustainable urban future.\n\n'A thorn in the side of European geodesy': measuring Paris-Greenwich longitude by electric telegraph.\n\nPubMed\n\nKershaw, Michael\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe difference in longitude between the observatories of Paris and Greenwich was long of fundamental importance to geodesy, navigation and timekeeping. Measured many times and by many different means since the seventeenth century, the preferred method of the later "
