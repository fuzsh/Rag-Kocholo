        "text": "For flights on designated controlled oceanic routes or areas within the Auckland Oceanic, Brisbane, Fukuoka, Honiara, Melbourne, Nauru, New Zealand and Port Moresby FIRs, a longitudinal separation minimum of 55.5 km (30 NM) derived by RNAV may be applied between RNAV-equipped aircraft approved to RNP 4 or better, in accordance with the provisions of the PANS-ATM, 5.4.2.6.\n\nSource: ICAO Doc 7030, §MID/ASIA, ¶4.1.2.1.2\n\nLONGITUDINAL SEPARATION MINIMA BASED ON DISTANCE USING RNAV WHERE RNP IS SPECIFIED\n\n5.4.2.6.2.2 Direct controller-pilot communications shall be maintained while applying a distance-based separation minima. Direct controller-pilot communications shall be voice or CPDLC. The communication criteria necessary for CPDLC to satisfy the requirement for direct controller-pilot communications shall be established by an appropriate safety assessment.\n\n5.4.2.6.3 Longitudinal distance-based separation minima in an RNP RNAV environment not using ADS\n\n5.4.2.6.3.1 For aircraft cruising, climbing or descending on the same track, the following separation minimum may be used:\n\nSeparation minimum RNP type Communication requirement Surveillance requirement Distance verification requirements 93 km (50NM) 10 Direct controller-pilot communications Procedure position reports At least every 24 minutes\n\n5.4.2.9.2 The following separation minima may be used for aircraft cruising, climbing or descending on:\n\na) the same track; or\n\nb) crossing tracks provided that the relative angle between the tracks is less than 90 degrees.\n\nSeparation minimum RNP type RCP RSP Maximum ADS periodic reporting interval 93 km (50NM) 10 240 180 27 minutes 93 km (50NM) 4 240 180 32 minutes 55.5 km (30NM) 2 or 4 240 180 12 minutes 5 minutes 2 or 4 or 10 240 180 14 minutes\n\nSource: ICAO Doc 4444, ¶5.4.2.6\n\n1.3.3.5.1 Accuracy: During operations in airspace or on routes designated as RNP 4, the lateral TSE must be within Â±4 NM for at least 95 per cent of the total flight time. The along-track error must also be within Â±4 NM for at least 95 per cent of the total flight time.\n\n1.3.3.5.2 Integrity: Malfunction of the aircraft navigation equipment is classified as a major failure condition under airworthiness regulations (i.e. 10â5 per hour).\n\n1.3.3.5.3 Continuity: Loss of function is classified as a major failure condition for oceanic and remote navigation. The continuity requirement is satisfied by the carriage of dual independent long-range navigation systems (excluding SIS).\n\n1.3.3.5.4 On-board performance monitoring and alerting: The RNP system, or the RNP system and pilot in combination, shall provide an alert if the accuracy requirement is not met, or if the probability that the lateral TSE exceeds 8 NM is greater than 10â5.\n\n1.3.3.5.5 SIS: If using GNSS, the aircraft navigation equipment shall provide an alert if the probability of SIS errors causing a lateral position error greater than 8 NM exceeds 10â7 per hour.\n\nNote.â Compliance with the on-board performance monitoring and alerting requirement does not imply an automatic monitor of FTE. The on-board monitoring and alerting function should consist at least of a NSE monitoring and alerting algorithm and a lateral deviation display enabling the crew to monitor the FTE. To the extent operational procedures are used to monitor FTE, the crew procedure, equipment characteristics, and installation are evaluated for their effectiveness and equivalence as described in the functional requirements and operating procedures. PDE is considered negligible due to the quality assurance process (1.3.6) and crew procedures (1.3.4).\n\nSource: ICAO Doc 9613, Volume II, Part C,¶1.3.3.5"
