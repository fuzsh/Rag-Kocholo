        "text": "Data Set Version: V1\n\nSummary\n\nThis data set provides 30-meter resolution mapped estimates of Cajander larch (Larix cajanderi) aboveground biomass (AGB), circa 2007, and a map of burn perimeters for 116 forest fires that occurred from 1966-2007. The data cover ~100,000 km2 of the Kolyma River Basin in northeastern Siberia, Sakha Republic, Russia.\n\nLarch aboveground biomass was mapped using a combination of WorldView-1 imagery (WV-1), Landsat 5 imagery, 25 AGB field measurements, and outputs of a random forest model. A combination of Landsat reflectance values and band metrics (e.g., NDVI) were used as predictor data for the model.\n\nThe 116 fire scar perimeters were mapped using 59 Landsat scenes (WRS-2, path 104, rows 11â€“14) and additional data sets including topography, burned area, and vegetation productivity data. False-color images were used along with the normalized burn ratio (NBR) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to identify fire scars in the Landsat images. For fires that occurred between 2000-2007 the MODIS burned area product (MCD45A1) was used to identify the year of burn when possible.\n\nThere are two data files with this data set which includes the larch AGB map provided in GeoTIFF (.tif) format and the burn perimeter map provided in shapefile format (.shp).\n\nCitation\n\nBerner, L.T., P.S.A.

Quantifying climate impacts associated with forest disturbances in Siberia necessitates understanding forest biomass distribution, disturbance regimes and post-disturbance ecosystem recovery; however, there is considerable uncertainty in each of these areas (Berner et al., 2012).\n\nQuality Assessment\n\nField measurements of larch aboveground biomass against biomass estimates derived from satellite imagery were compared to AGB field data from 25 sites and there was strong agreement (r2=0.91, p<0.001, RMSE=622 g/m2; see Berner et al., 2012).\n\nData Acquisition, Materials, and Methods\n\nData Access\n\nThis data is available through the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC).\n\nSiberian Boreal Forest Aboveground Biomass and Fire Scar Maps, Russia, 1969-2007\n\nContact for Data Center Access Information:\n\nReferences"
