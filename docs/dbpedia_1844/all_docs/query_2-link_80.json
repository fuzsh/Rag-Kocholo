(q.v.) In latitude it extends from 70° N. - and includes Wrangel Island (q.v.)\n\nlying above that parallel - [ ?] down to 48°. The vast bulk of its territory lies in the\n\npermafrost zone, i.e., the entire area down to 51° . It [ ?] is thus comparable to the\n\neastern coast of the American continent, where permafrost in Labrador reaches the\n\nsame parallel. Likewise, the timberline is roughly at the same latitude in both cases: 59° in northern\n\nQuebec and 61° in Khabarovsk Territory. Finally, There is also the similarity that the\n\nartery for settlement and transport in both eastern Canada and the easternmost U.S.S.R.\n\nis a great river at the southern boundary: the St. Lawrence and the Amur . Each is paralleled\n\nby railroads completely lacking further north . Each river flows through all area free of permafrost, agriculturally well\n\ndeveloped and having large cities along its banks. However, the Amur, its farms and\n\ncities lie several degrees farther north than the St. Lawrence, bringing certain prob–\n\nlems of a sub-Arctic character, such as the virtual impossibility, until very recently,\n\nof growing any fruits whatever. This, and the briefer history of uninterrupted Russian rule\n\non the Amur (1958-60) account for the population being only about half that of Quebec.\n\nWhereas, in all the foregoing respects and also in the matter of being indented\n\nby a very large body of water of Arctic temperature and ice conditions - the Okhotsk\n\nSea, corresponding to Hudson Bay - the Soviet north Pacific coast resembles Canada's\n\ncoast on the Atlantic, that comparison does not hold geologically. In this respect\n\nthe eastern and western shores of the Pacific are very much alike. Except for the\n\nvalley of the Amur, flat country is almost entirely lacking in all this million-square–\n\nmile expanse. On the peninsula of Kamchatka, an active volcanic range reaches to almost [ ?]\n\n16,000 ft., while on the mainland numerous ranges rise to 4,000 ft. and more.\n\nKamchatka Region (Oblast) (qv)\n\nBecause of its great size, Khabarovsk Territory is subdivided into four main\n\nRegions (Oblasts). The largest by far in area, occupying almost half the Krai, is also\n\nthe the least densely populated. smallest in population. It is Kamchatka Oblast, 202,700 sq mi. embracing all of the Arctic coast from\n\n163° to 170°E , within the torritery all the Soviet coast of the Bering Sea, and the eastern coast of\n\nthe Sea of Okhotsk. In other words, it includes the Kamchatka and Chukot Peninsulas and\n\nthe mainland east of the valley of the headwaters of the Kolyma. Administratively, it\n\n002 | Vol_X-0163\n\nKhabarovsk\n\nincludes the Chukchi [ ?] and the Koriak National Okrugs , (q.v.), very large areas in\n\nwhich these small native peoples are probably still in the majority, despite the rapid\n\nexpansion of Northern Sea Route way-ports in the first in stance, case and fisheries in the second.\n\nIt also includes and an Aleut Raion (County) comprising the two Komandor Islands east of\n\nKamchatka, inhabited by members of that nationality. Kamchatka Oblast has its capital at\n\n[ ?] the year–\n\nround port of Petropavlovsk founded 1822, in 1740 , with a population risen from 1,200 in 19 [ ?] 6 to 45,000 in 1947, judging by the\n\nelectoral apportionment of that year. (A decade earlier, there had been 20,000.) In the entire Region there is no other locality\n\nmeriting the designation of town in Soviet administrative parlance. but s Six have risen\n\nfrom being mere \"inhabited points\", with perhaps a radio and weather station, trading post and native\n\nschool , to the status of \"workers' settlement\", engaged in commeric ci al shipping, mining,\n\nfishing, canning or and administrative responsibility for the surrounding countryside,\n\nor a combination of two or more of these. Their dates of incorporation as workers' settle–\n\nments indicates how recent is the opening of the Arctic and sub-Arctic. Three of them,\n\nAnadyr (1934), Providenie (1946) and Ugolnyi (1946), all on Anadyr Bay of the Bering\n\nSea, are in the truly Arctic Chukot National Okrug, of which Anadyr is the administrative\n\ncenter . , a truly Arctic area. The Koriak National Okrug 151,700 sq. mi. in area (about the size of California) has no workers' settlement as yet, being administered\n\nfrom the village of Palana. The other three workers' settlements are on the sub [ ?] -Arctic\n\nsouthern half of Kamchatka, which corresponds to the Panhandle of Alaska. They are\n\nIndustrialnyi, a manufacturing suburb of Petropavlovsk itself, and Kikhchik and Mikoian,\n\ncenters of the fishing and canning industry on the non-freezing portion of the coast.\n\nNo population figure for Kamchatka Oblast is available, but the number of inhabitants\n\n[higher? ?] may be estimated at 100,000 between 75,000 and 105,000 of which a majority is undoubtedly in\n\nthe sub- [ ?] -Arctic southern portion of the Kamchatka Peninsula.\n\nThe electoral apportionment of 1947 indicates a population of 30,000 for the\n\nChukot National Okrug which has an area of 274,500 sq. mi, slightly larger than Texas . Whereas that is twice the last previously reported (50% more than the 1933 population) population figure for\n\nthat area, there is considerable evidence to indicate that the population might well\n\nhave grown by 10 ,000 during World War II, and that further rapid growth has taken place\n\nsince then. Thus, the Chaun Bay area on the Arctic coast, centered at Pevek, has become\n\nthe largest tin-mining area in the U.S.S.R. The promotion of Providenie and Ugolnaia, with\n\nits coal-mining, to the status of workers' settlements, is believed to indicate a popu-\n\n003 | Vol_X-0164\n\nKhabarovsk\n\nlation of a couple of thousand at each of these places. During the war, Velkal was\n\ndeveloped as a way airport on the Lend-Lease Route, and had a population of several\n\nhundred. A large factory to process whale and other blubber was built at Providenie\n\nin 1947, and a whaling station and five sealing bases established along the coast.\n\nUelen (Wellen) had, in 1946, a schoolhouse, community center, post office, general\n\nstore and warehouses, newspaper office and county government building. The following\n\nyear an elaborate native handicrafts center was erected [ ?] there, with equipment for\n\nbone-carving, an art school, dormitories, power station and warehouses. But the population\n\ndensity is still only one person in ten square miles, on the average.\n\nAs for Kamchatka, population increase is indicated by the decision, in 1947,\n\nto change over from seasonal to year-round fishing, thus necessitating a permanent\n\npopulation where previously [ ?] cannery workers had been brought from [ ?]\n\nVladivostok for a three-to-five month period. As a result, the catch for all of Khab–\n\narovsk Territory (most of which is off Kamchatka) was [ ?] 164,720,000 lbs. greater\n\nin 1947 than in the previous year. 9,200,000 920,000 lbs. of caviar and 33,000,000 cans of fish\n\nand crab preserves were prepared during the year.\n\n[ ?]\n\n[ ?]\n\n[ ?]\n\n[ ?]\n\n[ ?]\n\nKolyma-Magadan Mining Counties\n\nMost impressive as an indication of rapid current development in Kamchatka Oblast [ ?]\n\n[ ?] and the Kolyma [ ?] goldfields region, [ ?]\n\nalso in Khabarovsk Territory, adjoining it immediately to the Southwest, are advertise–\n\nments such as the following, which appeared in Trud , the national newspaper of the\n\nSoviet trade unions, on June 17, 1947. (Dalstroi is the Far Eastern Construction Company,\n\nallocated the development of [ ?] Kamchatka, Chukotka and the Kolyma\n\ncountry. It is a bureau of the Dept. of the Interior, or Ministry of Internal Affairs):\n\nDALSTROI\n\nTHE FOLLOWING SPECIALISTS\n\nARE URGENTLY NEEDED FOR WORK IN THE FAR NORTH\n\n1. Mining engineers and technicians, mine-surveyors, ore concentration men, shaft-drillers,\n\nelectrical mechanics; 2. Geological engineers and technicians: prospectors and surveyors,\n\ndrillers, geophysicists, mineralogists and petrographers; 3. Geodetic engineers and carto–\n\ngraphers (graduates in geodetics); 4. Topographical technicians; 5. Physicians: medical\n\nassistants, surgeons, X-ray specialists, doctors of sanitation and food preparation, lab\n\nworkers, [ ?] pharmacists and phermaceutists, dentists and dental technicians. For in–\n\nformation and applications apply at: Dept. of Employment, 14 Gogol Blvd., Moscow;\n\n004 | Vol_X-0165\n\nKhabarovsk\n\nBureau of Labor and Recruitment for Dalstroi in Leningrad, Irkutsk, Novosibirsk, Sverdlovsk,\n\nCheliabinsk, Tomsk, Krasnoyarsk, Kirov, Molotov, Kuibyshev, Chkalov, Saratov, Rostov-on-Don,\n\nKiev, Kemerovo, Barnaul, Alma-Ata and Ufa.\n\nThis advertisement has been quoted in full because it illustrates, by the nature\n\nof the personnel sought, the all-sidedness, completeness and apparent permanence of the\n\ndevelopments envisaged. Similarly, the fact that Dalstroi maintains employment offices\n\nin every important city of European and Siberian Russia, the Ukraine and Central Asia,\n\nindicates that its operations must be on a very large scale indeed. Third, the fact\n\nthat advertising of this type takes place at all sheds light on the moot question [ ?] of\n\n[ ?] forced labor. [ ?] An advertisement of the same type, placed\n\nby the same organization, had appeared in Trud four months earlier. It specified that\n\nthe work would be along the Kolyma and on the Chukot Peninsula, and, included, in addi–\n\ntion to a much more detailed list of skills in the fields mentioned above, [ ?] teachers\n\nfor elementary and high schools, [ ?] (indicating that people had already been or were now being\n\nurged to bring out their families and settle in the mining areas), truck drivers of at\n\nleast five years' experience, telegraph operators, bookkeepers, veterinaries and zoo–\n\ntechnicians for cattle, hogs and reindeer, foresters, warehouse workers, storekeepers\n\nand men 20 to 30 years of age, with at least seven years of schooling, to be trained\n\nas mine foremen. The June 17 ad, appearing just before the opening of navigation, was\n\napparently a follow-up on that of Feb. 6.\n\nAs has been mentioned, the skilled and professional personnel sought was both\n\nfor the Kamchatka Oblast, which we have been discussing, and for the Kolyma mining [ ?]\n\nregion, lying at the head of a 350-mile graveled highway from the port of Magadan, one of the two long–\n\ndistance truck roads in the permafrost zone of the U.S.S.R. The Magadan-Kolyma area oc–\n\ncupies a peculiar administrative status, being listed as \"counties directly subordinated\n\nto the Territorial\" government. The most complete report, and the only non Russian\n\neyewitness account available on the vast developments here, is that of Henry Wallace\n\nand his party, made on the basis of an official tour in 1944, when Mr. Wallace was\n\nVice-President of the United States. The area, which had been almost entirely [ ?] uninhabited\n\nin 1930, when the first three log cabins were built on the site where Magadan now stands,\n\nhad , he reported, 300,000 people in 1944. Magadan itself had 40,000, including 8,000\n\nengineers and technicians, indicating the results of [ ?] the efforts of\n\n005 | Vol_X-0166\n\nKhabarovsk\n\nDalstroi's vast network of employment offices. A considerable inducement for labor to\n\ncome here is the fact that the minimum wage for goldminers was almost four times as high\n\nas elsewhere in the U.S.S.R. [ ?] (3,000 rubles as against 800). It is a\n\nlogical assumption that similar ratios prevailed in the professional fields. A fleet of\n\n1,800 trucks carried the yield of the thousand mines - evidently averaging a couple of\n\nhundred men each - to Magadan, and the town's largest enterprise was a factory-size\n\nrepair garage for the maintenance of these vehicles. Originally equipped with a foundry\n\nand a variety of machinery for the purpose of manufacturing spare parts, it later built\n\nthe first electric steel furnace in the Soviet Far East, and then expanded to manufacture\n\nexcavators, bulldozers, and miners' power drills, in conjunction with the machine shops of\n\nthe other major enterprise, a ship repair dockyard. Other factories make dishware, glass\n\nand electric light bulbs. The town has a large library, a professional theater company\n\nof its own, a well laid out park, schools, a children's community center, a stadium, and\n\nan evening political school for political subjects. The ballet company of the Ukrainian\n\ntown of Poltava was evacuated here during the war, and a permanent local opera and ballet\n\ntroupe has resulted [ ?] therefrom. The women of the town have developed consid–\n\nerable skill in copying landscape paintings in embroidery, and 90% of its high school\n\nstudents go on to higher education. The town has five and six-story buildings, including\n\nthe first multi-story structure ever built on permafrost.\n\nOther than the highway, [ ?] a fleet of twin-engined transport planes serve this\n\nregion, which has telephone communications between Magadan and all the mine workings.\n\nThe reason for all this activity lies in its resources of gold, lead, coal, tin,\n\nmolybdenum and radioactive rare elements.\n\nThe [ ?] population is chiefly fed chiefly on the basis of long-haul\n\ntransport, but vegetable growing has progressed sufficiently for the 1945 crop alone to\n\nhave been 12,000 tons greater than in the previous year. No overall crop figure is avail–\n\nable. The effort to make this truly Arctic area fully habitable has taken such forms as\n\nthe opening, in 1940, of a sanatorium at Hot Springs, just off the highway, in wooded\n\nhills at an altitude of 2,100 ft.\n\nLower Amur Region (Oblast) (qv)\n\nIn many respects the least-developed portion of Khabarovsk Territory is the sub-\n\n006 | Vol_X-0167\n\nKhabarovsk\n\nArctic western and southern coast of the Okhotsk Sea, including the mouth of the Amur.\n\nIn latitude it extends from 64°40′ 62° down to 51° . , and in longitude from 130°30′ to 147°10′ E. Permafrost predominates everywhere except\n\nalong the lower Amur, where it is widespread, but not dominant. This [ ?] Region,\n\n202,700 sq. mi. in area - larger than any of our States but Texas - with 100,000 people, is almost as thinly\n\ninhabited as the Chukot and Koriak areas of the Arctic tundra. There is little reason to [ ?]\n\nbelieve that the population has increased much over the figure of 70,000 for 1938. This is\n\nbecause but Except for the lowland between the mouth of the Amur and the Shantar Islands northwestward\n\nat 55° N. , and for a small flat area around Okhotsk, just below 60° N. , it is fairly pre–\n\ncipitous mountain country, roadless, lacking in important mineral wealth, unsuited to\n\nagriculture, and not yet needed for its lumber resources, so long as more accessible\n\nareas as available. There is only one town, Nikolaevsk at the mouth of the Amur, dating\n\nfrom 1852, and one workers' settlement, Didbiran, nearby, promoted to that status in\n\n1939. The \"ports\" of Okhotsk, Aian and Chumikan, county seats strung up the coast,\n\nare actually no more than villages with tracks leading inland."
