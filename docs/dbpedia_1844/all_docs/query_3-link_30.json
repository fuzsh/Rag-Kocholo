        "text": "About the Messier Marathon Planner:\n\nWhat is the best order for observing the Messier Objects during a Messier Marathon?\n\nThis web page will take your proposed date, your longitude, latitude, time zone offset from Universal (Greenwich) time, and display a complete list of Messier objects. You can also supply a title for the table, as well as set \"extinguishing\" values for horizon limitations due to air purity, elevation and different types of twilight. You then select whether you want a table in order by Messier number, Right Ascension, Declination, Visual magnitude (mv), or a selected Viewing sequence. Finally you can turn on or off options to show a small image of the objects, include information when the object will be at maximum altitude and whether or not to include remarks about each object. Just enter your parameters and click Submit.\n\nReading the resulting table:\n\nImageIf you select the \"Include Images\" option before clicking Submit, a small picture of the Messier object will be shown here. ObservedUse this column to check off the objects as you observe them.\n\nIf the object cannot be observed on the chosen night, the Planner will fill this in with:\n\n\"not poss D\" - the object's Declination is too low for your horizon limit\n\n\"not poss S\" - the object is just too near the sun to be seen after sunset or before sunrise due to the Astronomical Twilight effect\n\n\"not poss A\" - the highest altitude attained between sunset and sunrise is still below your horizon limit\n\nIn some cases more than one will apply and each reason will be shown. If an object can not be viewed for any of these reasons, the columns Verified and Seq will be crossed out. VerifiedIf your Messier Marathon requires independent verification of marathoner sightings, the \"verifiers\" can use this column to initial the marathoners sightings of each object. M#The Messier number of the object. There is some controversy around the identity of some Messier objects. The identities used here are those in the RASC Observer's Handbook. NGC#The NGC (New General Catalogue) number for the object. Since a few Messiers do not have NGC numbers, other common designations may appear here. PolarThis designates which objects are circumpolar from the latitude selected and can theoretically be observed any time that night although the \"best\" time would be when they are highest in the sky to avoid northern horizon effects. It reports:\n\nYes - the object is circumpolar and always North of the local Zenith.\n\nYesT - the object is circumpolar but at its declination and your latitude, it is capable of transiting south of your local Zenith. (This is possible only for locations above +45° N, or below -45° S.)\n\n** - either of the above followed by ** means the object is also fairly close to the Sun's RA. In this case it would be best observed just after sunset or before sunrise, otherwise it may be too low on your northern horizon.\n\nblank - the object is not circumpolar from the latitude selected\n\nSeqThe viewing sequence number. The following options are available in this version, all predetermined lists from the following Messier Marathon sources:\n\nPhil Harrington - Astronomy, March 2002\n\nDon Machholz - Messier Marathon Observer's Guide\n\nEd Ting - Sky & Telescope, March 2000\n\nTomm Lorenzin, 1997\n\nAstronomy Magazine, March 2006\n\nLarry McNish for 51°N, 2006\n\nTom Cameron for Calgary RASC WCO\n\nTypeThe type of object as given in the RASC Handbook. ConsThe constellation associated with the Messier object. RA hr and RA minThe Right Ascension of the object (2000.0). Dec° and Dec minThe Declination of the object (2000.0). Max Alt°\n\n@ time\n\n@ Azm°If you select the \"Show Max Altitude\" option before clicking Submit, the following 3 columns will also be shown:\n\nMax Alt° - the maximum altitude above the horizon the object will achieve between sunset and sunrise\n\n@ time - the local time when the maximum altitude is reached\n\n@ Azm° - the azimuth angle when the maximum altitude is reached\n\nRise @\n\nTrans @\n\nSet @If you select the \"Include Times of Rising, Transiting, and Setting\" option before clicking Submit, the following 3 columns will also be shown: (Note: This takes longer to calculate!)\n\nRise @ - the local time the object rises (if it rises between sunset and sunrise), otherwise xx:xx.\n\nTran @ - the local time the object transits (if it transits between sunset and sunrise), otherwise xx:xx. (See the comments for the Polar column above.)\n\nSets @ - the local time the object sets (if it sets between sunset and sunrise), otherwise xx:xx.\n\nmvThe visual magnitude of the object. SizeThe dimensions of the object in arc minutes. (Planetary sizes are given in arc seconds.) Dist KlyThe estimated distance of the object in Kilo light years. One Kilo light year = 9.460536x1018 m = 306.595 parsecs = 5.878504x1015 mi. RemarksComments from the RASC Observer's Handbook and/or other sources. Entries marked \"!!\" are considered \"showpiece\" Messier objects.\n\nNotes:\n\nAll times are displayed in Standard Time. With the recent change in Daylight Saving Time to the 2nd Sunday in March to the 1st Sunday in November (in North America), your Messier Marathon will probably occur during DST and you will have to ADD ONE HOUR TO ALL EVENT TIMES.\n\nA small graphic is shown beside the times of Moonrise and Moonset to show the approximate phase of the moon for the chosen day and the next day.\n\nThis program does not calculate the effect of the Moon's phase or brightness on the observations - Messier Marathons should always be scheduled near New Moon.\n\nIf the Moon does not rise or set on a particular day that time is shown as xx:xx.\n\nTo save your title, longitude, latitude, and UTC offset settings for the next time you use the Messier Marathon Planner, check the \"Remember New Values\" checkbox before clicking Submit. This will store the settings in a small \"cookie\" on your PC. Revisiting this site will then reset any values to the \"saved\" values. To eliminate the set of saved values click the small button to the right of the Reset button to delete the cookie.\n\nTo fit the results on a single page properly, set your Internet Explorer Page Setup margins to 0.25 inch.\n\nUse \"Landscape\" orientation in page setup if you include descriptions, thumbnails, or other columns of information.\n\nOther Notes:\n\nCopyright © 2005- R.
