SUMMARY OF INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARY CHANGES, TRANSFERS OF TERRITORY, AND CHANGES IN STATUS J!\" PC3LITCAL'iVTI'i`IES SINCE MAY 1945 The following statement summarizes briefly the changes in international boundaries, the transfers of territory, and the changes in status of political entities that have taken place siince VE -Day (May 1945). For the most part, the list includes only changes from the prewar status, since the alterations and an- nexations brought about directly or indirectly by German, Japanese, and Italian aggression in the 1930's and early 1940's are not considered as definitive unless later confirmed by Peace. Treaties to which the Allied nations were parties. The list does not Include the redefinition or rede.rca- tion of existing boundaries where no transfer of territories or the transfer of only small areas was involved. Boundaries that have been redefined or redenarcated in the postwar period in- clude those between Afghanistan and USSR, Norway and USSR, Ethiopia and Kenya, and Ethiopia and French Somaliland. The Ecuador-Peru boundary has been in process of demarcation for several years on the basis of the definition given in the Rio Pro- tocol of 1942 and the award of the Brazilian arbitrator. Changes in status due to the internal reorganization of a colonial empire are not listed unless such changes resulted In the creation or disappearance of political entitites. Trust territories and former mandates are given in a supplementary list at the end of the paper. The numbers and letters in this outline are the same as the numbers and letters of the corres- ponding areas on the accompanying map, Boundary and Territorial Cnhanges;~ 1945--1949 (CIA 11197). Transfers laim os vej the Antarctic continent or the Sub Antarctic islands are not included because, as a general policy, the United States Government does not recognize claims of other nations in this area.

Call No. 47966). The issue is a first edition and is marked \"not fully corrected.\" The map, however, is the best physical map of the USSR published in English, and is the most authori- tative that is available in quantity.I The compilation and publication of this map is a note -- worthy achievement but, in a preliminary edition of so involved an undertaking as this, certain errors in content and technical imperfections are almost certain to occur. The map shows a large volume of information but in some cases at the expense of legibility and clarity. Because the map is unique and of exceptional value, it is sure to be widely used. In order that Americans may be more discriminate in their use of the map, a preliminary description and evaluation is given below. Rescr Lion Terrain data shown on the new British map include contours, gradient tints, spot heights, rivers and lakes, glaciers and permanent snow, marshes, salt pans, and sandy deserts. Transportation information is detailed in relation to the scale. Roads are divided into three categories -- metalled- natural surface and tracks; and caravan routes, paths and minor tracks. Four categories of railroads are distinguished -- double track, single track, arrow gauge, and under construction or projected. Each of these is further subdivided into main and minor routes. Navigable canals are also shown. Populated places are classified An American copy of the map is being printed and should be available for distribution in the near future. -11- RESTRICTED Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP79-01005A000100070001-7 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP79-01005A000100070001-7 RESTRICTED into six categories according to number of inhabitants. Administrative boundaries are given for Union Republics in the USSR and sh.M (provinces) in China. On the front and reverse sides of the map are tables of Russian and non-Russian abbreviations of physical and cultural terms. Glossaries of physical terms are given for the Russian, Arabic, Soviet Arctic, Far Eastern, Mongolian, Persian, Scandinavian and German, western Turkic (mainly Turkey), and eastern Turkic (Central Asia) languages. Some minor errors however, appear in the glossary. For example, sovkhoz is a I'State farm (i.e., owned and operated by the state) rather than a \"big collective farm,\" and gym, is the abbreviation for imeni, meaning \"by the name. of\" and not for imen , mearinj rge estate.' The back of the map also includes a gazetteer that gives locations of approximately 9,000 places to the nearest degree of latitude and longitude. The gazetteer Is divided into three parts: populated places (approximately 6,100); hydrography and drainage (approximately 1,900); and terrain features (approximately 1,000). Although the number of place names listed is large, the map and gazetteer do not completely replace the Union of Soviet Socialist Repuubtics, 1:9,000,000, National Geographic Society, 1944. The latter map shows oblasts and in its gazetteer identifies all places by the oblasts in which they are located. Moreover, the same place names do not appear on the two maps. Consequently, both maps will be necessary in order to obtain the largest coverage of place names available in English in map and gazetteer form. Sources The source used for new British map of the USSR was the Soviet map Gi2sometricheska ra Karta SSSR (Hypsometric Map of the USSR), 1:5,000,000, Glavnoye Upravleniye Geodezit i Kartografti pri SNIC /GUGi (Principal Administration of - 12 - RESTRICTED Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP79-01005A000100070001-7 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP79-01005A000100070001-7 RESTRICTED Geodesy and Cartography of the Council of People's Com- missars jnaw the council of Minister7), 1940. A supplementary source was the Politlkg Administrativnaya Karta SSSR (Poll- tical Administrative Map of the USSR), 1:5,000,000, GUGK, 1946. Although these are basic sources, it is unfortunate that SFME Sovetskikh Sotsialisticheskikh Res blik Politiko ; Administrativnaya Karta (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Political Administrative Map), 1:4,000,000, Kartograficheskaya Chast' Voyennotopograficheskogo Upravlentya General'nogo Shtaba Vooruzhennykh Sit SSSR (Cartographic Section, Military- Topographic Administration, General Staff of the Armed Forces of the USSR), 1947, was not available for use in correcting the new British map, and in making refinements of detail in some physical data, boundaries, and transportation features. The British map is not a direct copy of the Soviet physical map. Because of the reduction in scale, a number of features shown on the original have been omitted. On the other hand, an attempt was made to add road and railroad informa- tion frequently omitted from Soviet maps. Physical Data To show terrain at the smaller scale, the 300-meter and 700-meter contour lines have been omitted from the British map. The choice is good since these contours are not important for most of the USSR. They would be desirable only in part of the Kazakh Highland and in parts of the Central Siberian Plateau. Precipices, mountain passes, volcanoes, isobaths, intermittent streams, and rapids and waterfalls have also been omitted. Use of the 1947 Soviet map mentioned above would have made it possible for the compilers to show the recent changes in the coastline of the Caspian Sea, the extent of Soviet knowledge of the Arctic coastline, and greater detail of the glacial-lake drainage of Arctic Siberia. - 13 - RESTRICTED Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP79-01005A000100070001-7 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP79-01005A000100070001-7 RESTRICTED Populated Places and Place Names The classification of populated places is b .zdd on the Soviet political map of 1946. The British map, however, has one population category fewer than the Soviet map of 1946. Places with populations under 500 have been lumped into the category \"under 2,000.\" The British map also omits factories and cultural bases, arts and winter huts, and oiations. These omissions are most critical in Arctic Siberia. The total number of place names, however, t^ greater than that shown on the Soviet physical map. This inorcaaes the usefulness of the British map but gives it ;-. ca.uttered appearance. In the European USSR, particularly, the names in some areas obscure the physical features. Spellings of plat-- >n--,de are not in accord with the BGN decisions, but a note indicates that in the next revision that system will be adopted. Aside from the differences in systems, there are some errors in the names of land features. For example: ; apadno Sayan should read Zapadnyy Sayan; Litoysko Belorusskaya Vczvyshennost' should read Litovsko-Belorusslaya Vozvyshernost'; Khrebet Borshcho Vochny should read Khrebet Borshchovochnyy; and Shredinny Khrebet should read SrediiWyy Khrebet. Tortation The British map in general shows more road and rail road information than do available Russian nwps but does not identify port cities. In the attempt to give more information than appears on most Soviet maps, some of the results are questionable. Such railroad lines as the Baykal-Amur Magistral (abbreviated as BAM), the Aleksandrov Gay-Kungrad, the Buden- novsl:-Michurinr k, the Bereznikt-Ust' Kozhva, ant' the Kuigan- tzhcvsk lines are shown as under construction or projected. ft - 14 - RESTRICTED Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP79-01005A000100070001-7 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP79-01005A000100070001-7 RESTRICTED would be a sounder cartographic practice to omit the last four lines completely and to indicate as uncertain the aline- ment of those railroads whose exact routes are not definitely kn awn. The latter practice is particularly important in the cr se of the incorrect alinement of the BAM on the new British ?nap because previous public reports and an incorrect aline - ment on the National Geographic map have already led to con- fusion and misunderstanding. The new British map shows a dense pattern of roads and trails in relation to its scale, but the road types selected do not reveal the actual character of the Soviet road system. Only two road categories are used--metalled and natural. Consequently, improved dirt roads, which comprise one-third of the total road system, are classed as \"natural surface\" roads. The important Magadan-Kolyma and the Never-Tommot highways in eastern Siberia, for example, are shown as natural surface roads although they are highly improved (for the region) roads of significant interregional importance. Thus, the failure to differentiate between improved and unimproved dirt roads results in a definite distortion of fact. Although the legend of the British maps includes a symbol for pipelines, no lines are shown on the map. Boundaries Users of the new British map are advised to heed the general disclaimer regarding boundaries since many of those given are de facto boundaries according to the US point of-view. The disclaimer, however, does not cover all of the boundary in^onsistencies on the map. The use of a bold boundary symbol in the oceans -- as between Hokkaido and Karafuto and the Kuriles, and in the Arctic -- is a questionable cartographic practice and on this map is definitely misleading. The inter- national boundary shown in the Arctic Ocean particularly, - 15 - RESTRICTED Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP79-01005A000100070001-7 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP79-01005A000100070001-7 RESTRICTED should be disregarded. US policy does not recognize the sector principle reflected in these boundaries. The map, in fact, outdoes the Soviet maps, which always make a distinc- tion between a conventional international boundary and a bound- ary of \"Soviet Polar Possessions.\" Not all of the de facto boundaries are shown on the British map; for example, the boundaries of the Porkkala Udd leasehold and of the Port Arthur area, and the new boundary in the janiskoski-Niska- koski area on the Finnish frontier. On the new map, internal administrative boundaries are shown only for the Union Republics in the USSR and for the sshen in China. The latter are generalized as well as out of date for Manchuria. In referring to Internal boundaries, the map uses English equivalents for administrative units, a practice that is confusing. Since there are no English equbrt- lents for Russian internal units, it is advisable to use the for- eign terms. - 16 - RESTRICTED Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP79-01005A000100070001-7 Approved For Release 1999/RW ; k DP79-01005A000100070001-7 M. BRIEF NOTICES A. POSTWAR MAPS OF JAPANESE MINOR CIVIL DIVISIONS The boundaries of the minor civil divisions of Japan as of August 1948 are shown on a new set of seven maps at the scale of 1:500,000. The maps were published by the Chiri Chosa Sho (Geographic Survey Bureau), the agency that has replaced the former Rikuchi Sokuryo Bu (Land Survey Department) as the chief Japanese mapping agency. . The set consists of monochrome sheets showing the boundaries of the gun (counties), shi (cities), and machi and Aura (two classes of rural administrative areas). The sheets show the following areas: (1) Hokkaido (2) Honshu Tohoku (3) Honshu Kanto (4) Honshu C hubu (5) Honshu Kinks (6) Honshu Chugoku; and Shikoku (7) Kyushu Gun and shi names are given, and machi and mura-are numbered and keyed to an accompanying list of names. . Copies of the 1:500,000 sheets would be the most suitable bases now available for plotting statistical data by minor civil divisions, despite the somewhat generalized boundaries. Some difficulty, however, might be encountered in getting clear photo- static reproductions or enlargements of the sheets because of the poor quality of the paper. Both the maps and the list of names are in Japanese, but can be used with the aid of Depart- ment of State Publication 2749 Far Eastern Series 19, \"Adminis- trative Subdivisions of Japan. -17- RESTRICTED Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP79-01005A000100070001-7 Approved For Release I 999/0 /~`I BCICA-RDDP79-01005A000100070001-7 I Comparison of the 1948 boundaries with the 1943 boundaries shown in the State Department publication indicates that the incorporation of new cities has been resumed, after a short interruption in 1944 and 1945. A check of sixteen of the forty - six k (prefectures) reveals nine new cities, three of them in Hokkaido alone. Consolidations of machi and mura appear to have been fewer between 1943 and IM-than in the years Immedi- ately prior to 1943. The 7-sheet set is accompanied by an over--all map of Japan at 1:3,000,000, which shows boundaries of dun and ski but not of machi and mura. Two copies of the 7-sheet set, the accompanying over-all map, and the list of names are available at the Army Map Service, under the following titles and call number: 1:500,000 Gun-shi-cho-son Kukaku Sozu (County-City- Rural Administrative Area Boundary ap); ffapanes7 Chirt Chosa Sho (Geographic Survey Bureau); AMS Call No. 73L 3-28-31366-500, 7 sheets, with accompanying list of names. 1:3,000,000 Gun-sht Kukaku Sozu (County-City Boundary Map ; same publisher as above: AMS Call No. 73L 1-28-31366-3000. B. VEGETATION MAP OF FRANCE An excellent 16-plate map of the Toulouse area is the first published sheet of a new map of the vegetation of France de- signed to cover the entire country, Carte de la Ve etation de la F-ra,nce, 1:200,000, Centre National de la laa Recherche Scientifique (National Center for Scientific Research), 1947, Sheet 71 -- Toulouse (CIA Call No. 38605). Sheet 71 of Carte de la France a 1:200,000 was used as the base on which details of vegetation and RESTRICTED Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP79-01005A000100070001-7 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP79-01005A000100070001-7 RESTRICTED land use were overprinted. Field studies for the sheet were made by Professor Henri Gaussen and Paul Rey of the University of Toulouse, assisted by local teachers and by representatives of various government agencies. On the Toulouse sheet, twenty-four categories of natural. vegetation are shown by twelve colors. The percentage of the area of each canton,under cultivation, and in forest, natural meadow, pasture, and waste land is indicated by black letters of graduate size. Colored letters of graduated size show the percentage of- land normally in wheat, forage crops, oats, corn, vines, potatoes, millet, buckwheat, barley, and fallow. A special symbol indicates each ten acres of vineyard; other symbols are used for the distribution of market gardens, tobacco culture, and types of fruit orchards. The top and bottom margins of the. map include eight smaller maps of the area as a whole at the scale of 1:1,250,000. Two show air photo coverage and administrative boundaries. The others are generalized maps of the distribution of dominant forest associations, soils, land use, major crops, precipitation and temperature, and other climatic hazards to agriculture (hailstorm frequency, wind direction, and storm tracks). The small maps aid materially in the interpretations of the distribu- tions shown on the main map. An explanatory text, which discusses the plant ecology of the Toulouse area, is printed in the right and left margins of the map. The text is a summary of a more detailed analysis of the area that is published separately. The technique of printing text and smaller maps around the main map is an effective method of presenting the vegetation complex in concise form. The authors, however, have included so much information that a lengthy examination is necessary - 19 -RESTRICTED Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP79-01005A000100070001-7 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP79-01005A000100070001-7 RESTRICTED in order to understand the various distributions and inter - relationships shown on the map. The Toulouse sheet of the new vegetation map of France, however, presents a wealth of information that will be of use to ecologists, agriculturalists, geographers, and cartographers. C. GREEK MAP AT 1:200,000, In an effort to meet new needs for an accurate medium scale maps of Greece arising from the current civil war, the Yeografiki ipiresla Stratou (Geographic Service of the Army) has revived its topographic map set at 1:200,000 under the new title Stratiyikbs Khartis tis Ellidhos (Strategic Map of Greece). The old 1:200,000 set, which was wholly inadequate in content and presentation, was abandoned in 1927 after the publication of only 14 sheets. The new set, by contrast, is good cartographically and presents almost as much informa- tion as the standard 1:100,600 set. For terrain it is better than the British 1:250,000 map of Greece. The new map adequately fills the gap between the Greek 1:100,000 and 1:400,000 sets, and should be of value particularly for strate- gic planning. By the end of 1948, sixteen sheets covering Ipiros (Epirus), Thessal{a (Thessaly), Sterea Elias (Central Greece), and the northwestern Kikladhes (Cyclades) had been published. Ten of these sheets, covering fpiros, Thessalia, and part of Stereft Ellis (about 22 percent of the land area of Greece) are available at both the AT AS and the CtA. The CIA call number is 38428. At the present rate of publication, the whole country should be covered at 1:200,000 by the end of 1950. All sheets are printed in two styles -- one with and one without the British Mediterranean grid. Several of the sheets have erroneously been entitled Yenikos Khartis ti's Elladhos (General Map of Greece), which is the title of the 1:400,000 set. - 20 - RESTRICTED Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP79-01005A000100070001-7 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP79-01005A000100070001-7 RESTRICTED Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP79-01fl0 k1flI QGQMO&7FFicE 3739-STATE-19519"
