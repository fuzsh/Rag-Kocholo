        "text": "ABSTRACT\n\nFar northeastern Siberia has been occupied by humans for more than 40 thousand years. Yet, owing to a scarcity of early archaeological sites and human remains, its population history and relationship to ancient and modern populations across Eurasia and the Americas are poorly understood. Here, we analyze 34 ancient genome sequences, including two from fragmented milk teeth found at the ~31.6 thousand-year-old (kya) Yana RHS site, the earliest and northernmost Pleistocene human remains found. These genomes reveal complex patterns of past population admixture and replacement events throughout northeastern Siberia, with evidence for at least three large-scale human migrations into the region. The first inhabitants, a previously unknown population of “Ancient North Siberians” (ANS), represented by Yana RHS, diverged ~38 kya from Western Eurasians, soon after the latter split from East Asians. Between 20 and 11 kya, the ANS population was largely replaced by peoples with ancestry related to present-day East Asians, giving rise to ancestral Native Americans and “Ancient Paleosiberians” (AP), represented by a 9.8 kya skeleton from Kolyma River. AP are closely related to the Siberian ancestors of Native Americans, and ancestral to contemporary communities such as Koryaks and Itelmen. Paleoclimatic modelling shows evidence for a refuge during the last glacial maximum (LGM) in southeastern Beringia, suggesting Beringia as a possible location for the admixture forming both ancestral Native Americans and AP. Between 11 and 4 kya, AP were in turn largely replaced by another group of peoples with ancestry from East Asia, the “Neosiberians” from which many contemporary Siberians derive. We detect gene flow events in both directions across the Bering Strait during this time, influencing the genetic composition of Inuit, as well as Na Dene-speaking Northern Native Americans, whose Siberian-related ancestry components is closely related to AP. Our analyses reveal that the population history of northeastern Siberia was highly dynamic throughout the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. The pattern observed in northeastern Siberia, with earlier, once widespread populations being replaced by distinct peoples, seems to have taken place across northern Eurasia, as far west as Scandinavia.\n\nNortheastern Siberia (the modern Russian Far East) is one of the most remote and extreme environments colonized by humans. Extending from the Taimyr Peninsula in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east, and from the China/Russia border north to the Arctic Ocean, the region is home to dozens of diverse ethnolinguistic groups. Recent genetic studies of the indigenous peoples of this land have revealed complex patterns of admixture, which are argued to have occurred largely within the last 10 ky1–3. However, human populations have been in the region far longer4,5, raising the possibility of a deeper, yet unknown population history.\n\nThe earliest, most secure archaeological evidence of human occupation of the region comes from the artefact-rich, high-latitude (~70° N) Yana RHS site dated to ~31.6 kya (Figure 1), though there are recently-discovered traces of an even earlier human presence4,6. Yana RHS yielded a flake-based stone tool industry and highly developed bone and ivory artefacts, reminiscent of technologies seen in the Eurasian Upper Palaeolithic (UP), and southern Siberia (Extended Data Fig. 1)5,7. By the time of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) ~23-17.5 kya8, the coldest and driest stage of the late Pleistocene, the Yana people had disappeared. Assemblages from the LGM and especially later are dominated by a distinctive microblade stone tool technology, which spread in a time-transgressive manner north and east out of the Amur region9,10, but did not reach Chukotka or cross the Bering Land Bridge (Beringia) until the end of the Pleistocene, well after the initial peopling of the Americas. Changes in material culture continued into the Late Holocene, but it remains debated whether these successive archaeologically distinct cultural complexes represent in situ technological evolution, perhaps in response to changing glacial and post-glacial climates, or if these represent distinct groups of people. If the latter, it is unclear how the groups are related to each other, to contemporary Siberians, and to Native Americans, whose ancestors possibly emerged in this region, or at the very least traversed it en route to Beringia.\n\nTo investigate these questions, we generated whole-genome shotgun sequencing data from 34 ancient individuals, with radiocarbon ages ranging from 31,600 to 600 years before present (Figure 1; Extended Data Table 1; Supplementary Information 1-2; Supplementary Data Table 1). Our data include key samples from ancient individuals for the understanding of Siberian population history: two high-quality genomes (25X and ~7X coverage) sequenced from fragmented milk teeth (Supplementary Information 2) recovered from the Yana RHS site (Yana1 and Yana2, respectively), which are the oldest, northernmost Pleistocene human remains found to date; a high coverage genome (14X coverage) of an individual from the Duvanny Yar site near Kolyma River (Kolyma1), dated to 9.8 kya; fourteen genomes from ancient individuals from sites in far eastern Chukotka (Ekven, Uelen) and the northern coast of the Sea of Okhotsk (Ol’skaya), ranging from 3 kya to 2 kya; six individuals from the ~7.6 kya site of Devil’s Gate Cave in Primorskoye, northern East Asia11; as well as ten genomes from later, Holocene-age individuals from northern and southern Siberia (Ust’Belaya, in the Lake Baikal region, and Young Yana, which is from the same area but a different locality than Yana RHS), and from northwestern Eurasia (Finnish, Saami). We merged these data with large panels of previously published ancient and modern individuals (Supplementary Information 3; Supplementary Data Table 2)3,12–42.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by The Lundbeck Foundation, The Danish National Research Foundation, and KU2016 (GeoGenetics).
