        "text": "2.3 Catch ratio of the funnel\n\nIt is widely recognized that the amount of gauge-measured precipitation includes systematic errors that are mainly caused by its wind-induced loss. The catch ratio of the Russian Tretyakov gauge for rainfall at a wind speed of 5.0 m/s is 0.88 [18]. The measurement of snowfall is far more difficult than the measurement of rainfall [17]. In addition, the catch ratio of precipitation gauges depends on the type of gauge such as physical features [17,19]. To estimate the catch ratio of the funnel installed in the sparsely distributed station network over the high-latitude mountainous regions in eastern Siberia, the same standard rain gauge was installed at the site in the Kitami Institute of Technology (KIT), Kitami, Hokkaido, Japan, for 277 days from 1 January 2005 to 5 October 2005. The amount of hourly rainfall, hourly air temperature and hourly wind speed data were obtained by the Kitami site of the Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS) operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), as shown in Figure 2. Kitami is located at the longitude almost same as study area in eastern Siberia and one of the colder places in Japan, with 763.6 mm amount of annual rainfall, 6.1°C annual mean air temperature, 1.8 m/s annual mean wind speed, and 820 mm maximum snow depth.\n\nFigure 2: Time series of the Kitami AMeDAS data of (a) hourly precipitation, (b) hourly air temperature and (c) hourly wind speed.\n\nThe amount of the hourly rainfall captured by the Kitami AMeDAS was corrected using the following formula:\n\nR corrected_AMeDAS = R AMeDAS 1 C R AMeDAS (1)\n\nC R AMeDAS = 1 1+m U estimated_AMeDAS (2)\n\nU estimated_AMeDAS = u AMeDAS ln( z p_AMeDAS z 0 ) ln( z u_AMeDAS z 0 ) (3)\n\nwhere Rcorrected_AMeDAS is the amount of the corrected hourly rainfall by the Kitami AMeDAS (mm), RAMeDAS is the amount of the hourly precipitation in an hourly air temperature above 0.0°C by the Kitami AMeDAS (mm), CRAMeDAS is the catch ratio of the precipitation gauge used in the Kitami AMeDAS, m is the coefficient depending on the gauge type (=0.0192 of AMeDAS gauge type RT-4 from January 1 to June 3 and 0.0454 of AMeDAS gauge type RT-1 from June 3 to October 5 by [20]), Uestimated_AMeDAS is the estimated hourly wind speed at the height of the precipitation gauge by the Kitami AMeDAS (m/s), uAMeDAS is the hourly wind speed by the Kitami AMeDAS (m/s), zp_AMeDAS is the height of the precipitation gauge by the Kitami AMeDAS (=1.5 m), zo is the roughness (=0.00014 m by [21]), and zu_AMeDAS is the height of the wind gauge by the Kitami AMeDAS (=14.7 m).\n\nTo estimate the catch ratio of the funnel, the amount of the corrected rainfall by the Kitami AMeDAS was compared with the amount of the rainfall by the standard rain gauge installed at the KIT site. The catch ratio of the funnel CR was calculated using the following equations:\n\nCR= R KIT ∑ R corrected_AMeDAS (4)\n\nR KIT = W KIT − O KIT − S KIT π⋅ 22.5 2 (5)\n\nwhere RKIT is the total amount of the rainfall during the observation period at the KIT site (mm), WKIT is the volume of the rainfall caught by the standard rain gauge with the funnel at the KIT site (mm3), OKIT is the volume of oil poured in the standard rain gauge to prevent evaporation at the KIT site (mm3), and SKIT is the volume equivalent to solid precipitation caught by the standard rain gauge at the KIT site (mm3). OKIT is estimated at 25,000 mm3. Because it was confirmed by visual observation that the funnel was filled with snow during the winter, and it melted into the water-storage part of the standard rain gauge in spring, to be conservative, SKIT was estimated as ice with a 917 kg/m3 density with which the water-receiving part with the 45-mm, 60° conical funnel was filled, that is, the water equivalent of 19 mm3 and equal to 1.2-mm solid precipitation in a receiving funnel.\n\n3.3 Altitude dependence\n\nTable 1 shows the amount of the corrected rainfall by the standard rain gauges installed over the high-latitude mountainous regions in eastern Siberia and the altitude at the observation sites. As shown in Figure 3, the amount of the corrected rainfall in these areas depends on altitude and that the amount of the rainfall increased slightly with an increase in altitude. To investigate the altitude dependence of rainfall over high-latitude mountainous regions in eastern Siberia, a linear equation as a function of altitude H (m) was fitted as\n\nTable 1: Corrected rainfall and altitude at observation sites.\n\nFigure 3: Altitude dependence of the corrected annual rainfall (a) in the Indigirka River basin (including glacial terrain) from 2004 through 2005, (b) in the Indigirka River basin from 2006 through 2007, (c) in the Kolyma River basin from 2006 through 2007 and (d) in the surrounding Okhotsk area from 2006 through 2007.\n\nRcorrected = aH + b (8)\n\nwhere a is the increased ratio of the amount of rainfall due to altitude (mm/m), and b is a constant (mm).\n\nThe amount of the corrected rainfall in the Indigirka River basin, including glacial terrain, during August 2004 through September 2005, Rcorrected_ir0405, is plotted against altitude in Figure 3(a). The data points were subjected to least-squares fitting. The following relationship between the altitude and the rainfall was obtained.\n\nRcorrected_ir0405 = 0.158H + 76.4 (9)\n\nThe increased ratio of the amount of rainfall due to altitude was 0.158 mm/m within an altitudinal difference of 1,397 m. The Indigirka River basin includes the glacial terrain located at an altitude of approximately 2,000 m. Results clearly show that the amount of the corrected rainfall depends on altitude and that the rainfall increased slightly with an increase in altitude.\n\nThe amount of the corrected rainfall in the Indigirka River basin, Rcorrected_ir0607, the Kolyma River basin, Rcorrected_kr0607, and the surrounding Okhotsk area, Rcorrected_so0607, during September 2006 through September 2007 are plotted against altitude in Figure 3(b), Figure (c), and Figure (d), respectively. The relationship between altitude and rainfall in the Indigirka River basin, Kolyma River basin, and surrounding Okhotsk area was obtained as follows:\n\nRcorrected_ir0607 = 0. 048H + 183.6 (10)\n\nRcorrected_kr0607 = 0.267H + 180.1 (11)\n\nRcorrected_so0607 = 0.500H + 315.7 (12)\n\nThe increased ratio of the amount of rainfall in the Indigirka River basin in 2006/2007 due to altitude was 0.048 mm/m within an altitudinal difference of 179 m. The increased ratio of the amount of rainfall in the Kolyma River basin in 2006/2007 due to altitude was 0.267 mm/m within an altitudinal difference of 435 m. The increased ratio of the amount of rainfall in the surrounding Okhotsk area in 2006/2007 due to altitude was 0.500 mm/m within an altitudinal difference of 408 m. To investigate the relationship between altitude and rainfall, we divided the sites obtained the amount of rainfall in this study into every basin and analyzed it. Then, there is the basin (surrounding Okhotsk area) where there is not much number of the rainfall data. We believe that the increase in number of the data in the future should make our conclusion sounder.\n\nIn this study the amount of rainfall in Figure 3 decreases, except for glacier terrain , as advancing from the nearby coast (surrounding Okhotsk area ) to the inland (from Kolyma River basin ◆ to Indigirka River basin ■). From the result that compared global maps of annual precipitation for sensors of AMSR2 (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2), GMI (GPM Microwave Imager), MHS (Microwave Humidity Sounder) and SSMIS (Special Sensor Microwave Imager/ Sounder), the precipitation of the neighborhood of coast shows the tendency that there is slightly many [22], and this is consistent with our results.\n\nIn addition, positive altitude dependence (that is, the amount of rainfall increases with an increase of altitude) is seen in each basin in this study if basins are different although the amount of rainfall is different at the same altitude, as shown in Figure 3. And the altitude dependence in Figure 3 is different every basin. As for this, according to the precedent study using satellite observations, the altitude dependence of rainfall has been examined in some areas using TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission)/PR (Precipitation Radar), and the results show that the amount of rainfall increases with altitude and the increased ratio of the amount of rainfall due to altitude is various by an area [23]. Our results at sparsely distributed station network over the high-latitude mountainous regions in eastern Siberia shows that the increased ratios of the amount of rainfall due to altitude are different every basin, as shown in Figure 3. This is consistent with the increased ratio being different by an area.\n\nWe clearly found that the amount of the corrected rainfall in these areas is dependent on altitude, and the rainfall amount increased slightly with altitude. The weak positive altitude dependence on rainfall was confirmed even in the eastern Siberian mountains.\n\nPrecipitation over and near mountains occurs when storms of a type that can occur anywhere (deep convection, fronts, tropical cyclones) form near or move over complex terrain [24]. Based on an isotope analysis, the westerly moisture transport is mainly strong over Russia, and westerly moisture flux decreases because of precipitation as a distance from the coast increases [25]. In addition, marine moisture at coastal stations near the Pacific and Arctic oceans is a local source for precipitation [25]. Based on a synoptic-scale analysis using reanalysis data, the water vapor origin in this area was often the Okhotsk Sea [26]. Therefore, it seems reasonable to suppose that a source of rainfall in this area is affected from the nearby coast, the Okhotsk Sea. The relationship between the obtained increased ratios of the amount of rainfall and the distance from a nearby coast (the Okhotsk Sea) is represented in Figure 4. The least-squares fitting method was applied to the data points with the arithmetic mean for each basin during September 2006 through September 2007, except for those data from August 2004 through September 2005.\n\na = -0.001D + 0.545 (13)\n\nFigure 4: Relationship between the increased ratio of rainfall due to altitude a and the distance from the nearby coast D.\n\nIt is important to note that the increased ratio of the amount of rainfall due to altitude a (mm/m) decreases almost linearly with an increase in the distance from the nearby coast D (km). The Verkhoyansk Range is located in the western part of this study area. Thus part of supply of the westerly moisture is interrupted. As the distance from the nearby coast of the Okhotsk Sea is shortened, supply of the moisture as a source of rainfall in this area increases. Therefore, based on ground-based observations, the increased ratio of the amount of rainfall due to altitude a (mm/m) depends on a distance from the nearby coast."
