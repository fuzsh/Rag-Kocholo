        "text": "Main text\n\nThe loss-of-function (LoF) mutation rs1815739C>T in ACTN3 (MIM: 102574), also known as the ACTN3 R577X allele, impacts muscle performance in elite athletes3 and muscle mass, bone mineral density, and other health parameters in life and during the aging process.4 The derived LoF allele is frequent (>0.25) among non-African populations, while in West and South African populations, its frequency is low (<0.15). Because of its latitudinal correlations in a small number of populations representing inter-continental variation and longer haplotype homozygosity in non-Africans, recent positive selection either for increased efficiency in skeletal muscle metabolism and endurance,5,6 a partial protection from muscle wasting7 or adaptation to cold environments8 have been suggested as the adaptive mechanisms behind its allele frequency patterns across the world. However, it has remained unresolved when and where the R577X frequency shift occurred, whether populations exposed to extreme cold environments, such as those living in Siberia, follow the expected patterns of increased latitudinal R577X frequency, as predicted by the cold adaptation model, and what exactly the physiological mechanism of adaptation has been.\n\nRecently, Wyckelsma and colleagues1 have shown a significant effect of the ACTN3 LoF allele on skeletal muscle thermogenesis and core body temperature maintenance through cold water immersion experiments on healthy volunteers and suggest these physiological effects to be the mechanism for cold adaptation responsible for the increase of allele frequencies, potentially by increasing infant survival in cold environments. While the physiological evidence presented by Wyckelsma et al. is undeniably insightful, it leaves open the question of where and when adaptation occurred and the role of other physiological aspects of muscle performance related to ACTN3 inactivation. The arguments for the mechanism of latitudinal adaptation to cold environments—either through differential survival of infants or some other mechanism—are only relevant if the premises for the adaptation linked to survival in cold environments hold. Here, we re-examine currently available data from 89 locations ( ) of R577X frequency in the world from modern genomes.\n\nWe analyze them together with ancient genomes to test for global versus local correlations between the presence of R577X and latitude and to determine where the LoF allele became common.\n\nConsistent with previous studies,8 we find a modest but significant correlation between latitude and R577X frequency (r = 0.251, p = 0.018) in a global panel9, 10, 11, 12, 13 of individuals from 89 regional groups (n = 3,616) ( A, , Table S1). However, this positive correlation between latitude and the derived allele frequency (DAF) of R577X appears to be entirely driven by inter-continental differences rather than latitude, as we find no significant intra-continental relationships ( C–2F). There is also no significant correlation when considering only East African and non-African variation ( B). Four populations appear to be outliers with the highest R577X frequencies. These are the Kalash from Pakistan (DAF of 0.89) and three Native American populations (0.88), each characterized by small effective population size, making genetic drift the most likely explanation of their outlier status. The lack of significant correlations at an intra-continental level is informative for distinguishing the effects of latitude and genetic ancestry on R577X allele frequency.\n\nNotably, the Ethiopian R577X frequency (0.325, n = 318) is comparable to most non-Africans, being substantially higher than the frequency in Bantu or Khoisan speakers ( C). To address whether this increase in frequency reflects possible selection or neutral demographic history, we re-analyzed data from Pagani et al. (2015).13 First, we find that the R577X frequency in the Ethiopian Gumuz people, who putatively are not affected by non-African admixture, is 0.13 (Table S1, Table S2). Second, we make use of the local ancestry deconvolution results reported in Pagani et al. (2015).13 Thereby, we observe that the unadjusted mean R577X DAF in the four admixed Ethiopian populations (0.32) is between the DAF measured on haplotypes in these populations that could be confidently assigned to African (0.19) or non-African (0.53) ancestries (Table S2). In conclusion, the Gumuz and the African deconvoluted frequencies broadly match the ones found for other Sub-Saharan African populations, while the non-African deconvoluted frequency matches the one for other West Eurasian populations. These findings suggests that the R577X allele frequency in the population ancestral to West and East Africans was most likely <0.2 and that the currently observed higher DAF in East Africa is likely to be the result of the previously documented West Asian admixture ∼3,000 years ago.,14\n\nThe absence of latitudinal correlation is most apparent in East Eurasia where populations from the extremely cold environments of Northeast Siberia have a mean frequency of R577X (0.28) substantially lower than South Asian (0.60) or Melanesian (0.73) populations living in tropical environments ( , E; Table S1).\n\nTo further explore the relationship between climate variables and the DAF at R577X, we ran the same regressions as above by using mean annual temperature retrieved from the WorldClim2 database15 as predictor. The observed patterns confirm the latitude analyses. There is no significant relationship between temperature and R577X DAF on a global scale (Figure S1A) or for most continental subsets (Figures S1D–S1F). The only exception is a moderate negative correlation among Sub-Saharan Africans (r = −0.481, p = 0.043). This is at a first glance consistent with cold adaptation. Visual inspection of the evidence shows that this signal is driven by populations from Ethiopia living at higher altitudes (Figure S1C). Here, it is crucial to note that as discussed above, these also carry substantial amounts of non-African ancestry and the latter is sufficient to explain the higher R577X frequencies in Ethiopians (see above).\n\nAs a further method to investigate neutral processes that affect allele frequencies as potential confounders of selection, we applied the phylogenetic generalized least-squares (PGLS) method,16 adapting a framework developed by Key et al. (2018).17 We focused on 12 regional groups from the Estonian Biocenter Genome Diversity Panel (EGDP) dataset where a pre-computed FST matrix was available and from which we generated a neighbor joining tree (Figure S2). When accounting for phylogenetic history, there is no significant relationship between latitude and the frequency of the T allele (beta = −0.0575, p = 0.169); the same holds when temperature is used instead of latitude (beta = 0.044, p = 0.235) (Figures S3 and S4). This is further supported by the comparison of a null PGLS model, which is only based on shared ancestry, against the full PGLS model, which includes latitude as an additional predictor. We do not find evidence that the full model is superior to the null model in explaining the allele frequency patterns at R577X (X2 = 2.49, df = 1, p = 0.138). This is also the case when temperature is added to the null model (X2 = 1.69, df = 1, p = 0.206).\n\nAs climate represents a selection factor that acts over long time periods, it is important to reduce potential confounding due to populations that recently migrated to different latitudes/climates. First, we excluded the African American, African Caribbean, and Native American populations from the 1000 Genomes Project panel from all analyses in this paper, as their ancestry is substantially derived from European sources.11 Second, we exploited available aDNA data to test whether the lower than expected DAFs at R577X in Europe and Siberia could potentially reflect recent admixture and/or replacement by populations from lower latitudes. Siberia was reached by modern humans by 45 kya18 and has had at least three subsequent population expansions and large-scale complex admixture events.19 Similarly, Europe has experienced major population turnover events since the Ice Age.20 To examine temporal changes of R577X frequencies in Siberia and in Europe, we used pseudo-haploid genotype data of ancient individuals from Europe and from archaeological sites located in Russia east of 60 degrees east longitude from the comprehensive Allen Ancient DNA Resource (n = 1,651). We observe no consistent frequency increase of the LoF allele in the time series of the past 50 kya in European or Siberian subsets of the aDNA data as would be predicted by the cold adaptation model ( ). The unusually low frequencies observed in the period following the Last Glacial Maximum are unexpected but need to be interpreted with caution because of small sample sizes. These allele frequency patterns are inconsistent with trajectories previously identified for targets of recent strong positive selection in Europe and Siberia.21, 22, 23, 24\n\nTo assess the linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based evidence for recent positive selection on the R577X allele globally in populations from different latitudes, we examined the haplotype homozygosity-based nSL26 statistic for R577X in 12 regional population groups from the EGDP data.10 The nSL is complementary to the allele frequency-based approaches discussed above and more robust to variation in recombination rates than comparable tests, such as the iHS.27 We find that the empirical p values of the nSL scores at R577X are not significant across 12 regional groups considered, including populations from extremely cold climates such as Northeast Siberians who, in fact, show a lower rather than a higher frequency of R577X. The nSL statistic thus does not support recent selection on the derived allele at R577X in populations from high latitudes ( , Figures S5–S7). This suggests that the low levels of diversity and recombination in HapMap Europeans and Asians detected previously6 should either not be considered unusual in context of genome-scale variation in a broader set of non-African samples or at least not be interpreted as a signal of strong positive selection in populations living in cold environments.1 Other tests of selection applied on global genetic datasets, including those incorporated in the 1000 Genomes Project28 and HGDP selection29 browsers or those specifically designed to identify signals of temperature-related adaptation,30,31 have also failed to identify ACTN3 as a significant target of selection in high latitude populations. Conversely, examples of cold adaptation genes identified previously, such as TRPM8,17 show a clearly different latitudinal cline and temporal allele frequency pattern than ACTN3 R577X.\n\nLastly, we examined how unusual a SNP showing an allele frequency pattern in Africans versus non-Africans comparable to that of ACTN3 R577X is. The African populations from the 1000 Genomes Project (n = 504, excluding African Americans and African Caribbeans) exhibit an R577X frequency of 0.1 and the 1000 Genomes Eurasians (n = 1,496) a frequency of 0.49. We tested how likely it is for a SNP showing a frequency of 0.1 in Africans to have experienced an increase up to 0.49 in Eurasians in the 1000 Genomes Panel. Of the 37,970 SNPs with a non-reference frequency of 0.1 in Africans, 4,741 have a non-reference frequency of 0.49 or higher in Eurasians. We find that ACTN3 R577X ranks approximately on the 12th percentile, i.e., it is not an outlier relative to the genome-wide empirical distribution. Therefore, it is plausible that the ACTN3 R577X frequency difference between Africans and non-Africans solely reflects the demographic events that led to the colonization of Eurasia."
