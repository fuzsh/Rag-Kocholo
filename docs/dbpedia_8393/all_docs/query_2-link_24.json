        "text": "ISBN: 0805774564\n\nBoston, MA: Twayne Publishers, 1986. First Edition. Softcover. “I exist, that is all, and I find it nauseating.”--Jean-Paul Sartre, Being and Nothingness. William S, Burroughs (1914–1997), a writer with whom one needs all their faculties to reckon, is known for being subversive, dark, and unflinchingly vulgar. Often crafting nightmarish dreamscapes that revel in the nadir of human existence, Burroughs is a writer who, Like Cormac McCarthy (1933–2023), is regarded as one of the finest American novelists. Founder of the Beat Generation, and the Patron saint of our particular enterprise, Burroughs’ importance to literature & culture generally, and to us here at Third Mind Books particularly, cannot be understated. The topic of today’s particular curation, “William S. Burroughs”, is a masterclass of literary criticism/analysis by the venerable Jennie Skerl. Founding Board member and Past President of the European Beat Studies Network (EBSN), renowned Beat scholar, and associate dean in the College of Arts and Sciences at West Chester University, Jennie Skerl, offers here some of the most well developed and in-depth literary analysis ever put to page on Burroughs. The scholarship and raw analytic skill on display in “William S. Burroughs” is truly staggering, and Skerl proves that she is certainly among the foremost literary scholars on Burroughs. Softcover: First Softcover Edition, as stated on copyright page, published simultaneously with a hardcover edition. (Schottlaender, I71, pg. 197; Shoaf, 207a, pg. 94) Book is in very fine condition with minor wear to fine edges, slight smudging to front and back cover. Otherwise a substantially mint & collectible volume! Very Fine. [Item #6121]"
