        "text": "Burroughs, William.\n\nThe Naked Lunch\n\nParis: The Olympia Press, 1959. First edition. A Very Good copy in like dust jacket. Rear free end paper of the book excised and some splitting at the lower inside joint. Dust jacket with some overall age toning and a small chip at the base of the spine. First printing with the green border on the title page and the original publisher's price of 1500 Francs on both the rear cover of the book and the rear flap. No price defacement, stickers or stamps as is usually found on later states of the book and jacket.\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs’ infamous novel meanders through the absurd and perverse in an improbable, non-linear narrative. While the adventure jumps from fictional dictatorships, to Mexico, to space, much of the book remains inspired by Burroughs’ own drug addiction and his friendships with Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, core Beat Generation members. Upon its publication in 1959, “The Naked Lunch” was banned from numerous cities though its literary significance was later recognized by Time magazine and the book was included in their Top 100 English speaking novels from 1923 to 2005. Very Good in Very Good dust jacket. (Item #5595)"
