        "text": "Before beginning the journey through the life of William S. Burroughs and his most famous novel, Naked Lunch, imagine this and be prepared: the taboo depictions of sex featured in Bataille’s “Madame Edwarda,” the use of unsettling thematic content like that of Nabakov’s Lolita, the inclusion of surreal features like those in Kafka’s “Metamorphosis,” the questions of queer identity proposed by Baldwin’s Giovanni’s Room, the depictions of racial exploitation documented in Ellison’s “Battle Royal” and the narrative experimentation used by Stein’s “Composition as Explanation” – all included in one piece of literary art. A grasp of these literary elements – in combination and taken to their extremes – provides some insight into Burroughs’ difficult text.\n\nGiven that Burroughs employs such a wide-range of themes, styles and structures in Naked Lunch, I will tackle its analysis using a series of discrete components that taken together should illustrate the unlimited ways in which this text continues to be relevant and transgressive. First, I will document the life of Burroughs and his place in the Beat Generation of writers as both had a profound impact on the writing and publication of Naked Lunch. Then, I will describe the controversy and issues of censorship faced by the novel, similarly experienced by many of the other texts featured in this class at their respective points in history. Finally, I will explore three critical components of the text itself: (1) its innovative narrative structure (2) its thematic content and (3) its function to affect the reader’s perception of literary art.\n\nIA. Burroughs & the Beats\n\nWilliam Seward Burroughs II was born on February 5th, 1914 to a wealthy family in St. Louis, Missouri (Miles, Call Me Burroughs, 11). Despite the unconventional nature of his adult life, Burroughs had a normal, perhaps even privileged childhood that consisted of a large family and many educational opportunities. After attending a series of boarding schools, he enrolled in Harvard University in 1932 and graduated with a degree in English Literature in 1936 (Miles, Call Me Burroughs, 29). Burroughs did not enjoy his time at Harvard and his graduation marked the end of any sort of traditional life trajectory.\n\nWith no concrete plans for his future, Burroughs went to Europe. It was there that the adventures of his life began to unfold. During his first period of living overseas (of which Burroughs had many), he spent time in Paris, Vienna, Budapest and Dubrovnik, attended Vienna Medical School for a brief period and married his first wife Isle Klapper, a German Jew trying to escape Nazi persecution (Miles, El Hombre Invisible, 30-31). During this period, Burroughs gained valuable experiences that would later inform parts of Naked Lunch: (1) medical school gave him knowledge of scientific language and principles that are pervasive throughout the text and (2) Europe exposed him to more socialist forms of government that he critiques in the novel. It is also important to note that in Europe, Burroughs finally felt free to explore his queer identity and sexuality (Miles, Call Me Burroughs, 61). Although he returned to the United States with a wife, their marriage was for the sole purpose of helping Klapper flee Germany, as Burroughs knew he was unquestionably gay. Once in the United States, Burroughs and Klapper went their separate ways and Burroughs ended up in New York where he would meet Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac.\n\nThe triumvirate of Beat Generation authors – Ginsberg, Kerouac and Burroughs – began as a small circle of friends that shared an apartment together in New York City in the early 1940s (Miles, El Hombre Invisible, 2). While they only spent a short period of time together in New York, the intimate relationships that they developed as friends, lovers, artistic collaborators and supporters lasted their lifetimes. However, Burroughs ultimately spent most of his time abroad; after New York, he traveled to Mexico, South America, Northern Africa and Europe (Burroughs 233-247). Burroughs also developed a drug habit in New York that intensified during his travels to the point where he was addicted to “junk” (all opium derivatives including heroin) for nearly fifteen years (Burroughs 199).\n\nIt was his collection of experiences as a gay, heroin addict living abroad that served as the basis for Naked Lunch. The novel loosely chronicles the experiences (both real and surreal) of a junkie named William Lee on the road to recovery from addiction. The multiple settings of the text are based on places that Burroughs actually lived while coping with his addiction such as Mexico and Tangiers. Much of the novel is based on notes written by Burroughs while on drugs as well as letters he wrote to Ginsberg while he was living abroad. The novel took nearly a decade to complete; it spanned Burroughs’ experiences over four continents and went through dozens of drafts, titles and manuscripts (Burroughs 233). The ultimate completion and eventual publication of Naked Lunch would not have been possible without the encouragement and editing of Ginsberg and Kerouac. Burroughs even credits the novel’s title to Kerouac (Burroughs 199). It was also Ginsberg, not Burroughs, who ardently pursued the publication of Naked Lunch, which proved to be a difficult task and one that is chronicled below (Miles, El Hombre Invisible, 98-99). Overall, Naked Lunch, with its shocking, semi-autobiographical content and its collaborative production, truly represents a product of not only Burroughs, but also the Beat Generation.\n\nIB. Transgressive Texts on Trial: The case of Naked Lunch\n\nIt was Ginsberg, in his editorial role, who should be credited with getting this controversial text published. After submitting several chapters of Naked Lunch to various publishers, the editor of the Chicago Review, Isaac Rosenthal, agreed to publish them in the magazine’s 1958 issue (Miles, El Hombre Invisible, 98). The Burroughs material, however, was harshly ridiculed and the editorial policy of the University of Chicago publication was put into question. This reaction led the university to ban further publication of Burroughs’ work, which in turn, caused Rosenthal to resign as editor and start his own magazine to publish the suppressed material. This scandalous affair caught the attention of the media as well as publisher Maurice Girodias of the Olympia Press in Paris (Burroughs 242). Intrigued by the text, Girodias agreed to publish the entirety of Naked Lunch in 1959. The novel was later published in the United States in 1962 by Grove Press, but quickly thereafter faced a censorship trial.\n\nThe Massachusetts Supreme Court tried Naked Lunch for obscenity due to the novel’s pornographic descriptions (Judson 1). In its initial ruling, the book was found to be obscene and banned from publication. It was only after an appeal and the testimony of notable members of the literary community, that the court found Naked Lunch to have some “redeeming social value” (Burroughs 243). The two most notable writers to testify were Allen Ginsberg and Norman Mailer. Ginsberg even concluded his testimony with a poem called, “On Burroughs’ Work:”\n\n“A naked lunch is natural to us,\n\nwe eat reality sandwiches.\n\nBut allegories are so much lettuce.\n\nDon’t hide the madness” (Judson 2)\n\nWith the trial concluded in 1966, Naked Lunch and Burroughs were free to become the cultural sensations of the 1970s that they were in the United States (Miles, El Hombre Invisible, 5).\n\nIIA. Structure: Transgressing the traditional narrative\n\nBefore analyzing Naked Lunch for its thematic content and meaning, it is important to understand its transgressive narrative structure. The structure employed by Burroughs is transgressive because it harshly differs from traditional expectations and concepts of narration. In this context, transgression can be defined using Chris Jenks’ framework as something “beyond the bounds of limits set by a commandment or law or convention” (Jenks 2). Burroughs definitely goes beyond narrative convention.\n\nNaked Lunch is a non-linear, non-plot driven, plural narrative. The text consists of a series of reoccurring character voices and settings (both real and surreal). There is very little continuity as you move from chapter to chapter and there is no overarching plot that appears to be connecting the various stories together. The only character voice that offers some clarity is a junkie from New York named William Lee, who appears to serve as the “main” narrator and an extension of Burroughs himself. Lee’s voice opens and closes the novel; his chapters suggest that the novel is an account of his experience being on and recovering from “junk.” As one might expect from a person on heroin or in the process of withdrawal, his accounts are anything, but straightforward and clear. The accounts that exist between the opening and closing chapters are difficult to follow and understand; they constantly change character voice, setting and writing form. In terms of writing forms, Naked Lunch consists of lists, prose poems, ramblings and “one-act-play routines” – sometimes all within a single short chapter (Miles, El Hombre Invisible, 5). Having been conditioned by the narrative conventions of most literature, the unique structure employed by Burroughs is a difficult adjustment.\n\nHowever, taking a step back and looking at how the structure serves the text as a whole, the intention of Burroughs becomes clear. This complicated and disjointed narrative reflects the consciousness of Burroughs himself. As long-time literary analyst of Burroughs, Barry Miles, explains, “The text is simply a record of the writer’s consciousness at the precise point of writing” (Miles, El Hombre Invisible, 100). In a way, Burroughs is attempting to execute the narrative theory of Gertrude Stein’s “Composition as Explanation,” but in the form of a fictional novel. Through the structure of this narrative, he is attempting to capture the present in his writing through his own consciousness. Burroughs even makes a small reference to one of Stein’s most famous quotes, “Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose” with his own version in Naked Lunch of “A rat is a rat is a rat is a rat” (Burroughs 174). Ultimately, the narrative structure employed by Burroughs requires patience and work on the part the reader to adjust and then decipher and derive meaning from thoughts of his complex consciousness.\n\nIIB. Content: Critique of control\n\nEven with its complicated narrative structure, Naked Lunch still has long list of identifiable themes. One such powerful and reoccurring theme is control; Burroughs explores both internal and external forms of control and illustrates their affects on human behavior.\n\nTwo examples of control scrutinized by Burroughs are drugs (an external force) and sex (an internal force). He uses drugs and sex to examine the psychological and physical dependencies of human beings. In all of his descriptions of these two topics, the controlling nature of the need is the focus. The characters are compelled to satisfy their addictions by any means possible, which often results in revolting and perverse human behavior. Drug use is not portrayed as cool or desirable, but rather as an all-consuming and disgusting need. For example, in one of the first chapters of the text, a junkie using heroin is described as follows, “She seized a safety pin caked with blood and rust, gouged a great hole in her leg which seemed to hang open like an obscene festering mouth waiting for unspeakable congress with the dropper which she now plunged out of sight into the gaping wound” (Burroughs 10). Similarly, sex (both heterosexual and homosexual) is not portrayed as a beautiful or intimate experience between individuals, but rather as a vulgar, repulsive and bestial act. For example, one chapter of the novel called “Hassan’s Rumpus Room,” is dedicated to the description of a Mugwump (a fictional, globular creature without a liver) having violent anal sex with a young boy while the boy is choked to death by a noose (Burroughs 63-64). This is just one of many horrific examples of sexual descriptions, which prove to be some of the most unsettling components of the book. Burroughs uses these extreme depictions of drug-use and sex to emphasize and criticize the psychological and physical dependencies that control human behavior. While the reality of these psychological and physical needs may not be quite as severe as is depicted in Naked Lunch, the powerful and shocking hyperbole utilized by Burroughs is meant to stress the role that forces of control play in affecting human behavior and its limits.\n\nIIC. Function: How might this text affect the reader’s perception of literary art?\n\nWhile the thematic content of Naked Lunch is obviously transgressive for its offensive depictions of sexual acts, vulgar descriptions of drug-use and threatening criticisms of social institutions like government and religion – it is important to recognize how the text is transgressive beyond these ideas. Similar to the experience of analyzing Nabokov’s Lolita, readers should try to determine how the text is transgressive beyond that of its use of pedophilia as a plot vehicle. The truly transgressive nature of both Burroughs’ and Nabokov’s texts is their use of literary art in a profoundly communicative way. Through their texts, these authors expertly invest their readers in the consciousness of another being – William Lee and Humbert Humbert, respectively – by effectively utilizing both the limitation and power of language.\n\nFocusing on Naked Lunch: How is it that a someone can make it through this text? How can someone stand to read its horrifying and confusing passages and yet still find some meaning? Given the iconic status of this novel, Burroughs definitely found a way and it was through his use of language. In Naked Lunch, Burroughs harnesses the persuasive power of literary language to attract readers and pull them into the world he has created, despite its repulsiveness. And yet at the same time, he also utilizes the limitations of language in that the readers only visualize what they themselves allow as they are never physically confronted by any of his exaggerated realities; this gives his ideas the opportunity to be more easily digested. Striking this balance between repulsion and attraction through language is what ultimately allows the complex and harsh ideas of Burroughs to be communicated to the world. Burroughs uses literary art to its fullest extent as a mode of communication. This idea that Naked Lunch is transgressive in its ability to make readers reflect on the communicative powers of the fictional novel is reflected in a quote from Burroughs in a letter to Ginsberg. In this letter, Burroughs describes the fictional setting of “Interzone” in Naked Lunch. Burroughs explains that, “In Interzone, dreams can kill…and solid objects and persons can be as unreal as dreams” (Miles, El Hombre Invisible, 99). Just like the “Interzone,” this text makes the reader re-consider the novel as a medium of communication and recognize its ability to shape reality. Through the repulsive and complex consciousness of his mind in Naked Lunch, Burroughs was able to communicate a vision that inspired a whole generation of thought and art.\n\n-HF\n\nBibliography\n\nBurroughs, William S.
