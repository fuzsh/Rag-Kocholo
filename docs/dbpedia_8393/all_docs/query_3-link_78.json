        "text": "Writer, philosopher, artist, and co-founder of the Beat Generation, William S. Burroughs â who died in 1997 at the age of 83 â continues to be a vital cultural force today. The author of books like Junky , Queer , and Naked Lunch , Burroughs forged the cornerstone of a modern American cultural movement with Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and other visionary writers and artists. His buttoned-up, three-piece exterior cloaked a dark genius that hungered for hustlers and heroin â way back in the 1940s. On February 5, William S. Burroughs would have been 97, but his spirit undoubtedly lives on, with more about him still coming out.\n\nYony Leyserâs documentary William Burroughs: A Man Within is due on DVD February 15, filled with Burroughs rarities and interviews with everyone from John Waters, Laurie Anderson, and Patti Smith to Gus Van Sant, Iggy Pop, and Thurston Moore. Slated to be published this summer, Ah Pook Is Here is a collaboration between William S. Burroughs and artist Malcolm McNeill. The âword/image novelâ predicted the emergence of the ever-popular modern literary genre, the graphic novel. So if you have $260,000 laying around, you could do worse than invest in the William S. Burroughs Word Horde 2.0, considering the potential publishing rights. But for the rest of us, weâll just celebrate by pulling out a big, sweet, flaming sheet-cake of love with words instead of candles, each representing one small piece of Burroughsâ life before he finally succumbed to his biggest obsession: death.\n\n1.

Burroughs met his future common-law wife Joan Vollmer through Jack Kerouac, who was dating her roommate, Edie Parker.\n\nJoan Vollmer\n\n37. The four of them moved in together in 1944.\n\n38.

Right before she was killed, Joan allegedly said, âI canât watch this â you know I canât stand the sight of blood.â\n\n49. The police officially ruled it an accident, and Burroughs never served time for the crime.\n\n50. In his book Queer, Burroughs wrote: âI am forced to the appalling conclusion that I would never have become a writer but for Joanâs death, and to a realization of the extent to which this event has motivated and formulated my writing.â\n\n51.

After it was published in the US in 1962, Naked Lunch was officially declared obscene by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Allen Ginsberg and Norman Mailer testified in defense of the book.\n\nNaked Lunch, 1968 [via]\n\n62. In 1966, courts rejected the obscenity charges against Naked Lunch. The case marked the last major censorship hearing against written literature in America.\n\n63. âI do definitely mean what I say to be taken literally, yes, to make people aware of the true criminality of our times, to wise up to the marks,â Burroughs told an interviewer in 1970.
