Naked Lunch is considered Burroughs' seminal work, and one of the landmark publications in the history of American literature.

It was one of the more recent American books over which an obscenity trial was held. The book was banned in Boston in 1962 due to obscenity (notably child murder and acts of pedophilia), making it among the last works to be banned in that city, but that decision was reversed in 1966 by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The Appeals Court found the book did not violate obscenity statutes, as it was found to have some social value.

Book in very good condition, name to ffep, minor wear to edges, in original dustwrapper in original cover, with some paper loss to rear. Naked Lunch (sometimes The Naked Lunch) is a 1959 novel by American writer William S. Burroughs. The book is structured as a series of loosely connected vignettes, intended by Burroughs to be read in any order.[1] The reader follows the narration of junkie William Lee, who takes on various aliases, from the U.S. to Mexico, eventually to Tangier and the dreamlike Interzone. The vignettes (which Burroughs called \"routines\") are drawn from Burroughs' own experiences in these places and his addiction to drugs: heroin, morphine and, while in Tangier, majoun (a strong hashish confection), as well as a German opioid with the brand name Eukodol (oxycodone), of which he wrote frequently.[2] The novel was included in Time 's \"100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005\".[3] In 1991, David Cronenberg wrote and directed a film of the same name based on the novel and other Burroughs writings.\n\nFirst edition but second issue. Softcover. 225 pages. A paperback original. Burrough's classic book which was the basis for an David Cronenberg directed movie with Peter Weller, Judy Davis, Ian Holms, Roy Scheider and Julian Sands.

A solid example overall of what has become, along with On The Road and Howl, part of the classic beat triangle of books most sought after by collectors.\n\nSoft cover. Condition: Very Good. 1st Edition. Largely written in Tangiers, where Burroughs lived for several years before moving to Paris, The Naked Lunch has strong themes of drug addiction and homosexuality. Loose pages of manuscript had to be rescued by his friends, typed up and placed in some semblance of order before Maurice Girodias, the legendary Parisian owner of the Olympia Press, could be persuaded to publish it as a fitting addition to his successful line of books; books that were viewed by most simply as pornography. While much early pornography seems tame by today's standards The Naked Lunch still has the power to shock. I am offering a copy of the true first printing (with the price shown as Francs 1,500) but with a faded spine and some staining to edges and prelims.\n\nCondition: Very Good. Dust Jacket Condition: Very Good. First edition. A Very Good copy in like dust jacket. Rear free end paper of the book excised and some splitting at the lower inside joint. Dust jacket with some overall age toning and a small chip at the base of the spine. First printing with the green border on the title page and the original publisher's price of 1500 Francs on both the rear cover of the book and the rear flap. No price defacement, stickers or stamps as is usually found on later states of the book and jacket. William S. Burroughs' infamous novel meanders through the absurd and perverse in an improbable, non-linear narrative. While the adventure jumps from fictional dictatorships, to Mexico, to space, much of the book remains inspired by Burroughs' own drug addiction and his friendships with Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, core Beat Generation members. Upon its publication in 1959, \"The Naked Lunch\" was banned from numerous cities though its literary significance was later recognized by Time magazine and the book was included in their Top 100 English speaking novels from 1923 to 2005. Very Good in Very Good dust jacket.\n\nPaperback. Condition: Very Good. 1st Edition. Paris, The Olympia Press, 1955. First Edition. First Impression. Paperback. A very good copy. 1500 Francs to rear flap. A provocative and groundbreaking work that explores the dark underbelly of addiction and society. A cornerstone of the 20th-century counterculture. A little tearing to the top of the spine and light wear to corners and lower tip. A little tanning to the spine. Creasing to the spine. [10911, Hyraxia Books]."
