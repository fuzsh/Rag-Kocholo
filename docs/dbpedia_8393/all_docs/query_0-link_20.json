        "text": "William S. Burroughs\n\nNaked Lunch\n\nFirst hardcover edition of Burroughs magnum opus which was originally published in Paris by Olympia Press in 1959. Surreal, cut-up novel, which consists of a series of vignettes that the author says can be read in any order. Abundance of gratuitous images of sex and drug usage led to delays in the publication of this edition because of obscenity laws. Filmed in 1991 by David Cronenberg with Peter Weller, Judy Davis, Ian Holm and Roy Scheider.\n\nHardcover. First American Edition, First Printing. Octavo, cloth-backed boards. New York: Grove Press, [1962]. #10681.\n\nExcept for a minor binder's flaw to two pages inside (tips of pages folded over), this is a fine copy in a bright nearly fine dust jacket with a 1\" closed tear at rear fold and faint wear to extremities. An excellent copy."
