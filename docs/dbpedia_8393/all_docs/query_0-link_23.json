        "text": "It’s not the best kept secret in the world: the Beat Generation was awesome. Don’t tell me that you haven’t heard of this well-known group of American writers before. They found each other as colleagues in the 1940s – although their success started a decade later. Allen Ginsberg’s Howl (finished 1955, published 1956) as well as Jack Kerouac’s On the Road (finished 1951, published 1957) have recently been turned into a film in respectively 2010 and 2012. What I think of these films will not be discussed – or in short: a hipster historian would say that On the Road is analogue way more enjoyable (with this – wisely keeping secret that I’ve never read Howl). Already less known is the Beat author William Seward Burroughs, nicknamed Bill. His key-novel Naked Lunch was written in 1953-1959 and published that in 1959 for its first time. It was 1991 when Burroughs said in a trailer about Naked Lunch that “Hollywood, in its infinite wisdom, has now turned it into a movie.” – a phrase which triggered my attention recently. I watched the film and for the next two hours, I was stunned.\n\nWhat is it exactly what I like so much about the film Naked Lunch? Well, as far I’m concerned there is no other Hollywood film in which aliens are not being shot. Of course there is E.T. – but he had to hide for a decent US family. In Naked Lunch, an alien can sit in a bar, drinking and smoking without even being stared at. Before seeing Naked Lunch, I wasn’t familiar with typewriters who could talk – and other ones which had to be liquidated. The film provided my in a glass in which the world looked absurd – and made me look different at things. In a more dramatic and pretentious way of saying it: this film changed my philosophy about and view on life. David Cronenberg did a great production – and I thought that the film could be an artwork without further context. Of course, when I figured out the layered historical background of the film somewhat later, I thought of the film as even more enjoyable.\n\nObvs, that is the reason why I write this series of these three articles. The first article will be about the US society and the developments within the Beat Generation. Article #2 will be dedicated to William Burroughs’ time when he wrote Naked Lunch, the content of this novel and its judicial aftermath. In the last article, Cronenberg’s film will be discussed. Will I still consider the film as an artwork now I got to know its background better? Well – that is a question to be answered later. Now it’s time to introduce you to the struggle between the poor literate vanguard writers and the US’ dominant material culture.\n\nWhat to say about the USA after WWII? The USA definitely was the biggest military power within the Western hemisphere, being crucial for giving birth to the NATO in 1949. Therewith, the Americans protected their goal for a continent in which a material American Dream was chased by all. This American Dream wasn’t only a promise that everyone could become millionaire if you work hard enough. Moreover, it’s also a harmonious view on the society – the world should basically be shaped after Disney Land. Its view on humanity was one in which the civilians would have a high level of individual responsibility. If you didn’t choose to be civil obedient, you wouldn’t end up as a millionaire in this Disney Land. The biggest threat for this American Dream came from the Soviet Union, although there were also communists within the USA itself. During the Red Scare (±1950-1956), the Republican senator McCarthy effectively expelled communists from key-positions in the American society. That this included a certain sense of paranoia towards its own civilians – and without a doubt lead to unguilty victims, it was the ‘free’ Americans let happen.\n\nThe Beats had other views on filling in this individual liberty. For them, not the battle between world’s two major ideologies stood central, but their self-being. Choice was not a matter of becoming rich and follow the American Dream. It was about the types of experiments you would be interested at – such as with drugs and forms of sexuality. These experiments and experiences were considered to be important, because they may reveal a new part which was in you already. For reasons like these, the Beats were not material but rather spiritual – and they lived life till the maximum. After your self-being, there were your fellow- Beat friends. In the poems and novel of the Beats, remarkably often is referred to their own circle of friends. In Kerouac’s On the Road, Old Bull Lee is the personification to William – Jane is Joan’s, while Carlo Marx refers to Allen Ginsberg. That the real-life hunger for drugs, thrill and adventure lead the Beats to small criminality was taken for granted by them – or even encouraged. The Beats were after all not in good harmony with the American society.\n\nWilliam Burroughs was born in 1914, where an upper-middle class in Saint Louis (Missouri). Living up to the American Dream, he went to Harvard to study English and anthropology when he was 18. He disliked the ‘fake English public school’ and the dull town. When a certain college friend named Richard Stern introduced him to the homosexual subcultures in NYC’s districts Harlem and Greenwich Village, William felt more bothered. After he finished his Bachelor in 1936, William made a Grand Tour through Europe. He enjoyed the homosexual circles in Hungary and Vienna, where he attended medical courses for a short while. Moreover, Burroughs kept an eye on the developments of Nazi Germany. In 1937, he married Ilse Herzfeld Klapper – a jewish girlfriend of his. This gave her allowance to emigrate into the USA. Back in Harvard and NYC, Burroughs had a homosexual relation. Burroughs developed a certain insanity, cutting of the top of his left little finger, and went to a psychiatrist. During WWII – Burroughs was not accepted as an intelligence agent or a jarhead. In the fall of 1942, he moved to Chicago. He worked here as an exterminator and started using heroin. A year later, he moved to NYC’s bohemian district of Greenwich Village. In the following year he would meet Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg – and the ‘Beat troika‘ was complete. The term Beat Generation was invented by Kerouac in 1948 – while Burroughs and Kerouac wrote ‘And the Hippos were boiled in their tanks’ in 1945 already. Perhaps it’s typical for the Beats that this novel wasn’t published before 2008. Within his company, Burroughs was the most educated so far. He would provide his fellow-writers in books from inspirational writers such as Arthur Rimbaud, Jonathan Swift and Oswald Spengler. Burroughs continued reading other authors -Jack Black, Dashiell Hammet and Raymond Chandler- himself.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Burroughs started living together with Joan Vollmer in 1944. Although Burroughs had a homosexual life and was not attracted to women at all -he even looked down on them in a sexist way- the charismatic Joan was just the right partner for him. She was an attractive, cynical and adventurous college girl in her early twenties. The couple got heavily involved in the drugs scene around Times Square and Greenwich Village. One can think off a mixture of benzedrine, amphetamines, heroin, alcohol and marijuana. In October 1946, the couple moved from NYC to Eastern Texas. This doesn’t mean that they stopped their chemical habits. Even when Joan was pregnant and gave birth in June 1947, the couple used the drugs. Given that Joan was an amphetamine addicted and William cropping and harvesting marijuana – they were not the most responsible parents.\n\nThe young couple and their baby moved to New Orleans in 1948, where William became seriously addicted again. In September 1949, they traded New Orleans for Mexico City because William was on the run for the police again. In Mexico City, Burroughs wrote most of his two earliest novels Junkie and Queer – although they were not published before respectively 1953 and 1985. The relationship between William and Joan was everything except romantic anymore: Joan’s benzedrine and tequila habits through the day drove her into insanity, while William was ‘off junk’ since the spring of 1951. In September 1951, William made a mistake which would leave the biggest stamp during his life. Being heavily drunk in the early evening of September 6th, 1951 – William was challenged by Joan to play Wilhelm Tell. She putted a an empty glass above her head – joking “I can’t look: you know I can’t stand the sight Of blood!’ while William aimed at the glass and shot. While Joan lay on the floor – the glass didn’t break. “I think your bullet has hit her, Bill” – said one of Williams friends. William was held in the Mexican prison only for thirteen days, after a court concluded that this mistake was an unfortunate ‘criminal imprudence’. Nevertheless, he held himself responsible for this mistake. According to himself, he wouldn’t have broken through as an author if this act never occurred. It is no surprise that this act comes back a few times throughout Burroughs’ oeuvre, as well as in Naked Lunch.\n\nIn January 1953, Burroughs traded Mexico City for a seven-month long trip throughout South America. He was financially supported by his parents, who also took care of his son. It is likely that William’s parents wouldn’t do so it they knew that their son was looking for ‘Yage’ – a highly hallucinative plant. Through a series of letters with Allen Ginsberg, this trip is well documented and published in 1963 (The Yage Letters). Perhaps it was during his South American adventure that Burroughs started to feel attracted to Ginsberg, after knowing each other for about nine years. Burroughs thought of Ginsberg as much more adult and educated as in the 1940s. When Burroughs moved back to the USA, his love for Ginsberg was unanswered. As a result, Burroughs left America for Rome (Italy) and Tangier (Morocco) – which I will widen out in article #2. Burroughs feeling for talent turned out to be right: Ginsberg would make a major success with his poem Howl – which was published in 1956. This poem can still be seen as characteristic for the Beat Generation. In Howl, many fellow-Beats were figures in the poem – so did Burroughs. Moreover, drugs and homosexuality were two of the themes in Howl – for some civil obedient and square Americans a reason to accuse it for obscenity. This ‘Howl Obscenity Trial’ was decided in in 1957, the California State Superior Court declared that Howl had a ‘redeeming social importance’ and was not too obscene for being sold or confiscated. The result of this trial was a first step towards a USA without open censorship. Moreover, Howl became a celebrated literate work which is published in new editions up till recent days.\n\nIn this first article about William Burroughs, the US society is described, the Beats are introduced & William Burroughs’ life is widened out. The struggle of the Beats against the material mainstream was mainly a battle of the hip against the squares. The Beats lived till the maximum – living the life YOLO already. Of course, the Beats had the shady side of behaving irresponsible concerning their offspring’s luck & their personal health – as Joan found out on September 6th 1951. The drawback of this lifestyle provided the Beats in material for novels – which they worked on many years before they were published. For the Beat Generation, many years of a bohemian life without a career or serious money passed by, before Allen Ginsberg broke through as the first Beat in 1956. Jack Kerouac’s On the Road would follow one year later. Also, the third Beat from the Troika was working in Tangier on its masterwork. In the meanwhile, the Burroughs family planned to build own skyscraper in NYC. The 163 meter high Burroughs Building would be finished in 1963. Being most of his time a drug addict in his fourties – William Burroughs personifies the failure of the American Dream and the destiny of being Beat perhaps even more than other authors.\n\nIn the next article will be about the timespan 1953-1966. This is the period in which William Burroughs wrote his novel Naked Lunch and won the trials which tried to censor it."
