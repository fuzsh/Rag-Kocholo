        "text": "If you like the great outdoors and want to give your body and eyes a treat, put Denmark’s ‘Fjordmino’ Route on your must-experience list. It’s ideal for both cyclists and hikers and would be a great way to help forget the stresses of 2020.\n\nThe Fjordmino Route will not be officially opened until next year. However, even though it’s not ‘officially’ open, you’ll get a good idea of what you can experience on the route in this article. And as the air-bridge between Denmark and the UK is currently still in place, and if you’re not weighed down with responsibilities and obligations, we can’t see any reason why you shouldn’t try some or all of the Fjordmino Route now!\n\nIf we’re completely honest, you don’t actually need to head overseas to clear your mind and reset your body; you’ve probably got some incredible places on your doorsteps where you can do this. But, heading overseas always has that special ‘Je ne sais quoi’, it’s like a personal reward, and if you can fill your lungs with some of the cleanest air, see some amazing natural beauty while experiencing new culture and history, it’s so much better.\n\nWhat is the Fjordmino Route?\n\nThe Fjordmino Route is a perfect way to explore the beauty of Denmark and takes you through the incredibly scenic, but lesser-known region of south-east Jutland, which is known as the coastal land. It’s a 52km circular route and ideal for hikers and cyclists and is just a 40-minute drive from Aarhus and Billund airports.\n\nThe route takes you around the Horsens Fjord, through forests, along beaches, across fields, through the small towns of Horsens, Odder and Hedensted before taking you back to the quaint coastal town of Horsens. You can find a more detailed description of the Fjordmino Route on Google Maps here.\n\nIsland hopping\n\nThere’s an indescribable thrill to visiting an island, and the Fjordmino Route gives you not one, but four opportunities to do this, two on the route and two more, closeby. At the entrance to the Horsens Fjord are two islands named Alrø and Hjarnø. Access to both islands is simple as they are served by a ferry service which can hold twelve passengers and their bikes.\n\nAlrø Island\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, history and culture is a great way to take your mind off things, and Alrø has this by the bucket-load. It’s said that the island has been inhabited since the stone age, and for the beady-eyed among you, it’s still possible to find stone-age remains at the southern tip of the island.\n\nThere’s also an opportunity to sample local fayre including a colossal version of the country’s traditional ‘Tarteletter’ which is a pastry dish made from local chicken and asparagus. All you need to do is head to café Alrø to give your tastebuds a well-deserved treat.\n\nHjarnø Island\n\nHjarnø Island is located south of Alrø and has an equally fascinating history. The route across the island allows you to experience stunning forests on the northern part of the island. On the eastern side are dramatic cliffs, an ideal place to take some gorgeous photos, or if you crave something a little more serene, how about a walk amongst the meadows?\n\nAccommodation options\n\nIf you’re flagging after experiencing all this natural beauty, you’ll be pleased to know that overnight accommodation is available on Hjarnø Island via camping grounds or holiday apartments. Alternatively, you can head to the nearby coastal town of Juelsminde which is a 15km detour from the route (a short ride if you’re doing it by bike). Here you’ll find a town centre, beaches and a scenic marina all within a short walk (or cycle) from each other.\n\nHorsens – Things to see and do\n\nOnce you’ve completed the Fjordmino Route, you’ll find yourself back in the town of Horsens. If you’re planning to extend your stay in the best possible way, an ideal place is the Jørgensens Hotel which is located in the centre of the town and has recently re-opened following a major refurbishment. The hotel was formerly a palace and can trace its roots back to 1744. It is both elegant and modern and benefits from a stylish restaurant and a subterranean wine bar.\n\nAs you’re here in Horsens, it would be rude not to experience some of its amazing history and culture. Places we’d recommend you must pay a visit to include the Prison Museum. The prison is a true eye-opener and holds many tales of its infamous inmates and all of the escape attempts, including those who succeeded.\n\nIf you’re after a culture top-up, the Horsens Kunstmuseum (Horsens Museum of Modern Art) is a must-visit. Here you’ll find a whole room devoted to its renowned home-grown artist, Michael Kvium.\n\nAny short break is never complete without a large number of photographs to remind you of your amazing experience, and one place you shouldn’t miss taking your camera to is the Sugar Loaf (Sukkertoppen). This is one of Denmark’s highest points and sits 180 metres above sea level.\n\nSugar Loaf looks over the Gudenåen; this is Denmark’s longest river and offers a number of exciting outdoor activities. If the mood takes you, we’d suggest you give the canoeing a try.\n\nEndelave island, the land of the rabbits\n\nSome of you might have heard of Ōkunoshima island in Japan, which is home to thousands of rabbits, well Denmark has something similar too. Endelave in the Kattegat sea is a place where there are more rabbits than people living on the island. The walking route on the island is even called the ‘Kaninoen’ (Kanin is the Danish word for rabbit) and takes you along the island’s beautiful coastline and across its stunning landscapes.\n\nThe final island we would suggest you visit is Tunø. To experience this island fully, you might consider hiring a bike and take it with you on the ferry. If you don’t want to hire one, not a problem as the island has its very own taxi service, which is a tractor cum taxi!\n\nYou can also stay on the island at the former dairy which has been converted into a guest house. This would be a great way to end your experience of the Fjordmino Route. Imagine sitting out on the terrace, enjoying a home-cooked meal made from local produce, taking in the views over the water and the sandy beaches which are just a few metres away; it would be a perfect end to a memorable break.\n\nFjordmino Route – Where and how?\n\nIf you’re in the UK, experiencing the Fjordmino Route is quite straightforward. Currently, British Airways is proving flights from Heathrow to Billund and Ryanair is offering flights to\n\nAarhus and Billund from Stanstead and to Billund from Manchester, The prices start from £19.99\n\nFor further travel information and things to do while on the Fjordmino Route, visit Denmark’s official tourism website www.visitdenmark.com."
