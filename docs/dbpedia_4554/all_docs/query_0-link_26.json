Completing a full set of altar pieces can take years of work.\n\nBelow is a chronological overview of Churchsilver by Scharff.\n\n1998\n\nAdvent Evangelical Lutheren Church of Zionsville\n\nStory: Scharff received a call from Pastor John Fiene, who asked if he could find the time to create a chalice which the pastor could give to his church in memory of his father and his father in law, both of whom had been leaders of the Lutheran Church in America. Pastor John later told Scharff that in his quest for the right expression on the internet, he had chosen Scharff's website as No. 1\n\nIn 2002 the chalice was nominated for LCEF Ecclesiastical Art Award, which it won. Scharff was invited to the award ceremony\n\nin L.A. where he received the award and the applause of the 600 attending guests.\n\nThe job consisted of a chalice, two candlesticks and a pantene.\n\n1992\n\nKlostermarkskirken\n\nStory:A brand new church by architect Keld Wohlert was built by the slope down towards the river in the southwestern part of Ringsted. Naja Salto woven a 10 m2 large tapestry for the wall behind the protruding altar. When Naja's motive on the tapestry was with a flying flock of pigeons, Scharff suggested to let some of the pigeons land on the altar, made ​​of silver, crafted in postures that made them suitable for the church services.\n\nThe job consisted of: a chalice, a wine jug, a pantene and pantene.\n\n1991\n\nSandby Kirke\n\n1987-92\n\nTjæreborg Kirke\n\nStory:Scharff had the pleasure to shape and craft all the silver for the beautiful old church in Tjæreborg parish, which contains one of the most beautiful epitaph in Denmark.\n\nThe job consisted of a baptize pitcher in brass, a baptismal font,baptismal basin. In addition, a wine jug, a chalice etc.\n\n1985\n\nGjern Kirke\n\nThe job consisted of a pantene and achalice\n\n1976\n\nEndelave Kirke"
