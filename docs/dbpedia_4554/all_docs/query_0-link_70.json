Thus, we will not have a reception or store, and check-in and check-out must be made on your computer at home or at one of our self-service check-in terminals upon arrival. We are establishing a brand new service building with new toilets and kitchen facilities as well as a very nice living room. Everything is expected to be ready at the beginning of April 2019.\n\nOur new website was launched in January.\n\n2017 Our large barbecue cabin has been closed at the top and the bottom in order to minimise draught. We have made a new barbecue place with 3 Weber kettle grills at the barbecue cabin, which the campsite guests are free to use."
