        "text": "Who doesn’t love a good print? They add personality to a look and keep the compliments coming. But with so much on offer during summer, how do you pick the right print for you? We’ve made things as uncomplicated as possible by producing a concise range of high quality prints that can be found across many different garments. Less is more.\n\nAnd if you’re preoccupied with the potential environmental impacts of prints, fear not. TWOTHIRDS uses digital printing techniques (PLUS: amazing eco-friendly fabrics) to eliminate toxic waste or wastewater runoff. We take the “print” out of “footprint”.\n\nFor the latest sustainable prints made for sipping cocktails by the pool - or bringing the beach to the office - peruse our list below!\n\nBig Palms\n\nPalms are emblematic of some of the world’s best beach cities, from Miami to our hometown of Barcelona. Not only this but also the tried and tested surf spots we associate with big waves. We love the emotions palm prints evoke - bringing an instant hit of holiday vibes. Our bigger palm leaf prints strike the right balance between “busy” and “minimal”, with some styles showing an ecru base, and others a greener aloe vera hue that leaves you feeling suitably refreshed! If you look closely you’ll see that these prints are more detailed than they first appear - with varying shades of green producing a 3-D, lifelike effect that practically shimmers in the sunlight!\n\nStyle Highlights\n\nMavor Swim. A beautiful bikini combo made in a quick-drying recycled fabric. Don’t miss: the playful knot on the front and the high-rise bottoms that are perfect for surfers.\n\nSamama Shirt. Queen of summer, the Samama comes in a smart poplin fabric (only seen on the best quality shirts), vegan buttons, and a cropped cut. The palm print truly shines here.\n\nPremuda Shorts. Ever felt envious of the men who can strut their stuff in easy-to-wear boardshorts?! Well, these palm printed shorts provide the answer. Lovingly designed with an elastic waistband, side pockets and vibrant whale embroidery at the bottom. In GRS certified recycled polyester.\n\nMini Palms\n\nIf you prefer understated, quietly confident prints, we’ve got your back too! You’ll spot a very special palm tree print in our latest women’s collection, composed of Duck Green and Desert Sage colours. Showing palms swaying in the breeze, this mini palm print will be a beautiful Barcelona-themed addition to your summer wardrobe.\n\nStyle Highlights\n\nWajag dress. A wrap dress that feels effortlessly cool in the summer heat, this design is elegant, refined, and the envy of all. With simple belt closure.\n\nDid you know? There are more than 2,500 palm tree species in the world! This diversity is what makes every palm tree so weirdly wonderful. Even writing this from our luminous office in the hills of Barcelona, we can see several palms waving through the window. No surprise that we decided to include them in our new collection!\n\nWaves\n\nYou might not think of waves when you first see our next summer print. But this design is inspired by all the colours of the ocean, from pink coral through to orange starfish and navy blue. There are no straight lines on this print, with our preference being to show the fluidity and movement of the waves as they strike the shore.\n\nStyle Highlights\n\nSverdrup dress. Cut to maxi length for maxi-mum style, the Sverdrup features thin spaghetti straps and is made from an eco-friendly form of viscose. It looks dazzling on a summer’s day.\n\nEndelave top. For a more versatile look you can opt for the wave print in a top version. A design that embodies spring/summer energy. Pair it with your favourite pair of shorts or jeans!\n\nGeometric\n\nIf you’ve been following our men’s print releases, you’ll know that this year is the summer of shapes. That extends to our swimwear which features a funky geometric pattern, made of circles, squares and triangles in varying shades of green. Menswear to swear by this summer.\n\nStyle Highlight\n\nRah boardshorts. Lightweight, flexible and without any abrasive linings, these boardshorts feel awesome in and out of the water. Made from supple recycled polyester and elastane, they’ll be the talk of the town when you wear them this summer.\n\nDaisy Green\n\nIf you are looking for an eye-catching print for your swimwear this summer, you’ll find it in the form of one of our favourite summer styles. Featuring a playful floral print that harks back to the 60s, in a decidedly modern cut.\n\nStyle Highlight\n\nOnotoa top and bottom. Comfy swimwear that provides extra coverage in all the right places. This delightful print is green in every sense."
