Thank you!\n\nJust as described! Great quality of a shirt. Fit just right. Material is comfortable.\n\nIn retailer shirts & dresses the petites usually fit me better, i'm short, but this regular fit well. looks super cute, i've gotten so many compliments on it. comfortable material.\n\nI just got this in the mail the other day. i was really excited and then crushed. too bad but not what i wanted. will keep it anyway, it can be used"
