        "text": "Steam News - Alden\n\nWith thousands of playable demos launching on Steam every year, and millions of players trying them out (often as part of Steam Next Fest), we've noticed some trends in feedback from both developers and players about the process and functionality. We've put together an update based on that feedback.\n\nAs a reminder, you can always find great demos to play on the Steam demo hub.\n\nDemos now behave better in the Steam library\n\nWe've made a few updates to how demos appear and behave within the Steam Library. Here are the key items:\n\nYou can add demos to your library without having to immediately install them. Just click on the new \"add to library\" button next to demos you may not be ready to install (while using the mobile app, for instance).\n\nDemos can be installed even if you already own the full game. Primarily, this will make it easier for developers to test demos, but it will also help players more easily manage installing/uninstalling demos.\n\nDemos can be explicitly removed from an account by right-clicking > manage > remove from account.\n\nWhen a demo is uninstalled, it will automatically get removed from your library.\n\nDemos can now have a separate store page\n\nBy default, free demos appear as a button on the full game's store page. But, developers have been asking for a way to enable a full store page to better describe the contents of the demo, add separate screenshots, upload a trailer, and specify supported features. So, that is now possible and you'll find that clicking on a demo sometimes loads a full demo store page while other times will take you to the full game's page with a button to install the demo.\n\nTight connection with the full game\n\nStand-alone demo store pages will automatically display both the demo install button as well as a widget linking back to the full game for players interested in wishlisting or purchasing the full game.\n\nUser reviews for demos\n\nIf developers have chosen to enable a store page for their demo, it will also be possible for players of the demo to post user reviews for the demo. These reviews and review score will appear on the demo store page just like reviews for any other free game on Steam. Note that if the developer has chosen to not have a separate store page for their demo, then user reviews will not be enabled for that demo.\n\nDemos now appear more in the Steam store\n\nDemos now behave more like free games and can appear in all the same sections and lists. For example, demos can now appear on the Steam homepage in charts such as the \"New & Trending\", on the \"New on Steam\" page, and on relevant tag and category pages. We've also made some changes to the thresholds for free products to appear in those sections to better balance them with paid products.\n\nOf course you can always find great demos to play on the Steam demo hub.\n\nWishlist notifications when demos become available\n\nWe've now also made it so that when a demo becomes available for the first time for a game that you have on your Steam wishlist, or from a developer you follow, Steam can send you an email and mobile notification about that demo.\n\nYou can opt in or out of these emails by updating your email preferences.\n\nInfrequently Asked Questions\n\nQ. What is the deal with the Demo icon? Is that a plate? A vinyl record?\n\nA. That classic icon, my friend, is from the days when demos were commonly distributed through the post office, contained in a bound package of game journalism printed on dead trees and imprinted on circular media known as Compact Discs.\n\nQ. Some demos just appeared in my Steam library. How did those get there?\n\nA. We've made some changes to visibility of demos in the Steam Library, which may effect demos that you played long ago. We've tried our best to clean up the demos that we expect you don't care about anymore, but we may have missed some. You can easily remove those by right-clicking them in your Steam library and selecting manage > remove from account.\n\nQ. I love free demos. When is the next Steam Next Fest?\n\nA. Check back on October 14th for the next weeklong Steam Next Fest, featuring hundreds of new free playable demos! You can sign up for a reminder by visiting the Next Fest page now: https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest"
