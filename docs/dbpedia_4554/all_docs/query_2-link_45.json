        "text": "CHAPTER I:\n\nGENERAL ELECTIONS AND REFERENDUMS\n\nPart 1\n\nFranchise and Eligibility\n\n1.-(1) Franchise for the Folketing is held by every person of Danish nationality, who is above 18 years of age, and permanently resides in the realm, provided that such person has not been declared incapable of conducting his or her own affairs.\n\n2.-(1) Persons who are employed by the Danish State and assigned to duty outside the realm shall be considered to be permanently resident in the realm. The same applies to persons employed with the Greenland Self-Government and assigned to duty outside the realm.\n\n(2) The following persons who have taken up temporary residence in foreign countries shall also be considered to be permanently resident in the realm:\n\n(i) persons being sent out in foreign service as employees of a Danish public agency or any local private undertaking or association;\n\n(ii) persons taking up residence in foreign countries as employees of an international organisation of which Denmark is a member;\n\n(iii) persons being sent out to do service in foreign countries by a Danish relief organisation;\n\n(iv) persons staying abroad for the purpose of education;\n\n(v) persons staying abroad for health reasons;\n\n(vi) persons staying abroad and who, with respect to affiliation with the realm, must be quite co-equal with the persons specified in paragraphs (i) to (v).\n\n(3) Persons taking up residence in foreign countries shall also be considered to be permanently resident in the realm if they intend to return to the realm within two years of their departure.\n\n(4) Any person co-habiting at the same address with a person comprised by subsections (1), (2) or (3) shall be considered to be permanently resident in the realm if the co-habiting partners concerned-\n\n(i) have married or entered into a registered partnership with each other, or\n\n(ii) fulfil the conditions of marrying each other and had set up joint residence before departure.\n\n3.-(1) No one shall exercise the right to vote except if included in the electoral register.\n\n4.-(1) Any person who is entitled to vote at Folketing elections under section 1, see section 2, shall be eligible for membership of the Folketing, unless he or she has been convicted of an act which in the eyes of the public makes him or her unworthy of being a Member of the Folketing, see sections 30 and 33 of the Act of the Constitution.\n\n(2) A person can nevertheless always stand as candidate in an election regardless of objections in respect of non-eligibility.\n\n5.-(1) No one can stand as candidate in an election unless he himself or she herself has announced his or her candidature in the election.\n\n6.-(1) Members of the Folketing are elected for four years. The existing seats in the Folketing shall, however, be vacated upon a new election, see section 32 of the Act of the Constitution.\n\n(2) General elections are called by royal public notice, to be held on the same day throughout the realm. The High Commissioners in the Faroe Islands and in Greenland can be entrusted to fix another day for holding the election.\n\nPart 2\n\nElectoral Districts and Polling Districts.\n\nLocal Distribution of Seats\n\n7.-(1) A total of 179 members, two of which in the Faroe Islands and two of which in Greenland, are to be elected for the Folketing.\n\n(2) Rules for elections in the Faroe Islands and in Greenland are laid down in separate acts.\n\n8.-(1) Denmark falls into three provinces: Metropolitan Copenhagen, Sealand-Southern Denmark and Northern and Central Jutland, cf the Schedule to the Act (List of Electoral Districts).\n\n(2) The regions are subdivided into multimember constituencies, cf the List of Electoral Districts. Metropolitan Copenhagen encompasses four multimember constituencies. Sealand-Southern Denmark and Northern and Central Jutland are each made up of three multimember constituencies.\n\n(3) The multimember constituencies are split into nomination districts, cf the List of Electoral Districts.\n\n(4) A nomination district consists of one or more municipalities or a part of a municipality. For nomination districts consisting of more than one municipality or a part of a municipality, the common functions are carried out by the municipality identified as a constituency municipality in the List of Electoral Districts.\n\n(5) The Minister for the Interior and Health can issue an executive order for minor adjustments to the List of Electoral Districts.\n\n(6) The Minister for the Interior and Health can issue an executive order for changes to the List of Electoral Districts in maintaining the necessary subdivision of electoral districts independent of any changes in subdivisions of municipalities or parishes.\n\n9.-(1) Each municipality or part of a municipality in a nomination district is subdivided into polling districts. A municipality or part of a municipality, however, can constitute one polling district. The local council makes decisions regarding the setting up, alteration or closing down of polling districts.\n\n10.-(1) Of the nationwide 175 seats, 135 are constituency seats and 40 are compensatory seats. The distribution of seats among regions and among multimember constituencies are determined and announced by the Minister for the Interior and Health following publication of the population figure as at January 1st 2010, 2015, 2020, etc., and the distribution subsequently applies to the following elections.\n\n(2) The distribution is fixed proportional to numbers, which for each region and each multimember constituency are computed as the sum of: 1) the population; 2) the number of voters in the last general election; and 3) the area in square kilometres multiplied by 20, of the appropriate region or multimember constituency, respectively. If the number of seats resulting from the distribution are not integers and, therefore, do not add up to the necessary number of seats when fractions are eliminated, the largest fractions shall be increased until the number has been reached (the method of the largest remainders). If two or more fractions are of equal size, lots shall be drawn.\n\n(3) According to the computation rule in subsection (2), the 175 seats are first distributed among the three regions. Next, the 135 constituency seats are distributed accordingly among the regions. Finally, the constituency seats are distributed among the multimember constituencies within the appropriate regions.\n\n(4) If, by computation according to subsection (3), the Multimember Constituency of Bornholm fails to obtain at least two seats, a second distribution of seats shall be under-taken in which the Multimember Constituency of Bornholm is allocated two seats in advance. The remaining 133 constituency seats shall be finally distributed among the other multimember constituencies as specified in subsection (3).\n\n(5) The number of compensatory seats for allocation to each region shall be computed as the difference between the overall number of seats in the region and the number of constituency seats in the region.\n\nPart 3\n\nParties Entitled to Participate in General Elections\n\n11.-(1) The parties which gained representation in the Folketing in the last general election and which continue to be represented therein, shall be entitled to participate in general elections.\n\n(2) The right of participation in general elections also extends to new parties for which an application for registration has been filed with the Minister for the Interior and Health under the rules of sections 12 to 12b.\n\n(3) Parties which are entitled to participate in general elections shall hereinafter be referred to as parties entitled to nomination.\n\n11a.-(1) In order to change the name of a party which is entitled to participate in elections, see section 11, prior approval is required from the Election Board, see section 17. An application to this effect must be signed by the chairman of the party's national organisation and submitted to the Election Board. No decision under the first sentence can be made by the Election Board in the period from the day when the general election is called until and including election day. Any approval granted by the Election Board under the first sentence will be valid for as long as the party is entitled to participate in elections.\n\n(2) If the name of a party which is entitled to participate in elections to the Danish Parliament as well as to the European Parliament is changed, the name change will apply for both elections. The name can only be changed if the name change can apply for both elections.\n\n12.-(1) New parties aiming to participate in general elections must apply for registration with the Minister for the Interior and Health by noon 15 days prior to election day. The application must be accompanied by declarations from a number of voters corresponding to at least one in every 175 valid votes cast in the last general election. The declarations required to accompany the application must be registered as voter declarations for that party using the digital system made available to voters by the Minister for the Interior and Health under the first sentence of subsection (6). No voter declarations are required in order to apply for registration of the party of the German minority.\n\n(2) Before a new party commences the collection of voter declarations under the second sentence of subsection (1), the name of the party must be approved by the Election Board, see section 17. The approval is valid for three years as from the date of the approval. An application for approval of the name of a new party whose name cannot be approved, see section 13, can be filed no earlier than 30 days prior to the expiry of the period in which the name cannot be approved.\n\n(3) A person entitled to vote in general elections can have no more than one party name approved under the first sentence of subsection (2). When filing an application for approval of a name for a party aiming to participate in general elections, the application form issued by the Ministry of the Interior and Health must be used. The application must state the name and CPR number of the applicant, the name and CPR number of any representative nominated by the applicant and contact details of the party. The Minister for the Interior and Health shall register the party name approved as soon as possible using the digital system made available to voters by the Minister for the Interior and Health under the first sentence of subsection (6). The Minister for the Interior and Health shall announce the full name of the holder of an approved party name or of a representative nominated by the holder as well as contact details of the party.\n\n(4) Upon request, the Election Board can extend the period of approval of a party name by one year as from the expiry of the previous period of approval if there is reason to believe that an application for registration of the party will be filed within such extended period. Extensions can be granted more than once in special cases. A request for extension must be filed on or before the day of the expiry of the previous approval, unless exceptional circumstances prevail. If a request for extension of an approval is filed on or before the day of the expiry of the previous approval, the approval will be maintained until a decision has been made as to whether to grant the request.\n\n(5) If no application has been filed for registration of a party within the stipulated period of approval of the name of the party, including any extended period, see subsections (2) and (4), the person whose application for approval of the party name was granted can only apply for approval of the same party name when one year has elapsed since the day when the period of the previous approval expired. Even when one year has not elapsed since the day when the previous period of approval expired, the person whose application for approval of the party name was granted can file an application for approval of the same party name if others cannot be granted approval of the party name under the rules of section 13(1)(ii) and (v) and (2).\n\n(6) When submitting voter declarations, voters must use a digital system made available directly to voters by the Minister for the Interior and Health, but see subsection (7). Voters can submit voter declarations only if they have provided proof of their identity using the digital system, but see subsection (7). A voter declaration can be registered using the digital system only if the voter can submit a valid voter declaration under subsections (8) to (10). Voter declarations are valid only if registered in the digital system.\n\n(7) Notwithstanding the second sentence of subsection (6), voters registered in the Civil Registration System (CPR) and exempt from the mandatory requirement to set up a Digital Post account according to rules made in pursuance of section 5(1) of the Act on Digital Post from Public Issuers (lov om Digital Post fra offentlige afsendere) can submit voter declarations to the Minister for the Interior and Health on a paper form approved by the Minister for the Interior and Health. Notwithstanding the second sentence of subsection (6), voters falling within the scope of section 2 and included in the electoral register can submit voter declarations to the Minister for the Interior and Health on a paper form approved by the Minister for the Interior and Health. Any voter declaration submitted under the first or second sentence hereof must include the information required on the paper form, including the voter's name and CPR number, and must be dated and signed by the voter. The Minister for the Interior and Health shall then register the voter declaration in the digital system made available by the Minister for the Interior and Health under the first sentence of subsection (6). The third and fourth sentences of subsection (6) apply accordingly.\n\n(8) At the time when a declaration is registered in the digital system, the voter must meet the conditions for entitlement to vote in general elections.\n\n(9) A voter can submit a valid voter declaration under subsection (6) only if that voter has submitted a statement of support for the party at least seven days prior to the submission of the voter declaration using the digital system and has provided proof of his or her identity when submitting that statement of support. A voter can submit a valid voter declaration under subsection (7) only if that voter has asked the Minister for the Interior and Health for a paper form for submitting a voter declaration under subsection (7) at least seven days prior to the submission of the voter declaration.\n\n(10) A voter declaration is valid for a period of 18 months from the date of its registration in the digital system. However, a voter declaration is valid only for as long as the approval of the party name remains in force, see subsections (2) and (4). Any voter is entitled to withdraw his or her declaration, but only until the time when an application is filed for registration of the party. Subsequently, the voter declaration is no longer valid. If the party has filed an application for registration of the party with the Minister for the Interior and Health and the voter declaration is valid as set out in the first to fourth sentences hereof at the time of application for registration, such voter declaration will remain valid for the duration of the validity of the application for registration of the party, see subsection (11). No voter can submit a declaration for the same or another party for the duration of the validity of his or her voter declaration as set out in the first to fifth sentences hereof. A voter declaration will remain registered in the digital system for the duration of the validity of his or her voter declaration as set out in the first to fifth sentences hereof. A voter declaration which is no longer valid under the first to fifth sentences hereof will be deleted from the digital system, and any paper form used for submitting that voter declaration will be destroyed.\n\n(11) The registration of a party is valid until the next general election, but always at least for 18 months from the date of application for registration. For the duration of the period of valid registration of a party, the party cannot cancel its registration or file a new application for registration of the party.\n\n(12) Even when the registration of a party is still valid under subsection (11), it is possible for any such party with a valid registration under subsection (1) to have its name approved by the Election Board, see subsection (2), for the purpose of a new collection of voter declarations. Such approval can be extended as set out in the rules of subsection (4). A party can only start a new collection of voter declarations if so approved by the Election Board.\n\n(13) Voter declarations collected for the purpose of filing an application for registration of a new party aiming to participate in general elections, see subsection (1), cannot be used for any other purposes.\n\n(14) The Minister for the Interior and Health shall announce continuously in the digital system the number of voter declarations submitted for each individual party.\n\n12a.-(1) In case of violation of section 12c or other aggravated or repeated statutory violations committed in connection with a party's collection of voter declarations, the Election Board can decide at the request of the Minister for the Interior and Health to exclude such party from the right to continue its collection of voter declarations and to cancel the party's collection of voter declarations for the purpose of filing an application for registration of the party for general elections and European Parliament elections. A decision made by the Election Board under the first sentence hereof will apply for the remainder of the period(s) that the party name has been approved as the name of a new party participating in general elections and European Parliament elections.\n\n(2) In case of a reasonable suspicion of violation of section 12c or other aggravated or repeated statutory violations committed in connection with a party's collection of voter declarations, the Election Board can decide at the request of the Minister for the Interior and Health to temporarily exclude such party from the right to continue its collection of voter declarations for the purpose of an investigation to be conducted by the Election Board as to whether there is reason to make a decision under the first sentence of subsection (1). A decision made by the Election Board under the first sentence hereof will apply until the Election Board has made a decision under the first sentence of subsection (1), or until the Election Board has decided to discontinue the investigation.\n\n(3) A party shall submit and provide the information and documents, including the voter declarations, requested by the Election Board for the purpose of a decision under the first sentence of subsection (1) or the first sentence of subsection (2). If a party disregards its duties under the first sentence hereof, the Election Board can decide to temporarily exclude such party from the right to continue its collection of voter declarations until the party has fulfilled its obligation under the first sentence hereof.\n\n(4) If a party has filed an application for registration of the party, the Minister for the Interior and Health can suspend the processing of the application for registration of the party in the cases specified in the first sentence of subsection (1) or the first sentence of subsection (2) until the Election Board has made a decision under the first sentence of subsection (1), or until the Election Board has decided to discontinue the investigation.\n\n(5) The person registered as the holder of the party name at the time when the Election Board makes a decision under the first sentence of subsection (1) or at the time when the Minister for the Interior and Health makes a request to the Election Board under the first sentence of subsection (1) or the first sentence of subsection (2) can only apply for approval of the same party name when one year has elapsed since the expiry of the period specified in the second sentence of subsection (1).\n\n(6) The Minister for the Interior and Health shall notify Parliament of his or her request for a decision under the first sentence of subsection (1) or the first sentence of subsection (2) and of his or her decision under subsection (4) within one week of the request or decision, respectively. The Minister for the Interior and Health shall notify Parliament of any decision made by the Election Board under the first sentence of subsection (1), the first sentence of subsection (2) or the second sentence of subsection (3) within one week of the decision.\n\n12b.-(1) The Minister for the Interior and Health can lay down rules on:–\n\n(i) the design of the digital system made available by the Minister for the Interior and Health under the first sentence of section 12(6);\n\n(ii) proof of the identity of each voter submitting a statement of support and a voter declaration;\n\n(iii) verification that the conditions of section 12(8) to (10) on the submission of valid voter declarations have been met, including the retrieval of data from the Civil Registration System (CPR) for the purpose of such verification process;\n\n(iv) the design, handling, processing, verification, storage, withdrawal, deletion and destruction of statements of support and voter declarations submitted using the digital system under section 12(6) and submitted on a paper form under the first or second sentence of section 12(7);\n\n(v) the announcement of information on a party's collection of voter declarations other than the information specified in section 12(14);\n\n(vi) any temporary suspension of the digital system made available by the Minister for the Interior and Health under the first sentence of section 12(6) or of the procedure for the submission of voter declarations on a paper form under the first or second sentence of section 12(7) if such suspension is justified by decisive considerations as well as the suspension procedure; and\n\n(vii) the introduction of a temporary procedure for the collection of voter declarations in the cases specified in paragraph (vi) hereof as well as the details of such procedure.\n\n12c.-(1) No one shall provide, promise or offer an asset advantage in order to induce others to do any of the following:\n\n(i) To issue a statement of support or a voter declaration.\n\n(ii) To not issue a statement of support or a voter declaration.\n\n(iii) To withdraw a statement of support or a voter declaration.\n\n(iv) To not withdraw a statement of support or a voter declaration.\n\n13.-(1) No approval can be granted to a party name under sections 11a and 12 which-\n\n(i) is in use by a party entitled to nomination, see section 11;\n\n(ii) is the name of a party that has previously been entitled to nomination, see section 11, unless at least five periods of election have passed since the time when the party participated in general elections the last time;\n\n(iii) has been approved for a new party that wishes to participate in general elections by the Election Board, see section 12(2);\n\n(iv) is used by a party entitled to participate in elections to the European Parliament not included in cases specified in paragraph (i), see section 10 of the Danish Members of the European Parliament Elections Act;\n\n(v) is the name of a party not included in cases specified in paragraph (ii) that has previously been entitled to participate in European Parliamentary elections, see section 10 of the Danish Members of the European Parliament Elections Act unless at least four periods of election have passed since the time when the party participated in European Parliamentary Elections the last time;\n\n(vi) has been approved by the Election Board for a new party that wishes to participate in European Parliamentary elections, see section 11(2) in the Danish Members of the European Parliament Elections Act;\n\n(vii) is the name of a party in respect of which the Election Board has issued a decision pursuant to section 12a(1) or (2) of this Act or pursuant to section 11a(1) or (2) of the Act Concerning the Election of the Danish Members of the European Parliament (lov om valg af danske medlemmer til Europa-Parlamentet) and where the approval of this party name has not yet expired pursuant to the second sentence of section 12(2) and the first and second sentences of section 12(4) of this Act or pursuant to the second sentence of section 11(2) and the first and second sentences of section 11(4) of the Act Concerning the Election of the Danish Members of the European Parliament; or\n\n(viii) may cause confusion of identity with one of the parties referred to in paragraphs (i) to (vii).\n\n(2) The name of a party cannot be approved pursuant to sections 11a and 12 if by a final court decision it has been established or there are other reasons to assume that somebody else on a basis different than the rules in subsection (1) holds an exclusive right to the name. The name may, however, be approved if the holder of the exclusive right has consented to the party’s use of the name.\n\n(3) If by final judgment it is established or in general there are reasons to believe that, on a different basis than the rules of subsection (1), somebody else has the exclusive right to use a name approved by the Election Board under sections 11a and 12 as the name of a new party, and if the holder of this exclusive right does not consent to such party's use of the name, the Election Board can revoke the approval. If the party has been registered with the Minister for the Interior and Health under sections 12 to 12b, the party's right of participation in general elections will lapse.\n\n(4) If the name in which another person or entity holds the exclusive rights is a change of the name of a party which is entitled to participate in elections, see section 11a of this Act and section 10a of the Act Concerning the Election of the Danish Members of the European Parliament (lov om valg af danske medlemmer til Europa-Parlamentet), the Election Board may revoke the approval under subsection (3) so that the party is still entitled to participate in elections under the former party name. If the party is entitled to participate in elections to the Danish Parliament as well as to the European Parliament, however, the Election Board cannot revoke the approval in the period from the day when an election to the Danish parliament is called or from eight weeks before the day of an election to the European Parliament until and including election day. If the party is only entitled to participate in elections to the Danish parliament, the Election Board cannot revoke the approval in the period from the day when the election is called until and including election day. If the party is only entitled to participate in elections to the European Parliament, the Election Board cannot revoke the approval in the period from eight weeks before the day of an election to the European Parliament until and including election day.\n\n(5) The Election Board shall keep a list of party names (List of Party Names) which are comprised by subsection (1)(i) to (vii) and which have not been revoked in pursuance of subsections (3) and (4) (the Party Name Register).\n\n14.-(1) The Minister for the Interior and Health shall assign a letter to the parties entitled to nomination to be used for the listing of parties on the ballot papers. In the assignment of letters, such letters that have been carried by the parties in previous elections shall be preserved as far as possible.\n\n(2) Soonest possible after the expiry of the time-limit in section 12(1), the Minister for the Interior and Health shall publish the names of the parties entitled to nomination and the letters assigned to these parties in the Official Gazette.\n\nPart 4\n\nElectoral Registers and Poll Cards.\n\nElection Board\n\n15.–(1) Voters must be included in the electoral register in the municipality where they have their permanent residence, but see section 16.\n\n16.-(1) Voters comprised by section 2 who in connection with staying abroad are registered in the Civil Registration System (CPR) as emigrated, shall be included, upon request, in the electoral register in the municipality of their most recent registered residence in Denmark according to the residence register of the Civil Registration System (CPR). The request must be submitted to the local council on a form which has been approved by the Minister for the Interior and Health.\n\n(2) Voters who have stayed abroad for more than four years can only be included in the electoral register provided the Election Board considers the conditions of section 2 fulfilled in each individual case. If there is any doubt, whatsoever, as to whether a voter is comprised by section 2, the voter can be included in the electoral register provided only that the Election Board considers the conditions of section 2 fulfilled in each individual case.\n\n(3) Decisions regarding the inclusion in electoral registers of voters comprised by section 2(1) or (2), or section 2(4), see subsections (1) or (2) are valid for two years from the day of decision. If, prior to the expiry of the term specified in the first sentence, the voter submits a request for renewed inclusion in the electoral register, the term is extended until a decision has been made. A decision regarding the inclusion in the electoral register of a voter comprised by section 2(3) is valid for two years calculated from the day of emigration. A decision regarding the inclusion in the electoral register of a voter comprised by section 2(4), see subsection (3) is valid for two years calculated from the day of emigration for the person comprised by section 2(3) to whom the voter is related as specified in section 2(4).\n\n(4) The Minister for the Interior and Health shall lay down detailed rules for inclusion in the electoral register of voters comprised by section 2.\n\n16a.-(1) Voters comprised by the first sentence of section 2(1) or by section 2(4), read with the first sentence of section 2(1), who in connection with being assigned to duty outside the realm are registered in the population register on the Faroe Islands or the residence register of the Civil Registration System (CPR) in Greenland shall be included, upon request, in the electoral register in the Danish municipality of their most recent registered residence in Denmark according to the residence register of the Civil Registration System (CPR). The request must be submitted to the local council on a form which has been approved by the Minister for the Interior and Health and must include a statement to the effect that the applicant will only vote in Denmark in elections and referendums held in the entire realm.\n\n(2) In case of any doubt as to whether a voter falls within the scope of subsection (1), the voter can only be included in the electoral register if the Election Board deems in each case that the conditions under subsection (1) are satisfied.\n\n(3) A decision on inclusion in the electoral register of a voter falling within the scope of subsection (1) will apply for two years as from the date of the decision. If, before the expiry of the period mentioned in the first sentence, the voter submits a request for re-inclusion in the electoral register, the period will be extended until a decision has been made.\n\n17.-(1) The Minister for the Interior and Health shall set up an Election Board to decide on:–\n\n(i) inclusion in the electoral register as set out in section 16(2) and section 16a(2);\n\n(ii) inclusion in the electoral register for national referendums as set out in section 96b;\n\n(iii) inclusion in the electoral register for European Parliament elections as set out in section 14b of the Act Concerning the Election of the Danish Members of the European Parliament (lov om valg af danske medlemmer til Europa-Parlamentet);\n\n(iv) the approval of names for new parties aiming to participate in general elections, see section 12(2) and (4) and section 13(3), or in European Parliament elections, see section 11(2) and (4) and section 12 of the Act Concerning the Election of the Danish Members of the European Parliament;\n\n(v) approval of name changes for parties which are entitled to participate in elections to the Danish parliament, see sections 11a and 13(4), or elections to the European Parliament, see sections 10a and 12 of the Act Concerning the Election of the Danish Members of the European Parliament;\n\n(vi) inclusion in the Party Name Register, see section 13(5);\n\n(vii) the exclusion and cancellation of the collection of voter declarations for a party aiming to participate in general elections, see the first sentence of section 12a(1), or in European Parliament elections, see the first sentence of section 11a(1) of the Act Concerning the Election of the Danish Members of the European Parliament;\n\n(viii) the temporary exclusion of the right to collect voter declarations for a party aiming to participate in general elections, see the first sentence of section 12a(2) and the second sentence of section 12a(3), or in European Parliament elections, see the first sentence of section 11a(2) and the second sentence of section 11a(3) of the Act Concerning the Election of the Danish Members of the European Parliament; and\n\n(ix) the removal from office and suspension of a mayor or a holder of a different comparable municipal office or a chair of a regional council under the rules of sections 66a to 66c of the Act on Local Government (lov om kommunernes styrelse) and, as regards chairs of regional councils, also section 38 of the Regions Act (regionsloven).\n\n(2) The Election Board consists of a chair and two other members, but in the cases specified in subsection (1)(iv) to (viii) three other members.

The voter fills out the back of the cover containing the small envelope with the ballot paper and the covering letter with his/her name, date of birth and address in the presence of the vote receiver.\n\n(4) If the voter is unable to fill in the ballot paper or to fill in and sign the covering letter, or if the voter requests other assistance with the advance voting process, the vote receiver(s) shall provide the requisite assistance, but see subsection (6). Assistance in voting shall be provided by personal assistance and by use of any aids to be provided during the advance voting process, see the first sentence of section 63. If so expressly and unambiguously demanded by the voter, and if the voter’s demand is justified by an immediately identifiable or demonstrable physical or mental impairment, the personal assistance may be rendered only by a person appointed by the voter him- or herself. In addition to the vote receiver, or, in case of participation by more than one vote receiver, instead of one of these, the voter can demand personal assistance in voting by a person of his/her own choice.

The Minister for the Interior and Health shall lay down the rules for the content and design of the logbook.\n\n(2) If, according to the address stated on the cover, the sender is the resident of another municipality, the local council shall forward the advance vote to the appropriate municipality as soon as possible.\n\n(3) Once an election has been called, the local council shall see to it that advance votes from voters having cast their votes in advance prior to the calling of an election and later having notified their relocation to another municipality shall be forwarded to the new municipality of residence.\n\n(4) The local council shall collect and count the number of advance votes for each polling district of the municipality, in whose electoral register the senders are listed according to their address on the cover. The local council shall see to it that the advance votes are delivered to the polling supervisors at the polling stations within the appropriate polling districts before voting starts, but see subsection (5).\n\n(5) If less than five advance votes have been received within a polling district, the local council shall transfer the advance votes to a polling district which has received a minimum of five advance votes and hand them over to the polling supervisors of that polling district, who shall examine whether the advance votes qualify for consideration, see section 65. If a transferred advance vote is to be considered, the polling supervisors shall enter the voter in question in the election register, make a note on the electoral register about the cause for inclusion in the electoral register and otherwise follow the procedure specified in section 66(1) regarding advance votes qualifying for consideration. The polling supervisors shall furthermore instruct the polling supervisors of the original polling district that the voter concerned is to be deleted from the electoral register of that polling district before commencement of the vote. The cause for which the voter is deleted from the electoral register shall be stated in the electoral register of the original polling district, while noting in which polling district the voter has been included in the electoral register instead. If a transferred advance vote is not to considered, the polling supervisors shall follow the procedure specified in section 66(2), and no corrections shall be made to the electoral registers in the two polling districts concerned.\n\n(6) If based on the information about the sender on the cover, it cannot be decided in which polling district the sender is included in the electoral register, the local council shall decide to which polling district the advance vote shall belong with a view to having the polling supervisors check out the advance vote for its claim to being considered, see section 65.\n\n65.-(1) The election committee shall ensure that the advance votes are examined before voting starts and if necessary, on the day before or two days before election day. The covers shall be opened and the advance votes shall be checked for their claim to being considered.

The unopened envelope and the covering letter are replaced under the cover and retained until the voting is over. The covers are then removed from the envelopes and put into one of the ballot boxes. The envelopes shall not be opened until the votes are counted.\n\n(2) Where an advance vote does not qualify for consideration, the cause must be written on the cover and the unopened envelope and the covering letter be replaced under the cover.\n\n(3) Advance votes received by the polling supervisors after the voting starts shall be marked by the time of their reception and shall not be considered.\n\n67.-(1) A voter having cast an advance vote which has already been considered cannot cast his or her vote in the polls on election day.\n\nPart 9\n\nComputation of the Poll in the Nomination District.\n\nCounting of the Votes Cast at the Polling Station\n\n68.-(1) When the voting is over, the polling supervisors and the appointed electors, but see section 74a, shall count the votes cast at the polling station. The counting is public. The number of votes cast for each party and for each independent candidate shall be counted.\n\n(2) A vote is cast for the party within the field of which the voter has put his or her cross on the ballot paper. An advance vote is cast for the party, whose name or letter the voter has indicated on the ballot paper. If, on the advance ballot paper, the voter has stated the name of a candidate standing for a party, the vote shall be regarded as cast in favour of the party.\n\n(3) A vote is cast for the independent candidate against whom the voter has put his or her cross on the ballot paper.

The chair of the polling supervisors shall immediately notify the chair of the election committee of the results. In municipalities comprising more than one nomination district, the chair of the election committee can decide that notice shall be given to one of the chairmen of the polling supervisors in each nomination district.\n\n71.-(1) When the chair of the election committee has received reports from all polling stations in the nomination district, the votes reported are summed up. Immediately after, the Minister for the Interior and Health shall be given a report of how many votes in the entire nomination district have been cast for each party and for each independent candidate. The Minister for the Interior and Health shall decide the specific reporting procedure.\n\nRecount in the Nomination District\n\n72.-(1) Not later than on the day after the voting shall the local election committee assemble to undertake the final counting of the votes cast in the nomination district (recount). In nomination districts consisting of more than one municipality, the election committee shall assemble in the constituency municipality. The recount is public.\n\n(2) The local council shall see to it that the poll books, the used electoral registers and poll cards, the ballot papers and the advance voting material are present at the recount. The local council shall keep a copy of the poll books.\n\n73.-(1) For each polling district the election committee shall recount and reassess the ballot papers according to the rules in sections 68, 69 and 74a. The results of the counts shall be entered in the election records. Then the number of votes allocated to each party and to each independent candidate shall be summed up for the nomination district as a whole. The result shall be entered in the election records and be announced to those present.\n\n(2) The number of personal votes for each candidate and the number of party votes for each party in each polling district and in the nomination district as a whole are tabulated concurrently, see subsections (3) and (4). Subsequently, the number of party votes cast for the nomination district as a whole is tabulated, to establish the allocation of votes in respect of each individual candidate, see subsection (5), and the number of personal votes and added party votes in respect of each candidate are summed up.\n\n(3) If the voter has put a cross against the name of a candidate, or against both the name of a candidate and the name of the party for which the candidate stands, the ballot paper shall be deemed as cast in favour of such candidate (personal vote). Similar rules shall apply if, on the advance ballot paper, the voter has indicated the name of a candidate or both the name of a candidate and the name or letter of the party for which the candidate stands.\n\n(4) If the voter has put a cross against the name of a party or within the party field in such a way that there is doubt as to which of the party’s candidates the voter intended to give his or her vote, the ballot paper shall be deemed to have been cast in favour of the party (party vote). Similar rules shall apply if, on the advance ballot paper, the voter has indicated the name or the letter of a party or the names of more than one candidate standing for the same party in the multimember constituency.\n\n(5) In case of candidature by district, the party votes according to subsection (4) shall be allocated to the party candidate in the nomination district. If a party whose candidates in the multimember constituency are listed individually in all nomination districts in the multimember constituency has announced, for the relevant multimember constituency, that the party votes in the multimember constituency shall go to none of the party's candidates in the multimember constituency, see section 41a, the party votes shall go to none of the party's candidates in the multimember constituency, but shall be registered separately as “Other party votes”. In other cases of candidature in parallel the party votes shall be distributed among the party candidates in the nomination district in proportion to their number of personal votes, see subsection (3). If two or more candidates are equally entitled to a party vote, the Minister for the Interior and Health shall arrange to draw lots. If, in the nomination district, the party does not have a candidate standing, the party votes shall not be allocated to any candidate, but shall be listed separately as ”other party votes”. If a party list has been registered, these votes shall, however, be allocated to the candidate announced as the first candidate in the party list in the multimember constituency.\n\n(6) The result of the tabulation and summation for the nomination district as a whole specified in the first and second sentences of subsection (2) shall be entered in the election records and be announced to those present.

The copy shall be confirmed by the chair. The copy of the election records shall be received by the Minister for the Interior and Health as far as possible not later than on the day after the recount of the votes. The Minister for the Interior and Health determines the forwarding procedure for the election records complete with attachments and may also lay down to which extent and in which form the election records complete with attachments must be electronically submitted to the Minister for the Interior and Health.\n\nCandidates’ Participation in the Counting of Votes\n\n74a.-(1) No candidate standing for a party in a multimember constituency is allowed to participate in counting the number of votes cast for the party concerned. No candidate standing as an independent candidate in a multimember constituency is allowed to participate in counting the number of votes cast for each independent candidate. No candidate standing for a party in a multimember constituency is allowed to participate in the tabulation of votes cast for the party reflecting the distribution between personal votes for each individual candidate and party votes, see section 73(3) and (4).\n\nPart 10\n\nTabulation of the Election\n\n75.-(1) When the Minister for the Interior and Health has received the confirmed copies of all election records, these are used for overall tabulation of the election.\n\nAllocation of Constituency Seats\n\n76.-(1) The votes cast for each party in all nomination districts in a multimember constituency shall be summed up. The votes cast for each individual candidate shall equally be summed up.\n\n(2) Each number of votes appearing as a result of the summation, see subsection (1), shall be divided by 1 – 2 – 3 and so on until such number of divisions equivalent to the maximum number of seats expected to be allocated to the party or to the independent candidate has been performed. The party or the independent candidate having the highest resulting quotients shall be given the first seat in the multimember constituency. The second highest quotient entails the second seat and so on and so forth, until all constituency seats in the multimember constituency have been distributed among the parties and the independent candidates. If two or more quotients are of equal size, lots shall be drawn.\n\nAllocation of Compensatory Seats\n\n77.-(1) Compensatory seats shall be allocated to parties which have either\n\n(i) obtained at least one constituency seat; or,\n\n(ii) in two of the three regions specified in section 8(1) obtained at least a number of votes equivalent to the average number of valid votes per constituency seat in the region; or,\n\n(iii) obtained at least two per cent of the valid votes cast in all Denmark.\n\n(2) The number of votes cast in favour of each party in all Denmark shall be computed for each of the parties which are entitled to compensatory seats according to subsection (1). The total number of votes for these parties shall be divided by the figure 175 with deduction of the number of constituency seats which may have accrued to independent candidates. Votes cast for each party shall be divided by the resulting figure. The resulting quotients indicate the number of seats to which each party is entitled in proportion to its vote. If these quotients are not integers and, therefore, do not add up to the whole number of seats when fractions are eliminated, the largest fractions shall be increased until the number has been reached (method of the largest remainders). If two or more fractions are of equal size, lots shall be drawn.\n\n(3) If no parties have obtained more constituency seats than the total number of seats to which the party is entitled in proportion to its vote, see subsection (2), the allocation in subsection (2) shall be final. Hence, the number of compensatory seats to be allocated to the respective parties shall be computed as the difference between the party’s total number of seats and its constituency seats.\n\n(4) If a party has obtained more constituency seats than the total number of seats to which the party is entitled in proportion to its vote, see subsection (2), a second computation shall be made. In this computation parties which have obtained a number of constituency seats equivalent to or larger than the total number of seats to which they are entitled in proportion to their votes shall be disregarded. For the parties which are subsequently considered, the seats shall be allocated according to similar rules as in subsection (2), and the number of compensatory seats to be allocated to the respective parties shall be computed as stated in subsection (3).\n\n(5) Where, by the second computation, a party has obtained more seats than the number of seats to which the party is entitled in proportion to its vote, see subsection (2), the party shall be allocated the number of seats to which it is entitled in accordance with subsection (2). The remaining seats shall be redistributed among the other partie"
