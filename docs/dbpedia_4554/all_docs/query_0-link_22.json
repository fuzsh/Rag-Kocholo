        "text": "We are always proud to see our esteemed professionals published! These co-authors represent our company's foundations, and the collective knowledge of our long-tenured experts in the field of Water Resources modeling and . This paper, entitled \"Diagnostic DO Model for Narrow, Tidally Dominated Estuary,\" documents a new approach that uses high-temporal-resolution monitoring data to resolve processes that control the short-term variability of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in narrow, shallow tidal estuaries - such as the Hackensack River Estuary in New Jersey. The study offers new insights on how this estuary \"works\", and a new way to improve the practice of water quality monitoring / modeling in such estuaries. #ScienceIsFun #WaterResources #Environment #EnvironmentalEngineering #Engineering #ProtectOurWater Tavit Najarian Joe DiLorenzo Poshu Huang Howard Litwack Georgia Marino\n\n#CALL4ABSTRACTS - We are proposing a session on #naturebasedsolutions and #biobasedsolutions to mitigate the effects of #landslides and #erosion at #EGU24 - European Geosciences Union (EGU) (Vienna & online).

Since then we started working hard to carry on our project called \"Geosciences for Sustainable Development\" and all the updates are being published on our website. In this video we show how the new #geochemistry laboratory for environmental studies will be rebuilt and set up. The head of the Lab is Valentina Prigiobbe, an assistant professor of the Department of Geosciences of Universit√† degli Studi di Padova with a strong knowledge of research topics which are at the intersection of water, energy, and urban hydrology. #sustainability #sustainabledevelopment #geosciences\n\nThe Call for Abstracts for the Coastal Resilience and Adaptation Conference has been extended until June 15th! The conference is intended to provide information and resources to coastal communities including decision makers, elected officials, city and county staff, natural resource managers, academics, and the private sector on the latest technological advances for coastal resilience and adaptation. The conference will be broken up into sessions that will explore technological applications in 4 thematic tracks: o Coastal Energy Transition o Marine Debris o Nature Based Solutions o Early Hazard Warning Systems We invite you to submit an abstract for the conference and share your research/application areas with the communities in Texas. The deadline for abstract submission is now open until June 15th, 2024. For more information, updates, and abstract submission, please visit tx.ag/CRAConference. Please contact tees_conferences@tamu.edu with any questions.

This article, published in Elsevier's Environmental Challenges journalüê¶ üê† üêù, introduces a spatial decision support tool that considers hydrological parameters at the pixel scale üîç . Our study investigates the Hungarian city of Debrecen, utilizing Landsat 8 imagery üì° , Google Earth , and Corine Land Cover data to create a high-resolution land cover mapüåç üåê. This map achieves an overall accuracy of 81.2% and a kappa coefficient exceeding 0.78. By classifying land cover into seven categories (forests, sealed surfaces, crops, grassland, semi-sealed surfaces, bare ground, and water bodies), the study facilitates the identification of key parameters for water balance calculations, such as crop coefficient for evapotranspiration estimation, runoff coefficients, and infiltration rates. The research also explores the incorporation of meteorological data from 2016 to 2019 for evapotranspiration assessments. The findings demonstrate the potential of this technique for application in other urban areas, promoting more precise water balance calculations and informed urban planning strategies.

In the video, you can see the mangrove trees facing the force of our simulated waves. Mangroves are a crucial factor in the protection of tropical coastal areas. With their large roots, they hold a lot of sediment and dampen waves. \"Many claims are made about mangroves that provide increased flood safety. But hard proof is scarce. If we really want to include nature's protective role in our flood protection, measurements at full scale are indispensable. The scientific world is eagerly awaiting this,\" says Bas Hofland. Bregje van Wesenbeeck has been studying the behaviour of vegetation under extreme hydraulic conditions for years. \"Models that predict how trees behave in water are based on static sticks. However, under stormy conditions with high waves, trees bend.\" The wave attenuation may be different from what is thought, as trees move with the waves. In order to make the experiment happen, Van Wesenbeeck spent years cultivating tropical mangrove trees in a greenhouse at Deltares. It is now finally possible to do tests with real trees, on a true scale. üëâ Read more about it here: https://edu.nl/u6v4p #university #research #science #nature #hydraulic TU Delft | Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Alejandra Gij√≥n Manche√±o, Su Kalloe\n\nOver the past two months, our Monitoring team at IMDC embarked on a series of comprehensive 13-hour monitoring campaigns in the Scheldt estuary, as part of the OMES program (Environmental Impact Research Program of the Sigma Plan) commissioned by De Vlaamse Waterweg nv. Initiated in 1995, The OMES program has been instrumental in increasing and updating the knowledge of the ecosystem in the Zeeschelde. In addition to the yearly 13-hour campaigns the program incorporates monthly 3-day campaigns conducted at specific locations along the Zeeschelde, Rupel, Nete and Dijle rivers. IMDC‚Äôs responsibility is to determine the flow rates, water volumes, sediment fluxes, and sediment loads, contributing to a deeper understanding of this crucial waterway. Through comprehensive research and monitoring programs like OMES, and as part of the cross-border MONEOS monitoring program, Flemish water managers and scientists are keeping a close watch on the Schelde estuary's water quality, quantity, and diverse ecosystem. This collaborative effort is essential for preserving our natural heritage and ensuring a sustainable future for the estuary that is so integral to our community. It's an honor to work alongside esteemed partners such as ECOSPHERE UAntwerp, Ghent University, VLIZ - Flanders Marine Institute, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Amicale GC Universit√© Paul Sabatier, and with support of Waterbouwkundig Laboratorium and VLOOT. This collaboration has been instrumental in the successful execution of OMES program. üåäüî¨ If you would require further information of this topic, please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact our colleague Jan Claus. #EnvironmentalResearch #ScheldtRiver #WaterQuality #Monitoring #Sigmaplan #ExpertsInWater #ADCP #Turbidity\n\nThe book \"The Aegean Sea Environment\" which includes our chapter \"Air‚ÄìSea Interaction: Heat and Fresh-Water Fluxes in the Aegean Sea\", has just been published on SpringerLink! It is part of the book series \"The Handbook of Environmental Chemistry\", and presents recent advances in the understanding of the Aegean Sea Environment, from a multitude of perspectives. In our chapter, we examine the characteristics and variability of the sea surface heat, freshwater and overall buoyancy fluxes, and the exchanges with the atmosphere over the Aegean Sea. These fluxes, are partially controlled by the latteral buoyancy gain through Dardanelles strait and the subsequent formation of a shallow surface layer of modified Black Sea waters in the Aegean Sea, highlighting the critical role of the interaction between the two seas on regional climate."
