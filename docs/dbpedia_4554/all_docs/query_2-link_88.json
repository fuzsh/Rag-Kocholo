It is important to have measured your temperature rectally if there is suspicion of infection or inflammation.\n\nThe doctor will determine whether the telephone consultation is sufficient or if you should be examined at one of the clinics.\n\nThe doctor will assess whether a home visit is necessary.\n\nThe doctor will often recommend that you contact your doctor.\n\nIf the doctor deems that you should be examined, you will be referred to one of the out-of-hours Medical Helpline clinics.\n\nRemember to bring your yellow health insurance card/health card and information about the medication you usually take.\n\nOn the islands Anholt and Endelave, island doctors provide emergency assistance. First, contact the out-of-hours Medical Helpline."
