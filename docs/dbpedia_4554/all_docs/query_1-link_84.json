        "text": "During the Cold War, the General Staff of the Soviet Union secretly mapped foreign countries for military purposes. As the material was unavailable to scholars before the fall of the Soviet Union, research into the cartographic heritage of this global mapping enterprise has only emerged in recent years. The geographical information contained in the maps was based on a wide range of sources, among them remote sensing, existing topographical maps and even information collected by intelligence officers in the field (Davies and Kent 2017). Davies and Kent have carried out pioneering work on the Soviet practice of mapping, but mostly based on material from the United States and the United Kingdom. Following the research agenda set by them, this paper presents an initial analysis of the Soviet military mapping of Denmark based on the collection of Soviet maps held by the Royal Danish Library. We focus on identifying information sources used in production, as well as assessing the general ...\n\nIn the last decades, the development of smartphones, drones, aerial patrols, and digital cameras enabled high-quality photographs available to large populations and, thus, provides an opportunity to collect massive data of the nature and society with global coverage. However, the data collected with new photography tools is usually oblique they are difficult to be georeferenced, and huge amounts of data is often obsolete. Georeferencing oblique imagery data may be solved by a technique called monoplotting, which only requires a single image and Digital Elevation Model (DEM). In traditional monoplotting, a human user has to manually choose a series of ground control point (GCP) pairs in the image and DEM and then determine the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters of the camera to establish a pixel-level correspondence between photos and the DEM to enable the mapping and georeferencing of objects in photos. This traditional method is difficult to scale due to several challenges includin...\n\nThis paper gives a presentation of how airborne laser scanning (ALS) has been adopted in archaeology in the North over the period 2005-2019. Almost two decades have passed since ALS first emerged as a potential tool to add to the archaeologist's toolbox. Soon after, it attracted the attention of researchers within archaeological communities engaged with remote sensing in the Fenno-Scandinavian region. The first archaeological ALS projects gave immediate good results and led to further use, research, and development through new projects that followed various tracks. The bulk of the research and development focused on studying how well-suited ALS is for identifying, mapping, and documenting archaeological features in outfield land, mainly in forested areas. The poor situation in terms of lack of information on archaeological records in outfield areas has been challenging for research and especially for cultural heritage management for a long period of time. Consequently, an obvious direction was to study how ALS-based mapping of cultural features in forests could help to improve the survey situation. This led to various statistical analyses and studies covering research questions related to for instance effects on detection success of laser pulse density, and the size and shape of the targeted features. Substantial research has also been devoted to the development and assessment of semi-automatic detection of archaeological features based on the use of algorithms. This has been studied as an alternative approach to human desk-based visual analyses and interpretations of ALS data. This approach has considerable potential for detecting sites over large regions such as the vast roadless and unbuilt wilderness regions of northern Fennoscandia, and has proven highly successful. In addition, the current review presents how ALS has been employed for monitoring purposes and for landscape studies, including how it can influence landscape understanding. Finally, the most recent advance within ALS research and development has been discussed: testing of the use of drones for data acquisition. In conclusion, aspects related to the utilization of ALS in archaeological research and cultural heritage management are summarized and discussed, together with thoughts about future perspectives.\n\nA holistic theory of landscapes should become an integral part of the conceptual foundation of goal-oriented and mission-driven landscape ecology. Based on a dynamic systems view, emerging from the recent paradigm shifts and insights gained from findings on complexity and wholeness multifunctional landscapes should be conceived as tangible, mixed natural and cultural interacting middle-number systems and as the concrete, self-organizing Gestalt systems of our Total Human Ecosystem. Ranging from the smallest mappable ecotope holon to the global ecosphere landscape, they should be studied, upgraded, managed and evaluated with a biperspectivable systems view, treating them simultaneously both as products of both material, natural biogeophysical systems and as mental, cognitive noospheric systems. This can be achieved with the help of innovative transdisciplinary approaches and research methods, in close cooperation between landscape ecologists and ecologically oriented scientists from ..."
