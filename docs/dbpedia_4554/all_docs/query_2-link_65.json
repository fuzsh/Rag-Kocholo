        "text": "On Hjarnø are 10 well-preserved shipwrecks from the Viking Age, which can be easily visited when you are on a day trip to the island. The Calves, which have given rise to exciting legends, are one of the best places in Denmark to experience visible signs of the Viking Age in the landscape.\n\nWhere the Vikings lived, the Vikings were buried\n\nClose to Hjarnø's south-eastern coast lies a visible and well-preserved relic from the Viking Age. In the protected area close to Odden, you can see 10 shipwrecks from the period 850-950. Originally, there were more than 20 burials in this burial ground. The graves can be seen as a pagan manifestation in a time when Christianity was on the rise in the country. The ship phrases are a religious symbol of the deceased's association with the Nordic gods – specifically Njord, whose symbol is a ship. A ship-shaped burial site was chosen to invoke good sailing and fishing at Njord.\n\nThe ships are up to 8 meters long and consist of upright boulders. Three of the graves have been archaeologically excavated, and here you could see that the deceased had been burned before being buried, which was a well-known and normal practice in the Viking Age.\n\nThe shipwrecks are grave monuments for powerful men or women who ruled the island and thus the entrance to Horsens Fjord.\n\nKing Hjarne's burial place\n\nAn old legend tells that the legendary figure King Hjarne is buried in the ship's hulls.\n\nIn the 500th century, the Dane king Frode Fredegod died and lay dead on his funeral pyre. But they could not light the fire, because his sons were not there to sing a death song for the king. Therefore, the Jutish warrior, Hjarne, stepped forward in front of the assembly and sang a song so beautiful that the Jutish people subsequently named him the new king of Jutland. Hjarne consolidated his royal power on the island which is named after him. Here he married the warrior woman Alrune, who was assigned the neighboring island of Alrø. Together they had a son who was named Endlau. To him they assigned Endelave. Together, the Jutland royal family consolidated their power at the entrance to Horsens Fjord.\n\nBut the peace did not last in King Hjarne's Jutland kingdom. Soon Frode Fredegod's sons returned from the Viking expedition and declared war on King Hjarne. It ended with a big battle in which King Hjarne, his family and his Jutland army were killed. The legend says that the new King Fridleif nevertheless wanted to honor King Hjarne by burying him in the shipwrecks that still stand on Hjarnø to this day.\n\nThe story of King Hjarne is just a myth that was written down by Saxo, but a few years ago there was a young woman who found Denmark's biggest gold treasure on Hjarnø. The gold treasure was from the same period and indicates that Hjarnø has been home to powerful families. However, it is unknown who was buried in Kalvestenen.\n\nExplore Hjarnø\n\nHjarnø is a small island at the entrance to Horsens Fjord, which offers a beautiful, authentic Danish island atmosphere. The ferry runs 30 times a day and the journey takes only five minutes. The island offers calm, beautiful nature, but also has restaurants, accommodation and shops.\n\nFrom the harbor you can follow a signposted route to the east along the south side of Hjarnø. From the island's church, which is Denmark's second smallest before a path down to Hjarnø Odde. When you have passed the small lake by the Odden, the Calves are on your left.\n\nYou can find inspiration for your trip to Hjarnø on this page.\n\nUpdated by: Destination Coastal Land | info@kystlandet.com"
