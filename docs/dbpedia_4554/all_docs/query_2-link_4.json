        "text": "I always bring a flower plant in a pot with me on a flying trip, do you? ðŸ™‚ Just kidding â€“ I bought it for my flying club; we like having flowers in our club house:\n\nFlemming and I were going on a 2-day trip to Endelave island, and it was the first time we had our tent with us.\n\nWhilst doing the pre-flight check, Flemming noticed that the left tire looked strange. We checked the pressure â€“ it was lower than the required 1.6, and we pumped it up. Checked the right tire as well â€“ it was fine:\n\nOver Zealand, there were some clouds, but over the water it was sky clear:\n\nThere were lots of circular rainbows, and Flemming succeeded taking a photo where we could see the shadow of our aeroplane:\n\nFunny enough, we had circular rainbows on our previous flight to Endelave in February this year, as well.\n\nCamping is easy on the Endelave airfield:\n\nAfter arranging all the practicalities, we took our bikes and headed on the road â€“ we wanted to visit the northernmost tip of the island called Ã˜verste Ende (English: Upper End):\n\nIt is a 7 km ride, but took us a couple of hours to get there; we stopped when we saw something interesting, like grazing sheep:\n\nOr beautiful fields:\n\nÃ˜verste Ende is a protected nature area, and there one can experience the same phenomenon as at Grenen near Skagen â€“ waters from two different sides meet together:\n\nIt was a warm summer day, and it was so nice to get into the water:\n\nFlemming and I were alone on the tip, and took the opportunity to sunbath and swim naked. The water was very pure, and we regretted we didnâ€™t bring our snorkelling gear with us.\n\nThe Aviator loved the plants on the beach, and relaxed in their cooling leaves:\n\nWe loved being on Ã˜verste Ende very much. It was peaceful and silent, with the pleasant sound of gentle waves in the backgroundâ€¦\n\nThe day was coming to an end, and warm sunlight was lighting up the fields:\n\nFor dinner, we walked to Klinten, a 50 m high cliff on the south-eastern part of Endelave, where we enjoyed our food and a glass (or two) of rosÃ©:\n\nThe sunset was stunning, and we appreciated that wonderful time on the island:"
