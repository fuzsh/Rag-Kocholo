        "text": "When I got up in the morning, Flemming wasn‚Äôt there. Soon he was back, with fresh eggs for breakfast from a farm nearby.\n\nThe tea kitchen in the former stable had all the necessary things, many of them brought by other pilots, like tea, coffee or sugar. We later contributed with a 1 kg of salt üôÇ which we missed for our soft-boiled eggs and porridge.\n\nAfter breakfast, Flemming worked, and I had the time to prepare myself for the day.\n\nWe wanted to visit Ranes Borg (English: Rane‚Äôs Fortress), a historical site with remains of some kind of fortification:\n\nBut first ‚Äì a visit to the local museum (I never had the time for it before!):\n\nThen ‚Äì a stroll in the marina, lunch, and an ice-cream:\n\nWe also attempted to visit L√¶geurtehaven (the medicinal herb garden with shop and caf√©), but none of us is really interested in botanics, though Flemming grows lots of different roses in his garden, and orchids at home. We had a quick look and headed for the Ranes Borg.\n\nRanes Borg was a relatively small place in a forest, a square of large stones measuring 16 x 16 metres:\n\nThe site was investigated several times, also by archaeologists, but nobody really knows what it was. The place is called after Rane Jonsen, a noble-born man known for his role in the murder of Erik V of Denmark in 1286, but it is unclear why it is called after him. Probably, Rane Jonsen owned some parts of the island.\n\nFlemming and I biked back to Endelave village, and had an afternoon coffee there. The waiter informally told us, they had some remaining coffee in a thermos, but he was unsure whether it was still warm!\n\nWe had plenty of time left, and decided to walk to the north-eastern tip of Endelave. From air, it looked like there was a very nice sand beach there.\n\nWhat looked so beautiful from the air, was something different on the ground.\n\nOn that beach, we discovered a tick (that nasty biting insect that might bring Lyme infection) on my thigh. Luckily, just a couple of days before I bought a tick removal tool and had it with me! Flemming removed the tick ‚Äì and it wasn‚Äôt easy. And then again, we had the beach only for ourselves, and enjoyed swimming:\n\nBack to the airfield, where we had strawberries before leaving home:\n\nWe did a round over the island, in order to get the altitude for flying over the Kattegat, and also to say ‚Äútill next time‚Äù to the wonderful places we visited on Endelave:\n\nThe flight back home was easy. We had head wind, but not much, and the air was calm. Two happy (and tired after two active days) pilots:\n\nOn landing in Holb√¶k, there were dozens of hares on the runway, and I had to fly over them in order to land longer away. We hadn‚Äôt seen that many of hares on Endelave ‚Äì and there should be up to 15,000 of them, according to the tourist brochures!\n\nI sent Flemming to the club house to have something to eat (a man must never be hungry!), and whilst he was busy with that, washed my Aeroprakt thoroughly."
