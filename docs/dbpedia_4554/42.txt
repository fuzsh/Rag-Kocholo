We are so excited to introduce Danish brand Kit Couture to TKL! Kit Couture's ambition is to create designs for knitting, crochet, and embroidery which are exciting and innovative. At the same time, they want to motivate those who have not previously crafted to get started and get the feeling of creative joy and insight into an exciting universe. At Kit Couture, they make it easy for you to get started. No matter if you are a beginner or advanced, they have created craft kits matching your level and wishes.

The Endelave Slipover is worked in stocking stitch bottom up in Kit Couture's Blow, while the borders are worked in Highland. After casting off for armhole, front and back are worked separately. Then armhole and neck borders are worked by picking up stitches.
