The Endelave Slipover is a must-have in your basic wardrobe. It can be used year-round with a shirt or a blouse underneath. The slipover is simple to knit, which makes it a good beginner project. The Endelave Slipover is worked in a soft, tweed-like Blown yarn, with beautiful flecks, while all the ribbing is worked in Highland wool.

ABOUT THE STYLE

The Endelave Slipover is worked in an Italian Blown yarn (37% alpaca, 26% wool, 2% viscose and 35% polyamide) and 100% Peruvian Highland wool.

The slipover is knit using circular needles size 5 and 5,5 mm (80 cm), as well as 4,5 mm (40 cm).

We always recommend doing a gauge swatch before commencing your project, to get the right tension and thereby the right fit.

The technique is stockinette with one thread of Blown yarn. All ribbings are worked knit with one thread of Highland yarn. The slipover is knit bottom-up.

The style is available in four sizes and 2 colours.
