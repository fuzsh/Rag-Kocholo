        "text": "Swedish artist Martin Bladh works within various mediums. For the listener, you may best know him as the frontman of IRM and Skin Area. In an area where many have fallen short of good potential by setting out merely to shock or provoke, his musical work, as well as his visual and multimedia work encompasses an eclectic palette that contrasts the visceral and macabre with sophisication and poignancy. It’s truly a pleasure to share a word with the man.\n\nSOI: You’re currently in the process of putting together a new album with IRM, entitled ‘Closure’. What can be expected from the new release musically?\n\nMB: It is the third and final part of a trilogy which started with the Indications of Nigredo EP (2008) and was followed by the Order4 album (2010). We’ve just started the recording session, so everything is still very abstract and I only have a vague idea about the finished result, but it will probably be a bleaker record than its precursors. Indications might be looked upon as a guilty pleasure and Order4 as the urgent need to extinguish an itch, Closure… takes of from there.\n\nSOI:How will the new material compare to the likes of ‘Order’, ‘Oedipus Dethroned’ and ‘Virgin Mind?\n\nMB: All of the IRM albums have their own identity and Closure… won’t be an exception. We would never do an album that sounded similar to its precursors, this isn’t something we’re planning before starting the recording process, it just comes out that way. Closure… will be another step in that obvious direction. Although, people who picked up the first two parts of the trilogy might find a certain kinship with these specific records but I’m not sure about the outcome yet.\n\nSOI: You seem to have a rather productive schedule in terms of your own work and collaborations with others. What else can be expected from yourself in 2013?\n\nMB: Music wise there is a Skin Area/Jarl collaboration mini-LP called La Petite Mort which will be released on Malignant Records later this year. I’ve also been involved in another collaboration work together with Portuguese sound mavericks Sektor 304; the album will be called Ruby and I’ve contributed with artworks and a lengthy spoken word text; the Sektor 304 guys made all the music. There are also some books coming out in the near future. The first one is called DES, it’s a multimedia work that collects my long time fascination with British serial killer Dennis Nilsen; the book which will be published by Mikko Aspa’s Institute of Paraphilia Studies will contain photographs, drawings, text collages and my correspondence with Nilsen himself and the son of his 14th victim Graham Allen. Then there’s Qualis Artifex Pereo a book/DVD which I did together with Swedish author/artist Bo. I Cavefors; this release will be put out by Swedish publisher Styx Förlag and it is centred around two films with the same title ( included on the DVD) loosely based upon and inspired by the works and ideas of Georges Bataille and emperor Nero. And of course, last but not least I’ve just started my own publishing company called Infinity Land Press together with British based artist Karolina Urbaniak. Our first book To Putrefaction (a collaborative photo/text series) will be up for pre-order very soon.\n\nSOI: Regarding much of your art, many of the installations and pieces coincide with and compliment a particular musical release from yourself, be it with Skin Area, IRM, solo work or a collaboration, so one can imagine various approaches. I always get the impression that your music is meticulously informed by the outcomes of your works.\n\nMB: My work is always based upon a specific subject and often linked to series of other pieces from a wide range of media. I prefer the Wagnerian term Gesamtkunstwerk – the total work of art – where different medias blend together to create a union. And because of my compulsive need to revise my subject I often do numerous studies. I need all of these different techniques – performance, film, music, text, photography, drawing and collage – to filtrate the same content and become parts of a greater whole, a synthesis which works on different levels and senses. This way of working has helped me enormously when I’ve tried to pin down my obsessions and special interests.\n\nSOI: What comes first, sound or vision?\n\nMB:The text mostly comes first.\n\nSOI: Does your visual art give you a accurate idea of how you’d like the music to turn out?\n\nMB: It is about putting flesh on a skeleton of words with blocks of sound. The lyrics are there as directions, manuscripts to be followed, the recording process is similar to the making of a movie or rehearsing of a stage play. When I asked Swedish artist Stefan Danielsson (who I admire a lot) to do the artwork for Order4 I just sent him the lyrics because I just wanted him to focus on the content, the music hadn’t been recorded yet. The collaboration I’m doing with Sektor 304 came out in a similar fashion; I first sent them the lyrics and the artwork. But in other cases such as Rothko Field, the images came about after the whole album was recorded.\n\nSOI: How calculated is the composition process, does improvisation ever play a role in your music?\n\nMB: Sometimes accidents can be helpful, but we seldom or never do ‘jam-sessions’ anymore. As already stated it’s all about finding sounds for the words.\n\nSOI: Your live actions and performances tend to be very harsh and visceral in a visual level, yet the musical work that accompanies it, whilst not without extremity and unpleasantness, contains an emphasis on subtleties, form, patterns and structure that is unique within contemporary industrial music. Was this development a conscious decision on behalf of yourself and fellow musicians, a natural progression or a desire to try out something new?\n\nMB: I don’t think anything that I’m doing has that much to do with industrial culture anymore. But, yes I would say that the music follows a natural progression that mirrors my and my collaborators current interests and tastes. I’ve never searched for originality just for the sake of it, all true evolution comes natural.\n\nSOI: With the first wave of industrial artists, namely Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire and SPK, there was something of a chronological trend towards more accessibility, more conventional, accessible, poppy compositions.\n\nWhen power electronics came along it was almost a reaction against what some may have considered a compromise. Similarly some of the original P.E. acts, particularly Sutcliffe Jugend and Ramleh would take directions that veered towards expressive noise rock, as evidenced in bands like Bodychoke and Skullflower.\n\nIs it the intention with any of your music to balance and find a middle ground between a gut instinct and something harmonious? When listening to Skin Area’s ‘Rothko Field’ I do get this idea…\n\nMB: When you’re painting a picture or telling a story you sometimes need harmony, sometimes disharmony – I like my work to have a certain physical effect on the nervous system and you can’t get that in a satisfactory way if you’re only indulging in disharmonic noise scapes all the time. I need content and I don’t like noise for noise sake. Speaking about Rothko Field you must also remember that Magnus Lindh is a very important part of Skin Area; he never been into industrial music, PE or harsh noise, his taste is more cemented in alternative rock and post-punk which might bring a more eclectic palette to the music.\n\nSOI: What was the particular concept and idea behind ‘Rothko Field’, and how did that develop? The ‘mirror effect’ that is prevalent when listening to the album is wonderfully endearing….\n\nMB: The title refers to Russian/American painter Mark Rothko’s suicide, but the record isn’t about him. I would say that the album is about creativity and sacrifice, to leave some kind of mark behind, even though it might be an utterly disturbing one. Speaking pretentiously, Rothko Field describes a kind of hypnagogic or poetic reality. It’s not a narrative story, but follows a pattern of dreamlike images. One of them is the one of the actual ‘Rothko Field’ – a symbolic field of death, or a site for an arranged private sacrifice: an imaginary photograph of Marc Rothko in a pool blood, crucified to his studio floor superimposed on a reproduction of Van Gogh’s Wheat Field with Crows). Two artistic iconoclastic images that bleeds into each other. The doppelganger leitmotiv of the mirror has more to do with form than content this time.\n\nSOI: You did with IRM a part-studio, part-live release entitled ‘Cult Of The Young Men’. The artwork you did to accompany this features images and fixates on various deceased artistic figures. Both Ian Curtis of Joy Division and Per Yngve ‘Dead’ Ohlin of Mayhem are featured. Whilst stylistically juxtaposed, both of these figures were withdrawn, abstract individuals that had a sense of dark romanticism and despair in their lyrical writings. One was an iconic figure of post-punk music, the other an important figurehead of black metal. To what extent do you take an enthusiasm towards said forms of music?\n\nMB: The Cult of the Young Men – 9 Ghost Stories (2011) has nothing to do with the IRM album with the same name from 2007. It’s a private fascination with dead young artist – Poete maudits – such as Ian Curtis, Georg Trakl and Rudolf Schwarzkogler that I have. My personal pantheon of beautiful heroes. Post-Punk music such as Joy Division and Swans has had huge impact upon my musical development and I always seem to come back to them, they been my favourite bands for almost 20 years now. Black Metal has probably meant more to me than I want to acknowledge, people like Dead became very important during my teens. This music embodied everything that I been looking for during my earlier childhood years – the philosophy of evil, glorification of the villain, violence, destruction and death. Also because I lived in Norrköping, Sweden I had friends playing in some of the “inner black circle bands” Marduk and Abruptum(Marduk guitarist Magnus “Devo” Andersson actually produced Skin Areas second double album Journal Noir/Lithium Path).\n\nSOI: Apart from them (Curtis & Ohlin) having a common bond as wordsmiths and frontmen, were there any other reasons, artistic, personal, or subjectively speaking that made you wish to include the two?\n\nMB: I have a strong, you might call it morbid attraction to romantic artists possessed by death. I believe I share a common pathology with these ‘icons’ or ‘heroes’ and I’ve always used them as a mirrors. In my mid teens Dead was very important, a couple of years later it became Curtis and then Schwarzkogler etc. It’s my private cult of dead young men.\n\nSOI: Yukio Mishima, the Japanese novelist, playwright and poet is also included in the same piece. Asides this, to what length does his cult of ‘exhibitionism’ or narcissism influence you?\n\nMB: Mishima was the only man included in the series that reached the mature age of 45; still he’s very important to the cult because of his narcissistic, impossible quest for beauty and death. His outlook upon life and death is among the most darkly romantic in the whole history of art. His way of rehearsing his own death, compulsively again and again through his work before the grand final and masterpiece at the Ichigaya Camp on November 25, 1970 is just astonishing. I can relate to Mishima’s rigorously staged and perfectly aesthetic photographs of his own death in the same way I can relate to the necro-aesthetic, private theatre of Dennis Nilsen. It is narcissistic not an exhibitionistic identification. I was stunned when I read about Nilsen’s theatre, his solo performances in front of the mirror, the make-up and props that he used, they were all so similar to my own work; my yearning for perfect control in front and behind the camera, on stage/off-stage. The big difference is that Nilsen had to step out of himself and involve other people which resulted in actual death(s).\n\nSOI: When listening to any of your works, or viewing any of your exhibits and pieces, it is hard not to think of Antonin Artaud’s propositions in ‘The Theater And Its Double’. With music and performance, do you intend to evoke a particular response or emotion in an audience?\n\nMB: Artaud was the greatest genius of the 20th century. His theories about a Theatre of Cruelty has had an enormous impact upon my life and work. Although his book on the theatre has never been a blueprint to me, his life and his preoccupation with his own fragmented body which is present throughout his work has been of more importance. To me the art of acting is a pathological search for reinvention, a romantic search for the impossible. The mask I chose to wear takes me to places where I never would have ventured if I hadn’t chosen to put it on, it allows me to inhabit a certain persona, to find mutual references in the ‘other’ which I now feel a new kinship with. This game is obsessive and it sometimes comes close to psychosis. Artaud being the most prominent victim of this art while writing his book on Heliogabalus, when he identified with the decadent boy emperor. I want my theatre to be a private experience which possesses the power to affect an audience at the same time – the implosion of private fantasies evolving into explosive expression.\n\nSOI: Tell me if you would, of your collaborations and work with the former Whitehouse alumni and author Peter Sotos, when and how did that come to fruition?\n\nMB: I meet Peter at a spoken word festival in Stockholm at the beginning of the millennium. We got along well and have kept in touch since. I’m a big admirer of Peter’s work; there’s no one else doing the thing he does – to me he’s one of the last great dangerous writers in the vein of Sade, Genet, Celine and Artaud (no wonder why his work goes down so well in France). When I was working on a Swedish translation of his masterpiece Selfish Little: the Annotated Lesley Ann Downey I came up with the idea of doing a concept album based upon his work. Peter liked the idea and sent me a bunch of sound and video recordings which I used as prima materia for the Dirge album. Peter also did a quite amusing and lengthy interview with me which was supposed to be a foreword to an upcoming DVD anthology of my short films on Cold Meat Industry (which sadly never saw the light of day). The interview can now be found on my webpage and Peter also published it in one of his Waitress compendiums.\n\nSOI: The aesthetic of some of your exhibitions and stage works strongly resemble Hermann Nitsch in their open display of the grotesque, and some performances involve acts of self-harm or mutilation. Whilst many will suggest that art should be boundless, particularly in regard to such taboos, to what extent would you draw the physical line?\n\nMB: There are no lines, limitations or moral obligations involved in art. I’m serious when I claim that Mishima’s suicide and the Nilsen murder theatre are great works of art. SOI: What would be the furthest extent of injury, have there been any instances where an act or infliction may have gone wrong or backfired?\n\nMB: I presume you’re talking about injuries inflicted upon my own body. Well, I never thought about it like that. I don’t try to top or out-do myself when it comes to mutilation or humiliation (like Günter Brus and Chris Burden); I’m not interested in provocation just for the sake of it. There are always risks involved in this kind theatre due to the impossibility to rehearse the pieces before the performances. I had a rather unpleasant experience in London last autumn during a performance of the Island of Death were I cut my thighs so badly that I was plagued by a fever for a couple of days afterwards and thought that I was suffering from blood poisoning, but it turned out OK in the end and now the ‘incident’ is a part of the work’s history.\n\nSOI: Beyond the functional, to what extent would you consider performance to be an expression of ritual and catharsis? In an area of music and art considered by some to be amongst the most subversive and harsh, and as absurd as it may sound to ask, do you ever find an ‘entertainment’ value in the live routine?\n\nMB: I always try to be a bit careful about using the word catharsis, even though the term interests me, both the Aristotelian and Freudian use of it. For the ritualistic nature of my work, I like monotony very much. I guess this structuralism gets close to what the art world refers to as “ritual,” but to me the monotonous repeating of a pattern has more to do with form than some kind of spiritual experience or magic reality. The aim is a painful, sustained process, a monotonous tension; the moment before and after the execution might be as rewarding as the actual act per se; for instance, to watch the reproduction afterwards could be of equal importance to me. There certainly is a border between art and entertainment, but I don’t want to go into that futile discussion. Extreme acts often brings on extreme emotions like repulsion or curiosity, which of course could be looked upon as entertaining, it comes down to a matter of taste.\n\nSOI: Seeing as we all have personal favourites, I ask a cliched, but necessary question. What musical releases and what works of literature are the most pertinent ones to you?\n\nMB: Scott Walker is the only recording artist that really has moved me for years. Otherwise I listen quite a lot to modern composers such as Xenakis, Penderecki, Giacinto Scelsi and Jani Christou. I will always have great affection for bands like Joy Division, Swans, Throbbing Gristle and Whitehouse. Lately I’ve been rather intrigued by the works of authors such as Hans Henny Jahnn, Thomas Bernhard, Paul Celan and E. J Stagnelius.\n\nSOI: The final words are yours. Say what you wish!!!\n\nMB: Thank you for the interview.\n\nhttp://www.martinbladh.com/"
