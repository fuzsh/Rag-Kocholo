        "text": "No.TitleDirected byWritten byOriginal release date [3]1\"The Wounded Angel\"Michelle MacLarenPeter Harness21 February 2024 ( )\n\nJo Ericsson is a Swedish ESA astronaut on the ISS. As NASA astronaut Paul starts an experiment with the CAL, an object hits the ISS, damaging it. Paul is injured and dies, despite the crew's efforts. Jo performs a space walk to assess the damage and sees the object that hit them â€• a desiccated female corpse in a USSR space suit. The other three of the crew board the docked three-seat Soyuz MS spacecraft that is undamaged and return to Earth, while Jo remains to repair and then take the other docked Soyuz MS. On Earth, NASA's experiment leader Henry Caldera insists that Jo bring back the CAL data core, which Roscosmos' flight leader Irena Lysenko allows after being disturbed by Jo's drawing of the USSR corpse. While alone on the ISS, Jo sees a clock speed up, and has a vision of a cupboard with her daughter Alice's necklace on it. Alice and Jo's husband Magnus are flown from their home near the ESA Centre in Cologne, Germany to the Roscosmos cosmodrome in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, to await updates. Five weeks later, Jo late at night drives through a snowy northern Sweden and takes Alice and the data core to an isolated cabin. After Alice falls asleep, Jo hears her voice calling from outside, follows it to an identical but dilapidated cabin, and finds a sickly Alice hiding in a cupboard.\n\n2\"Live and Let Die\"Michelle MacLarenPeter Harness21 February 2024 ( )\n\nJo seemingly blacks out and loses hours of time. Having lost contact with TsuP, she completes repairs and calculates deorbit parameters on her own. The strange occurrences continue, and Jo seemingly hallucinates that Paul is still alive. Jo recovers the CAL data core and records a farewell for Magnus and Alice that she leaves behind on the ISS. As Jo is inside the Soyuz MS and prepares to detach it from the space station, a complication arises that can only be fixed from outside the Soyuz, but the error is mysteriously fixed and Jo sees a shadowy figure watching her from the receding ISS. Jo lands safely and is reunited with her family, but Alice and Magnus are confused when she speaks to them in Swedish. In the flashforward, Jo recognizes the second Alice as \"hers\"; this Alice asks Jo if she is a ghost. Jo brings second Alice back to her cabin, but she disappears, leaving the other Alice that Jo does not recognize.\n\n3\"Somewhere in Space Hangs My Heart\"Oliver HirschbiegelPeter Harness21 February 2024 ( )\n\nJo notices that some of her memories do not match with those around her. No one believes her claim about the USSR corpse, since no cosmonaut has ever died in space; Irena suggests that Jo had a hypoxia-induced hallucination. Jo is given medication she's told are vitamins; Irena and Henry also take them. When alone, Jo sees the cupboard with Alice's necklace on it. While playing hide-and-seek, Alice sees someone stamp on her toy rabbit. The CAL data core only replicates the effect seen on the ISS when Henry is alone; he theorizes this is due to the observer effect. Jo identifies the USSR suit she saw as the same type Irena wore in the 1960s, but she withdraws her claim after she sees Paul at his own memorial. Elsewhere, former astronaut Bud Caldera, who flew on Apollo 18 when two people died, is at a cruise ship convention where he is questioned by author Ian Rogers for inaccuracies in his memoir. Bud blames the Apollo 18 disaster on \"Henry\" and, in a drunken rage, throws Ian overboard. In the flashforward, Jo takes Alice in search of the other cabin, and confirms Alice's suspicion that she is not her mother.\n\n4\"The Left Hand of God\"Oliver HirschbiegelPeter Harness28 February 2024 ( )\n\nJo is increasingly disturbed by differences between her memories and the world around her, including the revelation that she's been having an affair with Frederic, head of ESA. Henry takes the CAL data core to ESA, where Jo has visions when it is active. Henry theorizes that the CAL may have opened a pathway to another universe. Jo realizes that the \"vitamin\" given to her is lithium, which was also secretly given to a handful of other astronauts who displayed erratic behavior during or after their time in space. Jo briefly slips into another universe where cleaners are emptying her office and cannot see her. Jo receives a package from Skagerrak Marine Observatory containing audio recordings made of Jo in the ISS after she had lost contact with TsuP, and of the accidental death of a female cosmonaut in 1967. Alice panics when she slips into the other universe where a wake is being held for Jo; Alice and her doppelganger look at each other. Jo and Magnus fight, and during the struggle Magnus hits his head in a fall. Ian Rogers' death is investigated by the FBI.\n\n5\"Five Miles Out, the Sound Is Clearest\"Oliver HirschbiegelPeter Harness6 March 2024 ( )\n\nJo calls an ambulance for Magnus and flees with Alice. Alice reveals to Jo that she has been seeing the USSR corpse, which she calls \"the Valya\". Jo asks Illya to check their vitamins, and Illya learns that certain historical cosmonaut files have been purged. Jo steals the CAL data core and travels with Alice to Skagerrak Marine Observatory. There, they meet Walberg and Laurenz Bang, who have for decades been making amateur radio recordings of astronauts in space, and have recorded audio of astronaut deaths, only for that astronaut to return to Earth safely afterward. These \"ghost tapes\" become clearer when near the CAL data core. After arriving at the cabin, Jo listens to the recording of her mission where she and Alice had a video chat, and Alice confirms that that Alice is not her. Jo hears her Alice call out to her, while in another universe her Alice searches for Jo in the snowstorm. Henry and Bud are in different universes, but are aware of and have been able to communicate with each other. Henry tells Bud he thinks the CAL made things worse, while Bud is determined to destroy Henry's life.\n\n6\"Paul Is Dead\"Joseph CedarPeter Harness13 March 2024 ( )\n\nIn another universe, the ISS is hit by debris, and Jo is killed when thrown against the cupola. Paul is the astronaut left behind to fix Soyuz 1, during which he keeps hearing the sound of Jo breathing. Alice, upon being told of Jo's death, hides in a cupboard and has a vision of Jo approaching her. NASA allows Paul to leave Jo's corpse on the ISS. Paul faces a complication with the Soyuz that can only be fixed from the outside, but the error is fixed on its own and he sees a shadowy figure watching him from the ISS. After returning safely, Paul is disturbed by differences between his memories and the world he's in, including how the CAL has never existed. Paul and his family attend the wake at the Ericsson house, where Paul and Alice see the other universe where Jo is alive. Paul finds Bud, who realizes he's from a universe where Apollo 18 was a success. When Paul presses for answers, Bud loses his temper and shoots him. Alice insists that Magnus take her to the cabin, where Alice sees Jo arrive as well.\n\n7\"Through the Looking Glass\"Joseph CedarPeter Harness20 March 2024 ( )\n\nWhen Jo leaves the cabin to find her Alice the second time, her lamp falls off the table, causing the cabin to catch fire. The two Alices independently find the dilapidated cabin and enter the same cupboard, where they see each other in the mirror and are able to talk through a recording device. The Alices figure out that Jo is in the wrong universe and does not know how to return. Jo finds the cabin with the \"wrong\" Alice and carries her to safety through the fire. Jo attempts to revive the unconscious Alice, and tells her Alice to return to her father. Henry, Frederic and Magnus arrive at the cabin with the authorities, and Jo is taken away. Henry and Bud switch bodies, allowing Henry to call 911 to save Paul. In the hospital, Alice has a vision where the Valya offers to take her to her mother. Alice wakes up and tells Magnus that they have to get Jo back from Irena.\n\n8\"These Fragments I Have Shored Against My Ruin\"Joseph CedarPeter Harness27 March 2024 ( )"
