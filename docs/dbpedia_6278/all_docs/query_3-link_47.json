        "text": "Financial advice is tricky because it’s a bunch of priority influenced trade-offs. There are many ways to succeed financially, it’s just a question of how: What are the priorities and trade-offs?\n\nOur previous personal finance MUSU was based on the Michael Douglas movie, The Game. In that thriller, Douglas is sent on an adrenaline adventure. We never know if what he lives through is real, or just the game.\n\nThat start up could imitate market crashes, pandemics, and stressful situation. Individual investors would never know if what they live through is real, or just the game.\n\nToday is another personal finance idea.\n\nA lot of advice starts with the idea of goals. What is your goal retirement age? What is your goal retirement income? What are your contribution goals for the kids’ education?\n\nShare your goals, work backward in time, make assumptions, and then generate a plan.\n\nBut as humans, this is difficult to articulate. As we saw with opportunity, cost neglect, if it’s not an obvious choice in front of us, we don’t generate it. I want to retire at 65 and live on 80% of my current expenditures and pay for two college educations. Blah. Generic options like multiple-choice tests in school.\n\nThinking different – please read this book – is hard. So it’s logical to conclude that non-differentiated thinking means that it might not be what a person really wants.\n\nThe pitch: show us your portfolio, and we will tell you your goals.\n\nFor example, someone comes in with a limited portfolio in a bunch of individual stocks. The goals of this person is to rely on luck. Or, someone comes in with $X,000. This is the portfolio of someone who wants to work for twenty more years.\n\nA lot of clients would come in and go oh hell no. That’s good! That reaction creates boundaries to what they truly do/don’t want out of their financial plan.\n\nAdditionally, this presentation could be presented using base rates: People with X at age Y work for Z more years – just like you will unless something changes.\n\nThis is a hard sell because finance is, like Rory Sutherland writes, a “name brand”. People buy financial advice for the same reason they buy name brand products, as downside protection. I don’t need it to be good, our subconscious reasons, I just need it to not be shit. Brands are undifferentiated on purpose!\n\nThe “white suv meme” circulates on the internet and we laugh. But new leads to unexpected factory recalls, disappointed customers, and other monkey wrenches. New/Unproven is not what the customer wants, though it’s better on some dimension. That goes for cars as much as it goes for financial advice. Even if, a little game or a backwards approach might lead to some good ideas.\n\nPaying 1,000 people $1 in interest is different, according to Credit Karma, from paying one person $1,000 in a lottery.\n\nThat same thinking can be applied to electric automobiles.\n\nEighty percent of drivers drive fewer than fifty-five miles each day. Half of all trips are less than five miles. Yet vehicle range is a prominent selling point.*\n\nWe’ve tried to solve the EV problem before but here is another idea.\n\nFuel Rods are rechargeable lithium batteries used for charging phones, bluetooth speakers or headphones, or whatever. But they can be swapped at any Fuel Rod location. You see these at airports. Here is the map of Orlando swap spots.\n\nMost of the time users can recharge on their own schedule. Sometimes users need a fresh swap.\n\nCan EVs do that?\n\nPreviously, we focused on the subjective. The rules of chemistry dictate how quickly an EV can charge but it’s the rules of psychology that influence the enjoyability of the wait.\n\nBut we can change ‘how quick’!\n\nSwap the batteries.\n\nGas stations sell diesel, unleaded, and propane fuels. They sell fat, carbohydrates, and protein calories. Sheetz has the best air pumps. In Florida, my state, an absurd number have car washes too. Why can’t they sell automotive fuel rods too?\n\n* There’s also the availability heuristic. Range is easy to understand and compare so it appears important.\n\nIn Competing Against Luck, Clayton Christiansen‘s book about jobs to be done, he talks about the three jobs groups: functional, social, and emotional. Each depends on the situation.\n\nClayton’s classic example is the milkshake. It functions as nutrition and provides emotional entertainment during a commuter’s morning.\n\nIn the afternoon that same milkshake provides a functional snack and an emotional connection between parent and child as an after-school treat.\n\nLovepop co-founder Wombi Rose talked about the depths those jobs have.\n\n“It’s about helping you with your occasions. We want to make sure you can quickly send a thoughtful and creative gift. We’ve found that everyone wants to be more creative and thoughtful but it takes time. We want to help you with those two challenges. We’ll remind you of those occasions and make it super easy to do something that is creative and thoughtful where what you do is based on your relationship.”\n\nMeaningful messages are costly.\n\nIn high school, one of my made-up start-ups was a celebration card company that sent out cards on your behalf. Rather than your forgetful self, hire us to send Aunt Jan’s card on time every time. As my friends pointed out, it kinda took the charm out of the whole experience.\n\nRory Sutherland, the alchemist, points out that digital wedding invitations work – so long as they’re costly. A song works. A poem worlds. Something that demonstrates an investment works.\n\nLovepop’s attempt is to link people’s lives to the cards they buy. Does your special someone have a certain plant they love, like a Japanese Maple? Do they like a certain animal? There’s a card for that.\n\nJobs gives language to discuss the depths. It’s like the wavelength spectrum. We can only see so much. That’s our visual language. But our tools give us the ability to understand a whole lot more. Just like jobs.\n\nThis is part of the made up start up series.\n\nSpinal Tap, the 1984 mocumentary follows a band of bumbling Brits. In one iconic scene, Christopher Guest (lead guitarist) describes his ‘special’ guitars to Rob Reiner (filmmaker). And their amps which “go to 11”.\n\nBefuddled, Reiner asks why not make eleven ten. Guest replies, because eleven is more than ten.\n\nIt’s an iconic scene.\n\nTen is special thanks to our fingers. Ten is easy thanks to repetition.\n\nOther number bases aren’t intuitive. We are used to ten. Binary counting looks like this: 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000 and so on. We aren’t used to binary but it’s great for computers. Zero and one are simply open and closed circuits electricity races through. This is why computers are amazing, lots of microscopic gates and speedy electrons charging through.\n\nNumbers are only tools and we should use the right tool for the job. This gets us to “three sets of ten”.\n\nThree sets of ten was (is?) the default workout. Three sets of ten curls, presses, pushes, pulls. Three sets of ten sit ups, pull ups, or get ups. Why ten? Our fingers!\n\nHere’s the pitch: three sets of eleven.\n\nThat’s silly. But hold on. There are many examples of what we call ‘Large N small p‘. It’s the Google search effect. Google holds a Large Number of auctions and earns a small percent of each ad buy. Making a few cents each transaction isn’t a great business unless it’s repeated a lot. Sales calls are “a numbers game”. Large N small p also accounts for unlikely events. If someone is ‘one in a million’ there’s eighty people like them just on planet earth.\n\nThree sets of eleven uses the Large N small p effect to make workouts better. Participants only do one more repetition for 10% greater results.\n\nOf the made up start up series this idea is not the best. How could you even sell this? But it’s in the non-obvious explorations that we find the better ones.\n\nA business succeeds by doing three things: creating something people want, getting it to them, and communicating the value. We call this: product, placement, promotion.\n\nHey Siri, search ‘sandbag workout’.\n\nWorkout sandbags are an interesting product because no one wants sandbags. The product is the sandbag but the JTBD is looking like this guy. Or at least more like this guy.\n\nSandbags are also interesting because of their distribution opportunity. DTC opens opportunities blocked by traditional retail and neutralizes the TiVo problem. Channels like Amazon are okay, but shift the comparison metrics to price and stars. Companies that offer good-enough inexpensive options do well on Amazon – not a good tactic here.\n\nLastly, the ‘people also ask’ sandbag section seeds great copywriting. These customer queries reveal wants. And customers want clarity. Searches are full of ‘program’ or ‘workout’ or ‘plan’. People are searching for what Bob Moesta writes are the ‘little hires’. Someone has bought a product, the ‘big hire’, but don’t quite know how to use it. That’s interesting too.\n\n…\n\nPeople take action when their current situation stinks enough, a new solution looks good enough, there’s not too much ambiguity aversion, and their habits aren’t too strong. In his book Moesta puts it this way:\n\n[Push of the malaise + Pull of the solution] > [Anxiety of ambiguity + Habit of the moment]\n\nIf LEFT > RIGHT then action occurs.\n\nPush: everyone wants to be in better shape. Like that guy? Who knows.\n\nPull: sandbags are kinda weird, kinda bro. This may be an opportunity.\n\nAnxiety: people don’t know the ‘little hires’. Big opportunity.\n\nHabit: the workout (or not) of the moment.\n\nIn Unacceptable, the book about the college admission scandal, parents hired help. The aiding advisor advertised high-school-test-prep ads at coffee shops and gyms near the schools. The customer wasn’t the student going to college, it was the parent paying for it. The consumer and ‘little hire’ were different from the customer and ‘big hire’.\n\nSuccessful products serve both groups. This makes the Unacceptable story tragically funny, some students didn’t know, what, or care what their parents did!\n\n…\n\nThis is spitballing. We’d also need to find:\n\nWhere are the ready people? Maybe: in Google searches, Instagram fans, on Reddit forums, listening to personal development podcasts, and so on. What’s our version of the coffee shop?\n\nWhat does ‘zombie revenue’ tell us about why people who buy it but don’t use it?\n\nWhat workout email helps customers make progress?\n\nWhy are sandbags so bro? Is this an opportunity?\n\nEvery business is a trade off. Doing one thing makes other things easier/harder. A team that plays offense fast has less time for their defense to recover. There’s a good way to sell sandbags. Is this it? Only the market knows. But it’s a good mental lift.\n\nThe EV problem is not range. The problem is charging time. “Most electric vehicles today,” said James Frith, “can do an 80% charge in twenty minutes or so. That’s probably slightly longer than people want to stop at a gas station on a long journey, but it’s not unreasonable.”\n\nWhile technically correct it is psychologically wrong. The problem isn’t “twenty minutes”. The problem is “gas station”.\n\nWhen I started driving, gas stations were dirty. In high school, I worked manual labor and we rated the gas stations on how horrible they were. They were bad even to a crew of teenage and twenty-year-old boys working for an asphalt company.\n\nBut gas stations have gotten better as they have become less like gas stations. Buc-ee’s – a Texan invention – is a gas station that became a tourist destination. People want to stop. That seems like the kind of place someone could spend twenty minutes.\n\nSo it’s not the wait, it’s the quality.\n\nThere are different forms of twenty minutes. A twenty-minute wait in the McDonald’s drive-thru is different from a twenty-minute nap while your wife and daughters go to a craft store. You’re frustrated by the first and delighted by the second.\n\nThe classic gas station is the wrong model and the industry changes reflect that. An ideal charging station then is a nice place to spend twenty minutes. It’s a place to buy coffee and food and use a nice bathroom. Maybe there’s a playground or park? It should have solar so customers get a psychic reward for their time.\n\nAnother avenue is to ask where do people already wait twenty minutes? Fast-casual meals are at least twenty minutes. Twenty minutes is the length of an episode of The Good Place. Headspace could use charging stations as a customer acquisition channel – we all could use a little less stress on the not-so-open roads.\n\nIn Alchemy Rory Sutherland suggests that we invest too much in physics rather than psychological solutions. Physics, like battery technology, is hard because the rules don’t change. Psychology is easier because sometimes the rules change. What’s a long wait in one case is a short one in another. That’s how to solve the EV equation.\n\n…\n\nI wrote about Headspace here and “personal recharging” is a great opportunity.\n\nThis is part of the made up start up series.\n\nMy mother-in-law has a problem when she goes out to eat. The problem is a combination of information, imagination, and conceptualization. The problem is: my mother-in-law doesn’t know what to order.\n\nBut she’s 70 years old. She has solutions. Is it familiar? Is there a picture? Is it recommended? Everything she orders falls into those three buckets. And thanks to Covid19 all that can change.\n\nPart of the (uneven) Covid19 strategy are QR menus. These codes mostly link to a pdf version of the old menu. Consequently, these menus mostly suck. PDF or HTML menus take all of the worst parts of ordering food and make them more difficult to see. But things don’t have to be this way. QR codes for menus are the perfect opportunity for this peripheral technology to become a main course.\n\nHere’s the pitch: a startup that builds interactive menus.\n\nThis is a hard problem. Restaurants are hectic, restaurant retention is tough, and there’s not a lot of excess capital for investment, but QR code menus may be a wise pairing thanks to framing.\n\nRestaurant menus are terrible at framing. A paper menu is static and the only form of framing is the relative price framing. I’m not buying the most expensive or cheapest so this middle item seems fine. A digital menu can be dynamic. The options for choice architecture are abundant.\n\nGuests who liked this also liked this.\n\nThe chef recommends this with that.\n\nAdd in this appetizer for only $3 more.\n\nThis item has been ordered 1,000 times this month.\n\nAll this startup needs is a few salespeople, a copy of Cialdini’s Influence, and an AWS account!\n\nRestaurants are hired for multiple jobs: food, atmosphere, social status, signaling, and so on. Restaurants are also hired to make things easier: I don’t have to cook, clean, plan, or shoulder the burden of honey-what-is-for-dinner-tonight? A well built menu can reduce the diner’s decision demand.\n\nThis startup isn’t obvious because customers won’t articulate why they had a nice time at Dariano’s Diner but they will have a nice time because it’s a better experience which begins with the menu.\n\nYes, there are many restaurants to sell to – but this startup is competing with non-consumption. This isn’t a better reservation system (though it could be) or a better procurement provider (it could be that too), it only has to be better than a PDF or webpage.\n\nSo join me in raising funds for some QR IQ, a business that will build on human psychology to create a better dining experience.\n\nMarch 3, 2022 update: This works! At least for automotive. The full video is here but according to one ex-industry person the digital signing of documents can increase (via framing I’d wager!!) back-end profits by 25%.\n\nThis post is part of the made up startup series.\n\nHealth is a good proxy, like with finance and fitness, for understanding systems because it involves personal choice, design, social factors, marketing, culture, and so on.\n\nPart of the reasons diets, like the diet formerly known as Weight Watchers, work is design. One design is zero point foods, like bananas. Zero points isn’t zero calories but it is zero thought. The primal diets do the same thing. Carbs bad, meat good. Fasting also succeeds due to good design. Vegetarian too. The best diets combine easy rules and identity.\n\nHere’s the pitch: the birthday cake diet or BCD.\n\nThe first product would be a book. Or, better, a self-help book! It would outline all the advantages of better eating, all the research of behavioral scientists, and all the philosophy around intentionality and purpose. Tolle meets Tversky to defeat Tollhouse. The pitch is: the only junk food you would ever eat would be birthday cakes.\n\nPeople could just decide to only eat birthday cakes. But then again there’s a fasting app that’s essentially just a timer — and it’s a great idea! The BCD frames inaction (not eating) as action (waiting for a birthday cake). Annie Duke I know would approve.\n\n‘Okay’ you’re thinking, ‘it’s not just birthday cake that’s bad for you.’ True. So after the first book about the why, comes the second book with the how. Taking a page from WW, the second book used slices of cake as the metric. One cookie? One slice of cake. Chips? One slice. A granola bar? Half a slice. Pizza? Half a slice. Bananas? Free! It’s not as clean as the points system, but framing things as a slice of cake definitely will change some consumption patterns.\n\nThe books will kickstart the funding needed for recurring revenue. Birthday cake as a service anyone? BCAAS! The BCD wouldn’t even need to create products. This business white labels ones from the big bakers or leverages the identity and design ease to create Keto ones or whatever. Plus birthdays are regular events. The Total Addressable Market is everyone every year.\n\nThe BCD is super social media friendly. Like cheat day posts on Instagram, the BCD sells the experience of blowing out the birthday. You haven’t had cake all year, how about one that’s five feet across? The BCD is shareable. Imagine the local, regional, and national news. This is so influencer friendly. Is a low CAC tastier than birthday cake? We will find out.\n\nSo email me to sign up and join the next great eating revolution: the birthday cake diet.\n\n…\n\nThis posts are too much fun. Somehow this is the second Birthday themed post, here is the birthday bet. In college a friend framed regular beer as having a ham sandwich and light beer as not. I still think of that when I see a can of Budweiser.\n\nPeople love IKEA, to the effect of nearly one billion annual visits. The flat pack furniture and furnishings yields twenty-four billion euros in revenue each year. But could there be more in store for this store of galore?\n\nOne way to find business opportunities is to observe users and follow their lead. Instagram for example, developed both polls and shops (in-part) because users hacked those features before they were available. IKEA faces a similar opportunity.\n\nIf you’ve never been, IKEA is organized as an upstairs showroom and a downstairs warehouse. When a customer likes a lamp upstairs they note the aisle and bin code and when downstairs find the item. An upstairs room might look like this:\n\nFor larger item like couches and shelves, customers do the above and haul, unbox, and assemble their purchase. Flat packs, material selection, design choices, and scale all contribute to IKEA’s success.\n\nHere’s the pitch: IKEA as a service.\n\nThe upstairs showrooms have appealing arrangements. It’s modern. It’s clean! For this made up start up an IKEA specialist comes to customer’s home to clean and arrange it in the flat packer’s fashion. The program includes a points program, where customers earn points toward future delivery and installation of IKEA products.\n\nAn IKEA saas offers a few advantages: recurring revenue, reduced churn, and a chance to grow their customer base. Wow Mike the house looks great, someone might say and of course I would tell them about the service, and offer my IKEA referral code.\n\nConsider cleaning a car. My car isn’t new but it looks new after a good cleaning. The same thing occurred to college-me while shopping at The Gap. It wasn’t the clothes that looked good, it was the manikins! If I wanted to look good it wasn’t the clothes I needed, it was the body. Some number of people must do this at IKEA. Their goal is appearance and one way for that job-to-be-done is buying IKEA products.\n\nThe IKEA effect may be taken but this saas business might have great legs, like the beautiful bamboo ones available at IKEA.\n\n–\n\nMade up start ups is an ongoing series. They’re intended to be half-tongue-in-cheek and half-serious. The point is thinking in different ways, like Tyrone.\n\nEdit: this was drafted in late 2019.\n\nI loved the movie The Game. The premise was that for his birthday, Michael Douglas’s character was ‘attacked’ in a real life adventure. It was part thrill, part horror. I can’t even remember how much of it was real.\n\n‘What is real’ is a common premise in my favorite movies.\n\nPart-of-the-reason I like it is because it holds a truth. Without skin-in-the-game we really don’t know what we would do. There are our stated and revealed preferences. There are our human biases. There are the ways something is presented.\n\nIt’s a real quagmire and something Sallie Krawcheck noted when she spoke on The Long View podcast:\n\n“Ya’ll probably know this as well or better than I do, but when you ask someone what their risk tolerance is, nobody knows it until they go through an ’07 or ’08. They just don’t. Let’s call a spade a spade. But we answer it. Men will answer it and women will go, I need to figure out what it is.”\n\nSallie Krawcheck\n\nAccording to Daniel Kahneman, we’re answering an easier question. Instead of what is my risk tolerance we probably answer something like how do I feel today or which column of returns looks good? We do the same thing when choosing college.\n\nHere’s the pitch: Taking a cue from David Fincher and Krawcheck, we’ll create a company that coaches financial advisors on how to stage Doomsday Days with their clients. Like for Douglas, the clients won’t know when it will happen (and we’ll hide this feature in a bunch of legalese).\n\nThe plan would be to make up financial statements that mimicked actual downturns; 1953, 1981, 2008, etc. Clients would come in for their regular meetings, be presented with a fictionalized loss for twenty minutes, and then have a debrief session. It’s the financial equivalent of a false positve lung cancer diagnosis.\n\nDuring the debrief the advisor could talk about real feelings of loss, of risk, and pain. Then, together, work out a new plan.\n\nAs advisors are already busy, the business would sell them a script. They could choose a level of pain, and we would provide the portfolio forms (printed on very formal looking paper) as well as suggestions on handling the psychology of it. As an upset we could offer “Confederate Coordination” as we called the wife and explained the plan to her. Yes, it would have to be, the wife."
