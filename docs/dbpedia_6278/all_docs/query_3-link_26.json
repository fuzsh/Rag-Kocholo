        "text": "As our theatrical calendar attests, there will be plenty of reasons to leave the house this summer. But for those times when you'd prefer to stay in, there's a wide array of American indies, international hits, and exquisite documentaries right at your fingertips on demand, online or on DVD. Here's what will be coming to your televisions, computer screens, Netflix queues and store shelves from May through July. On Demand As always, our sister company IFC Films will release some of the biggest festival favorites from around the world this summer both at theaters and on demand, allowing people to choose what size screen they want to see Johnnie To's actioner \"Vengeance\" (May 14), Ken Loach's soccer drama \"Looking for Eric\" (May 21), the Cillian Murphy-Brendan Gleeson gangster tale \"Perrier's Bounty\" (May 21), Mia Hansen-Løve's French family drama \"The Father of My Children\" (May 28), \"Bronson\" director Nicolas Winding Refn's Viking epic \"Valhalla Rising\" (June 4), the doc \"Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work\" (June 11), the incendiary Jessica Alba-Casey Affleck thriller \"The Killer Inside Me\" (June 18) and Agnès Jaoui's dramedy \"Let It Rain\" (June 25). Meanwhile, the Sundance Selects label will premiere \"Convention,\" AJ Schnack's documentary about the 2008 Democratic National Convention, on May 12th before a New York run at the IFC Center in June. Meanwhile, IFC Films will also exclusively debut plenty of international hits via VOD on their Festival Direct label, which will bring home Ryosuke Hashiguchi's drama \"All Around Us\" (May 5), the British \"shockumentary\" \"The Possession of David O'Reilly\" (May 5), \"The Celebration\" director Thomas Vinterberg's latest comedy \"When a Man Comes Home\" (May 12), the Joshua Jackson road trip drama \"One Week\" (May 19), and Caroline Link's follow-up to her Oscar-winning \"Nowhere in Africa,\" the drama \"A Year Ago in Winter\" (June 11). Magnolia Pictures has also scoured the globe for some of the best films around and will deliver five festival favorites to living rooms across the country a month in advance of their release dates in theaters through their Ultra VOD service. Things kick off with George A. Romero's latest zombie thriller \"Survival of the Dead\" (May 28), followed by Neil Jordan's \"Ondine\" (May 7), starring Colin Farrell as a fisherman who believes he hooks a mermaid in this fairy tale; the claustrophobic Spanish horror flick \"[REC] 2\" (June 4), the sequel to the film that inspired the American horror hit \"Quarantine\"; \"The Extra Man\" (June 25), the new comedy from \"American Splendor\" directors Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini starring Paul Dano and Kevin Kline; and \"Centurion\" (July 23), a Roman action epic from \"The Descent\" director Neil Marshall starring Michael Fassbender and Dominic West, arriving on VOD well before its August 27th release in theaters. Finally, there's a new kid on the block with Red Flag Releasing, which will be putting out the Sundance-selected doc \"8: The Mormon Proposition,\" about the religious group's influence on the California referendum on same-sex marriages in 2008 (narrated by \"Milk\" screenwriter Dustin Lance Black), on VOD day-and-date with its release in theaters. Those folks at Cinetic FilmBuff are no fools -- just in time for World Cup season, they picked up the rights to the soccer doc \"Pelada,\" which will debut on VOD on June 7th before being released online through iTunes and Amazon on Demand. Seen through the eyes of two college players who didn't make the pros, the film won raves at SXSW, Sarasota and IFF Boston for its look at the sport's impact throughout the world. It won't be the only sports-themed doc that Cinetic will be releasing this summer -- tennis fans should take note of \"Unstrung,\" a film about seven junior tennis players trying to make it to the next level, which will be released via iTunes and Amazon VOD in June, and Richard Linklater's ode to University of Texas baseball coach Augie Garrido, \"Inning by Inning: Portrait of a Coach,\" that will arrive on Hulu in July. Other exciting FilmBuff titles include \"Icons Among Us,\" Michael Rivoira's thorough history of contemporary jazz featuring interviews with everyone from Herbie Hancock to Terence Blanchard to Medeski, Martin and Wood, that will debut on iTunes day-and-date with its DVD release on May 11th, followed by a cable VOD run in June before July, which will give way to the VOD debut of Aleksandr Sokurov's \"The Sun\" and the iTunes debut of Wong Kar-wai's \"Fallen Angels\" and \"Happy Together.\" For further updates, you can follow them on Twitter.If you thought the 113 films coming to theaters between May through July is a lot, consider that Gravitas Ventures will release roughly the same amount on VOD during the same amount of time. While you can follow the company on Twitter and Facebook to keep up to date with all their releases, their summer slate includes the May releases of the Andy Griffith comedy \"Play the Game,\" the Lance Henriksen-Bill Moseley post-apocalyptic action series \"Godkiller\" (trailer), the acclaimed b-ball drama \"American Streetball\" and Zeke Zelker's racy romantic thriller \"In Search Of.\" In June, Gravitas will deliver \"American Grindhouse\" (June 1) home to VOD, the first place anywhere people will be able to see this history of exploitation films, narrated by Robert Forster, after its world premiere at SXSW. Other films making their VOD premieres in June include the Dave Boyle arrested development comedy \"White on Rice\" (June 1), the excellent political doc \"Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story\" (June 1), and \"Elsewhere\" (trailer), a small-town thriller starring \"Up in the Air\"'s Anna Kendrick. Gravitas also has an exciting July planned with the VOD premieres of \"Nightmares in Red White and Blue\" (July 1), Andrew Monument's history of American horror films with interviews with genre legends like John Carpenter and Wes Craven, the John Heard-Brendan Sexton III thriller \"The Truth\" (July 1), Madeleine Sackler's recent Tribeca Film Fest doc selection \"The Lottery\" (July 8), which takes on New York's education system, and the eagerly awaited American debut of \"IP Man\" (July 27), the Donnie Yen-starring kung fu quest that took home the 2009 Hong Kong Film Award for Best Film. You'll notice in our theatrical preview that there's a deluge of films streaming through New York's Tribeca Cinemas in May, but fear not if you don't live in Manhattan -- Tribeca Film launched a VOD program along with their festival in late April that allowed many of their hits to stream directly to your home if you happen to have Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Cablevision, Cox Communications, Verizon FiOS, Bright House Networks, RCN, and Bresnan Communications for a cable or satellite provider. Through June 20th, you can catch these 2010 Tribeca selections: \"Jackass\" director Jeff Tremaine's BMX doc \"The Birth of Big Air,\" the Tilda Swinton-narrated global warming doc \"Climate of Change,\" the Omid Djalili culture clash comedy \"The Infidel,\" the animated sci-fier \"Metropia,\" Dev Benegal's drama \"Road, Movie,\" Andy Serkis' Ian Dury biopic \"sex & drugs & rock & roll\" and the Jay Baruchel comedy \"The Trotsky.\" Tribeca Film also is releasing past festival favorites on VOD, including the British romcom \"My Last Five Girlfriends,\" David Russo's \"The Immaculate Conception of Little Dizzle,\" Måns Herngren's synchronized swimming comedy \"The Swimsuit Issue,\" Julien Nitzberg's crazed Appalachian-based doc \"The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia\" and the Jac Schaeffer comedy \"TiMER.\" And sports fans should take note of the titles Tribeca is making available for free: Jon Frankel's inner city high school football doc \"Hellfighters,\" Spike Lee's \"Kobe Doin' Work,\" Albert Maysles and Bradley Kaplan's boxing doc \"Muhammad and Larry,\" and the Sebastian Telfair doc \"Through the Fire.\" Online IndieFlix will be adding to their considerable library throughout the summer, but with the temperature rising, it's only appropriate that they're shining a light on hot up-and-coming filmmakers by presenting 10 new short films from the American Film Institute (including \"Sun (dust),\" pictured left) and beginning on May 20th, they will also host the Seattle International Film Festival's online Future Wave competition, where filmmakers 18 years old or younger will vie for a special honor at this year's festival.
