        "text": "Some excerpts from my interview with Samantha Shannon, which appeared in the August State of the Thing newsletter. Samantha is the author of The Bone Season, the first volume in a seven-part series, released just yesterday by Bloomsbury.\n\nDo you recall which part of The Bone Season came to you first? Was there a particular moment that inspired the novel?\n\nI was doing an internship at a literary agency in Seven Dialsâa junction in London where seven streets meetâwhen I had the idea. I imagined a girl having the exact same day at work that I was, but she happened to be clairvoyant.\n\nThe Bone Season is set in 2059, but in an alternate world which diverged from our own in 1859. Iâd love to hear how you set about developing the universe in which the novel takes place, and the sorts of things you had to consider as you did so.\n\nI wanted my clairvoyant society to be a cross-section of historical types of divination, so I did quite a lot of reading about classical and Renaissance impressions of augury, soothsaying and so on. Scion evolved in my mind as a response to the criminal underworld (whereas in the story itself itâs vice versa), and I did a lot of thinking about how to create a believable world in which clairvoyance is persecuted, and about what the people of Scion might hear, see, feel and think in their everyday lives.\n\nMuch of The Bone Season is set in what was once Oxford (where you have, I should note, recently finished your undergraduate career). What was it about Oxford that made it work well as the setting?\n\nOxford was perfect for The Bone Season. Although itâs a modern place in many respects, there are still vestiges of archaism and tradition, and its spectrum of old buildings, from various centuries, give it an eerie sense of being frozen in time.\n\nWho are some of the authors you particularly admire or whoâve had some influence on your own writing?\n\nMargaret Atwoodâs novel The Handmaidâs Tale was what first got me interested in dystopian and speculative fiction, alongside Orwell and Wyndham. I specialised in Emily Dickinson at university; her poetry inspired many of the themes I want to explore in later Bone Season books.\n\nWhat books have you read and enjoyed recently?\n\nI just finished The Gamal, the debut of Irish novelist CiarÃ¡n Collins, which I thoroughly enjoyed. At the moment Iâm reading the second book in the Hunger Games trilogy, Catching Fire.\n\nSamantha also talked to me about working with Imaginarium Studios on the film version of The Bone Season, and told me what sheâs liked most about the publishing process. Read the rest of our interview.\n\nIf youâd like to receive our State of the Thing newsletter, you can add it in your email preferences. Youâll need have to have an email address listed.\n\nSome excerpts from my interview with Paul Collins, which appeared in the July State of the Thing newsletter. Paul teaches in the MFA program at Portland State University, and is the author of many books, including Sixpence House: Lost in a Town of Books, The Book of William, and more. Heâs also NPRâs âliterary detective,â and writes for a wide variety of publications. His new book, Duel with the Devil was published in June by Crown.\n\nIn Duel with the Devil you tell the story of a gruesome 1799 New York City murder case in which a young womanâs suitor is accused of causing her death. The young man puts together something of a âdream teamâ of defense lawyers: who were his attorneys, and how did he manage to obtain such impressive counsel?\n\nThe defendant, Levi Weeks, managed to get the three best lawyers in NYC: Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr, and Brockholst Livingston. Weeks was a construction foreman, but his brother Ezra Weeks happened to be the most successful developers in the cityâand Hamilton and Burr were both clients of his! Hamilton in particular was running up an impressive tab (which he couldnât pay) having Weeks build him a mansion, so he certainly owed a favor.\n\nI might add that while Livingstonâs the least known of the trio, he was no slacker himself: the guy was later appointed to the Supreme Court.\n\nThis wasnât the only time Hamilton and Burr found themselves on the same side of a courtroom, right? What others sorts of cases did they cooperate on?\n\nThey usually worked on commercial casesâproperty disputes, insurance cases over lost ships, that sort of thing. They were often on opposite sides, but not alwaysâin fact, right before this case, theyâd wrapped up a monster settlement for a client named Louis Le Guen. Since Aaron Burr was even worse with money than Hamilton, he promptly asked Le Guen for a loan!\n\nYouâve got one of the best titles out there, as NPRâs âliterary detective.â Iâd love to hear a bit about how you seek out the sorts of fascinating historical stories you like to tell: do you go in search of them, or do they tend to be just things youâve stumbled across in the course of other research and then decide to follow up on?\n\nOften Iâll just grab random old newspapers and magazines (in libraries or online) and start snooping, but a surprising amount of the time itâs weird, random stuff I find while looking up something else. Chance favors the prepared mind and all that.\n\nOn this book in particular, though, a lot of the small and odd details came pretty systematicallyânamely, I read through nearly every available Manhattan newspaper from 1799 and 1800. Thatâs not quite as insane as it sounds, because newspapers back then were 4 pages long! Still, it was thousands of pages, but thatâs always my favorite part of writingâwandering through those lost-dog notices and molasses shipments and yellow fever quack cures. Probably a whole bunch of other stories will now spin off from that experience.\n\nWhat books have you read and enjoyed recently?\n\nThe British Library recently reissued Andrew Forresterâs Victorian pulper The Female Detective (1864), which Iâd never read before and was fascinated by. As a writer, I really love the premise of Alexandra Horowitzâs new book On Lookingâbasically, walking around the same NYC neighborhood eleven times with different kinds of experts observing it each time. And as someone fascinated by disastrously bad movies, Iâm excited to see Tom Bissellâs upcoming The Disaster Artist, about the making of âThe Room.â I was actually with Tom the first time either of us saw it, andâ¦wow. Justâ¦wow.\n\nAlso, Iâve just come off a Wodehouse reading jag. After eight or nine of his books in row I felt like Iâd consumed an entire sheet cake, but itâs a testament to him that, well, Iâm seriously thinking of reading a tenth.\n\nBut wait, thereâs more! Find out what Paulâs working on now, and about some surprising tidbits heâs found during his researches. Read the rest of our interview.\n\nIf youâd like to receive our State of the Thing newsletter, you can add it in your email preferences. You also have to have an email address listed.\n\nFor the July State of the Thing newsletter, I interviewed Travis McDade about his second book, Thieves of Book Row, published in June by Oxford University Press. Travis is curator of rare books at the University of Illinois College of Law, where he teaches a class called âRare Books, Crime & Punishment.â\n\nSet the scene for us, if you would, by providing a brief description of what Book Row was like during its heyday. Is there anyplace even comparable today?\n\nBook Row was six blocks of Manhattanâs Fourth Avenue packed with bookstores and personalities. Most of these shops were run by men who had learned the trade at the elbow of other booksellers, so there was a well-earned knowledge of the book business, of lower Manhattan and of other booksellersâ aptitudes. These guys were well-read and hard-nosed. There is a tendency now to look back with the sort of nostalgic, moonlight-and-magnolia gloss we often do with the recent pastâand some of that is deservedâbut Book Row wasnât Disneyland. It was a labor of love for many of these guys, but it was definitely a labor. And life in Manhattan in the early 20th century was no picnic.\n\nThere are places now that have clusters of bookshopsâHay-on-Wye in the west of England springs to mindâbut nothing like Book Row. What made it unique was a combination of these personalities, certain historical economic forces, and the nature of New York City at the time. It couldnât have existed anywhere else, and it canât exist now.\n\nThe theft ring you write about in Thieves of Book Row was no fly-by-night operation: these guys were organized! Give us a sense of how the operation worked, who was involved, and the impact these thefts had on the book and library world of the time.\n\nLike most cottage industries, it developed organically. It started out as just some guys stealing books and selling them to shopsâthe classic American story!âand it grew from there. A confluence of events made this theft ring, like Book Row itself, possible. By the second half of the 1920s, there was reliable transportation, a decent economy and a rise in the value of a certain type of books. These books, as it happened, were sitting on the open stacks of libraries all over the American northeast, most librarians not even imagining they were worth the effort to steal. Once, at least, they had been right about that. But by the 1920s, it made good business sense to send men from Manhattan to Worcester, Massachusetts, to steal half a dozen books, if the men could then easily move on and hit Lancaster, Leominster, Gardner, etc. The thieves would get paid a standard rate of $2 per book and the bookstores would sell them for anything from $25 to $1,000.\n\nJust to give an indication of how large the theft ring was, by the time it came to an end, the major problem was not getting the books out of libraries but finding places to store the surplus.\n\nOne of the key thefts you focus on in the book is the snatching of a copy of Poeâs Al Araaf from the New York Public Library. What made this particular book such a desirable commodity at the time? And how did that theft turn out for the thieves in the end?\n\nAl Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems was Poeâs second publication, but the first to use his name. Like much of his early work, because it had not been popular, few copies were saved. This, coupled with the fact that the value of Poe works had been party to an inexorable upward climb for three decades, made it a hot commodity.\n\nIâve tried to get my head around the âwhyâ of the theft. The question âwhat were they thinkingâ is often hard to understand in retrospect, and I confess I canât be sure what the answer is. The theft from the New York Public Library seems to me a great deal like awaking a slumbering giant. The NYPL employed a man whose sole job was to keep its books safeâa unique position at the timeâand had powerful allies in the city. When there were so many other compliant victims out there, why would anyone want to give the NYPL a reason to get involved? Recklessness? Spite? Because it was there? I donât know, but it spelled doom for the theft ring.\n\nTell us about the research for this book. What sorts of sources did you find that allowed you to reconstruct this theft ring and its deeds so thoroughly?\n\nThis book started out as a small part of a chapter in a larger book, when my only sources were a few newspaper articles and a New York appellate court case. Then I stumbled across a memoir that had a few pages on the theft and, very quickly after that, an article in a book collecting magazine from 1933. Each of these offered their own bits of information, each was written in an entirely different voice and each at different removes from the scene of the crime. Most of my previous research was based on court and law enforcement recordsâdry, fact-based, close-in-time material. The writing of this book, typified by those first sources, required me to draw on a range of much different sources to create a narrative.\n\nBooksellersâ memoirsâeven if they did not mention this crime, or Book Rowâwere great, adding a certain life to the book. But there were also other types of first-person reporting that was extremely helpful: correspondence, court testimony, depositions, etc. These are more raw than memoir, because they arenât meant for public consumption, and so offer up little facts that a person would not ordinarily think to include in a more formal record.\n\nI also read a lot of fiction from the time. Most of this was not helpful, except for providing context, but some bits and pieces made it into the story. There is even a little humor in the book, if you look hard enough. For example, I rely on a 1920s article from The New Yorker, at one point, to add levity to a passage; so you can probably guess that what humor exists is bone dry.\n\nFor more on Thieves of Book Row, what Travis is reading now, and a bit about what heâs working on next, read the rest of our interview.\n\nIf youâd like to receive our State of the Thing newsletter, you can add it in your email preferences. Youâll need to have an email address listed.\n\nFor the May State of the Thing newsletter, I had the chance to interview Julie Wu about her debut novel The Third Son (Algonquin Books). Julie studied literature at Harvard and medicine at Columbia, and received a 2012 fellowship from the Massachusetts Cultural Council. She lives near Boston.\n\nCan you tell us about the origins of The Third Son? Do you recall which part of the story came to you first?\n\nMy first inkling of the main character was in 1989. I was sitting in my parentsâ suburban Boston kitchen and suddenly had the image of a little boy on the floor of his parentsâ house in Taiwan. It was the first time Iâd ever visualized a scene so vividly. I rushed to my typewriter to record the musty smell, the dark floorboards, and the boyâs sadness. Thinking back on it now, I believe that boy was Saburo.\n\nHow did the story change during the research and writing process?\n\nIn 1989 I tried to make that boy the protagonist of a different book entirelyâone set in contemporary suburban America in a Taiwanese-American household. That book stalled when I asked my parents questions for background information and I realized how boring my book was in comparison with their actual lives. I was resistant, though, to the idea of basing a book on my parentsâ story.\n\nIt was 2002 when I finally sat down to interview my parents in earnest. I was pregnant with my first child and maybe had gained some perspective, as well as an understanding that my opportunities to find out my parentsâ stories were finite. My first draft was very much based on their lives, but over the following years I learned that in order to make the story a universally appealing, cohesive, suspenseful, and satisfying work, I would have to feel absolutely free to take liberties with the story, the plot, the characters, etc. Now the book is its own self-contained story. Of course, despite that I made every effort to make sure the book is historically accurate.\n\nThe early sections of the book are set in Taiwan during a particularly tumultuous period in its history (which Iâd venture to guess many of your American readers probably wonât be familiar with). Can you recommend some further reading on the history of Taiwan that interested readers might turn to?\n\nThereâs a classic work by George Kerr called Formosa Betrayed. George Kerr was an American diplomat at the time of the February 28 massacres in 1947, and his account of the events on Taiwan and his colleaguesâ efforts to get the American government to intervene are both devastating and eye-opening.\n\nAnother interesting account is Peng Ming-Minâs autobiography, A Taste of Freedom: Memoirs of a Formosan Independence Leader, in which he describes his arrest for trying to distribute a manifesto for Taiwanese independence. Peng conceals the details of his dramatic escape to Sweden to protect his friends, but more recently, in the book Fireproof Moth, American missionary Milo Thornberry describes exactly how he and others helped mastermind Pengâs escape. There are museums in Taiwan that document the events of 1947 and the subsequent White Terror. These include the Taipei 228 Museum, the National 228 Museum, Jing-Mei Human Rights Memorial Park (a former military court prison) in Taipei, as well as the Green Island Human Rights Memorial Park on Green Island, on the site of the offshore prison where long-term political prisoners were held. The website associated with the Green Island museum is maintained by its designer, Ronald Tsao, and is quite extensive and informative: http://2011greenislanden.wordpress.com.\n\nWhen and where do you do most of your writing?\n\nI write mostly in my dining room and in the public library. I probably get the most done in the library, because there Iâm not distracted by the pantry and the refrigerator, and Iâm too embarrassed to sit around just doing Facebook.\n\nAny particular writing tips youâd like to share?\n\nDonât worry about getting stuff out fast. Make your work the best it can be. Agents and editors are just people like everyone else. If tons of them donât connect to your work, that means tons of other readers wonât either. If that matters to you, figure out why and fix it.\n\nWhatâs your library like? What sorts of books would we find on your shelves?\n\nMy library is a jumble of all kinds of booksâhigh-falutinâ French literature from college that I canât understand anymore, Taiwanese history books, parenting books and travel guides, medical textbooks, and, of course stacks, and stacks of wonderful novels of all genres, famous and not-so-famous, many of them authored by friends.\n\nFor more about Julieâs next project, some of her favorite libraries, and more, read the rest of our interview.\n\nIf youâd like to receive our State of the Thing newsletter, you can add it in your email preferences. You also have to have an email address listed.\n\nSome excerpts from my interview with Jennifer McVeigh, which appeared in the May State of the Thing newsletter. Jennifer studied English literature at Oxford and has worked in the film, television and radio industries. Her debut novel, The Fever Tree, was published by Amy Einhorn Books/Putnam in April.\n\nGive us, if you would, The Fever Tree in a nutshell, for those who havenât yet had a chance to read it.\n\nThe Fever Tree is a novel about a woman who is forced to leave behind everything she has ever known, and emigrate to South Africa to marry a man she barely knows. Itâs a novel about a country in the making, about diamonds and disease, love and redemption.\n\nWhat part of the novel came to you first?\n\nMy husband and I were driving across the hot, dusty plains of Namibia in Southern Africa, when we passed a high wire fence cordoning off a diamond mine. I remember thinkingâwho were the men who first came here to mine for diamonds? What kind of lives did they lead, without running water or sanitation? And who were the women who came with them? When I came back to England I did some research, and became fascinated with the early days of the diamond rush in South Africa, when men travelled hundreds of miles to the diamond fields with little more than the shirts on their backs, and when fortunes could be won and lost on the luck of uncovering a stone.\n\nWhat were some of the historical sources you found most interesting and useful as you wrote The Fever Tree?\n\nI drew on a huge range of historical sources. The British Library was particularly useful, and it was there that I poured over guide books to South Africa, written in the 1880s, read Victorian newspapers published on the diamond fields, and discovered the diary which told the story of a smallpox epidemic which raged on the diamond minesâthe true story which lies at the heart of the book. But there were other sources. It was in Kimberley, the famous diamond mining town, that I came across a book of old photographs taken on the diamond mines, which made real for me the lives of the men, women and children who camped in tents, in the dust and the filth, on the diamond fields, hoping to make their fortune.\n\nHow did your own experiences traveling in southern Africa come into play as you wrote the novel?\n\nWhen I travelled in South Africa, I was fascinated and unsettled by its dark concoction of pioneer spirit and racism, by the brutality of its urban landscapesâwith their sprawling townships which spoke of labour migration and forced evictionsâand the astounding beauty and wildness of its countryside. These contradictions, I realised, had their roots in my storyâin the discovery of diamonds, when men like Cecil Rhodes, driven by greed, used their political influence to create an economy based on lines of race. The more I learned, the more I was able to make sense of what I had seen in South Africa, and the people and attitudes that confronted me.\n\nWhen and where do you do most of your writing?\n\nOnce the research is out of the way, most of the actual writing is done at home. At my desk, in bed, standing by the toaster. Anywhere where I can catch myself off guard and get words down on paper.\n\nBut wait, thereâs more! Read the rest of our interview.\n\nIf youâd like to receive our State of the Thing newsletter, you can add it in your email preferences. You also have to have an email address listed.\n\nFor the May State of the Thing newsletter, I had the chance to interview Colum McCann, winner of the 2009 National Book Award in fiction for Let the Great World Spin. His new novel, TransAtlantic, will be published on June 4 by Random House.\n\nTransAtlantic opens with three stories of voyages to Ireland: Frederick Douglass in 1845, Jack Alcock and Teddy Brown in 1919, and George Mitchell in 1998. How did you decide on these three, and were there other voyages that you considered using and decided not to?\n\nI suppose that writers must always gravitate towards their obsessions, and one of my obsessions was the idea that Frederick Douglass went to Ireland, a black slave, in 1845, but he was also an author, an orator, an intellectual, a dandy, an abolitionist, a humanitarian, a contrarian. What a story! I was also obsessed with the idea of writing about peace and what it could possibly mean in this day and age, which made George Mitchell a fascinating subject. Alcock and Brown landed in between these narratives, in more sense than one: they almost split the time difference between 1845 and 1998. But these were the only stories I contemplated. They seemed to bridge each other perfectly. They areâin my imagination at leastâbraided together. They inform one another.\n\nGive us a sense of how this novel came together, if you would. Where did you begin, and how did you shape the narrative to create the final version of the story?\n\nIt began with Douglass. It continued with Mitchell. But it was bridged by Alcock and Brown, which was the section that came easiest to me. But the moment I knew I âhadâ the novel was when I realised it was much more about the supposedly anonymous corners of human experience. The story belonged to the women. Thatâs where the truth lay. It is, in a sense, a feminist novel.\n\nThe novelâs real main characters, of course, are the women whose stories are at its heart: four generations of women beginning with Lily Duggan. Tell us a bit about them, and are they also based on real characters in part, or are they entirely fictional creations?\n\nThey are entirely fictional. And yet they live and breathe for me as much (if not more) than the supposedly ârealâ characters. It is very much a novel about women and their intersection with history; itâs also a novel that hopefully forces a reader to confront what is ârealâ and what is not.\n\nYou must have done extensive research for this book: what were some of the sources you found particularly useful or compelling?\n\nThe further I go along in my career, the more I realise that books belong to others more than to myself. It feels to me that this book was a community effort and the grace of the book (if it has any grace) belongs to others. I am indebted to countless numbers of people. I am aware that this could sound coy, or full with false humility but the fact of the matter is that a writer gets his or her voice from the voices of others. We are indebted to those who have come before us.\n\nIn the acknowledgements you mention that George and Heather Mitchell âhad the great grace to allow me to try to imagine my way into their world.â Iâd love to know more about what you learned from Senator Mitchell and how you worked those details into the story.\n\nGeorge and Heather Mitchell are an amazing couple, an astounding story of love and resilience and decency. They allowed me, at first, to imagine their lives. Then they read the manuscript and were charming enough, and humble enough, to allow me any mistakes. So I wrote the section before I met Senator Mitchell, and then I shaped it to get as close to the truth as I thought I might possibly get. They helped me realise what it was that I wanted to eventually say.\n\nWhatâs your favorite scene or line from TransAtlantic?\n\nOh, this is very much a âslice the babyâ question. How can one choose? I suppose the last line is very important to me, though I very much like line 247 and line 822 (just kidding!). I am very proud of the Douglass sectionâthat one broke my heart until I felt like I had properly captured him. But this is an impossible question and Iâm delighted by its impossibility.\n\nFor more from Colum McCann, including some advice on writing, a few of his favorite authors, and what heâs been reading recently, read the rest of our interview.\n\nIf youâd like to receive our State of the Thing newsletter, you can add it in your email preferences.

You can also read it online. It includes interviews with authors Tatiana Holway and Marie Brennan.\n\nI talked to Tatiana Holway about her book The Flower of Empire: An Amazonian Water Lily, the Quest to Make it Bloom, and the World it Created, published by Oxford University Press this month. Some excerpts:\n\nWhat a story! Itâs hard to imagine a country getting excited about a flowering plant today, but in early Victorian England, just that happened, as you tell us in your book. What was the plant, and why did so many find it so fascinating?\n\nYouâre right: most of us these days do tend to think of gardening as just a hobby and flowers as mere decor. For Victorians, though, gardening and flowers were intertwined with almost every aspect of daily life. Add to that the sheer numbers of new flowers that were turning up as Britons explored (and absorbed) more and more parts of the world, and the deluge of information about them that was surging through the ever more widely circulating popular press, and you can see how news of the discovery of a colossal tropical water lily could cause quite a stir. Then add the further fact that the plant was discovered in Britainâs only South American colonyâthe one where it so happened that Sir Walter Raleigh had gone looking for El Dorado and so much of Britainâs imperial ambition had been formedâand the fact that it was identified as a new genus just when the 18-year-old Princess Victoria happened to become queenâyou could say all the forces were in place for a perfect storm. The naming of the flower Victoria regia set it off.\n\nAre you a gardener yourself? If so, what are some of your favorite plants to grow?\n\nAbsolutely! After growing up in New York Cityââgardenless,â as Victorians might have saidâI found myself living in a house with a yard, stuck a trowel in the dirt, and fell head over heels with growing flowers: lilies of the valley, violas, forget-me-nots, daisies, delphiniums, sweet peas, morning glories, poppies, veronicas, daylilies, plantain lilies, lavender, roses, clematis, bell flowers, cone flowers, black-eyed susans, hollyhocks, phlox â¦\n\nWhatâs your own library like? What sorts of books would we find on your shelves?\n\nLoads of books on natural history, plus loads on British history, plus loads of Victorian literature and literary criticism. I have a soft spot for 17th-century poetry, so thereâs quite a bit of that, and then thereâs plenty of contemporary fiction, and pockets of all sorts of other books, too. I canât live without the OED. That and about a dozen other well-thumbed reference works are on my desk. Naturally, companions to gardens and flowers are there, too.\n\nWhat have you read and enjoyed recently?\n\nIssues of Punch from the 1850s and â60s and of The New Yorker from the last few months. Richard Russoâs Straight Man was great fun on a short trip recently. The other day, I started Mrs. Robinsonâs Disgrace by Kate Summerscale. Itâs a nonfiction work, based on a Victorian womanâs diary, and very well written. Julian Barnesâs The Sense of an Ending is definitely on my list. Iâm also looking forward to giving the novels of Jeffrey Eugenides a try.\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Tatiana Holway.\n\nI also had the chance to talk with Marie Brennan (LibraryThing member castlen) about her recent book A Natural History of Dragons (Tor).\n\nDo you recall what first gave you the idea to write a novel about Hollywood fame and its effects on both the famous person and those around him?\n\nTell us about Lady Trent, the narrator/memoirist of A Natural History of Dragons. Whatâs she like, how does she get interested in dragons, and what can readers expect from her memoir?\n\nSheâs a deeply geeky woman who became obsessed with dragons at a young age, when she began collecting sparklings (tiny insect-like draconic creatures) and decided that anything with wings was awesome. Her memoirs chronicle the process by which that enthusiastic girl became first an amateur naturalist, then a professional one, then a rather famous (not to say notorious) one. As she is writing her memoirs in her old age, she doesnât much care what people think of her anymore, and often has trenchant comments to make both on society and her own youthful errors.\n\nWhat gave you the idea to pen a novel in this particular narrative form?\n\nIt really just fell into place, when I first started chasing the idea. The first-person point of view drifted right away into a retrospective voice, Isabella looking back on her life, and then it seemed obvious to write it as an actual memoirâwhich is, after all, a very Victorian thing to do. (The book is set in a secondary world, but itâs very much modeled on the real nineteenth century.)\n\nYou and your husband have been LibraryThing members since 2006 (http://www.librarything.com/profile/castlen). Tell us about your library: how is it organized? Do you and your husband integrate your books or keep them separate?\n\nWe integrated them when we moved in togetherâand yes, both parts of that were considered Big Steps in our relationship! Back then we marked our books with initials in case of separation, but the books weâve gotten since then are unmarked. God help us if we ever get a divorce; that could get ugly real fast â¦\n\nAs for organization, fiction is downstairs, with mass-market paperbacks in one bookcase (with very closely-spaced shelves) and hardcovers and trade paperbacks on another. Those, of course, are all alphabetized by author. There are two bookcases with comic books and roleplaying games, and then in my husbandâs office, various science and technical books. My office contains the nonfiction part of our library, arranged by subject, along with odds and ends like the travel books, foreign language dictionaries, manga, and so on.\n\nIt sounds a bit obsessive, but with more than two thousand books, weâd never find anything if it werenât organized.\n\nYouâve written about the importance of buying books from physical bookstores: what are some of your favorite bookstores, and why?\n\nI love Borderlands Books in San Francisco. Itâs a specialty bookstore, with science fiction and fantasy and horror, and its selection is fabulous. They host a large number of readings and signings and other events, and the staff are very knowledgeable and friendlyâbasically, it has all the classic virtues of the independent specialty store.\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Marie Brennan.\n\nCatch up on previous State of the Thing newsletters.\n\nIf you donât get State of the Thing, you can add it in your email preferences. You also have to have an email address listed.\n\nThe February State of the Thing, LibraryThingâs monthly newsletter of features, author interviews and various forms of bookish delight, should have made its way to your inbox by now. You can also read it online. It includes interviews with authors Robin Sloan and Christine Sneed.\n\nI talked to Robin Sloan about his book Mr. Penumbraâs 24-Hour Bookstore , published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in October. Some excerpts:\n\nThe title of Mr. Penumbraâs 24-Hour Bookstore came from a tweet, right? Tell us where you got the idea, and how the book developed from the original short story into a full-length novel.\n\nThatâs right: the germ of the idea was a tweet from my friend Rachel, way back in 2008, which read, âjust misread â24hr bookdropâ as â24hr bookshopâ. the disappointment is beyond words.â I read it walking down the street in San Francisco, and it made me smile and wonder: what would a 24-hour bookstore be like, anyway? A few months later, when I sat down to start a new story, the question was still there, so I started to sketch it out. When it was finished, I published that story online, both in Amazonâs Kindle Store and on my website, and it just took off like a rocketâsomehow finding an audience much bigger and more vocal than any of my other stories before or since. So, that was a sign that maybe there was something there: some deeper potential, some larger story.\n\nWhat was your research process like as you wrote this book? Were there sources on the early years of printing that you found particularly useful?\n\nI love Andrew Pettegreeâs The Book in the Renaissance, a historianâs look at the publishing business circa 1400-1600. Basically the takeaway is this: it was just as competitive and chaotic as the internet industry is today. Probably more so.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite libraries and/or bookstores, and why?\n\nI have way too many favorites to list, but Iâll give a shout out to Green Apple Books in San Francisco, which was my neighborhood bookstore when I was first starting Penumbra. And actually, thereâs a branch of the San Francisco Public Library around the corner thatâs quite lovely, too; it has just as many books in Chinese and Russian as in English. You could do a lot worse than to have these two places as your neighborhood book-acquisition options.\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Robin Sloan.\n\nI also had the chance to talk with Christine Sneed about her recent book Little Known Facts (Bloomsbury).\n\nDo you recall what first gave you the idea to write a novel about Hollywood fame and its effects on both the famous person and those around him?\n\nI remember wondering one day what it would be like to have a famous film actor as your father, especially if you are a young manâwhat sort of competition and envy would you feel? This is where the idea for the book began, but Iâm not sure what triggered it.\n\nYouâve written that Little Known Facts asks of its characters âIf you could have anything in the world, what would you choose?â How would you answer that question yourself?\n\nWell, it will sound a little suspect, but itâs nonetheless true: I would help friends and family pay debts, send their children to college, take fancy vacations in the sun. Iâd want to be able to take fancy, sunny vacations too and spend more time in France, the country where I studied in college; it remains very close to my heart. Iâd also like to see about four movies a week.\n\nTell us a bit about your writing process: how and when do you do much of your writing? Any particular hints or tips on writing that youâd like to share?\n\nI usually write in the afternoons when Iâm not teaching; I do sometimes write at night, but not as often. The writing advice I often give is that you can get a lot done in the intersticesâeven if you only have 30-45 minutes on a given day, sit down and at least make some notes. A book is written little by little, not in one marathon session.\n\nWhatâs your own library like? What sorts of books would we find on your shelves?\n\nSome poetry but mostly fiction and nonfiction by American and British writers, and currently on my desk are Dan Chaonâs Stay Awake, Jess Walterâs Beautiful Ruins, Achy Obejasâs Ruins, along with Brad Watsonâs Aliens in Their Prime, also, Outrageously Offensive Jokes III and The PEN/O. Henry Prize Stories 2012.\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Christine Sneed.\n\nCatch up on previous State of the Thing newsletters.\n\nIf you donât get State of the Thing, you can add it in your email preferences.

You can also read it online. It includes interviews with authors Simon Garfield and Douglas Hunter.\n\nI talked to Simon Garfileld about his new book On the Map: A Mind-Expanding Exploration of the Way the World Looks , published by Gotham Books last month. Some excerpts:\n\nIâm going to begin by asking you the first question I asked Ken Jennings when I talked to him about his book Maphead: so what is it about maps, anyway? Why are so many people so fascinated by them?\n\nMaps have helped define what makes us human. Maps were one of the earliest forms of communication, almost certainly existing before language and speech. Iâm inclined to agree with Richard Dawkins when he suggests that our ability to draw mapsâto show fellow hunters where the juicy elk wereâwas a key factor in expanding the size of our brains, enabling the leap from apes to homo-sapiens. Beyond all this, maps are frequently beautiful artifacts, telling the best stories in a direct way. The idea of the book was to retell the best of these stories. And occasionally, of course, maps just help us get from A to B.\n\nWhat first got you interested in maps, and when?\n\nI first got hooked as a boy travelling on the London Underground at the age of 10. The famous Harry Beck tube mapânow copied all over the worldâwas in every carriage and platform. I didnât realize its significance (geographically itâs incredibly inaccurate, but as a diagram itâs a great piece of information engineering), but I was entranced by the names on it and its possibilities. The prospect of travelling to the end of any of the linesâAmersham at the end of the Metropolitan line, sayâseemed as exotic and far away as Antarctica. Iâve collected tube maps ever since, and now framed copies line my hallway at home.\n\nWhat have you read and enjoyed recently?\n\nTwo books Iâve loved of late: Walking Home by Simon Armitage, a funny account of a soggy walk across the Pennine Way from Derbyshire to Scotland, reading poetry at some unlikely venues en route to pay his way. And an oldie but goodie: 84 Charing Cross Road by Helene Hanff, the classic epistolary account of a tough American ladyâs relationship with a London bookshop and its staff (and its books).\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Simon Garfield.\n\nI also had the chance to talk with Douglas Hunter about his recent book The Race to the New World: Christopher Columbus, John Cabot, and a Lost History of Discovery (Palgrave Macmillan).\n\nChristopher Columbus is, of course, a household name, but John Cabot may not be known to many readers. Who was this man, and what did he do?\n\nJohn Cabot (as he was known in England) was a Venetian citizen who persuaded Englandâs Henry VII in 1496 to grant him some fairly generous rights to prove a westward route across the Atlantic to Asiaâs riches. His first try in 1496 was a failure, but his second voyage in 1497 made the first known landfall since the Vikings somewhere in northeastern North America, probably in southern Labrador or the coast of Newfoundland. At the time, Columbus hadnât moved beyond Caribbean islands in his own discovery efforts.\n\nCabot was a bit of an odd duck. He wasnât a seasoned mariner. He was a hide trader who dabbled in property renovation and fled creditors in Venice in the 1480s for Spain. Reinventing himself as a marine construction engineer, Cabot pitched the king, Fernando, on an artificial harbor scheme for Valencia in 1491-92. Fernando and Cabot couldnât line up the money for that project, and Cabot next surfaced in the historical record in 1494 in Seville, the headquarters of the Columbus scheme, overseeing an important bridge project. But Cabot appears not to have done any work on it, and by December 1494 he was essentially being run out of town by displeased nobles. Reinvented himself yet again, Cabot surfaced at the court of Henry VII in England, in January 1946, with his Asia voyage scheme. And so this considerable rival to Columbus emerged from within Columbusâs own milieu.\n\nYou suggest that Cabot may have accompanied Christopher Columbus on his second voyage, in 1493. Lay out the evidence for us, and explain what this finding might mean for our understanding of the history of exploration (or for Cabot and Columbus themselves).\n\nWhatâs really puzzling about Cabotâs career is how he managed to persuade Henry VII to grant him such generous rights for an Asia voyage in 1496 when he had no apparent track record as an expert mariner, let alone as an exploration promoter.\n\nItâs becoming increasingly clear that English mariners out of Bristol already may have reached the New World, perhaps earlier than 1470. Cabot could have tapped into this lost knowledge in proposing his voyage to Henry VII. But if that awareness was circulating, why didnât Henry give the job and its many privileges to an Englishman? Henry was a shrewd and tight-fisted ruler. Something about Cabotâs pitch persuaded him that this Venetian deserved the rights handed over to him.\n\nThere is more to this than I can explain here, but the most compelling case Cabot could have made for the rights he secured was that he had already been to Asia, and so he knew how to get there. Cabot was a bit of a confidence man. I think either he claimed something he hadnât done, or he had actually already had been to Asia, or the New World, rather, with Columbus. There are a couple bits of circumstantial evidence to support the distinct possibility that Cabot had been on the second Columbus voyage, which departed Spain in September 1493.\n\nOne of the bits of evidence I use is a really opaque letter written by the Spanish monarchs to their ambassador in London in early 1496. I engaged the help of an academic expert in early Spanish, and the letter seems to refer to Cabot as âthe one from the Indies.â Anyone interested in the tough slogging of historical translation should visit my website, follow the link for this book, and read the essay about âlo de las yndias.â\n\nWhatâs your own library like? What sorts of books would we find on your shelves?\n\nAs Iâm in the middle of doctoral studies, not surprisingly my shelves are groaning with works of history. My main doctoral fields, Canadian history and Aboriginal history, account for a lot of whatâs at hand. There are also a couple shelves full of works dedicated to exploration. A lot of those are reference books, from the Hakluyt Society and Repertorium Columbianum for example, with annotated transcriptions of key sources. I do read for pleasure, both fiction and nonfiction, though.\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Douglas Hunter.\n\nCatch up on previous State of the Thing newsletters.\n\nIf you donât get State of the Thing, you can add it in your email preferences. You also have to have an email address listed.\n\nThis monthâs State of the Thing, LibraryThingâs monthly newsletter of features, author interviews and various forms of bookish delight, should have made its way to your inbox by now. You can also read it online. It includes a reminder about SantaThing (signups continue through November 29, so head right over to the SantaThing page to join the fun!), as well as author interviews with Jon Ronson, Nancy Marie Brown, Jon Meacham, and Christopher Bonanos.\n\nI talked to Jon Ronson about his new book Lost at Sea: The Jon Ronson Mysteries, just out from Riverhead. Some excerpts:\n\nFor those who havenât had a chance to read it yet, give us the nutshell version of Lost at Sea. Whatâs the thread that ties these twenty-two short pieces together?\n\nThese are funny, sad stories about people lost at sea, trying to make their way through the world. Sometimes they reach for crazy ideas to get them through, sometimes horrifying ideas, sometimes silly ideas, sometimes even inspiring ideas. I see this as an empathetic book about people spiraling out of control.\n\nThey sometimes feel like adventure stories. I get into some dangerous scrapes. Other times they feel like mystery stories: there are actual mysteries that need solving. Sometimes the mystery is, Why does this person believe this crazy stuff? Or, Why does this person act in this baffling way?\n\nThereâs a Christmas-themed town in Alaska where every day is Christmas and the kids have to be Santaâs elves. A bunch of them were recently arrested for being in the final stages of plotting a school shooting. Thereâs a real-life superhero who dresses in a supersuit of his making and breaks up gangs of armed crack dealers in the dead of night. I went along with him. It was terrifying. Thereâs a billionaire filtering her money into creating a robot version of her real-life partner that sheâs convinced is about to burst into spontaneous life. I interviewed the robot. And so on.\n\nHow much follow-up do you do on your stories? Do you keep in touch with folks youâve profiled? Once youâve finished writing, do you move on to other projects?\n\nI like to keep in touchâIâm never happier than when people from my stories appreciate how theyâve been portrayed. That doesnât always happen. Iâve stayed in touch with maybe half the people in my books. Just today I corresponded with two of them: Phoenix Jones, the real-life superhero, and Mike Coriam, the father of Rebecca Coriam. Hers is the title story of the collection. Rebecca was a young woman who worked on the Disney Wonder, a cruise ship. She went missing on it one dayâshe just vanished. The Coriams have had no luck trying to find out what happened. They feel theyâre hitting a brick wall. I went on a cruise on the ship to learn what I could.\n\nIf you could interview or profile one person you havenât had the chance to talk to, who would it be? What would you want to ask?\n\nRight nowâand this is unusual for me, because Iâm not so interested in writing about famous peopleâDavid Bowie. He seems to have retreated from the world. Heâs barely been seen for six years. I would love to know why, and would like to ask him to reflect on his life.\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Jon Ronson.\n\nI also had the chance to talk with Nancy Marie Brown about her new book, Song of the Vikings: Snorri and the Making of Norse Myths (Palgrave Macillan). A few teasers:\n\nWhat were some of your favorite books as a child?\n\nThe Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien are probably first on that list. I also loved C.S. Lewisâ The Chronicles of Narnia, T.H. Whiteâs The Once and Future King, and Ursula K. LeGuinâs Earthsea Trilogy. Iâve had a very pretty edition of Tennysonâs poems since sixth gradeâbut Iâm afraid I like it more for its fake leather binding and slipcase than because the poems resonate. In high school I discovered Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (probably in Tolkienâs translation), and that was my entry into studying medieval literature.\n\nWhatâs your home library like? What sorts of books would we find on your shelves?\n\nMy whole house is a libraryâmy husband, Charles Fergus, is also a writerâso it depends which floor you are on. The basement holds our general fiction, poetry, fantasy, and science fiction collections. In my husbandâs office is mostly nature and science. Upstairs is the general nonfiction collection and a small collection of childrenâs books and young adult novels, which Iâm studying to learn how to write one. My office is taken over by Icelandic literature (both modern and medieval, in English and Icelandic) and books about Scandinavia, Vikings, folklore, medieval literature and scholarship, and travel (mostly to Iceland and northern Europe).\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Nancy Marie Brown.\n\nMy third interview for November was with Jon Meacham, about his new biography Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power, out this month from Random House.\n\nAs part of your research process, you spent a night in Jeffersonâs bedroom at Monticello. Can you tell us about that experience? What insights did you gain from being there that helped you understand the man better?\n\nI was struck by the play of light in his rooms. The sun strikes his chambers first, and he always woke at first lightâa sign of his constant engagement with the\n\nworld, and of his endless energy.\n\nYou write in the Epilogue about Jeffersonâs legacy, and about how he has, over time, âprovided inspiration for radically different understandings of government and culture.â What is it about the Founders in general, and perhaps Jefferson in particular, which has lent itself to such wide-ranging interpretations? What do you see as some of the most common misconceptions of Jeffersonâs philosophy or positions today?\n\nJefferson represents the best of us and the worst of usâour highest aspirations and our most disappointing failures. Itâs easy, then, to find ourselves in a kind of\n\nconversation with him as we look to the past for inspiration and for instruction. I think the most stubborn misconception about him is that he was solely a man of ideas. My view is that he was at once a philosopher and a political realist.\n\nIf you had the chance to interview Jefferson, but could only ask a single question, what would it be?\n\nWhat is your greatest regret?\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Jon Meacham.\n\nLast but not least, I was able to chat with Christopher Bonanos about his book Instant: The Story of Polaroid (Princeton Architectural Press).\n\nHow did this book come about? What first got you interested in the story of Polaroid?\n\nI was always a Polaroid shooter, from my teenage years, when I got a secondhand camera. (A Model 900, from 1959, marked $5, bargained down to $3.) And when Polaroid film was discontinued for good in 2008, I wrote a little magazine story that led me to the story of the companyâs rise and fall and rebirth, and Land and his extraordinary invention. You find a good story with an amazing central character, and if youâre a writer, you start to think âthatâs a book.â\n\nTell us about your research process: what sources did you find most useful? What was the most surprising thing you learned?\n\nPolaroidâs archive contains a few million documents and photos, and during the companyâs bankruptcy, the whole pile went to Harvard Business Schoolâs Baker Library. The person in charge of it, a librarian named Tim Mahoney, is going to spend his whole career on this one collection, it looks like, and the first tranche of it came open to researchers around the end of 2009. So in January 2010, I started logging a lot of time there. Also, the companyâs museum collection (prototypes and such) went to the MIT Museum, where I also did quite a bit of digging. And then a lot of the extraordinarily smart people Land hired are still around, and I spoke to lots of them.\n\nSurprising things I learned: Polaroid kept everything. EVERYTHING. In the companyâs early days, Land had been involved in a patent dispute, and after that, each idea was disclosed, signed, witnessed, and dated. Iâll tell you, thereâs nothing like those files when youâre trying to figure out how an invention got off the ground.\n\nAnother big surprise: Land made a point of hiring woman scientists, which was highly unusual back then. He was friends with an art-history professor at Smith College who would recommend his smartest students, and Land would scoop them up every year. A lot of them were, as youâd expect, art-history majors, and heâd send them off for some chemistry classes and build his own scientists that way. It was an end run around the usual pool of graduating talent, and it also made those women extremely loyal. A lot of them stayed at Polaroid for decades.\n\nYouâre something of a Polaroid enthusiast yourself, I understand? How long have you been using Polaroid cameras? Are you still using them today?\n\nI started shooting as a kid, though that camera is no longer useful: it uses a film format thatâs out of production. But I do carry another camera (Model 180, for the cultists) with me every day, and I try to shoot my son at least two or three times a week. Iâve been keeping an album since he was born, and I have to assume heâs one of the very last kids who will be documented that way. (I take plenty of digital photos of him, too, of course.)\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Christopher Bonanos.\n\nCatch up on previous State of the Thing newsletters.\n\nIf you donât get State of the Thing, you can add it in your email preferences. You also have to have an email address listed.\n\nThis monthâs State of the Thing, LibraryThingâs monthly newsletter of features, author interviews and various forms of bookish delight, should have made its way to your inbox by now. You can also read it online. It includes author interviews with David Quammen, Rachel Hartman, Karen Engelmann, and Jaime Manrique, plus some activity ideas from the co-authors of Unbored: The Essential Field Guide to Serious Fun.\n\nI had the great pleasure of talking to David Quammen about his new book Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic (W.W. Norton & Company). Some excerpts:\n\nBefore we get too far, can you give us the nutshell explanation of zoonosis and spillover, for those who havenât yet had a chance to read the book? What sorts of diseases are we talking about here?\n\nZoonosis is an animal infection transmissible to humans. It can be a virus, a bacterium, a protozoan, a number of other infectious bugs. It doesnât necessarily cause disease in humans, but if it does cause symptoms once it gets into humans, then we call it a zoonotic disease. Spillover is the label for the moment when any sort of an infectious pathogen passes from one species into another, but we particularly think of it in terms of animal infections passing into humans.\n\nThat includes a whole rogueâs list of the best-known diseases, and also some little-known things: it includes 60% of the infectious diseases that we know, under the strict definition of zoonosis. That runs from West Nile and hantavirus, Lyme Disease, all the influenzas, Ebola, Marburg, a couple of exotic little-known things called Nipah virus from Bangladesh, and Hendra virus from Australia. Also SARS, which came out of southern China, and of course HIV, the AIDS pandemic, also began with a zoonotic spillover.\n\nWas there a particular author who inspired you as a writer?\n\nThereâs one author who influenced me hugely, by far my largest literary influence and itâs probably going to seem counter-intuitive, but thatâs William Faulkner. I started as a fiction writer, and before I was a fiction writer I was a fiction reader. I started reading Faulkner when I was a freshman in college, and became obsessed with him (like a lot of people do because heâs such a great writer). I did my graduate work on structure in Faulknerâs novels, and then I started my writing career publishing novels myself. I discovered that I wasnât really meant to be a novelist and I turned into a non-fiction writer. But even now, when I spend six years or eight years researching a non-fiction subject, a big sprawling topic like zoonotic diseases or island biogeography, and then the time comes to put that together into a 500-page book, or a 600-page book, what I learned from closely, closely examining and pondering the structure of Faulknerâs novels serves me very, very well.\n\nRead the rest of our interview with David Quammen.\n\nI also had the chance to talk with Rachel Hartman about her first fantasy novel Seraphina (Random House). A few teasers:\n\nYour dragons are quite different from those created by other authors; tell us a bit about them, and how you came up with the idea to portray them as you have.\n\nMy dragons can take human form, but they rigidly suppress their human emotions, which they find distastefully overwhelming and undragonlike. Theyâve been called âscaly Vulcansâ by some reviewers: not a perfect analogy, but close enough to give the right idea.\n\nThe idea of dragons struggling with being human came to me a few years ago when I learned about a condition called Sensory Processing Disorder. Our brains filter out sensory information so we arenât overwhelmed by it, and different peopleâs filters work differently well. It occurred to me that dragons in dragon form would be accustomed to one set of senses: excellent eyesight and smell, indifferent hearing, poor touch and taste. What would it be like to go from those senses to ours, to taste sweetness for the first time or feel with our sensitive skin? From contemplating their senses, it wasnât much of a stretch to start thinking about emotions. Would dragons in their natural state even have emotions? In my conception, itâs not that they donât have them at all but that theyâre very reflexive and physical. âFight or flightâ is as close as they get to anger and fear, but surely the softer emotions are a messy mammalian thing, for parent-child bonding and social cohesion.\n\nWe arenât born knowing what to do with emotions; Iâve learned this from raising a child. How well are dragons going to be able to cope? They would need some rules for how to keep themselves from being overwhelmed. In my world, theyâve taken a pretty repressiveâdraconian, evenâapproach to maintaining their essential dragon-ness. Dragons who âloseâ themselves to emotion are sent home and lobotomized. Itâs harsh, but they think itâs necessary.\n\nWhatâs your own library like? What sorts of books would we find on your shelves?\n\nI have a large collection of books on various Medieval subjects: architecture, costume, musical instruments, military history, womenâs history, material culture. The jewel of my collection is a three-volume work, The Plan of St. Gall, about a Medieval monastery that was designed but never built. I also have a lot of graphic novels, shelves of classical Greek (which I studied for four years in college), and all my favourite fiction. My husbandâs books overlap with mine, so thereâs philosophy, science, and many books in Irish.\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Rachel Hartman.\n\nMy third interview for October was with Karen Engelmann. We talked about her really enjoyable debut novel, The Stockholm Octavo (Ecco):\n\nFolding fans and the âlanguage of fansâ play a key role in the plot. Is this a particular passion of yours? Of all the fans you describe so vividly in the story, do you have a favorite?\n\nMy mother gets the credit for inspiring the folding fans. She had a modest collection, but they were magical to me, especially as a child. Much later, I visited an exhibition of rare fans in a museum in Sweden, and was taken by their beauty, mystery and opulence. When I decided to write a novel set in late 18th-century Europe that had female characters in central roles, I knew folding fans would play an important part. Women used every available means at their disposal to survive in the manâs world of the period, and the use of folding fans as a means of communication was an aspect too delicious to ignore. Of the fans in the book, I would want to possess the Chinese Princess, the fan that Mrs. Sparrow throws on the table as a bet in the card game against The Uzanne. The Princess is a childâs fan made of pierced ivory, so she is small and sturdy enough to carry around in my purse, and has a red silk tassel for some added pizzazz.\n\nWhat was your research process like for the book? You lived in Sweden for a time, right? Any particularly useful sources youâd recommend to your readers?\n\nLiving in Sweden for nine years gave me the sensory information, the language skills, and the interest in Swedish history that inspired the novel. The actual research was challenging, since the best material on Gustav and Stockholm is written in Swedish and so required more time and concentration. I have two good friends who provided invaluable help, sending stacks of books (including a Swedish dictionary that must weigh 15 pounds). There is a bibliography on my website for interested readers (both Swedish and English sources) and I would love to see the Swedish volumes translated into English. One cautionary note for writers: the amount of available material can be overwhelming. If you are fascinated by a topic, it can be hard to know when to stop and the story and characters never emerge. Plus, writers want to stuff everything theyâve learned into the narrative and this can kill the story. About 100 pages of my manuscript were cut and most of it was factoids. Listen to your editors!\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Karen Engelmann.\n\nI was very pleased to be able to chat with Jaime Manrique about his latest novel, Cervantes Street (Akashic Books), a biographical novel about Miguel de Cervantes.\n\nDo you recall how the idea for this book originated, or which part came to you first?\n\nOne afternoon, about 15 years ago, I was in bed with the flu and in a cable channel I saw a program about Cervantes. Although I had read Don Quixote a couple of times over the years, I knew very little about its authorâother than he had lost the use of his left arm fighting in the Battle of Lepanto. When I found out about his captivity in Algiers for five and half years, that later in life he had been in jail twice, that in his 20s he fled Madrid because he wounded a man in a tavern brawl, and the punishment was exile for ten years and the lost of his right hand, I was blown away. It was a life that only a writer of adventure stories could have made up. At that moment, I determined to learn more about this manâabout whom little else is known, anyway.\n\nMost folks probably know Cervantes for Don Quixote; tell us about his other works, and which of them would you recommend to contemporary readers?\n\nUnlike Shakespeare who wrote many great plays, Cervantes wrote only one great novel. His other full-length novels are kind of unreadable; his verse is undistinguished. However, the plays that survive are interesting and have splendid moments and beautiful language, and the short ones are marvelous comic inventions. Among the Exemplary Novels are a couple of dazzling jewels. Iâm very fond of the Colloquium of the Dogsâwhich though a bit long-winded is a marvelously unique and inspired short novel.\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Jaime Manrique.\n\nAnd last but not least, thereâs a neat book out this month from Bloomsbury, Unbored: The Essential Field Guide to Serious Fun. I asked the co-authors, Elizabeth Foy Larsen and Joshua Glenn, to share the activities from the book which their families have enjoyed.\n\nElizabeth recommends:\n\nYarn bombing: My kids and I used yarn that was sitting in my knitting bag to create a brightly striped rectangle that we turned into a legwarmer for a banister in a particularly grey part of our hometown. To make it even more fun, we waited until it was well past bedtime and dressed up in dark clothes and headlamps to install it. A creative way to add a pop of color to industrial landscapes.\n\nExplode things: Everyone has tried the Diet Coke and Mentos experiment. My kids and I went one step better by chewing a Mento until it was soft enough to cram in the cap of a one liter bottle. Then we put the cap back on, turned the bottle upside down, and threw it onto the street. Then we ran like heck in the other direction while the bottle rocketed more than 25 yards down the street. Watch on YouTube.\n\nCigar box guitar: A cigar store gave my husband and kids a wooden cigar box with a gorgeous label. They worked together to build a four-string guitar that he uses to play Rolling Stones songs. A challenging but fun activity that is both useful and beautiful to look at. See video of the guitar in action.\n\nAnd from Josh:\n\nMaking LED graffiti: Taking inspiration from the Graffiti Research Lab (a guerrilla street-art outfit), I rounded up a bag of 10mm diffused superbright LEDs, a fistful of 3V lithium batteries, and a stack of disc-shaped rare earth magnets, and handed it all over to my sons and their three girl cousins. They taped these together, thus creating beautiful âglowiesâ andâeven betterââthrowies.â Check them out!\n\nMisusing the Foursquare app: The location-based social networking Foursquare is intended for use by 20-somethings interested in friend-finding and nightlife-bragging. But my family enjoys using it to transform our cityâand everywhere elseâinto a game. Itâs an app that doesnât just ask you to stare at a screen; instead, it encourages you to discover new places â¦ some hiding in plain sight.\n\nSee more videos and photos from Unbored at www.unbored.net, or download a PDF of these selected activities. Thanks to Elizabeth and Josh for sharing some of their favorite ideas from the book!\n\nCatch up on previous State of the Thing newsletters.\n\nIf you donât get State of the Thing, you can add it in your email preferences. You also have to have an email address listed.\n\nThis monthâs State of the Thing, LibraryThingâs monthly newsletter of features, author interviews and various forms of bookish delight, should have made its way to your inbox by now. You can also read it online. It includes author interviews with Rebecca Stott and Dustin Thomason.\n\nI talked to Rebecca Stott about her latest book, Darwinâs Ghosts: The Secret History of Evolution, published by Spiegel & Grau. Some excerpts:\n\nTell us about Darwinâs Ghostsâhow did the idea for the book come about, and how did you select which subjects to profile?\n\nWhen I wrote Darwin and the Barnacle back in 2003 I was struck once again by the dangerousness of the work Darwin was doing. I knew there had been others who had entertained ideas about the evolution of species before him and I became curious about the risks they might have undertaken. I started with Darwinâs own list of his predecessorsâthere were 38 men on Darwinâs listâand began to assemble as many more names as I could find. My book begins with Aristotle, even though Darwin was mistaken to call him an evolutionist, because the questions he was asking and the empirical methods he used would shape the long history of evolution in important ways. My aim was to try to understand these people as human beings not just as vehicles for ideas. I wanted to know what vexed them, what woke them up at night, what drove them.\n\nWhat was it that persuaded Darwin to add his âHistorical Sketchâ to the third edition of Origin (and to expand it in the fourth edition)? Was there any contemporary reaction to the essay itself (distinct from reaction to the book as a whole)?\n\nThere was a kind of protocol in Darwinâs time that if you published a groundbreaking book of science you would begin by paying tribute to all the thinkers who had walked that path before you. Darwin failed to do this with Origin partly because he was rushed into print and partly because he was unsure just who his predecessors were. In 1860, when he was chastised for not including such a preface, he resolved to write one. The project took him six years to complete and was a source of enormous anxiety to him; he was never quite sure who had said or written what and when. Because he kept finding new people the historical sketch was always to some degree a work-in-progress.\n\nYou write in the preface about growing up in a household where the Darwin entry was literally razored out of the encyclopedia. Do you think that contributed to your interest in Darwin and his ideas?\n\nUndoubtedlyâas far as one can know about these things. I was a curious child, and I remember the intense frisson of curiosity I felt about Darwin and his ideas, because they were regarded with such derision and horror by all the important men in the religious community I lived in. Prohibition acts in mysterious ways.\n\nWhich of Darwinâs predecessors were you most surprised to learn about as you researched for this book?\n\nProbably the eighteenth-century French intellectual Diderot. I lingered longer over that chapter than any of the others. I think I fell in love with him a little. Diderot was intellectually restless, a rule-breaker, a risk-taker, clearly also fascinating and charismatic in conversation. I think he might well be the most original thinker I have encountered. Because he was forced to hide his ideasâhe was under surveillance from the Paris policeâhe developed a series of rhetorical strategies for evading responsibility often by using devices from the theatre. The results are often surreal and highly inventive.\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Rebecca Stott.\n\nI had the chance to talk with Dustin Thomason about his new thriller 12.21, published by The Dial Press.\n\nDo you recall what first made you think about combining prions and Mayan prophecies for the plot of 12.21?\n\nThat was actually what brought the entire book together for me and is one of the key secrets of the book! The connection is deeply rooted in the culture of the ancient Maya, and closely connected to the original way that prions were discovered. But to really find out, youâll have to read on â¦\n\nYour book features a fictional Mayan codex, but there are a few of these that actually exist. Tell us about the codices and their importance in our understanding of Mayan civilization and culture.\n\nFour ancient Maya books still exist of the thousands of screen-folded codices that probably once filled the royal libraries. You can find images of several of them online and see the wondrous work of the ancient scribes that served as the jumping off point for the codex in 12.21. The scribes were meticulous bookkeepers, and in these codices they kept close records of rituals and astronomical matters, all dated according to the all-important cyclical calendars responsible for the 2012 phenomenon. Amazing naked-eye astronomers, many Maya books were almanacs that tracked the movement of Mars and Venus, solstices and equinox, as well constellations eerily similar to our own zodiac. Over the last century, Mayanists have been able to use these four remaining booksânamed the Dresden, Madrid, Paris and Grolier codicesâto bring the most advanced civilization in the pre-Columbian new world back to life.\n\nWhatâs your library like today? What sorts of books would we find on your shelves?\n\nA very eclectic mix. On the fiction side, youâd see Stephen King and Michael Crichton and Richard Russo, plus Dan Brown and Dickens and Philip Roth and Delillo and Lehane and Michael Cunningham, to name a few. Many shelves Iâm looking at now are taken up by books about the ancient Maya, some of them out of print. In order to write in the voice of a ninth century scribe, I had to immerse myself in most everything thatâs been written about them. Youâd also find dozens of medical textbooks, and a weird assortment of other things on random topics that most people would find absurd. As I glance higher, I see And the Band Played On sandwiched between The Professional Handbook of the Donkey and The White Album. Plus, for Christmas every year, my father used to give us The World Almanac, so thereâs almost two entire shelves taken up by those alone.\n\nWhich books have you read recently that you enjoyed?\n\nMichael Olsonâs Strange Flesh recently enchanted me with its weird and wonderful mix of hacker noir and depraved hearts, and I just finished William Landayâs Defending Jacob, which sucks you in with its compelling voice from page one and takes you on a ride of twists and turns as good as any since Presumed Innocent. I also just went to the Middle East for the first time, and while I was there I read Exodus, which seemed as fresh now as it must have to readers fifty years ago.\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Dustin Thomason.\n\nCatch up on previous State of the Thing newsletters.\n\nIf you donât get State of the Thing, you can add it in your email preferences. You also have to have an email address listed.\n\nThis monthâs State of the Thing, LibraryThingâs monthly newsletter of features, author interviews and various forms of bookish delight, should have made its way to your inbox by now. You can also read it online. It includes author interviews with Francine Mathews and Russell A. Potter.\n\nI talked to Francine Mathews about her latest book, Jack 1939, just published by Riverhead. Some excerpts:\n\nYouâve previously written, as Stephanie Barron, a series of books featuring Jane Austen as a private detective. In Jack 1939, you turn instead to a young John Kennedy. Do you recall what first gave you the idea of using Kennedy as your protagonist?\n\nOddly enough, it was a glimpse of a photograph from the summer of 1937, when Jack was twenty years old and traveling with his best friend through Europe. He was standing on a street in Germanyâpossibly Nuremberg, possibly Cologneâwearing mismatched clothes he clearly hadnât changed in days: baggy flannels, a T-shirt, a crumpled check jacket with sagging pockets. His hair was a mess, and he was thin as a rail, all cheekbones and chin, but his mouth was wide open in raucous laughter, and he was juggling for the camera. He looked like some crazed street buskerâcarefree, joyous, young. And I thought, My God, he was just a kid once. I wanted to know who that kid was.\n\nWhen I realized heâd taken off half his junior year to travel alone through Europe just as Hitler was about to invade Poland, I had to use it.\n\nWhat benefits do you see in deploying historical characters as fictional detectives/secret agents? On the flip side, are there disadvantages to this?\n\nMost of my books are about people who actually livedânot just Jane Austen, but Allen Dulles and Virginia Woolf and Queen Victoria. As a writer, Iâm caught by the âwhat ifâ moments in the known record. The gaps. The blank weeks in a well-documented life. For me, theyâre tantalizing opportunities. I can fill those gaps with fiction and create an alternative reality. As a guide, Iâve got a famous person whoâs already intriguingâreaders are willing to follow Jane Austen or Queen Victoria or Jack Kennedy anywhere they choose to go.\n\nThe drawback as a writer, of course, is that the historical record has its limits. Virginia Woolf went for a walk on March 28, 1941, and her body was found twenty days later. I suggest in The White Garden that she was alive for most of that time. But her body was pulled from the river in the end, and the fictional story was forced to address that.\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Francine Mathews.\n\nI had the chance to talk with Russell Potter about PYG: The Memoirs of Toby, a Learned Pig, published in the UK by Canongate and the US/Canada by Penguin.\n\nWhere did you get the idea for PYG? Can you tell us a bit about the historical precedents for Toby?\n\nI first read about the âLearned pigââan act in which the animal spelled out answers to audience questions using pasteboard cardsâmany years ago in the pages of Richard Altickâs magisterial volume The Shows of London. Some time later, perusing Ricky Jayâs delightful compendium of curiosities, Learned Pigs and Fireproof Women, I was surprised to discover how many such pigs there had been in the 1780s, with several living claimants vying for attention with automaton versions of the same act. Jay also mentioned that the proprietor of one of these pigs had gone so far as to issue an âautobiographyâ of Tobyâfor so all pigs seemed to be namedâwhich gave a punning account of his âlife and opinions.â It occurred to me then that, should there be a pig who had learned not only his letters, but gained through them the ability to express his own feelings, how much richer and more varied a tale might be told from his viewpoint as an animal exhibited as a âFreak of Nature,â and so PYG was born.\n\nThe book is beautifully designed; what was the process like for choosing the images, font and other elements of the text?\n\nI love the design as well, though in part it was simply the result of a series of fortuitous accidents. Iâd always conceived of it as a book which would emulate in its form the conventions of a late-18th century novel, and when the designer at Canongate suggested Caslon Antique I was delighted. Originally, Iâd wanted to use the same woodcut of a learned pig that appeared in Ricky Jayâs book, but since that volume was about to be republished, Jay asked us to not to copy that design. I set out to locate an image from the period, and in the wonderful Osborn collection of early childrenâs books at the Toronto Public Library, I found the Darton volume with the image of a learned pig. Iâd already given all the chapters three-letter names, so it seemed natural to use this image and have the titles spelled out with the cardsâI made a rough mockup in Photoshop and sent it to the designer, who did the rest.\n\nWhatâs your own library like today? What sorts of books would we find on your shelves?\n\nMost of my collection is online at LibraryThing (here), so interested parties can have a virtual âbrowseâ of my shelves any time they like. I have a few books from each centuryâincluding a little duodecimo edition of Johnsonâs Rasselas just that the one Toby has in the novelâand collect mainly literary fiction by my favorite authors, particularly Ursula K. LeGuin and Steven Millhauser. In my non-fiction incarnation, Iâve worked extensively on the history of Arctic exploration, and so that makes up the biggest single section of my collection. Among my most prized volumes is an 1820 edition of Sir William Edward Parryâs account of his first Arctic expedition, printed in Philadelphia by Abraham Small, one of the earliest US editions of a work of polar exploration.\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Russell Potter.\n\nCatch up on previous State of the Thing newsletters.\n\nIf you donât get State of the Thing, you can add it in your email preferences. You also have to have an email address listed.\n\nThis monthâs State of the Thing, LibraryThingâs monthly newsletter of features, author interviews and various forms of bookish delight, should have made its way to your inbox by now. You can also read it online. It includes author interviews with Dan Rather, Alex Grecian, Catherine Fletcher, Kathy Hepinstall, and Joy Kiser.\n\nI talked to Dan Rather about his new memoir, Rather Outspoken: My Life in the News, recently published by Grand Central. Some excerpts:\n\nIf you could interview (or re-interview) one person today, and you only got to ask one question, who would you interview and what would you ask?\n\nI would love to know what the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. would think of the fact that the United States elected an African American president. I would also want to know what parts of his vision for our country remain yet to be fulfilled.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the 2012 presidential campaign? Have you been surprised by any of the twists and turns so far, and do you have any predictions about how things will progress over the next few months?\n\nI often say that those who live by the crystal ball learn to eat broken glass. I donât really know where this election will end up, other than it will almost certainly be close. As for twists and turns, I think that the only people really focusing on that now are an insular press corps and political activists. Weâre still in the early innings, but the game has definitely begun. The real question is what will all this money pouring into the process mean for whoever is elected.\n\nWhere do you get your news these days? What are the sources you feel most comfortable trusting?\n\nI get my news from many sources. I go online, but I also still love the feel of an old-fashioned newspaper in my hand. I find myself less distracted, and I process what I read more. I have also heard this from many people I talk to, even those raised in the digital age.\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Dan Rather.\n\nI had the chance to talk with Alex Grecian about The Yard, published by Putnam and a very popular March Early Reviewers selection.\n\nFor those who might not have yet had the chance to read The Yard, give us just a short introduction to the book, if you would.\n\nJack the Ripper has done his nasty work and disappeared. The citizens of London are terrified and they donât trust their police anymore. The homicide rate is at an all-time high and police morale is at an all-time low, when Walter Day, the newest detective at Scotland Yard, is assigned to catch a cop-killer. Overwhelmed, Day turns for help to an eccentric doctor named Kingsley who is well on his way to becoming the first forensics scientist in England.\n\nWhat first interested you about the post-Jack the Ripper period in London police\n\nhistory?\n\nThe actual Ripper murders have been talked about to death (so to speak). Jack the Ripperâs fascinating, of course, but I donât feel like thereâs much left to say on the subject. At least, not by me. But the impact he left on the people around him had to have been enormous. Something that devastating and that frightening doesnât happen in a vacuum. He didnât kill those five women, and then disappear and life went back to normal for everyone. He permanently changed Londonâand the worldâand that is fertile ground for an entire series of stories.\n\nThis is your first prose novel. What was your favorite part of the writing process?\n\nAnd which part did you like the least?\n\nI had originally intended to write this as a graphic novel and already had some interest from comic book publishers. Iâm more comfortable writing prose than I am writing comic books, but it was still a huge gamble to write it as a novel. In the end, Iâm very glad I did, but I didnât know what would happen as I was working my way through the book. It was a little scary.\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Alex Grecian.\n\nI also talked with Catherine Fletcher about her first book, The Divorce of Henry VIII (published in the UK as Our Man in Rome), released last month by Palgrave Macmillan\n\nTell us about âour man in Rome.â In a nutshell, who was Gregorio Casali, and what did he do?\n\nGregorio Casali was Henry VIIIâs resident ambassador at the papal court in Rome throughout the six years of negotiations over Henryâs divorce from Catherine of Aragon. He came from an upwardly-mobile Italian family whose sons made their way in life through military and diplomatic service to foreign princes. He was the man who did the âfixingâ for Henry in Rome: from entertaining cardinals to bribing secretaries, from intercepting letters to kidnapping enemy agents.\n\nDo you recall what first interested you in Tudor diplomacy generally, and in Gregorio Casali specifically?\n\nI had been on holiday to Florence and had got interested in Renaissance Italy. Shortly afterwards I was reading the classic biography of Henry VIII by J. J. Scarisbrick. He mentioned the role of the Casali family in Henryâs divorce negotiations, and I was intrigued by how an Italian family could have got involved in something we in England often think of as a very English bit of history.\n\nI also asked Catherine what books sheâs read and enjoyed recently.\n\nIâm reading Thomas Pennâs Winter King at the momentâitâs a marvelous take on Henry VII, a Tudor monarch we often donât hear much about. And I recently finished Iain Pearsâ historical novel Stoneâs Fallâan absolutely brilliant murder mystery.\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Catherine Fletcher.\n\nI chatted with Kathy Hepinstall about her fourth novel, Blue Asylum, just out from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. I asked about some of her fairly unorthodox outreach efforts:\n\nI read through your author blog to prepare for this interview (and I have to say itâs one of the funniest things Iâve read in a long time). Did you really bury a copy of your novel for Oprah and then provide directions to the buried novel in the local paper? â¦ also, has Oprah retrieved her book yet?\n\nAh, thank you. And, yes I actually did bury a copy of my novel for her and then took out an ad with a map in her local paper, The Montecito Journal. Oprah did not retrieve the book, although someone did steal her shovel. So I took out another ad, this time hiding the book in a safe by the side of the road with a sign pointing to it that said âOprahâs Book.â Non-Oprahs of Montecito were instructed, on their honor, not the memorize the combination to the safe included in the ad. Someone heisted the book, the safe and the sign. What can I say? Montecito apparently is swarming with thieves.\n\nYouâve done some other, shall we say, unconventional things to promote Blue Asylum. Describe a few of those, if you would, and tell us about any responses youâve gotten.\n\nLetâs see, some ad students in Eugene came up with the great idea themselves to write letters from the characters and include them with the galleys that Houghton Mifflin Harcourt sent to the independent bookstores.\n\nI commissioned someone to bake a box of delectables and send it to Books-a-Million with the idea that this was a bribe from the inmates of Sanibel Island to get them out of the asylum. They are getting that soon. Also, we have a web site called whoscrazier.com. You can put any celebrity you want in there, virtually, and hear an audiotape in their own voice that demonstrates why they should be in an insane asylum. And, of course, the Oprah ads. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt has been very open to my ideas, and have some very imaginative ones of their own. Who knows what will work in what way, but I inscribed the latest book (in the safe) to Oprah with the words: âIf you never get this book, I still believe in magic.â\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Kathy Hepinstall.\n\nFinally, I the chance to interview Joy Kiser about Americaâs Other Audubon, published by Princeton Architectural Press. The book is an an introduction and partial reprint of a rare book of ornithological artwork. A few snippets:\n\nWhat first got you interested in Illustrations of the Nests and Eggs of Birds of Ohio? What attracted you to the book, and what surprised you the most as you researched its history?\n\nWhen I walked into the Cleveland Museum of Natural History in Ohio to begin my new position as assistant librarian, volume one of Illustrations of the Nests and Eggs of Birds of Ohio was exhibited in a Plexiglas display case at the foot of the stairway that led to the library on the second floor. A label, about three inches high by five inches wide, succinctly explained that the book was the accomplishment of the Jones family of Ohio: the daughter, Genevieve, had conceived of the idea and had begun drawing and painting the illustrations with the assistance of a childhood friend; the son, Howard, had collected the nests and eggs; the father, Nelson, had paid the publishing costs; and after Genevieve died, the mother, Virginia, and the rest of the family spent eight years completing the work as a memorial to Genevieve.\n\nDo you have a couple favorite plates that youâd like to mention?\n\nPlate 2, the Wood Thrush; and Plate 17, the Catbird. I am partial to the American Robin and its stunning blue eggs. That was one of the first birds I learned to identify and interact with in my fatherâs orchard. It was much more exciting to find blue eggs (like a piece of the summer sky) in a nest than the white eggs with brown spots that the House Sparrows laid.\n\nThe first image I saw from Gennieâs book was the Wood Thrush nest with blue eggs reminiscent to the Robinâs but from a bird I have never seen or heard in person. And I am especially fond of Virginiaâs composition for the Catbird nest.\n\nAmericaâs Other Audubon is a beautiful book itself: can you tell us a bit about the design and editing process?\n\nSeveral years ago (2004), The Smithsonian Institution Libraries created a web exhibit that featured an essay about Gennieâs book and included scans of 30 of the color plates and for the very first time people searching the internet from any place in the world had access to some of the bookâs illustrations. It was on that website that Acquisitions Editor, Sara Bader, from Princeton Architectural Press discovered Gennieâs art work and realized what a wonderful book it would make. Fortunately, her publisher had faith in her vision and agreed to publish the Jones familyâs story and all of the art work from the original book. And the Smithsonian Institution contributed high resolution scans from one of their copies of Illustrations of the Nests and Eggs of the Birds of Ohio.\n\nThe difficult part for me was to have to see the field notes reduced to so few words.\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Joy Kiser.\n\nCatch up on previous State of the Thing newsletters.\n\nIf you donât get State of the Thing, you can add it in your email preferences. You also have to have an email address listed.\n\nThis monthâs State of the Thing, LibraryThingâs monthly newsletter of features, author interviews and various forms of bookish delight, is on its way to your inbox. You can also read it online. It includes author interviews with Hilary Mantel, Naomi Novik, Jonathan Gottschall, and Melissa Coleman.\n\nI talked to Hilary Mantel about her new book Bring Up the Bodies, the sequel to Wolf Hall, published this month by Henry Holt.\n\nOriginally, youâve said, you planned just âone enormous bookâ on Thomas Cromwell, but now weâre looking at a trilogy. When did you realize first that his story needed two books, and now three?\n\nI think that fiction, even historical fiction, is inherently unpredictable. You know what the story is, but you donât know until you tell it where its power is located, where\n\nyou will place the focus and how you need to shape it. I did originally imagine there would be just one book, but as I began to tell the story of Thomas Cromwell and Thomas More, I realized that it needed to be played out properly, that it couldnât be hurried: that it was, in fact, the climax of a book, not an episode in a book. At that point, I decided that Wolf Hall would end with Moreâs death, and the royal party heading for the house named in the title. With Bring up the Bodies, the process of discovery was virtually the same, though it still caught me unawares. I came to write the end of the Boleyns, and realized that I already had a book; the buildup to that tragedy is so stealthy, the climax so horrifying, that I thought the reader would want to pause, close the book, take a breath.\n\nSo the whole project reshaped itself for a second time, and very swiftly; in each case, the process of realization took a split second; and the second after that, it seemed obvious. To some readers it might sound as if my method of work is very disorganized. Iâd prefer to think of it as an organic, evolving process: sudden discoveries and sudden demands breeding changes of tactics. I like to gather my material, think for a long time, but make the business of writing itself as spontaneous and flexible as possible. If I can I like to take myself by surprise.\n\nWhat was it about Thomas Cromwell that initially drew you to him as a way to write about the Tudor period?\n\nIt appealed to me because his character had never been explored properly in fiction or drama. Cromwell was the son of a blacksmith and brewer, and this stratified, hierarchical society, he rose to become the kingâs right-hand man and eventually Earl of Essex; you have to ask, how did he do it? Luck? Calculation? Both, surely, but what combination of the two? And what drove him? When you worked for Henry VIII, the stakes were so high. One slip and you were dead. I wanted to try to work out what combination of ambition and idealism motivated Cromwell. In what ways was he typical of his time, and in what ways unique? And as I was asking myself, as I always do when I write I historical fiction, how did this manâs life feel, from the inside?\n\nWhen you stand in Cromwellâs shoes, familiar events are defamiliarised. The story, which is irresistible in itself, comes up fresh and new.\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Hilary Mantel.\n\nI also talked to Naomi Novik, the author of the fascinating Temeraire fantasy series. The latest volume, Crucible of Gold, was published in March by Del Rey. Some excerpts:\n\nOn your website, you offer a few âdeleted scenesâ from the Temeraire books, and you note there âI tend to write fast and revise heavily, and I cut liberally.â Tell us a bit more about your writing process: when do you do most of your writing? Where? Do you compose in longhand, or use a computer?\n\nI have no rules other than that I tend to change my rules fairly often. Each book has worked differently. My life has changed quite a lot over the course of writing the seriesâI have a new baby now, so I write from 9:30 to 4:30 because thatâs when I have child care. My natural state of writing is really more writing from 11 in the morning to 3 a.m.; thatâs my intuitive style. I do generally like to work at a fairly fast paceâwhen itâs flowing Iâm getting two to three thousand words a day. I still like to get the skeleton down and then polish it. My single biggest trick for when I need to focus and get productivity is to go somewhere where there isnât internet, so Iâll go to a cafÃ© with a laptop and just write there. Itâs actually getting increasingly hard to avoid the internet, though. I donât really write longhand unless I get stuck; if I get stuck, then what I do is grab a journal and start writing some longhand, and that loosens things up a bit. Once Iâve started, I like so much having the freedom to revise heavily and save different versions that I always really want to be on the computer.\n\nAnything youâd like to tell us about the next Temeraire volume (the eighth)? Have you selected a title yet? Any hint of where Laurence and Temeraire might be off to next?\n\nMy working title for it is âLuck and Palaces,â and I suppose I can give a hint, which is that that is from a translation of poems by WisÅawa Szymborska, and the line is about the city of Kyoto. So thatâs my little hint. The other clue I will give is that itâs the year 1812.\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Naomi Novik.\n\nI had the chance to talk with Jonathan Gottschall about The Storytelling Animal: How Stories Make Us Human, published in April by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.\n\nIf you can give us the nutshell version, what is it about stories (whether it be fiction, or drama, or televised sports, or dreams, or computer games) that makes us as humans so attracted to them, and gives them such a powerful hold over us?\n\nHomo sapiens is this weird sort of primate that lives inside stories, and we donât know why for certain. I cover several competing ideas in the book, but they all break down into two big categories. 1) We like stories because they have hidden evolutionary benefits. 2) The mind isnât designed for story, it has a glitch that makes it vulnerable to story. In the latter view, fiction is like pornâa mere pleasure technology that weâve invented to titillate the pleasure circuits of the brain. I argue that story addiction is mainly good for us: story is a whetstone for the mind, and it acts as a kind of social glueâhelping to bind individuals together into functioning societies.\n\nIt was an experience with a song that prompted you to write this book, as you note in the opening pages. Tell us about that moment, and do you see significant differences in the way humans are affected by stories in different media (print, song, video, &c.), or does the impact tend to be similar?\n\nOne day, I was driving down the highway and happened to hear the country music artist Chuck Wicks singing âStealing Cinderellaââa song about a little girl growing up to leave her father behind. Before I knew it, I was blind from tears, and I had to veer off on the road to get control of myself and to mourn the timeâstill more than a decade offâwhen my own little girls would fly the nest. I sat there on the side of the road feeling sheepish and wondering, âWhat just happened?â I wrote the book to try to answer that question. How can storiesâthe fake struggles of fake peopleâhave such incredible power over us? Why are we storytelling animals?\n\nAnd yes, different forms of storytelling affect us in different ways. Most popular songs are stories set to music, and they evoke powerful emotion. The same goes for films. People respond so intensely and authentically to film, that when psychologists want to study an emotion, like sadness, they subject people to clips from tear-jerkers like âOld Yellerâ or âLove Storyâ.\n\nRead the rest of our interview with Jonathan Gottschall.\n\nLast but not least, Lisa Carey interviewed Melissa Coleman about her book This Life Is in Your Hands: One Dream, Sixty Acres, and a Familyâs Heartbreak, now out in paperback.\n\nWhat made you decide to write this memoir? Was it something you always intended to write about?\n\nSomehow I managed to avoid writing, and talking much, about my childhood for many years, fearing, I think, that I was responsible for some of the tragic things that happened. However, with the birth of my children, the past began urging me to make peace. I also found myself wanting to celebrate the beauty and connection to nature in my childhood, and the amazing effort made by my father, Eliot Coleman, and others, to lay the foundations for todayâs organic food revolution.\n\nHow much research was involved to bring such rich detail to the parts that occurred before you were old enough to remember it? You have your motherâs journals. Did your parents help you otherwise in the process of telling this story?\n\nI began with my own scraps of memories, images from photos, and family stories, but I needed to do a lot of research to fill in the blanks. There was my motherâs journal, numerous news articles about us, books by the Nearings and others, and I tracked down and interviewed many of the apprentices and people who visited us during the 1970s. It was only with the help of all these people, especially my parents, that I was able to tell this story.\n\nWas this a difficult book to write? Or was it liberating?\n\nBoth! Itâs incredibly difficult to dig into painful events in the past, but also very rewarding to let them go and find the beauty beneath. The liberation that came was something like what comes from making compost. You put all these scraps of things into a pile and let them settle and soon enough they turn into black gold, as my father calls compost, the rich soil in which new life can grow.\n\nRead the rest of Lisaâs interview with Melissa Coleman.\n\nCatch up on previous State of the Thing newsletters.\n\nIf you donât get State of the Thing, you can add it in your email preferences.

You can also read it online. It includes a reminder about our Edible Books Contest and more!\n\nFor one of our author interviews this month, I talked to Elizabeth Little about her new book Trip of the Tongue: Cross-Country Travels in Search of Americaâs Languages, published this month by Walker & Company.\n\nWhat was the most enjoyable moment in researching Trip of the Tongue? The worst?\n\nMy most enjoyable moment was, without a doubt"
