        "text": "“Face it, Jared, being too early is the same as being wrong” – Richard Hendricks, Silicon Valley.\n\nFor all of HBOs Silicon Valley’s ‘over-the-top-ness’, the show captures some very real fears within the startup community. One of the core questions in the final episode of season 2 was whether being ahead of the market is truly an irreversible blow to a company. Many founders are hard-wired to think exactly that. But is this truly a reality or just a reflection of our shifting priorities?\n\nAs Scott Amenta puts it: “Millennials, myself included, are incredibly impatient. They’re always looking at the next thing.” Scott is currently the Chief of Staff for Spring, a mobile shopping platform designed to capture the experience of shopping at the world’s best mall.\n\nIt’s very possible that being early does not mean being wrong but rather that there no instant gratification. Today we expect to be able to put something out into the world and receive instant validation. Otherwise it’s just not an idea worth pursuing. But we forget that throughout history most people who have achieved something truly great or impactful were early. From Galileo with the heliocentric solar system to Abigail Adams as one of the greatest political minds in the world, history is littered with brilliant individuals who did not receive validation until after their deaths.\n\nToday the speed of innovation and thinking has shifted that status quo. Now instead of being recognized decades, sometimes centuries later, the validation process can be less than 5 years. Take Steve Jobs. In the 1990s his concepts were ahead of the times and missed the mark. A few short years later Apple and the iPod took off and Steve Jobs became a global icon.\n\nWhat people might be missing is something that Scott realized 3 years into his role with Spring:\n\n“Building Great Companies Takes Time” - Scott Amenta\n\nIt sounds obvious and it should be obvious. But somehow it’s not. Founders feel an entitlement to instant success that is unprecedented in entrepreneurship.\n\nScott continues: “We love to read about the overnight success but in reality those are far and few between. For instance Airbnb has been around for over 7 years but only became a household concept in year 3-4.” Similarly, few people realize LinkedIn was founded in 2002, almost four years before Twitter even existed.\n\nSo what does being early mean? Is it good or bad? Does it matter?\n\nSome of the answers can be found in Scott’s story. Scott joined Spring in 2013, when the mobile revolution was just a whisper. Despite eclipsing desktop shopping in markets across Asia, mobile shopping has yet to hit the western world in the same way. People play around with mobile shopping apps but the core of their shopping is still done on desktop or in person. As Scott says: “We want to recreate the magic of walking into a Soho showroom on the mobile platform”\n\nSoon after launching Spring realized they were early to the market, which forced them to shift their mindset. Scott describes their next steps: “We knew that we had to position ourselves to be the organization solving challenges inherent to mobile shopping, positioning Spring to capture the market when it did come to fruition”.\n\nFor Scott and the rest of the Spring team it meant having to put in the work to understand the customer, market, and build the traction needed for success. They focused on their core pillars: getting the best brands, best products and opportunities, the best shopping experience, and world-class customer service. It comes down to what Scott said earlier, it takes time to build a great business.\n\nIn this case, being too early might be a blessing in disguise. If you launch at the peak of the market you might not have the time to build the right business. Instead you might be stuck constantly reacting to circumstances. It might even lead to some initial success, but it won’t be permanent. Instead if you are early, it forces you to put in the work to build a product that truly adds value.\n\n*Disclaimer: I’m not suggesting that you plod on with any idea you have despite feedback and evidence to the contrary.\n\nInstead find ways to validate your demand. That way you can be more certain there will be an opportunity in the future. Scott states: “Technological adoption follows patterns similar to its predecessors. Mobile is following the patterns of desktop before it, but at a much faster rate. VR/AR will follow as the next medium. Spring is in a position where demand already exists given the natural behavior of consumers already seeking products and convenience. It’s up to us to build an experience that customers choose over other shopping sites and stores.”\n\nWith that knowledge in hand, the Spring team has been able to focus on what matters: building a great company.\n\nScott and I were introduced through a mutual friend: Kunal Mehta. After my prior interview with Kunal, he told me about Scott and I knew we had to connect. Our conversation was one of my first interviews over video but it was a total blast. We covered his story, Spring, Virtual Reality, Artificial Intelligence, E-Commerce, the future of shopping, personal habits, and much more. There’s something here for everyone.\n\nSee our full edited interview excerpt below:\n\nSG: Scott, thanks for taking the time. You know… ever since I watched the West Wing growing up, I wanted the job title, Chief of Staff. Given that a job as Chief of Staff encompasses a little bit of everything, how do you describe what you do?\n\nSA: I was fortunate to join Spring when it was just beginning. I was in conversations with Alan and David (CEO and Chairman) when our team was just a handful of people and I came on board as something of a generalist. I filled roles in the company based on our most pressing needs. Now when you’re that small of a company, everyone has to help out with operations and building from scratch. My background was steeped in business development, fundraising, and sales. With Spring I helped with things ranging from investor pitches, to organizing board meetings, brand partnerships, learning & development, culture, and more. Overtime I went from filling in holes as a generalist to taking on the role of Chief of Staff.\n\nI think it’s a role that every start up is going about defining for themselves. For myself it was very far from an administrative Chief of Staff role or an Executive Assistant. Those roles are very necessary but mine was far more operational. Essentially I’m working with our CEO and leadership team from a macro-level to gather information and assess issues. Operationally, I work on a very micro-level, “in the weeds”, to execute a solution. When there was a problem that affected the company I am a facilitator in solving but also many time the first person on the ground, trying solutions.\n\nSG: Do you like the role?\n\nSA: Absolutely. I think one of the things that draws me to it is the lack of structure. One of my biggest fears was sitting mindlessly behind a deck, a fear reflected in the millennial workforce. I believe, millennials move extremely quickly from job-to-job largely due to two factors. The first is access to information. People are able to find detailed information about alternative opportunities in a way that was not possible in the past. The second factor is a total lack of patience. Millennials are always thinking about what can be better and what comes next.\n\nSG: One of the common themes I see is millennials struggling to find fulfillment. Do you think that is also a factor.\n\nSA: Yes. Our parents grew up with a mindset of making life better for their children. That was the frame through which they viewed the world. For millennials we were taught to ‘follow our dreams’. That was not only acceptable but really their key focus. As a result this generation is looking to find enjoyment in what they do every day. However, I think there is a challenge in understanding that a job is just a job and not fully defining of who you are. Instead you should find fulfillment in your work but be defined by more.\n\nSG: Changing tracks a little. What is the vision for Spring and how has it changed over time?\n\nSA: The vision for Spring is to create the experience of the best mall on the planet, on your phone. Our vision has actually stayed consistent since we started working on it, but our tactics and strategies have changed. We are thinking about the following:\n\n1. How can we take amazing brands and provide them with a platform to sell better to customers while still owning the process\n\n2. How can we give a customer the best shopping experience, brand selection, and service while capitalizing on the mobile wave? In Asia mobile shopping has surpassed desktop shopping but in America it hasn’t really hit his stride.\n\nSG: That’s surprising given how frequently the mobile revolution is referenced. What’s been the most unexpected part of the journey with Spring?\n\nSA: When we first launched we quickly realized we were ‘ahead’ of the market for the mobile experience. We knew that we had to position ourselves to be the organization that was there to capture that market when it did come to fruition. What I didn’t realize is how much infrastructure we’d have to build to support our vision. We ended up building an infrastructure for 1300 of the world’s best brands to sell their product working against nearly 15 years of e-commerce system fragmentation. From payments, to inventory and order management, very few companies used the same technology or operational flows. As a result aggregation of platforms became increasingly difficult.\n\nAdditionally, as a mobile company we planned to launch the app and grow from there. We decided to build a desktop shopping site following the app to be where our customers are already shopping today as they transition to mobile.\n\nSG: Is competition a challenge? How does Spring differentiate itself?\n\nSA: Not to sound too startup-y but we don’t have too many direct competitors in our space. If anything the competition here is proof that there is already built-in demand. For companies like Etsy and Airbnb there really wasn’t pre-existing demand, they really had to understand their target user and build that demand from scratch. For Spring that demand already exists – people will never stop shopping for things they want and as a result we have had to compete or partner with legacy retailers and other marketplaces. Spring is really built upon four key pillars:\n\nGetting the best brands. How do you get the name-brands and most high-demand brands on the platform?\n\nGetting the best products (Direct Relationships w/vendors)\n\nCreating the best shopping experience. All the foundational shopping tools and then improvements like personalization and visual search, and more.\n\nWorld class customer experience. Making sure Spring experience better than brands website and portal experience\n\nSG: Customer experience seems to be a key priority for Spring. For a while a lot of companies de-prioritized that but it seems to be coming back to the forefront.\n\nSA: Well it’s the first thing to go or be outsourced when cutting costs. Personally I’ve always championed the intersection of customer service and marketing. The customer team is the true front line of any business. They know what the customer wants, thinks, and feels better than anyone else in the business and that’s what lasting businesses are built on.\n\nWe also realized there was a major disconnect between the magical feeling you get strolling up 5th avenue or shopping in Soho and the experience of online marketplaces. That’s the void we want to be able to fill.\n\nSG: What’s a technology or consumer trend you think people should be paying more attention too?\n\nSA: I think artificial intelligence will impact society far before we think it will. The AI we see today like Siri or Alexa and in our homes, cars, or internet is very simple. We haven’t really gotten into general intelligence or scratched the surface for super intelligence. I don’t believe in the theory that robots will take over the world. But rather I do subscribe to Ray Kurzweil or Nick Bostrom’s theories around super intelligence and the positive or potentially detrimental impacts it may have for human society. I believe that this technology will come into our lives before we even know it.\n\nSG: Agreed, actually one of my favorite Tim Ferriss episodes with Phil Libin discusses the irrational human fear of machines wiping out humanity.\n\nSA: Interesting you mention that, I’m actually co-producing a film on the side which tackles some of those issues. It’s called Watch Room - it’s an AI / sci fi thriller about 3 scientists working on an AI in virtual reality until their creation learns it's at risk of being shut down. From there the A.I. turns the tables on them and the audience begins to question what is real vs. Virtual Reality. It hits some of the points from Elon Musk’s statements around the probability of living in a computer simulation. It’s been a lot of fun to explore through this lens and we just raised over $45,000 to launch filming and production early next year.\n\nSG: On that note do you think VR/AR will impact the shopping experience?\n\nSA: I think we’re further away than people think, given we haven’t even fully realized mobile. Shopify’s VR store is a great example out there today. VR/AR’s creation and adoption will follow the same patterns as desktop and mobile. I think in the near future there will be experimentation and demos but nothing substantial or mainstream. I think we will more likely see Augmented Reality commerce experiences in the near future. Overlaying information we find so critical online into the real world experience will be groundbreaking. Giving people the ability to touch and feel product while seamlessly reading reviews, or comparing prices as an overlay on the real world solves the disconnect around information or shopping friction in the real world.\n\nSG: Transitioning more to you. What has been the biggest takeaway from Spring?\n\nSA: Before working at Spring I worked at another startup where I was exposed to critical things like building a founding team, creating a product, getting your first sales, and more. Even after 2 years, it wasn’t long enough to realize the company’s full potential. I learned this time around is that it takes time to build a great company. For instance Airbnb has been around for 7 years but only became a household concept in year 3-4. It takes a combination of sufficient time, amazing people, and money.\n\nSG: What are the skill(s) you are looking to develop?\n\nSA: Professionally, one experience I haven’t had is bringing a company or product international. I’ve had lots of experience in NYC but what would it be like to expand or open a service in the Middle East or Asia? It’s definitely an opportunity I’d like to have.\n\nPersonally I’m exploring putting myself out there more publically. I think it’s important to be defined by more than your work and by putting my opinions and content out there I keep a pulse on everything else happening. It also creates new opportunities that don’t come about until you have a presence.\n\nSG: What are some steps you are taking?\n\nSA: Have you heard of A Week Ahead? I wasn’t the one who created this but I’ve started using it recently. Basically it’s an email you send out every Sunday to an intimate group of friends and family. It includes what’s happening in your personal and professional life, goals for the upcoming week, what you’re thinking about the future, questions, and more. I send it to a group of 9 or 10 people.\n\nSG: Sounds like a great accountability tactic.\n\nSA: Absolutely, it’s the people that are close enough that they can honest and upfront with you. It also lets you keep close friends that you don’t get to see regularly in the loop. That way when you do see each other, you don’t spend the whole time playing catch up, but can instead have a deeper conversation.\n\nOur conversation could have any number of takeaways but the ones that resonated the most with me revolved around his approach to building companies. As a generation millennials are prone to jumping from one thing to the next seeking constant gratification. It’s seen in the workplace, in the companies launched, and even in our dating lives.\n\nThese abilities to multi-task, to pursue passion, take risks, and always look to ‘what’s next’ are not bad things. The challenging piece is keeping those attributes in context. As Scott pointed out, at some point you need to be able to commit. Without planning exits and looking for the next thing.\n\nSo to answer the big question. Being early does not always mean being wrong. Timing is certainly a critical driver of success but there’s so much more to it. In the end the companies and the teams that succeed are the ones that can execute well when they have their chance. Being early can be the best way to set yourself up for success."
