        "text": "“Backdraft 2”, which Moviehole first wrote about about in March, has been confirmed by Universal Studios. Shooting is now underway in Romania, with locations also in Toronto and Chicago. The film is expected to be released in 2020.\n\nThe movie \"Backdraft\" from 1991 put the dangers of firefighting on the map for members of the public around the world when it first came out. Firefighters, and others with knowledge of Fire Behavior, were however sadly disappointed in the way the fire effects were rendered, and there was very little in the movie that even remotely reminded firefighters of their working environment, or of any actual backdrafts.\n\nOne can only hope that the producers of the follow-up sequel have engaged better experts within the firefighting community when designing their effects of what it is like to operate within a burning building.\n\nA quick glance at the official trailer for Backdraft 2 shows some promise when it comes to the fire effects, but scenes are short and it is impossible to know if Fire Behavior related scenes will be rendered correctly.\n\nThe original Backdraft did indeed leave a few things to be desired when it came to the rendition of Fire Behavior. However, like already stated, the trailer leaves a desire for more (perhaps not so much in the acting department, but still:-)\n\nThe director is Spanish director Gonzalo López-Gallego, best known for 2011 sci-fi thriller “Apollo 18”.\n\nThe studio has engaged the filmmaker for its “Backdraft” sequel, tentatively titled “Backdraft II”, with filming beginning in Romania, Chicago and Toronto.\n\nWilliam Baldwin is expected to reprise his role from the original 1991 blockbuster.\n\nThe film’s central character will be Sean McCaffrey, the grown son of Kurt Russell’s character from the first film an investigator with the Chicago F.D who still holds his uncle (Baldwin) responsible for the death of his father.\n\nThe villains in this film are a group of agents sneaking a missile out of the country, using a series of deadly fires as a distraction.\n\nJoe Anderson - who played Mason Verger on “Hannibal” - is playing Brian’s nephew Sean McCaffrey. William Baldwin reprises his role from the original.\n\nAlisha Bailey, Ross O’Hennessy, Sal Longbardo and Sia Alipour also among cast. Aside from Baldwin, Donald Sutherland is making an appearance as Ronald, the arsonist from the 1991 original.\n\nRaffaella De Laurentiis will be the producer.\n\nExciting news for fans of the original film, particularly with the character of Brian McCaffrey back, and a capable director in the helmer’s spot. Looking forward.\n\n“Backdraft”, directed by Ron Howard and screen written by Gregory Widen, starred Kurt Russell, William Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Rebecca De Mornay, Donald Sutherland, Robert De Niro, Jason Gedrick and J. T. Walsh.\n\nThe film, made for 75 mill, wasn´t much appreciated by most critics but most audiences loved it for its special effects and action sequences , with many of the actors performing their own stunts.\n\nThe film received three Academy Award nominations for Sound Effects Editing, Visual Effects and Best Sound."
