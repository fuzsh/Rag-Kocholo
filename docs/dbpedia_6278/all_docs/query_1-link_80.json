        "text": "The Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera is easy to travel with because everything you need is built in, making it ideal for food and travel blogs. In this example, the DOP wanted to capture the changing mood of the street market as it moved from sunset into night. Using the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K and compact Olympus and Lumix MFT lenses, the shoot recorded all night using Blackmagic RAW 8:1 with extended video mode onto 256GB CFast cards, shooting great looking images that didnâ€™t have to be color corrected. The cameraâ€™s dynamic range and great low light performance made it easy to shoot inside, outside in late afternoon light, or even at night under the street lights. At night, the cards were mounted onto a laptop, edited it together using the new cut page in DaVinci Resolve, and the content uploaded online!\n\nThe Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera lets you get the same high end image quality of a Hollywood feature film on any budget! In this example, the 6K model was used with EF mount and Atlas Orion 35, 65, and 80mm cinematic lenses. Blackmagic RAW was used so that the original camera image quality could be maintained throughout post with DaVinci Resolve. On set, 128 GB Hagiwara and 256GB SanDisk CFast cards were used so it was quick and easy to backup footage between shots. A small rig was used including a Blackmagic Video Assist 4K, which made it easier for the rest of the crew to follow along, check focus and see framing. The DOP also added SmallRig rails, a Bright Tangerine Revolvr follow focus and a tripod. Whether youâ€™re shooting a drama, romantic comedy, or an action packed thriller, the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera is perfect for indie films!\n\nNow you can grow your fanbase by creating professional looking music videos for your band and posting them online! For this local bandâ€™s shoot, the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 6K was used along with Sigma and Canon professional EF lenses. The DOP shot Blackmagic RAW 8:1, which gave incredible images at a constant bitrate which allowed the crew to know exactly how much storage was needed for each take of the 2:30 song. The 6K footage was edited into an Ultra HD project which meant that there was enough extra resolution to zoom in and reframe the shots, all without losing any quality. In post production this meant that a wide, medium, and close up shot were all able to be used from just a single camera take! A camera cage, sliders and rails were added to help get professional looking fluid movement as the camera moved around the room.\n\nBring online content to a whole new level of professionalism by using digital film! In this example, the content was being shot for a fitness app using the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K with compact Olympus MFT lenses. The dual native ISO was great for getting shots both inside and outside of the gym without having to carry around or set up a light kit! Because of the high dynamic range, detail from external advertising outside the building was visible through the windows, so we handled this by blowing out the windows during color grading. The project was shot at 24 frames per second and the off-speed button allowed for the DOP to quickly switch to higher frame rates to capture exercise in slow motion. Recording Blackmagic RAW 5:1 on a standard 256GB SD card provided enough internal storage to shoot an entire workout without stopping. The 4K modelâ€™s shallower depth of field combined with an iFootage Slider helped to get smooth shots that focus the viewerâ€™s eye on the form of every movement.\n\nNow you can use the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera to elevate your brand by creating high quality corporate videos. Multiple cameras were used shooting in extended video mode to create this campaign for a surf startup. The images look great and donâ€™t need color correction so the production team were able to edit and finish the spot quickly, saving time in post! Blackmagic RAW 12:1 images were captured using the built in CFast 2.0 recorder. The crystal clear high resolution images are perfect for pitching ideas in the boardroom on big screen televisions, for projecting onto massive screens at corporate launch events, and for posting online to followers and potential customers!\n\nWhen shooting a nature documentary, you want the smallest possible rig so you can be unobtrusive and out of sight. The Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 6K is ideal because everything you need is built right in. In addition to its high dynamic range sensor, you also get 4 shock resistant microphones, dual media recorders, and a large touchscreen display with focus assist, peaking indicators and more. Itâ€™s like having a video assist built in! That means everything is self contained and easy to carry so you donâ€™t have to carry around extra monitors, microphones, recorders or other gear. In addition to shooting 6K at 60 fps, you can also record 2.8K images at 120fps for capturing nature in stunning slow motion.\n\nIf youâ€™re a fashion photographer, the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 6K models with EF lens mount is perfect for use on the runway or outdoors on a lifestyle shoot. Itâ€™s small and light enough for you to move quickly so you can capture models from any angle. In addition to shooting cinematic quality digital film images, the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 6K features a still photo button so you can also use it as a 21.2 megapixel still camera. That means youâ€™ll be able to shoot beautiful stills and stunning Blackmagic RAW Q5 digital film images with the same camera! In this example, a variety of Sigma 18-35mm and Canon 24mmâ€‘80mm photographic lenses were paired with Hoya Variable ND filters. With the ISO set to 400, the DOP could shoot full dynamic range images outdoors without a massive lighting rig. For indoor clips, to retain the industrial aesthetic of the shoot, detail in the windows were purposely blown out during color grading.\n\nEverybody wants a beautiful wedding video, but nobody wants a large crew with a massive camera. In this example, the videographer took advantage of the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Cameraâ€™s 6K Super 35 image sensor, Canon EF lenses, and dual native ISO to record with shallow depth of field. This allowed him to create a gorgeous soft bokeh background effect for tender, romantic images that the couple will cherish for years to come. Dual native ISO also let him shoot indoors and outdoors without having to worry about lights. Shooting using Blackmagic RAW 8:1 and 12:1 created images far better than DSLR video in extremely small files. Since weddings are often long events, a high capacity USBâ€‘C SSD and a Blackmagic Pocket Battery Grip were added so that the shoot could continue for hours on end uninterrupted.\n\nThe Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera lets you create virtual open house tours so potential clients can view the property any time! Itâ€™s the perfect shoot to take advantage of the cameraâ€™s high dynamic range and dual native ISO to capture every bit of detail and color from the homeâ€™s interior as well as preserve the highlight details from the windows. Potential buyers can even see out through the windows while watching the clip! The EF lens mount of the 6K models allow wide angle lenses to be used, making the space feel even larger. Extended video mode and Blackmagic RAW 12:1 create small files with gorgeous color that can be edited and posted online fast.\n\nNow you can capture the intensity and action of sports such as mountain biking at up to 60 frames per second in 4K or 6K, giving you crystal clear smooth images. You can even shoot windowed 2.8K resolution video at up to 120 frames per second with the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 6K to create dramatic, high resolution slow motion video. In this example, multiple cameras were positioned around the bike trail to capture the race from different angles and to keep up with the action. With Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera, youâ€™ll be able to capture sporting events at full broadcast quality, just like the big networks!\n\nImagine capturing action sequences, such as a running chase scene, with your own handheld digital film camera! Being light weight and compact in size makes both Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera models great action cameras. You get full Blackmagic RAW image quality built into a camera that you can easily carry on a gimbal, strap to a motor bike, wear on your body, or even put in a crash vehicle. You can even control the camera remotely via Bluetooth to start and stop recording as needed and to change settings which means you can shoot in dangerous situations without having to be too close. If you're shooting yourself, the front mounted record button and tally light makes it super easy to confirm that the camera is on and recording!"
