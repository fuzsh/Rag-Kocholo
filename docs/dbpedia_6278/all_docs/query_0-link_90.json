        "text": "Movies are one of the easiest and most digestible ways to learn about the climate change problems that the world is currently facing. Recently, many films have thoughtfully developed storylines based on actual science and predictions regarding how climate change will play out in the coming years.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more, take a look below at our curated list of the best movies about climate change.\n\n1. Snowpiercer (Amazon Prime)\n\nSnowpiercer is a futuristic class warfare thriller about a train that circles the globe after an Ice Age kills everything but the passengers of that vessel. This move is not for the light of heart! It’s an action-packed and cautionary tale about what our future could look like if we do not address the climate change issues we are facing. This move is made by acclaimed filmmaker Bong Joon-ho. If you like this film, consider watching two other movies by Bong: Okja and The Host. These films wrestle with the effects of ethical growth and pollution – both of which are subjects undeniably connected to climate change.\n\nAs of 2022, Snowpierecer is available for rent on Amazon Prime.\n\n2. Chasing Ice (Amazon Prime, Apple TV, Google Play)\n\nThis 2012 film by Jeff Orlowski observes the melting of Arctic glaciers through the perspective of a nature photographer, James Balog.
