        "text": "We are building a first of its kind fab devoted to processing thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) fabrication in Tempe, Arizona.\n\nTFLN is rapidly emerging as the new darling child of the telecommunications industry. There is a growing consensus that thin-film lithium niobate will most likely become a key enabler of 1.6 and 3.2 terabit modules for data centers. TFLN modulators operate at an extremely low VÏ€-length product which offers the benefit of significantly reducing the overall device size, thereby enabling high-density heterogeneous integration and copackaging. To realize these benefits both a robust supply chain for TFLN wafers and access to commercial fabs that will process TFLN is essential.\n\nThin film lithium niobate, or TFLN, overcomes the biggest limitation of bulk lithium niobate: the inability to tightly confine light. Although lithium niobate itself is an old material with a proven 60 year history of utility as the active element in transducers and non-linear optical components, thin film lithium niobate has many new exciting applications in communications, computing, and more."
