Here, we have developed a new class of ultra-thin spinel structure Li0.5Al1.0Fe1.5O4 (LAFO) films on MgGa2O4 (MGO) substrates with: 1) perpendicular magnetic anisotropy; 2) low magnetic damping and 3) the absence of degraded or magnetic dead layers. These films have been integrated with epitaxial Pt spin source layers to demonstrate record low magnetization switching currents and high spin-orbit torque efficiencies. These LAFO films on MGO thus combine all of the desirable properties of ferromagnetic insulators with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, opening new possibilities for spin based electronics. Ferromagnetic insulators offer low magnetic damping, and potentially efficient magnetic switching, making them ideal candidates for spin-based information processing. Here, Zheng et al introduce a ferromagnetic insulator spinel, Li0.5Al1.0Fe1.5O4, with low magnetic damping, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and no magnetic dead layer.",

        "text": "Structural characterization\n\nLAFO films were grown by pulsed laser deposition on (001)-oriented MgGa2O4 (MGO) substrates (see Methods). Structural characterization of LAFO films indicates excellent epitaxy and crystallinity. Figure 1a shows an atomic resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-TEM) image of the microstructure along the [110] direction with no evidence of defects or interfacial layers which is corroborated by pronounced Kiessig fringes in X-ray reflectivity spectra (Supplementary Fig. S2). Figure 1b shows symmetric 2θ − ω X-ray diffraction (XRD) scans around the (004) peak of 15.1 nm and 4.1 nm thick LAFO films. Clear Laue oscillations can be seen around the 15.1 nm (004) film peak indicating coherent diffraction, whereas the 4.1 nm film is too thin to show Laue oscillations due to the substantial peak broadening associated with the finite film thickness. The film peak is shifted to higher angles compared to that of bulk LAFO indicating the reduction of the c-axis lattice constant. Note that the broadening of the 4.1 nm film peak is not due to poor film quality, but rather due to the lower thickness. Reciprocal space map of the \\((\\overline{1}\\overline{1}5)\\) LAFO and MGO peaks in Fig. 1c further indicates the coherence of the in-plane film and substrate lattice parameters. Note that the RSM is taken on an asymmetric \\((\\overline{1}\\overline{1}5)\\) peak with an out-of-plane component in order to capture information for both the in-plane and out-of-plane reciprocal vectors. Together, these results confirm epitaxial and dislocation-free growth of the LAFO film under coherent tensile strain on the MGO substrate (see Supplementary Material Section 1). Our results in the remainder of the manuscript will be focused on the 15.1 nm and 4.1 nm films. Magnetic characterization will be presented for the thicker film due to its cleaner signal, but SOT experiments will be performed on the thinner film due to its weaker anisotropy and ease of switching.\n\nPt/LAFO heterostructures show an epitaxial relationship between Pt and LAFO. We note that epitaxy does not mean single crystalline or in-plane aligned but merely the registry of the Pt layer with the underlying LAFO layer. This epitaxy differentiates the Pt/LAFO system from other Pt/FMI systems such as Pt/garnet bilayers. In Fig. 2a we show high-resolution TEM of the Pt/LAFO interface in which the transition between LAFO and Pt occurs within a monolayer. This smooth interface is further corroborated by the pronounced Kiessig fringes in X-ray reflectivity (Supplementary Material Section 1). The presence of Pt epitaxy is indicated by a prominent Pt (111) peak as seen in symmetric XRD scans in Fig. 2b. In-plane XRD scans shown in Fig. S2c reveal a complex epitaxial relationship between the Pt and LAFO involving a twinning pattern of the Pt domains, which is diagrammatically represented in Fig. S2d. Due to the three-fold symmetry of Pt [111] out-of-plane oriented unit cell and four-fold symmetry of LAFO/MGO [001] out-of-plane oriented unit cell, the Pt layer exhibit four twins that are rotated in-plane by 30 degrees from each other. This texturing manifests as 12 distinct in-plane peaks shown in (c). This epitaxial, but not in-plane aligned, growth of Pt on LAFO is in contrast to its incoherent growth on other materials26,27. The high quality interface facilitates the efficient transfer of spin current from the Pt to the FMI.\n\nMagnetic characterization\n\nWe performed SQUID magnetometry on LAFO films using an Evercool MPMS by Quantum Design at room temperature. We measure the magnetization as a function of field along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. These measurements show that LAFO films exhibit PMA with bulk saturation magnetization values Ms ≈ 75 kA/m at room temperature. Figure 3a shows magnetization (M) as a function of external magnetic field (H) on the 15.1 nm film. The magnetic easy axis lies out-of-plane along the [001] direction with a low coercivity of 1.6 mT and 100% remanence as shown in Fig. 3b. Conversely the in-plane [100] axis is magnetically hard, requiring a field of about 0.5 T for saturation. The small opening around zero field of the in-plane trace is due to a small misalignment of the sample with respect to the in-plane magnetic field. The origin of the PMA is due to magnetoelastic coupling as a result of the epitaxial bi-axial tensile strain on the film imposed by the substrate (see Supplementary Material Section 3)22,28,29. We show only the data for the 15.1 nm film here, but the Ms and PMA are maintained across a range of LAFO thicknesses (see Supplementary Material Section 2). These results are consistent with the absence of a magnetic dead layer in the TEM data (Fig. 1a) present in other FMI thin film systems16,30.\n\nIn terms of dynamic magnetic properties, LAFO films exhibit extremely low damping values. To characterize the damping, we perform room temperature broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in the out-of-plane direction. We fit each FMR spectra using a Lorentzian derivative lineshape, from which we obtain the FMR linewidth μ0ΔHhwhm and FMR resonance field μ0Hfmr. We then study the dependence of the linewidth and FMR resonance field as a function of the microwave frequency f as shown in Fig. 3c and d. The analysis is described in Supplemental Material Section 3, from which we can extract the Gilbert damping parameter α = (6.4 ± 0.6) × 10−4 and an inhomogeneous broadening of μ0ΔH0 = 1.5 ± 0.1 mT for the 15.1 nm film. This value of α is the lowest reported to date for spinel structure FMI films and is approaching those reported in YIG with PMA5,14,22. The inhomogeneous broadening is also similar to those observed in PMA YIG5. We also extract the Landé g-factor as g = 2.001 ± 0.001 and the effective magnetization μ0Meff = − 445.2 ± 0.4 mT. The value of g is close to the free electron value of 2.0, which implies low spin-orbit coupling. This is not surprising as magnetism in LAFO arises primarily from Fe3+ (with L = 0). The value of Meff is also in excellent agreement with the field required to saturate along [100] as seen in Fig. 3a. In the past, spinel structure magnetic insulators were thought to be advantageous over the garnets due to their simpler crystal structure and lower synthesis temperature, but their damping values were consistently higher22,28,29,31. Our results show that spinel FMIs can also possess damping values that are competitive with the garnets.\n\nSpin-orbit torque switching\n\nTo demonstrate SOT switching in LAFO, we interface our magnet with a high spin-orbit coupled metal, Pt. The Pt layer was deposited via room temperature sputtering on top of LAFO films. The critical current density required for current-induced SOT switching depends on a number of factors, including the anisotropy strength and the spin-charge conversion efficiency of the Pt/LAFO interface. In order to spin-orbit torque switch the LAFO film, we found that minimization of the LAFO thickness, accompanied by a weaker perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, reduces the critical current density for spin-orbit torque switching. Therefore we focus on the 4.1 nm samples in this section. Pt(2 nm)/LAFO(4.1 nm) Hall bars exhibit critical current densities as low as 6 × 105 A/cm2, one of the lowest observed to date for PMA FMIs at room temperature. Figure 4a shows the Hall resistance, Rxy, measured as a function of an out-of-plane magnetic field, Hz, with the linear ordinary Hall contribution subtracted out. The presence of a hysteretic anomalous Hall effect is observed and likely emerges from the transfer of spin angular momentum across the Pt/LAFO interface and allows us to distinguish the up and down magnetization states32. A charge current passing through the Pt generates a spin current that travels towards the LAFO via the spin Hall effect. The direction of the moments in the LAFO imposes the boundary condition at the interface for spin accumulation, which in turn modifies the spin current in the Pt. The modified spin current in the Pt then produces additional transverse voltages via the inverse spin Hall effect, which is detected as a “spin Hall\" anomalous Hall effect. Supplementary Material Section 4 provides a more detailed discussion of spin Hall magnetoresistance effects in Pt/LAFO bilayers.\n\nWe apply 5 ms-long DC current pulses along the Hall bar and measure Rxy after each pulse in the presence of a small in-plane field, Hx, oriented along the current injection axis. Figure 4b shows Rxy as a function of the pulsed current density, JDC, in a field of Hx = ± 3 mT with a critical current density ∣Jc∣ ≈ 1.5 × 106 A/cm2. Typical critical current densities at this field for 4 nm LAFO films range from 1 − 1.5 × 106 A/cm2. Also as seen in Fig. 4b, the switching polarity reverses direction on reversing the applied field direction + Hx → − Hx as expected from the SOT switching mechanism.\n\nTo show that the switching is repeatable, we show Rxy measured during a sequence of current pulses with alternating sign, and magnitude of 7.5 × 106 A/cm2 in Fig. 4c. The value of Rxy switches with the pulses and recovers nearly 100% of its full value of about ± 3.1 mΩ after each pulse, demonstrating consistent and reversible switching. By performing the same switching experiments at different in-plane fields, we observe Jc monotonically decrease with increasing Hx as expected33. This is shown in Fig. 4d, where Jc as low as 6 × 105 A/cm2 is achieved for Hx = 8.5 mT. As a comparison, a study of a YIG(5 nm)/Pt system reported a switching current of 3 × 107 A/cm2 for Hx = 5.0 mT, more than an order of magnitude larger than the corresponding value in our system (Fig. 4d)23. Other studies in YIG and thulium iron garnet systems have reported Jc values on the order of 107 A/cm2 at fields on the order of a few tens of mT5,24. We note however that a comparison of Jc across different systems is not meaningful as the value of Jc also depends strongly on the strength of the PMA and the thicknesses of the magnetic and Pt layers. We also performed SOT switching in a 15 nm LAFO film (Supplementary Materials Section 7), where the Jc is comparable to those reported in Pt/YIG systems due to the larger anisotropy of thicker LAFO films. However, LAFO provides a rare combination of weak PMA at ultra-low thicknesses, both of which help lower Jc. This combination allows the realization of ultra-low Jc at low thicknesses.\n\nThe presence of an in-plane field is necessary to break the symmetry in order to achieve deterministic switching, but is detrimental for device applications. Field-free switching has been achieved in select systems by breaking the symmetry in other ways, including using exchange bias and physically engineering an asymmetric stack34,35. We hope that similar techniques can be incorporated with LAFO in the near future to increase its practicality.\n\nThe SOT switching can also be characterized by SOT efficiency which is a measure of spin to charge conversion of the Pt/LAFO bilayer. SOT efficiency takes into account the spin transparency of the interface and spin Hall angle of Pt and can be estimated with in-plane angular harmonic Hall measurements. An in-plane magnetic field Bext = μ0Hext larger than the anisotropy (see Supplementary Material Sections 4 and 5) is applied at an angle γ with respect to the current channel (Fig. 5a inset) and an AC current is used to measure the Hall voltages. For a system with low in-plane anisotropy, the first (\\({V}_{xy}^{\\omega }\\)) and second (\\({V}_{xy}^{2\\omega }\\)) harmonic Hall voltages are given by36,37,38\n\n$${V}_{xy}^{\\omega }={I}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{rms}}}}}}}}}{R}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{PHE}}}}}}}}}\\sin 2\\gamma,$$\n\n(1)\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{V}_{xy}^{2\\omega }={V}_{\\,{{\\mbox{FL}}}}^{2\\omega }\\cos 2\\gamma \\cos \\gamma+{V}_{{{\\mbox{DL+NE}}}\\,}^{2\\omega }\\cos \\gamma,\\\\ {V}_{\\,{{\\mbox{FL}}}\\,}^{2\\omega }=-\\left(\\frac{{B}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{FL}}}}}}}}}}{{B}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{ext}}}}}}}}}}\\right){R}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{PHE}}}}}}}}}{I}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{rms}}}}}}}}},\\\\ {V}_{\\,{{\\mbox{DL+NE}}}\\,}^{2\\omega }=-\\left[\\frac{{B}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{DL}}}}}}}}}}{2{B}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{eff}}}}}}}}}}{R}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{AHE}}}}}}}}}+{\\alpha }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{ANE}}}}}}}}}+{\\beta }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{ONE}}}}}}}}}{B}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{ext}}}}}}}}}\\right]{I}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{rms}}}}}}}}},\\end{array}$$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Irms is the RMS amplitude of the AC current, RPHE and RAHE are amplitudes of the planar Hall and anomalous Hall effect respectively, BFL and BDL are the field-like (FL) and damping-like (DL) effective fields associated with the spin-orbit torque, αANE is a term characterizing the parasitic contribution arising from the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE), βONE is a term characterizing the contribution from the ordinary Nernst effect (ONE), and Beff = Bext − μ0Meff where Meff is the effective magnetization. Figure 5a shows the angular dependence of \\({V}_{xy}^{\\omega }\\) at Bext = 0.1 T. We fit this to extract RPHE = 92 ± 4 mΩ as per Eq. (1). The relatively large uncertainty is due to a slight variation of RPHE for different applied fields. RAHE ≈ 3.1 mΩ was obtained by measuring Rxy using an out-of-plane field as shown in Fig. 4a. To obtain BFL and BDL, we fit the angular dependence of \\({V}_{xy}^{2\\omega }\\), as shown in Fig. 5b, to extract the FL and DL + Nernst effect (ANE and ONE) contributions, \\({V}_{\\,{{\\mbox{FL}}}\\,}^{2\\omega }\\) and \\({V}_{\\,{{\\mbox{DL+NE}}}\\,}^{2\\omega }\\) as per Eq. (2). Figure 5c and d show the inverse field dependence of these contributions, whose fit allow us to extract BFL and BDL as −0.70 ± 0.03 mT and 30.5 ± 0.8 mT per Jrms ≈ 3.5 × 106 A/cm2 respectively. From the fit in Fig. 5d we also obtain αANE = 19 ± 3 nV and βONE = − 40 ± 20 nV/T, indicating that the Nernst contributions and current heating are negligible.\n\nTo quantify the efficiency of spin-to-charge conversion in our system, we calculate the DL and FL spin torque efficiencies θDL,FL as37\n\n$${\\theta }_{{{{{{{{\\rm{DL(FL)}}}}}}}}}=\\left(\\frac{2| e| }{\\hslash }\\right)\\left(\\frac{{M}_{s}{t}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{LAFO}}}}}}}}}| {B}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{DL(FL)}}}}}}}}}| }{{J}_{Pt}}\\right),$$\n\n(3)"
