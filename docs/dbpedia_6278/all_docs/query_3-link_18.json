        "text": "The Left Hand of God is the fourth episode of the first season of the Apple TV+ psychological thriller Constellation. It aired on February 28, 2024.[1]\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nJo's life back home is not how she remembers it, and growing tension with Magnus adds to her feelings of alienation.\n\nPlot[]\n\nMagnus and Alice are walking through the freezing snow with nothing but the clothes on their backs and a couple extra book bags. By night, they arrive at the cabin, where Magnus assures Alice they'll never see Jo again.\n\nFlashback to Jo's return home, when Magnus and Alice decide to throw her a delayed Christmas and birthday party. That night, they gather around the table to have dinner and tell jokes. Later, Jo asks Magnus if he changed around the cupboards, as she doesn't remember them being in the current state that they are, but he insists that he didn't. He then asks if they can talk about how they left things when Jo went up to space. He feels as though they didn't leave things in a satisfactory way, as Jo didn't look at him when they said goodbye, though Jo has no recollection of this, despite Magnus having only thought about this all year. And the months leading up to her departure were very appalling for him as well, leaving Magnus to question if she still loves him, which she assures him she does while then giving him a hug.\n\nJo awakens from her sleep the following morning after a dream of being back on the ISS. She makes her way to the living room, where she looks at the various photos of her family sitting on the piano, a piano that she doesn't recall having or knowing how to play. Jo then heads to work, where she is greeted with applause from the entire facility.\n\nLater that night, when Joe returns home, she asks Alice in Swedish if she wants to keep or throw away an old book, but Alice doesn't understand until Jo asks her in English. Afterward, Jo resumes her earlier conversation with Magnus, regarding when she left. He is initially hesitant but proceeds to explain that they hardly saw Jo, as she was away training. He then reveals that he had began to wonder if Jo and Frederick were having an affair. Jo insists that she didn't, but while she was gone, Magnus admits to meeting someone. They went for drinks and had one kiss, but that was all, though he was under the impression when Jo came back they'd be over. Jo is upset, but she assures Magnus that she wants nothing more than for them to be together. When she was in space alone, the only thing she could think about was getting home and being with them. Before Magnus can respond, Alice begins calling his name.\n\nHenry has \"stress trauma,\" \"lithium VII,\" and \"death in space\" written on a whiteboard. Meanwhile, Bud awakens on the SS Bernice the morning following him having pushed Ian Rogers off the ship. Bud finds his room and knocks on the door only for the festival staff to answer Rogers' door and tell Bud to go to the main hall for an emergency briefing, at which point the captain announces that they're turning and making a call in Santa Barbara after there was an incident with one of their guests overnight. It's only then that Bud discovers all the cameras on deck of the ship.\n\nWith Henry being a NASA employee, Michaela remind him that no permission was granted for him to go to another space agency with RPL equipment, though he insists the CAL is his. Nevertheless, Michaela tells him his experiment didn't work and that he needs to come home. He's had 10 days with a lot of assistance, but there's no proof that that CAL worked, so they're shutting it down.\n\nJo goes to see a therapist and reveals that she is misremembering things, such as remembering that her car was red when it is actually blue. She also has a piano in her house, despite not playing the piano. Jenny asks if she has hallucinations, which Jo admits that she does; she frequently sees Paul's ghost, and sometimes it feels like she's still up there on the ISS. Jo's conditions seem highly symptomatic of PTSD, Jenny reveals. She's been through a huge trauma, and now she's back to earth, where everything is finally hitting her. Jenny wants to try Jo with a dexamethasone-suppression test and see what her cortisol levels are. In the meantime, Jenny will prescribe Jo lithium to calm her, even as Jo insists that she doesn't want it.\n\nAfter her session, Jo is approached by Henry, who claims to be interested in her research called \"Salugenesis.\" He thinks he may be on the edge of a breakthrough and invites Jo to see the CAL. In his lab, he and Jo discuss the troubles that astronauts have been said to endure upon their return. A couple friends of his from the Gemini IV crew claimed to both have smelled burning toast while in space. One of them even heard a dog barking. Henry recalls being a test pilot pre-Apollo, flying the highest altitude, to the edge of the space. It was pretty common for colleagues to report of powerful forces pressing down on one of the wings of the aircraft above 90,000 feet. They called it \"the left-hand of God.\" Henry knew this guy who lost his six-year-old son, who drowned in the lake during his baby sister's birthday. This friend of Henry's, a couple years later, flying DC-10s over Nevada, heard his son's voice telling him \"Daddy, watch out.\" Noticing that he had plunged into a dive, the guy managed to pull out. Up until the end of his life, he swore his son saved him, and that's the kind of thing that follow them into space. Henry then compares going into space to climbing Mount Everest. Their whole focus is on the summit and if they're not very careful once they've summited, they have to get back down. And that's when people come unstuck. The CAL begins running again, at which point, Jo experiences a brief but excruciating headache. This leads to Jo being drawn by the CAL.\n\nBud calls his daughter Connie and says that his meds aren't working. There were a few good years, but he needs to find a way around it and find a way to get to him. Connie tells him that no one messed with his brain and that he's suffering from delusions. If he's having an episode, she encourages him to take his pills, but he instead throws them in the ocean.\n\nJo and Magnus meet with Alice's teacher Sara, who reveals that Alice often speaks about death and accidents. There's also the cupboards issue, in which she often hides in them. Sara believe that may be their system has lost each other a bit. Alice is 10, but was 9 when Jo left. She wants to change things, and for a year it was just her and Magus. Jo was too far apart, and now that she's back, Alice isn't sure and is possibly haunted by her feelings.\n\nJo confronts Magnus after their meeting with Alice's teacher, questioning what he told Sara, as she knew personal things about them. Magnus instead asks what the therapist said, to which Jo reveals that she was diagnosed with PTSD, though she insists that she's fine and not tell anyone. She then asks Magnus if he finds a problem with her attachment to Alice, which he doesn't. Though, she accuses Magnus of agreeing with everything Sara said.\n\nJo finds Alice's necklace hanging on the closet door. Nervous, Jo demands that Alice come from out the cupboard, which she does. She then tells Alice that she has some old clothes that she may like. After Alice exits the closet, Jo proposes that they have some family time and go away somewhere, like the cabin. Jo pleads with Alice not to shut her out and ask if she's happy that she's back, but Alice isn't sure, admitting that she's a bit disappointed. She thought it would be different when her mother returned.\n\nHenry explains the epicenter of the CAL is a chamber containing a gas of rubidium atoms. Around it is an arrangement of lasers, making electromagnets and magnet traps. To achieve the condensate, the laser is turned to resonate the Atoms. Then, when the lasers turned off, that's when the superposition is formed, Henry reveals to Professor Louis freeman. He describes seeing two black blobs alongside each other and shares the image to Dr. Freeman. He realizes it is an interference effect, which should be impossible and asks what the data shows now, but all Henry has to show is the drawing he made, saying that it doesn't want to be seen, and only he can see it. Without the data, the professor is convinced that what he saw was a false image, but Henry reminds him that the CAL experiment was meant to capture a state in which one particle is in two different states at the same time, however, Professor Freeman isn't convinced, even less so as Henry claims that the results of the experiment can theoretically make themselves visible in different ways, such as not on the screen, but in the mind of an observer, working on the chemistry of the brain.\n\nDownstairs alone, Jo decides to give the piano a try, and much to her surprise, she is a skilled pianist, which startles her, as she has no recollection of ever playing.\n\nBud is approached by FBI agent Bright, who asks what happened to Ian Rogers, given that Bud was the last person seen with him after interrupting him at dinner. Bud claims that he just wanted to talk some sense to Rogers. She heard that he threatened to throw him in the sea, but Bud insists that he's no threat to anyone at his old age.\n\nJo contemplates taking the lithium pills prescribed by Jenny, but that's when she discovers that they look identical to the pills she was given upon her return to Earth. Suspecting they may be the same, Jo heads to the lab at her job, where she tests the material used in both pills and confirms that they are indeed the same, both consisting of Lithium-7, a serotonin inhibitor. Alarmed, Jo goes to her office, avoiding some workmen who don't seem to notice her, and looks through the ISS astronaut medical records. All of her crew was assigned Vitamins (A) except her, who was assigned Vitamins (B). She digs deeper and discovers most people get Vitamins (A), but those who received Vitamins (B) either reported having hallucinations in space or later went crazy and became violent. Much like herself, Henry also received Vitamins (B). Suddenly, the workmen enter her office and begin cleaning it out, though they don't seem to notice her, as Jo is not visible to them, nor can they hear her as she screams at them to stop, that is until she stands directly in front of them, and for a brief moment, becomes visible before vanishing again.\n\nUncertain what's happening, Jo makes her way out of ESA. While leaving, she sees Henry talking on a video chat, but his screen is off. He's talking to his reflection. He then turns in Jo's direction and says: \"Curiosity killed the cat.\"\n\nThe following day, Jo returns to ESA, where Frederick says that he wants her, and he wants them to serve out the contract there before going private, like they planned before she left. However, Jo has no idea what he's referring to. Frederick tries to grab her, but she pulls away, and so he asks her to be honest if she's changed her mind.\n\nJo speaks with Alice's class about her experiences in space, but she can't help but notice Magnus and Sara whispering to each other at the back of the class. So Jo loudly demands to know is Sara is the other woman Magnus previously mentioned, but he doesn't answer. Instead, she angrily goes back to the car, where Jo plans to drive despite being advised against doing so. Aware of the tension between her parents, Alice wants them to put on music, but Jo says it'll distract her, which proves true after Alice begins playing music on her phone, which gives Jo a headache and nearly causes her to crash.\n\nThey return home, where they are joined by Frederick, who tells Magnus about a condition known as astronaut burn out. Fortunately, various space agencies have clinics to treat such conditions, but Magnus doesn't want to see Joe go so soon. Without an intervention, Frederick claims she'll get worse. Magnus questions if Frederick intends to go with her, and then he asks the question he truly wants an answer to: whether or not they had an affair, which Magnus admits they did. Jo joins them and Magnus confronts her as well, but she insists that she doesn't remember. Given her symptoms, Frederick pushes to get her help, but both Jo and Magnus instruct him to leave immediately. Jo swears that she doesn't remember and says that this might not be the same place that she left, but Magnus retorts that it's Jo who has changed. In a fit of rage, Jo slaps all the mail on the floor, at which point, she discovers an envelope from a marine observatory in Denmark.\n\nAgent Bright is in her office watching the surveillance footage from the SS Bernice of Bud and Ian the night he disappeared. It shows them on deck but then the camera appears to become distorted.\n\nInside the envelope, Jo finds a tape cassette, a letter and a transcript. The cassette has two recordings, with the first being Jo on the ISS, and the second is of the apparent death of a female cosmonaut in 1987, which was covered up.\n\nWhile Jo listens to the recording, Alice comes downstairs in search of her father. Once she reaches the bottom of the steps, she sees what appears to be a large gathering of people for Jo's wake. Among those in attendance is Paul and another version of Alice. She screams and returns to the real world, where she is comforted by Jo. Magnus joins them and places Alice in the cupboard to comfort her, much to Jo's dismay.\n\nAfter making sure Alice is situated, Magnus joins Jo in the kitchen, where she questions why he allows Alice to be in the cupboard. He explains that she simply scared and wants to hide, and she's been that way for a while. Magnus urges Jo to take the pills that Jenny gave her, but she refuses as they're antipsychotics, both sets, meaning there's a concerted effort to get her on antipsychotic medication. They want to deny what she saw in space, but Magnus simply insist she take the pills, tired of her rambling. Now realizing that Frederick is right about Jo needing to be treated at one of the astronaut burnout facilities, Magnus decides to call him, but Jo refuses to allow him to do so and knocks Magnus over in an attempt to take the phone, causing him to hit his head and thus rendering him unconscious.\n\nCast[]\n\nStarring[]\n\nNoomi Rapace as Jo Ericsson\n\nJonathan Banks as Henry Caldera & Bud Caldera\n\nJames D'Arcy as Magnus Taylor\n\nRosie Coleman & Davina Coleman as Alice Ericsson-Taylor\n\nJulian Looman as Frederic Duverger\n\nSupporting[]\n\nChipo Chung as Michaela Moyone\n\nClare-Hope Ashitey as Agent Lenora Bright\n\nMona Vojacek Koper as Agent Iona Frost\n\nBettina Hoppe as Jenny Gruber\n\nReiner Schöne as Professor Louis Freeman\n\nMichel Diercks as Jimmy Wangel\n\nJoshua Spriggs as Conspiracy Theorist\n\nRankin Duffy as Pupil in Classroom\n\nThilo Prothmann as Otto, Cleaner\n\nJoachim Foerster as Stefan, Cleaner\n\nHolly Horne as Connie Caldera (voice)\n\nGallery[]\n\nPromotional images[]\n\nEpisode guide[]"
