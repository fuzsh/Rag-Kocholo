        "text": "PALACE COUNCIL, by Stephen L. Carter (Vintage Contemporaries, $15.) This implausible but entertaining thriller, set between 1962 and 1975, involves a clandestine fraternity of powerful white men working to overthrow the democratic processes of the United States with some prominent black allies. Two complicated and appealing main characters search for truth about loved ones and come to love each other in an absorbingly depicted wealthy Harlem milieu. “There is . . . a fine novel begging to get out of all this,” our reviewer, Thomas Mallon, said, praising Carter’s “writerly effects.”\n\nHOUSE OF WITS: An Intimate Portrait of the James Family, by Paul Fisher (Holt, $20.) The James family story has been often told, in individual and group biographies, but Fisher argues that no previous work has taken into account late-20th-century scholarship on same-sex love, gender, illness, repression and alcoholism. Fisher brings an enormous amount of research to his portrait of a complicated family that strikes him, he says, “as curiously contemporary.”\n\nTHE SPIES OF WARSAW, by Alan Furst (Random House, $15.) Furst’s spy thrillers are infused with a melancholy romanticism and focus on the moral ambiguities the characters face. This book follows a de Gaulle-like French aristocrat, based in Warsaw in 1937, who studies German preparations for war.\n\nTHE STONE GODS, by Jeanette Winterson (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $13.95.) This scary, beautiful novel envisions a post-apocalyptic future — actually, several of them. Amid ecological disaster and impending war, scientists, space captains and Robo sapiens grapple with love and fate. “The Stone Gods” is “a Baedeker for Earth’s future,” Susann Cokal wrote in the Book Review.\n\nORIGINS, by Amin Maalouf. Translated by Catherine Temerson., (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $15.) (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $15.) Maalouf is a historical novelist who has also written about the vagaries of identity. In this lovely memoir, he examines the past of his Lebanese family, “wanderers who have lost their way.” In Paris, where he has lived for 30 years, he is warmed by a long white scarf knit for him by his grandmother. A young man’s journey from Los Angeles to his father’s deathbed in Beirut is the framing tale in THE HAKAWATI, by Rabih Alameddine. (Anchor, $16). The narrator and his relatives exchange tales (hakawati is Arabic for storyteller), some dealing with contemporary events, others drawn from ancient literature, all shaped by Alameddine’s comedic sensibility. “Listen,” he begins. “Let me tell you a story.”\n\nHEAD CASES, (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $15.) Mason, a brain injury case manager, describes the day-to-day life on a brain injury ward and the struggles of its patients. “Is there a part of me that can’t be changed by a brain injury?” Mason asks. The answer appears to be no. (Oddly, the best place for an American to suffer a brain injury is Iraq, where the Balad Air Base hospital provides a “gateway” to “the most aggressive medical system in the world.”) In CAN’T REMEMBER WHAT I FORGOT: YOUR MEMORY, YOUR MIND, YOUR FUTURE (Three Rivers, $14.95), Sue Halpern sets out to discover what scientists really know about dementia, educating herself by undergoing several brain scans. Unfortunately, she reports, there is no solid proof that anything stems memory loss — other than exercise. (It’s good to eat blueberries, though.) Jill Bolte Taylor was a neuroscientist working at Harvard’s brain research center when, in 1996, she had a stroke. Curiously, it felt great — the failure of her left brain lobe, the site of ego, analysis and judgment, made her feel like “a genie liberated from its bottle,” she writes in MY STROKE OF INSIGHT: A BRAIN SCIENTIST’S PERSONAL JOURNEY (Plume, $15). Now recovered, she urges people to live more spiritual lives by sidestepping the left brain.\n\nA VENGEFUL LONGING, by R. N. Morris (Penguin, $15.) In this sequel to “The Gentle Axe” – “CSI: St. Petersburg,” our reviewer, Liesl Schillinger, called it — Morris returns to the city in the late 1860s. His protagonist, once again, is Porfiry Petrovich, who solved Raskolnikov’s crime in Dostoyevsky’s “Crime and Punishment.” Here, Petrovich discovers a link between three apparently unrelated murders in a novel that is richly evocative of its time and place.\n\nSOLDIERS OF REASON: The RAND Corporation and the Rise of the American Empire, by Alex Abella (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $15.95.) “All of us are bastard children of RAND,” Abella writes in this comprehensive history, the think tank’s first. RAND helped shape nuclear strategy, health care (it developed the idea of deductibles and co-payments) and, through its championing of rational choice theory, the Reagan revolution and the current economic crisis. Not to mention the Vietnam War."
