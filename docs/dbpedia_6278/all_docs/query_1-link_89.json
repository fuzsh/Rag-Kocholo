        "text": "Abortion, Corruption and Cops - The Bertram Wainer Story\n\nIn 1967 a young woman came to Dr Bertram Wainer's Melbourne surgery seeking emergency medical treatment after a backyard abortion. She was desperately ill yet too afraid to go to hospital. For Wainer this was the start of a long, hard struggle to overturn laws that made abortion an offence punishable by up to 15 years in jail. In the process he uncovered a web of corruption involving highly paid doctors, backyard abortionists, high-ranking police and power-broking politicians. It would lead to attempts against his life and the first major public enquiry into a state police force, as he fought to make abortions accessible, affordable and safe.\n\nAeroplane Dance\n\nOn December 1, 1942 a US bomber called Little Eva was returning to base after a bombing raid over New Guinea. The plane hit a tropical storm and crashed at Moonlight Creek in the Southeast corner of the Gulf of Carpentaria, in Australia's far north. The events which followed were recorded both in the journal of an American survivor and in a spectacular corroboree created by the Yanyuwa people who searched for Little Eva and her crew. The film brings together American and Yanyuwa tales of war, with drama, song and dance.\n\nThe Art of War\n\nIn THE ART OF WAR, Betty Churcher brings her unique perspective to a series on Australian art inspired or provoked by a century of conflict, from World War One to the “war on terror”. A personal exploration of art rather than a comprehensive history, it reveals how dramatically attitudes to war have changed, and how radically the trauma of war has changed art itself. With images from official war artists, soldiers on the frontline or in POW camps, civilians in concentration camps and those on the homefront, it is a story of unknown artists and famous names such as George Lambert, Nora Heysen, Wendy Sharpe and Sidney Nolan.\n\nAustralian Biography II\n\nThe AUSTRALIAN BIOGRAPHY series profiles some of the most extraordinary Australians of our time. Many have had a major impact on the nation’s cultural, political and social life. All are remarkable and inspiring people who have reached a stage in their lives where they can look back and reflect. Through revealing in-depth interviews, they share their stories - of beginnings and challenges, landmarks and turning points. In so doing, they provide us with an invaluable archival record and a unique perspective on the roads we, as a country, have travelled.\n\nAustralian Biography IX\n\nThe AUSTRALIAN BIOGRAPHY series profiles some of the most extraordinary Australians of our time.

Besides scrutinising one key work in close detail, each film reveals, wherever possible, the artist's drawings and studies for that work, and shows other related works. Many little known paintings from private collections have been included. Living artists have been recorded, talking about their techniques and the ideas behind their paintings. The letters and journals of earlier artists are drawn on, as well as the views of critics of the day.\n\nThe Australian Eye series 3\n\n1. CONCILIATION, THE Executed in 1840 by Benjamin Buterrau, this was Australia's first 'history' painting. The film relates the sad fate of the Tasmanian Aborigines who were persuaded to leave their tibal lands and move to a settlement on Flinders Island. 2. EPIPHANY This powerful, sombre painting (1962) is a splendid example of Ian Fairweather's art at its most complex and spiritual. The film scrutinises and illuminates the intricacies of the work, drawing on rarely seen related works from privated collections. 3. LAKE ST. CLAIR William Charles Piquenit, the first Australian born professional painter, developed his art as a landscape painter while working with the Tasmanian government's survey department. Whilst his work declined in popularity with the rest of Australian Impressionists, Piquenit's subtle and brilliant technique comes through strongly in this film. 4. MAN FEEDING HIS DOG This small, but powerful painting (1941) hauntingly combines starkness with lyricism. It is a key work in Ruseel Drysdale's oeuvre. In narration especially recorded for the film, the artist speaks of his problems in painting the work and of the realiationsip between, man and landscape. 5. MOTHER, THE The Mother (1907) by George Lambert, is a portrait group, rich full in tone, painted in bold, sweeping curves.It shows Lambert's wife, their two sons and their friend, the artist Thea Proctor. The film reveals the range and qualtity of Lamberts's best work from various periods of his life as painter, war artist and sculptor. 6. MOUNT WILLIAM FROM MOUNT DRYDEN The film reveals how Eugen Von Guerard's training in the naturalistic German school of Romanticism, coupled with his strong feeling for geometry and composition , enabled him to produce paintings that express reverence for Nature's mysterious processes as well as an appreciation of the splendours of the Australian landscape. 7. SPIRIT OF EMU PLAINS, THE This is undoubtedly Sydney Long's finest work (1897) . A synthesis of decorati\n\nThe Australian Eye series 4\n\nPart 1, EXPRESSIONIST EYE, THE The film provides an understanding of that rebellious period when the course of Australian art took a new direction and a new lease of life, under the influence of European Expressionsim. Paintings by John Percival, Danila Vassiflieff, Josi Bergner, Joy Hester, Arthur Boyd, Sidney Nolan and Albert Tucker are examined and Nolan, Boyd, Bernard Smith, John Reed and others contribute to the soundtrack. Part 2 FLYING OVER THE SHOALHAVEN RIVER Margaret Preston was one of the few artists who has tried to absorb the spirit of Australian Aboriginal art into Modernist painting and FLYING OVER THE SHOALHAVE RIVER is a powerful and orignal work. The film examines several other masterly works by this dynamice artist. Part 3 MINING TOWN The sub-title for MININT TOWN (1946-47) is 'Casting the Moeny-Lenders Out Of The Temple' and Arthur Boyd, who recorded narration for the film says: 'The picture is a symbol of corruption, goodness, tranquility and other qualities of life'. This is a comples allegorical work in whcihc Boyd's very personal imagery is at its richest iexpressing the universal themes of love and oppression, of life and death. Part 4, STRINGYBARK CREEK Besides conveying a rich impression of the first Kelly series and in paritcular of one of its finest canvases STINGYBARK CREEK (1946-47) the film also shows a number of Sidney Nolan's earlier Melbourne paintings. Part 5 VICTORY GIRLS wartime Melbourne created in Albert Tucker 'a deep sense of alienation, of continualstress'. This was the period when Tucker painted both VICTORY GIRLS and his famous series 'Images of Modern Evil'. The film studies a number of these disturbing works and the artist gives a vivd description of the origins of VICTORY GIRLS as well as talking of the way certain obsessive images from his unconscious take over the design of pictures.\n\nThe Australian Eye series 5\n\nBased on the principle that the more one knows about a work of art the better one can appreciate it, this series makes a detailed examination of many of Australia’s most outstanding paintings. Besides scrutinising one key work in close detail, each film reveals, wherever possible, the artist’s drawings and studies for that work, and shows other related works. Many little known paintings from private collections have been included. Living artists have been recorded, talking about their techniques and the ideas behind their paintings. The letters and journals of earlier artists are drawn on, as well as the views of critics of the day.\n\nBaby Boomers\n\nGrowing up in Australia in the 1950s. The program explores the lives of people who were the products of the emotional reunions after World War II, and those who were born in the boom that continued until the mid-1960s. These were the days when kids swung on the Hills Hoist; mum bottled fruit; bread and milk were delivered on carts; and there was sawdust on the floor of the butcher's shop. Built around the recollections of people who grew up in this period, the program is based on the book 'Baby Boomers' by Helen Townsend, whose family - including TV personality Simon Townsend - appear throughout the program. Home movies, newsreels and documentary footage combine to present images of an Australia that has all but vanished.\n\nBelinda's Baby\n\nBelinda Wardlaw Jones is one of the few women in Australia to be born with a rare form of muscular dystrophy, an incurable muscle-wasting disease which can drastically reduce life expectancy. Despite her condition and against the advice of many, she and her husband Andrew decide to have a child. Belinda defends her decision to proceed with this pregnancy, believing it to be her right to become a mother, whatever the medical risks and the ultimate social costs may be.\n\nBig Brother of Christmas Island\n\nPhosphate rich Christmas Island rears out of the Indian Ocean only ten degrees south of the Equator. It was first mined by the British and then by the Australians. The British Phosphate Commission (BPC) ran the Island like a Raj outpost, exploiting cheap Asian labour and practising a form of apartheid. Gordon Bennett, a hard drinking Englishman, came to the remote Australian territory in 1979 to become General Secretary of the Union of Christmas Island Workers. Appalled at what he found, Bennett was determined to dismantle the archaic and racist institutions on the island. The film traces attempts to crush the tiny union and shut down the mine.\n\nBingo, Bridesmaids And Braces\n\nThe third in a series of films, BINGO, BRIDESMAIDS AND BRACES captures with candid honesty, the lives of three working-class women as they grow up from the “not so innocent” age of 14 to “it’s happening too fast” at 18, through to “well, we survived” at the ripe old age of 26. During these 12 fast and furious years they discover exactly what life has in store for them - the good, the bad and the unexpected. BINGO, BRIDESMAIDS AND BRACES accurately highlights the three stages of their lives through their unique relationship with acclaimed director Gillian Armstrong.\n\nBitter Rice\n\nBITTER RICE is a one-hour documentary examining the political struggle in the Philippines - a country with a long tradition of revolution, dating back to Spanish and American colonisation and Japanese occupation. It focuses on the life and exploits of Bernabe Buscayno, alias Kommanda Dante, legendary figure, founder of the New People's Army, and long time defender of the people. This gripping documentary looks at Dante's recent efforts to bring about political and economic change by establishing the People's livelihood Foundation - an open cooperative for rice farmers in Capas, which represents the people's struggle to earn from their land... So far the struggle has been peaceful.\n\nBreathing Space\n\nMelissa, 21 and Nicki, 35 will die without a transplant. Melissa has already waited two years and 32 days. The right donor lungs may not come in time. She doesn't think she will make her next birthday. Nicki, her heart and lungs damaged beyond repair by thalidomide, has defied early death since she was six. Nicki decides to take her destiny in her own hands. She will decide when and if to have the transplant. Should she go on the waiting list? Has she already left it too late? Will her gamble pay off? Nicki must decide.\n\nBuried Country\n\nWhere African-Americans turned to the blues, Aboriginal Australians found inspiration in country and western and created a style of their own. From the bush to the city, Aboriginal people have used country music to tell their stories of life and the struggle for justice. Featuring rare recordings, archival images and first-hand interviews with the singers and songwriters, BURIED COUNTRY traces six decades of this rich tradition. What emerges is not only a poignant record of Indigenous Australia, but also a celebration of how music can lift the human spirit.\n\nCapitalist Drive\n\nA very personal account of one family and its links across two continents and three generations, despite political divides. In CAPITALIST DRIVE, Barbara Chobocky turns the camera on her own extended family to discover how ordinary people cope with social and personal upheaval. She explores the parallels between her enterprising cousins negotiating the first years of free-market democracy in the Czech Republic and the post-war migration of her immediate family to what her father called 'the Wild West' - a new life in Australia. Along the way, she uncovers stories of love and loss, and a rather eccentric attachment to cars.\n\nThe Celluloid Heroes\n\nTHE CELLULOID HEROES is a four-part series that traces the history of Australian cinema from its origins to the 1990s. It recognises Australia’s great talent, both on the screen and behind the camera. These Australian heroes have struggled to master and refine the art of cinema from its birth. Through their work they have made an enormous contribution to the way Australians see themselves, as well as the way they are seen by the world.\n\nColour of War - The Anzacs\n\nThis is the story of Australia and New Zealand at war as never seen before. For the first time, only original colour footage is used to paint a vividly detailed picture of these closely allied nations, from the build up to World War II to the end of the Vietnam conflict. Newly discovered films and home movies along with diary and letter extracts allow viewers a very personal connection with the war experience, both on the battlefield and on the homefront. In colour, that shared history becomes even more intimate and involving. Narrated by Russell Crowe, this powerful and moving three-part series captures the thoughts and feelings of ordinary people caught up in world-shattering events.\n\nConstructing Australia: A Wire Through the Heart\n\nAustralia in the mid 1800s was a land isolated by distance and divided by two very different cultures. John McDouall Stuart's incredible crossing of this inhospitable land enabled Charles Todd to construct a telegraph line through the heart of the continent, bringing Australia to the world and the world to Australia. Its construction heralded the start of a new communications era every bit as revolutionary as the internet. News from overseas arrived in hours rather than months, securing Adelaide's position as the centre for early colonial communications. It made Todd a hero - but it cost Stuart his life.\n\nConstructing Australia: Pipe Dreams\n\nAs Australia was beginning its life as a new nation, a tragedy was unfolding. From the remote coast of Western Australia, to deep within its inhospitable interior, an immense water pipeline was being constructed that would unlock countless riches and help build the nation. But the ambitious dream of political visionary Sir John Forrest and engineering genius Charles Yelverton O'Connor would end in tragedy. In their struggle against the forces of nature, and the forces of politics, one would be proclaimed a national hero, while the other would be driven to his death.\n\nConstructing Australia: The Bridge\n\nMassive, majestic, breathtaking - the Sydney Harbour Bridge was the greatest engineering challenge of its day anywhere on earth. Completed during the Great Depression, it is the legacy of a fateful partnership between two very different men - a brilliant engineer and a maverick politician - who shared a relentless ambition to create 'the people's bridge'. Celebrating the 75th anniversary of one of Australia's most loved icons, this is the epic and definitive story behind the building of the bridge and the vision of those who made it happen, despite personal conflict and political intrigue.\n\nCouldn't Be Fairer\n\nCOULDN'T BE FAIRER is an extraordinary depction of a side of Australian Aboriginal society which is hidden from the eyes of most white people. With unflinching honesty it depicts the problems of alcoholism, racial violence and political oppression still faced today by the first Australians, using astutely selected archival footage to provide historical depth. With the context of the Aboriginal land rights battle in Queensland, Aboriginal activist Mike Miller allows us to hear the voices of Aboriginal Australians as they discuss the effects that commercial enterprises like tourism and mining have had on their communities. What emerges are disturbing images of Aboriginal poverty and white prejudice in a film which makes a hard-hitting statement about racial conflict.\n\nDarwin's Brave New World\n\nDarwin’s Brave New World is the story of how four young voyagers to the Southern Hemisphere changed our world, forever. The epic adventures of Charles Darwin, Joseph Hooker, Thomas Huxley and Alfred Russel Wallace revolutionized science, turned society on its head and gave birth to an extraordinary theory about the evolution of life on earth. In this brilliant three-part dramatised series, we take a fresh look at Charles Darwin’s oft-overlooked experiences in New Zealand, Australia and the Cocos & Keeling Islands and discover that these extraordinary places were crucial in formulating his radical theory of evolution. Australasia was also critical in forging the lives and careers of Darwin’s greatest allies: Joseph Hooker, Thomas Huxley and Alfred Russel Wallace. These three men would support and defend Charles Darwin through years of illness, isolation, agonizing self-doubt and religious crisis. Without their courage and tenacity, Darwin may never have published On the Origin of Species – his great work about evolution and a book that changed the way we understand our world and our place in it.\n\nDivorce Stories\n\nAround 200,000 Australians marry every year. Over 43 per cent of these marriages will fail. This three-part series takes a close-up and personal look at divorce as people reveal their experiences, from marriage to breakup, conflict to compromise. We go inside homes, mediation offices and the courtroom to hear from couples, their children, judges and a private investigator. The result is an honest and compassionate exploration of an important contemporary issue - one that is having a huge impact not just on individuals, but on our society and our future.\n\nDo Your Utmost\n\nTwo Japanese students strive to \"do their utmost\" within the confines of their society. Yuichi attends a cramming college, where he hopes to gain exam success and entry to a university course of his choice. Once there, he is almost guaranteed a degree and a good job but, in the meantime, the price is loneliness and rigorous lectures in classes of up to 500 students. Fumiko is a 19 year old studying to become a pop star, against her parents' wishes. Even if she does make it, her managers will reap more financials rewards than she will ever receive. Her breakthrough comes when she is hired to sing for a TV commercial.\n\nDownunder Grads\n\nIt’s the start of the semester at one of Australia’s top universities and 37,000 students, are about to embark on their studies. University is make or break time; a time that can change people forever. From free education in the 1980s to HECS fee debt and a large increase in full fee paying students, university education is now big business. Through a variety of character stories this four-part series explores the contemporary Australian university experience of both international and Australian students from a range of different backgrounds.\n\nEndo What?\n\nThe film explains a common problem of menstruating women, endometriosis. Lack of knowledge of this condition has meant that it has frequently remained undiagnosed by doctors for long periods of time. Lack of treatment oftern results in acute chronic pain and infertility. Women sufferers, doctors and alternative health practitioners all contribute to a comprehensive discussion on what 'Endo' is: its symptoms, the available options for treatment and its psychological effects. The importance of understanding from friends and family and the positive role of support groups in providing information and reassurance are highlighted. This program dispels the myths about endometriosis and offers positive suggestions for coping effectively with this condition.\n\nEvery Inch Of The Way\n\nDuring World War II thousands of Australian were placed in Japanese prisoner of war camps. Between 1942 and 1945 8,000 of them died in captivity. Those who survived remember the starvation, disease and trauma to which they were subjected. In EVERY INCH OF THE WAY, survivors of the camps describe their experiences during the war, the effect it has had on their lives and their families. Even now, years later, they are still fighting the memories.\n\nFacing the Music\n\nInside the halls of Sydney University’s Music Department, talented young students create sublime music in a setting that’s far from serene. After nearly a decade of relentless government funding cuts, Professor Anne Boyd is struggling to preserve basic standards. But Boyd is an innocent when it comes to harsh economic realities and the very qualities that are her strengths as a composer and teacher - her passion and dedication - leave her vulnerable. Forced to drop staff and courses and pick up the phone to plead for private sponsorship, the usually conservative Boyd is forced to fight for what she believes in. The problem is, how long can she continue?\n\nFacing the Music Lyndall Hendrickson's Way\n\nBorn in 1917, Lyndall Hendrikson's life has been one of extremities, from childhood violin prodigy to fame and wealth, to polio, paralysis and recovery. She has received worldwide acclaim for her innovative methods for teaching music, and achieved remarkable success both with very gifted children as well as those with severe autism. The film focuses on Lyndall's current work with 11-year-old Patrick Farley. Autistic, disabled and unable to speak, he did, however, display innate musical ability of a rare order. The film reveals one woman's dynamic exploration of life and presents two parallel tales of metamorphoses: a prodigy overcoming polio to become a teacher and an autistic boy blossoming with the aid of music.\n\nFamily: At The End of the Day\n\nAT THE END OF THE DAY is the Australian episode from a series of documentaries on the lives of ten families from ten different countries. The Australian episode takes you into the home of the Coles family. Jenni and Michael have children from each of their first marriages and children from this marriage. Conscious that Australia can no longer guarantee the future for its children that it once did, the Coles' have moved from the city to the country to undertake a venture which they hope will be long-term and provide for the children as they grow up - the farming and distribution of water chestnuts.\n\nFilm Australia's Australia\n\nThe series deals with changes in the physical, social, cultural, political and economic spheres of Australian life, using material dating from the beginnings of filmmaking in this country in the early 1900s. The archives of Film Australia were searched in order to produce this visual and aural record of the nation's past. Then, as now, filmmakers were focusing their cameras on Australian people and their lives, playing the role of social commentator. The filmmakers' viewpoints over a period of 80 years or so provide valuable insight into the forces that have shaped us and are continuing to shape the way we think and act.\n\nFilm Australia's Immigration DVD\n\nWhen Australia embarked on its mass migration program after World War Two, it was with a movie camera in hand. Film Australia, as the Government’s film unit, made films to attract migrants and to change attitudes to new arrivals. More recently, it made films about how migrants themselves were changed by coming here and the impact they had on shaping the nation. Film Australia’s Immigration presents a selection of fascinating films from this historically significant collection, along with contemporary interviews with some of the people who made them and some who were in them. Combined with a website and study guide, this DVD is a superb educational resource. An illuminating exploration of immigration and Australia - the people, policies and propaganda.\n\nFilm Australia's Outback DVD\n\nThe Australian outback - real and imagined - is captured in a diverse and fascinating selection of films from the Film Australia archives. This innovative DVD includes some of the nation's most acclaimed documentaries from the early 20th century until today, as well as an award-winning animation and a short Henry Lawson drama. In addition to the films themselves, a wealth of behind-the-scenes information has been included, from interviews with the filmmakers to a gallery of production stills. A website link, providing access to material such as storyboards and production notes and a comprehensive study guide, makes this a powerful teaching tool as well as an entertaining introduction to life in Australia's remote areas.\n\nFlashpoint\n\nDavid, a fresh-faced new worker at the iron mine, discovers that his friend, Foxy, confident, assured on the job, is really insecure, uncertain of himself and of his attractive wife Vicky. In an isolated mining town where there are 50 single men to a single woman, the human flashpoint is set low. The miners are an explosive force and the woman - one woman, Foxy's wife, is the fuse. Many men have been wary of igniting it but, without realising what he is doing, it is David who eventually provides the spark.\n\nThe Floating Brothel\n\nThree women uncover the rags-to-respectability tale of their ancestors - the feisty convicts who became the unlikely founding mothers of modern Australia. In 1789, the fledgling penal settlement in Sydney was battling to survive, but help would come from a most unlikely quarter. This is the rip-roaring tale of The Lady Juliana and the boatload of streetgirls, thieves and con-women who sailed to the ends of the earth to breathe life and a sense of enterprise into a dying colony. Together they would give Australia something much more - a future.\n\nFor Who I Am: Bonita Mabo\n\nMany people know of Bonita Mabo, widow of the late Eddie Mabo, and the historic native title claim they successfully fought on behalf of his Torres Strait Islander people. Few realise that Bonita is an Australian of South Sea Islander and Aboriginal descent, or how, through decades of work for Indigenous rights, she raised 10 children, often single-handedly. Since her husband's death, Bonita has a new campaign and recognition for her own people. In this program, she looks back over decades of struggle and commitment and speaks of the pride she takes in sharing her heritage with her grandchildren and the wider community.\n\nFrom Little Things Big Things Grow\n\nKev Carmody is a prolific songwriter and musician with a great sense of humour. He has performed with Paul Kelly and Billy Bragg, both of whom appear in the film. When Kev released his first album, 'Pillars of Society', in 1989, music magazine Rolling Stone described it as 'the best album ever released by an Aborigine and arguably the best album ever made in Australia'. Kev was propelled onto the national stage as a voice of protest for black Australia. This film looks at Kev up close.\n\nThe Gamblers\n\nGambling in Australia is in the midst of unprecedented change. In the past decade, punting has gone from a quaint trait to a national obsession driven by transnational corporations and revenue-hungry governments. Today, there are more forms of legalised gambling in Australia than anywhere else in the world and Australians spend more on betting than people in any other nation. Going behind the scenes of the gambling industry and into the lives of the gamblers themselves, THE GAMBLERS looks at these extraordinary changes as they take place. The stories are told from the points of view of those on the frontlines: a casino executive, a race track manager, a bookie and a professional punter, a suicidal addict, and an anti-gambling crusader. Together, they tell the story of a nation gripped by gambling.\n\nGetting Even: Women In Australian Politics\n\nIn 1902, Australia became the first country in the world to grant white women both the right to vote and to stand for election. Despite this early achievement, by 1994 women occupied fewer than 15% of Australia's parliamentary seats. GETTING EVEN asks why there are so few women in Parliament and what should be done to remedy this. What emerges from interviews with some of our most significant female politicians is the similarity of their experiences, no matter in which government they served or to which party they belonged.\n\nGetting Straight\n\nFilmed in the style of direct cinema over five days in the detoxification unit of a Sydney hospital for alcoholics and hard drug addicts which appears to be run along lines suggested by Alcoholics Anonymous. Several patients are followed and, in two cases, during their first day outside. The director, himself an alcoholic, reflects on his relationship to the film. At times he enters into dialogue with the subjects who also on occasions acknowledge the presence of the camera. One of a series of seven documentary films about contemporary Australian society. Each program offers a perspective on a different aspect of Australian life.\n\nGone to a Good Home\n\nFor three decades, from the 1950s to the 1970s, Australian authorities pressured many unmarried mothers to give up their babies for adoption into what they considered \"better\" homes - those of married couples. At a time when society had no place for single mothers and their illegitimate children, these women were unaware of their legal rights. Sometimes they were coerced, even drugged, and their babies literally stolen. Despite arguments that the practice was well-intentioned, for the individuals involved the ongoing impact has been devastating. This documentary explores the experiences of these women and their efforts to contact their children and gain recognition for past wrongs, while revealing the dramatic change in social values that has since occurred.\n\nGrowing Up And Going Home\n\nAlemayehu, Sisay and Eleni are three young Ethiopians who were adopted by an extended Australian family in the mid 1990s. Ten years on, the two brothers (aged 19 and 16) and their 14-year-old sister are returning to their homeland - with their adoptive parents and siblings - to reconnect with the family, friends and culture they left behind. Exploring contemporary issues surrounding inter-racial adoption and immigration, this is a poignant story of identity and belonging, as the teenagers discover whether it is possible to find a place in two different worlds.\n\nHalf Life\n\nWith terrifying calm this film examines the facts leading up to the 'Bravo' nuclear test in 1954, when in the name of 'national security' the United States government irreversibly destroyed the fragile world of the Marshall Islanders for countless generations to come. Piece by piece the role of the United States government is uncovered and we discover the deliberate decisions that were made to allow these gentle and trusting people to be expoesed to radioactivity and then used as 'guinea pigs' to test the short and long term effects of nuclear fallout. with cold fard facts HALF-LIFE contructs an account which is far more horrifying than any dramatisation and whose truth haunts our past, present and future.\n\nHamel: The Turning Point\n\nCelebrates one of Australia's most significant yet least known feats of arms in the Great War. On 4 July 1918 at Hamel, a fortified village in the north of France, a combined force of battle-hardened Australians and some untried American reinforcements, backed up by British tanks, artillery and aircraft, destroyed a major enemy position in a short, sharp battle that spelled the way to the sudden collapse of the German forces. At Hamel the Australians demonstrated a new style of warfare which, four months later, broke the will of the German armies. Hamel was, in effect, where the deadlock was broken and the Great War was won. This documentary describes the battle for Hamel and traces the events leading to it.\n\nHeroes Of Our Time\n\nThe first inside look at Greenpeace. Is the race to save the earth creating a new breed of hero? 'Commandos for conservation' and 'a well-drilled environmental army', are two of the catch phrases the media uses to describe the people and activities of Greenpeace. But what types of people are behind the well-publicised, dramatic stunts? What do captains of industry really think about them and the issues they are raising? HEROES OF OUR TIME infiltrates the inner sanctum of the organistion to explore these questions. It is a film about a Greenpeace direct action against the international oil company Caltex. This is the first time in Greepeace's 20 year history that a film crew has been allowed open access to the story that has traditionally been off-limits to the press. For an organistion that is so protective of its image, the people of Greenpeace Australia were surprisingly honest.\n\nHidden Treasures\n\nThe National Gallery of Australia has more than 100,000 works in its collection, from decorative arts to photography and sculpture, but only a fraction of these can be exhibited at one time. In this series of micro-docs, former director of the gallery Betty Churcher presents an insider's guide to some of the 'hidden treasures' that are rarely on public display. From her unique vantage point, she makes intriguing connections between a range of artworks and artists. These are fascinating tales about the works themselves, the people who created them and the challenge of preserving them, and a tantalising look at some of the ideas and influences that have shaped modern art across the globe.\n\nI Remember Mary MacKillop\n\nAn eyewitness account of Mary MacKillop, Australia's first saint. This gentle documentary focuses on Bill McLeod, who at the age of 103, told the story of his early years to journalist and presenter Caroline Jones. Bill was orphaned at the age of three and taken in by the Sisters of St Joseph, the order founded by Mary MacKillop. He was cared for at the St Joseph's Orphanage for Boys at Kincumber, on the New South Wales Central Coast, for 12 years. Bill has no memory of his own mother, but vividly recalls the visits to the orphanage by Mother Mary MacKillop and the effect this had on the boys who lived and worked there.\n\nThe Indian Cowboy - One in a Billion\n\nAn extremely talented country music artist from India - one in a billion people - fulfills a dream and travels to the Tamworth Country Music Festival in Australia. Calling himself Bobby Cash, he likes to be known as 'the Indian Cowboy'. A charismatic character - tall, good looking and dressed in black leather - Bobby stands out from the crowd. He is soon the talk of the festival, winning admirers with his musical ability and his honesty and integrity. His growing media profile also attracts the attention of a wealthy farmer who offers Bobby an unexpected proposition... Full of warmth and acceptance, this is a story of how faith and/or fate can make dreams come true.\n\nKakadu Man\n\nKakadu is the jewel of the country's national parks and the home of the Gagadju people. KAKADU MAN is the story of Bill Niedjie, the traditional custodian of this land - a role passed down to him through countless generations. In 1979 he gave the land to the people of Australia. Translated through the use of actors and puppet characters, and scenes of Kakadu, KAKADU MAN unfolds into a sensitive and often humorous portrait, weaving together the figurative and the abstract, the past and the present. The message of this important documentary is of vital concern to people everywhere.\n\nA Kid Called Troy\n\nA KID CALLED TROY is the sequel to the award-winning documentary SUZI'S STORY. It puts AIDS in a perspective seldom acknowledged by the general public. Seen through a child's eyes, the disease is placed firmly in a heterosexual family situation. The film presents a challenging insight into the changing face of AIDS in Australia. It looks at community attitudes which have seen Troy rejected and finally accepted into the mainstream education system, the first enrolment of an HIV-positive child in Australia. It shows the benefits of awareness and tolerance, not only to the quality of life of people living with HIV/AIDS, but to the community at large.\n\nLand of the Long Weekend\n\nAustralia - first in the world to institute a 40 hour working week, first to say there was such a thing as a fair and reasonable wage. Conditions like these helped win Australia its reputation as the mythical land of the long weekend. Yet today, for those with work, overtime has increased and penalty rates are disappearing. The nation's population is increasingly divided between the over-worked and the under-employed. Now that Australia is more the land of the level playing field than the land of the long weekend, have we abandoned the idea of the 'fair go'?\n\nThe Last Great Amateurs\n\nThis season, the women of Melbourne Phoenix Netball Club will again put their personal lives and other careers on hold and train to exhaustion at least six times a week for the love of their sport and a shot at glory. These players are the best in the world yet, in an era of multimillion-dollar sporting competitions, the clubs in the National Netball League operate on shoestring budgets and are run largely by volunteers. THE LAST GREAT AMATEURS follows players, coach and administrators through a year of pain and passion, rivalry and camaraderie, fundraising raffles and contract battles. To watch these talented, dedicated sportswomen on the court is remarkable but the story of how they make it there is equally enthralling.\n\nLies, Spies and Olympics\n\nThe Melbourne Olympic Games have become etched in Australian mythology as a watershed in the nation's sporting, cultural and civic history. But behind the myth is a far more revealing story - an epic saga of lies and petty bickering during the lead up to the Games that almost saw the IOC take the Games away from Melbourne. It's also a dramatic political story, during which the goodwill of Melbourne was undermined by Cold War skulduggery, defections and even murder - extraordinary events involving the highest level of Australian Olympic and political power.\n\nLife at 1\n\nHow do you give a child the best chance in life? Life at 1 is the first instalment in a landmark series that aims to unlock the secrets of child development by following 11 babies and their families for seven years. We witness the factors that impact their lives, watch the interplay of nature and nurture, and talk to experts to find out what limits children’s growth and wellbeing and what makes them thrive. Made in conjunction with the long-term study in which 10,000 Australian children have been placed under a sociological and scientific microscope, this groundbreaking program will try to discover what creates a happy, healthy child and what makes us who we are. Join us for the beginning of an extraordinary journey.\n\nLittle Brother, Little Sister\n\nLITTLE BROTHER, LITTLE SISTER is a film that records the unpredictable and heroic journey an Australian family undertake as they set out to transform themselves into something greater than they already are. It depicts the story of the Low family as they embrace the experience of instantly extending their family by adopting young Ethiopians; Sisay (seven) and Eleni (five). It also tells the story of how Eleni and Sisay, recently orphaned, cope with the profound changes in their lives and how they learn to become 'Lows' as they assimilate the values of the family and of Australian culture.\n\nLiving On The Comet\n\nLIVING ON THE COMET is an animated film that uses a recurring dream as a vehicle for examining and analysing the various ways in which we interpret and evaluate the patterns of our lives and the world. The four functions identified in this piece are ‘thinking’, ‘feeling’, ‘sensation’ and ‘intuition’. Each function allows us to experience a different reality and presents us with different interpretations of the same objects and events. This short animated film is based on the art of one of Australia’s leading new artists, Kathy Smith.\n\nLonely Boy Richard\n\nRichard Wanambi is about to go to prison for a long time. He knows what it’s like. He’s been there before... In Australia’s Northern Territory three-quarters of the people behind bars are Indigenous men. LONELY BOY RICHARD is an intimate account of one man’s journey to gaol. In Richard’s home of Yirrkala, like elsewhere, alcohol abuse and violence are threatening family and community life. Although his people are doing what they can, it’s not enough to save Richard from himself or his community from him.\n\nMabo: Life of an Island Man\n\nOn June 3rd 1992, six months after Eddie 'Koiki' Mabo's tragic death, the High Court upheld his claim that Murray Islanders held native title to land in the Torres Strait. The legal fiction that Australia was empty when first occupied by white people had been laid to rest. MABO - LIFE OF AN ISLAND MAN tells the private and public stories of a man so passionate about family and home that he fought an entire nation and its legal system. Though his greatest victory was won only after his death, it has forever ensured his place - on Murray Island and in Australian history. Also available on SP Betacam.\n\nMaternity Unit\n\nFor any woman, giving birth is a highly emotional experience - made even more challenging if you are new in a country and have little family support. At Sydney’s Canterbury Hospital, nearly 80 per cent of the mothers-to-be are born outside Australia. As well as catering for this cultural diversity, staff must - as always - judge when to let nature take its course and when to intervene medically. This very personal and revealing documentary goes behind the closed doors of the maternity unit to follow all the drama, intensity and unpredictability. It also provides an intimate insight into how different women and their families and cultures welcome new life into the world.\n\nA Million Acres a Year\n\nAfter World War II more land was released to agriculture in South Western Australia in just three decades than in the previous 130 years of white settlement. 'A million acres a year' was the catch-cry in what became one of the heaviest assaults on 'virgin' land in Australian history. A MILLION ACRES A YEAR tells the story of how a region now recognised as one of the top 25 biological hotspots on the planet was opened up for broadacre farming, unleashing an environmental and social nightmare. Farmers who were caught up in this rush to subdue the earth, question whether traditional farming belongs here at all. They describe their change of heart and outline an ethics for agriculture.\n\nMr Patterns\n\nIn the 1970s in Australia's Western Desert, a teacher named Geoff Bardon helped start one of the most significant art movements of the 20th century. Working with the Aboriginal community at Papunya, he encouraged the people to paint their traditional dot designs using Western materials. In defiance of white authorities, Bardon also encouraged the artists to value their work commercially as well as spiritually, believing that by selling paintings the people could become independent of welfare as well as bring Indigenous art to the attention of the wider community. This is his story.\n\nMr Strehlow's Films\n\nMR STREHLOW'S FILMS uses an episodic style to tell the story of TGH Strehlow, from his childhood in the care of Aboriginal (Arrernte) women at Hermannsburg Lutheran Mission near Alice Springs, to his days as Australia's pre-eminent and most controversial anthropologist and linguist. Strehlow produced a massive body of print, film, sound and still photographic work of Aboriginal (largely Arrernte) ceremonial performances - an archive unparalleled in this country and the world. The film tracks the challenges posed by the tasks Strehlow set for himself as anthropologist and filmmaker; the controversies surrounding the Strehlow Collection; and the contemporary work currently underway to return these materials to appropriate Arrernte communities in Central Australia.\n\nMuddy Waters - Life and Death on the Great Barrier Reef\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef is dying. Global warming and outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish have put extraordinary pressure on the coral. Now scientists have identified another threat - agricultural run-off. Sugarcane farmers are reeling at the prospect that their land management practices may be part of the problem. Some locals are trying to bring all the parties together to develop a workable solution, but leading the way can be hard work. MUDDY WATERS is the story of a small community facing the challenges of responsibility and change. It asks what’s killing the reef and can anything be done to save one of the world’s greatest natural treasures?\n\nMyths of Childhood\n\nToday we are more concerned about children and more confused about childhood than ever before. But many of our ideas about childhood are based on myths. In this provocative three-part series children and adults from the USA, Australia and the UK talk about their own experiences. Home movies, photographs and scenes from TV and cinema show the childhood we imagine. Best selling authors like Penelope Leach, Thomas Moore, Martin Seligman and Marina Warner discuss changing ideas about childhood and the raising of children. MYTHS OF CHILDHOOD confronts the idea that children are innocent, asks why we blame childhood for adult unhappiness and questions the ambitions of parents who strive to be perfect.\n\nNerves of Steel\n\nSkeleton is a head-first, full-throttle slide down a winding, icy track. It’s one of the most dangerous and demanding sports there is. And, for four fearless young women from Australia’s beaches, it’s their unexpected chance at Olympic glory. Even though they’ll work together to qualify for the Games, in the end, only one will be selected to compete. Handpicked for the challenge, science is now pushing them to new extremes. This exhilarating documentary follows the fate of the team - the athletes, manager and coach - as they hurtle towards the 2006 Torino Winter Games, tracking both the scientific juggernaut and the all-too-human drama.\n\nNo Milk, No Honey\n\nAt the end of the First World War, many British ex-servicemen joined the queues of the unemployed. When films and glossy brochures appeared promising 'a new life, a new start on your own dairy farm in the paradise of Western Australia', unsuspecting British families travelled to the other side of the world under a hastily conceived immigration program known as the Group Settlement Scheme. But instead of the promised 'paradise', Group Settlers were greeted by an unforgiving, alien landscape and a harsh, regimented lifestyle. Those who stayed were determined to survive, despite the hardships. They gradually cleared the bush and turned it into pasture, developing the south-west into the 'land of milk and honey' it is today.\n\nOnce Were Monks\n\nMelbourne is home to a fascinating, eccentric, erudite and warring tribe of men. They are pious and bawdy, gregarious and solitary, indulgent and ascetic, conservative and anarchic, young and old. They are the men of St Francis Monastery in the heart of Melbourne. The Monks' lives are turned upside down when they are forced to move to a garish pub across the road during renovations. ONCE WERE MONKS is the story of what happens when this tight-knit community is thrown into the outside world.\n\nOperation Babylift\n\nIn April 1975, in the closing days of the Vietnam War, more than 3000 babies were airlifted from Saigon orphanages. Some people saw Operation Babylift as a humanitarian act, others as kidnapping. Thirty years on, this emotionally powerful documentary tells the stories of three of the 281 children brought to Australia. Through candid interviews with them, their adoptive parents, those involved in the airlift and Vietnamese families and politicians, this film explores complex issues of inter-racial adoption and cultural identity, and provides an insight into the political background behind this controversial operation.\n\nOut of Time, Out Of Place\n\nIn the 1970s, two exciting discoveries of human fossil remains, focused world attention on Australia. Evidence implied that two very different types of people lived in Australia long before the emergence of the modern Aborigines. The key scientisit in both finds, Dr. Alan Thorne presents OUT OF TIME, OUT OF PLACE, revealing for the first time origins of the first Australian. Doctor Thorne takes us on an exciting search that includes Java, China, the UK, Kow Swamp and Lake Mungo where the earliest Australians were found. This documentary takes us back 30,000 years and beyond, giving answers to many of the dreamtime stories of the origins of Australians.\n\nThe Pilot's Funeral\n\nWhen Adrian Wagg arrived in Arnhem Land in the 1970s, he fell in love with the place and its people, helping the Yolngu to build homes on their ancestral lands and establish their own airline. This moving documentary recounts the life of this gentle giant of a man. But more than this, it tells of the extraordinary 10-day funeral that followed his tragic death in a helicopter accident. Not performed since the arrival of missionaries in the 1930s, the traditional Yolngu ceremony celebrates a remarkable bond, connecting black and white, people and land, past and future.\n\nPlumpton High Babies\n\nPlumpton High, in Sydney’s outer western suburbs, is one of the few schools in Australia with a program that supports schoolgirl mothers completing their education. This four-part series follows a year in the lives of some of these young women as they hurtle from girlhood to motherhood. None of it is easy - the decision to give birth, the conflicts with family and boyfriends, the new responsibilities. The school offers them health and welfare support and constant encouragement, but the outcome depends on the girls.\n\nPolicing the Pacific\n\nAustralian Federal Police find adventure and challenges in the region as they join the multinational police force known as the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) and embark on a tour of duty to East Timor. This series follows several Australian Federal Agents deployed to the Solomon Islands, where they patrol the streets of the capital Honiara, the remote and dangerous Weather Coast and outer islands that rarely, if ever, see law enforcement. In the final episode we are reacquainted with Australian Federal Agent Dave Elson who makes a tour of duty to Dili in East Timor after the recent unrest.\n\nPrisoners Of Propaganda\n\nIn 1943, the Imperial Japanese Army Secret Service and Australian servicemen made a film to show the 'exemplary conditions' under which the Prisoners of War were treated by Nippon, and to soften up the Australian public for the anticipated occupation of their country by Japanese forces. PRISONERS OF PROPAGANDA tells why the film was made, and how it came to be forgotten. The story is history, but the lessons for a public exposed to 'journalism with a message' are most relevant today. It also explores the impact that Japan had on wartime Indonesia, where 'Calling Australia' was made.\n\nThe Real Flying Doctors\n\nThe Flying Doctors are the air ambulance of outback Australia. It's noble but hard work and the stories of the men and women who tend their patients, fly the planes and operate the radios is a long way from their portrayal in the successful Australian television series THE FLYING DOCTORS. The lives of the flight crew are extraordinary ... two weeks on and two weeks off ... six calls out per day per aircraft. But they still maintain their 'right stuff' attitude to their task, as though it poses no problem. They confide in us about their unusual lifestyle, which plays havoc with their personal lives and relationships ... for the nurses it is a single women's occupation. We follow the crew of our winged ambulance at work as they tend to cases in outback Queensland.\n\nRemembering Rain\n\nIn the face of the worst drought on record, rural Australians have gambled their dreams on the chance of rain - and cracks are starting to show in more than just the parched earth. In Remembering Rain we meet the people of one farming community as they attempt to weather the crisis. Beautifully photographed, in turns funny and moving, this is an iconic portrait of a land and a character shaped by drought - one that raises the question of the very viability of farming in the driest inhabited continent on earth.\n\nRoad to Tokyo\n\nBy late 1944, the worst of World War Two appears to be over. But the conflict in the Pacific is about to hot up and it will be a long road to Tokyo for the Allies... Combining interviews and vivid archival footage, this is an eyewitness account of an often forgotten episode in history, providing a social context as well as a military overview of the titanic struggle to defeat Japan. For Australia, it is signposted with some of the bloodiest campaigns and most appalling events of the war - and the memory of 8031 POWs who would never come home.\n\nThe Safe House\n\nIt’s the summer of 1954 and seven-year-old Lee Whitmore and her friends are drifting through the holidays, exploring their quiet suburban neighbourhood where nothing ever seems to happen... until the day mysterious strangers move in with the old lady next door. No one explains the odd comings and goings, the big black cars, the men in suits and hats, the overheard snippets of conversation, but that doesn’t stop the children from imagining. THE SAFE HOUSE is a half-hour animation based on a true story - a young girl’s innocent perspective of one of the most talked about moments in Australia’s history - the real-life spy drama known as the Petrov Affair.\n\nThe Shark Callers Of Kontu\n\nFor centuries the men of Kontu, a small coastal village in New Ireland, have gone to sea in frail outrigger canoes: to call, trap and kill sharks by hand. Now after a hundred years of coloniziation, economic exploration and intense missionary activity, a few men still understand the magic rituals of shark calling. However it remains as their most tangible link with the tradtions of the past during a time of rapid social change.\n\nSheep's Back\n\nFor a golden century, the wool industry gave Australia one of the highest living standards in the world. The economy rode high on wealth from primary exports. By the 1950s, wool was synonymous with the Australian way of life. Yet barely a decade later, Australia had jumped from the sheep's back on to the iron ore train. As the fortunes of the rural sector wane, city identification with rural Australia is fading too. What does the future hold for farmers and their families? And what will become of the rural symbols and legends upon which the Australian identity once depended?\n\nShellshocked\n\nFour veterans fought in Vietnam at different times, yet each one's life has been equally shattered by the experience. One returned to Vietnam as a tourist and found it such a healing experience he invited the others to join him on one more return journey. As they travel back together, the film flashes back to their individual war stories, illustrated by unique home movie footage of the war. We experience their fear, grief and joy as these men confront, once again, the place that's had such a disturbing impact on their lives. The climax is a meeting with veterans from the other side: ex-Viet Cong guerillas who are suffering, just like the Australian vets, from post traumatic stress. This film reveals some startling insights into the nature of war, and helps us come to terms with a tumultuous period in our history.\n\nSilent Storm\n\nFrom 1957 to 1978, scientists secretly removed bone samples from over 21,000 dead Australians as they searched for Strontium 90, a byproduct of nuclear testing. SILENT STORM reveals the story behind this astonishing case of 'body-snatching'. Against a backdrop of the Cold War, it follows scientist Hedley Marston as he challenges official claims that British atomic tests posed no threat to Australian people. Marston's findings are not only disputed, he is targeted as 'a scientist of counter-espionage interest'. Now, questions are being raised about health repercussions for generations of Australians\n\nSnowy, A Dream Of Growing Up\n\nThe Snowy Mountains Scheme remains one of the greatest engineering feats in the world today - but behind the story of engineering and construction is the story of the people who built the dream, the story of the people behind the power. An estimated 100,000 people worked on the scheme between 1949 and 1974, the year of its completion. Two thirds of them were immigrants from over 40 countries around the world. This is a story of social, cultural and political change told through the experiences of those who worked on the scheme over the past 40 years.\n\nSpinning Out\n\nOne in 100 people will develop schizophrenia at some time in their lives, 40 million worldwide. Schizophrenia fills more hospital beds than any other illness. Madness has been with us for centuries, but schizophrenia is still a mystery. It has no known cause or cure. SPINNING OUT goes inside the locked wards, joins the crisis teams, the self-help groups and the families to see how they deal with the knife edge existence of their lives.\n\nStarting From Zero\n\nSTARTING FROM ZERO is the story about three people exiled from East Timor in their youth. Twenty-four years later they've returned to their shattered homeland to contribute to its reconstruction. Meet Ines Almeida, Lola dos Reis and Jacinto Tinocu - three Australian-East Timorese - who are now embarking on arguably the most challenging experience of their lives. STARTING FROM ZERO provides an intimate insight into these individuals as they juggle their aspirations and expectations within two very different cultural experiences.\n\nStaying Out\n\nSTAYING OUT follows the troubled journeys of Christie and Terry, two people leaving prison to make a new start on the outside. Terry is a thoughtful and articulate man in his mid-forties. He is released after serving eight years for armed robbery and his journey is one of self-discovery, disappointment and revelation as he battles his old demons and a nagging sense of loneliness. Twenty-five year-old Christie is determined - this time - to succeed on the outside. A reformed heroin addict, she relies heavily on the emotional support of her partner Paul. Together they hope to win back her nine-year-old son Damien, who has always lived with Paul's' parents.\n\nStranger in My Skin: Ray Cotti\n\nRay Cotti was born to Aboriginal parents but adopted at a young age by a Swiss German family in Sydney. Growing up in a European culture, he thought of himself as white. Then at the age of eight, Ray was removed from his adoptive family and after living in a series of institutions, placed in foster care. By the time he was in his teens, confusion about his identity was taking a devastating toll. This is a portrait of a young man on a journey of self-discovery, searching for his origins. Now an active member of an Indigenous community with a family of his own, he has found a sense of belonging. His journey is far from over but Ray Cotti is finally at home in his own skin.\n\nStreets Are For Sharing\n\nThere is a contest on our roads for space - pedestrians versus cars, trucks versus bicycles, but is need not be that way - space can be shared. With good planning and for thought we can make the best use of our traffic feeways and byways. This program shows examples of housing built around a shared recreation park with a group car space adjacent to the housing - this allows children to play freely without fear of driveways and through traffic. Other examples of bikeways, under and over passes, speed limits and separate access roads through suburbab areas can all assist better utilisation of the shared space.\n\nSugar Slaves\n\nFew people know that the Australian sugar industry was founded on the sweat of men and women enticed or kidnapped from the islands of the South Pacific. Sugar Slaves is the story of that human traffic, euphemistically known as 'blackbirding'. Between 1863 and 1904 about 60.000 islanders were transported to Queensland, where they toiled to create the sugar plantations of the far north. Then, after the introduction of a White Australia policy, most were deported. A few thousand were permitted to remain and today north Queensland is home to 20.000 of their descendants. In 1994 Australian Islanders at last won official recognition as a distinct ethnic group. A unique community, it is the only substantial black migrant group in Australia. This documentray at last uncovers the little known story of Australia's sugar slaves.\n\nSurround Sound\n\nRuth and Harold have had enough of leaf-blowers and other polluting garden tools, so they take matters into their own hands. Working at home in a 'quiet' suburb, aspiring scriptwriter Harold can't get anywhere because he's driven to distraction by the cacophony of sound made by leaf-blowers and whipper-snippers. He dreams about violently eliminating their owners but instead his mother diverts his anger into a peaceful protest. She buys a stack of brooms and hands them out to real-life leaf-blower owners. What are their reactions?\n\nSurviving Shepherd's Pie\n\nThe Australian rural woman is tough but feminine, strongly connected to the land with an independence and strength born of isolation and a wisdom and resilience born of adversity. She knows which way the wind is blowing and how to fix a broken water pump. The Australian outback is a harsh and unforgiving landscape, prone to fire, flood and drought and SURVIVING SHEPHERD'S PIE bears testimony to four women who have survived and been shaped by this environment.\n\nTed's Evolution\n\nCharles Darwin started a revolution when he published his evolutionary theory in the late 1800s. He challenged the belief that God created the world in seven days, and the theories of people such as Jean Baptiste de Lamarck, who believed that characteristics acquired during a lifetime could be passed on to the next generation. Since then, Darwinian theory has become the accepted scientific doctrine but now an Australian scientist, Ted Steele, is stirring things up again. Is he pursuing a false dream or is he about to change what we know about life on earth? Reputations, careers and our understanding of evolution are all on the line.\n\nTen Million Wild Cats\n\nTEN MILLION WILD CATS is the story of a predator that has conquered all environments, including the human heart. This film explores the relationship between the cat and the Australian landscape. In learning about the cat's skills, abilities and lifestyle we can learn how they have adapted so successfully to this environment that they have become a threat to native species. We follow the stories of those people fighting to save endangered native animals. We talk to Australia's Aboriginal people about the survival and introduction of these animals to their culture. The film explores the origins of the cat in Australia and looks at the association of Aborigines with cats as part of their world.\n\nTo Absent Friends\n\nThis innovative documentary looks at the creation of the largest scale holographic project ever undertaken. Paula Dawson, the creator, is one of the world's leading holographic artists and an important pioneer in this field. Inspired partly by Vladimir Nabokov's book 'Transparent Things', this work ' To Absent Friends' uses the central theme of memory through objects and allows the viewer to stand outside time and reflect on the past, or mirror it. Paula's installation was selected as one of 40 works shown at Artec'89, a high tech international art exhibition and competition, the first international Biennale in Nagoya, Japan. The three main holograms were exhibited and went on to become joint winners of the Grand Prix '89. This film presents the only opportunity to view the entire installation and to meet the artist who created it.\n\nTop Cover\n\nSet against the backdrop of sophisticated maritime and aviation technology TOP COVER follows the training of the six air crew and nine maintenance personnel who are posted aboard HMAS Sydney, a Royal Australian Navy Guided Missile Frigate. This fast action documentary follows the crew of 816 gaining their deck qualifications, the 'licence' that allows them to take off and land a Seahawk from the deck of HMAS Sydney, even in the roughest seas. It shows what really happens when the Royal Australian Navy brings in the resources of its front line Squadron of the Fleet Air Arm to police the seas of the Middle East.\n\nTrafficked\n\nThis powerful documentary follows former police officer Chris Payne, as he investigates the shocking crime of trafficking for prostitution. For a decade, he’s been haunted by the case of “Nikkie”, a young Thai girl who was deported after she was discovered working in a Sydney brothel. How did she get there? What happened to her afterwards? Payne follows the trail of evidence from Australia to Thailand. Along the way, he meets the parents of another Thai “sex slave” whose death in an immigration detention centre in Sydney made headlines. Through these stories, TRAFFICKED provides a disturbing insight into the international sex trade.\n\nThe Trouble with Merle\n\nMerle Oberon was one of the biggest movie stars of the 1930s and 1940s. Studio publicists said she was born into a wealthy family in Hobart, Tasmania - Australia's island state. Yet rumour was that the exotic almond-eyed actress concealed her true past. It was said she was actually \"oriental\", perhaps Anglo-Indian, and born in Calcutta. In Tasmania, many remain convinced she was their island's most famous daughter, born not to wealthy parents but to a Chinese hotel worker and her married employer. THE TROUBLE WITH MERLE looks at celebrity, memory, identity, race and class... and at why Merle Oberon's origins mattered to people on a tiny island, in a country at the bottom of the world.\n\nTroubled Minds - The Lithium Revolution\n\nIn a disused hospital pantry in the 1940s, an Australian doctor, John Cade, discovered an astonishing treatment for bi-polar disorder. It would revolutionise the way we think about mental illness and mark the beginning of psychopharmacology - using drugs to manage psychiatric conditions. This was inspired thinking at a time when Freudian psychoanalysis, electric shock and lobotomy were the dominant approaches and patients were often locked up in asylums. The breakthrough followed years of research and experimentation and it would take two more decades of struggle before lithium treatment was finally accepted - but Cade's successors persevered. Their work has meant a chance at stability for hundreds of thousands of people, and lithium remains the benchmark for bi-polar treatment today.\n\nTroubled Waters\n\nIn 1979 Australia expanded its territorial borders by 200 nautical miles to take advantage of the rich oil and gas deposits in the Timor Sea. For Centuries before, fishermen from the island of Roti in Indonesia were fishing for their livelihood in these same waters. Today they are regularly arrested for trespassing a border they cannot see, and are sent to gaol for increasingly longer periods with no recourse to legal representation. They return home to debts many cannot foresee escaping in their own lifetime. TROUBLED WATERS investigates the human and financial costs of Australia's current border protection policies.\n\nUluru - An Anangu Story\n\nThis is an unique film about Uluru, written and produced by the Mutijulu Community. You will witness the history of Uluru from an Aboriginal perspective, taking you from the dawn of creation to the celebrations of Uluru when it was handed back to the traditional owners. This film's brilliant and unforgettable images present these events with humour, sensitivity and an accuracy that until now no one has bothered to obtain. This is truly an Anangu story. Featuring Midnight Oils' 'The Dead Heart'.\n\nUncle Chatzkel\n\nUncle Chatzkel witnessed the Bolshevik Revolution, the two World Wars, the Holocaust and the transition from Communist to independent Lithuania. During his early years, he gained employment as a translator and then as a lexicographer, working hard to preserve the Lithuanian language. He lost much of his family to the Nazis and most of his fellow Jewish citizens were killed by local Lithuanians. Now regarded as a national treasure, Uncle Chatzkel's success belies his sometimes lonely existence - that is until his Australian relatives arrive.\n\nUnder One Roof\n\nThis series opens the door on contemporary family life. Inside Australian homes, it finds the ties that bind families together and the pressures that pull them apart. Each episode follows a different family negotiating the ups and downs of everyday life. What support does the family offer its members and what must they sacrifice in the interests of the family? How do they manage the complexities of modern family living? How do they all survive life together under one roof?\n\nUnder The Hammer\n\nFor agents the real estate auction brings the thrill of success or the agony of defeat. For home buyers and sellers it can be a terrifying journey into uncharted waters as their dreams, their memories, and the biggest investment in their lives goes on the auction block. UNDER THE HAMMER is there with them as this real-life drama unfolds. Intimate and emotional, the series captures the bravado, happiness, shock and disappointment as the hammer goes down.\n\nUnfolding Florence - The Many Lives of Florence Broadhurst\n\nIn this spirited and highly original documentary, acclaimed director Gillian Armstrong reveals the many lives of one larger-than-life woman - flamboyant design pioneer, Florence Broadhurst. Born in outback Australia in 1899, she was a singer and dancer in Shanghai in the 20s and ran her own fashion boutique in London in the 30s before sweeping into Sydney society as a painter and charity queen. But it was in her last incarnation that she really made her mark, shaking up conservative Australia with her bold, exotic wallpaper designs. Now, with her prints in huge demand internationally, the times have finally caught up with this glamorous, complicated, unconventional woman, whose brutal murder in 1977 has never been solved.\n\nWages Of Power\n\nWAGES OF POWER outlines the costs of family violence to all members of the families in which it occurs. In a graphic portrayal, both women and men describe their personal experiences as survivors and perpetrators of family violence, and the impact it has had on their lives. Alongside this personal perspective, a wide range of professional workers comment on the dynamics of abuse and the social environment which fosters it. Practitioners from the areas of law, police, psychology, social work, medicine, theology and community services decribe some of the difficulties of and solutions to the problem of family violence on our society.\n\nWe are the Landowners\n\nAfter a general introduction to Yirrkala and the nearby bauxite mine the film goes to Baniyala, the homeland settlement of the Madarrpa clan, on the northern shores of Blue Mud Bay. WE ARE THE LANDOWNER reveals a very positive picture, a picture of Aborignal people running their own affairs and exploiting Western technology in the process. The film gives an excellent insight into the decision making process at work for Aborignal people and shows some pertinent and new aspects of the Land Rights issue.\n\nWelcome to Woomera\n\nThis is a film about ordinary people in a small town caught up in big events. As Australia’s only purpose-built defence village, Woomera has been famous for its rocket range, as home to Americans from the Nurrungar base and, most recently, for its controversial immigration reception and processing centre. But the centre has closed and the town is in danger of closing too. Once heralded as a model of suburban living then reviled as a “desert jail”, this film looks at Woomera from the inside and follows the town’s struggle to stay alive. As a government town however, its future is not necessarily in the community’s own hands. Now marketing of the range has been contracted out to a multinational company, with potential to capitalise on escalating global interest in weapons development.\n\nWho Killed Dr Bogle and Mrs Chandler?\n\nAt last, an answer to one of crime history's great unsolved cases. When the bodies of brilliant physicist Dr Gilbert Bogle and his lover Mrs Margaret Chandler were found in bizarre circumstances on a Sydney riverbank in 1963, it captured the public imagination and launched an unprecedented murder investigation. However, the Coroner could find no cause of death, killer or motive. Some suggested it was a Cold War assassination, others claimed it was an overdose of LSD. Now, four decades later, a new investigation uncovers explosive new evidence.\n\nWildness\n\nOlegas Truchanas and Peter Dombrovskis were perhaps Australia's greatest wilderness photographers. Their work became synonymous with campaigns to protect Tasmania's natural heritage. They shared many things, including a bond that was more like that of father and son. Both came from Baltic Europe and migrated to Tasmania, where their passion for nature became a crusade to save an environment under threat. Both died in the wilderness, doing what they loved, and left a legacy in extraordinary images. Their philosophy was simple and remarkably effective - if people could see the beauty of Australia's wild places then they might be moved to save them.\n\nWinds of Change\n\nAs Asia's unfolding dramas reverberated around the globe, filmmakers from Indonesia, Vietnam and Hong Kong documented the winds of historic change sweeping through their world. Working unobtrusively within their own communities, they tell the world for the first time, their own stories with the kind of intimacy and depth that comes from being on the inside. Stories about ordinary people during extraordinary times. Their dreams and their nightmares. Their hopes and their fears.\n\nWith Every Drop\n\nIn Sydney's drought thirsty suburbs, one water-conscious grandmother draws on her Lebanese upbringing to teach her family the value of every single drop. Eighty-seven year old Salma knows a thing or two about water conservation from her childhood in the Lebanese village of Jezzine, where she learnt 'the most important part of washing is the wringing', Selma has squeezed the most out of every single drop. She instilled in her own children such a value for recycling that one of her sons, a mechanical engineer, has invented a new way to control fluid that not only saves 80 per cent of water but could also revolutionise the way we turn on a tap.\n\nThe Yirrkala Film Project\n\nYirrkala was an isolated mission station until the coming of a huge bauxite mine in the late 1960s. The impact of the mine on the Yolngu, the Aboriginal people of northeast Arnhem Land, and their response is a major theme of this long-term film project. Twenty two films document many aspects of Yolngu life. Each stands on its own but each is also part of a rich mosaic. The relationship between people and their clans, ritual, art and land is an intertwining theme. Several major ceremonies are documented. The importance of the land is ever present. Despite enormous disruption to their lives, the resilience of the Yolngu and their culture shines through.\n\nyouCan2\n\nTwo young siblings plot to change the energy habits of their parents. In a humorous and slightly anarchistic way Madison and Mitchell demonstrate in five promotional campaigns that small changes can make a big difference to the environment. All over Australia, suburb by suburb, family by family, Australians are making positive changes to shape a better future. As Madison and Mitchell say, 'if we can do it, you can too'."
