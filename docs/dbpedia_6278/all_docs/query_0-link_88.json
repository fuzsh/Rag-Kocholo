        "text": "The movie\"Backdraft\" from 1991 put the dangers of firefighting on the map for members of the public around the world when it first came out. In the 2019 sequel, fire investigator Sean McCaffrey (Anderson), son of the late Steven \"Bull\" McCaffrey, is now working at the same Chicago fire house along with his uncle Brian (Baldwin).\n\nWhen Sean is assigned to investigate a deadly fire, he and his partner Maggie soon realize that they are dealing with something much more than a routine fire. The clues they discover lead them down a treacherous path of arson, murder, and international terrorism. Sean must use his intuition, along with the help of infamous jailed arsonist Ronald Bartel (Sutherland), in a race to find out who is behind the fire and stop them from accomplishing their devious plans.\n\nThe new installment of the Backdraft legacy marks the return of the franchise's original filmmakers including producer Raffaella DeLaurentiis (Dragonheart franchise, What Happened to Monday, The Forbidden Kingdom), alongside writer and former firefighter Gregory Widen (Backdraft, OtherLife). Backdraft 2 comes from director Gonzalo Lopez-Gallego (Apollo 18, The Hollow Point).\n\n“Backdraft 2”, which Moviehole first wrote about about in March 2018 , has been released by Universal Studios. Filming work for the movie was done in Romania, with locations also in Toronto and Chicago. The film was first expected to be released in 2020, but ended up being actually released earlier this year, in March 2019.\n\nThe movie \"Backdraft\" from 1991 put the dangers of firefighting on the map for members of the public around the world when it first came out. Firefighters, and others with knowledge of Fire Behavior, were however sadly disappointed in the way the fire effects were rendered, and there was very little in the movie that even remotely reminded firefighters of their working environment, or of any actual backdrafts.\n\nA quick glance at the official trailer for Backdraft 2 shows some promise when it comes to the fire effects, but scenes are short and it is impossible to know if Fire Behavior related scenes will be rendered correctly.\n\nThe original Backdraft did indeed leave a few things to be desired when it came to the rendition of Fire Behavior. However, like already stated, the trailer leaves a desire for more (perhaps not so much in the acting department, but still:-)\n\nThe director for the sequel is Spanish director Gonzalo López-Gallego, best known for 2011 sci-fi thriller “Apollo 18”.\n\nThe studio has engaged the filmmaker for its “Backdraft” sequel, tentatively titled “Backdraft II”, with filming beginning in Romania, Chicago and Toronto.\n\nWilliam Baldwin is expected to reprise his role from the original 1991 blockbuster.\n\nThe film’s central character will be Sean McCaffrey, the grown son of Kurt Russell’s character from the first film an investigator with the Chicago F.D who still holds his uncle (Baldwin) responsible for the death of his father.\n\nThe villains in this film are a group of agents sneaking a missile out of the country, using a series of deadly fires as a distraction.\n\nJoe Anderson - who played Mason Verger on “Hannibal” - is playing Brian’s nephew Sean McCaffrey. William Baldwin reprises his role from the original.\n\nAlisha Bailey, Ross O’Hennessy, Sal Longbardo and Sia Alipour also among cast. Aside from Baldwin, Donald Sutherland is making an appearance as Ronald, the arsonist from the 1991 original.\n\nRaffaella De Laurentiis will be the producer.\n\nExciting news for fans of the original film, particularly with the character of Brian McCaffrey back, and a capable director in the helmer’s spot. Looking forward.\n\n“Backdraft”, directed by Ron Howard and screen written by Gregory Widen, starred Kurt Russell, William Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Rebecca De Mornay, Donald Sutherland, Robert De Niro, Jason Gedrick and J. T. Walsh.\n\nThe film, made for 75 mill, wasn´t much appreciated by most critics but most audiences loved it for its special effects and action sequences , with many of the actors performing their own stunts.\n\nThe film received three Academy Award nominations for Sound Effects Editing, Visual Effects and Best Sound.\n\nPhoto: (Above) Screenshot from the original 1991 \"Backdraft\".\n\nVideo: (Below) A teaser for the movie Backdraft 2 shows some promise of featuring more realistic fire effects than the original.\n\nThe 1991 blockbusters movie Backdraft, whose biggest claim to fame was getting a sweaty, soot-covered Kurt Russell to put on firefighter turnout gear , is getting a sequel, almost three decades later, reports Slashfilm.com.\n\nA quick glance at the official trailer for Backdraft 2 shows some promise when it comes to the fire effects, but scenes are short and it is impossible to know if Fire Behavior related scenes will be rendered correctly.\n\nPublished by Bjorn Ulfsson / CTIF NEWS\n\nSpanish director Gonzalo López-Gallego, best known for 2011 sci-fi thriller “Apollo 18”, has been charged with the mission of reigniting one of the biggest titles in the Universal library.\n\nThe studio has tapped the filmmaker for its “Backdraft” sequel, tentatively titled “Backdraft II”, with filming set to begin in Romania and Toronto next month. William Baldwin is expected to reprise his role from the original 1991 blockbuster.\n\nBackdraft 2 is now officially in the works at Universal with a director attached and co-star William Baldwin set to return.\n\nUniversal has engaged Spanish director Gonzalo López-Gallego, best known for the 2011 science-fiction thriller Apollo 18, to helm Backdraft 2, according to MovieHole.\n\nThe central character will be Sean McCaffrey, the grown son of Kurt Russell’s character from the first film responsible for the death of his dad.\n\nThe film is tentatively titled Backdraft II and will reportedly follow the grown son of Kurt Russell’s character, an investigator with the Chicago F.D. who still holds his uncle (Baldwin) responsible for the death of his father. The villains this time around are a group of agents who are attempting to sneak a missile out of the country, using a series of deadly fires as a distraction.\n\nProduction is set to begin in Romania and Toronto next month.\n\nIt sounds like the plot of the sequel — which will take place a daunting 27 years after the original — is formed in the vein of the “legasequel,” a relatively modern creation. Creed, Star Wars, even Pacific Rim follow a next-generation character who has to live up the legacy of the heroes before them — those heroes often being their own father.\n\nThe original 1991 film boasted a star-studded ensemble, including Donald Sutherland, Robert De Niro, and Jennifer Jason Leigh, and was an early hit for director Ron Howard. However, the only familiar face confirmed to return for the sequel is Baldwin.\n\nBackdraft is a 1991 American drama thriller film directed by Ron Howard and written by Gregory Widen. The film stars Kurt Russell, William Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Rebecca De Mornay, Donald Sutherland, Robert De Niro, Jason Gedrick and J. T. Walsh. It is about Chicago firefighters on the trail of a serial arsonist.\n\nThe film grossed $77.9 million domestically and $74.5 million in foreign markets, for a total gross of $152.4 million, making it the highest-grossing film about firefighters until I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry in 2007.[2][3] The film received three Academy Award nominations.\n\nThe first Backdraft followed a team of firefighters in Chicago on the tail of a serial arsonist. Here’s the synopsis to refresh your memory:\n\nChicago firefighting brothers Stephen (Kurt Russell) and Brian (William Baldwin) have been rivals since childhood. Brian, struggling to prove himself, transfers to the arson unit. There he aids Don (Robert De Niro) in his investigation into a spate of fires involving oxygen-induced infernos called backdrafts. But when a conspiracy implicating a crooked politician and an arsonist leads Brian back to Stephen, he is forced to overcome his brotherly competitiveness in order to crack the case.\n\nThe movie received mixed critical reviews, but had a fairly successful box office run, apparently becoming the highest-grossing movie about firefighters until I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry took that crown in 2007 (seriously). It also received lavish praise for its state-of-the-art fire effects.\n\nBackdraft II is set to be released in 2020."
