        "text": "There are many worthy films about mental health conditions that inspire, inform, and entertain. Here are those you won’t want to miss!\n\nBipolar Films for Inspiration\n\nWhen the symptoms of bipolar have you feeling low or trapped in your own little world, taking the time to sit down, relax, and watch a movie or documentary can provide a brief reprieve as well as a broadened perspective. And when the film connects with your own lived experience with bipolar disorder, it can even offer a sense of community and encourage you to keep moving forward despite current challenges and setbacks. Consider taking some time to watch the movies below if you need to take a break, catch your breath, and feel inspired to take positive action when facing difficult situations in your own life.\n\n(Sensitivity Note: Some films may address potentially triggering content or use cinematic techniques that can heighten emotions or stress. Be sure to check reviews for content warnings and to be mindful of any negative reactions you experience.)\n\n1. Bipolar Rock ’n’ Roller\n\nThe 2018 Showtime documentary Bipolar Rock ’n’ Roller, featuring the life story of popular combat sports announcer Mauro Ranallo, follows the commentator’s exciting career path and how bipolar disorder has influenced both his job and his life. Ranallo shares his experiences from the devastating lows of bipolar depression to the unwieldy highs of mania, aiming to combat stigma, shine a light on bipolar symptoms, and encourage perseverance through it all. [click here to watch the trailer]\n\n2. The Ghost and the Whale\n\nMaurice Benard (Sonny of General Hospital) stars as Joseph Hawthorne, a man whose wife was lost overboard when they were sailing. The mystery of what really happened divides his town, makes enemies of his wife’s family, and draws the attention of a journalist. Joseph’s untreated bipolar leads to mania, melancholia, and discussions on the beach with a gray whale (voiced by Jonathan Pryce). Benard and his wife, Paula, produced the 2016 thriller.

Directed by Paul Dalio and produced by Spike Lee, Touched with Fire (2015) captures the intensity of their romance and the ebb and flow of beautiful highs and tormented lows. [click here to watch the trailer]\n\n4. Infinitely Polar Bear\n\nMark Ruffalo and Zoe Saldana play a mixed-race couple raising two daughters in 1970s Boston. The father doesn’t work because of his bipolar disorder, so the mother decides to accept a scholarship to graduate school in New York City so she can make more money for the family. The kids are left with their dad, who gives them lots of love but doesn’t always make the best parenting decisions. Writer and director Maya Forbes based the 2014 story on her own childhood. [click here to watch the trailer]\n\n5. The Dark Horse\n\nThe award-winning film tells the true story of Genesis Potini (Cliff Curtis), a New Zealand chess champ with bipolar disorder who volunteers to coach a group of disadvantaged youth. The Dark Horse (2014) is hailed as “one of the greatest New Zealand films ever made.” [click here to watch the trailer]\n\n6. Repentance\n\nForest Whitaker plays to stereotype in this 2013 psychological thriller. His character, a family man who also has bipolar disorder, is thrown off balance after his mother’s sudden death and he fixates on a self-help guru (played by Anthony Mackie) who has secrets in his past. Whitaker, who produced the violent drama, has said he was trying to explore loss, pain, healing, and the core of humanity in tortured souls. [click here to watch the trailer]\n\n7. Silver Linings Playbook\n\nThis 2012 romantic drama-comedy puts a sympathetic character with bipolar front and center — and surrounds him with other characters grappling with their own disorders. Bradley Cooper plays Pat Solitano, who is trying to get his life back together after a court-ordered psychiatric hospitalization. The main plotline concerns Pat’s efforts to win back his ex-wife by agreeing to enter a dance competition (it’s complicated). His dance partner, played by Jennifer Lawrence, is a widow whose grief has led to her own mental health problems. And his father, played by Robert De Niro, has obsessive-compulsive tendencies and a gambling problem that drives a lot of the action. Director David O. Russell says he was attracted to the project because his son has bipolar. [click here to watch the trailer]\n\n8. The Informant!\n\nThe Informant! (2009) is based on the saga of real-life corporate whistleblower Mark Whitacre, played by Matt Damon. Whitacre was involved in a price-fixing scheme at the agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland. He agreed to tape his colleagues for the FBI — part of his own grandiose scheme to win promotion. The stress of his undercover ordeal worsened Whitacre’s bipolar disorder, which was later diagnosed and treated. [click here to watch the trailer]\n\n9. Phoebe in Wonderland\n\nThis 2008 independent film portrays a troubled young girl (Elle Fanning) who displays compulsive behaviors and outbursts of anger. She seemingly finds some solace in an eccentric drama teacher who casts her as the lead in the school’s production of Alice in Wonderland. [click here to watch the trailer]\n\n10. Michael Clayton\n\nGeorge Clooney takes center stage as the title character, a “fixer” for a New York law firm, but an attorney having a bipolar episode triggers the action in this 2007 thriller. When Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) rants in court against the huge corporation his firm is defending in a class-action suit, the firm sends Clayton to handle the situation. Clayton knows Edens has bipolar and has stopped taking his medications. When Edens later says his phone is being tapped, Clayton dismisses it as paranoia. After Edens is found dead, Clayton’s suspicions grow and he begins to investigate the corporate cover-up. [click here to watch the trailer]\n\n11. Pollock (2000)\n\nThe 2000 biographical film — starring Ed Harris and Marcia Gay Harden — portrays Jackson Pollock’s life of art, addiction, and love. The abstract expressionist was famous for his distinctive style of drip painting. Throughout his life, Pollock struggled with alcoholism, and while the term bipolar was not used in the film, the illness is implied. [click here to watch the trailer]\n\n12. All She Ever Wanted\n\nWhen a young woman Rachel (Marcia Cross) with bipolar, and her husband Joe (James Marshall) are refused the opportunity to adopt a baby, they endeavor to have their own. With a strong desire for a baby and against the advice of her doctor, Rachel stops her lithium and gets pregnant. The entire pregnancy is fraught with challenges.\n\n13. Mad Love\n\nThis 1995 film is a somewhat sensationalized depiction of the highs and lows of bipolar, with Drew Barrymore playing a high-school student who has been hospitalized. Her boyfriend (Chris O’Donnell) helps her escape and tries to cope with her increasingly intense emotions and actions as they head toward Mexico. In the end, they return to Seattle, where she is readmitted to the psychiatric hospital and ultimately gets better. [click here to watch the trailer]\n\n14. Mr. Jones\n\nA surprisingly insightful portrait of euphoria, mania, and depression as experienced by the main character, played by Richard Gere. Most of the 1993 movie involves his hospitalization and treatment by a psychiatrist (Lena Olin) who begins an unethical romantic relationship with him. There was a disconnect between the film’s sensitivity and its marketing tagline, though: “Everything that makes him dangerous makes her love him more.” (NOTE: This film is controversial because of the inappropriate relationship between a patient and his medical provider.) [click here to watch the trailer]\n\n15. Vincent & Theo\n\nThe familiar tragic story of Vincent van Gogh (Tim Roth) is broadened by capturing the essence of his brother Theodore (Paul Rhys), who, believing in the genius of his brother, sacrificed much in his life in order to support his work.
