        "text": "CASTING\n\nCold War thriller “Whispers of Freedom” has set its principal cast, Variety has learned. “Masters of the Air” alum Cameron Ashplant will play the film’s lead, young East German Chris Gueffroy, while Darragh Cowley (who also appeared in “Masters of the Air”) co-stars as his close friend Christian Gaudian.\n\nSet in 1980s East Germany, the film is written and directed by Brandon Ashplant. It follows Chris and Christian as they try to escape the isolated Eastern bloc state. Wendy Makkena (“A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood”) joins as Chris’s mother Karin and Paul Freeman (“Raiders of the Lost Ark”) as East German leader Erich Honecker. Wolf Kahler (“The Great Escaper”) joins in a supporting role as Bruno Kabát.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nLondon Film Festival Unveils 2024 Dates - Global Bulletin\n\nVietnam's 'A Fragile Flower' Heads for U.S. Theatrical Release - Global Bulletin\n\n'Shark Tank,' 'Dragons' Den' Format Sets 50th Version in Bangladesh, Plans South Asia Expansion - Global Bulletin\n\n“Whispers of Freedom” goes into production next month. It is produced by Jonathan Tammuz and Golden Goat Films.\n\nDOCUMENTARY\n\nBBC Storyville has acquired documentary “We Will Dance Again” (working title) about the Hamas massacre at the Supernova Music Festival last October. Helmed by Yariv Mozer (“The Devil’s Confession: The Lost Eichmann Tapes”), it will include survivor testimony as well as previously unseen footage of the terror attack. The film will air in Israel on Channel 8. It is produced by Sipu, Bitchon 365, MGM Television and HSCC.\n\n“This documentary tells the story of innocent young people, forced to fight for their survival, told in their own words, beat-by-beat, in the claustrophobic intensity of real time,” reads the logline. “It is a painful story of loss and tragedy, but also one of bravery, sacrifice and heroism.”\n\nAPPOINTMENTS\n\nIsabel Begg has been appointed chair of Women in Film & TV (U.K.) She replaces Liz Tucker, who stood down last week after six years in the role. Begg was previously vice chair; Mel Rodrigues will step into the role.\n\n“WFTV remains a vitally important organisation – providing inspiration, strength, and knowledge to all women in our industry,” said Begg. “I am very excited and proud to be a part of the next chapter of WFTV, helping to usher in awareness and inclusivity across the U.K.”\n\nBest of Variety\n\n'One Tree Hill' Star Bethany Joy Lenz Announces Memoir 'Dinner for Vampires' Detailing Her Decade in a Hollywood Cult\n\nThis 'Sopranos' Box Set Is More Than Half Off Right Now\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney+ in March 2024"
