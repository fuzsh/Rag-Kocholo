        "text": "Let’s face it: we’ve been bored during quarantine. We’ve read dozens of books, baked frog-bread, and even resorted to shaving the sides of our heads. Netflix is starting to look dismal; is there a single show left to watch before turning to marble-racing live streams?\n\nNo worries! We have you covered with a list of our favorite quarantine watches. Whether you’re in the mood for a crime drama, campy fantasy, or harrowing documentary, you’re bound to find something to stream for a 2 AM binge.\n\nBooksmart\n\nCourtesy of Annapurna Pictures\n\nBooksmart hits so different in quarantine. As a rising high school senior, watching this film resonates with me because it’s the definitive cinematic “high school experience” for nerds like me! Booksmart reminds me that I can be smart and let myself live a little. I think it’s going to convince me to live a little louder post-quarantine.\n\n—Sophia Moore, writer\n\nAvailable on Hulu and Amazon.\n\nGregg Araki’s Teen Apocalypse trilogy\n\nCourtesy of Strand Releasing\n\nSpanning from 1993 to 1997, Gregg Araki’s Teen Apocalypse trilogy is a revolutionary watch. The films all focus on LGBT characters and really harness the loneliness that comes with being gay. Each part of the trilogy is so heavily stylized that it’s easy to become submerged in them.\n\n—Kaiya Shunyata, writer\n\nAvailable on Amazon.\n\nAvatar: The Last Airbender\n\nCourtesy of Nickelodeon\n\nAs a whole, I think Avatar is a really hopeful show. It begins in the midst of a global war, with the aggressors on the brink of victory, but it ends with a restoration of balance. That’s a really comforting sentiment right now: that even when the end seems near, we can be saved by love and friendship.\n\n—Isabelle Robinson, writer\n\nAvailable on Netflix.\n\nLife Overtakes Me\n\nCourtesy of Netflix\n\nSince I don’t get to go to school these days and my online classes have been canceled, I love taking every opportunity I can to learn. Life Overtakes Me is about a mysterious phenomenon affecting the children of Swedish refugees; after experiencing some form of persecution, they withdraw from the world and slip into a coma. It’s crazy.\n\n—Angel Martinez, writer\n\nAvailable on Netflix.\n\nLittle Fires Everywhere\n\nCourtesy of Hulu\n\nReese Witherspoon and Kerry Washington are AMAZING in Little Fires Everywhere. Honestly, the show doesn’t have a weak link in terms of actors. It has an interesting plotline and tackles so many issues really well, including race, marriage, and privilege.\n\n—Dahlia Theriault, graphic designer\n\nAvailable on Hulu.\n\nKilling Eve\n\nCourtesy of Hulu\n\nI’ve been loving Killing Eve, a darkly funny spy thriller. Phoebe Waller-Bridge wrote the first season, and it stars Sandra Oh, so you know right off the bat that it’s going to be good. The ‘obsessive Russian psychopath’ storyline is so seductive; I fell in love with the show immediately.\n\n—Katherine Williams, newsletter director\n\nAvailable on Hulu and the BBC app.\n\nGlee\n\nCourtesy of Fox\n\nI was a ‘gleek’ back in the day, and I’ve been having the time of my life rewatching it. Glee was a source of happiness for me, and reliving that in quarantine allows me to see the show in a different light. Some of the storylines have not aged well at all, but I have so much nostalgia for it.\n\n—Chisom Okoye, outreach coordinator\n\nAvailable on Netflix.\n\nNow Apocalypse\n\nCourtesy of Sundance Institute\n\nIf someone made a chaotic mash-up of all my teenage celebrity crushes in a sexually fluid, dreamlike television show, it would be Now Apocalypse. Highlights include watching Avan Jogia (Victorious) and Tyler Posey (Teen Wolf) make out, and later watching Avan Jogia and Jacob Artist (Glee) make out.\n\n—Meghan Chiew, writer\n\nAvailable on STARZ.\n\nNever Rarely Sometimes Always\n\nCourtesy of Focus Features\n\nI loved Never Rarely Sometimes Always! It was a real and raw abortion drama that showed how much emotional turmoil abortions cause for women. It’s important to see that in an age where people are more concerned with the baby than the woman.\n\n—Chloe Rose, writer\n\nAvailable for purchase on Amazon.\n\nThe Newsroom\n\nCourtesy of HBO\n\nI started watching The Newsroom, and it has definitely been my favorite thing I’ve watched in quarantine. It’s about a cable news network during the first Obama administration. The journalists in The Newsroom are committed to doing the right thing and sharing the facts, which was comforting to watch at the beginning of quarantine when things were very uncertain.\n\n—Irine Le, writer\n\nAvailable on Hulu and HBO Max.\n\nBetty Tells Her Story\n\nImage credit: Liane Brandon\n\nI recently watched this short film called Betty Tells Her Story from the ’70s about a woman who tells a story about buying a dress and not feeling beautiful in it. She tells it twice; the first time, it’s just the events as they happened, but the second time you can feel how much it impacted her.\n\n—Colette Bernheim, writer\n\nAvailable on Kanopy.\n\nThe Little Drummer Girl\n\nCourtesy of AMC\n\nI watched a mini-series called The Little Drummer Girl during quarantine. Its art direction was evocative of French new wave, using cool-toned color grading and vibrant costumes, but the most captivating part was the performances from Michael Shannon, Alexander Skarsgard, and Florence Pugh.\n\n—Esme Lee, writer\n\nAvailable on Amazon Prime.\n\nRun\n\nCourtesy of HBO\n\nI’m currently binge-watching Run. This is a time where we want to feel deeply immersed in something familiar yet foreign… for that feeling, the thriller genre is just the perfect escape.\n\n—Saffron Maeve, writer\n\nAvailable on HBO.\n\nBy MJ Brown"
