        "text": "2021 was another vintage year for Crime on the now-dominant streaming services with many of the series tackling contemporary social problems in compelling ways.\n\nDopesick/The Crime of the Century – Dopesick, the fictional series, documents the spread of oxycontin in the Appalachian population, a group of workers that will become redundant as coal disappears and now consigned to death by overdose. Michael Keaton is particularly effective as a country doctor who could have become a Disney type “wise old salt” but who instead undergoes a painful metamorphosis. Meanwhile, two dogged state prosecutors attempt to sound the alarm while the Sackler scion first pushes the drug and in a final cowardly act attempts to remove the family wealth from any financial liability. Alex Gibney’s two-part doc, on the creation in pharmaceutical labs of oxycontin and its’ even more deadly cousin fentanyl, follows with almost fictional intensity the two creators as they market their deadly product, concerned only with their own profit margins.\n\nGoliath Season 4 – The last season for this series about an alcoholic but crusading lawyer played impeccably by Billy Bob Thornton, is short on the personal peccadillos of the character, which became a drag in seasons 2 and 3, and long on his struggle to bring a drug company again in the Sackler/Purdue Pharma vein to task. David E. Kelly’s trademark courtroom reversals and heroics here are in the service of proving that the drug company was not in the business of easing pain but rather, as Thornton’s lawyer claims, in the much more profitable business of “promoting addiction.”\n\nThin Ice – This Swedish series, available on Amazon Prime, set at a climate conference in Greenland, was the best political thriller of the year. It centers on the exploitation of the Arctic as a way of profiting from Global Warming. The series cannily encompasses the indigenous question in Greenland, Danish profiting from its control over the land mass, and Russian, U.S. and Nordic jockeying for position to mine the area and control its seaways. The series initially focuses on Russia as the threat to Arctic harmony, but by the end works its way around to the greater threat as we recall Donald Trump’s offer to “just buy Greenland.”\n\nTandav – This Indian series from Amazon, unlike fluff like Mira Nair’s Netflix outing A Suitable Boy, begins with a farmer’s strike in Delhi at the moment when farmers were actually in the street protesting the Indian premier Modi’s attempt to make their life more onerous so they would collapse and be absorbed by Indian Agribusiness. The police, two roly-poly seemingly comic figures, then massacre the demonstrators while in the upper echelons of Indian society a palace coup brings a conniving son to power in a critique of Modi-style neoliberalism that was rivaled in the film department by Netflix’ equally vicious The White Tiger.\n\nPros and Cons – This Danish series, available on Amazon Prime, follows the exploits of two scam artists, Eric and Nina, who give up the game and instead go straight, only to find that their jobs either pay little or involve necessary sexual liaisons to get ahead. Overwhelmed with the daily pressure of making ends meet, they decide to return to scamming as the only way to partake of any of the wealth that they see all around them. As good a representation of the desperation of the Western capitalist working class as television allows and a nicely done series of reversals as they strike pharmaceutical and cosmetics companies who are in the business themselves of scamming their customers.\n\nWanted/The Unusual Suspects – Two female revenge series from Australia, the first available on Netflix, the second on Hulu. Wanted is a more advanced Thelma and Louise which emphasizes the class differences between two women on the run and the patriarchal web they are snared in as they are pursued by drug kingpins and corrupt cops. The second focuses on the high-end relationships between gated community privileged wives and their maids as the two discover they have more in common then they think, as each are left high and dry by men who cheat them and as they join forces to plan a heist to secure their future. The Unusual Suspects is also revealing about how much of the contemporary landscape is simply an advanced Ponzi scheme, describing a society which while once fraying at the edges is now collapsing at the center.\n\nFor Life – Season 2 of this ABC series began with a bang as Aaron Wallace won his release from prison where he, like many Black men, was incarcerated for a crime he did not commit. The show then falters as it focuses on the personal relationship between Wallace and his wife but picks up momentum and becomes a series for the ages as it incorporates, on the fly almost as they are happening, two events. The first is the concealing of COVID deaths in prisons which turn because of the inattention and rapid spread of the virus from detention cells to slaughterhouses. The second has now prosecutor Wallace pursuing and placing on trial a cop in a Black Lives Matter plot that illustrates that Serial TV can tackle current issues with an urgency that belies the usual use of the form to surround viewers with ever more hyper-mediatic and slick modes of endless referentiality (Can you say Fairfax?) The reward for this trailblazing – the series was cancelled.\n\nMare of Easttown – Kate Winslet was astonishingly authentic in this HBO series about Winslet’s detective, yes tracking a murderer, but also confronted with the decaying situation of an American rust-belt type working class left for dead in a Pennsylvania ex-mining and manufacturing town. The thickness of the web of relationships, both familial and communitarian, that Winslet’s character encounters suggests that those relationships have not been entirely torn asunder by the economic devastation wrecked on them by American capital’s flight to where it can extract lower wages. Jean Smart’s cynical but ultimately caring and supportive mother was another revelation of this series.\n\nClean Break –This Irish series, streaming on Acorn, slowly, methodically traces the increasing desperation and inability to alter his situation except through crime of a bankrupt car dealership owner whose upright, moralistic banker keeps tightening the screws on him and enjoying his misery. The small businessman’s bad decisions and the corruption of all those around him describe a world where class contradictions are so acute as to make life impossible for all but those few who control the purse strings.\n\nSnowpiercer Season 2 – Sophomore outing of this Bong Joon-ho (Parasite) series, about a train with the last survivors on earth after a climate catastrophe, picks up after a revolution led by Daveed Diggs’ Detroit detective has overthrown the rigid class structure of the vehicle. Arriving to re-instill capitalist discipline is Sean Bean’s Mr. Wilford, a neoliberal Richard Branson/Elon Musk type whose contempt for equality drips from every corner of his mouth onto his fur coat. The madam Audrey plays Eva Braun to Wilford’s fuehrer who plans to retake his train with the aid of a Dr. Mengele-type scientific couple. The season is about laying bare the savagery that underlies the cult of the contemporary CEO and couldn’t be more relevant with Musk himself, who boasted about the coup in Bolivia to secure lithium for his company, named Time magazine’s Man of the Year.\n\nHome Before Dark Season 2 – This series about a pre-teen crusading journalist in its sophomore outing has Hilde tackling a company that has for years polluted her Washington state town and that affects her relationship with her grandfather directly. In this moment of the battle to keep Julian Assange from being turned over to the blindness of U.S. justice for the crime of revealing the empire’s secrets, this series is again a refreshing fictional reminder of what journalism can be as well as a riposte to Apple’s mammoth-budget celebration of the banality of the form in The Morning Show.\n\nBack to life Season 2 – Second season of this Daisy (Episodes) Haggard BBC series, streaming on Showtime, has Mimi, having returned from prison, this time pursued by the sadistic police chief who is the father of the friend she unwittingly victimized. The show covers ground initially mapped out on the Sundance series Rectify but with Haggard’s humor intact as she battles to be recognized as someone who has paid her debt in an unforgiving and narrow-minded society.\n\nBitter Daisies – The second season of this Netflix series about a woman fighting back and trying to expose the systematic male power and brutality of a Galician town in Spain culminates in an Eyes Wide Shut “party” that results in a final revenge for multiple young and underage women exploited in a Ghislaine Maxwell/Jeffrey Epstein mode. Season two does partially partake in a voyeuristic “pleasure” in this forced copulation but its sharper edge still echoes forcefully and in so doing points out how another Spanish Netflix hit Money Heist which began on Spanish TV with so much potential has in the initial episodes of its final season substituted an ever-accelerating series of ever more meaningless shocks for what was initially a populist fantasy about returning wealth to the people.\n\nC.B. Strike – The heart of this series, based on the J. K. Rowling novels, is the relationship between the hobbling detective Strike and his one-time secretary, now partner, Robin. The intrigues, often involving the crimes of state officials or wealthy families, take a back seat in the series to Robin’s slow and painful coming to grips with the realization that the comfortable life offered to her by her corporate partner and soon-to-be husband does not make her happy. This lifestyle of the rich and privileged begins to exact more and more a burden on her as the series progresses and as she begins to question its value. A quandary that those still fortunate enough to have a job find themselves in today.\n\nHightown – Complex, flawed and utterly compelling characters on both sides of the law distinguished this series about a deadly drug infestation on the waterfront of Provincetown’s Cape Cod. Jackie Quinones’ lesbian addict, a “fish detective” who in season two joins the police force was the most fascinating of the bunch as she moved forward and then backward in her career and in her recovery on this Starz streamer.\n\nBig Sky – The first half of this David E. Kelly ABC series was a stunning reversal of the usual powerlessness of the serial killer plot with combinations of women of mixed races and sexual orientations fighting back. The second arc, involving the decaying head of a Montana ranch, was also powerful but by the second season the show had fallen into a more simplified “twisty” tale that moved the series from groundbreaking to comfort TV, from a challenging series to one that is a guilty pleasure.\n\nBurden of Truth Season 4 – A revival for this Canadian series (streaming on Hulu) as former corporate lawyer Joanna defends a Native American woman who wages a lone battle against a mining company which plans to lay waste the town as her fellows urge her to take the money and run. The indigenous element enlivens multiple plot lines on the series and gives it its raison d’être.\n\nBiohackers Season 2 – The waters muddy a bit in this second outing for the Netflix German series, initially exploring the underside of biogenetic engineering with last season’s scientist/professor/villainess enlisted by Mia, the student who took her down, against an even more powerful and ruthless foe, the private financier of a pharmaceutical empire.\n\nDennis Broe is the author of Diary of a Digital Plague Year: Corona Culture, Serial TV and The Rise of the Streaming Services and two crime novels, Left of Eden and A Hello to Arms."
