        "text": "Thank you for trusting MSE Supplies. Your quote will be emailed to you momentarily.\n\nFor any questions, please contact us at sales@msesupplies.com.\n\nMSE Supplies offers Lithium Niobate ( LiNbO3) Thin Film (LNOI) on Insulator wafer. LNOI wafer consists of an insulating substrate with lithium niobate layer deposited on it. Lithium niobate is a versatile material with high nonlinearities and unique optical and electro-optical properties, which is widely used in photonics related applications, including modulators and many other optical communication devices. The insulating substrate provides a stable platform and reduces surface recombination, which makes it a better material than bulk lithium niobate in many ways, including smaller size and footprint (suitable for integration of miniaturized electronic devices), lower propagation loss ( more efficient), higher mechanical stability and resistance to environment, etc. It is now investigated as a promising material for the development of next-generation electronic and photonic devices."
