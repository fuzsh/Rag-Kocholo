        "text": "Lithium, a key ingredient in lightweight batteries, is already powering the modern world, and could be key to getting the world to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nLook at a satellite image of South America. Halfway down on the left-hand-side is a distinctive white splodge.\n\nClose up, that splodge turns out to be one of the most extraordinary and unspoilt places on earth, the world's biggest salt flat.\n\nIt is a crisp, perfectly flat white plain, like freshly fallen snow, 100km (60 miles) across and 3,600m (12,000ft) up in the remote Bolivian Andes.\n\nThis is the Salar de Uyuni and this hauntingly beautiful place could be part of the key to tackling climate change, helping to wean the world away from fossil fuels.\n\nWhich is why, pristine as it may be, the chances are that 50 years from now it will all be gone - dredged, crystallised and then carted away.\n\nThat's because under its thick salt crust, the Salar de Uyuni is also the world's biggest single deposit of lithium, accounting for perhaps a third of the world's resources of this alkaline metal.\n\nGo back to the 1980s, and lithium was one of the more obscure members of the periodic table, much as its next-door neighbour beryllium remains today.\n\nThat all began to change in 1991, when Sony launched the first ever portable gadget powered by a lithium-ion battery.\n\nToday, of course, the words \"lithium\" and \"battery\" are almost synonymous - this soft metal is in all our smartphones, tablets and laptops.\n\nThe secret of lithium's success is that it is the third element of the periodic table, after the gases hydrogen and helium.\n\nIts simple atoms, containing just three protons each, make lithium the lightest of all metals.\n\nIn its pure form, lithium will actually float on the oil it is normally stored in by chemists.\n\nAnd it is stored in oil, under the inert gas argon, for a reason.\n\nFor lithium is also the first of the alkali metals - like its near kin sodium and potassium, it will react spontaneously to water, though not quite as violently as those other two.\n\nAll of which makes lithium an ideal material for light-weight batteries.\n\n\"We think of batteries as producing an electrical current, sending electrons around a circuit,\" explains chemistry professor Andrea Sella of University College London.\n\n\"But of course, as a chemist, I am interested in what goes on inside the battery. And for every electron, a lithium ion also has to move inside the battery.\"\n\nBeing so light, the atoms slip easily between the layered materials that make up the battery.\n\nAnd its lightness also makes lithium the most energy dense of battery materials - meaning it stores the most energy for a given weight.\n\nThis is why lithium is so important for the battle against climate change. It is the optimum battery material if you need to carry your energy store with you - in a gadget, or in a car.\n\nBatteries are not the only things that take advantage of lithium's unique electrochemical properties.\n\nThe human body does as well.\n\n\"Lithium saved my life. I would be dead or in the back wards without it,\" says Kay Redfield Jamison, professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.\n\nProfessor Jamison is an expert on bipolar disorder - also known as manic depression - who herself suffers from the condition.\n\nLike many sufferers of bipolar illness she says pills made of purified lithium carbonate, the same naturally-occurring substance that is mined in many salt lakes today, has helped smooth out the frenetic highs and suicidal lows of this disease.\n\n\"When against medical advice I haven't been on it, I almost immediately started getting manic and then suicidally depressed,\" she says.\n\nAnd while those on lithium do not exactly have a normal life - the pills can cause nausea and leave them feeling emotionally inhibited - it has prevented many from taking their own lives.\n\nHow this happens remains something of a mystery.\n\nHowever, it probably has something to do with the fact that our nerves and brains don't operate using flows of electrons, as you may imagine.\n\nInstead, they rely on flows of ions - positively charged particles of sodium and potassium.\n\nIt may be that lithium ions soften the swings between overactive and underactive flows of these ions that researchers theorise are behind bipolar disorder.\n\nMedicine is likely to continue to use a steady supply of lithium, but according to the Chilean mining company SQM, the reason demand for the metal has been growing at 20% a year is increased demand for lithium batteries.\n\nAnd the biggest driver of demand is not for gadgets, but for cars.\n\nFuel-efficient hybrid cars, which use electric motors powered by lithium batteries alongside conventional gasoline or diesel engines, are proving very popular.\n\nThe market for pure electric vehicles has been slower to develop, thanks in large part to the limitations of lithium batteries.\n\n\"In its pure form, lithium actually has the same energy density as gasoline,\" explains Prof Nigel Brandon of Imperial College in London, one of thousands of researchers engaged in a huge worldwide effort to eke out ever better performance from our batteries.\n\n\"But we cannot use lithium in its pure form. We have to store it in other materials, and that dilutes the energy density of batteries in practice.\"\n\nThrow in the weight of the two electrodes, the casing, the electrolyte fluid and so on, and the energy-storing performance of your average electric car battery turns out to be only one 50th as good as a tank of petrol.\n\nThat matters, because the less energy the battery can store, the more limited the car's range.\n\nThe limited range of electric cars is one of the main reasons people are unwilling to switch to them.\n\nBut the good news is there is scope for improvement.\n\nProfessor Brandon reckons we could see a five-fold increase in energy density over the next two decades, perhaps even 10-fold or more, if new technologies prove successful.\n\nA lot of current research is focused on \"lithium-air\" batteries, where much of the battery would be replaced with oxygen drawn from the atmosphere.\n\nEven so, says Professor Brandon, the limits of lithium battery chemistry mean they will never come near gasoline in terms of energy density.\n\nIndeed, in most handheld gadgets improvements in running time have had less to do with the performance of batteries than with the great steps that have been made reducing power consumption.\n\nThe same is likely to be true for electric vehicles for the foreseeable future - engineers will have to design them around the limitations of batteries.\n\nLimits on energy density are not the only problem, because it is not the only thing you care about in a battery.\n\nOtherwise, why have lead-acid batteries in traditional petrol-driven cars, given that lead is the heaviest stable element in the periodic table?\n\nThe reason is that lead provides two things that lithium currently cannot - the surge of power needed to fire up your engine, and incredible durability over thousands of cycles of the battery, no matter how hot or cold the weather.\n\nAs an alkali metal, lithium's high reactivity turns out to be a bit of an Achilles' heel, because unwanted chemical reactions inside the battery cause it to degrade over time.\n\nAnd while that may be fine in a phone, that has a typical working life of two-to-three years, it is much more of a headache if you want your car battery to last closer to a decade.\n\nDurability is not the only trade-off that researchers like Prof Brandon have to grapple with.\n\nThe battery also has to be safe, and cheap.\n\nAnd, as certain plane and car manufacturers have discovered, lithium batteries do occasionally overheat and catch fire.\n\nNonetheless, we prize the freedoms batteries give us and the electro-chemical properties of lithium mean it will remain central to their future.\n\nAll of which brings us back to South America.\n\nBolivia's Salar de Uyuni is one corner of a \"Lithium Triangle\" that also takes in the northern ends of Chile and Argentina.\n\nGeography is part of the reason.\n\nThe Atacama deposit is richer in lithium than Uyuni and is easier to exploit because it is nearer the sea and, instead of stuck at the top of a mountain range, it is on a flat plain.\n\nThat makes the roads and infrastructure needed for export much cheaper.\n\nBut politics is also a key factor.\n\nThe Salar de Atacama is controlled by a government in Santiago that has a long and happy working relationship with the foreign mining companies who have exploited Chile's largest mineral resource, copper.\n\nContrast that with the radical-left Bolivian government which has vowed not to sell out to Western companies - assuming those Western companies would trust the government not to expropriate them.\n\nBut, if the world is to meet the future demand, other deposits will need to be opened up.\n\nMost are in problematic locations - Tibet, Afghanistan, and of course Bolivia.\n\nIf the Bolivian government can learn to work with foreigners who have the necessary expertise and deep pockets to bring the stuff to market, then the Salar de Uyuni could prove a bonanza for one of the poorest countries in South America.\n\nAnd the Bolivians have just begun a pilot mining project.\n\nSo visit this incredible location now, if you can, because there may not be much left of it once the lithium miners have finished their work.\n\nListen to the latest from Business Daily or browse the podcast archive\n\nFollow @BBCNewsMagazine, external on Twitter and on Facebook, external"
