        "text": "“I’d been wanting to make a short film based on my personal experiences, which I could explore through characters that I’d find relatable. Initially, it felt like any ideas I’d come up with was too contrived until my mum called me one night – the conversation I had with her inspired me to make this short film. She asked me how my job was; I said that my 9-to-5 was going well when in reality I’d been sitting in my living room most of the day trying to come up with film ideas. I was struck by how many lies I’d tell her just to satisfy her expectations of me.”\n\n“We made Evening Shadows to reach out to a larger audience about the need for families to accept their LGBTQ children. The film is more than a coming out film; it is about a woman steeped in traditions and conservative social mores, standing up for her son against all odds. Evening Shadows is a film of hope and courage.\n\nWe always felt that there was no mainstream film that youngsters can show their parents as a means of helping them understand their true reality, and also for families to understand more about their children. The film, made with a simple heartfelt narrative with no auteur, flourishes so it can appeal to a large family audience in India and across the world.”\n\n“In the South Asian community, the term “American-Born Confused Desi” (“ABCD”) refers to children of immigrants who were born and raised in the United States. Being an “ABCD” suggests that as first generation Indian-Americans, we ignore our culture and solely adopt American beliefs. However, for children of immigrants, there are many nuances and challenges to defining our identities. How do we respect our family’s rich heritage and live a life true to who we are as Americans?”\n\n“I love would more people to watch the film. I’m proud of the performances in this film. They should be seen! Unlike the west, India is still a no-sex society where sexuality is repressed and more than often a taboo subject. I would like to play with these uncomfortable and confronting boundaries, hoping to extend this discourse to an Indian audience.”\n\n“While directing this film about being in the closet, I never felt so much joy move through me as by the process of transforming political trauma into hopeful art. It’s been one of the most meaningful things I have ever done in my life. I am queer Indian-American woman whose parents migrated to the U.S. from India, which recriminalized homosexuality in 2013. I know the emotional pain of the closet intimately, in a variety of ways. Directing this film, and working with such a diverse cast of queer actors and actors of color, created this beautiful blurring of boundaries between fiction and documentary.”\n\n“I was always tormented by the deep seeded hypocrisy that festered in India when it came to the LGBTQI community. Our country, like many others, does not acknowledge the most basic human right to be able to love whoever we please. I have seen a lot of dear and near people severely negatively affected by this. There are a lot of groups now who are fighting for these rights. I wanted to give this cause another voice, mine.”\n\n“There are series of issues already being debated about Angry Indian Goddesses: women’s empowerment, gender inequality, violence, rape…Then there was a massive censorship debate in India on our film. We had to cut out words like “sexy” “orgasm” or “Indian Figure.” I thought that was outrageous. We were asked to blur all the images of Goddesses. This entire episode started a big debate on the role of women in Modern India and is still going on!”"
