        "text": "What’s on your “must-watch” list? Any films or series featuring characters who live with bipolar? Check out these shows and movies that keep pushing the conversation forward.\n\nRepresentation matters. The images, characters, and ideas we agree upon and share with each other can have a significant impact on how — or even whether — we relate to one another.\n\nYour next-door neighbor or coworker may not know what it’s like to live with a brain-based condition like bipolar, what it feels like to experience a manic episode or spend months in a dark depression. But that doesn’t mean they can’t connect with, understand, or support you.\n\nOne of the best ways to get to know someone new — or to reconnect with someone — is to chat about what you’re watching.\n\nThese shows and films are contributing to those all-important conversations we have each day, over lunch, across the yard, and on the national level. Each features a character with bipolar disorder or addresses important aspects of the diagnosis, whether as a central focus or a supporting element.\n\nSensitivity Note: Some viewers may find some content, plot points, visual/audio elements, style, and/or language to be upsetting. Please be sure to identify the appropriate age/maturity recommendations for each series or film and assess them for personal triggers prior to watching.\n\n1. Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story (Netflix)\n\nThis Bridgerton prequel highlights the mental health challenges of Britian’s King George III (Corey Mylchreest), focusing on Queen Charlotte’s (India Amarteifio) critical role in his life. While the mini-series stops short of diagnosing the former king with bipolar disorder — a topic of historical debate — medical consensus today suggests he likely struggled with the condition. The drama insightfully shows the impact of mental health challenges on intimate relationships, mainly through Charlotte’s efforts to support her husband and reduce the triggers of his manic episodes.\n\n2. Modern Love (Amazon Prime Video)\n\nIt started as a column, then became a book, a podcast, and a streaming series. Each episode of Modern Love is based on an essay by writer and former entertainment lawyer Terri Cheney, who revealed her diagnosis of bipolar in a powerful and very public way after hiding her struggles from colleagues and romantic partners for years. In the series, Anne Hathaway brings to life Cheney’s personal experience with bipolar depression and mania.\n\n3. Spinning Out (Netflix)\n\nIn its single-season run, Spinning Out centers on the evolution of competitive figure skater Kat Baker (Kaya Scodelario), who considers leaving the sport after a bad fall. The Olympic hopeful shifts her focus from solo to pair skating with a new partner, all while grappling with her diagnosis of bipolar disorder and her family’s secret mental health challenges.\n\n4. All the Bright Places (Netflix)\n\nJennifer Niven, an author of both fiction and nonfiction — for adults and young adults — took her time writing the award-winning YA novel All the Bright Places, which was recently adapted for film. The main characters of All the Bright Places confront heavy topics ranging from depression, survivor’s guilt, disordered eating, erratic moods, and grief. Niven handles the story carefully and vividly, as it was inspired by her past relationship with a person who lived with bipolar disorder.\n\n5. Lady Dynamite (Netflix)\n\nComedian and actor Maria Bamford stars in the Netflix original comedy series Lady Dynamite. The loosely biographical show is based on her hospitalization and subsequent diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Lady Dynamite portrays Bamford’s attempts to rebuild her life in Los Angeles after spending six months in recovery and comedically reflects on her personal backstory as well as her relationships.\n\n6. Inside Out (Disney+)\n\nAlthough this Academy Award–winning animated film does not overtly discuss bipolar disorder, Inside Out can help people of all ages better understand themselves, their emotions, and each other. Throughout the movie, we follow relatable characters who personify feelings and reside in the mind of the main (human) character. Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust encounter and work through familiar challenges experienced by a child named Riley, who is dealing with the jarring transition of a cross-country move.\n\n7. Touched With Fire (Amazon Prime Video)\n\nThis romance-drama draws inspiration from Kay Redfield Jamison‘s book of the same name. Carla (Katie Holmes) and Marco (Luke Kirby) play poets who meet in the hospital where both are seeking treatment for bipolar disorder. Touched With Fire uses art to depict both mania and depression, and it was written and directed by Paul Dalio who was informed by his own experiences with bipolar.\n\n8. Kissed by God (Amazon Prime Video)\n\nKissed by God is a documentary about world-champion surfer Andy Irons, who died in 2010. Throughout his life he dealt with both bipolar disorder and opioid addiction, and the film both tells his story and dispels harmful myths about both illnesses.\n\nAdditional Reporting by Caitlin Flynn"
