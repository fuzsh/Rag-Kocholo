        "text": "Extra Profits for the Exclusive Drying Technolog\n\nSignificant reduction in air for the drying process\n\nThe existing film-making technology will use Air-dry method to remove the solvent after extraction, which uses huge amount of heated dry air. Our technology uses warm water as heating media, no air-dry is need and can reduce the cost of dry air and environmental management.\n\nHugely reduces burden of Gas recovery system\n\nWith the warm water drying technology, exhaust gas will have a high solvent concentration and low air flow. It is suitable to use technology other than active carbon to recycle solvent. This device uses less space and energy consumption.\n\nSignificant reduction of Active carbon gas recovery system requirement\n\nAs it can use other technologies for the main exhaust gas recovery, demand for active carbon recycling system has lowered. This can hugely reduce the investment cost of active carbon and the operation cost including steam, cooling water, chilling water, etc.\n\nFor more information products, please feel free to contact us."
