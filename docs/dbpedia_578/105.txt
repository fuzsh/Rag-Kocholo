The Canadian Screen Award for Best First Feature is awarded by the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television to recognize the year's best feature film by a first-time director. The winner is selected by a jury of Canadian filmmakers and announced in advance of the awards ceremony.

Originally known as the Claude Jutra Award, it was presented by the Genie Awards from 1993 until 2012. It was then bestowed by the Canadian Screen Awards from 2013 to 2015. In 2016, the name was changed following posthumous allegations that Jutra was a pedophile.
