Following the completion of my recent production EMPORTE-MOI, I thought it was necessary as an artist to expand my universe.\"\n\nLost and Delirious has proven to be the ideal film to further explore and expand themes that are of critical interest to myself. The themes of adolescence, homosexuality and the quest for true love were perfectly executed by the novelist Susan Swan and the screenplay writer, Judith Thompson.\n\nLost and Delirious truly represents the ideal marriage between my vision and the vision of the writers and actors.\n\nLéa Pool\n\nLost & Delirious\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nI felt like a tiny grey mouse heading straight for the mouth of a cat\n\nMouse Bradford has just arrived at Perkins Girls College. She has left behind the small town where she grew up, her father and her stepmother. Mouse is quickly adopted by her two senior roommates, the striking, sharp-witted Paulie and the charming and beautiful Tory. These three bond over loss. Mouse has lost her mother, Paulie lost the parents who gave her up for adoption and Tory is losing herself to fit her parents expectations. They become inseparable.\n\nAlthough they are the closest friends Mouse has ever had, she is still confused by the depth of the relationship between Paulie and Tory.\n\nThis world comes crashing down when Tory and Paulie are inadvertently caught in a compromising situation. Unable to justify their relationship to her family, Tory gives in to the pressure and distances herself from Paulie and her own feelings. Defiantly refusing to submit, Paulie struggles to keep Tory. Mouse is left torn between her friends.\n\nA haunting connection with the falcon she rescued begins to cloud Paulies mind. When Tory gives in to a boys infatuation to prove she is normal, it drives Paulie to strike out with dramatic consequences.\n\nLost and Delirious is about the friendship of three teenagers and how they experience it in a private school. Throughout the film, the lost girls question their relationships with one another and the authority of others, while desperately attempting to seek out true love and meaningful emotional connections in their confused adolescent lives.\n\nLost & Delirious\n\nABOUT THE PRODUCTION\n\nLéa Pools English language directorial debut, Lost and Delirious, based on the novel The Wives of Bath by Susan Swan, is a powerful love story featuring three unforgettable teenaged girls: Paulie (Piper Perabo), Tory (Jessica Paré9, and Mouse (Mischa Barton). Intensified by the confined setting of their girls boarding school, its about a love deeper than sexuality that is bred of the loyalty and friendship that connects souls. The strong, complex blond between them leads to a tragic event that no one could have anticipated.\n\nIts about loving somebody for who they are, no matter their gender, according to Paré. The story of these two girls is about a friendship that becomes more and more intense. I think Tory wants Paulie because shes her best friend and shes totally devoted to her.\n\nThe film is about that strange loyalty between girls, where it takes them, and that passion and idealism of adolescence, that time when everything is so intense and seems to matter so much, elaborates Jackie Burroughs, the veteran actress who playas Fay Vaughn, the schools headmistress.\n\nPiper Perabo feels the film is about pushing the boundaries of love. Understandable, five that her character, Paulie, is totally uncompromising and unapologetic in her obsession with Tory.\n\nIts as if theyre separate halves of each other, so when you take Tory away from Paulie, its like taking the ground out from under her feet, Perabo explains. Besides being her lover, Tory is her hold on the world.\n\nAnalyzing her character, Perabo goes on, Paulie is intensely passionate. Shes studies and academic, she devours knowledge and is interested in trying it all out. But I dont think shes processed in all into real wisdom yet.\n\nAs for what it is she finds attractive in Paulie, Perabo adds, I like it that she is fighting from the inside out, from this very controlled boarding school where all the girl are in uniform. I like how passionate she is about her education and her love, how shes constantly going out and jumping off cliffs, so to speak.\n\nParés character, Tory, is a little more susceptible to reason as an antidote to passion this compels her to consider the consequences of a lesbian relationship. She is subject to the pressure of her family and school environment, refusing to pursue the relationship further. Deffering to these stresses, she falls in love with Jake, a student at a nearby boys school.\n\nJake is played by first time film actor Luke Kirby. Status is very important to Jake. He thinks of Tory as his trophy girl, he says of his character. Of Paulies reaction to Jakes relationship with Tory, he offers, If youre lucky enough to experience the horror of passion at\n\nLost & Delirious\n\nsuch a young age, you go through this moment when perspective is obliterated and you ride wave of passion.\n\nThe subject matter of the film has the potential to engender controversy, a prospect Paré recognized, saying, It might be a little controversial because the girls are so young, but the story is certainly accessible to everyone.\n\nThe third major character is Mouse, a shiy, timid, new girl who is assigned to share the room already occupied by Paulie and Tory. She adds a very interesting dimension to the structure of the film because the sotry is foremost about the relationship between Paulie and Tory, but is told through Mouses point of view.\n\nMouse is caught in a state of indecision, Barton explains about her character. She doesnt know whose side she want to take, and she doesnt want to have to take a side.\n\nThe three girls have bonded on the set and all profess to get along very well. This is especially important between Paré and Perabo, given the intimacy of some scenes they play together.\n\nFor Perabo it has been helpful having fellow New Yorker Barton on set in Quebec to help alleviate the homesickness. Of her acting, Perabo says, Mischa is very innocent and expressive, so its always heartbreaking to do scenes with her because its so amazing what comes out of her eyes.\n\nThe intensity of the subject matter and the passion of the characters are a challenge for each of the actors to sustain. As Perabo puts it, Its exhausting to be this intense, but its an intensity that refuels itself.\n\nDirector Pool expresses how impressed she is with the talents demonstrated by her young actory, notwithstanding their relative inexperience, These three young actresses feel free to go as far as they cam. They are so confident. I am amazed by them. I just give them some marks and then the space where they can explore. We have great trust among us and it works well.\n\nHer actors reciprocate hey compliments. They were attracted to the project largely for the opportunity to work with her and the be involved with one of her films. Paré notes the trust she exhibits towards the actors instincts. Pool allows them to try out scenes as they see fit before coming forth with her own recommendations of how to play them.\n\nSay Burroughs, Léa is a genuine auteur and to be part of her perception it the world is exciting.\n\nI saw Emporte-moi and it blew my mind, affirms Perabo. I thought, If I could ever get to work with Léa, I have to go wherever she is. She brings a whole world with her to the film and you cant help but get inside that world with her.\n\nThe film was shot on location in Montreal and on the sumptuous grounds of Bishops University in Lennoxville, in Quebecs Eastern Townships.\n\nLost & Delirious\n\nABOUT THE FILMMAKERS\n\nLÉA POOL (Director)\n\nLost and Delirious marks the English language directorial debut for Léa Pool, who stands out in the world of cinema for her own originality.

The novel is based on the journals of Asked For Adams, the niece of former American President John Adams, who travelled with the legendary Venetian in the last years of his life. The research she undertook is the inspiration for a symposium she is hosting as Robarts Chair in Canadian Studies at Torontos York University. The moveable millennial wisdom symposium features eighteen novelists, historians, and archaeologists talking about the way the past is recreated in popular culture and what wisdom the past has to offer as we move into this new century.\n\nStories from Swans last book, Stupid Boys are Good to Relax With (1966), were excerpted in the Fall 1996 issues of Granta and Ms. The story collection is a lively look at short-term relationships partly set in cyberspace. It was selected as a best title of the week by Entertainment Weekly.\n\nOne of her novels, The last of the Golden Girls (1989), broke new ground in the treatment of female sexuality, prompting some readers to send her flowers, while two listeners who heard her reading an excerpt on CBC radio tried to file obscenity charges against her.\n\nHer first novel, The Biggest Modern Woman of the World, which is being made into a film, is the story of a Nova Scotian giantess who exhibited with P. T. Barnum. It was a finalist for a Governor General's Award.\n\nPIERRE GILL (Director of photography)\n\nPierre Gill is a much sought after Quebec cinematographer. He is the director of photography for Lost and Delirious.\n\nAfter graduating from Concordia University, he began filming advertisements and videos. He went on to work on short films, including Mitsou en forme and La La La Human Steps, both in 1993.\n\nHe has frequently collaborated with the director Charles Binamé, contributing for two years to his television series Marguerite Volante (1995-96). He has served as director of photography on three of Binamés feature films: Eldorado (1994), Le Coeur au Poing (1997), and Le Beauté de Pandore (1999).\n\nIn 1997 he worked on several episodes of the Showtime series The Hunger.
