        "text": "Rideau Hall, Monday, March 31, 2014\n\nCheck against delivery\n\nMy wife, Sharon, and I are delighted to welcome you to Rideau Hall this evening in celebration of Robert Lepage-a truly remarkable Canadian artist and visionary.\n\nI think it is fitting that we gather here for this tenth presentation of the Glenn Gould Prize, which is such a wonderful expression of our country's standing as a hub of creativity.\n\nThe arts permeate Rideau Hall. In fact, one of Glenn Gould's pianos sits in the Long Gallery just beyond those doors. It's a 1934 Steinway grand, and we even have the bench he used while playing!\n\nAnd, if you're wondering: yes, the piano is tuned, and it's there to be played!\n\nOne of the things I most cherish about it is that it was Glenn Gould's practice piano. He may well have been a musical genius, but that doesn't mean he didn't spend countless hours seated at the piano, honing his craft, practising.\n\nI find the thought inspiring, and I know that Robert Lepage, our laureate this evening, has similarly dedicated a great deal of his life to mastering his art.\n\nMy predecessor, John Buchan, was a strong believer in the importance of celebrating our highest peaks of artistic excellence. The great masterpieces, he said, \"enshrine things permanent and universal. They have a largeness and rightness, both in thought and style…they dignify life because they link it with the eternal. They make the world at once more solemn and more sunny, brighter and more spacious.\"\n\nI think you will agree that all of the above readily applies to Mr. Lepage's remarkable artistry.\n\nThe Glenn Gould Prize recognizes a lifetime's artistic achievement and is open to any artist worldwide. Mr. Lepage is a most worthy recipient on both counts, having become one of the world's most respected, acclaimed and original artists over the past 30 years.\n\nThe recipient of many honours, Mr. Lepage is a companion of the Order of Canada and winner of the Governor General's Performing Arts Award. He has captivated audiences worldwide as a stage and film director, a playwright and an actor.\n\nHis versatility and the variety of his creative output are truly impressive. Can you name any other artist whose register ranges from Wagner's Ring Cycle to Cirque du Soleil to Peter Gabriel?!\n\nHe is renowned for staging massive spectacles, such as the half-kilometre-wide sound and light show held to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the founding of Québec.\n\nBut he has also put on smaller, more intimate performances that seem to speak to us on a one-on-one level.\n\nMr. Lepage is also rightly celebrated for his innovative use of technology in the service of art, an approach he shares with the late Glenn Gould and which makes him a particularly apt recipient of this prize.\n\nThe performing arts are by nature collaborative, and Mr. Lepage also has a reputation as a kind and generous collaborator who brings out the best in those with whom he works.\n\nI would also like to make a special mention of his profound impact upon emerging generations of artists. On that note, I am delighted that Mr. Lepage has chosen L'Orchestre d'hommes-orchestres as the recipient of The City of Toronto Protégé Prize.\n\nTonight at Rideau Hall we celebrate one of Canada's and the world's great artistic talents. I am looking forward to performances and tributes from a number of artists whose admiration for Robert Lepage runs deep.\n\nMy thanks to all of you for being here to make this evening so special.\n\nI would also like to thank the supporters of the Glenn Gould Foundation for your commitment to creativity and artistic excellence.\n\nAnd thank you, Mr. Lepage, for your passion and dedication. You have made a singular contribution to our cultural life and imagination.\n\nCongratulations on receiving this wonderful and well-deserved honour."
