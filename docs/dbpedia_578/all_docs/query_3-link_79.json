This weekend, McCamus will add Winnipeg filmmaker Jeff Erbach to that list. Erbach is currently filming his first The Nature of Nicholas in and around the city and McCamus has dropped by to fill a small role. The veteran stage and screen actor says his interest in the part came simply from reading and enjoying Erbach's script, which tells of a young boy named Nicholas and the difficulties he experiences going through puberty. \"Jeff called me and asked me if I'd be interested,\" he says. \"I just thought it was different. I like things that are a little out of the ordinary and this is kind of like that.\"\n\nMcCamus plays Nicholas's dead dad. \"A ghost father that doesn't quite know how to talk to his son,\" says McCamus. He says he'll spend a good part of the weekend walking on gravel looking pale and sporting longish greasy hair and an air force His character can't but speaks through others by putting his hand in their He's kind of an odd says the was born in Winnipeg and moved to when he was He's enjoying the idea of spending a few days here working on a movie about boys growing up on the I have lots of little kid memories he So it's been a neat The last time McCamus worked in he was onstage in the Manitoba Theatre Centre's 1993 production of Dancing at He's undoubtedly been a busy guy The actor has been in countless stage shows at the Shaw with Toronto's Soulpepper Theatre and Theatre Plus and at the Stratford Festival and he's also been in countless He won a Genie for his role in I Love a Man in Uniform 1993 and was nominated twice more for A Long Days Journey Into Night and The Sweet Hereafter.

Leading the cast are Jeff Sutton, David Turnball, Ardith Boxall and Tom McCamus, the lone non-Manitoban in the cast (although born in Winnipeg), who plays Nicholas’ dead father. Peeler says the film should be ready for delivery in January and he is currently searching for a distributor.\n\n© Playback\n\nExcerpt from Take One 3/02: Tom McCamus\n\nJeff Erbach (Soft Like Me, Under Chad Valley) is finishing up post—production on his creepy new feature, The Nature of Nicholas, using the same sound—editing team Guy Maddin used on Twilight of the Ice Nymphs: Russ Dyck (creator of the legendary Joe 90) and highly respected audio artist Ken Gregory, here working as a sound—effects editor.\n\n....\n\nFormer Winnipegger Tom McCamus (Possible Worlds) plays the role of Nicholas's father.\n\n© Take One\n\nExcerpt from Domino Film 8/02: Tom McCamus\n\nDOMINO FILM presents THE NATURE OF NICHOLAS\n\nA stunning feature set on the Canadian Prairie, THE NATURE OF NICHOLAS is the tale of a young boy wrestling with an attraction to his best friend and tormented by the ghost of his father. Twelve-year-old Nicholas is the focus of this unique coming-of-age story about the tumult of nascent sexuality and a boy’s struggle to reconcile his desire with what is expected of him.\n\n....\n\nTOM McCAMUS as Father Portraying the father in THE NATURE OF NICHOLAS brought Tom back to the place he was born. Tom lived in Winnipeg, Manitoba until he was 10 years old, at which time the family moved to London, Ontario. The veteran stage actor is a long-standing member of the Shaw and Stratford Festivals and has received the Dora Mavor Moore Award for Best Actor for his performance in Theatre Plus’ production of ABUNDANCE. Tom has received tremendous acclaim for his work in film. He won a Best Actor Genie Award in 1993 for his role in I LOVE A MAN IN UNIFORM (IRS Media) and was nominated twice more for A LONG DAY’S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT (Rhombus Media) in 1996 and THE SWEET HEREAFTER (Alliance/Atlantis) in 1997. Tom’s latest work includes starring, along with Sarah Polley, in THE CLAIM (United Artists), with Tilda Swinton in Robert LePage’s POSSIBLE WORLDS (Alliance Atlantis) and alongside Mia Kirshner, Chantel Kreviazuk and Raine Maida in CENTURY HOTEL (TVA), which premiered at Toronto’s International Film Festival. Tom recently returned from the Edinburgh Fringe Festival where he performed in the one-man show, NOVECENTO, directed by François Girard. His television credits include the series MUTANT X (Global), and FOREIGN OBJECTS (CBC), as well as THE PASSION OF AYN RAND (Showtime), TWITCH CITY (CBC), F/X: THE SERIES (CTV), WIND AT MY BACK (CBC) and DUE SOUTH (CTV). Tom says his interest in THE NATURE OF NICHOLAS came simply from reading and enjoying writer/director Jeff Erbach’s script. “Jeff called me and asked if I’d be interested. I like things that are different and thought this would be fun because it’s a little out of the ordinary. It’s a strange piece where no one really knows exactly who or what I am, and I get to play in the reality of the moment portraying an odd kind of guy.”\n\nTom had no problem working with his preteen co-stars, calling them wonderful kids. “They’re born to pretend and still like to play, which creates a great working atmosphere.” Tom and his wife recently bought a 54-acre farm outside of Toronto and are spending their spare time renovating and enjoying rural Ontario life. This summer he is taking the lead roles in RICHARD III and THE THREEPENNY OPERA at Stratford.\n\n© Domino Film\n\nExcerpt from Take One 9/1/02: Tom McCamus\n\nJeff Erbach's The Nature of Nicholas: repressed desire and macabre acts.\n\nFirst, Nicholas has a vision of his recently departed father (Tom McCamus).\n\n....\n\nPerhaps they will recoil in horror at the sight of McCamus sticking his hand in surgical incisions to use other characters as ventriloquial dummies.\n\ncopy; Take One\n\nExcerpt from Variety 9/2/02: Tom McCamus\n\nThe Nature of Nicholas (Canada)\n\nBy DENNIS HARVEY\n\nA Full Stop Films production in association with Telefilm Canada, Manitoba Film & Sound Development, Showcase Television and the Movie Network. Produced by Len Pendergast, Jeff Peeler. Executive producer, Andrew Koster. Directed, written by Jeff Erbach.\n\nNicholas - Jeff Sutton\n\nBobby - David Turnbull\n\nMother - Ardith Boxall\n\nFather - Tom McCamus\n\nRoy - Robert Huculak\n\nJenna - Katherine Lee Raymond\n\nVicki - Samantha Hill\n\nReminiscent of the late-1980's Brit cult pics \"Paperhouse\" and \"The Reflecting Skin\" in its disturbing union of misfit-childhood drama with metaphorical horror and surrealist elements, \"The Nature of Nicholas\" reps an accomplished if not entirely satisfying feature debut for Winnipeg writer-director Jeff Erbach. Bizarre yet low-key pic's unclassifiable character will make arthouse outreach challenging (though still possible). Regardless, effort merits further fest showcasing, and could attract a dedicated fan base over the long haul while helmer moves on to bigger projects.\n\nSet in a vaguely late-'50s/early-'60s rural milieu, story centers on the awkward pubescence of sixth grader Nicholas (Jeff Sutton), whose pilot father died in a crash some time before. That event left a huge gap in the lives of both son and mother (Ardith Boxall), and mom is distressed that her only child seems to be growing more remote.\n\nNicholas' sole friend is athletic Bobby (David Turnbull), who's beginning to notice girls. That terrain as yet holds little interest for Nicholas, though he duly plays along with a spin-the-bottle groping game at a basement party. His feelings toward Bobby are more intense by far, and may be nudging toward the sexual.\n\nBut Nicholas doesn't understand those urges yet, any more than he does the phantom appearances of a ghost-dad (Tom McCamus) whom no one else sees -- and who occasionally voices encouraging words via the unsettling device of sticking medical pincers through people's spines and speaking \"through\" them, ventriloquist-style.\n\n....\n\nJuvenile performers are superbly handled, though their dialogue sometimes grows a tad too mature. Adult thesps, all more or less unknown save familiar face McCamus, are equally fine -- Boxall is excellent as a retro model housewife (complete with Jello for dessert) visibly frazzled by her child's increasing secrecy.\n\n© Variety\n\nExcerpt from Nature of Nicholas 11/21/03: Tom McCamus\n\nErbach's Nature creepy & sweet\n\nBy PAT ST. GERMAIN\n\nA creepy ghost dad, bizarre gore, zombies -- it all adds up to a curiously sweet coming-of-age tale in Jeff Erbach's debut feature The Nature of Nicholas.\n\nSet in a small prairie town in the '50s, local writer/director Erbach's quirky take on the perplexities of puberty follows 12-year-old Nicholas (Jeff Sutton) over the course of a summer as he struggles with an amourous attraction to his best friend Bobby (David Turnbull).\n\n....\n\nThen, we have Nicholas's dead father (Tom McCamus). A macho airman whose place Nicholas is presumably expected to take in the home -- the mother actually replaces a framed photo of him with a picture of Nicholas -- the dad begins showing up in strangest places, including what we take to be Roy's nether regions.\n\nWielding bloody dissecting instruments, the dad temporarily hijacks Roy's and other ancillary characters' bodies, through which he then directly communicates with Nicholas -- in effect confirming any paranoid illusions Nicholas may have that everybody knows what he's thinking about Bobby. Kid, we have all been there.\n\n© Canoe.ca"
