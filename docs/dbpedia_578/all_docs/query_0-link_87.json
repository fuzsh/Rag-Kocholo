        "text": "Jagged Little Pill\n\nBroadhurst Theater\n\nHalfway Bitches Go Straight to Heaven\n\nAtlantic Theater Company and LAByrinth Theater Company at Linda Gross Theater\n\nA Bright Room Called Day\n\nPublic Theater\n\nReviewed by David Sheward\n\nThe cast of Jagged Little Pill\n\nPhoto by Matthew Murphy\n\nJagged Little Pill is a jagged little musical, sometimes smooth, sometimes sharp, sometimes bland and predictable, sometimes edgy and shattering. This raw, uneven tale of modern angst in an upper-class Connecticut family employs Alanis Morissette’s groundbreaking 1995 album for its score. Tom Kitt did the skillful arrangements and orchestrations, combining Broadway smoothness with Morissette’s signature prickly texture. Her rage-filled tone informs the polished and funny book by Diablo Cody (Juno) who has crammed in so many current social issues it feels like a rock version of an Afterschool Special. We skip from opioid addiction to rape culture to marital miscommunication to bisexuality to racial identity with barely a pause for a breath, let alone a few minutes for reflection or analysis. Even climate change gets a brief mention. Fortunately Cody infuses wit and pathos into her fast-forward preachiness, and director Diane Paulus creates a inventive, surprising staging so that you don’t feel numbed by the constant crises.\n\nThe show opens with a chorus of refreshingly diverse dancers throwing themselves into Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui’s frenetic, all-body choreography. Then we meet the white-bread Healys who have a lot going on. Supermom Mary Jane (a steely and shattering Elizabeth Stanley) is addicted to painkillers and bent on presenting a perfect facade. Dad Steve (handsome Sean Allen Krill skillfully hiding pain) is constantly at the office, sneaking peeks at Internet porn and avoiding the cracks in family life. Daughter Frankie (full-voiced and mature Celia Rose Gooding), who is African-American and adopted, feels pressured to conceal her emerging racial awareness and bisexuality. Straight-arrow son Nick (expressive Derek Klena) has been accepted to Harvard but feels empty inside.\n\nThe lead characters’ barrage of woes gets a bit tiring. The stories of Jo, Frankie’s secret girlfriend, and Bella, Nick’s classmate who is sexually assaulted at a party, emerge as more compelling. Lauren Patten’s Jo is funny, scathing, razor-sharp, and achingly human. She literally stops the show cold with her gut-wrenching rendition of “You Oughta Know,” Morissette’s breakup cry of pain. Kathryn Gallagher is equally memorable as the tormented Bella. To paraphrase one of Morissette’s hits, it’s ironic that the supporting figures are the real stars here. As noted, Paulus gives us numerous dazzling sequences, particularly a heartbreaking backwards-in-time journey through Mary Jane’s day as she adds scoring illegal drugs to her shopping chores. Pill indeed has its jagged edges, but it’s ultimately a satisfying capsule.\n\nThe Healys of Jagged Little Pill are confronting a plethora of problems, but they’re having a day at the beach compared to the crowd at Halfway Bitches Go Straight to Heaven Off-Broadway at the Atlantic Theater Company. Stephen Adly Guirgis’s new super-sized comedy-drama contains a stageful of characters—the huge cast numbers 18, a rarity for a straight play on or Off-Broadway—each exploding with his or her own trauma. We are in a women’s halfway housing shelter (Narelle Sissons designed the appropriately crumbling set), and as with the Healys, a lot is going on. Sarge, a lesbian army vet, is furious that transgender prostitute Venus is taking a bed that should go to a “real woman.” Sarge’s girlfriend, Bella, a stripper from Baltimore, wants a normal life, but Sarge’s alcoholism and anger issues keep getting in the way. Former dancer Wanda, now confined to a wheelchair, refuses to take her medication. Rockaway Rosie still mourns the rejection of her fiancé who stole her life savings hidden in a bucket of detergent. Betty refuses to take a bath. Teenagers Melba and Mateo just want to get through high school. Father Miguel and Miss Rivera attempt to run the place, but their own nerves are starting to fray as pressure mounts to close the place. And that’s just a sampling of the multiple goings-on.\n\nAs he has done with his numerous previous works—including Our Lady of 121st Street, The Motherf—r with the Hat, and the Pulitzer Prize–winning Between Riverside and Crazy—Adly Guirgis solidly delivers a brutally honest depiction of vital, struggling people on the edge who speak in hilarious, profanity-laced slang. The script is a riot, but there are so many plot threads and characters that despite John Ortiz’s controlled, muscular direction and stellar performances from the entire company (particularly Elizabeth Canavan’s addled, endearing Rosie; Patrice Johnson Chevannes’s regal Wanda, Liza Colon-Zayas’s hair-trigger yet vulnerable Sarge, and Elizabeth Rodriguez’s fierce Miss Rivera), it’s nearly impossible to keep them all straight. In addition, the author doesn’t fully develop some of characters or resolve their stories. Towards the end of two hours and 45 minutes of nudity, drug abuse, assaults, stabbings, backroom sex, and a visit from a live goat, one of the characters emerges with a baby she hasn’t even mentioned heretofore.\n\nDespite its excesses, Halfway Bitches is an entertaining, frightening ride, and its nearly three-hour running time is never dull. The same cannot be said for the Public Theater’s revival of Tony Kushner’s A Bright Room Called Day. This 1985 work was Kushner’s first and definitely shows the sparks of genius later responsible for Angels in America, but it’s also overlong, talky, and still doesn’t entirely work in theatrical terms in spite of revisions by Kushner for this production. (Day was workshopped off-Off-Broadway in 1985. Its professional premiere was in 1987 at San Francisco’s Eureka Theatre. The Public presented the first Off-Broadway production in 1990.)\n\nSet in Germany during the early 1930s, Day follows a group of progressive intellectuals as they ineffectually cope with the rise of Hitler. Sometime actor Agnes (brilliantly conflicted Nikki M. James) seeks to avoid confrontation and action, hoping the Nazi regime will blow over. Her Hungarian lover Husz (fiery Michael Esper) and Communist activist Annabella (solid Linda Emond) advocate revolution. Fellow actor Paulinka (sleek Grace Gummer) and gay chum Gregor (vital Michel Urie) escape the pending disaster by smoking opium and pursuing anonymous sex, respectively. In addition, Agnes’s surprisingly well-appointed flat (the room of the title, beautifully realized by designer David Rockwell) is visited by a mysterious old woman representing hunger and complacency (Estelle Parsons, still powerful at 92) and the devil himself in the person of a vulgar middle-class merchant (commandingly crude Mark Margolis).\n\nThe basic structure is compelling enough with Der Führer’s power grab detailed by menacing supertitles and images (Lucy MacKinnon’s projection design and Bray Poor’s sound design create a harrowing atmosphere). But in the original production, Kushner added a figure from 1985 named Zillah to draw parallels between the action of the play and Ronald Reagan’s shift of America toward the right. This awkward imposition drew the most criticism, and now Kushner has added a second interrupter called Xillah, a stand-in for the author himself, making further commentary and obvious connections among Hitler, Reagan, and the current occupant of the White House. Though Crystal Lucas-Perry’s Zillah and Jonathan Hadary’s Xillah are movingly played and the dialogue Kushner gives them is sometimes fascinatingly astute political observation, these characters slow down the action and drain the proceedings of drama. When they come on, the emphasis changes from frightening life-or-death decisions to dry seminar. Oskar Eustis, who directed the 1987 Eureka Theater production, gives this difficult, uneven work the best possible production, intensely human and paced with variety and wit. But, unlike the similarly overstuffed Jagged Little Pill and Halfway Bitches, Day is ultimately unsatisfying.\n\nDecember 10, 2019\n\nJagged Little Pill: Opened Dec 5 for an open run.

The Boys in the Band, Torch Song Trilogy, Love! Valour! Compassion!, and Angels in America have defined their respective gay moment and how the general society is reacting to it. Matthew Lopez’s The Inheritance is the latest theatrical chronicle of the American gay journey. The massive work checks all the right boxes for a certifiable hit: a smash production in London complete with Olivier Awards; glowing reviews and snob appeal; an epic two-evening running time of more than seven hours; a fluid, funny, clever production from director Stephen Daldry; and moving, intense performances. The play itself, inspired by Howard’s End, E.M. Forster’s classic novel of connection and redemption, is a mixed bag of brilliant moments of pathos, insight, and observation, as well as extraneous, melodramatic, and forced scenes.\n\nLopez does not slavishly adhere to Forster’s original text of Edwardian class conflict in pre–World War I England. He used the plot template of the liberal Schlegel sisters and their interactions with the conservative, ultra-rich Wilcox clan to explore where we are as a culture and how gay men have adjusted to the aftermath of the AIDS crisis, marriage equality, and the resurgence of a homophobic political agenda from the right. There is much to savor here, but there are plenty of bumps and rough stretches along the way.\n\nThe play begins simply, then Lopez and Daldry skillfully develop and build the perspective into a deeper, more complex view. The casually dressed cast is seated around Bob Crowley’s bare set, scribbling in notebooks as if in a creative writing class. A figure dressed in 1910s style (Crowley also designed the subtly appropriate costumes) emerges. This is Forster (played with elegant understatement by Paul Hilton) offering his advice to the next generation of gays on constructing their narrative. The actors address the audience, finishing each other’s sentences, and tell the fraught story of empathetic political activist Eric (wonderfully sincere Kyle Soller) and self-destructive writer Toby (overacting Andrew Burnap), a couple whose connection parallels the battle between self-love and self-deprecation many gay men endure. There are a plethora of subplots, but the central thread concerns the duo’s relationship to the wealthy, covetous Henry Wilcox (solid and shaded John Benjamin Hickey) and his more compassionate partner Walter Poole (also played by Hilton). Also figuring prominently are narcissistic actor Adam and pathetic hustler Leo, both enacted with precision and variety by Samuel H. Levine.\n\nFor every emotionally impactful punch, such as the devastating Part One finale where Eric encounters the ghosts of AIDS victims in a parade of stolen lives, there is a superfluous segment such as an endless debate on the values of camp. Another example is cameo, late in Part Two, of the only female character, Margaret. Though her monologue recounting the death of her son from AIDS is shatteringly written and sensitively played by the magnificent Lois Smith, it does not convey any new information or insight, and the character feels tossed in out of left field. None of the minor characters is fully developed, and Toby’s long spiral downward after achieving success with a supposedly autobiographical novel and play is melodramatic and over-the-top, particularly as played by the hyperventilating Burnap. Yet, Inheritance’s strengths outweigh its shortcomings, and Daldry’s well-paced, versatile staging makes the marathon length fly by.\n\nHorton Foote’s The Young Man From Atlanta, now playing Off-Broadway at the Signature Theater, also examines gay characters, though only peripherally and through a totally different lens. Premiered in 1995 at Signature and revived on Broadway in 1997, this Pulitzer Prize winner reflects the attitude toward gays of the era of its setting (Houston in 1950). The queer figures are not even onstage, one of them has committed suicide, and they are only important in how they affect straight people.\n\nThe main struggle is that of bragging businessman Will Kidder (bluff but vulnerable Aidan Quinn) and his flighty, sweet wife Lily Dale (simultaneously tragic and comic Kristin Nielsen). Several months after the mysterious death of their only son, Bill, they are confronted by the unwelcome visit of the title character, Randy, Bill’s much younger roommate. Will does not want to see Randy, but Lily Dale craves his company as a reminder of her child. While the words gay, queer, and homosexual are never even spoken and Randy remains offstage, it’s clear he and Bill were in a relationship, and neither parent can face the truth. This unmentionable secret is but one of many problems confronting the Kidders. Will loses his job just as they move into an expensive new home (Jeff Cowie created the period-perfect suburban 1950s set) along with Lily Dale’s stepfather, Pete (subtly tender Stephen Payne).\n\nThe play has clunky structural problems. The first scene is all exposition with Will pouring his life story out to a young co-worker (Dan Bittner). Later, Pete’s great-nephew Carson (Jon Orsini), who just happened to be living in the same Atlanta boarding house as Bill and Randy, conveniently comes to call. But like The Inheritance, the production overcomes the script’s flaws. Young Man honestly examines American middle-class mores of equating wealth with happiness and unflinchingly rips away the prosperous facade of the couple’s elegant existence as they must confront economic and emotional reality. Michael Wilson, who has helmed many previous Foote plays including the epic The Orphans’ Home Cycle, delivers a heartfelt, straightforward staging with an impeccable and moving cast capturing the quiet desperation of Foote’s lonely family, detached from their gay son.\n\nDecember 3, 2019\n\nThe Inheritance: Nov 17–March 1.

The title refers to countries’ gaining world dominance through cultural influence rather than military hardware and muscle flexing. Hwang’s hilariously satiric and complex book also addresses the 2016 election, ethnic stereotyping, romantic comedies, musical theater conventions, hate crimes, and China’s relationship with the US. Yeah, it’s a lot to take in, but the creators and their inventive director Leigh Silverman address all of these issues and more in a fast-paced, funny, yet deep concoction that, unlike most musicals, actually makes you think while it entertains you.\n\nThe inspiration comes from an actual horrific event that occurred to Hwang. On the morning after Donald Trump’s presidential triumph, the playwright was stabbed in the neck by an unknown assailant. (The case still has not been solved.) In the musical’s alternate universe, an Asian-American playwright referred to as DHH is recruited by Xue Xang, a Shanghai-based producer, to write a splashy musical based on a popular Chinese rom-com. The author and entrepreneur clash over American and Chinese attitudes toward romance and marriage. During the course of their collaboration, they attend a fundraising performance of The King and I for presidential candidate and presumptive winner Hillary Clinton. The unexpected results of the election lead DHH and Xang to question their future in America. Then Hwang is stabbed and the rest of the show is a musical-within-in-a-musical combining elements of the film-based script DHH was working on, references to The King and I, a liaison between Clinton and Xang, and pointed, uncomfortable observations on our political system and cultural stereotypes.\n\nIn the most unconventional, bracing choice, Asian performers flip the script and, with one exception (that of the actress playing Hillary), play all the white roles. This parodies the convention of white actors playing Asian roles and introduces various clichés about America, turning the tables on New York audiences as they see how we are viewed from abroad. The Golden Gate Bridge is in New York, all US citizens are armed to the teeth, and MacDonald’s is the height of dining sophistication. Hwang’s book hilariously blends these tropes with his deadly serious barbs on how we elect our officials. Tesori's versatile score mixes Broadway sounds from both the Sondheim and Rodgers and Hammerstein eras, as well as rap, hip-hop, country-western, Asian, and the blues.\n\nConrad Ricamora makes for a virile, attractive leading man as Xue, while Alyse Alan Louis creates an intensely human Hillary Clinton who is both political cartoon and idealistic woman. As DHH, Francis Jue skillfully leads us through this hall of mirrors, with spiky supporting turns from Jon Hoche, Austin Ku, Raymond J. Lee, Kendyl Ito, and the rest of the versatile ensemble. Set designer Clint Ramos creates a wacky caricature world, and Anita Yavich’s costumes are as humorous as the relevant, dangerously funny script and score.\n\nSpeaking of theater based on real life political events, Tina Satter’s Is This a Room at the Vineyard goes even further than Soft Power into meta territory. The entire text is composed of a transcript of FBI agents questioning a former Air Force linguist named Reality Winner in 2017. She was interrogated in her own home and then charged with leaking classified government information on Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election. In 70 tense minutes, Satter and a quartet of actors transform Parker Lutz’s bare set into a chamber of intimidation and fear. Lee Kinney and Sanae Yamada’s metallic sound design re-creating the aural landscape of a tape recording adds to the eerie, otherworldly atmosphere.\n\nReality’s defenses crumble as the agents casually chat about her pets, the groceries she’s carrying (she is just returning from the supermarket), and her workout routines. Her personal space grows smaller and smaller as her questioners take over her home, move closer into her domain, and eventually corner her in a tiny space for her cat and dog (hence the title). The subject of the documents is not even directly mentioned, and, whenever it comes up, the lights black out and sound designers Kinney and Yamada provide an ominous boom representing a redaction. Context would help somewhat (there are explanations in the program), but Satter is after creating a mood of tension and fear and exploring how authority figures by their very presence can easily instill panic.\n\nAt first it seemed to me the name Reality Winner was an ironic code name to protect the woman’s identity, but it is in fact her real moniker, and, as of this writing, she is still serving a prison sentence. Emily Davis subtly conveys Reality’s reality, her shrinking self-esteem and confidence, and the importance of the subtextual details of her life as they are taken from her. Pete Simpson, TL Thompson, and Becca Blackwell underplay the authority and power of the agents, but still impart a sense of intimidation and menace. Room is more about tone and feelings than story. It may be brief and lacking in plot, but it definitely leaves you shaken and rattled.\n\nFor a more uplifting true politically themed story, hightail it over to City Center for Manhattan Theater Club’s intimate production of Bella Bella, written by and starring Harvey Fierstein as the late firebrand Bella Abzug, directed with economy and verve by Kimberly Senior. Set in 1976 as she awaits the results of her Democratic primary run for US Senator from New York—she eventually lost to Daniel Patrick Moynihan—this funny and moving solo show retraces Abzug’s career from crusading lawyer to one of the few women in the US House of Representatives to feminist icon. Employing the subject’s own writings, Fierstein lovingly creates a portrait of strength and humor. There is no attempt at imitation or cross-dressing. Costume designer Rita Ryack dresses the actor in gender-neutral pajamas. But Fierstein captures the essence of Abzug’s spirit. Given his history of fighting for and creating positive gay roles, it doesn’t feel odd that he is playing a woman breaking barriers for her gender. John Lee Beatty’s stylish hotel bathroom set becomes a political platform, lecturer’s rostrum, standup-comedy stage, and storyteller’s cozy corner in Fierstein’s capable hands.\n\nDecember 3, 2019\n\nSoft Power: Oct 15–Nov 17.

The holiday outing arrives on Broadway after a hit run in London. Lighting designer Hugh Vanstone has created a warm 19th-century glow aided by lit candles throughout the theater. Patrons are greeted by cheerful staffers dressed in period costumes offering free cookies and clementine oranges. Cast members and musicians stroll onstage and play traditional yuletide favorites. The atmosphere is comfy and cozy for the beloved tale of the cold-hearted Ebenezer Scrooge and his redemption by a gaggle of benevolent ghosts, told with new shadings and vigor.\n\nThere have been so many iterations of this tale it’s difficult to imagine a new way of telling it. From the gold standard of the 1951 Alastair Sim film version to multiple musical variations to countess cartoons and parodies, Scrooge is part of our collective Christmas consciousness. Director Matthew Warchus and playwright Jack Thorne, who won a Tony for updating another legendary British icon in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, meet the challenge by adding to the misanthropic miser’s complexity and building a frighteningly justifiable case for his tight-fistedness.\n\nSounding like a Trumpian capitalist, Campbell Scott as Scrooge mounts a steely resistance against the pleas of Jacob Marley and his fellow spirits for the old skinflint to put humanity before money. Scott, whose father George C. also played the role in a memorable 1984 made-for-TV movie, is a much younger and more vital Scrooge than usual. He’s not a caricature of inhumanity but a twisted soul battered down by the economic brutalities of his age. His metamorphosis into a cheery old soul is all the more miraculous for his convincing and subtle portrayal of the character’s grinchiness. Thorne also adds details to the character’s oppressive family life and blighted romance with the strong-willed, idealistic Belle (fierce and fine Sarah Hunt). There is much symbolism, and the specter of death is ever present. Scrooge’s first employer Fezziwig (an effervescent Evan Harrington) is now an undertaker.\n\nThe script hits the nail on the head a bit too much and could use some cutting. The intermission is unnecessary and some of Thorne’s additions feel extraneous. But Warchus’s quick paced, jovial staging counters the weightiness of Thorne’s expansion on Dickens’s taut original with a lighthearted holiday sprit and spooky effects, augmented by Rob Howell’s versatile set and Vanstone’s spectral lighting. There’s a great deal of audience involvement, which adds to the running time but not to the entertainment. One sequence involving the theatergoers passing food onto the stage for the Crachit family feast goes on too long.\n\nThe ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are not their traditional templates of holiday cutouts but variations on Scrooge’s dead little sister Fan, all similarly costumed by Howell. Each pushes a baby carriage that eventually evolves into a coffin.\n\nAs Christmas Past, Andrea Martin displays her customary dry wit (she hilariously goes “Boo” when introducing herself as a ghost). LaChanze make Christmas Present a stern West Indian taskmaster who will put up with none of Scrooge’s nonsense. Rachel Prather transforms the usually horrifying Christmas Future into a benevolent promise of hope. Chris Hoch provides the appropriate gnarled nastiness as Scrooge’s unloving father and a truly frightening reminder of what Scrooge could become as Marley’s Ghost (tethered to the underworld by an endless chain in Howell’s otherworldly costume). This is altogether a wondrous Carol celebrating the spirit of the season and the magic of theater.\n\nDavid Byrne’s American Utopia is another celebratory theater event unusual for Broadway. The former front man for Talking Heads and a genius-level solo artist, Byrne presents an intoxicating hybrid of rock concert, dance program, and howlingly fun party. Audience members at the performance attended had no hesitation to stand and dance in the aisles to “The Road to Nowhere,” “Once in a Lifetime,” and the ultimate shake-your-booty inducer “Burning Down the House.”\n\nByrne, in remarkable shape and voice at 67, is accompanied by a stageful of international instrumentalists, mostly percussionists, and two charismatic backup singers (Daniel Freedman and Tenda Yi Kuumba), creating finger-snapping, infectious music. All are barefoot and dressed in identical grey suits. Choreographer Annie-B Parson’s stylized movement and patterns of staging lend variety and eccentricity to each number. Alex Timbers, who collaborated with Byrne on the immersive musical Here Lies Love, is listed as production consultant, so it’s difficult to judge where his contribution begins and Parson’s ends. The storyless concert is stitched together by Byrne’s commentary and his desire for connection between the ordinary world and the vibrant spirit that binds us together. It’s a fun evening, even if you’re not a Byrne-head.\n\nNovember 27, 2019\n\nA Christmas Carol: Nov 20–Jan 5. Lyceum Theater, 149 W 45th St, NYC.

In addition to collaborating with all the top names of the music world in his decades-long career, he bravely took a stance against fascism in his native Italy and in Nazi Germany, leaving Europe in the late 1930s to lead the NBC Orchestra and bring the classics into millions of American homes over the radio waves. Plus, a recent discovery of a cache of letters offers a glimpse into his intimate life, particularly a long-term affair with the pianist Ada Colleone Mainardi. Unfortunately, Maestro, a strange combination of solo show and concert presented by Ensemble for the Romantic Century, is not that work.\n\nPlaywright Eve Wolf, the company’s executive artistic director, stitches together excerpts from the newly discovered letters with performances by a sterling ensemble of musicians of memorable pieces Toscanini conducted. The framing device is a 1938 rehearsal where the conductor displays his legendary temper at the NBC Orchestra (the audience), then recounts how he got to this celebrated position. Actor John Noble bears a striking resemblance to the subject, and he imparts some of Toscanini’s renowned passion for his music, but we do not see much of the man beyond histrionics and pining for Mainardi, who remained in Germany while Hitler was in power. Noble delivers a mostly one-note performance, varying little from angry rants. Wolf’s script doesn’t tell us much about Toscanini’s artistry, and Donald T. Saunders’s direction is sluggish.\n\nBut the real heart of Maestro is the glittering professionalism of its musicians, particularly pianist Zhenni Li, who gives brilliant life and fingering to Wagner’s “Liebestod” and Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue.” The latter also provides a magnificent solo for trumpeter Maximilian Morel, who wrote the special arrangement for this glorious piece evocative of 1930s Manhattan. David Bengali’s imaginative projections create striking images to accompany the sublime sounds. Ironically, the climax of the first act and that of the show itself are marked by musical performances with Noble as the main character offstage. This tells us the music, and not the actor or the script, is the center of this show.\n\nFebruary 6, 2019\n\nJan 15–Feb 9.

Eschewing passionate arias where the divas pour out every thought and motive for their extreme actions, this mysterious love triangle is all recitative with inner feelings largely unexpressed in words. The music does that, exquisitely conducted at the Metropolitan Opera by new music director Yannick Nézet-Séguin. Those yearning for a splashy solo will be disappointed. The music is delicate and subtle, requiring careful attention. When it opened in Paris in 1902, some critics found it “sickly and practically lifeless.” But there are contemplative joys to be found in its nuances and complex melodies. The Metropolitan Opera’s revival of Jonathan Miller’s 1995 production (restaged by Paula Williams) takes its time to establish an emotional connection among characters, music and audience, but by the third act a mystical spell has been woven.\n\nThe plot, based on Maurice Maeterlinck’s symbolic, anti-naturalistic stage play, has been seen a million times before and since. The title lovers engage in forbidden flirting though the innocent young Mélisande is married to the elder brother of the impetuous Pélleas. Suffice it to say things do not end well. Miller has transported the setting from a medieval milieu to a ruined early 20th-century castle, replete with covered furniture and crumbling statues. (The eerie sets and period costumes are by John Conklin and Clare Mitchell, respectively.)\n\nPaul Appleby and Isabel Leonard give lyrically beautiful renditions of the titular sweethearts—their Act III duet is soaringly sublime—but the show is stolen by Kyle Ketelsen as Golaud, Pélleas’s gruff sibling and Mélisande’s possessive husband. While the principal swooners display limited character development, Golaud goes through a full spectrum of emotions from enchantment with his waif-like bride to jealous rage to gut-wrenching remorse. Ketelsen gives full voice and color to these varied passions with his rich bass-baritone. Ferruccio Furlanetto provides girder-like support and a rumbling tone to the aging king Arkel and Marie-Nicole Lemieux is a warm Geneviève, mother to the battling siblings.\n\nPelléas et Mélisande may not be for every opera fan, but those willing to listen to its sweetly seductive charms will be rewarded.\n\nJanuary 27, 2019\n\nJan 15–Jan 31. Metropolitan Opera, 30 Lincoln Center Plaza, Broadway at 66th St., NYC. Remaining performance: Jan 31, 7:30pm. Running time 4 hours, including two intermissions. $30–$445.

Friedman Theatre\n\nSlave Play\n\nNew York Theatre Workshop\n\nReviewed by David Sheward\n\nThe cast of Choir Boy\n\nPhoto by Matthew Murphy\n\nYou can count on the fingers of two hands the number of African-American playwrights who have had more than one financially successful play on Broadway in the past few decades (August Wilson and Lynn Nottage are among the few). Add gay and the number gets even smaller or even non-existent, indicating that black queer voices have a difficult time being heard on America’s main commercial theatrical venue. Two current productions—one on Broadway and the other off—address the experiences not only of African-American gays but also of individuals of varying race, sexuality, and gender in interracial relations. Both playwrights offer startling different theatrical experiences and force us to examine hard questions—though one is rougher, rawer, and scarier.\n\nChoir Boy, at Manhattan Theatre Club’s Samuel J. Friedman Theatre, marks the Broadway debut of Tarell Alvin McCraney who won an Oscar for Moonlight, which was based on his play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue. Choir Boy premiered in 2013 at MTC’s Off-Broadway space and, like Moonlight, focuses on the struggles of being gay in an African-American community. This time the microcosm is a boys prep school where flamboyant tenor Pharus Jonathan Young leads the prestigious gospel choir. Pharus’s unabashedly open style of performance and carriage bring him into direct conflict with the homophobic Bobby. But Pharus must also weave his way through the subtle maze of hetero prejudice, accentuated among black straight men because of the almost daily encounters with challenges to their masculinity from white racist attitudes.\n\nIn one telling scene, Pharus seeks to expand the appeal of traditional spirituals to include all minorities. Bobby is offended at Pharus’s implied conflation of black and gay oppression. And therein is the central conflict of the play: inclusion versus separation. Pharus demands openness, while most of his peers can tolerate his orientation if only he would tone it down. McCraney explores the myriad variations on this theme in a compelling hour and 45 minutes, staged with economy and passion by Trip Cullman, punctuated by stirring gospel numbers featuring Jason Michael Webb’s dynamic arrangements and Camille A. Brown’s exciting movement.\n\nJeremy Pope, who sports amazing pipes, captures Pharus’s sparkling fabulousness as well as his tender vulnerability, particularly when he drops the fierce mask and shows his aching need for love. J. Quentin Johnson makes Bobby much more than a bully by infusing his complex motivation for his anger at Pharus with depth. Chuck Cooper brings humor and dimension to the wise headmaster combatting his own biases. Austin Pendleton gives rumpled dignity to the absent-minded instructor, John Clay III lends compassion to Pharus’s jock roommate AJ, and Caleb Eberhardt captures the tortured soul of David, who shares a painful secret with Pharus. Their voices and those of the playwright make Choir Boy a beautiful song of acceptance and struggle.\n\nJeremy O. Harris has not yet achieved the prominence of McCraney, but his premiere work at New York Theater Workshop, Slave Play, marks him as a daring and innovative new dramatist. Without revealing too much of the plot twist, suffice to say that Harris explores multifaceted takes on race and sex in a surprising and satiric comedy. The intermissionless play opens with the audience viewing set designer Clint Ramos’s fractured vision of an antebellum plantation reflected in a wall of mirrors, while sound designer Lindsay Jones’s eerie broken¬ music-box melody plays on a loop. We are then presented with what appear to be three 19th-century master-slave couples engaging in weird amorous play— this is the first play I’ve ever seen with a credit for “Intimacy & Fight Director,” sizzling and sweaty done by Claire Warden. Then one of the participants jarringly calls out “Starbucks!” and the rug is ripped out from under us. We haven’t fallen down a rabbit hole of time and perception in the tradition of Bruce Norris’s Clybourne Park and Jonathan Reynolds’s Stonewall Jackson’s House. What follows is a riotous, uncompromising look at how black and white people see and react to each other, staged with the right balance of outrageous humor and prickly reality by Robert O’Hara, who has explored similar territory in his own plays Barbecue and Bootycandy.\n\nThe eight-member cast—another couple joins the sextet halfway through the action—delivers intensely funny and searingly dramatic performances, especially Teyonah Parris as a woman wrestling with racial demons and Annie McNamara in a hilarious parody of Southern belle-hood and modern hipness. Gay, straight, black, white, psychological, and sexual issues are given an unscrupulous eyeballing in this uncomfortably laugh-filled play. Harris has another show, Daddy, coming up this season in a joint production from the Vineyard Theater and the New Group. It’ll be exciting to see what surprises he has in store.\n\nJanuary 10, 2019\n\nChoir Boy: Jan 8–Feb 17. Manhattan Theatre Club at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre, 261 W. 47th St., NYC.

Newhouse Theatre\n\nReviewed by David Sheward\n\nBryan Cranston in Network\n\nPhoto by Jan Versweyveld\n\nWhen the film Network was released in 1976, legendary screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky’s wild portrait of an America saturated by media was seen as an hilarious fantasy. Now as director Ivo van Hove’s stage version opens on Broadway after a smash run in London, the vision of a dumbed-down populace hypnotized by its screens seems tame in comparison to the reality of 2018. In another frightening parallel to our dystopian present, deranged anchorman Howard Beale (Oscar winner Peter Finch in the movie) awoke the senseless rage of his viewing audience with the now familiar catchphrase, “I’m as mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore.” Our reality-TV star president similarly touched a nerve of undirected anger and rode that wave into the White House, making this production terrifyingly relevant.\n\nLee Hall’s adaptation largely lifts Chayefsky’s screenplay with a few cuts—the terrorist group with its own TV hour has been downplayed. The true author of this inventive, involving piece of theater is van Hove who, along with his design partner Jan Versweyveld, has transformed the Belasco Theater into a world where video, stage, audience, and actors overlap and intermingle. Video screens are everywhere. An onstage restaurant provides meals for theatergoers as well as settings for the characters. The lines between TV and reality blur as when Beale and his news producer Max have a scene together at the corner of the stage. Their backs are to the audience, but their images are televised on a gigantic screen so that we are relating to their video avatars rather than to the flesh-and-blood actors. The medium becomes the message as images supersede and dwarf the actual. It’s arresting, dazzling theater and a frightening message of dehumanization in the age of 24/7 streaming.\n\nOccasionally, the staging gets a bit gimmicky and lessens Chayefsky’s theme of the deadening force of TV. This occurs when Bryan Cranston’s edgy and unpredictable Beale wades into the audience to deliver a chilling message of hopelessness amid corporate tyranny. Cranston jokes with the first few rows as he sits among them, and suddenly we’re at a fun Broadway show instead of a devastating nightmare. Fortunately, there are few of these jolting slips.\n\nCranston gives a titanic rendition of the mad anchorman, rooted in logic and compassion, yet tinged with insanity. When he implores Beale’s viewers to rage, there is a true human connection. He really wants to save them from the despair of modern society, but we can see the deranged intensity lurking beneath his railing.\n\nTony Goldwyn has the less showy role of Max Schumacher, representing stability in an insane universe, and he provides the foundation from which van Hove and Cranston can take off on their flights of excess and nuttiness. Tatiana Maslany is the soulless programmer Diana Christensen (Oscar-winning Faye Dunaway in the film) who twists Max’s news show into an entertainment spectacle. She captures Diana’s narcissistic ambition and charisma without making her into a harpy. It’s understandable why Max would launch an affair with her (depicted in graphic onstage detail in a breathtaking sequence which begins outside the theater and ends in the onstage eatery). Alyssa Bresnahan is moving in the tiny role of Max’s wife (Beatrice Straight took the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for the original), and Nick Wyman is icily effective as the financial giant who gives Beale the lowdown on who’s really running the show.\n\nVon Hove has previously taken classic American plays A View From the Bridge, The Little Foxes, The Crucible, and A Streetcar Named Desire, stripped them down and turned them inside out, giving new takes on classic views of our country. Here he creates a sense-stunning, funhouse mirror reflecting the bizarre world where truth is stranger than satire.\n\nNetwork confronts us with the dire implications of endless TV, but Tom Stoppard’s new play The Hard Problem, at Lincoln Center’s Mitzi Newhouse Theatre, asks us to consider the even deeper question of human consciousness itself. In a sleek production from Jack O’Brien, this intimate yet infinite comedy-drama tackles the imponderable issues of God, man, good, evil, computers, art, and altruism in less than two hours without a break. For Stoppard, Britain’s most complex and brilliant playwright for almost six decades, this is a mere bagatelle of a play, but it’s an intellectual feast compared to the weightiest works of others.\n\nScientist Hilary (a delightfully earnest Adelaide Clemens) and her sometime lover Spike (appropriately snarky Chris O’Shea) spar over whether the human brain can be re-created as a machine and if we are nothing more than a set of impulses. Hilary argues for the existence of God and the possibility of goodness, while Spike sees us as mechanical—a thermostat could have consciousness if properly programmed, he opines. When Hilary launches an experiment to conclusively prove people are basically charitable and kind, a web of coincidences and interrelations is revealed and indirectly proves her thesis. As per any work from the author of The Real Thing, Arcadia, and The Coast of Utopia, the talk is brilliant, witty, and thought-provoking. O’Brien’s staging is brisk and precise. In an interesting move, the director has the understudies change the furnishings in David Rockwell’s simple set and watch each of the many scenes like students at a grad seminar. At first this seems annoying and pretentious, but it later ties in with the theme of interconnectedness in this fascinating gem of a play.\n\nDecember 22, 2018\n\nNetwork: Dec 6–April 28.

In his magnificent staging of Shakespeare’s infrequently performed saga of power and mass hysteria Coriolanus for the Stratford Festival in the province of Ontario, he gives the lie to that calumny. LePage’s innovative and ultramodern effects are anything but gimmicky and serve the purpose of the Bard’s theme of easy public manipulation, an especially relevant trope in this age of social media and governing by Twitter. This astonishing production combines elements of film and theater to create a third, hybrid form, moving with the speed of light yet still carrying the full weight of Shakespeare’s dynamic and scathing indictment of thoughtless mob mentality.\n\nThrough means of LePage’s intricate set and Laurent Routhier’s multidimensional lighting, the stage of Stratford’s Avon Theater transforms into a dozen locations with fascinating fluidity. LePage, along with Steve Blanchet, listed as creative director and designer, has created individual box units, which travel horizontally and vertically and can seem to shrink and expand through the use of black masking curtains. Thus, he delivers the theatrical equivalent of close-ups, dissolves, and other cinematic tricks. He even begins the evening with movie-like titles credits. One particularly dazzling sequence features a transformation from a stylish, subdued cocktail lounge to a blaring airstrip complete with a landing plane in a matter of seconds.\n\nThis filmic approach and totally modern setting (Mara Gottier created the sleek costumes) is perfect for the plot. Coriolanus is a proud Roman general refusing to stoop to court the public’s good will in order to be elected to a civilian position in government. A pair of jealous tribunes stirs the common people’s ire against the arrogant military hero, and he is banished. LePage updates the setting to our media-crazed present with plebeians phoning in to radio talk shows, soldiers exchanging texts projected on a giant screen, and the exiled Coriolanus driving what appears to be a real sports car through a video terrain of ruined cities and dense forests to his former enemy’s encampment.\n\nFortunately the sterling performances of the Stratford cast are not overwhelmed by LePage’s wizardry. In the title role, André Sills is a combination action hero and tragic towering figure. He employs his massive bulk to convey the sheer the power of this military man, as well as his rich voice and precise diction to impart his intelligence and pride. Yet he becomes a churlish boy in the presence of his lioness of a mother, Volumnia, played with fiery intensity by Lucy Peacock. When these two collide, the stage explodes. Tom McManus makes a sagacious and sober Menenius, Coroilanus’s trusted mentor; and Stephen Ouimette and Tom Rooney are suitably conniving and self-interested as the plotting tribunes. Graham Abbey brings the necessary macho swagger to Aufidius, Coriolanus’s battlefield rival and nemesis, plus an intriguing tinge of gay sexuality, hinted at in Shakespeare’s text and brought into the open by LePage. This is a perfect production and one that hopefully be brought to other stages outside of Stratford.\n\nWhile LePage perfectly combines all the elements of script, cast, and production, Stratford artistic director Antoni Cimolino comes up short with a tepid Tempest. His concept and several stage effects are arresting, but the beating heart of the play is missing. Bretta Gerecke’s dazzling sets and costumes beautifully create a fanciful, magical world, and Cimolino staged numerous effective sequences including a rousing initial storm scene and a truly terrifying tormenting of the villains featuring an impressive giant harpy.\n\nThere are also many fine individual performances, but the necessary connections between the makeshift island community created amid the shipwrecked magician Prospero, the daughter Miranda, the ethereal sprite Ariel, and the resentful reptilian Caliban were not credible. Stratford veteran Martha Henry makes Prospero into a wise, matriarchal figure, but her bond with Mamie Zwettler’s energetic Miranda was perfunctory. Apart from Henry’s occasional fussing with Zwettler’s hair, there was no tenderness or spark between the two. Henry’s approach to the role is more temperate and mild, lacking the usual explosive dynamism (lest I be accused of sexism, I have admired previous female Prosperos, including Helen Mirren’s interpretation in Julie Taymor’s 2010 film version). Andre Morin’s Ariel was earthbound, while Michael Blake was muted in delivering Caliban’s simmering rage. The only joy and liveliness is provided by Stephen Ouimette and Tom McCamus who inject a sense of reckless wiliness into the drunken clowns Trinculo and Stephano.\n\nMore reaction from the Stratford and nearby Shaw Festivals will follow in upcoming reviews.\n\nAugust 15, 2018\n\nCoriolanus: June 22–Oct. 25.

Three of these blenderizings result in diverse delight, while one produces a pulpy mess. Head Over Heels on Broadway and a new adaptation of Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night in Central Park employ Elizabethan romantic romps as their template and deliver modern messages of inclusion, while a Yiddish-language staging offers a new and moving view of the beloved Fiddler on the Roof.\n\nHead Over Heels could have been just another jukebox musical, but the clever book originally by Jeff Whitty and rewritten by James Magruder mixes Sir Philip Sidney’s 16th century prose work The Arcadia with songs by the 1980s girl group The Go-Go’s (along with tunes from the solo career of member Belinda Carlisle) for a surprisingly fun, silly joyride. The usual tangle of hidden loves and gender-bending disguises gets a 2018 twist with lesbian, transgender, and feminist themes interwoven.\n\nThe mythical kingdom of Arcadia, a weird collage of ancient Greek, Elizabethan, and 1980s sensibilities (Julian Crouch designed the charming storybook sets), lives by the beat, a harmonious life rhythm and also a good excuse for the cast to open the show with “We Got the Beat,” the Go-Go’s’ biggest hit, and dance Spencer Liff’s infectious choreography. The revelry is interrupted by a dire prophecy of doom delivered by Pythio, a sexually binary figure played by Drag Race contestant Peppermint. Chauvinist king Basilius (sturdy Jeremy Kushnier) leads his court into the woods to avoid the deadly predictions, much to the objections of his strong-minded queen Gynecia (diva-fierce Rachel York).\n\nConfusion in the forest ensues, staged with just the right balance of zaniness and precision by Michael Mayer. Royal daughters Pamela (comic find Bonnie Milligan) and Philoclea (sparkly Alexandra Socha) find unconventional love with trusty handmaid Mopsa (vibrant Taylor Iman Jones) and shepherd Musidorus (adorable and funny Andrew Durand) respectively. Whitty and Magruder invert the usual gender-bending by having Musidorus disguise himself as a fetching Amazon lass. The myriad plot patches are woven into a brightly colored crazy quilt, reflecting the creators and cast’s appreciation and love of sexual diversity, pop culture, and the beat.\n\nThe Central Park Twelfth Night gives off similar vibes of inspired nuttiness and celebratory sexual ambiguity. The Bard’s perennially popular tale of separated boy and girl twins has previously been musicalized with the hit Your Own Thing and the flops Love and Let Love, Music Is, Play On!, and All Shook Up. This latest updating is as much fun as Heels and obliterates any memory of predecessors.\n\nLike Heels’ Arcadia, Twelfth Night’s Illyria is an imaginary realm where identities blur and overlap. Director Kwame Kwei-Armah envisioned the setting as a gigantic block party with participation from local community groups when this production was done as a limited Public Works staging in 2016. Public Theater artistic director Oskar Eustis takes up the reigns for this renewed staging, while Kwei-Armah fulfills his new position as artistic director of the New Vic in London.\n\nThe Delacorte stage literally overflows with people as Tony winners Nikki M. James and Shuler Hensley and other Broadway and Off-Broadway vets mix with nonprofessionals in a riotous configuration expertly controlled by Eustis with hip choreography by Lorin Latarro. In addition to the solid James and Hensley, Ato Blankson-Wood, Nanya-Akuki Goodrich, Daniel Hall, Andrew Kober, and Lori Brown-Niang prove capable clowns. Shaina Taub leads the orchestra with aplomb, plays the fool Feste with zip, and wrote the splendid songs, which explore themes of gender switching and perspective. This infectious and fizzy spectacle rushes by in 90 minutes, a delicious summer cooler. What a pity it will gone soon. But that makes it all the more special. If the Public Theater attempts to transfer it to a commercial run, it would have to scale back the size and trim the bubbling excess. It wouldn’t be the same indoors or smaller.\n\nThe National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene production of Fiddler on the Roof performs a reverse operation—reducing the scale of a huge Broadway smash to a more intimate experience in the small auditorium at the Museum of Jewish Heritage. The result is not a diminishment. The production staged with love and professionalism by the Oscar-Tony-winning actor Joel Grey creates a sense of a community telling the story of a small village in Tsarist Russia rather than a series of star turns and showstoppers. The Yiddish-language adaptation by Shraga Friedman from the 1965 Israeli premiere further adds to the spirit of the setting since this is the language Sholom Aleichem’s characters would have spoken. (English and Russian translations are provided on screens on either side of the stage.) Grey’s staging and Stas Kmiec’s choreography convey the close connections within the village of Anatevka as its flinty inhabitants scrape out a living in the shadow of an oppressive anti-Semitic government. The horrors of the pogroms become frighteningly real as Beowulf Borritt’s simple set and a banner with Hebrew writing are ripped apart.\n\nSteven Skybell leads the company as Tevye, the long-suffering milkman with five daughters, a nagging wife, and a close relationship with God. Skybell, a New York theater veteran with numerous Broadway and Off-Broadway credits, conveys the full range of Tevye’s reactions to the eroding of his beloved Old World traditions as they give way to 20th-century shifts. Here is a father wrestling with challenges to his authority and love for his children instead of a comic delivering a big number or going for the laugh lines. Jennifer Babiak captures the rough edge of Tevye’s spouse, Golde, as well as her hidden tenderness. Each member of the company becomes a full-fleshed citizen of Anatevka from Jackie Hoffman’s kvetching matchmaker to every beggar, butcher, and ghost.\n\nThe same cannot be said for This Ain’t No Disco, a new musical from Atlantic Theater Company with major-name involvement but minor impact. The self-described “rock opera” also attempts to depict a community—that of the late 1970s-’80s NYC club scene—but produces only stereotypes and derivative songs. This is a surprise since the score is by Stephen Trask and Peter Yankowitz who worked on Hedwig and the Angry Inch (Trask as composer and Yankowitz as the original drummer), the book is by Trask, Yankowitz, and Rick Elice (co-author of Jersey Boys), and direction is by Tony winner Darko Tresnjak (A Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder).\n\nThere are individual moments of excitement provided by Samantha Marie Ware as a troubled recording star, Chilina Kennedy as a smarmy publicist-turned–TV personality, and Will Connolly as an Andy Warhol clone. But the storyline is overly familiar with goodhearted Sammy (Ware) and Chad (sweet Peter Laprade) caught up in the phony milieu of Studio 54 and the Mudd Club. Instead of insightful commentary and portraiture of a bizarre and intoxicating era, we get warmed-over tropes of innocence corrupted, accompanied by pedestrian tunes and lyrics, traffic-cop direction by Tresnjak, aerobics-class choreography by Camille A. Brown, and outrageous mugging by Theo Stockman as Steve Rubell, the real-life owner Studio 54.\n\nYou’ll have a joyful night at Head Over Heels, Twelfth Night, or Fiddler, but This Ain’t No Disco ain’t worth your time.\n\nAugust 1, 2018\n\nHead Over Heels: Opened July 26 for an open run.

There was no unifying theme amid the final plethora of shows, but two of them share a common element—their producers banking on American theatergoers’ love affair with all things British. Two imports featured feats of English legerdemain: a theatrical sequel to J.K. Rowling’s beloved series of book on the boy wizard Harry Potter, and Travesties, a revival of one of Tom Stoppard’s early works of intellectual sleight of hand.\n\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child flew into the Lyric Theater after an Olivier Award–winning run in London. This two-part continuation of Rowling’s enchanting saga is a strong favorite to repeat that triumph at the Tonys. The intricate script by Jack Thorne (based on an original new story by Rowling, Thorne, and director John Tiffany) begins 19 years after the events of the last book with Harry all grown up and his son Albus— named for his mystical mentor at Hogwarts school—encountering myriad magical trials and tribulations as the boy attempts to establish his own wizard identity outside of his dad’s legendary shadow.\n\nA knowledge of Potter lore is helpful to enjoy the spectacle, since Thorne alludes to almost every aspect of the entire seven-volume canon. Devoted followers will be in seventh—or eight and ninth—heaven. (At the performance attended, the audience was filled with fans dressed in witchy regalia, and a dad accompanying his two kids behind me loudly whooped for every reference and magic trick.) For non-Harryheads, Cursed Child is still a joyous thrill ride, staged with such speed, ingenuity, and affection by Tiffany that the seven-hour running time bullets along like the phantom train to Hogwarts. By the way, that train is prominently featured, cleverly re-created thanks to Christine Jones’s jigsaw-puzzle set and Neil Austin’s multidimensional lighting.\n\nA large British and American cast brings the faculty, students, and alumni of Harry’s alma mater to life, but special kudos is due to Anthony Boyle as the bumbling Scorpius Malfoy, who is the son of Harry’s nemesis and currently young Albus’s best friend. Boyle gives several new twists to the traditional awkward but lovable teen staple character, with multiple shadings and inventive delivery to Scorpius’s ardent quest to befriend Albus and escape his father’s dark legacy. Boyle is just one of many delights in a galaxy of theatrical wonders.\n\nPatrick Marber’s dazzling revival of Tom Stoppard’s Tony-winning Travesties (1974) is another imported dish worth savoring. First presented by Menier Chocolate Factory and produced here by Roundabout Theatre Company, this vital comedy of ideas raises complex questions about the confluence of art, revolution, and war. Just as Harry Potter requires some prior knowledge of the hero’s history, this rollicking intellectual roller coaster assumes you know a thing or two about European literary history and politics. Stoppard takes his complex premise from the coincidence that three revolutionaries—Irish novelist James Joyce, Russian rebel Lenin, and Tristan Tzara, leader of the radical Dadaist art movement—were all in Zurich, Switzerland, at roughly the same time (1917). Henry Carr, a minor clerk with the British consulate during this period, in a senile flashback mashes together these separate storylines and filters them through the plot of The Importance of Being Earnest (Carr performed in an amateur version of Wilde’s classic comedy staged by Joyce.)\n\nTom Hollander repeats his scintillating and versatile London performance as Carr, effortlessly switching for the decrepit elderly narrator to the young, pompous, and pretentious protagonist tangling with the mental heavyweights of his age while romantically pursuing the librarian Cicely (a delightful Sara Topham). As Tzara, Seth Numrich energetically bounds across Tim Hatley’s handsome book-stuffed set, spouting absurdist nonsense as he embarks on a parallel amorous quest parallel for Gwendolyn (an equally delightful Scarlett Strallen). If this all sounds confusing, it is a bit, but Marber’s precise and whip-smart direction is so fast and funny, you’ll joyfully laugh along for the whole ride.\n\nWhile Stoppard’s wit is well served in this revival, his contemporary and fellow British risk-taking playwright Caryl Churchill’s innovative and brash style is not given adequate realization in a new production of her Light Shining in Buckinghamshire, at the Off-Broadway New York Theatre Workshop. Written in 1976 (during the same era as Travesties), Light also mixes historical and fictional figures in an examination of the 17th-century British Civil War which split the very fabric of English society. A king was beheaded and the ensuing chaos pitted faction against faction. Religion, government, family life—all were affected.\n\nChurchill developed her script in collaboration with the Joint Stock Theatre Company, combining historical texts with improvisations and short scenes depicting farmers, soldiers, politicians, parsons, lords, butchers, and housewives living through tumultuous times. The play is a fragmentary portrait with few solid through-lines to follow. In her later works such as Cloud 9, Top Girls, and Serious Money, Churchill perfected the technique of attacking a big topic through the fractured lens of multiple perspectives. Here it’s just confusing. Obie winning director Rachel Chavkin has employed her bold imagination to produce startlingly fresh stagings of such shows as Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812, The Royale, and Hadestown (also at NYTW). But she settles for a flat, stagnant staging. Despite the valiant efforts of a diverse cast of six, this Light is too dim.\n\nMay 20, 2018\n\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child, Parts One and Two: Opened April 22 for an open run.

Newhouse Theater [show closed]\n\nReviewed by David Sheward\n\nBrian Tyree Henry, Bel Powley, Michael Cera, and Chris Evans in Lobby Hero\n\nPhoto by Mark Seliger\n\nRecycling continues to be the main mode of operating on Broadway. Two American plays (Three Tall Women, Lobby Hero) are making their belated Main Stem debuts after successful Off-Broadway engagements roughly two decades ago and yet another Disney cartoon (Frozen) is transitioning to the live stage. Meanwhile Off-Broadway, a brand-new work (Admissions) is challenging conventions and rigidly held beliefs in a production that induces both laughs and squirms of discomfort. The Broadway revivals do the same, but it’s indicative of our large-scale commercial theater that fresh innovation is confined to our smaller stages.\n\nBoth of the straight plays are also fueled by star power. Two-time Oscar winner Glenda Jackson returns to New York theater after an absence of 30 years as the domineering matriarch in Edward Albee’s 1994 Pulitzer Prize–winning Women, while Chris Evans takes a perhaps permanent break from playing Captain America in the onscreen Marvel universe to limn a less virtuous law enforcer in Kenneth Lonergan’s Lobby Hero. These marquee names provide the drawing power for their respective vehicles, but they are really part of a pair of tightly knit ensembles.\n\nThe majestic Jackson is joined by the precise Laurie Metcalf and the intense Alison Pill in Joe Mantello’s reimagining of Albee’s examination of the life of a domineering woman not unlike his adoptive mother. In the first act, we are in the well-appointed bedroom of A, 92 years old and definitely not going gentle into that good night as she rails against the infirmities of her body and mind and reminisces on the challenges and joys of her long life. B, her middle-aged caregiver (Metcalf), and C, her young lawyer (Pill), spar over A’s foibles and attempt to sort through the debris of her unpaid bills. In the second act (there is no intermission in this staging), Miriam Buether’s elegant set transforms into a hall of mirrors, and each actor becomes A at various ages. Mantello cleverly conveys this triangular vision without turning it into a gimmick. He also manages to inject action into what is basically a long debate peppered with Albee’s observations on the nature of mortality. Jackson is a fearsome lioness, roaring at the loss of her vitality. Metcalf and Pill are equally fearsome in defending their stances and marking their territory. It’s a triple tour de force.\n\nLobby Hero (2001) doesn’t address life and death like Three Tall Women, but its focus is almost as sweeping, considering issues of morality rather than mortality. Kenneth Lonergan’s intricately plotted Chinese puzzle box of a play asks when we should put the common good above our personal interests. Two security guards and two police officers are faced with a series of interconnected moral dilemmas. As he did in his compassionate screenplays for Manchester by the Sea and You Can Count on Me, Lonergan skillfully balances humor and pathos, endowing each point of this rectangle with flaws and virtues.\n\nThis first production by Second Stage at its new Broadway home, the refurbished Helen Hayes Theater, is cleanly staged by Trip Cullman on David Rockwell’s spare revolving set. But the four players are not equally strong. Chris Evans is appropriately and comically bellicose as the bullying cop Bill, but Michael Cera (of Arrested Development and Juno) fails to shade Jeff, the lovable loser security guard, often settling for easy laughs. Jeff is the center of the play, and Cera does not provide a reason for us to care about his actions. Likewise Bel Powley as Dawn, Bill’s female partner and Jeff’s love interest, just delivers broad caricature. Brian Tyree Henry gives an in-depth portrayal of William, Jeff’s supervisor, and the most believable liming of a character’s conflict.\n\nDespite Lobby Hero being a non-risky bet with its previous pedigree and movie-and-TV-star casting, it’s heartening to see a theater company committed to presenting American playwrights on Broadway.\n\nMeanwhile, down the block from the Hayes, the Disney Industrial Complex is presenting its latest potential cash cow, Frozen. Derived from the popular 2013 animated feature and the Hans Christian Anderson story “The Snow Queen,” this kiddie tuner hits all the proper notes: female power ballad (the Oscar-winning “Let It Go”), plucky heroine, briefly thwarted but ultimately resolved romance, comic anthropomorphized sidekick (a sweet snowman), lots of chases. But the conflict (repressed ice queen versus her warmhearted sister) provides little gripping action. Michael Grandage’s stiff staging, the syrupy book by Jennifer Lee (who also penned the original screenplay), and the pleasant but familiar score by husband-and-wife team Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez are too by-the-numbers and left this non-Disney-worshipping adult cold.\n\nAt the performance attended the young audience, particularly girls, oohed and ahhed after every ice storm projected onto Christopher Orem’s storyboard set. There will likely be enough of them dragging their parents in to keep the box office unfrozen and to provide plenty of jobs for capable leading ladies such as Caissie Levy and Patti Murin, who turn in professional work as the obligatory princesses. Greg Hildreth is oddly muted as the cute snowman Olaf, perhaps because he was busy operating the puppet version of the character. Jelani Aladdin makes for a refreshingly unconventional male love object, and Kevin Del Aguila did get a smile out of me as a comic innkeeper. So far only Julie Taymor has managed to create a startlingly stageworthy vocabulary to tell a Disney story on Broadway with her dazzlingly original Lion King.\n\nAt Lincoln Center’s intimate Mitzi Newhouse space, Joshua Harmon’s Admissions takes an unflinching look at liberal assumptions about engineering diversity in education. Like Albee and Lonergan, this young playwright, who also wrote the barbed Bad Jews, combines razor-sharp humor with pointed commentary to produce a scathing satire of our racial politics. When the white, ultra-progressive admissions director of a New Hampshire prep school finds her own son the loser (because of the very policies she has been practicing) when he applies to an Ivy League college, she and her husband, the school’s headmaster, must question their values. Director Daniel Aukin wisely keeps the satire from becoming too broad, as does his exemplary cast led by Jessica Hecht as the conflicted mother. Once again, Off-Broadway is leading the way in presenting fresh, challenging work.\n\nApril 3, 2018\n\nFrozen: The Broadway Musical: Opened March 22 for an open run.

Theatergoers entering Circle in the Square for Michael Arden’s life-affirming revival of Once on This Island will think it’s been hit by a hurricane. Before the show starts, cast members dressed in castoff materials wade through debris, tend to a live goat and chickens, and give and receive vaccinations. Reflective of the recent spate of natural disasters afflicting the play’s Caribbean setting, Arden and set designer Dane Laffrey have created an incredibly lifelike community struggling to come back from disaster. Against this tragic backdrop, the magnificent company tells book-writer-lyricist Lynn Ahrens and composer Stephen Flaherty’s joyous story of survival and spirituality. Music supervisor Chris Fenwick makes the score feel like it’s being played by a really top-notch beach band.\n\nThe simple plot follows the vibrant orphan girl Ti Moune as she sacrifices everything for the love of a rich boy. Meanwhile, the island gods of water, earth, life, and death guide her. In its original 1990 Broadway staging, Island was a charming bauble; now it’s a stirring, enveloping experience. Laffrey’s environmental set, complete with an onstage pond and a wrecked truck, are an entire world, cleverly morphed into dozens of locales by Arden’s supple direction and Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer’s mercurial lighting. Clint Ramos’s imaginative costumes add to the makeshift milieu. Examples of Ramos’s ingenuity include a plastic tablecloth skirt and a crown fashioned from extension cords.\n\nNewcomer Hailey Kilgore is a spectacular surprise as Ti Moune, displaying a rich, emotive voice, expressive dancing (Camille A. Brown’s choreography is stunning), and an impressive acting range. She conveys Ti Moune’s gritty determination, her bubbly zest for life, and her heartbreaking sorrow when the gap between the two lovers proves too wide. Elegant Lea Salonga, earthy Alex Newell, diabolical Merle Dandridge, and powerful Quentin Earl Darrington make a fearsome foursome of deities in this enchanting Island.\n\nAnother Broadway musical offers an equally joyful seaside-themed evening, but a decidedly goofier one. SpongeBob SquarePants features all the adorable characters from the long-running Nickelodeon cartoon series, brought to life by David Zinn’s wacko costumes. Zinn also designed the Rube Goldberg–inspired set, which resembles a giant water-park ride. Familiarity with the perennially cheerful SpongeBob and his fellow citizens of the underwater hamlet of Bikini Bottom is helpful but not essential for delighting in this fun-filled romp, staged with a combination of childlike glee and adult sophistication by Tina Landau.\n\nThere are a few caveats. The average series segment runs 11 minutes, but this show clocks in at a somewhat bloated two hours and 20 minutes. Kyle Jarrow’s otherwise snappy book could lose a half-hour, particularly during an extended adventure sequence as SpongeBob, Sandy the Squirrel, and Patrick Starfish scale a mountain to plug up a soon-to-erupt volcano. In addition, one or two songs could be excised from the pop-flavored score. Despite boasting 22 composers and lyricists—including David Bowie, Sara Bareilles, Aerosmith, They Might Be Giants, and Cyndi Lauper—all the tunes sound the same as every other ditty about overcoming obstacles, having perfect days, and keeping friends.\n\nAs the titular yellow porous hero, the athletic Ethan Slater twists his body into outrageous shapes and expresses the essence of SpongeBob (child-like enthusiasm) without becoming too syrupy. Danny Skinner’s clueless Patrick and Lilli Cooper’s spunky Sandy also capture the spirit of their animated counterparts, while Gavin Lee as Squidward Q. Tentacles stops the show with a flashy multilegged tap number (Christopher Gattelli provided the flashy choreography). There are also comic and vocal highlights from Wesley Taylor’s villainous Plankton, Brian Ray Norris’s hard-shelled Mr. Krabs, and Jai’ Len Christine Li Josey as his daughter Pearl the Whale (you have to know the show to understand how father and daughter can be of two different species). Some adults may chafe at all the giggly silliness, but for kids and kids at heart, this is a sweet, watery treat.\n\nLike SpongeBob, Steve Martin’s Meteor Shower is as substantial as a soap bubble. At 75 minutes, it feels skimpy for a high-priced Broadway attraction, but that one hour and 15 minutes is packed with hilarity. The playlet is essentially an extended Saturday Night Live skit with nicey-nicey repressed hosts Corky and Norm tormented by aggressive guests from hell Gerald and Laura as they watch the titular cosmic light show. Like Martin’s previous works for the theatre (Picasso at the Lapine Agile, Wasp), Meteor takes a slight idea and stretches it as far as possible without snapping it. Jerry Zaks’s zippy direction mines extra yuks from Martin’s brief but gut-busting script. As Corky, comedienne-writer Amy Schumer exhibits split-second timing and an instinct for physical comedy worthy of Carol Burnett or Lucille Ball. Laura Benanti nearly steals the show with her sexy, bitchy take on the guest Laura. Jeremy Shamos as Norm and Keegan-Michael Key (of the comedy team Key and Peele) as Gerald don’t shine quite as brightly as the women, but do get their share of laugh-inducing moments. Don’t waste any brain cells trying to search for hidden meaning, messages on marriage and relationships, or satire on the Theater of the Absurd. Just sit back and guffaw.\n\nDecember 9, 2017\n\nOnce on This Island: Opened Dec. 3 for an open run. Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, NYC.

Danny Burstein, a five-time Tony nominee in featured or co-starring roles, finally gets to carry a show in Bartlett Sher’s intensely moving reinvention of Fiddler on the Roof. But Jackie Hoffman, a wildly funny second banana in such productions as Hairspray, The Addams Family , and On the Town, is thrown off-balance in Once Upon a Mattress.\n\nFiddler is best known as a vehicle for whomever plays Tevye, the downtrodden Jewish milkman struggling with anti-Semitism and challenges to tradition in Tsarist Russia. I was too young to see Zero Mostel in the 1964 original, but his gigantic personality overwhelms the original cast recording my family listened to constantly. A miscast Alfred Molina dominated David Leveaux’s beautiful but passionless 2004 revival. In Sher’s tenderly understated staging, Burstein makes Tevye a human-sized individual coping with the irresistible tide of history rather than a larger-than-life force of nature wrestling with God and selling a star turn of “If I Were a Rich Man.”\n\nThe deceptively simple production is a bit of a departure for Sher, whose colossal versions of South Pacific and The King and I took full advantage of the enormous Vivian Beaumont stage at Lincoln Center. The action here starts in a nearly empty stage. The only scenery is a railroad sign with the name of Tevye’s tiny village, Anatevka, in Russian letters. Burstein enters dressed in contemporary clothes and reads the opening lines from a book—presumably by Sholom Aleichem, whose stories inspired Joseph Stein’s book. He removes his overcoat to reveal Catherine Zuber’s detailed shtetl wear and becomes Tevye. This device establishes the connection between the world of the show and our own, as Michael Yeargen’s floating, dream-like sets create a memoryscape.\n\nBurstein as Tevye is the narrator, but also part of the ensemble, and he never takes over the proceedings. Sher makes Anatevka into a believable community rather than a musical-comedy version of one. Each cast member is equally vivid, from Jessica Hecht’s shrewish but strong Golde (Tevye’s wife) to Alix Korey’s meddling yet lonely Yente the matchmaker to Jesse Kovarsky’s flying fiddler who represents the dreams and aspirations of the town. Another new element is the choreography. In previous Broadway productions, Jerome Robbins’s original steps were always incorporated, but London-based, Israeli-born Hofesh Shechter introduces a loose-limbed, free-form movement to the Anatevkans just as Sher and Burstein have transformed a traditionally showbiz work into a shatteringly real one.\n\nUnfortunately, the new Once Upon a Mattress does not make the transition as smoothly. Like Fiddler, Mattress is traditionally seen as a star showcase. The original 1959 production helped launch Carol Burnett’s career, and a 1996 revival ran aground due to a mismatched Sarah Jessica Parker in the lead. This fractured fairytale version of “The Princess and Pea” is basically an extended revue sketch with too much filler, but with the right cast it can be loads of silly fun. That’s why I had high hopes for the Off-Broadway Transport Group production. Jackie Hoffman has stolen almost every show she’s been in with her grouchy humor; and, with drag star John Epperson (better known as his creation Lypsinka) as the domineering Queen Aggravain, what could go wrong?\n\nPlenty. The lead role of Princess Winnifred is a blustering good-time gal, the opposite of a stereotypical dainty flower, but she must also be warm and kindhearted. Hoffman has the bluster—along with anger, wit, and smarts—but she lacks the charm and kindness necessary to make us care about Winnifred’s quest to win the nerdy Prince Dauntless. She seems detached from the show, and her ad-libs give the further impression that she’s looking down on the proceedings. That leaves Epperson to fill in the gaps, and he does with an outrageously camp performance referencing every drag-adored movie icon from Joan Crawford to Katharine Hepburn (he also gets help from Kathryn Rohe’s stunning costumes). But Aggravain, Dauntless’s mother, can’t be the center of the show, and director Jack Cummings III fails to redress the imbalance.\n\nThere are compensations in the form of David Greenspan’s whimsical king, Hunter Ryan Herdlicka’s charismatic minstrel, and Cory Linger’s light-footed jester, but they can’t smooth out the lumps in this Mattress.\n\nAnother Off-Broadway show successfully incorporates the musical style that usurped the Broadway sound in the popular consciousness around the time Fiddler first opened. These Paper Bullets! at Atlantic Theatre Company morphs Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing into a merry, mod romp featuring a Beatles-like group called the Quartos. Playwright Rolin Jones doesn’t strictly adhere to the Bard’s playbook, introducing clever variations on the war-of-the-sexes theme. The songs, by Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day, offer catchy pastiches of the Fab Four’s hits, and director Jackson Gay delivers a zany staging, abetted by Michael Yeargen’s spiffy revolving set and Jessica Ford’s gorgeous costumes.

The answer is every lonely girl dreaming in her bedroom, every woman looking to fulfill herself, or anyone who longs to hear their own fantasies in the form of melody and words. That was the appeal of King, who emerged as the voice of a questing generation with her album Tapestry. The musical captures a pinch of that sweet, smooth, painfully real sound and the churning emotions it evoked, but, in the end it’s too much like a dozen other jukebox shows. Like Motown, Jersey Boys, A Night with Janis Joplin, and Baby, It’s You, Beautiful is ultimately another “And-then-I-wrote” attraction.\n\nThat’s a shame because King’s biography is tailor made for more than a “Behind-the-Scenes” bio-tuner. While still in high school in Queens, Carole Klein was selling teenage crush songs under the name Carole King to record mogul Don Kirshner. While still in her teens, she meets and marries fellow Queens College student and aspiring playwright Gerry Goffin (a sexy, tortured Jake Epstein), and the two pen more than 50 hits. Their professional and personal union dissolves when Goffin begins taking drugs and sleeping with the singers who warble the couple’s tunes. With her collaborator and husband gone, Carole overcomes her fear of performing and writing solo to create such soulful, heart-stopping anthems to life and love as “You’ve Got a Friend,” “So Far Away,” and the shattering “It’s Too Late.”\n\nUnfortunately, Douglas McGrath’s slick book reduces the storyline to a predictable soaper, and too much of the dialogue is used as intros to songs from the King canon in the manner of Mamma Mia. (“Carole, we need a new song for The Drifters.”) McGrath also works in a parallel plotline with Carole and Gerry’s best friends, the songwriting couple Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann (game and likable Anika Larsen and Jarrod Spector), which allows for even more awkward melody-shoehorning. Barry Mann serves as a convenient Woody Allen type so McGrath can get off a set of neurotic, hypochondriac gags.\n\nMueller manages to rise above these shortcomings and emerges as Broadway’s newest star after promising cabaret work and supporting turns in revivals of On a Clear Day You Can See Forever and The Mystery of Edwin Drood. She captures the throbbing ache in King’s voice and charts her journey from shy girl to feminist icon with loving detail. Marc Bruni’s staging is just a bit too smooth, as are the ensemble’s re-creations of the King-Goffin-Weil-Mann songbook. For the first time, I understood Simon Cowell’s criticisms of American Idol contestants being “too Broadway.” The Beautiful cast members standing in for the Drifters, Shirelles, etc., lack the rough, raw edge of the originals. Fortunately, the star delivers a warm and wonderful rendition of Carole King’s sound and soul.\n\nJanuary 13, 2014\n\nOpened Jan. 12 for an open run. Stephen Sondheim Theatre, 124 W. 43rd St., NYC.

Like Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf, Long Day’s Journey Into Night, and A Streetcar Named Desire, this oft-produced slam-bang symbolic brother act affords the opportunity for actors to prove their dramatic chops by thrashing the scenery as well as chewing it. The new Roundabout Theatre Company revival is a blazing hot showcase for a mature, but still dangerous Ethan Hawke and a subtly intense Paul Dano with insightful, soulful direction from James Macdonald.\n\nOriginally produced in San Francisco in 1980, the play has gone through almost as many metamorphoses as the characters. After an unsuccessful mounting at the Public Theater starring Peter Boyle and Tommy Lee Jones, a sizzling revival from the Steppenwolf Theatre Company restored its reputation, launched the careers of John Malkovich and Gary Sinise, delivered a smash-hit run Off-Broadway for 762 performances, and was filmed for Public Television. An acclaimed 2000 revival featured Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly alternating in the lead roles.\n\nThe deceptively simple premise masks a complex examination of America’s obsessions with myths of manhood, movies, art, and the Wild West. Screenwriter Austin (Dano) is housesitting for his vacationing mother when his estranged brother Lee (Hawke), a drifter and petty thief, shows up to bring his usual reign of chaos. The stage is set for an epic battle of sibling rivalry as Lee worms his way into the good graces of Austin’s producer Saul Kimmer (Gary Wilmes) who drops Austin’s love story for Lee’s clichéd Western saga. The brothers exchange roles as the rough-edged Lee attempts to refine his raw ideas into a coherent script and Austin descends into alcoholic despair and absurdly starts stealing toasters. Underneath the gradually eroding situation is bitter resentment over their absent father and a mutual emptiness neither can ever fill. Each wants what the other has; Austin feels his conventional nuclear family is not enough, and Lee is dissatisfied with his drifting lifestyle. They think the desert—either of the movies or that of their imagination—can fill their inner voids.\n\nMacdonald, one of London’s top stagers, captures the wild humor as well as the galvanizing energy of Shepard’s battling bros. His production works on two levels—the literal satiric conflict over the movie, as well as the figurative struggle between Austin’s ordered world and Lee’s uncontrolled whirlpool of an existence. His transitions between scenes are startlingly sharp, with lighting designer Jane Cox providing blinding immediate blackouts and Bray Poor’s eerie original music evoking country-western dreams and noir-ish nightmares. Kaye Voyce’s witty costumes perfectly capture each character.\n\nBoth stars deliver high-caliber work. You would think Hawke would dominate the show in the flashier part of Lee. He does charismatically command attention, endowing every line with sneering contempt for civilization (represented by Mimi Lien’s kitschy set), barely suppressing animalistic rage, and physically holding back nothing (even appearing to urinate in a potted plant). But Dano is equally fascinating, slowly bringing deeply buried emotions to the surface and unleashing a tornado of anger as fearsome as Hawke’s. The cast is completed by the appropriately smarmy Wilmes as the producer and Marylouise Burke in a hilarious cameo as the boy’s bewildered mother.\n\nMacdonald’s final image is arresting: The normal world of the mom’s kitchen falls away, and the brothers are caught in a standoff in a symbolic desert (brilliantly realized by Lien, Cox, and Poor), a perfect representation of Shepard’s disturbing vision of America.\n\nFebruary 3, 2019\n\nJan 24–March 17.

Foster\n\nFew actors can wring as many variations on self-indulgent despair as Marin Ireland. This Obie winner has created incisive portraits of a party-girl spoiled royal in Marie Antoinette, a narcissistic bisexual activist in In the Wake, and a self-destructive immigrant worker in Ironbound. That’s just to name a few. Now she is a disgraced high school teacher, sucking up oxygen and wrecking lives in Abby Rosebrock’s Blue Ridge at Atlantic Theatre Company. Alison is the newest resident at a Christian halfway house in the mountains of North Carolina. When her abortive affair with her married principal goes south, she takes an axe to his car and must submit to a work program and Bible study. Ireland manages to make this dangerous bundle of nerves a charismatic charmer, gathering attention and even love while wreacking havoc.\n\nHer interactions with her fellow participants and the group’s facilitators form the backbone of Rosebrock’s prickly and moving drama. The dialogue crackles with authentic flavor delivered with intense conviction by Ireland and the ensemble, directed with a feel for empathy by Taibi Magar. There are a few holes in the plot and the denouement feels more than a bit forced, complete with an “out of nowhere” revelation. But Blue Ridge delivers a satisfying insight into the irresistible paths of dysfunction.\n\nChanneling Blanche DuBois, a character she quotes from liberally, Alison feeds on her neurosis and can’t seem to stop screwing up her life and those around her. Ireland gives her a vital, almost irresistible sparkle. Hugging two pillows for support and barely containing her ferocious energy, Ireland expresses Alison’s physical desperation without turning her into a tornado of terror. It’s understandable why friends and lovers are drawn to her.\n\nThere is also fine work from Peter Mark Kendall as the damaged Cole, the latest target of Alison’s obsessive adoration. He appeared to be a reticent Southern-fried macho guy but roiling with insecurities within. On his first entrance, he barely speaks, but each monosyllabic response carries weight. Chris Stack is equally silently eloquent as Hern, the strong, quiet minister running the program. Nicole Lewis is buoyantly vibrant as his co-leader Grace. As Alison’s fellow residents in the program, Kristolyn Lloyd and Kyle Beltran also slowly reveal centers of disquietude beneath seemingly sober surfaces.\n\nAdam Rigg provides the homey group-living environment, which evokes institutionalism, the church, and a woodsy motel. In the play’s final moments, Rigg’s set opens up to reveal gorgeous winter mountain scenery, just as Ireland exposes Alison’s aching interior.\n\nJanuary 17, 2019\n\nJan 7–Jan 26.

Taught in high schools for decades, it recently won a much-publicized PBS poll as the country’s favorite novel. The touching story of a young girl learning hard adult lessons in a Depression-wracked Alabama town through the sage humanity of her compassionate widowed father has been immortalized in an Oscar-winning 1962 film and licensed for community and school groups in an adaptation by Christopher Sergel, but never seen on Broadway. Apparently, Lee’s original story has been deemed out-of-date by new adapter Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing, A Few Good Men).\n\nThe basic spine of the plot remains the same. Six-year-old Jean Louise Finch, nicknamed Scout, recounts the memorable summer when her dad Atticus bravely defended Tom Robinson, an African-American man wrongfully accused of raping a white woman. Scout discovers the inherent racism of her town and the basic kindness of her spooky recluse neighbor Boo Radley as she and her brother Jem and flighty visiting friend Dill (based on the young Truman Capote) take a painful journey from childhood into maturity. To make the material palatable for a modern audience, Sorkin has made significant alterations (Lee’s estate objected and engaged in legal challenges, which were ultimately resolved). Atticus is no longer a white knight rescuing the one-dimensional black community with saintly benevolence. Now he condescends to the black characters and naively underestimates his fellow white citizens’ bigotry. Much of the dialogue feels imposed, including contemporary references to passive aggression and psychological motivations. In addition, Sorkin hits the audience over the head with characters explaining their feelings in italics with exclamation points.\n\nWhat emerges is a bizarre triple-lensed view of Lee’s work. We are looking at a story set in 1934, via Lee’s 1960 perspective then filtered through Sorkin’s 2018 sensibilities. To give the African-American community a stronger sense of agency, the role of Calpurnia, the Finches’ black housekeeper, has been beefed up. She now is on an equal footing with Atticus, and they are described as being like siblings, not boss and employee, with their racial status differences totally wiped out. When Calpurnia speaks as the voice of 21st-century outrage, it sounds like Sorkin talking, not the character.\n\nThe racist Bob Ewell, father of the supposed rape victim Mayella, becomes a spokesperson for aggrieved lower-class whites, and anti-Semitic taunts have been added to his arsenal of invective. In the most egregious change, Atticus explodes at Ewell, twisting his arm and berating him as a lowlife (Atticus Finch—Action Hero!). This physical confrontation may be satisfying for a modern audience accustomed to violence rather than words, but it’s untrue to the restrained and dignified Atticus of the book.\n\nDespite these radical alternations, the evening succeeds in grabbing the audience. Sorkin’s script is fluid and punchy, and director Barlett Sher delivers his usual streamlined production. Miriam Buether’s flexible set conveys a multitude of locations with shifting speed and efficiency. Though they occasionally overplay Sorkin’s preachy and obvious moments, the actors create a convincing and complex community. Jeff Daniels is a compassionate Atticus, while the adult Celia Keenan Bolger skillfully handles the difficult assignment of playing a child and narrating the action. She shares those duties with Will Pullen’s feisty Jem and Gideon Glick’s delightfully talkative Dill. LaTanya Richardson Jackson manages to"
