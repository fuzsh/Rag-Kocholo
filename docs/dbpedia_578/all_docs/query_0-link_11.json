I’ve taught and performed in some prestigious and respected theaters and training institutions on the East and West Coast; producing music videos, a web series and plays. However, my life changed in Hollywood at a Christmas party in 2012; I met Erica Greve of Unlikely Heroes.\n\nAt that time, I was almost completely unaware of the existence of human sex trafficking. I remember being dumbfounded as Erica shared with me the level of devastation she witnessed first hand of many of these young victims: young women and children. She was a registered nurse and knew that no medical treatment or facilities existed to restore these victims in need of substantive aftercare treatment. She had made a decision to commit her life to building, staffing, and operating homes for these young people. And, was presently in the process of raising awareness, raising funds and filling these homes with children she and others had managed to get out of this horrific criminal industry.\n\nI gave her all my contacts of every filmmaker I knew; I wanted to help, hoping that they would shoot footage for her NGO to help fundraise. After Erica met with my contacts, she and I spoke and she said, \"Christina, all the money I raise has to go to the girls.” Everyone had asked to get paid to shoot the footage. It was at this moment I realized acts of service, small and large, were required to fight this fight. This is when I first got the idea for The New Abolitionists.\n\nA year or so later, I sold property back in New York City. I made the decision to do with my money what my heart knew must be done. I began researching and investigating human sex trafficking. I began apprenticing under a documentarian. Then I started shooting; traveling twice to Thailand and Cambodia with a ministry committed to eradicating human sex trafficking. They introduced me to other such like-minded NGO anti-trafficking groups. They, like Erica, were on the frontlines of this fight. They had dedicated their lives, despite a constant and ever present danger to their own personal welfare, to attacking human sex trafficking on every front. And, I got to see the results—the living fruits of their efforts. They were making a difference: one life at a time.\n\nSee More\n\nFLORENCE AYISI\n\nAward-Winning Filmmaker\n\nFLORENCE AYISI was born in Cameroon. She lives and works in the United Kingdom.
