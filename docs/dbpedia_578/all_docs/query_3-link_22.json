His film debut was in 1995 with The Sound of the Carceri, a documentary by filmmaker François Girard, in which he recreated the fictitious prisons of Piranesi around the cellist Yo-Yo Ma in 3D. This work won him an Emmy® Award for « Outstanding Visual Effects » and a Gemini Award for « Best Visual Effects » in 1998.\n\nIn 2008 his company produced the short film Danse Macabre, a multidisciplinary collaboration with Robert Lepage and AnneBruce Falconer, where he acted simultaneously as scriptwriter, director, photographer and editor. This film has won 43 international prizes, notably a Jutra and a Genie Award in 2010.\n\nPedro Pires designed the images for TOTEM, a new Cirque du Soleil show directed by Robert Lepage.\n\nHe is currently working on the feature film Triptyque, a partial adaptation of the play Lipsynch by Robert Lepage, with whom he is sharing the direction.\n\nMoreover, this year he made his first foray in the opera world by designing the images for Siegfried, a segment of Wagner’s Ring produced by the New York Metropolitan Opera.\n\nWhat makes a good video? What stood out about your picks? Clear concept, originality, craftsmanship\n\n(Photo credit: Julie Perreault)"
