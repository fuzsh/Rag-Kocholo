        "text": "Legendary Canadian artist Robert Lepage (The Andersen Project) returns with a reimagined version of his acclaimed Needles and Opium, a cinematic exploration of art, love and addiction, starring Marc Labrèche and Wellesley Robertson III. Still as relevant as when it premiered twenty years ago, Lepage concocts a story triggered by the art of poet/filmmaker Jean Cocteau and American jazz artist Miles Davis, coincidently crossing the Atlantic Ocean in 1949, visiting each other’s cities. Through a hypnotic series of vignettes set in a cube suspended in midair, characters tumble from the boulevards of Paris to the back alleys of New York in this fascinating examination of how the echoes of history affect our daily struggles. With music, magic and Lepage’s signature visual aesthetic, this noir-drenched examination of the soul turns heartbreak into art."
