        "text": "Robert Thomson is widely recognized as one of Canada’s most accomplished lighting designers in theater, opera, and dance. His abiding commitment is to the evolving creative process, seeking influences from text or score, the rehearsal hall, and the collective journey of collaborators. Thomson’s acclaimed designs are noted for their precision, visual poetry, psychological insight, and dramaturgical impact.\n\nOver a distinguished career spanning four decades, Thomson has taken international design assignments in Paris, Stuttgart, Geneva, Hong Kong, Edinburgh, and Melbourne. In the United States, his designs have been featured at the Lincoln Center, Goodman Theatre, Hartford Stage, Brooklyn Academy of Music, Seattle Opera, American Ballet Theatre, San Francisco Ballet, Boston Ballet, and Miami Ballet.\n\nThomson’s career includes extensive experience designing for repertory companies. He served as Resident Lighting Designer for The National Ballet of Canada for twelve seasons, with projects including Swan Lake, Romeo and Juliet, Spring Awakening, The Taming of the Shrew, and Manon. Designing for Canada’s renowned Shaw Festival over 24 seasons (including ten years as Head of Lighting Design), his credits include Picnic, St. Joan, Man and Superman, Pygmalion, Cavalcade, and Cyrano de Bergerac. Over thirteen consecutive seasons with Canada’s prestigious Stratford Festival, North America’s largest repertory company, his numerous collaborators include directors Jonathan Miller, Des McAnuff, Robert Falls, Jennifer Tarver, Peter Hinton, Christopher Newton, and current Artistic Director, Antoni Cimolino. Thomson’s Stratford design assignments include Beaux Stratagem, King Lear, The Merchant of Venice, Much Ado About Nothing, Cymbeline, Caesar and Cleopatra, Dangerous Liaisons, The Taming of the Shrew, Romeo and Juliet, and Into the Woods.\n\nThomson studied theater design at Ryerson University in Toronto and The Studio and Forum of Stage Design in New York. He began his professional career at Toronto’s Tarragon Theatre in the late 70s, working extensively with founding Artistic Director Bill Glassco. Their collaborations on a range of new scripts now represent much of the early canon of Canadian plays. Since then he has worked with diverse companies across Canada, including the National Arts Centre, Canadian Stage, Canadian Opera Company, Citadel Theatre, Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre, Pacific Opera Victoria, Charlottetown Festival, Vancouver Opera, Theatre Calgary, L’Opéra de Montréal, Centaur Theatre, Segal Centre, and Opera de Québec.\n\nThomson has been recognized with numerous awards, including Canada’s largest theater prize: the prestigious Elinore & Lou Siminovitch Prize. Other distinctions include a Sterling Award for Edmonton Opera’s mounting of Robert Lepage’s internationally acclaimed opera, Bluebeard’s Castle and Erwartung, and four of Canada’s coveted Dora Mavor Moore Awards."
