The works they have created, interpreted, produced, supported or disseminated have left a mark on our history, our memory, our space and our hearts. I extend my sincere congratulations to each and every one of them,\" said Ms. Jean.\n\n\"I would also like to express my admiration for the Companions (Compagnes/Compagnons des arts et des lettres) honoured at tonight's ceremony.
