        "text": "You know it’s time to start prepping your New Year’s resolutions once Whistler Film Festival (WFF) rolls in to close out the year.\n\nWFF dropped a press release yesterday to announce its 2019 festival line-up and juries. Now in its 19th edition, this year’s festival runs from December 4th to the 8th in Whistler, B.C., of course. WFF 2019’s slate offers 86 films (comprising of 43 features and 43 shorts from 15 countries), that are, “Dedicated to showcasing meaningful stories that spark conversation.”\n\nWFF 2019 also announced that their line-up includes “11 first-time feature films, 13 feature films directed by women, and 67% of the program premiering Canadian features – more than any other Canadian film festival this year.”\n\nWhistler Film Festival 2019 Press Release:\n\nWFF is set to open this year with the Canadian Premiere of LOST TRANSMISSIONS, directed by Katharine O’Brien starring Simon Pegg and Juno Temple. Pegg (Theo) and Juno (Hannah) shine as LA music scene devotees, each battling their own mental health issues, who decide to abandon their respective medications in their quest for unfettered musical greatness. Simon Pegg, known for STAR TREK, STARS WARS, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE and SHAUN OF THE DEAD, simply stuns with his delicate and empathetic performance as a gifted music producer compelled to listen to the voices dancing in his head. First-time director Katharine O’Brien has created a realistic film about mental illness that will ring true to anyone who has dealt closely with these issues, as well as prove unforgettable to those less familiar with mental health struggles. Both Simon Pegg and Katharine O’Brien are expected to be in attendance for opening night.\n\nHighlights include the Canadian film festival premiere of THE IRISHMAN directed by Martin Scorsese, Canada’s entry in this year’s foreign-language Oscars category ANTIGONE directed by Sophie Deraspe, and Emile Goudreault’s COMPULSIVE LIAR (MENTEUR), the highest grossing Canadian film of the year with over $6M in domestic box office. In addition, the festival will also screen HOPE GAP directed by William Nicholson with Annette Bening and Bill Nighy, THE AERONAUTS directed by Tom Harper starring Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne, as well as ORDINARY LOVE co-directed by Lisa Barros D’Sa and Glenn Leyburn starring Liam Neeson and Lesley Manville and THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS directed by Lone Scherfig starring Zoe Kazan, Jay Baruchel, Caleb Landry Jones and Bill Nighy.\n\nWFF will also feature the World Premiere of CABARETE, a rare film about an aspiring competitive kite-surfer shot on the scenic beaches of the Dominican Republic, and the North American premiere of LIBERTÉ: A CALL TO SPY, an exciting true story about female spies during WWII. The film is an American movie shot partly in Budapest and produced and written by Sarah Megan Thomas and directed by Lydia Dean Pilcher. Canadian Premieres include LOCUSTS, a gripping film noir shot in the Australian outback. WFF will also screen three American Indies, two of which will be gracing Canadian screens for the first time. These films include the Canadian premieres of THE ARTIST’S WIFE, directed by Tom Dolby starring Bruce Dern and Lena Olin, RANGE RUNNERS directed by newcomer Philip S. Plowden, and the Western Canadian Premiere of VIVARIUM, directed by Lorcan Finnegan starring Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots.\n\nClosing the festival is a double-bill of Western Canadian premieres GROSSO’S LOVELETTERS TO CANADA and THE TONY ALVA STORY co-directed by Coan Buddy Nichols & Rick Charnoski. From season 10 of Jeff Grosso’s Love Letters to Skateboarding series, GROSSO’S LOVELETTERS TO CANADA showcases some of Canada’s most iconic skate spots and catches up with local luminaries, from Joe Buffalo in Ottawa to Rob Boyce in Vancouver. The episode will premiere right before THE TONY ALVA STORY, which chronicles skate legend Tony Alva’s humble beginnings on the streets of Santa Monica through his journey to become the godfather of modern-day skateboarding. The film features interviews with Stacey Peralta, Gus Van Sant, Josh Brolin, Steve Olson and Jeff Grosso as well as Alva himself who, at 60 years old, is still shredding everyday.\n\n“The Whistler Film Festival has evolved into a premium showcase for exciting new motion pictures not previously shown at other film festivals, with more and more filmmakers from Canada and abroad entrusting us with their new creations. From Canadian gems to American Indies, our 19th edition delivers compelling and entertaining stories from around the world, welcoming both established names and emerging filmmakers. This year’s lineup is full of familiar faces, fresh discoveries, and inspiring insights into critical issues that reflect today’s culture, and we can’t wait to share them with our audience,” states Paul Gratton, WFF Director of Programming.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nProgramming strands include American Indies, Canadian Vanguard, Discoveries, Doc Bloc, From Overseas, From The Vault, Mountain Culture, New Voices, ShortWork, Special Presentations, Spotlight and World Premieres. Twenty four of WFF’s forty three features are Canadian, English Canadian or World Premiere presentations.\n\nCinematic excellence remains at the heart of the Whistler Film Festival.
