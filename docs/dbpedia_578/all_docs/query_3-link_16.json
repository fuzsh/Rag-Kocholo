        "text": "MONTREAL — Quirky Quebecois moral fable “Maelstrom” has garnered a leading 10 nominations for the 21st Genie Awards, Canada’s equivalent of the Oscars.\n\nThe Genie noms confirm “Maelstrom” as one of the highest-profile Canuck pics of the year. The French-language movie from writer-director Denis Villeneuve snared two prizes at this summer’s Montreal World Film Festival and is the Canadian submission to the Academy Awards for foreign-language movie.\n\nVilleneuve’s sophomore feature toplines thesp Marie-Josee Croze as a woman in the middle of an emotional crisis who accidentally runs over an elderly man.\n\nThe award nominations were announced by the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television at press conferences Tuesday in Montreal and Toronto. The ceremony will take place in Toronto on Jan. 29.\n\nToronto helmer Clement Virgo’s “Love Comes Down” snared nine nominations, low-profile “Here’s to Life” surprised many by landing eight, Allan Moyle’s critically acclaimed “New Waterford Girl” received seven and Montreal-shot thriller “The Art of War” and Quebec helmer Robert Lepage’s “Possible Worlds” each nabbed six."
