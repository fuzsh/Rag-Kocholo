        "text": "TORONTO – Quebec playwright Robert Lepage was named the winner of the prestigious Glenn Gould Prize Thursday morning.\n\nThe award is given biennially to a living person who has enriched the human condition through the arts and communication. The previous honouree was singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen.\n\nLepage is a Canadian actor, playwright and stage director. In 2012, he appeared in the film Mars et Avril.\n\nHe will receive $50,000 and will choose an outstanding young artist to receive the City of Toronto Glenn Gould Protégé Prize of $15,000. Lepage will also receive a statuette by Canadian artist Ruth Abernethy.\n\n“It is a good thing to celebrate excellent but I do think it is important to define what excellence is,” said Lepage, in a statement.\n\n“For me, the excellence of an artist should not be measured only by his successes and achievements but also by his courage and capacity to constantly put himself in danger.”\n\nThe annoucement was made at the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts in Toronto.\n\nTrending Now\n\nParis mayor unleashes series of F-bombs on Olympic opening ceremony critics\n\n‘Slap in the face’: Tenants evicted for demolition, units then posted for higher rent\n\nLepage was selected by an international jury made up of American singer-songwriter Patti Smith, U.S. music producer Bob Ezrin, Canadian filmmaker Deepa Mehta, Canadian author John Ralston Saul, Mexican tenor Rolando Villazon and Hong Kong-based philanthropist Sir David Tang.\n\nA ceremony to present the prize will take place later this year."
