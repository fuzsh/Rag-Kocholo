        "text": "Few contemporary theatre directors enjoy the magnitude of international celebrity granted to Robert Lepage, recipient of the Europe Theatre Prize in 2007 and the Governor General's Performing Arts Award in 2009. Lepage's epic productions have become a mainstay of the international festival scene, lauded for their virtuosic originality as well as the technical sophistication of their transformative mise-en-scène. As a paragon of the canonical avant-garde, Lepage is embraced by the most renowned theatre and opera venues of Europe and North America, a factor that often limits access to his work for theatre-goers in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada. Consequently, the opportunity to see three different Lepage productions in Eastern Canada in fewer than three months is rare and compelling.\n\nPeter Brook claims that the acid test of great theatre has to do with the lingering effects of a performance in the observer's memory. If that's true, then The Dragons' Trilogy (1985), the production that established Lepage as a major talent, remains one of the most haunting and effective pieces of theatre I've ever witnessed. Nearly twenty years later, I still remember the poignancy of two young girls playing with shoeboxes, the simplicity and clarity with which multiple languages were interwoven, the spectacle of the cloth dragon puppets, ice skaters on a field of sand, and my utter astonishment when an actor transformed from one character to another in full view of the audience by removing her nun's habit piece by piece. The relative economy of the production's means, in which a sand-filled parking lot with a small attendant's shack served to evoke a broad range of locales, elicited an extraordinary creativity from its makers, prompting them to rely on the spectators' imaginations and the transformative capacities of the actors' bodies. I can't help but wonder whether the surfeit of resources made available to Lepage as a consequence of his success might paradoxically diminish Ex Machina's work by replacing physical ingenuity and an aesthetic of suggestion with a quasi-cinematic realism achieved by means of high-budget technologies. As the stage mechanics of Ex Machina's work have become progressively more elaborate, has the role of the actors' virtuosity been commensurately limited?\n\nThe Blue Dragon, created in collaboration with Marie Michaud, combines the striking theatricality for which Lepage is celebrated with decidedly atypical structural simplicity and narrative cohesion. Lepage reprises the role of visual artist Pierre LaMontagne, which he originated in The Dragons' Trilogy and subsequently revisited a decade later in The Confessional (1995). While the action of the Trilogy is set primarily within Canada's Chinatowns, Blue Dragon follows its Quebecois characters to twenty-first century Shanghai, where Pierre's erstwhile lover Claire Forêt (Michaud) travels in hope of adopting a child. The Trilogy concludes with Pierre leaving for China to study art. Two decades later, he is a gallery owner and sometime calligrapher, having abandoned his previous installation-based practice. Pierre's artistic sterility is mirrored by Claire's inability to conceive, having prioritized her advertising career in her younger, more fertile years. Although Claire's initial adoption plans are thwarted, the unexpected pregnancy of Pierre's young protégé and current lover Xiao Ling (Tai Wei Foo) renews her maternal aspirations. The fluidity of the female characters' sexuality, which opens possibilities for multiple plot resolutions, rescues the story from potential cliché by positioning the Quebecois characters as rivals for the young Chinese artist's favour. Much of Blue Dragon's strength lies in the resonant juxtaposition of this domestic plotline with a lucid critique of Western consumerism and the anxieties surrounding China's vast economic and political power, moving beyond the Orientalism for..."
