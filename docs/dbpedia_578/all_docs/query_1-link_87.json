        "text": "Professor Robert Le Page, who has died aged 85, was a pioneer of Creole studies and an original, though not uncontroversial, thinker in sociolinguistics. In the West Indies, he is known well beyond the confines of academia, as the co-author of the authoritative Dictionary of Jamaican English, originally published in Britain, but recently republished by the University of the West Indies Press in a paperback edition accessible to more Jamaican speakers.\n\nHe was born in south London, the youngest of five children, attended Christ's Hospital on an LCC scholarship, and initially trained as an accountant. After war service in the Fleet Air Arm, he changed career and read English at Keble College, Oxford. In 1952 he was awarded a doctorate by the University of Birmingham for his thesis, Studies in Early English Prosody. By then he had joined the staff of the English department at the fledgling University College of the West Indies (now University of the West Indies) at Mona, Jamaica.\n\nHe might well have gone on doing research on Old English and lecturing on topics perceived as hardly relevant to the Caribbean, had he not taken on the challenges of two colleagues: Manfred Sandmann, the first professor of modern languages, encouraged him to turn his attention to the language spoken around him, and introduced him to Frederic Cassidy (obituary, July 1 2000), the Jamaican-born American dialectologist, who was in Jamaica at that time; while Philip Sherlock, the vice-principal, handed over to him a collection of \"dialect words and phrases\" entered for a competition organised by the Daily Gleaner, the local paper.\n\nBy 1951 Le Page had embarked on the first linguistic survey of the Caribbean, made contact with others working on Creoles, and by 1959 organised the first international conference on Creole language studies. Together with Cassidy, he began the research which was to lead to the Dictionary of Jamaican English (1967, revised 1980). If its title may be controversial (modern Creolists see it as a dictionary of Jamaican Creole, the term Le Page himself was the first to use in print), the DJE was the first major scholarly dictionary of any English-based Creole and remains a standard reference work to this day.\n\nWhile Le Page may still be remembered at Mona as one of the expats in white shorts, long socks and sandals who peopled the campus in its early years, he was at the same time one of those who laid the foundation for the Caribbeanisation of the curriculum which was to gain momentum in the following decade.\n\nIn 1960, he left Jamaica to establish a department of English at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, and four years later returned to England to become the first professor of language at the University of York. His imprint was firmly stamped on the shape and ethos of the new department, of which he remained head until 1984. The study of Creoles and sociolinguistics became an integral part of the undergraduate programme in linguistics, and postgraduate students flocked to York from all over the world. He never lost touch with the Caribbean. In the 1960s he did work on the education of Caribbean-born children in the UK, and began planning sociolinguistic projects in what is now Belize and in St Lucia, carried out in collaboration with Andr√©e Tabouret-Keller. The publication which arose from this research, Acts of Identity (1985), was a ground-breaking work. The focus on language as an expression of individual or group identity, as well as meaning, had important implications for the definition of what a language is.\n\nLe Page could be a hard taskmaster (rumour has it that while at Kuala Lumpur, he would ring up staff at eight in the morning to ensure they were at work), but he is also remembered for his many acts of kindness, especially by his students. His wonderful sense of fun and humour could express itself in unexpected ways, including verse, such as his prize-winning entry for a Punch competition or his tribute to Cassidy on his retirement, both written in mock Jamaican Creole.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Gina, two sons and two daughters."
