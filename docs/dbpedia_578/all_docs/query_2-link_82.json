        "text": "For 56 years, Canadian Architect has sponsored an annual national awards program, the only national awards that recognize projects in the design stage. The Awards of Excellence are open to all architects registered in Canada and to Canadian architectural graduates for buildings designed in Canada and abroad. Foreign architects are permitted to submit, provided they have partnered with a Canadian-registered architect.\n\nThe competition opens for submissions on August 1, 2023. This year’s deadline for submissions is Monday, September 11, 2023.\n\nProjects must be in the design stage, scheduled for construction or under construction but not substantially complete by September 7, 2023. All projects must be commissioned by a client with the intention to build the submitted proposal. All building types and concisely presented urban design schemes are eligible.\n\nAwards are given for architectural design excellence. Jurors will consider the scheme’s response to the client’s program, site, geographic and/or urban context. They will evaluate its physical organization, form, composition, building systems, concept, process, structure, materials, environmental features and/or demonstration of social awareness.\n\nThis year’s competition also includes the sixth annual Canadian Architect Photo Awards of Excellence. Canadian Architect is challenging professional and non-professional architectural photographers to showcase their best images of a Canadian building in its competition."
