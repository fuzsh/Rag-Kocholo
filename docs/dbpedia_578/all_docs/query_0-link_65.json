Complied by myself, with a foreward by director Patricia Rozema, this is the only reference book of its kind published in English. Wyndham Wise\n\nTake One's Essential Guide to Canadian Film had its genesis in an issue I put together in the summer of 1996 for Take One's celebration of the 100th anniversary of Canadian cinema. This issue featured 100 of the most famous Canadians to have made a living in film, whether at home, in Hollywood or abroad; it engendered a shock of recognition. From the stars of silent movies, such as Walter Huston, Mary Pickford, Norma Shearer, Fay Wray and Marie Dressier, to our current crop of star directors, including Rozema, Robert Lepage, Guy Maddin, Atom Egoyan, David Cronenberg and Denys Arcand, Canadians have made an important, but largely unrecorded contribution to the history of cinema.\n\nEach film title in Take One's Essential Guide is listed with credits, a mini review and significant awards. Biographical listings of directors, producers, actors, writers, animators, cinematographers, distributors, exhibitors and independent filmmakers are accompanied by date and place of birth, date of death if applicable, a brief career overview and a filmography. Take One's Essential Guide is by no means complete. It is a start, a work in progress that will grow with each new edition. Some names and films have been omitted due both to space constraints and the availability of the films to be viewed (always a problem when it comes to Canadian cinema). It is my intention that they will be included in future editions.\n\nTake One's Essential Guide to Canadian Film would not have been possible without the helpful assistance and encouragement of Eve Goldin, senior library technician at The Film Reference Library, Toronto, and contributions from members of Take One's editorial board including: Tom McSorley, the executive director of the Canadian Film Institute in Ottawa; Maurie Alioff, professor at Vanier College in Montreal where he teaches screenwriting; Cynthia Amsden, editor--in--chief of Canadian Weeklies Syndicate; and Matthew Hays, the associate editor of the Montreal weekly Mirror. The following chronology (edited for length) is an excerpt from the Essential Guide, portions of which originally appeared in Take One Nos. 12 and 20.\n\n1896\n\n* The first public screening of a film in Canada takes place on June 28, in Montreal. In July, the Holland brothers introduce Edison's Vitascope to the Canadian public in Ottawa's West End Park. Among the scenes shown is The Kiss, starring May Irwin, an actress from Whitby, Ontario. On August 31 the first screening in Toronto takes place at Robinson's Musee on Yonge Street.\n\n1897\n\n* The first films are shot in Canada. The subject of all three films (for Lumiere, Edison and Biograph) is Niagara Falls.\n\n* Films are screened in vaudeville theatres by travelling showmen who tour them from city to city.\n\n1898\n\n* The Massey--Harris Company of Toronto commissions the Edison Company to produce films to promote its products. This was the first use of film for advertising purposes.\n\n* In December, John Schuberg presents films in Vancouver for the first time.\n\n1902\n\n* The Bioscope Company of Halifax, the first Canadian film--production company, produces a series of scenes for Canadian Pacific Railways to encourage British immigration to Canada.\n\n1903\n\n* Joe Rosenthal directs Hiawatha, The Messiah of the Ojibways, the first dramatic short to be made in Canada.\n\n* Leo--Ernest Ouimet establishes Canada's first film exchange in Montreal.\n\n* Adolph Zukor, a Hungarian--born entrepreneur, opens his first penny arcades in New York and New Jersey. (Zukor became the most influential figure in Canadian film exhibition and distribution.)\n\n1904\n\n* George Scott and Co. make The Great Fire of Toronto. This record of the city's worst fire is first film to be shot in Toronto.\n\n* Zukor opens the first of his palatial movie theatres, the Crystal Hall, in New York City.\n\n1905\n\n* Billy Bitzer shoots two films for Biograph: Moose Hunt in New Brunswick and Salmon Fishing in Quebec. (Bitzer later became D.W. Griffith's main cinematographer.)\n\n1906\n\n* Ouimet opens his \"Ouimetoscope\" in Montreal and films the first Canadian newsreels to show in his theatre.\n\n* The American--born Allen brothers, Jule and Jay, open a storefront theatre in Brantford, Ontario.\n\n1911\n\n* Ontario (followed soon after by Quebec and Manitoba) establishes a Board of Censors to regulate the content of motion pictures, the first in North America.\n\n* The Allens open their first luxury theatre -- the 800--seat Allen Theatre in Calgary.\n\n1912\n\n* Quebec--born Mack Sennett releases the first shorts made by his newly formed Keystone Studios in Los Angeles.\n\n* Adolph Zukor forms Famous Players in Famous Plays Film Company in New York.\n\n1913\n\n* Evangeline, the first Canadian feature, is shot in Nova Scotia by the Bioscope Company.\n\n* Boards of censors are established in British Columbia and Alberta.\n\n1914\n\n* At the outbreak of the First World War, the failure of the United States to enter the war results in a swell of anti-Americanism. Provincial censor boards ban or attempt to curtail \"excessive\" display of the American flag in American films. (The United States entered the war in 1917.)\n\n1915\n\n* Ray Lewis founds the Canadian Moving Picture Digest, Canada's first weekly film trade journal. (She remained editor and publisher until her death in 1954.)\n\n1916\n\n* Adolph Zukor joins forces with Jesse Lasky to form Famous Players--Lasky, with the rights to distribute Mary Pickford films through Paramount Pictures. With a massive loan from the Morgan Bank, Zukor embarks on an ambitious plan to dominate the industry by acquiring motion picture theatres right across North America.\n\n* Minneapolis--born N.L. Nathanson buys his first theatre in Toronto, the Majestic Theatre on Adelaide Street, with the backing of wealthy partners. (Nathanson built Paramount Theatres, a theatre chain that rivalled that of the Aliens.)\n\n1917\n\n* Ontario establishes the Ontario Motion Picture Bureau (OMPB) \"to carry out educational work for farmers, school children, factory workers and other classes.\"\n\n* Canadian National Features of Toronto opens the first film studio in Canada in Trenton, Ontario.\n\n1918\n\n* The federal government follows Ontario's lead and establishes the Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau (CGMPB).\n\n* The Aliens now own the largest and most modern chain of theatres in Canada and have exclusive rights to distribute Goldwyn and Famous Players--Lasky films in Canada.\n\n1919\n\n* Nell Shipman, from Victoria, B.C., writes and stars in Back to God's Country, the most successful silent Canadian film at the box office.\n\n* Zukor sets his sights on Canada and refuses to renegotiate his distribution agreement with the Allens unless they take him into partnership. The Allens refuse.\n\n* Toronto-born Mary Pickford forms United Artists with Charlie Chaplin, D.W. Griffith and Douglas Fairbanks as partners.\n\n1920\n\n* The Canadian Pacific Railways, which has been active in producing films since 1897, incorporates Associated Screen News of Canada (ASN) in Montreal and appoints Ben Norrish, formerly of the CGMPB, as its head. (For the next 38 years ASN was the main Canadian producer of newsreels, shorts and industrials.)\n\n* Zukor buys a substantial part of Paramount Theatres, the rival Canadian chain operated by Nathanson, and incorporates Famous Players Canadian Corp. (FPCC). The Allens, however, continue to grow and expand into the United States.\n\n1921\n\n* The Canadian Motion Picture Distributors Association (CMPDA) is formed. (Although Canadian in name, the association consisted of the Canadian offices of the American distribution majors and was in essence a branch of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association of America.)\n\n1922\n\n* The Allen brothers go bankrupt after an intense bidding war with FPCC.\n\n1924\n\n* The OMPD purchases the studios at Trenton (which had been closed for four years) in an effort to produce films \"for the purpose of preserving Canadian traditions.\" In an opening speech, the provincial treasurer notes: \"Not one per cent of the pictures shown in Canada are made in Great Britain and not one per cent are Canadian made.\"\n\n1926\n\n* Scottish engineering genius John L. Baird gives the first public demonstration of a television system.\n\n1927\n\n* A fire in the Laurier Palace Theatre in Montreal results in the death of 78 children. The Catholic Church in Quebec demands (and gets) a ban on children under 16 from attending cinemas. (This ban remained in place until 1961.)\n\n* Britain passes a bill calling for 25 per cent of all films exhibited in Britain to be British--made by 1935. A British film is defined as one \"made by British subjects in a studio in the British Empire.\"\n\n1928\n\n* Carry on, Sergeantl premieres in Toronto. (It was the most costly film in the history of Canadian silent cinema, but it failed miserably at the box office.)\n\n* Bill Oliver directs and shoots The Beaver People, the first of a series of shorts featuring Grey Owl.\n\n1929\n\n* Sir John Aird, chairman of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, delivers a report to Parliament calling for public ownership of Canadian broadcasting.\n\n* The Bell Telephone labs in the United States demonstrate colour television transmission.\n\n* Mary Pickford wins Best Actress at the second annual Academy Awards for her performance in Coquette.\n\n1930\n\n* Through his holding company Paramount Publix, Zukor acquires direct control of FPCC; FPCC, which owns one--third of all the theatres in Canada, is now 100 per cent American owned.\n\n* Under the Federal Combines Investigation Act, Prime Minister Bennett appoints Peter White to investigate more than 100 complaints against American film interests operating in Canada. White's report concludes that FPCC is a combine \"detrimental to the Public Interest.\" The provinces of Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia take FPCC and the American distribution cartel to court in Ontario.\n\n* Montreal--born Norma Shearer wins the Best Actress at the Academy Awards for The Divorcee; her brother, Douglas, wins the first--ever Academy Award for sound recording. (This has been the only time in the history of the Academy that a brother and sister have won awards at the same ceremony.)\n\n1931\n\n* Ontario passes the British Film Quota Act, but never enforces its provisions.\n\n* Canadian--born comedian Marie Dressler wins an Academy Award for her performance in Min and Bill.\n\n1932\n\n* After a lengthy trial, FPCC and other defendants are found not guilty on three counts of conspiracy and combination.\" A decision against the U.S. cartel would have been a historic turning point for the future of flimmaking in Canada, but it was not to be.\n\n* The Ontario Board of Censors imposes a newsreel quota and insists on the inclusion of a percentage of Canadian and British footage. (This quota remained in force as long as newsreels were shown in Ontario.)\n\n* Gordon Sparling directs The Pathfinder, his first theatrical short in the Canadian Cameo series for ASN.\n\n* The Parliament of Canada passes the first Broadcasting Act, creating the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (CRBC) to engage in broadcasting and to regulate all broadcasting in Canada.\n\n1933\n\n* Fay Wray from Cardston, Alberta, finds cinematic immortality screaming atop the Empire State Building in King Kong.\n\n1934\n\n* Mitcheil Hepburn's Liberal government closes down the OMPD, and the Trenton studios are donated to the city of Trenton for a community hall -- a sad end to one of Canada's earliest and busiest film studios.\n\n1935\n\n* Nat Taylor forms the Independent Theatres Association of Ontario.\n\n* The National Film Society of Canada is founded. (In 1950 this organization became the Canadian Film Institute.)\n\n1936\n\n* Columbia Pictures establishes Central Films of Victoria British Columbia. (During the late 1930s, this company made 14 B movies -- \"quota quickies\" -- for the British market with such rising stars as Rita Hayworth.)\n\n* ASN builds Canada's largest sound studio in Montreal.\n\n* The CRBC becomes the Canadian Broadcasting Corp./Societe Radio-Canada (CBC/SRC).\n\n1938\n\n* Noted documentary filmmaker John Grierson is invited to Canada from England to study government film production. His report leads to the creation of the National Film Board of Canada (NFB).\n\n* The British quota system is revised to exclude films made in the Commonwealth.\n\n* Winnipeg--born Deanna Durbin shares an Academy Award with Mickey Rooney for \"bringing to the screen the spirit and personification of youth.\"\n\n1939\n\n* Parliament passes the National Film Act creating the NFB.\n\n* Grierson becomes Canada's first film commissioner, and the NFB concludes distribution agreements with FPCC and The March of Time in the United States. Grierson appoints British documentary filmmaker Stuart Legg as the director of production.\n\n* Budge and Judith Crawley shoot their first sponsored film, Canadian Power, for the Canadian Geographical Society.\n\n1940\n\n* With the release of Atlantic Patrol, the NFB launches its first theatrical series, Canada Carries On.\n\n1941\n\n* The CGMPB is absorbed by the NFB. Scottish animator Norman McLaren is hired to organize the NFB's animation unit. His first film for the Board is Mail Early.\n\n* Quebec establishes Le Service de CinephotographLe de la Province de Quebec, a central organization to coordinate film activity in the province.\n\n* N.L.

Now both the major exhibition chains in Canada are foreign--owned.\n\n* In the first move to classify films in North America, the Ontario Board of Censors imposes an \"Adult Entertainment\" rating.\n\n1948\n\n* Minister of Trade and Commerce, Clarence D. Howe, meets with the Motion Picture Association of America and accepts to the infamous Canadian Cooperation Project. Hollywood promises to make films in Canada, distribute more NFB work stateside, export fewer \"low-toned\" gangster films to Canada and make reference to Canada in feature films. FPCC's profits are not restricted and the idea of an exhibition quota is dropped.\n\n* Nat Taylor opens North America's first twin cinema in Ottawa.\n\n* CBC Radio launches \"This Week at the Movies\" with host Gerald Pratley, the first radio program to deal seriously with film appreciation.\n\n* In August, the first television seen in Canada is shown at the Canadian National Exhibition; in October, patrons of the Horseshoe Tavern in downtown Toronto watch the World Series on television via a signal provided by WBEN--TV out of Buffalo, New York.\n\n* The Association of Motion Picture Producers and Laboratories of Canada is created, as is the Toronto Film Society.\n\n1949\n\n* Allegations concerning the existence of Communist cells in the NFB are spearheaded by a red--scare press campaign and the Opposition in Parliament.

Each station offers about 18 hours of programming a week. There are 146,000 households with television sets in Canada.\n\n* Hockey Night in Canada/La Soiree du hockey goes on air; the first games are broadcast October 11 on the French network (Montreal vs. Detroit) and and November 1 on the English broadcast (Toronto vs. Boston). (This national tradition became the longest running and the most popular show in the history of Canadian television.)\n\n1953\n\n* Tit--coq wins Film of the Year and Best Feature Film at the Canadian Film Awards.

(The name of this classification was later changed to \"Restricted.\")\n\n* Roger Lemelin's La Famille Plouffe, a hit from radio, goes on air in Montreal and immediately becomes the most popular show on the French television network.

(This portable, realistic approach to filmmaking captured the attention of French documentary filmmaker Jean Rouch, influenced the French New Wave, and held sway over the documentary movement in Canada for more than a generation.)\n\n* A Dangerous Age is released theatrically in England, but can't find Canadian distribution. Furie moves to England and tells the British press: \"I wanted to start a Canadian film industry, but nobody cared.\"\n\n* The Fowler Report results in the Broadcasting Act, which establishes the Board of Broadcast Governors (BBG) to regulate all Canadian broadcasting and sets the stage for the licensing of private broadcasters.

(Over its 10--year lifespan, this show became one of the most beloved programs ever produced by CBC--TV.)\n\n* The CBC/SRC microwave network is extended to Newfoundland.\n\n1960\n\n* The BBG licenses four private broadcasters to compete with the CBC/SRC: Tele--Metropole and CFCF in Montreal; CFTO in Toronto; BCTV in Vancouver.\n\n* At Cannes, The Back--Breaking Leaf wins top prize for television documentary and Universe wins the Jury Prize for animation.\n\n1961\n\n* The CTV Network goes on air in October. (CTV, Canada's largest private television network, was set up as a rather unmanageable cooperative. Each owner -- no matter how many stations they own -- had a veto and a single vote on the executive board -- an arrangement that made for a very unhappy partnership. After decades of corporate machinations, Toronto--based Baton Broadcasting took over ownership in 1997.)\n\n* Nat Taylor produces The Mask. (This 3--D film was the first Canadian feature to be extensively shown in the United States; it was distributed by Warner Bros.)\n\n* Quebec schools are once again allowed to screen NFB films.\n\n* The operations of the Stratford International Film Festival are suspended.\n\n1962\n\n* Crawley Films produces The Tales of the Wizard of Oz, the first animated series for television.\n\n1963\n\n* The Liberal government in Ottawa establishes an Inter--Departmental Committee on the Possible Development of a Feature Film Industry in Canada with NFB film commissioner Guy Roberge as chair.\n\n* Don Owen directs Nobody Waved Good--Bye for the NFB, the first film to give Toronto a cinematic identity; Claude Jutra does the same for Montreal with A tout prendre.\n\n* Allan King and Don Haig establish Film Arts as an editing and post--production facility in Toronto, with the CBC as their\n\n* Pierre Perrault's and Michel Brault's Pour la suite du monde is broadcast on SRC and draws an audience of half--a--million.\n\n* The Province of Ontario creates the Ontario Arts Council; the Council's mandate includes funding films of an experimental nature.\n\n* Canada signs its first co--production agreement -- with France.\n\n* The Alliance of Canadian Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA) is formed. (In 1984, the organization is restructed under the name Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists.)\n\n1964\n\n* The theatrical release of Nobody Waved Good--Bye in Toronto marks the beginning of an English--Canadian feature--film culture. (The film opened first in New York; only after favourable reviews did the NFB agreed to its release in Canada.)\n\n* This Hour Has Seven Days premieres on CBC--TV. (This one--hour weekly show, produced by Douglas Leiterman and Patrick Watson, became one of the most controversial and influential shows ever run on the CBC. Its original mixture of satirical music, investigative film reports and confrontational and aggressive interviews made it hugely popular. At its peak in March 1966, This Hour's ratings were second only to Hockey Night in Canada.)\n\n* The federal cabinet approves in principle the establishment of a loan fund to foster and promote the development of a feature--film fund.\n\n* Guy L. Cote and Michel Patenaude found La Cinematheque canadienne.\n\n* The Yorkton Short Film Festival begins in Saskatchewan.\n\n* The Committee on Broadcasting, chaired by Robert Fowler, is established.\n\n1965\n\n* The Report of Film Distribution: Practices, Problems and Prospects by O.J. Firestone, is released. (The report recommended an increase in the CCA allowed to producers, the initiation of joint international film agreements and the establishment of a film--development corporation. Most of of Firestone's recommendations were eventually adopted, but never as a comprehensive package.)\n\n* Beryl For's The Mills of the Gods: Viet Nam broadcast on CBC's Documentary series and wins Film of the Year at the Canadian Film Awards.\n\n* The Committee on Broadcasting recommends a new authority to replace the BBG. By now more than 90 per cent of Canadian households have television sets.\n\n* The Ontario Film Association is formed out of the Ontario Association of Film Councils.\n\n1966\n\n* The CBC brass cancels This Hour Has Seven Days. Patrick Watson is taken off the air and his co--host, Laurier LaPierre, is fired for crying over a story about the Stephen Truscott trial. The forerunner to W5 and 60 Minutes comes to an abrupt and controversial end.\n\n* CTV launches W5. (This program is now the longest--running public--affairs program in North America.)\n\n* Wojeck with John Vernon as a crusading coroner, runs on the CBC for two seasons. (This series, shot on the streets of Toronto using direct--cinema techniques, set new standards for realistic drama.)\n\n* The original Take One magazine, published and edited by Peter Lebensold and Adam Symansky from Montreal, makes its debut. (The magazine later moved to Toronto and continue publishing until 1979.)\n\n1967\n\n* The NFB presents Labyrinth, a groundbreaking multi--screen presentation at Expo 67.\n\n* The NFB launches the Challenge for Change program.\n\n* The Canadian Filmmakers Distribution Centre, the first of the alternative distribution cooperatives to spring--up across the country, is established in Toronto.\n\n* Toronto--born and CBC--trained Norman Jewison receives an Academy Award nomination for his direction of the groundbreaking U.S. racial drama in the Heat of the Night, the film wins five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and Jewison receives his first of three nominations for Best Director.\n\n1968\n\n* The Canadian Film Development Corp. (CFDC) opens for business in February with a budget of $10 million. (However, because no effort was made to affect the distribution and exhibition of films in Canada, the films financed by the CFDC were seen by few Canadians.)\n\n* The 1967--8 Broadcasting Act creates the Canadian Radio--Television Commission (CRTC), with Pierre Juneau as the first chairman.
