        "text": "This well-documented and generously illustrated book is a fascinating\n\nhistory of the growth of the Canadian film industry.\n\nIt is hard to believe that more than 50 years have passed since Budge\n\nCrawley, Claude Jutra, and Norman McLaren were among the recipients of\n\nawards at the first Canadian Film Awards (CFA) ceremony, attended by\n\nPrime Minister Louis St. Laurent, in 1949. Since then, Canadian\n\nproducers, directors, actors, and technicians have become global\n\ncelebrities, reaping awards worldwide. The book’s text and photographs\n\nprovide a fascinating look at the development of the industry in Canada\n\nand its many players.\n\nMary Pickford is shown hosting the CFA in 1951. John Grierson is a\n\nspecial award recipient in 1957, and documentarian Donald Brittain is\n\nhonored in 1964. Richard Leiterman receives an award for cinematography\n\nin 1976. Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau is an enthusiastic guest\n\nat the 1981 ceremony at which Kate Reid, Marie Tifo, Joel Michaels, and\n\nGarth Drabinsky were among the Genie recipients, as the awards\n\nthemselves came to be known. In the 1990s, award winners included Robert\n\nLantos, Robert Lepage, David Cronenberg, and Atom Egoyan.\n\nThis book is a wonderful tribute to, and remembrance of, the many\n\ncreative individuals whose contributions to Canadian film were honored.\n\nIt is also a valuable study and record of the “often turbulent\n\nevolution” of the CFA and the industry itself from 1949 to 1999."
