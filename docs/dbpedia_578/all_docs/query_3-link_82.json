        "text": "The Western portion of nominees for this year’s Genie Awards is a bit thin—especially if you rule out the folks living in Winnipeg or Los Angeles. Only a few of the 12 Western nominees showed up on March 25 for a reception at the new Shangri-La Hotel in downtown Vancouver.\n\nOf these, the most plentiful were the makers of Normal, including director and coproducer Carl Bessai, writer Travis McDonald, and producer Andrew Boutilier.\n\nAlso on hand was cinematographer Gregory Middleton, nominated for his colourful, globetrotting work on Jeremy Podeswa’s impressive Fugitive Pieces, which got precious few other nods. Its supporting-actor nominee Rade Serbedzija is pitted against our own Callum Keith Rennie (also for Normal) and the dull Emotional Arithmetic’s Max von Sydow, among others.\n\nElsewhere, documentary maker Benoí®t Pilon’s first feature foray, The Necessities of Life, is up for eight awards, although only a few will likely be handed over on Saturday (April 4), when the show is broadcast from Ottawa on Global starting at 9 p.m. Necessities, a beautifully crafted study of pre-electricity Inuit life and of French Canada still in the grip of Catholic institutions, recently opened here.\n\nIts quietly charismatic star, Natar Ungalaaq (The Fast Runner himself), has a shot at winning the top acting honours. (He already won best actor awards from the Vancouver Film Critics Circle, Palm Springs International Film Festival, and Quebec's Jutra Awards.)\n\nIt would be swell if the flick garnered at least a music Genie, too, even if composer Robert M. Lepage does have a confusing name for academy voters. (It’s almost the same as that of the better-known theatre and film guy).\n\nFor top actress, expect a tight race between Preity Zinta for Deepa Mehta’s Heaven on Earth and Ellen Burstyn for The Stone Angel, although the latter split her role with Christine Horne, who was inexplicably shut out of the noms. The Stone Angel received surprisingly few nominations, anyway, considering what a Canlit evergreen it was based on.\n\nNominal westerner Guy Maddin’s My Winnipeg will prove too idiosyncratic to be named top doc, so Yung Chang’s elegant Up the Yangtze will no doubt get that gravy. Top picture, and grabber of several technical awards, will be Paul Gross’s Passchendaele, whose set decorator, Janice Blackie-Goodine, is also a Left Coaster. Critics didn’t care for the soggy First World War epic, to say the least, but academy voters want to keep working for the major players.\n\nMany other noms were given to French-language flicks that few outside of Quebec have heard of, let alone seen. (Yves-Christian Fournier’s Tout est parfait should come our way eventually.)\n\nOverall, it was an unusually weak year for domestic productions in B.C. Vancouver-based writer-director Charles Martin Smith was at the reception; his Stone of Destiny is in theatres right now, which is more than we can say about any other B.C.–born effort."
