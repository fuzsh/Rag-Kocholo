A special award has been created to recognize his long career as an arts advocate and leader.\n\nNews of the honour came as a surprise to Herrndorf, who has spoken with many of the dozens of artists who have received GGPA awards over the years, from Joni Mitchell and Leonard Cohen to Robert Lepage and Christopher Plummer.\n\n“In every case they tell me how moved and honoured they are,” Herrndorf said. “I’m surprised to find myself in the same situation, deeply honoured and moved.”\n\nThe award marks a full-circle moment for the 77-year-old. In 1992, he and a music-industry colleague, Brian Robertson, brought their pitch for creating the highest honour in the land for artists to then-governor general Ramon Hnatyshyn, who was a keen supporter.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“There were several goals,” Herrndorf said. “One was to bring prestige and honour to artists who were doing exceptional work but may not have been as recognized as they needed to be. Another was to make sure that francophone artists became much better known in English-speaking Canada, and English-speaking artists became known in French-speaking Canada.”\n\nUnder the patronage of Gov. Gen. Julie Payette, this year Herrndorf is being recognized for his leadership. He was a journalist, broadcaster and avid NAC patron before he took the helm of the Ottawa institution almost 19 years ago.\n\n“I had always been very impressed with the artists it attracted, the size and complexity of the place,” he said, “but I was also nervous about the state it was in. Ultimately I thought it was so important to the country, and such an interesting challenge that it proved irresistible. It was a great decision. I’ve loved the 19 years. It’s been one of those dream jobs. I work with terrific people. It’s been fun, and very rewarding.”\n\nHe’s credited with transforming the NAC — North America’s only multidisciplinary, bilingual performing arts centre — into an artistically vibrant and financially viable entity. He oversaw the recent $225.4-million architectural rejuvenation of the institution, and was instrumental in launching the new department of Indigenous theatre, which is gearing up for its debut season in 2019.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nUntil now, his work has always been behind the scenes. “As I’ve said so many times, nobody ever bought a ticket to see Peter Herrndorf chair a meeting,” he jokes.\n\nOne of the secrets to Herrndorf’s success at the NAC has been his support of women in positions of leadership. Many of the centre’s artistic directors and senior managers are women, including English theatre’s Jillian Keiley, NAC Presents’ Heather Gibson and dance producer Cathy Levy, to name a few.\n\n“This is an organization that has benefited tremendously from very gifted women, both on the artistic side and the management side in the performing arts,” he said. “It’s really thrilling when you see women of this calibre have the kind of impact they’re having. In many ways, we’re the poster child for the women’s movement.”\n\nThe laureates will be toasted during a series of events, culminating in a black-tie gala at the NAC on June 2, Herrndorf’s last day of work at the centre.\n\nAll 9 Photos for Gallery\n\nFunction Not Available\n\nFull Screen is not supported on this browser version.\n\nYou may use a different browser or device to view this in full screen.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nHere’s the complete list of 2018 winners announced Thursday:\n\nAngela Hewitt: The Ottawa-born classical pianist, a four-time Juno winner, is considered the world’s foremost interpreter of Bach.
