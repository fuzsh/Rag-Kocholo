At the same time, the act of filming any space is clearly an act of discourse production..., prey to complex elision, condensation and repression and as dependent on previous acts of discourse production as on relationships with the 'real' world.\n\nThis is a tension we must simply live with.1\n\nThese remarks, especially the abrupt final paragraph-sentence, demand taking up. To begin, I would observe that recognition of the inevitable ideological content of an individual response to a representation need not pre-empt or invalidate that response: the personal/local recognition of presence and familiarity and the academic/theoretical apprehension of absence and strangeness can be productively combined in an assessment of a particular cultural product. The first kind of response may even be necessary to the second: it is hard to account for what is elided, condensed, or displaced without having registered what is present. McArthur's remarks seem particularly provocative from a contemporary Canadian point of view. How exactly should Canadians live, simply or otherwise, with the tension McArthur describes, when many Canadian audiences still have a shortage of films to which they can respond with the pleasurable recognition McArthur mentions, or with other strong forms of identification?\n\nMoreover, when Canadian cinematic images are available, their recognition by Canadian audiences is not always a straightforward process: it is challenged by, among other things, the distances, both material and ideological, between Canadian communities. Peter Harcourt remarks that \"[t]he political walls of ideological regionalism can only be surmounted by cultural bridges,\" but such structures can be difficult to build and to maintain, and they are not always used when they are available.2 While Robert Lepage's Le Confessionnal (Canada, 1995) was acclaimed at Cannes, and later at the Genie Awards, its Canadian premiere was complicated, and perhaps partly undermined, by political and commercial rivalry between the Toronto and Montreal film festivals.3 After its Toronto premiere, the film opened its regular run in the city to half-full theatres.4 Critical response has been fairly extensive and appreciative, yet remains far from exhaustive. By investigating one of Le Confessionnal's less obvious allus...\n\n[ to view the rest of the article, please try one of the links above ]\n\nPETER CLANDFIELD holds a PhD from Queen's University, where he has taught courses in film and in twentieth‑century literature.
