        "text": "The Ottawa International Animation Festival announced its 2016 winners last night at an award ceremony held at the Saint Brigid’s Center for the Arts.\n\nThe grand prize for short film was a shocker to many attendees: Diane Obomsawin’s new NFB short J’aime Les Filles (I Like Girls). The simplistic film, a short series of vignettes about women recounting their first memories of homosexual desire, wasn’t particularly notable artistically or narratively, yet managed to come out on top.\n\n“We were delighted by the charming coming of age tales, told from different perspectives,” said the short jury members–Ann Marie Fleming (Canada), Brooke Keesling (USA), and Sarina Nihei (Japan). “Fresh, funny, sweet. The vignettes were strong. The design and colors were excellent. Simple, lovely animation.”\n\nThe top feature prize was awarded to Jean-François Laguionie’s Louise en hiver. The feature jury was comprised of Giannalberto Bendazzi (Italy), Peter Millard (UK), and Elise Simard (Canada).\n\nA complete list of Ottawa’s 2016 winners is below:\n\nOTTAWA 2016 AWARDS\n\nNelvana Grand Prize for Independent Short Animation\n\nJ’aime Les Filles (I Like Girls)\n\nDiane Obomsawin (Canada, 2016)\n\nGrand Prize for Best Animated Feature\n\nLouise en hiver\n\nJean-François Laguionie (France/Canada, 2016)\n\nCATEGORY AWARDS\n\nCartoon Network Award for Best Narrative Short Animation\n\nBlind Vaysha\n\nTheodore Ushev (Canada, 2016)\n\nAward for Best Experimental or Abstract Animation\n\nDatum Point\n\nRyo Orikasa (Japan, 2015)\n\nAward for Best Undergraduate Animation\n\nForeign Body\n\nMarta Magnuska (Poland, 2016)\n\nWalt Disney Animation Award for Best Graduation Animation\n\nFrankfurter Str. 99\n\nEvgenia Gostrer (Germany, 2016)\n\nAward for Best Commissioned Animation\n\nHonda “Paper”\n\nPes (USA, 2015)\n\nAward for Best Short Film Made for Young Audiences\n\nThree Little Ninjas Delivery Service\n\nKarim Rhellam, Kim Claeys (Belgium, 2016)\n\nAward for Best Short Film Made for Young Audiences (Honorable Mentions)\n\nAccidents, Blunder and Calamities\n\nJames Cunningham (New Zealand)\n\nNovembre\n\nMarjolaine Perreten (France)\n\nAward for Best Animated Series Made for Young Audiences\n\nShaun the Sheep “The Farmer’s Llamas”\n\nJay Grace (UK, 2015)\n\nAward for Best Animated Series Made for Young Audiences (Honorable Mentions)\n\nSummer Camp Island\n\nJulia Pott (USA)\n\nHey Duggee “The Omelette Badge”\n\nGrant Orchard (UK)\n\nCRAFT AWARDS\n\nAward for Best Script\n\nFired on Mars\n\nNick Vokey, Nate Sherman (USA, 2016)\n\nAward for Best Design\n\nThe Absence of Eddy Table\n\nRune Spaans (Norway, 2016)\n\nAward for Best Animation Technique\n\nVelodrool\n\nSander Joon (Estonia, 2015)\n\nAward for Best Sound\n\nSquame\n\nNicolas Brault (Canada, 2015)\n\nOTHER AWARDS\n\nDHX Public Prize\n\nFired on Mars\n\nNick Vokey, Nate Sherman (USA, 2016)\n\nCanadian Film Institute Award for Best Canadian Animation\n\nBlind Vaysha\n\nTheodore Ushev (Canada, 2016)\n\nCanadian Film Institute Award for Best Canadian Animation (Honorable Mentions)\n\n4min15 au révélateur\n\nMoia Jobin-Paré\n\nBegone Dull Care\n\nPaul Johnson\n\nVIA Rail Award for Best Canadian Student Animation\n\nNihil\n\nKhoebe Magsaysay (Sheridan College, 2016)\n\nVIA Rail Award for Best Canadian Student Animation (Honorable Mentions)"
