        "text": "The Quebec stage director Robert Lepage canceled the production of his theater piece “Kanata” after some of the show’s producers withdrew from the project. Mr. Lepage, who made the announcement on Thursday, and his collaborators in the French theater group Théâtre du Soleil had been criticized for not casting any Indigenous Canadians in the production, which focuses, in part, on the struggles of Indigenous communities in Canada throughout the country’s history.\n\nWithout the financial support of these producers, Mr. Lepage said, “we are unable to finish creating ‘Kanata’ with Théâtre du Soleil. Therefore we are putting an end to the project.”\n\n“Kanata” was set to debut in Paris in December, with a run in Quebec scheduled for 2020.\n\nOn July 14 a group led by Indigenous activists, artists and academics wrote an open letter in Le Devoir, a Quebec daily, responding to comments made in that newspaper by Ariane Mnouchkine, the director of Théâtre du Soleil.\n\n“She likes our stories, but she does not like our voices,” it said. The letter, which emphasized that its aim was not censorship, also highlighted the lack of opportunities and funding for Indigenous artists in Canada.\n\nAfter the letter’s publication, Mr. Lepage and Ms. Mnouchkine met with the signatories to discuss the production.\n\n“The participants of the meeting were very open and we felt that many of our exchanges were productive,” Mr. Lepage and his company, Ex Machina, said in a statement. “Nevertheless, the infinitely complex and often aggressive controversy surrounding the show has in the meantime reached the North American co-producers that were interested in it, and certain ones have now announced their withdrawal.”\n\nMaïtée Labrecque-Saganash, one of the letter’s signatories and an Indigenous activist and writer, said she was displeased that the production had been canceled but disputed Mr. Lepage’s account of the meeting.\n\n“I’m pretty disappointed because we really made a lot of suggestions and instead of working with us, he basically said, ‘No, I’m not changing anything’” she said in a phone interview. Ms. Labrecque-Saganash added, “If he decided to work with us, maybe his co-producers wouldn’t have backed off.”\n\nEarlier this month a production of Mr. Lepage’s “Slav” at the Montreal International Jazz Festival was canceled after only two performances because of protests. The show was inspired by “traditional African-American slave and work songs,” but the cast was predominantly white."
