To allow a more accurate identification of the risks associated with environmental exposures and developing more targeted public health interventions, it is crucial that population-based studies account for the complexity of such exposures as environmental mixtures. This poses several analytic challenges and often requires the use of extensions of standard regression approaches or more flexible techinques for high-dimensional data. This document presents an extended version of the class material that was used in an introductory two-weeks course on statistical approaches for environmental mixtures. The main challanges and limitations of standard regression techniques are outlined, and recent methodological developments are introduced in a rigorous yet non-theoretical way. The course was designed for students and postdocs in environmental health with basic preliminary knoweldge on linear and logistic regression models. Sources and code examples to conduct a thorough analysis in R are also included. Read more →\n\nThis is a textbook for teaching a first introduction to data science.

In this thesis, I investigate the nature of these systems and their interplay at three levels of the experimental structure—namely, individuals, words and tasks. In Study 1, I contributed to a multi-lab replication of the object orientation effect, which has been used to test sensorimotor simulation. The effect did not appear in any of the 18 languages examined, and it was not influenced by individual differences in mental rotation. Next, in Study 2, we drew on three existing data sets that implemented semantic priming, semantic decision and lexical decision. We extended these data sets with measures of language-based and vision-based information, and analysed their interactions with participants’ vocabulary size and gender, and with presentation speed. The analysis had a conservative structure of fixed and random effects. First, we found that language-based information was more important than vision-based information. Second, in the semantic priming study—whose task required distinguishing between words and nonwords—, both language-based and vision-based information were more influential when words were presented faster. Third, a ‘task-relevance advantage’ was identified in higher-vocabulary participants. Specifically, in lexical decision, higher-vocabulary participants were more sensitive to language-based information than lower-vocabulary participants, whereas in semantic decision, higher-vocabulary participants were more sensitive to word concreteness. Fourth, we demonstrated the influence of the analytical method on the results. Last, we estimated the sample size required to investigate various effects. We found that 300 participants were sufficient to examine the effect of language-based information in words, whereas more than 1,000 participants were necessary to examine the effect of vision-based information and the interactions of both former variables with vocabulary size, gender and presentation speed. This power analysis suggests that larger sample sizes are necessary to investigate perceptual simulation and individual differences in conceptual processing.

However, migration data is often of poor quality, missing or provided without disaggregation. Methods to estimate migration flows have been developed by demographers and other researchers to help address shortfalls and provide a platform to better understand patterns, trends and consequences. This manaul explores methods for measuring, estimating and visualising migration flow data, and their implementation in R. Readers will become familiar with useful R functions for handling migration data, a range of measures to summarise and compare migration systems, common estimation methods to overcome inadequate or missing migration data and recently developed methods to visualize complex migration patterns. While plenty of code samples and exercises are provided throughout the manual to build up the readers experience, some prior knowledge is required on how to handle and plot data using the tidyverse set of R packages.

[…] This book is still a work in progress If you encounter any errors/issues, you can reach me here. This booklet offers an introduction to Bayesian inference. We look at how different models make different claims about a parameter, how they learn from observed data, and how we can compare these models to each other. We illustrate these ideas through an informal beer-tasting experiment conducted at the University of Amsterdam.1 A key concept in Bayesian inference is predictive quality: how well did a model, or … Read more →\n\nLearn Mathematics and Computer Science with Isabelle […] The goal is to develop deep understanding in mathematics while at the same time also learn Isabelle and its standard library.

Yet for these benefits to be realised, data science initiatives must be designed and executed in a sensible way. Often these projects, while successful from a scientific standpoint, miss the mark in terms of business impact. Many business leaders are left feeling unsettled, balancing the need for innovation and the adoption of revolutionary technologies with an uncomfortable degree of uncertainty and risk of failure. For the data scientist the situation can be equally unnerving, with uncertainties about how to deliver a successful project when the path is not clear. Yet, these uncertainties and risks – for the business leader and the data scientist alike – can be controlled and managed if approached in a sensible manner. Your authors have designed and delivered hundreds of projects across a wide range of industries. We have made many mistakes, and in the process we have learned what works well and where the common pitfalls lie. We wrote this book to share our experiences in hopes that it will help the reader – whether a data science practitioner or a business leader – reduce these risks and design projects that have the greatest chance of success. Much of the content in this guide is derived from lessons we have given to our students. Here we have gathered, organised and expanded on those bits of advice to serve as a resource for anyone considering embarking on a data science journey. We share our approach to data science projects, addressing topics such as alignment to business imperatives, project design, project delivery and evaluation of success. Data science can be an exciting, invigorating field, and for the business leader, it can bring about revolutionary changes to an organisation that can come with huge returns on investment and value added. For the data scientist, designing and delivering successful projects is rewarding, stimulating and tremendously gratifying. We hope this guide gives you the confidence to understand the risks and approach your project in a sensible way.

This is an important step in helping to ensure that the study achieves the outcomes it set out to achieve. As you may be able to imagine, if the sample size is not big enough, then the results of the study may not be strong enough to draw any significant or meaningful conclusions. On the other hand, increasing the sample size can come at a cost in many situations. This is why choosing an appropriate sample size is so important - so that a balance between … Read more →\n\nIntroduction to R for Econometrics […] This is a short introduction to R to go with the first year econometrics courses at the Tinbergen Institute.

There have been some rule changes to the points scoring system over that time, but clearly some scores are going to be more likely than others. As a touchdown plus extra point is worth 7, we’d expect a higher amount of games with multiples of 7 in the scoreline. Similarly, we’d expect more scorelines with multiples of 3 (the number of extra points).

[…] The idea behind the “no-arbitrage” principle can be summarized in a few words: there is no such thing as a free lunch. In other words, the financial markets will not allow you to get a risk-free profit. A simple example of arbitrage is when a foreign currency is traded on two markets with different exchange rates. Suppose that you can exchange euros to pounds in London at a rate of e1.15 per pound, and in Paris at e1.16 per pound. Then it would be possible to get a guaranteed profit by exchanging one pound for e1.16 in Paris and then exchanging … Read more →\n\nThis is the class note for recitation 7. […] Note that the plot might be different. In this plot, the simulated line is heavily influenced by the extreme value at around ((9,-10)). One way to make linear models more robust is to use a different distance measure. For example, instead of root-mean-squared distance, you could use mean-absolute distance: We can see that the simulated line is less affected by the extreme value. One challenge with performing numerical optimization is that it’s only guaranteed to find one local optimum.

The main reason is that money due in the future or locked in a fixed term account cannot be spent right away. One would therefore expect to be compensated for postponed consumption. In addition, prices may rise in the meantime and the amount will not have the same purchasing power as it would have at present. Finally, there is always a risk, even if a negligible one, that the money will never be received.
