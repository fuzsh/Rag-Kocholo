TORONTO — Robert Lepage’s “La face cachee de la lune” (The Far Side of the Moon) will serve as Canada’s foreign-language candidate for the Oscars.

Pic is hoping to repeat the success of the country’s “The Barbarian Invasions,” which won at this year’s ceremony.

It’s the fifth feature from Lepage (“No,” “Possible Worlds”), who wrote and stars in the French-language comedy about two brothers attempting to reconcile after their mother’s death.

Pic is produced by Media Principia and Films FCL, distributed in Canada by Alliance Atlantis Vivafilm and repped internationally by Max Films Intl.

“Moon” won the international film critics’ Fipresci Prize at Berlin and a Genie Award in Canada for adapted screenplay. It was a Special Presentation at the 2003 Toronto Intl. Film Festival. But it has yet to recoup its C$3 million ($2.3 million) budget.

The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences announces its nominees Jan. 25. The 77th Academy Awards will be held Feb. 27 at the Kodak Theater in Hollywood.

In order to qualify for the foreign-language Oscar, films must have been released for at least a week between October 2003 and September 2004.
