        "text": "Gus Dapperton has always been obsessed with building new worlds. It's been part of his passion since he started making songs in Garageband, a creator's mindset that eventually shaped two independent albums of defiantly original alt-pop. Now signed to Warner Records, Dapperton goes even further on his new project, Henge, immersing himself in bold details and immersive songwriting to conjure a twilight world that permanently hovers between sunset and sunrise throughout 11 mercurial songs.\n\n\"Manhattanhenge happens in New York when the sun lines up perfectly between the buildings and it looks like a solstice,\" the artist-producer says of his cryptic album title. \"I came up with the concept about someone entering this underworld as the sun goes down and trying to get home before dawn — or risk being stuck in a time loop.\" The push and pull between nighttime revelry and sun-dappled safety resonates with Dapperton in post-pandemic America.\n\n\"A lot of my life after COVID is just trying to embrace the world again,\" the 26-year-old says. \"I was always an introvert, but now I get an adrenaline rush from being around people.\" While there is a distinct thematic throughline, Dapperton wants listeners to go on their own journeys. \"I write songs that can be taken out of context and enjoyed individually, but there's a story you could follow if you wanted to.\"\n\nDapperton's love of sonic world-building has deep roots. The Warwick, New York native didn't grow up in a traditionally musical family, but there was always something blasting from the radio. As much as he loved music, he didn't think he would ever make his own: \"I tried picking up the guitar,\" he remembers. \"It didn't really stick.\" An eighth-grade music class changed all that. Students were tasked with making a song in GarageBand — and Dapperton had found his instrument.\n\nDapperton spent the rest of high school making beats. By the time college came around, his confidence had blossomed. \"I started picking up instruments and singing,\" he says. While attending Drexel University, he played gigs in Philadelphia and ventured to New York City with just his \"computer, an MPD pad, and a guitar.\" He soon dropped out and released a series of independent EPs as well as the acclaimed albums Where Polly People Go to Read and Orca. With buzz brewing, a feel-good feature would be his breakthrough.\n\n\"Supalonely,\" a collaboration with New Zealand singer-songwriter BENEE, went viral during lockdown in 2020 and amassed more than one billion streams on its way to becoming a double-Platinum hit. \"It gave me and other indie artists credibility,\" he says. \"It showed that alt-pop songs can be massive.\" Dapperton signed to Warner Records in 2022 and immediately got started on Henge.\n\nFrom the outset, he knew his approach would be different. Instead of starting with songs, Dapperton plotted out moods and titles and worked backward. \"I didn't follow a super-stern formula,\" he says. That's particularly true of \"Sunrise,\" the sprawling opening track. Taking inspiration from film scores, the song begins with a strummed guitar before synths erupt and our protagonist enters the Manhattan underworld.\n\nFrom there, the artist-producer dabbles in '80s-inspired new wave on the catchy lead single \"Horizons\" and '70s funk on \"Homebody.\" The album's eclectic sprawl is also reflected in Dapperton's choice of collaborators, including a reunion with BENEE on \"Don't Let Me Down.\"\n\nHis team-up with poet Ocean Vuong on \"Sunset\" took a longer path. \"On tour in Korea, a fan gave me a book called 'On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous,'\" he recounts. Many months later, Dapperton read it and was blown away: \"It's one of the most incredible books I've ever read.\" He thought they should work together and called on Vuong to write a poem for the album's final track. \"We were immediately on the same page,\" he says. \"It's really cool to combine other mediums of art and writing.\"\n\nWhile the scope of Henge is vast and ambitious, Dapperton's music maintains the intimacy that made his previous offerings so resonant. At its core, the album is a way of processing a post-lockdown world. \"I think most people can relate to wanting change and chaos, but also monotony and protection,\" he says of the album's tug-of-war between night and day, socializing and solitude. \"I'm always internally battling those two sides.\"\n\nSound splashes across songs much like paint on a canvas. Melodies manifest in different shades with their own textures and nuances. BUNT. employs a vibrant sonic spectrum in his music. The German artist, producer, DJ, and multi-instrumentalist utilizes various elements to enrich each and every track with a pop of color befitting of his moniker — which translates to \"Colorful\" in English. After making a global impact with north of 250 million + streams and counting, he channels this spirit on a series of 2023 singles and his forthcoming project.\n\n\"My music is a variety of different genres and instruments blending together like colors do,\" he exclaims. \"I have an LED sign in my studio that says, 'Melodies First.' I'm super melody-driven, and it's the most important part for me. If your lyrics are in English, German, or Spanish, somebody might not understand them. Melodies don't speak a specific language; they're universal.\"\n\nGrowing up in Stuttgart, he instantly gravitated to music as a kid. As if predestining BUNT.'s path, his father actually met his mother at a club where he worked as a DJ on the weekends after emigrating to Germany from Turkey. At 15-years-old, BUNT.'s older brother introduced him to Swedish House Mafia via the video for their smash \"One.\" Inspired further by Avicii, Of Monsters & Men, Mumford & Sons, M83, MGMT, and The Naked and Famous, he broke out his laptop, downloaded a production program, and spent \"25/7 nonstop\" on writing and recording. Early uploads caught the attention of tastemaker German label Kontor, and he inked his first deal at 18-years-old. He gained traction with tracks such as \"Journey\" and \"Harmonica\" which have now racked up 25 million streams.\n\nHowever, \"Old Guitar\" exploded in 2016. It catapulted to #8 on the Spotify Global Viral Chart. Around the same time, he teamed up with Nathaniel Rateliff and the Nightsweats to create the soundtrack for a Kia car commercial. He also served up official remixes for AVICII, OneRepublic, Gryffin, and National\n\nParks, to name a few. Moreover, his catalog expanded to include fan favorites such as \"Unbreakable\"\n\n[feat. Clarence Coffee Jr] and \"Crocodile Tears\" [feat. Jens Hult], boosting his stream tally beyond the 250 million-mark.\n\nDuring 2022, he regularly embarked on a seven-hour train ride to visit his brother and infant nephew. Becoming something of a ritual, he put on his headphones, cooked up songs, and shared them on TikTok as the train stopped at its final destination. One such track, \"Paperplanes,\" caught fire in December.\n\n\"What I like about trains is there are no distractions,\" he smiles. \"You don't have internet access. You don't have much equipment. You can just focus on music. I felt like I found my new studio!\"\n\nAt the top of 2023, another train upload, \"Clouds\" [with Nate Traveller], blossomed into an international phenomenon. His initial post of the sound generated over 1.4 million-plus views and 181K \"likes\" with 20K \"creates.\" Meanwhile, the song quickly gathered over 10 million total streams as he simultaneously signed a global deal to Arista Records US, Columbia Records UK, and Epic Records Germany. Reimagining Traveller's track around the original vocals, \"Clouds\" hints at the breadth of BUNT.'s signature style. Its propulsive energy underscores a head-nodding bounce, lifting the hook beyond the stratosphere.\n\n\"I started with piano and chose the synthesizers and basslines afterwards,\" he recalls. \"I always loved Nate's vocals and lyrics. The song is about people who are really meaningful to you and giving them credit for making your life possible. My parents play such an important role in my life. They did so much and always supported me. It's a 'Thank You.' Ultimately, 'Clouds' changed everything. I was able to quit my job, and now I can just be an artist.\"\n\nIn the end, BUNT.'s melodies exude the power to energize, enthrall, and engage.\n\n\"When you listen to me, I hope you feel super powerful,\" he leaves off. \"Every song has a meaning and will tell you a story. I try to impact your life and motivate you. I'm twisting up all of these different colors into a cool mix to be 'BUNT. 2023.'\"\n\nBlu DeTiger is proof that bassists are main character material. The New York City born-and-raised artist picked up the bass guitar at age seven and soon after played her first gig at the legendary punk venue CBGB. Fueled by the hustle mentality of her environment, she was a fixture in the Lower Manhattan music scene by age 17, playing in various bands and DJing clubs while adding her live bass to her crowd-moving sets. The energy of this fast-paced nightlife world manifests through her pulsating bass lines that serve as the emotional anchor of her eclectic songs melding art pop, electroclash, funk, disco, and alternative rock.\n\nNow with the arrival of her debut Capitol Records studio album All I Ever Want Is Everything, Blu is claiming her spotlight as a rising pop icon who's not afraid to feel it all. \"This album is about really enjoying the high moments in life, but also learning how to talk yourself out of the low moments and become your own best friend,\" she says. \"I want to let people know that you can feel it all and do it all. Wherever you're at is cool.\" It's also the culmination of the past few years in which she has grown tremendously. She built her profile opening for artists like Sabrina Carpenter and Jungle, her own headline tours around the US and Europe, and becoming one of her generation's most sought-after bass players, lending her talents to Bleachers (with whom she appeared on Saturday Night Live), Olivia Rodrigo, Dominic Fike, Caroline Polachek, Chromeo, and Fletcher among others.\n\nAll I Ever Want Is Everything is a portrait of Blu at her most unstoppable and her most vulnerable, as she captures the thrillingly unpredictable process of coming into one's own. Inspired by sleepless nights out on the town and memories of her thumping DJ sets, the album sees Blu staking a claim to her desires and transforming into the messy protagonist of her fantasies. On the thumping \"Dangerous Game,\" she playfully pledges to someone that she'll \"break up the band\" so the two can have an unforgettable evening of dancing and indulgence. \"Let's blow our money / Let's go all night,\" she sings. \"I wanted a song that portrayed this fun character who doesn't give a fuck, who wants to go out and experience life — which is a big part of my personality,\" she explains.\n\nThese hedonistic and infectiously groovy songs are balanced out with mature introspection, in which she admits to feeling imposter syndrome and the loneliness of growing up in the digital age. Yet Blu's more melancholy songs are still upbeat, as on the Mallrat-featuring dance track \"Cut Me Down.\" Laughing off memories of past detractors and critics, her pitched-up vocals have a canny robotic effect, adding to the track's layered emotions. \"The high-pitched vocals sound like angels talking to you, or this encouraging part of yourself trying to bring yourself out of feeling down,\" Blu explains. \"I love songs that have a sad tinge, but make you feel good at the same time — where a DJ could play it and everyone's dancing and screaming along.\"\n\nThe album captures the spirit of New York, but it was created in Los Angeles, where Blu moved in 2022. Since it was her first time living in an entirely different city, she found herself having to adjust to the newfound independence during a period of immense growth. Newly signed to Capitol Records and adjusting to the Los Angeles songwriting circuit for the first time, she also embarked on her first headlining tour across North America behind her debut EP, How did we get here?\n\nSupporting Blu in the making of All I Ever Want Is Everything was a star-studded group of friends and collaborators. The album features co-writes from rising pop stars Chappell Roan and Alexander 23, as well as indie sleaze originator Uffie and soul aficionado Mayer Hawthorne and Blu's frequent collaborator, her brother, Rex. Meanwhile, \"Disappearing\" was made in collaboration with Magdalena Bay, with whom Blu immediately bonded over being producers and multi-instrumentalists.\n\nBlu also worked alongside GRAMMY-winning producer John Hill and Sam Homaee in experimenting with different bass tones and vocal effects, making the album more multifaceted. She strived to expand the range of her vocal delivery, too — from falsettos to sing-speak sections. All of these elements are captured compellingly on her single \"Kiss.\" \"I wanted my voice to feel like another instrument,\" she explains. \"Just like how we manipulated the bass in cool ways with pedals, we processed the voice to get a bigger range of emotion.\"\n\nAfter studying at NYU's Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music for two years, she left in 2019, which allowed her the space to fully become the solo artist she was always meant to be. \"I was putting out singles while I was running around New York hustling — playing gigs, doing sessions, DJing, and saying yes to every opportunity that came my way,\" she says. Then during the early pandemic, her bass cover videos started to gain steam on TikTok, where \"Figure It Out\" ultimately went viral, and where she now has more than 1.4 million followers. In 2023, she was named one of Forbes' 30 Under 30 for music and on the cover. Blu is expanding her entrepreneurial footprint with Fender and Bose partnerships.\n\nNow, with her electric-blue bass and effortlessly cool head-banging, Blu is inspiring a new generation of fans to take up the bass. \"When I was young, I didn't have any archetypes to follow,\" she says. \"Then once I started doing more, I was like, honestly, I'm making my own lane. Now there are young people who are messaging me saying, 'I started playing bass and making music because of you.'\" This line of thinking is part of what inspired her, during her last headline tour, to bring someone from the audience up on stage each night to jam on the bass alongside her.\n\n\"My motivation as an artist is to help the younger generation discover their passion, pick up an instrument, and find an outlet to express themselves,\" Blu concludes."
