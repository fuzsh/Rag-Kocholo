        "text": "Used to being a “therapist for other artists,” Leon Thomas is now choosing to be vulnerable to the world himself. In a jam-packed press conference for his upcoming debut album Electric Dusk, the producer, singer, and songwriter leaves no stone unturned, discussing everything from his passion for storytelling to the future of R&B and modern music.\n\nThose unfamiliar with the name Leon Thomas have still definitely heard his work, as the industry veteran has collaborated with and written for countless chart-topping artists such as Drake, SZA, Post Malone, and Ariana Grande. Hence, this is a highly anticipated, but much delayed, debut album. The reasons for this, Thomas revealed, were legal battles and corporate challenges that fortunately have since been resolved. The album was produced in collaboration with Alex Foley – also known for work with Kendrick Lamar – and mixes elements of psychedelic rock with R&B and hip-hop. Paired with the simplicity of the lyrics, Leon thinks the album feels like the 60s.\n\nIn comparison to writing for other artists, Thomas confessed that writing only for himself was uncomfortable as it demanded a new vulnerability. Trying not to be overwhelmed by the pressure of both internal and external expectations, Thomas just wanted to be honest. In this new album, “I spell out the range of emotions I go through as a human being,” he says. Motivated by the frustration of “not being heard as [him]self,” Thomas persevered, and he’s proud to share a new side of himself to fans worldwide through his debut. For fans hearing from him for the first time, he simply hopes that they walk away understanding him a bit better.\n\nWhen asked about his songwriting process, Thomas explained that he starts with lyrics first — melody comes easily to him — stressing the importance of vivid storytelling in his work. He added that he finds inspiration from TV shows and movies, such as Love Jones. If he had to give advice to bubbling R&B artists, it would be to prepare, practice, and cultivate good taste. Looking towards the future of the genre, Thomas hopes to see more of a “live feel” in R&B, which is congruent with many people’s disdain for overproduced records. What’s more, Thomas states that he respects those who try new things even if people might be uncomfortable with it. “Technology affects and evolves [music],” so he encourages us to always remain open-minded.\n\nAt the end of the conference, Thomas set the room abuzz: when asked who he would like to collaborate with, he admitted that, despite having worked many times with Ariana Grande, he wants to officially release music with her the most (we need this ASAP!).\n\nWe look forward to listening to this album and all future releases by Leon Thomas! Listen to Electric Dusk today."
