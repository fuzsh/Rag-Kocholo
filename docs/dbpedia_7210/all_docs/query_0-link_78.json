        "text": "ANDREW HILL (Jazz pianist/composer)\n\nLast updated 23 April 2000\n\nAndrew Hill was born June 30, 1937 in Chicago and started playing jazz at age 13, copying the playing of Bud Powell, Thelonius Monk and Art Tatum. His early gigs were with Von Freeman, Wilbur Ware, Johnny Griffin and later with Miles Davis. After a period of woodshedding he formed a trio which backed vocalist Dinah Washington which took him to New York. From there he worked with the Johnny Griffin-Lockjaw Davis Quintet, Al Hibbler, fellow Chicagoan Clifford Jordan, Roland Kirk at the Five Spot, Jackie McLean and Kenny Dorham before signing an exclusive contract with Blue Note. Andrew appeared on two Blue Note sessions firstly with Joe Henderson, then Hank Mobley before leading his own date featuring Henderson on tenor, released as the album Black Fire. A succession of dates as a leader for Blue Note followed until 1971. He then concentrated on composing and gave concert tours throughout the USA via the auspices of the Smithsonian Institute. In 1974 he recorded again on Steeplechase and through being contacted by Michael Cuscuna Andrew did a pair of recordings for the Freedom label. He also recorded three albums for East Wind. In 1978 Andrew recorded an album for the Artists House label which contained a booklet with a fairly complete recording discography. In the album notes Andrew lamented the difficulties he was having with his music and career in the then current music environment. Andrew recorded 2 more albums in 1980 and 2 in 1986 for Italy's Soul Note label before he returned to Blue Note for an album\n\nin 1989. It was late in that year that his wife died from cancer. Another Blue Note session followed in 1990. Since then Andrew has recorded some sideman dates including a session for Reggie Workman that saw him working with former Blue Note labelmate Sam Rivers. 1995 saw the release of a box set of Andrew's Blue Note albums which has hopefully re-vitalised interest in his recordings. Andrews is widely considered as a most important jazz pianist and composer.\n\nContributions, corrections and any suggestions are welcome.

Andrew said he would endeavor to collaborate with me on this site - I'm still waiting Andrew!\n\nAlthough Black Saint/Soul Note label recordings are not always widely stocked this is one company that does not delete items from it's catalogue\n\nso all releases should be available.
