        "text": "Andrew Hill – Smokestack (Blue Note, 2020)\n\nExpressionistic and romantic is this quartet reissue by Andrew Hill with Roy Haynes and two bassists. It still sounds original 55 years later.\n\nAndrew Hill has the same reputation for being difficult as Thelonious Monk used to have before he was canonized. They were both champions of Blue Note records producer Alfred Lion who recorded them during important phases in their careers. They were both composers and pianists with original styles.\n\nThere is also a Monk influence in Hill’s work, openly in the name of the composition ”New Monastery”, and otherwise in the intervals, dissonance, and tonal colors which Hill took further than Monk and which still can be perceived as difficult or modern even in an recording as this one from 1963.\n\nThis is the only album Hill recorded for Blue Note where he is the only soloist. Otherwise he recorded with quartets, quintet’s, or even larger groups. It gives you a better chance to study him as a pianist, but it is not an ordinary trio album due to the double bassist team of Richard Davis and Eddie Khan being present at the session.\n\nThe two bassists\n\nDavis plays a highly active role in the music, playing counter melodies pizzicato or with the bow heard up front in the mix while Khan play the more traditional role of accompanist.\n\nHill was not the first band leader using two bassists. Saxophonist John Coltrane did it a couple of years earlier on several albums, and his colleague Eric Dolphy had recorded with the very two bassists on this album for the sessions which produced the albums Conversations and Iron Man. The effect they have is producing a more plastic rhythm than usual over which Hill is freer to choose which rhythmic path to go.\n\nRoy Haynes is perfect for the music with his clean and exact playing. It is so much music going on with Hill and the two bassists that a busier drummer would have muddled it.\n\nThe influences of Hill\n\nAnother trait Hill shares with Monk is a certain romanticism. While having a reputation for writing difficult music Monk also wrote some of the most beautiful ballads there is like ”’Round Midnight” and ”Monk’s Mood”.\n\nSome of Hill’s pieces are beautiful too, but he leans more towards the bittersweet, and a romanticism with more expressive gestures than the one Monk uses. ”The Day After” is a good example with its advanced harmonies and rhythms. ”Verne” is more of traditional ballad where Hill’s dept to pianist Bud Powell’s more conventional bop vocabulary is more obvious.\n\nIn fact, Hill may have more in common with Powell than Monk. It is even more obvious on the up-tempo songs like ”Ode to Von” and ”Not So” where Hill blows. The expressionistic harmonies Hill uses could also be traced back to Powell recordings like ”Dusk in Sandi” or ”Autumn in New York”.\n\nHill in piano jazz history\n\nBud Powell was yet another pianist who was championed by Alfred Lion at Blue Note records, but while Monk and Hill had a hard time getting acceptance from audiences, Powell became the most influential of all pianists of a whole generation.\n\nHill has yet to find such acceptance, or even the acceptance Monk had late in his life, but his way is in no way a dead end. Today his influence can be heard on pianists like Vijay Iyer and Jason Moran, and saxophonist Branford Marsalis recorded Hill’s ”Snake Hip Waltz” on his last album.\n\nSo, something is happening, but there is some time before Hill will be as widespread an influence as the more popular and easily accessible Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea and Keith Jarrett."
