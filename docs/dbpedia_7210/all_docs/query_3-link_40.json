        "text": "FINAL ALBUM IN OCEANIC TRILOGY\n\nTsyphur Zalan’s Oceanic Dusk is the third and final release in the Oceanic Series, a three-part drone ambient album series designed for sound meditation or noise cancellation. Whereas the Dawn and Day albums represented the lighter side of ambient background and contemplation, the Dusk album tunes into the dissonant and mysterious planes of consciousness experienced in waking life and within the subconscious. Tsyphur Zalan composer Christopher Bono utilized his years of practice and study of sound healing and meditation to inform the approach to this project which was initially designed for two sound bath installations in upstate NY and New York City.\n\nWhile much of the project utilizes slow moving drones and calming ambience, there are also strange and challenging moments that would not normally be associated with a ‘meditation’ record. However, Bono incorporates the sound approaches used by many indigenous shamanic cultures around the world, where dissonance is used to ‘cut’ into built up negative or stuck patterns within the mind. Sometimes this cutting can release pent-up static, trapped or concentrated energies, which may be labeled as ‘dark’, although that may be a misrepresentation. Once these energies are stirred up or released, the shaman then infuses the newly exposed space with consonant tones and harmonious thoughts, intentions and sounds.\n\nThis process can be heard very clearly in the transition over the course of the Dusk album between the two long form tracks. “Space, Rips, Threads” (Track 1) is a 32-minute sound meditation featuring a special collaboration between Christopher Bono and bass clarinetist Bohdan Hilash (Meredith Monk Ensemble). After an unexpected studio visit from Bohdan during the recording of the Oceanic series, the two friends decided to record this beautifully dissonant late-night live performance inspired by their mutual appreciation of meditation through sound and their love for long form soundscapes.\n\n“Cave Phantoms” (Track 2), the final 26-minute piece, is a cosmic, calming and eventually centering drone epic that is created around the pali mantra “Bhavatu Sabba Mangalam” which generally translates to “May all beings be happy!” It acts as the closing track to over 3 hours and 15 minutes of music released through the Oceanic Series."
