        "text": "During a cold and dark winter in Toronto, Trevor Sloan—a songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and mixed media artist based in the city—found himself in a cozy room filled with loved ones. His friend started talking about his family’s plum trees and their process of making homemade brandy, and there came the inspiration for his latest album, Dusk Among the Plum Trees, released this spring.\n\n“I had this picture in my mind of a dusky sky above plum trees,” Sloan says. He went on to write a song by that name, and while it was never finished, the title stuck. “It conjures up images of dusk and night, and I think most of the songs on the album fit with that. I had also been reading a lot of Japanese poetry, which often references plum trees, so that was part of the inspiration too.”\n\nThe 11-track record, mixed and mastered by Andy Magoffin at the House of Miracles in Cambridge, Ontario, intertwines simple imagery and everyday themes. With a nostalgic psych-folk sound, the album conjures up images of faded pastel Polaroids, transporting listeners to another time and place.\n\nSloan explains most of the songs began with simple observations, like how “green grass is after the rain” and evolved from there. He weaves characters and objects into his songs, creating soft, colourful scenes filled with references to “…trashy magazines, singing robins, green steeples, the rubble of a burned-down hotel, coyotes walking on train tracks, and the light under a pigeon wing in flight.”\n\nMany of these observations come from Sloan’s wandering in Toronto’s Junction neighbourhood, where he lives. “The song ‘Panther in a Cage’ is about a guy I see walking around my neighbourhood. ‘Sunset Glow’ refers to people and things from around here as well: ‘Old man and his cane… landlords and panthers, women from the shelter, loners and lovers, parrots and flowers.’”\n\nThe latter song closes out the album, paying tribute to its title and portraying the “city folk on their way” as the sun sets. Sloan explains, “It paints a picture of my neighbourhood, skillfully weaving together characters and references from other songs into one final closing piece.”\n\nSloan's sound draws inspiration from artists of the 60s and 70s, such as Donovan, Nick Drake, Labi Siffre, and Cat Stevens. ”There is something natural and genuine about the music from that time,” Sloan says, also highlighting his recent discovery of the music of British folk duo Chad & Jeremy. Songs like “Willow Weep for Me” and “Before and After” have left a lasting impression on him with their \"mellow nature, gentle vocals, nice harmonies, and lush arrangements.\"\n\nHe also draws inspiration from new artists like Sylvie, Evan Cheadle (Fault Line Serenade), Dan Edmonds (Good Fortune Assembly), and Jon McKiel (Bobby Joe Hope), among others. “I am constantly trying to discover new music,” Sloan adds.\n\nThese influences are clear in the album’s open track, “Ottawa 1977”, an upbeat homage to his family. While Sloan never lived in the city, he has strong ties with his parents having grown up in the city.\n\n“I was inspired to write the song after looking at photos from my parents’ collection. I love the warmth of 70s photography. Many of those pictures had the place name and date handwritten on the back,” he says. That idea of the back of a photo is where the song got its name. “I was thinking about my grandmother’s apartment in Ottawa. In the courtyard, there was a clothesline to hang laundry. If you were in the kitchen, the radio was usually on. In the family room, there were often tabloid magazines on the coffee table. For me, it was a golden place full of good family memories. I would say that side of my family is quite spiritual and believes in magic; that is why I used the line, “My family tree is full of mystical minds.”\n\nThis immediacy contrasts with the longer creative process involved in making a record. “The process of writing, recording, having the music mixed and mastered by someone, and then planning an album release can take over a year. Collage and poetry provide instant gratification while I work on music projects over a more extended period of time. I believe collaging has helped me be more open-minded with music, more willing to experiment, to have fun, and just focus on making the music that sounds good to my own ears.”\n\nWhile the album creation process takes some time, the recording process itself is more spontaneous. “When I write a song, I record it right away,” Sloan says, who recorded the album at his home studio. “So, I’m writing and recording continually throughout the year. I recorded about 30 songs and then picked what I thought were the best 11. Generally, I write songs on an acoustic guitar. I start with the music and then write the lyrics. I record each instrument, track by track.”\n\nFrom there, using an acoustic guitar, some vintage synths and keyboards, bass and a midi software program called SampleTank, Sloan records and layers each instrument track by track, creating his breezy, mystical sound.\n\n“My Roland Juno-106 keyboard was slightly defective during the recording process, which added some interesting warbly drone sounds to some of the songs. That keyboard would get unbearably staticky after a minute of being turned on, so I would have to record those particular parts within one minute or wait until the next night (I've since had the keyboard repaired).”\n\nThe resulting album has a mellow, mystical sound, with each song taking the listener to a different moment in time as a true observer.\n\nSloan references Francoise Hardy’s Ma jeunesse fout le camp…, as what he says might be “the perfect album to listen to while making dinner,” hoping listeners find a similar kind of quiet comfort and timeless appeal in this album. “I hope Dusk Among the Plum Trees is the kind of album that people would like to listen to while making dinner,” he says. “I hope they find warmth in the songs and the arrangements and it leaves them with a mellow feeling.”"
