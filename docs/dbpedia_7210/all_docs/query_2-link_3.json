Old Magnolia\n8. Stones In Your Casserole\n9. Done Nothin\n10. The Names You Got\n\n&quot;The Wisconsin based Dusk&#39;s self-titled full-length debut is nothing short of spectacular, a record that combines folk and country music with a slacker pop drawl and a dusty nuance of Americana storytelling. It sounds modern with a call-back to the easy going days of folk music&#39;s roots, a collection of songs that would sound as great being sung around a campfire as they do on your headphones walking through a crowded city. Dusk transport you from where you are to where you wish you were; the open air, endless freedom, and thick harmonies of a better life. Traveling from red barns to monster trucks, bolo ties to bald eagles, this one plays up their surroundings with gorgeous images and the band&#39;s slow-dripped twang in impeccably lackadaisical form.&quot; - Dan Goldin; Post-Trash",
