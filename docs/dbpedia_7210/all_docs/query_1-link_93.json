Yet, that said, if you are looking for a mainstream standards album, then with Valse Sinistre you’re in the wrong place. The compositions are diverse, the grooves relentless and there are moments where you get a whiff of the avant-garde.

His ride cymbal beat is lively, varied and full of passing cross-rhythms, the sound of a musician fully engaged, hearing and reacting to everything happening around him. By Kevin Whitehead NPR Fresh Air Read/Listen\r\nThe best new jazz albums - Editor's Choice: September 2022.

This is clearly due to drummer Billy Drummond, who enormously enriches the performance and instantly adds a different dynamic and urgency to the music.   Read\r\n\r\nNew York Times  The Best Live Jazz Performances of 2017 by Giovanni Russonello This year, the festival’s weekend marathon brought over 100 bands to roughly a dozen venues across two nights. The best thing I heard [ast Winterfest] was a duo from the pianist Kris Davis and the drummer Billy Drummond.  Read\r\n\r\nJazzdagama Frank Kimbrough, Scott Robinson, Rufus Reid, Billy Drummond: Monk's Dreams - The Complete Compositions of Thelonious Sphere Monk by Raul Da Gama. Clearly Mr Drummond appears to be one who would suit a Thelonious Monk Quartet as few drummers would. The drummer’s traversal of this music shows off his inimitable genius as he shares the music’s twists and turns with supple rhythmic flexibility. His approach to Mr Monk’s big-boned and generous space for rhythmic invention is evident in the sense of depth and spaciousness – which we hear on “Little Rootie Tootie”, for instance – that gives the piece an almost orchestral scale as Mr Drummond holds up the rhythmic canvas with brushes and sticks traversing the far corners of his drum set. His penchant for driving the music ever forward makes for exciting twists and turns at all times and we are never prepared for the surprises that often come fast and furious as he dives headlong into the development of a piece with every hint of real abandon on “Brake’s Sake” (Disc Three) for instance. Mr Drummond’s virtuosity is also powerfully and lovingly delivered, creating a glistening delicacy as a foil to the other musicians as he swishes his way through the cymbals and the snares on “Gallop‘s Gallop” (Disc Four). And there is many a high-voltage moment on “Work” and “Hackensack” (Disc Five) all of which are fully redeemed with the other members of the quartet where everything seems right in the sincere and poised accounts of each of the musicians. Read\r\n. . . a phenomenal jazz drummer. OTEIL BURBRIDGE\r\nDownbeat Blindfold Test by Ted Panken A listening test that challenges the featured artist to discuss and identify the musicians who performed on the featured recordings.  Read\r\n\r\nNew York Times  Mr. Drummond — aptly, a drummer — plays with quick-thinking focus and forbearance. He can pile on the activity without weighing things down, a rare talent. It will serve him well at Mezzrow, a little basement club that’s better suited for percussion-free combos than it is for drummers. With Donald Vega and Dave Kikoski sharing piano duties, and David Wong on bass, he should have little trouble striking a measured balance; in Mr. Drummond’s hands, the intimacy of the space will become an advantage. Read\r\n\r\nNew York Times Dubai: Number One Best Jazz CD of the Year -\r\n. . .  the kind of highly refined intelligence that Max Roach introduced to drumming.  STANLEY CROUCH\r\nGuardian By John Fordham Billy Drummond plays superbly throughout. He is exclamatory and insistent on Hip Hop, its theme built out of blippy accents against the percussion, with Bley getting gospelly on it. He quietly whispers behind Sheppard's long, tremulous tenor notes and Swallow's purring bass on Tropical Depression - tightly riding the cymbals on the inquisitive, slightly puzzled sounding Red, dramatic on the more abstract, suite-like title track. Four Star review of Carla Bley and the Lost Chords.\r\n\r\nNPR A Blog Supreme Rhythm Runs in the Family: Drummers on their Dads   Read\r\n\r\nJazzTimes Spins jazz on the head of a pin with stunning results.\r\n\r\nModern Drummer One of the most crisp, popping, and sensitive drummers around.\r\n\r\nNew York Jazz Record His capacity to spur on each soloist and add color to the ensemble is without equal.\r\n\r\nJazzTimes Imaginative, satisfying and memorable.\r\n\r\nJazzTimes This is a solid work that underscores why Drummond is one of the most in-demand players in the business.  Read\r\n\r\nJazziz Style and authority . . . masterful use of the melodic and harmonic devices at his drumstick tips.\r\n\r\nAallAboutJazz Billy Drummond is a powerful and highly musical drummer. He is showcased beautifully in this piano-less quartet setting...Drummond offers his composition as the title track, a middle-eastern sounding line in 7/4 which has the percussionist showing his love for Elvin Jones-esque wailing in support of [Chris] Potter's soprano sax and more tenor from Weiskopf. The track literally burns... Dubai is worth searching out. Billy Drummond has produced a gem of a recording that offers up the best that jazz has to offer. Great tunes, superb musicianship and something new to hear with each listening. I can't keep this out of my CD player. -  Read\r\n\r\nNew York Times By Ben Ratliff   Mr. Drummond was especially impressive for not being a regular part of this group. He just explored the trap set for an hour, continually shifting his focus, working on the edges of the cymbals for a while and then the meat of them, altering his combinations between drums, then aligning in swing with Mr. Wonsey and Mr. Washington.\r\n\r\nDownbeat By Fred Bouchard Today, Drummond is one of the most called for players of his generation, sought by masters (Sonny Rollins, James Moody, Pat Metheny) and excellent peers (Javon Jackson, Christian McBride, Vincent Herring) ... there's nothing ordinary about Dubai, his third Criss Cross CD; two tenors, doubling, over bass and drums (or just cymbals). Bands of drum greats come to mind - Elvin Jones' hypnotic line-weaving, Roach's taut freedom, Jack DeJohnette's chord-free openness - but Drummond carves things with his own flourish. -\r\n. . . one of the hippest bandleaders now at work. Jim Macnie, DOWNBEAT\r\nThe multi-talented Drummond is a progressive musician. He likes to push the limits of jazz, drawing on its traditions while seeking a vibrant, open-doored present. - Zan Stewart, NJ Star Ledger\r\n\r\nThe most vital element [in Andrew Hill's Dusk] is the anchoring provided by bassist Scott Colley and drummer Billy Drummond. As valuable as Richard Davis and Tony Williams were to Point of Departure, Colley and Drummond interact with Hill in a similar musical dialogue that is characteristic of true jazz improvisation of the highest order - Chris Hovan, AllAboutJazz\r\n\r\nOne couldn't envision [Walt Weiskopg's Siren] without the talents of drummer Billy Drummond. His capacity to spur on each soloist and add color to the ensemble is without equal. - Chris Hovan, AllAboutJazz\r\n\r\nWith his crisp, clear sound and ease of articulation, Billy Drummond is a master drummer who makes his set sing. No wonder greats like Sonny Rollins, Freddie Hubbard and Joe Henderson have sought his services. - Zan Stewart, NJ Star Ledger\r\n\r\nDrummond has valuable ideas as a leader. For Dubai, he assembled a quartet with a fairly rare configuration; two tenor saxophonists and no pianist...he never settles on one rhythmic pattern for long, always suggesting fresh ideas for his musicians and keeping a loose, open feel to the recording. - Ben Ratliff, New York Times\r\n\r\nDrummond is one of the most crisp, popping, and sensitive drummers around, and this quartet is a great forum for his style. The ensemble sound is as tight as old school buddies and the soloing is inspired. - Jeff Potter, Modern Drummer\r\n\r\nTaste and empathy are the hallmarks of drummer Drummond's playing. - George Kanzler, NJ Star Ledger\r\n\r\nRhythmatist Drummond directs the proceedings with style and authority on Dubai, a two tenor quartet recording which more than adequately highlights Drummond's refined skills...Drummond makes masterful use of the melodic and harmonic devices at his drumstick-tips. Jazziz\r\n\r\nThe elusive essence of a blowing session is captured on drummer Billy Drummond's Dubai. Sunday Omaha World Herald\r\n\r\nDrummond is a crisp, authoritative drummer without bombast. - Tim Coakley, Sunday Gazette, Schenectady\r\n\r\nDrummond's tasteful percussion work teasing and prodding instead of relying on volume...One World is a promising debut by a group which will hopefully be around for some time. - Vinnie Tietro, Whole Life Times\r\n\r\nLet's face it -- some jazz musicians have run the post bop groove into the ground, but the quartet Native Colors offers a fresh approach. - Calvin Wilson, Kansas City Star",

He is showcased beautifully in this piano-less quartet setting…Drummond offers his composition as the title track, a middle-eastern sounding line in 7/4 which has the percussionist showing his love for Elvin Jones-esque wailing in support of [Chris] Potter’s soprano sax and more tenor from Weiskopf. The track literally burns… Dubai is worth searching out. Billy Drummond has produced a gem of a recording that offers up the best that jazz has to offer. Great tunes, superb musicianship and something new to hear with each listening. I can’t keep this out of my CD player.” – Read\n\nNew York Times By Ben Ratliff “Mr. Drummond was especially impressive for not being a regular part of this group. He just explored the trap set for an hour, continually shifting his focus, working on the edges of the cymbals for a while and then the meat of them, altering his combinations between drums, then aligning in swing with Mr. Wonsey and Mr. Washington.”\n\nDownbeat By Fred Bouchard “Today, Drummond is one of the most called for players of his generation, sought by masters (Sonny Rollins, James Moody, Pat Metheny) and excellent peers (Javon Jackson, Christian McBride, Vincent Herring) … there’s nothing ordinary about Dubai, his third Criss Cross CD; two tenors, doubling, over bass and drums (or just cymbals). Bands of drum greats come to mind – Elvin Jones’ hypnotic line-weaving, Roach’s taut freedom, Jack DeJohnette’s chord-free openness – but Drummond carves things with his own flourish.” –\n\n“. . . one of the hippest bandleaders now at work.” Jim Macnie, DOWNBEAT\n\n“The multi-talented Drummond is a progressive musician. He likes to push the limits of jazz, drawing on its traditions while seeking a vibrant, open-doored present.” – Zan Stewart, NJ Star Ledger\n\n“The most vital element [in Andrew Hill’s Dusk] is the anchoring provided by bassist Scott Colley and drummer Billy Drummond. As valuable as Richard Davis and Tony Williams were to Point of Departure, Colley and Drummond interact with Hill in a similar musical dialogue that is characteristic of true jazz improvisation of the highest order” – Chris Hovan, AllAboutJazz\n\n“One couldn’t envision [Walt Weiskopg’s Siren] without the talents of drummer Billy Drummond. His capacity to spur on each soloist and add color to the ensemble is without equal.” – Chris Hovan, AllAboutJazz\n\n“With his crisp, clear sound and ease of articulation, Billy Drummond is a master drummer who makes his set sing. No wonder greats like Sonny Rollins, Freddie Hubbard and Joe Henderson have sought his services.” – Zan Stewart, NJ Star Ledger\n\n“Drummond has valuable ideas as a leader. For Dubai, he assembled a quartet with a fairly rare configuration; two tenor saxophonists and no pianist…he never settles on one rhythmic pattern for long, always suggesting fresh ideas for his musicians and keeping a loose, open feel to the recording.” – Ben Ratliff, New York Times\n\n“Drummond is one of the most crisp, popping, and sensitive drummers around, and this quartet is a great forum for his style. The ensemble sound is as tight as old school buddies and the soloing is inspired.” – Jeff Potter, Modern Drummer\n\n“Taste and empathy are the hallmarks of drummer Drummond’s playing.” – George Kanzler, NJ Star Ledger\n\n“Rhythmatist Drummond directs the proceedings with style and authority on Dubai, a two tenor quartet recording which more than adequately highlights Drummond’s refined skills…Drummond makes masterful use of the melodic and harmonic devices at his drumstick-tips.” Jazziz\n\n“The elusive essence of a blowing session is captured on drummer Billy Drummond’s Dubai.” Sunday Omaha World Herald\n\n“Drummond is a crisp, authoritative drummer without bombast.” – Tim Coakley, Sunday Gazette, Schenectady\n\n“Drummond’s tasteful percussion work teasing and prodding instead of relying on volume…One World is a promising debut by a group which will hopefully be around for some time.” – Vinnie Tietro, Whole Life Times"
