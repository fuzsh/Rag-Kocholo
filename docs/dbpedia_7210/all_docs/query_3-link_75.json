        "text": "Earlier this year, Insomnium released Anno 1696, an album that dealt with the horrors of plague, hunger, and the loss of life. Now, almost at the end of the year, the band follows that with Songs of the Dusk, a collection of three tracks that act as an addendum to the story set in Anno 1696. As someone who appreciates Insomnium’s storytelling and music, I was all in for another campfire story a la Argent Moon.\n\nSome context: this EP consists of tracks that were originally part of the limited-edition CD release of Anno 1696. However, Insomnium decided to release these on their own as they felt they were too good to just be bonus tracks on Anno 1696.\n\nAlthough Anno 1969 was based on a short story written by Niilo Sevänen, it can be inferred that the album took inspiration from the Great Famine of 1695-1697, which affected northern Europe, particularly Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. Due to this event Finland lost about 25-33% of its population and those who remained alive resorted to begging. It was considered, at the time, to be Finland’s worst demographic catastrophe, a somber event among the other catastrophes that occurred during this period. This is mirrored in Anno 1696’s closer, “The Rapids,” where a man drowns in the rapid waters of a river, asking to be forgiven for his sins. This is where Songs of the Dusk begins, where, even during famine, hope continues to survive.\n\nFor what the band calls the “director’s cut material,” Songs of the Dusk is a concise yet dense affair, one that showcases the best that Insomnium has to offer. Here are three stunning tracks that tell an alternative ending to the events that occurred in Anno 1696. First track “Flowers of the Night” starts off quite gently, like a ballad, before the guitars and the harsh vocals kick in. Although there is this languid atmosphere that seems to give the song a sense of warmth, the music remains melancholic, as if implying that, even during a tragic event, people can still find hope in their misery. The track’s title references the moonflower, a flower seen as a symbol of hope through adversity, where one must remain steadfast to make it another day. “Stained in Red” sheds the atmospheric, ethereal sound of “Flowers of the Night” in favor of rapid guitars and an emphasis on the death metal part of melodic death metal. This song sounds more like the band took a page from Amorphis, creating a more folk-like environment and adding keyboards to give the song a prog-like feel. While there are references to the overall sound of Anno 1696 towards the end of the track, it’s clear that Insomnium is expanding their sonic palette, and is looking at other bands for inspiration.\n\nFinally, there is “Song of the Dusk” which is, by far, the longest on the EP. This track stands out due to its triumphant, cinematic feel, sounding very much like something out of Heart Like A Grave or Shadows of the Dying Sun. The song has a folk-like feel to it, particularly in the usage of keys. Unlike the sonic palette used in the previous track, “Song of the Dusk” is more straightforward, sounding more like their most current incarnation. This song is worth the build-up from the previous two tracks, and, if nothing else, is likely to become one of those classic Insomnium songs that people will listen to repeatedly.\n\nThere is something about EPs giving bands a chance to explore other ideas or to release material that could easily belong in their main discography but have chosen not to. With Songs of the Dusk, Insomnium expands on their original concept, allowing them to create music that befits Anno 1696’s sonic aesthetic. If you enjoy Anno 1696 – and enjoy Insomnium and their atmospheric brand of melodeath – then you will appreciate Songs of the Dusk and the choice cuts it offers.\n\n— Hera"
