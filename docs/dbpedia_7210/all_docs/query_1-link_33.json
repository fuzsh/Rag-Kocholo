        "text": "Oh yeah! Black Fire and Judgment are two of my personal favorites...but so far I haven't heard a bad record of his. And of course there's Point of Departure. There's also a slightly later one called Grass Roots that I love...it's a bit of a departure for him as it is a little more \"groove\" oriented, kind of like some of the other Blue Note stuff that was happening at the time, but he brings his own thing to it and it's very cool.\n\nI gotta pick up Shades...that has been on my list of things to get forever but as you know those lists can get pretty long...\n\nSince we probably don't have a lot of Andrew Hill fans on here, let's try and make some new ones... Here, if you haven't heard Andrew Hill before, you can check out some tracks on last.fm for free.\n\nHere is Black Fire: http://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+Hill/Black+Fire\n\nGrass Roots: http://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+Hill/Grass+Roots\n\nPoint of Departure: http://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+Hill/Point+of+Departure\n\n...and there's a whole bunch more up there too. Unfortunately they don't seem to have any free tracks from Shades though.\n\nThere is a Select that covers these sessions, as there are several.\n\nHill is amazing. I think Dusk is every bit as good as the Blue Note sides.\n\nEDIT: looks like Hans, Pat and I chimed in with the same info around the same time. If you want unreleased material, the Select is where you want to be. Very interesting material in that set.\n\nGood idea.\n\nAndrew Hill did a series of shows at Birdland in NYC in 2006 after the release of a new album -- I believe his first in a while. I liked Point of Departure, and some of his lesser known albums that a friend had given me, so I convinced my wife that she and I ought to go, see him play and have dinner there. She thought it was a great idea.\n\nOut of sheer luck, we were seated at a table right by Mr. Hill's table where he sat with his wife and friends before the show -- the jazz pianist Bill Charlap came by his table, too. And this was also right by his piano so we got to watch his hands all night.\n\nAfter the show, I went up to his table, introduced myself as a fan, and asked him to sign my copy of Point of Departure. He was only to happy to do it. He asked about myself and I introduced my wife to him and he spoke to us for a minute before we shook hands.\n\nAs we were leaving maybe ten minutes later, he looked up at us and said ``Goodnight Kip and Amy.'' A real gentleman and a great talent.\n\nWow, great story! I'm really sad that I never got to see him perform live."
