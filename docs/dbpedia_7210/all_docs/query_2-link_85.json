        "text": "Cory Wong has released his first acoustic album, entitled Trail Songs: Dusk. The record is the first of two albums Wong will release this summer, ahead of the forthcoming Trail Songs: Dawn, and follows his recent live album, Live In Amsterdam.\n\nRelated: Cory Wong, Jon Batiste Release Collaborative ‘Meditations’ EP [Stream]\n\nKnown for his funky guitar work and worldwide touring, both as a solo artist and with Vulfpeck, an all-acoustic album marks a massive shift for the musician. Comprised of seven acoustic-based tracks that Wong wrote amid the coronavirus lockdown, Trail Songs: Dusk is quieter and softer than its “Dawn” counterpart.\n\n“The music I wrote for this album is nothing like the music I’ve put out before. It’s reflective and contemplative. It’s all acoustic music, recorded on acoustic instruments,” said Wong in a press release. “In March, when everything went into lockdown, it was the first time in a long time I was able to just clear the calendar for a few months and take a breath. It kind of felt like there were no rules for an artist’s output…in a good sense.”\n\nRelated: Cory Wong, Premier Guitar Launch ‘Wong Notes’ Podcast With Guests Béla Fleck, John Scofield, More\n\nHe continued, “Some people needed time to just absorb everything going on, and others needed to express parts of their humanity through music. I am one of those artists who needed to express my feelings through writing and recording music, but more specifically, songs from sequester. I’ve never been in one place for this long in the last 10 years. It’s crazy, it’s different, but it’s in some ways exactly what I needed.”\n\nSelf-reflect with Trail Songs: Dusk, below, and head to Wong’s website for the latest information on his forthcoming release, Trail Songs: Dawn.\n\nCory Wong – Trail Songs: Dusk"
