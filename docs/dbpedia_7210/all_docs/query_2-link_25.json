I also composed a new work, Memories of Snow, as a birthday gift for my wife Verena.\n\nThe sheet music book contains a photo associated with each title, as well as the cover and back cover images. More information about each photo, including equipment and settings used (for the photo nerds) is included in the book.\n\nPianist Ieva Jokubaviciute (Duke University) recorded these works for me in a beautifully-played album you may download in two forms: mp3 (pay what you choose), or high-resolution, 24-bit, 48kHz lossless AIFF ($8). Both downloads include cover art and album credits.\n\nThere are seven works included, all of easy-intermediate difficulty:\n\nNothing Gold Can Stay\n\nIdyll\n\nMemories of Snow (original piano work written as a gift for my wife)\n\nThe Low Arc of the Sun\n\nDusk\n\nNocturne\n\nThe Marbled Midnight Mile\n\nTechnical Info\n\nView Instrumentation List"
