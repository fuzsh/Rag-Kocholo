Nods and winks to the past meet a sound of the not-too-distant future, and with one foot in the sounds of early 70's classic rock and another in the punk and hardcore scenes of the late 80's and early 90's, Ladyfinger (ne) bring you Dusk.\n\nRecorded once again with Matt Bayles (Mastodon, Minus the Bear, Isis), Dusk is Ladyfinger (ne) at the peak of their powers. Witness Chris Machmuller's confidence in his vocals grow exponentially and Pat Oakes' powerhouse drums finding a firmer root to propel every snare hit and bass kick. An album clearly born of playing local dives and national tours over the last couple of years, Dusk is a statement of intent. The dynamics of each song and across the album are more evident, from the opening 1-2 punch of \"Over and Over\" and the bass growl of \"ADD\", through the sharp riffs and aggressiveness of \"Work Party\", the plaintive \"Plans,\" and into the hit-in-the-making \"Let's Get Married.\"\n\nRelease Date: February 3rd, 2009\n\nTRACK LIST\n\n01. Over and Over\n\n02. A.D.D.\n\n03. Little Things\n\n04. Two Years\n\n05. Read the Will\n\n06. Work Party\n\n07. Bones\n\n08. Plans\n\n09. Let's Get Married\n\n10. Born in the 80's"
