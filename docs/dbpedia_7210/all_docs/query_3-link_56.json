        "text": "Latin Grammy-winning singer and songwriter Gaby Moreno has announced the release of her upcoming album, Dusk, via Cosmica Artists, set for February 16th. In celebration, she shares her moving new single “Dance the Night Away.”\n\nBearing a sonic resemblance to a warm embrace, the single touches on the subtleties of shared love. With comfort, warmth, and release serving as the foundation of the track, we are given a glimpse into the greatest joys of partnership—the ability to share moments of stillness, or in this case, movement, with one another.\n\nGABY MORENO ON “DANCE THE NIGHT AWAY” :\n\n“’Dance The Night Away’ is a song that celebrates the joy of spending time with loved ones and slowing down. A moment to let go of worries and simply enjoy the moment.”\n\nDusk will feature stunning collaborations with close collaborators including a striking new rendition of her song “Luna de Xelajú“ featuring award-winning actor Oscar Isaac and the esteemed Van Dyke Parks on “I’ll Be Your Baby Tonight” who has been playing up with Gaby for over a decade.\n\nAn additional original track from Gaby’s forthcoming album is featured on the soundtrack for Eugenio Derbez’s critically acclaimed new film, Radical. Capturing a powerful story that has already received rave reviews nationally and resonates with Gaby’s own transformative work, the film is out in theaters today – for viewing information visit HERE.\n\nGaby will also be heading to the 2023 Latin Grammys with two nominations taking place in Seville, Spain on November 16th. In addition, Gaby has received US Grammy and Guild of Music Supervisors Awards nominations that continue to cement the artist as one of music’s most essential artists as a true trailblazer. Gaby deep impact on the musical landscape and her one-of-a-kind sound have garnered large critical acclaim and the attention of some of today’s most esteemed artists, which has led her to share the stage with the likes of Andrea Bocelli, Tracy Chapman, Ani DiFranco, Punch Brothers, Hugh Laurie, Buena Vista Social Club, Calexico, David Gray, and many more.\n\nOutside of her large critical acclaim and extensive accolades in TV and film, Gaby has proven to be a groundbreaking artist whose impact has extended beyond just music. Through her various projects, Gaby has broken down many barriers within these various realms which has undeniably opened the doors for other marginalized voices to thrive in those spaces. Simultaneously, Gaby has harnessed the power of her art to fight for those often overlooked such as immigrants globally. She was recently named the first UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador from Guatemala and works closely with various organizations that support those on the margins."
