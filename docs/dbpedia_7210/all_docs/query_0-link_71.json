        "text": "Whenever the thumbnail sketch of the 1960s American jazz avant-garde is drawn, Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Cecil Taylor or Sun Ra appear in the foreground - and even a half-dozen other faces might materialise before that of Andrew Hill, who has died aged 75 of lung cancer. A uniquely gifted composer, pianist and educator, his status remained largely inside knowledge in the jazz world for most of his career.\n\nBy his 20s, Hill had played piano with Charlie Parker and Miles Davis. In the early 1960s, Blue Note Records' Alfred Lion considered Hill his last great protege and \"the next Thelonious Monk\". As a pianist-composer, Hill's Point of Departure (1964) brought awed reactions across the jazz scene, for its dazzling exploration of jolting time-shifts and searing colours, and the eliciting of exceptional performances from stars such as Eric Dolphy, Joe Henderson and Davis drummer Tony Williams.\n\nYet Hill had no single breakthrough, as Coleman had for jettisoning song-based harmonies, or Coltrane for inventing the multi-voiced \"sheets of sound\" saxophone technique. Hill's work, which is difficult to categorise, stretched between American jazz, Caribbean, Latin and 20th-century classical music. Nor was Hill so single-minded an experimenter that he couldn't comprehend the commercial tricks of jazz - he once wrote a catchy funk pop hit for trumpeter Lee Morgan. Hill was a rounded, erudite, endlessly curious creator with a vision of how jazz's many tributaries might flow into one river.\n\nYet it was not until his mid-60s that the non-specialist world began to fully appreciate these qualities. In 1997, the Jazz Foundation of America awarded him for lifetime achievement and in 2003 he received Denmark's Jazzpar Prize, with its judges saying that he stood as \"a genuine original\".\n\nWith the new millennium (though from 2004 seriously ill), he released a stream of bold albums, and toured Britain with an Anglo-American big band that remains a glowing memory for those who heard it or played in it. Hill unleashed music full of ducking, diving melodies against riptides of cross-rhythms, Gil Evans-like harmonies, sax-choir clamourings, and exultant, Latin-tinged ensemble dances. British trumpeter Byron Wallen considers the experience of meeting and working with Hill as a turning point in his musical life. For his part, the receptive, selfless Hill heard in Wallen's world-music sensibilities qualities close to his own.\n\nHill was born to Haitian parents, and raised on Chicago's largely black South Side. He played piano, accordion and tap-danced at first - \"I could play the piano as long as I've been talking\" he told an interviewer - and in his early teens came to the notice of pianist Earl \"Fatha\" Hines. Hines and Stan Kenton arranger Bill Russo heard Hill's potential, and introduced him to the expatriate German composer Paul Hindemith, a crucial educational process for the young artist. At 21, Hill began playing bop-piano gigs around Chicago clubs, and accompanied Parker, Davis and Coleman Hawkins.\n\nIn 1961, he moved to New York, performing with Dinah Washington, and with the charismatic multi-instrumentalist Rahsaan Roland Kirk, the latter a significant influence, as a resourceful player and a campaigner for what he called \"black classical music\". In 1963, Hill began his association with Blue Note. The label's glamorous regulars included reed-players Joe Henderson and Eric Dolphy, trumpeter Freddie Hubbard and pianist Herbie Hancock. In 1965 Hill became music coordinator for Amiri Baraka's (then LeRoi Jones's) Black Arts Repertory Theatre. During this period, Hill recorded extensively for Blue Note (material that mostly went out of circulation, but has now been rescued on a Mosaic label seven-disc set).\n\nHill spent much of the next two decades teaching, but the last phase of his 60s Blue Note work mingled free-jazz, classical references - even the appearance of a cor anglais - the Latin music of Passing Ships and the vocal explorations of Lift Every Voice (both 1969). Passing Ships was shelved as \"uncommercial\", but finally released by Hill in 2004.\n\nIn the 1970s and 80s, he occasionally made spikily elegant, distantly Monkish solo-piano and small-group appearances. But he mostly avoided the recording studio, touring with the Smithsonian Heritage Programme, teaching in schools and prisons, and, in 1989, performing at New York's experimental hothouse, the Knitting Factory.\n\nIn 1990 Hill came to Britain to join a piano project featuring keyboardists Howard Riley, Joachim Kuhn and Jason Rebello. Hill's sophistication as a composer sometimes sidelined the critical reception for his piano-playing, but from roots in Bud Powell and Monk he had developed a unique signature, marked by dark, harmonically startling chords, jagged improvised lines, and an overlooked singing, joyous quality.\n\nHe made three exceptional albums between 1999 and 2006: Dusk, A Beautiful Day and Time Lines, the latter getting Down Beat's album of the year and a five-star Guardian review from this writer. Dusk used the same instrumentation as Point of Departure, and showed Hill looking a little unsteadily for new possibilities in favourite rhythmic ideas, but the live recording A Beautiful Day suggested a relish for his renaissance. Time Lines was a mix of tantalising repeated hoots and out-phase-rejoinders over odd, slowly bumping meters, mournful brass sounds and soaring clarinet melodies.\n\nIn his absence now, Berklee College of Music will present Hill with an honorary doctorate of music on May 12 - Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie and Quincy Jones have also been recipients.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Joanne Robinson Hill, a niece and a nephew."
