        "text": "Boy Named Banjo, the Nashville-based quintet, is making waves in the music industry with their new album, Dusk. This album serves as a testament to their unique blend of influences, ranging from traditional bluegrass harmonies to bold, cinematic arrangements. We had the opportunity at Pilgrimage Festival in Franklin, Tennessee, to sit down with the band members, including Barton Davies (banjo), William Reames (guitar, harmonica), Willard Logan (mandolin, acoustic/electric guitar), Sam McCullough (drums), and Ford Garrard (bass), to discuss their musical journey and the making of Dusk.\n\n‘Dusk’ features nine tracks that not only highlight the band’s lyrical prowess but also showcase their sonic versatility, weaving together influences from Americana, folk-rock, bluegrass, and more. The album, produced by their longtime collaborator Oscar Charles, embarks on a captivating sonic journey that transcends traditional genres. From heartfelt lyricism to lush harmonies and cinematic arrangements, Boy Named Banjo’s major label debut serves as a testament to their artistic evolution.\n\nThe band’s creative process was spontaneous and collaborative. “A lot of our influences came out in the moments. We’d pick a song we were excited about recording, listen to it at its most bare-bones stage with our producer, and then build the song within a 10-minute period. It was all spur-of-the-moment, forcing us to rely on our instincts, which were shaped by our diverse backgrounds.”\n\n“Lonely in this Town”\n\nAs they unveil the exciting news of their upcoming album release, Boy Named Banjo treats fans to the soul-stirring single “Lonely In This Town.” Barton Davies, the band’s banjo virtuoso, dives into the song’s essence, describing it as a blend of uplifting and euphoric music with lyrics that convey a contrasting sense of loneliness and happiness, making it a unique and compelling addition to their discography. Accompanied by a thought-provoking music video, this single marks a significant chapter in the band’s evolving narrative.\n\n“I’ve always felt like ‘Lonely In This Town’ is best enjoyed driving with the windows down in your car,” shares banjo player Barton Davies. “The music feels uplifting and euphoric with the three-part harmonies and steady groove, but then the lyrics come in and give the complete opposite vibe. It’s almost like you’re lonely but you’re happy about it. I love that duality in the song.”\n\nBoy Named Banjo’s creative process was characterized by its spontaneity and collaboration. They would select a song they were excited about recording, listen to it in its most basic form with their producer, and then sometimes build the song within a 10-minute window. This approach allowed them to rely on their instincts, influenced by their diverse musical backgrounds.\n\nTheir decision to go “rogue” during the recording process was driven by a desire to stay true to their music. “During 2020, we had just been signed, and the world shut down. We didn’t know what to do with our music that had been written but not recorded. So we said, ‘Screw it. We’re just gonna go in and do what we love to do.’ Luckily, our team rallied behind the music, and here we are,” they explained.\n\nIn the end, “Dusk” represents a harmonious blend of their diverse influences. Boy Named Banjo’s willingness to embrace different sounds and take risks while staying true to their roots showcases their growth as artists. This album is a testament to their musical journey, and it’s clear that the band is just getting started.\n\nDusk Track Listing\n\n“Something ‘Bout A Sunset”\n\n“Heart Attack”\n\n“Feel For You (Dusk)”\n\n“Young Forever”\n\n“Whiskey Dreams”\n\n“Mama, I’m Misbehavin’”\n\n“Goodbyes Are Sad”\n\n“Lonely In This Town”\n\n“Opposite Directions”\n\nPilgrimage Festival Performance\n\nNot only did the band take the main stage for festival attendees, but they teamed up with George Dickel to offer an exclusive, more intimate performance.
