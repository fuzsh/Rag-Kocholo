        "text": "Today, versatile Danish producer Fabian Mazur has shared his debut full-length album, DUSK, out now via Create Music Group.\n\nAfter gaining early notoriety for trap bangers like 2016’s “Right Now” and 2017’s “Arena,” Mazur continues to expand his multi-faceted sound on DUSK, blending his signature rhythm and bounce flair with new vocals written and performed by the artist himself.\n\nInspired by Mazur’s mother Marilyn, a world-renowned percussionist who used to play with jazz legend Miles Davis, the 16-track LP uses percussive themes to capture a range of feelings, journeying from emotional sounds on “Take Over The World” to high-energy bass-fueled rhythms found on “Whip It Up” and “Represent.”\n\nFrom boom-bap vibes on “Bounce 01 (Til I Die)” to future trap sounds on “Dangerous” and liquid drum & bass on “Trouble,” the album successfully bridges the gap between hip-hop, R&B and modern electronic dance music.\n\nIn addition to dishing out genre-melding tracks, Mazur has been heralded for his consistent presence and acumen in the industry, helping to mold the next generation of artists by sharing millions of samples on Splice, in addition to conducting his own production and DJ tutorials via YouTube, Instagram and a Spotify Masterclass.\n\nListen to Fabian Mazur’s debut album, DUSK, below.\n\nFeatured image from Fabian Mazur."
