        "text": "Description\n\nSOLOS: the jazz sessions is a 39 part television music profile/performance series. Each episode features complete musical pieces, interviews and behind-the-scenes footage with some of today's most notable jazz artists. Shot in HDTV with multiple moving cameras and a medley of elegant, cinematic lighting designs, SOLOS: the jazz sessions showcases an exciting and dynamic variety of jazz styles from the blues and boogie-woogie to bebop and beyond.\n\nThis DVD spotlights Andrew Hill, a great and arguably groundbreaking composer and pianist and is recognized as one of the most important progenitors of free jazz piano. His most-lauded work was recorded for Blue Note Records, spanning nearly a decade and producing a dozen albums. As a pianist, Hill had a flowing melodicism and an elastic sense of time. Like his composing, Hill's playing had an ever-present air of spontaneity and was almost completely devoid of clich. His album Dusk was selected as the best album of 2001 by both Down Beat and JazzTimes; and in 2003, Hill received the Jazzpar Prize (an annual Danish award for jazz excellence, held in Copenhagen)."
