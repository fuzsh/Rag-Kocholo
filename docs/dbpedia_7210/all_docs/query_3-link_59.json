        "text": "Boslen is a proud Canadian hip-hop artist from Vancouver. At just 22-years-old, he has already cultivated some impressive work, the latest being his August 2021 release of DUSK to DAWN. It’s his second studio album and includes 12 songs with some features by other up-and-coming artists like Vory and Tyla Yaweh. DUSK to DAWN includes tracks which were released as singles and are actually some of Boslen’s most popular songs, like his breakthrough song, “VULTURES,” and “DENY,” each with over two million streams on Spotify.\n\nThe album is not your typical hip-hop album; it blends some modern R&B elements into his already unique sound. Through his unique writing, producing and sequencing, listeners can quickly come to recognize and appreciate the way Boslen designed his album to tell a story. With over nine singles and two studio albums now released, it is safe to say that Boslen is on track to building a successful career for himself.\n\nThere is so much versatility in Boslen’s music and voice, as he tells a distinctive narrative through the cohesive album. His voice resembles Travis Scott, but there is a tenderness to it that makes it unique, especially when he shows off his vocal range. The ability to sing at such a low range while also being able to have a liveliness in his voice is very impressive. In a song like “HAVE YOU,” he really demonstrates his vocal abilities.\n\nBoslen also has a raspiness to his voice that is very comforting, it is not just that he is singing or rapping but the way in which he articulates each word while also keeping with the music make his voice feel very genuine. The authenticity and emotion he shows in his singing is close to that of Giveon, another big name growing in the industry today. While he draws comparisons to artists like these, his sound stands on its own as both fresh and one of a kind.\n\nFrom the album title alone, DUSK to DAWN, fans can already deduce that Bolsen intends on guiding them through a story. Based on the music, there is a gradual transition from dark and deep feelings in the first half to lighter and airy undercurrents in the second half. Listening just to the first and last tracks —“DUSK” and “DAWN” respectively — there is already cohesion between the two and a clear theme to tell. In “DAWN,” for example, there is a subtle and steady key progression that feels like the fresh airiness of a sun rising in the mornings. There is something profound in that and it speaks to Boslen’s artistry and close attention to detail.\n\nOne aspect of the album that instantly stands out is the pace at which it moves. There is not much urgency in the songs which makes the album an enjoyable and easy listen. In the opening track, the slow progression and building up of the electronic piano and soft adlibs set the tone for what the album is about to be. It connects music to the feeling of being in the dark and feeling lost to coming into the light and finding yourself and loving what you have around you. Boslen is taking listeners on a journey as he goes through the dusk and into the dawn.\n\nBoth sonically and musically, he truly shows off his artistry and care on DUSK to DAWN. For example, the seamless transition between the opening song, “DUSK” into “VULTURES” made it seem as though the two songs were one; you might not have even realized the song changed. With a song like “NOTE TO THE CITY (INTERLUDE),” there is a soft harmony in the background to start off, which really slows down the pace of the album but soon after, it quickly picks up again.\n\nThe music of the album flows nicely and connects each song to the next. However, it can feel quite repetitive and lose distinction at times. While cohesion and fluidity in an album is nice, mixing up the beat and rhythm and going into different keys or changing the pace can really make a difference and highlight contrasting songs and messages.\n\nAnother song that stands out is “NOTE TO THE CITY (INTERLUDE).” Boslen has spoken very openly about his work ethic and how it connects to his Vancouver pride and with a song like this, it becomes very evident. The song shows his love for the city by saying that he would give everything up for it. The personification of the city makes what he is saying so much more meaningful; he sounds as though he is singing to or about a lover, but he could really be directing his words to Vancouver.\n\nHis song, “NIGHTFALL” similarly stands out lyrically: “I’ve been losing faith / I’ve been lost for a minute / I’ve been out of place.” There is no holding back in these songs and the authenticity of Boslen that is coming through is so strong. Dro Kenji’s feature elevates the song, as the sound of his voice brings you to this hazy feeling and slows down the pace as it carries you into a rap, challenging you to go along this roller-coaster with him. These are just some of the tracks which stand out on DUSK to DAWN, but from these songs alone, Boslen proves that he puts the work into every element of his music.\n\nWhen you take into consideration that this is only Boslen’s second studio album, he highlights his potential to be a star in the hip-hop/R&B scene. This album feels modern and encapsulates the hip-hop/R&B fusion of today. Vocally and lyrically, Boslen demonstrates how honest and unique of an artist he is. Musically and sonically, he stands out and exemplifies new and different sounds, but more versatility in this department could give him much more edge.\n\nIf you are looking to broaden your music horizons or are looking for a new artist on the rise, Boslen might be the artist for you. He has elements to him that are reminiscent of other popular artists today but still sticks out with a voice and story of his own. Boslen has a bright future ahead of him, and DUSK to DAWN is just the start."
