        "text": "This is the sixth full-length album by Brazilian unblack metal band Imperial Dusk. The keyboard sounds on this album are a real struggle at first, and they mixed them loud so you can only hear them. Once you get used to them, it’s easy to see that this album has some good music on it. I admit that the cleaner “Viking”-style vocal sort of threw me at first, but the more I listened to them, the more I liked them. This is underground unblack and not commercialized in anyway, so if you are looking for something with easy hooks and stellar production, steer away. This is war against hell! Now, if only someone would give them a good keyboard.\n\nAbout the Author"
