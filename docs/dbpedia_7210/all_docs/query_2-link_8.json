        "text": "Info for Dusk\n\nGuatemalan artist Gaby Moreno is set to release her ninth album, 'Dusk'. Moreno's music, a fusion of blues, rock 'n' roll, and Latin folk, performed in both English and Spanish, straddles both her Guatemalan roots and her life in the United States. Moreno, now a resident of Los Angeles for about two decades, embraces her dual identity as an 'Angelteca' - a term that beautifully merges her Guatemalan roots and her life as an Angeleno.\n\nMusically speaking, Gaby Moreno is a difficult artist to categorize. From folk to blues and Latin and baroque pop, she does a little bit of everything. These elements are expectedly in play on her new album, Dusk. But the record is more than a continuation of familiar, pleasing themes, as Moreno tinkers with different sonic textures and approaches to deliver another satisfying album.\n\nDusk kicks off with “Let it Fade.” At its core, it’s a piano-based ballad about overcoming adversity. But what makes it work is how Moreno and producer Dan Knobler maximize the atmospherics of the song, utilizing a string arrangement that is minimalist at first and builds to a triumphant crescendo that matches the emotional journey of Moreno’s lyrics and impassioned vocal delivery.\n\n“Solid Ground” plays like an early 1970s Rolling Stones cut, with its swaggering, danceable blues-rock riff. But unlike the Stones, Moreno doesn’t use that sonic template to revel in excess and debauchery; she’s using it to yearn for stability and a sense of belonging. It pairs nicely with “Ain’t That the Way it Goes.” The ramshackle rocker is inspired by Moreno’s move from Guatemala to the United States to change her life and find new, better opportunities.\n\nThis theme, the immigrant experience, echoes her 2019 LP Spangled!, a collaboration with legendary songwriter and arranger Van Dyke Parks. Moreno renews her partnership with Parks on Dusk with a cover of Bob Dylan’s classic “I’ll Be Your Baby Tonight.” The casual nature of it contrasts nicely with Moreno’s duet with actor Oscar Isaac on the traditional Guatemalan ballad “Luna de Xelajú.” Previously released as an acoustic duet on last year’s X Mí (Vol. 1), a collection that won the Grammy for Best Latin Pop Album, the Dusk rendition is a full-band affair. The arrangement and tweaks to the track provide a different approach to the material without losing any of the warmth and emotional heft of Moreno and Isaac’s vocals.\n\nDusk concludes with “Dance the Night Away.” The ballad is an ode to companionship and finding solace in the embrace of a significant other. Moreno’s sincerity and warmth carry the song and end the album on a pleasing note.\n\n\"In ‘Dusk’ Moreno has produced an excellent record optimising her own input with the skills of her collaborators (writers and players). It’s well scoped to achieve a wide appeal and provide a snapshot of the breadth of her repertoire.\" (Richard Parkinson, americana-uk.com)\n\nGaby Moreno\n\nGaby Moreno\n\nSince moving to Los Angeles from her native Guatemala, singer-songwriter-producer Gaby Moreno has released eight albums and earned 4 GRAMMY nominations for her albums “Illusion” (Best Latin Pop Album, 2017) , “Alegoría” (Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album, 2022), \"X Mí (Vol. 1)\" (Best Latin Pop Album - 2023) and for producing legendary cuban singer Omara Portuondo's album \"Vida\" (Best Latin Tropical Album - 2023). She is also a 5 time nominee and winner of a Latin GRAMMY for “Best New Artist” (2013).\n\nOver her career, Moreno has shared the international stage with music luminaries such as Tracy Chapman, Ani DiFranco, Hugh Laurie and The Copper Bottom Band, Punch Brothers, Chris Thile, Punch Brothers, Nickel Creek, Buena Vista Social Club, Calexico, David Gray, Los Lobos, Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings, Taj Mahal, Jackson Browne, Van Dyke Parks and many more. She has had the honor of performing several times at Lincoln Center in NYC and The Kennedy Center in Washington, DC.\n\nGaby co-wrote the theme song for the multiple award-winning TV series Parks and Recreation (NBC). She sings the theme song and voices a character on the multiple Emmy Award-winning Disney children’s TV series, “Elena of Avalor,” which features Disney's first Latina princess.\n\nMoreno’s 2019 album, ¡Spangled! — a collaboration with musician, songwriter and arranger, Van Dyke Parks — is a set of ten songs celebrating the migration of music across the Americas. The album features, “Across The Borderline” a duet with Jackson Browne and an art cover designed by Klaus Voormann (who designed The Beatles’ Revolver cover). It received a Latin GRAMMY nomination in the “Best Traditional Pop Album” (2020).\n\nIn 2020 she composed all the music for the movie “Language Lessons,” directed by Natalie Morales and co-written/starring Morales and Mark Duplass.\n\nHer songs have been featured on film and TV, more recently recording the Lydia Mendoza 1932 song “Mal Hombre” for Guillermo del Toro’s TV series “Cabinet of Curiosities” (Netflix). Gaby appears in the episode “Dreams in The Witch House” singing the song. She also co-wrote and sings the song “Por Qué Te Vas?” in the Dreamworks animated film “Puss in Boots - The Last Wish”, nominated for an Academy Award in the “Best Animated Film” category. Another song she co-wrote and sang in the movie “The Valet” (Hulu) starring Eugenio Derbez and Samara Weaving, earned her a nomination in the “Guild of Music Supervisors Awards” in the “Best Song written/recorded for a Film”. She was nominated alongside Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Lady Gaga and David Byrne. Her song \"El Saber\" was written for the film \"Radical\" (2023) starring Eugenio Derbez and received a nomination in the \"Hollywood in Music Media Awards\" for \"Best Song for an Independent Film\".\n\nHer GRAMMY nominated album “Alegoría” (Best Latin/Rock alternative album. 2022) was self-produced, featuring songs in English and Spanish in what she describes as her love letter to Los Angeles and the musical community that has nurtured and inspired her. It features her guitar heroes Marc Ribot, Davíd Garza and drum legend Jim Keltner. ‍\n\nHer GRAMMY nominated acoustic EP “X Mí (Vol. 1)” (Best Latin Pop Album - 2023) ushers in a new chapter for the beloved artist, pronounced “Por Mi”, this album is a collection of rich and soulful acoustic songs that have remained dear to Gaby’s heart for years now in both English and Spanish. It’s lined with Gaby’s one-of-a-kind sound that has garnered large critical acclaim and the attention of some of today’s most esteemed artists. ‍\n\nGaby’s tantalizing lead single “Luna de Xelajú” featuring Golden Globe-winning and Emmy-nominated actor, producer, and musician Oscar Isaac has received large critical acclaim from Rolling Stone, Variety, Billboard, Entertainment Weekly, People en Español, Popsugar, Latina Magazine, and CNN en Español. ‍\n\nOutside of her large critical acclaim and extensive accolades in TV and film, Gaby has proven to be a groundbreaking artist whose impact has extended beyond just music. Through her various projects, Gaby has redefined Americana as the only prominent Latina in the genre today, ultimately opening the doors for other marginalized voices and transforming the landscape overall. Simultaneously, Gaby has harnessed the power of her art to fight for those often overlooked such as immigrants globally. She was recently named the first UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador from Guatemala and works closely with various organizations that support those on the margins."
