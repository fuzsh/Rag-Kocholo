        "text": "Fat Jon the Ample Soul Physician used some of the drums on the opening track Minor Cause on his song Talk To Me.\n\n10 stars bro.\n\nThanks for reading guys, that's a wrap brosepfs.\n\nTee hee bros.\n\nEmancipator is fucking beastly in my opinion, as his first album Soon It Will Be Cold Enough was on constant repeat back whenever the Fuck that dropped. (It was 2006 bro, I googled for you bro.) The guy just has this penchant for making calmingly headnodding beatscapes that even assholes you don't like personally are fond of, and it does a swell job of partially culturing those fuckernuters too.\n\nEmancipator takes instrumentation familiar to the genres of classical or jazz and slyly slips them into his tracks, and it's gorgeous.\n\nEmancipator's latest album is titled Dusk To Dawn and it's another step in the progression of a producer who is fucking already amazingly talented, but you can almost feel it in your throat and your goosepimpled skin that this dude isn't even close to realizing his full potential. After hearing what this dude can do with a simple violin lick and a room full of synthesizers and samplers, can anyone else imagine this dude live-sampling a fucking orchestra and pulling percussion samples off of records we beatfreaks know (like the aforementioned Fat Jon shit) and flipping the balls off of them?\n\nThe opening track Minor Cause is a perfect welcome into this next display of Emancipator, both soothing and haunting, it's 'stare out at the fog rolling in/thank god you brought extra socks because these are already moist' perfection. I can honestly picture myself climbing fucking rocks under a grey sky and towering pines, my beard looking epic as Fuck and my hands filthy from all the moss. Moss bro. Moss everywhere.\n\nDusk To Dawn has that take off by yourself and rediscover the world around you shit going on with it. And when the violins on this album get riffing, it's difficult to not start some of these fucking tracks over to do it all over again.\n\nThis entire album, one track at a time, has the power to take your lazy ass anywhere you can imagine. I shit you not, I've gone through the whole thing and will quickly brief you on my favorite locales I was awarded with traveling to in me brain while listening to Dusk To Dawn.\n\nSecond track Valhalla is what would be playing on my patio if I lived on the grounds of a vinyard and it was always 15 minutes before sunset. It's damp and comfortable, and coffee sipping fucking hell yeah.\n\nOutlaw is the 2013 instrumental hip hop version of a Kanye West video shot in an ultra modern mansion where everything is white and I don't make smudges, even though I'm a total smudger bro. There are smudges all over all my shit bro. Outlaw is the anti-smudge shit, and everything is clean as Fuck bro.\n\nTitle track Dusk To Dawn is smoking awesome weed in Nashville. If you haven't done that there, do that there to this track here.\n\nThe Way is fucking waking up on the set of Slumdog Millionaire, in that one high rise building without the exterior walls bro.\n\nThis album comes at the perfect time, when most of us are stuck a little bit longer than normal in our choice of personal vehicles. We all needed this album. To pull ourselves out of the fucking bullshit misery that is the month of February and this godforsaken never ending winter, Emancipator is tossing us a fucking rope here bros.\n\nWe can either choose to hang ourselves to it, or appreciate it for what it is. And what it is, is a beautiful album that has both relaxed me and inspired me to tell as many people as possible about its amazing powers of inter-imaginary transportation."
