        "text": "ASTRO's youngest member, YOON SAN-HA is continuing to make a name for himself as a solo artist. 2024 marks the year when the artist will show more of himself through various projects. That is, SAN-HA's solo debut with the mini-album 'DUSK,' which is his first solo record, as well as his acting comeback with his main role in the upcoming drama 'Romance in the House,' scheduled to air in August. And it doesn't end here: SAN-HA recently confirmed his appearance as Park Yoon Jae in the webtoon-based drama 'My Girlfriend is a Tough Man.'\n\nEight years after debuting in ASTRO, SAN-HA is ready to embark on his solo adventure. His first solo album 'DUSK,' released on August 6, contains a total of six tracks, one of which the artist took part in penning and composing the song: \"여우별 (FOX STAR),\" \"Losing My Mind,\" \"BITTERSWEET MISTAKE,\" the title track \"Dive,\" \"BLEEDING,\" and \"Rain Down On Me.\"\n\nAhead of SAN-HA's official solo debut, allkpop caught up with him to talk about 'DUSK,' the process of writing the song \"여우별 (FOX STAR),\" and more. Read our exclusive interview with the artist below!\n\nShout-out from SAN-HA to allkpop:\n\nallkpop: First and foremost, congratulations on your solo album! Could you please share with us what made you name the album ‘DUSK,’ and since when did you start planning for your solo debut? I noticed the track list and there are different versions of you that look like the phases of the moon. Is there any reason or meaning behind why you incorporated that as well?\n\nSAN-HA: Thank you! There was a time when I lacked confidence musically. I often wondered, \"What is my color?\" and felt quite confused. But then, in March, I held a small theater concert and spent joyful moments with my fans. Feeling their cheers and support made me feel truly alive. It was during this time that discussions about a solo album with the company naturally came up. With the track list, I wanted to showcase the transition from ASTRO's youngest member, Sanha, to solo YOON SAN-HA. It seems like many people are seeing this as a lunar phase. And looking at it now, I can see why that might be the case.\n\nallkpop: As this is your first solo album, I was wondering how your fellow ASTRO members reacted to the news. Is there anything you want to share with us regarding that?\n\nSAN-HA: Everyone congratulated me and offered a lot of support while I was preparing the album. During the production, I played the incomplete tracks for the members and they gave me a lot of feedback. As the release approached, they often told me how much they appreciated my hard work!\n\nallkpop: You’ve experienced writing for your group, unit, and now as solo for your first album. How different the experience was, especially now that you focus more on showcasing the solo artist SANHA? Did you feel a bigger improvement in terms of that aspect when you worked on “여우별 (FOX STAR)” as its lyricist and composer? Tell us how the writing process went as well as your inspirations behind it.\n\nSAN-HA: As this is my solo album under the name YOON SAN-HA, I wanted to showcase my own music style. In that context, I included a track called \"여우별 (FOX STAR),\" which I wrote and composed. I find a lot of comfort when I look at the sky before twilight, so I wanted to create a song that conveys that warmth and tranquility. I composed and wrote the lyrics with those feelings and themes in mind. Preparing for this solo album came with its challenges and new experiences, but I believe these experiences have greatly contributed to my growth. Although I haven't fully started my promotional activities yet, I hope to capture my youth with this album.\n\nallkpop: Since the album title is ‘DUSK,’ is dusk your favorite time of the day? What do you usually do during that time?\n\nSAN-HA: My favorite time is when I'm sleeping! But I also really love dusk! The colors of the sky during dusk are so beautiful. When I just sit and watch the sky during that time, I find myself taking a deep breath and feeling truly alive.\n\nallkpop: Which track from the album is your favorite, and why? If you could pick only one song to introduce SANHA to someone, which song would you choose?\n\nSAN-HA: I'll go with \"여우별 (FOX STAR),\" a song I wrote and composed. \"여우별\" started with questions like, \"How are my older members feeling right now?\" and \"What am I feeling?\" I created it with a lot of thoughts about the members. I wanted to make a song that warms the heart, so I focused on the theme of \"warmth\" while working on it.\n\nallkpop: Is there something you want your fans, AROHAs, to take note of while listening to the album or watching your music video? In what way do you want them to see SANHA’s vision and artistry through this record?\n\nSAN-HA: I hope you focus on the real me. When I was filming the jacket photos and music video, I felt that the way I appeared on camera was different from my usual self. It seemed like the atmosphere had changed a lot. Also, this album features a lot of new challenges and styles compared to my previous music, so I hope listeners will think, \"Wow, this artist can explore these genres too!\"\n\nallkpop: What big differences did you notice between working with your fellow members vs. working on a solo album? What adjustments did you need to make?\n\nSAN-HA: When I was working as part of a team, I often followed and relied on the opinions of the other members. But working alone made me realize how amazing they are. I noticed things that I hadn't seen before while preparing on my own. Also, I found it hardest to adjust to the loneliness. There were many times when I really missed the other members while preparing alone.\n\nallkpop: Are there any TMIs or memorable moments that happened during the album preparation, such as song recording and music video filming? What has been your favorite memory from the ‘DUSK’ preparations?\n\nSAN-HA: For TMI, we filmed the music video in London, where many of the shots had to be taken after sunset. However, during the shoot, we encountered the phenomenon of midnight sun, so the sun set around 9 or 10 PM. We ended up starting our shoot at 10 PM and continued until morning. As for my favorite memory, it's hard to pick just one because everything was wonderful. Although preparing everything alone was challenging, those moments were still very special to me.\n\nallkpop: Is there anything we should look forward to from you for the rest of the year and next year as well? Maybe a solo tour and more activities?\n\nSAN-HA: Currently, my goal is to hold a concert where I can personally share the songs from this album with my fans. Also, the drama will be released on Netflix in August, so I hope it receives a lot of interest and love from you!\n\nallkpop: Lastly, please leave a message for allkpop readers and your fans who have long waited for your solo album!\n\nSAN-HA: I know you've been waiting a long time, and I feel sorry for making you wait so much. I promise to work hard and show you many great things in return for your patience. I'll make sure to enjoy every moment of my activities! Thank you!\n\nSocials:"
