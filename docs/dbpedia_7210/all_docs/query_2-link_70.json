        "text": "BOSLEN RELEASES DEBUT ALBUM DUSK to DAWN\n\nLISTEN HERE\n\nFEATURES INCLUDE TYLA YAWEH, VORY, DRO KENJI, RASCALZ, & CHARMAINE\n\n“Redefining what Black music can look, feel and sound like…”\n\n— FADER\n\n“Boslen is on a clear cut path for international stardom.”\n\n— Lyrical Lemonade\n\n“Boslen has been making a name for himself”\n\n— HotNewHipHop\n\n24 AUGUST 2021 (TORONTO, ON) — Today, Vancouver-bred genre-defying artist Boslen shares his debut album DUSK to DAWN. The 22-year-old rapper’s first body of work since signing to Capitol Records/Universal Music Canada, the country’s leading music company in partnership with Chaos Club Digital, DUSK to DAWN showcases Boslen’s eclectic and forward-thinking brand of alt-hip-hop, as well as his deeply reflective approach to storytelling.\n\nListen to DUSK to DAWN HERE\n\nFeaturing guest spots from Tyla Yaweh, Vory, Dro Kenji, Rascalz, and Charmaine, DUSK to DAWN draws its undeniable power from Boslen’s boundary-pushing vocal experiments, shapeshifting transitions, and heavier production than he’s attempted before. After opening on the soulful minimalism of “DUSK,” the album cycles through an entire spectrum of textures and moods, ultimately arriving at the beautifully warped “DAWN.” Naming hyper-creative artists like Kid Cudi among his main inspirations, Boslen notes that DUSK to DAWN emerged from a desire to explore how vulnerability and self-empowerment can co-exist.\n\n“On this album more than anything, I was the most vulnerable I’ve ever been on a project,” Boslen stated in a recent interview with Flaunt Magazine. “I really took risks and I really took my time…It can be a cinematic experience for anybody to resonate with. You can have a song that you can sit there and think about, but the very next song you can rage out like at a festival or on a stage.”\n\nExecutive-produced by justsayin, DUSK to DAWN features a number of previously released singles, including “TRIP” (praised by Atwood Magazine as a “smoldering song full of soaring, woozy psychedelia and raw lyricism”), “DENY” feat. Tyla Yaweh (a pop-punk-inspired track that inspired HotNewHipHop to hail Boslen as “one of Canada’s most exciting hip-hop exports”), and “QUARTZ” feat. Charmaine (deemed “ferocious” by Flaunt). See below for the complete tracklist to DUSK to DAWN.\n\nA fast-rising artist with a proven track record of boldly defying genre barriers, Boslen first burst onto the scene with his acclaimed 2018 mixtape Motionless. DUSK to DAWN marks his first new project since the Black Lotus EP, a 2019 effort that peaked at #11 on the Canadian Apple Music streaming charts.\n\nDUSK to DAWN Tracklist\n\nDUSK\n\nVULTURES\n\nFORSAKEN feat.

The 22-year-old hip-hop experimenter lives in Vancouver, and the city’s people have become key to the way he understands himself and his art. A land of contrasts — snowy peaks and warm water, beautiful nature, and busy streets — it’s the perfect home for an artist who reconciles disparate energies, weaving together styles and sounds that don't intuitively connect. DUSK to DAWN, his Capitol Records debut, furthers this adventurous approach, mixing trap, pop, punk, and rock melodies, and it’s also directly inspired by his city — a place that drives him to be different, to achieve greatness when no one expects him to. Boslen first emerged as an artist in 2018, when he dropped out of school, moved to North Vancouver, and released the Motionless and Motionless II mixtapes. He found his footing in 2019 with the energetic, confrontational songs “Eye for an Eye” and “Hidden Nights,” which garnered millions of streams. In 2019, he released the Black Lotus EP, but even with so many songs out in the world, DUSK to DAWN feels like a step forward, full of boundary-pushing vocal experiments, heavier production, and shapeshifting transitions. The music finally matches the tumultuous emotions he’s captured in his lyrics all along. He may not be able to pull every listener into Vancouver, but he’s using the city’s contrasts as a backdrop to challenge everyone to think beyond themselves — to dream big."
