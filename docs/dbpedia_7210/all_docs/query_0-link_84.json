        "text": "Edition: Paperback Book, Piano\n\nDescription: 52 Pages\n\nLegendary pianist and composer Andrew Hill (1931-2007) defied categorization for over four decades with his enigmatic and sophisticated musical style. He has over forty recordings to his credit and professional accolades that include being named Jazz Composer of the Year five times by the Jazz Journalists Association, a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Jazz Foundation of America, and his final album Time Lines voted Best Jazz Album by DownBeat magazine.\n\nThis marks the first published music by this groundbreaking composer/pianist/ensemble leader, called the “last great protégé” by Blue Note Records' founder Alfred Lion. This commemerative folio includes forewords by Michael Cuscuna and Greg Osby as well as photos, a bio, quotes from Hill about music and life, and much more. Other contributors include: Ron Horton, Frank Kimbrough, Jeffrey Lovell, Jason Moran, and Mrs. Joanne Robinson Hill."
