        "text": "It seems Scotland loves vampires. Dusk: A Bite-Size Love Story, a musical parody of the hit Twilight Saga film franchise, has sold out their entire Edinburgh Festival Fringe run. Co-written by Morgan Kennedy and Daniel Ruffing, this is virtually unheard of for first-time Fringe artists. But luckily, more performances have been added to the last week of the show's run. Dusk plays until August 26, and from August 21â€“26, the show has added performances at 12:50 PM (the 10:15 PM shows are sold out).\n\nThe musical quickly gained attention on social media after clips of a Pennsylvania workshop production were uploaded online. Dusk has already racked up more than five million likes on TikTok alone.\n\nFor any Twihard who cannot make it to Edinburgh, they can purchase the filmed version of the show for $15. See a music video from the show below.\n\nThe parody reimagines Edward and Bella as Edwin and Bia, with beloved characters from the cult franchise coming to life through a series of inside-baseball references, in addition to more open parody, and satire."
