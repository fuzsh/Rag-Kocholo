        "text": "Boy Named Banjo is set to release their major label debut album Dusk on Sept. 29 via Mercury Nashville. Along with the announcement, the band has shared their new single “Lonely In This Town” as well as a new video for the song.\n\n“I’ve always felt like ‘Lonely In This Town’ is best enjoyed driving with the windows down in your car,” shares Boy Named Banjo’s Barton Davies. “The music feels uplifting and euphoric with the three-part harmonies and steady groove, but then the lyrics come in and give the complete opposite vibe. It’s almost like you’re lonely but you’re happy about it. I love that duality in the song.”\n\nProduced by longtime collaborator Oscar Charles, Dusk‘s nine tracks run the gamut from late-night, fall-in-love party anthems to stripped-down meditations. The songs grapple with lust and longing, hope and heartbreak, and the band’s performances blur the lines between Music Row and Laurel Canyon with lush harmonies and bold cinematic arrangements.\n\nBoy Named Banjo will kick off their coast-to-coast “Dusk Til Dawn Tour” on Sept. 14 in Atlanta, with a local stop at the Pilgrimage Music & Cultural Festival in Franklin, Tennessee on Sept. 23 and dates in Louisville, San Diego, Savannah, Charleston, Birmingham, Brooklyn and more through Dec. 2. Audiences will be treated to performances from their extensive catalog and new music from Dusk, in addition to their recent anthem “What Keeps Me Going.”"
