I really enjoyed doing it (last year I wrote that “[small, independent record labels have] consistently been a keyContinue reading “Rosy Overdrive Label Watch 2023”\n\nNew Playlist: October 2023\n\nHappy Halloween to all you ghouls, zombies, ghosts and whatnot. I’d say that this is a “spooky” edition of the monthly round-up or something, but really, this is just a normal one. It’s only scary if you’re afraid of good music.

Musically it’s on the harder-edge sideContinue reading “The Playlist Archives: November 2018 (Part 2 of 2)”\n\nThe Playlist Archives: November 2018 (Part 1 of 2)\n\nOne of the reasons I initially decided to put medium-effort into making this blog—other than gentle suggestions by acquaintances that this would be more productive than just talking their ears off whenever I had something to say—was to go through, share, and review all these old playlists I’ve been making the past half-decade. These playlistsContinue reading “The Playlist Archives: November 2018 (Part 1 of 2)”\n\nMy 100 Favorite Albums from 2020 (Part 1 of 4)\n\nCongrats on randomly stumbling onto this list. All of these albums are worth a listen, but I’ve done you the courtesy of giving you a CliffsNotes version of all of them if you wanna be choosey. I will also note that I got a little better at doing this as I made it further along,Continue reading “My 100 Favorite Albums from 2020 (Part 1 of 4)”"
