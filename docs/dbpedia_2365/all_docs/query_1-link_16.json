The Benton County Historical Society’s mission to\n\npreserve our local history and culture will make it a gem of our community, and I am proud to\n\nbe a part of it.\n\nCareer Profile:\n\nI retired from Oregon State University on July 1, 2020 after having worked as an archivist there for nearly 30 year – assistant university archivist (1991-1996); university archivist (1996-2011); and director of the Special Collections and Archives Research Center (2011-2020). Prior to OSU, I was the photographs archivist at the University of Texas at Austin’s Barker Texas History Center (now the Briscoe Center for American History) from 1984 through 1990.\n\nAs part of my university archivist position, I also served as the consortium director for the Northwest Digital Archives (now Archives West, a program of the Orbis-Cascade Alliance) from 2002-2007. More recently I was part of the OSU150 team that developed the major 150th anniversary exhibit at the Oregon Historical Society. I am also the author of A School for the People: A Photographic History of Oregon State University, published in 2015 by the OSU Press and available at the Corvallis Museum store!\n\nI currently have a courtesy faculty appointment with the OSU Libraries and Press and work on special projects, typically involving some aspect of university history and/or the history of local communities of color.\n\nCommunity/Professional Affiliations:\n\nMember of the Benton County Historical Society since 1992\n\nBenton County Historic Resources Commission, 1996-2021 (chair, 2004-2021)\n\nOregon Century Farm & Ranch Program Management Committee, 2005-present\n\nOregon Historical Society, member, 1992-present\n\nOregon Encyclopedia Editorial Board, 2006-present\n\nOregon Heritage Commission, advisory member representing the Oregon Higher Education\n\nCoordinating Commission, October 2018-present\n\nAmerican Association of State and Local History, member, 2021-present\n\nNorthwest Archivists, member, 1991-present\n\nSociety of American Archivists, member, 1983-present\n\nAcademy of Certified Archivists, member, 1989-present\n\nWhy did you join the BCHS board?\n\n“I have been a member of BCHS for nearly 30 years and have witnessed it develop into one of the most robust and highly regarded local historical societies in Oregon. We are a vital community asset. I am at a point in my life where I can help the Society continue to develop and be even more impactful.”\n\nCareer Profile:\n\nAs an artist I began creating artwork by programming a mainframe\n\ncomputer in Fortran, using mathematical equations to create drawings\n\nand then textiles. These coded algorithmic drawings and textiles are in\n\ncollections at the Whitney Museum of American Art in NYC, The Art\n\nInstitute of Chicago and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. My\n\nartwork is exhibited internationally and is represented by RCM Galerie\n\nin Paris. Currently, I am creating hand-woven digital Jacquard textiles.\n\nRecently my artwork was exhibited in a one-person show at the\n\nSchneider Museum of Art in Ashland, and in a group exhibit at the RCM\n\nGalerie in Paris, France. I have also exhibited in the Art Gallery at the\n\nBenton County Historical Museum in Philomath.\n\nI am Professor Emeritus at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIn Corvallis I am the Director and Curator of the Truckenbrod Gallery,\n\ncreating exhibition opportunities for professional artists.\n\nwww.joantruckenbrod.com\n\nCommunity/Professional Affiliations:\n\nMy community and professional affiliations include the OSU Art/Science\n\nSteering Committee, and the Corvallis Artwalk Committee. I am\n\nDirector and Curator of the Truckenbrod Gallery. Previously I served on\n\nthe Board of COPI, Corvallis OSU Piano International, and the Arts\n\nAdvisory Board at OSU, which included sponsoring an Art and Science\n\nScholarship. I was also a member of the Corvallis Downtown Advisory\n\nBoard until Covid closed meetings. I am a member of a group of seven\n\nprofessional artists that meet in individual artists’ studios to discuss\n\nartworks. These artists are currently exhibiting at Truckenbrod Gallery.\n\nWhy did you join the BCHS board?\n\n“I am serving as a Trustee because the Museum embodies the pride and\n\nspirit of the community. It is the site of community identity; historically,\n\ntoday, and in the future. The pioneering history of Benton County\n\ncreates an identity that strengthens community ties, particularly among\n\nyoung people. Exhibits are innovative and unique, bringing new\n\nperspectives and understanding to visitors, including a broad range of\n\nstudents. This innovation is mirrored in the design of the Corvallis\n\nmuseum building.\n\nI am committed to supporting the Museum’s outreach to our diverse\n\ncommunity and educational groups. I am interested in the Museum\n\nconnecting with people and groups who are not familiar with the range\n\nof exhibits and collections and exploring opportunities for them to visit\n\nthe museum. The Museum presents an inspiring combination of the\n\nArts in Benton County with the diverse dimensions of our history.”\n\nCareer Profile: I am a retired environmental attorney. I worked for the Illinois Attorney General’s office in Chicago prior to moving to the Seattle area in about 1986. After working for three years in the Seattle Office of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, I spent the rest of my career with the Civil Division of the King County, WA Prosecutor’s Office. I served as supervising attorney of the Natural Resources Section for about ten years until I retired in 2017. My wife, Diana, is also a retired attorney, and since she is originally from Corvallis and is part owner of timber property located near Philomath that has been in her family for over 100 years, moving to Corvallis upon retiring was an easy decision.\n\nCommunity/Professional Affiliations: I am a member of the First United Methodist Church of Corvallis. I am a member of the board of the Marys River Watershed Council and currently serve as chair. My wife Diana is a member of the Benton County Small Woodlands Owners Association, and I regularly attend that organization’s meetings and timberland tours.\n\nWhy did you join the BCHS board? Three of the reasons that I joined are the following:\n\n(1) Ron Marek asked that I consider applying.\n\n(2) I have long been interested in, and perhaps fascinated by the history of our nation and its peoples.\n\n(3) I believe local historical societies and museums have a vital role to play in the betterment of our communities."
