        "text": "My field is the theory and practice of fine art painting as re-born via digital printmaking and video. For still pictures, I combine photography with computer graphic geometry and in the time-based realm, I combine live-action digital video with animated 3D computer graphics. Taking my cue from Picasso and Braque’s Cubism, I have sought to use computer graphics to explore a contemporary graphical metaphor for the structure of space. A metaphor which exemplifies a perceptualand energetic field or network which connectively articulates the interstitial space between figure and ground.\n\nThe primary graphical device for this purpose has been my adoption of the omni-triangulated isotropic vector matrix, as sourced from R. Buckminster Fuller’s Synergetic geometry. The use of this particular geometrical structure, as well as other all-space-filling polyhedral networks, produce an acute graphical tension when juxtaposed with photo or video imagery. Influenced by my readings of Fritjof Capra’s book, The Tao of Physics and related texts I was prompted to call my graphical metaphor the void-matrix.\n\nI was introduced to computer graphics in 1980 by Gene Youngblood, who wrote a book called, Expanded Cinema. I was attending Art Center College of Design, and he was teaching a lecture-survey class there on the latest developments in electronic and digital imaging. He showed work by Ed Emschwiller, Woody and Steina Vysulka as well as various early CG experiments from the New York Institute of Technology. The NYIT experiments took several forms, from early light-pen paint systems to 3D solid modeling and rendering. James Blinn also came to the school and lectured on the new rendering algorithms that he was writing at JPL. He also spoke of his dialogue and collaboration with artist David Em. At the time, I was heavily involved in the geometric work of M.C. Escher so the connection between his kind of content and computer graphics was clear and profound. I had seen the future, and that is where I wanted to go. Not having a clue as to where to get access and still quite involved with traditional media, I carried on with oil painting and graphite drawing for another 3 or 4 years. However I gradually became a full on digital artist over the span of years 1983–85.\n\nIn 1980–81, when I was first introduced to computer graphics, I was amazed by 3D modeling, animation, paint systems and image processing. Along with all this, early experiments in digital editing, I found to be quite startling. I knew instinctively that that would be an important part future filmmaking. Later on, concepts and practices in VR and the progression of interactive multi-media upped the ante. The advent and proliferation of the world wide web was something that was a pleasant surprise to me and I feel that it gradually created a natural climate for the reception for computer or digital art by the art world as well as the general public.\n\nI haven’t thought about the progress so much, I’ve accepted it as it comes. But, I suppose like most people in the field I look forward to more ergonomic and natural interfaces. I suspect the areas of nanotechnology, augmented reality, wearable and ubiquitous computing hold promise. Further developments in Holography, are always in the back of my mind. Warm and friendly, AI systems that house accessible ancestral wisdom and enable dialogues with non-living persons, would be nice. Perhaps computer graphics will someday help us communicate with extraterrestrials or open up channels to what is now considered the paranormal."
