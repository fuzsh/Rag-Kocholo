Rojek now you've got all of your be- longings safely tucked away in your new room, you've registered and met your residence assistants, and finally, er all of that, you have those keys in ur hand. This is just the beginning Freshmen Orientation The Orientation Team, affection- ;ly referred to as the O-Team, have irked all summer to schedule an ay of events from meetings to per- rmers to volunteer projects. These :ople clad in orange shirts not only lp you move into your new home t also provide entertainment to pre- nt homesickness. After receiving all of the necessary perwork that you'll need for the mester and talking to the financial d representatives on Thursday, Au- ust 24, all freshmen gather outside eber Chapel for the Opening Con- location and Presentation of the Class 11999. This marks the official open- g of the 138th academic year at usquehanna University. It is here that students march in a ocession with professors lining each de up the steps into the chapel. The ■reinony includes speeches by the nivcrsity's administrators. Look for jch dignitaries on the stage as Dr. eil Potter, marshal; Dr. Joel Cunningham, University president; and Mr. Brett Thompson, S.G.A. president. After the individual hall meetings, the O-Team will hold Playfair. It is a fun way to meet the people with whom you will live with, play with, gossip with.and party with for the better part of four years. Comfortable clothing and shoes are a must Stop into Charlie'sPub in thelower level of the Deger stein Campus Cen- ter after Playfair for some sodas, pizza or just for some conversation with new-found friends. The movie \"Stargate\" will be shown. Charlie's will be open from 10 p.m. to mid- night. Friday will be the start of your college academic career. Students and their advisors will meet to dis- cuss students questions in a group meeting. Students are encouraged to make an individual appointment to discuss their goals and any problems they are having in adjusting to college life. There are academic department meetings and also a special orienta- tion for honors students. After sitting through all of those meetings and information sessions, the O-Team will once again provided relief with their \"We Present...\" This event will be in the Degenstein The- ater from 8 - 9 p.m. and will showcase the amateur talent of the residence life Ereshmen: Easy does it \"<3oing to College.\" These three » -rds will bring both excitement :i ! anxiety to incoming college in ihmenand their parents. While many have been prepar- ing for years to take this step, it is still a major change in one's life. Most students will be living away from home for the fi rst time and encountering new experiences, both academically and socially. Parents have to cope with letting their children grow independently ilirough these new experiences. Susquehanna University Direc- tor of Counseling and Associate Dean for Personal Development Dr. Diane Bonner knows that ad- justing;: to campus life can be a traumatic time for both students and parents. She has come up with several tips which can help ease this transition: L. Realize that college Is not tbe same as high school. Never be- fore have you been associated with as many students- who are as bright and motivated as yourself. Be- cause of this, students who were academic leaders in high school sometimes find themselves in the middleof the pack in college. Simi- larly, students who struggled in high school may continue to struggle, although they could also discover new areas of study in which they are both interested and capable. Regardless of your situa- tion, expect to learn to do the best you can without comparing your- self to classmates. Ultimately, the best predictor of academic success is personal motivation. 2. Realize that college is a major life transition. Most freshmen feel nervous, excited and home- sick about the new college experi- ence, Ifyou feel this way, realize this is normal and talk about these feelings with other freshmen. If these feelings become overwhelm- ing and distract you from your school work, use campus counsel* tog services or other campus sup- port services. These campus pro- fessionals will understand andarc there to help. 3. Be sure to balance your schedule. Many freshmen make the mistake of spending all their out of class time studying, or playing. You need to do both. Purchase a daily planner and write in all of your daily responsibili- ties, including classes, work, meetings and study time. Then, be sure to schedule personal fun time too. If you study all the time, you'll burn out. If you play all the time, you'l fail out. 4. Beware of the myth that the only \"thing to do\" on the week* end is go to a party and drink beer. Recent studies indicate that the use of alcohol is inversely^ related to gladelichlevemenir The more college students drink, the lower their grades. Use of alco- hol also increases the risk of vio- lence, date rape, depression and dropping out of college. Despite state laws and campus regula- tions, college freshmen drink al- cohol. If you are tempted into drinking, go to parties with friends and plan to watch out for one another, and leave the party to- gether at the end of the noght. Also, don't drink to become in- toxicated. 5. Keep an open mind. College will present you with opportuni- ties to meet people from many dif fereot backgrounds, challenge your beliefs, explore new sub- jects areas, and become involved in many varied activities. You should seize this opportunity to learn more about the world around you.aswellasyourself. You will learn much more in college than what is taught in the classroom, or in your texts.

The Game Room in the lower level of the campus center will be open from 9 p.m. until midnight for Free Games Night until all of the quarters are gone.

Cleaning up the playgrounds in Selinsgrove for the borough govern- ment is also planned. Students should check their registration packets for their assignments. Students involved with fall sports will be exempt from the Freshman Community Service project due to practice i»nflicts.

Don't park inside of Selinsgrove Hall. The guidelines for puking on the Susquehanna University campus for >11 students for the upcoming year were issued by Ri A Woods, director of the department of public safety. Students who have i car on campus or commute to campus, must register their car with Public Safety. There is a $5 registration fee. Students register while in line for their ID pictures or during registration for classes. After this period of time, students may register their cars in the Student Life office in the upper level of the campus center. If your car is not registered, mere will be a $50 violation fee. Parking is permitted all night in the Phi Mu Delta/West, Aikens, Smith, Sassafras Housing (over the railroad tracks) and North (Mini) parking lots. From 2 am. to 6 a.m., parking is prohibited in the campus center parking lot. Violations of the above rules are subject to a minimum $25 fine. Enforcement of these guidelines will begin on Monday, August 28, the first day of classes. Stricter enforcement of cars that are parked on the roadway with fo ir way flashers on will also take effect this year There are new crosswalks between Aikens and West for extra pedestrian safety. Woods also has some tips for personal safety and the safety of your belongings while at Susquehanna. \"The same general rules apply such as locking your valuables and your room and securing your vehicle, if you brought one,\" Woods said. If you notice any suspicious activity, you can report it to the Department of Public Safety at X4428. The Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity will also offer its \"Walk Safe\" program again this year. If you need an escort home from die library, another dorm or even a party, you can call X2222 for help. Woods also pointed out that the legal drinking age is 21 on campus and a violation of that law will result in the loss of your driving license and a fine of a minimum of $350. Anyone who is 21 years of age or older and supplies alcohol to minors will receive a minimum fine of $ 1 ,000. Woods would like to remind everyone in me Crusader community that there are no authorized parlies on campus for this upcoming weekend and any parties that do occur will be in violation of the law. He added that subsequent actions will occur if such unauthorized parties are discovered. Page 2 The Crusader Thursday, August 24, 1995 , Opinion The Crusader Student newspaper of Susquehanna University Stacey Bahn, Editor in Chief Allen Arndt, Managing Editor EDITORIAL \"Where in the world am I going to put all this stuff?\" This was the question I tried desperately to answer as I scanned my tiny dorm room upon my arrival at Susquehanna. It was the first day of Freshman Orientation and I had piles of bags, boxes, suitcases and crates to unpack. The swarm of people in orange t-shirts were no longer around to help. My parents had left, leaving me with the task of setting up my first \"home-away-from-home.\" Yes, I had read the room dimensions listed in my Orientation package, but failed to realize exactly how small they really were. At least I didn't have the misfortune of being one of the poor souls trapped in a triple. \"Don't worry,\" the pamphlet read, \"the triples are slightly larger in size.\" Anyone check that with a ruler? For many students, Freshman Orientation was also their introduction to public bathrooms. With this came the fear of creating indiscreet noises and catching some strange fungus from the showers (it's amazing how hard it is to find flip flops in Selinsgrove in the fall). It was the first meeting with windows with built in blinds leaving you with the choice of privacy or roasting during August and September. There were challenges such as finding sheets to fit the extra long twin beds or enough electrical outlets for both roommates. Strange purple blotches covered my walls and the ceiling light barely lit up the room. Roommates found that they had completely different tastes in colors and opinions as to arrange the jigsaw puzzle of furniture. I remember sitting in the hallway until early in the morning on the first night of Orientation discussing the mystique of the Selinsgrove Raceway and the \"hoopies.\" It didn't take long to find out the phone numbers of all of the restaurants that delivered. Nor did it take long to accumulate dozens of Susquehanna novelty t-shirts sold door to door. I recall a lot about my first year of dormitory life as a Crusader. There were the nights my fellow dorm residents and I stood out in the rain in our pajamas after the blue strobe light fire drills had gone off. I remember my weekly scavenger hunt for quarters to do my laundry after the game room had closed. I found that I had left all peace and quiet at home. I especially remember our introduction to the social life on campus: long lines in front of fraternity houses, hide-and-go-seek with the R.A. on duty, and, of course, the eerie silence that gripped the cafeteria on post-party mornings. Most importantly, I remember how lonely and confused I felt. After the first week of classes, I had so much homework to do that I thought I'd never have any free time again. This work, coupled with Orientation activities, left me spinning in circles. Unlike high school, I didn't have my old friends to share the experiences with me. My parents' advice and comfort suddenly became expensive with the long distance calling rates. I remember the pressure of living with someone else for the first time and trying to make new friends. The first night was the hardest-crying myself to sleep on a hard bed and feeling completely homesick. So how have I adjusted? Well, for one thing, it's amazing how college changes your perspective. Old habits of hygiene disappear when you're faced with a shower or an extra hour of sleep. Bags of groceries suddenly become the best gift your parents could send. You learn to master the talent of writing pathetic letters with subtle hints for money to your parents. You will soon learn that you don't have the time to worry about impressing anyone else but yourself. You'll quickly find lots of other classmates going through the same situation as yourself. In many cases, these new college friends will eventually mean more to you than your oldest friends at home. As I enter my third year at Susquehanna, Freshman Orientation seems strangely far away. You'll hear the same tales and lectures as I did from the upperclassmen and faculty. Listen to these stories, but do so with an open mind. My best advice? Sit back, buckle your orange and maroon seatbelt and prepare for the ride of your life.

Susquehanna University President Joel Cunningham By Jeanine Leah Capsouras Staff Writer \"My job is about variations, there has not been one 'standard* day ovrer the years,\" Susquehanna University P/resident Joel Cunningham said. A typical day may include meetings with various groups, both on or off campus. Cunningham is Chair of the Exiecuti ve Staff of the University, which includes; the deans and vice presidents. The Executive Staff also includes the University Council 1 , composed of faculty and administration whio plan budgets for the future years. Cunningham deals with individual issues such as meeting with faculty lmembers who have expressed concerns, or asked for sugges- Wanted: tions or direction. Many days are spent on the telephone with members of the Board of Di- rectors, the Planning Priorities Committee, or with students or parents talking about various issues of concern. He devotes a lot of time to reading and writing letters, proposals and reports. Cunningham also spends many days on the road, mainly on the Uruversiry'sbehalf.speak- ing to alumni, foundations and corporate lead- ers who are interested in supporting projects or donating gifts. \"One of the biggest jobs of a university president is to share with others the story of the university,\" Cunningham said. Cunningham holds office hours on a monthly basis, during which students may come and talk about issues that concern them . \"I'd like to get to know and become more involved with individual students,\" he said. \"I do enjoy the opportunities I have to be with students. I only wish I had more time to do that. I also try to find ways to support the outstanding work of the faculty, staff, cleri- cal, housekeeping and physical plant work- ers.\" One such opportunity to interact with stu- dents is through the Presidential Fellows Group, composed of approximately 20 stu-l dents from diverse opinions, on interests,! majors and hometowns. The group reads I books, takes trips, holds spaghetti dinners and! during the holiday season, decorates the tree] at Pine Lawn (the president's home). \"IlitebeiagabletomakeacQV , .urib , i , io?.te| the success of the place, serving it in various! ways both on and off campus,\" Cunningham I said. \"I feel that I am doing something very j important, very valuable in educating capable students. It's one of the most important things to be done in this society. I often think of myself as a teacher on leave from teaching. At one point, I hope to go back to full time teaching.\" Cunningham has taught at least one math course each year during his term as president. For Cunningham and his wife Trudy, much of their life is related to the University. They entertain visiting Fellows, guests and friends of the University at their home. Often, vaca- tions are spent visiting prominent alumni and contributors. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Chattanooga in Tennessee, and his graduate degree in mathematics from the University of Oregon. Cunningham then taught and conducted research at the Univer- sity of Kentucky. He held the position of dean and Assistant to the President at the Univer- sity of Tennessee at Chattanooga. He came to Susquehanna 15 years ago as academic vice president. Cunningham was named president 10 years ago. \"Most university presidents are not taught to be presidents of universities, they learn it through working with others,\" Cunningham said. \"It really is a lot of fun. ..the University is an exciting place. I can't imagine doing anything more satisfying.\" Fresh talent for The Crusader Wanted: Talented creative imdividuals who have experience in writing, edi iting, photogra- phy, art, computer layout, ma nagement, etc. These are just of a few of th e skills used by the staff of Susquehanna University's student newspaper The Crusader.

Nathalie Merchant \"A Chorus Line\" By Stacey E. Bahn Editor in Chief Has your social life come to a deadend? The Susquehanna stage is alive with talent featuring the Artist Series and Student Activi- ties Committee events, and stu- dent productions. Several organizations at Susquehanna University work to- gether to bring members of the Crusader community a variety of arts and entertainment. These events, for the most part, are brought to the students at no cost. The Artist Series is funded by the University, the Student Gov- ernment Association, ticket sales and outside contributions. This series, run by Dr. Henry Diers, dean of fine arts and communica- tion, offers a range of events from performers such as Loretta Swit to ballets. Tickets for these events are available at the box office lo- cated in Weber Chapel atno charge to S.U. students. According to Diers, the Artist Series has been around for at least thirty or forty years. Diers said that a lot of \"very famous people\" have been attracted to the Susquehanna stage, including majorsymphonies and great opera companies. This year, Diers has selected many multi-cultural performances in- cluding the \"Tap Dance Kid\" and Chinese dancers. The S.A.C. also sponsors nu- merous events from hypnotists to famous comedians. Some perform- ers the S.A.C. brought to Susquehanna last year include: Nathalie Merchant, Kevin Nealon (\"Saturday Night Live\") and Dave Binder. S.A.C, whose president is junior Meg Johnson, also sponsors activities such as current movies on the field hockey field or in Charlie's Pub located in the lower level of the campus center. Students are also invited to join any of the many student produc- tions. Last year's plays and musi- cals included: \"Caucasian Chalk Circle,\" \"A Chorus Line,\" and \"You Can't Take it With You.\" Diers and Larry Augustine, asso- ciate professor and head of com- munications, will be holding audi- tions for their two fall productions around the first week of classes. Students are invited to audition or work backstage for the produc- tions regardless if they have expe- rience or not. \"There were 2 1 freshmen on the stage in the first shows in the fall last year,\" Diers said. 'The shows are wonderful opportunities for students to be on stage or to work backstage, and to participate.\" Diers also said that there are a few positions open in the box of- fice for work study students. Any- one interested should contact Jan Persing at X4268.

The men's soccer season ended on Wednesday, Nov. 2 with a solid vic- tory over Beaver College. This vic- tory brought the team's overall record to 8-8 for a .500 season. \"It's a young team, we improved a lot over the course of the season, and in the last seven games, the younger guys really helped contribute,\" gradu- ate Bill Lekas said. In the last seven games, there were four MAC conference games and three were victories. The team also outscored their opponents 18-9 dur- ing this streak. For the football team, junior Tyrone Croom's nine yard touchdown run not only gave the Crusaders a 19-13 victory over the Eagles of Juniata College last year, but it assured them their ninth straight winning season. Many Crusaders also received MAC football honors on both the defensive and offensive side of the ball. The first team All MAC selec- tions from the Crusader defense in- cluded graduate outside linebacker and former captain Mike DiGrigoli, graduate inside linebacker Tim Boyne, graduate Pre-Season All-Amcrican cornerback Mike Gerhart and gradu- ate defensive tackle Ray Minarovic.

The Crusader wrestling squad put on a fabulous performance at the MAC Championships last year. Susquehanna placed fourth, equalling their highest finish ever in MAC his- tory. The squad advanced five wresders to the semi-final round. Junior co- captain Mike Hardy at 1 26 pounds led the team in capturing the MAC title. Hardy pushed his record to 24-2 over- all and remained undefeated against Division HI competition at 22-0. The Susquehanna's women's track and field team won its first ever MAC indoor meet at Lebanon Valley Col- lege last year. The women's team scored 1 18 points, finishing well ahead of second place Widener with 90 points. \"The key to victory was overall team balance and earning points in all fourteen events,\" head coach Dick Hess said. \"While we didn't have the numbers a couple other teams had, the event balance and individual ath- lete determination made the differ- ence.\" Hess was also awarded with the indoor track and field coach of the year award. On the weekend of Feb. 17-19, the Susquehanna men's and women's swim teams ended their seasons with impressive performances at the MAC Swimming Championships held at Widener University. The men's 500 freestyle race saw senior captain Mike Mauriello place third and break his second school record of the weekend in a time of 5:06.13. Female co-captain senior Karen Danskin finished third in the 200 backstroke race for the Crusad- ers.

Also a 1993 Football Dis- trict II Academic All-American and four-time member of the MAC All- Academic Team. Ott received many other awards for his academic, base- ball and football skills including an MAC Commonwealth League First Team All-Star nod at second base. Junior outfielder/pitcher Ginger Good of the Softball team also earned Academic All-Academic honors. Good played in 19 of her team's 28 games last season, batting a team best .475 with two doubles, a triple, eight RBIs and six runs scored. Will the Flaming Bananas set a new record in the Skin-the- Snake relay? Will the team of Phi Sigma Kappa and Kappa Delta capture all of the records? Will anvone get run over by the Earthball? These are just a few of the teams and events of Susquehanna University's annual Fall Olympics. This year's Olympics mark the sixth year of the event and will kick off at 1 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 2. The Fall Olympics are part of the Student Activities Committee's Fall Frenzy Weekend. The Olympics were originally designed as an event for fresh- men only, but were opened to upperclajsmen after they expressed interest in the games. Over 150 students participated in last year's Fall Olympics. The nine events of the Fall Olympics are: Earthball Relay, Shoe Relay, Wheelbarrow Relay, Cageball Relay, Bat Relay, Trolley Relay, Skin-the-Snake, Balloon Relay and the Septathalon. The Septathalon is comprised of several elements including leap frogging and a crab walk. The team of the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity and the Kappa Delta Sorority hold four of the nine records in the Wheelbarrow Relay (1994, 0:28. 10), the Bat Relay (1992, 4:35.67), the Balloon Relay (1992, 1:40.00) and the Septathalon (1994, 1:01.2). Best from the West holds the Earthball Relay record (1993, 2:53.70) and Last Minute holds the Shoe Relay record (1994, 1 :08.03). In the Cageball Relay, the Smithereens hold the record (1994, 0:08.28) and in the Trolley Relay, the Hassinger Steamin' Weenies have the top spot (1992, 1:23.00). The Flaming Bananas set the record for the Skin-the-Snake relay in 1993 with a time of 0:13.91. Prizes will be given to the top five teams overall. The first prize team will win Champion first place t-shirts, steak dinners, 5 pizzas, Fall Olympic cups and soft drink coupons. All five winning teams will win t-shirts. Staff members who are helping out will be sporting special Fall Olympic referee t-shirts. All teams are coed and my register between ten and twenty members. Individual events require anywhere from five to ten team members. Anyone interested in forming a team should contact Residence Life for team roster forms, rules and other pertinent information. p Center offers outdoor rentals If you're tired of being trapped inside of a classroom all day, the Outdoor Recreation Center has the solution to all of your problems.

For those leaving the comforts of home to live on or near cam- pus, coexisting peacefully with a roommate may be the most difficult test of all. Cramped quarters and conflicting living habits can give rise to a wealth of problems. According to college-housing experts, being prepared for several common conflicts can pave the way to smoother roommate relationships. \"There are a few roommate problems we see almost every day,\" says Jeremy Chin, resident assistant for dormitories at California State University, Long Beach. \"There's no fool- proof way to avoid them completely, but by being open-minded, communicating and lay- ing down some ground rules during the begin- ning of the year, students can avoid many arguments.\" Chin says the most common disputes are over personal space and belongings. \"When one roommate has friends who continuously over- stay their welcome, it can be very annoying,\" explains Chin. \"It's important to let a room- mate with constant visitors know early on that you're not comfortable with the situation.\" Chin says that borrowing a roommate's food is another common source of tension. \"We advise students to respect each other's property,\" says Chin. \"If you're tempted to eat your roommate's food, don't make it a regular practice and replace it as soon as you can.\" The phone can be another potential source of friction, with oae missed message meaning the end of a harmonious roommate relationship. Adam Crane, a graduate student at the Illinois College of Professional Psychology, suggests using an answering machine to aid a forgetful roommate. \"Unlike roommates, an answering machine won't lose or forget to relay messages,\" says Crane, who has lived with roommates in dormi- tories, a fraternity house and numerous apart- ments. \"It's a simple and inexpensive way to ensure you'll never miss a call.\" PhoneMate offers several answering-machinc models ideally suited to college lifestyles. \"PhoneMate 's Model 8200 is perfect for taking messages while students are in class,\" says Jim Oblak, PhoneMate 's vice president of market- ing. \"The machine also allows roommates to leave personal messages for each other by simp ly pressing the memo-record button — so mes- sages won't get misplaced under a rarely read textbook.\" The 8200 has a built-in speakerphone, so roommates can talk to a third person to discuss class notes. When studying at the library, stud- ents can use the 8200 's remote-message func- tion to retrieve messages. For students who prefer to study in the com- fort of their own room, loud music can make waves between roommates. \"I need total silence while studying, but some of my roommates liked to study while listening to musk,\" says Crane. \"Sometimes you have to compromise. The easiest solution is to invest in a good set of headphones.\" While it may be impossible to always get along, it helps to remember that living with a college roommate is a learning experience in and of itself.

A leather trian- gle patch at the base of the shoulder straps signifies the Seamlock™ construction, which is the strongest shoulder-strap reinforcement in the industry,\" says Furdek, All of the company's backpacks are made in the United States with a lifetime guaran- tee.

Today, campus life just isn't complete without a computer, an answering machine, la microwave oven and popcorn. And ipopcorn? Snacking is a central part of college life, land popcorn is among the most popular of ■snacks. Because it's easy to make and tastes ■great, it's often the first thing students reach [for during a study break, after a big exam or I when they are just \"hanging out.\" Popcorn is good brain food too — gram [for gram, it's got more protein, phosphorus, I iron and fiber than other favorite student I snacks, like potato chips or pretzels. And, as [long as it's not drenched in butter or oils, Ipopcorn can be a low-fat snack. A cup of ■plain popped popcorn has virtually no fat and only 33 calories; a cup popped with oil has 40 calories and 2 grams of fat, both well [under the ISO calories and 9 grams of fat of [one cup (or one small bag) of potato chips. Microwaveable popcorn bags are an | option, but they are expensive. More impor- Itantly, even the \"light\" versions are loaded I with fats and oils. Help your student eat right and avoid those [extra pounds, known as the dreaded \"Fresh- |man Fifteen,\" by packing the Presto* PowerPop™ microwave multi-popper in with the essentials. It's a perfect solution for healthy snacking, because it makes great tasting popcorn with or without oil. Snacking at college can be healthy with the Prrslot PowerPop\" 1 microwave multi-popper. Students love popcorn, and this microwave popper lets them easily make up to 3 quarts of great tasting popcorn with or without oil Those who like to experiment with new flavor combinations can add seasonings, like Italian herbs or Cajun spices, directly to the oil before popping. For a more hearty snack, they can top freshly popped popcorn with a shake of low-fat Parmesan cheese or mix it with a handful of nuts and raisins. The PowerPop works in most micro- waves, even the compact models found in dorm rooms. It's patented concentrators focus the microwave energy to pop almost every kernel — up to 3 quarts of light, fluffy popcorn in as little as 21/2 minutes. Another plus for busy students is easy cleaning — simply wipe the base and rinse the bowl and lid. The PowerPop is available at leading dis- count and department stores. Priced under $25, it is an ideal back-to-school gift that doesn't stretch anyone's budget.

But e class of 1999, which is composed of 449 eshmen, 32 transfer students, and eight ex- hange students, is by far one of the most nique Susquehanna has escorted through its ir ange and maroon halls in many years. The personalities and characteristics range from A to Z, or perhaps more appropriately Ablamsky to Zettlemoyer. According to Pamela White, dean of aca- demic affairs, this incoming class is the third largest in Susquehanna history, while the pool from which the students were selected was the second largest ever. That fact alone indicates that interest in Susquehanna has skyrocketed among high school students in previous years. With the increased interest in S usquehanna, the university has had the opportunity to grow more selective in its administration process, and has definitely seized that opportunity to choose the most interesting of students to comprise its class of '99. The talents of the incoming students range from politics to camping to forensics. The diverse pool features students from nineteen different states, ranging from Utah to Florida, and eight different countries, reaching as far is Japan. Students hail from nearly every cultural and social background. Academicallyspeaking, the incoming class of '99 is the strongest Susquehanna Uni- versity has seen in over twenty years, White also said. Eighteen students have the dis- tinction of being either the valedictorian or salutatorian of their respective high schools. Many students carry credentials of at least an 1 100 SAT score and an impressive 3.5 grade point average. The new Susquehanna students are not only intelligent, but also well-rounded. Thirty one percent participated in student government at the high school level, whereas approximately half of the class engaged in varsity sports. Nearly fifty percent of the class also participated in voluteer work of some kind. White said the variety of the incoming class not only is apparent in the activities of its members, but also their respective choices of major. All departments are represented as majors, for arriving students, while the most popular fields chosen were biology, business administration, communications, elementary education, environmental sci- ence, music, and psychology. Nearly forty students have a graduate relative of Susquehanna, evidence of the growing tradition the university has instilled in its students. Are the new students ready for the rigors of Susquehanna University? Perhapsabet- ter question would be: Is Susquehanna University ready for its new, innovative students? New housing features innovative technology By Jennifer Mariano Staff Writer If you have not seen the new townhouses and apartment on the south end of campus, you should try to make it a point to walk beyond the train tracks behind Aikcns and visit Shobert, Isaacs and Roberts. If you do plan on visiting, you should be aware that the doors are locked all the time. In order to get into Shobert, for example, one must know the extension of whom they are visiting, dial that number on the keypad out- side the door and wait for the person to answer his or her phone and then open the door. Resident and sophomore Cherie Ainslcy said, \"I feel safe here. The complex is very nice and also it is much larger than I expected it to be. I love living here. I love the suite set- up.\" So how did Susquehanna fund such a large project? Last May, an announcement was made that a group of anonymous donors had made a large gift that would fully fund the new $3.2 million complex that would accomodate 87 students. You may also be wondering where the names of the buildings came from. The build- ings were named after three husband and wife pairs that have made a lasting impact on Susquehanna's campus. The buildings were not named after the donors as they still remain anonymous. Isaacs was named after Lawrence M. and Louise Kreggs Issacs of Selinsgrove who have both assisted on campus for many years. Lawrence was vice chair of the the University 's Board of Directors and Louise acted as president of S.U.'s Women's Auxiliary for four years. She is also a patron of Sigma Alpha Iota, the women's music fraternity on campus. Still active among her class, she continues to assist in coordinating alumnus events on campus. The Issacs are still a active supporter of the arts on the Susquehanna campus. Roberts was named after Ruth M. Roberts and the late William 0. Robertsof Selinsgrove who were both special friends to the S.U. community. William was also a member of S.U.'sclass of 1929. The apartment complex was named after Eric and Marjorie Shobert of St. Mary's, both of whom have been long supporters of events on S.U.'s campus. Dr. Shobert wasamemberofS.U.'sClassof 1935 and was chair of the University's Board of Directors from 1978-1986. Marjorie has been a leader and supporter for S.U. for over fifty years. Senior Jason Milner, Residence Assistant at Shobert, said, \"It is a different living envi- ronment. I think it is a good opportunity for upperclassmen to get to know their own circle of friends better.\" Each townhouse accomodates sixteen stu- dents and the larger central building with apartment like suites, Shobert, accomodates 55 students. Junior Jason Carrier, a resident inShobert's suite for Study Buddy project members, said, \"I like it a lot. It is still coming along though because not everything is completed. We are excited about living here. The air condition- ing is very nice. I like the co-ed community atmosphere.\" Landscaping and minor revisions at this facility continue, adding beauty to the south- western end of campus.

On August 24 the Orientation Team greeted the class of 1999 and transfer students in bright orange shirts while quickly unloading the overflowing cars at Smith, Hassinger.North, and West dorms. Four hundred and ninety-three new students unloaded their pasts to start their futures at Susquehanna University, beginning with orientation, which lasted three days. The first event of orientation, \"The Opening convo- cation and Presentation of The Class of 1999,\" featured speeches given by staff and students ofcSusquehanna. The speeches focused on the theme of orientation which was \"The Keys to Our Future: Community, Friendships, Values, Learning and Service.\" The presi- dent of Susquehanna, Dr. Joel Cunningham, ended his spee:h by playing the cello. This ceremony noted the opering of the 138th academic school year and was followed by the \"President's Reception,\" for parents to mee with faculty and administration and to say goodbye to trisir new students. Tie first day of Orientation, was also filled with mee ings and activities. Students were placed in small discission groups in which they talked about what to exp c ct at Susquehanna and the plans for their commu- nity ^ejcvice work project scheduled for Saturday, Au- gus 27 at 1 p.m. This was followed by a barbeque near the ampus center. T tat evening students were invited to Play fair which was leld in the Evert Dining Hall. This event gave new stud ;nts the chance to meet their classmates. At the end of the event, freshmen formed two giant circles and walked around the cafeteria shaking one another's hand and intro- ducing themselves. \"Playfair was neat. I saw a lot of faces I'd see later on that week,\" said freshman Christine Hughes. Friday evening the Orientation Team provided comic relief by acting in \"We Present...,\" an amateur talent show which showcased a collection of skits which gave a comical perspective to freshmen life at S.U. Saturday, the third and final day of orientation, students were given the opportunity to attend pre-professional meet- ings in the morning and were required to attend their service project in the afternoon. This community service day is a nationally recognized program in its second year. Susquehanna freshmen and select upperclassmen joined faculty and the administrative staff in traveling from Selinsgrove to Sunbury to volunteer their time for various jobs. Some of the projects included cleaning fire engines, working on homes for \"Habitat for Humanity,\" mulching, and cleaning toys and windows. Orientation came to an end Saturday night as the Student Activities Committee presented Dave Binder in Evert Din- ing Hall. Binder took control of his audience with the hokey pokey and other songs. Freshman Kim Wilson said about orientation, \"I liked Dave Binder the best.\" Orientation provided the opportunity for students to become aquainted with their new home, Susquehanna Uni- versity. This semester marks the first time that stu- dents are liv- ing in the new housing on campus lo- cated across the railroad tracks Inside 2 Opinions Page Bulletins 3 University Calendar 3 Comics 4 Cafeteria Menu 4 News 5 Sports 6 Page 2 The Crusader Opinion Friday, September 8, 1995 The Crusader Student newspaper of Susquehanna University Stacey Bahn, Editor in Chief EDITORIAL In the past, The Crusader has been known to criticize the Susquehanna University Computer Center and its staff. Well, after the improvements and work that they undertook this summer, I can only find words of praise. No longer do I see frantic computer lab monitors dialing X4252 to report that for the tenth time in an evening that, \"email is down, or that, \"Bell crashed.\" What a relief it is to know that I can access the World Wide Web from my dorm room, and don't have to wait for an hour for a picture to come up. What a relief it is to be attending a university on the forefront of technology. For those of you unaware of the changes made to our network, allow me to explain. Neal Van Eck, director of computing services, described the old system as a bunch of people in a room yelling back and forth. Most of the time, he said, these people could be heard over each other to get a point across, but, sometimes, someone's message was confused or went unheard. Likewise, the amount of computers, users, etc., on the network, was too much for our old system to handle, resulting in the aforementioned problems. By calling in Microsoft consultants and upgrading to Windows for Workgroups, the computer center has quieted this fictitious \"meeting\" by splitting up the network and reducing the amount of system overload. The result is a much faster and dependable system with an enhanced electronic mail system and quicker access to areas such as Netscape. According to Van Eck, several student workers at the center helped the staff in setting up the new features, even putting in all nighters so that the network would only be down for a few hours. These students, whether paid or members of the Computer Consultants, continue to run around campus trying to solve students' computer problems. Some may argue with this editorial, stating that they're still waiting to gain access in their dorm room to the network, or that they are confused with all of the changes. As frustrating as it may seem to learn these new features, patience is a large part of entering the world of tomorrow. Anyone with any familiarity with businesses' computer systems, or, at least, the computer technology status of other colleges and universities, should know that Susquehanna has strikingly modem computer resources for a university our size. Email, the World Wide Web, even Windows for Workgroups are all examples of our competitive edge. Next time you print out a paper successfully or receive an email message, remember the work that was put in to make that happen. Van Eck, the Computer Center, its students workers, the Computer Consultants.. .we thank you for taking our hands and guiding us into the new age of computers.
