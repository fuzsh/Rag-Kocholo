        "text": "Hosted by Lou Lombardi aka \"Loudini\" & Kevin O'Connor\n\nTopic: The Ladies who Rock our World!\n\nWe all know the Wilson (Ann & Nancy) Sisters, Pat Benetar, Joan Jett, Janis Joplin, Grace Slick and of course Stevie Nicks but women have rocked this business at every level since the begining. As we started putting together next week's podcast with an all female line up of bands we started thinking about some of the amazing lesser know ladies who have rocked our world. Thanks to our friends who weighed in on Facebook, Tanisha Jackson, Bob Giacometti, Katie Simone, Brigitte Rios Purdy, Terry Filia-Popovich , B.c. Cliver , Tina Magnotti, Zosia West , Carla Sunseri Simmons , Bill Hathaway, Carla Bianco, Jeff Mazzei, Vince Ornato, Greg Richards. Birthday shout outs to J, Geils, Walter Becker (Steely Dan), Randy California (Spirit), Jon Brant (Cheap Trick), Kristy Wallace a.k.a. “Poison Ivy” (The Cramps), Kurt Cobain (Nirvana), Edwin Graham (The Darkness).\n\nLoudini artists Highway 4, Sit Kitty Sit, and Unwed Mothers . All this PLUS Pittsburgh Kevin!\n\n\"With an ear open to the great influences of the past, performed with the intensity of today, and a clear vision of the future, Rock & Roll is in good hands with Highway 4.\"\n\n~Tim Daugherty, Program Director, WONE-FM 97.5, Akron OH.\n\nShared the stage with: Blackberry Smoke\n\nThe Clarks\n\nGreat White\n\nTracii Guns' L.A. Guns\n\nBullet Boys\n\nHot Action Cop\n\nTruth & Salvage Co.\n\n\"We're losing the human element in today's music. Perfection is impossible, and no one really wants that anyway.\" ~Kelly Brown, VOX Highway 4\n\nHighway 4 is a 4 piece progressive riff-rock band that combine Zeppelin's hard hitting classic style, melodic Pearl Jam-like hooks, and vocal undertones of Myles/Nicks into and intense and engaging live show.\n\nThe \"Classic Rock\" sound has come full circle, this time, with more power and grit to back it up.\n\nThe award-winning rock band from the North East is quickly rising to popularity and resurfacing the rock music scene. Eclectic influences of the 1970's era forged with the muscle of the 21st Century have been the backbone to developing the unique & reminiscent new genre known as \"Progressive Riff-Rock.\"\n\nBand Members\n\nKelly Brown - Vocals\n\nJordan Gibson - Drums\n\nTylar Parker - Bass Guitar\n\nMike Angert - Lead Guitar\n\nAwards\n\n-2nd Place Overall at 105.9's The X Winter Rock Showcase 2011\n\n-1st Place Overall at The 2012 Next Big Thing Tour\n\n-2013 Grassy Award from 97.7 The Rock Station's Grass Roots Show for \"One Of These Days\"\n\nSan Francisco based Hard Piano Rock duo, Sit Kitty Sit, takes the stage. It’s a pretty girl in a cocktail dress and a handsome guy in black jeans. Simple. Unassuming. Armed only with piano and drums, this fiery team lets loose an expertly manipulated balance of blow-your-mind power rock and virtuosic intricacy that leaves audiences screaming.\n\n​\n\nIn May of 2010, Kat Downs (Good Natured Mortals/Sparrows Point/Saints of Ruin) and Mike Thompson (Big Nasty/Tokyo Raid/Cougar Kick) teamed up to experiment with the combination of classical piano and rock drumming. Typically described as “The Dresden Dolls mixed with King Crimson and Fiona Apple”, the music they create also reflects evidence of Zeppelin, Beethoven, Rush and Rachmaninoff. The combination of Kat Downs’ ornate hands and hair flying with Mike Thompson’s flawless percussive mastery makes this duo the consummate definition of a “dream-team”.\n\n“Digging for comparisons, you can find a little bit of everyone\n\nfrom Nick Cave to Randy Newman, Amanda Palmer to Metallica in their work.\n\nJust simply comparing this band, however, does Sit Kitty Sit a disservice.”\n\n– Nicholas Schneider, The Bay Bridged\n\n​\n\nFollowing their 2010 and 2012 releases, “The Push” and “Beautiful/Terrible” respectively, Sit Kitty Sit hit the road and never looked back. Touring almost non-stop since 2013, the duo has built up a cult-style following all across the United States and have become known for consistently thrilling audiences with their energetically intense live performances. No holds barred, this group produces addictive rock n’ roll – with only two people, and not one guitar in sight.\n\n“They seem to accomplish more with two people than most bands do with five.”\n\n– Veronica Kirk, Black on the Canvas\n\n​\n\n2014 unleashed the release of Sit Kitty Sit’s third studio album, “Everlasting Fire”. Based entirely on Dante’s “Inferno”, this storyline album showcases the extensive versatility of Downs and Thompson as a team. Spanning seven genres and boasting 15 guest artists, the release shows us an entirely new side of the band while maintaining their identity. The album has been receiving rave reviews since it’s release.\n\nThis year, Sit Kitty Sit was a featured performer at NAMM 2015 as guests of Killer Q Instrument Straps, whose presentation booth went on to win Best In Show. After teaming up with Sleepless Sounds Music Group in Los Angeles, CA to release a new 2015 single and continuing to tour the U.S., Sit Kitty Sit will take the leap over the pond in late October 2015 with their first ever European Tour. New music and tour dates are always in the works so keep your eyes and ears open in their direction.\n\nKat Downs is a Musician, Artist, Teacher, Composer and Performer originally from Green Bay, WI. She began studying music in the 2nd grade continuing on through high school and college earning a BA Degree in Music from St. Norbert College in DePere, WI. Now based out of San Francisco, CA, Kat’s current projects include the powerhouse Hard Piano Rock duo, Sit Kitty Sit, and the goth rock band, Saints of Ruin. She is the staff composer for Wily West Productions, the Music Consultant for Blue Scorpion Dance Theatre and has an exclusive studio of piano and flute students. Best known for her intense piano playing style and exceptional lyrical compositions, Kat tours nationally and has shared the stage with such names as LP, The Memorials, Chris Wyse, En Esch, Mona Mur, Erica Dilanjian, Shannon Curfman, Lennon, Javier Mosley and WASP.\n\nMike Thompson is a Drummer, Percussionist, Performer and Arranger hailing from the tiny town containing major talent, Westerly, RI. He started officially banging on the drums in private lessons at age 10 and went on to star in his award winning high school Jazz, Concert & Marching bands. He continued feeding his passion for music by studying at Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA under drumming greats such as Jamey Haddad, Rod Morgenstein and Kenwood Dennard earning a BA Degree in Music Performance and Business. Having played in bands such as The Big Nasty and Tokyo Raid, Mike has shared the stage with many other bands and artists such as Gary Clark Jr., Pat Travers, Chris Wyse, John Vanderslice and Javie Mosley. Now living in the CA Bay Area, he is mainly devoting his time with partner, Kat Downs, to touring nationally and garnering more exposure for their powerhouse Hard Piano Rock duo, Sit Kitty Sit.\n\nUnwed Mothers is a four-piece blues/indie-rock outfit from Edmonton, Alberta that formed in 2012. Making a name for themselves as “the little girl with the big voice”, the band has become known for delivering a high energy, gritty style that boasts fat guitar sounds, heart shaking beats and power house vocals.\n\n​\n\nThe release of their self-titled debut album in the April of 2013 was met with glowing response from multiple publications including Knowshi.com (Dallas) saying of the LP: “I’m not usually excited enough about what I hear to share it with everyone. But this album is something completely different”. The 8 track compilation dabbled in multiple genres showing off their stylistic flexibility and impressive lyricism. Within months of forming the band was invited to showcase at Canadian Music Week 2013 in Toronto and soon after their return they were back on the road touring Western Canada. Later tour dates would include stops in the United States with shows in Washington and Oregon. With a steadily growing fan base Unwed Mothers entered the regular rotations on College Radio stations all over Canada charting at #1 on CHRW London, ON and entering the top 20 in multiple other cities. In September the band earned the coveted position of the Sonic 102.9FM Band of the Month which led to some additional exposure including a live performance/interview on Global Edmonton’s Breakfast Television, a live acoustic webisode on Balcony TV and a slot at NXNE 2014 in June. Following their performance at NXNE, Unwed Mothers performed at Boonstock 2014 sharing the stage which popular acts such as Head of the Herd, The Airborne Toxic Event, City and Color and Mother Mother. The group also received two nominations for the Edmonton Music Awards for both “Rock Recording of the Year (Skeletons)” and “People’s Choice”. The band will be releasing a follow-up album titled “Workhorse” this summer.\n\n​\n\nUnwed Mothers is Julie Adams, Michael James, Jesse Northey and Kurtis Schultz.\n\nLou and Kev talk about David Bowie and he was so important. In addition to being an iconic singer, songwriter and performer he also introduced the world to several guitarists who became icons in their own right. We also have feature songs by Loudini Artists The Family Business, Gene the Werewolf, and Monster Truck. Birthday shout outs to Pat Simmons (Doobie Bros Guitarist), Robin Zander (Cheap Trick Singer), and Danny Frederici (E Street Band Keyboardist)\n\nBand Members\n\nAlec White - Guitar, Vocals\n\nEric Ziegler - Guitar\n\nGarrett Wartenweiler - Bass, Guitar\n\nDerek Hendrickson - Drums\n\nThe band hails from Pittsburgh when in 2007 five musicians disillusioned from their previous experiences decided to join forces in something « insanely different » from what they have been doing until then and “give a nod to the music we listened to growing up in the 80's. One of the more important aspects of the new project was to not take ourselves too seriously and have fun with it”, tells the band’s guitar player Drew Donegan.\n\nIt didn't take long for people to gravitate towards the band, as local media outlets began referring to the band as Pittsburgh's local 'Supergroup'. Furthermore, the bands first show sold out within minutes of doors opening !\n\nDonegan describes Gene the Werewolf’s sound as “classic rock with a modern vibe”, similar to what bands like Kiss, Def Leppard, AC/DC and Motley Crüe would sound like if they released their music today... a far cry from the pop-punk bands the band members had been in previously. “We also like the term diamond-core, because diamond is the hardest rock known to man”, Donegan adds.\n\nWhen referring to “Rock n Roll Animal”, the band's newest album, Gene exclaims: \"It's the perfect soundtrack to a beer-infused Saturday night!\"\n\nPlenty of bands aren’t shy about flaunting cocky bios and making no secret of their self-perceived talent, but few take it as far as Gene the Werewolf. “We used to say we were the best rock band, but by now I’d say we’re just the best band ever,” Donegan said. “We play absurdly loud, sweat our asses off, and then sleep on filthy apartment floors together because we love doing it \".\n\nUltimately, the band's intentions are as pure as they've ever been. \"We formed this band to play loud, rowdy, and crude Rock N' Roll,\" says Gene. \"I think with this record we've accomplished everything we've ever wanted out of being in a band together.\"\n\nSince the release of the bands debut \"Light Me Up\" in 2009, Gene The Werewolf have been featured in various national and local publications including Spin Magazine, Pittsburgh Post Gazette, Tribune Review, Pittsburgh City Paper, and more. Gene was on SPIN magazine's Top 15 \"Songs You Must Hear Now\" in November 2009, and #2 on The Daily News \"Best of 2009\" list. The band has also enjoyed local and regional airplay along with frequent in-studio performances on 102.5 WDVE and 105.9 WXDX in Pittsburgh.\n\nLate in 2010 Gene had the idea to cover a version of the 1978 local classic \"Steelers Fight Song\". Gene's version, named \"Steelers Polka\", went viral during the football season and received over 340,000 views on YouTube along with airplay from local and national radio.\n\nIn January of 2012, Gene's new single \"I Only Wanna Rock N Roll\" was added to full rotation to Pittsburgh's Clear Channel radio station 102.5 WDVE FM! It reached the \"#1 most played single\" on the station for over 5 weeks in a row, beating out the Foo Fighters and Nickelback.\n\nIn November 2012, Gene The Werewolf signed with European label Frontiers Records, home of iconic bands like Journey, Def Leppard, Night Ranger, Rick Springfield and more! Their international debut entitled \"Rock N Roll Animal\" was release in all of Europe on November 23 and in Japan on November 21.\n\nCheck out Gene The Werewolf at: genethewerewolf.com\n\nThe term Rock n' Roll gets thrown around pretty haphazardly. One can go as far as stating it’s been bastardized to the point of being unrecognizable, ironically shouted on stages worldwide, and classified dead or MIA by the very musicians that once upheld its standard.\n\nEnter Monster Truck. There's something comforting about a band name that delivers exactly what you expect to hear. Born in 2009 from the ashes of various Canadian Indie bands, Monster Truck began as a sonic affront to the very industry its members were bred from. After feeling more like cogs in the music industry machine, Jon Harvey (bass & lead vocals), Jeremy Widerman (guitar & vocals), Brandon Bliss (organ & vocals) and Steve Kiely (drums & vocals) broke free to forge their own path, answering only to themselves. “It was admittedly a bit selfish from the get-go as we only were looking to please ourselves,” laughs Widerman. Their unabashed approach to making and performing music became infectious. “We just wanted to mix all of our favorite hard rock, punk and classic rock favourites into something raw and basic,” states Widerman, almost as if to suggest that no one had done it to his liking yet. The band was doing something right. A ground swell of regional fans quickly began rushing to any local venue to see the band perform live. Rock n' Roll is clearly not dead.Offers began to pile up for Hamilton, Ontario’s prodigious sons, and the band soon realized they had to make a decision to jump in hip deep and take the record label and tour offers more seriously. “The decision was probably easier than I'd like to admit,” adds Widerman, suggesting they were probably all kidding themselves thinking they weren't willing to make sacrifices once again in an attempt to make music for a living. What started as a fun and albeit ‘selfish’ musical side-project, quickly gained momentum and took on a life of its own. Monster Truck self-released a self-titled EP produced by Gus Van Go & Werner F (The Stills, Preistess, Hollerado) in 2010 and followed up with The Brown EP (2011) produced by Eric Ratz (Billy Talent, Cancer Bats, Three Days Grace) on Indie powerhouse Dine Alone Records. The Brown EP aggressively showcased the band’s ability to keep a firm grasp in the classic roots that enabled them, while staying contemporary and true to their vast influences. Singles “Seven Seas Blues” and “Righteous Smoke” became runaway hits reaching Top 10 on Canadian Rock radio and true to their notorious maxim “Don’t F*ck With The Truck”, the band hit the road with a vengeance. Tours included a 2011 cross-Canada sold-out run with The Sheepdogs. Additional tours followed in 2012 when Monster Truck was handpicked to open for Slash on his North American tour, as well as sold-out dates in support of legends Deep Purple.\n\nAfter an unexpected, yet highly successful year of relentless touring, Monster Truck returned home hell bent to record a full-length album. Over the course of 2 months, the guys put together 12 original songs showcasing not only their determination to continue churning out heart-pounding rock tracks, but that also highlighted another dimension to the band’s songwriting and performance. The result is their debut full-length LP aptly titled Furiosity.\n\nProduced once again by JUNO-nominated Eric Ratz at Vespa Studios in Toronto and Echo Mountain Studios in Asheville, NC, Furiosity showcases Monster Truck’s ability to seamlessly integrate influences from grunge and punk era greats that they love so dearly with alt-sounding vintage rock. The resulting album remains anchored in grooves, yet propulsive and volcanic, fueled by frontman Jon Harvey’s colossal vocal delivery.\n\nThe album impressingly runs the gamut from crushing first single \"Sweet Mountain River\" which features a highly infectious chorus juxtaposed against a killer riff, to tracks like “The Lion” and its definitive old-school, boogie-rock vibe. “While the bulk of songs were written and executed in fairly quick fashion, tailoring the pace and fine tuning the transitions took longer than usual,” says Widerman of the writing process. “We really wanted the songs to take the listener on an exciting journey.” Gems like “Old Train” featuring epic gang vocals were in fact kept under wraps from the producer and the label until the band reworked them to their liking while “Power of the People” -- a Rage Against The Machine inspired track -- is a commentary on a society in turmoil and an anthem for those who wish to band together and make a difference.\n\nThe band intentionally challenged themselves with “For The Sun”, spending more than a year playing the song live in order to perfect it. Slower-paced and with thought to ensuring every moment was well-crafted and building in intensity, Widerman spent 2 days in the studio just recording the intro and solos leaving other members of the band to wonder whether he would ever be satisfied with the end result. Finally, last minute addition “My Love Is True” shows a more soulful side of Monster Truck, and is another shining example of how even a down tempo song can shake you to your core.\n\nThe constant show regiment and recording process is sharpening the band’s delivery and there's no doubt that anyone still interested in original and authentic rock music will be compelled to pay attention. Monster Truck will continue doing what they do best, steamrolling from town to town leaving legions of fans in their wake.\n\nCheck this out from the Loudini Rock and Roll Circus\n\nHosted by Lou Lombardi aka Loudini & Kevin O'Connor\n\nWhere are your fans??? Learn the secret to finding the perfect fans!\n\nThis week Loudini and Kevin reveal some little talked about ways of finding your ideal fans. Plus music from Loudini artists The Von, Circle of One, Lance Lopez and a sneak peak at the new ep from the artist Koralee. All this and a visit from fan boi Pittsburgh Kevin! Birthday Shout out to Sade\n\n#loudini #loulombardi #kevinoconnor #fans\n\nTHE VON is an American Indie/Electro/Rock band from South Florida formed in 2012 by vocalist/bassist Luis Bonilla and guitarist Marek Schneider. For much of their career, THE VON has been a trio with drummer Elisa Seda, who replaced their former drummer after the recording of the band’s upcoming album (2015). All three members of THE VON came together and formed a bond by talking about their favorite rock n’ roll legends; bands that are now big influences in their music. These passions are at the forefront of what the band brings to the crowd with their energy which is nothing short of contagious; they are not just a band but an experience.\n\nIn 2015, THE VON will release a brand new album entitled, Ei8ht. The album digs deeper into musical influences and infusing of their diverse cultures, yoga ideology, and overarching themes of living life fearlessly. By the beginning of 2015, THE VON released their first single Nothing to Fear, soon to be followed by Cry Of War this year. Currently, THE VON is preparing a National and European Tours in 2016.\n\nhttp://thevon4u.com/about-us/\n\nMusic is at its best when it's born out of passion, meaning, and purpose. Unfortunately, for today's listeners, many artists simply fall back on exhausted formulas, as they quickly sacrifice passion for sales. However, rather than falling back with its peers, Circle of One aims to step up. \"Too many musicians are just making noise. Nobody's saying anything of value,\" says frontman Mark Cunzolo. \"You're attracted to someone. Great. You like to party. Great. But what's the point in telling people about that? Let's use music to unpack some deeper issues.\" Circle of One tackles this challenge by lacing its hard-rock, metal, hip-hop, and electronically infused music with tales of internal fear, substance abuse struggles, self-control issues, and more. Most importantly, Circle of One passionately displays the power and the hope needed to find freedom from these issues. Their music has a message. Their music has a purpose. It's time to spread it like wildfire.\n\nThere’s no doubt about it, the state of Texas is well known world wide for its fiery blues guitar players.\n\nEven just a cursory look will reveal the state’s rich tradition, which easily rivals Chicago and Mississippi for producing players who have been both originators and contributors to the legacy of the guitar’s significant role in the genre’s history. Dating back to the 1920’s with “Blind” Lemon Jefferson, continuing through the 1950’s with such legends as Freddie King, T-Bone Walker and “Lightning” Hopkins, with the advent of the rock era of the 1960’s the pressure cooker exploded.\n\nAlbino blues giant Johnny Winter, from Beaumont, in 1968 was signed to what was then the largest advance in the history of the recording industry—$600,000. Houston’s ZZ Top, with the Reverend Willie G, i.e. Billy F. Gibbons – armed with a ’59 Les Paul- during the 70’s went from being “That little ol’ band from Texas” to being world wide ambassadors with their unique brand of deep blues infused boogie rock.\n\nAlthough disco and subsequently new wave lessened blues rock’s influence in the late 70’s, by 1983 it was another native Texan, Dallas born Stevie Ray Vaughan, whose combination of raw blues mixed with Hendrix styled pyrotechnics spearheaded yet another resurrection as the genre rose its evil head once again. A breath of much needed fresh air amongst the synth heavy offerings on MTV and radio airwaves of the time, the guitarist’s massive influence has extended long beyond his untimely, tragic death twenty years ago.\n\nOne such player whom Vaughan touched the soul of was young, gifted blues/rock axeslinger Lance Lopez. Although born in Shreveport, Louisiana, at the age of 12, his family moved to Dallas, where with the exception of a spell back in New Orleans and Southwest Florida, the guitarist has called his home ever since.\n\nA professional musician since the age of 14 when he began playing local bars in and around the New Orleans, Louisiana area, at 17 he was hired by soul great Johnnie Taylor, with whom he toured for six months. By 18 he was hired as the band leader of blues legend Lucky Peterson’s band, spending three years touring throughout the world.\n\nIt was while with Peterson in Europe that he struck up a close friendship with the larger than life drummer Buddy Miles, subsequently becoming the guitarist for The Buddy Miles Express for a brief time. The former Band Of Gypsys legend would go on to mentor Lopez, leading to him co producing his debut album ‘First Things First’, along with Grammy winning producer Jay Newland (Norah Jones) which was released independently in 1998.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2007 Lopez recorded, and released three studio and one live CD for a small independent label, Grooveyard Records – all of which were heavily influenced by another of the guitarist’s main influences – Jimi Hendrix. Despite the hindrance of being released on such a label, the albums are all prime examples of post Hendrix heavy blues, filled to the brim with awe inspiring fretwork, which led to him garnering a cult following amongst guitar fanatics world wide.\n\nAfter a three year break, Lopez returned with a Jim Gaines (Stevie Ray Vaughan, Buddy Guy, Santana) produced studio album ‘Salvation From Sundown’. Intentionally conceived as a more traditional Texas blues styled offering, it’s the guitarist’s most mature recording to date, showcasing strong songwriting while still retaining the red-hot fretwork which has elicited none other than guitar god Jeff Beck to call him “A very exciting and intense blues guitarist”. His first release on a major label MIG Music/String Commander. In Europe in November 2011 MIG Music released the follow up to ‘Salvation From Sundown’. A very strong Hard Rocking/Blues offering entitled ‘Handmade Music’. ‘Handmade Music’ is full of well crafted songs and Lopez’s signature searing guitar work. Again, Lopez working with Jim Gaines, recorded this entire album in the legendary Ardent Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. Ardent was also where Led Zeppelin, ZZ Top, Stevie Ray Vaughan, George Thorogood and others made some of their greatest works. ‘Handmade Music’ shows him poised to take his rightful place as one of the finest blues players on the planet. Texas has its guitar heroes, not least of which is Johnny Winter, Billy Gibbons, and the legendary Stevie Ray Vaughan. And here’s another to add to the list: Lance Lopez.\n\nhttp://www.lancelopeztx.com/about-us/\n\nI love being an artist because it allows me to reimagine everything - including the way music gets into the hands of my fans.\n\nSince 2010, I've been financially responsible for all of my projects, from recording to video production. I have learned so much and worked with some incredible people. But I’m now at point in the professional path where it takes more than my single income earnings to support my creation.Being limited in cash has NEVER prevented me from creating, but it has prevented me from sharing that creation with you - and that doesn't fully serve anyone in the long run, because I don't just do this for me. Your generous assistance means I can move up a level in my professional career by securing better resources and thus, give you more music.\n\nhttps://www.indiegogo.com/projects/koralee-s-next-ep-ep2015-is-almost-ready#/\n\nOn this edition of the Loudini Rock and Roll Circus Lou aka Loudini and Kevin talk about the importance of a producer and what a difference it can make to an artist. Also “Mr. Smoove” stops by the studio. Plus Music from Loudini Artists Mary Jennings, Shannon and the Merger, and Paul Nelson. Birthday shout outs to Paolo Nutini, Jimmy Page & Dave Matthews\n\nIt takes a lot of life experience to craft engaging, universal song lyrics—and singer, songwriter and musician Mary Jennings has had more than a lion’s share. How’s this for a start: career stops as a teacher, aerobics instructor, clothing retailer, bartender, luggage saleswoman and paranormal researcher. Add to that the early loss of her mom , and there are plenty stories to share. Jennings states that music has kept her sane. Not surprisingly, her songs often possess a modicum of sadness and darkness, about which she says, “I share these emotions with others because I know so many have felt the same things. If I can create melodies and deliver words that express their feelings, I’ve done my job.”\n\nWith an enormous singing voice that transcends her small frame, an extraordinary rock sound full of robust piano hooks, and a one-of-a-kind storytelling ability drawn from a remarkable and emotional history, Mary has carved out her own unique niche in the industry by doing things her way.\n\nBorn into a family with strong musical roots, she began playing piano at five and has fond memories of her paternal grandparents teaching her vocal harmonies at a young age – a skill that is very evident in her work today. Mary’s adolescent and teenage years were marked by her development on piano and the cultivation of her vocal ability through many school plays and musicals, but it was the sudden death of her mother in 2001 that prompted a seismic surge in her musical expression.\n\n“When people ask me why I’m a musician, I tell them that it’s largely because music is my therapy,” she says. “That entire notion really began with the death of my mom. My dad offered to help me record an album shortly after her death, and the experience of writing about what I was going through at the time went a long way towards helping me cope.” It was on that album that Mary established her creative foundation, writing music that immediately bonds her to the listener in a genuine way. That openness, and the raw emotion inherent in both her writing and voice, has been a cornerstone of her work ever since. “I share these emotions with others because I know so many have felt the same things. If I can create melodies and deliver words that express their feelings, I’ve done my job.”\n\nWhile the music alone makes Mary Jennings an artist that fans can easily relate to, her somewhat quirky personality and a diverse range of interests have also gone a long way towards building a bond with her fan base. An avid horror movie fan, she has more than 400 fright flicks in her own private collection and openly admits that being scared and thrilled is probably her biggest geek factor. Her love for thrifting and secondhand clothing, something she learned from her mother, is a major influence on her vintage style and the inspiration behind the enormously popular clothing swap shows that she has hosted in a number of U.S. cities. More recently, Mary has turned her unique style, love of thrifting, and drive to create into a new project, No Sass Creations, through which she makes and sells bolo ties.\n\n“I don’t want my fans thinking of me as just another musician asking them to come to shows or buy music,” she remarks. “It’s more important, and fun, to engage with them and shine a little light on my hobbies and personal life because at the end of the day, I’m really not much different from any of them.”\n\nMary’s strong work ethic and commitment to her craft has paid off handsomely in recent years. A Casio-sponsored artist, she was featured in an online advertising campaign for the company’s new line of keyboards in 2011 and her song “The Darkness” was placed in the Lionsgate motion picture \"Devil Seed\" (ironically, a horror film). In 2014, her song “Move” was featured during a final dance on Lifetime’s tv show “Dance Moms.”\n\nMary has organized a number of extensive tours as well, opening for artists such as Jeffrey Gaines, Mike Doughty, Teddy Geiger, Ryan Cabrera, and Rachel Yamagata, and she has appeared at several major festivals including CMJ and South by Southwest. She often treats fans to a unique stage set-up when performing on her own, prominently featuring a loop pedal that she uses to effortlessly layer rhythmic beats and beautiful background harmonies over her unmistakably unique piano playing and vocals.\n\nWhether you experience Mary Jennings on stage or on one of the handful of albums she has released, you’re witnessing a very special artist who has confidently found her voice over the course of a long, and at time, heartbreaking journey.\n\n11 song debut CD of original material, \"Long Way Down\" released December 2015.\n\nMelodic vocals + virtuoso harmonica playing + a dynamic rhythm section = Shannon and the Merger:\n\nFamiliar tunes with a twist.\n\nLive music you can dance to.\n\nPlaying the songs you know from the\n\n1960s to the hits of today as well as\n\nShannon and the Merger originals.\n\nBand Members\n\nShannon Watson, Ryan Luko, BobbyG, Stanley J, Murray Perry\n\nPaul Nelson has toured with countless worldwide acts and performed live and or on recordings along side a list of today's top artists such as Johnny Winter, Eric Clapton, Billy Gibbons, Ben Harper, Leslie West, Robben Ford, Joe Perry, Mark Knofler, Brian Setzer, Dr. John, Slash, Vince Gill, Warren Haynes, Sonny Landreth, Los Lobos, Kim Wilson, Elvin Bishop, Kenny Wayne Sheperd, Reb Beach, Steve Morse, John Popper, Debbie Davies, Joe Louis Walker, Derek Trucks, Susan Tedeschi, John Medeski, Joe Walsh, Larry Carlton, Steve Vai, Earl Slick, Hubert Sumlin, Rick Derringer, Harvey Brooks, Bill Evans, James Cotton, Magic Slim, Coco Montoya, Reese Wynans, Edgar Winter, Ray Davis, George Lynch, James Cotton, Anthony Jackson, Dickey Betts, Junior Brown, Pat Travers, Jimmy Vivino and La Bamba of Late Night with Conan O'Brien and Paul Schaefer's CBS Orchestra to name a few.\n\nNelson has been featured in every major guitar magazine and news publication from Guitar World to Rolling Stone and is credited as being a composer/performer for music heard on international and national television broadcasts such as NBC, TNN, UPN, for the WWF. He has conducted his successful \"Master Class\" Clinics and written guitar columns all over the world.\n\nPaul has had the distinction of appearing as both guitarist and songwriter on Rock/Blues legend Johnny Winter's Grammy-nominated Virgin/EMI release \"I'm A Bluesman\" as well as producer/performer on his releases \"Roots\" and the Grammy winning \"Step Back\" on Megaforce/Sony. He performed as a musical guest with Johnny Winter on the Late Night with David Letterman Show to promote the \"Roots\" Album and on Jimmy Kimmel on ABC TV to promote the Step Back CD and Johnny Winter's \"Down and Dirty Movie\", which he also appeared in and was the Executive Producer.\n\nNelson, who studied with Steve Vai in his Berklee days, jazz fusion great Steve Khan and Mike Stern has created a tour de force with his latest all-instrumental rock/fusion solo release, entitled LOOK. - \"A very diverse package that takes the listener on a sophisticated journey through the musical mind of Paul Nelson.

Plus Loudini share’s his super secret social media ninja trick guaranteed to get people to engage with your social media posts. This is also the final recap of the top Loudini artists with music by Silk9, The Turbosonics, Sandi Thom, Maryleigh Roohan and Tarra Layne.\n\nSilk9 is a Pittsburgh PA based hard rock band that was founded in April of 2013 by Anthony\n\nLeone and Jamie Rohr.\n\nThe\" vision\" of Silk9 was to \"embrace\" the essence of the 90’s and add an original spin\n\non today’s hard rock genre.\n\nIn May of 2014 the band released its first EP entitled “Exit the Pain.” Songs from the EP have\n\nbeen featured on 97.7 fm located in Butler PA, Adrenaline 101 internet radio, 105.9 fm the X, in\n\nPittsburgh PA., 102.5 WDVE in Pittsburgh PA, ThePAROCKSHOW.COM, The EAgle 107.5 and recently featured on Lou Lombardi's, Rock n' Roll Circus.\n\nWe strive to keep our standards high by working with some of the top local bands in the area and national acts such as Lynch Mob,\n\nAdelitas Way, The Art of Dying, Hillbilly Herald, Drowning Pool, Crobot,Skid Row and on most recently Jake E Lee's Red Dragon's Cartel\n\nThe Turbosonics is a three piece instrumental surf-rock band based in Pittsburgh, PA. Turbosonics play original instrumentals, traditional surf music (Dick Dale, Link Wray, The Surfaris, The Ventures, etc.), and a few from bands like the Pixies, Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet and The Propellerheads.\n\nCheck out a show, you will not be disappointed!\n\nBand Members\n\nKeith Caldwell – Bass\n\nTimmy Klatte – Drummer\n\nJason Truckenbrod – Guitar\n\nInfluences\n\nGood Surf Music\n\nSurfing\n\nGirls\n\nZombies\n\nWhile these are not what you might expect in this section...they are all things that influence us.\n\nSandi Thom was the first singer/songwriter ever to gain global stardom and a major label record deal through the use of webcasting.\n\nThere may have been a backlash – it happens when anyone does anything ground-breaking – but there’s no getting away from the fact that she was the first pioneer of what was a huge turning point in the music industry.\n\nBut it’s a long way from that global smash – ‘I Wish I Was a Punk Rocker (With Flowers in My Hair)’ launched from webcasts in a London basement – to where proud Scot Sandi Thom finds herself today with an amazing, eclectic, highly credible body of work behind her… and an amazing new album ahead.\n\nShe has recorded in Nashville and LA, has worked with top producers and songwriters, has written for important media outlets like The Daily Beast, has graced the stage of the legendary Royal Albert Hall, has played at Glastonbury, has performed on stage with Brian May, Alice Cooper and George Michael and is now embarking on a brand new groundbreaking chapter in her career as she produces her new album.\n\n‘Weapons of Past Destruction is the first album I’ve produced,’ says Sandi. In fact, there aren’t many female singer/songwriters who also produce their own work, but then Sandi has never been afraid to break new ground. ‘It’s about picking up the pieces and starting all over again in the aftermath of an emotional disaster,’ she goes on.\n\n‘The songs are about war, death, destruction, anger, courage and hope as well as reconciling with the past and moving on. I don’t pretend to have a hard life. I’m not living through a war. I don’t know that kind of pain and suffering but in my own small way, like everyone in life, I have had to face that moment when the rug gets pulled out from under your feet and you’re left standing there with a broken heart, shattered dreams and the long road ahead to rebuild your life.’\n\nThe moment she’s referring to was the end of her long-term relationship with legendary musician Joe Bonamassa. It was a split that came out of the blue, leaving Sandi shell-shocked and at a loss for what to do next. ‘The first single from the album is called “Earthquake”,' she says. 'It’s a song where I try to come to terms with what happened that day. I wanted to write a song to share with people of all ages who could relate to how I felt when I had that bombshell dropped on me. It’s often hard to put into words.’ She also accepts that she's been on the other end of the equation, causing the heartbreak as well as being the victim of it.\n\nThese themes of love and war run through the album with songs like 'World War One', that deals with the real human experience of being caught in a war while 'Song of a Broken Heart' deals with the destruction, loss and pain you feel when a relationship disintegrates: '... closing doors in empty halls, silence now where laughter once was, the music fades away...'\n\nThey are songs that Sandi had to write and write again because of how personal they were to her. The chorus of 'Song of a Broken Heart' is, she explains, 'almost an anthem for all those who have experienced something like this... \"this is the song of the last goodbye, this is the song of the great divide\".'\n\nBut it's not all heartbreak. There is anger then the sense of rebuilding, digging deep and finding the courage to start that long road to recovery. Songs like 'Carry You Over the Finish Line' and 'The Courage' are, she explains, 'about the hope that one day you are going to look back on all this and be thankful for the pain that you endured because what was waiting for you was a whole lot more exciting.'\n\nIn Sandi's case, what was waiting for her was Matt, a man she fell in love with almost at first sight and who proposed to her even before their first kiss, an experience that inspired her most recent songs, tracks like 'Timeless' and 'Soarsa', an unfinished song from years ago she was driven to complete by real events. 'These are songs of hope,' she explains. 'Songs that show that in the aftermath of an emotional disaster, what lies in front of you can be a million times better than what you left behind.'\n\nAs well as wanting to write and produce songs that people of all ages could relate to, Sandi also wanted to return to her pop roots. 'After many years of a musical adventure into many different genres, I wanted to go back to creating catchy, memorable melodies very much like my earlier work,' she explains. Having managed herself for years and having released her own albums, producing was the next logical step. 'It brings together everything I've learned throughout the years working with so many incredible musicians and producers,' she explains. 'Now was most certainly the time to come back with a bang.'\n\nIt all started in Scotland where Sandi grew up in a family filled with singers, musicians, poets and published authors. 'Expressing yourself was always encouraged,' she says. 'It's just what you did.' Steeped in the storytelling music of Joni Mitchell, that original punk rocker with flowers in her hair, and Buffy Sainte-Marie, who she would eventually come to record a duet with, Sandi was learning piano by the age of four and at 12 realised that she didn't have to play other people's songs but could write her own. By this time, she was playing and singing with a group much of much older men on the local circuit, just getting into the music of Fleetwood mac that they were exposing her to. She still has some of the early demos from when she was basically a child.\n\nWith this early immersion into the world of music, it should come as no surprise that Sandi was the youngest person ever to be accepted into the prestigious Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts, where she honed her skills not only in music and performance but in the business side of the music industry as well. As she says about the now legendary webcasts from the basement in south London that went global, it wasn't an accidental arrival on the scene, it was a conscious act of promotion from someone who knew the business and was ahead of the curve when it came to what was then called 'new media'. The result of putting this knowledge into action was a global number one single - 'I Wish I Was a Punk Rocker (With Flowers In My Hair' - and a global career.\n\nBut despite such massive commercial success, including an album that went straight to the top of the UK charts, Sandi has never seen chart-topping as her reason for being in music, preferring to explore the world and use her experience to illuminate her songwriting, like Joni Mitchell before her. She was writing and recording 'records that were off on a tangent', she explains, including one that was openly 'a big \"screw you\" to the industry'. She was choosing the path of the genuine musician, rather than the pop star. It was a bold path to take, turning your back on success to actually explore your craft, but it's a boldness that has always stood Sandi in good stead, bagging her a ground-breaking US record deal despite no sales history there.\n\nShe was also resisting her friends' pleas for her to start writing for films or for other artists, where they were convinced she could make her millions. 'But I knew it wouldn't make me happy,' explains the woman who has always run her own career. 'I never gave up and I just kept rallying through to have some amazing experiences. Some great musicians I worked with genuinely showed me real respect.'\n\nIt's the combination of that musicianship, her experiences - for good or bad - and her sheer boldness that makes Weapons of Past Destruction the album it is. 'There was a lot of emotion that I had to work through,' she concludes. 'But now I've met Matt and he's like the male version of me. We're like two peas in a pod. I realise now that I always longed for someone adventurous, exciting and not afraid to take a chance.'\n\nAnd with all of that stacked in her corner, this album truly marks the reboot of what has already been an amazing career.\n\n“The wisdom of an old soul in the body of a young, yearning individual.” Whether it’s her dynamic and passionate performances, or her poignant and honest songwriting, this sentiment has been expressed throughout Roohan’s career. With a style that shifts seamlessly from sunny indie pop to heartfelt Americana and a stage presence that’s full of dynamic soul, she’s an entrancing presence who is making waves.\n\nMaryLeigh was nurtured as a writer and performer at the celebrated Caffe Lena before shipping off to play pubs in Scotland for a year. Since moving back to the states, she has played everywhere from intimate cafes to wild festivals and has had the pleasure to open for acts like Milo Greene, Sister Sparrow & the Dirty Birds, and Sean Rowe, and tour alongside Erin McKeown, Chris Pureka, and Melissa Ferrick.\n\nIn 2011, Roohan ventured to The Music Shed in New Orleans to record her debut album, The Docks. The album received wide acclaim in New York’s capital region. Beyond securing rotation on both college and public radio stations (WEXT, WEQX, WSPN), The Docks’ single “Foolish Girl” was named second to Sean Rowe’s “Downwind” in 97.7 WEXT’s Top 60 Songs of New York’s Capital Region (2012). This release and her many heartfelt performances reached wide audiences and, in 2012, the top alt-weekly in New York's capital region - Metroland -named Roohan \"Best Female Singer-Songwriter\".\n\nTaking time to graduate from college, Roohan was laying low in 2013 except for her secret adventures to record a new album with Jason Brown at JBrown Noise. The time in the studio yielded a ten-song album that she released nationally in January 2014. Met with glowing reviews in her hometown, Roohan has widened her sights. With Skin & Bone in hand and her persistent wanderlust has brought her into the hearts of people all over the country. Skin & Bone has attracted new fans and opportunities including the chance to create original music for a soon-to-be-released documentary about women of 1969. Catch her in concert by checking her forever-changing tour schedule.\n\n“This red-headed blues broad is sure to rattle your emotions and free your raw, rebellious side.”\n\nTarra Layne’s third-coming EP ‘Once You Go Red…’ featuring her roof-blowing single ‘Cherry Moonshine’ is just the beginning of a new musical journey for all to experience. The lead song has earned her a Hollywood Music in Media Award for Best Female Vocal as well as a place on the Hot 100 Unsigned Artists list in Music Connection’s 37th Anniversary Edition. She celebrated the EP’s release during PBR’s Cowboy Spring Break at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, performing alongside Lauren Alaina and Cassadee Pope.\n\nTarra resides in a place where Grace Potter, Amy Winehouse, and Gretchen Wilson collide – where gritty, care-free, home-grown soul meets sultry pop-rock ‘n roll. Combining her heavy 90s R&B upbringing with a love for rock and blues, Tarra is uprooting and constructing a style of her own. It has been referred to as Funktry due to her big soulful timbre, southern attitude, and contemporary twist. Thousands of followers and downloads later, Tarra is creating something quite extraordinary.\n\nLast year, Tarra received a proposal to be a featured vocalist on a blues project based in Minneapolis, MN. Having lived in Nashville, and traveled coast to coast for various musical endeavors, she wasn’t expecting much from the seemingly random town in the midwest. Yet, she quickly realized she was not only recording a song written for Etta James, but also performing on a project with Grammy award-winning players who made their living working with the finest legacy artists of the 20th century. Steve Cropper, Sonny T, Larrie Londin, Jellybean Johnson, and Norbert Putnam, to name a few. The occasion evolved into a rare opportunity that any artist, young or seasoned, could only imagine. In October, she was offered the chance to record her own material with a handful of the heavyweights and soon found herself in a vocal booth at a hip studio tucked away in a corner of the San Fernando Valley. She peered through the glass at Leland Sklar, Waddy Wachtel, Russ Kunkel, and Dr. Matt Fink as they shredded away at songs that she had penned. Having only claimed residency in Los Angeles a few months prior, it was quite the kickoff to proceed her endeavors in the City of Angels.\n\nIt wasn’t the first time Tarra had reached an incredible milestone. Her first self-released single, ‘Beautiful Day’, earned her a spot gracing the stage with Gavin DeGraw and Vanessa Carlton at the Origins Rocks Earth Month Concert in 2012. ‘Beautiful Day’ had been up against over 4,000 submissions to win the opportunity and was featured in an Origins Skin Care campaign, which had widened eyes in the management world. After the event, she hit the road for a tour in New York and was recognized by Pittsburgh’s Iron City Beer as an artist on the rise. Returning home, she scored a spot hosting a small web-series called Hot Rock TV. Though short-lived, she interviewed celebrities such as the ‘Queen of Bluegrass’ herself, Rhonda Vincent, country star Phil Vassar, 80s icon Eddie Money, and the one and only Bret Michaels.\n\nIn 2013, Layne released her live sophomore EP, ‘The Yellow Couch Sessions,’ which jet-propelled her fanbase. She sells her ‘signed and smooched’ merchandise online to the masses and continues to grow her audience, a following now over 45,000. Currently in Los Angeles, she has landed demo sessions for Cirque du Soleil, television, and major artists. She is continuing to write and perform regularly. To put it lightly, Tarra’s tenacity in ‘keeping up with the big dogs’ is impressive. At this pace, it won’t be long until you see Tarra shining with the greats on big stages.\n\nLoudini Rock and Roll Circus\n\nHosted by LouLombardi aka Loudini & Kevin O'Connor\n\nWhat are the GREATEST Music Documentaries of all time?\n\nThere are some amazing music documentaries out there.

The members currently place the band's genre as Fusion Rock.\n\nThe band’s prominent past gigs include the Ray Ban / Rolling Stone 'Never Hide Sounds Open Mic Night' in October 2011, IIM-Ahmedabad's cultural festival, Chaos, in January 2012, the MaxRockers inaugural Pune edition in March 2012. The band was also featured in a full-length radio interview on Jago Mumbai 90.8 FM in October 2012.\n\nInRegalia performed an acoustic Early Set at Blue Frog, Mumbai in May 2013. Since then they have continued to actively play at venues around the city, notable among them being Out of the Blue, with the band now being a regular face at all their venues in Mumbai and Pune. In April 2014, the band played a corporate gig for telecom provider Bharti Airtel, and then went on to play at Hard Rock Cafe, Mumbai in October 2014.\n\nInRegalia has also played for Muktangan, a Mumbai-based NGO, at the Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon in January this year.\n\nThe band’s first single titled ‘Was it a Dream’ was released early in June 2014. The track is available for download through iTunes, Amazon, Spotify and other major online retailers. The single was also aired on 94.3 FM Radio One, in June 2014, and was also covered in Hindustan Times Café (Mumbai) in the same month. The track went on to air on All India Radio (AIR) Kargil 684 AM on July 8, 2014. The band’s guitarist Vijay Fernandes was interviewed by Bombay Times, on the band and its music on July 25, 2014.\n\nIn the first week of August 2014, InRegalia went on to release their second single titled ‘Rock this House’ which is now also available on iTunes, Amazon, Spotify, etc.\n\nhttp://donicaknight.com/about.html\n\nAs a student at Auburn University in 2008 and 2009, Donica Knight would wait in line for hours for the student section gates to open for football games at Jordan-Hare Stadium. Even after leaving school to pursue a music career, Knight’s love of Auburn football remained strong, and in 2013, she wrote and recorded “Great To Be,” a celebration of the university’s rich football heritage.\n\nIn early 2016, the talented and charismatic singer and songwriter will release her debut EP, Can’t Buy a Southern Girl, which features an exciting blend of country, blues and gritty Southern rock inspired by the likes of Bonnie Raitt, Patsy Cline, Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Rolling Stones. A video for the album’s scorching first single, “Love Ain’t A Prize,” directed by veteran cinematographer Noel Maitland, was released online in September of 2015 and promptly earned airplay around the country and a position on the IndiMusic TV Top 21 Video Countdown. Donica’s success has led to a rigorous touring schedule throughout the southeast, during which she has performed more than 350 dates, opening for iconic acts including Hank Williams Jr., Luke Bryan, Kenny Rogers, The Band Perry and many more.\n\nDonica has written and recorded duets with country legend Ronnie Milsap, and her music has been featured on the soundtracks of films including Halloween Party and Alabama Dirt.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen: Ian Siegal has entered the building. If you know the name, but not the game, it’s high time you made his acquaintance. He’s the multiple British Blues Awardswinner and hot tip of everyone from Mojo to Classic Rock. He’s the songwriter whose recent CD releases sound like career peaks, but are only the start. From one night to the next, he might be a solo acoustic performer or a blood-and-thunder bandleader.\n\nSiegal is known as a bluesman, but it’s just one shade in the palette of an artist who slips between continents, eras and expectations. They say you can’t sing the blues until you’ve lived the life, and when Ian Siegal steps up to the mic, you can hear the slings and arrows. Recent years have seen the songwriter catch fire, with British Blues Awards raining down and consecutive nominations in 2012 & 2013 for Contemporary Album of The Year in the Blues Music Awards - in effect, the Grammys of the Blues.\n\nTHE EARLY YEARS\n\nIt has been said that had Siegal been around in the sixties he would today be accorded the same reverence as artists such as Van Morrison and Joe Cocker. Instead, he is a child of the seventies who dropped out of art college in the late eighties to go busking in Germany. From the streets of Berlin Siegal progressed to clubs around Nottingham in the UK, then to London and ultimately to major stages around Europe.\n\nSiegal’s forte is playing to an audience. He takes command of the stage in a way very few artists alive today can match. Sweat, passion, humour, balls-to-the-wind slide guitar and a soul-infused voice big enough to fell trees! It has won him an ever-growing following of fans and a horde of female admirers.\n\nHis career got under way in 2003/04 with two successive European tours as the opening act for ex-Rolling Stone Bill Wyman’s Rhythm Kings (Wyman also invited Ian to record with the Rhythm Kings). This was followed by UK tours as a duo with Big Bill Morganfield (son of Muddy Waters). During this time Siegal was also capturing the hearts of audiences in Holland, Belgium, Austria and Hungary. In 2005 he topped the Soul/Blues/Jazz charts in Holland.\n\nHis 2005 album Meat &Potatoes has been universally praised and gained a maximum four star (excellent) rating in the Penguin Book of Blues Recordings – Ian is one of only two living British Blues artists to gain this distinction. Meat & Potatoes was later re-released as a limited edition together with a DVD of his stunning performance on the main stage at the North Sea Jazz Festival.\n\nThat was followed by Swagger his 2007 release, which again received universal praise, “No less of a testament to the talents of one of the most innovative, gifted and engaging blues performers on the planet today.” MOJO magazine ranked Swagger as their no.2 Blues album of 2007.\n\nSiegal is equally accomplished solo as he is fronting his band. In response to fans requests for an acoustic album The Dust was released at the end of 2008. A collection of new songs and some old favourites (with noted pedal steel guitarist B.J.Cole appearing on a few tracks), the CD quickly entered HMV’s roots chart, and again made No.2 in MOJO magazine’s Blues album chart – this time for 2008.\n\nHis Oct 09 release Broadside finally gave Ian the top spot in MOJO’s annual Blues album chart.\n\nSiegal’s May ‘11 release The Skinny is an album recorded in north Mississippi with Grammy nominee Cody Dickinson of the North Mississippi Allstars as producer. A band was assembled from musicians in the area including Gary Burnside, Robert Kimbrough and Rodd Bland, all offspring of notable bluesmen.\n\nIan returned to north Mississippi in May 2012 to collaborate with another dream-team of local legends that he collectively coined The Mississippi Mudbloods. Joining Ian and Cody Dickinson were Cody’s bother Luther Dickinson, and Alvin Youngblood Hart. Ian first met Alvin during The Skinny sessions, when the Grammy-winning guitarist swung by the studio and ended up tracking some guitar and backing vocals.\n\nThe end result of this second visit to the Zebra Ranch Studio is Candy Store Kid, which released October 2012 and quickly reached no.1 in the iTunes UK blues chart and garnered a swathe of awards in the UK and nominations in the USA.\n\nIan has become established in Europe as one of the most natural, exciting and vibrant talents on the scene today. Each year the stages get bigger, but what sticks most in Ian’s mind is his guest appearance with then 92-year old Pinetop Perkins and some of the other remaining members of Muddy Waters’ band. This was at London’s Jazz Café in 2005 to a packed house. Then later at a festival in Norway, in a role reversal, these legends of post-war Blues spontaneously joined Ian on stage for what turned into a memorable hour-long set.\n\nIn a twist to his career, Ian performed for several years with France’s Orchestre National de Jazz in a program of Billie Holiday songs entitled “Broadway in Satin.” Backed by a 12-piece orchestra of young hand-picked musicians and accompanied by the French singer, Karen Lanaud, Broadway in Satin has performed at major festivals across France and as far afield as South America and east Africa.\n\nToday is International ALBUM Appreciation Day or #IAAD. We have been together for 8 years now and it just keeps getting better. We started as friends playing and writing music together and thats what it still is and will continue to be. ALBUM would like to thank everyone that has been there for us through out these years and waiting for the next bit of recorded music or next T-shirt. We are not planning on stopping anytime soon, we feel we are just hitting our stride right now, so spread the word of ALBUM. Stay tuned for new music and new merchandise.\n\nThe Loudini Rock and Roll Circus\n\nStar Wars Special Edition\n\nHosted by Lou Lombardi aka Loudini & Kevin O'Connor\n\nIn honor of the release of Star Wars Lou and Kevin talk about all things star wars.

When he started making music with Wendy Dennull in 1991, it was obvious that their harmonies were perfect compliments, and they’ve been making music together ever since!\n\nDennull’s music has been compared to that of The Beatles, Bob Dylan, and Tom Petty, and while those are accurate reflections of the musical influences that can be readily discovered in “Butterfly”, Dennull does Franki_Dennullretain his own unique sound that’s not quite like any of those artists.\n\nThere are subtle differences in overall song composition, lyrical message, instrumentation, and vocal tone that make “Butterfly” stand out from the past, and with its rolling melodies, expanded harmonies, and uplifting lyrics, “Butterfly” seems as apt a title as the lyrical content. There’s a great sense of lightness and softness of the heart in this song that gently reassure the subconscious that there is good in the world, so when you’re in need of a great song to warm your soul, a cool tune to hit the road with, or a friendly jam to ease into your evening or weekend, make “Butterfly” your choice!\n\nPURPOSE is a Band, it's a ministry , and it's a life long dream . Our hope is to reach the world with our music for the sake of the Gospel ( the Truth) The music is a tool to show off our Father. He is the reason we live and breathe and have our being...\n\nFranki Dennull has been using the name PURPOSE as a band and cause since 1978. Though the players have changed, PURPOSE remains. Now PURPOSE FOR LIFE .\"We are all called to a purpose, and ours is to make music that not only pleases the ear, but blesses the soul,\" says Franki. It has been said that Franki's songs paint pictures in your mind and leave an impression on your heart. That is exactly what music is suppose to do. It takes you from where you are to a place you want to be.\n\nThere is a strong Christian message if you listen for it .Classic Rock and blues is the style of music that PURPOSE FOR LIFE is mostly described as. Franki's writing and vocal style has been compared to John Lennon / Beatlesque, and Bob Dylan and Tom Petty as well , while still retaining his own unique style.\n\nWhen Franki and Wendy Dennull started making music together in 1991, it was a forgone conclusion that their harmonies were a winning combination. After Franki struggled with his own failures, their marriage ended and the music stopped. But that was not the end of the story. Through many tears and prayers, God brought this dynamic couple back together and they were re-married on New Year's Eve 2011.Ordained Evangelists and \"Musicians\". . Now they endeavor to shine their light and bring the music back.\n\nGetting The Hell Out and Making Music For Christ's Sake.......\n\nPURPOSE FOR LIFE has preformed in several prisons on the Eastern Sea board as well as churches and festivals . All Church denominations Weddings, Funerals , as well as coffee houses and clubs across the country.\n\nThey have enjoined global radio air play for their music and interviews alike.\n\nBlues piano/vocals, Queen of Boogie Woogie\n\nwendydewitt.com 510/847-5847\n\nShe’s well steeped in the stylings of Otis Spann, Memphis Slim, Sunnyland Slim and Albert Ammons - the greats of boogie and blues, and honed her skills working with contemporary artists Steve Freund, Otis Rush and the late Hank Ballard who’s love of the blues showed in all of his rock classics.\n\nWendy has appeared with Charlie Musselwhite, Otis Rush, and Etta James and has been featured at Berkeley’s historic venue, Freight and Salvage.

AND birthday shout outs to Joe Walsh, Duane Allman and Norman Greenbaum.\n\nMitch Woods and His Rocket 88s have been the torchbearers of a great American blues musical heritage, not for three years but three decades. Taking their inspiration from the great jump n’ boogie outfits of the late 40s and early 50s, they breathe fresh life into the music that gave birth to rock n’roll. Woods styled his group after the jumpin’ n’ jivin’, shoutin’ n’ honkin’, pumpin’ n’ poundin’ bands of Louis Jordan, Wynonie Harris, Joe and Jimmy Liggins, Amos Milburn, and Roy Milton. Adding a healthy dose of New Orleans rhythm and blues, piledrivin’ piano, and some of his own contemporary playful lyrics, Woods and His Rocket 88s forge their own brand of music they call “rock-a-boogie.”\n\nBorn in Brooklyn in 1951, Mitch Woods began playing classical piano at eleven, but his real initiation into blues and boogie piano had already been assured at age eight. “My mom would hire this superintendent of the building, a black man, Mr. Brown, to take me to school, and we stopped off at his cousin’s house, where somebody was playing boogie-woogie piano. It really hit me.”\n\nWoods was putting together bands in Greenwich Village by his mid-teens. By the time he entered the University of Buffalo, Woods was sitting in at local clubs and discovering records by boogie-woogie pioneers Meade Lux Lewis, Albert Ammons, and Pete Johnson. Woods came to San Francisco in 1970, and for the next five years performed as Mitch Woods and His Red Hot Mama (with singer Gracie Glassman). One night Oakland guitarist Hi Tide Harris heard Woods opening for Charlie Musselwhite and was reminded of the sound and theatrics of early R&B pioneer Louis Jordan. Indeed, Jordan has always been a primary influence on Woods. “I actually did see Louie Jordan in Oakland. He was the bridge between swing and rock and roll. He would do a five or six piece band, get a lot of power out of that.”\n\nThat kind of power was to become rallying cry for Mitch’s next project, Mitch Woods and His Rocket 88s, which started in 1980 and quickly rose to the top of the Northern California club circuit. Their first album, Steady Date (Blind Pig Records) got hot reviews in 1984 and led to appearances at two San Francisco Blues Festivals, openings for the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Stevie Ray Vaughan, The Blasters, The Neville Brothers, and James Brown. By 1987, Woods was doing a six-country Europe tour highlighted by a rousing performance at the Belgium Rhythm and Blues Festival.\n\nIn 1988, the 88s released Mr. Boogie’s Back In Town (Blind Pig Records) and music pundits started to acknowledge Woods’ place in the ranks of American music: “Woods lays down an authentic 50s-vintage rock piano groove, comparable in power and rhythmic nuance to classic recordings by the young Jerry Lee Lewis,” said Keyboard Magazine.\n\nOn 1991 album Solid Gold Cadillac, Woods and his band were joined by Ronnie Earl, Charlie Musselwhite and the Roomful of Blues Horns. Woods himself was starting to become a guest star, appearing on that year’s new releases by John Lee Hooker and John Hammond, and the boogie pianist headlined both the Amsterdam Blues Festival and the Montreal Jazz Festival.\n\nWoods was developing his passion for band leading and discovering the power of being a strong singer. “I’ll always consider myself a piano player, but my voice has developed over the last few years. It’s an incredible release, when you can sing, it’s like blowing an axe, and it’s great to entertain an audience,” he says. Another interest was taking hold, too – the funky piano-driven music of New Orleans. Woods had long been infatuated with the music of the Big Easy. “I’m a boogie woogie and blues piano player for the most part, but I also incorporate other styles within that, like the New Orleans influence. New Orleans R&B piano playing, like Dr. John, of course Professor Longhair. “New Orleans has been a really great source of inspiration, it’s a piano town. New Orleans reveres the piano player. People respect me and I appreciate that. I’ve always been able to feel a real sense of music there; if you’re a good player, you get in. For the past 25 years it has become my second home, ” Woods says. “I’ve gotten to play with all the great players who live there, and I just hire them, guys from Fats Domino’s band, like Red Tyler, sax player, Johnny Vidakovich, drummer with the Professor, and George Porter on bass.\n\nWoods toured constantly in the mid-1990s, stopping long enough to put out Shakin’ the Shack (Blind Pig Records) in 1998. Woodswrote all but one song, demonstrating how well he’s absorbed the conventions of blues and boogie woogie music, further proving his ability to inject new life into these vintage forms. Woods also realized another dream in 1998 when he brought together some of the surviving kings of the American blues legacy, like John Lee Hooker, James Cotton, Johnnie Johnson, Earl King and Lee Allen, to make Keeper Of The Flame (Lightyear/WEA Records), all paired with Woods in a wonderful run of classic tunes.\n\nJump For Joy, Mitch’s fifth release for Blind Pig Records continues Woods’ spin down the boogie road. He had always followed the boogie greats like Louie Jordan and Louie Prima, but Jump For Joy keyed off a new influence. “I started to listen to Cab Calloway, and this new one has lots of Cab influence; six horns, eleven-piece band with doubled horn lines. He (Calloway) had a great entertainment style, very similar to Louie Jordan’s, and that’s what we’ve gone for here,” he says. Woods says Jump For Joy will unite all factions in the dress-up-and-boogie scene. “Aside from the blues audience, we’ve been developing the whole swing crowd, so this will appeal to the swing dancers as well as the blues lovers.” On Jump For Joy, Mitch Woods has gone the limit, writing sassy boogie tunes and crafting smooth arrangements that evoke the heyday of the dancehall Forties.\n\nOn his CD/DVD project, Big Easy Boogie, Mitch brings together the inner circle of Rock’n’ Roll royalty. Featuring some of New Orleans’ legends including original members of the Fats Domino band, Herb Hardesty and the Blue Monday Horns, and Jimmy Moliere on guitar, the sound is true to the roots New Orleans R&B. It is vintage rock’n’roll and boogie inspired by New Orleans piano greats Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, and Little Richard, performed in Mitch’s joyous entertaining style that makes you feel like you are not only in the audience but on stage with him having a ball! Whether it is a pounding piano pumper, a Mardi Gras mambo, or a moody late night blues with cascading piano and sultry sax, Mitch Woods’ Big Easy Boogie will delight all lovers of New Orleans music.\n\nAfter spending more than twenty five years soaking up the New Orleans sound and performing with many of the Crescent City’s musical elite, Mitch has finally realized his dream of recording his latest project with the founding fathers of New Orleans R&B including Earl Palmer, Dave Bartholomew, and Herb Hardesty. Woods reunited the surviving members of Fats Domino’s original band, played a live show in New Orleans during the Jazz & Heritage Festival, took them into the studio, and filmed the whole shebang. The results are plenty of good-time, rock’n’roll boogie, played by the originators of the style, fronted by one of their star pupils. The CD/DVD, Big Easy Boogie is available worldwide on Club 88 Records. It has been garnering airplay on all the major satellite and cable radio stations, including XM (#3 on picks to click-Bluesville), Sirius, Music Choice, as well as BBC 2 and blues programs worldwide.\n\nHere are what the critics are saying about Big Easy Boogie:\n\n“A two-fisted love letter to Fats Domino and Professor Longhair” — Blues Revue\n\n“if it’s legitimate roots and Soul music from N’awlins that’s your passion, step right up for here it is,…by Woods and company.” — Blues Wax\n\n“Mitch Woods’ Big Easy Boogie is a loving tribute to the vintage New Orleans sounds of Fats Domino, Little Richard and Professor Longhair” —Philadelphia Inquirer\n\nIn 2007 Mitch was nominated for Pinetop Perkins Piano Player of the Year Award at the Blues Awards in Memphis. Presented by the Blues Foundation this is one of the highest achievements a blues musician can earn. Mitch continues to tour worldwide with both his Rocket 88’s and Big Easy Boogie. He has performed at some of the world’s most prestigious music festivals and venues, including Jazz A Vienne – France, Umbria Jazz Festival-Italy, San Javier International Jazz Festival – Spain, International Boogie Woogie Festival – Lugano, Switzerland, Lionel Hampton Jazz Club at Le Meridien – Paris, Edmonton Blues Festival – Canada, The Legendary Rhythm & Blues Cruise -2000-2012 , Taiwan Blues Bash – Taiwan, Copenhagen Jazz Festival-Denmark, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and many, many more.\n\nIn 2010 Mitch released Gumbo Blues his tribute to the legendary New Orleans blues shouter Smiley Lewis. Once again he assembled his all-star New Orleans musicians, including members of Dr. John, Fats Domino, Alan Toussaint, and Jon Cleary’s bands. Leading to appearances at The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and many others worldwide as well as another Blues Award nomination and critical acclaim.\n\nIf NOLA isn’t part of your start-up DNA, that can be fixed with a healthy dose of Mitch Woods’ Gumbo Blues. After a listen, you’ll feel as if you’ve visited the Crescent City of the 1950s.\n\nIn October 2010, Mitch embarked with his band the Rocket 88’s on a tour of Turkey with the Efes Blues Festival, playing 26 shows in 20 cities over 5 weeks.\n\n“I was deeply impressed with the warmth and hospitality of the people and their openness and enthusiasm for the American musical form we call “the Blues”. It made me realize that we are musical ambassadors-able to cross cultural, religious, and national borders that most people cannot. In this CD and DVD I document our tour of the Republic of Turkey, a secular nation with 99% Muslim population that straddles the border of east and west, geographically and culturally. On this journey I realized in my heart and soul that music truly crosses all boundaries and Blues is certainly beyond borders.\n\n“Country music hits the heart, and feeds the soul; it’s the story of all our lives in one way or another.” That’s Madelyn Victoria’s perspective on the depth of Country music and just one of many reasons why this talented young vocalist and songwriter from Deep South Texas decided to pursue a career in the Country Music industry.\n\nMadelyn Victoria was born on September 2nd, 1990 in Harlingen, TX, and has literally been influenced by Country music since then. “My obstetrician, Doctor Hughston, had Country music playing throughout the operating room while he delivered me! I think that’s the coolest thing, and one of the many reasons why I love Country music so much.” Her penchant for singing and performing was evident at an early age, with only a brush as a microphone, and coffee table as a stage, Madelyn would perform for her family singing along to George Strait, Alan Jackson, Selena, and more. She then had her first public performance at a San Benito High School Christmas Play when she was only five years old. “I remember feeling nervous but loving it at the same time… the nerves slowly went away with every performance after that… this is what I was born to do.” Eager to continue singing and performing, she entered local talent competitions and pageants in South Texas, earning top awards and gaining recognition throughout her youth.\n\nBand Members:\n\nBrad Vickers: guitar, vocals\n\nMargey Peters: bass, vocals, fiddle\n\nJim Davis: clarinet, saxophone\n\nBill Rankin: drums\n\nSpecial guests Bobby Radcliff, gtr; Arne Englund, piano, gtr; Dave Gross, bass, gtr; Matt Cowan, saxes; V.D.

A great new CD, “Great Day In The Morning\" (2013). joins “Traveling Fool” (2011), “Stuck With The Blues” (2010), and “Le Blues Hot” (2008). All have met with terrific reviews, radio play on 250+ stations (all are still in rotation on Sirius XM Bluesville). Best of all, audiences love them!\n\nBrad comes from the Pine Barrens of Long Island’s rural East End. He is the scion of a musical family\n\nfrom the Pine Barrens of Chintoteague, Virginia,\n\nwhere his grandfather played lap steel and drums.\n\nStay in touch with Brad Vickers & His Vestapolitans at http://www.BradVickers.com\n\nWhat is a Vestapolitan?\n\nWell, you see...\n\nWhen Brad Vickers was looking for a \"V\" name for his group, he chose The Vestapolitans. Here's why:\n\nBack in the 1800s, refined young people were taught, among other skills, \"parlor guitar\". There was one popular piece called \"The Siege of Sebastapol,\" whose title referred to a town that figured in the Crimean war. This instrumental was what was known as a \"character\" or stage bravura piece, with sections meant to emulate sound effects like a bugle call, stirring battle sounds, etc. This kind of piece was learned by advanced students for recitals.\n\nMost importantly, it was played in \"open\" tuning. This tuning caught fire and circulated among players almost at once, and though the piece itself did not become a standard, there must have been enough performances to get the name into circulation. By the 1920s \"Sevastopol\", as it was then spelled, tuning became very popular with players from all walks of life, both chord and slide guitarists. As the years went on, the name got bent into all kinds of shapes, Vestopol, Vestapool, Vastopol, Bestapol, etc. In fact, Bo Diddley said that he first learned guitar in \"Vastabol\" tuning. (Bo favored open E, and would use a capo to vary the key).\n\nVestapol refers to the chord voicing—the relationship between the open strings—not necessarily the key. The most commonly played Vestapol tunings are D Major (where the tuning is: D-A-D-F#-A-D) or E Major (where the tuning is E-B-E-G#-B-E. ) Brad uses both of these tunings."
