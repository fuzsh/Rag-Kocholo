World Premiere Set For Dec. 2 at SIUE’s Metcalf Theater\n\n12/22/09\n\nExec. Committee Awards $965K In Contracts To Rebuild CV Building\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) The Southern Illinois University Board of Trustees Executive Committee has awarded $964,538 in contracts to four Illinois companies and one Missouri company to replace a residential unit in SIU Edwardsville's Cougar Village Apartment Complex. The eight-apartment unit at 529 Cougar Village was gutted by fire in August. The action was taken yesterday by the executive committee under authorization of the full board so that the project may proceed in timely fashion for an August opening. The full board, which will not meet again until February, gave the authorization at its Dec. 10 meeting.\n\nAt that December meeting, the board also noted that the new building will be similar in design but will include updated “green-building” features and other enhancements. In addition, the new building will have updated building code specifications, including a new alarm system and automatic fire sprinklers. In addition to current code requirements, the system connects to the campus central monitoring system, including the attic space which is beyond building code requirements.University officials have noted the project will be funded through insurance proceeds, the SIU self-insurance program, housing revenues and the University’s Repair and Replacement Reserve Fund.\n\nThe companies awarded the contracts are:\n\nL. Wolf Co. of Granite City, $605,100, for general contracting;\n\nGuarantee Electric Construction Co., St. Louis, $149,893, for electrical work;\n\nSuperior Fire Protection Systems, Forsyth, $64,370, for fire alarm system;\n\nEhret Inc., Belleville, $72,275, plumbing; and\n\nHock Mechanical, Millstadt, $72,900, ventilation system.\n\nAccording to Edwardsville Fire Chief Brian Wilson Jr., the fire was caused by a lightning strike. The 32 students who were scheduled to live in the unit this past fall semester were re-assigned to other space in the apartment complex. Two students already moved into an apartment in the building escaped injury largely thanks to SIUE Police Officer Dan Murphy who spotted the fire and pounded on front doors to roust anyone who may have been inside. Wilson concluded lightning caused the fire because of burn patterns and other evidence indicating the blaze started in the attic. It was also noted that there was no evidence of cooking in the building at the time nor was there evidence of combustibles.\n\nBack to top\n\n12/18/09\n\nBench Placed In SIUE Gardens Honors Nursing Professor Emeritus\n\nProfessor Emeritus Mary Ann Boyd, a member of the SIUE Nursing faculty for 32 years, was the recipient of a bench recently named in her honor in The Gardens at SIUE. The bench, located along the path of the Shade Stroll Garden, is a serene spot to enjoy the plants and trees throughout the seasons. “A gift from Assistant Deans Mary Mulcahy and Jacquelyn Clement,” said Nursing Dean Marcia Maurer, “the bench commemorates Dr. Boyd’s years as a nurse educator at SIUE.” Boyd hosted a reception after the dedication and was “clearly moved and delighted by this special recognition,” Maurer said. “The spot is in one of her favorite places on campus.”\n\nSee the photo of Assistant Dean Mulcahy and Professor Emeritus Boyd enjoying the bench.

Aldemaro Romero Jr., who was named dean of the College of Arts and Sciences earlier this year at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, recently donated his personal papers to SIUE’s Elijah P. Lovejoy Memorial Library. The collection contains thousands of scientific journal articles, various writings, photographic slides, audio tapes and source documents—some of which date back to the 16th Century—from the many fields of biology and oceanography. “As a person who has used archives from many libraries in many countries, I know that documentation makes a difference in the nature of the modern library,” Romero said.\n\nThe entire collection consists of more than 50,000 items, collected individually over a lifetime of research, spanning some four decades. “As far as I am aware, this is the most comprehensive collection of printed material on cave biology and the largest private collection of marine mammal documentation,” Romero said. The collection also contains Romero’s personal archive of the saga of his journeys from around the world.\n\nRegina McBride, dean of library and information services at SIUE, said, “the collection is a great resource to SIUE students and faculty conducting research in the fields of biology, marine biology, political science and cultural history. The collection is part of what makes Lovejoy Library unique and we are very grateful for Dean Romero’s support.” Romero said he believes giving his collection to SIUE demonstrates his commitment to SIUE as an excellent academic institution and that he hopes the gesture encourages “other scholars to leave their academic legacies for future generations.”\n\nA native of Caracas, Venezuela, Romero earned a bachelor’s in biology (zoology emphasis) at the University of Barcelona, Spain, in 1977. He continued his work as a science writer in both Spain and Venezuela and, in 1981, became a graduate student in biology at the University of Miami, Florida, where he studied the evolutionary biology of cave fishes. Romero went on to work as the Venezuela program director of The Nature Conservancy in Washington, D.C., and in 1986 founded The Venezuelan Foundation for the Conservation of Biodiversity (BIOMA) with headquarters in Caracas. He became an associate professor and director of the Environmental Studies Program at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn., where he continued his teaching and research in the areas of cave fish behavior and the environmental history of marine mammals.\n\nSince 2003, Romero has been professor of biological sciences and chair of that department at Arkansas State University. He created a host of new courses in the areas of biospeleology, marine mammals, history and philosophy of science, science in the cinema and science communication. Throughout his career, Romero published more than 560 pieces including numerous books, peer-reviewed publications and monographs on a wide variety of subjects including cave biology, marine mammals, paleontology, environmental studies, and history and philosophy of science. He has produced, written, and, in many cases, directed and hosted about 1,500 radio broadcasts and 50 television shows, including award-winning nature documentaries.\n\nBack to top\n\n12/15/09\n\nGovernor Releases $52.5 Million For SIUE Science Building Construction\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) Construction on the new Science Building at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville is expected to begin this month or January, according to top University administrators. Less than two weeks after an official groundbreaking ceremony at SIUE to mark the construction of a new Science Building, Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn released $52.5 million in funding from the state’s capital construction bill. The total estimated cost for the project, which includes renovation of the existing science building, is $78.9 million.\n\n\"The contract has been awarded for the site work, a pre-construction meeting was last week and we can break ground with bulldozers this month or early January,\" said Kenn Neher, SIUE vice chancellor for administration. The bill, approved earlier this year, calls for a total of $168.1 million in capital funding for the SIU system, which includes the Edwardsville, Alton, Carbondale and Springfield campuses. The Edwardsville project is part of the Illinois Jobs Now bill, a statewide package signed by the governor and projected to be worth about $31 billion.\n\nNeher said the projected move-in date on the Science Building will be around November 2011. Funds are available from the state’s sale of bonds that are restricted only for the purpose of approved capital funding projects. “The University is extremely pleased,” Neher said. “We have been working on this for more than 10 years and it will mean a tremendous amount for the growth of the University, the economic development of Southwestern Illinois, and the training and education of a highly qualified workforce for Southern Illinois.\"\n\nAccording to SIUE Provost Paul Ferguson, “this timely construction of the SIUE Science Building will provide essential classrooms, laboratories and equipment to support the contemporary research of our basic sciences faculty and students, as well as to provide state-of-the-art learning environments for the many students in our rapidly growing science and health science programs. This facility will greatly further our commitment to increasing the number of health care professionals in response to significant manpower shortages and will enhance the national recognition of academic excellence at SIUE,” Ferguson said.\n\n“Overcrowding in current labs, as well as antiquated equipment, has led to faculty teaching laboratory classes seven days per week,” said SIUE Chancellor Vaughn Vandegrift during a Dec. 2 groundbreaking ceremony. “The lack of a new science building has been the single most important factor limiting future growth at SIUE. We can now properly address that. We are thankful for the support of the Governor, our local legislative delegation, the labor and business community, SIU President (Glenn) Poshard and all those who have enabled this day.” SIUE is home to programs in dental medicine, nursing, pharmacy and the sciences.\n\nBack to top\n\n12/14/09\n\nFOTAD Trivia Night Jan. 16 Means Fun, Food And Door Prizes\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.)

The Southern Illinois University Board of Trustees today gave authorization to the board’s executive committee to award contracts for replacing an SIUE Cougar Village apartment building that was destroyed by fire in August. The loss was estimated at $1.6 million and the full board gave approval for the project and budget at its September meeting. The board gave the executive committee authorization today at its regular meeting on the campus of SIU Carbondale. The board’s next full meeting won’t occur until February. The authorization was given so that the project will move along in timely fashion for the new building’s expected fall 2010 opening.\n\nAccording to Edwardsville Fire Chief Brian Wilson Jr., the fire that gutted the eight-unit residential building at 529 Cougar Village was caused by a lightning strike. The 32 students who were scheduled to live in the unit this fall semester were re-assigned to other space in the apartment complex.

As a result, the grant will be used to provide backpacks, books, writing supplies, water bottles, and tutoring to the student population at the Detention Center. “This has been a multiple year project started by Past-President Angela Thole,” said Curriculum and Instruction Professor Randall Smith, adviser to the organization. “Now, it has been brought to fruition with the help of current President Andrea Reiser.”\n\nBack to top\n\n12/3/09\n\nGov. Quinn selects SIU President Glenn Poshard to serve on new statewide educational coordinating council\n\n(SPRINGFIELD, Ill.) Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn has appointed Southern Illinois University President Glenn Poshard to the P-20 Council, a key statewide advisory panel that will make recommendations to the Governor about strengthening the state’s education system. The P-20 (pre-school through graduate school) Council will play an instrumental role in Illinois’ quest to win approximately $400 million in federal “Race to the Top” discretionary funds. Poshard, who will serve as the Council’s public university representative, was among 23 members appointed to the group Monday by the Governor.\n\n“I am honored to accept the Governor’s request to serve on The P-20 Council,” Poshard said. “This is a tremendous opportunity for the state’s entire educational system to come together and make fundamental and lasting improvements on behalf of our children.” The Council will study and review education programs at all levels—from early childhood to graduate programs. The Council also is charged with finding ways to improve teaching and learning; to assure readiness and smooth transitions for students at each level of their education; and to cultivate and demonstrate accountability and efficiency in all school programs from pre-school to college.\n\n“With these appointments, Illinois is sending a strong signal to Washington that a top-notch education for all students is a foremost priority,” said Gov. Quinn. “This council will recommend improvements that will make our education system the best it can be, while ensuring Illinois is at the head of the class when it comes to winning those important federal ‘Race to the Top’ funds.”\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education “Race to the Top” is a $4.35 billion competitive grant process focused on innovative approaches to education. Illinois could receive approximately $400 million in discretionary funds made available through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The 23 appointments made by the Governor include business leaders, teachers, parents and civic groups, as well as university, community college and school officials. There are four legislative members on the council and six ex-officio members from state agencies. Gov. Quinn’s appointments to the Illinois P-20 Council include:\n\nMiguel del Valle, Chair Glenn Poshard John Luczak John Rico Joshua Anderson Ray Hancock Dea Meyer Kathy Ryg Perry Buckley Ron Huberman Fr.

Illinois Gov. Patrick Quinn, flanked by SIU administrators, lawmakers and developers turned dirt during a groundbreaking ceremony, ushering in the building phase of the new Science Building Complex on the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville campus.\n\nFor more than a decade, SIUE has planned and offered annual presentations to the state legislature in support of a new facility, as well as revisions to the existing Science Building. Last year, the University was promised $78.9 million from the Illinois General Assembly, as part of the Illinois Jobs Now bill, which is a statewide package signed by the governor and projected to be worth about $31 billion.\n\nThe SIU system, which includes the Edwardsville, Alton, Carbondale and Springfield campuses, is set to receive a total of $168.1 million in capital funding from the state.\n\n\"SIUE has grown up and it continues to grow and thrive,\" said SIU President Glenn Poshard. \"This project is the latest and greatest example of how far this institution has come and the potential for its future growth and success.\n\n\"These improvements, and the new building, are critical to alleviate overcrowding and replace antiquated lab equipment and materials.\"\n\nOvercrowding in current labs, as well as antiquated equipment, have led to faculty teaching laboratory classes seven days per week, said SIUE Chancellor Vaughn Vandegrift, adding: \"Following a decade of significant growth and demonstrated need, today marks a turning point in the life of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. We are thrilled to break ground on the Science Building complex, a much-needed facility that will allow us to meet the academic demands of our current students.\n\n\"The lack of a new science building has been the single most important factor limiting future growth of SIUE. We can now properly address that. We are thankful for the support of the Governor, our local legislative delegation, the labor and business community, President Poshard and all those who have enabled this day.\"\n\nLocal labor leaders and legislatures turned out to participate in the ceremony, along with a large showing of support from SIUE faculty, staff and students.\n\nAccording to SIUE Provost Paul Ferguson, \"This timely construction of the SIUE Science Building will provide essential classrooms, laboratories, and equipment to support the contemporary research of our basic sciences faculty and students as well as to provide state-of-the-art learning environments for the many students in our rapidly growing science and health science programs.\"\n\n\"This facility will greatly further our commitment to increasing the number of health care professionals in response to significant manpower shortages and will enhance the national recognition of academic excellence at SIUE.\"\n\nThe new building and renovations will allow SIUE to more readily meet national needs, concerning projected shortages in the hundreds of thousands in health care fields by 2020. SIUE is home to the schools of Nursing and Pharmacy, and science programs through the College of Arts and Sciences, as well as the SIU School of Dental Medicine in Alton.\n\nBack to top\n\n12/1/09\n\nWhammy!! World Premiere Set For Dec. 2 at SIUE's Metcalf Theater\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) The world premiere of Whammy!!: The Seven Secrets to a Sane Self , a play written and directed by Chuck Harper, is set for 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, Dec. 2, at the James F. Metcalf Theater at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. Harper, a professor of theater and dance at SIUE and head of the performance area in the department, said the play explores America’s obsession with, and addiction to, self-help and self-actualization.\n\n“Whammy! began with a question: What would happen if you took the idea of ‘self-help,’ and the industry that surrounds it, smashed it together with Stanley Kubrick’s 1964 comic film, It’s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, and then looked at this smashup through the lens of a dream? Over the course of my research I ended up with two questions: 1) “How is it that the most affluent and comfortable society in the history of the western world can produce so many profoundly unhappy or unsatisfied people?” and 2) As Walker Percy asks in his book, Lost in the Cosmos: The Last Self-Help Book, ‘Why is it possible to learn more about the Crab Nebula, which is 6,000 light years away, than you presently know about yourself even though you’ve been stuck with yourself all your life?’”\n\nThe play has been called a “montage-based original performance that combines video, movement, found text and original text, as well as real-time audience ‘happiness’ quizzes.” Harper explained that the play went through developmental workshops in St. Louis over the course of two weeks. “The original two questions posed were discussed and several of the movement sections were created by me and collaborator Mikey Butane,” he said. “In September, rehearsals started with the SIUE cast, and we all began keeping dream journals. As an ensemble we wove these dream images together with the elements of song, dance, and text, through structured improvisation, into the thing audiences will see on stage here—play? dance? performance?”\n\nWhammy! will continue at 7:30 p.m. Thursday-Saturday, Dec. 3-5, and Friday-Saturday, Dec. 11-12, as well as 2 p.m. Sunday, Dec. 6 and 13. Tickets are $10 for adults, and $8 for senior citizens, non-SIUE students with a valid student I.D, and SIUE faculty, staff and alumni. All SIUE students with a valid I.D. are free thanks to the Campus Activities Board.

The one thing that keeps Drew Foster up at night is the fear that he will become 40 without having at least tried to attain his dream of owning a business. So, the Cox Scholarship winner from the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville School of Business has been working to ensure sweet dreams for himself and he’s a step closer by winning the “30 Minutes with an Entrepreneurial Hero” national competition.\n\nThe economics and finance major had planned a career in corporate law. “I came to SIUE on a Meridian Scholarship, and since then I’ve received the Cox Scholarship from the School of Business, all of which has allowed me to save some money, with the idea of going to law school,” Foster said. “My plan was always to go to law school, but I recently attended the national Collegiate Entreprenuers (CEO) Conference where I heard someone say: ’Don't let your biggest fear be looking back at the ‘me’ I could have been.’ I began to think about myself practicing law years from now, working in torts or contracts, and I would look back and regret not taking the plunge to start my own business, becoming an entrepreneur.”\n\nFoster now has traded his plan for a juris doctor with a plan to earn an MBA. “One of the business ideas I’d been considering was a bike share program at SIUE such as they have in Europe,” Foster explained. “But I decided that would be too costly right now.” A shared bicycling program would involve a large outlay of expense to provide free bicycles for the entire campus. So, Foster has put that on hold.\n\nAfter Foster received the Cox Scholarship, he learned of the SIUE CEO Club, which has been dormant for a few years. “I decided to start it up again,” he said, “and in response we received 100 applications to join the first year. Now that we have a core following again, we’re planning some projects, trying to build up the group to more than it had been in the past.” Foster said the club is planning speed networking sessions and lunch with a CEO. “Another of the plans we’ve discussed—‘Project eBetterment’—involves coming up with a business idea, an innovation to make the University even better.”\n\nReturning to the subject of the CEO competition, Foster said he interviewed Theresa Willams who runs the Blessing Basket Project, an organization dedicated to reducing poverty “in developing countries by paying Prosperity Wages® for artisan products,” according to the project’s Web site. The Web site goes on to state: “This unique financial model creates a cycle of entrepreneur driven growth resulting in permanent financial independence for the artisan.”\n\n“I wrote an essay about Theresa and the project and submitted it to the national CEO competition; in about two weeks I was notified I had won the $1,000 first-place prize.” As a gesture of giving back, Foster said he is working hard with the revived CEO Club at SIUE to make it a vital organization again. “I wanted to give back in some way; my plan for the CEO Club is to become a foundation for youth entrepreneurship in the Midwest, to literally inspire, to innovate and to give youth the idea they can forge their own future, that they can break away from the usual path and they can be their own boss,” Foster said. “It all furthers the idea that as an entrepreneur we take that risk, take that plunge. I want to do that by actually starting new businesses through the CEO Club with the help of the 42 core members we have now.\"\n\nFoster said the CEO Club contains members across a wide spectrum of majors, not just business. “We have about 30 percent business majors but also artists, musicians and others. I want to see this blossom into something amazing for the students and for the University,” he said. “My dream is to return in 10 years and find that perhaps 20 of those members have started their own businesses. I’m excited about the possibilities.”\n\nBack to top\n\n11/25/09\n\nSIUE Extends Alternative Tuition Rates To Eastern Missouri Students\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) Southern Illinois University Edwardsville Chancellor Vaughn Vandegrift has announced the University’s alternative tuition program for the 2010-11 academic year-for high-achieving and talented students in nine Eastern Missouri counties as well as the city of St. Louis. In 2008, the SIU Board of Trustees established a geographic enhancement award program at SIUE that provides an alternative tuition rate for qualified students. Today’s announcement focuses on qualified students from Eastern Missouri counties, including St. Louis, Franklin, Jefferson, Lincoln, St. Charles, St. Francois, Ste. Genevieve, Warren and Washington.\n\nUnder the new guidelines, a typical Eastern Missouri scholar who declares Illinois residency during sophomore year could save $33,000 over four years. During freshman year at SIUE, a student must live on campus to qualify for the discretionary tuition rate—1.2 times the current in-state (Illinois) rate. They also must file a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Scott Belobrajdic, assistant vice chancellor for enrollment management, said the first-year tuition for these students under the program will be much lower than the usual out-of-state rate. “They will receive what will amount to an $8,000 scholarship during their freshman year,” Belobrajdic said. “And, if they elect to follow the simple process for establishing Illinois residency during that first year, their tuition will drop to in-state (Illinois) rates for years two, three and four; hence, the savings of some $33,000.\n\n“We are offering this special rate to qualified admitted students with a 23 composite ACT score or higher.”\n\nThe program, according to Belobrajdic, promotes geographical access and a campus climate of academic excellence to the benefit of all SIUE students. “As a premier metropolitan University, this program allows SIUE to compete for the best students in the region,” he said. “It helps us maintain our growing reputation as we offer our quality academic program to a wider audience.”\n\nTwo high school counselors from Missouri said they agreed the program gives students more option for making important decisions about future academic pursuits. “I have a good number of students applying every year,” says Julie Kampschroeder from Pattonville High School, “however, the current out-of-state tuition prohibits my students from attending SIUE. I am thrilled our students with a 23 ACT or better, who apply by early December, will have the opportunity to attend SIUE at the in-state cost. Our district is only 35 minutes from Edwardsville and now my students have another great financial option and wonderful majors to choose from so close to home.”\n\nBeth Brasel, at Lafayette High School in St. Louis County, said she’s excited by the news that Missouri students have a chance to consider SIUE. “With the increasing cost of higher education and the current economy, this allows students opportunities to pursue an education at a fine institution close to home and at a reasonable cost.”\n\nBelobrajdic pointed out that a completed application must be received electronically by Dec. 11, or must be mailed and postmarked by that date to qualify for the award program.\n\nBack to top\n\n11/25/09\n\nChanges\n\nPersonnel\n\nDouglas Bock, a professor of CMIS, was named chair of that department Aug. 16.\n\nRyan Downey, a counselor in the Office of Admissions, was named assistant director of admissions July 13\n\nTammy Dugan joined the University Oct. 19 as assistant director of employer relations in the Career Development Center\n\nSusan Dustin joined the University Aug. 16 as an assistant professor of management and marketing\n\nEileen Harrison joined the University July 20 as an academic advisor in the School of Engineering\n\nChrista Hopp joined the University July 1 as an assistant professor of restorative dentistry\n\nDiane Hudson, assistant professor of library and information services, left the University Aug. 31\n\nKimberly Hurley, assistant professor of kinesiology and health education, left the University Aug. 15 to accept a position elsewhere\n\nBarbara Levergood joined the University Sept. 16 as an associate professor of library and information services\n\nJohn McLaughlin joined the University Sept. 14 as an admission counselor\n\nGregory Sierra joined the University Aug. 16 as an assistant professor of accounting\n\nDianne Kay Slattery, professor of construction, left the University Aug. 15 to accept a position elsewhere\n\nKerry Slattery, associate professor of construction, left the University Aug. 15 to accept a position elsewhere\n\nEboni Thompson joined the University Sept. 8 as an admission counselor\n\nGregory Vogel joined the University Aug. 16 as an assistant professor of anthropology\n\nGina Williams joined the University Sept. 1 as an admissions coordinator\n\nOther new faculty may be found at www.siue.edu/news/archives/ArchivesSEP2009.shtml#NewFac\n\nRetirements\n\nPeter Bukalski, professor of theater and dance, effective July 31, after more than 15 years of service\n\nBack to top\n\n11/18/09\n\nSIUE Constructors Club Not ‘Playing Around’ But Building For Future\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) The Southern Illinois University Edwardsville Constructors Club, made up of construction management majors from the SIUE School of Engineering, has been resurrected to do what they do best—construct. And, the newly revived club recently finished its first project—constructing a playground for the village of Summerfield, near Lebanon.\n\nNick Heinz, the newest president of the student organization, decided the club had been dormant long enough. “I felt we needed to become more involved in the community,” Heinz said. Heinz heard from Assistant Professor Chris Gordon, chair of the Department of Construction, Summerfield officials had purchased playground equipment for its park and needed help with construction of the playground. “Professor Gordon suggested it would be a great project for us and we decided to take it on,” Heinz said. He said the playground equipment was placed in a 40-foot by 40-foot area in the city’s park. “The playground equipment consists of large plastic and metal pieces—slides and walkways. “It was a large project but it went up pretty quickly,” Heinz said. “I was surprised it went so quickly but we started on Friday and had it done the following Sunday.”\n\nIt’s been estimated that the city would have had to pay a contractor some $10,000 to get the job done. “It was not an easy job, by any means,” Heinz said. “The spec book itself was about an inch thick.” Heinz explained that one of the student’s father owns an excavation company in Aviston. “Matt Marcus’ father owns Markus Backhoe & Trenching Service and he himself works for his Dad. So, Matt already has all the excavating skills. Without Matt and his father’s generosity, we would not have succeeded on this project.”\n\nHeinz said they had enough volunteers who put in a total of about 300 hours to get the job done quickly. “We first had to survey the area,” Heinz pointed out. “We then drilled 34 concrete footings (foundations) and assembled the playground pieces, setting anchoring pieces in the foundation holes. After that we poured the concrete. The project was in large part preplanned and managed by senior Garth Hand,” Heinz pointed out, “who coordinated the logistics of bringing volunteers to the site, matching volunteers to tasks and troubleshooting the installation process.”\n\nOnce the project was finished, city inspectors looked over the work and pronounced it rock solid and safe, Heinz said. “We had to have it inspected by the village and it passed with flying colors.” According to Melissa Stoltz, who acted as a liaison with the mayor’s office, the playground was already in use and is being enjoyed by residents.\n\nIn addition to looking for more construction projects, Heinz is trying to bring speakers to campus who are in the construction trade to help students better learn about the industry. “I’m also looking at the club helping with a Habitat for Humanity project in Glen Carbon behind the Wal-Mart,” he said. “With Dr. Gordon’s help, we’ve gotten the group going again,” Heinz said. “We had elections in the spring and, in addition to me, the current officers are: Vice President Tyler Doughty, Secretary Garth Hand and Treasurer Dan Einhorn.” Heinz will graduate soon with a degree in construction management and a minor in business administration but is returning next year to SIUE to begin MBA studies in the SIUE School of Business. “My career plan is to be skilled in construction and grounded with a solid business education to one day own my own company.”\n\nClick here for a photo suitable for print.

Stephen Garland, a senior English education major from Centralia, recently received the Student Laureate Award for Southern Illinois University Edwardsville from the Lincoln Academy of Illinois.\n\nEach year, the Lincoln Academy honors outstanding seniors representing the values and virtues of America's 16th president, Abraham Lincoln. The state's four-year degree-granting colleges and universities each select a single recipient to represent institutions annually. As SIUE's current recipient, Garland received a medallion and a certificate from the Lincoln Academy during a special ceremony at the Old State Capitol in Springfield. He also had lunch at the Executive Mansion and the opportunity to mingle with state legislators and Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn.\n\n\"When I learned that I had been selected, I was excited because I doubt I will be afforded many other opportunities to have lunch with the Governor of Illinois,\" he said.\n\nGarland looks at the award as a chance to be recognized throughout the state for his achievements. He said he is honored to have been chosen for the Lincoln Laureate Award, and proud of his academic and extra-curricular work while at SIUE.\n\n\"My key to success has probably been my sociability,\" Garland said. \"I looked forward to every first day of class because I got to make new friends who could help me on a paper or meet me for coffee when I was stressed out over a tiny detail.\"\n\nGarland also was the recipient of SIUE's Emergent Student Leader Award in spring 2009 and the Student Volunteer of the Year Award in 2008.\n\nCurrently a student teacher in the Alton School District, Garland expects to graduate in May 2010. He will have endorsements to teach speech communication and mathematics at the high school and middle-school levels.\n\n\"English teaching jobs are not the easiest to find and, hopefully, my Lincoln Laureate status will give me another positive edge,\" he said.\n\nClick here for a photo of Stephen J.

Set to perform in Meridian Ballroom, on the first floor of SIUE’s Morris University Center, the 7:30 p.m. concert is part of the Arts & Issues 25th Anniversary Season.\n\n“Mark Holland is one of the top Native American flute players in the country and we are thrilled to have him here at SIUE,” said Grant Andree, coordinator of the Arts & Issues series. “This is also a one-time event in that we are bringing in seven additional outstanding musicians to perform with Mark.” The instrumentation will include cello, piano, guitar, percussion, harp and tabla. “We are honored to have such beautiful music be a part of our series,” Andree said. “It complements the many styles of music we’ve highlighted over the past 25 years.” Autumn’s Child also will be joined for the Nov. 18 concert by Lowery Begay, noted Native American hoop dancer.\n\nHolland, who tours solo and with St. Louisan Peter Mayer’s Stars and Promises concert series, also appears on tour with members of Autumn’s Child, some of whom have performed with Sheryl Crow, Paul Winter (as in the Paul Winter Consort) and the late John Cage. Considered by musical aficionados of the Native American flute to be among the top flutists performing and recording today, Holland’s unique musical approach, along with his technical skills, have attracted a strong following. Known for his unique style of “playing from the heart,” Holland has been a featured performer at three international Native American Flute Association conventions and also has performed at music festivals from Michigan to New Mexico.\n\nHe has recorded tracks for a future PBS documentary, “Redemption Road,” and has appeared as a guest performer on the album Horsepower by Capitol recording artist Chris Ledoux. Holland also has recorded his own albums, many of which have been nominated for the Indian Summer Music Awards, the Native American Music Awards and the Just Plain Folks Music Awards, to name a few. In addition, music by Autumn’s Child has been featured on NPR, PRI, JPR and various satellite radio stations as well as various community and internet stations.\n\nTickets for Mark Holland and Autumn’s Child are $27; SIUE students, $13; SIUE employees and retirees, as well as all senior citizens, $25. Ticket information, subscription rates and ticket sales are available on the Web site: artsandissues.com, or by calling (618) 650-5774. In addition, an Arts & Issues season brochure is available at several locations throughout the Edwardsville-Glen Carbon area, or by calling (618) 650-5194.\n\nMost of the 2009-10 Arts & Issues photos suitable for print are available at www.siue.edu/artsandissues/PhotoIndex.shtml.\n\nOther appearances during the milestone season will include:\n\nCarpe Diem Quartet and Peter Soave—“The Music of Aldemaro Romero”\n\nSaturday, Jan. 30, 2010, 7:30 p.m., Dunham Hall Theater (LIMITED SEATING)\n\nThe Grammy Award-nominated Carpe Diem String Quartet, a musical group that has captured the imagination of audiences around the world, and internationally acclaimed bandoneon and concert accordionist Peter Soave will perform the music of the late Aldemaro Romero, who was an international recording star with RCA Victor and one of the foremost Latin music orchestra leaders in the world.\n\nSteve Squyres-“Roving Mars: Spirit, Opportunity and the Exploration of the Red Planet”\n\nWednesday, February 17, 2010, 7:30 p.m., Meridian Ballroom\n\nSponsored by the Shaw Memorial Fund\n\n“Spirit and Opportunity” have always been prominent in the life of Steve Squyres, best known as the face and voice of NASA’s mission to Mars including the pioneering and spectacular drive across the Red Planet’s surface by two high-tech robotic rovers. He will detail to the Arts & Issues audience how he turned what seemed like an improbable dream into a successful $800 million reality.\n\nBack to top\n\n11/4/09\n\nDance In Concert Nov. 11-15 At SIUE; From Paris To America\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) Multi-colored lighting, silk fabric and the music of Chopin are contributing elements to the excitement that is Dance In Concert 2009, from Nov. 11-15 in the theater at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville’s Dunham Hall. J. Calvin Jarrell’s piece, Letters from Versailles, will be one of several exciting dances in the concert. Jarrell, who is the dance director for the SIUE Department of Theater and Dance, pointed out that Versailles actually made its debut during Dance In Concert 2006. Jarrell also is artistic director for the upcoming concert.\n\nAnother portion of the concert will feature Native American Gerard Tsonakwa, of the Abenaki tribe and a native of Quebec. He is a featured guest choreographer who will present a multimedia dance piece. It all comes together during DIC ’09, set for 7:30 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday, Nov. 11-14, and at 2 p.m. Sunday, Nov. 15. Tsonakwa, former executive director of the United American Indians Administration in Philadelphia, is well known for his storytelling abilities and his piece, Maheo: An Abenaki Creation Story, is a good example of his specialty. He has since turned his focus to storytelling and creating award-winning art in stone, and bone and wood inspired by the legends of his tribe and others. His dance piece is from a cycle of Abenaki stories dating from approximately 900 CE.\n\nTsonakwa currently is director of the Plumer School of Arts and Sciences in Tucson, and as an artist and author has had more than 100 feature exhibitions in museums and galleries, including a guest curatorship at the San Diego Museum of Man. He also has written five books and 12 audio productions and has been heavily involved with the Arizona Sonora Desert Museum in Tucson.\n\nLetters is Jarrell's homage to the legendary palace that King Louis XIII built outside Paris in the 17th Century as a hunting lodge and private retreat. But it was his successor, Louis XIV, who transformed it into an immense and extravagant palace complex surrounded by beautiful gardens, ornate fountains, and artwork in the interior to rival the Vatican, all glorifying the king. Jarrell visited the palace in 2005 and was inspired by its majesty. Using a great swath of blue silk to accentuate the dancers, Jarrell has them striking poses reminiscent of the beautiful statuary dotting the grounds of the palace.\n\nOther dances in the mid-November concert include pieces by Associate Professor Kerry Shaul and other guest artists. In addition, dance alumna Emily Taul will feature her choreography in a piece that won the award for best dance this past spring in Student Dance Concert 2009. Another dance alum, who is now a full-time instructor in the department, has contributed to the concert with a piece about dreams. Kristin Best, who danced in several dance concerts at SIUE when she was a student, has been teaching at Lindenwood University since she graduated from SIUE in 2003. “My piece, Flash, is a dance based on dreams I've had,” Best said. “Actually, it’s about the people I’ve seen in those dreams. For awhile there, I was always meeting people I knew in my dreams. So, I decided to create a piece that reflects that.”\n\nTickets are $10 for general audiences; non-SIUE students, senior citizens, SIUE faculty and staff, $8; SIUE students with valid ID, no admission charge, and are available through the SIUE Fine Arts box office, (618) 650-2774.\n\nClick here for a photo suitable for print.

The Southern Illinois University Edwardsville School of Pharmacy has been awarded—along with the Saint Louis University Department of Pharmacology and Physiology—a $974,024 National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant to study ways of relieving chronic pain through new approaches in treating neuroinflammation. Funding for the NIH grant was made possible in part by federal stimulus funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\n\nWilliam Neumann, an assistant professor of medicinal chemistry in the SIUE School of Pharmacy, and Professor Daniela Salvemini, an associate professor of pharmacological and physiological science at the SLU School of Medicine, are the project’s principal researchers who will be studying how “peroxynitrite” (produced in the body in inflammatory settings) can actually cause chronic pain when the body produces too much of the chemical. Studies have shown chronic pain is a global problem but in the United States alone one third of Americans suffer from it. However, about 30 percent of those chronic pain sufferers report that drugs now available on the market do not help the problem.\n\n“When you have inflammation in the body,” Neumann explained, “reactive oxygen species and free radicals are produced, which can lead to formation of the neurotoxic molecule, peroxynitrite. Normally, these reactive molecules are kept under tight wraps by the body’s own antioxidant defense systems. “But, if these systems become compromised, as in a state of chronic pain, it actually can make the problem worse. We’ll be looking at creating a synthetic enzyme that will go in and destroy the peroxynitrite.”\n\nOver the past decade, Salvemini’s pioneering research led to the discovery of peroxynitrite. “We discovered the substance ... which turns out to be very important in the development of pain and inflammation. If we target that molecule, we hope we can find new therapies with fewer side effects,” said Salvemini. “Currently, pain is often poorly managed. Our hope is to find better ways to eliminate human suffering.” The two-year grant is being administered through the NIH’s National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal And Skin Diseases.\n\n“By using various accepted lab methods, we will try to create in rats arthritic conditions and see how they react to the pharmacology we introduce,” Neumann said. “The broad potential therapeutic use of these new analgesic agents we’re proposing is not a part of current pain management drugs,” he said. “Our team will draw upon previous breakthroughs in the development of free radical targeted therapies but we will go further in creating a new approach to combat the problem without some of the current side effects of current pain management drugs.”\n\nWilliam Neumann received a bachelor of science in Chemistry from the University of Missouri at Columbia in 1983 and a doctorate in 1987 from UM-St. Louis, where he worked on synthetic methodologies directed at preparing antitumor cyclopentanoid natural products. Since then, he has conducted research in both the diagnostic imaging and therapeutic pharmaceutical industries. Prior to joining the SIUE School of Pharmacy he spent the majority of his industrial career at Monsanto corporate research and later Pharmacia, leading the new synthetic methods group. He also is currently adjunct professor in the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Saint Louis University. Professor Neumann’s research interests are structure based drug discovery and catalytic antioxidants. At SIUE, he teaches biochemistry and integrated pharmacotherapeutics: GI/rheumatology/pulmonary-medicinal chemistry.\n\nDaniela Salvemini received her BSc in pharmacology in 1987 from King’s College London and her doctorate in pharmacology in 1990 at the William Harvey Research Institute, University College in London. After four years of post-doctoral fellowship, Salvemini joined the private sector where she spent more than a decade working on drug discovery and development of novel anti-inflammatories and analgesics. She came to Saint Louis University in 2005. Salvemini’s research achievements are reflected in numerous peer-reviewed publications, reviews and lectures in the field of pain and inflammation, and several international awards including the prestigious Novartis Award in pharmacology.\n\nBack to top\n\n11/2/09\n\nIDHR Makes First Stop At SIUE To Highlight Sexual Harassment Law\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) Illinois Department of Human Rights Director Rocco Claps visited the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville campus this morning, making his first stop in the state to highlight a law that protects students from sexual harassment.\n\nAbout 25 staff, faculty and students turned out for the director's visit to find out more about legislation that Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn Governor signed into public act on Aug. 18.\n\nClaps discussed a new measure that requires universities and institutions of higher learning to display posters explaining sexual harassment laws and policies in prominent and accessible areas for all students. The notice explains what sexual harassment is and what students can do about it. The Director was joined by Paul Pitts, assistant chancellor for Institutional Compliance at SIUE in the Morris University Center Meridian Ballroom pre-function area.\n\n\"Students have the right to learn in an environment that is free of sexual harassment,\" Claps said. \"Our goal is to ensure students are aware that sexual harassment is never OK and there is a law that protects them.\n\n\"I thank SIUE for allowing us the opportunity and assisting us in our outreach efforts.\"\n\nThe amendment to the Illinois Human Rights Act calls for colleges, universities and institutions of higher learning to display posters in common areas including, such as residence halls, administration buildings, student unions, cafeterias and libraries. College campuses can also satisfy the posting requirement by providing each student an electronic copy of the sexual harassment laws and policies at the time that registration materials are emailed.\n\nIllinois higher education institutions affected by this law must be in compliance on or prior to Nov. 17, 2009.\n\n\"I would like to welcome Director Claps to SIUE as he announces this new important law,\" Pitts said. \"In addition to the work we do here at SIUE to assure a harmonious campus climate of tolerance throughout the entire University Community, this amendment provides our students an additional source of information for understanding their rights under law.\"\n\nFor questions about protections against sexual harassment in higher education and to see all required postings visit the Department's website at www.state.il.us/dhr or call 217-785-5100.\n\nBack to top\n\n11/2/09\n\nSIUE To Host Second Preview For College-Bound Students, Parents\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill) PREVIEW SIUE, an opportunity for prospective students and their families to see the beauty of the campus, visit with faculty and staff and obtain answers to their questions in one visit to campus, will be conducted Veterans Day, Wednesday, Nov. 11.

With a keen interest in traditional Chinese medicine, nursing student Breanna Closen of Peoria decided to take summer (2008) for a travel study project in the People's Republic of China right after her sophomore year at the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville School of Nursing. She received a $1,000 travel study grant from the School and also used some savings. Closen spent seven weeks in the Yunnan Province, mostly in the city of Kunming. She was among medical and nursing students from impressive institutions such as Harvard and Yale, but she held her own during the trip. \"I found I was just as prepared as them, so I feel good about the nursing education I'm getting here at SIUE,\" Closen said.\n\nBut that's not really the story she wants to tell here.\n\nDuring the China trip, Closen encountered an herbalist who was being studied by doctors from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who also were doing research in Chinese medicine. The doctor's research impressed Closen so much she chose the Mayo Clinic as her destination for a summer (2009) externship just after her junior year at SIUE.\n\nAnd, that's what has her so excited these days.\n\nShe wanted a chance to study Chinese medicine and Western medicine to make her a better nurse. \"Traditional Chinese medicine is based on what the Chinese call the Chi (energy) Channels in the body,\" she explained. \"Chinese medicine involves the use of herbals, moxibustion (an herb therapy) and acupuncture in conjunction with massage to maximize the body's 'chi channels,' or energy, and to balance the elements of Ying and Yang. \"I learned how Chinese medicine is catching on in the United States, so I wanted to take what I'd learned in China and bring it back here to try and find out how I can apply some of that to the kind of Western medicine we learn in America.\"\n\nWhich brings us to the Mayo Clinic. \"I had no 'plan B'; it was the only place I wanted to study for the summer because I was so impressed by those doctors who had traveled to China to research various philosophies.\" There were 800 applicants for the externship at the Mayo Clinic this past summer and Closen was among 200 accepted. \"It was very gratifying to be a part of it,\" she said. The Mayo Clinic paid for Closen's trip to Rochester and she spent 10 weeks immersed in classes about Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine. The Mayo Clinic is actually part of three health care institutions in a cluster- the Mayo Clinic, St. Mary's Hospital and Rochester Methodist Hospital. \"There are 90,000 people who actually live in Rochester and, of them, a third are employed by the clinic-it's huge.\n\n\"By the time patients come to the Mayo Clinic they are very sick,\" Closen explained. \"Most people there need the Western medicine and technology to achieve health, but we studied how others could be helped with the Chinese traditional medicine. But, when your liver is in danger and you are that close to death, you can''t rely on acupuncture. Western medicine is still very necessary. But at the Mayo Clinic, there are researchers who are studying the Chinese methods to see how they can tie in to help provide more efficient patient care. \"It's an amazing place,\" she said. \"I wish every nursing student could study there at least for a summer.\"\n\nAccording to Closen, Chinese traditional medicine involves a change in how we think about medicine. \"I had acupuncture for an old sports injury in my shoulder while I was in China,\" she said. \"The Chinese physician treated my shoulder, which resulted in no pain afterwards for two months. They also bled out the muscles in that shoulder and the blood was black. They explained old injuries tend to attract the blood to the muscles and the blood can stagnate. It was quite amazing.\"\n\nSIUE School of Nursing Dean Marcia Maurer said Closen exemplifies what the \"new generation\" health professional is learning. \"Specifically, that there is no 'one way' to provide health care,\" Maurer said. \"We can assist patients by combining the best of what Western health care has to offer, complemented by traditions from other cultures such as the Chinese. \"Patients today are demanding that the health care provider offer the best of western health care blended with other traditions to improve their outcomes. Breanna is already at the cutting edge of learning and applying complementary health care initiatives. Indeed, she will have a dynamic approach to her patient care situations.\"\n\nClosen has returned to SIUE for her senior year of nursing study and she was recently accepted to the University's Undergraduate Research Academy, where undergraduates are able to do the kind of research usually reserved for graduate students. She is researching \"Student Beliefs Related To Complimentary and Alternative Medicine.\"\n\n\"We're surveying students in classes in the Schools of Pharmacy, Nursing and Dental Medicine, as well as an interdisciplinary course,\" Closen explained. \"The research is looking at how students feel about Western medicine and how we could do more to embrace the Chinese methods and intertwine them with accepted practices in this country. We won't be able to change people's attitudes unless we start with educating healthcare students. There are 5,000 years of what you might call clinical trials in regard to Chinese medicine,\" she said. \"The methods work. They might not work miracles every time or even work in a way that Western science understands, but they are important enough to learn about them and use them. If it's been around that long, there must be something to it.\"\n\nDuring her 10 weeks in Rochester, Closen learned much about the institution and found that it is a research institution on a level with, say, a Johns Hopkins. \"We learned the basics and applied the research. It's all tied together. It represented the foundation of evidence-based practice. And, now I've come back here and I'm able to do my own research at SIUE.\n\n\"The Mayo Clinic is very progressive in how they approach medicine; every member of the healthcare team there teaches. They focus on a professional team approach supported by evidence-based practice to improve patient care, and facilitate an academic environment,\" she said. \"It's a whole new level of health care there and they are very very forward thinking in their philosophies.\"\n\nBack to top\n\n10/23/09\n\nSIUE Faculty, Piasa Bluffs Fellows Return From Stanford University Meeting\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) Three faculty members in the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville School of Education and four fellows from the SIUE Piasa Bluffs Writing Project have formed a research partnership with Stanford University's Design-Thinking School.\n\nThanks to an SIUE School of Education grant, Associate Professor Susan Breck, Assistant Professor Ralph Cordova and Associate Professor Ann Taylor, all from the SIUE Department of Curriculum and Instruction-as well as the Piasa Bluffs fellows: Jacqueline Green, Patricia Swank and Renee Greenlee-attended a research meeting at Stanford.\n\nThe goal of the partnership is to bring design-thinking into SIUE classrooms, Cordova said. Cordova described design-thinking as teachers \"moving away from just designing the 'ideal lesson plan,' to viewing ourselves as creating multiple iterations of an ideal lesson plan.\n\n\"It involves the belief that the best lesson plan is not developed in a vacuum in one sitting out of the mind of one person. Rather, when we learn to develop creative confidence in ourselves as thinkers,\" Cordova said, \"(we) engage with others ... in a creative collaboration using multiple perspectives to solve problems.\"\n\nHe added: \"We have a dynamite teacher education program and talented faculty and students, with the talent to push and innovate teaching and learning far into the 21st century,\" Cordova said. \"Ultimately"
