Members of the Legion Auxiliary presented the colors. Don Smith of the VFW led the six members of the Legion and VFW in the execution of the 21-gun salute.\n\nThe West Chicago Community Band, under the direction of Steve Govertsen, played a medley of patriotic songs. Reverberating throughout out the cemetery were the poignant sounds of “Taps,” played by WCCHS trumpeters, Josh Bowen and Jeri Rethford. As a side note, Govertsen and the two students participated in their last Memorial Day Service as members of the high school. Govertsen resigned his position to teach at another school and the students are graduating from the high school.\n\nIn his speech Mayor Ruben Pineda stressed the true meaning of Memorial Day, honoring those who sacrificed their lives to ensure freedom for then, now and the future.\n\n“Like all of you gathered here this morning, I am grateful for the chance to pay tribute to our fallen heroes and their families.\n\nI also wish to thank the young people who are here and commend them for recognizing the importance of this day of remembrance. Thank you to the West Chicago Community High School Band, under the direction of Steve Govertsen, for the stirring medley of patriotic songs and the playing of Taps. I cannot tell you how much it means to all of us that you are here to pay tribute to the brave men and women who have given us the freedom we cherish through their ultimate sacrifice, the gift of their lives.\n\nThe very first Memorial Day, known as Decoration Day because of the strewing of flowers upon the graves of the dead, took place at Arlington National Cemetery in 1868. Then Ohio Congressman and veteran James A. Garfield delivered remarks in honor of the Civil War dead. He noted the solemnness of the occasion by beginning, “I am oppressed with a sense of the impropriety of uttering words on this occasion. If silence is ever golden, it must be here beside the graves of fifteen thousand men, whose lives were more significant than speech, and whose death was a poem, the music of which can never be sung.”\n\nGarfield knew that words could never come close to conveying the deeds of the fallen and he clearly expressed his desire to distinguish this day as being first and foremost to honor those, who as he put it, “for love of country accepted death, and thus resolved all doubts, and made immortal their patriotism and their virtue.”\n\nI would also like to read a segment of the poem “The Fallen” by poet Laurence Binyon;\n\n“They shall not grow old, as we that are left to grow old: Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning, we will remember them.”\n\nThe world has changed much since James Garfield & Laurence Binyon uttered those words and yet they seem as appropriate today as they did when first spoken. Since then, our country has withstood tremendous wartime casualties and our active military continues to serve us, defending our country and putting their lives at risk in dangerous parts of the world like the Middle East and elsewhere.\n\nI am grateful to share with you that my nephew, Sergeant Edward Thomas Pineda, a graduate of West Chicago’s class of 2003, has completed 6 tours of service and has come home permanently to his family and community. Thank you for your support over the last 5 years mentioning him and the 12 years he served our country.\n\nThis year, our nation honors the 100th Anniversary of the United States entering WWI and all those who served, including those who never made it home.\n\nOur own City Museum will memorialize some of the many West Chicago WWI veterans in its blog, A Sense of Place, as well as create programming about the historic war that changed humanity.\n\nAs we conclude our Observance here at our Soldiers and Sailors Monument in this historic Oakwood Cemetery and proceed to our cars, I ask you to reflect on the American flags waving softly, silently, in the breeze on the gravesites of veterans here, as well as Glen Oak, Calvary and St. John Cemetery, and in cemeteries all across this country. It’s the silence of this day, this moment, that most stirs our hearts, because of its finality.\n\nThank you all for being here today to honor the heroes that gave their lives, to give us our freedom.\n\nGod bless the men and women who died for our country, God bless their families and all the people of West Chicago and God bless the United States of America. Thank you.” (www.merleburl.com)\n\nAROUND AND ABOUT\n\nWest Chicago City Museum, 132 Main Street, and West Chicago Historical Society Kruse House Museum, 527 Main Street, are participants in the “Passport to Adventure” program, which runs now through Monday, September 4, 2017.

Jim Rahtjen, LMS Choir Director, wrote the arrangement of the “Star Spangled Banner,” especially for middle school students. Their participation came about because of a misdirected email.\n\nSeveral weeks ago, Rahtjen received a misdirected email from the Chicago Sky, inviting clubs from area schools to attend a game during the school day. The sender of the email mistakenly identified him as a STEM club sponsor, inviting him to bring his “club” to a game. Instead of disregarding the email and clicking delete, Rahtjen sent a reply email stating, “I’m not the STEM club sponsor but a choir director.” To his delight, he received an instant reply, stating that he was more than welcome to bring the students in the choir to the game. “There’s a little-known maxim that I live by, ‘you do not have because you do not ask.’ So I asked! “Who’s singing the National Anthem that day?” to which I received the reply, “If you bring 50 people to the game, we’d be happy to have you stand center-court before the game and sing the National Anthem,” Rahtjen said. And the rest of the story is history, definitely a memorable experience for the students.\n\nSupport our local businesses as they not only contribute to the community through taxes, but also generously contribute through monetary and in-kind donations to clubs, churches, organizations and schools.\n\nContributing to the Boy Scout Troop 33 and West Chicago Professional Firefighters Association 3970 Pancake Breakfast were Ward 7 Alderman Noreen Ligino-Kubinski, John B.

The last sale takes place from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Saturday, June 10, 2017 in the church parking lot, 468 Ann Street. The mulch, provided by a local landscaper, is premium and standard.

Mushroom compost also is available at $4 a bag, $10 for three bags and $30 for ten bags.\n\nAs a side note, remember when putting mulch around the base of trees and shrubs, do not make a volcano, but make a doughnut. The recommendation from various nurseries advises persons to add a two to four-inch layer of mulch around the base of the tree, which prevents weeds from growing and still allows water to reach the soil, and keep the mulch 12 to 24 inches away from the tree trunk. Mulch and the water it stores, can contribute to fungi growth, plus provide a nice warm spot for insects.\n\nHealthy West Chicago hosts “Walk to a Better Health,” a 5K Walk and Health Celebration, from 9:00 a.m. to noon Saturday, June 10, 2017.

In its 81st year, the firm serves the excavating, paving, concrete and trucking needs of businesses and residents.\n\nIn 1936, Art Lootens, now deceased, bought a dump truck, mainly hauling coal, explained Jim. “He shoveled coal into the bins at residences in the area, staying with this until 1946.” At that time Henry Vanucker handed part of his excavating jobs to Art. At the same time, the late Joe Jemsek, owner of St. Andrews Golf and Country Club, urged Art to assist with the roads and excavating at the club. “He talked my dad into buying a Caterpillar.”\n\nAdding to the manpower, Art’s brother Ed, who served in WWII joined the company in 1946. As the business grew, Art hired Charlie Wheeland. Needing more equipment for the various jobs, Art purchased a crawler crane for digging trench holes. In addition to St. Andrews, other customers included Lindsay Light & Chemical Company, Reid Murdoch Factory, Ball Seed Company and Chicago & Northwestern Railroad. Art and his employees worked long hours, from 4 a.m. until 8 or 9 p.m.\n\nThe company also is known for its steam engines. In 1969 Art bought the first one, a 1918 model, as “a form of advertisement.” The second engine is a 1922 model. The steam engines, especially popular for corn boils, are frequently seen at community events and festival. The corn boil, organized by the West Chicago Fire Protection District, was a big draw during past Railroad Days. The corn boil now is a part of the West Chicago Community High School Sports Fest held at the beginning of the school year. Other local events include the Geneva School Sports Night, Geneva Family Service fundraiser, and DeKalb Corn Fest. “At one event, we go through 25,000 ears of corn in two hours.”\n\nArt also was involved in government, serving as Winfield Township Road Commissioner from 1967 through 1988. He was instrumental in the formation of the West Chicago Fire Protection District, “a main force in the funding. He was the first president of the district.”\n\nJim followed in his father’s footsteps by taking an active interest in the community, serving as a commissioner of the West Chicago Park District for 17 years. Also he served on both the DuPage County Fair Board and DuPage County Fair Authority.\n\nThe second generation started in 1973 when Jim and his wife Jan purchased the company. After working full time with the family business since 1994, their daughter Kate Lootens bought her stock in in the business in 2006. Jim remained as president, working out in the field for the company. As with all businesses, changes occur, but some things remain constant. Jim said, “The business continues its tradition of long working hours and taking pride in work and equipment. Customer satisfaction still is very important.”\n\nAROUND AND ABOUT\n\nThe 2017 summer concert series at The Shell in Reed-Keppler Park are from 7:00 to 8:30 p.m. Wednesdays.

Time is flying by so quickly. With all the rain and sudden surges of heat, I am finding the noise of lawn mowers and edgers are often running in sync, rather than intermittently. When there is a lull in the weather conditions, everyone is trying to get yard work completed.\n\nWith the frequency of rain, everything is so green and lush. Of course, the weeds are growing prolifically. Since weeding is one way I alleviate stress and anxiety, I should be stress free. I must say I am somewhat calmer when something unexpected arises.\n\nPlanning outside activities can be somewhat of a challenge. As always, everyone should have a Plan B. Yet, with all the uncertainties, it is a great time of year. Summer perfect for taking leisurely walks and looking at the landscaping in the various yards, eating an ice cream treat, visiting with friends and neighbors on their porches or decks, taking life a little slower and attending some of the many activities in the community and elsewhere.

Although it was maintained, little restoration or renovation work was done. One Boy Scout troop previously undertook the task of restoration of archways and other wood trims. Ben Bungo, a member of Boy Scout Troop 33, saw a definite need for the improvement and restoration of the patio area and stair sections leading to the pavilion. He chose this for his Eagle Scout project. West Chicago Executive Director Gary Major said, “The Park District is very excited to partner with the Boy Scouts in a cooperative community effort. Certainly, the improvements to the Reed-Keppler pavilion will be excellent and very much enjoyed by everyone.”\n\nThis is definitely a labor intensive project. “It was in poor condition,” said Bungo. They spent four hours power washing the area. “We removed the cobblestones took out the stairs and placed the limestone blocks to one side.” They used three different layers, including gravel for the base of each stair. The young men and assistants are in the process of finishing up the project. Assisting on the project were members of Troop 33, friends and family. They are Michael Bugno, Noah Wirth, Jake Wirth, Mia Wirth, Steve Demma, Kellen Klaypatch, Nathan Klaypatch, Mike Wagner, Les Peto, John Peto, Duane Gill, Seth Kiel, Tom Warkins and Spencer Usedom.\n\nBoy Scout Troop 33 is known for their service to the community with its participation in many activities such as planting the flo"
