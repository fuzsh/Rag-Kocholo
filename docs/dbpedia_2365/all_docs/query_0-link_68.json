Most of professional architects use graphic design as means of communication, which display their ideas and aims of an already completed design. Moreover, as Gurel and Basa (2004:193) conveyed there is also &quot;a consensus for the necessity of an ideally finalized graphical presentation of a design project&quot; in design studios; a tendency releted with &quot;sets and systems of values that are hidden in the agenda of a design studio and its evaluation system&quot;.Nevertheless, these attitudes ignore the potentials of art of graphics within design process and constrain its usage by presentation.
