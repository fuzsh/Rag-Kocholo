        "text": "Guilty feelings are common. But are they healthy? Sometimes guilt can motivate us to do better. Studies have shown that people who experience guilt are more likely to be proactive in solving a problem. They are also more likely to reassess the problem later, see how they may have contributed to it, and learn from it.\n\nGuilt over something trivial, such as eating an extra dessert, guilt that turns into shame, feeling that you’re not good enough, or blaming yourself for something that’s not your fault can be harmful. Both can diminish self-esteem and lead to depression.\n\nHere are some tips to help you start handling guilt today:\n\nLearn from what’s making you feel guilty.\n\nDon’t be too hard on yourself. You can’t be kind and understanding all the time.\n\nIf you’re troubled by chronic feelings of guilt, a counselor may help to sort out the contributing emotions and issues\n\nArticle from the StayWell Company, LLC\n\nLooking for a challenge this summer?

But even if you sleep like a baby, it’s a smart idea to eat foods high in this mineral. Every organ in the body needs magnesium. It contributes to energy production, helps regulate levels of nutrients in your body, and affects sensors in the brain that promote sleep.\n\nLuckily, you can find magnesium in lots of foods, but many Americans don’t get enough. For maximum magnesium, look to spinach, other leafy greens, almonds, pinto beans, nuts, and legumes. It’s simple to incorporate them into your diet, too. Try cooking up some spinach with olive oil and pine nuts as a savory side dish, or make a spinach salad that includes chickpeas and almond slivers. Research a new recipe today to try out! You knew that spinach makes you strong—now you know it may also help you sleep.\n\nArticle from the StayWell Company, LLC\n\nGood Luck at the Bellin Run this Saturday, June 8th!

You can say, ‘I have finished.’ There is a lot of satisfaction in that.” ~ Fred Lebow, New York City Marathon co-founder\n\nThe Italians have it right when it comes to grown-up grilled sandwiches. You don’t need a Panini maker—you can use a frying pan and a heavy plate to press the sandwich.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 4-inch-square Panini roll\n\n1 slice (1 oz.) low-sodium Swiss cheese\n\n2 oz. cooked pork tenderloin\n\n1/4 cup shredded zucchini\n\n1 Roma tomato, cut into thin slices\n\n1/8 cup thinly sliced red onion\n\nOlive oil spray\n\nDirections\n\nSlice roll and remove some of the interior bread to make for a crisper sandwich.\n\nPut half the cheese on bottom of roll. Layer meat, zucchini, tomato, and onion. Cover with rest of cheese and top of roll.\n\nHeat a sandwich grill. Spray grill plates lightly with olive oil. Bake sandwich until cheese melts and meat is hot, about 3 to 5 minutes.\n\nMakes 1 sandwich\n\nEach sandwich contains about 479 calories, 17 g fat (6 g saturated fat, no trans fat, 66 mg cholesterol), 539 mg sodium, 48 g carbohydrate, 4 g dietary fiber, 4 g sugars, and 31 g protein.\n\nRecipe from the StayWell Company, LLC.\n\nTreat yourself to coffee or tea and a good book today. You read emails. You read text messages. You read the news. But have you read a good book lately? Reading for pleasure can be an escape from the stresses of everyday life, help keep your mind sharp, and even make you more likely to empathize with others.\n\nSo set aside a half-hour to curl up with a book. Grab a comforting cup of coffee or tea, too. Drinking black, green, or oolong tea can boost the body’s defense against disease, research says. Tea has also been linked to lower risk for heart disease, cancer, osteoporosis, and allergy symptoms. And coffee has been associated with a lower risk for type 2 diabetes. We’ll toast to that!\n\nArticle from the StayWell Company, LLC"
