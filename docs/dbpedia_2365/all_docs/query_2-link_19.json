        "text": "FROM DR. HURD: FEAST DAY ORGAN RECITALS 2022-2023\n\nThe organ at Saint Mary’s, Aeolian-Skinner Opus 891, dates from 1932 with additions in 1942 and 2002. It is a legendary instrument due to its high rear-galley installation and the resultingly rich musical voice it has given to the legendary worship tradition of Saint Mary’s, its sonic refinement (in contrast with its strikingly unfinished appearance), its thrilling engagement of the lively acoustics of the church, and the remarkable musicians, too many to name, who have brought it to life, performing on it through the years in the liturgy, in recital, and on recordings. In addition, no discussion of the organ at Saint Mary’s is complete without thankful mention of Lawrence Trupiano who has curated it for decades.\n\nThe New York City Chapter of the American Guild of Organists has twice recognized its International Performers of the Year by presenting them in major recitals at Saint Mary’s. In addition to these great musical events, short organ recitals traditionally have been played preceding Solemn Mass on several major feast days. Visiting artists have included many who are affiliated with New York churches and schools as well as artists from out of town. These short recitals, along with so much else, took a pause from March 2020 through November 2021 due to the pandemic. However, they resumed last December for a shortened season as Saint Mary’s began again to schedule evening Solemn Masses on major feast days. In the present 2022-2023 season, our recital series will again include programs on All Saints’ Day (1 November), The Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary (8 December), The Epiphany (6 January), The Presentation (2 February), Eve of The Annunciation (24 March), and Ascension (18 May).\n\nHere is an introduction to the musicians who will present organs recitals on this year’s series:\n\nTyrone Whiting, Director of Music at the Church of Saint Martin-in-the-Fields, Philadelphia, will present the recital on 1 November, All Saints’ Day. Tyrone Whiting is an organist, pianist, and conductor who began his formal studies as a teenager at Croydon Parish Church (now Croydon Minster) in London, UK. Five years later, in the summer of 2011, he was awarded the Associateship diploma of the Royal College of Organists (ARCO). He graduated in 2012 with a Bachelor of Music degree in organ performance from Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, where he was three times winner of the Geoffrey Singleton Prize for Organ Performance, and twice winner of the Cardnell Organ Prize for ‘talents as an organist.’ He also studied at Trinity’s Junior Department where he was awarded the Hambourg Award for Improvisation. He graduated from the Royal College of Music (RCM) in the Postgraduate Diploma in Performance Science course. Returning to the RCM in 2016, he received a distinction in the Master of Music degree course. In addition to working in and around London as a teacher of organ, piano, and theory, he was also Head of Music at Elmhurst Independent School for Boys for several years and worked as an animateur in London schools and with the London Mozart Players. Prior to his arrival in the United States, he was Director of Music at Saint Mary’s Parish Church, Battersea from 2012 to early 2018. In September 2017, he was appointed Director of Music at Grace Church in Newark, New Jersey. At Grace Church, he extended the Chorister Choir School program, developed and expanded the adult choir, and founded the Brick City Chorus, an adult chamber choir. He is currently Director of Music at the historic St. Martin-in-the-Fields, Philadelphia, where he oversees an adult choir, a children’s choir Chorister program, and a robust series of concerts throughout the year. He has performed extensively including major venues in England, France, and Spain, and continues an expanding schedule of performances on this side of the Atlantic. His program on 1 November will include works of J. S. Bach and César Franck, the bicentennial of whose birth is being celebrated this year.\n\nMichael Hey, Associate Director of Music and Organist of Saint Patrick’s Cathedral, New York City, will present the recital on 8 December, The Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Described as “scintillating” and “tremendously virtuosic” (The Straits Times, Singapore), concert organist Michael Hey has been increasingly visible on U.S. and international stages. He has performed organ concertos with the San Francisco Symphony, the Juilliard Orchestra, and New York City Ballet Orchestra. He has appeared at renowned venues such as Carnegie Hall and Madison Square Garden. In September 2017, he received first prize in the Shanghai Conservatory of Music First International Organ Competition. Released in October 2017, his premiere solo CD recording Michael T. C. Hey plays the Great Organ of Saint Patrick’s Cathedral in New York is available for purchase by the JAV recording label. In 2015, he was appointed Associate Director of Music and Organist of Saint Patrick’s Cathedral in New York City, where one of his first major tasks was to perform for the first U.S. visit of Pope Francis. He plays for over 700 services a year at Saint Patrick’s Cathedral, many of which can be heard on Sirius XM radio, television, and online. Not exclusively a solo organist, he enjoys collaborating with other artists. He has performed with Renée Fleming, Matthew Polenzani, and Isabel Leonard. He performs duo recitals with violinist Christiana Liberis. He is a graduate of The Juilliard School where he received his B.M. and M.M. degrees in organ performance under Paul Jacobs. He is represented in North America exclusively by Phillip Truckenbrod Concert Artists, LLC. His program on 8 December will probably feature some of Marcel Dupre’s Fifteen Antiphons, Opus 18, or Olivier Messiaen’s La Nativité du Seigneur.\n\nGail Archer, director of the music program at Barnard College, Columbia University, will present the recital on 6 January, The Epiphany. Gail Archer is an international concert organist, recording artist, choral conductor and lecturer who draws attention to composer anniversaries or musical themes with her annual recital series including her 2021 series, A Slavic Celebration, and Max Reger, The Muse's Voice, An American Idyll, Liszt, Bach, Mendelssohn, and Messiaen. She was the first American woman to play the complete works of Olivier Messiaen for the centennial of the composer's birth in 2008; Time Out New York recognized the Messiaen cycle as “Best of 2008” in classical music and opera. Her recordings include her August 2020 release, Chernivtsi, recorded at the Armenian Catholic Church, Chernivtsi, Ukraine, featuring contemporary Ukrainian composers, A Russian Journey, The Muse’s Voice, Franz Liszt: A Hungarian Rhapsody, Bach: The Transcendent Genius, An American Idyll, A Mystic In the Making (Meyer Media), and The Orpheus of Amsterdam: Sweelinck and his Pupils (CALA Records). Her 2022 European tour took her to Switzerland, Germany, Poland, and Lithuania. She is the founder of Musforum, www.musforum.org, an international network for women organists to promote and affirm their work. She is college organist at Vassar College, director of the music program at Barnard College, Columbia University, where she conducts the Barnard-Columbia Chorus and Chamber Singers, and a faculty member of Harriman Institute, Columbia University. She is artistic director of the artist and young artist recital series at historic Central Synagogue, New York City. Her program on 6 January will feature works from Ukrainian composers Tadeusz Machl (1922–2003), Svitlana Ostrova (b. 1961), Victor Goncharenko (b. 1959), and Mykola Kolessa (1903–2006).\n\nDavid Hurd, Organist and Music Director at The Church of Saint Mary the Virgin, will present the recital on 2 February, The Presentation.

Buxtehude is one of the most highly regarded composers of the generation before Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750). His compositions include a wealth of organ music, pieces both free and based upon pre-existent melodies for sacred texts. His Choralfantasia Te Deum laudamus is a five-movement work based upon the Solemn Tone plainchant for Te Deum, the ancient Latin hymn traditionally (but doubtfully) attributed to Saints Ambrose and Augustine. The Praeludium, the first of the five movements, is introductory to the four succeeding versets in which the plainsong melodies are quoted. Following the Praeludium, the second movement, Primus versus, quotes the opening verse of the plainsong for “We praise thee, O God, we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.” It is heard as a cantus firmus in long notes alternately below and above more accompanying figuration, and later in other varied textures. Sunday’s postlude is the fifth and final verset of Buxtehude’s Te Deum. This fifth movement is based on the verse Tu, devicto mortis aculeo (“Thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death”). It comprises two sections of strictly imitative counterpoint and a closing section in freer fantasia style.\n\nThe setting of the Mass on Sunday morning is the Mass for Four Voices by Thomas Tallis (c. 1505–1585). Tallis was one of the most foundational composers of English church music. His long life and musical career included service under four English monarchs—Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary Tudor, and Elizabeth I—with all the shifts in the church’s liturgical and institutional life that these different reigns occasioned. Tallis’s early life is not well documented, but references to his musical employment begin to appear as early as 1532 when he was appointed organist at the Benedictine Priory of Dover. Notably, he was later employed at Canterbury Cathedral and served as a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal. Along with William Byrd, Tallis enjoyed an exclusive license to print and publish music that was granted by Elizabeth I in 1575. While he was one of the first musicians to compose for the new Anglican rites of the mid-sixteenth century, Tallis retained an affection for the Latin forms and continued to compose extensively for them. Tallis’s unnamed Latin Mass for Four Voices probably dates from the 1550s. Its musical style reflects the trend of that time away from very florid liturgical settings and toward syllabic and chordal compositions, favoring clearer declamation of the text.\n\nSunday’s Communion motet is by Hans Leo Hassler (1564–1612), who was born in Nuremberg and baptized on October 26, 1564. Hassler had a musical career that bridged the late Renaissance to the early Baroque period. His initial musical instruction was from his father, Isaak Hassler (c. 1530–1591). Hans Leo left home in 1584 to study in Venice with Andrea Gabrieli (c. 1 532–1585) and become a friend and fellow pupil with Gabrieli’s nephew Giovanni (c. 1554–1612). Thus, Hassler was one of the first of a succession of German composers to experience in Italy the musical innovations that were shaping what would later be identified as Baroque style. Hassler was recognized in his day not only as a composer, but also as an organist and a consultant on organ design. Although he was a Protestant, Hassler’s early compositions were for the Roman church. Hassler’s four-voice setting of the first three verses of Psalm 96 was published in Nuremberg in his Sacri concentus, 1601. His works also include two other settings of this joyful psalm text: one for five voices (Cantiones sacrae, 1591), and the other an impressive poly-choral setting for twelve voices in three choirs. The more modest four-voice setting, however, is the most well-known. It presents the text in alternating homophonic and contrapuntal textures, using voice pairing at annunciate to give a hint of poly-choral flavor and add emphasis to the text. — David Hurd\n\nADULT EDUCATION OCTOBER–DECEMBER 2022\n\nThis coming Sunday, October 23, at 9:30 AM, in Saint Benedict’s Study, we will continue the first part of this year’s study of the Holy Eucharist in the Adult-Education program. Brother Thomas Bushnell will teach the classes on this coming Sunday and on October 30.\n\nOctober 23: The Eucharist as Prayer\n\nOctober 30: The Eucharist as Presence\n\nParticipation by the members of the class is invited and encouraged.\n\nTo find Saint Benedict’s Study, please enter Saint Joseph’s Hall via the entrance at 145 West 46th Street, bear right and head down the long hallway which takes you past the rest rooms, the windows, and then heads toward the Sacristy. The classroom is located on your left, just short of the doors to the Smoke Room, the Control Room, and the Sacristy.\n\nOn Sundays in November, and on the first two Sundays in December, Father Peter Powell will teach a series of classes on Ephesians, Colossians, and 2 Thessalonians. Father Peter writes:\n\n“We have the church that we have largely because of Paul of Tarsus. The New Testament includes many letters ascribed to Paul, and what those letters all have in common is the founding or nurturing of what we now call a church. Seven of the letters are accepted by all scholars as authentic, which is to say that they were almost surely written by Paul himself. Scholars disagree about the rest. Some scholars argue for Pauline authorship, some disagree, often vigorously.\n\n“What difference does this make? That’s the underlying question we will explore for six weeks each Sunday morning in November and early December, and then again during Lent. All of the letters are included in the biblical canon, and are, therefore, of equal value, at least theoretically. However, most of us, whether consciously or not, value some parts of the bible more than we do others. For instance, I prefer Mark over the other gospels and Romans and 1 Corinthians over the other epistles. I have my reasons for these preferences, but I recognize that preferring certain books can mean neglecting others.\n\n“Some people value Paul’s ‘authentic’ letters more than they do the rest. This series of classes gives us an opportunity to discuss those canonical issues, but also to read some texts that it would be a shame to neglect. We will begin with Colossians, then study Ephesians, and finally turn to 2 Thessalonians. If we have time, we’ll look at 1 & 2 Timothy and Titus. I hope you will join us. I think we will enjoy reading these challenging texts together.”\n\nEL DÍA DE LOS MUERTOS/THE DAY OF THE DEAD\n\nAt midnight on November 1, All Saint’s Day, many Mexicans, Mexican Americans, and other Latin Americans will begin their celebration of El Día de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead. This celebration is not the Mexican Halloween, despite the use of skulls and skeletons in the iconography of the day. The day is connected to the celebration of All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day, but is distinct from it. Several Mexican scholars have published a website, in English, dedicated to providing information about this distinctively Mexican and Latino celebration. They write, “A dedication to the deceased, the Day of the Dead (El Día De Los Muertos) is a two-day holiday that reunites the living and dead. Families create ofrendas (“offerings”) to honor their departed family members that have passed. These altars are decorated with bright yellow marigold flowers, photos of the departed, and the favorite foods and drinks of the one being honored. The offerings are believed to encourage visits from the land of the dead as the departed souls hear their prayers, smell their foods and join in the celebrations!”\n\nTake a look at this informative and very attractive website. It is exciting to be able to learn more about all of our neighbors."
