This is the fresh- man's official start to his or her tenure at Susquehanna, but if asked, most upperclassmen will remember it as a big, hot line outside Weber and a series of interesting, if endless, speeches by student and faculty leaders. Be there — it's worth it. Until 3:30 families and new students are welcome to browse the bookstore (don't forget the essential SU sweatshirt) and get settled. At 3:45, however, itis time for the first hall meeting! and the last hug and kiss from Mom and Dad. Those first few minutes alone may be the hard- est, but don't forget — theyire the start of youfre biggest adven- ture. The rest of your first day has been planned to allow you some time to get to know the new roomie but also not enough time to get bored or lonely — there's a picnic outside at 5 p.m., meet- ings with your O-Team leader and discussion group at 6 p.m. and the inagural Dave Binder show. This is a must-see because Dave Binder is an excellent performer, a talented musician and a legend at Susquehanna. Youfll soon learn to anticipate every time he shows up here. Be up at 8:30 a.m. on Friday to take the CIRP questionnaire (think of the SATs, only much easier) and get to one of the four morning meetings concerning the school in which you are enrolled. At 11:15, there are departmental meetings concern- ing your major or potential major and at 11:45 there is an Academic Alternatives Fair in Mellon Lounge. Grab an ice cream cone on the way out of the caf and take a stroll through the lounge — there are all sorts of services to become familiar with at the Fair. After lunch, prepare yourself for another battery of depart- mental meetings until 2 p.m. Don't stop there, however — at 2 p.m. there are mandatory fac- ulty advisor and student adviser meetings for all new students. If you miss these, you'll be clue- less for years as to how to go to, study for and schedule classes. By the way, at some time between 2 and 5, student ID cards are available for photo and pickup. Don't forget to show up for the appointment with your faculty advisor before 5:30 p.m. After the dinner with your faculty advisor, your student advisor and their other advisees, the OPC has set up a fast-paced, fun evening with Rick Kelley. You'll get to meet other students and listen to music while run- ning around and hollering your head off! Get to bed early, though, because Saturday is Community Service Project day. Starting at 12:45 p.m. Sat. afternoon, freshmen will be par- ticipating in various community service projects, led by members of the O-Team. Washing fire trucks, cleaning out the local nursery school and canvassing for the American Cancer Society are only some of the things groups will be involved with. After the volunteering experi- ence there will be a reception at which reflection and discussion are planned. Saturday evening, the O- Team makes fools of themselves once again with the annual pro- duction of \"We Present . . .,\" a variety show spoofing life at Susquehanna and the freshman experience. Look for the famous \"Donit Carry a Purse\" skit and the hilarious \"Beans in the Pot\" skit. After the show, Orientation is wound up with Free Games Night in the game room and acoustic guitar in Charlie's. Orientation,the OPC, the O- Team and everything about the first week at Susquehanna will be memorable for freshmen, new students and returning stu- dents. Take advantage of all the university has to offer and live it up on your last few days of free- dom before classes. acuity experiences changes Iaggie Becker iging Editor It the end of last semester [over the summer, many ?es and adjustments have made in the lives of staff faculty of Susquehanna, laren Pick was re-elected ient of The Women's :iation of Susquehanna :rsity.

The Board is directly responsible for the AmeriCorps state programs and Learn and Serve America community- based programs. Professor of English and Director of the Writers' Institute Gary Fincke recently released his new book, Fmergencv Calls Many of the stories included in the book are set locally and men- tion locations as Selinsgrove, Sunbury, the Susquehanna River and Harrisburg. Fincke will pro- vide a free, public reading from the book on Wed. Sept. 11 at 7:30 p.m. in the meeting rooms fo Susquehanna's Degenstein Campus Center. Three people were named to the University's Board of Directors at its May meeting. Dr. Margaret Peeler, Assistant Professor of Biology, will serve as faculty representative to the board for a three-year term. Stepher R. Schilling, manag- ing partenr of The Quaker Group in Montgomeryville, PA and the Quaker Investment Company in Voorhees, NJ, will also serve a three-year term. He is a member of the Sigmund Weis School of Businessfs Alumni Advisory Support Group which provides support f<5r fac- ulty and job placement opportu- nities for Susquehannastudents. Susan Colby, junior Mass Communications major from Dennis, MA, will serve as stu- dent member of the Board . Colby is the admissions intern Photo by Stacey-fJahn The O-Team assists incoming freshmen in unloading their vehicles. Throughout the week, these dedicated students wearing bright orange T-shirts helped coordinate the 1996 orientation. With their help, new Susquehanna students learned to adjust quickly to their new environment. Handbook explains rules By Maggie Becker Managing Editor If you haven't done it yet, you will . . . that is putting holes in your walls with thumbtacks or nails. If that's not in your plan, what about hanging fabric (flags, tapestries etc . . .) from your dorm walls or lighting a candle so the place smells bet- ter? Each and every one of these violations is clearly stated in the Student Handbook and is strictly forbidden in all of the University's housing. Every school has its own set of policies, rules and regulations but at Susquehanna, some of the more obscure are the most strict- ly enforced. Take the Caf, for example. Though theoretically each student pays approximately $5.50 for dinner every night, it is strictly forbidden for any student to take anything out of the Caf which they have not already begun eating. That means absolutely no. stashing bagels in your bookbags, apples in your gym bag or bananas in your shorts. You think the friendly people sitting by the door are there simply to check ID when you enter? Wrong. Just try to sneak an uneaten orange past those ladies and feel their wrath! Speaking of wrath, everyone better mind their p's and q's at the Blough-Weis Library because the security system there rivals that of most major airports. There's luggage searching, magnetic screening and the watchful eyes of many student and staff security offi- cers. Trying to steal a magazine from the reading is a serious enough offense — don't even think of hauling a can of soda or a snack in to study with you. The study carrolls and chairs have food sensors. You'll set off silent alarms all over the place and be hauled off in handcuffs before you know it. The real ter- rorists couldn't get a bomb into this place if they tried. All of this facetiousness is not to say that there are any University policies worth ignor- ing. A violation of Quiet Hours will bring out the Freddy Kreuger in your next-door neighbor like you've never seen him in \"Nightmare on Elm Street.\" Stumbling drunk down the halls of your dorm at 3 a.m. singing the \"Brady Bunch\" theme will win you no points with the RA or Head Resident. Withdrawing from half your classes the week before Winter Break will not make Alex Smith your biggest fan, nor will pop- ping the clutch on your four- wheel-drive across the field hockey and soccer fields endear you to the coaching staff. Additionally, the public safety officers will not enjoy becoming your best friends because they continually have to report to your room because of a strange, weedy smell seeping smokily from under the door. Be careful where you park your car, treat yourself and oth- ers with respect and be aware of the pertinent rules and conse- quences of all the activites you engage in. This is the attitude which enables our community to be able to function as such. And by all means, don't go anywhere near those golf carts. Their operators are very protective. RAs trained to help students By Amy Frank Assistant Features Editor Who are those people that tell you to turn your stereo down or let you into your room when you have locked yourself out ... again? These people who enforce the rules and help those in need are your Resident Assistants (RAs) and Head Residents (HRs). They have been trained in various areas -- including counseling -- and are a resource for you to use to answer nearly any questions you may have. In addition, they are there not only to enforce the rules but also to help you in times of crisis. Upperclass students have learned that an RAs knowledge can prove to be very helpful, especially during the first few weeks of your college career. RAs say not to be afraid to ask them anything , even if you feel like you might be asking them a \"dumb\" question. They say the chances are high that they have just been asked the same question 10 minutes earli- er by someone else. RAs say they recommend that students look over the handbook given to them so they become familiar with the basic rules of the university.

This series, run by Henry Diers, dean of fine arts and commu- nications, offers a range of events from performers such as the Glen Miller Orchestra to international dance groups. Tickets for these events are available at the box office located in Weber Chapel at no charge to SU students. The Glen Miller Orchestra and Vienna Boys Choir are the two most acclaimed groups of the nine scheduled performances dur- ing the 1996 - 97 Artists Series, titled A Season of Musical Excellence.

IMM ma Pase4 3Cfjc Crusaber Friday, August 30, 1 9ft Sports Olympic spirit hits SU By Amy Frank Assistant Features Editor Be prepared to see students engaging in some strange activi- ties- nine of them to be exact - as part of Susquehanna's seventh annual Fall Olympics. The events will begin at 1 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 7 on the intramural football field next to West Hall. Ken Peress, director of resi- dence life, will be the master scorekeeper for the day. Peress, who has been involved in the Olympics all seven years, said the games are \"a really good way to get to know people (and) have some fun.\" The top 10 teams in each event will be awarded a certain number of points, and prizes will be awarded to the top six teams after all events. In the event of a tie, teams' actual scores will be used. The first place team will receive a variety of prizes, including a steak dinner spon- sored by the dining hall service and an Olympic champion T- shirt for each team member. The events for the day are not the usual athletic Olympic games. For example, the sep- tathalon will require eight differ- ent people to complete activities at different stations. One mem- ber will crab walk to the next member, who will hop on one foot to the next person. The third member must perform three cartwheels, then run to the next two team members, who will leapfrog to the next station. The next teammate will log roll to the next person, who will then somersault to the last person. The final teammate will sprint 120 yards to finish the course. Another non-traditional Olympic game will be the bat relay. Ten participants for each team will take turns running to a bat and, while keeping the bat on the ground, place their foreheads on the end of the bat and circle it 10 times. Other events include the shoe relay, cageball, the wheel barrow relay, skin-the-snake, the trolley relay, and the earthball race. Junior Nick Rago participat- ed as a referee in last year's games. \"The people who go to it really have a lot of fun,\" he said. \"You can really cut back and be a kid.\" Resident assistants and head residents have rosters to register teams for the event. In addition, anyone who would like to partic- ipate but is not on a pre-arranged team should go to the field at 1 2:30 p.m. the day of the games to be placed on a team. Deadline to register as a team is 12:45 p.m. on Sept. 7. Photo by Sarah Mc Cracken Watch your step... students get down and dirty as they participate in Skin the Snake. Teams prepare for '96 season BY STACEY BAHN Staff Writer As Orientation and classes begin, Susquehanna's athletic teams have been warming up for another successful season Five returning senior Middle Atlantic Conference Commonwealth League All Stars return to lead the football team, with three on offense and two on defense. Kamief Jenkins should lead the team offensively At 6 feet. 3 inches and 205 pounds, Jenkins is a star on the basketball court and track as well. Jenkins led the team in recieving last season with 40 catches for 609 yards and 1 1 touchdowns. A potential candidate for the National Football League after graduation, he was a 1994 NCAA Division III track and field All American as a sprinter. During the winter months, Jenkins was a reserve forward on last season's Commonwealth League championship men's basketball team. Joe Balint and Don Duffy, both members of the second team of MAC Commonwealth League All Stars, also will lead this year's team. Balint was a first team All Star in 1994 and Duffy was named the Best Offensive Player last season fin- ishing second in both rushing (60 rushes 289 yards. 4.8 yard avg.) and receiving (21 recep- tions, 380 yards. 18.1 yard avg. Linebacker and co-captain Roger Wiest made UK) tackles last season to lead the team in the category two years in a row. In doing so, Wiest also earned first team All Star honors. Erich Maerz had a team high 8.5 sacks among his 52 tackles and was a second team All Star. On the cross country side, second-year head coach Dick Hess, is hoping to lead the team to victory. Three returning male runners ran in last year's MAC Championships as the squad fin- ished seventh, led by junior Eric Davis who finished 14th. The women, who finished ninth at the championships, return to competition with three of their top four runners from last season. Senior Maribeth Fives was the team's highest fin- isher at the MAC's and has bro- ken distance records on the track. Nestled between Smith Hall and the academic buildings, the field hockey field should see a lot of action as head coach Connie Harnum guides her team. As she enters her 22nd year, Harnum is optimistic that her team will improve on its 6-9 overall record last year. Three years ago, the field hockey team went 14-5 to capture the Commonwealth League champi- onship and advance to the NCAA playoffs. Juniors Kristen Jones and Amy Zimmerman return as sweeper and goalkeeper respec- tively to elead the defense. Jones was a Commonwealth League All-Star last season Fifth-year head men's soccer coach Steve Reinhardt is seeking to improve upon his squad's 6-9- 2 season last year. Three of the losses were by one goal, and the team gave national power Elizabethtown a run for its money before falling 5-3. Reinhardt will rely on the defense provided by senior Chris Herdman and junior Rob Harrison as backs. Herdman has started every game of his colle- giate career. The women's volleyball saw the graduation of All-Star hitter and school Co-Outstanding Senior Female Scholar- Athlete Michelle Liechty, but has four starters returning. Junior setter Stacey Depew (784 assists) and classmate hitter Amy Shults (213 kills) will lead the group of returning starters. Franklin and Marshall will meet Susquehanna's women's soccer team in their opener on Wednesday, Sept. 4 at 4:30 p.m. Head coach Kwame Lloyd and the Crusader program enters their third year as a team. Junior midfielder Christina Williamson is the team's returning MAC Commonwealth League All- Star, while junior Kristen Riehl is expected to be atBY full- strength again after suffering an injury a year ago. Riehl was the scoring leader in 1994. Sophomore Erin McCauliff led the women's tennis team last season with a record of 5- 3 in singles and 4-4 in doubles. Heal coach Bob Jordan led the team to a 3-3 record in the Commonwealth League a year ago. With a combination of six returning singles starters and a group of talented recruits, Jordan hopes to advance the team even further.

SU athletes receive honors Submitted by the Public Relations Office Susquehanna's athletic teams have repeatedly earned recogni- tion in the postseason— last spring was no exception. Graduate Adam Hackenberg, and seniors Rob Dunkleberger and Jason Aults, won the men's pair coxswain classification for the Susquehanna University Rowing Club at the prestigious Dad Vail Regatta on the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia on May 1 1 . The team beat com- petitors from Tennessee- Chattanoog; Queens College, , the University of Rochester, , Manhattan College and Tulane University to capture the cham- pionship. \"It was a great day for the Susquehanna program,\" said new head coach Ted Swinford, who has rowed for the United States national teams in both Olympic and World Game com- petition. \"This win is our national championship.\" In other sports, two-ime Middle Atlantic Conference Football All-Star graduate Lenny Ebel was the recipient of Susquehanna University's Blair Heaton Award as the top senior male scholar-athlete. A two-year starter and three- year letterwinner on the football team. Ebel was a first-team MAC Commonwealth League All -Star at comerback last sea- son.

Field hockey and lacrosse All-Star graduate Cassie Henry shared the award for Susquehanna's Outstanding Female Scholar- Athlete with fel- low classmate Michelle Liechty. Liechty was a two -time volley- ball All-Star and former MAC high jump placewinner. Henry was a four-year letter- winner in both field hockey and women's lacrosse respectively, Seaming MAC All-Star honors as an attack wing in women's lacrosse, and second-team Commonwealth League All-Star as a field hockey wing last sea- son.

Jewish holy day is observed By Dr. Jack Kolbert Guest Writer The fall season marks the advent of the holiest holi- days in the Jewish calendar. Most Jews, even if they do not regularly attend weekly religious services in their respective synagogues, make it a point to attend the solemn services conducted on the occasion of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year's holiday, and Yom Kippor, the Day of Atonement. Because Jews observe a lunar calendar totally unlike the calendar common to most people in the western world, their holiday obser- vances shift each year from date to date. Most of the High Holidays do, however, fall sometime in September or early October. The Rosh Hashanah holi- day, a two-day event, will begin this year at sunset on Friday, September 15. During the lengthy services, the shofar, a ram's horn, is sounded 100 time and is one dramatic highlight of the rit- ual. The most awesome holi- day in the Jewish calendar is Yom Kippor, a holiday that begins at sunset on Sunday, September 22 and continues until sunset on Monday, September 23. Most Jews fast during Yom Kippor, as they attend daylong services followed by a traditional \"Break the Fast\" meal at the conclusion of the day. Yom Kippor is also a day when Jews mourn and remember those who have passed away in their family. This service is called \"Yikzor\" which means \"remembrance.\" Since World War II during the Yikzor service, Jews not only remember those of their immediate family but also the six million Jews slaughtered during the Holocaust. The entire holiday season comes to an end with an eight-day series of holidays (this year September 27 through October 6) known as Sukkot, a harvest holiday, and Simchat Torah, a cele- bration of the Torah. Because of their solemn obligation to attend religious services at their synagogues, most Jewish students at Susquehanna will probably be absent from classes dur- ing the Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippor holidays. Faculty members are tequested each year to per- mit their students of Jewish faith to attend these reli- gious services by excuding them from class sttendance on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippor. Religious services will be conducted at Congregation Beth El in nearby Sunbury as well as at the Hillel Foundation on the Bucknell campus. Students who desire transportation to Beth El or who need information on the times of the various services and other holiday details are encouraged to contact Dr. Jack Kolbert. Head of the class. . . SU takes top ranks for third year Submitted by the Office of Public Relations For the third year in a row. Susquehanna University is ranked #1 among regional liberal arts colleges in the northeastern United States in U.S. News & World Report's special issue on America's best colleges. The magazine has been on newsstands since Monday, September 9. The magazine divides institutions into various cate- gories according to type of institution and, in some cases, region of the country. Earlier this year, U.S. News sur- veyed college presidents, deans and admissions directors at each college asking them to rate all of the schools in the same category as their own institutions. Their responses were combined with educational data provided by the col- leges. Institutions receiving the highest quality rankings were those which scored high in 1) student selectivity, 2) faculty resources, 3) student retention, 4) the educational value a school adds between freshmen orientation and graduation, and 5) alumni giving. This is the seventh year Susquehanna has been included in U.S. News's top listings of best colleges. Susquehanna University will also be recognized as offering one of the best values in education. A special section on financing college in the September 23 issue of U.S. News & World Report will rank Susquehanna 6th in providing the best value among regional liberal arts col- leges in the northeastern United States. The \"best college values\" issue will be on the newsstands Monday, September 16. , According to U.S. News, the best value rankings were devised to provide \"a realistic measure of where students can get the best education for the money.\" The rankings relate the cost of attending an institution to its quality. The best values were calculated in relation to both the stated or \"sticker price\" (tuition plus room, board and fees) and to the discounted price (tuition plus room, board, fees, books and estimated personal expenses, minus hte average of need-based grants). U.S. News notes the discounted price is more relevant for most private schools. \"Pennsylvania colleges and universities are well-repre- sented in these rankings and we're pleased to be included among them,\" said Susquehanna University President Joel Cunningham. \"It's important to note, however, that many outstanding colleges do not appear on these lists. Choosing a college is a very personal choice and a cam- Scholars House has academic environment By Jason Aults Staff Writer What is the Scholars' House, why does it exist and why do people want to live there? The Scholars' House is designed to be a small residence hall for students who wish to live in a more academically focused environment. The ini- tial concept for the Scholars' House was conceived by Dean Dorothy Anderson during the summer of 1993. She was par- tially responsible for the creation of the Honors Program housing at 409 University Avenue during the previous summer, and hoped to find similar housing else- where. When the building that was to become the Scholars' House became available, she jumped at the chance. Initially, the administration wanted to open the house to all members of the SU. student body who wanted to live in a more academic atmosphere. Near the end of the 1993-94 school year, an announcement was made to the students body concerning this new housing, and applications were received and reviewed by Peress and Sodt. The House was rebuilt and renovated during the summer of 1994 and the first residents moved in at the beginning of the 1994-95 academic year. Do you have to be a genius to move in? Does your IQ have to be at least 140? The answer to these questions is no. If you do, however, enjoy a single room, a newly-renovated building to live in and people who understand your interest in academics, then the Scholars' House is for you.

Prepare for your world as you know it to once again become chaotic. Homework is back, and with a vengeance. Once assignment takes an hour to complete, but the other three or four classes require at least two hours a piece to complete. The readings are long, boring and usually impossible to understand. The year has begun. Papers are once again your victim of procrasti- nation. As more papers are assigned, the more accustomed you become to spending the majority of your evenings past midnight in the library computer lab. You begin to realize that your life is merely a series of never-ending papers and essays. The year has begun. Meetings, meetings, meetings. This is the time when you realize that 24 hours is simply not enough time for one day's work. Your daily planner is jammed with group project meetings, volunteer meetings, professor meetings and club meetings. You run and scramble to catch a bite to eat between meetings and classes and realize that you only have five minutes to get to your next appointment. You don't need to excercise because you get plenty of physical activity just trying to stay on schedule. The year has begun. You still have to make time for your work- study job, your daily workout and your sports prac- tices and games. You work for minimum wage in the hopes that you will have enough money to spend on the simple pleasures of life. You can't enjoy what little free time you have because you are so tired, you have to sleep. The year has begun. Weekends become your sole purpose for liv- ing. Your social life is limited to the time you spend with friends during the weekend. There just isn't time for a social life during the week. The weekend comes and goes in a flash, but then there's the antici- pation for the next weekend. The year has begun. You make new friends and watch old pals leave. Your college years seem to be almost over, but the years you have left are sure to be good ones. Yes, the year has begun.

These stu- dents were lucky, however, because the changes and improvements made to this yearfs orientation program caused it to be far better than in the past. One knock against orienta- tion, past and present, is that stu- dents are given bright orange booklets and bequeathed to carry them at all times. \" The bright orange booklet is something we can work on,\" said Kari McCarty, an \" O-team\" member. On orientation week- end, students are \" easy pickens\" by merely looking for the vivid book. Most of the orientation events are mandatory, such as the opening convocation in Weber Chapel Auditorium, and the advisor group meetings. Events such as Dave Binder and musician Rick Kelley were optional, yet the turnout this year was incredible. And yes, even Charlie's (non-alcoholic) Pub was packed during this yearfs orientation. Students were required to attend a lecture in one of the four schools at Susquehanna. Plus, they attended a general Need to Know session, as well as advisor group meetings. Some students found the overload helpful. However some, like Jozette Kauffman, found the informa- tion sessions a tad tedious. \" They just got old after four days,\" said Kauffman. The general feeling of last year's orientation was that there was too much to do in too little time. No time was allotted for the finer things, like simply moving in and getting to know your roommate. However, this year there was much more time to unpack and a lot less of a feeling of being rushed around. The advisor group meetings, plus the added incentive of a good dinner, were a highlight for many students. \" It was cool to get a chance to meet your advisor and other students with your major at the advisor dinner,\" commented first-year student Amanda Hartung. One major weekend event was Saturday afternoons com- munity service project. Last year's projects were, for the most part, a waste of time. One group spent their afternoon sit- ting at the Red Cross listening to a woman lecture. No one was given a chance to get to know anybody and no community service was done. Although some of this year's first-year students may have dreaded their assigned project, the afternoon was a success. Sophomore O-team member and student advisor Sarah McCracken said, \" I thought that my group had a great time at the service project.\" McCracken's group volun- teered at the Sunbury Community Hospital where they served Ice Cream to Geriatrics patients. Because of rigorous pre-sea- son practice schedules, all fresh- men involved in athletics were able to attend only the mandato- ry sessions. Karolyn Sadowski, a fresh- Letters to the Editor Students studying abroad felt neglected by SU The following Letter was sub- mitted on April 30, 1996: Dear Editor: Susquehanna University often touts the study abroad pro- gram as if it is the best thing that a student can do for him or her- self while at college. While this may be true for most, it has become apparent that the University has forgotteni about many of its students participat- ing in the study abroad pro- grams. We, the study abroad students at Regent's College, London, feel that this is the case. This letter is written in com- plaint for the procedures used during course registration for next semester. Since we have yet to receive any materials from the registrarfs office, we are quite annoyed. When we decided to study abroad last semester, we were required to complete sever- al information forms indicating tiur place of study and various other information. Apparently, all the work done in preparation nas been disregarded, since all of our registration materials were sent to our homes in the US. This action taken by the regis- trarfs office was blatantly illogi- cal, considering that the office knew that we would all be in London for the semester. Not only did our families have to incur unnecessary expenses to send the materials to England, but they, unfortunately, were received after registration had ended at Susquehanna. What makes the situa- tion all the more irritating is the fact that the registrarfs office assured us all last semester that registration materials would be sent to London before the cam- pus registration occurred- in order to make up for the extra time necessary for international mailing. This obviously did not happen this semester. To make matters worse, several students sent faxes to the registrarfs office concerning course selections, which also asked for a simple reply from the office to insure that everything was received. To date, not one of us has hears anything from the registrarfs office. While this letter is aimed as a direct criticism of the registrarfs office, it is also meant to serve as a warning for future study abroad students. We wish you the best of luck. Yes, we all are having a wonderful experi- ence. Just a word of warning, don't be surprised if the univer- sity forgets about you. Sincerely, Karl Bittner Jill Carry Maura Doonan Scott Ban- Dana Brenner Pete Schwartz \" A Midsummer Night's Dream\" brings nightmares \"The following Letter was sub- mitted on April 30, 1996: To the Susquehanna Faculty: I saw A Midsummer Nightfs Dream this past Saturday, April 27. Actually, to be precise, I saw only some of the play. I walked out of the per- formance sometime before inter- mission (at the beginning of Act III, Scene 1), because I was offended by the performance, and I could no longer sit through what I considered a cruel and inappropriate portrayal of Snug the Joiner. I am not criticizing the student who performed the role. I am criticizing the director of the play, who had ultimate responsibility for the characteri- zations the actors present to the audience. Although I credit the director for drawing forth gener- ally fine performances from his actors, I believe the choice made for Snug was insensitive and cruel. In this production of the play, Snug was played as men- tally retarded (developmentally disabled). He spoke his lines as someone with such a disability would speak, with slurred and slow speech. Throughout his scenes, he appeared with a vacant look on his face, as if not fully mentally present. When the character Snug is given a part in the mechanicalf version of Pyramus and Thisbe, he does ask, .Have you the lionfs part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow to study! (i.ii 67-68). The , line is funny because it is absurd. , Since the lion only roars and has no actual dialogue, there is no written part for that character. We laugh at Snugfs simpleness, as well as at his anxiety concern- ing a role that requires no mem- orization. Shakespeare does have us laugh at the irude mechanical- si (III.ii9) or simple laborers in a way that reflects the class biases of his time. He assumes that of course, uneducated workingmen cannot be good actors; they can- not understand the imaginative -leap audience members make when they view a play and real- ize its fictionality, while still -reacting to it on an emotional level as if the representation were real. In laughing at Snug, we make ourselves complicitous to that class bias, and to some extent we share Shakespearefs fault. To portray Snug as developmentally disabled, how- ever, it to move from comedy to cruelty. By allowing or suggest- ing such a portrayal, the director is saying to his audience: II want you to laugh at this person with a disability. I believe that the developmentally disabled are fit subjects of your scorn.i I believe that such an attitude is wrong. We should not be teaching our students to laugh at people with disabilities, and we certainly shouldnft be saying to the young audiences who have seen the- play that people with disabilities- not to dismiss them scornfully. I believe the director need to think more fully about the social implications of his choices and his responsibili- ty to the larger community when he presents a play for public viewing.

Fitzpatrick), a New York boy who hopes to become a dancer, and Polly Baker (played by senior Wendy Turriziani), a small town girl whose father owns a rundown theater in Deadrock, Nev. Bobby's family is in the banking business, and his moth- er informs him as he is waiting to audition for a New York the- ater owner that he must leave immediately and travel to Deadrock to close another the- ater. Although he protests, he leaves before having the chance to audition. When Bobby arrives in Nevada, he immediately falls in love with Polly before realizing she is the daughter of the man whose theater he must shut down. At first Polly hates Bobby, so he creates a last-ditch attempt to save the theater: he uses the townspeople of Deadrock to put on a show, hop- ing that they will raise enough money to keep the theater from closing. His plan fails, however, when only one couple attends the show. Bobby finally gives up and returns to New York, certain that Polly despises him. In the meantime, Polly has fallen in love with Bobby, and just as he decides to return to Deadrock to make amends, she decides to go to New York for the same rea- son. Although all 35 roles in \"Crazy for You\" have been cast, there is still a need for technical theater and crew members.

Vennare, art historian introduced the new Mark Rothko exhibit \"Spirit of Myth\" that is being displayed in the Lore Degenstein Gallery until Oct. 13. Gallery displays \"Spirit of Myth\" By Christy Graham Staff Writer On Saturday, Sept. 7, the Lore Degenstein Gallery pre- sented it latest exhibit titled Mark Rothko: The Spirit of Myth, Early Paintings from the 1930s and 1940s in the Collection of the National Gallery. It is the opening exhibit of the 1996-97 school year, and the collection includes various representations of Rothko' s artistic development. Rothko' s paintings deal with transcenden- tal ideas. Some include biology and myth as a metaphor for something deeper. Raymond F. Vennare, art his- torian and fine arts manager, introduced the exhibit with a lec- ture. He explained that \"Rothko's works contain unique elements which i m p beyond t h e visual, asking who we are and where do we come from?\" Vennare also emphasized six stages of Rothko's development: Early (post-student), Archaic (Grecco-Roman), Surrealistic, Bio-Morphic/Mythic, Multi-forms, and Mature works. Senior Liz West, who attended the opening, was very impressed by the Rothko exhibit.\" \"The lecture was very informative and gave me a better appreciation of Rothko's works.\" The Gallery exhibit is open to all students until Oct. 13. Music Notes Goo Goo Dolls gain popularity By Missy White Staff Writer Getting their start through small, hometown gigs, the Buffalo band, called The Goo Goo Dolls, is now one of the hottest bands in America. The three-man band broke onto the music scene in 1986 and a year later released their first album titled \"Goo Goo Dolls.\" Then they signed with Metal Blade Records and in 1988 released their next album, \"Jed.\" Gaining popularity with their alternative, hard-core pop or melodic punk, they also attract- ed major label attention. Under Metal Blade's distribution deal with Warner Brothers Records, they released another album in 1991 called \"Hold Me Up. The Goo Goo Dolls contin- ued to keep fans coming back for more with a critically- acclaimed release in 1993, \"Superstar Car Wash,\" and their follow-up album last year, titled \"A Boy Named Goo.\" Since then, guitarist/vocalist Johnny Rzeznick, bassist/vocalist Robby Takac and their new drummer, Mike Malinin, have been on a national tour. Two songs on the album, \"Name\" and \"Naked,\" hit the charts early this year. Their lat- est single and video, \"Only One,\" is an almost guaranteed chart hit. Some of the other songs on the album include \"Long Way Down,\" \"Eyes Wide Open\" and \"Ain't That Unusual.\" The Goo Goo Dolls will per- form here Saturday, Oct. 1 2. in Weber Chapel auditorium.
