Gibson describes the experience of seeing a portion of a reconstructed Babbage machine in London. They discuss the details of the process of writing and planning. They discuss the relationship of the reader to the text in Difference Engine. Asked if it is easier “to invent the future or reinvent the past,” Sterling found it more difficult, Gibson found it easier. They discuss the historical language they researched and used. They reused characters from Disraeli’s novels, but some characters are based on real people, like Mori Arinori. Gibson discusses Virtual Light and talks about his movie projects. He is interested in Hollywood culture, “which is as close to my imagined future than anything else I have ever seen.” On the next tape they say that they took their instruments for scanning the future and pointed them at the past instead. The cyberpunk label, Sterling says, was applied by journalists, and he was worried that the label would mean that what they were doing was dead. The interviewer asks where they see “science fiction going.” Gibson says “there’s a bit more room now” for “people to do the oddball, off-the-wall stuff that I enjoy.” Sterling says he “read a lot of trash sci-fi when I was a kid. Sterling discusses Babbage and his history. They think they started talking about Babbage in 1983. They kept urging each other to write the book, but finally realized “it was a job” for two people. “I don’t think we could have done this without word processors,” says Sterling, who explains how they sent floppy disks back and forth. The interviewer asks if they are comfortable with the cyberpunk label, and Sterling says it does not slow them down. Asked why neither “has felt the urge” to write a “realistic article,” Gibson says he would have to use the popular “toolkit,” and he is not comfortable with that, and Sterling says his next book will be nonfiction (The Hacker Crackdown). Asked what science fiction writers they read, Gibson answers Burroughs, Ballard, Thomas Pynchon, and James Branch Cabell. They point out that they did not use the usual fictional devices, such as a conventional plot, in Difference Engine. They have “no immediate plans” to work together again; there will be no sequel to Difference Engine. They discuss sequels in science fiction, and digital sharecropping, and their friendship. They talk about their audience. Asked where the term “cyberpunk” came from, Sterling says that writer Bruce Bethke wrote a story called “Cyberpunk,” but Gardner Dozois popularized the term.

Manager says that there is no secret to the ink since it was declassified. 06:09 Manager explains the security and close tracking of the factory. Mary Brown inspects the printed money to look for defects. The cameraman asks various workers about their tasks. 28:58 Woman goes over the printing, drying, examining, and processing of money. She says the Federal Reserve tells the Bureau of Engraving and Printing how much to print. 32:33 Ron Weese talks about the money factory, saying he was amazed by the amount of money. He is in Washington for a Masonic conference and explains some of the symbols on the dollar bill. He dispels the myth that the Masons are a secret society. 38:30 Michael Bruce Sterling talks about marijuana. He talks about “hippies with computers,” people who are excited about the freedoms possible with the electronic landscape. “Hippies have been pushed off the cultural landscape.” He talks about the Craig Neidorf / Bell-South case, in which the hacker was jailed for distributing a classified document online. “We may see the ’90s as a digital ’60s…. This is a happening scene, baby.” He sees the computer underground as the new bohemia, the members of which are guinea pigs for introducing elements to society. He calls the hacker community “the first real cross-breeding of bohemia with really high technology.” 48:04 John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, talks about censorship and property rights in a new era. He compares electronic property rights to physical property rights, highlighting the difference between horse theft and the current possibility of “theft” that copies, replicates, and maybe even increases the value of the “stolen” property. He mentions the Grateful Dead’s philosophy of sharing music. He says that there are already people out on the frontier and that many in the underground claim technology and progression as their own. He says there is no moral stigma in pirating information and that this will result in a struggle in which “a lot of lawyers will make a lot of more for a long time.” He says officials, not understanding the nature of cyberspace, investigate piracy as though they were investigating witchcraft. He says the goal of the Electronic Frontier Foundation is to make sure freedoms are protected in digital media. He says that every time there is a new medium developed, the government tries to erect more extensive regulations, mentioning radio and television. He also talks about the Bell-South case describing the document as a hacker’s trophy of seven pages in “bureaucratese.” 1:00:59 End of tape.\"\"1991.01.Interview.onHackers.GRFG-J3NgFU\" audioInterviews1991.03\"brucesterling_202003_vbr\"017201:58:06Yes1\"Interview with Bruce Sterling by Larry McCaffery by McCaffery, Larry Publication date 1991-03-15 Topics Literature--Experimental--United States Language English Description: Against loud music, McCaffery says this is an interview of William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, but it is Sterling alone. Sinda Gregory also takes part. They discuss artificial intelligence, and Sterling brings up the work of Rudy Rucker and the idea of “postmodern science.” Sterling says of Gibson, “His brain works in mysterious fashion. Gibson’s “perceptions are very acute,” not like other science-fiction writers, who “are very interiorized.” They discuss Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace. Sterling uses “pomo” for “postmodernism.” They talk about Difference Engine characters and the real Sam Houston. McCaffery asks about the character John Keats. They discuss the place of the book Sybil or the Two Nations, in their book. Sterling says Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher are parodied in the book. Jim joins the interviewers. Sterling says the narrator is an extremely advanced artificial intelligence from 1991, getting closer to being able to see itself. “This book is about the conceptual roots of the information revolution” where the computer becomes self aware at the end of the book.” About the process, Sterling says, “I think it’s a very seriously computer constructed book. McCaffery talks about sampling and Sterling discusses détournement. The second tape begins with Sterling telling a story about Langston Hughes and Arthur Koestler. In the book, Sterling says what looks like chaos theory was “more of a metaphorical thing” than scientific. Sterling says he began his career doing historical fantasy. McCaffery says that the book has the “underworld, outsider perspective” of the cyberpunk genre. Sterling replies that “Angel of Goliad” was an earlier draft. “We started with Sybil,” he says. Sterling says there are those who can see “that this is some kind of experimentalist narrative,” and those who ask “Where’s the plot?” “Why was it set specifically in 1855?” McCaffery asks, and what about 1907? The dates, Sterling says, were to establish “the sense of historical scope” and ability to move back and forth in history. 30 years into a computer revolution is “where we are right now.” Collection: Larry McCaffery Papers Rights: Copyrighted.

A high tech presentation highlighting issues such as encryption, electronic invasions of privacy, fraud, civil liberties and computer crime, preceded a panel discussion. For the demonstration, a world-class team of four engineers from Sun and the San Diego Supercomputer Center brought in an HDTV, an ATM switch, an ISDN switch, a Russian satellite dish, a XEROX Liveboard, a BARCO projector with special video equipment, four Sparcstation 10s, a few Sparcstation 2s, and miscellaneous other equipment. The purpose of the demonstration was to show that while our current public policy makes distinctions based on industry, those distinctions have no meaning in the underlying technology. A television is a computer and a computer is a television a computer is a telephone and vice versa. To demonstrate the latter point, Gage and his associates showed how a new AT&T cellular phone could be changed by any 13-year old into a scanner. The demonstration also showed how DES code could be pulled off anonymous FTP systems in Finland, yet US industry was unable to export this technology. The panel consisted of Raymond Kammer, Acting Director of NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), who provided testimony on technology standard setting issues including the government-endorsed ''Clipper Chip'' encryption technology\"\"1993.05.senateHearings\" videoInterviews1994.00\"Intervista a Bruce Sterling - Daniele Brolli - Dario Voltolini _ Metropolis Videomusic (480p_25fps_H264-128kbit_AAC).mp4\"012900:19:20YesYes1\"Intervista a Bruce Sterling (parziale) e a Daniele Brolli, curatore di ''Cavalieri elettrici'' (1994) e Dario Voltolini, autore di ''Rincorse'' / Dal programma Metropolis di Videomusic condotto da Margherita Loy e Gabriella Facondo\"\"1994.00.MetropolisIta.Intervista.fHWHG6Y_huk\" videoConferences1994.03\"Bruce Sterling - The Colonisation of Cyberspace (Virtual Futures, 1994) (720p_25fps_H264-192kbit_AAC).mp4\"056200:59:39YesYes1 2 3\"Speech from ''Seduced & Abandoned: The Body in the Virtual World'' Seduced & Abandoned was one of a series of ICA conferences (spanning 12-13 March in 1994) held under the umbrella title Towards the Aesthetics of the Future that explored the connections between culture, society, politics and the impact upon them of new digital processes and technologies.

Winner of the ''Audience Award for Documentaries'' at the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival, 2002 === FREE KEVIN The Story They Wouldn't Tell You Around the world, computer hackers are being portrayed as the newest brand of terrorists. This is a story of a hacker named Kevin Mitnick, imprisoned without bail for nearly five years. Freedom Downtime tries to uncover the reasons why the authorities are so scared of Mitnick as well as define what exactly he did. Surprisingly, no real evidence is ever presented by t he authorities to back up the sensationalist claims in mass media. But when a Hollywood studio decides to make a movie about Mitnick's life through the eyes of one of his accusers, hackers turn to activism to get their message out. Through interviews with relatives, friends, lawyers, and experts in the computer and civil liberties arena, a picture of a great injustice becomes apparent. A cross-country journey uncovers some realities of the hacker culture as well as the sobering fact that so many technically young adept people are being imprisoned.

Science fiction writer Bruce Sterling imagines how physical objects will be part of the internet as they become trackable in space and time. Bruce discusses the theoretical and technical challenges that we face as we try and think about and develop the Internet of Things. From Spimes to Thing Links to Blogjects, the terminology and verbal framing devices currently being used are pulled apart in this keynote address from the 2006 Oreilly Emerging Technology Conference. Sterling discusses at length how language shapes our understanding of technology. Phrases like Artificial Intelligence, he claims, have become frozen in time. This freezing of the language may have hindered the development of computers that have little to do with thinking and everything to do with linking, ranking and sorting. He advocates for a clash of sensibilites when coming up with proper terminology for remote technical eventualites. The Internet of Things may take up to thirty years to come about, so there is no reason to expect the terminology of today to fully describe realities of the future. Much of the talk deals with the concept of using verbal framing devices to manifest an idea. Bruce introduces us to the idea of a spime, objects that are trackable in space and time. Spimes are material instantiations of an immaterial system, digitally manufactured things from virtual plans. The Internet of Things will change how we interact with objects from the moment of invention to the moment of decay. Bruce brilliantly fits these and other concepts within the intellectual millieu of the web 2.0 world.\"\"2006.03.ETECH06.IoT.fullaudio.SanDiego\" videoInterviews2006.03\"JonnyGoldstein-DigitizedWithJonnyGoldsteinBruceSterlingAtFreedomToConn261_512kb.mp4\"001400:03:17Yes1\"Digitized With Jonny Goldstein: Bruce Sterling at Freedom to Connnect Usage Attribution-NonCommercial I had the pleasure of interviewing Bruce Sterling at David Isenberg's Freedom to Connnect conference last week.

He began publishing journalism and other non-fiction and also began work on projects related to technology and subverting traditional notions of intellectual property, such as his Dead Media Project. He also developed a strong interest in industrial design, which he has channeled into his Viridian Design project. Sterling continues to publish science-fiction novels. His most recent novel, The Zenith Angle, was published in April 2004 by Del Ray.

Google Tech Talks April 30, 2007 ABSTRACT World-renowned Science Fiction writer and futurist Bruce Sterling will outline his ideas for SPIMES, a form of ubiquitous computing that gives smarts and 'searchabiliity' to even the most mundane of physical products. Imagine losing your car keys and being able to search for them with Google Earth. This same paradigm will find you ''''wrangling'''' with product-lifecycle- management systems that do for physical objects what the iPod has done for music. These and other radical ideas are delivered in Sterling's latest book`Shaping Things'. This concise book was written to inspire designers to visualize radical scenarios connecting information technology and sustainability in a new ecology of artifacts. Sterling suggests new connections between the virtual world and the physical world that will have you rethinking many of your assumptions about how we relate to products. He will be joined by Scott Klinker, 3-D Designer-in-Residence at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, MI who leads a graduate design program known for giving form to experimental cultural ideas. Klinker's own design work focuses on digital customization as industry shifts from mass production toward niche production in a networked society. The presentation will include an invitation for Sterlling and Klinker/ Cranbrook to team-up with Google to create a short documentary film that would portray a speculative future of life with SPIMES. Distributed online, this short film would convey the look and feel of SPIME scenarios as a provocation for widespread industry discussion about the new potentials of ubiquitous, ambient, searchable, geolocative products.

I’ve been a fan of his since coming across Heavy Weather in the mid-1990’s. Climate change was not cool back then. We’re so much older than that now and the planet is so much warmer. I was delighted, and honored, when I ran into him earlier today at the FiRE Conference in San Diego and he agreed to be interviewed for Professionally Speaking. I really had no idea what he’d talk about. The last thing I expected was a discussion on the Mafiosi-like features of the European Union bureaucracy in Brussels. In fact he’s planning to set his next book in Europe. To hear him explain why he finds modern “post-national” Europe so fascinating, and why he predicts the view from across the Atlantic will soon “return to the slightly paternalistic attitude of American’s as poorly educated hay-seeds,” click on the podcast icon below\"\"2008.00.FIRE.interview.IanGriffinProffesionallySpeaking.sandiego\" audioInterviews2008.00\"unknown\"001900:20:27NO SOURCENO SOURCE\"-\"\"2008.00.Torino.onSpimes\" audioStories2008.01\"fedc98cd-89d4-45a1-a6f0-678ce0e715f4_687de065f21216790b25a95250201e9e\"003001:02:17Yes1\"http://www.starshipsofa.com/blog/2008/01/31/aural-delights-no-4-bruce-sterling/A ural Delights No 4 Bruce Sterling January 31, 2008 by StarShipSofaomments A Off Aural Delights No 4 Bruce Sterling Main Fiction: We See Things Differently by Bruce Sterling Narration: JJ Campanella Audio Player 00:00 00:00 Use Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.

Bruce basically tied together foresight research techniques, black swans theory, goldilock hypothesis, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy and the Internet to discuss a sort of attitude towards the future. Lots of people thought he was ''''ranting against'''' this weird French couple. This was not a rant by any means, rather an exemplification of the foresight method and how unexpected events as well as driving forces can be employed to described scenarios. He wanted to state that if we do not have the proper analytical tools, we won't understand it.

The conference on ''visualization of information'', organized by digital creative agency Scholz & Volkmer, is dedicated to new approaches that are being developed in the fields of design, art, architecture, new technologies and economy to confront today's complexity and to transform the immense flood of information into useable knowledge. We annually invite speakers - a broad mix of approaches, ways of thinking, industries and cultures - to present their most recent ideas on how to deal with the current flood of information, on how to visualize it and turn it into something that can be experienced. When is the visualization better than the thing? Under this headline American science fiction author Bruce Sterling questioned whether we still need physical objects at all, and whether visualizations or virtual objects might start giving us the same physical effects than real things. Sterling has been one of the founders of the 80's cyberpunk movement in science fiction, best known for his work on the ''Mirrorshades anthology''. He has been the instigator of various political and ecological projects such as the Dead Media Project - a collection of ''research notes'' on dead media technologies, the Viridian Design Movement - his attempt to create a ''green'' design movement focused on high-tech, stylish, and ecological sound design, or ''Embrace the Decay'' - an art piece commissioned by the LA Museum of Contemporary Art in 2003. Sterling has written for many magazines, including Newsweek, Fortune, or Wired, where he has been a contributing writer since its conception. He has appeared in shows like ABC's Nightline, BBS's The Late Show, CBC's Morningside, or on MTV.

Bruce Sterling was speaking at this event. One of the founders of the cyberpunk movement in science fiction, and known for creating new words or neologisms that he finds are missing, Sterling was raised in Austin, Texas, and then several years in India. Aside his extensive writing, fiction and non-fiction as well as articles, he started some interesting projects: the Dead Media Project that collects information on 'dead' media technology (http://www.deadmedia.org) and the Viridian Design Movement, that concerns itself with the creation of a 'green' high-tech design (http://www.viridiandesign.org/) that led to the Worldchanging Blog (http://www.worldchanging.com/). Since 2003, he is Professor at the European Graduate School, where he is teaching media and design. Currently based in Turin, Italy, from where he travels extensively giving speeches and attending conferences.

Soviet Unterzögersdorf (pronounced «oon-taa-tsee-gars-doorf») is the last existing appanage republic of the USSR. The enclave maintains no diplomatic relationship with the surrounding so-called «Republic of Austria» or with the Fortress «European Union». The downfall of her motherland -- the Soviet Union -- in the early 1990s had a particularly bad effect on the country’s economic situation. It is a great challenge to secure survival for the small but proud confederation. External reactionary forces put the country in danger. It’s a lack of respect due to a morally corrupted and perhaps even non-existing unity of the peoples. The goal of a glorious future is almost unreachable. But there are a handful of people who don’t give up on a vision for a better tomorrow. Let us tell you the stories of the brave citizens in the beautiful little country of Soviet Unterzögersdorf.
