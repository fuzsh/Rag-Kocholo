        "text": "Born in San Francisco, I grew up in Lucas Valley (Marin County) 15 years then, lived in Hopewell, New Jersey (between Princeton and Trenton) for 3 years, finishing high school. After graduation, chose to live in Bozeman, Montana (close to Yellowstone National Park and the Big Sky Ski Resort) for 5 years, attending Montana State University, earning degrees.\n\nAfter obtaining a Bachelor's Degree in Business (Marketing Option) along with a Minor in Communication from MSU, I lived in Terra Linda (Marin County) for 6 years, continuing Multimedia studies, working.\n\nIn 1999 I moved to central Santa Rosa (Sonoma County, the \"Heart of the Wine Country\") and lived there for 10 years, attending a quality college for additional post-graduate studies. I broadened my education studying visual media (Computer Art, Applied Graphics, Desktop Publishing, Art, Multimedia, and web design) at Santa Rosa Junior College, while working.\n\nWith regards to my 11 years of college studies and two degrees that accompany two certificates (that relate to visual media composition and presentation), I have undertaken a variety of post-graduate studies and working in local businesses, I have expanded my knowledge of various programs that are applicable to corporate establishments and gained additional skill and knowledge of Multimedia and HTML, in pursuit of an occupation that relates to promotion, advertising or marketing.\n\nI enjoyed the opportunity to develop my skills in project coordination, client services, problem solving and negotiating, applying my studies and abilities, seeking an opportunity where my experience, initiative and dedication to both personal and organizational goals will be valued.\n\nJennifer Joyce, a native of Southern California, embarked on a life of creating functional and sculptural ceramics in 1995.\n\nJoyce is a sculptor and ceramist whose body of work is both thoughtful and whimsical. She brings a unique background in dance, music, archaeology and photography to her art. As a past modern dancer and working archaeologist, Jennifer weaves lightness and whimsy, movement, dance and music into her pieces.\n\nJennifer opened her own ceramics school in Santa Monica, California in 1995 for 18 years and established another location in San Clemente in 2013. In her San Clemente studio she continued her ceramics school and also founded the Artists Studios of San Clemente, an artist studio collective that is still thriving.\n\nSince moving to Sonoma County, Jennifer has opened her private studio to teaching ceramics and sculpture, has taught numerous classes and workshops at the Sonoma Community Center, teaches for the Mentor Program and has taught part-time at the Sonoma Academy in Santa Rosa. Her emphasis is on hand building, wheel throwing and figurative sculpture.\n\nMy literary credits include 4 published poetry collections: Coyote in the Basket of My Ribs (Kelsay Books), True North and Sightings From a Star Wheel (Origami Poems Project), Down River with Li Po (Black Cat Poetry Press. Numerous stories, essays, and poems in several anthologies, podcasts, and publications including Eat the Storms III, Four Feathers Press, Golden Walkman Magazine, IceFloe Press, Nightingale and Sparrow, San Francisco Magazine, Supernatural Park, Tiny Thimble Magazine, Twist in Time, Voice of Eve.\n\nSeveral plays have been staged through Fringe of Marin Short Play Festivals (2022, 2023).\n\nI am also a former journalist (San Francisco Chronicle, Marin Independent Journal, etc.) and folklore columnist. I have written family folktale e-guides and publish quarterly 'Get Ekphrastic with Folk Art' blogs . I also create the hybrid folklore/art video series \"as the story goes' and have also facilitated a range of creative writing and folktale writing workshops in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nAs a visual artist, I work intuitively with found and recycled element. More than 30 images have appeared in literary arts journals, including 3 cover images (Chestnut Review, Feral Journal of Poetry and Art, Nightingale and Sparrow). My art has been exhibited at Santa Rosa Arts Center, Sebastopol Center for the Arts, Truckenbrod Gallery (Oregon), and Virtual Art in the Park (Petaluma)."
