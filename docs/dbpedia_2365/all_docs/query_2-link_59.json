A specific topic of interest relates to the ways in which composition pedagogy could influence these processes. This avenue of inquiry could lead to a book that represents a new way of teaching counterpoint.\n\nTeaching\n\nDr. Decker's teaching interests focus on the study of counterpoint (with respect to various historical periods) and composition. One point of emphasis concerns the way the techniques of music composition can serve as resources for effective interpretation and performance."
