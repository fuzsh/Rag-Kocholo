The event was free and open to the public.\n\nphoto by Nick Rutter\n\nThe TCAGO collaborated with the Northrop Organ Advisory Board and world-renowned organist Anna Lapwood, Associate Artist of the Royal Albert Hall in London, UK, and a strong advocate of musical education for children with “over a million followers across several social media platforms.”\n\nThis event also celebrated the 20th anniversary of the TCAGO demonstration pipe organ, “Mini Opus,” part of PipeWorks Twin Cities, a joint program of the TCAGO and Westminster Presbyterian Church in Minneapolis. Mini Opus is the product of a collaboration with Dobson Organ Builders, Schantz Organ Company, and the TCAGO. Since it arrived in Minneapolis in February of 2004, Mini Opus has traveled to audiences young and old all over the Twin Cities, parts of greater Minnesota, and Wisconsin, engaging audiences at public and private schools, churches, community centers, summer music camps, adult/continuing education programs and more.\n\nFor this celebration, Henry Dangerfield, student of Ray Johnston, performed a new composition, Gallop for Pipe Organ, by Aaron David Miller. Phil Radtke also demonstrated the Mini Opus, and Michael Barone was master of ceremonies for the event.\n\nAnna Lapwood demonstrated the Northrop Aeolian-Skinner organ and presented a grand finale of selections from her April 2 recital program at Northrop.\n\nChildren were invited to come on stage and learn first-hand about both Mini Opus and the Northrop Aeolian-Skinner organ.\n\nThis activity was made possible by the voters of Minnesota through a Minnesota State Arts Board Operating Support grant, thanks to a legislative appropriation from the Arts and Cultural Heritage Fund.\n\nEvent poster\n\nBefore Bach’s Birthday Bash\n\nSaturday, March 16, 2024\n\n9:00 a.m.–5:00 p.m. TCAGO presented the annual Before Bach’s Birthday Bash, a sequence of five hour-long concerts devoted to music by Johann Sebastian Bach, performed this year at various venues in Saint Paul.

This is life rhythm we find in the psalms and in the seasons of the Christian year. The question in a world of such contrasts in which we now find ourselves is “can the music and the deep pattern the Church’s prayer restore us to the great rhythms of life before God in our time and place?” We live with Dostoyevsky’s question: “Can beauty save us?” These reflections aim to restore the meaning and depth of our liturgical life: lament and doxology, the “full stretch” of the unfathomable riches of God in sound, sense, and ritual action.\n\nDon Saliers biography\n\nThe King’s Singers\n\nSponsored by the Bethlehem Music Series\n\nSunday, February 18, at 4:00 p.m.\n\nBethlehem Lutheran Church Twin Cities\n\n4100 Lyndale Avenue South, Minneapolis\n\nIn conjuction with the TCAGO's Professional Enrichment Day, the Bethlehem Music Series hosted the famous King's Singers of King's College, Cambridge, England and a pre-concert conversation with Steve Staruch of MPR.\n\nThe King’s Singers were formed in 1968 at King’s College in Cambridge, England and have represented the gold standard in a cappella singing on the world’s greatest stages for over fifty years.

Repertoire included Samuel Barber’s Toccata Festiva, William Bolcom’s Humoresk, Franz Liszt’s Hunnenschlacht and Joseph Jongen’s Symphonie Concertante, Op. 81. Soloists were Aaron David Miller, Brenda Sevcik, Stephen Self, and Michael Barone. William Eddins conducted.\n\nMuch to the amazement of many, including its host and producer Michael Barone, the radio program Pipedreams (also internet-accessible at www.pipedreams.org) has been in continuous national distribution by American Public Media for four decades, since October 1983. Yes, Barone had successfully offered a ‘trial balloon’ of 14 programs to the public radio system, beginning January 1982, but no thought had been given to continuation. However, continue it has, and Minnesota Public Radio celebrated Pipedreams with a 40th Anniversary Concert of music for organ and orchestra, which the Twin Cities AGO Chapter also used as a ‘season opener,’ tacking on a banquet for members afterwards.\n\nIrrepressible conductor William Eddins brilliantly led a feisty and responsive pick-up orchestra in a scintillatingly varied program that included the grand and gritty Toccata Festiva by Samuel Barber (Stephen Self, soloist), William Bolcom’s wildly jazzy Humoresk (Brenda Sevcik, soloist), Joseph Jongen’s sumptuous Symphonie Concertante, Op. 81 (Aaron David Miller, soloist), and a little-known Franz Liszt tone poem, Hunnenschlacht (Battle of the Huns, Michael Barone, obbligato organist).\n\nOn a gorgeous September afternoon, an audience of more than 1,000 flocked to Bethel University’s Benson Great Hall, with its aurally and visually compelling 67-rank Blackinton pipe organ, to enjoy music, community and cake. Following the concert; the Twin Cities AGO chapter hosted 62 members and distinguished Pipedreams guests at a catered meal that included the annual meeting and installation of officers. What a great way to get the season started! Now we work towards a 50th Pipedreams milestone?\n\nMore photos can be found on pages 5, 6, and 7 of the October issue of Pipenotes.\n\nYou can also view additional photos at the link below (photos by Steven Cohen; please allow the website a few moments to load):\n\nhttps://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B0mGq6kMgGou2FZ\n\n2022–2023\n\nTCAGO Members Recital\n\nFriday, May 12\n\nChapter members shared a variety of music on the 1970 Schlicker, renovated by Dobson in 2019 (3 manuals, 81 ranks) at Normandale Lutheran Church, Edina.

This Webinar – via Zoom – featured a panel of young church musicians. Moderated by Lutheran Summer Music church music faculty Laura Potratz and Chad Fothergill, these church musicians in their 20s, from various denominations, discussed some of the pressing cultural, stylistic, and vocational concerns of our time from their perspectives. Together, they considered such questions as:\n\nWhat do younger generations seek from the church and its liturgy?\n\nWhat is helpful or unhelpful about assumptions made on their behalf?\n\nDo words like “traditional,” “contemporary,” or \"authentic” matter?\n\nAre there discrepancies between the aspirations of young leaders and what they feel is expected of them, or between their training and experience?\n\nHow can educational organizations and institutions better equip and support new generations of leaders in changing cultural and technological contexts, especially in a post-pandemic paradigm?\n\nBefore Bach's Birthday Bash\n\nMarch 14-21, 2021 - A Virtual Event\n\nVisit the links below to hear the performances:\n\nOpening and Welcome\n\nDay 1 - March 14\n\nPascal Givot and Evan Pechacek, TCAGO Local Performers\n\nWachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 645\n\nNun komm, der Heiden Heiland, BWV 599\n\nWer nun den lieben Gott, BWV 642\n\nWenn wir in höchsten Nöten sein, BWV 641\n\nDay 2 - March 15\n\nKatie Gunn, TCAGO Local Performer\n\nPrelude and Fugue in A minor, BWV 543\n\nDay 3 - March 16\n\nSarah Palmer, TCAGO Local Performer\n\nPrelude and Fugue in A minor, BWV 544\n\nDay 4 - March 17\n\nKathrine Handford, TCAGO Local Performer\n\nHarpsichord Toccata in C minor, BWV 911\n\nDay 5 - March 18\n\nCatherine Rodland, TCAGO Local Perfomer\n\nOrgelbüchlein (Little Organ Book):\n\nO Lamm Gottes unschuldig, BWV 618\n\nChrist du Lamm Gottes, BWV 619\n\nChristus der uns selig macht, BWV 620\n\nDa Jesus am dem Kreuze stund, BWV 621\n\nO mensch bewein dein Sunde gross, BWV 622\n\nWir danke dir Herr Jesu Christ, BWV 623\n\nHilf Gott dass mirs gelinge, BWV 624\n\nChrist lag in Todesbanden, BWV 625\n\nDay 6 - March 19\n\nSamuel Long, TCAGO Local Performer\n\nToccata, Adagio & Fugue in C, BWV 564\n\nDay 7 - March 20\n\nSamuel Backman & Adrian Volovets, TCAGO Local Performers\n\nPassacaglia and Fugue in C minor, BWV 582\n\nDay 8 - March 21\n\nHappy Birthday, Johann Sebastian Bach!\n\nWe hope you’ve been able to share in our multifaceted \"Before Bach’s Birthday Bash\" feast.

It reflects on the nuance of change and the seemingly perpetual challenge and amazement that the works of Bach have presented to performers from Day One. I don’t pretend that my insights are profound but do hope they stir up your thinking. We’ve learned a lot in the 36 years since the Bach Tercentenary, and likely will continue with new discoveries and approaches to his music in the years to come. It will be, as has been proven, an infinite resource and treasure.

Counted as on of the most influential German composers of his time, composing a staggering body of works during his short lifetime which exhibited his retrospective yet highly celebrated modern style. Arnold Schönberg famously extolled Reger, saying “I consider him a genius.”\n\nPROGRAM:\n\nIntroduction and Passacaglia in d, (without opus); DAVID FIENEN, organ\n\nBenedictus, Op. 59, no. 9; PETER VANDERWAAL, organ\n\n3 Chorale-preludes, fr Op. 67 (No. 41, Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme; No. 14, Herzlich tut mich verlangen; No. 49, Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern); JOHN SCHULTZ, organ\n\nClarinet Sonata No. 1 in A-flat, Op. 49, no. 1; PAUL SCHIMMING, clarinet; STEPHEN SELF, piano\n\nAve Maria, Op. 80, no. 5; BILL CHOUINARD, organ\n\nToccata & Fugue in a, Op. 80, nos. 11/12; JACOB BENDA, organ\n\nBACH (transcription by Reger): Allegro (i.), fr Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 in F, BWV 1047; PHILIP and CHRISTOPHER BRUNELLE, piano\n\nSongs with Organ Accompaniment [fr Geistliche Lieder, Opus 102 (No. 1, Ich sehe dich in tausend Bildern; No. 2, Meine Seele ist still zu Gott); Wenn in bangen trüben Stunden; Wohl denen, die ohne Tadel leben].

Bach, including the \"Little Fugue in g minor,\" at King of Grace Lutheran School in Golden Valley. Mini Opus, our demonstration instrument, was put to good use. We started with third and fourth grade students, and then added the fifth grade and some adult students as more became intrigued with learning about the \"King of Instruments.\"\n\nBefore Bach's Birthday Bash\n\nOn March 19, 2016, the Twin Cities Chapter of the American Guild of Organists (TCAGO.org) in conjunction with the Bach Society of Minnesota, the Twin Cities Early Music Festival, and Classical Minnesota Public Radio, presented a day-long Before Bach’s Birthday Bash, a sequence of hour-long concerts at churches along Summit Avenue in Saint Paul (MN) honoring both J.S.B. (born 3/21/1685) and his foremost ‘student’, Max Reger (b. 3/19/1873). Enjoy some pictures from the day’s activities!\n\nA big THANK YOU to our performers and technical teams for making these events happen successfully. We estimate roughly 450 people enjoyed music throughout the day, and a large number of them were with us for the entire sequence of five concerts. Roughly 300 attended the final concert at The House of Hope Presbyterian Church. Great thanks to Michael Barone who compiled, produced, programmed and hosted this wonderful day celebrating J.S.B. and Reger.\n\nSeveral photos can be seen below; however check out our Facebook page for many more photos and descriptions. Note: you do not need to hold a Facebook account to view these photos.)\n\nConcert #1\n\nAt our first venue, the Saint Paul Seminary Chapel, the audience listened attentively to some early morning counterpoint. This hour was broadcast live by Classical MPR.\n\nConcert #2\n\nThe second Before Bach’s Birthday Bash concert took place at 10:30 a.m. in the St. Thomas Aquinas Chapel of the University of St. Thomas in Saint Paul, MN, and featured the elegant 56-rank Gabriel Kney organ (1987).\n\nConcert #3\n\nAfter a lunch break, at 1 p.m. we visited the intimate Episcopal Church of St. Clement on Portland Avenue and heard performances featuring its 26-rank Aeolian-Skinner organ (1964).\n\nConcert #4\n\nAfter a few-blocks walk from St. Clement’s, our 2:30 p.m. program took place at Unity Unitarian Church on Holly Avenue, featuring the 44-rank Noack organ (1965), the first modern three-manual mechanical-action instrument installed west of the Mississippi. We had a decent post-lunch audience here!\n\nConcert #5\n\nFor the final event at 4 o’clock, the sun had come out and we walked a block from Unity to The House of Hope Presbyterian Church, where the landmark 97-rank C.B. Fisk organ (1979) was put through its paces. A very nice audience showed up for this truly grand finale!\n\nIt was a great day, from beginning to end. Join us next year for the next Before Bach’s Birthday Bash (3/18/2017…venues TBD).\n\nThe Twin Cities Early Music Festival Ensemble (Clea Galhano & Alan Kolderie, recorders; Margaret Humphrey & Miriam Scholz-Carlson, violins; Ginna Watson, viola; Tulio Rondon, cello; Sara Thompson, bass; Donald Livingston, harpsichord) played the first movement of Bach’s Harpsichord Concerto No. 6 in F, BWV 1057 (which is a transposition and slight rearrangement of the Brandenburg Concerto No. 4 in G).\n\nPerformers included (left to right): Adrian Volovets (private student of Kevin Seal, who played his own transcription of two Motets from Reger’s Opus 138, Nachtlied and Der Mensch lebt und bestehet); Sharon Kleckner (who played three pieces from Reger’s Opus 59…Gloria, Melodia, and Te Deum); Joel Kumro (student of Kim Kasling at St. John’s University, who played Bach’s Prelude & Fugue in E-flat, BWV 552); Joanne Rodland (who played Bach’s Wenn wir in höchsten Nöten sein, BWV 668); and Kalle Akkerman (who played Bach’s Piece d’orgue in G, BWV 572).\n\nLeft-to-right: Twin Cities free-lancers flutist Hannah Peterson Green and organist Joseph Trucano played the Sonata in E-flat, BWV 1031. (There is some question whether this piece was compose by JSB, and possibly by Carl Philip Emmanuel Bach…but that middle movement…is it by CPE, really?) Resident musician Nils Halker played Bach’s Prelude & Fugue in C, BWV 545 and three Reger chorale-preludes from Opus 67 (O Welt, ich muss dich lassen, Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, and Schmücke dich, o liebe Seele). Julie Yoonjeong Kim (University of Minnesota student of Dean Billmeyer) played Reger’s Toccata & Fugue in d, Opus 129, nos. 1 and 2. Cynthia Rapacke Betz played Bach’s chorale-prelude Von Got will ich nicht lassen, BWV 658. And David Fienen played two additional Bach chorale-preludes (An Wasserflüssen Babylon, BWV 653 and Allein Gott in der Höh, BWV 663).\n\nWe also enjoyed a performance on Unity’s Mason & Hamlin grand piano by Fanya Lin (U of MN student of Lydia Artymew) of Bach’s Prelude & Fugue in F-sharp-minor, BWV 833 (WTC Book 2), and Lindsay Schlemmer (from Hour One, previously depicted) provided two additional movements from the Reger Solo Cello Suite No. 3.\n\nOur organists at Unity included (l to r) Tom Ferry (from Como Park Lutheran) playing a set of three Bach pieces (Fugue in G-minor, BWV 578, plus chorale-preludes Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland, BWV 659, and Nun danket alle Gott, BWV 657); Andrew Hackett (from Hennepin Avenue United Methodist, Minneapolis) who played Bach’s Prelude & Fugue in B-minor, BWV 544; and Bruce Jacobs (technician at Twin Cities Public Television) who played a set of Bach Orgelbüchlein chorale-preludes (In Dir ist Freude, Christe, du Lamm Gottes, Alle Menschen müssen sterben and Komm, Gott Schöpfer, heiliger Geist).\n\nHere are the organists for the final event. Back row, left: Noah Klein (a high-school student from Northfield (private student of Kevin Seal, and finalist in this year’s MPR Varsity Competition) played Bach’s Prelude & Fugue in C, BWV 547, which itself was an interesting prelude to the Art of Fugue selections by Ms. Lin. Back row, right: Joel Kumro, making an encore appearance, this time playing Reger’s lovely Benedictus, Op. 59, no. 9 (with registration assist by ADM).\n\nAnd, seated front and center at the Fisk console, in his splendid Chicago casual spring garb, the incredible Aaron David Miller, who literally raised the roof with Reger's Opus 46. Wow! This piece provided as fine a tribute as could be paid the Baroque master J.S.B. And Aaron’s performance, played with such stupendous brio (and self-registered, too, on the Fisk without any significant registration aids!), provided a wonderful and fitting birthday tribute to Reger in this year of the centenary of his death (d. 5/11/1916).\n\nUniversity of Minnesota pianist Chun-Han Sophia Lin (a student of Alexander Braginsky) astonished us with her from-memory performance of several movements from Bach’s Art of Fugue (Contrapuncti IX, X, XI and XIV). That final fugue, left incomplete by Bach at the point where he stated his name with the motive B-flat/A/C/B-natural (B-A-C-H in German musical notation), was a perfect prelude to our day’s last music, Reger’s monumental Fantasy and Fugue on B-A-C-H, Opus 46.\n\nPipe Organ Discovery Day 2016\n\nA day of discovery for young music students was a great success, once again. Many thanks to TCAGO members Phil Asgian, Pamela Carlson, Margaret Gohman, Bjorn Gustafson, Phillip Radtke, and Michael Barone for volunteering your time and talents to the event. This year, an organ dedication was part of the event during the afternoon session. There were several students new this year to PODD, as well as several participants from previous PODDs. Eighteen students and 12 adults participated in the morning event, and about a dozen members of the congregation came after the PODD and before the dedication to learn more about the instruments. Thank you to all our participants and parents for your interest in the pipe organ!\n\n2016 Widor a Success!\n\nThe Twin Cities American Guild of Organists (TCAGO) was pleased to present a WIDOR FESTIVAL illuminating the music of Charles-Marie Widor (1844-1937) from January 24 through February 7, 2016 featuring The Bakken Trio; Choral and Organ Music at the Cathedral of Saint Paul; a Lecture by Widor Biographer John Near; and Symphony No. 3, Opus 69 for Organ and Orchestra.\n\nWe sincerely thank ALL who worked so diligently to put this expansive WIDOR FESTIVAL together: especially the brainstorm of a “good idea” by the TCAGO program committee (David Jenkins, Michael Barone, Bob Luther, Bob Vickery, Kraig Windschitl, and Jeremy Haug). The event could not have been executed successfully without the host locations, choirs, organists, conductors, performers and promoters for successfully doing their part with grace and commitment.\n\nOur deepest appreciation and respect to John Near, around whom the idea grew while providing intriguing content and context throughout.\n\nPublic participation was also very good through the entire festival: nearly sold-out crowd at the Bakken Trio concert, a very notable crowd on Friday night at the Cathedral; sufficient intimate bunch Saturday morning, and astonishing on Sunday afternoon.\n\nA snapshot of photos is provided below.
