        "text": "OLTL History 1990-2000\n\n1990\n\nReeling from the news that his son was really dead and that \"Rick\" was actually Brenda McGillis's Steven, Michael Grande tried to escape the country with the boy, before being apprehended. Brenda, understanding Michael's pain, did not press charges against him for kidnapping Steven, but took her son back with glee. Michael began a plan to win him back.\n\nMichael decided to marry Brenda and thereby make Steven his son again. He wined and dined Brenda but found Dan Wolek to be a constant thorn in his side. Dan still had strong feelings for Brenda, even though she proclaimed she wanted nothing to do with him. In the end, Michael found it necessary to drug Brenda in order to keep her in line. He did so by means of a small medicated patch which he attached to the back of her ear. Brenda immediately became groggy and disoriented and allowed Michael to do anything he wanted. When Brenda married Michael, Andy Harrison and a heartbroken Dan Wolek dated several times, but Dan's eyes remained focused on Brenda.\n\nAfter Max took a bullet meant for her, Gabrielle made a pact with God: If the Almighty allowed Max to survive, then Gabrielle swore that she would devote her life to the church. Miraculously, Max rallied and recovered, and Gabrielle decided to become a nun! Max discovered Gabrielle's whereabouts and raced to the convent. He caught up to her on the convent lawn where he forced her to declare her love for him. The night air was thick with passion as Max kissed Gabrielle again. This time, she couldn't resist. They sank down to the ground and, by the light of the full moon, made love on the convent lawn.\n\nAfter making love again, the reunited lovers drifted off to sleep in each other's arms. During the night, Gabrielle woke up screaming because the nightmare of Max, consumed in flames, had returned. Soon, her fears were realized. On the way to pick up a wedding ring, Max crashed his car into a tree. Gabrielle learned that Max's charred corpse had been pulled from the fiery wreckage, but in actuality, Max Holden was alive! It was a hitchhiker Max picked up by who died in the blazing wreckage. Max decided to allow his friends and family to believe he was dead, rather than put them through the agony of living with his deformity.\n\nFather Tony Vallone proved a valuable friend to Gabrielle in her time of grief. These were difficult times for Tony, because he had fallen in love with Gabrielle, but fought his feelings to remain committed to the church.\n\nIn time, Gabrielle fell in love again, too -- with a newcomer, Matt Kingston.He reminded her so much of her beloved Max because Matt Kingston really was Max! He had undergone extensive cosmetic surgery and returned to town to woo Gabrielle. Eventually, Max confessed his true identity to Gabrielle, and they married in a beautiful ceremony, presided over by a conflicted Father Tony. Father Tony's feelings for Gabrielle were far were resolved.\n\nMax discovered that years earlier, Asa cheated his father Wingate out of land that was rich with oil and Max swore revenge! Gabrielle found out that Asa slept with Max's mother about the time Max was conceived. She wondered: could Max be Asa's son? To her disappointment, the greedy Mrs. Holden discovered that Max was not Asa's son. Wanting the Buchanan money and power, she bribed an old midwife, Du Ann Demerest, to claim that Asa fathered Max! Hearing the news, Asa was shocked that Max was his flesh and blood. Asa wanted to do right by him, but Max rejected his \"father.\"\n\nFather Tony caught Gabrielle embezzling funds from Outlook House. In order to keep him quiet about her many financial indiscretions, Gabrielle seduced Tony.\n\nJust as Max and Gabrielle were getting together -- Cord and Tina's second marriage was falling apart! Cord had finally had enough of Tina's lies and deceits. The final straw came when Tina became jealous of Cord's platonic friendship with Gabrielle's sweet young ballerina sister, Debra. When Cord demanded a divorce, Tina took their son, C.J., and moved to San Diego. Tina couldn't stay away for long, and returned later that year.\n\nMegan returned with her sister Sarah to Mendorra to help her former love, Prince Raymond, who was having a difficult time dealing with his blindness. Raymond's jealous and power-hungry younger brother, Roland, wanted the crown for himself so he plotted to use Megan and Sarah as pawns in his quest. Roland held Megan and Sarah against their will. Fearing for Sarah and Megan's safety, the good prince, Raymond, had no choice but to acquiesce to his wicked brother's demands.\n\nWith Cord by his side, Bo rushed to Mendorra to rescue his lady love. In Mendorra, Bo and Cord teamed up with Ambassador Dorian Lord, her daughter Cassie and Debra Medina (who was appearing with the Mendorran Ballet) to infiltrate the Royal Palace. A despondent Sarah was about to reluctantly marry Prince Raymond, but Sarah couldn't believe her eyes when she realized that the bearded man in full military regalia standing next to her at the altar was Bo -- disguised as Raymond! She joyously spoke her vows and married her \"prince.\" Just after the ceremony, the bride and groom raced out of the castle, and made it to freedom! Raymond (who miraculously regained his eyesight in the nick of time) had no choice but to shoot and kill his wayward brother.\n\nIn a close election, Viki Buchanan narrowly defeated Herb Callison and was elected the new Mayor of Llanview. Viki vowed to stamp out drugs in Llanview --- drugs that were being distributed by Michael Grande and Llanview's new crime boss, Carlo Hesser. Soon after the election, Viki and Clint mended their relationship.\n\nMichael also continued his illegal business dealings. He hired two ex-cons by the name of Jake Harrison (he originally went by the name Jake Webb) and Lucky Lippman to do his dirty work. Megan encountered a man who would quickly change her life. His name was Jake Harrison and he was a fugitive from the law! Jake headed to Llanview to confront his boss, Michael, who warned Jake that he turn him in, unless Jake spied on Megan Gordon. Jake had another connection to Llanview - Andy Harrison was his half-sister! Megan discovered Jake's charade, but he talked his way out of the predicament by telling her that he was a writer for a soap opera magazine. Jake said he had been hired to get the scoop on her! Megan fell for Jake's lies -- and Jake fell in love with his prey!\n\nLittle Steven fell ill and was rushed to the hospital. Dan and Larry were shocked to discover the little boy had been drugged. Dan, recalling Brenda's odd behavior of late, surmised that Steven may have touched a medicated patch if it had been located on Brenda's body. He rushed to Grandview (Michael's mansion) and found Brenda unconscious in the foyer. Michael, in the meantime, was anxiously awaiting Steven's release from the hospital. He was leaving the country for good and taking Brenda's baby with him.\n\nMichael Grande was killed at Llanview Hospital. Larry and Viki barged in the lounge to find Michael dead of a bullet wound to the chest. Suspects abounded everywhere: Megan, was the prime suspect of course, but there was groggy Brenda who was also in the hospital, after having been brought in by Dan, there was Dan himself, and Jake, and Lucky, and Gabrielle... D.A. Herb Callison launched a major investigation and Jake and Megan became prime suspects. Megan was charged with the crime and stood trial. She was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Gathering together all the suspects, Jake revealed that Roger Gordon, before lapsing into his coma, killed Michael in self-defense. Megan was free at last!\n\nBrenda was finally free with her son, and told Dan goodbye before leaving Llanview for good.\n\nCarlo Hesser's son, Johnny Dee, ordered Llanview's corrupt Police Commissioner Harding to assassinate Viki. During a fund raiser, Harding shot Viki. While recovering from the bullet wound, she suffered a stroke that rendered her speechless and paralyzed.\n\nCord's life was rather calm until he found himself trapped with some of his friends on Badderley Island. Also on the island were some members of the mob involved in high level negotiations. Reluctantly part of that group was Tina. She had run herself into debt to Johnny Dee, and was acting as her own collateral. She was thrilled to once again see Cord, and they slipped into old habits. But she also worked to find a way to keep Johnny from knowing that Cord, etc. were on the island. To distract him, they made love.\n\nMeanwhile, things were getting ugly between the mosters as they continued conducting business. It was revealed that one of the mobsters was actually Marco Dane in disguise, up to one of his famous plots. When he saw Megan, Marco instantly vowed to protect her should anything go wrong. Later, Megan nearly drowned in the undertow surrounding Badderly, but Marco saved her. Megan and Jake also encountered a formidable foe to their budding romance: Carlo's daughter Charlotte, who took an immediate fancy to Jake and did her best to win him over. With time running out and the mobsters suddenly wondering if their American guests were really who they claimed to be, help came. Bo and Sarah, Megan and Jake, Cord and Tina and others returned to Llanview breathless, while Carlo, Johnny and Charlotte were not far behind. Marco, realizing that Jake and Megan were happy with each other, decided not to interfere further and rode off into the sunset.\n\nFinally rescued from the island, Cord and Tina both returned to Llanview. Tina soon discovered she was pregnant -- and didn't know who the father was. She mistakenly believed that her child was Johnny's, and Cord, in true form, agreed to raise and love the child as his own. When Johnny learned of the baby, he tried to kidnap Tina from Llanfair. Johnny was killed by the paralyzed Viki, who turned into Niki Smith Niki regained the use of her legs, and climbed the mansion stairs to shoot Johnny just before he dragged Tina away.\n\nJohnny's death stoked the flames of hatred for the Buchanans that burned in Carlo Hesser. He vowed to avenge his son's death. A tape recording of the shooting revealed that Niki shot Johnny and that Gabrielle Holden was present at the crime scene. Carlo, learning that Viki/Niki killed his son, enlisted Gabrielle's aid in exacting his revenge against the Buchanans. Carlo convinced the pregnant Tina to give up Johnny's baby to him. Gabrielle at first refused to ally herself with Carlo Hesser, but when Carlo videotaped the married Gabrielle seducing Father Tony, she had no choice but to reluctantly agree to work with Carlo.\n\nTerrified for the safety of her family, Tina fled to Texas, where she went into labor during a blizzard. Cord followed Tina and announced, as he assisted in the delivery of a daughter, that medical tests had proven that he (and not Johnny Dee) was the father of the child. Elated, Cord, Tina and their newborn daughter, Sarah, returned to Llanview and remarried yet again. Max, ashamed and disheartened to learn of his wife's indiscretions, broke up with Gabrielle. Carlo, beaten for the moment, vowed to make his enemies pay!\n\nBo and agent Alex Olanov of the Federal Anti-crime Bureau, continued to search for Sarah, who had been kidnapped by Carlo. Megan and Jake engineered a plan for Jake to get close to Charlotte Hesser, Carlo's daughter, in the hope that she might have information about Sarah's whereabouts. Megan and Jake staged a public breakup, but managed to sneak away to Viki's mountain cabin, where they shared a symbolic wedding ceremony. After spending the night together, they returned to Llanview. Carlo realized that Jake was only using his daughter. Jake agreed to marry Charlotte to protect his family from Carlo's revenge.\n\nWhen Charlotte developed hysterical blindness following a car accident, Jake decided that he couldn't ask her for a divorce. Megan buried her pain by hooking up with an old boyfriend, movie director Hunter Guthrie, who came to Llanview to film a movie.\n\nAlex discovered that Bo's wife had been kidnapped by the very agency that sent Alex to find her! Bo confronted the head of the FAB, Fred Porter, and learned that in exchange for protection from prosecution, Carlo promised to inform the FAB on worldwide drug-trafficking activities.\n\nWhile Sarah was spirited away by her captors, her plane crashed in a severe storm. The Buchanans were convinced that Carlo Hesser was responsible for Sarah's inadvertent death.\n\n1991\n\nLove blossomed for many couples in 1991. Viki's physical therapist, beautiful and bright Sheila Price, met Police Commissioner Troy Nichols, and was thrilled when their love blossomed and Troy proposed marriage. Meanwhile, Troy's rapper son, Kerry Nichols, hated Sheila's young and impressionable little sister, Rika Price. But surprisingly, Kerry and Rika's passionate disgust turned into passionate love, and they became a couple.\n\nDan Wolek rescued troubled Laura Jean from a suicide attempt at the Llantano River. It wasn't long before the young couple fell in love. After Dan and Laura helped Kerry and Rika outsmart some troublemakers, Dan and Laura left town happy and in love.\n\nAfter realizing they couldn't recapture their high school love, Viki bid farewell to Roger Gordon, who left Llanview to work on environmental research.\n\nLlanview's Mayor Viki Buchanan became a target of Carlo Hesser's wrath when she interfered with his drug operations. To eliminate Viki, the mobster ordered his cohort Gabrielle to slip a potent drug into Viki's drink. The drug would turn Viki into Niki, and get her to kill her own daughter, Megan. But Gabrielle could not go through with the scheme. Instead, she prepared to testify against Carlo in court. However, when Carlo threatened her son's life, Gabrielle remained silent, Carlo remained free, and Gabrielle was sentenced to fifteen years in Statesville Prison.\n\nEventually, Carlo followed through with his diabolical scheme, but Viki was able to exert enough control over her alter ego to prevent Megan's murder. Carlo's scheme had failed!\n\nMax became fond of Lee Ann Demerest, the naive daughter of Du Ann, the midwife who birthed him. Du Ann was aware of the secret that Max was not really Asa's son. Du Ann planned to use the information to her own advantage. Proud of his newfound heritage, Max decided to change his name to Buchanan.\n\nRenee tried to hide the secret from Asa by allowing herself to be blackmailed by Du Ann, who threatened to tell the truth. When DuAnn was killed, Renee went on trial for murder. Julia Medina eventually confessed to the crime. Max learned the truth about his parentage and returned to using Holden as his last name, and eventually decided to leave Llanview and return to his roots in Texas to soothe his tortured soul.\n\nCassie Callison returned to town to attend the swearing-in ceremony for her father, Herb, who replaced Viki as the Mayor of Llanview. Bo ran into Cassie at the airport and was immediately charmed by her poise, her beauty, and her zest for life. They attended the swearing in party together and when Alex saw them dancing and laughing together, she fled in a jealous rage. As Bo and Cassie began to spend more and more time together, Alex's behavior became more erratic. Alex's unrequited love for Bo drove her to desperate measures. Dorian was furious at Cassie! How could her only daughter fall in love with a Buchanan? The ever-scheming Ms. Lord plotted with Alex to break up the lovers.\n\nWhen Bo and Cassie decided to take a vacation, Alex followed them and kidnaped Cassie! Hauling her to a nearby boat, Alex ordered Cassie to row into the middle of the lake, where Alex tried to drown her! Fortunately, Bo rescued Cassie and Alex. Totally unhinged, Alex was taken away to the Mountainview Clinic.\n\nBo proposed to Cassie and she joyfully accepted. As the wedding day grew closer, a mysterious phone call from a woman who sounded like Sarah alarmed Bo. Then, Cassie opened a package containing a negligee worn by Sarah on her honeymoon. Was Sarah alive --- or was someone gaslighting Bo? The culprit turned out to be Alex --- who had escaped from the sanitarium!\n\nTo Cassie's devastation, Sarah was indeed alive. She threw her arms around Bo, unaware that he had just married another woman! The plane crash that supposedly killed her had been staged by Carlo Hesser's henchmen and she had been held for months at a deserted beach house. Alex, having discovered her whereabouts, brought her back to Llanview to spoil the most wonderful day of Cassie's life.\n\nBo was torn between his new wife, Cassie, and Sarah. Sarah was crushed when he decided to stay with Cassie. Alex, meanwhile, was shipped back to the mental institution.\n\nWhen Jake discovered Charlotte's eyesight returned, he got a divorce from her and launched a successful quest to win back Megan's affections. Before long, they were engaged to be married!\n\nJake and Megan were married, but not before one last attempt by Jake's former wife, Charlotte, to stop the wedding. Sneaking into the Lord Library, Charlotte stole Megan's wedding dress! Fortunately, Megan quickly tracked her down and retrieved the gown before Charlotte could burn it. The wedding was on!\n\nFollowing the ceremony, the newlyweds led their loved ones out to the sprawling emerald green lawn of St. James Church, where they planted a tree as a symbol of their happiness. Then, with the guests bidding a fond adieu, a horse-drawn carriage whisked Jake and Megan away for their honeymoon.\n\nAndy and Megan's ex-beau, Hunter Guthrie began to realize they had deep feelings for one another. They were happy to have time to slowly develop their relationship. However, the plans were altered when Hunter, a film director, was forced to return to Hollywood right away. In a whirlwind series of events, Hunter proposed, Andy accepted, and they were married in a beautiful ceremony presided over by Mayor Herb Callison.\n\nSadly, Jake and Megan's happiness was short-lived. Jake became more obsessed than ever with being the breadwinner in his new family, and took an arms-trading job that required him to travel the world. Megan, sensing danger, begged her new husband to stay home, but Jake assured her that he would only be gone a short time. However months passed, with only an occasional phone call from Jake.\n\nCon artist Cain Rogan first appeared in Llanview -- as three different men! First disguised as Hudson King, an oily and charming British writer, next as Heinrich Keiser, a German film director, and finally, as traveling businessman Humberto Kalderon. Each con was an attempt to aide Dorian in toppling the Buchanans and getting control of Asa's money.\n\nTina soon devised another one of her patented, destined-to-fail plans. She was going to write a book about the trials and tribulations of the Lord/Buchanan families. Publisher Hudson King offered her a stunning salary for the work and Tina began spending a lot of time with him in his apartment in New York.\n\nWhen Cord discovered the truth about Hudson King really being Cain Rogan, he had a tough time convincing Tina of it. They staged a scene to smoke Hudson out. Cord would play the jealous husband and barge in on Tina and Hudson; when he saw what they were doing, he would pull out a gun in fury and fire a blank at Tina, who would then play dead. The ruse worked: Cord \"shot\" Tina and then threatened to kill Hudson, who hurriedly admitted he was not Hudson after all. Cord had saved Tina from herself yet again.\n\nPuppy love thrived for young Kevin Buchanan and Stephanie Hobart, the orphaned niece of the Buchanan family's archenemy, Carlo Hesser. Viki and Clint pleaded with their son to stay away from her, since they didn't want the family tangled up any more with Carlo Hesser than they already were. But Kevin and Stephanie were not to be kept apart, even by Jason Webb, Wanda Wolek's motorcycle riding free-spirit nephew, who also became infatuated with her. Stephanie's Uncle Carlo was also adamant that she stay away from Kevin, but she was so lonely that she didn't listen.\n\nWhen Carlo angrily sent Stephanie away, Megan helped her half-sibling track her down. But Stephanie was not allowed to return to Llanview and Kevin was heartbroken. That all changed, however, when he laid eyes upon the beautiful Lee Ann Demerest. Kevin lost his virginity to the sexy Texas lass and by the end of the year, LeeAnn was pregnant with his child.\n\nStill, Lee Ann cared more for Max Holden, who returned to Llanview after discovering that Asa Buchanan had bilked Max's father, Wingate Holden out of the deed to his land. The stress of that situation caused the senior Holden to die of a heart attack. Now, Max was back to seek the ultimate revenge on Asa.\n\nA May-December affair began when Dorian lured Wanda Wolek's long-haired nephew, Jason Webb into her bed. Dorian seduced Jason, but she was never able to tame his wild, rebellious ways. Jason, even while he was fulfilling Dorian's wildest fantasies, had his eye on Lee Ann as well.\n\nMegan Gordon had developed a case of lupus, a sometimes crippling disease. Megan was thunderstruck: without her true love Jake Harrison there to support her, she felt as if her world were crumbling down. Ignoring everyone's attempts to help her, Megan bolted town and ended up in Atlantic City, where she pledged that the lupus wouldn't run her life. She then proceeded to get drunk and have the time of her life in the casino. It was here she ran into a man by the name of Heinrich Kaiser, a German filmmaker who instantly took to Megan and later followed her home to Llanview.\n\nSoon after, Tina and Heinrich met in the lobby of the Palace Hotel and the secret was out: Heinrich was really Hudson King - the publisher who tried to profit off Tina's story months ago. And not only that - but Hudson King wasn't even his real name - it was Humberto Kaldaron, and he was a Spanish businessman.\n\nOf course, it was later revealed that his name was Cain Rogan, and he was nothing more than a clever con-artist. Megan felt betrayed, but as her condition continued to worsen, she could do little more than pray for Jake's safe return and spend as much time as possible with Andrew.\n\nViki suspected that her husband Clint was having an affair with a co-worker, Sondra. Finally confronting him, Viki was stunned to hear Clint's confession that Sondra was only helping him come to grips with his impending death. Clint confessed to Viki that the bullet fragments in his head had shifted, and doctors had told him that he only had a few months to live. Giving in to his family's heartfelt request, Clint underwent risky surgery, and made a full recovery.\n\nSheila felt she was experiencing bigotry at the hospital, so Tina decided to familarize her with the community, first by inroducing her to the Daughters of Llanview, a snooty organization of wealthy wives. During the party Tina was throwing, a figure in parachute gear descended from the skies. Shocked, Tina ran to the figure and was met by the sparkling smile and captivating Southern-twang of Luna Moody, a new-age Goddess worshipper.\n\nLuna made quick friends with Tina, Sheila, and Lee Ann, and fell instantly in love with Max Holden. They shared a special connection, an extrasensory bond that few friends ever achieve. However, But while Luna was falling for Max, his eyes were set on a new arrival in town, the beguiling Blair Daimler, who he encountered during a sexy midnight dance on New Years Eve. Blair was living across the hall from Luna at the boarding house with her mother Addie.\n\nUnaware that she was Dorian's niece, Viki hired Blair to be her new assistant at The Banner. Blair was harboring more than her share of secrets. For one, she hid her crazy mother, Addie, in her loft at the local boarding house. Unbeknownst to anyone, Addie was Dorian's older sister, who had been institutionalized for years. Blair blamed her Aunt Dorian for her mother's illness, and secretly came to Llanview to get revenge. One of her first devious moves designed to destroy Dorian was to get her signature on a document admitting to the world that she had killed her husband, Victor Lord, back in 1976. Dorian had no idea that the piece of paper she signed was a confession of her guilt!\n\nWorking at The Banner, Blair crossed paths with Cord Roberts. There was an attraction between the two, and even though they kissed, Cord remained true to his wife Tina. Cord and Blair found Jake in the middle eastern city of Jaba, but were lured into a trap set by the evil General Gaza. Jake was recaptured and Cord was shot in the chest and fell into the Jaba River. Blair dove in after him, but his lifeless body was swept away in the rushing current. Returning to Llanview, she had no choice but to tell Tina the numbing news that her dear husband Cord was dead. From that moment on, Blair and Tina were mortal enemies.\n\nWithout Jake to help her in her time of need, Megan turned to the kindly and wise Reverend Andrew Carpenter, the minister at St. James Church. He became her dearest friend. At the same time, Andrew's feelings grew into something much more. As the year came to an end, Reverend Carpenter found himself facing a heartbreaking dilemma. He had fallen in love with the very-married Megan Harrison.\n\n1992\n\nMegan Harrison was determined not to let lupus destroy her life. In the hospital, she befriended fellow lupus patient Margaret (Marty) Saybrooke, a beautiful, wealthy and very unhappy young woman. Megan offered Marty the friendship she so desperately coveted.\n\nWhen Megan suffered kidney failure, Viki bravely donated one of her kidneys, but the transplant did not take. Clint joined Viki in a valiant effort to keep Megan alive until Jake could be located in Jaba and brought back to Llanview. Viki, Clint, along with the rest of the Buchanans and Max Holden, sat by Megan's bedside and told her glorious tales about the times of their lives.\n\nAndrew made a daring journey to Jaba to rescue Jake. In the process, the kindhearted minister of the church was forced to shoot and kill Jake's captor, General Gaza. As the General fell to the ground, mortally wounded, he pulled out a knife and stabbed Andrew in the side. Hiding his bleeding injury from Jake, the two men made their escape, rushing back to Llanview. Jake and Megan shared several bittersweet hours together. He carried her to the window, where she peered out onto the hospital lawn. There, with glimmering paper valentines hanging from its branches, was their transplanted wedding tree. Megan's face radiated with one last smile as she passed away in her beloved Jake's arms. Her funeral was held several days later, with heartfelt tributes by Viki, Clint, Renee, Tina, Sarah, Roger Gordon, Andrew, Jake and even Asa. Then Sheila stood up and sang the song that Megan had made Andrew promise to play -- \"Dancing in the Streets.\"\n\nBo eventually returned to Sarah and his marriage to Cassie was annulled. During a flashback, Sarah realized that she had witnessed Carlo Hesser killing a man during her months in captivity. Sarah could only remember the dying man's last word: \"Scarecrow.\"\n\nIn jail for attacking Cassie, Alex Olanov hunted for another way to escape. She found it in District Attorney Hank \"The Cannon\" Gannon. Hank was looking for a way to prosecute Carlo Hesser and Alex promised she could deliver the evidence he needed -- but she would only do so from the outside. Ambitious Hank was not sure Alex was completely sane, but when a judge found her to be so, Hank agreed reluctantly to the arrangement: her freedom for irrefutable evidence of Carlo Hesser's guilt. Released at last, Alex directed Hank to incriminating tapes hidden in a scarecrow at Carlo's cottage. Ecstatic, Hank wasted no time in bringing Carlo Hesser to court.\n\nBut Alex made her own deal with Carlo: she wanted money and power, and he could deliver both. Alex told Carlo that if he married her, she would destroy Hank's evidence against him and Carlo would be free. Not at all happy about the arrangement, Alex and Carlo wed (now Alex, as his wife, was not required to testify against him in court). At the trial, when Hank went to play the incriminating tapes, the coutroom was filled with the lively beats of rock and roll. Carlo and Alex exchanged a knowing glance and Carlo was freed.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Hesser began a short and kinky marriage marked by frequent sex -- and lots of their favorite aphrodisiac, oysters! While searching for missing diamonds that belonged to him, Carlo was shot to death in Max Holden's attic. Sarah became the prime suspect.\n\nDistrict Attorney Hank \"The Cannon\" Gannon presented a strong and convincing case against Sarah and she was found guilty of murder. Bo, convinced of her innocence, eventually found the real killer -- Carlo's niece, Stephanie. It turned out that Stephanie had apparently killed Carlo in a fit of rage after discovering that he had murdered her own father, FBI informant Joseph Hobart -- A.K.A. \"The Scarecrow.\"\n\nBy 1992, Tina moved on with con man Cain Rogan -- they had both been subjected to Alex Olanov and Carlo Hesser's wrath and were now looking for a way to get back at Alex. They decided to steal the Cleopatra jewels and set Alex up for the crime. But the plan backfired -- Alex, posing as a cleaning lady, lured Cain and Tina into stealing the jewels themselves, then watched as the alarm sounded and they were caught. She made off with the jewels and Cain and Tina were left like rats in her trap.\n\nCain and Tina, locating the stolen jewels, then retrieved them, planted them in Alex's penthouse and called in Hank Gannon. Their trap succeeded in freeing them from police custody, but because the whole situation was so complicated, and because Alex maintained that the two lovebirds had \"set her up,\" no one knew who to press charges against.\n\nAlex was fiercely determined to maintain control of Carlo's empire. When she found out that Carlo's rival, Moose Mulligan, wanted a piece of the action, a desperate Alex brought mild-mannered Egyptologist Mortimer Bern to town, who was Carlo's identical twin brother. Alex arranged for Mortimer to take voice lessons, dance lessons, even sex lessons, but nothing worked! Only when Mortimer met and became smitten with Carlo's former flame, Renee Buchanan, did he complete the transformation from Milquetoast to mobster.\n\nKevin and Lee Ann were married in early 1992 after Kevin learned she was pregnant with his child. For Lee Ann, however, living at Llanfair was anything but pleasant, and she felt completely out of place. During her marriage, Jason Webb revealed a surprising fact to Lee Ann: he was illiterate. Lee Ann promised to teach him to read and began to spend long periods of time in his room above Wanda's Place. When they began to fall in love, Lee Ann refused to hurt Kevin by cheating on him: instead, she asked Kevin for a divorce. Kevin, heartbroken, left town, while Lee Ann embarked on a tentative relationship.\n\nKevin returned before Lee Ann gave birth and was ready to get revenge. He told Lee Ann that he was going to get sole custody of their child, Demerest \"Duke\" Buchanan, to get the baby away from the clutches of Lee Ann. At the custody hearing, Jason confessed to the court that the only reason he and Lee Ann had spent time together was because she was teaching him to read. The preliminary hearing was won by Lee Ann. But the second time around, she was not so lucky. Kevin told the court of Lee Ann's libidinous flings with Max and Jason and used all the underhanded tricks in the book to undermine Lee Ann.\n\nThis time, Kevin was successful. Lee Ann was not allowed so much as supervised visitation rights. Jason, furious at Kevin, snuck into Llanfair one night and brought little Duke back to his mother. Lee Ann and Jason went on the run together, while Kevin tracked them down with the help of Hank Gannon's newly arrived daughter, Rachel. Rachel urged Kevin not to hold a grudge against Lee Ann and Jason. By the time baby Duke was safely returned, Kevin and Rachel bonded and their relationship became intimate -- much to the consternation of Rachel's disapproving daddy. Kevin agreed to unsupervised visitation rights for Lee Ann.\n\nTogether with Luna, Max schemed to dupe Asa out of a small fortune by tricking him into buying a chunk of land in which they had planted fake treasure. Eventually, Max and Luna bought the land back and built their pride and joy --- the Serenity Springs Spa.\n\nIn April 1992, Asa was jealous of Renee's sadness over Carlo's passing and Renee was convinced that Asa was having an affair with Blair. She was right - when Renee caught Asa kissing Blair Daimler, she divorced him, and took the Palace Hotel in the settlement. Asa appeared to be the answer to Blair's prayers. Through Asa, Blair could gain financial security for her mentally ill mother, Addie, and through her new power base, she could get revenge on Addie's sister, Dorian.\n\nBlair, after suffering a childhood of foster homes and neglect, had found her birth mother Addie in a nursing home and had broken her out. Addie, in her confused state, had told Blair about the Cramer family, claiming that her sister \"Dori\" had attacked her with scissors as a child. Blair naturally blamed Dorian for causing Addie's mental problems. But the truth was quite different. Dorian had been told by her parents that Addie had died of pneumonia at the age of 13, when in reality, Addie had been locked up in a mental hospital for stabbing Dorian with a pair of scissors. Dorian was as stunned as anyone to learn that her Agatha was alive and living with Blair!\n\nDorian proceeded to show Blair the large scar that still remained on her shoulder from the scissor incident. The emotional fervor of the confrontation led Addie to go berserk and she threw herself out the attic window. Though she nearly died, she recovered physically. The incident, however, prompted Blair to admit that Addie needed more attention than she could provide and had Addie committed to nearby St. Ann's psychiatric hospital.\n\nBlair was determined to claw her way to the top of the business world, even if it meant destroying her own Aunt Dorian to do it. Finding a skeleton in Dorian's closet, Blair used blackmail (Dorian's involvement with Victor Lord's death) to force her Aunt to make her the new Editor-in-Chief of Llanview's tabloid newspaper, The Intruder.\n\nThough Max persisted in pursuing Blair in 1992, she was busy wooing Asa Buchanan away from his wife, Renee. Max proposed to Blair, and surprisingly, she accepted. Blair changed her mind when Asa promised to stop Dorian from having Blair's mother committed if she would marry him! Max followed her back to Llanview, and was stunned to discover the woman he loved was about to marry his worst enemy.\n\nMax Holden was determined to stop Blair from marrying Asa Buchanan. On Asa and Blair's wedding day -- June 16th, 1992 -- passion exploded between Max and Blair. They made love -- on top of Blair's wedding dress! Still, Blair went through with the wedding, but when she wouldn't sleep with her husband, the marriage was doomed.\n\nBlair even went so far as to try to kill Asa, and frame Tina for the crime! Blair didn't succeed in her plot, and Months into their loveless marriage, a bitter Blair told Asa that she never loved him, and she slept with Max on their wedding day! Asa sued Blair for a divorce -- and won! Blair received nothing! Blair went running back to Max, only to find he was no longer available. By now, Max was beginning to see what everyone else in Llanview already knew. Luna was the only woman for him. Left with nothing, Blair departed Llanview.\n\nClint and Viki's marriage ran into some serious turbulence when Viki took interest in Reverend Andrew Carpenter's father Sloan, a retired Army General, who was writing a biographical book, \"Lord Of The Banner\" about the late Victor Lord.\n\nLuna was charmed when she began to receive love poems from an young man who was a fan of her radio show, the LoveLine. Little did she know that the lyrics she was receiving were from an jailed convict by the name of Suede Pruitt. Suede escaped jail and made his way to Luna, urging her to help him. He was innocent, he proclaimed. Luna consulted the goddess, who told her that Suede was telling the truth -- that was all the proof she needed.\n\nThough Max continued to be suspicious of Suede, he and Luna launched into a close friendship. It was clear that the only way Suede would ever be free again would be if he proved his innocence. He was accused of murdering his wife Deborah years ago, but had felt all along that Deborah's father Marcus was the real culprit. Max, Luna, and Suede journeyed to Deborah's family mansion in North Carolina and arrived at the house on a dark and stormy night. The events that transpired inside proved Suede's theory.\n\nA deranged Marcus admitted to killing his daughter - he had abused her as a child and when Deb married Suede, he had become insanely jealous and murdered her, letting Suede take the blame for the crime. Marcus pulled a gun and promised to shoot them all, beginning with Luna. Max flung himself in front of her and Marcus pulled the trigger. Max had been shot, but in that split second, Suede managed to shoot and kill Marcus.\n\nMax was rushed to the hospital, with Luna by his side the entire time. He barely clung to life. We then saw what was really happening inside Max's mind -- he was being tempted by a seductress -- this woman was Death and Luna urged Max to fight her. Death coaxed and teased Max, urging him to kiss her (the kiss of Death), but Luna begged Max not to do it. As he continued to slip away, Luna used her psychic powers to get into Max's mind. Once there, she forcefully dragged Max from Death's clutches and home to safety. Luna awoke from her trance mentally drained, but Max had begun to come around. He healed slowly, but the bond between Max and Luna had finally been formed.\n\nCassie began dating Reverend Andrew Carpenter, just as scandal hit St. James Church. Sloan was diagnosed with Hodgins Disease, and came to Llanview to make peace with his son, Andrew. Father and son had been estranged for years, over Sloan's refusal to accept the fact that his late son, William, was gay and died of AIDS. The reconciliation would have to wait because Sloan continued to deny the truth about William.\n\nReverend Carpenter proved to be a trusted advisor to Joey Buchanan's teenage friend, Billy Douglas. Billy was gay and he agonized over whether or not to tell his parents. Billy came to rely on both of them. One day in the rectory of St. James Church, a distraught Billy came to Andrew once again for help. The trusting minister placed a comforting hand on the boy's shoulder. Just then, troubled Marty Saybrooke peered in the door. For weeks, Marty had been trying to seduce Andrew, but he had gently spurned her overt advances. Jealous and angry to see Andrew expressing warmth and care for someone other than her, Marty went to Billy's parents and proceeded to tell a vindictive lie that the pastor was trying to seduce their son!\n\nThe charges against Reverend Carpenter spread through Llanview like wildfire! Andrew, claiming a basic right to privacy, refused to publically reveal his sexual preference. Massive homophobia ensued, and a vicious war of hate divided the citizens of Llanview. Through it all, Andrew held his head high -- even sustaining a brutal beating from a homophobic bigot, all the while proudly refusing to quit his post. Cassie, who was now dating Andrew, began receiving hate letters.\n\nAndrew angered Sloan when he publically announced that his own brother, William, was a gay man who died of AIDS. Sloan was further enraged when Andrew declared that he had arranged for the Names Project AIDS Memorial Quilt to come to Llanview, and he planned to add a special square honoring his brother to the tapestry. Sloan refused to allow the Carpenter name to be soiled in such a way! He was joined in his anger by Billy Douglas's father, who urged his fellow citizens to join him in boycotting the ceremony.\n\nIn a touching scene at St. James Church, Andrew delivered an impassioned speech about the destructive danger of hate and the divine power of love. He then dared the emotionally-drained procession to join him as he took the newly fashioned panel, honoring his brother, to the church lawn, where he proceeded to add it the sprawling quilt. Suddenly, Andrew felt a hand gently touching his shoulder. Looking up, he saw the tear-stained face of his father, who offered to help lay the panel. Over the past months, his love for Viki had enabled Sloan Carpenter to grow significantly as a human being. Now, he was finally ready to come to terms with his son William's death. After the quilt ceremony, father and son embraced tightly -- and Llanview began the slow and rewarding process of healing.\n\nAfter being cleared of Carlo's murder, Sarah looked forward to a long and happy future with Bo Buchanan. Their happiness was short-lived. Sarah died in a car accident - with Bo behind the wheel - on the day before their wedding. Months passed before he could deal with the horrible tragedy. Like a godsend, Llanview's newest attorney, Nora Gannon, helped Bo come to grips with the overwhelming loss of his beloved Sarah.\n\n1993\n\nThough upset, Dorian was resigned to accepting her daughter Cassie's impending marriage to Reverend Andrew Carpenter. But Marty Saybrooke wasn't. The troubled girl, still smarting from Andrew's rejection, showed up at the church drunk. Marty was determined to stop the wedding, but was hustled away by Viki.\n\nViki and Clint hoped to bring the magic back to their marriage. But early in the new year it became apparent that the joy they shared for so long had vanished. As Clint and Viki grew more distant, Viki found herself burning with sexual curiosity about Sloan Carpenter. Viki, always the paradigm of proper behavior, spent her idle time fantasizing about the General. When Sloan asked Viki to go away with him, she agreed -- unaware that, by sheer coincidence, Dorian was luxuriating at the same spa. When Dorian saw Sloan and Viki together, she smiled with devilish delight. Disguising her voice, she placed a call to Clint telling him that Viki had broken her leg and needed his help.\n\nClint raced to Vermont, but walked in on Sloan and Viki in bed! Outraged by his wife's inappropriate behavior, Clint filed for divorce. To clear his head, Clint went to his ranch in Arizona and was seriously injured in a plane crash. Still, Viki continued the relationship and became engaged to Sloan while Clint was hospitalized with severe injuries.\n\nEventually Mortimer Bern got out of control and there was nothing Alex could do to stop him, except have mommy dearest drop in for a visit. Mortimer's mother, Wilma Bern, arrived in town and revealed that Mortimer and Carlo were actually twin brothers. Carlo had always been a violent child and once attacked Mortimer. Wilma had no choice but to give Carlo up to adoption and keep Mortimer. Mortimer finally came to his senses and realized he had become his brother. Stopping by to visit Renee once more, they tangoed across the floor of the Palace Hotel -- and in order to correct his behavior, Mortimer said goodbye to Alex, Renee and Carlo's empire and left Llanview.\n\nNora hid her fear from Bo that she had been the driver of the car that ran him and Sarah off the road. Much to their relief, it turned out that Nora, who was plagued by blinding headaches and blackouts, was not to blame. As their love blossomed, Bo realized that this feisty attorney was the woman he wanted to spend the rest of his life with. Nora exuberantly accepted his proposal of marriage.\n\nThe Buchanans were astonished by the return of the not-so-late Cord Roberts, who had been held in a Middle Eastern prison camp. Suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, the now bitter and edgy Cord channeled his energies into finding Tina.\n\nCord discovered that Tina was out of town in Atlantic City and Cord took off after her. Cord found the hotel/casino where Cain and Tina were staying. Tina, dressed in lingerie, awaited Cain's return, but fainted upon seeing Cord, who she thought had died in Jaba City!\n\nTina, still shocked and beginning to worry about what would happen when Cain returned, quickly packed her bags and returned to Llanview with Cord, where she made everyone promise to keep silent about Cain. But such was not to be the case as Cain and Tina couldn't resist their passion and Cord walked in on them one day. Furious, Cord remembered Cain as \"Hudson King,\" the man who tried to make Tina publish a tell-all on the Lord/Buchanan family. Tina explained that Hudson was really Cain and that they were in love.\n\nIt soon became clear that Cord had changed since his ordeal in Jaba. He shouted at his wife, family and even little CJ and Sarah. CJ didn't like to be around Cord; he barely remembered his father and thought of Cain as his father figure, which infuriated Cord all the more. Cord was determined to break up Tina and Cain.\n\nCord began looking for chinks in Cain's armor. He found it in Angela Holliday, Cain's ex-wife/wife, who operated a local religious group in Texas. Blonde Angela followed Cord back to Llanview. She'd always hoped that she and Cain would get back together and the opportunity seemed too good to pass up. Angela brought with her, her loyal follower Rebecca Lewis and her religion.\n\nKevin, now involved in an interracial relationship with Rachel, decided to allow Lee Ann to have partial custody of Duke -- only if she dumped Jason Webb. Jason eased his grief by resuming his May/December affair with a very willing Dorian. Lee Ann moved with Duke to Texas, where Kevin would regularly visit with his son.\n\nMax tried to get Luna Moody into his bed. She wouldn't sleep with him because of a premonition telling her that if they consummated their relationship, Max would die! To Max's relief, her psychic abilities eventually told her that they could make love on Valentines Day at a lodge on Lake Serene. So, on Valentines Day, 1993, they made love for the first time.\n\nMax and Luna's romance hit a temporary roadblock when they discovered that their spa, Serenity Springs, sat on top of a huge oil reserve. Always looking to make a quick and easy fortune, Max wanted to drill immediately. But Luna objected, feeling that it would destroy the \"serenity,\" not to mention the ecological balance of the land. While snooping around the Springs one day, Alex Olanov came across Luna Moody's innocent brother Ty, who was in town for a visit. Ty fell instantly for Alex's charms. Flattered, Alex led him on for awhile, but told him her name was \"Zan,\" because she knew what Max and Luna would tell Ty if they found out he was smitten with her.\n\nAlex kept a \"boy toy\" -- Luna's kid brother, Ty -- on the side while she wooed Llanview's crotchety millionaire oil baron, Asa. Asa enjoyed Alex's sexy come-ons, and quickly enlisted her help in getting Max & Luna to sell the oil-rich land.\n\nThe \"ghost\" of Luna's dead husband urged her not to marry Max or he would end up like Bobby -- dead. Luna freeked and ran off before the big day. Max followed her, vanquished the ghost, and after some convincing, Luna agreed to return to Llanview. Luna became the new \"Mrs. Max Holden\" in a unique and spiritual wedding.\n\nCassie and Andrew were thrilled to discover that Cassie was pregnant, and looked forward to welcoming the baby. Meanwhile, while in bed with Dorian, Jason Webb found a lump in Dorian's breast. At first, Dorian ignored the lump. However, when tests revealed that the lump was cancerous, Dorian (with her pregnant daughter Cassie by her side) sought the necessary treatment.\n\nAfter treatment, she was back at her old ways. Dorian read an advance edition of Sloan Carpenter's comprehensive biography of her late husband, Victor Lord. In the book, Sloan alluded to the fact that Dorian may have been responsible for Victor's untimely passing back in 1976. Dorian wasted no time in firing back. She persuaded a young and impressionable coed, Emily Haynes, to file sexual harassment charges against Sloan, the new dean of Llanview University. It was not long before Dorian's scheme was exposed and Sloan was exonerated. Once again, Dorian had become the most hated woman in Llanview.\n\nAngela set up shop in the Tabernacle of Joy, a run-down building on the outskirts of town. The news that Cain had previously been married seriously shook Tina up, but Cord's ruse didn't work when Tina forgave Cain for his slip of memory. Angela stayed in town and continued to be a thorn in their side, as she persisted in an attempt to lure back Cain Rogan.\n\nCord and Angela formed a good friendship -- and later Angela formed a bond with Dorian Lord. Dorian and her daughter Cassie were on the outs again, and Dorian hoped that becoming a good, decent person by befriending evangelist Angela Holliday and participating in Angela's Tabernacle of Joy would make Cassie take her back. That all came crashing down when the truth about Angela came out. First, she was very brunette underneath the blond wig she was wearing! Next, her religion was a scam to grab donations from unwitting followers! Dorian told Angela she'd have to help her get Cassie to forgive her, or she'd tell everyone about the Tabernacle. Angela had no choice but to agree.\n\nWhen the truth did eventually come out, Angela's followers turned vehemently against her, and Angela was run out of business and clung to Dorian for financial support. It became clear that Cain and Tina were not to be broken up, so Angela had to find another way to do it.\n\nIn a mother-daughter confrontation at Llanfair, Cassie ordered Dorian out of her life for good. The heated exchange, in combination with Cassie's already high blood pressure and an accidental tumble down the stairs, caused her to go into premature labor. Little William Carpenter lived only a few hours before dying. The terrible loss drove Cassie's normally-placid husband Andrew to lash out at Dorian -- nearly strangling her to death!\n\nDesperate to salvage her reputation, Dorian lured Viki into Victor Lord's secret room at Llanfair. Once inside, Dorian bolted the door behind them, vowing to keep Viki prisoner until she promised to stop Sloan from publishing the book. However, the scheme went awry when, in a struggle with Viki, the key to the door fell down an air vent. In a night to end all nights, tempers flared over past jealousies, betrayals and deceptions. With time and oxygen running out, Viki dared to get to the source of their conflict. Viki challenged Dorian to the truth: Did she marry Victor Lord only for his money? Did she kill him? Dorian denied the accusations and upon securing their freedom, the two enemies resolved only to go on with their lives with more animosity than ever!\n\nWhile Kevin was a student at Llanview University, Llanview's troubled party girl Marty Saybrooke, showed up at Kevin's fraternity's annual Spring party and was determined to have a good time. Llanview University's star football player, Todd Manning, was a very complicated young man who was about to take out his vengeance on Marty Saybrooke, with whom he had a one-night stand several weeks earlier. Ever since, she had refused to sleep with him again.\n\nThe night of the spring fling, Kevin carried Marty up the stairs to his room to sleep off her drunken binge. Meanwhile, down at the party, Todd Manning motioned to his pals Powell Lord and Zach Rosen to follow him upstairs. The crowd's loud and raucous noise prevented anyone from hearing Marty's screams as she was brutally raped by Todd, then Zach, and a reluctant Powell.\n\nKevin sat on the porch of the frat house, oblivious to the barbarous act taking place in his own bed. Later, he found Marty in a state of shock. Confusing Kevin with the others, a terrified Marty scratched his face with the ring.\n\nMarty filed rape charges against Todd, Powell, Zach -- and Kevin too! In her confusion, Marty wrongly believed that Kevin was among the men who gang raped her! Only later did Marty realize the error of her ways and exonerate a relieved Kevin. Attorney Nora Buchanan, believing Todd's assertion that Marty wanted to have sex with them, agreed to represent the boys. The trial went well for the defendants and Todd had hope of an acquittal after Nora's brutal cross-examination of Marty. However, when Nora discovered, to her horror, that Todd had raped another coed, Carol Swift, she realized he was guilty. What to do? Nora delivered an intense summation, during which she made it evident to all that her three clients were guilty as sin. Because of Nora's sudden turn against Todd, Zach, and Powell, a mistrial was declared. Marty recanted her testimony and exonerated Kevin, but Kevin and Todd's feud was cemented for life. Todd once again swore revenge on Marty.\n\nMax and Luna bonded further over Luna's radio show, where she offered advice on love and life, which was a booming success in Llanview. After Marty spoke out on Luna's radio show about her experience, Todd waited for her in the alley outside the radio station. He pinned her against the wall and threatened to rape her again. Seeing this, Luna raced into the alley, grabbed a metal pipe and hit Todd across the face with it. The attack left him deaf in one ear, and his face scarred. When Todd's father, Peter Manning, visited him in the hospital, he called him a pathetic excuse for a son and abandoned him.\n\nLater, Marty confronted Todd in the hospital, where he arrogantly confessed to raping her. Unbeknownst to Todd, Marty got his confession on tape! Sentenced to eight years in jail, Todd seethed with anger. Meanwhile, the remaining three fraternity brothers were found guilty after Marty, Kevin and Hank's daughter, Rachel obtained the evidence that drove Todd to plead guilty.\n\nNora faced a life-threatening crisis of her own when she was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor that required immediate surgery. She reluctantly opted to go under the knife, but without informing Bo! Just before the operation, Bo found out the truth and raced to her side, where he stayed throughout the ordeal. Afterwards Nora temporarily lost her eyesight, then found herself trapped in a beach house by a knife-bearing Todd Manning. Earlier, Todd escaped from prison! Todd viciously tried to rape Nora, but was thwarted in his attempt when Nora bashed him over the head with a lamp. In the nick of time, Bo -- who heard about Todd's escape on the radio -- came back to the beach house and rescued Nora. Todd Manning slithered into the night!\n\nWhen CJ Roberts and Al Holden were trapped in a crevasse, Cord rescued them and hit his head. In the hospital, Cord awoke with selective amnesia - he remembered everything prior to his rescue mission to Jaba City and still believed he was married to Tina. Larry Wolek warned Tina not to upset Cord, because it could be further detrimental to his health.\n\nTina, eternally grateful to Cord for saving their son, agreed. She and Cain continued to meet behind Cord's back, but eventually Angela Holliday told him the truth and Cord finally had to admit that his marriage to Tina was over and they finalized the divorce, leaving Cain and Tina free to be with each other.\n\nIn December 1993, Blair Daimler returned to Llanview and founded a cosmetics company, Melador. Blair's determination to win Max away from Luna was renewed, and she saw a way to get to him: Max's gambling addiction.\n\nWanda told her nephew Jason on Christmas Eve that she was going to leave town. Her friend, Ralph Love, was opening a bookstore in Seattle and had asked her to join him. Getting on in years, Wanda had agreed. With that, Wanda left Llanview.\n\nJust weeks after losing her baby, Cassie discovered a newborn baby in the manger outside St. James Church. Cassie hoped that the mother would never turn up because she yearned to raise the child as her own!\n\n1994\n\nThings began to look up for Viki when she and Sloan journeyed to Miami to visit Dorian's neice Blair. Blair told them that Dorian had signed a confession to Victor's murder and that she had always been worried that Victor's nurse Ethel Crawford, might come forward with some damaging evidence. Blair followed Viki and Sloan back to town and watched as her Aunt Dorian squirmed. Dorian pleaded with Blair not to turn over the false confession papers to the police, but Blair made no promises at first, but did help Dorian acquire Nora Gannon's defense by switching some names around on the judge's \"pro-bono\" list.\n\nAs Max's gambling addiction grew, so did Blair's longing to sleep with him. Blair secretly tried to sabotage Cord and Luna's plans to help Max get over his gambling habit. One night, after catching Max in a serious lie, Luna packed his bags and asked him to leave. Max took Blair to Atlantic City for a weekend of wild gambling and wild sex.\n\nCalling himself Jimmy Glover, R.J. Gannon met up with Max Holden and Blair Daimler in Atlantic City in 1994, luring them into a high-stakes card game. After loaning Max ten thousand dollars, \"Jimmy\" followed Max and Blair back to Llanview, where using pressure, he collected his money, plus a two-thousand dollar late penalty.\n\nIn a tragic chain of events, Al ran out into the road, with Luna chasing him. Blair hit the brakes, but it was too late! She ran down Luna and paralyzed her! Realizing he loved Luna and was addicted to gambling, Max told Blair that whatever they had was over. Only much later, after Max had begun attending Gamblers' Outreach meetings and Luna had taken her first step, did the couple make up. On Christmas Eve, Luna told Max she was pregnant.\n\nCord tenderly helped Blair through the troubled times. Soon enough, they were making love! Blair ultimately couldn't get Max Holden out of her system, and her relationship with Cord fizzled.\n\nAfter years of on-and-off love, Cain and Tina finally readied to tie the knot on Valentine's Day 1994. Unfortunately, Cain's ex-flame Angela Holliday was still up to her old tricks. She hired a fake minister to marry the two and skipped town, mailing the note to Llanview shortly after Tina and Cain left on their honeymoon.\n\nTodd Manning, injured from his botched attack on Nora Gannon at the beach house, found his way to the Tabernacle of Joy. Once there, he managed to con sweet Rebecca Lewis into helping him. Todd regained his strength, then set out to make Marty pay! Todd leapt from the shadows and attacked Marty, but her boyfriend, Suede Pruitt, heard her urgent screams. He raced to her rescue and a ferocious fight ensued. In the struggle, Todd pushed Suede, who stumbled back and hit his head on a metal wrench on the floor. Suede was dead!\n\nTodd's flight from the law seemingly came to an end when Bo Buchanan tracked the fugitive down in the woods. In a fight on a footbridge, Bo and Todd wrestled for a gun. The weapon went off and Todd fell into the icy river.\n\nTodd had survived his icy ordeal, and made his way back to Llanview. In time, Todd's run from the law came to an end. On the night of the annual Costume Ball at Serenity Springs, Todd was cornered and forced to surrender. A short time later, Todd would become a free man when, just weeks later, the police cruiser taking Todd to Statesville Prison suddenly blew a tire and spun out of control. The police car nearly collided with a car driven by Marty who had CJ and Jessica in the backseat. As Marty's car teetered on the edge of an abyss, Todd bravely saved her life. For his courageous deed, Todd was granted a pardon!\n\nCassie's fragile world quickly fell apart when Beth Garvey, the teenage mother of the baby she found, reclaimed the child. Cassie desperately offered Beth money for the baby. When Beth refused, Cassie stole the baby. She was eventually caught and suffered a breakdown. Dorian managed to get back into her daughter's good graces again by playing on her delusions - she even tried to harass Beth into giving the child back to Cassie, but Beth refused and Jason Webb told Dorian to butt out.\n\nAndrew was forced to commit his wife to a mental institution and turned to Marty Saybrooke for comfort. Soon, Andrew could not stop fantasizing about Marty. Cassie got well, and eventually returned home. During the summer, a \"killer flu\" took Beth's life. Her last request was to have Cassie and Andrew adopt River, knowing that they could provide a loving home for her son. Jason, heartbroken that he never told Beth he loved her, left town after her death.\n\nOne night, the inevitable happened. Andrew grabbed Marty and kissed her passionately. Horrified, they pulled apart. Over the next few weeks, they shared a few more clandestine kisses. When Marty realized that Andrew didn't feel the same way she felt about him, they called a halt to the sizzling situation, but it was too late. Blair witnessed their scandalous meeting and threatened to relate the dirty details to her cousin Cassie.\n\nViki decided to have her father's body exhumed for an autopsy, hoping it would prove that Victor was murdered. The autopsy revealed a startling fact: Victor hadn't died of a heart attack after all - instead, tiny fibers from a pillow were found in his lungs - he had been smothered! Viki felt vindicated and pushed ahead with the trial. She and Sloan also journeyed to Maryland to talk with nurse Ethel Crawford. Dorian was not far behind. Ethel refused to tell Viki and Sloan anything; when they left, Dorian snuck in, distracted Ethel and then gave her a potentially fatal dose of insulin.\n\nBut Ethel didn't die -- she was alive and well enough to testify at Dorian's trial. Under oath, she told the court that Dorian had been paying her off for the past 18 years, to keep silent about what she saw. What did she see? Ethel testified that she'd been coming out of Victor's bathroom that night only to find a woman hunched over Victor's bed, pushing a pillow over his face. That was the damning evidence in the eyes of the jury. Though Nora bravely tried to discount her testimony, it was to no avail. When Dorian went on the stand, she only succeeded in damning herself further, by accusing the judge of using her trial as a stepping stone into the governor's office. Dorian was found guilty and, in a shocking move, was sent to death row. Cassie told Viki she would never forgive her for what she did to her mother.\n\nDorian's future looked bleak, until an eleventh hour witness stepped forward bearing evidence he claimed could exonerate her. The young man, David Vickers, went to Viki claiming to be Victor Lord's son by Irene Clayton. To support his sensational claim, he handed her Irene's diary, in which she admitted killing Victor herself! When the diary was authenticated, D.A. Gannon had no choice but to drop the case. Dorian was free! Dorian planned to take revenge however -- she found it in Viki's innocent son Joey.\n\nDorian was the only one who knew that David was a fraud. The diary, verified by the experts, was little more than a brilliant forgery. In exchange for saving her hide, Dorian gave David $50,000. Together, they had pulled off the scam of the century!\n\nAfter ditching Cain, Tina returned to Llanview and met David. Immediately the sparks flew, but David was her brother! One night, while alone together at Viki's cabin in the mountains, \"brother\" and \"sister\" gave in to their passion and slept with each other. Later, to alleviate Tina's revulsion at this apparently incestuous act, David confessed to Tina that he wasn't her brother after all. She was furious at first, but in time Tina forgave David and married him in a secret ceremony in Las Vegas.\n\nAs a teenager, Joey traveled to Italy to study abroad and returned to Llanview in 1994. During that summer, seeking the ultimate revenge against Viki, Dorian had artfully seduced Joey, whom she had hired as a summer handyman. However, Dorian never expected that she would actually fall in love with \"her Joe.\"\n\nRachel and Kevin planned to move in together. However, when Kevin went for an extended trip to Texas to spend time with Duke, Rachel and Dr. Ben Price developed a friendship that led to romance. Extremely jealous, Kevin ended their budding relationship.\n\nBen investigated a strange mid summer flu epidemic which swept some of Llanview's most prominent citizens, resulting in a few deaths. Realizing that the flu vaccine and syringes had been tainted, he leaked this information to the press. This lead to a suspension; he was ultimately vindicated and the cost cutting doctor in charge was forced out of practice.\n\nAsa stunned the people of Llanview when he tied the knot with Alex Olanov in an outrageously decadent October 1994 Cleopatra-style wedding in New York's Central Park was the event of the year!\n\nSloan broke his engagement to Viki claiming that he was still in love with an old flame, Beverly Crane. Clint, of all people, discovered the truth -- Sloan's Hodgkins Disease was out of remission and he was dying. With his cancer spreading rapidly, Sloan reconciled with Viki and they married in a touching hospital room ceremony on December 2nd -- with a teary Clint (still carrying a torch for Viki) watching from afar.\n\nHank Gannon wasn't thrilled when his no-good brother RJ showed up in Llanview. Max Holden recognized RJ Gannon instantly. RJ was the very same loan shark (calling himself Jimmy Glover at the time) who made Max's life miserable when he was slow in paying back money in Atlantic City. R.J. was an ex-con who served time for assault. His brother's wife, Nora, represented him and lost the case. R.J. had held a grudge against both Nora and his goody-good brother ever since and now, it was payback time!\n\nR.J. tried to destroy Hank's career and reputation by producing a tampered videotape from Hank's college days that showed him standing by as a murder was committed. First R.J. attempted to blackmail Hank with the doctored video, then tried to seduce Hank's fiancé, Sheila Price, in exchange for the tape. To preserve Hank's pristine reputation, Sheila nearly gave in to R.J.'s demands, but she was saved when he was arrested and detained on minor misdemeanor charges. R.J.'s vengeful mission was foiled when Bo Buchanan found the real video, exonerating Hank.\n\nTodd proposed to Rebecca, who tenderly turned him down. Rebecca had already accepted Powell's proposal of marriage. Todd's return to society hit another snag when he became the central suspect in a series of rapes. Todd desperately set out to prove his innocence by finding the guilty party himself. His private detective work paid off in spades! Todd was shaken to the core upon discovering that Llanview's masked rapist was none other than his old fraternity brother, Powell Lord!\n\nIndeed, Powell was in the middle of a nervous breakdown. His guilt over raping Marty Saybrooke and his hatred for Todd had merged -- he now believed that he WAS Todd. At the same time, Powell wanted Todd dead. While Todd lay asleep in his motel room that night, Powell broke in and stabbed him after a struggle. Marty donated the blood that saved Todd's life. Powell returned again - this time, he took Todd hostage and threatened to kill both Todd and himself. Todd freed himself and attacked the psychotic Powell. Powell was arrested and sent to a mental institution, while Todd was exonerated once more. Marty and Todd shared a brief moment of semi-reconciliation, but she ran from facing her fears entirely.\n\nTodd received a shock when his father died suddenly in December. Strangely, the wealthy Peter Manning left Todd nothing except for a chain bearing a locket and a key. In letters from his mother, Todd discovered that he was adopted and there was a large sum of money for him somewhere. Dorian and David discovered the truth when they tracked down the clues to make the incredible discovery that Todd Manning was the Lord heir -- and he was worth nearly 30 million dollars!\n\nOver drink after drink, Todd and Blair bonded. At first, they were simply misery-loves-company companions, but before long, they were in bed together!\n\n1995\n\nViki mourned the loss of her husband Sloan, who passed away on January 9th, 1995. Andrew's indiscretion with Marty was put into perspective when Andrew was dealt a sad blow with his father, Sloan's, succumbing to Hodgkin's Disease.\n\nDorian told Viki a piece of incredible news: David Vickers was not her brother as he had claimed. Viki hurried to confront David with the horrible truth. Assailed by Viki, David was forced to confess his evildoing but he swore that Dorian was behind the entire scam. Then, it dawned on Viki. If David lied about Irene Manning killing her father, Dorian must be the murderer after all! Viki rushed to confront Dorian. In a bitter exchange, Dorian warned Viki that if she reopened the Victor Lord murder case, then Dorian would be forced to reveal \"Viki's secret.\" What could she mean? When Viki threatened to call the police, Dorian launched into a vicious diatribe about her late husband. Viki held her ears as Dorian told her the shocking news that Victor had seduced his own daughter!\n\nUnable to bear another word, Viki snapped. Viki took Dorian prisoner and Dorian quickly discovered the strain of the traumatic events had caused Victoria Carpenter to take on several new personalities. Among them was the cool and calculating Jean Randolph, who locked Dorian in the secret room then told the world that she had confessed to Victor Lord's murder before skipping the country. All the while, Dorian languished in her dank and dark makeshift prison, wondering if she would ever see the light of day again.\n\nWhen Blair discovered that Todd was Victor Lord's son and heir (and worth $27.8 million dollars!), Blair set out to marry Todd by telling him she was pregnant. When a suspicious Todd forced his new wife to have a pregnancy test, it came back positive! Duped by the charade, Todd married Blair in Florida on February 17th, 1995.\n\nTodd set out to become an even bigger publishing tycoon than his father ever was. He bought the Intruder newspaper from Dorian, renamed it \"The Sun\" and began hiring the best and brightest staff members away from The Banner. Todd and Blair were so please with their first headline - \"Cops Selling Guns To Kids In Angel Square.\" Kevin and Clint were left wondering how Todd got this big story before they did. They had no idea that Todd's inside source, his \"deep throat,\" was none other than Viki --- whose \"Jean Randolph\" and \"Tori\" personalities were leaking information to the enemy camp.\n\nBlair was terrorized and mugged on the docks of East Llanview by Javier and Luis, two members of the Arrows gang. Sadly, she lost the baby. Young Cristian Vega, an artistic and bright teenager, happened upon Blair on the docks -- and he was unjustly charged, and later cleared of the crime.\n\nMax confronted Todd with startling news: Blair was not really pregnant when she married Todd. An enraged Todd went wild - nearly raping Blair, until she reminded him of what he did to Marty. Todd came to his senses and stopped. Nevertheless, the Manning marriage was over. Much to her surprise, Blair soon learned that she was pregnant with Todd's child -- again!\n\nJoey was devastated when Dorian inexplicably left him -- and left the country. During her confinement, Dorian came to see Viki's personality splinter into several other alters including vengeful Tori, violent Tommy, and Princess, the little girl who was molested by her father. Most of the time, Jean -- the gatekeeper -- remained in control of Viki's psyche. Jean blackmailed Dorian into breaking up with Joey as a condition of her release. Jean finally released Dorian after she agreed to break up with Joey and marry David Vickers.\n\nUpon her release, Dorian broke up with Joey. Jean paid a surprise visit to David (who had returned from Spain and was promptly arrested) in jail, telling him to divorce Tina or she would have no choice but to press charges against him. Reluctantly, David agreed, lying to a stunned Tina that he never loved her.\n\nDorian married David. Dorian's stomach sickened every time this man she despised, referred to her as his \"little potato.\" Now, as man and wife, Dorian and David would not have to testify against each other.\n\nKelly Cramer, the daughter of Melinda Cramer (who spent most of her adult life in and out of mental institutions), grew up in boarding schools. Rebellious by nature, Kelly was kicked out of her elite European school as a teenager and was sent to live with her Aunt Dorian in Llanview. The arrival of her wild-child niece sent Dorian's life into renewed turmoil.\n\nKelly met Joey Buchanan and despite initial animosity between the two, an attraction was born. Kelly developed a wild crush on Dorian's husband (in name only), David Vickers. A virgin, she was determined to make David her \"first.\"\n\nKelly finally wore down David's resistance, and got him into bed. Just as they were about to make love, Dorian and a photographer burst in the room! Dorian was stunned to see that David's paramour was her own niece! In the aftermath, Dorian offered David three-fourths of her fortune -- and a divorce. He greedily accepted -- but Dorian had a trick up her sleeve. She set-up David to make it look like he committed adultery against her, thereby forfeiting his divorce settlement.\n\nOn Valentine's Day, 1995, Hank Gannon married his longtime love, nurse Sheila Price. Their memorable day was nearly spoiled by Hank's still-vengeful brother, RJ, who picked their wedding reception to break the news to the humiliated groom that he had slept with his ex-wife Nora while Hank and Nora were still married. The tale, which was true, did not deter Hank from marrying Sheila. Furious with RJ's admission, Hank refused to let the embarrassing news stop the wedding.\n\nKevin briefly dated Andy Harrison, then left for London to work as a reporter for The London Times.\n\nBen's relationship with Rachel did not run smoothly since she began turning to drugs to cope with the rigors of law school. Rachel even used Ben's prescription pad to get her fix. She promised Ben she would stop taking drugs, but he found out she was lying and told his sister Sheila about the problem. Sheila agreed to keep it quiet from Hank and Nora. But Rachel never kicked the habit and it led to her break-up with Ben.\n\nRachel graduated to illegal drugs, with seedy Javier Perez as her main supplier. Rachel and Javier occasionally engaged in drug-induced sex, but even he realized her problem before long and told his boss, Rachel's uncle RJ. RJ couldn't look the other way, because he cared too much about his niece. When Rachel nearly overdosed on heroin, RJ joined Hank and Nora for an intervention. Against her will, Rachel was sent off to a rehab clinic to kick her habit.\n\nThough Ben Price was an honorable man who tried to help Rachel through her drug addiction, Rachel's uncle RJ still did not care for him and had his friend Alex Olanov arrange for Ben to be awarded a prestigious fellowship that would take him to London.\n\nIn late Spring, Max and Luna welcomed twins -- Frankie and Leslie -- into the world. The couple -- still very much in love -- doted on their two new additions.\n\nOn June 1, 1995, Nora became Nora Hanen Gannon Buchanan when she married Bo in a rock-and-roll themed wedding, presided over by legendary rocker, Little Richard. After the ceremony, the guests danced in the aisles, then headed for 50's-style sock hop reception.\n\nViki's alter, Tori, set out to destroy everything that Victor Lord had built in his lifetime -- including his home, Llanfair and his newspaper, The Banner. On the night of Bo and Nora's wedding, Tori torched Llanfair, only to discover to her horror that Viki and Clint's daughter, Jessica was inside! Momentarily turning back to Viki, she saved Jessica -- but Llanfair went up in flames.\n\nIt came to light that Viki had one more alternative personality buried deep in her psyche --- her father, Victor Lord. The Victor Lord personality only emerged two or three times, but one of the instances that he took over led Viki to attempt suicide by cutting her own wrists to \"expel\" Victor from her body. During therapy, Viki discovered the dreadful truth that her alter, Tori, was the one who pressed a pillow onto her abusive father's face, smothering him to death. Viki was not put on trial. Instead, she was allowed to return home for further healing.\n\nKelly finally wore down David's resistance, and got him into bed. Just as they were about to make love, Dorian and a photographer burst in the room! Dorian was stunned to see that David's paramour was her own niece! In the aftermath, Dorian offered David three-fourths of her fortune -- and a divorce. He greedily accepted -- but Dorian had a trick up her sleeve. She set-up David to make it look like he committed adultery against her, thereby forfeiting his divorce settlement.\n\nNora and Bo settled into their new home at 912 Greenfield Avenue in Llanview, where Nora proved to be absolutely useless in the kitchen -- she can't cook! A former tennis champ, Nora is very competitive and dances a mean jitterbug with her husband, Bo.\n\nThe east side of Llanview had been rife with gang violence. Luna's good-hearted brother, Dylan Moody, along with his new girlfriend, Marty Saybrooke, committed countless hours to renovating the Angel Square Community Center -- which they hoped would serve as a centerpiece of harmony in the district. However, even the new Community Center became the scene of several bloody skirmishes between rival gangs, the Arrows and the Prides. Marty began worrying about Dylan's safety -- and their relationship suffered as a consequence of the ever-present danger.\n\nThe increasing violence in Angel Square prompted Dorian's maid, Carlotta Vega, a longtime resident of the neighborhood, to make her impressionable son, Cristian, promise never to join a gang. She had already lost one son to gang violence. Carlotta's eldest son, Antonio, the former leader of the Prides, was serving time in Statesville Prison on a murder rap. Now, a war was being waged between the \"good\" gang, the Prides, and the \"bad\" gang, the Arrows, and young Cristian was caught in the middle.\n\nAfter getting his GED and a college degree in prison, Antonio was given an incredible opportunity to turn his life around. Llanview's new Police Commissioner, Bo Buchanan, needed someone to go undercover to find out who was selling guns to the gangs in Angel Square. Antonio teamed up with Max's sister, officer Andy Harrison.\n\nWhen Arrow gang member Luis plotted to \"take out\" Dylan Moody at Llanview's Community Center, he shot and killed Dylan's sister, Luna, by mistake. Max sank into an all-consuming depression when his true love passed away. Cristian Vega was an excellent student, with a particular talent for art, which his teachers encouraged him to develop. Cristian proudly displayed his artistic prowess when he designed the Angel statue that stands tall in the revitalized Angel Square, in honor of Luna.\n\nIn the summer of 1995, Cris met pretty blonde Jessica Buchanan at a dance party in Angel Square. They hit if off immediately, but their cultural differences proved paramount. \"Jessie\" came from an entirely different world from his -- she had money, power, comfort, safety. Cris knew only poverty, danger, and fear. Despite their differences, Cris reached beyond his social class to become Jessica's first boyfriend.\n\nAs their young love progressed, Cristian struggled to free himself from the gang life that had done such irreparable damage to his family. When Jessica's father, Clint Buchanan, caught the kids in the early throes of passion, he forbade Jessica from seeing Cristian, and Carlotta Vega could only concur.\n\nAn all-out gang war erupted in Llanview's Angel Square. Teens Cristian Vega and Jessica Buchanan shared the joy and wonder of first love, while her father, Clint, and his mother, Carlotta, shared a tender kiss. Best of all, Angel Square had begun the process of repairing the inner strife that had threatened to tear apart the neighborhood. Peace was finally at hand.\n\nThrough assassination plots and secrets galore, Alex and Asa's stormy and sexy marriage endured until the 1995 return of Alex's \"not-so-late\" husband, Carlo Hesser!\n\nWhen Todd found out about Blair's second pregnancy, they reconciled and married again - this time in a beautiful ceremony at St. James Church in November, amidst a shower of golden balloons.\n\nMarty traveled to the remote Irish isle of Inishcrag to successfully confront her Aunt Kiki, who had been squandering Marty's inheritance in a wild spending spree throughout Europe. In a pub, a handsome stranger pulled her into a kiss. Marty played along -- pretending to be his lover. By acting casually and posing as his \"wife, she had helped him elude his hunters. She had saved his life!\n\nSo began the romance of Margaret \"Marty\" Saybrooke and Irish poet Patrick Thornhart. Patrick was being followed by members of the Men of Twenty-One, who suspected that he had the coded sheet music that could reveal their terrorist plans. Marty and Patrick soon bonded, and they soon made love.\n\nTodd undertook a mission to locate Marty Saybrooke in Ireland. Hoping to finally make things right with the woman he raped, Todd went to Ireland, sent Marty back home to her dying friend Paloma, then remained on the isle of Inishcrag to help her new friend Patrick Thornhart out of a jam. However, Todd (wearing Patrick's coat) was mistaken for Patrick and was shot, thrown into the trunk of a car, and driven off a cliff. The last we saw of him, Todd was lying on an Irish beach - his eyes wide open.\n\nWhen Patrick ventured to Llanview in search of Marty, he was amazed to find the woman he loved engaged to another man!\n\n1996\n\nPatrick Thornhart moved forward with a plan to undermine the Men of 21, and elude the Irish authorities. Patrick managed to convince Bo, Llanview's Police Commissioner, of his innocence.\n\nBo tried to stall a corrupt Irish cop named Bass from extraditing Patrick back to Ireland. Bo had Patrick and Marty decipher a piece of music that Patrick's former lover, the Irish Special Forces agent Siobhan Connelly, had entrusted him with as she lay dying from terrorists' bullets. Patrick tried to convince Marty that he loved her dearly, but she shunned his declaration of love, and went ahead with her plans to marry Dylan.\n\nPatrick made a new friend in Llanview - newcomer, Maggie Carpenter. Maggie then met her cousin Andrew's friend, Max Holden. Max was having trouble dealing with his son deafness. Max and Maggie were instantly combative. Max was still bitter and depressed over his wife Luna's murder. But Max gradually began to see Maggie in a new light -- and showed her how he felt by kissing her. It was then that Maggie hit Max with an eye-opening announcement. She was planning on becoming a nun! Over Max's protests, Maggie took her final vows in Boston.\n\nBlair, pregnant with Todd's baby, seethed with anger at Marty. Convinced that Marty was directly responsible for Todd's death, Blair made ruining Marty's life her pet project. Blair gave birth to a baby girl, Starr. Blair continued to seek vengeance on Marty by trying to seduce Patrick.\n\nWhile living at the carriage house with his brother, Kevin, Joey began a relationship with Dorian's young niece, Kelly Cramer. What started out as friendship eventually blossomed into romance and Joey always had a strong shoulder for Kelly to lean on.\n\nAfter divorcing David, Dorian proved she was still a masterful schemer by plotting to break up her niece Kelly and her boyfriend, Joey Buchanan. Kelly confessed to Joey that she was still a virgin, and pleaded with him to make love with her. When Joey refused, Kelly was convinced that he still loved Dorian. Kelly caught Joey and Dorian having sex and she fell back into David's trap. When David aggressively tried to seduce her, Kelly hit him over the head with a lamp and killed him. Or so she thought!\n\nDavid returned from the dead, kidnapped Kelly, and held her for ransom aboard a yacht. Kelly was rescued, but David Vickers managed to escape. David skipped town, while Tina got a job offer in Baltimore as a personal shopper at the Logan's Department store. Tina moved with CJ and Sarah to Baltimore, where they resided, at least until Viki lost touch with her sister over the years.\n\nAsa began corresponding via email with a foreign businessman known as \"Poseidon.\" Suspicious of Asa, Alex, the new mayor of Llanview, secretly began corresponding with Poseidon herself. Alex discovered that not only was Poseidon a member of the Men of 21 -- he was her not-so-late husband, Carlo Hesser. Alex fainted and upon recovering, enjoyed an orgy of sex with her hot-to-trot hubby!\n\nAsa planned to meet Poseidon and another secret partner, Lord Cove, at the Palace Hotel to hand over $30 million dollars in a business deal. Unbeknownst to Asa, he was about to become a victim of the \"Men of 21.\" Asa was hit over the head -- and when he awoke in a daze, the money was gone!\n\nDisguised as Major Austin, a munitions expert, Bo infiltrated the organization. He was nearly killed by a bomb set by the double-crossing Bass. Patrick was shot in the melee, and Marty secretly nursed him back to health. Even though Marty had feeling for Patrick, she went ahead with her wedding to Dylan!\n\nPatrick rose from his sickbed, and arrived at the Palace Hotel in time to save Bo, and help defuse the bomb. Bass was arrested, and subsequently poisoned to death, and though Patrick tried to stop her, Marty married Dylan Moody. Heartbroken, Patrick grabbed Blair and dashed away to the stables where Blair played upon his anguish, luring him into an embrace. However, her well-timed seduction attempt failed as Patrick flashed upon memories of making love to Marty in Inishcrag. He broke free of her grasp.\n\nAsa suffered a heart attack when Carlo returned \"from the dead\". Upon his recovery, Asa sent Alex for a divorce from Carlo, then remarried her. All the while, she engaged in a sizzling affair with her baldheaded ex-husband. To test her loyalty and to get his $30 million back from Carlo, Asa sneakily convinced everyone he had gone insane!\n\nPatrick realized Carlo was Poseidon and was determined to prove it. Marty finally confessed her love to Patrick. Back home, she resolved to tell Dylan. Afterwards, she promised to meet Patrick on Llantano Mountain. Patrick waited... and waited. However, Marty never came because just before she was to tell Dylan, he suffered a serious back injury (resulting from an earlier scuffle with Patrick) on the basketball court at the Community Center. The injury paralyzed Dylan. Torn between her love of Patrick and her commitment to Dylan, Marty decided she couldn't leave her husband now. In agony, she told Patrick they were through.\n\nPatrick finally gave in to Blair's seductive efforts. After one particularly romantic dinner, they made love. One hot summer night, as Patrick and Blair made love on the floor of her penthouse apartment, a mysterious man stood in the shadows. In stunned silence, he absorbed the shocking sight of the two souls in the heat of passion. It was Todd Manning!\n\nHarnessing his rage, Todd ran off. Keeping his return secret from everyone except his sister, Viki, Todd was overjoyed to hold his daughter Starr in his arms. Determined to make Blair pay, Todd kidnaped Starr, before finally returning her and revealing his miraculous \"return from the dead\" to his \"unfaithful\" wife. Blair's prayers had been answered --- Todd was home!\n\nResuming his position as Publisher of the Sun, Todd set out to make Blair's life miserable. Todd waged an internal debate. Should he end their union or give Blair a second chance at proving her love? Just when it seemed that they might reconcile, Todd was stunned to discover that Blair was pregnant again -- with Patrick Thornhart's child!\n\nUniting forces with RJ Gannon, Carlo schemed to get rid of Asa and settle a long-standing score by getting revenge on Viki, who had killed his son, Johnny Dee. Carlo coerced famed psychiatrist Elliot Durbin into hypnotizing Viki to kill her own son, Kevin! Elliott found himself growing increasingly restless over his plan to hypnotize Viki into killing her son. He began having feelings for the woman and desperately wanted a way out from under Carlo's thumb. At the same time, Dorian became attracted to the good doctor, but soon uncovered his connection to Carlo. Elliott eventually gave Viki the order to kill Kevin, but when it came down to it, Viki was unable to do so. Elliott, horrified at what he'd done, tried to leave town, but he was stopped by a bullet from one of Carlo's henchmen.\n\nCristian Vega urged Jessica Buchanan to take their relationship \"all the way.\" Jessica struggled with the decision, not ready to take the big step. This crisis in their relationship led to several break-ups and make-ups throughout the year. When Cris was found guilty and of breaking into a car (he was an innocent victim but was charged nonetheless) he was given probation and community service as punishment. Worse, this talented artist was denied a scholarship to college because of his conviction. Antonio took a desperate step to insure that his kid brother did not continue further down the wrong road.\n\nCarlo Hesser sought to find a worthy male heir to someday assume his \"throne.\" He chose Antonio Vega to fill his shoes.\n\nCarlotta Vega left Dorian's employ and went to work at the D-K Diner which had once been hers. When the diner was put up for sale, Carlotta feared she would lose her job. Carlotta wanted desperately to buy the diner, but couldn't raise the funds. However, because of his prison record, no one would give Antonio a loan -- no one but Carlo. To get the money Cris needed to attend college, and the money Carlotta needed to buy the Diner, Antonio sold his soul to the devil -- Carlo Hesser. Carlo offered Antonio a chance to help his family -- in exchange Antonio would be forced to do Hesser's dirty work. Antonio hated working for Carlo. More than that, he hated lying to Andy.\n\nAndy stumbled upon evidence that Antonio was in cahoots with the crime kingpin. Andy found herself immersed in a perplexing dilemma -- trapped between her love for Antonio and her allegiance to the police force.\n\nAware of Antonio's misdeeds, Bo convinced him to go undercover to get the goods on Hesser. There was one critical drawback: No one, not even Andy, could know of their secret plan. This sticky situation put a severe strain on Andy and Antonio's already tenuous relationship.\n\nWhile faking insanity, Asa hatched his latest scheme and enlisted the aid of his longtime rival, Max Holden. Asa wanted to get back at Carlo for stealing both the Buchanan money and Alex's affections. The plan was to make Carlo believe he was a dying man.\n\nEventually, Carlo discovered that Max had duped him -- he wasn't going to die after all! To get back at Max and Maggie, he trapped them in a cave in North Carolina. Convinced that they may die in the sealed off cavern, Max tenderly told Maggie that he loved her. They came together in a sizzling embrace.\n\nMax and Maggie survived their ordeal after being rescued by Antonio, who returned to Llanview to face the wrath of his enraged employer, Carlo Hesser. Refusing to be intimidated, Antonio called Carlo's bluff and talked his way out of his predicament.\n\nBo, Marty and Patrick discovered the truth about the Men of 21 conspiracy from a microchip hidden in a book of \"Irish airs.\" To their horror, they learned that the beloved Mr. Kenneally, who had come to Llanview during the summer, was the brains behind the terrorist organization.\n\nDylan regained the use of his legs and did the gentlemanly thing. He bowed out of Marty's life and returned to North Carolina.\n\nClint Buchanan and Carlotta Vega had a brief romance in 1996, but things never got off the ground. They shared a memorable trip to New York City, but Carlotta, plagued by devotion to her late husband Diego, was not willing to sleep with her suitor. Realizing their relationship had changed, Clint and Carlotta parted as friends on Carlotta's birthday, October 24th, 1996.\n\nJoey whisked Kelly away to Paris, where they shared a night of passion for the first time. Upon their return home, Kelly moved in with him.\n\nWhile on a run through the woods, Joey encountered an enchanting \"nymph\" bathing in the nude. He returned time and again, finally learning her name was Olivia DeWitt, and she lived in a nearby cottage.\n\nDorian Lord revived her longtime battle to destroy the Buchanans when she hired an attractive young woman, Cameron Wallace, to infiltrate Buchanan Enterprises. Working closely with Cord, Cameron and Cord enjoyed a simmering attraction. Unbeknownst to anyone, Cameron was actually Joey's Olivia -- leading a dangerous double life! Once again, Dorian was thwarted when Cord exposed Cameron's scam. Her duplicity revealed, Cameron beat a hasty retreat out of town.\n\nWhen it appeared that Asa was losing his marbles, Cord took over Buchanan Enterprises, but Asa proved himself capable of managing his own affairs. Cord decided to move to London and run his own division of the family business.\n\nAsa granted Alex her divorce, then got even with both Carlo and Alex by crashing their wedding and exposing the fact that Alex was faking a pregnancy. Asa knew exactly what he was doing when he ripped off Alex's wedding dress, exposing a pillow strapped to her stomach!\n\nCarlo's reign of terror finally ended. While leaning over the boat's railing, Blair was stunned to see Carlo Hesser's body, with a bullet-hole in the center of his forehead. Todd Manning tried in vain to implicate his enemy, Patrick Thornhart, in Carlo's death. However, Antonio was being set up by Alex and RJ! Llanview's D.A., Hank Gannon, formally charged Antonio Vega with murder.\n\nSheila told Hank she was pregnant and Hank responded negatively to his wife's condition. Sheila feared Hank was not ready to commit to their marriage or to their upcoming family. After she suffered a miscarriage shortly thereafter, Sheila left town to live with her brother Ben in London. Several weeks later, Hank was served with divorce papers.\n\nAfter fleeing the rehab center, Rachel hid in New York City where her world spiraled out of control. She found work with a shady \"dating service.\" Several months later, Jessica, on a field trip to New York City, happened upon Rachel in a bus station. When Jessica later told Nora what her daughter had been wearing and how she had looked, it became clear that Rachel was not living a \"clean\" life.\n\nEnlisting the help of Bo's newly-returned son Drew, Nora, Hank and RJ raced to New York City in an attempt to locate the missing girl. Drew was successful in doing so. Posing as a \"customer,\" he visited a call-girl agency only to meet the new employee Rachel (or \"Roxy,\" as she called herself). Hiding his identity, Drew tried to convince the troubled girl to return to her family. But when Rachel learned who Drew really was (her stepbrother!), she tried to escape. Enter Hank, who snapped a pair of handcuffs around his daughter's wrists and dragged her home to Llanview!\n\nThrough the summer, Drew helped Rachel overcome her addiction. As a way of capping her triumph over drugs, the family agreed to serve as guests on a live talk-show hosted by Tad Martin of Pine Valley, The Cutting Edge. The day of the taping, however, Rachel overheard a troubling fight between her parents and uncle RJ. It seemed that Nora and RJ had had an affair before she was born. Though Rachel tried to keep the knowledge inside, it bubbled out during the televised interview when she accused her parents of lying to her. Later, she even hinted that RJ might be her father, not Hank. Nora quickly denied the hint and chided her daughter for being so doubtful.\n\nAfter telling Bo that his mother, Becky was dead, Drew was mortified when she turned up in Llanview. She demanded that he get some fast cash from his deadbeat dad to finance the resurrection of her singing career. Eventually, a stunned Bo discovered Becky's \"return from the dead.\" Though he was disturbed by Drew's elaborate lie, Bo eventually forgave his son. To everyone's relief, greedy Becky left town when Nora paid her off to hit the road.\n\nKevin returned to Llanview in 1996, and became an investigative reporter for where he engaged in a playful, prank-filled and always flirtatious battle for scoops with rival reporter Cassie Carpenter.

Insisting she was a happily married woman, Cassie urged Kevin to find someone else -- and he did.\n\nMaggie decided to leave the convent. Max praised her brave decision, and proposed that they make a fresh start. Together, they went out on their first date.

With Nora as his attorney and his lover, Andy at his side, Antonio anxiously prepared to go on trial for the murder of Carlo Hesser.\n\n1997\n\nAll of Llanview was shocked when mob boss Carlo Hesser turned up dead after Todd and Blair Manning's ill-fated ball. Carlo was a man with many enemies and almost everyone had a reason to want him dead. Antonio Vega went on trial for Carlo's murder and things looked bleak for him indeed, especially since Carlo had staged an elaborate planned scheme in which he had framed Antonio for the crime. In the end, however, Alex Olanov Hesser Buchanan was revealed as the murderer. It was also revealed that Asa Buchanan had witnessed the murder, but had said nothing to clear Antonio because he was hoping that the 30 million dollars Carlo has swindled from him would resurface. Asa had knowingly let an innocent man stand trial for murder and no one could forgive him for this selfish act.\n\nTéa Delgado was born in Puerto Rico and moved to New York with her parents when she was four years old. Her father, Leon, is a superintendent in a building on Park Avenue. Although the Delgado family lifestyle was decidedly middle class, they never lost touch with the old friends and relatives they knew in Puerto Rico, many of whom now live in the Unites States. Téa spent many quality hours with her grandmother Maria Delgado, who is affectionately called \"Abuelita.\" Téa also spent weekends with her family's longtime friends, the Vegas, who they considered \"cousins\".\n\nTéa was always obedient and studious. Her diligence paid off when she graduated college summa cum laude, went on to NYU Law School, then immediately acquired a position in a top ten law firm, Howell and Maguire, as soon as she passed her bar exam.\n\nBeautiful, but always too focused on work and accomplishment to have a committed relationship, Téa had a few flings, mostly with other career-obsessed, fast-trackers. In early 1997, she began feeling that something was missing from her hectic, hyper-urban lifestyle. Téa began to investigate leaving New York. She felt that could get more hands-on experience working in a smaller venue. So, when Carlotta Vega alerted her to the fact that her son, Antonio was under arrest for the murder of mobster Carlo Hesser, Téa saw it as a sign. She opted to pull out of the fast lane for a while and relocate to Llanview, PA.\n\nPolice Detective Andy Harrison stood by her boyfriend, Antonio, throughout his murder trial.
