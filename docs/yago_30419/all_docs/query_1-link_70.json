Moreover, you’re interested in finding the truth in every situation. And in Llanview, there are plenty of publications to work for, including The Llanview Banner, The Sun and Craze magazine. Just make sure that the person you’re interviewing isn’t a serial killer (ask Jessica Buchanan for more details).\n\nDo your journalistic research with a subscription to Soap Opera Digest.\n\nMostly Bs: Con Artist\n\nSure, it’s a risky venture, but schemers actually fare pretty well in Llanview. David Vickers, Blair Cramer, Lindsay Rappaport, Roxy Balsom and former Llanviewian Max Holden should have plenty of tips to give you — just don’t try to pull any cons on them (well, except maybe Roxy, who can sometimes be gullible).\n\nCons are one thing, but it would be a real crime not to have a subscription to Soap Opera Digest.\n\nMostly Cs: Salon Owner\n\nAppearance is important to you and your style is particularly unique. That’s why you feel it’s your duty to make sure everyone else looks his or her best. Of course, if you open a salon in town you’ll have to compete with Foxy Roxy’s. But if you get someone to paint a mural of you in your new venture, you might have a chance to succeed.\n\nThis year’s must-have wrinkle remover, a subscription to Soap Opera Digest. (That way, you don’t have to worry about missing anything!)\n\nMostly Ds: Police Officer\n\nYou want to help people and protect them. What better way to do so than to join the Llanview Police Department? Don’t worry — in this town, there’s plenty of crime to fight. Keep in mind that most cases are assigned to Bo Buchanan, John McBain and Antonio Vega (who’s no longer even a cop!), but if you work hard, they’ll probably let you help out … or at least watch them in action.\n\nGet your badge of honor with a subscription to Soap Opera Digest"
