        "text": "Along the year some of OLTLï¿½s characters changed their haircuts in a drastic way. The guys grew mustaches & beards and the ladies had changed from long haircuts to short haircuts. Letï¿½s take a look at these changes.\n\nMustaches & Beards: Some of Llanviewï¿½s men had for short or long times beards, goatees & mustaches.\n\nMarco Dane: Marco Dane came to town with a full beard and long hair which was shaven and cut when he posed as Mario in 1978. After he was exposed, he remained clean shaven until he was forced to go on the run with Karen Wolek and grew the beard back again. When he reurned to Llanview in 88 he was clean shaven again.\n\nJoe Riley: When Joe was kidnapped by terrorists in 1978, he had several days growth of beard which he shaved except for the moustache when he was released and he was with the moustache until the day he died. When we saw him in heaven in 87 he still had the moustache.\n\nBo Buchanan: There were several times we saw Bo with a beard. I think the first time was at Badderly. He had a beard in 95 during the time Nick Manzo sold guns in Angel Square and also after Drew died and he was stuck in a boat. The actor Bob Woods had face lifting in Augus 2000 and when he returned he had a beard and looked rather different. (Note: Bo had fake beard on several occasions like saving Sarah from Mendorra and disguised as Major Austin).\n\nTodd Manning: Todd definitely had his shore of different hairstyles. At first he had long hair and shaved face. Later he grew his internal goatee and stayed like that for a couple of years. When he returned from the dead in 96 he had shorter hair than before but it grew long again. In February 2000 when he came for a week he had shorter hair but still long and when he returned in June 2000 he had short hair and was shaved.\n\nCord Roberts: After Cord returned from the dead he had a beard.\n\nMax Holden: Like Bo there were several times he grew up a beard. Here are a couple: When he was on Lunaï¿½s Radio show, after he found the twins in Canada and when he found out that \"his\" and Blair's baby had died.\n\nClint Buchanan: Clint had a mustache for a couple of months around 96-97. He also had a beard around the time he was seeing Carlotta Vega.\n\nJoey Buchanan: Don Jeffcoat's Joey had a goatee for a very brief time in the summer of 98. He also had one just before he left in January 2001.\n\nAndrew Carpenter: In one episode in the fall of 2000 Andrew had a goatee.\n\nAntonio Vega: Antonio had a goatee a number of times. He shaved it when he got married.\n\nRJ Gannon: RJ grew a goatee around the time he started work for Dorian since then he still has it. Tea shaved him once.\n\nHank Gannon: Hank had a mustache from the first time he hit Llanview but at the beginning he had longer hair.\n\nIvan Kipling: It seems like Ivan always had his mustache but when he impersonated a minister in order to sabotage Cassie's wedding in 85 he shaved it and slicked back his hair.\n\nOn the other hand there were men who had beards and mustaches and didnï¿½t shave on their time in Llanview.\n\nPeter Janssen: As much as I can remember Jeff Pomerantzï¿½s Peter had always had a mustache.\n\nJack Scott: Dr. Jack Scott was also one of those mustache men.\n\nBen Price: Peter Parrosï¿½s Ben had a goatee.\n\nMel Hayes: Mel had a beard he never shaved on his time in Llanview.\n\nFrom long to short: Lots of Llanviewï¿½s ladies had cut their long hair in different times and replaced it with a short haircuts.\n\nViki Davidson: In Erica Slezakï¿½s first years on the show she used to have long hair. I think she cut it of in 77 and from then till now sheï¿½s growing it a little and then cutting it off again.\n\nWanda Wolek: Before Marilyn Chris left the show in 77 she used to have long brunette hair. When she returned in 79 she had blond curly short hair.\n\nKatrina Karr: When Kat was first introduced she had long blond hair she later cut it off and changed to a darker color.\n\nEdwina Lewis: Edwina used to walk with a long plait but sheï¿½s cut it in the early 80ï¿½s.\n\nPat Ashley: Pat used to have long blond puffy hair. She later striated it and in the 80ï¿½s sheï¿½d cut it off and changed into short haircut.\n\nBecky Lee Hunt: Becky Lee used to have long brown hair but when she returned for her short visits in 88, 96, 97, 98 & 2001 she had short hair.\n\nAlex Olanov: At the beginning Alex had long blond hair but after being released from prison she had short hair. When she returned in 2001 she wore a wig because the actress' (Tonja Walker Davidson) hair was brunette.\n\nAndy Harrison: Andy used to walk with long plait but during her trial for selling guns sheï¿½d cut it and had shorter haircut.\n\nJessica Buchanan: Erin Torpey's Jessica had long blond slightly curly hair as a child but when she finally got a storeyline around 95 she changed her haircut to shorter hair.\n\nNatalie Buchanan: Natalie came to Llanview as a redhead and she stayed red till Mitch abducted her and tried o full Victor she is Jessica. He colored her hair blonde and Natalie stayed with it for a while.\n\nKelly Cramer: Kelly used to have long slightly curly blond hair Sheï¿½d cut it when she started modeling for Melador I think.\n\nDorian Lord: Robin Strasserï¿½s Dorian in the 80ï¿½s had brunette curly hair. When she returned in 93 she had long red hair and in 97 she surprisingly cut it off and changed it to a short haircut. When she returned in 2003 she had a more mature haircut, Red again but this time no curles.\n\nGabrielle Buchanan: When Gabby came back after ten years away from Llanview she had a MUCH shorter haircut. The hair got longer and now she has something in the middle.\n\nJacara Principal: Jacara had long hair with plaits but in her last days in Llanview she had a new much shorter haircut.\n\nRachel Gannon: Sandra P Grantï¿½s Rachel always had curls in her hair but during her final days in Llanview she striated it.\n\nNora Buchanan: Nora came to town with short hair. With the years it gotten longer and longer but when she thought Bo was cheating on her with Georgie she asked Sam to cut off her hair. Since then she goes with short hair.\n\nTea Delgado: Tea had long hair in her first two years but in 99 sheï¿½d decided on a change and cut it off to much shorter.\n\nRae Cummings: When she was still called Gretel in the late 70ï¿½s she had long curly hair but when she returned as Rae in 99 she had a short haircut.\n\nBlair Daimler: Kassie DePaivaï¿½s Blair came with long blond hair to Llanview. In 96 she stood in front of a mirror with Marty and thought Todd married her because the two looked a like she took a pair of scissors and made her hair shorter. Blairï¿½s hair got long again but in 2000 Skye got her revenge on Blair by cutting her beautiful blond hair. Blair went with a short aircut for a while and as usual the hair got longer. (Note: KDPï¿½s drastic hair changes were always included in OLTLï¿½s storylines!)\n\nCredits:\n\nJohn Dunado - Info about Joe Riley, Marco Dane & Ivan Kipling\n\nDebby Taylor - Info about Clint Buchanan"
