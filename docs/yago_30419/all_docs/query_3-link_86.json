Hunter, Leslie Ishii, Francis Ruivivar\n\nNotes: Filmed closer to the shows opening before they started to trim the show in order to save it, so its a little longer than later in its short run. The show only played 72 performances. Quality varies on different copies.\n\nSeussical - Backers Audition March, 2000 - Pro-Shot\n\nSharon Wilkins (Sour Kangaroo), Alice Playten (Mrs. Mayor/The Lorax), Eric Devine (General Genghis Kahn Schmitz), Eddie Korbich (The Once-ler), Janine LaManna (Gertrude), Kevin Chamberlin (Horton), Andrea Martin (Cat)\n\nHadestown - Broadway February, 2020 - theaterfan64\n\nReeve Carney (Orpheus), Eva Noblezada (Eurydice), Patrick Page (Hades), Amber Gray (Persephone), André De Shields (Hermes), Kimberly Marable (u/s Fate), Kay Trinidad (Fate), Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer (Fate), Timothy Hughes (Worker), Afra Hines (Worker), Damani Van Rensalier (Worker), John Krause (Worker), Anthony Chatmon II (Worker)\n\nHadestown - First US National Tour\n\nFebruary, 2022 (1) - StarCuffedJeans\n\nNicholas Barasch (Orpheus), Morgan Siobhan Green (Eurydice), Kevyn Morrow (Hades), Kimberly Marable (Persephone), Levi Kreis (Hermes), Kimberly Immanuel (u/s Fate), Bex Odorisio (Fate), Shea Renne (Fate), Will Mann (Worker), Chibueze Ihuoma (Worker), Jamari Johnson Williams (Worker), Lindsey Hailes (Worker), Sydney Parra (Worker)\n\nParadise Square - Broadway June 25, 2022 (Matinée) - bikinibottomday\n\nJay McKenzie (u/s Washington Henry), Sam Edgerly (u/s Owen Duignan), Gabrielle McClinton (Angelina Baker), Matt Bogart (Willie O'Brien), Josh Davis (Uptown Man/Way Station Attendant/Notification Officer), Ben Michael (Uptown Man/Provost Marshal/Daniel Jenkins/Ensemble), Kayla Pecchioni (u/s Nelly O'Brien), John Dossett (Frederic Tiggens), Jacob Fishel (Milton Moore), Nathaniel Stampley (Reverend Samuel Jacob Lewis), Camille Eanga-Selenge (s/w Blessed), Hailee Kaleem Wright (Sarah/“Paradise Square” Singer), Chloe Davis (Nova/“Paradise Square” Dancer), Kennedy Caughell (Uptown Woman), Lael Van Keuren (Uptown Woman), Chilina Kennedy (Annie Lewis), Eric Craig (s/w Elmer Woods/Ensemble), Kristen Bell Williams (s/w Amelia Tiggens), Kevin Dennis (Lucky Mike Quinian), Colin Barkell (Ensemble), Karen Burthwright (Ensemble), Dwayne Clark (Ensemble), Garrett Coleman (Ensemble), Jamal Christopher Douglas (Ensemble), Shiloh Goodin (Ensemble), Bernard Dotson (Ensemble), Sean Jenness (Ensemble), Joshua Keith (Ensemble), Alan Wiggins (s/w Ensemble), Eilis Quinn (Ensemble), Lee Siegel (Ensemble), Sir Brock Warren (Ensemble)\n\nNotes: Excellent 4K capture of an understudy-heavy performance, including Sams debut as Owen. There are occasional moments of unfocusing, some minor wandering, and a 30 second long blackout at the very beginning of act 2, but all other action is captured and there are no obstructions besides some latecomers. Kayla gets a standing ovation for her Let It Burn. Includes curtain call, audio is fed from external source. Eric Craig performed in Sam Edgerlys track, Alan Wiggins performed in Jay McKenzies track.\n\nHadestown - First US National Tour July 17, 2022 - deadlyroseisabellapotter Video (Highlights)\n\nJ Antonio Rodriguez (u/s Orpheus), Morgan Siobhan Green (Eurydice), Kevyn Morrow (Hades), Kimberly Marable (Persephone), Levi Kreis (Hermes), Cecilia Trippiedi (u/s Fate), Will Mann (e/c Fate), Lindsey Hailes (u/s Fate 3), Courtney Lauster (Worker), Marquis Wood (Worker), Ian Coulter-Buford (s/w Worker), Jordan Bollwerk (Worker)\n\nNotes: 29 minutes of Highlights! crazy night for covers!!

Very little to no obstruction. No curtain call.\n\nFrozen - Hamburg 2023 (2) - Rumpel\n\nWillemijn Verkaik (Elsa), Abla Alaoui (Anna), Mina (Young Elsa), Ha Im (Young Anna), Jan Kersjes (Olaf), Owen Playfair (Kristoff), Yvan Karlsson (Sven), Bob Van De Weijdeven (Hans), Sjoerd Knol (Oaken/Bishop), Eric Minsk (Weselton), Nicola Monterumisi (Pabbie), Rossella Monteforte (u/s Bulda), Dominik Doll (King Agnarr), Lanie Sumalinog (Queen Iduna)\n\nCinderella (Andrew Lloyd Webber) - Broadway (Bad Cinderella) March, 2023 (2) - catherinewasamassivec\n\nSavy Jackson (alt Cinderella), Jordan Dobson (Prince Sebastian), Grace McLean (The Queen), Carolee Carmello (The Stepmother), Sami Gayle (Adele), Morgan Higgins (Marie), Aléna Watters (u/s The Godmother), Dave Schoonover (u/s Prince Charming), Josh Drake (Arthur), Gary Cooper (s/w Dorian), J Savage (Gawain), Lauren Boyd (Ensemble), Tristen Buettel (Ensemble), Kaleigh Cronin (Ensemble), Ben Lanham (Ensemble), Angel Lozada (Ensemble), Mariah Lyttle (Ensemble), Sarah Meahl (Ensemble), Christian Probst (Ensemble), Larkin Reilly (Ensemble), Julio Rey (Ensemble), Lily Rose (Ensemble), Tregoney Shepherd (Ensemble), Paige Smallwood (Ensemble), Michael Milkanin (s/w Ensemble), Lucas Thompson (s/w Ensemble), Chloé Nadon-Enriquez (s/w Ensemble)\n\nNotes: Savys first show. Act 1 starts at the unveiling of Charmings statue; Act 2 at Sebastians face blind moment. Some very brief dropouts, lots of very good zooms.\n\nMoulin Rouge! The Musical - Broadway April, 2023 (1) - juniper47\n\nJoanna \"JoJo\" Levesque (Satine), Derek Klena (Christian), Eric Anderson (Harold Zidler), Andre Ward (Toulouse-Lautrec), David Harris (The Duke of Monroth), Ricky Rojas (Santiago), Sophie Carmen-Jones (Nini), Jacqueline B. Arnold (La Chocolat), Tasia Jungbauer (Arabia), David Merino (Baby Doll), Nick Martinez (Pierre), Sarah Bowden (Ensemble), Maya Bowles (Ensemble), Patrick Clanton (Ensemble), Alexander Gil Cruz (Ensemble), Taurean Everett (Ensemble), Aaron C. Finley (Ensemble), Bahiyah Hibah (Ensemble), Kaitlin Mesh (Ensemble), Clay Rice-Thomson (Ensemble), Arianna Rosario (Ensemble), Julius Anthony Rubio (Ensemble), Alec Varcas (Ensemble), Cole Wachman (Ensemble), Bria Jené Williams (Ensemble)\n\nNotes: Filmed in 4K, released as 1080p and 4K. Occasional obstruction in Act 1 when the guy sitting in front of me kept leaning forward (less leaning in Act 2). A few very brief drop-outs here and there. A few wide shots, but mostly medium and closer zooms to focus on JoJo as it was her first performance as Satine. Lots of fans cheering. No video of megamix or curtain call due to ushers and obstruction.\n\nBad Cinderella | Broadway | May 2023 (1) | catherinewasamassivec's master\n\nCAST: Linedy Genao (Cinderella), Jordan Dobson (Prince Sebastian), Carolee Carmello (The Stepmother), Grace McLean (The Queen), Sami Gayle (Adele), Morgan Higgins (Marie), Christina Acosta Robinson (The Godmother), Ensemble: Mike Baerga, Lauren Boyd, Tristen Buettel, Kaleigh Cronin, Josh Drake (Arthur), Jaquez, Ben Lanham (MC), Cameron Loyal (Prince Charming), Ángel Lozada, Mariah Lyttle, Chloé Nadon-Enriquez (s/w), Christian Probst, Larkin Reilly, Lily Rose, J Savage (Gawain), Dave Schoonover (Dorian), Tregoney Shepherd, Paige Smallwood, Lucas Thompson (s/w)\n\nNOTES: Front row lapshot taken with a phone. Due to stage height only downstage action is visible, but if you ever wanted a conductor fancam, this one's for you.\n\nBad Cinderella | Broadway | May 2023 (2) | catherinewasamassivec's master\n\nCAST: Linedy Genao (Cinderella), Jordan Dobson (Prince Sebastian), Carolee Carmello (The Stepmother), Grace McLean (The Queen), Sami Gayle (Adele), Morgan Higgins (Marie), Christina Acosta Robinson (The Godmother), Ensemble: Mike Baerga, Lauren Boyd, Tristen Buettel, Kaleigh Cronin, Jaquez, Ben Lanham (MC), Cameron Loyal (Prince Charming), Ángel Lozada, Mariah Lyttle, Michael Milkanin (s/w Arthur), Christian Probst, Larkin Reilly, Lily Rose, J Savage (Gawain), Dave Schoonover (Dorian), Tregoney Shepherd, Paige Smallwood, Lucas Thompson (s/w)\n\nNOTES: Front row lapshot taken with a phone. Found a better angle than last time, but still missing lots of action upstage. Act 2 is completely out of focus for ~10 minutes after I move and mess up a perfectly good shot.\n\nLa Cage aux Folles - Regent's Park Open Air Theatre September, 2023 - Lasagna\n\nCarl Mullaney (Albin), Billy Carter (Georges), Ben Culleton (Jean-Michel), Shakeel Kimotho (Jacob), Debbie Kurup (Jacqueline), Julie Jupp (Marie Dindon), Sophie Pourret (Anne Dindon), Peter Forbes (Edward Dindon)\n\nNotes: Excellent capture of this iconic show! Unobstructed and well shot\n\n​\n\nHadestown - First US National Tour October, 2023 - Sbeve/QuoxWoodTrees\n\nJ Antonio Rodriguez (Orpheus), Amaya Braganza (Eurydice), Matthew Patrick Quinn (Hades), Lana Gordon (Persephone), Will Mann (Hermes), Marla Louissaint (Fate), Lizzie Markson (Fate), Hannah Schreer (Fate), Sevon Askew (Worker), Jamal Lee Harris (Worker), Courtney Lauster (Worker), Daniel Tracht (Worker), Racquel Williams (Worker)\n\nNotes:\n\nGreat quality complete video shot from center Orchestra. Occasionally shaky, blurry or drop-outs from readjusting in first act which is still decent/very watchable - second act is much better. Great capture of all the action and plenty of zooms and well-framed shots. This is only the second week of performances for the new cast! Includes full audio, full video of We Raise Our Cups and quality-ehanced edit by BenChipsAreDown.\n\nSix - Broadway October, 2023 (5) - catherinewasamassivec\n\nHolli' Conway (s/b Catherine of Aragon), Aubrey Matalon (s/b Anne Boleyn), Kristina Leopold (s/b Jane Seymour), Nasia Thomas (Anna of Cleves), Zoe Jensen (Katherine Howard), Marilyn Caserta (s/b Catherine Parr)\n\nNotes:\n\nIncludes footage from before No Way, but it has a bunch of dropouts due to latecomers arriving. After that it becomes a really nice video of this al(l)ternate massive.\n\nWicked - Gothenburg (Non-Replica) October, 2023 - hitmewithyourbethshot\n\nMarie Gathe (u/s Elphaba), Anna Salonen (Glinda), Max Jansson (Fiyero), Ole Forsberg (The Wizard), Vera Veljovic (Madame Morrible), Sofia Mustaniemi (Nessarose), Oskar H Olsson (Boq), David Lundqvist (Doctor Dillamond)\n\nMerrily We Roll Along - Broadway Revival November 22, 2023 (Matinée) - bikinibottomday\n\nJonathan Groff (Franklin Shepard), Daniel Radcliffe (Charley Kringas), Sherz Aletaha (u/s Mary Flynn), Krystal Joy Brown (Gussie Carnegie), Katie Rose Clarke (Beth), Amanda Rose (s/w Auditionee/Mrs. Spencer/Scotty), Leana Rae Concepcion (Auditionee/Newscaster/Claudia), Max Rackenberg (Frank Jr.), Brian Sears (Newscaster/Bunker/Photographer), Jacob Keith Watson (Terry/Mr. Spencer), Reg Rogers (Joe), Vishal Vaidya (Jerome), Jamila Sabares-Klemm (Evelyn/Dory/Pianist), Christian Strange (Ru/Reverend), Corey Mach (Tyler), Natalie Wachen (K.T.), Maya Boyd (Make-Up Artist/Mimi from Paramount), Talia Simone Robinson (Meg Kincaid), Evan Alexander Smith (Greg from Paramount)\n\nNotes:\n\nExcellent 4K capture of Sherz’s debut as Mary! Some wandering and unfocusing throughout. Some washout on the wider shots. Includes overture, curtain call, and the post-show BC/EFA speech, audio is fed from external source.\n\nBoop! The Musical - Chicago Tryout December 3, 2023 (Matinée) - Medium Observation\n\nJasmine Rogers (Betty Boop), Faith Prince (Valentina), Ainsley Anthony Melham (Dwayne), Stephen DeRosa (Grampy), Angelica Hale (Trisha), Erich Bergen (Raymond), Phillip Huber (Pudgy), Anastacia McCleskey (Carol), Lawrence Alexander (Ensemble), Colin Bradbury (Ensemble), Tristen Buettel (Ensemble), Joshua Michael Burrage (Ensemble), Gabi Campo (Ensemble), Daniel Castiglione (Ensemble), Rebecca Corrigan (Ensemble), Josh Drake (Ensemble), RJ Higton (Ensemble), Nina Lafarga (Ensemble), Morgan McGhee (Ensemble), Aubie Merrylees (Ensemble), Ryah Nixon (Ensemble), Christian Probst (Ensemble), Ricky Schroeder (Ensemble), Gabriella Sorrentino (Ensemble), Brooke Taylor (Ensemble)\n\nNotes:\n\nNice video from the second week of previews and Version 3.0. Some scenes are majorly wideshot due to the nature of the show, along with usher activity. Some washout can be seen at times but its not too bad.\n\nCompany - Second US National Tour October 19, 2023 - bikinibottomday\n\nBritney Coleman (Bobbie), Judy McLane (Joanne), Derrick Davis (Larry), Matt Rodin (Jamie), Ali Louis Bourzgui (Paul), Kathryn Allison (Sarah), James Earl Jones II (Harry), Marina Kondo (Susan), Javier Ignacio (Peter), Emma Stratton (Jenny), Matthew Christian (u/s David), Jacob Dickey (Andy), Tyler Hardwick (PJ), David Socolar (Theo)\n\nNotes: Excellent 4K capture of the new revival tour! Some wandering / readjustment and unfocusing throughout. Act Two has a visible head, but it doesn’t block off anything until the very last scene (where it is mostly worked around well). Includes curtain call, audio is fed from external source.\n\nDays of Wine and Roses - Broadway January 7, 2024 - The Musical Speakeasy\n\nKelli O'Hara (Kirsten Arnesen), Brian d'Arcy James (Joe Clay), Tabitha Lawing (Lila), Byron Jennings (Arnesen), David Jennings (Jim Hungerford), Sharon Catherine Brown (Mrs. Nolan/Saleswoman), Olivia Henandez (Betty), Bill English (Mr. Shaw), Tony Carlin (Rad), David Manis (Delaney)\n\nNotes:\n\nTechnical Notes: Camcorder video captured in 4K. No obstructions, no washout unless to illuminate something else on stage. Besides occasional adjustments (and a brief late call at the beginning of the second scene), no dropouts or flaws. Good audio. Shot from extreme house left balcony. [A/A+]\n\nPerformance Notes: One of the most alluring and gnawing presentations of the season. An aggressive, gritty, rich, mature, on-your-toes piece of art with a top shelf score by Guettel, a nasty vicious book by Lucas, career highlight performances from Kelli and Brian, and a wonderfully directed production from Greif (though, frankly, a bit vacuous on a Broadway stage). I found it to be in remarkable shape for a second preview, save some occasional lighting delays and some static buzz from one of the speakers in a couple points. Curious to see what about this show might shift in previews, and where it will go in the future.\n\nTitanique - Off-Broadway February, 2024 - TheatreCouple14\n\nCayleigh Capaldi (Céline Dion), Michael Williams (Jack), Lindsay Pearce (Rose), Nathan Lee Graham (Ruth), Frankie Grande (Victor Garber/Luigi), Terrance Williams Jr. (u/s The Seaman/Iceberg), Anne Fraser Thomas (Molly Brown), Brandon Contreras (Cal), Chani Maisonet (Background Vocalist), Garrett Poladian (Background Vocalist)\n\nNotes: Almost perfect wide-shot phone video from the front left orchestra. All action captured well, including pans to the scenes where actors were on the sides. Cayleighs last scheduled Céline performance before Nicole re-joined the cast. She is a powerhouse who is not to be missed! Very funny improv where she does impressions of Xtina, Jennifer Coolidge, and Hillary Duff. Then references the Super Bowl and Taylor Swift ignoring Céline at the Grammys. TheatreCouple14s master. Never to be sold. Gifting Encouraged. Includes video, audio (tracked and untracked), and cast board photo\n\nTitanique - Off-Broadway March, 2024 - TheatreCouple14\n\nTess Marshall (Céline Dion), Michael Williams (Jack), Lindsay Pearce (Rose), Russell Daniels (Ruth), Elliott Maddox (Victor Garber/Luigi), Marcus Antonio (The Seaman/Iceberg), Anne Fraser Thomas (Molly Brown), Garrett Poladian (u/s Cal), Cayleigh Capaldi (Background Vocalist), Terrance Williams (Background Vocalist), Anthony Luke Neville (Background Vocalist)\n\nNotes: Almost perfect wide-shot phone video from the front left orchestra. All action captured well, including pans to the scenes where actors were on the sides. Tess is absolutely amazing as Céline. Everyone in the cast sounded exceptional this performance. Hilarious improv where Jack and Rose do exercises off each other, including Lindsay picking Michael up on her back and doing squats. This cast works out. A lot. Includes video, audio (tracked and untracked), and cast board photo.\n\nTitanique - Off-Broadway April, 2024 - TheatreCouple14\n\nDee Roscioli (Céline Dion), Michael Williams (Jack), Lindsay Pearce (Rose), Russell Daniels (Ruth), Elliott Maddox (Victor Garber/Luigi), Marcus Antonio (The Seaman/Iceberg), Anne Fraser Thomas (Molly Brown), Brandon Contreras (Cal), Sarah Gallo (Background Vocalist), Chani Maisonet (Background Vocalist), Garrett Poladian (Background Vocalist)\n\nNotes: Near flawless wide-shot phone video from the front middle. All action captured well except scenes that were completely offstage in the aisle. (Less than 2% of the show). Hilarious physical comedy in the imrprov which has Lindsay and Michael acting like Godzilla Vs. Kong. The faces and poses made are meme-able for sure. Awesome vocals as usual from everyone on the ship. Still my favorite show. Includes video, audio (tracked and untracked), and cast board photo.\n\nLempicka - Broadway April, 2024 (Matinée) - TheatreCouple14\n\nMariand Torres (s/b Tamara De Lempicka), Amber Iman (Rafaela), Andrew Samsonky (Tadeusz Lempicki), George Abud (Marinetti), Natalie Joy Johnson (Suzy Solidor), Nathaniel Stampley (The Baron), Beth Leavel (The Baroness), Zoe Glick (Kizette), Alex Aquilino (Ensemble), Lauren Blackman (Ensemble), Stephen Brower (Ensemble), Kyle Brown (Ensemble), Holli' Conway (Ensemble), Abby Matsusaka (Ensemble), Jimin Moon (Ensemble), Khori Michelle Petinaud (Ensemble), Ximone Rose (Ensemble), Nicholas Ward (Ensemble)\n\nPretty decent wide-shot phone boot taken from the left Mezz. Safety bar can be seen at the bottom through the show, but only covers up action in 2 or 3 songs. Some unfocusing throughout when the reflection of the orchestra boxes can be seen. Mariand Torress debut as Tamara and the cast and audience absolutely LOVED her. Includes composer Matt Goulds speech introducing her. Very enthusiastic crowd. Such a beautiful show with an incredible, catchy score. Includes video, audio (tracked and untracked), and cast board photo\n\nNatasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812 | Cygnet Theatre | MP4 | Highlights May, 2024 - MTTZ's Master\n\nSelena Ceja (Natasha), Kürt Norby (Pierre), Megan Carmitchel (Sonya), Linda Libby (Marya), Michael Louis Cusimano (Anatole), Jasmine January (Hélène), Tanner Vydos (Dolokhov), Brittany Adriana Carrillo (Mary/Opera Singer/Maidservant), Brian Mackey (Andrey/Bolkonsky), Luke H. Jacobs (Balaga/Servant/Opera Singer)\n\nNotes: Mediocre vertical phone highlights of this incredible regional staging of this show, about 15 minutes of act 1 and about 35 minutes of act 2. Some action is missed, out of focus, or blocked by heads. I had a major coughing fit right at the end of the show that is audible and causes shaking for about 3-4 minutes. There's some really beautiful stuff here from this powerhouse cast that makes it worth a watch if you're a big fan of this show, but don't expect great quality.\n\nLempicka - Broadway May, 2024 (Matinée) - TheatreCouple14\n\nEden Espinosa (Tamara De Lempicka), Amber Iman (Rafaela), Andrew Samsonky (Tadeusz Lempicki), George Abud (Marinetti), Natalie Joy Johnson (Suzy Solidor), Nathaniel Stampley (The Baron), Beth Leavel (The Baroness), Zoe Glick (Kizette), Alex Aquilino, Lauren Blackman, Stephen Brower, Kyle Brown, Holli' Conway, Abby Matsusaka, Jimin Moon, Khori Michelle Petinaud, Ximone Rose, Nicholas Ward\n\nNotes: Very Good wide-shot phone boot filmed from the right orchestra. Minimal washout except a few scenes that are super bright. Less than 3% of the show. No obstruction except heads on the very bottom of the stage, only covers shoes in certain scenes. Slight unfocusing throughout in high-contrast scenes. Delightful mess-up when Eden drops one of the cookies during the Madeleine scene. Exceptional audience that actually appreciates this beautiful art that has become my favorite show this year. So sad it didnt last too long on Broadway, because it truly is a gem of a show.\n\nAudios:\n\nSister Act - West End August 11, 2010 (Matinée) - Unknown\n\nPatina Miller (Deloris Van Cartier/Sister Mary Clarence), Whoopi Goldberg (t/r Mother Superior), Jacquelin Clarke (Mary Lazarus), Claire Greenway (Mary Patrick), Katie Rowley Jones (Mary Robert), Simon Webbe (Shank), Thomas Goodridge (TJ), Ako Mitchell (Eddie), Ian Lavender (Monsignor Howard), Kerry Enright (LaRosa), Asya O'Flaherty (Kay-T), Ivan de Freitas (Denero)\n\nHadestown - Broadway August 21, 2019 (Matinée) - Unknown\n\nReeve Carney (Orpheus), Eva Noblezada (Eurydice), Patrick Page (Hades), Amber Gray (Persephone), André De Shields (Hermes), Kimberly Marable (u/s Fate), Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer (Fate), Kay Trinidad (Fate), Khaila Wilcoxon (s/w Worker), Ahmad Simmons (Worker), Afra Hines (Worker), Timothy Hughes (Worker)\n\nNotes: Kimberlys debut as one of the Fates!\n\nHadestown - Broadway August 22, 2019 - Hadesundergroundtrades\n\nReeve Carney (Orpheus), Jessie Shelton (u/s Eurydice), Patrick Page (Hades), Amber Gray (Persephone), André De Shields (Hermes), Kimberly Marable (u/s Fate), Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer (Fate), Kay Trinidad (Fate), Ahmad Simmons (Worker), John Krause (Worker), Khaila Wilcoxon (s/w Worker), Afra Hines (Worker), Timothy Hughes (Worker)\n\nNotes: Show is holding up beautifully, everyone appears to be in top form. Jessie is so different from Eva and I think I enjoy both interpretations equally for different reasons. Her vocals are fantastic, there is one small flub during Flowers where she skips ahead in lyrics but it was fairly well covered.\n\nHadestown - Broadway December 10, 2019 - HBCFG\n\nReeve Carney (Orpheus), Eva Noblezada (Eurydice), Timothy Hughes (u/s Hades), Kimberly Marable (u/s Persephone), André De Shields (Hermes), Jewelle Blackman (Fate), Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer (Fate), Kay Trinidad (Fate), Malcolm Armwood (s/w Worker), Jessie Shelton (s/w Worker), Anthony Chatmon II (Worker), John Krause (Worker), Khaila Wilcoxon (s/w Worker)\n\nHadestown -

File includes Queen board photo.\n\nThe Wiz || June 8th 2024 (E) | Broadway | BoqTheMunchkin’s Master | Untracked\n\nCast: Nichelle Lewis (Dorothy), Allyson Kaye Daniel (u/s Aunt Em/Evillene), Judith Franklin (u/s Glinda), Avery Wilson (Scarecrow), Phillip Johnson Richardson (Tinman), Kyle Ramar Freeman (Lion), Mariah Lyttle (u/s Addapearle), Wayne Brady (The Wiz).\n\nNotes: Recorded from front side mezzanine. Due to latecomers through out, there’s shuffle here and there. The man in the row in front of me also fell asleep at various times, so you may hear him at times. Wonderful cast, so much talent there. All 3 witch understudies were fabulous and this is perhaps Mariah’s Adapearle debut (?) - a role she does not cover! Obsessed with Nichele and the trio! File includes full understudy board, encore, and company board.\n\nThe Importance of Being Earnest - Strawdog Theatre - June 9, 2024 Matinee - MP3 - soysaucepierre's master\n\nCast - Johnard Washington (John Worthing), Andi Muriel (Cecily Cardew), Jack Seijo (Algernon Moncrieff), Michael Reyes (Lady Bracknell), Kade Cox (Gwendolen Fairfax), Crystal Claros (Rev. Canon Chasuble), Lynne Baker (Miss Prism), Matt Keeley (Merriman)\n\nNotes - An interesting modern queer retelling of this show set in Chicago Boystown and Michigan of all places. A lot of the dialogue has been changed. Gwendolen was a drag queen and she stole the show singlehandedly. Audio is pretty alright but my partner was wearing bracelets so sometimes those make noise along with squeaky chairs. Set changes have been edited out as they took roughly a minute each and it's dead air otherwise. Apologies because you can hear both me and my partner cackling at certain lines.\n\nMean Girls 10th June 2024 - Savoy Theatre, West End - m4a untracked\n\nCharlie Burn (Cady Heron), Georgina Castle (Regina George), Elèna Gyasi (Gretchen Wieners), Grace Mouat (Karen Smith), Elena Skye (Janis Sarkisian), Tom Xander (Damian Hubbard), Daniel Bravo (Aaron Samuels), Lucca Chadwick-Patel (Kevin Ganatra), Ako Mitchell (Mr Duvall), Zoë Rainey (Ms Heron / Ms Norbury / Mrs George)\n\nNotes: magicinthemess' master.

Mostly wideshots and mediums with a few close-ups. Lots of heads show up in frame from time to time and sometimes block action, particularly on the left. Some spotlight washout from time to time, and minor issues with focusing throughout. Due to memory card issues, from the middle of Skid Row to the middle of Grow For Me is missing, audio has been fed in from an external source. Very kindly edited by the incredible Medium Observation.\n\nHere We Are - Off-Broadway (The Shed) November 22, 2023 - bikinibottomday\n\nRachel Bay Jones (Marianne Brink), Bobby Cannavale (Leo Brink), Micaela Diamond (Fritz), Amber Gray (Claudia Bursik-Zimmer), Jeremy Shamos (Paul Zimmer), Steven Pasquale (Raffael Santello Di Santicci), David Hyde Pierce (Bishop), Denis O'Hare (Man), Tracie Bennett (Woman), Jin Ha (Soldier), Francois Battiste (Colonel Martin)\n\nNotes: Excellent 4K capture of Sondheim’s final musical.

Three short blackouts in Act One, after All Ive Ever Known (30 seconds), in the middle of Hey Little Songbird (25 seconds), and the intro to “Wait For Me” (15 seconds). Occasional wandering / readjusting and unfocusing.

Betts (Evillene/Aunt Em), Allyson Kaye Daniel (Addaperle)\n\nNotes:\n\nA frustratingly obstructed full show video capture of this Pre-Broadway tour. Act 2 is MUCH better than act 1, capturing much more action and a lot of beautiful closeups. You cant see much of anything for the first 10 minutes due to obstruction, and there are a few very brief dropouts in both acts. Audio is crystal clear for both acts. Very performance heavy wherever possible, with close-ups and focus on individual performers whenever within view.

Amy was the only female ensemble, so Rory and Sammy were covering all the others, as well as Sam and Luke's tracks. Most notably Rory covering Laura's Orphanage lines before Objects, and Sammy doing the dance solo with James Lowrie during Anything For Love (though it was Sammy doing James' usual part, and James covering Rebecca's).

The show then stopped for about 10 minutes and then they started from the beginning of the show. The video shot around heads, especially one a small portion of the left side of the stage. But I did work around it quite well so not much action is missed.

There’s one head blocking the far left of the stage but I did work around it quite well as well as one head that blocked the bottom left of the stage, but worked around it.

Sorry if it's quiet or muffled! I don't really know what went wrong this time. Some fun understudy action! J. Antonio is adorable as Orpheus and is a really nice contrast to Morgan's angrier Eurydice. Levi's Hermes is starting to grow on me slowly. Such a good show and definitely hits different live. My friend I was with can be heard occasionally commenting during applause breaks. Includes audio of We Raise Our Cups.\n\nHadestown - BroadwayJuly 1, 2023 - musain Matinée\n\nReeve Carney (Orpheus), Eva Noblezada (Eurydice), Tom Hewitt (Hades), Alex Puette (u/s Hades), Lindsey Hailes (u/s Persephone), Lillias White (Hermes), Amelia Cormack (Fate), Grace Yoo (u/s Fate), Brit West (Fate), Emily Afton (Worker), Malcolm Armwood (Worker), Sojourner Brown (s/w Worker), Sayo Oni (Worker), Alex Puette (Worker), Brandon Cameron (s/w Worker)\n\nNOTES: Tom Hewitt as Hades during Act One, Alex Puette as Hades during Act Two (With Brandon Cameron taking the place of Alex's worker track). They held during intermission for a few minutes (which, obviously, is not part of the audio) before announcing that Alex would be Hades during Act Two. He was absolutely STELLAR. Tom and Alex are quite different as Hades, both of them amazing in their own ways. If I can say so myself, I think this audio is great for someone who really wants to compare the two side by side.\n\nHadestown | Broadway | March 5, 2024\n\nCAST: Jordan Fisher (Orpheus), Lola Tung (Eurydice), Phillip Boykin (Hades), Brit West (u/s Persephone), Lillias White (Hermes), Belén Moyano (Fate), Kay Trinidad (Fate), Alex Lugo (u/s Fate)\n\nNOTES: pirellis miracle elixir's master. good ol' first row audio.

Shot very well, with a couple brief dropouts in act 1. Some heads can sometimes be seen at the bottom of the screen during wideshots. Some minor wandering.

Edited to reduce visual noise and harsh colors, but the quality is not great and spotlight washout is still harsh in some scenes. Occasional dropouts due to actors and crew passing by, especially in act 2. Shot around a shoulder which often occupies large chunks of the screen and blocks some of the action.\n\nAudios:\n\nMerrily We Roll Along - Broadway - April 2, 2024 Matinee\n\nJonathan Groff (Franklin Shepard), Koray Tarhan (u/s Charley Kringas), Lindsay Mendez (Mary Flynn), Katie Rose Clarke (Beth), Krystal Joy Brown (Gussie Carnegie), Reg Rogers (Joe), Max Rackenberg (Frank Jr.), Ensemble: Sherz Aletaha (Scotty/Mrs. Spencer/Auditionee), Leana Rae Concepcion (Claudia/Newscaster/Auditionee), Coby Getzug (Bunker/Newscaster/Photographer), Evan Alexander Smith (s/w Tyler), Talia Robinson (Meg Kincaid), Jamila Sabares-Klemm (Dory/Evelyn/Pianist), Ken Krugman (s/w Greg from Paramount), Brianna Stoute (Mimi from Paramount/Make-Up Artist), Christian Strange (Ru/Reverend), Vishal Vaidya (Jerome), Natalie Wachen (KT), Jacob Keith Watson (Terry/Mr. Spencer)\n\nNotes: Koray’s Charley debut.

Act 1 stops at the very beginning of This World Will Remember Us right before the music speeds up due to a recording error (Act 2 is complete). Includes video of bows, encore, and speeches, and the digital playbill (.pdf). There is some talking from the other people at my table, but nothing super loud or disruptive.\n\nHello Dolly – Mansfield – November 11, 2023 – M4a (Untracked)\n\ncast: Jennifer Simard (Dolly Gallagher Levi), Jeff Richmond (Horace Vandergelder), Jacob Sustersic (Cornelius Hacki), Shauna Marie (Irene Molloy), Leah Gesouras (Minnie Fay), Dru Loman (Barnaby Tucker), Emily Bare (Ermengarde), Dre’lan Evans (Ambrose Kemper), Caroline Grace Williams (Ernestina), Jacque Workman (Mrs. Rose), Joe Trolian (Judge), Noah Casner (Ensemble), Madison Kearney (Ensemble), Carter King (Ensemble), Cassandra Kurek (Ensemble), Jackie Metz (Ensemble), Bobby Morrow (Ensemble), Zakari Ramos (Ensemble), Emily Roblin (Ensemble), Nathan Roblin (Ensemble), Drew Anderson (Ensemble), Wyatt Bechstein (Ensemble), Stephanie Hayslip (Ensemble), Molly McClanahan (Ensemble), Milo McDonald (Ensemble), Alyssa Racer (Ensemble)\n\nCabaret Broadway 4/4/24\n\nEddie Redmayne (Emcee), Gayle Rankin (Sally Bowles), Bebe Neuwirth (Fraulein Schneider), Ato Blankson-Wood (Clifford Bradshaw), Steven Skybell (Herr Schultz), Henry Gottfried (Ernst Ludwig), Natascia Diaz (Fritzie/Fraulein Kost), Gabi Campo (Frenchie), Ayla Ciccone-Burton (Helga), Colin Cunliffe (Hans), Marty Lauter (Victor), Loren Lester (Herman/Max), David Merino (Lulu), Julian Ramos (Bobby), MiMi Scardulla (Texas), Paige Smallwood (Rosie)\n\nNotes: Fourth preview\n\nApril 3rd 2024\n\nVideos:\n\nVictor/Victoria - Broadway July 22, 1997 - Unknown\n\nRacquel Welch (Victoria Grant), Michael Nouri (King Marchan), Tony Roberts (Carroll Todd), Rachel York (Norma Cassidy), Michael Cripe (Richard Di Nardo), Gregory Jbara (Squash [Mr. Bernstein])\n\nNOTES: Heads block off much of the left side of the screen, and some generational loss.

Stunning closeup, medium and wonderful wide shots. A small amount of washout in the wider shots. There’s a small 20 second blackout after “Cornet Man.” Some wandering and focus issues here and there. Audio for Act 1 can be a bit muffled versus Act 2 which was much clearer.\n\nThe Thanksgiving Play – Broadway – circa April 2023 – MP4 – StarCuffedJeans Master\n\ncast: D’Arcy Carden (Alicia), Katie Finneran (Logan), Scott Foley (Jaxton), Chris Sullivan (Caden) notes: A beautiful quality video taken from the right middle orchestra. Beautiful closeup, medium and wide shots.
