        "text": "Bree Williamson apparently loved playing Tess, which, sigh. I never know how much weight to give that kind of thing - I get why Tess would be more fun to play than constant weeping or sexual assaults, and actors are allowed opinions like anyone else - but I think if RC/FV weren't interested in the Tesscapades, BW's preferences wouldn't matter, no matter how much of a favorite she might have been.\n\nWhat I do know is that it's weird when an actor's preferred modes go against their own strengths as an actor. I don't know what that's about. BW was not good as Tess. She was good at playing an angry or grieving Jessica. Those scenes with Natalie after Nash died? I felt her rage. She was also good at playing Jess... I'm not sure how to describe it. It felt fake and saccharine when Jess was supposed to be overly sweet, but when she was just...being a person, I guess, she was believable. Especially when she was the calm, cool counterpoint to fiery Natalie.\n\nKristen Alderson was another one. She reportedly preferred the sweet young heroine stuff. Put aside the fact that Starr should never have been that, KA was terrible at it and her talent and/or skills devolved playing those stories. I think the ingenue role is deceptively difficult to play. Erin Torpey could do it, KA could not. She noticeably improved when Starr was written with some bite.\n\nOh, I absolutely hate the DID retcon. It was both gross and impossible and, like I've said before, the worst thing to ever happen to the character of Jessica. (ETA: It tainted other characters, too. Viki, obviously. Clint, who managed not to notice his wife's alter dragging his little daughter out to bars at night. Ditto Kevin, who was, of course, very sorry.) Granted, she had already been near-ruined by being turned into Antonio's dimwitted girlfriend/unpaid nanny, but surely there were better ways to move her on from that than a nasty kiddie porn backstory and alters. That's on Higley, but Ron should have left it alone. If he absolutely had to do his own spin on DID (he didn't), he absolutely should have left it alone after the truth about Chloe and Hope came out. I mean, Viki would often go years without an alter showing up, right? Because Viki was a strong character as herself.\n\nBut, no, I don't think BW was good as Tess, or at least that she got worse every time Tess showed up. She mugged and pouted and sneered and it all felt hollow to me. Sure, you could say that maybe that was fitting for a personality fragment as opposed to an actual person, but, honestly, I think that's giving her performance too much credit.\n\nEdited May 25, 2017 by Melgaypet\n\nSo I came to this show super late. I caught bits and pieces as a kid while my mom left the tv on for General Hospital. Didn't really bother to go back until back in 2012-2013 when Todd/Blair/Starr/Tea/McBain all went to GH for a bit. Gravitated towards Todd for \"some reason\". Went back and watched his storyline from the 93 Marty rape through the Tale of Two Todds. Really feel like his storyline was pretty much done after he feigned DID. He betrayed everyone once again and needed to go. It was kind of jarring seeing him return and being a bit of a computer wiz in the 2000's and tbh I didn't like the writing much then. There were a few good moments. When he had the wedding from Hell with Blair, but that's it. Didn't like Victor/Todd too much. Felt like they just wanted the character to be around so they could revisit all his old stories again with Marty and Powell and multiple rape trials.\n\nAnyways recently in the last year I started venturing beyond that and I have to say I gravitated towards the late 80's. The show was gold then. I finally got why Max Holden was such a big deal, because I hated his guts in pretty much every early 2000's storyline with Todd. Might have become my favorite character. Thought his romance with Megan was really well done. Haven't yet gotten to much of the the Jake/Megan storyline (aside from already watching her death scene, which is one of if not the best SOAP deaths I've seen). But Max and Megan was crazy fun. Totally see why it ended though. Max and Gabrielle was white hot. I haven't watched too much Luna yet either so who knows. Everyone during that era was great though and they all had really distinct characters with nuances that were well thought out. Like how Megan would be this soft caring person when she was with Max or Vicki or anybody she was growing close to but would become \"Ms the the revolves around me\" soap actress whenever she was in public.\n\nI still have a ton to watch. Just wanted to say that I recently binged this thread and loved the videos and insight you all have had. It's really helped me get more of an understanding of the characters and where to see the storylines heading. If anyone has any good pointers, I'm all ears. Thinking I need to check out some of the Eterna storyline.\n\nWhen OLTL was having its creative renaissance in the early and mid-90s, I was in middle school and then high school. At that age, it's especially easy to overlook performers in the \"thankless\" roles. Later on, you watch the episodes again and realize that they were the glue. I am referring to Bob Krimmer as Rev. Andrew Carpenter. He had to put up with so much - from his father's adulterous relationship with Viki to church gossip and especially Marty's shenanigans - but handled it all with class and grace. He was a good husband to Cassie (their wedding and honeymoon scenes were very tender and romantic), and even after everything Marty had put him through, Andrew never doubted that she had been raped and along with Cassie was there to help her out every step of the way. Bob Krimmer should have been Emmy nominated for his work, but he made it all look so easy that it was probably easy to overlook him in favor of flashier actors.\n\nOf course, once writers like Malone/Griffith and producers like Gottleib/Bedsow-Horgan were no longer around, no one knew what to do with Andrew and the character eventually fell by the wayside. Both actor and character deserved better.\n\nA decent sprinkling of fascinating eps from spring-summer 1992 are on YT - fairly early Gottlieb/Malone, back when they were still fully committed to Grace Phillips' Sarah Buchanan and Mia Korf's Blair.\n\nThey're pretty interesting stuff, and give some of us who weren't watching then a better sense of the timeframe on several storylines: NuSarah's pill addiction (and apparent crush on her shrink) came not long after her return from the dead and is already wrapped up by April or May, and now they've moved onto her and Bo reunited just in time for her to become the prime suspect in the Carlo Hesser murder case. Cain and Tina are getting a bit too intimate too fast for me after the recent demise of the love of her life in November(?). The reveal about Blair and Addie is slowly parceled out, and in early May Blair tells Max everything about who she is and where she came from while Elaine Princi's excellent Dorian tells Cassie harrowing stories about her childhood. I loved Kassie DePaiva's Blair and always will, but it's still unconscionable what OLTL pulled after Mia Korf quit to go back to the stage - I can't remember the last time any soap in America had as much of a commitment to an AAPI lead before or after Blair in '92, including any of the few Asian-American characters onscreen today. She is a central, incredibly important player in story, bouncing between Max, Asa and her vendetta against Dorian and for my money she is great. Simmering in early eps is Lee Ann feeling trapped in the Buchanan clan, spending more and more time with Jason Webb to Viki's consternation, and the slow disintegration of Asa and Renee as he becomes more infatuated with Blair.\n\nAlso present: The incredibly earnest and annoying \"Maggie Vega\" character, a Latino police officer they'd apparently intended to pair with Andrew (and you can tell in these episodes) until they failed to secure their planned hire (allegedly, Saundra Santiago post-Miami Vice and pre-GL) and Bob Krimmer turned out to have more chemistry with Laura Bonarrigo. Sloan Carpenter has only just arrived. And LaTanya Richardson, Mrs. Samuel L. Jackson herself, appears as the original Rodi who figures into the Hank Gannon/Sheila Price/Troy Nichols triangle. I have a lot of fondness for Terry Alexander (Troy) from his role in Day of the Dead, but he cannot compete with Hank. Hank comes on very strong and very broad in these episodes in a way that would not fly today - he is often a brash asshole, and they only take him down a few pegs in some of the subsequent eps here. The writing for Troy - pushing him as a stodgy, white-collar man who can't relate to Sheila or Hank's interests - feels a little too convenient and broad as well in that classic Malone way, in that I don't remember the Troy in episodes from '90?/'91 seeming too much like a stuffed shirt even if I also didn't find him too interesting. That said, Nathan Purdee does have great chemistry with Valarie Pettiford, who is the only Sheila I ever liked and I like her more the more I see her as an adult. You can see why Purdee quit Y&R for OLTL initially. I remember Gottlieb in an interview making much of their hiring Black writers for this story and saying they wanted to show two different types of Black modern men, for whatever that is worth. Either way, whatever peaks or valleys it has it doesn't feel like the \"Black story\" is an afterthought in these episodes.\n\nI still like Grace Phillips a lot as Sarah, but that may be my anti-Jensen Buchanan bias. Either way, she clashed with Linda Gottlieb and was out not too long after all this big push. Either the BTS issues or unpopularity were strong enough that I believe she took most of the summer or fall off and then returned just in time to die within one or two episodes. (Nora had already been introduced a couple months before and begun sparking with Bo.) I'd love to hear more takes from those who've seen the eps, or those were there and remember more.\n\nEdited January 28, 2023 by jsbt\n\nI like Jason Webb a lot myself. I thought they dropped the ball with him later on. I remember they reintroduced the social consciousness of the show quickly with him and Sheila in August and September(?) of '91 by having Jason shown working in the loading dock at the Banner where Kevin had to apprentice for his parents, and Jason the troublemaker convinces Kevin and I think Lee Ann to go joyriding with him. Not long after that there is a subplot where the monied ladies of Llanview object to Sheila starring in the local charity musical or whatever because she's Black - there is a beautiful scene with Valarie Pettiford and John Loprieno dueting together, and I believe Luna and KW's amazing Tina (who I will admit sometimes edges out Andrea Evans for me, because she melds Andrea's persona with the more conscious '90s so well) get involved. Slight material to pad out a slow period, but I thought it was sweet stuff. (The end credits here don't show Gottlieb or Malone, but I think that's simply because it's very early in the transitional period over August and September - I remember Gottlieb saying she cast Mark Brettschneider as Jason Webb, who's already credited).\n\nI'm pretty sure Lee Ann knew Duke was Kevin's by the '92 eps but don't quote me (I also haven't seen the first couple of these eps in a month or two). I did find it very weird that they pushed hard on playing Yasmine Bleeth who read so young with both Maxes (Nicholas Walker and JdP) before and after the big creative switch in 1991. There were and probably still are a handful of Gottlieb/Malone eps from fall '91 online with Nicholas Walker still in the role of Max and still hot and heavy for Lee Ann. It's very weird. I'm not sure what his exit was like or how long there was in between his exit and JdP returning. I do know Lee Ann was still hung up on Max for a bit longer, with teen Kevin pursuing her and complaining about having to compete with the older man.\n\nNot long after Gottlieb took over though, they had Lee Ann starting to move to Kevin and quickly brought in Luna and then Blair for Max, playing the long game with Max and Luna, so clearly they knew they'd be pulling away from Max and Lee Ann sooner than later. I thought it was a bad mistake not bringing a recast Lee Ann in in the 2000s to make trouble with Kevin, Kelly and an appropriately-aged Duke as opposed to over-SORASing and killing him.\n\nThey do a great job illustrating the haves and have nots with Lee Ann and the Buchanans, around the same time Viki first meets Sloan and is later tempted herself. I need to rewatch the material from late '91 where a fire burns Llanfair to a crisp, giving Gottlieb the excuse to remodel it; there was some wonderful Viki and Clint material during that, and it makes you wonder what the Clint/Viki/Sloan triangle would've looked like as originally planned, where allegedly Clint was to be the ultimate victor and Sloan would've presumably died earlier. This did not happen due to Clint Ritchie's tractor accident (and, I suspect, his well-known alcoholism which Linda Gottlieb cracked down on).\n\nEdited January 29, 2023 by jsbt\n\n4 hours ago, Melgaypet said:\n\nFor years I wrongly thought he was River's biological father, so I blamed all of River's suckassedness on him, heh. I just really never liked Jason and his stupid ponytail.\n\nI can't recall if River's father was ever named. I do know Jason was in love with River's mother, who died of the weird virus floating around the hospital in '94. He kept striking out in love and then left town IIRC. River was another very poorly served character, lol.\n\nThey never fully pulled the trigger on Jason and Marty (or Kevin and Marty or Andrew and Marty, for that matter) and should've. But I also liked him and Dorian, pre-Joey. Speaking of: I think I've mentioned this before, but the soap mags from the period have the show claiming they originally considered pairing Dorian with Chris McKenna's Joey pre-Fillion. Chris McKenna is my favorite Joey (and is a very hot daddy today), but he was maybe 14-16 at the time of that being considered and looked younger. Obviously the network said no way. I think they were hoping McKenna would mature real fast, which is why they very awkwardly tested him with a visibly older Reiko Aylesworth (Rebecca) in '93 or '94 before letting him go.\n\n4 hours ago, TeeVee329 said:\n\nAh okay I did some Googling and I think I got Jason confused with Suede Pruitt, who 1) is also basically just a name to me, 2) was also involved with Marty, as was Jason, and 3) was killed by Todd, but not in a boat explosion.\n\nSuede Pruitt is a whole other situation, lol. It is beyond me why the show put Marty with him vs. the many other eligible men I just mentioned. He had a very convoluted Southern gothic backstory with Luna, but while that worked for Michael Malone sometimes Suede just did not for me.\n\nEdited January 30, 2023 by jsbt"
