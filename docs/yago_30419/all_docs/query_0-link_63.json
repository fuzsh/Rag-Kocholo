        "text": "by Debbie Koma (aka DCDeb)\n\nFeature Article\n\nThis article appeared in the September 12, 2000, Issue #48 of ALL EARS® (ISSN: 1533-0753)\n\nI was lucky enough to visit Walt Disney World last September during the ABC Super Soap Weekend. For anyone wondering what it might be like this year, here's a brief review of last year's event. I'm fairly certain this will at least give a general idea of what goes on during this event.\n\nWell, what can I say? Speaking as a WDW commando-type who doesn't watch the soaps, I found waiting in line for autographs for hours at a time to be a monumental waste of time. (No flames, please — I'm not saying anyone is wrong for enjoying the soaps and their stars. It's just that if I'm in WDW I can think of other things — lots of other things — that I'd rather be doing.)\n\nBut… my sister was the reason I even made this trip, a fact I had to keep reminding myself of, so I made sure she got to where she needed to be to maximize her celebrity- sighting time.\n\n>From a WDW fan's perspective: I felt WDW had the event fairly well-organized, distributing the stars throughout the park to manage crowds. And were there ever crowds!\n\nMobs, even! You couldn't get near Susan Lucci's little empire, set up back on Mickey Avenue in one of the soundstages. In fact, to see her you had to have a voucher, distributed on first-come, first-served basis.\n\nBecause most of the folks were there for the soaps, the lines for the attractions at the Studios those two days were pretty much non-existent: Star Tours (which we rode 5 times over the course of 2 days) was a walk-on, as were Tower of Terror, the Backlot Tour, and Great Movie Ride. There was a 20-minute wait for the Rock N Roller Coaster, but even that seemed manageable. My only complaint was that the event had commandeered the theater Doug is shown in for a Soap Opera Talk Show — and so there was no Doug for the entire weekend.\n\n>From a soap fan's perspective: My sister felt that the autograph sessions were fairly well-managed, except for the fact that CMs were not as well-informed as they might have been.\n\nFor example, when we arrived in the line for Cameron Mathison's autograph (Ryan, All My Children) shortly after 9 a.m., my sister was already #106. The CMs discouraged her, saying that only up to #50 would get an autograph, but she waited around for a photo and was glad she did. When this young hunk arrived, he treated his adoring fans to quite a show, stripping off his shirt and falling into the crowd, ala mosh pit. I was afraid that my sister, one of the \"lucky\" ones upon whom he fell, was going to need CPR afterwards. She was ecstatic with the \"show\" he put on, but she left after taking some pictures, only to find out later that he had signed nearly 150 autographs — she could have gotten his autograph and was a bit put out at having been discouraged by the Cast Members.\n\nAfter we had learned the \"system\" for getting autographs, we used our time more efficiently, and my sister was able to snag pictures with her two faves, Wally Kurth and Billy Warlock, then just collected pre-signed promo photos of the rest of the celebrities.\n\nWe had no problem snapping pix of the stars as they were signing for others, and got close enough to talk to many of them even over the shouts of \"We love you, Vincent!\" and \"You're so handsome, Michael!\" We noticed that at least one of the autograph lines was relocated later in the day to a more sheltered spot — a smart move, since the weather was alternating between scorchingly hot and humid and heavy, but brief, downpours.\n\nJackie experienced the full range of the soap events, sitting in on one of the Talk Show sessions, the game show, viewing the motorcades — and she was a happy camper. I think she'd go to SSW again, despite all the waiting and the madness of the crowds.\n\nThe celebs for this year's Super Soap Weekend have been announced on the ABC site. They are (subject to change):\n\n*All My Children\n\nSusan Lucci (Erica Kane)\n\nJohn Callahan (Edmund Grey)\n\nJosh Duhamel (Leo du Pres)\n\nCameron Mathison (Ryan Lavery)\n\nEsta TerBlanche (Gillian Andrassy Martin)\n\n*One Life To Live\n\nLinda Dano (Rae Cummings)\n\nKamar de los Reyes (Antonio Vega)\n\nJim DePaiva (Max Holden)\n\nKassie DePaiva (Blair Holden)\n\nDavid Fumero (Cristian Vega)\n\nErika Page (Roseanne Delgado)\n\nJason-Shane Scott (Will Rappaport)\n\nHillary B. Smith (Nora Buchanan)\n\nErin Torpey (Jessica Buchanan)\n\n*General Hospital\n\nRebecca Herbst (Elizabeth Webber)\n\n*Port Charles\n\nThorsten Kaye (Ian Thornhart)\n\nJon Lindstrom (Kevin Collins)\n\nJulie Pinson (Eve Lambert Collins)\n\nHave you attended a Super Soap Weekend?
