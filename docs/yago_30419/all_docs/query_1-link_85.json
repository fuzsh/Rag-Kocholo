        "text": "NOTE: The 2008 Super Soap Weekend at Disney's Hollywood Studios marked the last time this event will be held in Orlando. ABC's Daytime Division will instead send its soap opera stars on a 2009 Soap Nation Tour, a collection of nationwide events designed to interact with fans on a year-round basis offering greater access to stars in more cities, more often. The final Walt Disney World weekend was dedicated to the fans with special retrospectives and exclusive productions. For the full release, click HERE.\n\nClick HERE for 2008 Photos!\n\nClick HERE for 2007 Photos!\n\nClick HERE for 2006 Photos and Reports!\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOne weekend each fall, stars from the ABC soap operas make appearances at the Disney's Hollywood Studios. Park Guests are treated to a spectacular interactive weekend with their favorite actors and actresses from the ABC Daytime dramas All My Children, One Life to Live, and General Hospital.\n\nSUPER SOAP WEEKEND\n\n2008 DETAILS\n\nActress Susan Lucci headlined a star-studded lineup of more than 30 actors and actresses from the ABC Daytime dramas November 15-16, 2008, at the 13th annual ABC Super Soap Weekend at Disney's Hollywood Studios. Sherri Shepherd, co-host of The View, was on hand for the weekend. The actors held regular autograph sessions at stations throughout the park. Many of the stations are along New York Street and around Echo Lake.\n\nActors for the 2008 event were:\n\nABC Super Soap Weekend was the largest soap fan event held anywhere in the country. Festivities included autograph sessions, motorcades, interviews and talk shows, game shows, musical performances, and the chance to purchase one-of-a-kind memorabilia from the shows. The Colgate Total Street Jam will close the event each day with live musical performances by some favorite Daytime stars.\n\nTOURING TIPS\n\nCrowds for this event are huge — arrive early to see your favorite celebrities.\n\nThere is no additional ticket necessary for the Super Soap Weekend events — admission is included in regular theme park admission.\n\nTry to obtain a schedule of events before you visit the theme park, so that you can plan your day. Autograph sessions, talk shows and other activities are staggered throughout the day, and the stars rotate through the different events.\n\nDisney's FastPass, used in the theme parks to reduce wait times for attractions, has been used the last few years for \"On Location\" Autograph Sessions. It will work like this:\n\nFastPass for Super Soap Weekend will work much as regular FastPass works. Visit our FastPass page for details. Note that a FastPass ticket will be required for each autograph. There is no limit to the number of FastPass Tickets a person can get, but there is a capacity limit for each autograph session. However, once all the FastPass tickets are distributed for a particular actor, a limited number of Standby Tickets will be made available. Standby Tickets do not guarantee an autograph, though — standby ticket holders will be taken if there is time remaining in a session after all FastPass ticket holders have received their autographs.\n\n–ALL MY CHILDREN tickets will be distributed at Lights Motor Action Extreme Stunt Show.\n\n–ONE LIFE TO LIVE tickets will be distributed at Star Tours.\n\n–GENERAL HOSPITAL tickets will be distributed at Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular.\n\nTickets will be distributed on a first come, first serve basis. FastPasses will begin to be distributed when the park opens and are only good for Autograph Sessions that same day.\n\nFor the latest event updates, or more information about the ABC Super Soap Weekend Vacation package, check back to this site, call the Super Soap Hotline at (407) 397-6808 or visit the ABC-TV web site.\n\nAssistive Listening Devices from Guest Services Can Be Used at some of the Super Soap Weekend events.\n\nReflective Captioning available at some Super Soap Weekend events.\n\nWheelchair/ECV Users can take advantage of a special viewing area at the main (Sorcerer's Hat) stage. No standing is allowed in this area — all party members must remain seated in the chairs located in this area. Due to capacity, party sizes are limited in this area to three guests. (The guest traveling in a wheelchair, plus two members of their party.)\n\nKIDS AND CHARACTERS\n\nSuper Soap Weekend doesn't usually interfere with the scheduled character meet and greet opportunities at the Disney's Hollywood Studios, but some locations may be closed due to Super Soap events.
