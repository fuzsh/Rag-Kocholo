Gone at a young age…

Soaps.com’s Throwback Thursday takes readers back to September 16, 2003… the day of Keri Reynolds’ death. Keri arrived in Llanview in 2001 on the hunt to find her father. Though she initially thought he was Hank Gannon, later investigation proved her father was his brother RJ.

Keri soon met Antonio Vega and the couple quickly fell in love. Antonio’s mother Carlotta didn’t like Keri simply because she was RJ’s daughter, and RJ didn’t approve of the relationship because Antonio was his nemesis. Keri’s personality won Carlotta over, who gave Keri her blessing to accept Antonio’s marriage proposal. However, RJ wasn’t so easily onboard…

It’s no surprise that Antonio and Keri had a few roadblocks along the way, considering the crimes RJ was involved in – and Antonio’s bad luck of always being connected to them. During one of their breakups, Antonio had a one-night stand with a woman out of town, who turned out to be Keri’s mother Liz! Liz became pregnant but couldn’t carry the child to term, due to a heart condition. She kept the paternity from Antonio and allowed Keri to be her surrogate. At the end of this whole mess, Antonio realized the baby was his, confessed his fling to Keri then later everyone found out that the baby Keri had been carrying was actually hers and Antonio’s.

Keri couldn’t get over Antonio’s fling with her mother and left town with their daughter Jamie. After Antonio got involved with Jessica Buchanan, Keri returned and begged him to have a life with her and their daughter. Antonio refused, which led to Keri keeping Jamie from him and ultimately to her untimely death.
