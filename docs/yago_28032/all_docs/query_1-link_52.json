Then Suffolk captures Margaret, daughter of Reignier, who, though poor, is both King of Naples and Duke of Anjou and Maine. Suffolk falls in love with her. He offers to marry her to Henry, if her father will agree.\n\nAlarum. Excursions.

Now the time is come\n\n2255 25 That France must vail her lofty-plumèd crest\n\n2256 And let her head fall into England’s lap.\n\n2257 My ancient incantations are too weak,\n\n2258 And hell too strong for me to buckle with.\n\n2259 Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust.\n\n⌜She exits.⌝\n\np. 199\n\nExcursions.
