        "text": "Concino Concini, marquis d’Ancre (born, Florence [Italy]—died April 24, 1617, Paris, France) , marquis d’Ancre, was an Italian adventurer who dominated the French government during the first seven years of the reign of King Louis XIII (reigned 1610–43).\n\nThe son of a Florentine notary, Concini joined the entourage of Marie de Médicis shortly before she left Italy to marry the French king Henry IV (reigned 1589–1610). In 1601 he married the queen’s foster sister, Leonora Dori Galigai. Concini exercised such a strong influence over the queen that Henry IV threatened several times to banish him from the court. Upon the assassination of the king, Concini (now Marquis d’Ancre) and his wife acted as chief advisers to Marie, who had become regent for her young son, King Louis XIII. The Concinis treated Louis with contempt and set about enriching themselves at France’s expense."
