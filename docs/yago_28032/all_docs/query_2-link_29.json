        "text": "FLORENCE — Of the two Medici queens of France, Catherine, wife of Henry II, is easily the most famous, or rather notorious, on account of her part in inciting the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, the wholesale slaughter of Paris's Protestants, begun on Aug. 24, 1572.\n\nTwenty-eight years later, Marie de' Medici married Henry IV, whose Edict of Nantes of 1598 had declared freedom of conscience. Marie's influence on France was more benign, but after the triumph of her rival Cardinal de Richelieu, her reputation was systematically blackened. As the details of the endless court squabbles, machinations and petty intrigues that led to her final disgrace faded, without any genuine atrocities to her name, Marie became little more than an historical footnote.\n\nOver the last few years a group of French and Italian scholars has been re-evaluating her life. This led to an exhibition in 2003 at the Château de Blois, where Marie was imprisoned for a spell. A new version of the event, called \"Maria de' Medici: A Florentine Princess on the Throne of France\" - with additional sections on her early life and background - is now being held at the Palazzo Pitti, in the city where she was born in 1573 and raised. (The show continues until Sept. 6.)\n\nIn 1555, after the decisive defeat of his republican opponents, Cosimo de' Medici established himself and his clan as the absolute rulers of Tuscany. In 1569, the pope conferred on him the title Grand Duke while recognizing the family's hereditary right to rule the state. The holy Roman emperor following suit two years later.\n\nThis was only the beginning for the ferociously ambitious Medici, who were determined to make themselves major players on the world's political stage.\n\nWhen Michelangelo died in Rome in 1564, despite the artist's well-known republican sympathies, Cosimo hastened to have his body brought back to Florence, where he was interred with the honors of a new type of patron saint for a new age. This act was richly symbolic of the Medici's particularly single-minded use of art, artists and their productions as tools of diplomacy and the means of glorifying their family and the state, over which they now had absolute power.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
