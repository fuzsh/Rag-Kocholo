        "text": "As we all know, Enrique III of Navarre/Henri de Bourbon, Duc de Vendôme became a Catholic after succeeding to the French throne. He was married to the last of the Valois kings of France’s sister. However, the marriage had remained childless (although, if one believes the stories, neither had problems conceiving with other people). I’ve seen it posited, that the minute Henri IV had a son by Marguerite de Valois ‘la Reine Margot’, Catherine de Medicis would’ve had him done away with. Though, in the same breath, I will caution that Catherine was willing to see her own daughter supplanted when it became apparent (shortly before Catherine’s death) that Margot seemingly couldn’t give Henri a child, since she offered her own granddaughter (Margot’s niece, Christine of Lorraine OTL Grand Duchess of Tuscany) as a replacement wife for Henri.\n\nNow for my question, I’m unsure as to the grounds on which Henri and Margot’s annulment was granted – it could be anything from consanguinity (they were second cousins) to childlessness, to perhaps lack of consent for the marriage for the contracted parties (can’t remember the movie’s name, but Margot is shown as weeping at the wedding, and her brother the king gets up to beat her (although this could be a liberty, since Henri is in the movie also shown alongside at the altar, whilst in real life he was forced to remain on the porch of Notre Dame due to his not being Catholic)).\n\nBut, assuming childlessness (AFAIK a dispensation had been granted as to the consanguinity) was the reason, what if Margot had popped out a few living daughters (she herself was the healthiest of Catherine de Medicis’ children) before Henri becomes king of France? Could/would Henri still divorce her, since he would know that girls cannot succeed to the throne of France? Or would he simply take an attitude of que sera sera, maybe engineer the marriage of his youngest daughter to the prince de Condé’s son and watch Navarre and France go their separate ways once he dies? Or does he take the radical step of having the law changes so that his daughter can succeed?\n\nHenri IV, King of France [1589-], King of Navarre [1572-] (b.1553) m: 1572 Marguerite de Valois (b.1553)\n\n1. Madeleine (b.1573)\n\n2. Jeanne (b.1578)\n\n3. Catherine (b.1580)\n\n4. Charlotte (b.1581, d.1582)\n\n5. Antoinette (b.1584)\n\nOk so, most likely Marguerite de Valois and Henry IV of France are granted an annulment around 1595, when it is obvious the Queen will not have a son. Marguerite was not one to complain OTL and would most likely just do what she did OTL, while Henry marries most likely Marie de Medici and gets a son. Considering how it all went down OTL, unless Marguerite suddenly becomes a different woman through the miracle of childbirth, she isn't going to care and the French Princesses most likely stay Princesses.\n\nNow, the Bourbon Princesses are going to be sought after brides, particularly Madeline. I can see her being married late, after a brother is born. let's say the annulment goes through in 1595 and Madeline de Bourbon is married soon after her half-brother in born around 1597. Philip II of Spain is playing the long game, then I can see the Princess Madeline becoming Queen Magdalena (Magdalena being the Spanish version of Madeline in many cases). If she isn't barren (which we obviously don't want), she might fix up the gene pool. Let's say Philip III of Spain and his Queen Magdalena undergo 5 pregnancies, with 4 children surviving (2 boys, 2 girls).\n\nNow for the other Princesses: Jeanne (b.1578), Catherine (b.1580) and Antoinette (b.1584) (as the OP specified, the Princess Charlotte (b.1581: d.1582) died young). Jeanne I can see being married to Charles, Duke of Guise as a way to bring the Guise family under the royal prerogative. I can also imagine Catherine de Bourbon being a short-lived first wife of Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor, maybe until 1600. The Princess Antoinette might make a good second bride for Henry II, Duke of Lorraine after her Aunt dies in 1604, as she'd be only 20. With this bride, the Duke might actually have a living son and and let's say 2 children out of 6 survive, a boy and girl.\n\nHenri IV of France (b.1553: d.1610) m.

Do we see more intermarriage between the houses of Rohan and Bourbon? Does Spain attempt to annex Navarre outright? Or France? (It wouldn't be the first time that either had tried to do so)?\n\nAnd if no marriage to Marie de Medicis, does Henri IV still get assassinated (the two things are seemingly unrelated, but somewhere I read that she knew about the attempt beforehand, but did nothing)? Or does he die a natural death? And does France fall to infighting again - between the Prince de Condé and his uncles?\n\nBump?\n\nThe de Rohan family was pretty in-your-face and all-round pompous a-holes OTL from what I can make out (at least several key members of the family seem to have been), how does Navarre fare with them now being a king?

By all accounts, Catherine de Parthenay was a brilliant woman with a complete humanist education, able both to write court theatre and to coordinate the efforts of the protestant nobility. Henri II was quite appreciated by the Protestant leaders of his time (he was the godfather of Charles I, for example).\n\nI want to point out that Navarre, outside of its royal title, has few thing to offer : since 1512, all Baja Navarra (our spanish Navarre) is firmly held by the Spanish. So the true base of power of a navarrese king were his lordships in France itself. From this perspective, the Rohans, though quite rich, were light-years away from Henri III/IV. The french succession law dictated that all lordships held in France by a king before his accession to the throne must merge with the crown's patrimony. Henri IV was unwilling to do so, some of his lordships, of uncertain status (Béarn, Andorra), were not merged into the crown's lands before Louis XIII's times. If Henri IV has no heir, he could favor the Rohans by giving them Béarn in addition to the tiny Haute Navarre, but nothing more, though they are the lawful heirs to the rest of the Albret lands. In fact, he would probably see it another way : linking Bearn to Navarre's fate would be the only solution to uphold the protestant ascendancy in the country, so it would be a favor made to the Bearnais, not to Rohan.\n\nThe Rohan's position in the Brittany order of succession is much less secured : they descend from Marie of Brittany, daughter of duke Francis I († 1511), but both she and her sister were excluded from the succession by the semi-salic law applicable in Brittany since 1365. The many descendants of their cousin Anne came first. Anyways, the Valois kings had held the point view of a merger of Brittany into the Crown's lands, regardless of the various treaties made earlier, so no reason for the Rohans to make much more than claiming.\n\nThat's quite severe for the Rohans, at that time, dowager viscountess Catherine (1554-1631), viscount Henri II (1579-1638), Benjamin de Soubise (1583-1642), Henriette (1577-1624), Catherine (1580-1607) and Anne (1584-1646).

True, said son died and his sister was later married to César, Duc de Vendôme, but the fact that one noble did it (and seemingly even got the Breton Estates or somesuch to agree to naming his son this), means that if the Rohans were to take a mind to it, they could just as easily claim it, couldn't they?"
