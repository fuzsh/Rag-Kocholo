        "text": "Marie de Médicis (Italian: Maria de' Medici, 1573-1642), was queen consort of King Henry IV of France (reigned 15891610) and, from 1610 to 1614, regent for her son, King Louis XIII (reigned 161043).\n\nMarie was the daughter of Francesco de' Medici, grand duke of Tuscany, and Joanna of Austria. Shortly after Henry IV divorced his wife, Margaret, he married Marie (October 1600) in order to obtain a large dowry that would help him pay his debts. In 1601 Marie gave birth to the dauphin Louis (the future Louis XIII), and during the following eight years she bore the king five more children. Upon the assassination of Henry IV (May 14, 1610) the Parlement of Paris proclaimed Marie regent for young King Louis XIII."
