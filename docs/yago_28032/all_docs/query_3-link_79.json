        "text": "The French Wars of Religion\n\nCatherine de' Medici was influential in the French Wars of Religion (1562-1598). Catherine was the main mastermind and signatory for the periods of peace during this 30-year war. Let's look at the significant royal decrees that Catherine signed in this period in her attempts to bring peace to a religiously torn France.\n\n1562 Edict of Saint Germain allowed Huguenots to preach freely in France, a landmark decree to end protestant persecution.\n\n1563 Edict of Amboise ended the First War of Religion by granting theHuguenots legal rights and a limited right to preach in fixed locations.\n\n1568 Peace of Longjumeau was signed by Charles IX and Catherine de' Medici. The edict ended the second French War of Religion with terms that mostly confirmed those of the earlier edict of Amboise.\n\n1570 Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye ended the Third War of Religion. It gave theHuguenots the same rights they had held at the beginning of the war, allocating them 'security towns'.\n\nCatherine's work to foster peace was achieved, but only after her death. She died in 1589, and after her son, King Henry III, was assassinated later that year, the French throne was passed to Henry of Bourbon, King of Navarre. He was crowned King Henry IV in 1594 and, sharing Catherine's desire for religious peace, issued the Edict of Nantes in 1598, which protected Huguenot rights and promoted civil unity.\n\nSt. Bartholomew's Day Massacre\n\nDespite Catherine de' Medici's attempts to create peace in France, the French Wars of Religion continued to rage between the Huguenots and Catholics. 24 August 1572 saw the start of a targeted group of assassinations and violent Catholic mobs aimed against the Huguenots during the civil war. These attacks began in Paris and spread throughout France. King Charles IX, under the regency of Catherine de' Medici, ordered the killing of a group of Huguenot leaders, including Coligny. Subsequently, a murderous pattern spread across Paris.\n\nEnding in October 1572, the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre caused over 10,000 casualties within two months. The Huguenot political movement was damaged by losing its supporters and most prominent political leaders, marking a turning point in the French Wars of Religion.\n\nHistorian H.G. Koenigsburger states that the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre was:\n\nThe worst of the century's religious massacres.1\n\nCatherine de' Medici receives a vast amount of scrutiny and blame for the many deaths at the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre. Yet, it is impossible to know the actual origin of the assault. Catherine's position as regent during this time likely meant that she was aware of the upcoming conflicts and played a part in their productions. Still, it is often suggested that Catherine was among the few who did not agree to kill thousands of Huguenots. However, she condoned the assassination of Coligny and his lieutenants as a self-preserving political power move.\n\nWhy did Catherine want the assassination of Coligny?\n\nAdmiral Coligny was a known leading Huguenot and an influential counsellor to King Charles IX. After several unknown assassination attempts on Coligny and other Protestant leaders in Paris in 1572, Catherine de' Medici feared a Protestant uprising.\n\nIn response to this, as a Catholic Queen mother, and regent, Catherine approved the plan to execute Coligny and his men to protect the Catholic Crown and King. The violence spread throughout the crowd, and the common people followed suit, killing any Protestant and Protestant sympathizers available.\n\nCatherine de' Medici's Line Discontinued\n\nAfter the death of Charles IX in 1574, Catherine's favourite son Henry III became king, beginning another crisis of succession and religion. Catherine would not act as regent during Henry III's reign as he was old enough to rule on his own. However, Catherine still influenced his reign by overseeing the kingdom's affairs on behalf of Henry, acting as his political advisor.\n\nHenry III's failure to produce an heir to the throne led the French Wars of Religion to develop into the War of the Three Henrys (1587). With Catherine's death in 1589 and her son Henry III's assassination only a few months later, Catherine's line was ended. Upon his death bed, Henry III recommended the ascension of his cousin, Henry IV of Navarre. In 1598, Henry IV ended the French Wars of Religion by passing the Edict of Nantes.\n\nWar of the Three Henrys\n\nThe eighth conflict in the series of civil wars in France. During 1587–1589, King Henry III, Henry I, Duke of Guise, and Henry of Bourbon, King of Navarre, fought for the French crown.\n\nEdict of Nantes\n\nThis edict granted the Huguenots tolerance in France.\n\nFrench Monarchy\n\nCatherine is known for opposing the sexist constraints posed against women of power. After the death of her husband, Catherine defended her authority as Queen regent and Queen mother rigorously. Catherine Crawford comments on her political initiative, stating:\n\nCatherine de Medici moved into a position of political prominence largely on her own initiative by presenting herself as a devoted wife, widow, and mother as the basis of her political entitlement.2\n\nCatherine de' Medici held power for most of her life through her roles as Queen consort, Queen regent, and Queen mother. She played an essential part while waiting for her children to come of age and assume power. Holding her position proved difficult, as extremists supported by Spain and the Papacy wanted to dominate the crown and diminish its independence in the interests of European Catholicism.\n\nThe Reformation weakened the Roman Catholic Church as Protestantism was gaining popularity throughout France. With Spain leading the fight against Protestantism through their strict and disciplined religious practices, they became particularly interested in obliterating Protestantism in neighbouring France.\n\nExtremist\n\nA person with extreme religious or political views, known for violent or illegal actions.\n\nPapacy\n\nThe office or authority of the Pope."
