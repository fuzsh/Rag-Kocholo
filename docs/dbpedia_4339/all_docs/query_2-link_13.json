These paternal and maternal haplogroups shed light on your genetic ancestry and help tell the story of your family.\n\nThe top paternal haplogroup of people with the surname Mendoza is Q-M3, which is predominantly found among people with East Asian & Indigenous American ancestry. Haplogroup Q-M3 is descended from haplogroup Q-M242. Other common haplogroups include R-P311 and I-SK1254, which are predominantly found among people with European and European ancestry. Other surnames with similar common haplogroups are: Reyes, Cruz, Lopez, Flores, Jimenez, Garcia, Martinez, Castillo, Perez, Gonzales.\n\nThe most common maternal haplogroups of people with Mendoza surname are: A2, B2, D1. These most commonly trace back to individuals of European ancestry.\n\nYour paternal lineage may be linked to The Ancient One\n\nWhen two college students stumbled upon a human skull on the banks of the Columbia River, neither the students nor the police who responded to their 911 call could have imagined the archaeological significance of this rare discovery. The skull &mdash; along with about 300 other bone fragments found near Kennewick, Washington &mdash; belonged to a 9,000 year-old nomad who Native Americans have dubbed \"The Ancient One.\" Based on skeletal clues, The Ancient One (also known as \"Kennewick Man\") likely swam, wielded a spear, and hunted coastal fauna for the greater part of his lifeInitial craniometric studies suggested he descended from ancient Japanese and Polynesian-like people and had little in common with living Native Americans. This claim &mdash; refuted by the Plateau tribes of the Pacific Northwest &mdash; became the center of a decades-long legal battle over the provenance of the remains. When The Ancient One's genome was finally sequenced in 2015, the evidence revealed he was genetically most similar to modern-day Native Americans. In fact, local tribes were found to be direct descendants of a population closely related to The Ancient One; in 2017, he finally received a proper Native American burial. This critical discovery helps illustrate a genetic continuity between ancient and modern-day Native Americans. Furthermore, his paternal line belonged to haplogroup Q-M3, the predominant lineage among Native Americans today.\n\nYour maternal lineage may be linked to some of the first Americans\n\nThough the Ice Age was beginning to retreat when your A2 ancestors first entered North America, there were still massive barriers blocking their way. Glaciers and inhospitable climate covered much of the continent, blocking entry into the interior. Nonetheless, researchers have found evidence that a wave of American founders migrated over 13,000 kilometers to reach southern Chile in only 2,000 years, a blink of an eye in the story of human migration! Their highway to the south was the coast of the Pacific, stocked with fish, diverse marine mammals, and other valuable resources in the rich kelp forests of the upper latitudes and in the abundant fresh-water rivers near the equator. Because of this rapid movement south, the A2 haplogroup and its diverse branches are found throughout North and South America."
