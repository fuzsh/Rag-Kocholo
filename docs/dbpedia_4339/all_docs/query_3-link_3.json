        "text": "Antonio María Bucareli y Ursúa (born January 24, 1717, Sevilla, Spain—died April 9, 1779, Mexico City, Mexico) was a Spanish soldier and statesman, noted for his excellent administration as the prudent and humane colonial viceroy of New Spain (Mexico) from 1771 to 1779. Under his rule, Mexico enjoyed greater prosperity and security than most of Spanish America.\n\nBucareli began his military career as a soldier for Spain in Italy, where he attained the rank of lieutenant general. In 1760 he was made viceroy of Cuba, a post he held until he was appointed viceroy of New Spain (1771).\n\nBucareli’s military accomplishments in Mexico included the quelling of Indian revolts in the north, the elimination of bands of criminals that had roamed freely throughout the country, and the construction of forts at Acapulco, Perote, and Acordada. He also fostered the drainage of the valley of Mexico, reformed the system of taxation, and promoted improvements in minting currency and in establishing fixed weights for coins. He encouraged the settlement of California and assisted in the founding of the port of San Francisco."
