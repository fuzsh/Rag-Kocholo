        "text": "The earliest book known to have been printed in the New World was in Nahuatl. Nahuatl is the name of the Aztec language, spoken throughout central Mexico before the Spanish conquest; and this first book known to have been printed was the Breve y mas compendiosa doctrina cristiana en lengua mexicana y castellana published in 1539. There are other books which have a claim to having been the first book printed in the Americas, since much of the history of early printing in Mexico remains unclear. Nevertheless, the amount of evidence in favor of the Doctrina cristiana makes its publication, if not its primacy, a certainty, although no copies exist today.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the establishment of a printing press in Mexico centered around the need for materials to aid in the \"spiritual conquest\" of the area, the conversion of the conquered Aztec empire to Christianity. Thus it should come as no surprise that one of the first, if not the first, book printed in Mexico would be in Nahuatl. Throughout the next three centuries, the Nahuatl language continued to occupy a position of importance in the output of Mexican presses. Yet even through three centuries publications in Nahuatl did not lose their didactic nature, serving in the Christian education of the Indians.\n\nThe Mendel Collection of the Lilly Library at Indiana University reflects the significance of Nahuatl in the history of Mexican printing. While the collection does not contain all works printed in Nahuatl between 1539 and 1840 it does faithfully represent the output of that period. Of the less than 150 Nahuatl works extant from the period, the Mendel Collection contains 56.\n\nIn formulating this catalogue certain guidelines were followed. For several reasons the year 1840 serves as a suitable upper limit for its chronological scope. First, it makes the range of the study an even three centuries, 1539-1840. Secondly, since the Mendel Collection, and the Lilly Library in general, hold rare books, books printed after 1840 would likely appear in the General Collection of the Indiana University Library. Lastly, works printed in the Nahuatl after 1840 exhibit a different type of emphasis. By the middle of the nineteenth century works in and dealing with Nahuatl became more analytical and less creative. Production shifted from that of religious works, grammars, and dictionaries for clerics to linguistic studies and secular works for the educated and scientifically-oriented public.\n\nAt present much of the Mendel Collection has not been permanently catalogued. Thus in order to formulate this study many titles had to be located from other sources and then checked against the Collection's temporary catalogue. In this endeavor the most important aids were José Toribio Medina's La imprenta en México, 8 vols. (Santiago de Chile, 1907-1912) and his La imprenta en la Puebla de los Angeles (Santiago de Chile, 1923). These sources were consulted to locate works in Nahuatl or \"lengua mexicana\" as it was known in the colonial period. In general, if the title appeared in Spanish and no mention of Nahuatl appeared in the title or description it was assumed that the work contained no Nahuatl. In order to cross-check titles from Medina, and to locate possible titles not in Medina, the Ugarte Catálogo, García Icazbalceta's Apuntes, the Pilling Proofsheets, and Viñaza's Bibliografía were consulted. Works containing only a few words in Nahuatl did not qualify for inclusion in this catalogue. Yet any work with a substantial portion, although not completely, in Nahuatl was included.\n\nThis listing will be arranged chronologically according to the earliest edition held by the Lilly. Mention will be made of later editions held by the Lilly under the first reference to that work. The Medina catalogue number will be given for works listed in that bibliographic source. Following the citation of the title and publication data any interesting information concerning the book, its author, or the Lilly edition will appear.\n\nOne should not assume that these books are the extent of the Lilly's holdings in Nahuatl or of materials pertaining to the study of that nation. In addition to the works listed here, the Mendel Collection holds several newer editions of older Nahuatl texts, some first editions, and facsimiles. Among the more important historical works dealing with the history of the Aztecs both before and after the Conquest, the Lilly holds copies of the first printed editions of two major sixteenth-century works: Diego Durán, Historia de las indias de Nueva España, 2 vols. Mexico: 1867-1880; and Bernardino de Sahagún, Historia general de las cosas de Nueva España, 3 vols. Mexico: 1829-1830. The Lilly Library also has a copy with colored plates of the mammoth nine volume Antiquities of Mexico edited by Lord Edward King Kingsborough. London: 1831-1848.\n\nFrom the earliest days of printing in Mexico Nahuatl played an important rule. As noted earlier, the first book known to have been published in the New World was in Nahuatl. As printing evolved in Mexico, Nahuatl continued to be the most important Indian language. While the proportion of Nahuatl imprints within the entire production of Mexico decreased, the absolute number remained constant through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and then increased through the eighteenth century.\n\nThe group of Nahuatl imprints held by the Lilly Library in the Mendel Collection is of particular historical significance. It represents the major works written in the language and the gamut of possible genres. While the Lilly's holdings are by no means complete, they do faithfully reflect the production of works in Nahuatl from 1539 to 1840.\n\nBibliography\n\nBeristain, de Sousa, José Mariano.
