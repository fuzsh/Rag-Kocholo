This Jewish faction obviously does not know the true disposition that Opus Dei has towards anything related to Jews - practicing or not.\n\nThe Editors in .html format\n\nAccess to the Main Index\n\nPrologue\n\nOriginal Book\n\nPrinted at Orion Editores\n\nSantafé de Bogotá, D.C.

Appearances can be deceiving. Things are not what they seem. Ambiguity and confusion are the symptom of the present day.\n\nLeo XIII, referring to Freemasonry, said in the encyclical \"Humanum Genus\" that to unmask it was to overcome it. This is a search for the light in the real meaning of Opus Dei, diving into its roots, interrelating its most characteristic thoughts and penetrating into the phreatic and subterranean waters that irrigate the structure of this organism that is embedded in the marrow of the Catholic Church. This search is the heart of an exciting book that reveals to us the background, the interlacing, the rebound of the organization that today enjoys a Prelature in the Holy See and that is on the verge of elevating to holiness its controversial and caricatured founder.\n\nHistory is generally told sometimes by its superficial aspect and other times by the anecdotal aspect of any event. Events are described as if they occurred spontaneously, without cause or origin, which leads to a merely epidermal view of pure reality. In order to know the phenomena in depth and to give them a meaning and an explanation, it is necessary to separate the leaf litter, whose mulch can cover the light, to make visible the other side of the mirror, the opaque, invisible part that is undoubtedly the one that moves the threads of the puppet theatre.\n\nWhen one begins the descent to the most remote and unexplored chasms, where darkness blinds perception, one may find the surprise of what one could call the implausibility. The Opus unmasked is the story of a plot where reality and fiction seem to merge and come together as if they were a perfect alloy. In such circumstances, two paths are possible. Either silence and hide the conclusions in the deepest and most telluric depths, or expose them, reveal them and divulge them for general knowledge. Faced with this dichotomy, the author has opted for the second in order to clear up the great unknown of the convoluted equation that Opus Dei poses.\n\nIt is not a scandalous or provocative book. It is controversial. One can agree or disagree with its content. Indifference, neutrality and equidistance are not possible.\n\nThe book does not exhaust and does not reach the ultimate goal, although it does reach the highest level. It begins the journey, it opens a new field of research, hitherto unseen. Throughout his history, man has come on the face of the earth uniting and segregating, merging or dissolving elements, ideas, thought. The author has set up a column - which could be the fifth - the Opus Dei, with another pillar, the Judaism, as a foundation and a colophon.\n\nThe reading of this book is obligatory if one does not want to sin incautiously, since ignorance will never exempt us from the harmful and irreparable consequences. It is not a cry of alarm, but a conscious voice of warning for men who seek the truth in order to be fully free.\n\nNext Section\n\nComplete Index\n\nOPUS JUDEI\n\nINDEX - CHAPTER I\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nSECTS AND OPUS DEI\n\n1.

The Suspicion is Confirmed\n\nNone of them consider themselves as such (1). Nevertheless, we are in a position to make a clear and categorical statement regarding Opus Dei. It is one of the most powerful and mysterious sects in the history of the 20th century. (2) Raimundo Panikkar himself, one of the pioneers in the development of the initial nucleus, a member of the founders, who attended the prologue of Opus Dei, says that “what began as a small group, more or less charismatic, which slowly, as a result of circumstances on the one hand and what was latent in the spirit of the founder, became what is sociologically called a sect.” (3)\n\nWe live immersed in a process of social crisis that has created a market of credulities. Cults proliferate, expand, penetrate, install themselves, affect and culminate their unavowable purposes infiltrating like smoke the social tissues, destroying and annihilating many for the lucrative benefit of a few.\n\nThe news was front-page news. The headlines offered no space for hesitation. The body that disseminated the information was a nationwide media. The headlines of the newspaper read: “Members of Opus Dei treated with deprogramming techniques in Barcelona clinic” (4). The content of this surprising news confirmed that an undetermined number of young aspirants and active members of Opus Dei had been treated in Barcelona in recent months with mental deprogramming techniques. The clinical treatments were applied at the request of their relatives who were trying to correct, in this way, emotional disorders.\n\nThe news added that the assistance techniques offered by Asociación Pro Juventud (\"Association for Youth\") and the technical team of the Center for Recovery, Orientation and Assistance to the Sectarian (CROAS) are known generically as deprogramming and consist basically of a process of information and criticism of the beliefs and behavior of the organization to which the affected person belongs.\n\nThe first clinical treatments with deprogramming techniques for members and followers of Opus Dei were carried out in November 1987.\n\nAbout 20 families of Opus Dei members, from various parts of Spain, had approached Asociación Pro Juventud asking for information and collaboration to “recover their children” or to treat them clinically.\n\nThose in charge of Asociación Pro Juventud - the news concluded - believe that the dogmatic attitudes of some of the members and followers of Opus Dei are similar to those held by members of harmful sects. The secrecy and proselytism or apostolate of Opus Dei are, in the opinion of the members of Asociación Pro Juventud, some of the most negative and criticized characteristics of the Prelature.\n\nThe note ended by indicating that “in the first international congress on the harmful effects of sects, held last November in Sant Cugat del Vallés (Barcelona), some allegedly harmful and negative aspects of Opus Dei were discussed and debated.” (5)\n\nThe feeling that we are dealing with a pernicious sect is gaining ground in Spanish public opinion. In a survey carried out among a large number of young people, the statistical results of which were made known by the first channel of Spanish Television on July 23, 1990, during the broadcast of the second edition of the Daily News (\"Telediario\"), the majority of those interviewed cited three well-known sects in Spain, most of them saying that Opus Dei was a “destructive sect”. (6) Two years before this event, the writer Vázquez Montalbán, in an article entitled \"El Opus que no cesa\", also said “that an informative television program in which some of the internal contradictions of Opus Dei were expressed, for example the need for some of its members to \"deprogram\" as if they were members of sects not homologated by established Christianity, was enough to cause the corral of the Catholic hierarchy to be disturbed once again”. (7)\n\nNow we can explain better that recommendation which, as early as 1983 and with the statement “Beware of Opus Dei”, referred to the initiative and caution taken by some American high schools that organized trips for their students to Spanish universities and that, before leaving for Spain, gave them some rules and instructions about what they should eat or the products they should abstain from, the places of tourist or cultural interest they should visit, the environments they should avoid at the risk of being robbed or attacked. And among the recommendations they gave to the young people who came to Spain to follow the courses for foreigners, they warned them also to be careful with an organization called Opus Dei. (8) The news deserved a place in the press and was a symptom of the possible intoxication of the sect, which tries to recruit its followers mainly among the university community.\n\nYvon le Vaillant, in his book document entitled \"La Santa Mafia\", published in Mexico in 1985, tells us that in Italy a famous doctor, known in the international psychoanalytical media, when she learned that the son of one of her patients had been admitted to Opus Dei, revealed to her that she had several patients who had managed to leave Opus Dei and that these were neurotic, adding that “this is a crime. They are under a spell.” (9)\n\nThe picture that said book describes about these people is that “when you look at them from the front, you are surprised to realize that they are not really them, that they are not themselves, that they seem to live next to them, as if deprived of their own personality. It is that they are empty of body and soul, tied hand and foot to an absorbing organization: 'The Work'”. (10) It is the archetypal picture presented by people who are caught in the nets of such a sectarian spider's web. The magazine Spielgel speaks of a \"mousetrap\".\n\nIn a wide-ranging report published under the title \"El Opus Dei, el verdadero poder en España\" (\"Opus Dei, the real power in Spain\"), in the magazine Tiempo, perhaps the one with the largest circulation today, which is not at all sensationalist and covers a large area of general information, it was stated that “more and more parents are not resigned to the legal impotence to get their children out of what they consider to be brainwashing. In Valencia” - the report continued - “there is a psychiatrist who has specialized in deprogramming young people who have been captured by Opus Dei.” (11) It is precisely proselytism, the daily activity for most of the numerary members of Opus Dei, that is their first commandment, according to John Roche, professor of History of Science at the University of Oxford and a member of the Work for 14 years, “Today they are beginning to capture children between the ages of 8 and 9... a file is being prepared in which little by little data is being collected: age, studies, hobbies, social environment, family, attitude towards religion and towards Opus Dei, contacts with people in the Work...”. (12)\n\nAmong the conclusions of the report was that the power of Opus Dei in Spain is so hidden that 38% of Spaniards are convinced that the Institute, founded by Monsignor Escrivá de Balaguer, is “a sect, a pressure group, an economic mafia or a political group”. (13) The director of the weekly magazine, José Oneto, himself wrote in an editorial in connection with the report that was published, that “Opus Dei today continues to be immersed in mystery in our country, and we wanted to clear up some of that mystery, some of that hidden power. The survey, carried out by OTR and Emopublica with 1200 interviews from all over Spain, is significant in itself: quite a few Spaniards think that Opus Dei is an \"economic mafia\" or a \"pressure group\". Moreover, many Spaniards (35%) are convinced that the fundamental aims of \"the Work\" are to influence politics as a pressure group or to achieve certain economic ends.” (14) With difficulties, with much effort and work, with arduous investigations, light was being seen at the end of the dark and gloomy tunnel.\n\nThis book, prepared after several years of exhaustive dedication to the collection and comparison of irrefutable data and contrasting sources, may be the trigger for the implementation of the \"providential death\" for those who write it, so the warning goes ahead with a dart taken from the very bowels of The Way, the maximum 340 that reads: “Do not be afraid of the truth, even if the truth brings you death”.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

What is a Sect?\n\nJulián García Hernando, in an article published in the journal of the Institute of Applied Sociology, points to two aspects when searching for the etymological root of the word \"sect\" which can be derived from the Latin \"sequi\" - which means \"following\". In this sense, sect would be the movement of those who follow a religious leader and who accept his message. Or it could have its radical entrenchment in the term \"secare\" or \"secedere\" - to cut, to separate. In this case it would mean a group that has separated itself from a church or another sect, with a manifest tendency to close in on itself. (15)\n\nFrom a sociological point of view and in a broad concept of sect one could call it a conventional group of people who participate in the same religious experiences. (16) A sect, in a global sense, is nothing more than a group of people united by the fact of following a certain doctrine and/or leader. (17) In any context, a sect is a group of people united by a particular doctrine, the word sect being incomplete, that is why they are called \"destructive cults or sects\", \"young sects\" or \"totalitarian pseudo-religious movements\" (18).\n\nA sect would be the “voluntary grouping of converts, limited only to adults, to the exclusion of sinners, that is, reserved only for those who commit themselves to the law of God after having had a conversion experience” if we stick to the definition given by Benoit-Lavaud. In it, therefore, the faithful adhere to the revelations made to a founder. The sect differs from the Church (in the non-theological sense) in that it recognizes another new revelation, different from that witnessed in Sacred Scripture and which it claims to be necessary to understand. Furthermore, the sect limits salvation to its own members.\n\nAccording to Father Cavalier, the elements that characterize modern sects are the following:\n\nA factor of security and certainty. The members of the sect are aware that they belong to a group that holds the truth and salvation.\n\nAffective factor: The group considers itself self-sufficient. It has no contacts with other groups except to convert them and integrate them into its own group. There is no room for ecumenical dialogue, only for proselytism. Charity can only be exercised within the group, which is very lively and very hot, becoming a real \"ghetto\".\n\nA factor of doctrinal, disciplinary and moral rigorism. Total primacy is given to principles, to doctrine and its interpretation over the rights of individuals. What prevails is the \"sect\" that identifies itself with the will of God. (19)\n\nThe plenary session of the Congress of Deputies, which decided to investigate the groups considered as sects in Spain, recorded an approximation to the characteristics allowing for the definition of the negative or \"antisocial\" nature of these groups. According to the socialist deputy Carlos Navarrete, the following characteristics could be considered: (20)\n\n- Doctrinal, religious or socio-religious, demagogic cohesion as a framework for these organizations.\n\n- The presence of a charismatic leader who is considered an incarnation of the divinity or a nuncio of it.\n\n- The existence of a theocratic, vertical and totalitarian structure.\n\n- The establishment of a limit to reason by virtue of the apriorism of certain beliefs.\n\n- To be constituted in closed communities or with a great dependence on the group.\n\n- The suppression of individual and intimate freedoms, of communications, etc.\n\n- The recourse to certain neurophysiological manifestations of meditation, spiritual rebirth, \"accesit\", etc.\n\n- The total rejection of societies and secular institutions.\n\n- The proselytism and the collection of money and the economic dispossession of its members.\n\nTo the previous characteristics the journalist specialized in the subject of the sects, Pepe Rodríguez, in his recently published book on the matter with the title \"El poder de las sectas\", corrects and increases those that he had already pointed out in his previous works \"Las sectas hoy y aquí\" and \"Esclavos de un Mesías\". He adds, among others:\n\n- Demanding total adherence to the group and forcing (under psychological pressure) the breaking of all social ties prior to entering the cult: parents, partner, friends, work, studies, etc.\n\n- Controlling the information that reaches their followers, manipulating it at their convenience.\n\n- Use sophisticated psychological or neurophysiological techniques (masked under \"meditation\") that serve to annul the will and reasoning of the followers, causing them, in many cases, serious psychic alterations.\n\n- Advocating a total rejection of society and its institutions. Outside the group everyone is an enemy (polarization between good/sect and evil/society). Society is rubbish and the people who live in it are only interested to the extent that they can serve the group.\n\n- To have as primary activities the proselytism - to obtain new adepts - by hidden and illegitimate ways and the collection of money - surveys by the streets, courses, clearly criminal activities. In the case of multinational sects, the money collected is largely sent to the headquarters of each group.\n\n- Obtaining, under psychological coercion, the handing over of the personal assets of new followers to the sect, or large sums of money in the form of courses or audits. Members who work outside the group have to give all or a large part of their salary to the sect. And those who work in companies belonging to the group do not receive salaries (the salaries of these companies of the sect are only a legal cover as they are never paid out - or they return the money later for their members/labor). (21)\n\nThere are two aspects that Pepe Rodríguez insists on and places special emphasis on when referring to the characteristics of sects. On the one hand, the isolation from the outside world, in order to better depersonalize the neophyte, manipulating the environment, cutting emotional ties, carefully controlling social activities and relations, cancelling and suppressing information from outside the sect itself by means of strict guidelines, advice and censorship in terms of information and communication, creating a stereotyped and conventional language typical of the sect, giving the words a different meaning from the vulgar or \"profane\" usage, creating some peculiar signs of identity, imbuing in the follower a feeling of hostility and rejection towards the foreign and suppressing the properties and means of survival of the initiated, under the pretext of their own \"spiritual evolution\", which makes them have a submissive and vexatious dependence on the sect.\n\nThe second aspect that Pepe Rodriguez emphasizes is that which refers to the suppression and annulment of personality, the destruction of individuality by means of studied methods and techniques that, when applied to perfection, will create on the adept the paradox that “man - taken as an isolated individual - believes himself to be a fragile and weak entity. For this reason, he seeks shelter within the group and a mass. There he feels strong and powerful when, in reality - and this is the cruel paradox - he has moved to a stage where he is totally vulnerable and manipulable. While the isolated individual acts under rational guidelines, the mass acts under emotional and irrational imperatives.” (22) It is a path of no return because “when one enters the sectarian community one never again has intimacy”. (23)\n\nWhen the question “Why aren't you in Opus Dei” was put to the Madrid politician and lawyer Manuel Cantanero del Castillo, his answer was brief and concise, but enlightening “Because I am not willing to be sectarianised” (24), in other words, not to be sold.\n\nSome years ago, in February 1984, journalist Luis Reyes wrote a piece of information in the weekly \"Tiempo\" that, despite its seriousness, went unnoticed. He wrote: “Opus Dei in Germany is included among the pernicious sects, also known there by the police as 'El Camino'.”\n\nAs an eloquent testimony, we will reproduce the open letter that a father wrote to his son, a member of Opus Dei, as a cry that comes from his innermost being and it is as heartbreaking as ever: “Son Peter: I would like you one day to come to the light of truth, to discover the underworld of the 'sect' in which you are now trapped, like an impotent fly entangled in the fine meshes of a spider's web. That gigantic spider is the Marquis of Peralta, the mesh of his Work, the cavernous hole where he takes his prey to devour them, is the Church of the Antichrist. You will give me immense joy the day you manage to escape from the dense nets in which you are now powerfully trapped. Meanwhile, I continue to pray for you. A hug from your suffering and waiting father...” (25) These are the tears of a parent who fights against a destructive sect which, as such, brings about the destruction (destructuring) of the previous personality of the follower and severely damages him, destroying his emotional ties.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n15.

The Hidden Secret and The Revealed Mystery\n\nThe 1990 Nobel Prize winner for literature, Camilo José Cela, declared that “I am not in Opus Dei because I don't like secret societies”. (26) Secrecy within Opus Dei is like an obsession, like a nightmare, like a syndrome. Its followers practice hermeticism. As Santiago Aroca wrote: “Another of the Work's myths is secrecy. Opus Dei officially denies being a hidden organization”. However, Article 193 sanctions: “These Constitutions, the published instructions and those that may be published in the future, as well as the other documents, MUST NOT BE DISCLOSED”; furthermore, without the permission of the \"Father\", “those documents that were written in Latin must not even be translated into the vulgar languages”. Incidentally, article 232 states: “We will not communicate the business and reasons for our vocation to strangers; if done, it will be very cautiously and very rarely”. To finish off, Article 191 proclaims the value of discretion and indicates that members of the Work “must keep prudent silence regarding the names of other members and that they will not reveal to anyone the fact that they belong to Opus Dei”. (27)\n\nOne of the people who knows best the inner workings of Opus Dei is Alberto Moncada, having belonged to the group for many years, where he carried out important functions and tasks. He has written several books in which he states that a “mania is secrecy and whispering, simply unacceptable in a modern society”, (28) defining Opus Dei as “an intricate skein” and making his own the words of R. S. when he stated that “for the Work to be understood, Opus Dei must be done away with”. (29) In Opus Dei, according to the conditions that the leaders usually set for those who leave, they are not to communicate to anyone their experiences in \"the Work\", (30) but “all hidden power, all simulation, is repugnant to the profound demands of Christian sincerity”. (31)\n\nFor Yvon le Vaillant the most surprising aspect - and one most frequently pointed out by observers - is the \"secret\" character of Opus Dei, its nature and its behavior as a \"secret society\". There are precise instructions to this effect. The Jesuit priest Jean Beyer points out that “the secret concerns the members, the houses and the vows of the Institute”. (32)\n\nThere are many maxims in the bedside book of the members of Opus Dei - Camino - that insist on and reiterate this suffocating need in the Work. There are whole chapters devoted to such topics as \"discretion\" or \"tactics\" where the slogans of secrecy follow one another more or less explicitly. Thus we can read:\n\n“970: It is true that I have called your discreet apostolate a 'silent and effective mission.' And I won't go back on what I said.”\n\n“639: Remain silent, and you will never regret it: speak, and you often will.”\n\n“654: Bitterness has sharpened your tongue. Be quiet!”\n\n“835: You long to shine like a star, to shed your light from high in the heavens? Better to burn like a hidden torch, setting your fire to all that you touch. That's your apostolate: that's why you are on earth.”\n\n“840: May your dedication pass unnoticed as, for thirty years, did that of Jesus.”\n\nThe Constitutions of Opus Dei, drawn up in 1947, also insist, with a heavy heart, on the aspect of secrecy. Among its articles, we highlight the following:\n\nArticle 6: “Opus Dei professes collective humility, and thus it is not permitted to edit newspapers or other publications of this type under the name of the Work, except internally for use by the members; its members never wear a distinctive sign; they speak with caution with outsiders...”\n\nArticle 189: “In order for the Institute to reach its proper end more effectively, it wishes to live as hidden, ...”\n\nArticle 190. “... even membership in the Institute admits no external manifestations. The number of members is kept hidden from outsiders; and indeed our people do not discuss these things with outsiders.”\n\nArticle 191: “... The lack of this discretion can constitute a grave obstacle to exercising apostolic work or create some difficulty in the environment of one’s natural family or in the exercise of their office or profession. Thus the Numerary and Supernumerary members should know they are to live a prudent silence regarding the names of other members; and that they are never to reveal to anyone that they themselves belong to Opus Dei, not even to spread the Institute, without express permission from their local director. This discretion especially binds those who are newly accepted in the Institute and also to those who, for whatever reason, have left the Institute. [...]”\n\nArticle 193: “These Constitutions, published instructions and those which in the future may be published, and the other things pertaining to the government of the Institute are never to be made public. Indeed, without the permission of the Father, those documents which are written in the Latin language may not be translated into vernacular languages.”\n\nArticle 232: “The business and essence of our vocation are not discussed with outsiders, except with extreme caution, and only rarely. [...]”\n\nIt often happens that two members of a house, from the same residence of the Work, pretend not to know each other when they meet in public; that members of the same family do not know that one of them belongs to Opus Dei; that people discover to their surprise that a friend, a co-worker they have known for years, has carefully hidden his membership from them. It is not unusual for the affair to happen even to bishops themselves, who have been surprised to learn that such and such a priest belonged to Opus Dei. (33)\n\nWith regard to the proverbial discretion and secrecy surrounding Opus Dei, another Jesuit, Father Heyen says: “Let us here point out the apostolic deviation that secular institutes must avoid, especially those that must observe a certain secrecy. This is the danger, under the pretext of apostolate, of imitating the communists and of \"infiltrating\" the milieu or taking over the levers of command and important posts. In such a course of action, one will see, and rightly so, a flagrant disloyalty to other Christians. Above all, it will be seen as a serious alteration in the nature of the specific apostolate of these Institutes: such infiltration would not mean using the light and love of Our Lord Jesus Christ; the means of secrecy would mean corruption.” (34) And scandals have been a constant in the Work. However, in secret.\n\nLieutenant General Fernando Rodrigo Cifuentes made the following statements when referring to Opus Dei: “As a military man, I consider the high commitments that the military man has contracted with the nation to be totally in conflict with any other commitments that are undoubtedly contracted by accepting the regulations of a secret association, since its work of recruitment and action is secret.” (35) Colonel Antonio Sánchez Cámara said: “Many, many members of Opus Dei, if asked directly, deny their membership. Opus Dei is something closed, and I like open spaces.” (36)\n\nThe writer Evaristo Acevedo, in a relaxed tone, commented that Opus Dei surrounds its activities with great secrecy and caution, almost with the qualification of official secret, “to the point that I don't know - he said - whether my wife, brothers, uncles, cousins and dear friends belong to the Work. The mystery and 'suspense' surrounding the Opusians and the activities they carry out prevent me from judging exactly whether their purposes, tasks carried out and to be carried out, are beneficial or not for the community”. (37) It should not be forgotten that with the sectarian spirit of Opus Dei, who are of them and who are not of them is something that is silenced and that only on rare occasions, and at their own convenience, can its members confess their belonging to the Work.\n\nWith the practice of secrecy, Opus Dei has been called by different names that reinforce its condition: \"Holy Mafia\", \"Catholic Freemasonry\"; this latter name being attributed to Henri Fesquet, the most famous religious chronicler of the newspaper Le Monde, who on June 7, 1956, wrote in his column with the headline “With Opus Dei, a return to equivocation, a kind of Catholic Freemasonry”, where he spoke of a somewhat particular type of missionaries who carefully conceal the name of their organization and the real motives for their activity.\n\nOne could argue that their corporate works - that is, those they recognize as their own - exist and are sometimes known. This is the only publicity Opus makes for its activities, but it is significant that they never appear under their real name. None of them belong to Opus Dei. In the corresponding registers the name of this modest association never appears, but rather: trusts, real estate, private persons or any form of commercial or cultural companies, which makes it difficult for the public authorities to act on the corporate works of this secular institute. Therefore, these trusts and real estate companies entrust the spiritual direction of these centers to Opus Dei. (38)\n\nJosé Cepeda Adán, university professor of contemporary Spanish history, made the following logical reflection: “I do not understand, nor will I ever understand, the mystery and the secret that surrounds Opus Dei in its activities. Why? If the path is straight and high, with the light it will gain clarity and it will be freed from the dangers of the selfish and dark earth”. (39) In the same vein, the writer and journalist Antonio D'Olano said that “it is more difficult for people of our time who do not belong to the so-called Work of God to understand it than the theory of relativity... 'Opuslence'... I am terrified of darkness. Everything they bring us is viscous, alarming. In the darkness men do not make contact, even if they are groping, nor can they look each other in the eye. If we are in favor of something confessable, why hide it?” (40)\n\nTheir inclination for secrecy and reserve in the sect has led them to adopt words of passage and touches of recognition, in the image and likeness of Freemasonry. To some it has seemed significant that among the members of this Work, which among us has been described as \"white masonry\", numerous symbols, passwords and signs are used. If, to give an example, one finds oneself at a meeting and a person who has just arrived says when presented \"Pax\", one should not interpret that this person has gone mad. It means that he is from Opus Dei and that he is giving out his \"password\" so that if there is another person in the group who belongs to the Work, he can identify himself by saying: \"In aeternum\". (41) Secret rites. Esoteric.\n\nSurely the adoption of such attitudes comes to them when they see the considerable results that such practices have produced for Freemasonry. Opus Dei copied the technique of secrecy, as a means and system of penetration and control, with the enormous advantage of having the official assistance of priests.\n\nThe Mexican writer Manuel Magaña, in his book \"Revelaciones sobre la Santa Mafia\" (\"Revelations about the Holy Mafia\"), reveals the existence of \"secret meetings\" of the members of Opus Dei more often than one might suppose, with a view to controlling the press, the cinema, the radio, the TV, so that their plans for political-religious infiltration, of international scope, are favoured with a public image that hides their true purposes. (42) Perhaps, in a humorous tone and with an intuition of the existence of such secret meetings, the humorist Manuel Summer, speaking about Opus Dei, said that “when he was a little boy he was taught at home that \"little secrets in meetings are a lack of education\"”, adding “I love freedom and I do not want to be part of any flock”. (43)\n\nA researcher and specialist in topics related to Opus Dei, the journalist Santiago Aroca, went a step further in explaining the existence of these secret meetings by writing that “the cryptic internal language of the members, in their senior members and leaders, are called by numbers and not by their names in the government meetings at the summit”. (44) The world is in need of more light and stenographers, when faced with secret societies of the Opus type, which are clans or cartels subject to the law of silence.\n\nThe consideration of a secret society has been a constant. Daniel Artigues, in his book published in France in 1971 under the title \"El Opus Dei en España\" He pointed out the (\"Opus Dei in Spain\"), already wrote on the first page that it was an almost secret society that aspired, in the first place, to capture the elite, while at the same time pursuing its own ends, not well known and more of political than religious nature.notable reputation that Opus Dei had and its taste for secrecy, concluding that “this desire for discretion, as the members of Opus Dei say, or this cult of secrecy, as its adversaries claim, is one of the essential characteristics of the Work” (45)\n\nHence, do not hesitate to call it a \"pressure group\".\n\nWe will never be able to know exactly which or how many are the official accomplishments of Opus Dei, what are the dark spots or points of penetration under virtuous pretexts. According to Yvon Le Vaillant it is impossible, for example, to know the exact number of residences or student houses. Nor does the name of Opus Dei appear in any telephone book, and God knows that, down here, the telephone is a common, albeit natural, instrument. Opus Dei does not appear in the open, nor does it advertise in its own name, but it retains control of the decision, and so a double conclusion is reached:\n\n1) Opus Dei reserves, without it being apparent, the possibility of selecting its clientele, its members, its interlocutors.\n\n2) It retains the possibility of operating these houses and residences as traps. (46)\n\nIn any case, it is an illusion to seek clarification from those responsible for the Work. Jesus Ynfante, author of the book \"La prodigiosa aventura del Opus Dei\" (\"The Prodigious Adventure of Opus Dei\"), finds in the Work of Escrivá a \"terrible still\" (47) whose membership is conceived in a multiple and complicated way, from broad external circles to intimate, secret groups... operating according to enigmatic methods. Hence, those under 18 years of age are instructed not to say anything to their parents, to keep the secret until the parents have not the legal capacity to remove them from Opus Dei. (48)\n\nSuch is the secret that prevails, that an authority within the Work could write: “I doubt very much that one in a thousand of the members knows the Constitutions of Opus Dei.” (50)\n\nAntonio Pérez (51), one of Escrivá's closest friends and for some time his private secretary, says: “The 'Father' always had a great concern for secrecy. This led him to apply to these issues the same strategy as to internal affairs, that is, only a few people at the top knew about them and negotiated with those directly responsible, keeping the rest of the partners out of the information. This was done mainly through the control of documentation and the greater or lesser accessibility of the notes and notices from Rome. There was even a secret code for correspondence, in which each numeral or combination of numeral with vowels had a meaning.” “The book [the secret code] was kept in a book called \"San Girolano\"” recalls Maria del Carmen Tapia.\n\nOn December 4, 1991, the newspaper \"El Mundo\" published an interview with the theologian Hans Küng, who was in Madrid to present his work \"Project for a Global Ethic\". To the question of whether the Work had as much power in the Church as was said, he answered without hesitation: “A lot, and now the Pope supports the secret society of Opus Dei in a profound way... Opus Dei is worse than a sect: it is a secret and clandestine company.”\n\nREFERENCES\n\n26. Jardiel Poncela, op cit, p 64.\n\n27. Santiago Aroca, \"Tiempo\" Magazine (11 August 1986).\n\n28.

The Charismatic Leader\n\nSectarians are usually the slaves of a messiah, following the terminology of Pepe Rodríguez who even went so far as to give such a title to one of his books on sects. According to this author, in sects there are two doctrinal bodies that are intimately linked, but perfectly distinguishable. One is that of the doctrine of personal myth and the other is that of revealed doctrine. The doctrine of personal myth consists of an overestimation of all the human qualities of the leader, to the point of worshipping him with values and abilities proper to the divinity.\n\nIn the sects - they continue illustrating - hierarchical rank is equated with spiritual maturity, something logical if we see that the base of the pyramid is occupied by the neophytes and the summit is monopolized by the leader. Therefore, a personal matters about the Master will have all the more value and strength the higher the hierarchical rank of the sender. This mechanism originates another fundamental fact: only the leader (apex of the pyramid) has the right to the “written doctrine of the personal myth and to be worshipped through it”.\n\nIn the doctrine of the personal myth, not only is the leader's biography deified, but also a past and intellectual formation are invented in accordance with it. The objective is to place the leader in such a high position (in physical, moral, and spiritual qualities) that no follower can ever dream of reaching it. The consequence of this, once the leader's position is accepted as \"perfect\", is the cessation of all criticism and the total submission of the disciple to the will of the \"perfect master\". (52) In this synoptic summary of the theory of the charismatic leader expounded by the writer Pepe Rodríguez, the stereotyped typology that is repeated in all sects with small variants is countered.\n\nAnother detail by which this theory is even more nuanced is that “the leaders of the sects come out of the social nothing and go on to create and mold a mass that will have no other object than to follow them or obey them blindly. They all pretend to have been 'enlightened' by the 'divinity'.” (53)\n\nIn all the cases, an ostensible megalomania of the charismatic leader can be appreciated, being his authority over the flock omnimous and absolute.\n\nIt is curious to note how “on a symbolic level it has been demonstrated that the components of a group see in this the mother and in the leader the FATHER” (54) and this is precisely the name and the nomenclature that the followers reserve for Escrivá de Balaguer.\n\nThe cult of the Founder has reached an unprecedented extreme within \"the Work of God\". As Alberto Moncada tells us in his \"Historia oral del Opus Dei\" (\"Oral History of Opus Dei\"), the Opus followers recognize themselves as members of a family in which the \"Father\" is the main character. The history of these first fifty years of Opus Dei is nothing more than an extended biography of Monsignor Escrivá, of his psychological evolution, of his relationships with locals and strangers, and of the unconditional obedience of his people.\n\nThis obedience, this devotion to the \"Father\", became a reason for his children to live and a key to their religious experiences, and ends up obscuring any other way of understanding the vocation of Opus Dei. The cult of the \"Father\"'s personality, in which analysts see the greatest difficulty for a modification of the opusdeist path, was engendered in the spirit of that man whose faith in his destiny made him say: “I have known seven popes, hundreds of cardinals, thousands of bishops. But there is only one founder of Opus Dei.” (55)\n\nThe \"Father\" Escrivá always surrounded himself with his most loyal associates and his appearances to the majority of the members took place in a collective atmosphere and, if possible, with young boys and addicted people. (56)\n\nThe paroxysm of the reverential pose, in relation to the founder of the sect, is told by Luis Carandell (57) when he writes that the members of Opus Dei kneel before the founder (Christians generally kneel only before the Blessed Sacrament). Every morning, in the Roman residence, a maiden with a cap enters the presidential chamber while the mosignor [Escrivá] is eating breakfast and, kneeling down, places a silver tray with the correspondence on the table. All of his children kneel down with fennels to kiss his hand. And here is another fact that confirms once again the deep trait of his character. Monsignor \"tolerates\" these manifestations of his sons' veneration of him, but he wishes to institutionalize their custom of kneeling before him so that no shadow of vanity, pride or conceit can be thought of in their acceptance. “A former member who held positions of great responsibility in the Work in his time told me”, Carandell continued, “that in a General Congress of Opus Dei, which he attended shortly before leaving the Institute, the only point that was discussed at length, and on which agreement was reached, was the obligation for members to kneel before the President General, whoever he was. This was done \"so that \"Father\" Escriva's successor would not feel humiliated\" by recalling that the members knelt before the Founder.”\n\nThe \"Father\" Escrivá, the charismatic leader, is within the group situated on an inaccessible pedestal, having mithicized himself in life.\n\nIn order to discover the sectarians, Carandell himself gives us a clue by indicating that (58) the decisive test for knowing whether a person is from Opus Dei is to speak contemptuously of the \"Father\". They jump right in. They claim that he is their \"father\" and that anyone would jump if they spoke badly of their father.\n\nPilar Salarrullana, a former senator and deputy, has written an interesting book on Sects as a living testimony to the messiahs of terror in Spain, where she points out that the leader is an essential characteristic of the sects, since he is “a messianic, charismatic character with great personal charm and a great power of attraction and suggestion, what psychologists call an \"expansive paranoid\", who becomes the owner of bodies and minds and, of course, of the wallet of his followers. He calls himself” - continues Pilar Salarrullana - “\"guru\", \"teacher\", \"prophet\", \"reverend\", \"swami\", \"pastor\", \"president\", \"commander\" or \"FATHER\". In Opus Dei they have adopted this last denomination.”\n\nAccording to Salarrullana, the \"Father\" is the one who knows everything, controls everything and foresees everything. His word, his writings, and his commands cannot be doubted; he can never be disobeyed.\n\nEscrivá himself referred to the members of Opus Dei as his \"sons\" and \"daughters,\" so they had to kneel before him when they were in his presence.\n\nTo such extremes they arrive on the mythical paroxysm of the figure of the leader that, as long as a positive face of the \"Father\" is presented, it didn't matter to lie or to alter the facts - as a numerary clarifies in a broad report published in the women's magazine Marie Claire, an article entitled \"La historia amarga de una numeraria del Opus\" (\"The Bitter Story of an Opus Dei Numerary\"). (59)\n\nAnother characteristic of these characters is that they tend to place the writings of the founder of the sect on the same level of importance as Scripture - the example is found in the little book, \"The Way\", written by the \"Father\" - the Word of God must be interpreted according to the exegetical whims and the teachings of the leader of the sect.\n\nTherefore, membership in the Work is absolute submission, and the \"Father\"'s right encompasses everything. The children of Escrivá are like donkeys on a Ferris wheel: one turn, another turn, more turns, tied to the stick that makes the wheel move. They are tied to the \"Father\"; they cannot and do not know how to do or think anything outside of the magnetic force of the \"Father\". We could say that they live on drugs. (60) Escrivá de Balaguer is a powerful drug for those who allow themselves to be trapped in his powerful spider's web. So high is the degree of intoxication that they suffer and to which they are subjected, that in thought, in word, in deed, it is not Christ who is there, it is the \"Father\".\n\nNothing is more graphic and representative than the image of the donkey on a Ferris wheel, always walking, circling, so as not to go anywhere. \"Father\" Escrivá urges his \"sons\" to be, in the spiritual sense, like the donkeys on the waterwheel. And among the members of the Work, it became fashionable to have a ceramic, straw or wooden figurine in their homes, representing a donkey with a paddle. (61) The presence of the donkey in the reception area of a house or in the anteroom of an office, could be an indication that the expert in opusdeism should take into account to determine whether the tenant belonged to the Work.\n\nCovadonga Carcedo, a former aggregate member from Asturias, publicly denounced Opus Dei, saying: “Opus Dei is a mafia that controls everything. I, who became an apostate thanks to Opus Dei, want to show my fellow citizens the hypocrisy of these people, all of them spiritual daughters of José María Escrivá de Balaguer, a marquis they aspire to take to the altars.” (62)\n\nWhen talking about sects, here and now, the journalist Pepe Rodríguez also asks himself whether it would be interesting to study why there are so many Spanish leaders in certain sects with a manifest or latent homosexuality.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n52.

Community of The Chosen: Followers and Initiates\n\nOne of the best studies that have appeared in Spain on the subject of sects is that of Steven Hassan, which under the title \"Las técnicas de control mental de las sectas y cómo combatirlas\" (\"The techniques of mind control of sects and how to combat them\"), tells us about the “heavenly deception” in which “God forgives the deception of the 'chosen' if this leads to new 'spiritual children'”, and where it is reiterated that they should consider the \"Father\" as the representative of God on Earth.\n\nSectarians are inoculated with the idea that just because they are part of the group or clan, they belong to a different caste of the chosen, a community of the privileged, a nucleus of the called, a circle of the predestined.\n\nSects, with a religious component that is motivational, lead the addict to the need for a personal experience of God and, consequently, they call themselves chosen, and are even inculcated with the idea that they are \"saints\" in relation to others, (63) creating an artificial and empty superiority.\n\nAnother idea that is conveyed to members of sects is the exclusive and excluding character of their own behaviour. This exclusive condition translates into the false idea of being part of the sect, automatically leading to the rejection of those who do not belong to it; henceforth, only the sect is important and \"the rest\" does not count.\n\nThe most obvious mirage is that sects usually present themselves as the \"way of salvation\", appearing to have the most diverse itineraries but all of them coinciding in a common denominator in relation to the world outside the sect itself, which is generally made to coincide with evil.\n\nThis feeling of superiority is achieved by making people believe that all the members of the sect will survive thanks to a particular divine protection (64). This feeling of superiority generates the sensation of being \"chosen\", a factor that not only unites the group, but also changes its morality: the \"sinners\" have not been \"chosen\", therefore it is fair that they be eliminated. There is no pity or forgiveness for the \"sinner\".\n\nAnother phenomenon that occurs when the whole society is made to appear hostile is that not only is the follower isolated, but he or she is presented with the germ of fear that, conveniently manipulated, will be transformed into aggression when the leader orders it. (65)\n\nIn Opus Dei, the feeling that God, the Absolute, comes to you through the Organization is even stronger. This idea that your path to full happiness passes through the Work justifies all the submissions that you impose or are imposed on you. (66) The longing to be happy and not to end, to last forever, the longing that made Miguel de Unamuno tremble when he felt the agony of his Christianity, is capable of achieving all the renunciations, if you are convinced that they are the price of its realization.\n\nIn the opinion of the writer Evaristo Acevedo, “Opus seems to imply that only those Hispanics who belong to its organization \"are with God\". This has a monopoly and exclusive character that does not fit with my religious criteria” (67).\n\nMaría Angustias Moreno, a longtime member of Opus Dei, gives us an enlightening and illustrative testimony in this regard, “What does the Work say about itself? That it is simple, that it is authentic; that its members are equal to other men and women, ordinary people in the midst of the world. However, as soon as they arrive, they insist exhaustively that being of the Work is something wonderful, the best in the world, the greatest. Something that, as a logical consequence, makes others look at it as if from a pedestal: one enters the illumination of the great mysteries, one is chosen among thousands to form part of a perfect body; the others, what a pity! are still down there, wrapped in the darkness of error, exposed to all the dangers. By the fact of being part of the Work, one will always be right, the sure doctrine will be given to those poor people who are mistaken, deformed, ignorant and naive; because as soon as one arrives, one is already endorsed, supported and guaranteed by the directors, especially selected people (that is how they should conceive themselves) who possess, because they are united to the \"Father\", the gift of the unspeakable. Because the \"Father\" never makes mistakes, and in the Work everything passes through the \"Father\": \"you must pass everything through my head and my heart,\" Escrivá repeatedly said to the directors”. (68)\n\nYou cannot even be a good Christian, for Opus Dei, if you have any physical ailment or illness. No one is admitted who has not passed the thorough medical examination to which they are subjected. The Club of God is restricted to healthy people, as one of the numeraries of Opus Dei tells us in her bitter story. She was a bit shocked when, a couple of days before \"beeping\" - entering the Work - she was told that she had to have a medical examination. “What did my state of health have to do with being in the Work? Wasn't it important to have a vocation? Or was it that if they discovered my kidney stones, my vocation became a decision in the hands of the doctor? This young woman has arrhythmias, forget everything you have told them, she cannot be of the Work? Funny, isn't it? The reason for this procedure is not to burden a person, apparently young and healthy, who soon after joining the Work is discovered to have some kind of more or less serious illness, because they would have to take care of her, and the Work does not want prematurely ill people, even if two days before the recognition they were sure that she had a rock-like vocation. They didn't find anything for me. However, they advised me not to say anything about the doctor at home. It was necessary to be discreet.” (69)\n\nIn the little book \"The Way\", written by the \"charismatic leader\", there are also opposite images: (70) two types of man. Firstly, the shining image of the superman, fierce, arrogant, willful, unshakable in the ideology of his leaders and with an iron-clad contempt for the rest; God's gunman, effective and depersonalizing, disciplined to the point of absurdity, intolerant, inquisitive, in search of his absolute.\n\nOn the other hand, the tender image of the humble servant, a little vulnerable, modest, tiny among the tiny, with a low gaze, his eyes fleeing, persecuted, vexed by general hostility, masochistic at times, hypocritical at others, a little sprightly, lukewarm in everything, a little daring, but above all, never reckless, goes in search of a good bed to die for love. The two images overlap and mix to form the prototype of the \"Man of Opus Dei\" as he is found in life.\n\nThe members of Opus Dei have their capacity for discernment selectively nullified by being presented with, and made to believe blindly, that any attack on the Work of God is \"slander\" (71) when it comes from other members of the Catholic Church.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n63. \"Cuadernos de realidades sociales\" (\"Notebooks of social realities\"), Nos. 35-36, p 39.\n\n64.

Ambition for Wealth and Power - Unbridled Greed\n\nThe members of Opus Dei are a synthesis of Merchants of God and Temple Sellers. Pere Pique used to say that a clan capable of earning so many millions a year and of taking over, from the shadows, top-leading companies, when Jesus Christ shone and preached poverty in broad daylight, gives us something to think about and talk about. On top of that, founded by the man who would become Marquis and raised to a prelature by the controversial Polish Pope. (72) It is now urgent to give light to the shadow.\n\nAs the Instituto de Sociología Aplicada (Institute of Applied Sociology) indicates, through its specialized publication, sects do not usually devote much time to charitable works outside their own circle, since all their material resources are used for their own ends. What these sects mainly seek is \"cheap labour in the service of their own business\".\n\nThe instructions given to members of Opus Dei concern how to use their time and money for the benefit of the association. (73) In Opus Dei, if a man gave the organization his entire income during his lifetime and it can be proved that he spent less than he earned, is he entitled to any restitution or even compensation? The leaders of the Work maintain that he does not. (74)\n\nThe economic regime to which the members and associates of Opus Dei are subjected - especially the numeraries, who usually live together in flats or, to use the Work's terminology, in \"families\" generally made up of eight to ten members - is to hand over their salaries and earnings to the secretary at the end of the month, and when any of them needs to have a suit made or to buy some shoes, they consult the director for authorization to make this extraordinary expense. (75) Although the director does not have the power to decide what that suit should look like, there is no doubt that his advice carries weight in this respect. According to former members, there was a time when in each city there was a person who was responsible for \"orienting\" the members when they needed to renew their clothes and direct them to certain establishments more or less connected with the Work.\n\nThe version, with small nuances, is also assumed by Alberto Moncada who confirms the delivery at the cash desk of the house of the totality of their income and that later they had to request and ask for what was necessary, in agreement with their superiors and always within a scheme of scarcity imposed on them. They could not have individual bank accounts, nor private goods. At the end of the month, they must give the director, as part of their sharing of confidences, an account of the expenses they had incurred.\n\nFrom the moment you enter the Work - a numerary A. L. M. N. informs us - they keep a general account of income and expenses. Normally the income is higher than the expenses, so there is a surplus. But if you leave, never try to get your money back. You might start to believe that the Work is spiritual. All the things you have in your name must be put in the name of the Work, because you have to live \"poverty\" and God has asked us for everything - these are the arguments used. Your properties and belongings are put in the name of faithful numeraries. (76) When you leave, forget all that you have given.\n\nThis abuse of trust is justified in the sense that when you enter the Work, it is in good spirit - they insinuate - to sign what they put before you without first taking a look at it, because the Work, which is God's, which has a holy founder - they tell you - and which is a mother for her children, how can they sell you something and deliver a different thing? You sign whatever they throw at you. (77)\n\nIf in reality, as they deceptively say, you are a member of a purely secular association, why do they manage your income? If you enjoyed that \"so much exalted\" freedom, the money you earn would be in your bankbook, at your free disposal. But this is not the case: you will never know how much money you have, nor will you be able to dispose of it. You will never get a receipt for the money you have given. (78)\n\nThe magazine Interviú published, for the first time in April 1988, an exceptional probative document, a proof of fulminant eviction, the photocopy of the will of an Opus Dei member, María del Carmen Rodríguez Pinto, in favour of Opus Dei. The will was granted before the notary of Oviedo, José Antonio Caicoya, and in its second clause it designated Colegio Mayor \"Los Arces\", of Valladolid, as the universal heir of all its goods, rights and actions, on the condition that, when the succession is left, the spiritual care of this college would be entrusted to and carried out by Opus Dei. The wills, as well as the blank receipts for the sales of properties, always held by the directors of the Work, were jealously guarded secrets.\n\nCovadonga Carcedo, a former member of Opus Dei who was active for several years and who, as mentioned above, decided to apostatize the Catholic Church after many years of doubt and disillusionment with the work of the sect, declared to the public: “Once the pressure, the difficulties and even the death threats have been overcome, I am leaving. I want to stop belonging to an economic-financial sect, to a mafia made up of rich demagogues who exploit a few naive poor people and, from now on, I intend to live according to principles of honesty and forget about this world of hypocrisy forever.”\n\nCults are moved by criteria of pure economic profitability. (79) When a follower - because he or she is sick - only represents a maintenance expense and brings no benefit, he or she is given a pat on the back and sent off to his or her family, to the charity or to the street. And this applies to all destructive sects. There is no one like them to convince of the need to amass fortunes for \"their\" god or ideas.\n\nThe legal corruptions that these organizations use are very varied. The formula of \"voluntary donation\" is applied to the exploitation of their followers. Generally, the charismatic leader or \"father\" lives in opulence, mansions and palaces, surrounded by luxury and comfort, but, paradoxically, they do not legally possess anything, since the goods and properties they enjoy are simulated in the name of legal entities or trustees of their complete trust, although the encrypted keys of the current accounts are usually reserved. The \"parents\" and charismatic leaders avoid in this way any kind of civil or criminal liability.\n\nBetween the leaders and the followers there is a relationship god-slaves. And in that very favorable circumstance they not only take control of the mind of their unconditional ones by storing their soul, but also, and this is the most important thing, of their performance and capacity for work - exploitation - of their current account and personal goods.\n\nIn the Constitutions of Opus Dei, its strategy is camouflaged but implicit. Thus, the Article 9 states that “members of Opus Dei act either individually or through associations which may be cultural or artistic, or financial, etc., and which are called auxiliaries. These societies are likewise, in their activity, subject to the obedience of the hierarchical authority of the Institute” or the blatant article 202 which states that “the means of apostolate peculiar to the Institution are public offices, especially those involving the exercise of a direction.”\n\nArmando Segura Naya, as a graduate in Philosophy and Literature, made the following logical reflection: (80) “Opus in an inconceivable association. In the first place, it is inconceivable that ordinary faithful or simply people of high or low political or economic standing should not have ownership, administration and full responsibility for their property, nor be able to guarantee absolutely professional secrecy, not even free residence. Of course, the level of unbelief increases with the social level of the subject... no numerary nor oblate member administers his/her own goods, nor does he/she have the title of ownership over them, which is attributed to the \"Father\". It is inconceivable to try to cover the inconceivable with \"supernatural vision\". As is well known, what should not be, what is not naturally right, is not supernaturally right either.”\n\nThe justification Opus Dei gives to its unwary people is that private possession is selfish, it is an obstacle that prevents them from reaching happiness. Therefore it is absolutely essential that its followers donate all their properties to the sect that will keep them safe, and with this altruistic gesture it shows that it is imbued with the spirit of the Work, a work which equivocally and pompously, they say, is \"of God\" - what we do not know is which god they are referring to; whether it is the God of the Christians or the golden calf, the god Mammon.\n\nAs is well known, they look for the best elements, not to make them preachers, priests or missionaries of the infidels, but bank directors, heads of publications or ministers, in the obsession of handling exclusively, if necessary, the levers of power.\n\nSpecialists in the phenomenon of sects have coined the term \"Multinationals of the Spirit, S.A.\" to groups of the type of Opus Dei, because, on the spiritual pillars, they set up multi-million dollar financial businesses, (81) emphasizing that “Opus Dei has hardly anything to its name. It is not necessary for them, since control of assets, productive or otherwise, is effected through devotional rather than contractual ties. If one possesses the will of a person, he will also control all his acts and possessions, but avoiding, with such a ruse, possible fiscal responsibilities in particular and juridical responsibilities in general”.\n\nIn the recent book published in Spain under the title \"El Poder de las Sectas\" (\"The Power of Cults\") (82), which takes a look at all these organizations that are established and act with impunity in the Iberian Peninsula [i.e. Spain and Portugal], when it deals with Opus Dei, it says: “Opus Dei is no secret to anyone. It has always exercised its power and influence from behind its discreet faithful, over those who have great influence in both their private and professional lives. Although the era of the technocrats, when the men of the Work directly held part of Franco's power, is now over, Opus Dei's undercover political activity is still as powerful, if not more so, than in the past.”\n\n“Its faithful control a good part of the Spanish financial structure; they are in hundreds of key positions in the administration; they have politicians who are like-minded - who should be read as being servile to the Work of God - in many parties, especially in formations such as Partido Popular and Unió Democrática de Catalunya; they control, to a large extent, the Vatican apparatus and the Spanish Episcopal Conference, which is another no less important way of intervening in political processes, etc. In other countries, notably in Latin America, its influence is somewhat more modest than in Spain.”\n\n“If the faithful of the Work were simply 'good Christians', as they like to define themselves, their mention in a book on sects would not be justified. But the influence that the leadership of Opus Dei exerts on its flock goes far beyond the ideological and licit framework that is common to all religious and political ideas. What is common within the Work (which does not have to prevent possible exceptions) is the control of the psyche of its followers, under the excuse of administering their souls. That is to say, ignoring the poetic edges, to go on to control their mundane actions of today in function of a hypothetical later on in the morning.”\n\n“Opus Dei, with its undeniable sense of practicality and intelligence, dedicates itself to accumulate temporal power, through its believers, here and now, perhaps because, with its intuition for the unearthly affairs, it senses that, in the heavenly paradise, if it exists, there will be no room for ambitions of domination, whether material or spiritual. The kingdom of the Work of God is certainly of this world.”(83)\n\nFrom the pages of a national weekly magazine, (84) Fernando Jiménez Loitegui, from Almería, “could not understand how the Spanish authorities did not investigate the behaviour of these Opus Dei bankers who control banks and savings banks and have an influence on society that is beyond any control”.\n\nThe puerile and cynical response of an authoritative voice in Opus Dei, Salvador Bernal, author of a praiseworthy book on the life of the founder of Opus Dei entitled \"Monseñor Escrivá de Balaguer\", published by the official publisher of the sect, Rialp, in 1976, justified the control of the followers' assets in this way: “Children have nothing of their own, everything belongs to their parents... and your 'Father' always knows very well how he governs his patrimony.”\n\nREFERENCES\n\n72.

Recruitment and Proselytism of Members\n\nRecruitment is one of the first duties imposed on any sect. In order to achieve this primary objective - that from an artistic and plastic point of view could be represented in Goya's painting \"Saturn devouring his children\" - these organizations use any means to reach their goal, being deception and lies the weapons they use to try to place their merchandise, there always being a dissociation between the propaganda that is externalized and the reality that is lived inside.\n\nExperts in the field explain that lies applied to recruitment acquire all possible variants, from lies explicitly verbalized, to lies by \"omission\", through the concealment of identity and purposes of the sect. (86)\n\nAs for the recruitment from one of these destructive sects no one can feel immune to danger, no one can be sure of not falling into temptation, no one can boast of being allergic to the captive networks of these groups. Since the need to believe in something transcendental is inherent to the human being, the sociability of man has psychological components that, at a given time and if it is our low or critical hour, we can any be easy prey of this type of group.\n\nAny person has moments of crisis, of loss, of rupture, and it is precisely these moments, the situations of depression due to any problem or circumstance of relationship, affection or situation of any nature, when it is the most propitious and suitable moment to be approached by the followers. It is sought and watched, in young people, the times of exams, when the stress is greater, which can cause certain imbalances in the personality, or when one is withdrawn from the family or affective environment and in any circumstance close to loneliness.\n\nAlmost always the same picture is repeated, the same scene set in motion by the sects to encourage proselytism, which will begin with a trivial, motivating, pleasant conversation, which will conclude with an invitation (87) to attend a free conference on such and such a topic, an invitation to a meeting where we will meet a group of friends, to go to lunch or dinner where we can talk more relaxed, to spend a splendid weekend in a \"beautiful country house\", to make a spiritual retreat or to carry out any other always gratifying activity.\n\nIf you accept the generous and solicitous invitation, you will find yourself immersed in a prepared, artificial, illusory and fantastic atmosphere, where you will be presented with a world of happiness and illusion, where you will see smiling and happy people, in a relaxed atmosphere of great comradeship, who will be concerned and interested in the new \"friend\" who is accessing, and who will be given a warm welcome.\n\nresistance, in a friendly way. The newcomer will find himself entertained and understood. His concerns and his hopes will be revealed, and some of those present will say that they understand him perfectly, because that is how he was in the past until he found the way to overcome it. Everything that the unwary person says will be registered and written down, to open the file of the potential member and it will be made manifest to him They will be interested in his (or her) problems, his hobbies, his anxieties, his fears, his threats and his, by some leader in the future making use of those incipient manifested concerns, that he could avoid the fears and achieve his expectations thanks to the discovery of a new spiritual dimension.\n\nThe cam of new followers is always in a personal way, by direct contact, by human relationship with some member or follower of the sect.\n\nA valuable report on the psychology used in the process of conversion to certain harmful sects, carried out by Dr. John G. Clark in a team with other specialists from Massachusetts General Hospital, extensively describes the methodology used to recruit young people.\n\n- Young people who, whatever their natural ties, undergo the psychological transformations characteristic of the passage to maturity. Members of sects responsible for winning over proselytes frequently visit libraries, university venues, etc.\n\n- Persuasion: the future devotee is invited to attend a course of advice aimed at eliminating their problems. During these initial contacts and at the first meetings within the sect, recruiters do their best to make the religious community extremely attractive to the newcomer. They make him feel deeply moved, expressing their great interest in his welfare, treating him even with affection and paying calculated attention to his ideas, hobbies and hopes.\n\n- Conversion: the trusted members, previously trained for this task, do not leave the aspirant alone for a moment, accompanying him even to the door of the washroom.\n\n- Indoctrination: one of the consequences of this re-education is to polarize the mental activity of the devotee, inducing him to believe that the sect represents all that is good and profitable for him and that the other associations are pernicious, even perverse, so that they must be avoided at any cost or manipulated to put them at the service of the new member.\n\n- While indoctrination continues, spiritual leaders and directors lose no opportunity to conjure up the specter of supernatural punishment that punishes disobedience. Redemption, holiness, and salvation are reserved for convinced believers and practitioners. (88) Thus, little by little, he or she has become another man or woman different from he/she once was.\n\nAs to why people today join a sect, there can be various answers, depending on whether it is because of the inter-relational need of human beings to share a community life, the need for transcendence, the need to remedy the evils that afflict us, the shared affinity of a certain belief, the inherent need for mysticism and religion, the need to find a remedy for our frustrations or mutual help and assistance for our needs, the aspiration to a better social position, etc.\n\nMichael Walsh's book \"The Secret World of Opus Dei\" explains in detail the phenomenon of proselytism within the Work. (89) “When a person is not zealous to win over others it is because his heart does not beat. He is dead. And we can apply to him those words of Scripture \"Iam foetet, quatriduanus est enim\" (John 11:39), \"He is already decaying - literally stinking - because he has been dead for four days\". Those souls, even if they were in the Work, would be dead, decomposed, iam foetet. And I” - says the \"Father\" (Escrivá de Balaguer) - “am not going anywhere with dead bodies. I bury the corpses.”\n\nLooking for followers is a primary obligation, something that must be exposed every week in the circles: to what extent has an individual fulfilled his task of \"fishing\" - the word used by Opus Dei - for new members. “This is the moment for the task of counting. How many vocations have you brought? Our personal apostolate is directed in the first place to prepare our friends in the work of St. Raphael.” -- St. Raphael's apostolate is the term Opus Dei uses for the search for young members (“I am not saying” - concludes the \"Father\" - “that we cannot find vocations among older people, but that... is something difficult”) who could later, if suitable, be recruited to be full and celibate members (St. Michael's apostolate), or formed as parents (St. Gabriel's apostolate). -- “How willingly you laughed when I advised you to place your young years under the protection of St. Raphael so that he could guide you, as he did with young Tobias, to a holy marriage with a girl who is good, beautiful and rich.” (Escrivá)\n\nThose who have friends among the members of Opus Dei may be annoyed to know that their friendship is considered a means of attracting new followers. Once won, professionals replace them to follow the organization's procedures.\n\nThe removal of children from their families goes hand in hand with the creation of an increasingly dependent relationship with Opus Dei. (90)\n\nThe following testimony from a priest from Catalonia tells us about his own experience. (91) «They told us \"come with us, come to our house, to our place. We have talks and prayers with other boys who have the same problems as you. You will be able to progress in the spiritual order.\" Some friends behind me have been chasing me, locking me up for several months. And I did not know that they belonged to Opus Dei. Suddenly, I realized it. And it was very difficult to escape their pressure, their perseverance, you understand.»\n\n“I entered Opus Dei because of all this, like others. And it wasn't until later that I realized that this was a trap, a snare. You have to be inside to realize that. I made the path that needs to be made. I went with them. I attended their talks, etc. Immediately I was appointed a spiritual director, a layman, who made your life plan, that is, what you had to do from getting up to going to bed, what you had to do and what you did not have to do. We had to give an account of our actions regularly every week, to our leaders. Nothing had to be taken care of. When you had an interior problem, you had to present it to your spiritual director, who would give you the explanation and the solution. He was your conscience. This was comfortable. This contributed greatly to the success of Opus Dei. I left when I realized that this was a progressive imprisonment.”\n\nPublic opinion is generally unaware of the methods with which Opus Dei acts on Spanish youth. (92) Its systems of proselytism are similar to those employed by the Orientalist sects that proliferate in the West, and conflicts are increasing with parents whose minor children have been recruited by the Work.\n\nSects, like Opus Dei, are in the business of teaching as a very convenient activity to attract new followers, using teaching and classrooms as laboratories where the process of selecting and receiving future members begins. Opus Dei is the subject of many well-founded accusations of sectarian manipulation of students who come to its educational centers.\n\nThe infiltration of Opus Dei into the high schools offers innumerable examples. The best individuals are constantly the subject of various invitations. This expeditious way of acting has some success among the middle classes. The most valuable individuals are sought to support Opus Dei and all its paraphernalia.\n\nScenes like the following one occur more and more frequently. “Opus has kidnapped our Conchi.” The police of the town of San Vicente (Alicante) could not believe their ears when a couple of well-known local merchants came to the police station, in January 1988, with such an unusual accusation.\n\nThe accusations of these parents, most of whom were good Catholics, against Opus Dei, were mainly for having kidnapped their minor children, brainwashed them and annulled their will, confronting them with their own families, whom they had kept ignorant, while exploiting them economically.\n\nIt is significant what happened to Mr. Mosquera, (93) a podiatrist from Barcelona who went to the police headquarters in Via Layetana to denounce the case of his daughter María Pilar. The young woman had gone to Vienna to study music while working as an au pair in the house of an Opus Dei family, and had been subjected to real harassment by people of the Work who, according to her, persecuted her and even raided her home and boycotted her exams as a form of pressure. “I was attended to by a very kind sergeant of the national police” - explains Mosquera - “and what would not be my surprise when, after explaining my story to him, he said: What are you going to tell me? I have a 19-year-old daughter who almost went crazy for Opus Dei.”\n\nIn Oviedo, the Director of the Montealegre Club, one of the more than 100 that Opus Dei has in Spain, received a notary request from the parents of a 17-year-old girl who frequented the club, who demanded that she (the Director) abstain from having any relationship with their daughter. (94)\n\nThis whole set-up, which was sinuously called apostolic action, but which should properly be called exclusively \"proselytism\"(95) in Opus Dei, is called \"holy coercion\".\n\n“We don't care about statistics” - Escrivá said. But the number of people who ask for admission to the Work each year does matter. Even quotas are set for each house or city, and members are strongly urged not to fail to achieve these figures.\n\nOn the subject of recruiting young people, Juan de Cozar Martín from Línea de la Concepción, in the province of Cadiz, reveals (96) how this religious sect, by means of some very well studied techniques (brainwashing, periodic sharing of confidences, coercion of conscience) deforms young people in such a way that they lose primarily their affection for their family, disconnecting them from their parents and siblings. It depersonalizes them and turns them into machines programmed solely for their convenience, squeezing them like a lemon.\n\nEva Jardiel Poncela, the daughter of the famous Spanish novelist, tells us about her personal experience, (97) “my first experience with Opus Dei, honestly, made me sick. That is the truth. I couldn't believe it. It seemed impossible, and I thought about how many people like me who would go through a bad time in their lives would become members of Opus Dei just out of cowardice, and I thanked God for not having been born a coward.”\n\nThe main means of formation in Opus Dei are courses and retreats, which usually take place in specially prepared houses, located far from major urban centers. There are houses for numerary members, diocesan clergy, and girls, in which the social category and status of those attending is discriminatory. (98) Thus, in a course for numerary girls, there will never be any service girls - except for cleaning the house - just as in the case of a businessman's retreat, there will never be a simple worker. Depending on the duration and the psychological moment, there are courses and retreats, short circles, etc.\n\nSuch is the manipulation to which the students are subjected that sometimes news comes out in the press in which official bodies are forced to investigate irregularities in Opus Dei's schools, because of complaints from the students' families. (99) The Department of Education of the Autonomous Government of Catalonia is investigating alleged irregularities in \"Centro de Estudios El Vallés\" (\"El Vallés Study Centre\"), a boarding school for girls located in the town of San Cugat del Vallés, near Barcelona, and owned by Opus Dei. These investigations were initiated following a complaint by the family of the student Gema Saiz Broch.\n\nAccording to the student's mother, María Broch, “Opus Dei uses its schools to recruit minors.” (100) “My daughter's future is to be a servant of the houses of Opus Dei, which are as beautiful and clean as gold, thanks to this branch of numerary assistants who work for free. If my daughter had not brainwashed, she would not have taken vows as a servant at the age of 16.”\n\nThe centre did not have a permit to give home lessons and the inspection has proposed to reprimand the boarding school and among the measures that could be taken are the cancellation of the economic concert, a warning to close the centre or the withdrawal of the academic operation license. Father Luis Hernández, who is the mayor of Santa Coloma de Gramenet, has sent a letter to the President of the Episcopal Conference, Angel Suquía, (101) in which he accuses Opus Dei of “committing grave violations against the freedom of persons in its effort to attract followers”, stating that “the formation that is given in the centers dependent on the Prelature - Opus Dei - is not professional, but is aimed especially at turning them into blind followers of Opus Dei.”\n\nThe selection is made from among schoolchildren, high school graduates, and students. These may have been \"chosen\" as early as the age of thirteen (102) and from that moment on are the object of close scrutiny by the Work's recruiting agents, who spread their ever-tighter nets around them. They are invited to circles, meetings, excursions... A spiritual director is then assigned to the candidate. Then, around the age of fifteen, if he is mature, if he fits into the mold well, he will write a letter to the \"Father\", “asking to become a member of Opus Dei”. This attachment to the \"Father\" is a central phenomenon.\n\nEighteen-year-old Susana Crespi Boixador managed to get out, as she confesses, “of that hell”. Her father, Jaime Crespi, said: “Children do not belong to us forever. But if my daughter throws herself into the river to drown, I'll throw myself into saving her. And this is what happened in Opus Dei. She entered into a spiral of following those who annulled her will”. Now, from the true freedom of Susana Crespi, who, when she thinks of the girls who are still in the grip of Opus Dei, is saddened, she wants to send her friends a message full of love and sincerity, because she categorically states (103) that “Opus Dei is worse than a sect. You are recruited as a child without you realizing it, and with the passage of time you become an automaton without the ability to discern between good and bad. They instill in you what they claim to be the good.” At the university level (104) the University of Navarra, owned by Opus Dei, has become an immense seedbed of \"apostles\" of Opus Dei, being the largest recruitment base for the Work in the world.\n\nAfter proselytism and recruitment, come the VOWS, which at first are taken for one year and renewed for five - the so-called \"Oblation\"; the next step is the juridical incorporation into the Work, which is called \"Fidelity\" - the culmination of the process of depersonalization.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n86.

Mistreatment and Coercion\n\n“My daughter is working as a servant for free”, says the mother (105). They make her work from ten in the morning to a quarter to eleven at night, without stopping, so that she doesn't think. I have told the ladies that the time of the black slaves is over, but their answer is that what she does is for God. But my daughter is not scrubbing floors for free for God, who does not need it, but for the Work.\n\nCovadonga Carcedo also tells of her experience of the humiliations she suffered when she became part of Opus Dei (106): “I used to get up at six in the morning, kiss the floor, exclaiming 'serviam', and take a cold shower. After work, I applied two hours a day wearing a cilice and gave my entire salary to the Work. In Opus Dei, as in all sects, they have a great capacity to brainwash you, but the truth is that they are a real cohort of scribes and Pharisees. They preach that there are no luxuries there, and yet the rich numeraries have to be assisted by uniformed maids during spiritual retreats. Now many people are leaving, especially the young ones, who did not know that once they were admitted they became real slaves.”\n\nThe daily rules that a member living in an Opus Dei house has to observe are very strict. (107) A person who was a numerary member of Opus Dei for more than ten years assured me that during the first seven years of his membership in Opus Dei, he lived in constant tension and was unable to comply with all the rules laid down. Moreover, he believed that none of those who lived with him or had met him in the ranks of Opus Dei had succeeded in doing so.\n\nAnother important observation is that all these sets of norms are an integral part of the \"spirit of the Work\". When they get up they kiss the ground and make the offering of all the things of the day to God, but the fruit of this offering is gathered by the sect leaders. They shower with cold water and are kept busy all day long so that they fall asleep and have no time to think about the misery they have made their existence.\n\nThe coercive dynamic is an essential characteristic of any sectarian structure and it should not be surprising to find it in groups as apparently honorable as Opus Dei itself. (108)\n\nA well-known architect, Miguel Fisac - who was one of the first twelve members of Opus Dei - who was a member of the Work for years, says:\n\n“During the time I was in the Work I was coerced to unacceptable extremes. So much so that when I finally managed to get Alvaro del Portillo (the great guru and successor of Escrivá de Balaguer) to let me out, he asked me to forgive those coercions and justified them by saying that since I had shown great generosity, they had interpreted it as a vocation.”\n\nThis so-called excess of zeal or \"holy coercion\" in the terminology of the Work, so typical of exploitative sectarianism that identifies vocation (religious, humanitarian, etc.) with irrational submission and slavery, cannot be justified either by earthly arguments or by divine allegations.\n\nTo pretend to cover up miserable coercion, of whatever kind and in whatever group, with the excuse of a \"disinterested dedication to the ideal\" is as little acceptable as to pretend to justify the activity of the guild of thieves under the mantle of a humanitarian campaign against selfish and sinful materialism.\n\nTorture is not only physical, but also, and in this case more subtle, psychological. As proof of this, we have the testimony of María del Pilar Domínguez Martínez, from Tuy (Pontevedra), (109) whose testimony informs us that as soon as she joined Opus Dei, she was hunted down by a numerary and taken to a doctor of the Work to find out if she was not physically handicapped. Later, the mortifications deformed her body and the \"sharing of confidences\", the talks, acquired their true character of interrogation, for which she expressed her discontent. When she realized that she wanted to leave Opus Dei, her superior decided to take her to a psychiatrist of the Work.\n\nIn 1965 Miss Tapia was called to the headquarters in Rome, where she was placed under virtual house arrest for eight months. She was not allowed to communicate with the outside world, either by telephone or letter. She was informed that anyone who asked for her would be told that she was sick or absent. Within three months her hair turned white. She asked if she could return to her family in Spain and was refused permission. Tapia had been director of the women's section in Venezuela.
