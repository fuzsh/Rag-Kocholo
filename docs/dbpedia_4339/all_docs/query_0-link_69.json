Anon., The Bale of Alcazarquivir (sixteenth century?).

When the young king died, so too did Portugal’s independence, for he le no heir. His uncle Philip II, king of Spain, took the throne aer a brief power struggle followed by an armed invasion. From the blood and dust of the bale of Alcazarquivir arose some of Europe’s best-known and perpetual royal imposters, the false Sebastians. This book tells the story of one of them, perhaps the least credible, even in an age when prophecies and marvelous occurrences formed the natural structure of people’s imaginations. Sixteen years aer the bale, a man appeared in a town in Spain who said he was (or was thought to be) Sebastian. His name was Gabriel de Espinosa. As far as anyone can tell, the mastermind of this imposture was the Portuguese vicar of an Augustinian convent for well-born women, and the immediate objective of the plan was to convince one of the nuns, who happened to be Philip II’s niece, that this man, a former soldier and occasional baker (pastelero), was her cousin. From there, the plan involved puing a Portuguese pretender on the throne. The principals and a large cast of nuns, monks, and servants were conﬁned and questioned for nearly a year as a crew of judges tried to unravel the story, but the culprits went to their deaths leaving many questions unanswered. The conspiracy took place at a moment of high political tension. Rexix\n\nlations between Spain and Portugal, like those between any neighbors, were both close and fractious, and there were Portuguese who had not resigned themselves to being ruled by a Spaniard, even by one whose mother was Portuguese. The 1590s were unstable years not only in Spain and Portugal but throughout much of Europe, and not just in the political realm but also culturally, even subjectively. Assumptions were proving fragile. The weather was terrible, the king was dying, wars were going badly, and Spain’s fortunes were waning. So it was a time for grasping at straws. When the world appears to be collapsing, people cling to whatever they have at hand, to whatever seems likeliest to help. They seek explanations. The phenomenon of the false Sebastians is called sebastianismo, a strain of millenarianism sometimes regarded as evidence of frustrated nationalism or proof that Portugal was a tragic, vanquished madhouse. I do not subscribe to this interpretation, but this is not a book about sebastianismo, among other reasons because it leans toward Spain rather than Portugal, because that is where the deception was staged. The conspiracy to remove Philip from the Portuguese throne in favor of a Portuguese ruler may have had no chance of succeeding, but that does not make it a mere anecdote, and though there is lile doubt that King Sebastian was an odd character, there is more to be gleaned from his short life than can be found in the oen tendentious historiography, which veers from adulation to dismissal with lile in between. In the pages that follow, I try to right this wrong by creating a bridge between the story and politics, between the structures of narrative and the demands of diplomacy. This story of a false Sebastian has a great deal to teach us about news and politics and about how people manage to live among forces they might not understand. The story, in other words, maers. People then, as now, were dying for news. They were eager to hear a good story, an important one, and they were equally eager to turn around and tell it to somebody else. Telling stories, including this one, tied people to a place and time. In an era when news began traveling throughout the Iberian peninsula and hardship and intrigue put people on the road, commoners and elites spoke and read about national independence, intrigue, the cause of Christendom, visible truth, royal authority, and the limits of the possible. In retelling xx\n\nPrologue\n\nthe story of the pastelero of Madrigal, this book points to the signs of recognition that helped people interpret their world. In its illogical folds, the story contained familiar sequences of adventure and redemption that made some sense to the victims, observers, and judges who became entangled in or fascinated by the events in the Castilian town of Madrigal de las Altas Torres. Though I may at times give in to temptation and paint this conspiracy and its actors in comic tones, I want to make clear that I do not consider these people amusing. The story of the pastelero has been told for centuries as a curiosity; it has been held up as an example of the exoticism and credulity of the past, something to make tourists and readers see history as entertainment. In my view, the characters in the story display fearless imaginations, they rise to conceptual, political, and physical challenges we cannot conceive of, and they are very, very serious. They should be taken on their own terms, not as simple curiosities or curious simpliﬁcations. Their choices, even those choices punished by death, reveal what they thought was right or possible, and their descriptions and memories were a way of stating opinions. Though their lives embodied what we might consider contradictory approaches to the world—devotion and lies, political acuity and blunders, conﬁnement and wandering—such inconsistency should lead us not to dismiss them but to grapple with the ambiguities of the past. The story teems with characters who are someone other than who they appear to be. Commoners are disguised as kings, kings are disguised as hermits, royals believe they are commoners, several phony friars dri through, and travelers claim to be related to the royal nun, which probably they were not. This was an era, the dawn of the age of Quixote, when the distinction between truth and ﬁction was of great philosophical concern. It also was a practical religious consideration; one of the Inquisition’s primary tasks was to ferret out false Christians, as neither Jews nor Muslims could legally practice their religion but might be doing so secretly. Spain’s playwrights during this Golden Age of literature ﬁlled their stages with characters dressed up as someone else. Imposters plagued many of Europe’s royal families. And politics was understood to be the legitimate exercise of guile and deception. Prologue\n\nxxi\n\nThe conspiracy relied on news. Chronicles circulated throughout Europe recounting the tragedy of Alcazarquivir and, years later, its wondrous second act. We will see that people wrote and received leers constantly; the precursors to our newspapers were called newsleers for a reason. The Madrigal case ﬁle includes anonymous leers, forged letters, coded leers, love leers, translated leers, oﬃcial leers, and letters containing testimony, some of which ended up in personal leers and then in news accounts, copied and reworded and then passed on, orally or in writing, assisted by the startling number of people traveling along the Iberian peninsula’s network of roads. Friars, spies, vagabonds, deserters, oﬃcials, and couriers all come and go, and they all carry tales. The literature of the time invariably features travelers who, in every sheltered cove, every inn, every chance encounter, seize the opportunity to exchange stories. Some of this world can be seen in the following pages. The boundaries of good history were a maer of concern in the late sixteenth century, and eyewitness testimony frequently was invoked to assure readers and listeners that these fantastic tales were really and truly true; thus newsleers oen represented the best of both worlds, truth and falsehood. But though facts and veracity were important, few spinners were not also guided by belief in God’s providence, knowledge of the lives of the saints, and a sense of tradition born from belonging to a people or a nation. They owed allegiance to all these things. The book begins with the story’s origins in Morocco, and from there moves to Portugal, to Castile, and to Madrigal de las Altas Torres. We go from King Sebastian, who lost his kingdom to folly, to don António, the Portuguese pretender who never aained one, to Philip II, the most powerful monarch in the world. And we move from Fray Miguel de los Santos, the saintly vicar, to Gabriel de Espinosa, the itinerant baker, to Ana of Austria, a young nun who deserved beer.\n\nxxii\n\nPrologue\n\nPlate 1.

He was the last of the Avis dynasty, which came to power in 1385 aer the Bale of Aljubarrota, in which Portugal won its independence from Castile. The Avis dynasty’s ﬁrst ruler was João I. A ready supply of able seamen, adventurous merchants, and ﬁnancial resources enabled overseas exploration and conquest during the next century. On a religious crusade and in search of wealth (the material objectives oen draped in the spiritual), the Portuguese in the early ﬁeenth century began venturing into Africa. First came the conquest, in 1415, of the strategic jewel of Ceuta, just opposite Gibraltar, where the stronghold’s owners could control traﬃc in and out of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. The capture of Ceuta by one of João’s many sons, Prince Henry, “the Navigator,” was followed by the seizure of Atlantic islands and incursions down the West African coast and inland in search of gold and slaves. The Portuguese in 1471 captured the Moroccan towns of Asilah and Tangiers, and they rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1488. In 1497, Vasco da Gama reached India, opening up the sea routes to Asia and its spice trade, which Portugal dominated for the next century. Vasco de Gama’s voyages were the basis for the greatest work of early Portuguese literature and its na-\n\n1\n\ntional epic, Luís Vaz de Camões’s The Lusiads (published in 1572), which, as it happens, was dedicated to Sebastian: And you, my boy King, guarantor Of Portugal’s ancient freedoms, And equal surety for the expansion Of Christendom’s small empire; You, who have the Moors trembling, The marvel prophesied for our times, Given to the world, in God’s eternal reign, To win for God much of the world again.1\n\nSebastian was born on January 20, 1554, eighteen days aer the death of his father, the seventeen-year-old João, also an only child.2 Sebastian’s mother was Juana of Austria, sister of Spain’s King Philip II. His parents’ marriage was part of a centuries-long strategy by Spain to keep a foothold next door. Chroniclers who knew how the story ended recounted Sebastian’s beginnings as having been marked by dreams and visions, “fulﬁllment prophecies” typical of late medieval monarchs who were destined to be saviors of the faith.3 Juana’s alleged visions as she awaited the birth of her child seemed to point toward Africa. By one account, she saw a group of Moors wearing robes of diﬀerent colors enter her room. At ﬁrst she thought they were her guards, but when they le and then entered again, she swooned into the arms of her servants.4 Portraits of Juana depict a stern but possibly beautiful woman whose intelligence leaps oﬀ the canvas. She was educated by the Portuguese servants brought to Castile by her mother, the Portuguese-born empress Isabel, and she married a Portuguese prince, her cousin João, in 1552. (The future Philip II had married João’s sister María.) Just ﬁve months aer João’s death and her son Sebastian’s birth, Juana was summoned back to Spain while Philip II went to England to marry Mary Tudor (María of Portugal having died in 1545). The nineteen-year old princess never saw her son again. She went on to be one of her brother’s most trusted advisers, acting as regent in his absence. She established Madrid’s most elite and beautiful convent, the Descalzas Reales, where there are several portraits of Sebastian, which 2\n\nChapter 1\n\nFigure 3. “Mappa Astrologico Matematico,” drawn on the occasion of Sebastian’s birth in 1554, from “Colleccão curioza das profecias e controversias sebasticas. . . . ,” vol. 2 (MS; Lisbon, 1766).

Deeply spiritual, she was possibly the ﬁrst woman allowed into the Jesuits.5 As a child, Sebastian was “fair, blond, and beautiful, with a happy disposition. In his time, navigation was very prosperous, with no shipwrecks,” stated a history of Iberian royalty, pointing to a contemporary priority.6 Lisbon, the capital of his kingdom, was the largest and most imposing of Iberia’s cities; the historian Fernand Braudel said that had Philip II made Lisbon his capital instead of Madrid, he could have transformed it into another London or Naples. 7 Sebastian was raised by a series of Jesuit tutors and confessors and by two relatives: his grandmother, Catherine, who was both his father’s mother and his mother’s aunt, and his great-uncle Henry, who had entered the priesthood at fourteen, was an archbishop by twenty-two, and donned the red robes of a cardinal at thirty-three. The two in-laws had deeply opposing aitudes toward child-rearing, education, religion, and national allegiance. Catherine’s primary loyalty was to Spain, whose ruler, Philip (her nephew and one-time son-in-law), was her constant correspondent and one of her few remaining relatives; she and her husband, João III, buried all nine of their children, only two of whom had survived long enough to marry. João III died in 1557, and three-year-old Sebastian was sworn in as king. Catherine served as regent until 1562, at which point Henry took over, marking a shi toward more Portuguese interests. He handed the throne to the fourteen-year-old Sebastian in January 1568. Though the young Sebastian was an avid sportsman and rider, he also was reported to be sickly.8 The ﬁrst indication we have is that he suﬀered severe chills aer a day of heavy hunting when he was eleven. The incident was blamed on excessive exercise, but soon it became apparent that there was something urogenital about the ailment, though successive doctors could not decide what it was. Juana sent one of her most trusted aides, Cristóbal de Moura, from Madrid to investigate in 1565, and Philip II sent his own team of doctors. The symptoms appear to have involved involuntary ejaculation, vertigo, fevers, and chills. At least one medical report referred to gonorrhea.9 The question on everyone’s mind, of course, was whether he could have heirs; sadly, the question appears never to have been put to the test. The Spanish ambassador, in the midst 4\n\nChapter 1\n\nof later negotiations to arrange an appropriate marriage for Sebastian, told Philip II in 1576, “It has been shown that the king has not proved himself nor has he ever tried.” Furthermore, he said, voicing the opinion of all Spanish emissaries throughout Sebastian’s life, “he so hates women that he cannot bear to look at them. If a lady serves him a drink, he tries to take it without touching her. . . . The Jesuits who educated him taught him that contact with women was tantamount to the sin of heresy, and in absorbing this doctrine he lost the capacity to distinguish virtue and gentility from oﬀenses to God.” Enemies of the Jesuits as well as those simply concerned about the rocky Portuguese ship of state accused the boy’s tutors of essentially holding him captive.10 If Sebastian did not like women, he adored activity, both spiritual and physical. Chroniclers and biographers all make note of Sebastian’s athleticism and his admirably enthusiastic religiosity. He “was by nature extremely bellicose and since childhood inclined toward weaponry and war games.”11 The Spanish playwright Luis Vélez de Guevara around 1607 depicted a servant asking the young monarch if he wished to dance, paint, or fence, suggesting that dancing would be the correct choice: Mi corazón tales cosas no apetece. Soy colérico y no quiero estar dos oras o tres, moliendo el cuerpo y los pies al compás de un majadero. A armas mi estrella me yncita, quanto es ﬂema lo aborrezco, y si la caça apetezco, es porque la guerra ymita.12\n\nThere probably was no Christian in mid-sixteenth-century Iberia (or anywhere else, for that maer) who was not devout, but there were degrees, and Sebastian’s piety was of the militant brand. In particular, he was consumed with a passion for taking back portions of North Africa that his grandfather João III had been forced to relinquish in the 1540s. Morocco: King Sebastian\n\n5\n\nThat retreat was regarded by many as a shameful episode, one Sebastian felt duty-bound to rectify. This deeply religious young man who, judging by his mother’s visions, was born to ﬁght the inﬁdel was called O Desejado, “the desired one.” Son aer son and cousin aer cousin had died, and few courtiers would dare criticize or tether the only royal male heir le to Portugal. (His most famous dead cousin was don Carlos, son of Philip II and María of Portugal, who was imprisoned by his father and died in suspicious circumstances in 1568 at the age of twenty-three.) An account of Sebastian’s childhood wrien by his confessor informs us that the boy was “endowed with such extraordinary force that he exceeded all others of his time.” He was gied at sports and “incomparable in the agility of his arms and legs. . . . He was of good stature, with proportionate limbs . . . with absolutely no defects [and with] grace and beauty.”13 The adulation was such, Spanish ambassador Juan de Silva informed a colleague in Madrid, that “they will tell him he’s the tallest man in Portugal, or the best musician, or anything similar. His wit is sharp but confused, he imagines things he cannot understand, and thus monsters are born and they tell him he is beer than [Cicero].” Later that month Silva told Philip II that Sebastian’s education had been so “barbarous” that his virtues would remain forever hidden. Silva cannot have been surprised; he had been warned by his predecessor, Juan de Borja, that he would have to walk on eggshells with his sensitive compatriots (Silva had Portuguese blood) and their king, always reassuring them of Spain’s love for them.14\n\nIn Search of a Land to Reconquer\n\nPersistent inbreeding, ideologically rigid education, religious excess, vanity and adulation, and a proven inability to reason with much intellectual capacity are not the sorts of elements advisable when launching a military expedition. But those, according to chroniclers, ambassadors, and relatives, were the characteristics that deﬁned the teenage monarch, increasingly obsessed with the religious mission of his family and his nation.15 In the summer of 1569, when a ﬁerce epidemic obliged the royal family to leave Lisbon (some ﬁy people a day died in Lisbon for weeks; one historian says that half of Lisbon’s population perished),16 he 6\n\nChapter 1\n\nFigure 4.

Courtesy of the Hispanic Society of America.\n\ntraveled throughout Portugal and decided to open up the tombs of several of his ancestors at the beautiful Alcobaça monastery. Over the protests of the Cistercian monks who guarded the royal remains, he swore to the unearthed bodies, including those of Afonso II and Afonso III, that he would restore Portugal’s glory. According to later accounts, he was impervious to the voice of reason: “Sire, these Kings and your ancestors did not set for you an example of conquest of other kingdoms but rather they taught you to conserve your own,” counseled Father Francisco Machado, of the University of Paris, who happened to be at Alcobaça. “May God grant you a long life and give you a name and a tomb as honorable as these.”17 Sebastian’s religious enthusiasm was further fueled by the famous bale of Lepanto on October 7, 1571, the hero of which was don Juan of Austria, Sebastian’s uncle. Don Juan had just suppressed the Moriscos (converted Muslims) in the Alpujarras mountains outside Granada, who revolted in 1568 over increased and repressive restrictions. Aer his victory there, don Juan took command of a Holy League ﬂeet organized by Pope Pius V and secured a dramatic and audacious victory against the Turks, capturing some two hundred of their galleys and thousands of men, as well as freeing ﬁeen thousand galley slaves. As many as forty thousand men may have been killed at Lepanto. The league promptly fell apart, and the Turks rearmed, but Lepanto nonetheless became a benchmark for both victors and vanquished, a laer-day bale of Actium where West defeated East and Christendom triumphed over the inﬁdel.18 The following year, in July 1572, the Portuguese viceroy of India, Luís de Ataíde, returned to Lisbon to huge celebrations and processions. This, too, ﬁred Sebastian’s imperial visions, and he commenced eﬀorts to raise troops and ships, though it was unclear who exactly the enemy would be. There were bad omens, though, which everyone would remark upon later. The 1569 plague was later interpreted as the ﬁrst of these signs. On September 13, 1572, a vicious storm struck Lisbon, and thirty warships in the harbor were dashed to pieces, while houses and structures up and down the Tagus River were destroyed. And the young king continued to show alarming signs of bad health. Philip II’s ambassador during Sebas8\n\nChapter 1\n\ntian’s youth, Juan de Borja, regularly informed his master of the chills, fevers, and bleeding. Yet with the triumphant backdrop of Lepanto and Ataíde’s return to Portugal, Sebastian in the summer of 1574 began planning his own crusade. The Spanish royal chronicler Antonio de Herrera wrote that Sebastian initially wanted to go to India but his advisers talked him down to Morocco, never dreaming he would actually go.19 His plan was to recapture the territory from the Moors, an objective the chroniclers said he had cherished since childhood and for which, it will be remembered, he was destined. Though the bolder of his ministers counseled him to abandon the plan, really not much of a plan at all, the king resisted, ordering recruiters to raise men, all the while trying to keep the project a secret. Borja wrote Philip II on August 14, “The king le Lisbon for [the nearby royal retreat of] Sintra on 3 August, and though people have suspected for days that he sent don António with soldiers to Tangiers [in July] in order to later go there himself, it seemed so crazy I did not even inform Your Majesty, having had the same suspicions last year. . . . But this time there is so much evidence that it is true that I am obliged to write, although the king has not yet informed the queen [Catherine] of his objective.” Indeed, Sebastian’s grandmother, from whom he was estranged, was kept in the dark until it was too late. “My grandson sailed yesterday and everyone tells me he will go to Africa. He always hid it from me and he also hid his departure, and though today I was given a leer from him saying he will go to Algarve [southern Portugal], I fear what everyone says and I am suﬀering and in great sorrow,” Catherine wrote to Philip II.20 Cardinal Henry, “tired and distressed because the king would not listen to him,” instructed Sebastian to ﬁrst produce an heir and only then go to war, if he insisted. Sebastian ignored him.21 There were, it was said, noblemen on board the king’s ship who had no idea where they were bound, and news of the arrival in Africa of the paltry expedition, numbering some three thousand men, was received with shock and anger in Lisbon and Madrid. A young monarch with no heir in sight had no business puing his life in danger. The expedition, based in Tangiers, lasted around three months and was marked by its obvious lack of purpose. At one point Catherine sent Morocco: King Sebastian\n\n9\n\na messenger to Sebastian telling him that if he did not come home right away she would go and fetch him. Another person who corresponded with Sebastian was Abu Abdallah Muhammed, “Lord of the Lords of the Monarchy and Empire of Africa and all its inhabitants,” and he would not be the last Moroccan ruler to advise Sebastian to stay away. He had been informed that the king of Portugal, moved by his “royal and generous spirit,” had decided to visit his lands. “We are very grateful for this noble act” and are willing to help him in all possible ways, he wrote. “But if your intent is other” than noble, Muhammed cautioned him, “you will ﬁnd our people waiting, ready to show their force against your rash impudence.”22 While in Tangiers, Sebastian deposed don António as governor of that outpost, replacing his cousin and the eventual pretender to the throne with Duarte de Meneses. The adventure ﬁnally came to an end in October, when the weather turned cool and Philip II refused to send the young king’s forces a shipment of grain to replenish their exhausted food supply. A bit on the defensive aer spending three months harassing bewildered North Africans who mostly le him alone, Sebastian wrote several open leers to Portugal’s cities upon his return explaining that he had really only meant to visit his forts. He also wrote a chaotic, ﬁythree-page account of the adventure.23 Morocco in the sixteenth century was governed by the Sa’did sharifs; the Sa’dians were a family from southern Morocco who ﬁrst rose to prominence precisely in opposition to the Portuguese, and sharifs were those who claimed descent from the Prophet. The dynasty established a state that laid the framework for modern Morocco. Its capitals were Fez and Marrakech, from where they ran important trading centers on the Atlantic coast. The Sa’dians also pushed inland, eventually capturing Timbuktu in 1591, enabling them to control markets of slaves and gold. Morocco’s importance to Portugal derived not only from its geographic position at the entrance to the Mediterranean, but from its increasing wealth and its symbolic place as the home of the inﬁdel Moors who once occupied Iberia. It also possessed potentially vast deposits of saltpeter (potassium nitrate), a critical component of gunpowder, which was of keen interest to all the European powers. The sharifs generally managed to play the Turks, the two Iberian nations, and the English against one 10\n\nChapter 1\n\nother, each member of this ﬁnely tuned diplomatic quartet in turn distrustful, greedy, and careful. The opportunity for Sebastian to return to Morocco (and upset the balance) arrived in 1576, when Muhammed was deposed by his uncles, Abd al-Malik and Ahmad al-Mansur, because of Muhammed’s tainted bloodline. Malik, who would rule from 1576 to 1578, was a sophisticated and cultured man who spent many years in exile in the bustling cities of Constantinople and Algiers, and he was largely funded by the Turks. Then in his early thirties, he was one of the great examples of the crossfertilization of Mediterranean Christianity and Islam. Aer the bale of Lepanto, he brieﬂy was a captive of Spain. Another Lepanto veteran, Miguel de Cervantes, knew Malik in Algiers and wrote of the Westernized Easterner that “he speaks Turkish, Spanish, German, Italian, and French, he sleeps standing, eats at a table, sits like a Christian, and above all is a great soldier, liberal, wise, comprising a thousand graces.”24 The deposed Muhammed, who earlier had begged Sebastian not to invade, now turned to Spain and Portugal for help against his uncles. (In Lope de Vega’s version, the Moroccan ﬂaered the young Portuguese king by comparing him to his imperial grandfather: “You, the famous Sebastian, in whose face I see the image of the Fih Charles . . .”)25 While Muhammed awaited Iberian assistance, he was a guest in Ceuta. Philip II was reluctant to get involved in the struggle; subsequent writers would speculate as to his ulterior motives (he stood to gain whether Sebastian won or lost), but there were good reasons for shiing his aention away from North Africa. The Turks by then really were in decline and were anyway looking covetously eastward to Persia, and Philip in 1578 ended up signing a truce with them. He also probably ﬁgured it was best for Spain to remain friends with as many Moroccans as possible and avoid the establishment of a Muslim alliance in the western Mediterranean. His most immediate tasks now lay north and in the Atlantic: to combat the Dutch Protestants ﬁghting for their independence, keep an eye on England and France, and protect the American ﬂeet, all while managing a budget in continual crisis. Sebastian, however, insisted, and the two monarchs, uncle and nephew, met in December 1576 in the company of their closest advisMorocco: King Sebastian\n\n11\n\ners to discuss both the impending African campaign and long-standing aempts to ﬁnd Sebastian a wife. The site of their ten-day meeting was the huge and wealthy Hieronymite monastery of Guadalupe, in western Spain near the Portuguese border. This was one of the greatest shrines in sixteenth-century Castile and a frequent destination of pilgrims. Columbus went there to give thanks aer returning from America; so did pilgrims in works by Cervantes and Lope de Vega. Essentially a royal town unto itself, the complex included hospitals, a school, the monastery and church, workshops, and some seven hundred inhabitants. In light of subsequent events, the meeting would be the subject of chronicles and dramatic productions that traced the tragic denouement back to that majestic encounter in the shadow of priceless relics.\n\nFamily Maers on the Eve of Bale\n\nThe meeting was prefaced by twin journeys. It took Philip eight days to travel to Guadalupe from his monastery-palace of El Escorial, and he arrived before his nephew to take charge of assigning rooms. With him were many of Spain’s leading churchmen and nobles, including the duke of Alba and Philip’s loyal aide Cristóbal de Moura, who served as translator.26 Sebastian took a couple of days longer, leaving Lisbon on December 11. Philip went to receive him and his huge entourage as they arrived in Guadalupe, waiting by the side of the road for nearly half an hour as his nephew approached.27 When they saw each other in the distance, the two monarchs descended from their respective carriages, removed their hats, walked toward one another, and embraced. Sebastian, according to the account I am using, was unmistakably a Hapsburg and was a couple of inches taller than his uncle. Philip also removed his hat in greeting the high Portuguese noblemen. Sebastian, however, le his hat on his head as the Spanish dukes and counts greeted him, a practice that he continued throughout his stay and that annoyed Spanish critics, always quick to point to Portuguese aﬀectations. “Asked how many people the king [Sebastian] brought,” went a contemporary doggerel, “he boldly replied, ‘no more than eight hundred; we travel light.’”28 Like his uncle, Sebastian came accompanied by the most outstanding members of his nobility and 12\n\nChapter 1\n\nchurch, including the duke of Aveiro, and in every town he had passed through there were triumphant celebrations and elaborate festivities. A composition called “Very Famous Romances” about the king’s arrival in the Spanish border city of Badajoz depicts Sebastian as “pale, blond, and very handsome, with a proportional body.”29 Vélez de Guevara chose to make Guadalupe the center of his early seventeenth-century play about Sebastian (the ﬁrst part transpired in Lisbon, the third in Morocco), inserting that most typical of Golden Age scenes in which the king, disguised as a commoner, encounters a nobody who speaks truth to power. Tell the king, this particular nobody, Baquero, advises Sebastian, “that this campaign he wants in Africa is crazy (loca) and that the Moors have neither hurt nor insulted him.” Tell him to look at the omens, he adds. Tell him to give us an heir.30 Conversations about Sebastian’s marriage prospects probably began the minute he was born.31 During the twenty-four years they lasted, the plans of the various and interrelated royal houses of Europe were continually upset by premature deaths that reshuﬄed the marriage deck. The strongest candidates for marriage to Sebastian were Margaret of Valois (his initial preference) and Elizabeth of Austria. Both girls were Philip’s nieces and Sebastian’s cousins. For strategic reasons, the French option was replaced by the Austrian plan, which itself fell apart aer don Carlos and Philip II’s wife, Elizabeth of Valois, both died, meaning Philip had to remarry. He chose another niece, Anne of Austria (originally betrothed to don Carlos), which meant Elizabeth of Austria went to France to marry Charles IX, sending Margaret to Sebastian. By then, though, the young Portuguese king no longer was willing to marry Margaret, even though the pope was keen on the idea so as to ensure France’s cooperation with the Holy League. Sebastian dithered, possibly inﬂuenced by his Jesuit advisers, and Charles IX, anxious to get his sister married, paired her oﬀ with the future Henry IV of France. Shortly thereaer, Charles IX died, leaving Elizabeth of Austria a widow, but she entered a convent rather than remarry. Candidates were swily disappearing. “To speak to him of matrimony is to speak to him of death,” remarked one of Philip’s envoys to Lisbon.32 No doubt Sebastian frequently changed his mind, but it is also logical to assume that he was fed up with other people making up Morocco: King Sebastian\n\n13\n\nhis mind for him. To his mother, Juana, he wrote, “I was shocked that you are now trying to persuade me to cede powers regarding my marriage in France, having previously worked so hard to block those plans.”33 Sebastian “has been very hurt since this maer ﬁrst began,” the same envoy wrote, “because of the changes that took place aer his ﬁrst marriage plans were so advanced and he was inclined in that direction. Though his character makes him diﬃcult and the king is young and distrustful, it seems to me he is like children, with their complaints and feelings, who are made content with a toy.”34 Ambassador Borja in 1570 said explicitly to Philip that his nephew was not homosexual (vicioso), but he could not come up with a logical explanation for the young man’s aversion to marriage, and some of Sebastian’s behavior, such as refusing to let anyone see him half-dressed, disturbed the ambassador and prompted jokes in the palace.35 By the time of the Guadalupe meetings in December 1576, the only marriage candidate le was Philip’s own daughter, Isabel Clara Eugenia, the option favored by Catherine, though it in no way beneﬁted Spain. Three of Philip’s sons were dead, and the remaining one, Philip, was weak. If he, too, should die, then Isabel Clara Eugenia would become queen. Philip was not enthused about marrying his daughter to this particular cousin; Sebastian’s health and probable impotence were serious concerns, and Juan de Silva, who by now had replaced Borja as Philip’s ambassador, informed his master of “secret meetings of many doctors in Lisbon.”36 In fact, Philip probably never seriously considered the option of marrying Sebastian to his daughter, though he said he would, but Sebastian undoubtedly saw the demand as a means of obtaining concessions at Guadalupe regarding the Moroccan adventure. The content of their meetings was not recorded by anyone. The two monarchs were actually face-to-face—the only time they ever met—ﬁve times, for a total of around twelve hours out of the ten days the gathering lasted. The rest of the time there were musical performances, religious services, and meals, “with fowl, goats, pheasants, rabbits, veal, venison, beef, and so much wine one would have thought [the Portuguese] were Flemings or Germans,” during which Philip took care to place Sebastian on his right, a sign of respect and a gesture that Spanish critics later said 14\n\nChapter 1\n\nthe Portuguese would have been wise to imitate. They were full of slights, arrogant as only those inferior can be, it was said. As a Spaniard and a Portuguese were walking by a cloister, for example, and the Spaniard suddenly saw Philip approach, he warned his companion, “Here comes the king.” “What king?’ replied the Portuguese.37 Sebastian, who was reported to be nervous and inaentive (not surprising, under the circumstances), was housed in a grand hall festooned with silk banners and bejeweled tapestries depicting biblical stories, the seven deadly sins and holy virtues, and bales among mythical gods and creatures. Nearby were nearly twenty smaller rooms occupied by his aides. A diplomatic crisis erupted when a (Spanish) cat managed to get into the rooms and soil the bedding such that it was completely unusable, “and the Portuguese were up in arms over this as if they had been greatly insulted.” For their part, the possibly unreliable chronicle went on, the Portuguese le the monks’ quarters an absolute pigsty, spent the nights making noise, and even locked the monks in their cells. Coming upon a cistern of rain water in the inﬁrmary, which the monks had deliberately covered with large, heavy stones so the water would stay inside, a few Portuguese gentlemen urinated in it, and they also deﬁled a stairway in a maer so unsuitable that the chronicler could not bring himself to describe it. “And if they behave like this here, imagine what they do at home.” Or so the Spanish writer said. Meanwhile, all Philip would promise Sebastian was ﬁy ships and ﬁve thousand men plus supplies on condition that the Moroccan campaign take place the following August (impossible to fulﬁll), that Sebastian himself raise ﬁeen thousand men, and that the expedition land in Larache, on the Moroccan coast, and stay there. One account said Sebastian was so annoyed at his uncle’s refusal to sign on to the expedition that he planned to leave at the crack of dawn of the last day without even saying good-bye; Philip II got wind of his plans, and arose extra early.38 In Sebastian’s absence, an enormous ﬁre burned through Lisbon; among the dead was the wife of the secretary of state, Miguel de Moura. Another omen. Upon returning to Lisbon, Sebastian prevailed upon his nobles to disregard their beer instincts, though they—particularly his closest friend, Cristóvão de Tavora—did manage to talk him out of leavMorocco: King Sebastian\n\n15\n\ning in fall 1577. Another calming inﬂuence was Francisco Aldana, a military oﬃcer and poet who was not only also talking to Juan de Silva (who described him as “a man of such good character”) but was employed by Philip II as a spy in Morocco, principally to show Sebastian the folly of his plans.39 A third nobleman who resisted Sebastian’s militaristic pressure was Viceroy Luís de Ataíde, who chose to return to India rather than participate in the Moroccan adventure. Silva later reported that Sebastian envisioned “a hundred thousand diﬃculties for his enemies and none for himself . . . and at present there is no human means by which to dissuade him.”40 Over the following months, the Portuguese nobility, clergy, and cities were pressured to “donate” funds; converted Jews also donated in exchange for a ten-year commitment by the crown not to seize their properties if they were later convicted of oﬀenses against the church. (This last arrangement was particularly distasteful to Juan Luis de la Cerda, duke of Medinaceli, whom Philip II sent to Lisbon to restrain Sebastian and who wrote back that Portugal was “one big synagogue.”)41 The hurry to obtain supplies and ﬁt the ships wreaked havoc on local markets, according to one contemporary, as greed was unabated, prices suﬀered alterations, and Lisbon was crowded with newcomers.42 The Genoese chronicler Gerolamo Franchi di Conestaggio’s starkly anti-Portuguese account reported that Sebastian ignored all the contrary advice of those who “lay before him that he was without heirs, that Christians should rather employ their arms against heretics than inﬁdels, that his forces alone were too feeble for so great an action, strengthening their reasons with many examples. . . . [But] there was neither reason nor example [that] could prevail against the king’s opinion, but, fortiﬁed in his resolution by men who (either for their own particular [reasons], or for want of judgment) did counsel him to war, it was concluded.”43\n\nWarnings from Heaven and Earth\n\nIt was not just his own men who were warning him. There were also the epidemics, the ﬁre, and the alarming weather. “The most miserable and unhappy year for Portugal was 1577, when the doors were opened to huge\n\n16\n\nChapter 1\n\nand frightening calamities aﬀecting much of Christendom. Observers said that there appeared to be larger and more frequent mutations and strange occurrences than had been seen in many centuries.”44 Worst of all, that most fearful (and predictable) of omens, a comet, appeared around November 7, 1577, and lasted some two months, “the largest and most extraordinary Comet that men had seen in many years.”45 Comets were known to signal imminent alterations in the aﬀairs of nature and societies, generally for the worse. Much depended on how and when the comet appeared. If the great lights should appear in many parts of the sky at once, a contemporary scholar wrote, then “drought and great turmoil in the air and aacks of armies or war” could be expected. “If Comets separated from the Sun by eleven signs should appear in the angle of a King or kingdom, . . . then the King or a grandee of that Kingdom will die. If they appear in the following house, then his treasure and belongings are safe but the Governor or administrator of his kingdom will change; if they appear in a ruinous house, illness and sudden deaths will follow.” Ptolemy and other ancient authorities, on whom these theories were based, were not always correct, the scholar admied. But sometimes they were.46 In the case of 1577, “Great judgments were issued, most aimed at the King of Portugal because he was seen to be so immersed in war and so ill prepared for such an important maer. . . . But as the ancients also would interpret such wonders in their favor, to urge on their soldiers, . . . the Portuguese said that their blood was boiling and that the Comet was telling the king, aack, aack [acometa, acometa] rather than predicting misfortune.”47 The play on words was allegedly used by Sebastian himself: “Using an ingenious paronomasia and a play on words, the never sufﬁciently mourned King don Sebastian replied to those who wished to divert him from his doomed objective by pointing to the always fatal comet and saying, with remarkable sharpness and wit, ‘No, you’ve misunderstood; the Comet is telling me to aack (acometa).’”48 When chronicler Fernando de Goes Loureiro wrote of the “horrifying and terrible Comet in the Sky,” it is striking to note that he placed the comet aer, not before, his account of Sebastian’s death, as if to make sense of chaos and tragedy. “There were many judgments and opinions,” he wrote, “and some said\n\nMorocco: King Sebastian\n\n17\n\nthe Comet surely announced the calamity and ruin which later befell the kingdom, yet it could not dissuade the unfortunate King Sebastian from his purpose and campaign, though the Heavens themselves warned of the sentence they had passed.”49 For Pero Roiz Soares, it was “the most terrifying comet ever seen.”50 Another of the clergymen present at the bale of Alcazarquivir, Fray Bernardo da Cruz, said in his 1586 account not only that the terrifying comet literally pointed to Africa, “where it promised to take eﬀect,” but also that many people in Penamacor (near the Spanish border) that same year saw armies of men in the sky.51 Ambassador Juan de Silva described the comet to the king’s secretary, Gabriel de Zayas, saying it was a “bright, shining star emiing so many rays and creating such a large ball that it was wondrous, growing every night and traveling toward the east. Some say it is not a comet,” he wrote. “I’m not an astrologer, nor do I believe in them.”52 It is worth noting that Philip II ordered a report on the comet to be wrien by the cosmographer Juan López de Velasco, who turned in a reasonable set of arguments proving, basically, that nobody really knew much about them. But López de Velasco was quite sure that there was no basis whatsoever to the theory that comets announced the death of princes and kings.53 At any rate, Sebastian did not let the comet get in the way of his plans. The restraining inﬂuence of Catherine disappeared in February 1578, when the weary former queen and regent died. (His mother, Juana, had died ﬁve years earlier at the age of thirty-eight; Uncle Henry still hovered in the background.) In March, Sebastian wrote to the Santa Cruz monastery in Coimbra for authorization to carry into bale the sword and shield of Afonso Henriques, Portugal’s ﬁrst king, whose twelh-century tomb was (and is) there. An eighteenth-century account describes the conditions under which these treasures were delivered to the king, but for unknown reasons they were, mercifully, not taken into bale.54 Military recruitment was slow and, as everywhere else in early modern Europe, a magnet for corruption. As Portuguese ambassadors were dispatched throughout Catholic Europe to collect commitments of men, munitions, and money, the streets of Lisbon became choked with soldiers and merchants, and the ceaseless drums were heard day and night. Even those\n\n18\n\nChapter 1\n\nwho were not going to war pretended they were, so as to please the king, and not for the last time in this tale, clothing became a way of identifying character and motive: “There was nobody who had not changed outﬁts; even the oldest ministers and most respected men of leers . . . who would wear long, honest, and authorized clothing, decent for their persons and dignity, now all wore short outﬁts . . . with medals and decorated feathers and many other mad and luxurious elegancies.”55 Philip II sent emissaries to Lisbon to reason with his nephew, who was increasingly resentful that he was not geing what he wanted. “He’s on ﬁre,” Philips’s ambassador Silva wrote, “and it is impossible to dissuade him.” Though Philip had instructed that he was not to even think about marching inland once he landed on the Moroccan coast, Silva learned that Sebastian was collecting what he described as portable trenches and tanklike vehicles obviously meant for the desert. In Silva’s opinion, the monarch was seeking as many diﬃculties and as much danger as possible; the appeal of the thing lay in its diﬃculty. When Sebastian asked Silva if Philip suspected he was planning to march inland, Silva replied (he told Philip) that Philip suspected nothing because a decision like that would be sheer madness. According to a May 13 leer, Sebastian’s closest friend, Cristóvão de Tavora, pleaded with Silva to ask Philip for more military aid, as it was clear there was no stopping Sebastian, and he could not go unprotected.56 Silva’s missives got more and more desperate: “the king is on ﬁre,” he repeated on at least four occasions in May. On June 8, a week before he was scheduled to embark, this supremely loyal and intelligent man wrote Secretary Zayas, “I am leaving for war, His Majesty’s ambassador, with no weapons and no tents. . . . I can only hope to die in the coming six days.57 The Moroccan ruler, Abd al-Malik, also begged Sebastian not to embark on the unwarranted venture, not only because it would endanger the fragile balance of power in the region but because the Portuguese would lose. Subsequent descriptions of Malik are universally positive, consistent with the Spanish tradition of admiring worthy enemies. The descriptions stand in contrast to those of Sebastian, for whom youthful, impetuous, and devout were the best adjectives writers could ﬁnd. Fray\n\nMorocco: King Sebastian\n\n19\n\nLuis Nieto, a Spanish mendicant preacher present at the bale of Alcazarquivir, wrote of Malik at length and, like Cervantes, he admired the Moroccan’s linguistic skills: He was a man of medium stature and good posture with a broad back; . . . he was as white as milk, with rosy cheeks and a stiﬀ beard, with large green eyes, and in all other ways he was a most aractive and gracious man. In addition, he was very strong and was continually skirmishing and working his horses hard and shooting arrows. He spoke our Spanish very well, and he wrote it. He also knew Italian and he spoke Turkish beer than any other language except his own, which was Arabic, in which he was an outstanding poet. He was extremely clever and very measured and discreet in all things, particularly regarding the government of his kingdoms. He played several instruments and danced with grace; he was very fond of weapons and strategy, and with his own hands fabricated some artillery pieces. In all pursuits he was gied, and though an inﬁdel, was so fond of Christians, and of Spaniards in particular, that I cannot praise him enough.58\n\nAn anonymous chronicler described him as “a strong man of medium stature with a broad forehead, large light-colored eyes, a round chubby face, a Roman nose, wide mouth, thick lips, narrow teeth, somewhat hunched, with skin the color of brown paper.”59 And a third described him as a man of “ordinary stature, well made and lean, . . . with a pleasant presence . . . and a serious yet happy appearance. He was a brave soldier.”60 Malik probably wrote three leers to Sebastian: one in late 1577, a second in April 1578, and a third in July, aer Sebastian arrived in Morocco.61 No originals survive. In his ﬁrst missive he patiently explained the succession rules in his country to demonstrate that he was the legitimate ruler of Morocco. “I oﬀer you this brief account because I know, as the soldier I once was, that before one aains kingdoms through arms, one must use reason,” he wrote. He asked Sebastian to send envoys so he could beer know the young king’s pretensions and could explain his own, and he warned him that Muhammed was unworthy of Sebas20\n\nChapter 1\n\ntian’s trust.62 The second leer arrived with a Captain Zúñiga, who had been captive in Morocco and was released as a messenger. Again Malik pointed to his legal right of succession, and again he requested that Sebastian send a negotiator.63 The third leer, the most widely circulated, judging by the number of copies remaining, was wrien just before the bale.64 “May one god be praised everywhere,” it began, signaling that both writer and recipient were followers of monotheistic creeds. Again he counseled Sebastian that his war was unjust, this time adding that if he really wanted to conquer land that was not his, he should do so alone and not in the company of Malik’s nephew, who was a dog, a pagan, and a traitor unworthy even of “the slave of my slaves.” Malik reminded Sebastian that Muhammed had slain previous emissaries from Portugal and was promising what he could not deliver. Malik, on the other hand, could deliver, and he promised Sebastian land for tillage beyond Portugal’s fortresses, a valuable oﬀer that would alleviate the garrisons’ isolation. “They tell me that you are bringing [Charles V’s] banner with you and that you plan to crown yourself emperor of my kingdom,” he wrote, well-informed as always. (Muhammed had promised to make Sebastian emperor in return for his help.) “I don’t know who is deceiving you, for I want only your friendship and neighborliness. Let us meet in a place where you are safe, and you can give me your banner, and I promise I will ﬂy it from the highest walls of my cities to conﬁrm you are emperor, as they say you wish to be; anything to avoid your perdition, which otherwise is certain.” Think of how many soldiers are needed to expel someone from his own home, Malik wrote, and how much advantage natives always have over invaders. “You do not bring one-tenth the number of men I have, and I am warning you in good time. May God be my witness and judge, for He helps those who have justice on their side.” Finally, he wrote, “you come in search of me with no right and you want to wage an unjust war against me, which neither serves nor pleases God. Know that this will cost more lives than grains of mustard can ﬁll a sack. You are young and inexperienced and ill-advised.” Sebastian’s ﬂeet—between ﬁve hundred and eight hundred ships— le Lisbon on July 8, 1578, aer nearly two weeks in the city’s wide-open port awaiting favorable winds. (The Tagus was “curdled” with ships, one Morocco: King Sebastian\n\n21\n\nobserver said.65) Behind him the king le three men in charge of his government “during my brief absence.”66 According to Nieto, the king took with him fourteen thousand foot soldiers (of whom eight thousand carried picks, “the most useless weapon one could have in Berberia”), two thousand cavalrymen, three thousand former prisoners, one thousand drivers, and an “inﬁnite number” of servants. All told, twenty-six thousand souls. The soldiers included three thousand Germans, three hundred Italians under the command of the Englishman Thomas Stukeley, and two thousand Spaniards (fewer than Philip had promised).67 There were also two thousand ﬁve hundred “adventurers,” gentlemen who paid their own way and served under Cristóvão de Tavora. Along with them went wagons, coaches, weaponry, and hundreds of horses and livestock. Juan de Silva calculated that there was enough equipment for an army ﬁve times its size; a Portuguese chronicler who survived the bale estimated that there were forty thousand people, most of them “of no use whatsoever for the purposes of warfare.”68 Unlike in other wars, one observer noted, men boarded the ships unsmiling, grim-faced. “As if they could see the coming disaster, they ached at being taken against their will. In the port there was a leaden silence, and in all the time the great number of ships were being readied, not once was a ﬁfe or a trumpet heard.”69 And the signs kept coming, even as the ships pulled out of “Ulysses’s famous harbor,” a reference to Lisbon’s alleged founder.70 The royal ship, as it turned toward the sea, was caught by a current and its prow smashed up against another ship, causing an artillery piece to ﬁre, killing a sailor. Another lesser mishap, widely commented on, occurred when a churchman aempted to aach the expedition’s ﬂag onto a mast and the ﬂag was upside down, with the image of the cruciﬁed Christ and the royal coat of arms facing downward. Following that, a lieutenant stumbled twice, and the ﬂag was dropped altogether. Once they were ﬁnally on their way, Sebastian asked a musician, Domingos Madeira, to sing, and he obliged: “Yesterday you were king of Hispania, today you have no castle,” warbled the apparently clueless man, singing a tune commemorating Rodrigo, the last of the Spanish Visigothic kings, whose defeat by the Moors ushered in eight hundred years of Muslim occupation. As everyone knew, Rodrigo’s body was never recovered from the bale of Guadalete, though 22\n\nChapter 1\n\nsome said he managed to escape.71 For Conestaggio, “The King of Portugal’s departure from Lisbon was so mournful that it gave apparent signs of evil success.”72 But there was an immediate precedent for bad omens ending with a glorious voyage: in The Lusiads, which Sebastian’s chroniclers were sure to have read, the Portuguese captain recounts his ﬂeet’s solemn departure from Lisbon, where “The people considered us already lost / On so long and uncertain a journey.” In one of the most moving and puzzling episodes of the epic, an “honorable” old man in the port delivers a remarkable ten-verse rant on vanity and hubris just as the ships are setting oﬀ, undermining the imperialist thrust of the entire poem: ‘To what new catastrophes do you plan To drag this kingdom and these people? What perils, what deaths have you in store Under what magniloquent title? What visions of kingdoms and gold-mines Will you guide them to infallibly? What fame do you promise them? What stories? What conquests and processions? What glories?’73\n\n“Here Died the King Who Killed Himself . . .”\n\nAer several stops and delays along the way, the ﬂeet arrived at Asilah in mid-July, as disorderly at sea as it had been in port, according to Juan de Silva, who continued writing leers as he sailed. “The Moors played with us and captured a couple of ships at the back with thirty or forty men on board,” the ambassador reported from Cádiz, “and what seems most incredible, the king [Sebastian] is moored in an open bay with no protection from the sea.” The ﬂeet was sailing in bits and pieces as it moved southward at the mercy of the winds. 74 Sebastian’s forces were joined by some two thousand men loyal to (or at least in the employ of) Muhammed, the dethroned sharif. Sebastian’s aides, allegedly among them Afonso de Portugal, count of Vimioso, insisted the army should sail down the Atlantic coast twenty miles to the fort of Larache, the recovery of which was, in theory, the point of the expedition (and one of Philip II’s condiMorocco: King Sebastian\n\n23\n\ntions), and engage the enemy there.75 Sebastian, as Silva had suspected he would, instead decided to march inland through the desert from Asilah toward Alcazarquivir (al-Qasr al-Kabir), a town of several thousand inhabitants around twenty-ﬁve miles away, and there turn northwest back to the coast and to Larache. Spies reported that Malik was massing tens of thousands of well-armed men; Sebastian decided the information was false.76 Malik, who, in Conestaggio’s words, weighed “how much better an ill peace is [than] a just war,” sent his last leer, which, as we saw, was rejected. (An anonymous correspondent said of Malik’s oﬀer quite remarkably that “the Moor justiﬁed himself like a Christian and the King responded like a Moor.”)77 One of Conestaggio’s critics, the Spanish cleric Sebastián de Mesa, in terms similar to Conestaggio’s, lamented that the “energetic king [Sebastian] did not see how certain peace is worth more than a doubtful victory.”78 Silva, of course, knew all of this. He wrote to the king from Asilah, “I just learned that the sharif himself has asked [Sebastian] to stay put . . . which had absolutely no eﬀect. Thus we set oﬀ, so lacking in every way that soldiers from Andalucia were just sent home because they have no weapons. . . . No other nation would go so cheerfully in search of danger.”79 On July 29, the overland expedition that Silva so feared began. In the blazing summer heat, the Portuguese forces plodded through the desert. By the fourth day, exhausted under the weight of their body armor, they had consumed most of their food and water. Confronted with the now indisputable fact that Malik’s army indeed vastly outnumbered their own and was gathered just ahead, the royal councilors fruitlessly beseeched Sebastian to withdraw. As they awaited action, Sebastian’s men were hungry, thirsty, unruly, and terriﬁed they were about to be massacred.80 Two days later, aer the troops had marched a few more miles, the captain and poet Francisco Aldana appeared with ﬁve hundred reinforcements and yet another leer, this one from the duke of Alba, whose great military prowess Sebastian must have admired. Aldana also brought a precious gi, the helmet and silk tunic of Charles V, Sebastian’s grandfather who, as Malik knew, Sebastian wished to emulate. (Camões had wrien that Sebastian’s two grandfathers, Charles and João III, “both look to see resurrected in you / their times and heroic works.”81) “May God grant you 24\n\nChapter 1\n\nFigure 5. Present-day Asilah, on the Moroccan coast. Photograph by Mari MacKay-Seon.\n\nsuccess in your campaign and a safe return,” Alba wrote, though adding, “It appears you went to Africa without informing me.” This was the last warning Sebastian would receive. The famed military hero oﬀered some tactical advice and a reminder that “you take the enemy with you, for Africa is a ﬂatland, not good for positions.”82 Indeed, spies by then were Morocco: King Sebastian\n\n25\n\ninforming Malik of his adversary’s inadequacies and inferiority and, as one chronicler put it, “the Moors began to lose their fear.”83 On the night of August 3, the hungry soldiers clamored for food, having consumed eight days’ rations in four, and Sebastian responded to their entreaties by ordering that an ox be slaughtered and biscuit distributed.84 The following morning, August 4, camped near the conﬂuence of two rivers north of Alcazarquivir, the Christian forces confessed their sins and heard exhortations to die for the faith. The royal aides, having spoken their ﬁnal words of advice, had nothing le to say. Sebastian’s last speech was recorded in the chronicles in accordance with the classical norms of antebellum oration: I can only say how happy you should be on this occasion, for today we commence that just and holy undertaking so desired by all, entrusted to us and longed for by my ancestors. You well know the hourly aﬀronts to Christianity in this land of the inﬁdel, by an enemy so near to us he is practically a thief in our own house, and well you know the danger posed by the men whom [Malik] brought here upon the Turk’s orders. . . . I believe you and everyone else knows that the holy Catholic faith, the protection of the faithful, and the clemency owed to the suﬀering all oblige me to undertake this mission. I hope God helps me, and I am sure that you all will be with me . . . because Christ’s soldiers, when they have suﬃcient faith, are lords of the baleﬁeld.” The speech closed with an Ave Maria led by Father Alexander of the Company of Jesus.85\n\nAt noon the ﬁrst cannon shot was ﬁred. According to Nieto, one of the bale’s ﬁrst eyewitness chroniclers, the sound of all the gunﬁre going oﬀ at once, “with such strange fury and such horror and fright, made it truly seem that the earth, with enormous rumbling, and the sky, with ﬁre and thunder and the roar of the artillery, all wanted to sink inwards.”86 The Christian forces ﬂed in terror, prompting an alarmed Aldana to tell Sebastian that his forces were young and inexperienced and needed someone to rein them in and remind them of who they were. “And thus the King rode among his men calling to them, ‘My Portuguese, such a small event has provoked such a large show of fear? This is not how wars were 26\n\nChapter 1\n\nwon by those Portuguese who came before you, whose honor and bravery is known the world over.’”87 But in a “blink of an eye” it was over.88 The Moors—actually Arabs, Berbers, Turks, and renegades (former Christians)—at ﬁrst appeared to break ranks and withdraw, but it was merely an astute tactic by Malik. It was his last. He had been gravely ill for at least a month, possibly the eﬀect of poison, and in the chaos of the bale, he collapsed and died, though his death was kept secret until the end of the bale.89 His forces returned, and the Christians, quickly surrounded, ran out of ammunition and were so crowded that many trampled or stabbed each other. Nieto and other Spanish writers reported that Portuguese noblemen dismounted and hid under their wagons and then broke and ﬂed for the coast to escape death, the dust, and the insuﬀerable heat. In just four hours, anywhere from three thousand to eight thousand Moroccan combatants were slain, along with twelve thousand Portuguese forces, including the cream of the Portuguese nobility. The captive commoners mostly ended up as slaves, to be dispersed throughout the Magreb, many for the rest of their lives. The nobles—among them Juan de Silva (who was badly wounded) and don António, prior of Crato, one-time governor of Tangiers and future claimant to the Portuguese throne—eventually were ransomed, making Ahmad al-Mansur, who succeeded his brother Malik, a wealthy and powerful man. Ahmad secured Moroccan independence and remained a close friend of England until his death in 1603. Sebastian may have been unstable and a terrible commander, but it appears he was not a coward and was determined to be the last man standing. Suitably, false news and misread signs led to his death, which became a set piece for chroniclers. Surrounded by chaos and death, the young and reckless king galloped round and round, taking on one attacker aer the next. His standard bearer, at some point aware that a number of Moors were heading their way, alerted his lord, who replied that there were fewer enemies than it seemed. The bearer was immediately killed, aer which the Portuguese forces had no means of following the king, leaving him “as a man lost,” in Conestaggio’s words. “All the Portuguese were surrounded by an inﬁnite number of Moors, and so they lost sight of the king, deceived by those who said they had seen him Morocco: King Sebastian\n\n27\n\nelsewhere.” Some said the Portuguese army believed Sebastian had been taken prisoner or was in another part of the baleﬁeld, so no one bothered to protect him. The Moors may also have thought he had been taken or killed. (So Sebastian was alive and his enemies thought he was dead; Malik was dead, and his enemies thought he was alive.) Fray Antonio San Román wrote that Christian soldiers were mistakenly following the standard of don Duarte de Meneses. Round and round Sebastian went, covered with dust and dirt. His horse was shot from under him, and one of his men oﬀered him his. The king rode oﬀ again, promising that the man would be recompensed, and again his horse was shot. Most chronicles and ﬁctional accounts said three horses were killed from under him. The correspondent in Lisbon of the great Fugger banking dynasty, writing a few weeks later, was one of those who counted three horses, and he added a story that appears nowhere else, that the Turks mistook the son of the duke of Braganza, inexplicably driving a gilt coach in the midst of the bale, for Sebastian, and the man escaped death only by promising them a huge ransom.90 Fighting like a lion, Sebastian went on and on, and suddenly the Moors realized who he was, “and for every Christian there were three hundred Moors.” Sebastian was down to just four aides surrounding him, among them Tavora. “My Lord, what can we do?” Tavora asked his best friend. “What Heaven wills, if we are deserving,” and with that, sword in hand, he threw himself back at the Moors, ignoring Tavora’s pleas. Then the king (or Tavora, or another soldier; all versions exist) “put a handkerchief on the point of his sword as a sign of peace, and he rode toward the Moors like an ambassador, but the barbarians captured him and don Cristóbal.” Tavora was killed immediately. The count of Vimioso also went down. No surviving member of the Portuguese army witnessed the king’s death. Malik’s men squabbled for a few minutes over who should kill him, an honor they ended up sharing. According to Nieto, they were not Berbers but Arabs, who did not properly understand the sign of peace.91 “Do not trust anyone who says they saw things that day and wants to tell the story, . . . because it was a bolt of wrath from God that blinded us all.”92 The bolt of wrath spelled the end of Portuguese independence: “Oh unhappy patria! O unfortunate king of lamentable memory! For when 28\n\nChapter 1\n\nyour Empire and your name were most widely known in the world and your virtue oﬀered the greatest hopes, you launched this insane adventure, scene of such tragic tales in which all the world’s evils conspired against your Kingdoms. Here died the King who killed himself, his own hangman, his vassals’ own dagger.”93 Here died the king, but here too were born myths that arose from older myths and memories. If such a thing as Alcazarquivir could be true, then anything could be true. Two days aer the bale, the new sharif told Sebastian’s servant Sebastián de Resende that he could win his freedom by identifying the royal cadaver, certainly an incentive (it was said) to point out the ﬁrst plausible candidate among the thousands of decomposing bodies and body parts piled and scaered on the baleﬁeld. The remains he chose had been stripped of clothing.94 Like Christ’s body, this one bore ﬁve gashes (though not from arrows, like those suﬀered by Sebastian’s beloved and martyred namesake). There were also two musket wounds in the torso. The corpse was carried to a tent, now the resting place of three dead kings: Malik, Sebastian, and Muhammed, who drowned in a river as he was trying to escape. “This was the most sorrowful spectacle ever seen, enough to make even the most hard-hearted burst into tears, to see three Kings, so powerful, all dead in bale,” Nieto wrote.95 Malik was buried in great triumph. Sebastian again was identiﬁed by a group of captive comrades, this time led by Duarte de Meneses, who “carefully viewed” the body, in Conestaggio’s words. Sebastianistas later would say that a pale, badly decomposed, nude body with no royal insignia or accessory could easily have belonged to a Swiss, Flemish, or German soldier in the Portuguese army. The Portuguese oﬀered Morocco’s new ruler, Ahmad, ten thousand ducats for the body, an oﬀer he found insulting. Rather, he suggested, he would like Asilah, Ceuta, Mazagan, and Tangiers to be returned. As that was not possible, Sebastian was buried with honors in Alcazarquivir on August 7. Yet again, two countrymen were called upon to recognize the body, but by then it was so badly decomposed that it was completely unrecognizable. Philip II later that year called upon the services of Andrea Gasparo Corso to help transport Sebastian’s body to Ceuta. One of ﬁve Corsican brothers who worked throughout the Christian and Muslim MediterraMorocco: King Sebastian\n\n29\n\nnean as merchants, agents, and middlemen, Andrea managed the family’s Algiers oﬃce. Not surprisingly, he also worked for Malik (and knew Cervantes), and immediately aer the bale he began helping Philip with the ransom eﬀort. Sebastian’s body was disinterred in Alcazarquivir, and was buried on December 4 in the Trinitarian church, in Ceuta. One of the witnesses at the disinterment was Juan de Silva, who lost the use of one arm on account of his wounds. The new Moroccan ruler had ordered Silva’s release almost immediately, but he remained in North Africa under medical supervision until late December. “I pray God punishes that young and proud king, as his uncle and those who loved him told him He would,” Silva wrote secretary Zayas.96 As for the third king, Muhammed, his body was ﬂayed, salted, stuﬀed, and displayed throughout the kingdom that he had betrayed and lost. He le a son, whom we will meet again. The great Portuguese poet Camões died two years later, on June 10, 1580, just before his country fell to Spain. The heroic age of his epic had ended long before he began writing it. “Thus was the end of this unfortunate prince in whom were found all things to make his death lamentable: youth, a quest for virtue, lack of succession, a violent death, and his body imprisoned. He had excellent qualities, but they did not help him. . . . But the intentions impelling him toward this reckless end were those of generosity, magnanimity, religious piety, a desire for military glory, gallantry, and a strong heart. It is not unlike what was said of Alexander: he had the virtues of nature and the vices of fortune . . .”97 This great tragedy, the chasm between what was and what might have been, evokes what Paul Fussell called “ironyassisted recall,” referring to the recollections and memories of World War I and the belle époque that preceded it. Even though the laer war was ultimately won by the Allies, participants, as if recounting a defeat, oen returned to those points at which things could have been done differently. Such was the case with Alcazarquivir, momentous and unthinkable but also entirely predictable: If only Sebastian had listened; if only we had heeded the omens. The contrast between the glorious optimism and the senseless slaughter, the long build-up and the sudden defeat, the moral certainty of victory and the physical certainty of catastrophe, was all too much to bear.98 30\n\nChapter 1\n\nTroy Mourns\n\nThe news could not be believed. At the same time, stories that could not possibly be true were taken as fact. Novedades, one way of saying “news” in Spanish (it also means “novelties”), were never a good thing. No less an authority than Covarrubias, author of the ﬁrst Spanish dictionary, said novedades were new, unaccustomed things, “usually dangerous, for they signify changing old ways.”99 On August 8 a Portuguese agent in Puerto de Santa María, near Cádiz, heard from Ceuta that Sebastian had been defeated but perhaps was taken captive.100 Rumors of the disaster reached the courts of Lisbon and Madrid on August 10 (six days aer the event) and quickly spread through the peninsula. Philip II, who was in his palace in El Escorial, in the mountains outside Madrid, learned the news late on the night of August 12; he immediately prayed in his chapel and then went to bed but could not sleep, and the following day more messages arrived saying Sebastian had been captured alive. Subsequent leers reconﬁrmed the young king’s death, but doubts lingered in Philip’s mind until probably August 18.101 In Lisbon, meanwhile, what was le of the Portuguese authorities scrambled to manage the story. Fearing trouble [novedad], the governors said only that there had been a bale, but people guessed the bad news. . . . It was impossible to cover up something of this import, because the news had already arrived, and people saw the governors’ sad faces and knew there were meetings every day. Mail was halted, and outsiders were not allowed anywhere, and all the roads and entrances to Lisbon were guarded. . . . The entire city was ﬁlled with fear; the men were yellow, sad, confused, some struck dumb, and they did not know what to say or what to imagine, each one providing his own version of these events as it seemed to him, huddling in groups . . . [and speaking of] the bad signs that had been there from the very beginning.102\n\nFrom the very start, then, the circulation and control of news was a crucial component of this story. The sixty-six-year-old Cardinal Henry, Morocco: King Sebastian\n\n31\n\nnow apparently the next king, stayed in Alcobaça, north of Lisbon, and awaited conﬁrmation. According to Diogo Barbosa Machado, Henry was one of many people (St. Teresa supposedly was another) who had visions on August 4; he saw the bishop of Coimbra, don Manoel de Meneses, lying in a pool of blood.103 Meanwhile, on August 18, a Vatican oﬃcial in Lisbon, Roberto Fontana, wrote to Rome that he had received word that Sebastian, along with don António and the duke of Aveiro, were all safe. The following day another interlocutor told Rome that Sebastian was probably dead.104 On August 24 at last it became oﬃcial. Church bells in Lisbon tolled all day. “The city has become Troy, burning amid wails, noble tears and illustrious sighs, while the common people are beside themselves with pain and sorrow.”105 The cruel death of a young monarch and the loss of Portugal’s national sovereignty was punishment far exceeding the crime of hubris. At once, the city exploded in shouts and wails, tears and mourning, not only in Lisbon but throughout the kingdom; . . . some lost their fathers and others their husbands and others their sons and brothers . . . In the streets and in houses one heard nothing but sobbing. . . . For many days, the women did not want to believe that their husbands and King Sebastian were dead, and throughout the kingdom it was believed that he would appear and that the body they said was the king’s was actually a German’s, but as time went by they realized this was ignorance.106\n\nThis was not the only writer to point to women and the lower classes as the origin of foolish and desperate beliefs. Even illustrious women were taking “new license” in their sorrow and their prayers, the author of the anonymous “Los ytenes de Portugal” wrote. “There is no devotion they will not practice, no witchcra they will not believe, no holy women who will not rob them with their superstitions, and the worst part is that they have become so restless and troublesome that if their husbands, wherever they are, knew about this, they would choose to remain captives.” In Conestaggio’s account,\n\n32\n\nChapter 1\n\nIt was a pitiful thing to hear the women (whereof the most noble in their houses) from whence you might hear the noise, and the rest in the streets, powering forth their cries and tears unto heaven, the which they redoubled so oen as the news was conﬁrmed by any new advertisement. And as it oen happens that minds suppressed do oentimes turn to superstition, so they and likewise many men did not believe what was said, but hoping beyond all hope, and trusting more than they should (although it were veriﬁed unto them that their husbands and kinsfolk were dead, yet would they have them still living) and deceived by sorcerers and witches, but most of all by their own desires, remained long without their widows habit, expecting in vain news of him which was passed into another life.107\n\nNews traveled quickly. In Avila, the future St. Teresa wrote just two weeks aer the catastrophe, “I grieve for the death of such a Catholic king and am angry at those who let him place himself in such great danger,” showing she knew about the bale but not its political prelude.108 A Fugger agent informed his masters in Augsburg of the calamity: “The men went about as if dazed. The wailing of the women was so loud that it can be compared with that which arose at the taking of Antwerp. It is a woeful maer to lose in one day the King, their husbands, their sons, and all the goods and chaels they had with them.” But, he added, assuming a more practical tone, “what is even more terrible is that this kingdom now must fall under Spanish rule, which they can brook the least of all.”109 The Portuguese incredulity, at least as it was depicted in chronicles, had historical precedent. When the Athenians ﬁrst heard their army had been vanquished in Sicily, they too, according to Thucydides, refused to believe the accounts of soldiers who had escaped. Later, “they turned against the public speakers who had been in favor of the expedition, as though they themselves had not voted for it, and also became angry with the prophets and soothsayers” who had promised victory.110 Plutarch, in Nicias and also in “On Talkativeness” in the Moralia, recounted a tale (“it is said . . .”) in which the Sicilian news ﬁrst arrived from a stranger who sat down in a barber’s chair and began speaking of the defeat, assuming it was not news at all. The horriﬁed barber ran out of his shop and began\n\nMorocco: King Sebastian\n\n33\n\nbroadcasting the story, whereupon the unlucky stranger was ordered to explain his sources. “And he, giving no satisfactory account, was taken for a spreader of false intelligence and a disturber of the city, and was, therefore, fastened to the wheel and racked a long time, till other messengers arrived that related the whole disaster particularly.”111 In a similar case, Venice received word of the fall of Negroponte on July 31, 1470, when a shipwrecked sailor arrived in the city with a bundle of rain-soaked leers describing celebratory bonﬁres along the Turkish coast. At ﬁrst, people were just puzzled, and uncertainty reigned, but soon more reports arrived, and there were church bells, lamentations, and processions to allay fears, as there would be in Lisbon a century later. “And then murmurs were heard that Negroponte had been lost. The news spread throughout the country. It is impossible to describe how terrible were the groans and sighs,” which got only worse once survivors trickled back, each with his own terrible account.112 If Sebastian’s body was buried multiple times, the slain king also had several funerals. At 6 a.m. on August 27, a Wednesday, Lisbon’s city councilors and other oﬃcials, dressed in mourning, walked solemnly from the town hall to the steps of the cathedral accompanied by a horseback rider dragging behind him a large black ﬂag. Among the oﬃcial mourners were three old judges, each holding a shield high above his head. When they reached the church, one of the judges walked up the steps and turned to the crowd as a municipal notary cried out, “Weep sires, weep citizens, weep people for your king don Sebastian. . . . Weep for his youth cut short, for he died in the war against the Moors in the service of God and for the good of his kingdom.” Then the judge put the shield on the ground and broke it into bits. All the men, accompanied by crowds, then walked behind the horseman dragging the black ﬂag until they reached the Rua Nova, where again the convocation was uered and another shield was broken in front of Our Lady of Oliveira. The ceremony was repeated a third time in front of the royal hospital, aer which the procession returned to the church and heard a funeral Mass probably delivered by the great Jesuit preacher Luís Alvares.113 The day aer the shields were broken, Henry was crowned. Sebastian’s second funeral was in the grand Hieronymite church of 34\n\nChapter 1\n\nBelém on September 19 or 20, an occasion of great pomp presided over by the new, elderly king. Historians disagree on who delivered the funeral Mass. The confusion is the result of statements by Fray Miguel de los Santos years later when he was under arrest for masterminding the imposture, and of semiﬁctional works by Camilo Castelo Branco in the nineteenth century. Fray Miguel, who at the time of Alcazarquivir was provincial (chief of a religious order in a province) of the Augustinian order, told the judge in the Madrigal case that it was he who preached in Belém, and most chroniclers follow this version. Before speaking, he said, he had been warned by someone to be careful because Sebastian himself was in the church and would be listening. One account has Fray Miguel scurrying oﬀ to ask Henry what to do—was it really a funeral Mass he was delivering?—and the king allegedly told him to go ahead and preach.114 But historians generally believe the funeral Masses were presided over by Luís Alvares, not Fray Miguel.115 The story might have read beer had it been Fray Miguel, but Alvares certainly knew how to orate. It was hubris that had led Portugal down this path ending in three hours of butchery, he admonished his listeners. It was the end of “so many dreams of so many men of so many estates of so many oﬃces of so many sacriﬁces, . . . the end of so much madness, such lying, such pride and such arrogance, such hope and so much nothing.” Damn you, he told the people crowding the enormous church, for it was they who had squandered Portugal’s fortune. “You killed the bishop, you killed the cleric. . . . You killed the grandee, you killed the commoner, you killed the people, you killed them all, we all killed them.” It was only just that they suﬀer so enormously for their sins, he said, and the worst was not over, for “God has the custom of announcing a great evil by sending lesser ones.” This was the lesser one; the next, he implied, would come from Spain. The third funeral was in late 1582, also in Belém, and this time, ﬁnally, there was a body. Philip II, by then king of Portugal and preparing his return to Spain, ordered that his nephew be disinterred in Ceuta and transported home, among other reasons to make it clear that he was dead, very dead. (In similar fashion, aer stories that Richard II of England had not really died in 1400, his successor, Henry IV, organized a procession throughout the country displaying the body, including the Morocco: King Sebastian\n\n35\n\nking’s face.)116 The procession carrying the body (or, as one writer put it, “the body said to be that of King don Sebastian”) stopped on its way north from the Algarve at Evora, where two of Sebastian’s ancestors were disinterred in order to join him in Lisbon. Philip ordered that a total of twenty bodies of fathers, sons, and grandsons of King Manuel I be gathered up from around the kingdom, and they (including Cardinal Henry) were all reburied with “sumptuous ceremony and great spectacle” in the royal necropolis of Belém.117And still there was one more move. Aer Portugal regained its independence from Spain in the late seventeenth century, King Pedro II in 1682 ordered that Sebastian’s remains be transferred to a monumental tomb in the same church, and there they still reside. Vasco de Gama’s and Camões’s tombs ﬂank the entrance to the church, and at the far end of the nave the royals surround the high altar. Catherine and Henry are both there, and so, too, is Sebastian, though with a caveat. The inscription on his tomb reads as follows: Conditur hoc tumulo si vera est fama Sebastião quem tulit in Libicis mors properata plagis Nec dicas falli regem qui vivere credit Pro lege extincto mors quasi vita fuit.\n\nIn this tomb, if rumor be true, lies Sebastian, Whom untimely death carried away on the Libyan plains. Do not say that those who believe the king lives are deceived, For according to law, death is like life for he who has been killed.\n\nThe King’s Miraculous Survival\n\nAlready on August 13, a Spanish notary in Ceuta had informed Philip II that former comrades (in particular the Alencastros, or Lancasters) were saying Sebastian had escaped on horseback and ridden toward Asilah.118 Immediately the king dispatched Cristóbal de Moura to Lisbon. Like Juan de Silva, whom he essentially replaced as ambassador at this time, Moura was the product of a Spanish-Portuguese noble family; he had been sent to Spain as a teenager with Sebastian’s mother, Juana, when she moved 36\n\nChapter 1\n\nto Spain in 1554 and was used as an envoy during the marriage negotiations and as a translator at the Guadalupe talks. Now back in Lisbon in those spooky days aer the bale, in which he lost a brother, he wrote to Philip, “There are so many diﬀerent and diverse opinions, with honest men aﬃrming that the king is alive and in this kingdom, saying they had witnesses. And though it is usual for commoners [el vulgo] to believe such things, in this province [Portugal] it is more common than anywhere else in the world.”119 Even Henry was said to have his doubts. As ransomed men began returning from Morocco to Lisbon like laer-day Lazaruses, each carrying his own rumors, miracles seemed possible. “Ignorant people believe he is alive and hidden,” according to one account, and that was exactly what Fray Miguel de los Santos had in mind.120 As long as there was no body, there was hope. Enter Rumor, painted full of tongues. The trouble apparently began in Asilah, though if it had not started there it would have started elsewhere. The night aer the bale, three or four Portuguese men approached the coastal fortress town (today an artsy getaway destination) demanding to be let in. When those inside proved reluctant to open the gates, the visitors said they had escaped from the bale and had Sebastian with them. The gates were immediately opened. One of the men, apparently wounded and partially hidden beneath a large cape, was the object of enormous deference by his comrades, who accompanied him to a dwelling in the walled city. News of the miraculous appearance reached the city’s governor, Diogo da Fonseca, who demanded to see the wounded man, who turned out not to be the king at all. It was all an unfortunate misunderstanding, the young man explained to Fonseca, as he and his friends merely meant to say they had arrived from the king’s army, not that the king was with them. Fonseca angrily ordered the men on board the next ship home, which turned out to be a mistake, because by the time the San Martinho docked in Portugal, the story had a life of its own “among the ignorant and the malicious.” Though Fonseca obtained wrien testimony by the witnesses who identiﬁed Sebastian’s body, which he then gave to Henry when he arrived home (Henry may have organized the second funeral precisely to make plain that Sebastian was dead), the stories of the laer-day Rodrigo spread, “partly because people wished these false imaginings to be Morocco: King Sebastian\n\n37\n\ntrue, because desire, when unregulated by reason, imagines that even impossible causes are probable; and partly because those who supported don António’s uprising wanted there to be disquiet and unrest.”121 The circumstances of the identiﬁcation of Sebastian’s body aer the bale were sketchy enough to inspire all manner of survival epics, particularly given that public statements were prohibited, leaving gossip and leers as the only source of news. A man soon appeared in Lisbon saying he had oﬀered something to d"
