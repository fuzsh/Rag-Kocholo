        "text": "Biographical Dictionary\n\nPope Alexander VI (1492-1503)\n\nConsistory of March 20, 1500 (VIII)\n\n(22) 1. HURTADO DE MENDOZA Y QUIÑONES, Diego (1444-1502)\n\nBirth. 1444, Guadalajara, Spain. Son of Íñigo López de Mendoza, first count of Tendilla, and Elvira de Quiñones. He was destined by his parents to the church. Nephew of Cardinal Pedro González de Mendoza (1473), the Grand Cardinal of Spain, who was his lifelong protector and benefactor. Other cardinals of the family were Francisco Mendoza de Bobadilla (1544); and Íñigo López de Mendoza y Zúñiga (1530). He was called the Cardinal of Spain and the Cardinal of Sevilla.\n\nEducation. When he was still a child, he was sent to Calahorra to the house of his uncle the future cardinal, who was his tireless protector. Studied in Salamanca (no further educational information found).\n\nEarly life. While he was studying in Salamanca, he had a relationship with María de Quiñones, \"la blanca\", with whom he had a son, Francisco Hurtado de Mendoza, and a daughter, Juana de Mendoza; he had not yet received the sacred orders. In 1460, he accompanied his father in an embassy to the court of Pope Pius II, who was then residing in Siena; later, he went to Rome, where he stayed for several years studying the culture of the Renaissance; after he returned to Spain, he lived almost continuously in the house of his uncle, following him everywhere he went, even after having been named count of Pernia, and serving him with the utmost fidelity. Named by his uncle dean of the cathedral chapter of Sigüenza. Promoted to the episcopate at the request of his uncle.\n\nPriesthood. Ordained (no further information found).\n\nEpiscopate. Elected bishop of Palencia (1), February 13, 1470; the old struggles concerning the lordship of the city were reignited with even more passion and the bishop was expelled from the city and many members of his household were killed; Pope Sixtus IV sent a severe monitory letter and the Spanish monarchs placed a corregidor, instead of the ordinary mayor of the city, named by the bishop; at his instance, the pope erected in the cathedral the dignity of abbot of San Salvador de Campo de Muga. Consecrated (no further information found). He participated in the principal activities of the Spanish royal family as a member of the entourage of his uncle the cardinal. He accompanied the Spanish monarchs when their son took the oath as heir of the crown in the cathedral of Toledo in May 1481. In the Winter of 1482 to 1483, a papal nuncio arrived in Spain with the bull for the crusade of reconquest of the Kingdom of Granada from the Moors; he was received the monarchs in Santo Domingo el Real de Madrid with a procession in which González de Mendoza and his inseparable nephew, Diego, took part together with other prelates. Promoted to the metropolitan see of Sevilla, August 26, 1485 (2); occupied the see until his death. On May 2, 1486, he went to Granada to receive the monarchs; remained in the court for almost two months and then returned to Sevilla. In the successive military campaigns fought by the Spanish monarchs, crowned with the occupation of Granada, the archbishop's troops joined the ones financed by his uncle the cardinal; the troops participated in the conquest of Vélez-Málaga in 1487; Málaga in also 1487; and Baeza in 1489; the following year, 1490, the archbishop and his men took part in the cutting of the trees in the fields next to the city of Granada; he not only offered his military support but also helped in the administrative functions of the conquest; he shared the triumph with the monarchs entering Granada on January 2, 1492. In 1490, he celebrated a provincial council; anticipating himself to the Council of Trent, he ordered that all parishes kept a baptismal registry. In May 1494, he was in Guadalajara helping his uncle, who was ill, arrange his affairs; he remained with the cardinal until his death occurred on January 11, 1495; he presided over the funeral and burial in Toledo; he also executed the will of the late cardinal and had a disagreement with the new archbishop of Toledo, Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros, O.F.M.Obs., over the place of burial in the major chapel, which the late cardinal had enlarged and remodeled; Archbishop Hurtado tried to obtain the see of Toledo for himself but when he learned that the monarchs had designated Jiménez de Cisneros as the new archbishop, he resented him, ignoring that Jiménez de Cisneros had recommended with great interest to the queen the appointment of the archbishop of Sevilla instead of his own. In 1496, Hernando Alonso de Herrera, humanist and professor of rhetoric and grammar, dedicated to him his work, published in Sevilla, Tres personæ: brevis quaedam disputatio de personis nominum, pronominum et participorum adversus Priscianum grammaticum. In 1497, he accompanied the king and Prince Juan to Santander to received Princess Margarita of Austria, the fiancee of the latter; he blessed their union in Burgos and then celebrated the mass of velaciones; in April 1498, he attended the Cortes of Toledo, where the princes took the oath. In 1500, he accompanied the monarchs, who went to dominate the rebellion of Alpujarras; he took Princess María to the border with Portugal, where she was going to become the new queen; there he learned that he had been elevated to the cardinalate; the Spanish monarchs asked that he be known as the Cardinal of Spain, like his uncle.\n\nCardinalate.

Sabina, October 5, 1500; at the same time, he was named titular Latin patriarch of Alexandria, see that he occupied until his death. In 1501, he presided, in the name of the monarchs, the Cortes of Sevilla; he and the suffragan bishops sent several priests to Granada to instruct the rebellious Moors; several of the priests were martyred. On October 15, 1501, he finished the document of erection and endowment of all the churches, collegiate and parochial of the city and diocese of Granada, which Pope Innocent VIII had charged him with fifteen years earlier. At the beginning of 1502, he donated several jewels to the cathedral of Sevilla. Later, he went to Toledo for the taking of the oath Doña Juana and Felipe el Hermoso as prince heirs of Castilla and Aragón. On his return he stopped in Tendilla and then continued traveling to Madrid, where he died.\n\nDeath. October 14, 1502 (4), Madrid (5). His remains were transferred to Sevilla in 1504 and buried in the chapel of S. Maria la Antigua, in the metropolitan cathedral; a magnificent sepulchre of alabaster, built by Miguel Florentín (6) and commissioned by his brother Íñigo López de Mendoza, was completed in 1508 (7).\n\nBibliography.

There are discrepancies among the sources consulted concerning the date and the number of cardinals created in this consistory. \"Essai de liste générale des cardinaux. VIII. Les cardinaux du XVIe siècle\". Annuaire Pontifical Catholique 1936, p. 121, indicates that these three cardinals were created in the consistory celebrated on March 20, 1500. Cardella, Lorenzo. Memorie storiche de' cardinali della Santa Romana Chiesa. Rome : Stamperia Pagliarini, 1793, III, 279, says that the three cardinals were promoted on March 16 or 20, 1500, and that they were published on September 28 of the same year. Chacón, Alfonso. Vitæ, et res gestæ Pontificvm Romanorum et S. R. E. Cardinalivm, II, col. 1332, says that the consistory took place on Anno Domini 1500. Pontificatus 8. 13. Kal. Aprilis. Eubel, Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi, II, 24, indicates that the consistory took place on September 28, 1500 and that thirteen cardinals were created, the three of this consistory and the ten created in the consistory of that date, listed in the catalog of consistories of the pontificate of Pope Alexander VI on this site. Eubel adds in note 1, on that same page, that there are sources which indicate that the first three cardinals (the ones above) were created on March 16 or 20, 1500. Moreover, the sources indicate that they were promoted to the cardinalate secretly and do not mention the creations as in pectore.\n\nTop Consistories Catalogs Home"
