        "text": "The authors underline the importance of the print Ara poru aguĭyey haba (meaning about the good use of time) for the Jesuit missions of Paraguay and the colonial Río de la Plata. Attributed to Father José Insaurralde, it is a two-volume devotional text entirely written in Guaraní that was published in Madrid in 1759 and 1760. Until now, literature has only approached the Ara poru in a superficial and external way, because it is written in a different way from the current ones. The unpublished translation of the summary and two preliminary warnings to readers reveal that it follows the structure of Ignacio de Loyola's Spiritual Exercises. The authors of this article demonstrate that by the mid-eighteenth century, the Jesuit project was to produce an indigenous reader and devotee in the modern sense (individual reading and personal transformation).\n\nWhat are ‘classical traditions’? To whom do they belong? Classical traditions endured in a region, Latin America, that is rarely associated with Greco-Roman antiquity. Classical Studies excluded Jews, Egyptians, Persians, Arabs and other peoples from consideration, but also excluded Roman late antiquity and Byzantine Greece as well as the European middle ages from its purview. The practitioners of Classical Studies also played down the achievements of earlier antiquarians in Iberia as well as in Italy – at the same time as they made full use of their work. Classical Studies’ narrow definition of the ancient world is still prevalent, and it has caused many of its legacies to disappear from view. What about the tens of thousands of youths trained for 300 years in scholastic legacies of Greek academic philosophy and the Justinian code of Roman law at universities, academies and courts of Lima and Mexico and throughout Spanish America? We have yet to understand how dozens of early-modern Spanish American authors who published in Lyon, Cologne, Rome, Venice, Geneve, Antwerp shaped the global legacies of Classical Studies.\n\nThis paper analyzes the work Paraguay Natural Ilustrado and discusses the impact that the American experience and the later exile in Italy had in the trajectory and intellectual production of its author, Jesuit priest José Sánchez Labrador. The four volumes have evidence of the scientific advancements in Europe in the second half of the eighteenth century, due to his contact with other exiled Jesuits and the collection of the Library of Ravenna, along with his observations of American nature and the indigenous populations of the Jesuit Province of Paraguay. His experience for thirty-four years in the Americas, and later in exile, unmistakably are present in Paraguay Natural. It contributes significantly to the reconstitution of the circulation process and appropriation of botanical knowledge and of the intellectual environment in which the Jesuit brothers and priests were in, both in the missions among the natives in America, as well as in Europe in their exile.\n\nThis paper highlights a unique phenomenon in Colombia, the entanglement between Latin and power, epitomised by the pivotal role of President and Latinist Miguel Antonio Caro. The study of Classics arrived in the territory with the first conquerors from Spain at the end of the sixteenth century and Caro stands on the shoulders of a long Classical tradition in New Granada. A member of the Conservative Party and a humanist, he was widely known for his work and contribution in the Political Constitution of the Republic of Colombia of 1886 and his central role in the formation of the modern state of Colombia. Besides politics, Caro co-authored a Latin Grammar, wrote many articles on translation and Latin Literature, composed poetry in Spanish and Latin, and produced the first translation of the complete works of Vergil in Colombia. Caro's works and days aptly demonstrate the association between grammar, Classics, and state power throughout the history of Colombia. The paper contextualises the role of Classics in Colombia from the colonial period until the end of the nineteenth century and sketches Caro as an individual and a politician. It outlines his scholarly activity, which involved grammar, translation, and scholarly publishing, and underlines his influence on other scholars and his idiosyncratic interest, as a decisive political figure, in re-invigorating interest in Latin language and literature.\n\nIf our modern vision is not appropriate for understanding music of the colonial era, how shall we approach the sonic experiences of the past? What are the characteristics of the indigenous musical experience in missionary regions of Paraguay during the 17th and 18th centuries? In this article I will explore a few ways to respond to these questions. In the first section, I discuss analytical models for the “sonic experience” in the missionary regions, putting special emphasis on what such models reveal about the native categories that define the limits of the sonic world. I continue by describing concrete uses of sound in the daily routine and rituals of the missions, showing how it served as a hegemonic mechanism that reinforced regimes of temporality and corporality. In the third section I refer to what can be called “counter-hegemonic uses of sound”—that is, those instances in which sound is openly linked to indigenous acts of resistance. Finally, I conclude by presenting some considerations about ambiguous or hybrid zones, in which sound is used as a means of negotiation between Jesuit authorities and the indigenous population.\n\nThe article discusses the position of classical antiquity in higher education in Brazil, taking into account post-colonialism in South America and calls for ‘decolonisation’ in the field of classical archaeology globally. It is concerned with how the subject of classical antiquity in Brazil intersects with ideals of classical antiquity as European heritage developed during the colonial period, and its perceived embodiment of colonial, eurocentric ideals. This particular inflection in the study of classical antiquity is here referred to as tropicalismo. Situating the discussion within the philosophy of historiography, intellectual and cultural history, it combines empirical ethnography, theory in archaeology and classical reception studies, touching on themes stretching from colonial-era policies to modern-day Amazonian anthropology. The study shows that the emergence of classical archaeology in Brazilian university education, rather than propping up a colonial elitist perspective, helped the foundation of indigenous archaeology at the time of the last dictatorship, thus aligning with progressive social movements. It also documents how the perspective of classical archaeology in Brazil differs from dominant euro-centric models, therefore offering an intrinsic, if not explicit, form of decolonised classical archaeology at a time that the ‘decolonisation’ of archaeology as a discipline remains a hotly debated topic – and largely a desideratum – in European and north American theoretical movements."
