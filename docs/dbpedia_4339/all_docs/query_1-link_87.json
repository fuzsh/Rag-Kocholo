        "text": "Mendoza Surname Name Meaning, Origin, History, & Etymology\n\nAccording to ancestry.com, this is a last name of Basque origin that was a habitational name referring to persons who lived in or where from places called Mendoza, which were in the provinces of Arava and Biscay, deriving from the Basque word mendi (mountain) and otz (cold) and hence literally translates as cold mountain. Another source says its from the province of Alva.This theory is corroborated by Eldson Coles Smith in his 1956 book “Dictionary of American Family Names” where he asserts this is a Portuguese and/or Spanish surname for a person who came from cold or high mountains, called Mendoza. An alternative theory, proffered by Henry Harrison in his 1912 book “Surnames of the United Kingdom”, from the feminine mendosa of the Spanish word mendoso, meaning mendacious (untruthful/dishonest). It should also be noted that a baserri (a type of farm house) with the same name exists in Erandio, Biscay. It was originally named mendotza, and then evolved to mendontze, and then to mendoche, and then to mendoxte, and finally mendotza.\n\nThe name first established itself in the medieval Spanish Kingdom of Castile (1065-1230 AD). The original noble family bearing this surname was based in a castle of the same name, which was located near Vitoria-Gasteiz, Basque Country. However, another branch of this aristocratic family came from Laudio. Futther, the Governors of Granada bore this surname, and were very influential in the establishment of Spain’s Empire in the Americas.\n\nThe House of Mendoza was a powerful dynasty of Spanish nobles that wielded authority and influence primarily from the 1300s to the 1600s in Castile. Wikipedia states “In 1332, the Mendozas had already been there at least a century, struggling with the rival clans, such as the Ayala, Orozco, and Velasco. They traced themselves as a stem of the House of Haro, another powerful clan of the Basque countries. Once the Castilian Civil War came to an end with the triumph of Queen Isabella of Castile, the Basque interclan warfare generally ended as well, but even way before, since the 14th century, the Mendoza were jostling for position and privilege in Castile, an expanding military power. By virtue of the Mendozas’ status as knights and free men, they became Castilian nobility with Álava’s annexation (hidalgos)”.\n\nThe first of this family to occupy an eminent posirtion in Castile was Gonzálo Yáñez de Mendoza. As part of the Reconquista, the effort to take back the Iberian Peninsula of Europe back Muslim kingdoms of Spain who has been in power for several hundred years, he fought in the Battle of Rio Salado in 1340 AD and also at the Siege of Algeciras several years later. He also was the chief huntsman to King Alfonso XI.\n\nOne of the earliest known bearer of this popular European and Latin American last name was Garcia Pedro de Mendoza, who was christened at Jerez de la Frontera in Cadiz Spain in the year 1440 AD. An early baptism in the present day United States was Manuel Mendoza, at the Santa Clara Mission in California in 1785.\n\nSpelling Variations\n\nSome spelling variants or names with similar etymologies include Mendosa, Mendioza, Mendooza, Meendoza, Mendonca, and Menodoza.\n\nPopularity & Geographic Distribution\n\nThe last name Mendoza ranks 134th in popularity in the United Status as of the 2000 Census.
