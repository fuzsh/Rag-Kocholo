        "text": "Liliana Mendoza passed away at her home on December, 23rd 2018. \"Lili\" was born on August 8th, 1985 to Antonio Orozco and Socorro Vazquez in Villa de Cos, Zacatecas, Mexico. She was sister to Jancarlo and Leila Orozco Vazquez. At the age of nine, she immigrated to the United States with her family. Lili attended and graduated from West Ottawa High School in Holland Michigan.\n\nOn September 3rd 2011, she married Jose Rodrigo Mendoza whom she adored. She was a mother to Samuel, Marco, Diego and Liliana Mendoza. Her devotion and interests in life were most focused on her family. Much of her time and efforts were directed in being a loving wife, a devoted mother, sister, daughter, and a supportive and loyal friend. During her first pregnancy, she turned to Heavenly Father asking for a son. When Samuel was born, she often shared the scripture found in 1 Samuel 1:27 “For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him”. Lili’s heart was filled with profound gratitude for this blessing and was thankful for God’s grace upon her and her family. Her husband Rodrigo described her as the spiritual giant of the family.\n\nShe loved our Savior Jesus Christ and His teachings. She was a dedicated servant of our savior and respected other people’s beliefs as well. In times of adversity, Lili turned to God for she trusted Him.\n\nShe was a firm believer that God was present in her life and that he listened to and answered her prayers. As a mother, she spent her time enriching her children's lives, providing them with opportunities to learn and grow physically, emotionally and spiritually. She volunteered in her son’s preschool classroom and coached his soccer team in 2017. She also volunteered at City on the Hill. At church, when there was a need she would volunteer to be of service and would willingly assist when asked. She enjoyed having others surrounding her and making sure others were having a good time.\n\nLily touched the lives of those around her in memorable ways. She exuded radiance in her smile and her presence. She was absolutely beautiful and full of kind, positive, and complimentary words.\n\nHer love for those around her was shown on a daily basis. She had an inviting and approachable spirit. She was patient and always ready to help a stranger or a friend in need. She was an incredible cook and host to those who visited her at home. She gave her very best to those around her. In addition, Lili enjoyed outdoor activities like spending time with family on trips, gardening, raising chickens, and being a beekeeper. As we say goodbye to Lili, our minds ponder on the joy she brought to those around her. The world has lost a light and the darkness that ensues will be felt for a very long time.\n\nThank you, Lili, for being who you were to all of us who got to know and love you. You will be dearly missed. We rest assured in the comforting arms of the Savior, knowing that we will see you again.\n\nFuneral services will be 11 am Saturday at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, 1340 East 8th Street.\n\nVisitation will be from 9-10:45 am, prior to the service at the church.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to, Little Hawks Preschool-4214 56th Street; Holland, MI 49423\n\nArrangements are by the Dykstra Funeral Home-Northwood Chapel."
