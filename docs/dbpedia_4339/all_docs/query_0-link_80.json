Earl Russell has graciously favoured J. T. Davenport with the following :— “ Extract of a despatch from Mr. Webb, H.B.M.’s Consul at Manilla, dated Sept. 17, 1864 :— “The Remedy most efficacious in its effects (in Epidemic Cholera) has been found to be Vhiorodyne, and with a small quantity given to me by Dr. Burke I have saved several lives.’” CAUTION. CHLORODYNE. Vice-Chancellor Sir W. P. WOOD stated that Dr. COLLIS BROWNE was undoubtedly the inventor of Chiorodyne; that the story of the defendant, Freeman, was deliberately untrue, which he regretted to say, had been sworn to. Eminent Hospital Physicians of London stated that Dr. J. Collis Browne was the discoverer of Chlorodyne; that they prescribe it largely ; and mean no other than Dr. Browne's. —Bee “Times,” July 13th, 1864. The Public are therefore cautioned against using any other than p DR. J, COLLIS BROWNE'S CHLORODYNE, This invaluable Remedy produces quiet refreshing sleep, relieves pain, calms the system, restores the deranged functions, and stimulates healthy action of the secretions of the body, without creating any of those spl eaeattt results attending the use of opium. Old and young may take it at all hours and times when roquisite. Thousands of persons testify to ite marvellous good effects and wonderful cures, while medical men extol its virtues most extensively, using it in great quantities in the following diseases :— Consumption, Asthma, Bronchitis, Whooping Cough, Neuralgia, Diarrhea, Rheumatism, Spasms, «c. EXTRACTS FROM MEDICAL OPINIONS. From Dr. Monteomery, late Inspector of Hospitals, Bombay :—‘*Chlorodyne is a most valuable remedy in neuralgia, asthma, and dysentery; to itI fairly owe my restoration to health, after eighteen months’ severe suffering and when all other medicines had failed.\" From W. Vessativs Petricrew, M.D. :—‘'I have no hesitation in stating that I have never met with any medicine #0 efficacious as an anti-spasmodic and sedative. I have used it in consumption, asthma, diarrhoea, and other diseases, and am most perfectly satisfied with the results.” From Mr. C, Bicuarps :—‘‘Messina, Nov. 28, 1867. My father, the British Vice-Consul at this port, has spoken very highly of Dr. J. Collis Browne's Chlorodyne in his Report to the British Government of the Epidemic Cholera in Messina, 1867, and really its efficacy is wonderful.” CHLORODYNE, the GREAT REMEDY for CHOLERA. (See Report in the ‘‘Times,” September 6th, from the Malta Correspondent, who states, August 24th, that ‘108 cases and 81 deaths occurred at Messina; 50,000 people fled from the town, which isin a most deplorable condition, that Chlorodyne has been found most efficacious as a remedy, and a number of persons are reported to have been saved by its use,”) Now, as there are various imitations sold under the name of Chlorodyne, containing Indian hemp, morphia, é&c., ingredients highly adverse to the cure of cholera, the public are cautioned against the use of any compound under the name of Chlorodyne unless it bears the name of Dr. J. COLLIS BROWNE, who coined the word Chlorodyne to designate his wonderful discovery, which he fully tested for many years in Her Majesty's service before introducing it to the public, the wonderful success of which has given rise to various imitations, totally different to genuine Chlorodyne. See the decision of Vice-Chancellor Sir W. Page Wood, reported in the “Times,” July 13th, 1864. The extraordinary medival reports on the efficacy of Chlorodyne render it a subject of most vital impurtance that the public should obtain the genuine, which is now sold under the protection of the Government of Great Britain, authorizing a stamp, bearing the words “Dr. J. Collis Browne's Chlorodyne,” without which none is genuine. Sold in bottles, 1s. 1}d., 2s. 9d., and 4s. 6d., by all Chemists. SOLE MANUFACTURER, J. T.

A West-END PRIVATE HoTEL.—Few persons but those who have availed themselves of the comfort and convenience of a Private Hotel, conducted on a liberal scale, can appreciate the advantages of such a temporary home. This class of Hotel is more frequently to be met with in London than in any Continental or American city, and there are certain localities in London which favour their popularity with the upper classes of society. For example, in Dover Street, Piccadilly, there is one of long-established reputation, known by the name of Cowan’s Hotel, but now possessed by Mr, Denyer. It would seem as if it had been built for this especial purpose, as a long passage connects under the same roof one house with an entrance in Albemarle Street, and another with an exit or entrance in Dover Street. Each house contains suites of fine, large, and lofty rooms, beautifully furnished, and replete with all the conveniences of a private dwelling. The general supervision of the establishment is under the immediate care of Mrs. Denyer (formerly Miss Cowan), and whether a suite of rooms is occupied by a family or an individual visitor, there is the same regard to the comforts and requirements of each. The ménagz is at the option and according to individual orders, and is, of course, of the very best character that the London markets can supply. ENLARGED. RE-DECORATED. 26, Dover STREET, AND, 29, ALBEMARLE STREET, LONDON. W. HOME COMFORTS. TERMS MODERATE. win Ss. For wines, there is from the fact of Mr, DENYER being a wine merchant with very large con- nections among the nobility, an inimitable choice of the best brands and from the first shippers. The wine cellars are, however, in a very distinct locality, being situated in Regent Street, and occupying a subterraneous area extending in breadth from the west to the east or opposite side of this spacious street. sparkling and still wines of every class which Germany and the champagne districts can furnish, the red wines of Portugal, and the white wines of Spain are not only to be found in these cellars in every variety, but Messrs. Denyer and Co. have a special reputation of possessing the largest stock of the choice and delicate sherries of Sanlucar which can perhaps be found in London. These last named wines are a speciality in themselves, because it is well known that Sanlucar is the native soil of Amontillado, Manzanilla, and all that class of dry sherries which are so highly recommended for their pure, natural, and nutritive properties. They are also importers of The New Sparkling Wine, Rhinegau Champagne. NOTE.—Suites of Rooms specially adapted for Wedding Breakfasts. Estimates given for large or small parties, inclusive of Wines if required. Special advantages are offered in respect of Wines, which can be purchased atthe cellars, 95, REGENT STREET, at Merchants’ prices, paying the Hotel a small charge for Corkage.

Tux earliest mention of a Secretary to The Sovereign occurs in the 87th year of the reign of Henry III, 1253. There was only one Principal Secretary of State until the 30th year of the reign of Henry VIII, 1539, when the number was increased to two, both being of equal rank and authority. . Upon the union with Scotland, in the 6th year of the reign of Queen Anne, 1708, a third Principal Secretary of State was added, viz., for Scotch Affairs, but this appointment ceased in January, 1746. In the 8th year of the reign of George III, January 20, 1768, a Principal Secretary of State for the American or Colonial Department was added, who was styled ‘‘ Secretary of State for the Colonies,” but this appointment was abolished in 1782 (Act 25 Geo. III. c. 82). At the time when only two Principal Secretaries of State existed, the duties were divided between the North and South Departments—the Northern Department, or Province, included the Low Countries, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Russia, &e.; and the Southern Department, or Province, France, Switzerland, Italy, Spain Portugal, and Turkey, &c. In the 17th year of the reign of George III, March 27, 1782, the terms “Northern” and “Southern” were discontinued; when the duties were divided between the “ Home ” and “ Foreign” Departments—the affairs of Ireland and the Colonies devolving upon the elder of the two Secretaries. In the 29th year of the reign of George III, July 17, 1794, a Principal Secretary of State for War was appointed ; and the business of the Colonies, which had hitherto been carried on at the Home Department, was transferred to that Secretory, March 17, 1801. In the 17th year of the reign of Victoria, June 12, 1854, a Fourth Principal Secretary of State was appointed, when the business of the War Department was separated from the Colonial Department. In the 22nd year of the reign of Victoria, September 2, 1858, on the abolition of the East India Company’s Charter, a Fifth Principal Secretary of State was appointed for the Affairs of India. There are now Five Secretaries of State, viz., for the Home, Foreign, Colonial, War, and India Departments. a SECRETARIES OF STATE FOR THE NORTHERN DEPARTMENT, 1761 ro 1782. Oct. 9.
