        "text": "Description of the artwork «Landscape»\n\n\"Landscape\" paper charcoal, pencil Gerasimov S.V. 1946 year\n\nsignature bottom right and back\n\nsheet size 23x16 cm in a frame under glass and mat\n\nGerasimov Sergey Vasilievich 1885-1964\n\nSoviet, Russian artist-painter, teacher. Doctor of Arts (1956). People's Artist of the USSR (1958). Lenin Prize Laureate (1966 - posthumously).\n\nBorn on September 14 (26), 1885 in Mozhaisk, Moscow province (now Moscow region) into a peasant family. In 1901-1907 he studied at the Stroganov Central School of Industrial Art, in 1907-1912 - at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture (now the Moscow Art Institute named after V.I.Surikov), where his mentors were S.V. Ivanov and K. A. Korovin. He was a member of the associations \"Makovets\", \"Society of Moscow Artists\" and AHRR. He lived in Moscow and Mozhaisk, where in 1915 he built himself a house-workshop. A representative of Russian impressionism, who also created a number of standard socialist realist paintings. In the early painting of the artist (\"Frontline\", 1926, Tretyakov Gallery (State Tretyakov Gallery)) features of moderate cubism (\"Cezanneism\") emerge. In \"The Oath of Siberian Partisans\" (1933, Russian Museum) he mastered the principles of the revolutionary propaganda \"thematic picture\". If this image is remembered for its harsh severity, then the famous \"Kolkhoz Holiday\" (1937, State Tretyakov Gallery) looks like a colorful scenic extravaganza, woven from separate \"juicy\" pieces. One of the most famous paintings about the war was The Mother of the Partisan (1943-1950, State Tretyakov Gallery). Through all the work of the master, real impressions of post-revolutionary upheavals and troubles pass - first of all, in the repeated motives of the Luzhetsky monastery adjacent to his house, destroyed and barbarously ruined after its closure in 1926. In simple in plot, lyrically-soulful landscapes (series \"Mozhaisk Landscapes\", 1954, State Tretyakov Gallery; and others), the artist's pictorial impressionism was expressed most organically. The surrounding reality is inextricably linked in these compositions with memories of Russian provincial antiquity. Illustrated works of M. Gorky, N. A. Nekrasov and other authors. He showed himself as an experienced teacher. Since 1912, he taught at the art school at the typolithography of I.D. Sytin, and then at VKHUTEMAS - Higher art and technical workshops, and other institutes. In 1943-1948 - director of the Moscow State Institute of Art. V.I.Surikov. Professor. A skilful and sensitive administrator, having won a solid reputation in the middle of the century as a cautious but staunch liberal (for which in 1948 he was dismissed from the post of director of the Moscow State Art Institute named after V.I. Surikov). In 1950-1964 he also served as director of the Moscow Higher School of Industrial Art (now the Moscow Art and Industry Academy named after S. G. Stroganov). Academician of the Academy of Arts of the USSR (1947). 1958-1964 - First Secretary of the Board of the Union of Artists of the USSR. Member of the CPSU (b) since 1943. He died on April 20, 1964 in Moscow. He was buried at the Novodevichy cemetery (site No. 6).
