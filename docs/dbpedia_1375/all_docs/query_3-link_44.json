He promised her that he would write a poem in her honor, and publish it in tomorrow’s issue of “News”. She did not believe, and the poem has already been written, and stood in the band. Mikhalkov could only reach the editorial office and change the title of “Lullaby” on the title of “Svetlana”. However, Stalin’s daughter was also named Svetlana. Stalin read the poem and asked to contact the author and see if he needs any help.\n\nThe first wife of Sergei Mikhalkov became Natalya Konchalovskaya – writer, granddaughter of the artist Surikov.

He has the title of Hero of Socialist Labor.\n\nSergey Mikhalkov died on August 27, 2009, at the age of 97. He was buried in Moscow at the Novodevichy cemetery. His poems, known to every Soviet man, have become the symbol of time.\n\nSoviet writer Sergey Mikhalkov"
