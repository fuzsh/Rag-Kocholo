        "text": "The most famous Soviet film-maker since Sergei Eisenstein, Andrei Tarkovsky (the son of noted poet Arseniy Tarkovsky) studied music and Arabic in Moscow before enrolling in the Soviet film school VGIK. He shot to international attention with his first feature, Iwans Kindheit (1962), which won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival. This resulted in high expectations for his second feature Andrej Rubljow (1966), which was banned by the Soviet authorities for two years. It was shown at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival at four o'clock in the morning on the last day, in order to prevent it from winning a prize - but it won one nonetheless, and was eventually distributed abroad partly to enable the authorities to save face. Solaris (1972), had an easier ride, being acclaimed by many in Europe and North America as the Soviet answer to Kubrick's '2001' (though Tarkovsky himself was never too fond of his own film nor Kubrick's), but he ran into official trouble again with Der Spiegel (1975), a dense, personal web of autobiographical memories with a radically innovative plot structure. Stalker (1979) had to be completely reshot on a dramatically reduced budget after an accident in the laboratory destroyed the first version, and after Nostalghia (1983), shot in Italy (with official approval), Tarkovsky defected to Europe. His last film, Opfer (1986) was shot in Sweden with many of Ingmar Bergman's regular collaborators, and won an almost unprecedented four prizes at the Cannes Film Festival. He died of lung cancer at the end of the year. Two years later link=Sergei Parajanov dedicated his film Ashik Kerib to Tarkovsky.\n\nGrigori Mikhailovich Kozintsev was born on March 22, 1905, in Kiev, Russian Empire (now Kiev, Ukraine). His father, named Mikhail Kozintsev, was a medical doctor. Young Kozintsev studied at the Kiev Gymnazium. There, in 1919, he organized experimental theatre \"Arlekin\" together with his fellow students Sergei Yutkevich and Aleksei Kapler. During 1919 and 1920 Kozintsev studied art at the Kiev School of Art under the tutelage of Alexandra Exter.\n\nExperiments. In 1920 Kozintsev moved to Petrograd (Leningrad or St. Petersburg). There he studied art at the \"VKHUTEMAS\" at the Academy of Fine Arts for two years. In 1921 Kozintsev with Sergei Yutkevich, Leonid Trauberg, and Leonid Kryzhitsky organized and led the Factory of Excentric Actors (FEKS). There Kozintsev directed radically avant-garde staging of plays \"Zhenitba\" (Marriage 1922) by Nikolay Gogol and \"Vneshtorg na Eifelevoi Bashne\" (Foreign trade on Eiffel Tower 1923). They were based in the former Eliseev Mansion on Gagarinskaya street No. 1 in St. Petersburg. Kozintsev and FEKS collaborated with writer Yuri Tynyanov, cinematographer Andrey Moskvin, young actor-director Sergey Gerasimov, artist Igor Vuskovich, and young composer Dmitri Shostakovich among others. Initially FEKS was the main platform for experimental actors, directors and artists, and was strongly influenced by Vsevolod Meyerhold and Vladimir Mayakovsky.\n\nArtistic position. In 1924 Kozintsev and Trauberg came to \"SevZapKino\" Studios (now Lenfilm Studios). There Kozintsev continued his FEKS experiments in his first eccentric comedy 'Pokhozhdenie Oktyabriny' (1924). Kozintsev's early films were strongly criticized by official Soviet critics. His film 'Shinel' (1926) was compared to German Expressionism and accused of distortion of the original classic story by Nikolay Gogol. Kozintsev strongly argued against such comparisons with German expressionism; he was unhappy until the end of his life about such criticism of his early experimental works. Kozintsev insisted that his cheerful experiments were essential in the city of Petrograd (St. Petersburg) after the Russian Revolution of 1917, which brought destruction, depression, crime, and degradation of culture.\n\nEarly films. Kozintsev made twelve films together with Leonid Trauberg. Their collaboration began in 1921, in Petrograd (St. Petersburg). Their film-trilogy about Russian revolutionary hero Maxim was made from 1935-1941, when people in the Soviet Russia were terrorized under the most brutal dictatorship of Joseph Stalin. In departure from experimental youthfulness and freedom of their FEKS years, the Maxim trilogy was a trade-off blend of experiment and Soviet propaganda. It was still a powerful work and was even banned by censorship in the United States from the 1930s-1950s. For that work Kozintsev and Trauberg were awarded the Stalin's State Prize in 1941. After the Second World War Kozintsev and Trauberg made their last film together: 'Prostye Lyudi (Plain People 1946), which was censored and remained unreleased until 1958, when \"Nikita Khrushchev' lifted the ban imposed by Stalin's censorship.\n\nHighlights. Grigori Kozintsev ascended to his best works after the death of Stalin. Then Nikita Khrushchev initiated the \"Thaw\" which played a role in some liberation of individual creativity in the Soviet film industry. Kozintsev's adaptations of classical literature combined some experimental elements of his earlier silent films with the approach of a mature master. His Don Quixote (1957), King Lear (1969) and especially Hamlet (1963) were recognized worldwide as his highest achievements. In _Korol Lir (1969)_ Kozintsev made a brilliant decision to cast actors from the Baltic States as the Lear's family. Jüri Järvet, Regimantas Adomaitis, Donatas Banionis, Juozas Budraitis, and Elza Radzina together with Oleg Dal, Galina Volchek, Aleksey Petrenko made a powerful acting ensemble.\n\nHamlet and King Lear. Kozintsev first staged Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" and 'King Lear\" in 1941. His collaboration with Boris Pasternak began in 1940, when Pasternak was working on his Russian translation of the Shakespeare's originals. Both plays were prepared for stage under direction of Kozintsev. King Lear was staged in 1941, but further work was interrupted because of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. Hamlet was staged in 1954. At the same time Kozintsev continued developing the idea of filming _Gamlet (1964)_, until everything came together in his legendary film. The adaptation by Boris Pasternak, the music by Dmitri Shostakovich, the direction by Kozintsev, and the acting talent of Innokentiy Smoktunovskiy produced special creative synergy. Innokentiy Smoktunovskiy was praised as the best Hamlet by Sir Laurence Olivier.\n\nLegacy. In the 1920s Kozintsev taught at the Leningrad School of Acting. From 1944-1964 Kozintsev led his master-class for film directors at the Soviet State Film Institute (VGIK). Among his students were many prominent Russian directors and actors such as Sergey Gerasimov and others. Kozintsev was the head of master-class for film directors at Lenfilm Studios from 1964-1971. He wrote essays on William Shakespeare, Sergei Eisenstein, Charles Chaplin, and Vsevolod Meyerhold and published theoretical works on film direction. Grigori Kozintsev lived near Lenfilm Stidios in Leningrad (St. Petersburg) for the most part of his life. His work and presence was essential to the status of Lenfilm Studios as well as to the film community in Leningrad during the political and economic domination of Moscow as the Soviet capital. From his early works of the 1920s to his masterpiece _Gamlet (1964)_, Kozintsev was faithful to creative experimental approach.\n\nKozintsev was designated the People's Artist of the USSR. He was awarded the State Lenin's Prize of the USSR (1965), and received other awards and nominations. He died in Leningrad (St. Petersburg) on May 11, 1973, and was laid to rest in the Necropolis of the Masters of Art in St. Aleksandr Nevsky Convent in St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\nLeonid Zakharovich Trauberg is Soviet film director and screenwriter. People's Artist of the RSFSR (1987). Leonid Trauberg was born in Odessa. After moving to Petrograd, the family settled in house number 7, apt. 4, along Kolomenskaya street.\n\nIn December 1921, together with Grigoriy Kozintsev and G. Kryzhitskiy, he wrote the \"Eccentric Theater Manifesto,\" which was proclaimed at a debate organized by them. In 1922, Kozintsev and Trauberg organized the Theater Workshop \"Factory of an Eccentric Actor\", and in the same year they put in it an eccentric reworking of \"Marriage\" by Nikolay Gogol. For two years, they staged 3 more plays based on their own plays, and in 1924 they transferred their experiments in the field of eccentric comedy to cinema, transforming the theater workshop into the FEKS Film Workshop.\n\nThe first full-length film by Kozintsev and Trauberg - the romantic melodrama Chyortovo koleso (1926) according to the script of Adrian Piotrovsky - was already a mature work. Love for a bright eccentric was combined with a convincing display of urban life. This film has a permanent creative team; in addition to the directors, it included cameraman Andrey Moskvin and artist Yevgeni Yenej, who worked with Kozintsev in almost all of his films.\n\nIn 1926-1932, Leonid Trauberg taught at the Leningrad Institute of Performing Arts, in 1926-1927 he was the head of the film department of the Leningrad Theater Institute. In 1961-1965 he taught at the VKSR under the Goskino USSR.\n\nProkofiev was a multi-talented man and an innovative composer. He learned piano from his mother and chess from his father. He always had a chess set on his piano, and was able to play against the chess champions of his time. He studied music with Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, graduated with highest marks from the St. Petersburg Conservatory (1914), and was rewarded with a grand piano. He emigrated from Russia after the revolution, and made successful concert tours in Europe and the U.S. In 1918 in New York he met Spanish singer Carolina Codina (Lina Llubera), they married in Paris, in 1923, and had two sons.\n\nProkofiev's radiant optimism and his childlike personality shines in his popular orchestral suite \"Peter and the Wolf\" and in the \"Classical Symphony\". His humorous irony and wit is popping up in piano pieces named \"Sarcasms\", also in his five piano concertos, ballets and film scores, all written in his instantly identifiable musical language. He wrote film scores for Poruchik Kizhe (1934), Alexander Newski (1938), Khrustalnyy bashmachok Zolushki (1961), and the two-part Iwan, der Schreckliche I (1944), directed by Sergei Eisenstein.\n\nAll of his music, that he created while outside of the Soviet Union, was sometimes criticized as cosmopolitan and anti-Soviet. Prokofiev divorced his wife in 1948. His ninth sonata, dedicated to Svyatoslav Richter, was welcomed warmly, but another official critic on his music and life started in 1948. He died in 1953, the same day of Joseph Stalin.\n\nVladimir Menshov was a Russian director and actor, noted for his depiction of the Russian everyman and working class life in his films. Born on September, 17, 1937 in Baku (then USSR, now the territory of Azerbaijan), like many Russian directors and actors Menshov studied at the state film school VGIK. Although his filmography as an actor is superior to that as director (actually confined to only five movies), he will be remembered most of all for his second film as director, Moskau glaubt den Tränen nicht (1980), one of the most popular and beloved films in Russia, starring his wife Vera Alentova. The film brought him international recognition and the Oscar for the Best Foreign Film. Menshov did not attend the Academy Awards ceremony personally because he could not leave the country due to some problems of political nature, and the prize statuette was accepted by the USSR Commissioner to the U.S. The film itself is a moving story of three girlfriends who arrive in Moscow in search for a better life. A great melodrama in the first place, on a close analysis, the film can be seen as a biography of a whole generation since in the late 1970s, young people who abandoned their provincial towns with no opportunities for good jobs and strove to settle in the Russian capital.\n\nIn 1999, the 20th anniversary of the film's original release was celebrated at a series of events around Russia. Another film, an immensely popular comedy of manners Der Kurschatten (1985), was about a rural farmer peasant falling in love with a glamor urban lady. It ensured that his career continued to glitter. In the decade that followed he refrained from directing and in his rare interviews was very critical of the cinema industry. In 1995 he made Shirli-myrli (1995) - a very long extravaganza satirizing practically every aspect of cultural and political life in Russia. The film showed that these \"off the job\" years had not affected his talent. Zavist bogov (2000) - a nostalgic drama - demonstrated his longing for the Soviet era life style. Although criticized by some for \"being too simple\", Menshov was affectionately loved by ordinary cinema-goers who saw him as one of a very few directors capable of creating a perfect comedy or drama out of a down-to-earth situation.\n\nGeorgi Daneliya was born on August 25, 1930 in Tbilisi, Georgia. Since 1939 the family lived in Moscow, where Danelia's father was the chief engineer for the Moscow Underground Metro System. Daneliya's father became a decorated WWII General, specializing in construction of underground bunkers for the Soviet Government. His mother was a good chess-player and later worked as a second unit director at Mosfilm. Daneliya's mother's sister Veriko Anjaparidze was married to Mikheil Chiaureli, who was a personal friend of Joseph Stalin. Daneliya first earned his architect's degree from the Moscow Architecture Institute. Then he studied at the Higher Director's Courses at Mosfilm under Mikhail Romm, and graduated in 1959, becoming a film director at the Mosfilm Studios in Moscow.\n\nDuring the cultural \"Thaw\" initiated by Nikita Khrushchev Daneliya was at the start of the Soviet \"New Wave\" in films. He had his first success shared with Igor Talankin. Their film 'Seryozha' (1960) was awarded the Crystal Globe in Karlovy Vary. He then worked with Gennady Shpalikov on a propaganda-free project about life in Moscow. Censorship caused a few obstacles by demanding changes to the plot and the script of 'Walking the Streets of Moscow' (1963). It became a popular lyrical comedy with a title hit song by Andrey Petrov. But soon Nikita Khrushchev was dismissed by Leonid Brezhnev and the \"Thaw\" ended. Daneliya's brilliant comedy '33' (1965) was labeled as anti-Soviet by the head of KGB Vladimir Semichastny, who wrote in a secret letter to the Central Committee: \"anti-Soviet...film '33' is an attempt to discredit everything including the cosmonaut's flight.\"\n\nDaneliya had to wait for 4 long years until he got a chance to work on his next film. It was titled \"Don't Grieve\" - 'Ne Goryuy' (1969), starring Vakhtang Kikabidze. His more careful, but masterful comedies 'Gentlemen of Luck' (1972), 'Afonya' (1975), 'Mimino' (1977) continued his successful career. A step beyond the comedy genre was made in his film 'Osenny Marafon' (1979). It's a melodrama about a man in his mid-life crisis, torn between two women, and all three are trapped in the game of lies and personal demands, amidst the stagnant Soviet reality.\n\nHis innovative film 'Kin-Dza-Dza' (1986) stands out as a genre of it's own. Everything is different, yet very familiar in this metaphoric film. New type of script with renown stars, new environment for and old tale, new language for ancient wisdom. Daneliya created a universe of allusions; It grows with a passage of time, while getting closer to our future. He presented a fresh view of the human nature, and played with reflections on his own life, the fate of a genius in a rigid society going through inevitable changes.\n\nDanelia is blessed with good friends and highly professional collaborators. His first wife was actress Lyubov Sokolova (1921-2001) who played 370 film roles and is listed in the Guinnes book of Records. Their son Nikolai Daneliya (1958-1985) was a film director before his tragic death. Danelia lives in Moscow and works on his new project, an animation sequel to 'Kin-Dza-Dza'.\n\nEldar Aleksandrovich Ryazanov was born on November 18, 1927 in Samara, Russia. He graduated with honors from the Soviet State Institute of Cinematography (VGIK) in 1950, as a film director. He was making documentaries for five years. In 1955 Ryazanov came to work at the Mosfilm Studios under the direction of Ivan Pyrev, who produced Ryazanov's first feature film 'Karnavalnaya Noch' (Carnival in Moscow, 1956). It was an instant box office hit starring Lyudmila Gurchenko and Igor Ilyinsky.\n\nRyazanov's early comedies 'Devushka bez adresa' (1957), 'Gusarskaya ballada' (1962), 'Dayte zhalobnuyu knigu' (1963) were popular in the time of the cultural \"Thaw\" which was initiated by Nikita Khrushchev. However Ryazanov's film 'Chelovek niotkuda' (1961) was banned by the Soviet censorship, regardless of the fine acting by Sergey Yurskiy and Anatoliy Papanov. 'Beregis avtomobilya' (Watch Out for the Automobile, 1966) is arguably the most popular of Ryazanov's comedies. In that film Ryazanov worked with the stellar cast, including such actors, as Innokenti Smoktunovsky , Oleg Yefremov, Anatoli Papanov, Georgi Zhzhyonov, Yevgeni Yevstigneyev, Andrei Mironov (I), Olga Aroseva, Donatas Banionis, and other Russian film stars. The music score for the film was written by the brilliant composer Andrey Petrov.\n\nRyazanov created his own style of lyrical comedy with a soft satire on the Soviet life. His 'Zigzag udachi', with Evgeniy Leonov in the leading role, was a nice fairy tale for the Soviet people. 'Stariki-razboyniki', starring Yuriy Nikulin, Evgeniy Evstigneev, and Andrey Mironov was a crime-parody. His extremely popular TV-movie 'Ironiya sidby, ili S lyogkim parom!' (Irony of Fate, 1975 TV) was a big hit of the 70's and later turned into a nostalgic cult. It is shown every New Year's Eve as a tradition in the former Soviet Union. Actors Andrey Myagkov, Yuriy Yakovlev, Barbara Brylska, and Aleksandr Shirvindt are working together as one acting ensemble. Two years later Ryazanov directed another hit, 'Sluzhebny roman' (1977), where Andrei Myagkov made a nice duet with 'Alisa Freindlikh'.\n\nEldar Ryazanov wrote and directed 'Garazh' (1979). Ryazanov delivers a dazzling array of Soviet characters and situations in this film, ranging from funny, bitter, and sarcastic, to greedy, manipulative, and scary stupid. In somewhat a departure from comedy, Ryazanov brings the theme of \"Gulag\" prison-camp in 'Vokzal dlya dvoikh' (1982). Still the film is full of Ryazanov's warm humor and also benefits from the performances of Lyudmila Gurchenko and Oleg Basilashvili. 'Ruthless Romance' (1984) is the Ryazanov's adaptation of the 19th century story by 'Aleksandr Ostrovsky'. His latest film is Andersen. Zhizn bez lyubvi (2006)."
