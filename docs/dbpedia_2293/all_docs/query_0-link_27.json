        "text": "First things first, THANK YOU for visiting my website.\n\nWorking in the entertainment industry has been a dream of mine for as long as I can remember.\n\nTelevision and film ignited my imagination as a child. I loved the story telling and the vicarious escapism. I found myself wishing to be in those worlds, then I discovered I could be. I auditioned for church and school programs and discovered yet another love: audiences.\n\nBut, performing and creating have since driven my life’s passion in multiple roles. As an Actor, Producer, Director, Acting Coach, and Casting Professional, I have been blessed to be a participant in many successful productions for more than 20 years.\n\nI am also the casting associate for Jeff Johnson Casting, recently casting for Disney Channel, HBO, Paramount Network, YouTube Red, BYUtv, Hallmark Channel, and many more.\n\nI currently teach acting and auditioning techniques to all ages. Please click here for more details.\n\nI pride myself on doing my absolute best.\n\nI have always been a hard worker and will commit my all to your project and treat your project with the utmost respect and dedication it deserves. It would be my pleasure to work with you.\n\nVimeo ~ Facebook ~ Instagram\n\nUTAH REPRESENTATION\n\nAgent: Shielia Erickson\n\nPhone: (801) 557-4782\n\nShieliaeMGT@gmail.com\n\n12222 South 1000 East, Suite 2\n\nDraper, UT 84094\n\nRobert Milo Andrus @ Broadway\n\nNEVADA REPRESENTATION\n\nGoldman & Associates\n\nAgent: Julie Goldman\n\nPhone: (702) 990-3210\n\nJulie@gacasting.com\n\n701 N.
