This mission, however, did not succeed, and he therefore returned to Salt Lake City. In the fall of 1882 he was appointed chaplain of the council of the Utah Legislature.\n\nIn 1883 he moved to Cache Valley and located in Oxford in 1884. When the Oneida Stake of Zion was organized in 1884, he was chosen as a member of the High Council of that Stake and also appointed to preside over the High Priests' quorum. He was ordained a Patriarch in 1884.\n\nRipe in years and faithful and true to his Church to the last, Patriarch Andrus died at Oxford, Oneida county, Idaho, June 18, 1893, leaving a large posterity. Brother Andrus was universally known among the saints as an eloquent expounder of the gospel; he possessed the gift of speech to a marvelous extent and exercised influence for good wherever he associated with other men. He was one of the most successful missionaries known in the Church.\n\nHis missionary activities are summed up in the following: Southern Ohio (1833), five months; Zion's Camp (1834), six months; Temple worker at Kirtland (1834), six months; State of New York (1835), five months; Canada (1841), six months; Ohio (1844), seven months; Nauvoo Temple (1845, eight months; Great Britain (1848), two years; St. Louis, Mo.
