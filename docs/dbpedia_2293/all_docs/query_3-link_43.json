        "text": "Our coaches are great at working with actors at their own level... So from Beginning to Advanced, you will find new ways to approach character and gain new skills to help you with your craft.\n\nFor Intermediate and Advanced actors going back to the basics can help you get to the next level in your acting journey.\n\nALL LEVELS\n\nIn this membership, you will learn all the skills you will need as an actor. This is a one-year program. Each month you will add to your toolbox of skills. Hold on tight to your pencil because we go over so much information you will not want to miss a word. Intermediate and Advanced actors are welcome if looking for a reset or to brush up on your skills and add a new arsenal to your game. This is not your basic acting class. This is an all-encompassing class for actors who want to be game-changers in the industry. If you are ready to put in the work we will help you reach your goals.\n\n1 Year Program\n\nTwo days a week\n\nClasses consists of:\n\nImprov Mon 7:30-9:30\n\nFoundations Wed 5:30-8:00\n\nIntermediate/Advanced\n\nRobert Andrus is the top casting associate in Utah. In their office at, Jeff Johnsons Casting, they cast all the big show that come in like \"Yellowstone, Horizon, High School Musical the Musical the Series, 1923 and so much more. This is your opportunity to know what auditions they see come into the office. Get direct feedback and guidance on your moc auditions. We are currently taking participants and viewers.\n\nALL LEVELS\n\nShort form Improv is like the hit TV show \"Who's Line Is It Anyway\". A lot will say, I'm not funny I can't do that! Oh but you can! It is all about the learning the skills behind the games. The next step is to just have a conversation, with a strong opinion. We practice it weekly and build skills along the way to get ready for a showcase where you can show your friends how PLAY. They will think... Friend... I wish I could do that! You will answer... Oh, but you CAN!\n\nIntermediate/Advanced\n\nEach month we run two cycles of scenes. First scene we flush out the story and the second week we film them. In scene study we break down each character and make sure we are hitting all the points that make up a great story. Our courses run in four month segments. You must have a recommendation as an Intermediate or Advanced actor and already ice in the industry. Email us to qualify.\n\nALL LEVELS\n\nFirearms Techniques will help you to know how to safely and correctly handle multiple type guns for a film shoot so you will not look like an ammeter. We do not work with any active artillery or anything that fires. Our instructor, a past firearms trainer for a government program, has broke down what works for film compared to true to life drills and techniques. He will help you to know the real vs movie version of firearm handling adding some pro skills to your resume."
