Billy faces an ultimatum to either save his marriage by leaving Rock Springs forever or to stay in the oil game alone while Cody experiences temptation in the form of another man. With the Black Elks land deal slipping away, Annie and Hap consider doing the unthinkable âjoining forces to help secure this once-in-a-lifetime oil acquisition. Fearing the fate of his son, AJ enlists Tip to help bring the child to safety."
