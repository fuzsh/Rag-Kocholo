        "text": "Sarah Ann Miles Scene from the 2007 play The Life and Wives of Milo Andrus\n\nSARAH ANN MILES:\n\nI was convinced of the truthfulness of the gospel and joined the church along with my brothers. My husband, Charles Sellew, did not agree. I took Lavinia and left for Winters Quarters. “My husband overtook us and demanded that his child be returned to him, threatening violence if his demand was denied.”\n\nI was counseled to return Lavinia to my husband. I had no choice and gave him our precious daughter. I felt I would see her soon. Later, in 1848 I was sealed to Milo Andrus by Brigham Young at Winters Quarters, and left with my husband for England. Milo was an excellent missionary, and had an abiding testimony of the gospel. He was president of the Liverpool district. One of Milo's converts was an ancestor of Elder Henry B. Eyring, who is currently one of your 12 apostles.\n\nHenry Eyring was converted to the gospel in 1854 in St Louis after hearing Milo’s testimony, he wrote that Elder Andrus had a “lively quick manner of speech” and “addressed the congregation in an attractive and fluent manner”. He said, “I will here say that for some years previous to that time I had discarded all belief in revealed religion, [and] had no connection with any church,…” But, “From the time I first heard Elder Andrus speak until now I have always attended the meeting of the Latter-day Saints…”\n\nAfter Milo’s mission we returned to America on the ship “Argo” with several other saints, and we traveled up the Mississippi River on the steamer, “Uncle Sam” to Kanesville, Iowa, later called Council Bluffs. Milo was made captain over fifty-five wagons to Zion. We found difficulty on the trek feeding our cattle due to the gold rush travelers overgrazing the plains grasses. We saw the 49’ers graves all along the way; but our only fatality was a gold digger bound for California.” As we entered the Salt Lake Valley in August 1850; Milo’s wagon sported two hung banners that said, \"Holiness to the Lord\" and \"Hail to the Governor of Deseret.\"\n\nI don't know if it was the birth of Milo Jr, the damp English air, the seasickness, the rigors of the trail, or just the melancholy for Lavinia but I never regained my strength. I finally died on the 28th of November, 1851; Milo Jr was just 3 years old. I was the first to be buried in the Ward Cemetery in Holladay.\n\nEnd Play\n\nChildren: MILO, JUNIOR\n\n\"In the spring of 1848, I was sent on a mission to England. Shortly before I left, Sarah Ann Miles was sealed to me, and she accompanied me to England\" Milo Andrus\n\nSarah is listed according to the Cemetery record in 2 places. 4 1/2 E by 5th North and also 5 E\n\nShe is placed next to Elizabeth BrooksAndrus, Clarence Andrus, and Parley Andrus\n\nLIFE STORY OF SARAH ANN MILES ANDRUS 1818-1851\n\nWritten by Leone Andrus Taylor\n\nMy grandmother, Sarah Ann Miles Andrus, was born 9 March 1818 at Salsbury, Gallia Co., Ohio. She was a daughter of Thomas Miles and Sally Seger (Miles). Other children of the family were Adrian, Admiria, Albert, Benjamin Franklin, Sophia, Noah, Lucinda, Benajah, Belinda, Nathan, and Henry Seger.\n\nWe have no information concerning her childhood. The first knowledge we have following her birth date is that of her marriage to Mr. Charles W.~ or Chauncey Sellew, on 7 July 1841. Mr. Sellew was born in Glastonbury, Connecticut 3 March 1806, but moved to Mendon, Illinois in 1838. A child, Lavinia Maria, was born to them 16 February 1844.\n\nMissionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints carried the gospel message to their home. Sarah Ann was convinced of the truthfulness of their message, and with her brothers she and her baby began their journey to Utah with a group of Saints under the leadership of Captain Thomas Casper.\n\nHer husband, Mr. Sellew, had not been converted to the teachings of the missionaries, nor was he willing to have his child taken from him. In company with others he overtook the travelers and demanded that his child be returned to him, threatening violence if his demand was denied.\n\nMuch has been written concerning the trials and sorrows of the Latter-day Saint pioneers, and we know some of the Scripture which must have influenced them. We read from Matthew: 10:37, \"He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.\" These people were students of the Bible, and had been instructed by the missionaries through revelations given by our Heavenly Father to the Prophet Joseph Smith, that they should be gathered together, for example, Doctrine and Covenants: 45:64, \"Wherefore I, the Lord, have said, gather ye out from the eastern lands, assemble ye yourselves together ye elders of my church, go ye forth into the western countries, call upon the inhabitants to repent, and inasmuch as they do repent, build up churches unto me.\"\n\nGrandmother was certainly being tested. She did not make the decision alone. Her captain advised that she return the child to her(it's) father stating that he felt sure they would again be united. Her test was a difficult one, but her decision was made, and she was obedient to authority. The reunion did not come in this life.\n\nMilo Andrus, Senior and Sarah Ann Miles (Sellew) were married 1 January 1848, and were sealed 27 February 1848, at Winter Quarters by Brigham Young. They left shortly for a mission to England. Milo, Jr. was born 1 October 1848, at Liverpool, England.\n\nI have recently re-written Grandfather's diary which he kept from February 1849 until his return to Council Bluffs, Iowa 21 April 1850. On frequent dates he mentioned that his wife and child were in poor health.\n\nOn the homeward voyage, Grandmother and her baby were sick most of the time, and Grandfather stated that it was through the blessings of our Heavenly\n\nFather that their lives were spared.\n\nThey crossed the Atlantic in a sailboat, \"The Argo.\" The trip required eight weeks and three days from Liverpool to New Orleans. They sailed up the Mississippi River on board the steamer, \"Uncle Sam\" and landed in Kanesville in May. Grandfather was chosen Captain over fifty-five wagons to make the trip to Salt Lake Valley. They arrived in Salt Lake City 21 August 1850.\n\nI quote from Grandfather's diary: \"When I contemplate the many hardships that the Church has gone through, it causes me to marvel that so many have lived as have and taken the pressure.\" Well might he have been thinking of the sufferings and afflictions of his own dear wife--separation from husband and child, years of ill health for herself and baby far from friends and relatives and deprived of a comfortable home, proper food, nursing, and medical care. She died 28 November 1851 and was among the first to be buried in the Holladay Cemetery in Utah.\n\nMilo, Junior was very anxious to learn of his sister and advertised in the newspaper at Fairfiel Illinois. The clipping was sent by a friend to Lavinia Maria Cameron in Glastonbury, Connecticut which resulted in correspondence during the fall and winter of 1890 and 1891.\n\nHer letters reflected a person of high ideals with an interest in education, and desire to live by the teachings of the Congregational Church of which she was a member.\n\nMilo, Jr. lived an exemplary life of kindness and service to others, using the principles of the gospel as taught by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as his guide.\n\nLavinia Maria and Milo are her only children and \"by their fruits ye shall know them\".\n\nLetter from Ohio State Historical Society: \"Salisbury, a village in Salisbury twp., was located in Meigs County. It is located 16 miles from Gallipolis, Gallia County. Meigs County was formed in 1819 from Gallia and Athens County.\n\n1. Temple Records Index Bureau cards\n\n2.
