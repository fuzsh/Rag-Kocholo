        "text": "Welcome back to the soap opera!\n\nThose Bad NADs…they’ve done it AGAIN. Yep, they’re back. You remember…it was right after April’s Fool’s Day and Ancestry gifted me with two New Ancestor Discoveries that weren’t – Diedamia Lyon and John David Curnutte. Then, a couple months later, ungrateful houseguests that they were, they disappeared one night, never to be seen again…well…until now.\n\nBut because Ancestry must have thought I was lonely, they assigned me three additional bad NADs to take their place. Now, the good news was that while these three were indeed Bad NADS and not actual new ancestor discoveries – there was a silver lining to this cloud. Even though these NADs aren’t my ancestors – at least I was able to document some ways to figure out why and how bad NADs are assigned – so hopefully you can work through your NADS too.\n\nBut apparently, John and Diedamia weren’t at all happy with the accommodations where they were residing after disappearing in June, so they snuck back sometime overnight. Yep, they’re back. I woke up, and there they were, staring at me, just like they had never been gone. When I was a kid, on the farm, anything that showed up like this was always pregnant. Diedamia, do you have something to tell me???\n\nThe guest room is getting quite full now…with 5 Bad NADs in residence – all impostors – claiming to be related to me. Why, you’d think I had won the lottery or something…\n\nI took a look, again, at Diedamia and John, utilizing the same tools that I used to determine that John Larimer and Jean Larimer weren’t my ancestors – nor was Robert Shiflet. But given that I have only two actual DNA matches with descendants of Diedamia and John, and we don’t show any other common family links that I can discern – I was unable to figure out why I have a DNA link to two of John and Diedamia’s descendants. Perhaps there is a common ancestor upstream someplace that will become evident one day. Or, maybe it’s like Robert Shiflet and I’m descended through the wife’s siblings, or like the Larimers where my McKee matches also match the Larimer line. One thing is for sure, Diedamia Lyons and John Curnutte are not my ancestors. How I’m related to them, if I’m related to them, is yet to be determined. Maybe that will be a future episode of the soap opera. What shall we call this mini-series? As the NADs Return???\n\nIt will be interesting to see how long John and Diedamia, and for that matter, my other bad NADs, hang around this time. Seems like I have a bit of a NAD revolving door. One thing is for sure….it’s interesting to see who is waiting for me every day.\n\nSo, let’s update the NAD Scoreboard:\n\nAncestry – 0\n\nBad NADs – 7\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nDisclosure\n\nI receive a small contribution when you click on some of the links to vendors in my articles.
