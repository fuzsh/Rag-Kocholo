        "text": "Robert Milo Andrus was born and raised in Utah. He caught the acting bug at an early age. His passion for film and television only grew with his years. Shortly after graduating from high school, he found an agent and ongoing acting class. It was then that he began auditioning for film and television projects.\n\nRobert moved to Los Angeles to follow his dreams and the footsteps of so many others in 2002. After a few months he landed the role of “Joe” in This Lime Tree Bower, a play by Conor McPherson. Reviews were favorable including LA Weekly’s “Pick of the Week” and flattering writeup touting “Andrus is perfectly cast as the sensitive Joe, with an Irish accent so accurate it occasionally lapses into impenetrability.”\n\nAn opportunity manifested in Wyoming that would prove to provide amazing working and personal relationships. In 2005, an Indie movie “Dead Noon” began production and Andrus was cast in the role of “Stuart Kane”, a Deputy Sheriff of a small town, with a chip on his shoulder and shoot first ask questions later mentality. Directing and Producing team, Andrew Wiest and Matthew Taggart, would become great friends and work with Robert many times over. Ultimately, Dead Noon would be distributed by Lionsgate Entertainment through Barnholtz Entertainment.\n\nSince then, Robert has produced a collection of award-winning educational videos and several feature films including collaborations with Andrew Wiest and Ryan Reed (The Adventures of Chris Fable and Treasure State) and currently, The Forlorned.\n\nRobert is now living in Utah and is the Casting Associate for Jeff Johnson Casting, Utah’s premiere casting office. Robert has since worked on castings for Disney’s High School Musical 2, High School Musical 3: Senior Year, and Cloud 9. He has also done castings for multiple movies starring the likes of Robert DuVall, Katherine Heigl, Sam Rockwell, Cary Elwes, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo, Sheryl Lee, Danny Glover, C. Thomas Howell, Burt Reynolds, Kristy Swanson, Kevin Sorbo, and many more."
