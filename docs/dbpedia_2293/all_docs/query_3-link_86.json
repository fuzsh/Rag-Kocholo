        "meta_description": "She made it to 70! Janette Andrus Fowden passed away on September 11, 2023. Janette was born in Spanish Fork, Utah on August 29, 1953, to Milo C and Geraldine Larsen Andrus.  She was raised in Spanish Fork and graduated from Spanish Fork High School. Janette was a member of the infamous Solito club, where she made many lifelong friends. Janette married Curtis Fowden on July 30, 1976. They lived in Santaquin and raised two sons that Janette was so proud of. Janette was a hard worker at various jobs during her life, but her favorite job was Grandma to Milo, Isaac, Leo, and Lennox. Janette took her job as Grandma seriously. She wanted to spend as much time as possible with them and always found ways to be an involved grandma. School functions, sporting events, weekend sleepovers, and holiday bingo all bear her memory with those four lucky kiddos. Speaking of bingo, she adored volunteering at the Santaquin Senior Center. There, she honed in her bingo calling skills. She loved spending time with her Seniors and treasured the friendships she gained there. She loved the outdoors, unless, of course, it was windy. On Mother’s Day, you would find her on the golf course with her family, chasing down wayward balls in the sand pit or in the thick grass. She loved sharing the outdoors with her family, especially her grandkids. She took them to go fishing, on nature walks, and even helped her grandkids find snakes and lizards! If you saw her in Mesquite or Wendover, you might have noticed her black and blue knuckles. Don’t worry, she wasn’t in fist fights, it was for good luck! To get the slot machines to call correctly, she would knock on the window and yell “get on the line” or “come on, purple bitches”. She definitely made playing slot machines more fun. Janette had a sixth sense for finding good deals. She loved shopping and was famous for all the trinkets she found. She loved shopping trips with her mom and sisters. Those trips were always full of laughter and unforgettable memories. As dedicated as a grandma she was, Janette loved her husband, Curtis, wholeheartedly. When he was deployed, she did everything she could to keep him close to the family; she even figured out Skype for video calls when he was away! Once he retired, they enjoyed golfing, camping, and spending time together. Janette is survived by her devoted husband, Curtis, her sons Cole and Sarah Fowden with Milo and Isaac, and Clint and Christina Fowden with Leo and Lennox. Her siblings Todd and Carolyn Andrus, Terry and Sandi Andrus, Pat Christianson and Marty Warren. She was preceded in death by her parents, Milo and Gerry, mother-in-law Frances Gull, brothers-in-law Frank and Rod, and nephew Thom. A funeral service will be held on Tuesday, September 19, 2023, at 11 a.m. at Walker Funeral Home, 187 South Main Street in Spanish Fork, Utah.
