He married Abigail Jane Daley (1815-1894) 14 February 1833 in Florence, Erie County, Ohio, United States. He married Sarah Ann Miles (1818-1851) 1 January 1848 in Winter Quarters, Douglas County, Nebraska, United States. He married Lucy Loomis (1822-1890) 1 June 1851 in Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah, United States. He married Adaline Alexander (1835-1911) . He married Mary Ann Webster (1834-1903) . He married Jane Lancaster Munday (1832-1900) . He married Elizabeth Brooks (-) . He married Ann Brooks (1832-1913) . He married Margaret Ann Boyce (1840-1901) . He married Mary Emma Covert (1842-1897) . He married Francenia Lucy Tuttle (1845-1872) .\n\nReligious Awakening (LDS)\n\nThe 1830's saw a great Protestant religious revival sweep across the United States that was called the \"Second Great Awakening\" and was characterized by much emotional preaching, spiritual and social reform movements and a surge in membership growth for a great many Christian denominations.\n\nThis period also saw the rise of a new Church of Christ that was organized in early 1830 by its young prophet-leader, Joseph Smith (1805-1844), and after 1838 was formally named The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This church group was frequently called the \"Mormon Church\" or \"Latter-day Saints\" (LDS) for its belief in a new set of holy scriptures called \"The Book of Mormon\". For better or worse, this new religion generated a lot of attention in this region.\n\nMissionaries of this church taught that it was not a reform movement or protest movement but a \"restoration\" of the original church with completeness of the full of doctrine of the gospel of Jesus Christ including the ministering of angels, the restored priesthood, lost scripture, revelations, prophecy, living apostles, the gifts of the spirit and much more. This message had profound impact on many who subsequently left all to follow the Prophet and the Church. In many cases their faith was so strong as to push these early converts to endure many difficult hardships and sacrifices and to eventually journey over a thousand miles westward to settle in the Great Salt Lake Valley. (See also New Religion (LDS 1830).)[1][2]\n\nMilo joined the Church of Christ in 1832 in Florence, Ohio (about one year before his first marriage). He was one of the members of Zion's Camp (1834). He helped build the Kirtland, Nauvoo, Salt Lake, and Saint George Temples. He served as a missionary in England in the early 1840s. He led three wagon trains of Mormon pioneers from the Midwest to the Salt Lake Valley (1850, 1855, and 1861). He was a Bishop in Nauvoo, Illinois, a Stake President in St. Louis, a member of the Quorum of the Seventy, and was serving as a Patriarch at his death.\n\nZions Camp Participant\n\nOne of the most interesting episodes in the early history of LDS Church was the march of Zion's Camp (1834). The members of the Church in Missouri were being persecuted, and the Prophet Joseph made it a matter of prayer and received a revelation on February 24, 1834. The Lord instructed the Prophet to assemble at least one hundred young and middle-aged men and to go to the land of Zion, or Missouri. (See D&C 130:19–34.)\n\nZion’s Camp, a group of approximately one hundred and fifty men, gathered at Kirtland, Ohio, in the spring of 1834 and marched to Jackson County, Missouri. By the time they reached Missouri, the camp had increased to approximately two hundred men.\n\nLDS Quorum of Seventy\n\nCreated by the Mormon Prophet Joseph Smith (1805-1844) in early 1835, the Quorum of Seventy was to act as traveling and presiding ministers for the newly created The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Many of these men performed notable works for the early church, living near then church headquarters in Kirtland, Ohio. The Quorum of Seventy itself did not meet as a governing body of the church and was not renewed until reorganized by the church in 1976.\n\nBecause of his faithful service in Zions Camp, Milo was ordained to the Quorum of Seventy and was one its original members in 1835.\n\nMormon Trail Pioneer\n\nIn 1854, Andrus recommended that a new outfitting site for emigrants going to Utah be situated four miles west of the soon-to-be-town Atchison, Kansas. Cholera at previous outfitting sites necessitated this new location. It was called Mormon Grove and was near the Missouri River and Atchison. Atchison needed laborers to build and the emigrants needed work to earn money to outfit themselves for the overland trip to Utah, so this was a good place for an outfitting site.[2] Milo Andrus oversaw the site in 1855. One hundred-sixty acres were obtained and a sod fence was built around it. Thirty to forty acres were planted so that the incoming emigrants would have food. The planted acreage was called the Perpetual Emigration Farm and soon Mormon Grove became a tent city.[3] That year 2,041 people and 337 wagons left for Utah with Andrus leading one of the wagon trains.[4] While in St. Louis, he preached many sermons. Among those who joined the church due to his preaching was Heinrich Eyring, who would later become a long-serving president of the Indian Territory Mission in Oklahoma, and who was the grandfather of the chemist Henry Eyring.[5]\n\nAndrus was a major in the Nauvoo Legion during the Utah War and was a chaplain of the Utah State Legislature. He built many roads in Utah and Southern Idaho.\n\nMarriage & Family\n\nLike many early Latter Day Saints, Andrus was a polygamist; he had eleven wives and fifty-seven children.\n\n1st wife: Abigail Smith\n\nOn 14-Feb-1833, he married Abigail Jane Daley (1815-1894) in Florence, Ohio.\n\n2nd wife: Sarah Ann Miles\n\nOn 01-Jan-1848, he married Sarah Ann Miles (1818-1851) in Winters Quarters NE. She died soon after the birth of their one child.\n\n3rd wife: Lucy Loomis\n\nOn 01-June-1851, he married widow Lucy Loomis (1822-1890) in SLC, Utah.\n\nMore marriages\n\nOn 1852 - he married Adaline Alexander (1835-1911) in Tennessee\n\nOn 23-Dec-1852, he married Mary Ann Webster (1834-1903) in SLC, Utah.\n\nOn 22 Nov 1855, he married Jane Lancaster Munday (1832-1900) in SLC, Utah\n\n... he married Elizabeth Brooks\n\nOn 22-Nov-1855, he Married Ann Brooks (1832-1913) in SLC UT\n\nOn 15-Feb-1857, he married Margaret Ann Boyce (1840-1901) in SLC Utah\n\nOn 28-Feb-1858, he married Mary Emma Covert (1842-1897) in SLC Utah\n\nOn 06-Dec-1862, he married Francenia Lucy Tuttle (1845-1872) in SLC Utah.
