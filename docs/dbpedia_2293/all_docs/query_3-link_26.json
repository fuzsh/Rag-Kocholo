        "text": "In one of the profiles that I recently adopted, a man has 74 children. He's an early Utah settler, I assume, and his biography says that he had 57 children, meaning that some need to be merged.\n\nThe problem that I encounter here is, that some children that look like obvious merge candidates have different mothers, and are therefore hard to assign to the right one. On FamilySearch I can find census record with their names, but no births or baptisms, and it looks like census papers were made for individual couples, which can then be interpreted as linking the children with their biological mothers. Is that right?\n\nI have no idea of early habits, whether children were always put in a census with their biological mother, or more like distributed so that every mother would take care of the same amount of children, or as many as she could handle at the time, which is why I ask.\n\nIf there is no easy answer, I will merge children where appropriate, and add the other mother to the biography."
