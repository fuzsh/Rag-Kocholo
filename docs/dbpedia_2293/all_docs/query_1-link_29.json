        "text": "By Leone Andrus Taylor. This Volume is a compilation of family group records and life sketches of Milo Andrus, Jr. and his wife, Elizabeth Boyes Andrus, together with their parents and children, and the mates of their children. 366 pages. Original was 6″ x 9″, copy is two pages on 8.5″ x 11″.\n\nWe have been printing family histories for over 50 years. We have an office copy of most of those books and can make a copy for you. We then bind it with your choice of binding. We have four options, coil binding is the most popular, hard binding is the best but it takes three weeks to print and bind your copy, our soft cover is a staple and tape binding, and the last option is to have a PDF copy on a CD (the PDF is a scanned image of the printed pages of the original book).\n\nDescription\n\nWe are out of business and no longer have products, but we have a digital PDF copy of most histories that we can email a link to you to download. If you would like a PDF copy, send an email to cs@sgenealogy.com with the request. There is no charge for this service."
