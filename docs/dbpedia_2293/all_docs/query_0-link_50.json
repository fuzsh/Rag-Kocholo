        "text": "Crimson Cliffs coach Wayne Alofipo doesn’t believe his team should be the favorite to repeat as Region 9 champs after graduating almost all of its starters a year ago. He thinks the favorite label should go to more experienced teams like Desert Hills and Dixie.\n\nHis Region 9 peers aren’t in agreement.\n\nAll but one Region 9 coach believes Crimson Cliffs tabbed the defending 4A state champion Mustangs as the front runner in the Southern Utah region in 2024.\n\nCrimson Cliffs reached the semis in 2021, lost in the championship in 2022 and then won the championship in 2023. It’s been a steady progression for the school now entering its sixth season.\n\nWhat Crimson Cliffs lacks in returning starters, it makes up for it in so many other areas.\n\n“There’s a lot of excitement in the community and in the program, and even down to the little league, there’s a belief. With everything we’ve done, there’s a standard now that people have to live up to, and that’s starts with us as coaches, we have to live up to that and push and continue to raise the bar,” said Alofipo, whose team returns one offensive starter and two defensive starters.\n\nIt has the pieces to live up to that expectation again.\n\nEven though Crimson Cliffs graduated 42 seniors from a year ago, Alofipo said the team has roughly 40 seniors on the team this year. They will make up the bulk of the replacement starters this year after they waited their turn at the junior varsity level. And many of those same players got mop-up duty in the second half last season when the coaching stuff pulled starters amid blowout wins.\n\n“I can’t tell you we have the same level of talent we had last year, but we do have a lot of talent. It’s just different. That’s what’s so sweet and fun about high school. Our job as coaches is you’re going to get a variety of talent and weakness, and our job is to figure out who we are this year,” said Alofipo.\n\nA year ago Crimson Cliffs won the region and state title with the top scoring offense and defense in 4A.\n\nThat efficiency on both sides of the ball ensured that a Region 9 team won the state title for the second straight season after a five-year drought from 2017-2021 .\n\nCrimson Cliffs isn’t the only team capable of making a run at a Region 9 3-peat.\n\nDesert Hills returns roughly half its starters from a year ago, including 2,000-yard rusher Tytan Mason. Snow Canyon has a mix of experience and quality newcomers to make a run at a region title. Dixie has a similar mix, and veteran coach Blaine Monkres’ teams are all always in the mix.\n\nAll four schools finished tied for second in Region 9 a year ago with 4-2 records in region.\n\n“We have a few returners from last year that I am excited to see how they have developed in a year. Kids have been working hard in the weight room in the off season. Hopefully we have enough players to compete in a very tough region,” said Monkres, who is entering is 34th season as head coach.\n\nWhile Monkres has 33 years of head coaching experience in Utah, the other six coaches have a combined 28 years of experience. Sixteen of those weren’t even Region 9.\n\nHurricane’s new coach Jerry Cowan coached at Duchesne for 16 total seasons with a record of 155-44 and four 1A state championships.\n\n“Hurricane won the lottery with their new coach in Jerry Cowan. He just oozes winning,” said Alofipo.\n\nHurricane hasn’t won a state title since 2011, but the younger ages were extremely talented last year which gives Cowan a quality foundation to try and build the program back up.\n\nCedar is another school with a new head coach as Tre Hiatt is taking over the Reds program. All of his previous coaching experience has been at the high school level, including last year as the offensive coordinator at SUU.\n\n“We’ll have teams with veteran coaches that want to show that their programs are solid and continue to excel. There will be those teams with new coaches wanting to make their mark in region and beyond. In all it should add up for an exciting season full of competition, fun, some disappointment and joy,” said Desert Hills coach Solomona Tapasa.\n\nRegion 9 projections\n\n(Preseason rankings are based on coaches’ votes)\n\n1. Crimson Cliffs Mustangs\n\n2024 Schedule\n\nHead coach: Wayne Alofipo\n\nIn two seasons as head coach, he’s led Crimson Cliffs to a 23-4 record including a runner-up finish in 2022 and a state championship in 2023. He’s a graduate of West High School and Dixie State University.\n\nCoach Wayne Alofipo’s general outlook\n\nWe are excited for our challenge this year to replace 19 starters from last year’s team. We have a lot of young men who are competing and eager to fill those spots and roles. IQ will play a big factor to help us with lack of varsity experience that we will have this year but that will fall primarily on us coaches to help these young men improve in that regard and have them ready to compete. Fortunately these young men have had such great examples of what the standard and expectations since we became a program for what it takes to be successful on and off the field.\n\nOffensive coordinator: Andy Stokes\n\n2023 offense: 44.57 ppg (No. 1 in 4A)\n\nTwo returning starters\n\nSpread offense\n\nReturning offensive starters\n\nEaston Webster\n\nMalakai Alofipo\n\nMcCord Christiansen\n\nKey offensive newcomers\n\nMaddux Alofipo\n\nCaiden Garcia-Casey\n\nBoston Barrows\n\nDefensive coordinator: Wayne Alofipo\n\n2023 defense: 11.36 ppg (No. 1 in 4A)\n\nOne returning starters\n\n3-4 defense\n\nReturning defensive starters\n\nMcKay Wright\n\nKey defensive newcomers\n\nMax Griffiths\n\nBrayden Smith\n\nKayson Cuff\n\n2. Desert Hills Thunder\n\n2024 Schedule\n\nHead coach: Solomona Tapasa\n\nBrought a wealth of college coaching experience to his first season last year at Desert Hills as the Thunder posted a 7-5 record. Most recently he was an assistant coach at Southern Utah University.\n\nCoach Solomona Tapasa’s general outlook\n\nWe are excited for this upcoming season. Our team has put more time and effort into this offseason than we have seen in awhile. Even though we had a good number of multi year starters move on, we have a really good group returning this year. We return a number of starters on both sides of the ball but also have some good athletes that got heavy varsity rotation last season that now have their chance to be in that first group. Defensively we were very young last year with multiple sophomores and juniors in the starting lineup. Those young guys grew a lot and have now become experienced contributors as part of a senior heavy group. Collectively they have a greater grasp on what is expected defensively. on offense we return one or two players in each position group. That dynamic has already provided some much needed leadership and consistency. The new comers have had great tutors to get up to speed on what it takes to compete at the varsity level. Special Teams also benefit from returning our kicker, punter and the long snapper that finished last season, with a number of potential guys to handle the return duties. Of coarse you always feel better when your team leaders are not only exceptional athletes but also extraordinary young men.\n\nOffensive coordinator: Sam Stevens\n\n2023 offense: 32.5 ppg (No. 7 in 4A)\n\nSix returning starters\n\nSpread offense\n\nReturning offensive starters\n\nTytan Mason, Sr., RB\n\nGarritt Grondel, Sr., QB\n\nTopper Pattison, Sr., WR\n\nSimon Fuailetolo, Sr., LT\n\nAlec Tafua, Sr., LG\n\nAustin Wintle, Sr., TE\n\nKey offensive newcomers\n\nTrey Hortin, Sr., WR\n\nLuke Bolli, Sr., RG\n\nMichael Vandermyde, Jr., RT\n\nGavin Young, Jr., WR\n\nDefensive coordinator: Solomona Tapasa\n\n2023 defense: 26.58 ppg (No. 14 in 4A)\n\nFour returning starters\n\n4-3 defense\n\nReturning defensive starters\n\nCyrus Polu, Sr., S/LB\n\nCooper Clark, Sr., CB/S\n\nAnyzja Cummings, Jr., CB\n\nBeau Meredith, Jr., LB\n\nKey defensive newcomers\n\nIsaac Borgeson, Sr., DE\n\nRyker May, Sr., LB\n\nBroc Mooy, Sr., LB\n\nZach Darger, Jr., S\n\n3. Snow Canyon Warriors\n\n2024 Schedule\n\nHead coach: Mike Esplin\n\nEntering his eighth season as head coach at Snow Canyon where his teams have posted a 45-29 record the past seven years. He’s a graduate of Snow Canyon High School and the University of Utah.\n\nCoach Mike Esplin’s general outlook\n\nWe look forward to this coming season and the team we have coming. We have had kids step up & learn how to be leaders. We have a team that is dedicated to the weight room & training. We have returners coming back in key positions & enough numbers to have depth. The last push of our off season done right will put us in a good position for game 1. We plan to get better every rep.\n\nOffensive coordinator: Tim Nowatzke\n\n2023 offense: 26.64 ppg (No. 15 in 4A)\n\nSix returning starters\n\nMultiple offenses\n\nReturning offensive starters\n\nJT Westbrook, Sr., WR\n\nArchie Threlfall, Sr., WR\n\nMax Reynolds, Sr., RB\n\nHank West, Jr., OL\n\nAndrew Castro, Sr., OL\n\nCael Johnson, Sr., WR\n\nKey offensive newcomers\n\nKarsten Stuart, Sr., WR\n\nJoseph Smith, Sr., QB\n\nCael Esplin, Jr., RB\n\nJaxton Hansen, Jr., OL\n\nPorter Terry, Jr., OL\n\nCam Hill, Jr., WR\n\nDefensive coordinator: Mike Esplin\n\n2023 defense: 21.55 ppg (No. 7 in 4A)\n\nThree returning starters\n\nMultiple defenses\n\nReturning defensive starters\n\nRyder Ence, Sr., DB\n\nTrey Vaughn, Jr., DL\n\nArchie Threlfall, Sr., DB\n\nKey defensive newcomers\n\nMax Reynolds, Sr., LB\n\nCael Esplin, Jr., LB\n\nMaika Tahu, Sr., DL\n\nEaston Nowatzke, Jr., DB\n\nCalen Kelly, Sr., LB\n\nPorter Hutchings, Jr., LB\n\n4.
