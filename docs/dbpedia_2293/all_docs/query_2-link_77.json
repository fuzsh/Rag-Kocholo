        "text": "He played in Taylor Doose‘s The Man Who Loved Flowers Dollar Baby film as The Man.\n\nSKSM: Could you start with telling me a little bit about yourself? Who are you and what do you do?\n\nRobert Milo Andrus: My name is Robert Andrus. Ever since I can remember, I have been drawn to television and film. I have been in the film industry for over 20 years now and can tell you that I love what I do. I am an actor, acting coach, associate casting director and producer.\n\nSKSM: When did you know you wanted to become an actor?\n\nRobert Milo Andrus: I did a community play with my family, “Annie Get Your Gun”. The thrill of entrances and exits, all the attention pre- and post- show. It was exciting and engaging and amazing. Once, I heard the applause, I was hooked.\n\nSKSM: How did you become involved in The man who loved flowers Dollar Baby film?\n\nRobert Milo Andrus: I heard about the audition through our acting community and auditioned for the role. I had worked with the producer prior to auditioning, so thought it would be fun.\n\nSKSM: What do you think it is about the story that attracts people so much?\n\nRobert Milo Andrus: Stephen King is a legend, so that was attractive to me. Also, the title is intriguing. The story, I think the story has a way to connect the audience to the Man and his journey.\n\nSKSM: Did you have to audition for the part or was it written directly for you?\n\nRobert Milo Andrus: I auditioned for the role with a monologue that I’ve had (in the back of my mind) for over 20 years. It is one of my first acing monologues. It is a fun one to dust off when given the opportunity.\n\nSKSM: You worked with Taylor Doose on this film, how was that?\n\nRobert Milo Andrus: It was a great experience to work with Taylor Doose. I lovingly refer to him as Doose. He is a great guy and we’ve since worked on several projects. I’ll work with him anytime!\n\nSKSM: Was there any funny or special moment when they made the movie that you would like to tell me about?\n\nRobert Milo Andrus: One of the scenes was filmed in and near the parking lot of my first Junior High School. I found that to be disturbing… and nostalgic.\n\nSKSM: Do you still have any contact with the crew/cast from that time? If so with who?\n\nRobert Milo Andrus: I do. I even officiated a wedding that brought several of the cast and crew back together.\n\nSKSM: What are you working on nowadays?\n\nRobert Milo Andrus: I have a alien-western project on the horizon and have a comedy-western due out soon. Lots of irons in the fire – so to speak. I am also\n\nSKSM: Are you a fan of Stephen King’s work?\n\nRobert Milo Andrus: Yes! Carrie! The Stand! Misery! The Shining! The Green Mile! Firestarter! Yes!\n\nSKSM: What is one thing people would be surprised to know about you?\n\nRobert Milo Andrus: I’ve grown out my hair 3 times and donated it to charity 2 times.\n\nSKSM: Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions. Is there anything you want to say to the fans that read this interview?\n\nRobert Milo Andrus: Thank you!\n\nSKSM: Do you like to add anything else?"
