        "text": "Cessna Crane\n\nThe Cessna T-50 Crane was the RCAF version of the Cessna AT-17 Bobcat, a twin-engined advanced trainer designed and made in the USA during the Second World War. It served to bridge the gap between single-engined trainers and twin-engined combat aircraft.\n\nFirst flown in 1939, the American-built Cessna Crane was developed as a five-seat, light transport civilian aircraft. It was originally intended to serve only a minor role within the BCATP (an initial 180 were ordered in 1940) until the Canadian-built Avro Ansons became available in greater numbers. This was the first large order that Cessna had received for one of its products. Eventually, more than 5,400 Cranes would be produced, of which 826 saw service with the RCAF. Cessna Cranes were used primarily to teach future bomber pilots, after they had received their initial training, to fly multi-engined aircraft at Service Flying Training Schools in western Canada.\n\nPowered by 245-horsepower Jacobs R-755-9 radial engines, Cessna Cranes featured wooden wings and tail married to a fuselage constructed of welded steel tubing. Most of the aircraft was fabric-covered. It was cheap, reliable and relatively easy to fly, with a top speed of 315 kilometres (195 miles) per hour.\n\nThe Crane provided twin-engined complexity with economy of operation and went on to become one of the most important aircraft used by the BCATP. Cranes continued to serve with the RCAF until 1947, after which many were purchased by private individuals and companies.\n\nNicknamed the Bamboo Bomber because of its largely wood construction, the Crane had a reputation as a stable and reliable aircraft. Although not an ideal training aircraft because of its poor single-engined performance and load-carrying capability, it performed its duties satisfactorily and helped train several thousand bomber pilots.

I 8087\n\nFirst assigned to No. 11 Service Flying Training School at Yorkton, Saskatchewan. Category A crash during a training flight at 16:00 on 11 May 1942. Heavily damaged by post impact fire. Scrapped by No. 11 SFTS.\n\n1941-11-05 Taken on Strength No. 2 Training Command 2019-08-20\n\n1942-May-11 Accident: 11 Service Flying Training School Loc: Rhein Saskatchewan Names: Andrus | Martin | McCowan\n\n1942-05-25 Struck off Strength Struck off, reduced to spares and produce 2019-08-20\n\n11 SFTS (11 Service Flying Training School)\n\nGraduates of the EFTS \"learn-to-fly\" program went on a Service Flying Training School (SFTS) for 16 weeks. For the first 8 weeks the trainee was part of an intermediate training squadron; for the next 6 weeks an advanced training squadron and for the final 2 weeks training was conducted at a Bombing & Gunnery School. The Service schools were military establishments run by the RCAF or the RAF.\n\nThere were two different types of Service Flying Training Schools. Trainees in the fighter pilot stream went to an SFTS like No. 14 Aylmer, where they trained in the North American Harvard or North American Yale. Trainees in the bomber, coastal or transport pilot stream went to an SFTS like No. 5 Brantford where they learned multi-engine technique in an Airspeed Oxford, Avro Anson or Cessna Crane.\n\nFor more Information on RCAF Station Yorkton see here\n\nRCAF.Info - RCAF Station Yorkton SK\n\nRCAF.Info - Relief Landing Field Sturdee SK\n\nRCAF.Info - Relief Landing Field Rhein SK\n\n11 SFTS Yorkton SK History\n\nSaskatchewan Virtual War Memorial - 11 SFTS Yorkton History\n\nVintage Wings - Ghosts of Saskatchewan"
