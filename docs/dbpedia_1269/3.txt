So yeah, Bunbury has a great singular voice that we will probably never differentiate from legendary Heroes del Silencio, but he has never been a music genius like many claim he continues to be. Just like I like Gustavo Cerati better solo than with Soda Stereo, Bunbury is a lot more sober when working alone. Truth is, I’m never been a fan, but it came pretty damn close when he joined the underrated Nacho Vegas some years ago. Helleville De Luxe is already being accused of plagiarism by several writers, Bunbury acknowledge using some verses but doesn’t consider that to me morally wrong. Whatever the outcome is, this album isn’t sustained by any extraordinary lyricism or melody for that matter. When the titles of the songs are the highlight of an album, it really shows how uninspired and empty the album is. His previous offer El Viaje a Ninguna Parte was at least classy enough to self-title its purpose. We’re not asking Bunbury to renovate himself, but perhaps he should extend his playlist so we don’t get the exact same album over and over. The best we’ve heard Bunbury in the last decade is featured in Lila Down’s Shake Away, he is brilliant in the track “Justicia.” Bunbury always accentuates his guitar arrangements, a landmark of traditional rock that’s best presented in the first single “El hombre que delgado que no flaqueara jamas.” Helleville De Luxe is like the recent recycled works by Julio Iglesias or Roberto Carlos, just wearing a cool leather jacket and dark sun glasses. Okay, fans will not like me comparing him to pop artists, so I’ll compare it with the new album by Oasis, to groove and boring.

Don’t buy it.
