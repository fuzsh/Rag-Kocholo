Bunbury, Lafourcade, Morrison y Café Tacvba lideran Vive Latino 2016. When he first walked on stage, the audience was a see of bright lights radiating from smart phones taking videos, which usually bothers me throughout a performance, so it was great when Bunbury encouraged everyone to put them away saying ‘are you here to see me, or to tell the internet you’re seeing me’, which was cool! He opened the show with some tracks from Palosanto, the newest album, and sang a great combination of tracks from his newer and older work. His dance moves are also extremely entertaining as he interacts with his band members, and shouts at the audience to join in. The almost 50 years old artist has more energy and stage presence than I’ve seen from many artists half his age, and he commands the audiences attention from the moment he steps on the stage.īunbury has an incredible voice, and the way that he manipulates its rocky sound is original and refreshing.
