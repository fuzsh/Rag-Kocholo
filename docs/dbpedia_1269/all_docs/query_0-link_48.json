        "text": "Get your air guitar out with Phil Manzanera’s “Ritmo De Los Angeles”!\n\nPhil Manzanera releases his new song “Ritmo De Los Angeles” from his album Primitive Guitars. The solely instrumental song definitely does not lack any lyrical elements as it is filled with a great electric guitar melody and a strong, syncopated bass. This song will definitely get you grooving. With 1970s rock elements that you would hear from Led Zeppelin, Phil Manzanera creates timeless music that comes from the soul. In Manzanera’s music, you can hear the Latin American influences that he grew up hearing and living.\n\nManzanera’s single “Ritmo De Los Angeles” is reminiscent of the rock god from the 70s and 80s. During a song, there comes the instrumental, where the rocker goes into his own world and creates amazing sounds. Phil Manzanera does this; however, not just in the ‘instrumental’, but throughout the entire song.\n\nYou can check out Phil Manzanera and the rest of his music at the following sites:\n\nwww.AirPlayDirect.com/philmanzanera\n\nwww.manzanera.com\n\nwww.allmusic.com/album/primitive-guitars-mw0000263023\n\nwww.myspace.com/firebirdv11\n\nwww.facebook.com/philmanzanera\n\nABOUT PHIL MANZANERA\n\nPhil Manzanera is one of the UK’s best-known musicians and record producers, having shot to prominence in the early ‘70’s as the lead guitarist with Roxy Music.
