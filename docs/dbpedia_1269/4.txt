Bunbury, the emblematic and enduring Spanish rocker, plays a rare London show in support of his recent Expectativas album.

The man born Enrique Ortiz de Landázuri Izarduy in Zaragoza, began recording music in 1984. Initially, Bunbury was lead singer for the hugely influential Rock In Español group Héroes del Silencio. After the group’s extraordinarily successful run ended in 1996, Bunbury struck out as a solo star with the release of 1997’s Radical Sonora.

As opposed to his prior hard rock and Gothic influences, Sonora showed off Bunbury’s interest in industrial and electronic music. Since then, the talented singer-songwriter has put out nine more studio albums which have incorporated a diverse array of influences including blues, flamenco, cabaret and tango.

He has continually expanded his horizons as an artist, crossing musical boundaries with a restless exploration of different forms. In Pequeño (1999), Bunbury fused his Arabic and Latin American roots with songs like Infinito and El Viento a Favor which are both poetic and melodic. In 2004 he recorded El Viaje a Ninguna Parte, full of the Pan-American sounds he likes most, from Argentina and Brazil to New Orleans, jazz and cumbia and tango. In Hellville Deluxe (2008), he worked within North American sonorities, adding border touches and small Latin details. In Licenciado Cantinas (2012), he revisited the work of Willie Colon, Hector Lavoe, Louie Ortega and Atahualpa Yupanqui, to tell stories of heartbreak and death, with hot rhythms and poetry with groove.

In 2017, Bunbury released Expectativas, his most ambitious, radical and innovative album to date; more critical, more scathing, more sonorous and at the same time more intuitive and hopeful than before.
