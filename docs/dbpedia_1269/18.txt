Fourteen years after launching his solo career, Enrique Bunbury set off on his longest US tour to date, breaking new ground for Spanish-language artists in North America. Bringing his eclectic Latin-rock ensemble to cities such as Boston, New York, Detroit and Chicago, Bunbury attempted to find a new audience – but, arguably, ended up finding himself, as the tour ended up having a profound effect on the man.

“It’s time from you to retreat from the situation right now and take something in your life to a higher level,” a clairvoyant tells him while on the road. While touring his then latest album, 2010’s Las Consecuencias, Bunbury did just that, becoming the first Spanish musician to play to more than 90,000 fans in one show at Mexico City’s El Estadio Azteca, before crossing the border to the United States

Followed by a camera crew, Bunbury blazes a trail through the North American states, taking no prisoners, burning the house down each night with his barnstorming live show. Captured on the stunning documentary El Camino Más Largo (The Longest Road), due for release by Eagle Rock Entertainment and 700g Films on 25 March, the results are an unprecedented look at one of Spain’s most compelling artists. Including never-before-seen footage of Banbury’s backstage rituals, scenes that weren’t included in the theatrical release, plus interviews with both Bunbury and his band, it’s the most intimate portrait yet of the onetime Héroes Del Silencio frontman and mastermind behind albums such as Hellville De Luxe and Licendiado Cantinas.

With Bunbury gearing up to embark on a 2016 tour, during which he will once again descend upon North America, El Camino Más Largo offers the perfect opportunity for fans to get a taste of what’s going to be one of the must-see shows of the year. Watch the trailer below:
