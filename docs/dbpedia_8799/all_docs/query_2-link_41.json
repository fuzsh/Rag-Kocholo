        "text": "Former US President Donald Trump has been charged with plotting to overturn his 2020 election defeat.\n\nHe is accused of four counts including conspiracy to defraud the US, tampering with a witness and conspiracy against the rights of citizens.\n\nThe indictment caps an inquiry into events which led up to the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol - when supporters of Mr Trump stormed Congress in a bid to thwart the certification of Joe Biden's election victory.\n\nMr Trump, who is again running for president, denies wrongdoing.\n\nHere are the key moments from 6 January 2021.\n\n08:17\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweets allegations of vote fraud ahead of his rally in Washington DC.\n\n10:58\n\nMembers of the Proud Boy movement, a right-wing militia, are seen heading towards the Capitol. Speaking to Newsnight's US correspondent David Grossman, one member of the group says: \"We're taking our country back.\"\n\nOne of the group has a radio. \"It was clear he was communicating - getting messages, sending messages to somebody,\" our correspondent said.\n\n12:00\n\nPresident Trump begins his speech to supporters in Washington. Some 15 minutes into it, he starts urging them to converge on the Capitol.\n\n\"I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard,\" he said.\n\n12:53\n\nAs the president speaks, a crowd outside the Capitol is swelling. They begin marching towards the police barrier and get past officers. The police, outnumbered, try to contain them.\n\nTrump supporters wield flags and weapons. One man stands on a makeshift gallows, complete with a noose. The crowd chants: \"Fight for Trump.\"\n\nMinutes later, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi commences the certification process.\n\n13:10\n\nMr Trump ends his speech with the words: \"We fight. We fight like hell and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. So let's walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.\"\n\nShortly afterwards a Capitol police officer calls for backup.\n\n\"They're throwing metal poles at us,\" he says. \"Multiple law-enforcement injuries,\" he adds in a panicked voice.\n\nCapitol police send an evacuation warning.\n\n13:45\n\nProtesters surge past Capitol police protecting the west steps, the side facing the White House.\n\nMinutes later, an officer declares there is a riot at the Capitol. \"We're going to give riot warnings,\" he says. \"We're going to try to get compliance but this is now effectively a riot.\"\n\nMeanwhile Vice President Mike Pence is continuing to preside over the session.\n\n14:13\n\nSecret Service quickly and suddenly evacuate Mr Pence from the Senate floor.\n\nThe protesters break through the windows. They push inside, hopping through the broken glass. They then kick open the doors to let others in. Some wear hoods and helmets, some hold cameras or Confederate flags.\n\nAn immediate recess of the Senate is called.\n\nA minute later, Officer Eugene Goodman runs to respond to the initial breach. He warns Senator Mitt Romney that the mob is approaching. Mr Romney turns and runs through a capitol hallway to safety.\n\nThe mob, a floor below them, has already begun to search for the Senate chamber.\n\nOfficer Goodman makes his way down to the first floor where he encounters the mob.\n\nHe lures the armed rioters away from the upper chamber. Many of these individuals have been calling for Mr Pence to be hanged.\n\nBy that point, the rioters are \"within 100ft\" (30m) of Mr Pence and a foot away from one of the doors to the chamber. Many senators are still inside.\n\nAt the same time, Ms Pelosi is rushed from the house floor. She is evacuated entirely from the Capitol complex to a secure off-site location.\n\nHer staff barricade themselves into a conference room, hiding under a table.\n\nStaff members of the House leader speak softly, frantically, to each other. Just outside, rioters are spreading out across the building, searching for Ms Pelosi herself.\n\nThe rioters chant: \"Where are you Nancy?\" In an audio clip, we hear one staff member whisper: \"They're pounding on doors trying to find her.\"\n\nOne man breaks open the outer door to the office where the staff are hiding, but not the inner door. Another tries as well, but eventually moves on.\n\n14:24\n\nPresident Trump tweets about Mr Pence.\n\nAt the same time, Mr Pence is evacuated to a secure location.\n\nRioters start to spread through the buildings. Others break in from outside through various doors around the building.\n\nThey open the east side door of the rotunda to let more people in, flooding through the doors and overwhelming the officers.\n\nThe House floor debate is suspended to update members. House members are told to reach for tear gas masks and be prepared to use them.\n\nThe House is called back into session in the hope of continuing the count.\n\nBut minutes later the House is abruptly recessed. Members are told to get down under their chairs if necessary.\n\n\"Folks have entered the rotunda and are coming this way,\" lawmakers are told.\n\nDemocratic Congressman Eric Swalwell sends a text to his wife: \"I love you and the babies. Please hug them for me\".\n\nThe mob outside the chamber grows larger and they get within feet of the house door.\n\n14:26\n\nPresident Trump called Senator Mike Lee, according to the Utah Republican who has provided the trial lawyers with a copy of a log from his mobile phone.\n\nAccording to his office, he received a call from the White House switchboard number - and the call lasted four minutes. Mr Lee has said that apparently the call was meant for Alabama senator Tommy Tuberville, and that he handed his phone to his colleague.\n\nMr Tuberville told reporters that he informed Mr Trump that Mr Pence had been evacuated from the Senate floor. \"I said: Mr President, they've taken the vice-president out. They want me to get off the phone, I gotta go.\"\n\nHouse impeachment managers say it is further evidence that the president knew how much danger his vice-president was in.\n\n14:41\n\nAshli Babbit is seen turning the corner towards the House lobby doors as members are leaving.\n\nHouse Rules Committee Chairman James McGovern is spotted by the mob as he leaves the House floor.\n\nIn a hallway outside the House chamber, a group attempts to force its way through a set of locked doors. The glass window panes on the doors are shattered. A rioter uses a baton to smash through as the crowd around him chants \"break it down, break it down\".\n\nFootage shows the hands of an officer on the other side, holding a gun and pointing it toward the mob. We hear a shot and see Babbitt fall to the ground.\n\n\"Is this the Senate?\" one demands to know. \"Where are they?\" another asks, apparently referring to the evacuated senators.\n\nVideo footage shows some rioters rifling through papers and materials left behind by lawmakers. \"There's got to be something we can use against these scumbags,\" one says.\n\n15:13\n\nTrump tweets asking for people to \"remain peaceful\".\n\nMeanwhile the mob are still at the Capitol.\n\nFootage shows a sprawling mob, a sea of people on the Capitol grounds. A Confederate flag waves in the foreground.\n\n16:17\n\nTrump releases a video in which he tells the mob to go home.\n\n18:00\n\nFifteen minutes after police confirm Ashli Babbitt has died, Trump tweets again."
