        "text": "“The Five Fallen” as a Meta-image of Polish Culture in the Mid-19th Century\n\nRomantic Fever\n\nAt the beginning of 1862, a patriotic fervour was spreading across Warsaw. Celebrations honouring the 30th anniversary of the Battle of Olszynka Grochowska had been planned for the 25 February and, as posterity would know, the first of the demonstrations was to prepare the ground for the January Uprising of 1863.\n\nDemonstrations took place on 11 June 1860 and invoked the spirit of the earlier November Uprising of 1830-31. The funeral of Katarzyna Sowińska – the widow of General Sowiński, hero of the November Uprising – acquired the character of a patriotic demonstration. For she was, “the wife of the elderly soldier who died defending Wola [a district of Warsaw], that leader who died from a bullet standing at the altar… .” According to Franek Plewa, the hero of Józef Ignacy Kraszewski’s Dziecięcia Starego Miasta [The Child of the Old Town], Sowiński died a “martyr for the Polish cause.”\n\nThe Russians were aware of the February plans – in fact announcements had been put up all round the city calling for participation. The first idea put forward was to hold a church service on the site of the battlefield itself. The Viceroy of the Kingdom of Poland, Michaił Gorczakow, did not take any steps towards realising this idea, however. At the suggestion of the Petersburg authorities, he considered organising a mass for the Russian casualties of the battle. In the end, however, the Czarist authorities were aided by the weather: the thaw moved the ice on the Vistula and under this pretext the boat bridge was disassembled and Warsaw lost its connection with Praga (district of Warsaw on the opposite side of the Vistula from the Old Town). The demonstration was then moved to the Old Town.\n\nFor a long time, the Army and Gendarmerie desisted from intervening in the processions. Ultimately, however, the gathering was dispersed and thirty people were arrested. But the waves of revolutionary spirit continued to grow. They were also boosted by the talks, taking place in Warsaw, concerning agricultural policy (including the ending of feudal relations). This issue – besides independence and attitudes towards the Russians - was the biggest matter bringing division in Polish society. Landowners travelled to the city for the congress of the Agricultural Society, its chairman, Count Andrzej Zamoyski, was one of the leaders of the Polish side. It was in this atmosphere that the students of the School of Fine Arts and the Medical-Surgical Academy immediately called for another demonstration, for 27 February, appealing, among other things, for solidarity with those being held.\n\nIt started with a church service for the fallen in 1831, in the Church of the Carmelites on Leszno Street; but the culmination came later on the so-called Narrow Krakowskie Przedmieście Street, along which protestors marched. The Russians opened fire and the following demonstrators were killed: Filip Adamkiewicz – a journeyman tailor, employed in the construction of the Vistula bridge; Michał Arcichiewicz – a high school student; Karol Brendel – a welder, factory worker and landowner; Marceli Paweł Karczewski and Zdzisław Rutkowski – both members of the Agricultural Society. Accounts of the course of events vary in their details – and in the emphasis placed on specific aspects of the situation. It seems that chaos reigned on the Russian side and Gorczakow rather did not seek armed confrontation. General Wasyl Zabołocki led the Cossacks and he gave the order to shoot at the crowd. That protestors had mixed in with the funeral cortege moving along Krakowskie Przedmieście Street, and got jammed between the narrow streets of the nearby Old Town. People were stirred up by rumours that the Russians in the tumult had broken a cross; at the same time the crowd was confused, some say they attacked soldiers with bricks and pieces of ice. In any case they did not obey the soldiers’ orders to disperse. According to Mikołaj Berg, 55 shots were fired and those shots which hit their targets brought further events and an escalation of tensions in their wake, ultimately leading, on the 14th October 1861, to the introduction of martial law in the Kingdom.\n\nIn February, however, the Russian authorities continued attempts to restore peace. Gorczakow withdrew the army from the city streets and agreed to the formation of the City Delegation, a civic representation for the Polish society. He also accepted from the hands of the Delegation an address to the Czar, demanding a change in the Polish political situation. A joint funeral for the victims was also agreed, although the Viceroy was aware that this would inevitably turn into a patriotic demonstration. The funeral service took place on the 2 March in the Church of the Holy Cross, from where the remains were taken to the Paszkowski Cemetery and buried there in a shared grave (located at quarter 178).\n\nThe funeral did indeed turn into another occasion for the manifestation of patriotic feelings and feelings of national unity, the myth of national unity having been strengthened in the carnival of freedom of 1860-1861. Estimates from the period speak of 150 000 participants in the funeral procession, including “representatives of all professions, levels of society and faiths,” including delegations from Kraków and Poznań, and also priests and members of the Jewish community and Evangelical pastors. The unifying symbol was the cross (as one might expect there was a ban on displays of national colours.) This can be seen in the symbolic presentations of the painting of Aleksander Lesser (1861), depicting the funeral with a separate group of spiritual leaders at the cemetery, and the painting of Henryk Pillati (1865), where above the funeral procession there stands out the figure of Christ, the statue in front of the Church of the Holy Cross.\n\nAdam Mickiewicz’s 1830 poem Do Matki Polki [To The Polish Mother] compared the Passion of Christ and the suffering of the Mother of God with the fate of the Polish conspirators (who would “get the dry wood of the gallows”) and their mothers. The analogy of suffering but without bitterness was assumed whereby the fallen demonstrators would be glorified and promised “resurrection-insurrection”. Their wounds were deliberately exposed in full public view and the coffins were decorated with red lace – these were the most evident signs of the cult which almost from the moment of their deaths began to surround the fallen. It passed momentarily to the image of the nation as we can read in the circular from the 3 March, attributed to the Archbishop Antoni Fijałkowski, and calling for national mourning:\n\nWomen can wear their wedding dresses only on the day of their wedding. Let us nobly bear the (…) the bitter and deep wounds of the nation, avoiding juvenile behaviour or plain showing off – then we shall always be a people of oneness and devotion. Today and for years hence our national emblem shall be a crown of thorns, like the one born yesterday by the coffin of the fallen. Do you not know that that crown means patience, suffering, devotion, liberation, forgiveness? We hereby oblige Poles of all faiths to spread these few phrases to the farthest corners of the land. (Przyborowski, p. 113).\n\nThe Cult of the “Five Fallen”\n\nJust after the Russian attack, the body of the youngest victim – Michał Arcichiewicz – was carried to his parents home. They lived in a rented flat in Pałac Zamoyskich (today at 67/69 Nowy Świat Street). The bodies of the other victims at first wandered (here sources differ somewhat in their accounts ); but were finally brought to salon No. 64 of the Hotel Europejski where they were guarded honourably by other demonstrators. And this was when they became a place of pilgrimage for Warsaw inhabitants who were interrupted only once – by the official autopsy. There also quickly appeared a box of armbands. “Some people asked passers-by: »You Polish?« When the answer was in the affirmative: »Give me your left arm, Sir«. So you held out your arm and the symbol of mourning was attached.” (Berg, p. 148). By the evening it was as if the whole of Warsaw was already wearing the armbands.\n\nAt this moment, the author of the account wonders: “What really happened? How did we reach this fever pitch? On the one hand – What did the police do? The government? “How did it come about that the bodies of the victims of the confrontation of the army with the people were left with the crowd?” The answer can be found in the overall evaluation of the Russian authorities: “this kind of spectacle is what we might expect from the chaotic and thoughtless Russian governments, who can never be relied on and who take responsibility for nothing.” On the other hand it was striking to witness the triumph on the Polish side of an exaltation of independence from the “crazies and brats” previously held back by social elites. Here the national character of the reactions was significant and “an important role was played by the well-known recklessness of the Warsaw population. Nowhere else is there as many mentally deranged people as here and nowhere else is group mania so contagious, spreading in an instant to everyone and everything.” (Berg, pp. 148–149).\n\nThis fever found expression in the widespread demonstrations of patriotism, mostly manifested in a patently religious form but also drawing on other cultural practices. And photography played a role in this madness and in this cult. On the ground floor of the Hotel Europejski there was a retouching lab for the photographic studio of Karol Beyer (1818–1877), at that time the most important photographer in Warsaw. The proximity of the studio was not the main reason, however, why it was Beyer who took the posthumous pictures of the fallen. He was one of the more respected citizens of the city, for a moment a member of the Municipal Delegation (which he also photographed), and at the same time he was a photographer gifted with intuition and inventiveness in taking on a series of topics. In a sense he took pictures wherever technical conditions permitted – for instance the documentation of the building of the Aleksandrowski Bridge, which took place in the same period as the demonstrations. And Beyer took pictures of everyone: he left us with a huge collection of portraits of Warsaw inhabitants.\n\nBeyer photographed the five fallen in profile, from head to waist. With the exception of Arcichiewicz, whose portrait was taken in his family home, they were photographed with bare torsos so as to clearly expose their wounds. The images made appearances in the form of individual displays, but were also combined into a tableau which included all five and which appeared in various versions, always exhibited in decorated frames and surrounded by religious symbols: with black, a cross and references to Golgota together with the promise of resurrection (Resurgam). Ewa Toniak analysed the symbolism of these displays in detail in her book about heroic death in Poland of the first half of the 19th century. Toniak placed these pictures both in the tradition of presentations of martyrdom and in the tradition of the posthumous daguerreotypes. However, of the author of The Dearh of the Hero is mostly interested in the presence of an aesthetic component (“surplus,” as she writes) in the images. This component reveals the subsequent steps, subsequent images by means of which death itself (“the corpse”) is removed from the national imagination, to be replaced by a “messianic consolation.” We may ask though, whether it is proper to speak here of such a messianic escalation: or whether it is really the photographer who caught and preserved the sublime present in the corpses?\n\nOnce again it was Mikołaj Berg who described the circumstances in which the pictures were taken, and it is his interpretation which is usually repeated in subsequent. accounts At the time Berg (1823–1884) was already a recognised historian and Russian columnist, a veteran of the Crimean war and the Garibaldi uprising. He was a remarkable witness of the era who had come to Poland at the beginning of 1863, two years after the events described in this article, intrigued by the explosive January uprising. In the middle of 1864 the then Viceroy of the Kingdom, Fiodor Berg (mere coincidence of surname) invited him to write an account of the situation (“plots and uprisings”) in Poland. Berg-the-writer gained access from Berg-Viceroy to both public and confidential Police information, documents of the Czarist and Polish authorities, personal accounts as well as all other archives of written or visual documentation. At the same time, his book does not contain any reference to documents, and the author himself emphasizes his right to his own views and to the protection of his sources (besides the czarist archives). So Berg’s reports require caution – but here they are important to the extent that they present the circumstances in which the law enforcement passed symbolic power over the events to the victims.\n\nThus Berg wrote:\n\nGeneral [Amilkar Paulucci, the new Chief of Police for Warsaw] went to Room 64, where the coroner’s examinations of the victims were in progress, carried out by the second court department of the Warsaw police, all of whose personnel had come together with a notary and twelve civilian witnesses as per the law of the time. An interesting motley rabble was squeezing into this room. There was also, with his camera, national photographer Bayer [sic]] and he captured the look of the victims in photographs with all their horror and wondrousness, with their gaping wounds. These pictures in countless numbers of copies circulated around all of Poland. (p. 169, my emphasis)\n\nIn this account, there are at least three things worth emphasizing. First of all, the attitude to photography which is a matter of “capturing the look” (literally, as historically in English in portraiture: “taking the likeness”). The documentary aspect, the close connection between portrait and portrayed is here the assumed feature of the photographic. Secondly, on the level of interpretation – seeing – this document is transformed into a noble symbol: the wounds become “wonderful”. Thirdly, these displays are all the more powerful the greater is their number – the reproductive essence of photography is here revealed with all its strength. So photography was also to transfer specific ideas to every “nook and cranny” of the land. The emotional bearing of the bodies across Warsaw, before they found their ‘resting place’ in the Hotel Europejski, was to show Gorczakow, to show Zamoyski and, finally, to show the Warsaw public – this course of events was recorded in photographs.\n\nWalery Przyborowski also wrote about this, mentioning Berg in the process but removing the latter’s pathos: “Then photographer Bayer [sic]] took the likenesses of the victims, in somewhat theatrical poses with the wounds made visible, uncovered. These photographs, ugly and poorly done, went round the whole country in their thousands.” Photography had been enlisted in the service of the nation. (Przyborowski, p. 88)\n\nA Metaimage of Culture\n\nThese events, including the propaganda role of Karol Beyer’s photography and its wide influence, have been described several times in other places. I present them here, in as short a form as possible, because I believe that even if photography’s role should not be exaggerated, this role does nevertheless pose several as yet unanswered questions. Following John Berger, we may interpret historic material in a ‘radial’ way, which allows us to perceive the subsequent layers of meaning and practice of Poles of that time.\n\nThe circumstances in which these photographs were taken, the manner in which they were written into existing symbolic patterns, the way they were distributed – this together means that we are able to see in them, as in a lens, the basic values of Polish culture of the 19th century; secondly, we may perceive in the pictures a particular encounter – a characteristic one I feel – between modernity (represented by the medium of photography) and the culture’s existing forms and values.\n\nThe conception of the of metapicture , proposed by W.J.T. Mitchell in Picture Theory is inspiring in this regard. Łukasz Zaremba, the Polish translator of Mitchell’s What Do Pictures Want? writes in the introduction to the Polish translation:\n\nFor Mitchell, image more or less denotes that which circulates without embodiment within the imaginative sphere. It is only by becoming pictures that these images take on a material form. Image is a category both general and broad, an overarching domain (in Iconology Mitchell lists pictures as one of the types of images). This is why we have translated image as the Polish obraz , and we have translated picture as “przedstawienie wizualne,” [“visual presentation”] and even “przedstawienie’ alone [“presentation”], the latter being understood as the realisation of a given image, for example, as a statue.\n\nMitchell is not fully consistent in his use of these two terms. He does distinguish them clearly when he wishes to emphasize these two levels of functioning of visual imagination. In Picture Theory he explores visual presentations/pictures – i.e. specific realisations of images – which have a self-referential character and it is these that he calls “metapictures.” These may be self-referential in three senses. Firstly, the picture may include multiple presentations of itself. Secondly, a part of the picture/presentation may be another presentation, in this way undergoing re-contextualisation or reframing. Thirdly, the picture/presentation may be a part of a discussion about image. According to Mitchell, almost every image may become a metapicture, as almost every image may provoke reflection on the nature of pictures.\n\nMitchell most of all emphasizes the first of these understandings: the self-referential aspect of pictures/presentations which speak about themselves or about a specific kind of presentation. The “Five Fallen” is a more complicated case or perhaps a more fluid case than any of the above. If we take as our starting point one of the tableaux composed of the five photographs, in this one picture/presentation five others are hidden. And they express so much meaning because they are in some sense “the same”: they are both individual and subjected to the symbolic matrix by means of which they have been reframed in a new whole. Here at work is the connection between the technical-reproductive aspect of photography and the potential “multiplication” of saints in the Catholic tradition - as role-models to be imitated. This matrix, drawing on the language of Tyrtaeus-martyrological romanticism and at the same time preserving that language with great strength, has its roots in another kind of presentation, i.e. in icons and/or smaller holy pictures. Using the distinction we have assumed here, this matrix belongs to the level of imagination, i.e. to image in Mitchell’s technical sense. At the same time, the subject of this matrix is not only a presentation which includes another presentation, but the whole of the following process: photography takes up the ornamental style of tableaux originating with holy pictures. The whole image made out of photographs “swallows” the individual photograph, subordinating it to the overall symbolism. The whole clearly invokes not only other presentations, but a whole series of practices related both to religious imagery and the renewal of the cult. At the same time the effect of the modern medium of photography is invoked. Both these orders – religious imagery and the modern development of photography – intertwine, creating a new presentation which may be said to be “multistable.”\n\nThe multistability of images is usually illustrated, as it is by Mitchell, by means of the rabbit-duck illusion, where, depending on the focus of our gaze, particular accommodation on the level of recognition (not perception), we see either a drawing of a rabbit or a duck. Again, in a certain sense, every image is multiply stable to the extent that we see either the picture or the subject, either the depiction or the depicted (“I can at will focus on the scenery or on the window-pane,” as Roland Barthes wrote ). The tableau of the “Five Fallen” works here on several levels. We see at the same time the image-thing (memento) and what is presented; we see both parts and the whole. But the basic tension is of course between the documentary power of photography (and its iconic potential) and the stability of reworked and thereby preserved holy presentations; between event and the great symbolic narrative.\n\nThe dynamic character of the presentation of the “Five Fallen” reveals the kind of self-reference at play in the work, but above all it forces us to shift our focus to the relational nature of the work in general – its being located in an entire network of practices and signs, other presentations and images. Beyer’s tableau is a product both of its historical circumstances and its cultural context, and in effect is a statement about those origins and therefore a witness to the beginnings of modernity. That is why I describe it as a metaimage (and not a metapicture), adding the qualification: a metaimage of culture. The conditions for the status of being a metaimage in this perspective are not only the internal features of the image but also the right context for the culture as a whole – its unique practices, genres and visual media as well as the system of values and modernizing transformations.\n\nThis last point, besides allowing us to view the presentations to be analysed in a truly broad conception, it also allows us to go beyond a certain contradiction which has been taken to be obvious – between new media and old narratives and symbols (and their corresponding media). Even Marshall McLuhan, though he left an unsolved complex of technological determinism in his work, when he stressed that the medium itself is the “message” – transforming as it does both the consciousness and the subconscious of the subject – he also noticed that the effect of particular media also depends on the state or the degree of development of the society which that message reaches.\n\nThe Modern Photographic Mania\n\nPhotography and modernity were joined at birth. If we take modernity to be not a philosophical project, but the realisation of that project: modernity is the time when human experience transformed into a modern experience and there was at the same time a recognition of this fact. This civilizational moment took place in the first half of the 19th century: precisely at the birth and subsequent rapid development of photographic practice. At the same time its expansion (as with the later development of cinema) was related to the expansion of the West. The borders of the modern world became the borders defined with the aid of recording devices. From the middle of the 19th century: photography is the world and what is not photographed – does not exist.\n\nThe daguerreotype and subsequent improvements to photography arrived in Poland relatively quickly (due to Beyer), with at most a delay of a few years from their appearance in western markets (which at the time meant in practice Paris). Before 1860 photography had already become a popular medium in Polish cities. In 1854, the format carte de visite was patented; it allowed for the simultaneous exposure of 8 photographs in a 6x9 cm format on one glass plate. The inventor or rather populariser of this idea was André-Adolphe-Eugène Disdéri (1819–1889). Karol Beyer had been actively looking for new technical solutions at foreign exhibitions and specialist fairs. The right equipment arrived in his atelier in 1859. Economic considerations are here strictly tied to the capacity to distribute pictures, as well as with the possibilities for developing new methods. The carte de visite do indeed find application as calling cards; above all, however, they become the subject of trading, exchange and collectors’ items – they are exhibited as memorabilia in the shop windows of factories and in apartments; they are widely collected into the albums frequently to be found in urban homes. As André Rouillé has written, these cards became images representing the trust in presentation which goes together with economic exchange.\n\nSusan Sontag put it like this:\n\na society becomes “modern” when one of its chief activities is producing and consuming images, when images that have extraordinary powers to determine our demands upon reality and are themselves coveted substitutes for first-hand experience become indispensable to the health of the economy, the stability of the polity, and the pursuit of private happiness.\n\nShe refers here to the preface of Feuerbach’s 1843 The Essence of Christianity, where Feuerbach wrote that “The present age... prefers the sign to the thing signified, the copy to the original, fancy to reality, the appearance to the essence... for in these days illusion only is sacred, truth profane.” Marx perceived, in the middle of the 19th century, the phenomenon of the circulation of goods as signs. The distribution of photographs adds an important context here: signs themselves become “goods.” On the one hand, they have exchange value, on the other they are mass produced and in effect act in a reproductive manner by formatting poses, styles of dress, aspects of belongingness and social roles. Photography was to become the first instrument of “technological reproduction” – to use Benjamin’s phrase – which acts in a modernising way to the extent that it irons out differences and provides mass distribution of unified contents.\n\nThis photography, despite the static nature of the single shot, is really mobile. It reaches many recipients with a variety of social positions. In the case of patriotic pictures, Beyer even resigned from seeking his dues as author (on other photographs he placed the printed warning: “Karol Beyer’s print. Copies will be sought out” ), and he sold the photographs to school-groups with large discounts. Commercial mechanisms undergo are negotiated, as they must defer to higher values. On the other hand, the same situation provokes a veritable photographic mania, which of course boosts the economic activity of photographic studios. The apogee of this activity is the time of the uprising when there are portraits of men in uprising attire being taken on a masa scale, as well as of women in mourning. It is difficult to assess the scale of the phenomenon in precise numbers, but the newspaper Kurier Warszawski [Warsaw Courier] already in 1862 claimed that in only one studio alone 30 000 portraits were discovered. And these photos really did find their way to the farthest flung corners of the Empire. Both photos and entire studios found their way to Siberia together with the inmates. Beyer himself was sentenced in 1863 to one year in Novohopersk, where he continued his photographic activity. The photographs, being published abroad, sustained a sudden interest in Poland related to its social instability. The beginning of the 1860’s was the time the illustrated press came into existence, though the pictures are reproduced using engraving i.e. in a mediated manner. The Illustrated London News, the first illustrated weekly in the world, appeared for the first time on 14 May 1842 (promoted on the streets of London by 200 “sandwich men”). In Warsaw, the Tygodnik Ilustrowany [Illustrated Weekly] came out for the first time in 1859.\n\nSo the photographs of the “Five Fallen” already functioned in the living environment of technical pictures as well as in the context of many other pictures/presentations which were strictly related to the “issue” and so providing the context for, or even co-creating, this cultural metaimage. Above all the members of the City Delegation had their pictures taken, with a special insignia of three white stripes, but also with symbols of their social position and profession. Stanisław Hiszpański, the cobbler famous for his verbal battles with Gorczakow, became very well known.\n\nThe first photography of the events of February 1862 was taken by Warsaw Oberpolicmajster Fiodor Trepow (for a moment substituted by Paulucci). He went out to the crowd in the Old Town, intending to check the scale and course of the events of the demonstration of 25 February, at the request of the Viceroy, and he was hurt in the crowd. Warsaw street culture came up with a small poem on the occasion: “Na Starym Mieście, przy wodotrysku / Pan policmajster dostał po pysku” [In the Old Town, by the fountain / Mr Policeman got a punch on the chin]. The next day our injured hero reported to Beyer’s studio in his bandages to have his picture taken. And many more pictures were to come in the following months: the picture of the Jewish boy Michał Landa, injured during the demonstration of 8 April during which he had been holding a cross (he died in the Hospital of St. Roch); the posthumous portrait of Archbishop Fijałkowski; later insurgents, including the National Government, were frequently portrayed in the form of tableaux using the portraits of the members; reproductions of painted and graphical presentations for instance the aforementioned pictures of Lesser and Pillati or the portraits of Kościuszki, and later of course the paintings of Jan Matejko and the graphics of Artur Grottger both of which were fundamental for Polish national mythology.\n\nThus the photography of the “Five Fallen” became a part of a complex collective action which expressed itself in various media and was based on repetition: the demonstration of 27 February was to be a repetition of the demonstration of 25 February, which was intended to be an invocation of the spirit of the events of 1831; the fate of the “Five Fallen” became the fate of Christ – at the same time a repetition and an exhortation to further repetition. The technology of reproduction here works effectively: everyone had their picture taken in similar poses, against the same backdrops, placed in similar frames. Every time an individual with all their specific social attributes stands before a camera, they are placed in a uniform matrix. As with the economic dimension of photography – there is a negotiation with the supervening order of collective values.\n\nAn A-modern Moment\n\nThe same poses, the same background and the same framing nevertheless mean something entirely different depending on whose hands the photograph reaches. As for Trepow’s photograph: he holds it up as proof of his own heroism; for the Polish public the same photo was a souvenir of a pleasant victory over the Russians. A particularly spectacular example is the so-called policmajster album – a collection of photos collected by Platon Frederiks, Warsaw policmajster from 1863 to 1878 and titled by him Pamiątka buntu (Pamiat’ miatieża) [A Memento of Insurrection]. There are over 700 photographs of Polish people who are mostly wanted, missing, arrested, deceased. Their pictures were confiscated by the Russians while carrying out searches and arrests. In the hands of the policmajster the pictures change their function, yet they are still mementoes – perhaps because they lack a unified form, for the form itself was not subjected adequately to police routines. And so the appearance retains an emotional charge, which is presumably why the album remained with Frederiks once he had finished his service, to be passed on to his family, as private property and not state property.\n\nSo we may claim that the police of the time – and not only the Russian police – were aware of the usefulness photography, but they had yet to discover the right photographic language for the police’s own variety of photography. The first photographs taken at the behest of law enforcements agencies – like the portraits taken of prisoners by Carl Durheim at the request of the Swiss prosecutor in the 50’s – did not differ at all from portraits taken in the atelier. But perhaps it is worth pointing out that the photos often were of members of classes who still lacked their own symbolic and economic access to photography. Telling in this regard is the famous picture of Alexander Payne (made famous by Roland Barthes’ analysis in Camera Lucida where the picture is a case study for Barthes’ idea of punctum.) This conspirator against the highest authorities in the USA, an accomplice in the assassination of President Lincoln, was photographed in 1863 three months before his death, in three shots each with the same background. The frames of these photos are set up stiffly but within their limits the subject behaves freely, with a certain nonchalance – quite out of place for the taking of a police photograph.\n\nAlphonse Bertillon (1853-1914) started to introduce more appropriate photographic procedures at the beginning of the 70’s of the 19th century. These procedures were a part of a complex biometric system which enabled the systematic and professional identification of suspects and criminals. The goal of police photography in this conception was to “observe, checking or controlling of bodies: it’s a matter of uncovering from them new regions, the acquisition of new knowledge ready to be passed on to the new authorities.” However, as Agnieszka Pajączkowska remarks on the basis of the analysis of identification practices in KL Auschwitz-Birkenau , this was not only a matter of creating a given presentation; it was also about forcing the prisoner, the convict or the sick to perform a set activity – the photographed subject participated in a kind of dramatization, which made him a prisoner before he was placed in this role permanently. This performative model was yet to become available for the police photograph at the moment we are considering (1861) and the frames of the photos are yet to be cut with a guillotine.\n\nFrom contemporary accounts including those of Berg, we can see that Beyer’s photography was produced if not with the agreement of the Czarist authorities, then at least with their awareness. The pictures of the deceased from the start were made with the daguerreotype process, i.e. practices which were already established. What was new was the use made of the camera’s objective revealing its ‘surgical potential’ , approaching the painter’s brush in creating sublime pictures. Not only did the Russian authorities permit the use of the existing symbolic order, but for a certain period of time refrained from pursuing either the photographers or the photos themselves. This situation changed after a few months, with Beyer himself being arrested for the first time already in 1861.\n\nWe can call this moment ‘a-modern’ – by which I do not mean to place it in a linear or chronological order, with respect an assumed process of developing modernity. Instead I would locate this time next to this development or in a unique intersection of the modern and the stable – what is synchronic with respect to yesterday and tomorrow. At the moment we are speaking of, there were some kinds of language, certain possibilities which were yet to come into existence. Yet there were others which had been established earlier and which were equally open to the influence of the reproductive machine.\n\nAt this time there was also no separate or marked out sphere of pictorial circulation. In a certain sense we can say there is no such separate sphere, but with a film screening, even when we watch at home, we do switch off other media for a certain time. The photographs in question here were used as a tableau with the “Five Fallen” constituting a paradigm or model. Those same photos functioned within a whole flurry of oral and performative practices. Their currency, which according to Walter Benjamin is so significant for photography, intersects here with a static technology which ironically removes the tension of the moment from the picture. In a similar way, myth is brought to contemporary life here thanks to the power of photography as document. By the power of mimesis we bear witness to a concrete event, but by the use of symbols this event is immediately transported in the sphere of myth. When you own a picture of the “Fallen” it is “somewhat akin to having a nail from the real Cross.” That’s why I believe it is misleading to interpret Beyer’s photographs in terms of genres like photomontage and photojournalism. The similarity which turns on placing the pictures next to each other disguises a much more crucial difference – the subsuming of the event under the national-religious myth, as we have mentioned several times. By showing the wounds these pictures do not threaten or terrorize, instead they build up a religious parallel – in effect they take the event out of historical time which one would have thought to have been the appropriate time for photography – and place the event in an eschatological horizon. The reality of “here and now” is not the reference point, nor relation – as in photojournalism, nor the harmonising of a disconnected world – as in photomontage.\n\nInstead the photographs become an element of a national mass or national prayer, a holy souvenir – often more of an object than an image of something. They become an essential element of a community’s story – both a confirmation of that story and an enrichment of it.\n\nPolish Narcissus\n\nPortrait photography occupies a special place at the border of public space and private space. It has a public circulation – for instance today, when photographers exhibit their work in a shop window for advertising purposes. In the middle of the 19th century portraits served mainly to present social status and roles, i.e. a reasonably lasting (relative to a human lifespan) dimension of personal identity, but more and more the result of individual choices (such as the choice of profession). At the same time, the background of the atelier was an ambiguous combination of universal cultural motifs (ancient or rustic for example) with the “padded casing” of the over-furnished bourgeois interior that Benjamin wrote about. The craze for photography in Poland between 1861 and 1864, however, related above all to national identification, i.e. the collective identity whose expression in public space was limited or even forbidden. The most common uses of portrait photography were private uses – like the aforementioned “Policmajster’s Album” – and they establish a shift into the private realm at the same time being a use of photography as a political declaration. This situation is partly the result of the fact that the public life of Polish society in the Polish Kingdom took place in private space (street demonstrations were the a rare, revolutionary form in this context). Patriotic jewellery, photographs as mementos sometimes in medallions or even rings, but also photos on étagères and tables were a part of the communal sphere, i.e. the private space which was accessible for the public and its purposes – be those political meetings, charitable balls or, later, home schooling.\n\nSo a visit to a photographer became an act confirming one’s membership in the community. This fact was noticed at the time, though while some took part in the activity, others only commented on it – and not without the occasional dig. Walery Przyborowski, mentioned already several times, perhaps simply did not like photographs; while appreciating the reach of the photographs of the “Five Fallen”, he did as Imentioned, find them ugly. He wrote with critical irony about the photographs of the City Delegation (p. 160):\n\nDressed for mourning, but differently from the others, those mere mortals, placing three white stripes stitched on their sleeves they made Beyer takes hundreds of his photos to tell the whole nation – nay, the whole world and all posterity.\n\nOpponents of national intensification also made their feelings known. In the satirical paper Komunały [Banalities], edited by Aleksander Miniszewski (a supporter of Aleksander Wielopolski), the following derisive text was published:\n\nSince every moment has its characteristic marks and properties, at the present photography is in bloom. And since everyone is in possession of photographic albums, large or small, no-one need any longer bother themselves with creativity or thinking that might give one a headache. So, whether privates or generals, let us photograph their feathers [part of the insignia of their uniforms – trans.] in an orderly fashion, all alike and as agreed.”\n\nThis is the kind of assessment, which rings of Baudelaire and his contempt for the awestruck masses with their fascination for photography. As the French poet wrote wrote: “our squalid society rushed, Narcissus to a man, to gaze at its trivial image on a scrap of metal” The act of self-amazement on seeing one’s own photograph became widespread, yet these acts of narcissism were fed by the illusion of individuality, the uniqueness of the subject. Cyprian Kamil Norwid, Polish poet, but a Parisian at that time, contemporary of Baudelaire, had his picture taken at almost the same time as the French poet – except the Pole in his picture taken in 1861 was sporting his national clothes. Photography gave the Polish nation the opportunity to identify with the community with all the reproductive power of this technology, thus strengthening the image of the National costume and the noble death one undergoes when one dies wearing it. We cannot but perceive here the love felt for the wounds and the beauty of “the victim” – the nation’s victimhood, collective victimhood, one’s own victimhood. To the threat of real physical violence, photography in Poland replied with protection from harm in the world of myth. The photographs of the “Five Fallen” represent an old-new matrix of symbolic violence in a new medium.\n\nThe article is the product of research conducted within the project “Visual Culture in Poland: Languages, Concepts, Metapictures,” led by Iwona Kurz at the Institute of Polish Culture, University of Warsaw and financed by the National Science Centre (ref. no.
