The belief represented by an emblem need not be associated with or endorsed by a group or organization.\n\nEmblems of belief for inscription on Government headstones and markers do not include social, cultural, ethnic, civic, fraternal, trade, commercial, political, professional or military emblems. VA will not inscribe any emblem on a headstone or marker that would have an adverse impact on the dignity and solemnity of cemeteries honoring those who served the Nation. Emblems that would not be permitted include (but are not limited to), emblems that contain explicit or graphic depictions or descriptions of sexual organs or sexual activities that are shocking, titillating, or pandering in nature; and emblems that display coarse or abusive language or images.\n\nIf you are applying for a headstone or marker and the emblem you desire is not currently available, please see information below:\n\nWho Can Request a New Emblem of Belief?\n\nCFR 38.632 rule states that the following individuals may request a new emblem of belief for inscription on a headstone or marker: the decedent's next-of-kin (NOK), a person authorized in writing by the NOK, or a personal representative authorized in writing by the decedent.\n\nInstructions for Requesting an Emblem not Available for Inscription\n\nTo submit a request for an emblem of belief not available for inscription, the requestor must:\n\n1. Establish that there is an immediate need for a Government headstone/marker to be furnished for a deceased eligible individual (i.e., submission of VA-Form 40-1330, for Standard Government Headstone or Marker, verification from national or state Veterans' cemetery officials).\n\n2. Certify that the proposed new emblem of belief represents the decedent's religious affiliation or sincerely held religious belief system, or a sincerely held belief system that was functionally equivalent to a religious belief system in the life of the decedent.\n\n3. Submit a three-inch diameter digitized black and white representation of the requested emblem that is free of copyright or trademark restrictions or authorized by the owner for inscription on Government-furnished headstones and markers and can be reproduced in a production-line environment in stone or bronze without loss of graphic quality.\n\nSubmit all information to the following address:"
