Included roughly the central and southeastern modern-day Poland. As Boney set it up as a restored rump Polish state, can we assume that it used the white-over-red?\n\nIn 1815 most of it became the Kingdom of Poland, which was supposed to be autonomous within the Russian Empire. I'm pretty sure that used the Polish colours until its suppression in 1830.\n\nRoy Stilling,, 26 January 1996\n\nInformation about Polish XIX century flags on FOTW pages are incomplete. Grand Duchy of Warsaw was Napoleon's satellite state 1807-1815, but Napoleon never had been the Duke of it. The Duke was Saxonian king, Friedrich August. Grand Duchy of Warsaw had flag horizontally white-amaranth.\n\nAfter Congress in Vienna 1815 Grand Duchy was divided into three parts:\n\nKingdom of Poland, Grand Duchy of Poznan and Free City of Cracow.\n\nGrzegorz Skrukwa, 6 Apr 2000\n\nIt is very hard to tell what exactly flag was used in the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, but this could be rather red flag with white (silver) coat of arms - white eagle (like this one shown in Kingdom of Poland).\n\nPeter 'Mikolaj' Mikolajski, 18 Sept 2000\n\nKingdom of Poland\n\nby Adam Kromer, from his website\n\nFlag of Kingdom of Poland [Congressional] This flag was used in 1784-1787 as banner of Black Sea Trade Company. Constituted by Czar Alexander I as banner or flaf of Kingdom of Poland (flag's descriptions are not precise, because call it flag, banner or even war banner). This flag was certainly used since 1827 by two Vistula's steam ships.\n\nAdam Kromer, translated by Peter 'Mikolaj' Mikolajski, 18 Sept 2000\n\n\"The flag of the dependent Kingdom of Poland (so nominated after the Napoleonic wars) has a a white field with the blue cross of St. Andrew, which proclaims Russian suzerainty. Upon the red canton is a crowned spread eagle.\" This flag is based on Laurie's flagchart (1842), as depicted on p. 71 of Wilson's 'Flags at Sea', 1986. Is this eagle roughly similar to traditional Polish eagles, like the one on their flag now? Also, there's no word on official usage - I didn't think the Russians were real big on emphasizing Polish separateness. In fact, I thought even the legal existance of the Kingdom had been abolished by the Czars at some time before this. Anyway, wouldn't Poland be de facto independent from Russia by 10/17?\n\nJosh Fruhlinger, 17 February 1996\n\nI don't know of any use of the blue saltire on white as a Belarussian flag as such, although it was (with a white Polish eagle on red as canton) used as the flag of \"the kingdom of Poland\" from 1815 to 1917 (this is the kingdom whose king was the Czar and which was somewhat autonomous until 1848)\n\nNorman Martin, 30 Sept 1999\n\nWas this flag (i.e. blue on white saltaire with white eagle on red canton) actually in use until 1917? All the references I checked state that the so-called Kingdom of Poland was suppressed in 1864 and the Russian-held Polish lands were officially incorporated into the Russian Empire. Was the flag continued after that date? If so, it would seem to contradict the Russian policy of obliterating even an appearance of Polish autonomy.\n\nEdward Smith, 4 Oct 1999\n\nKingdom of Poland, so called \"Congress Kingdom\" with capital in Warsaw, was autonomous, with Russian Tzar as ruler. 1815-1831 it had flag as it is shown on this page (Russian St. Andrew's blue saltire with Polish eagle in canton). During November Uprising agains Tzar in 1831, Polish Parliament (Sejm) abolished this flag and adopted as Polish national flag\n\nhorizontal white-red bicolor. After suppression of Uprising, the Czar didn't restore the flag. Of course he also didn't accept white-red flag. Till WWI only Russian flags and Russian imperial COAs were legal. Even municipal COAs were prohibited. 1864 Kingdom was renamed into Vistula Land (Russian: Priwislinskij Kraj, Polish: Kraj Przywislanski).\n\nGrzegorz Skrukwa, 6 Apr 2000\n\nSt. Andrew's blue saltire with Polish eagle in canton was designed for warships of Vistula fleet about 1815. This flag officially abolished in Russia 12 april 1833.\n\nVictor Lomantsov, 7 Apr 2000\n\nAs far I know the polish flag in the national uprising of 1830-1831: the nationalists used red and white flag dividsed diagonally, with hoist lower part red and fly upper part white. Perhaps this flag was used before the ephemeral adoption of the white-red flag in late 1831.\n\nJaume Ollé,16 Apr 2000\n\nHistory of Poland is very complicated. Poland was part of Russian Empire, but (using today's terms) was occupied by Russia. Poland has dethroned Russian Czar's dynasty but they called themselves Kings of Poland until 1918.\n\nPeter 'Mikolaj' Mikolajski, 18 Sept 2000\n\nKingdom of Poland (Congressional) 1815-1830 flag\n\nby Adam Kromer, from his website.\n\nCzar's Ensign of Kingdom of Poland (Congressional) used on land only. This is Czar's banner rather than flag.\n\nAdam Kromer, translated by Peter 'Mikolaj' Mikolajski, 18 Sept 2000\n\nFlag of 1815\n\nby Adam Kromer, from his website.\n\nNovember Uprising (1830-1831)\n\nby Adam Kromer, from his website.\n\nFlag of Poland - constituted by Polish parliament in 1831. Flag is white-amarant.\n\nAdam Kromer, translated by Peter 'Mikolaj' Mikolajski, 18 Sept 2000\n\nPolish revolt of 1863\n\nby Jaume Ollé\n\nAccording to Cronologia Enciclopédica do Mundo Moderno (Encyclopedic Chronology of the Modern World), the Poles started an insurrection at 22 January 1863 against the Russian Empire. At 8 February 1863, Prussia formed an alliance with Russia to repress this revolt and in March, Russia divided Poland in provinces.\n\nJorge Candeias, 21 March 1998\n\nJanuary Uprising (1863-1864) flag\n\nby Adam Kromer, from his website."
