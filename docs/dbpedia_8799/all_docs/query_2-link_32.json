        "text": "Transcript\n\nSPEAKER: The January 6th attack on the US Capitol remains a dark stain on our nation's history.\n\nTINA SMITH: The attack on our Capitol and the attempted coup to overturn our democracy.\n\nBEN CARDIN: Where White supremacists and extremist groups displayed anti-Semitic and racist symbols and recited conspiracy theories blaming Jews for the pandemic.\n\nDICK DURBIN: Capitol Hill policemen were attacked and died as a result of that insurrectionist mob.\n\nAMY KLOBUCHAR: We all walked over that broken glass. We all saw the spray paint on the walls. We all stood huddled together in shelter.\n\nNARRATOR: On the afternoon of January 6th 2021, supporters of Donald Trump stormed the United States Capitol building. The attack was an effort to prevent certification of the results of the 2020 presidential election in which Democrat, Joe Biden, had defeated Republican, Donald Trump, the incumbent president.\n\nIn the months leading up to the election, Trump had pushed false claims that Democrats were planning to rig the results. After Trump lost, he promoted the falsehoods further and encouraged his supporters to attend a rally on January 6th to protest the congressional vote-counting ceremony. At the rally near the White House, Trump called on Vice President Mike Pence to stop the congressional proceedings and send the results back to the States to be recertified. Pence did not. Trump also called on the crowd to march on the Capitol.\n\nBefore Trump's speech had concluded, a mob of his supporters gathered around the Capitol building barriers. As people from the rally began to join them, the crowd broke through the barriers and overwhelmed police officers. Shortly after 2:00 PM, the mob breached the Capitol building forcing Congress to recess and be locked down.\n\nOver the next four hours, rioters ransacked offices and searched for their perceived enemies, including Pence and Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, before the Capitol was cleared with help from the National Guard and state troopers. At least seven people died as a result of the attack and over 140 police officers were injured.\n\nIn the following year, over 725 people involved in the attack were arrested for crimes, including assault on law enforcement personnel and seditious conspiracy to obstruct a congressional proceeding. However, as of December 2022, approximately 350 additional people suspected of committing violence during the attack remain unidentified.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
