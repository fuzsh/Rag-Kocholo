        "meta_description": "On Tuesday, 1 August 1944, at 5pm (known by the codename ‘W’ for ‘Wolność’ [freedom]), the Warsaw Uprising erupted. It was one of the most important and, at the same time, the most dramatic events in the history of the city. Though planned to take a few days, it lasted over two months.",

        "text": "The insurgents wanted to liberate the capital from German occupation before the arrival of the Soviet army, and thus ensure Poland’s sovereignty after the end of the war.\n\nInsurgent units, though numerous, lacked proper weapons and fought with a regular, fully militarised German army. Unfortunately, without the help of the Allies, they had no chance of winning. The help they had hoped for never came. Caught between the two powerful Soviet and German armies, the uprising slowly bled out.\n\nThe fate of Warsaw, known before the war as the ‘Paris of the East’, was sealed by the order of Heinrich Himmler, which said: “Every inhabitant must be killed, no prisoners are allowed, Warsaw is to be razed to the ground and in this way an intimidating example for the whole of Europe is to be created.”\n\nNearly 85% of the Polish capital was destroyed, and the population was expelled to transit and prisoner-of-war camps.\n\n1 August\n\nThe outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising. At 1.50pm in Żoliborz, nearby pl. Wilsona, the first fighting of the Uprising took place. 5pm – the official start of the Warsaw Uprising.\n\n2 August\n\nInsurgents seize strategic points including in the Old Town, Śródmieście, Powiśle and Czerniaków.\n\n5 August\n\n‘Black Saturday’ – the mass murder of civilians in Wola.\n\n20 August\n\nSeizing of the Polish Joint-Stock Telephone Company (the so-called PAST-a) building at 37/39 Zielna street. The insurgents take around 115 German prisoners.\n\n1 September\n\nGerman assault on the Old Town. The insurgents evacuate through canals to Śródmieście and Żoliborz.\n\n2 September\n\nDuring the early hours of the morning, tank shells smash Sigismund’s Column. The Germans capture the Old Town. Fighting in other parts of Warsaw continues.\n\n10 September\n\nThe Red Army begins an offensive from the Praga bank of the Vistula.\n\n18 September\n\n107 American B-17s make the biggest airdrop of weapons, ammunition, food and medicine. Unfortunately, the insurgents managed to pick up only 20 percent of what was dropped.\n\n2 October\n\nThe Uprising falls. The capitulation order is signed in Ożarów, bringing fighting in Warsaw to an end. The order grants the insurgents full prisoner-of-war status protected under the Geneva Convention, and offers protections to civilians in the city against liability for violating German regulations. During the following days, the insurgents are taken from the city to prisoner-of-war camps. Civilians from Warsaw, on the other hand, are sent to transit camps in Pruszków, Ursus, Włochy and Ożarów. Unfortunately, over 100,000 of them are sent for forced labour in the Reich and another several dozen thousand to concentration camps.\n\nThis memorial commemorates the tens of thousands of civilian residents of Warsaw murdered by the Germans in mass executions in 1944. The Warsaw Insurgents’ Cemetery is Poland’s largest war cemetery, and the small History Room houses a multimedia exhibition detailing the cemetery’s history and the committee responsible for maintaining it. A huge map of the city with thousands of red pins stuck into it serves as the centrepiece exhibit in the Hall of Testimonies. The pins indicate sites of executions, temporary sites of burials and exhumations of victims. It will be replaced in the future by a multimedia installation by Krzysztof Wodiczko, visual artist and lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, based on interviews with people who survived the trauma of the uprising.\n\nOn two sides of the building stands the Memorial Wall. Sixty-two thousand brass plaques with the names of known victims of the Uprising are fastened to it. A further thirty thousand are still waiting to be added.\n\nThe monument is located in an area where heavy and brutal fighting took place. It commemorates the heroism of the women who took part in the uprising serving as soldiers, nurses, or messengers, as well as the drama of thousands of Warsaw women, affected in different ways by the nightmare of war. The figures of three women of different ages hold hands in a gesture of closeness and solidarity. You can spot the distinctive insurgent armband on the arm of the central figure. The boulders placed around the monument symbolise the demolished city.\n\nContemporary artists pay tribute to the Insurgents also through modern art, which is why it is worth visiting the Rose Garden at the Museum of the Warsaw Uprising. There, you can see works by artists such as Wilhelm Sasnal and Henryk Chmielewski, more popularly known as Papcio Chmiel. Others murals have been painted, for example on the wall of the presbytery of the church of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the New Town, and on the wall of the Polonia football stadium on Konwiktorska street."
