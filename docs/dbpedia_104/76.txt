A Brampton high school posted a picture of their new principal on Twitter, but there was a huge backlash when people saw a certain book sitting on her desk.

The book is titled “The Guide for White Women Who Teach Black Boys.”

The Dufferin-Peel Catholic School Board is defending the principal at Cardinal Ambrozic Catholic Secondary School, saying although the book has a provocative title, it’s actually helpful when it comes to dealing with racial and cultural oppression in education.

Some people who saw the picture suggested the book was a sign of racism or incompetence while others said it might be a prop meant to improve the school’s image.

The picture was also shared by 6ixBuzzTV on Instagram, an account with about 1.2-million followers.
