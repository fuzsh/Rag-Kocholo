        "text": "Departmental Office: 515 Philosophy; 212-854-2500 or 212-854-3208\n\nhttp://www.columbia.edu/cu/french/\n\nDirector of Undergraduate Studies: Prof. Aubrey Gabel, 212-854-2500; aag2188@columbia.edu\n\nDirector of Academic Administration and Finance: Julie Stevens, 515 Philosophy; 212-854-7978; js4504@columbia.edu\n\nDirector of the Language Program: Pascale Hubert-Leiber, 212-854-4819; ph2028@columbia.edu\n\nThe Department of French offers a major and concentration in French and Francophone Studies. Both the major and concentration provide students with an overview of French and Francophone literature, culture, and history from the Middle Ages to the present.\n\nMajor in French and Francophone Studies\n\nThe major in French and Francophone Studies provides an interdisciplinary framework for the study of the history, literature, and culture of France and parts of the world in which French is an important medium of culture. Students explore the history and contemporary applications of concepts such as citizenship, national unity, secularism, and human rights, and explore central issues including universalism/relativism, tradition/modernity, and religion/state as they have developed in France and its colonies/former colonies since the 18th century.\n\nStudents take a series of required courses that includes:\n\nFREN UN3405 ADVANCED GRAMMAR AND COMPOSITION;\n\nFREN UN3409 INTRO TO FRENCH AND FRANCOPHONE HISTORY;\n\nFREN UN3410 INTRO TO FRENCH AND FRANCOPHONE LITERATURE;\n\nFREN UN3995 SENIOR SEMINAR.\n\nStudents also take advanced electives (at the 3000 or 4000 level) on French and francophone literature, culture, and history. A senior thesis is optional but encouraged.\n\nIn Fulfillment of the Language Requirement\n\nStudents beginning the study of French at Columbia must take four terms of the following two-year sequence: FREN UN1101-UN1102 Elementary French I & II, and FREN UN2101-UN2102 Intermediate French I & II.\n\nEntering students are placed, or exempted, on the basis of their College Board Achievement or Advanced Placement scores, or their scores on the placement test taken online: FRENCH PLACEMENT TEST. An SAT score of 780 or a score of 5 on the AP exam satisfies the language requirement. Students with a score of 4 on the AP exam will be placed in Intermediate II, but may attempt to place out by requesting to take an oral exam administered by the Director of the Language Program.\n\nPlease note: The Barnard course, FREN BC1204 Intermediate II does not fulfill the undergraduate language requirement.\n\nLanguage Proficiency Courses\n\nElementary and intermediate French courses help students develop an active command of the language. In FREN UN1101 ELEMENTARY FRENCH I and FREN UN1102 ELEMENTARY FRENCH II, the communicative approach is the main instructional method. In addition to practicing all four language skills—listening, speaking, reading, and writing—students are introduced to the cultural features of diverse French-speaking communities.\n\nIn intermediate courses FREN UN2101 INTERMEDIATE FRENCH I and FREN UN2102 INTERMEDIATE FRENCH II, students develop linguistic competence through the study of short stories, films, novels, and plays. After completing the four-semester language sequence, students can discuss and write in fairly proficient French on complex topics.\n\nAt the third-year level, attention is focused on more sophisticated use of language, in grammar and composition courses, and on literary, historical, and philosophical questions.\n\nConversation Courses\n\nStudents looking for intensive French oral practice may take some of the 2-point conversation courses offered at intermediate and advanced levels. Conversation courses generally may not be counted toward the major or concentration.\n\nAdvanced Placement\n\nAP score of 4 automatically places a student in French Intermediate II, thereby granting them the equivalency of the first 3 courses of the elementary-intermediate sequence.\n\nAP score of 5 or DELF: The department grants 3 credits for a score of 5 on the AP French Language exam, or for the completion of DELF (Diplôme d'Etudes en Langue Française). Students are awarded this credit only after they take a 3000-level French course (taught in French, for at least 3 points) and obtain a grade of B or above in that course.\n\nDALF C1 level or IB HL score of 6 or 7: The department grants 3 credits for the C1 level of DALF (Diplôme Approfondi de Langue Française), or for a score of 6 or 7 on the International Baccalaureate (IB) Higher Level (HL) exam. Students have no obligation to take higher-level French courses in order to receive these 3 credits, but restrictions apply on the use of these credits toward the French major.\n\nLanguage Laboratory and On-line Materials\n\nLanguage laboratories located in the International Affairs Building provide opportunities for intensive practice in French pronunciation and aural comprehension. French courses typically make extensive use of on-line interactive materials that students can access from their own computers.\n\nMaison Française\n\nStudents interested in French should acquaint themselves with the Maison Française, which houses a reading room of French newspapers, periodicals, books, and videos, and sponsors lectures/discussions and aby distinguished French visitors to New York City. With its weekly French film series as well as, book club, café-conversation. Another opportunity to practice French, discover new aspects of Francophone culture, and learn about internships and professional opportunities is the French Cultural Society. For information about the FCS, contact the departmental liaison, Dr. Laurence Marie. and other events, the Maison Française offers an excellent opportunity for students to perfect their language skills and enhance their knowledge of French and Francophone culture.\n\nStudy Abroad\n\nBecause a direct experience of contemporary French society is an important essential part of the program, majors and concentrators are strongly encouraged to spend either a semester or a year at Reid Hall-Columbia University in Paris, or at another French or Francophone university. During their time abroad, students take courses credited toward the major and, in some cases, also toward other majors (e.g. history, art history, political science) and the global core.\n\nFor information on study abroad, visit the OGP website at www.ogp.columbia.edu, call 212-854-2559, or e-mail studyabroad@columbia.edu. For a list of approved study abroad programs, visit http://www.ogp.columbia.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ListAll.\n\nSummer Study in Paris\n\nStudy abroad opportunities at Reid Hall are also available during the summer. These include language and culture courses, global core electives and a combined course that meets both Columbia’s ArtHum and MusicHum requirements.\n\nFor information about study abroad, visit https://global.undergrad.columbia.edu/studyabroad.\n\nGrading\n\nStudents who wish to use toward the major or concentration a course in which a grade of D has been received must consult with the director of undergraduate studies.\n\nDepartmental Honors\n\nMajors who wish to be considered for departmental honors should consult with the director of undergraduate studies. To be eligible for departmental honorse, students must have a grade point average of at least 3.7 in major courses and have completed an approved senior thesis under the guidance of a faculty member at Columbia or Reid Hall. Normally no more than 10% of graduating majors receive departmental honors in a given academic year.\n\nUndergraduate Prizes\n\nThe Department of French awards the following prizes to students enrolled in courses in the department:\n\nPrize for Excellence in French Studies: awarded to a highly promising student in an intermediate or advanced French course;\n\nSenior French Prize: awarded to an outstanding graduating major.\n\nMajor in French and Francophone Studies\n\nThe requirements for this program were modified on December 18, 2021. Students who declared this program before this date should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies for the department in order to confirm their correct course of study.\n\nThe program of study should be planned before the end of the sophomore year with the director of undergraduate studies.\n\nThe major in French and Francophone Studies requires a minimum of 30 points beyond completion of the language requirement (FREN UN2102 Intermediate Course II) (or advanced placement), distributed as follows:\n\nCourse List Code Title Points FREN UN3405Read, Think, Write in French FREN UN3409INTRO TO FRENCH ＆ FRANCOPHONE HISTORY FREN UN3410Intro French ＆ Francophone Literature FREN UN3995SENIOR SEMINAR\n\nNote the following:\n\nFREN BC3006 Composition and Conversation is not applicable to either the French and Francophone Studies major or the concentration.
