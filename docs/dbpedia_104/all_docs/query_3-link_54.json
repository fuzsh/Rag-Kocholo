        "text": "Waiter spilling coffee on me. And offer me are apron to clean! When I say to him: um no thank you, give me a towel to clean please, he replies \"it's okay it's okay!!!\" NO, that's not the tone. At the age of 23, we will have to learn what is politeness and the notion of service. Especially when we made a mistake! In short: NEVER AGAIN!!\n\nWe were hard up for a Saturday night dinner and felt lucky to get a same day reservation for a popular time. When we showed up, we were a bit concerned at what looked like a big, somewhat anonymous almost corporate operation, with multiple seating areas and team waiting. In fact, we left very pleased and impressed with the food, service and ambience. The food is of the neo-bistro style, and deftly conceived and executed, with plenty of offerings to choose among. We were particularly impressed with the duck main course we had. Not inexpensive, but fair for quality and service. €110 for two starters, two ducks, two desserts and coffee. Two good glasses of champagne and a bottle of Dolcetto added €66. Recommended and will probably go again.\n\nThis is the worst meal I’ve had in Paris in a very long time at any price point, but the service was the real low point. The server, a boy who was practically a teenager, would disappear for an hour at a time and totally ignore us. The food took forever to come out and was lukewarm and flavorless, like it had been sitting on the plate for at least 30 minutes before being brought to the table. Hideous experience never to be repeated.\n\nI would describe myself as a foodie and always try and book a restaurant in advance of coming to a city. I always look for somewhere that the locals recommend. Unfortunately our reservation fell through that we had booked (due to husband emailing in advice and not following through to where we were supposed to go to!!!!), anyhow we stumbled across this gem of a place THANK GOD! The food was exquisite - simple but still exciting and innovative. And they made my young children feel very welcome. I would definitely go back and recommend to anyone who appreciates good food. The wine was also delicious. Enjoy!\n\nI don't understand the mixed reviews. When we visited in April 2024 we had an wonderful dining experience. Granted, the decor is not as posh as some other Parisian restaurants and the kitchen is old fashioned but the quality of food and service is great. We loved it :-)\n\nThis place was highly recommended by my good friend Alfred who knows the right spots in Paris. Not only a delicious, healthy dinner but the best friendly and nice atmosphere. The young waiter Enzo was so sweet, with his smiling eyes and kind approach. Definitely recommended for an informal, pleasant stop in Paris.\n\nVery nice setting certainly, beautiful decor, nice neighborhood .. One server very friendly, the other (the boss?) rather closed and arrogant. I take a Nice salad revisited with poached eggs, poutargue, fines... Poached eggs turned out to be boiled eggs and poutargue salmon eggs. I always look for anchovies and fines. Inacceptable.! As for the plate of raw ham, not a pickle, a salad leaf or anything else. Some dishes, which corresponded to the description, looked decent, others without flavors. I don't recommend it. The box is not correlated with the content.\n\nWe enter this restaurant, listed in the Michelin guide (I really don't know why???), and no one sees us... Then someone nevertheless arrives, we say that we have reserved for 4, and the waiter replies, \" Ah, it's not me wait\"...it's off to a bad start....Well the setting is pleasant, minimalist and clear.. The dishes arrive, 4 asparagus floating in a soup with an improbable taste, 2 slices of overcooked duck breast accompanied by pureed and plain beets, it doesn't go together at all and it's bad, then a tiramisu of some sort ... They charge for tap water under the pretext that they have carbonated it, there are no small profits.... very bad experience, very expensive!!!!"
