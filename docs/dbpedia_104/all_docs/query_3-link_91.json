        "text": "In 2014 I made available a document containing material to assist GMs of the original Enemy Within campaign. It was 100 pages in length and was predictably called The Enemy Within: a Companion (TEWAC, for short).\n\nSince then I have continued to work on the document. In 2015 I released a sixth edition, which contained more than 200 pages of material, but by then the source files had become quite unstable.\n\nSo I embarked on a full rewrite. As you will understand, this has been a substantial undertaking. I have made considerable progress, but it is not yet complete.\n\nGiven the scale of the project, I have decided to release the seventh edition piecemeal. It will be divided into the following sections:\n\nCovers\n\nEndpapers\n\nTitle page and contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nPhase One (the journey to and events in BÃ¶genhafen)\n\nPhase Two (the Reik)\n\nPhase Three (Middenheim)\n\nPhase Four (Kislev)\n\nPhase Five (the finale)\n\nAppendices\n\nI will make them available in the order listed, with the exception of the title page and contents, which will be last for obvious reasons.\n\nThe covers, endpapers, introduction and Phase One material are available now. They can be downloaded here. The remaining parts will follow in due course.\n\nIf you have any problems downloading the files, please read this post.\n\nThere is an update on this project here.\n\nI have partially revised the Companion for the fourth-edition version of the campaign. See this post."
