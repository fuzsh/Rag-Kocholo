Law Implemented 400.497, 400.506 FS. History–New 2-9-93, Amended 1-27-94, 12-24-00, 5-4-15.\n\n59A-18.018 Emergency Management Plans.\n\n(1) Pursuant to Section 400.506(12), F.S., each nurse registry shall prepare and maintain a written comprehensive emergency management plan, in accordance with the Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan for Nurse Registries, AHCA Form 3110-1017, May 2015, incorporated by reference and available at https://www.flrules.org/Gateway/reference.asp?No=Ref-05234. This document is available from the Agency for Health Care Administration at http://ahca.myflorida.com/MCHQ/Emergency_Activities/index.shtml. The plan shall describe how the nurse registry establishes and maintains an effective response to emergencies and disasters. The plan, once completed, will be sent electronically to the contact designated by the Department of Health as required in Section 400.506(12), F.S.\n\n(2) The nurse registry shall review its emergency management plan on an annual basis and make any substantive changes. Plans with any substantive changes will be forwarded for review to the entities identified in subsection (1).\n\n(3) Changes in the telephone numbers of those administrative staff who are coordinating the nurse registry’s emergency response must be reported to the county emergency management office and to the county health department. For nurse registries with multiple counties on their license, the changes must be reported to each county health department and each county emergency management office. The telephone numbers must include numbers where the coordinating staff can be contacted outside of the nurse registry’s regular office hours. All nurse registries must report these changes, whether their plan has been previously reviewed or not, as defined in subsection (1).\n\n(4) When a nurse registry goes through a change of ownership, the new owner shall review the registry’s emergency management plan and make any substantive changes, including changes noted in subsection (3). Those nurse registries will need to report any substantive changes in their plans to the reviewing entity in subsection (1).\n\n(5) In the event of an emergency, the nurse registry shall implement the nurse registry’s emergency management plan pursuant to Section 400.506(12), F.S. Also, the registry must meet the following requirements:\n\n(a) All administrative staff shall be informed of responsibilities for implementing the emergency management plan.\n\n(b) If telephone service is not available during an emergency, the registry shall have a contingency plan to support communication, pursuant to Section 400.506(12)(f), F.S. A contingency plan may include cell phones, contact with a community based ham radio group, public announcements through radio or television stations, driving directly to the patient’s home, and, in medical emergency situations, contact with police or emergency rescue services.\n\n(6) Nurse registries shall assist patients who would need assistance and sheltering during evacuations because of physical, mental, or sensory disabilities in registering with the local emergency management agency, as required in Section 400.506(11), F.S.\n\n(a) Upon initial contract for services, and at a minimum on an annual basis, each nurse registry shall, pursuant to Sections 400.506(12) and 252.355, F.S., inform the patient and the patient’s family member or other person acting on behalf of the patient, by the best method possible as it pertains to the person’s disability, of the special needs registry and procedures for registration at the special needs registry maintained by their county emergency management office.\n\n(b) If the patient is to be registered at the special needs registry, the nurse registry shall assist the patient with registering, pursuant to Sections 400.506(12), F.S., and must document in the patient’s file if the patient plans to evacuate or remain at home; if the patient’s family or other person that provides care to the patient can take responsibility during the emergency for services normally provided by independent contractors referred by the registry; or if the registry needs to make referrals in order for services to continue. If the patient has a case manager through the Community Care for the Elderly or the Medicaid Waiver programs or any other state funded program designated in law to help patients and clients register with the special needs registry, then the nurse registry will check with the case manager to verify if the patient has already been registered. If so, a note will be made in the patient’s file by the nurse registry that the patient’s need for registration has already been reviewed and handled by the other program’s case manager.\n\n(c) The independent contractors referred by the nurse registry, or registry staff, shall inform patients registered with the special needs registry that special needs shelters are an option of last resort and that services may not be equal to what they have received in their homes.\n\n(d) This registration information, when collected, shall be submitted, pursuant to Section 400.506(12), F.S., to the county emergency management office.\n\n(7) The person referred for contract to a patient registered with the special needs registry, which shall include special needs registry patients being served in assisted living facilities and adult family care homes, shall ensure that the same type and quantity of continuous care is provided in the special needs shelter that was provided prior to the emergency as specified in Section 400.506(12), F.S., unless circumstances beyond the control of the independent contractor as described in Section 400.506(12)(d), F.S., make it impossible to continue services.\n\n(8) When a nurse registry is unable to continue services to special needs patients registered under Section 252.355, F.S., that patient’s record must contain documentation of the efforts made by the registry to comply with their emergency management plan in accordance with Section 400.506(12), F.S. Documentation includes but is not limited to contacts made to the patient’s family or other person that provides care, if applicable, contacts made to the assisted living facility and adult family care home if applicable; contacts made to local emergency operation centers to obtain assistance in reaching patients and contacts made to other agencies which may be able to provide temporary services.\n\n(9) When a state of emergency has been declared by executive order or proclamation of the Governor, pursuant to Section 252.36(2), F.S., the nurse registry must contact those patients needing ongoing services pursuant to Section 400.506(12)(a), F.S., and confirm each patient’s plan during and immediately following an emergency. The nurse registry shall contact the assisted living facility and adult family care home patients and confirm their plans during and immediately following an emergency.\n\n(10) If the independent contractor is unable to provide services to special needs registry patients, including any assisted living facility and adult family care home special needs registry patients, due to circumstances beyond their control pursuant to Section 400.506(12)(d), F.S., then the nurse registry will contact the independent contractors it has available for referral to find another independent contractor for the patient, pursuant to Section 400.506(12), F.S.\n\n(11) During emergency situations, when there is not a mandatory evacuation order issued by the local county emergency management office, some patients, registered pursuant to Section 252.355, F.S., may decide not to evacuate and will stay in their homes. The nurse registry must establish procedures, prior to the time of an emergency, which will delineate to what extent the registry will continue to arrange for care during and immediately following an emergency pursuant to Section 400.506(12)(a), F.S. The registry shall also contact the patients who need continuing services by calling the patient at home or calling the assisted living facility or adult family care home the patient resides in to determine if the patient still needs services from the registry and which patients have plans to receive care from their family or other persons. If the assisted living facility or adult family care home does relocate the residents to another assisted living facility or adult family care home in the geographic area served by the nurse registry, the registry will continue to provide services to the residents. If the patients relocated outside the area served by the registry, the registry will assist the assisted living facility and adult family care home in obtaining the services of another registry already licensed for that area until the patient returns back to their original location.\n\n(12) The prioritized list of registered special needs patients maintained by the nurse registry shall be kept current and shall include information, as defined in Sections 400.506(12)(b) and (c), F.S. This list also shall be furnished to county health departments and to the county emergency management office, upon request.\n\n(13) The independent contractor from the nurse registry is required to maintain in the home of the special needs patient a list of patient-specific medications, supplies and equipment required for continuing care and service should the patient be evacuated as per Section 400.506(12)(c), F.S. The list must include the names of all medications, their dose, frequency, route, time of day and any special considerations for administration. The list must also include any allergies; the name of the patient’s physician, physician assistant, or advanced registered nurse practitioner and the physician, physician assistant or advanced registered nurse practitioner’s phone number; and the name, phone number and address of the patient’s pharmacy. If the patient permits, the list can also include the patient’s diagnosis.\n\n(14) The patient record for each person registered as a special needs patient shall include the list described in subsection (13) above, and information as listed in Sections 400.506(12)(a) and (b), F.S.\n\nRulemaking Authority 400.506, 408.821(4) FS. Law Implemented 400.506 FS. History–New 8-10-06, Amended 3-15-07, 5-4-15.\n\nFlorida Statutes\n\n400.506 Licensure of nurse registries; requirements; penalties.—\n\n(1)(a) A nurse registry is exempt from the licensing requirements of a home health agency but must be licensed as a nurse registry. The requirements of part II of chapter 408 apply to the provision of services that require licensure pursuant to this section and ss. 400.509-400.518 and part II of chapter 408 and to entities licensed by or applying for such license from the Agency for Health Care Administration pursuant to this section and ss. 400.509-400.518. A license issued by the agency is required for the operation of a nurse registry. Each operational site of the nurse registry must be licensed, unless there is more than one site within the health service planning district for which a license is issued. In such case, each operational site within the health service planning district must be listed on the license.\n\n(b) A licensed nurse registry may operate a satellite office as defined in s. 400.462. The nurse registry operational site must administer all satellite offices. A satellite office may store supplies and records, register and process contractors, and conduct business by telephone as is done at other operational sites. Nurse registries may use signs and advertisements to notify the public of the location of a satellite office. All original records must be kept at the operational site.\n\n(c) A nurse registry must provide notice, in writing, to the agency at the state and area office levels, as required by agency rule, of a proposed change of address for an operational site or the opening of a satellite office. Before relocating an operational site or opening a satellite office, the nurse registry must submit evidence of its legal right to use the proposed property and evidence that the property is zoned for nurse registry use.\n\n(2) Each applicant for licensure and each licensee must comply with all provisions of part II of chapter 408 and this section.\n\n(3) In accordance with s. 408.805, an applicant or licensee shall pay a fee for each license application submitted under this section and ss. 400.509-400.518, part II of chapter 408, and applicable rules. The amount of the fee shall be established by rule and may not exceed $2,000 per biennium.\n\n(4) A person that provides, offers, or advertises to the public any service for which licensure is required under this section must include in such advertisement the license number issued to it by the Agency for Health Care Administration. The agency shall assess a fine of not less than $100 against any licensee who fails to include the license number when submitting the advertisement for publication, broadcast, or printing. The fine for a second or subsequent offense is $500.\n\n(5)(a) In addition to the requirements of s. 408.812, any person who owns, operates, or maintains an unlicensed nurse registry and who, within 10 working days after receiving notification from the agency, fails to cease operation and apply for a license under this part commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. Each day of continued operation is a separate offense.\n\n(b) If a nurse registry fails to cease operation after agency notification, the agency may impose a fine of $500 for each day of noncompliance.\n\n(6)(a) A nurse registry may refer for contract in private residences registered nurses and licensed practical nurses registered and licensed under part I of chapter 464, certified nursing assistants certified under part II of chapter 464, home health aides who present documented proof of successful completion of the training required by rule of the agency, and companions or homemakers for the purposes of providing those services authorized under s. 400.509(1). A licensed nurse registry shall ensure that each certified nursing assistant referred for contract by the nurse registry and each home health aide referred for contract by the nurse registry has presented credentials demonstrating that he or she is adequately trained to perform the tasks of a home health aide in the home setting. Each person referred by a nurse registry must provide current documentation that he or she is free from communicable diseases.\n\n(b) A certified nursing assistant or home health aide may be referred for a contract to provide care to a patient in his or her home only if that patient is under a physician’s care. A certified nursing assistant or home health aide referred for contract in a private residence shall be limited to assisting a patient with bathing, dressing, toileting, grooming, eating, physical transfer, and those normal daily routines the patient could perform for himself or herself were he or she physically capable. A certified nursing assistant or home health aide may not provide medical or other health care services that require specialized training and that may be performed only by licensed health care professionals. The nurse registry shall obtain the name and address of the attending physician and send written notification to the physician within 48 hours after a contract is concluded that a certified nursing assistant or home health aide will be providing care for that patient.\n\n(c) When a certified nursing assistant or home health aide is referred to a patient’s home by a nurse registry, the nurse registry shall advise the patient, the patient’s family, or any other person acting on behalf of the patient at the time the contract for services is made that registered nurses are available to make visits to the patient’s home for an additional cost.\n\n(d) A registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, certified nursing assistant, companion or homemaker, or home health aide referred for contract under this chapter by a nurse registry is deemed an independent contractor and not an employee of the nurse registry regardless of the obligations imposed on a nurse registry under this chapter or chapter 408.\n\n(e) Upon referral of a registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, certified nursing assistant, companion or homemaker, or home health aide for contract in a private residence or facility, the nurse registry shall advise the patient, the patient’s family, or any other person acting on behalf of the patient, at the time of the contract for services, that the caregiver referred by the nurse registry is an independent contractor and that it is not the obligation of a nurse registry to monitor, supervise, manage, or train a caregiver referred for contract under this chapter.\n\n(7) A person who is referred by a nurse registry for contract in private residences and who is not a nurse licensed under part I of chapter 464 may perform only those services or care to clients that the person has been certified to perform or trained to perform as required by law or rules of the Agency for Health Care Administration or the Department of Business and Professional Regulation. Providing services beyond the scope authorized under this subsection constitutes the unauthorized practice of medicine or a violation of the Nurse Practice Act and is punishable as provided under chapter 458, chapter 459, or part I of chapter 464.\n\n(8) Each nurse registry must require every applicant for contract to complete an application form providing the following information:\n\n(a) The name, address, date of birth, and social security number of the applicant.\n\n(b) The educational background and employment history of the applicant.\n\n(c) The number and date of the applicable license or certification.\n\n(d) When appropriate, information concerning the renewal of the applicable license, registration, or certification.\n\n(e) Proof of completion of a continuing educational course on modes of transmission, infection control procedures, clinical management, and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome with an emphasis on appropriate behavior and attitude change. Such instruction shall include information on current Florida law and its effect on testing, confidentiality of test results, and treatment of patients and any protocols and procedures applicable to human immunodeficiency virus counseling and testing, reporting, offering HIV testing to pregnant women, and partner notification issues pursuant to ss. 381.004 and 384.25.\n\n(9) Each nurse registry must comply with the background screening requirements in s. 400.512 for all persons referred for contract. However, an initial screening may not be required for persons who have been continuously registered with the nurse registry since October 1, 2000.\n\n(10) The nurse registry must maintain the application on file, and that file must be open to the inspection of the Agency for Health Care Administration. The nurse registry must maintain on file the name and address of the patient or client to whom nurse registry personnel are referred for contract and the amount of the fee received by the nurse registry. A nurse registry must maintain the file that includes the application and other applicable documentation for 3 years after the date of the last file entry of patient-related or client-related information.\n\n(11) Nurse registries shall assist persons who would need assistance and sheltering during evacuations because of physical, mental, or sensory disabilities in registering with the appropriate local emergency management agency pursuant to s. 252.355.\n\n(12) Each nurse registry shall prepare and maintain a comprehensive emergency management plan that is consistent with the criteria in this subsection and with the local special needs plan. The plan shall be updated annually. The plan shall include the means by which the nurse registry will continue to provide the same type and quantity of services to its patients who evacuate to special needs shelters which were being provided to those patients prior to evacuation. The plan shall specify how the nurse registry shall facilitate the provision of continuous care by persons referred for contract to persons who are registered pursuant to s. 252.355 during an emergency that interrupts the provision of care or services in private residences. Nurse registries may establish links to local emergency operations centers to determine a mechanism by which to approach specific areas within a disaster area in order for a provider to reach its clients. Nurse registries shall demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of this subsection by documenting attempts of staff to follow procedures outlined in the nurse registry’s comprehensive emergency management plan which support a finding that the provision of continuing care has been attempted for patients identified as needing care by the nurse registry and registered under s. 252.355 in the event of an emergency under this subsection.\n\n(a) All persons referred for contract who care for persons registered pursuant to s. 252.355 must include in the patient record a description of how care will be continued during a disaster or emergency that interrupts the provision of care in the patient’s home. It shall be the responsibility of the person referred for contract to ensure that continuous care is provided.\n\n(b) Each nurse registry shall maintain a current prioritized list of patients in private residences who are registered pursuant to s. 252.355 and are under the care of persons referred for contract and who need continued services during an emergency. This list shall indicate, for each patient, if the client is to be transported to a special needs shelter and if the patient is receiving skilled nursing services. Nurse registries shall make this list available to county health departments and to local emergency management agencies upon request.\n\n(c) Each person referred for contract who is caring for a patient who is registered pursuant to s. 252.355 shall provide a list of the patient’s medication and equipment needs to the nurse registry. Each person referred for contract shall make this information available to county health departments and to local emergency management agencies upon request.\n\n(d) Each person referred for contract shall not be required to continue to provide care to patients in emergency situations that are beyond the person’s control and that make it impossible to provide services, such as when roads are impassable or when patients do not go to the location specified in their patient records.\n\n(e) The comprehensive emergency management plan required by this subsection is subject to review and approval by the county health department. During its review, the county health department shall contact state and local health and medical stakeholders when necessary. The county health department shall complete its review to ensure that the plan complies with the criteria in the Agency for Health Care Administration rules within 90 days after receipt of the plan and shall either approve the plan or advise the nurse registry of necessary revisions. If a nurse registry fails to submit a plan or fails to submit requested information or revisions to the county health department within 30 days after written notification from the county health department, the county health department shall notify the Agency for Health Care Administration.
