        "text": "Starfield companions can be found all over the galaxy. They give your crew unique benefits and make space adventuring a little less lonely. You can only have one companion by your side as you explore the RPG's many, many planets, but that doesn't mean the others are entirely benched. Companions keep the lights on while you deal with other problems, so you'll need to choose how to use them carefully.\n\nStarfield companions break down into three categories: Constellation companions, unique companions, and no-name companions. The four main Constellation companions are the only ones you can speak to regularly and pursue a romance with. The rest of Starfield's companions exist to help you staff your ship and outpost, and only the unique companions can have side missions connected to them.\n\nEach of Starfield's companions has their own set of skills, which can help you decide what kind of role to assign them. Constellation leader Sarah Morgan, for example, is good at astrodynamics and will let you \"grav jump\" (faster-than-light travel) further with your ship if she's assigned to it. If you take her with you on foot instead, she'll use her skill in laser weapons to help you in combat.\n\nStarfield's main companions, who are all members of Constellation, can join you early on if you focus on the main story missions. They'll each ask you if they can tag along, and, even if you say no, will always be available to recruit at The Lodge in New Atlantis (Jemison, Alpha Centauri system).\n\nHow to recruit Starfield companions\n\nHow to recruit Starfield companions\n\nStarfield companions are simple to recruit. All you have to do is find a companion, speak to them, and agree to hire them. You can ask questions about their skills and personal life to get to know them better, and you can often persuade them into a cheaper recruitment cost.\n\nKeep in mind that there are a few companions that require you to finish a certain mission to unlock them, which I've noted below. And some unique companions seem to show up on their own schedules. If you don't see one of the unique companions below, try waiting until the afternoon.\n\nOnce a companion agrees to join, you will be automatically taken to the crew menu to assign them to your ship or outposts. You can change their position at any time from there, too.\n\nWhere to find Constellation Starfield companions\n\nWhere to find every Constellation Starfield companion\n\nSarah Morgan\n\nAstrodynamics: ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nLasers: ⭐⭐⭐\n\nLeadership: ⭐⭐\n\nBotany: ⭐\n\nMission: The Old Neighborhood\n\nSarah Morgan is the voice found in many of Starfield's trailers and a character you meet very early in the story. She is the chair of Constellation, the group of explorers who spearhead much of the RPG's plot. This ex-soldier is adept in combat and long-distance space travel. As long as you don't break any laws, she'll be happy to work with you.\n\nBarrett\n\nStarship engineering: ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nParticle Beam Weapon Systems: ⭐⭐⭐\n\nRobotics: ⭐⭐\n\nGastronomy: ⭐\n\nMission: Back to Vectera\n\nBarrett seems to have lost any fear of the unknown a while before you come along. He's the bravest member of Constellation and quite slippery to track down once he's set his mind on something. His ship repair skills are clutch in space battles and he's no slouch in combat either. His drive to uncover the mystery at the core of the plot can be dangerous, but he'll like you as long as you take him at his word.\n\nSam Coe\n\nPiloting: ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nRifle Certification: ⭐⭐⭐\n\nPayloads: ⭐⭐\n\nGeology: ⭐\n\nMission: The Empty Nest\n\nSam Coe is surprisingly old-school for a man who lives in a sci-fi future. He was a member of the Freestar Rangers, a peacekeeping force that operates in Starfield's independent systems, and is trying to escape his father's shadow. Sam, and his daughter Cora, are nice to have around on your journey as long as you avoid aligning yourself with the United Colonies, the pervading government in Starfield.\n\nAndreja\n\nStealth: ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nParticle Beams: ⭐⭐⭐\n\nEnergy Weapon Systems: ⭐⭐\n\nTheft: ⭐\n\nMission: Into the Unknown\n\nAndreja is a big question mark. She's the most independent member of Constellation and refuses to explain why. Her skills tell a story though: She's exceptional at stealth and combat, and dabbles in a little thievery. The trust between you and her is thin, however, so don't say or do anything to break it.\n\nWhere to find every unique Starfield companion\n\nStarfield's non-Constellation companions are all over the place. They can be found in the main cities, usually in bars, and within certain missions. The companions with unique names, like Mickey Caviar, seem to hang out on a schedule in one location. When you find them, you can get to know them and decide whether you want to drop the credits to hire them.\n\nYou'll find other companions who don't have unique names, but have titles like \"Outpost Engineering Specialist'' and \"Laser Weapons Specialist\" instead. These companions seem to show up randomly and come with random skills, so we can't tell you where to find specific ones. If we learn of a way to do that, we'll update the guide accordingly.\n\nHere are the unique companions we've found so far, their locations, the cost to hire them, and their skills:\n\nMain mission Starfield companions\n\nLin\n\nMission: Back to Vectera\n\nSkills:\n\nDemolitions: ⭐\n\nOutpost Management: ⭐⭐⭐\n\nVasco\n\nMission: One Small Step\n\nSkills:\n\nAneutronic Fusion: ⭐\n\nShield Systems: ⭐\n\nEM Weapon Systems: ⭐\n\nHeller\n\nMission: Back to Vectera\n\nSkills:\n\nGeology: ⭐\n\nOutpost Engineering: ⭐⭐⭐\n\nNew Atlantis Starfield companions\n\nMarika Boros\n\nLocation: The Viewport, New Atlantis\n\nCredits: 13,500\n\nSkills:\n\nShotgun Certification: ⭐\n\nBallistics: ⭐⭐\n\nParticle Beam Weapon Systems: ⭐\n\nGideon Aker\n\nLocation: The Viewport, New Atlantis\n\nCredits: 18,000\n\nSkills:\n\nBallistic Weapon Systems: ⭐⭐\n\nMissile Weapon Systems: ⭐⭐\n\nSimeon Bankowski\n\nLocation: The Viewport, New Atlantis\n\nCredits: 15,000\n\nSkills:\n\nSharpshooting: ⭐\n\nSniper Certification: ⭐⭐\n\nMarksmanship: ⭐\n\nRafael Aguerro\n\nRequires: Save him on the Entangled mission\n\nLocation: The Viewport, New Atlantis\n\nSkills:\n\nOutpost Engineering:⭐\n\nStarpost Engineering:⭐⭐\n\nOutpost Management: ⭐\n\nAkila Starfield companions\n\nRosie Tannehill\n\nLocation: The Hitching Post, Akila\n\nCredits: 18,000\n\nSkills:\n\nMedicine: ⭐\n\nWellness: ⭐⭐⭐\n\nOmari Hassan\n\nLocation: The Hitching Post, Akila\n\nCredits: 13,500\n\nSkills:\n\nShield Systems: ⭐⭐⭐\n\nStarship Engineering: ⭐\n\nEzekiel\n\nLocation: Aggie's Bar, Akila\n\nCredits: Free\n\nSkills:\n\nScavenging: ⭐\n\nEnergy Weapon Dissipation: ⭐⭐\n\nShield Systems: ⭐\n\nLyle Brewer\n\nLocation: Aggie's Bar, Akila\n\nCredits: 12,000\n\nSkills:\n\nParticle Beams: ⭐\n\nXenosociology: ⭐\n\nShotgun Certification: ⭐⭐\n\nNeon Starfield companions\n\nMickey Caviar\n\nLocation: Astral Lounge, Neon\n\nCredits: 13,500\n\nSkills:\n\nGastronomy: ⭐\n\nWellness: ⭐⭐\n\nIncapacitation: ⭐\n\nDani Garcia\n\nLocation: Euphorika, Neon\n\nCredits: 12,000\n\nSkills:\n\nChemistry: ⭐\n\nRobotics: ⭐⭐\n\nEnergy Weapon Systems: ⭐\n\nCydonia Starfield companions\n\nMoara Otero\n\nRequires: Finish The Old Neighborhood mission\n\nLocation: Broken Spear, Cydonia\n\nCredits: Free\n\nSkills:\n\nEM Weapon Systems: ⭐⭐\n\nMarksmanship: ⭐⭐\n\nAndromeda Kepler\n\nLocation: Broken Spear, Cydonia\n\nCredits: 15,000\n\nSkills:\n\nOutpost Engineering: ⭐⭐\n\nPiloting: ⭐\n\nAneutronic Fusion: ⭐\n\nOther unique Starfield companions"
