        "text": "In the interest of accomplishing the Mission of HKIS and effectively nurturing a collegial community of trust and mutual respect, each Board member, both new and returning, signs a Board compact annually, which stipulates the expectation, responsibilities and standards of behavior detailed below.\n\nI. Commitment to the Mission\n\nHKIS’s stated Mission is “Dedicating our minds to inquiry, our hearts to compassion, and our lives to service and global understanding. An American-style education grounded in the Christian faith and respecting the spiritual lives of all.” All of the Board’s deliberations and efforts are directed towards advancing this stated mission of the school, the related Student Learning Results, and the overall interests and well-being of the students of HKIS.\n\nII. Standards of Behavior\n\nThe Board views diversity and different points of view as a source of strength. Board members commit to respect and to listen to each other, to contribute input candidly and constructively, and to work to understand differing points of view, building towards a broad consensus as much as possible.\n\nBoard Members respect and diligently guard the confidentiality of all discussions and the materials prepared to support them. Board members understand the critical importance of effective communication and the value of \"no surprises\" in terms of mutual credibility.\n\nThe Board seeks to continuously improve its own performance and supports the application of governance \"best practices.” Board and Committee priorities are agreed upon at the start of the school year, and candid evaluations of the performance of individual Board members as well as the Board collectively are conducted annually.\n\nIII. Behavior in the Community\n\nThe Board supports the Head of School, the school and its mission collectively and individually. Board members strive to be highly visible and engaged in the school community including demonstrating leadership in Advancement and giving activities. Board members must “walk the talk” exhibiting behaviors that reflect the core values of the school: integrity, fairness, respect and collegiality. Board members seek to promote trust and mutual respect within our community. Board members are expected to lead by example in striving for a positive, constructive and cooperative climate when interacting with students, parents, faculty, staff, administration, fellow Board members and any non-HKIS community members.\n\nAs part of a leadership team that values collegiality, Board members consciously act ex camera in unison with the decisions of the Board, accepting and supporting Board decisions. Once a decision has been made, the Board speaks with one voice.\n\nBoard members are expected to adhere to their roles of governance and leadership, not management. Community members often recognize individual trustees as Board members, and this imposes the need for extra caution in terms of what Board members do and say. Individual Board members do not become involved directly in specific management, personnel or curricular issues. Board members are expected to separate the needs of the school from the needs of any particular child or constituency. Board members focus on HKIS policies, strategic direction, and business in Board meetings, and use appropriate channels to raise issues and concerns as parents.\n\nIV. Working through the Proper Channels and Process\n\nBoard members work cooperatively and positively through the established channels at HKIS for communications and decision-making. Board members, individually and collectively respect the importance of process in civil community and endeavor to utilize and improve such channels.\n\nThe Board treats with fairness, impartiality and respect all input received from members of the school community and directs and follows up on such input in accordance with the BOM’s norms and processes, including established procedures and channels of communication for complaints or grievances. Due diligence is exercised in assessing inputs to, and actions proposed by, the BOM.\n\nV. Leadership in Giving\n\nThe success of a learning community is based on the individual contributions of many, and as leaders at HKIS The Board of Managers has a unique opportunity to shape the culture and philanthropic spirit of the School.\n\nAs a model for parent and community involvement, the Board of Managers is expected to set the standard for others. Through our leadership participation in the Annual Fund and other giving opportunities, The Board provides support for programs that lift an HKIS student’s educational experience from excellent to exceptional.\n\nAs leaders within the community, the Board has shown its commitment to personal involvement at HKIS. By demonstrating leadership in service and giving, The Board provides the appropriate model for the community.\n\nVI. Conflicts of Interest"
