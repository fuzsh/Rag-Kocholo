        "text": "The gusle has been a powerful symbolic marker of authentic, vernacular nationalism for Dinaric people of the Balkans. This one-stringed bowed instrument of limited tonal range is used to accompany performances of epic songs. During the Croatian national movement of the 1830s-40s, the emblematic symbolism of the instrument radiated the South Slavic sense of ethnic unity. The Croatian urban classes developed a taste for improvised traditional epics, but also for the newly composed patriotic poetry imitating their style. Accordingly, the instrument itself became a frequent and revered topos for painters, with representations ranging from the realistic to the symbolic, included in places such as the masthead of the Vienac, the main Croatian weekly magazine for literature and culture; the stage curtain of the national theatre in Zagreb; and historicist paintings commissioned to decorate public places. Such symbolical usage of the gusle continued after the foundation of the Yugoslav state in 1918, when the motif began to carry a Yugoslav national meaning. This changed in the mid-twentieth century when the instrument became a nationalistic symbol appropriated by each nation for its own propaganda, leading to the most extreme situation in the Bosnian war of 1991-95, when the Serbian brigades included a permanent military guslar, responsible for rising the fighting spirit. As modern epics address less historical subjects and talk more about current political, religious and social issues, the decoration on the gusle’s neck—which was in the nineteenth century usually plain—developed into a fanciful visual symbolism complimenting the nationalism, heroism, patriotism and resistance, addressed in the recited verses. In the nineteenth century the symbolism of the gusle was reflected through its depictions and literary metaphors; in the later part of the twentieth century the instrument itself became an object carrying a symbolic message."
