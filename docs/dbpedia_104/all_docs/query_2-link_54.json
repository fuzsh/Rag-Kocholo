Mcdonell, MA\n\nInnis College offers its 1,500 students high academic standards, a dedicated faculty and staff, and a vibrant undergraduate community within the University of Toronto. Innis contributes four interdisciplinary programs to the Faculty of Arts and Science, listed under “Innis College\" in the calendar: Cinema Studies; Environmental Studies; Urban Studies; and Writing, Rhetoric and Critical Analysis. College academic services include the library, the writing centre, and the math/stats centre and are designed to ease the transition to university and support Innis students throughout their university careers.\n\nFounded in 1964 and named in honour of the late Harold Innis, political economist and pioneer in communication studies, Innis College is housed in a unique three-story building that blends old and new styles by incorporating a substantial Victorian home into a functional modern structure. At the core is the Town Hall, a forum-style auditorium. Classrooms and offices for the 25 professors associated with the College and its programs occupy the second and third floors. A library, a café with an outdoor patio, a rooftop garden, and study, lounge and student union space complete the facilities. Across the street, the Innis Residence is a modern apartment-style complex featuring 327 single rooms in four- or five-bedroom suites. The residence houses a diverse community of Innis students and students from professional faculties.\n\nInnis is the only undergraduate college at U of T that ensures equal representation of faculty and staff and students in its decision-making process. With its unique governance structure, innovative academic programming, independent community living, civic outreach, and informed activism, Innis College has created a community in which students can flourish academically and socially.\n\nNew College\n\nPrincipal\n\nD.

The College maintains particular library strengths in these areas as well as in English, History and Philosophy. Classes and tutorials are offered in the College in co-operation with Departments of the University.\n\nThe College's limited enrolment fosters a sense of community among faculty and students.

The College Library, Chapel, Buttery, dining halls, common rooms, theatre, and sports areas are provided for the benefit of both the commuting non-resident and resident students. Nearly 30% of the College students live in residence. The men of the College are primarily accommodated in the Main Quadrangle. Women students are accommodated primarily in St. Hilda s College. The Gerald Larkin Academic Building, on Devonshire Place, includes lecture rooms and offices of many of the teaching staff together with the Language Laboratory, Writing Centre, and lockers for commuting students.
