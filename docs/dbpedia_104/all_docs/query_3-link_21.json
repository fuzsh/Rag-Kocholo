        "text": "We have ten revealed companions so far, three of which have their subclass fixed as part of the story (Fiend Warlock Wyll, Trickery Domain Shadowheart, Oath of Vengeance Minthara). I was wondering what people would pick for the other seven, or what they're expecting to get if the character's subclass is fixed. My thoughts:\n\nLae'Zel: Eldritch Knight for sure; she's a Gith, and they're known for psionic powers.\n\nAstarion: Bloodthirsty vampire just screams Assassin to me, though their pnp features don't seem like they'd translate well to a video game. I'm assuming Larian homebrews something useful; if not, I suppose Arcane Trickster's magic fits a vampire thematically a bit.\n\nGale: I'm actually not sure which school would fit him best. Interested to hear what other people say.\n\nKarlach: Definitely seems like a Berserker. The community update said she's \"a beast in battle, but if she gets too worked up, she'll destroy anything she touches - including you.\"\n\nMinsc: Gloomstalker will probably be best if we end up spending a lot of time in the Underdark, but I think Beastmaster is most fitting, if his animal companion can actually be Boo, who can actually go for the eyes.\n\nJaheira: She was a multiclass fighter-druid in BG1-2, so I'd lean towards Spores. My understanding (though I've never played as a Druid, so correct me if I'm wrong) is that Land is focused on casting, while Spores synergize better with a melee attacker. That sounds more her style.\n\nHalsin: Moon, for sure. The guy talks about shapeshifting all the time, so of course he'll be in the shapeshifting subclass."
