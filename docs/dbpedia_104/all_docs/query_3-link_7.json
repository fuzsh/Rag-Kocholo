        "text": "Navigating the education system: when and why to consider changing schools The costs of education, both financial and otherwise, are a huge consideration for parents. While private schools promise extra attention and resources, state schools are now showing they can also lead to top universities like Oxbridge. There's no one-size-fits-all approach - what works for one child may not for another. What are the pros and cons of switching between state and private at different stages? Moving early, around ages 7-8, can help children who need more nurturing or aren't thriving in a big state primary school class. Prep schools welcome new students here. At 11, private schools seek the brightest through reasoning-focused exams, but state grammars are intensely competitive. Either way, tutoring from Year 5 helps. Later on, independent sixth forms boast strong Oxbridge records but scholarships there can offset costs. Many opt for state schools instead for social diversity, subject choice and a fresh start. Catchment areas and religious requirements also relax. Whenever you switch, it's never too late to find the right fit.

Wolsey Hall Oxford believes that Primary education forms the bedrock of a child’s learning journey – providing them with the essential skills and knowledge needed to navigate the challenges of the modern world. It is during these early years that children develop fundamental cognitive, social and emotional abilities that will shape their future.
