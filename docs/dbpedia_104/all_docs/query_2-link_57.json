        "text": "SLAVE LAKE, Alta. — Many retail employees have faced snarling, rowdy customers, but it’s not often that the customer is a bear. Recently, Sam Assaf opened the door to look out of his Slave Lake, Alta. barbershop when he noticed a black bear outside. Curious, Assaf took photos of the creature, but then it suddenly dawned on him that the large beast was heading into his shop. “I’ve been in this business for 17 years and I’ve never seen anything like it,” he told CTV Edmonton, recounting that the bear went on to defecate on the floor and rifle through his workstation. The bear eventually departed, but for Assaf, he has a funny story for life. “How ironic — a bear is hanging at [his barbershop] the Lionsden.”"
