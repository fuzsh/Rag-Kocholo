The ancient Maya called it their Way (pronounced ‘Why’, and the plural is “Wayob“) and the Maya today call it their nahual/nawale (pronounced nah-waal). The 20 Wayob are the 20 sacred calendar day signs.\n\nSpirit-companions take many forms like an animal (e.g., reptile, bird, jaguar), elements of nature (e.g ., rain, lightning, wind, fire), or important objects to the Maya such as obsidian. The glyph for spirit companion can be seen above, the left side of the glyph is a human face and the right side is a jaguar pelt.\n\nYour birthdate defines what spirit companion you have and also explains your character traits."
