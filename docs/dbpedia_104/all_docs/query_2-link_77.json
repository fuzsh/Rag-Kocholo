        "text": ") 2018 was cancelled. Forum (a public meeting for open discussion or expression of ideas ) began in 1979 as High School Forum and this is just the second time in its history I have had to cancel. The only other time when Forum did not have enough participants to happen was in 2008. The theme that year was Radical Awakening in an Evolutionary Era with Sister Gail Worcelo, Jan Novotka and Fr. Joe Mitchell C.P. All three, Gail, Jan and Joe were students for many years of Passionist Priest Thomas Berry RIP the leading Catholic cultural historian, ecotheologian and environmental thinker.\n\nI suspect the topic may have been a little too far ahead of the curve. Certainly schools and teachers were trying to be more environmentally friendly but there was not too much theology for teachers or students behind the many activities.\n\nForum 2018 Dignity, Difference and Dialogue : Theology in Context with Tina Beattie and Catherine Cavanagh was intended\n\nto address issues of diversity and inclusion specifically in the Canadian Catholic school context as a reflection of Catholicity within society as a whole; in other words it would examine how we struggle with issues such as race, gender, LGBT concerns, religious difference and poverty in our Catholic schools, issues that are absolutely contemporary.\n\nWhen High School Forum began in 1979, it was aimed at religious education teachers in Catholic high schools. Although the Canadian Forum on Theology and Education had a broader perspective, it was religious education teachers who, until recently, provided the majority of participants.\n\nIâm an old fart and, despite the fact that three of my children and my son-in-law are all secondary teachers and my granddaughters are in Grade 6, and the younger in Grade 3 I donât seem to understand very well what is going on with teachers, chaplains and administrators in the Catholic schools in Ontario. Forum, since it began in 1979, had brought in some of the finest contemporary Catholic theologians, educators and authors, not only from North America but also from England, Ireland, Spain, Australia and South Africa. I think I can say that most, if not all of them, did not present anywhere else in Ontario.\n\nA column in the Toronto Star (\n\n)\n\nMany people are surprised when I tell them that Cardinal \"Big Al\" Ambrozic was supportive of Forum. I spent a day with him, including lunch and dinner, talking about Forum. His big problem with me was that I did not drink wine! Cardinal Ambrozic, like all of us, had problemsâ¦his treatment of Joanna Manningâ¦but he had a brain, he read and he talked with me (at least). The Collins and Bergies just pontificate from their âStar Chambers\" and refuse to engage.\n\nI am equally delighted when I recall the thousands of Catholic teachers whom I have met as we all shared the incredible experiences, both educational and liturgical, of Forum. When I told Tina Beattie that Forum 2018 was likely to be cancelled she responded, â I shall be very sorry but I shall also bask in the opportunity to spend more time with my grandchildren.â I have been be doing exactly the same.\n\nNora and I have four children three of whom are teachers.\n\nCorey, our eldest, married Kalyna Canadian Thanksgiving weekend 2018 in a Ukrainian Catholic ceremony during Eucharist, and live about five minutes from us here in St. Catharines. They are expecting their first child. Kalynaâs mother would have liked a full-blown three or four hour extravaganza, but the bride and groom were having none of it. I knew it was going to be ok when Nora and I took Kalynaâs parents out to dinner sometime before the wedding and I told them I could not stand pierogiesâ¦and the wedding was still on.\n\nAt the reception one of Kalynaâs brothers, Nestor,who was a very good soccer player whom I had coached asked if I was still coaching. I told him no, unless he considered my going in the garden with my then eight and five year-old granddaughters and hoping they donât kick the ball too hard. Corey teaches at Holy Cross CSS about five minutes from where we live and is the school Nora taught at for her last fifteen years before she retired.\n\nSiobhan, has been married to Trevor now for maybe fifteen years. They have two beautiful daughters Taryn 11, and Elliott (Ellie )8. They are both voracious readers so grandad is always bringing them boxes of books. Have to keep an ever-growing list of what they have read. They live about two hours away in Brooklin, Ontario. Siobhan and Trevor both teach at All Saints Catholic high school in Whitby. Our daughter Siobhan sent us this exchange she had with our youngest granddaughter Elliott(Ellie) after she returned home from a long weekend with us.\n\nEllie: Grandma and Grandad are the best\n\nSiobhan: Why?\n\nEllie: Because they let you do things your parents donât and they buy you things your parents wonât.\n\nWhilst they were with us we took Taryn and Ellie to see the Shaw Festival production of A Christmas Carol which they loved. We also took them to see the Garden City Productions (\n\nand the Beast with the same response. They let you do things refers to the amount of time we let them watch televisionâ¦not a lot but more than their parents. They buy you things refers to the giant cookie I bought Ellie at intermission during Beauty and the Beastâ¦Taryn had a normal sized Coffee Crisp.\n\nSiobhan sent us the following after their last visit:\n\nAs we came through the front door Ellie said:\n\nWell that was certainly a busy and productive day.\n\nKevan, our youngest had been teaching at St. Andrews all boys private school in Aurora, about ninety minutes away. It describes itself, with some justification, as âthe best boyâs private school in Canada.â He is now at home âfor personal reasonsâ which might take some time to sort out. He did three years towards his PhD in Chemistry before deciding/realizing he wanted to teach and coach at high school not do research and some teaching at university.\n\nâ¦genetics?\n\nAfter living in Toronto for seven and a half years our third child (second son) is now back home with us. Dan is a writer and producer, film and television, and just needs a computer and telephone. He had an incredible apartment in Toronto and just two flatmates during his time there. The landlady loved him but when house prices were going crazy she sold her other property and moved back.\n\nHe has a great friend who is an interior decorator and girlfriend of Eugene Melnyk, the owner of the Ottawa Senators hockey team, and whenever she is away, quite often, he looks after the apartment and the cat..\n\nVery early in life Dan told us that he would never become a teacher because he saw how much work his mum and dad did. I still hold out hope as the three who are teachers never started out to join the profession.\n\nCorey, after getting his degree in Radio and Television Arts, from Ryerson was doing really well at TSN (The Sports Network is a Canadian English language sports specialty service) in Toronto before going back to get his B.Ed and teaching. He played (ice)hockey and box lacrosse and played lacrosse professionally with Buffalo, Toronto and Rochester. While playing for Buffalo against Toronto a player charged into him and went crashing backwards. Corey is 6ft 4ins and a goalkeeper. TSN was broadcasting the game and the play-by-play commentator remarked, âCorey is such a quiet young man at work.â\n\nSiobhan was at Queens University and was accepted at Law schools in Canada and the USA when she told Nora and I, âI donât want to go to Law School, I donât want to be a lawyer.â She scrambled and got a place at Windsor University in Primary and did a summer course to qualify to teach High School immediately after and has been teaching at All Saints ever since.\n\nWhen Siobhan and Trevor married they taught the next two years in Dubai. Nora and I visited them. Siobhan has been asked, by her last two principals, about becoming a principal. She has always said no, but this last time said \"not yet.â\n\nKevan was set to do grad studies when we visited a friend of his teaching at private school in Massachusetts. On the way home he said he wanted to teach. The first year he taught at Lake Forest Academy near Chicago. Then after Siobhan âberated\" him during the holidays he did two years towards his PhD in Chemistry at Virginia Tech. He came home for a semester breakâ¦nothing to do with academics and all to do with a young lady. While he was at home his mentor and head of Chemistry at Virginia Tech died very young, in her fifties. It affected him quite a bit. He did not go back. He went and got his BâEd at Brock, our local university in St. Catharines, and while he was there was invited to finish his PhD at Brock. After one more year at Brock he told Nora and I (what we already knew) that he wanted to teach and coach in secondary school not just lecture at University.\n\nHe taught for one year at Stanstead College in Quebec and was head-hunted by St. Andrewâs â¦and hopefully where he may return after everything is sorted out.\n\nWe are rounded off by our âCanadian family.â When Nora and I were living in Jamaica we met and became dear friends with Charles and Peggy Salmon who, at the time, had two young children . Charles is Jamaican and Peggy (OâHara) had been a Canadian graduate volunteer teaching in Montego Bay. Both families left Jamaica at the same time when the violence in Jamaica became random. Nora and I were living in Walkerton and the Salmons lived with us when they first arrived. Since Jamaica we have celebrated all high holidays together. That tradition was broken last Easter by the coronavirus epidemic.\n\nCharles and Peggy have four children, two married with children. A few years back one of our kids asked who would be with us for whatever holiday meal we were to be celebrating. When getting the answer âthe Salmonsâ, the comment was âJust family thenâ\n\nDebbie, the second oldest child recently said that she could not remember when we had not been in her life.\n\nThree other events that I believe enriched my life, my teaching and my effectiveness as a religious educator.\n\nIn the early 1990s Fr. Miguel DâEscoto Brockmann, Maryknoll priest, former foreign secretary of the Nicaraguan Sandinista government and President of the United Nations General Assembly spent a few days with our family in St. Catharines. The Hamilton Wentworth CDSB had refused to have him speak to religious educators so my wife hosted him in a workshop for Model U.N. participants, who attended in droves from all over Ontario.\n\nIn 2009 Ted Schmidt (Editor of Catholic New Times) and I hosted Bishop Geoffrey Robinson, retired auxiliary bishop of Sydney, Australia for the only Canadian stop in a North American tour. Geoff spoke of the priestly sexual-abuse crisis and the episcopal cover-upthat he had written about in Confronting Power and Sex in the Catholic Church.\n\nIn October 2010 Ted and I hosted Fr. Roy Bourgeois MM and Marie Evans Bouclin, a Roman Catholic WomanPriest in the auditorium of the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education.\n\nI mention these teachers and these events because of the impact of being in the presence of each and all of the persons mentioned above. I knew about each of them. I had, along with other teachers, been down to demonstrate with School of the Americas Watch at Fort Benning,Georgia. I had taught about (Saint)Oscar Romero in El Salvador, of the Sandinista Revolution in Nicaragua, and had used Maryknoll curriculum material for years. I had also worshipped with Eileen McCafferty DeFranco, a Roman Catholic WomanPriest and the St, Mary Magdalene Inclusive Eucharistic Community in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania.\n\nI am currently recovering from open-heart surgery - I had a quintuple bypass last October and have been told It will take a year - and looking forward to the coming of spring and watching Liverpool win the quadrupleâ¦one down three to go.\n\nI hope I havenât bored the socks of you"
