Description

The Long Ryders are one of the bands who have shaped the Paisley Underground scene and later considered Alt-Country.

Principally active between 1982 and 1987, they have periodically regrouped for brief reunions.

The Long Ryders bring up the sound of the Byrds first area. They were named after the Walter Hill film, the Long Riders where the "y" was a tribute to the Byrds.

The band featured Sid Griffin and Stephen McCarthy on vocals and guitar; Tom Stevens on bass (deceased in 2021); and Greg Sowders on drums.
