The Long Ryders are an American rock ‘n roll band formed in Los Angeles in 1981. They are often credited as founders of the alt-country movement and are the recent recipients of the Americana Music Association UK’s “International Trailblazer Award”.

​

The band’s three founding members Sid Griffin, Stephen McCarthy and Greg Sowders continue to tour the world and and on March 10th, 2023 release the long awaited follow up to their widely acclaimed #1 UK Americana album,Psychedelic Country Soul. The new album is called September November and is released by Cherry Red Records worldwide. Produced by Ed Stasium at his state-of-the-art studio in California the album stretches The Long Ryders envelope musically and contains two heartfelt musical tributes to their late bass player, the great Tom Stevens.

The band’s highly original roots rock recipe blends the punk rock spirit of the Ramones, the soul of Merle Haggard, the cosmic country of Gram Parsons and beautiful jangle of The Byrds into their own uniquely American musical experience. There is nothing quite like the Long Ryders live, not back then and certainly not now. Go see them for the musical ride of your life. Be part of rock ‘n’ roll history and write your own chapter at one of their shows. Get there early and hang on tight.
