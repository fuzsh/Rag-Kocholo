Flying Out Of London In The Rain\n\nCherry Red Records\n\n(CD CDBRED878, LP BREDD878)\n\nFirst album in four years from the band who helped invent Alt-country and Americana, the follow up the critically acclaimed ‘Psychedelic Country Soul’.\n\nThe album’s songs are all originals by guitarist/ mandolinist Sid Griffin (author of the Bob Dylan ‘Basement Tapes’ book Million Dollar Bash) and guitarist/pedal steel player Stephen McCarthy (who also plays with the Jayhawks and the Dream Syndicate) with help from longtime drummer Greg Sowders.\n\nProduced by Ed Stasium, best known for his long relationship as producer and engineer for the Ramones. Ed has also produced two previous Long Ryders’ records and worked with Smithereens, Soul Asylum, Motörhead, Marshall Crenshaw, Living Colour, the Hoodoo Gurus and Julian Cope.\n\nLong Ryder guitarist/mandolinist Sid Griffin states September November is “two thirds the distilled alt- country genre we helped found back in the 1980s, one third Paisley Underground adventurism yet seasoned with a dash of our own crazed soulfulness thrown in.”\n\nDue to the unexpected passing of bassist Tom Stevens, bass duties on the new album were shared by Murry Hammond of Americana stalwarts the Old 97s and the Long Ryders’ own Stephen McCarthy. Guests appearing in the album include D. J. Bonebrake of Los Angeles’s punk legends X and Royal Academy of Music violinist Kerenza Peacock of the Coal Porters (now a popular L.A. session player for Disney and the Los Angeles Philharmonic).\n\nThe Long Ryders – Psychedelic Country Soul\n\n1.

Walls\n\n11. Bells Of August\n\n12. Psychedelic Country Soul\n\nCherry Red Records/Omnivore Recordings\n\n(CD CDBRED734, CD (US) OV-326, LP BREDD734)\n\nThe Long Ryders, founders of alt-country in the 1980s, saddle up for the first time in thirty years with their biggest and best slice of Americana yet, the aptly named Psychedelic Country Soul. The album was produced by Ed Stasium (Ramones, Belinda Carlisle, The Smithereens) and features a eleven Ryder originals and a cover of their friend Tom Petty’s great song, “Walls.”\n\nRecorded in Los Angeles at Dr. Dre’s studio, Psychedelic Country Soul is, in Long Ryder Sid Griffin’s own words, “the album we were always trying to make… each flavor which made the band unique is there be it C&W, rock ’n’ roll, troubadour folk music, raw R&B, or out-there psychedelia.” The Long Ryders (Griffin, ex-Jayhawk Stephen McCarthy, song publisher Greg Sowders and NASA veteran Tom Stevens) are supplemented on the album by old friends The Bangles on harmony vocals and stellar sideman Dave Perlman (Everly Bros. Hoyt Axton) on pedal steel guitar.\n\nYet, ultimately the album is The Long Ryders. With Griffin’s familiar electric 12-string guitar, McCarthy’s virtuoso Clarence White licks, Tom Stevens earthy bass and Greg Sowders swingin’ drums, Psychedelic Country Soul is an album for 2019 made with the flavors of yesterday which has the sound and the spirit of tomorrow.

Six Days On The Road\n\n13. Southside Of The Story\n\n14. Still Get By\n\n15. Tell It To The Judge On Sunday\n\nCherry Red Records (CRCDBOX21)\n\nIt took over two year’s work but the Long Ryders finally have their own box set. 76 tracks of which 23 were previously unreleased, nine were only on CD in the USA beforehand, and with a hidden snippet of a track which will make you smile.\n\nThe first three CDs contain the band’s initial EP, their first three albums and most of these above-mentioned assorted goodies. The four CD is a smokin’, totally hot live show from March 1985 in Europe with 15 performances never heard since (unless you were one of the few who had a bootleg cassette of the show) which proves, more than anything ever will or could, the Long Ryders had one of the best, strongest, and most powerful live shows on the planet.\n\nThis box set sold out entirely within eighteen days (!) of its release and now you can see and hear why. Oh yes, Cherry Red manufactured some more, you bet, and it is still in print. So you can still hear why Mojo, Uncut, Record Collector, Rolling Stone and so many other magazines gave this collection column after column in their Reviews section. This is Americana defined and honoured in a mere four discs.\n\nThe Long Ryders – Native Sons (Deluxe Reissue)\n\nFinal Wild Son\n\nStill Get By\n\nIvory Tower\n\nRun Dusty Run\n\n(Sweet) Mental Revenge\n\nFair Game\n\nTell It To The Judge On Sunday\n\nWreck Of The 809\n\nToo Close To The Light\n\nNever Got To Meet Her\n\nI Had A Dream\n\nJoin My Gang\n\nYou Don’t Know What’s Right, You Don’t Know What’s Wrong\n\n10-5-60\n\nBorn To Believe In You\n\nThe Trip\n\nAnd She Rides\n\nTime Keeps Travelling\n\nI Can’t Hide\n\nMasters Of War\n\nStill Get By\n\n10-5-60\n\nAnd She Rides\n\nToo Close To The Light\n\nPrima SID024\n\nNative Sons is the album which Jeff Tweedy, Chris Robinson, Kurt Cobain and Gary Louris all bought and loved, influencing their own styles. It was a huge hit on the College Radio/Alternative Charts in the USA in 1984 and by spring 1985 it was number two on the New Musical Express Indie Chart, held off the top spot by the Smiths’ Meat Is Murder. Arguably the most influential and long-lasting release of Sid Griffin’s career Native Sons is now re-released with the entire 10-5-6- EP added as well as three tracks from the abandoned 5 By 5 sessions at A&M Studios, the Long Ryders’ first three demos and the B-side Close To The Light, a completely different mix to the LP version. This is the LP which kick-started Americana and put the “alt” into Alt-Country!\n\nThe Long Ryders – State Of Our Reunion Live 2004\n\nSo You Wanna Be A Rock & Roll Star?\n\nLights Of Downtown\n\nYou Don’t Know What’s Right, You Don’t Know What’s Wrong\n\nA Stitch In Time\n\nPrairie Fire\n\nWreck Of The 809\n\nGunslinger Man\n\nYears Long Ago\n\nI Can’t Hide\n\nIvory Tower\n\nCapturing The Flag\n\nBand Introduction (Glasgow)\n\nI Had A Dream\n\nFinal Wild Son\n\n(Sweet) Mental Revenge\n\nState Of Our Union\n\nLooking For Lewis & Clark\n\nLouisville\n\n10-5-60\n\nPrima SID021\n\nFor their first live gigs in seventeen years (!) the Long Ryders knew the pressure was on. But they kicked ass and took names and you can hear the results on this stellar recording from their London gig. Cut on a hot summer night the sold out venue turned punters away and the result was a classic live album which can be filed next to Get Your Ya-Ya’s Out, Live At The Apollo or Kick Out The Jams. Featuring the classic lineup of ex-Jayhawk Stephen McCarthy, Indiana state senator Tom Stevens, publishing mogul Greg Sowders and Dylan author Sid Griffin.\n\nThe Best of the Long Ryders\n\nLooking For Lewis & Clark (long version)\n\nLights Of Downtown\n\nYears Long Ago\n\nGunslinger Man\n\nI Want You Bad\n\nA Stitch In Time\n\nMan Of Misery\n\nIf I Were A Bramble And You Were A Rose\n\nCapturing The Flag (live)\n\nState Of My Union\n\nFinal Wild Son\n\nIvory Tower\n\n(Sweet) Mental Revenge\n\nI Had A Dream\n\nYou Don’t Know What’s Right, You Don’t Know What’s Wrong\n\nAnd She Rides\n\nMasters Of War\n\nI Can’t Hide\n\nPrima SID016\n\nThe first ever single CD Long Ryders compilation features tracks from across their entire career and from every label the band were on. Featuring liner notes from the rhythm section of Tom Stevens and Greg Sowders as well as Pete Frame’s very informative Long Ryders Family Tree this release includes over a dozen previously unseen photographs of the band in their heyday. This is the one Long Ryders CD to have if you only want one and an excellent introduction to the Founding Fathers of alt-country.

Every note has been expertly remastered by sonic expert Bill Inglot so the sound quality throughout is stunning. The booklet includes great sleevenotes by Rolling Stone’s David Fricke and a fine selection of photographs. Tracks marked * above are previously unreleased demos, whilst those marked ** are previously unreleased final recordings. All the unreleased tracks were mixed by Sid Griffin in Los Angeles in early 1998. The Light Gets In The Way is listed on the CD as being the album version but sounds like the demo version to everyone in the Prima Records Office. The long version of Looking For Lewis And Clark from the ten inch single release makes its first appearance on CD.

Recorded live at the Mayfair Club, Newcastle, 3.6.87, except for the last four tracks which were recorded for the Andy Kershaw show at the Chester Rendezvous Club, 15.10.85. An very well recorded live performance captured with typical great care by BBC engineers, an especially noteworthy achievement when you consider a rather ugly fight broke out in the mosh pit during the Chester performance which involved a good half dozen male Brits whopping the beejeezus out of each other for about fifteen minutes till order was restored.

(Bean counters run the record biz now, a pity.) Now out of print.\n\nA Conversation With The Long Ryders – State Of Our Union\n\nIsland LR1(LP)\n\nA promotional LP containing interviews with the Long Ryders in between the album tracks. Copies are occasionally seen in specialist record shops and on eBay going for ridiculous prices. Sid recently sold his entire record collection as it was in very expensive storage in L. A. so if you have a copy to spare let Sid buy it from you. Thanks.\n\nYou could send it to: Prima Records, P.O.

The Frontier and Zippo CD versions include the 10-5-60 mini album, but the latest Demon/Diabolo version (1996) does not.

The last four tracks are the most interesting as ex-Byrd Chris Hillman guests with the Long Ryders on stage at the Roxy in Hollywood\n\nThe End Of The Trail\n\nPrairie Fire\n\nLights Of Downtown\n\nMan Of Misery\n\nStitch In Time\n\nState Of My Union\n\nHarriet Tubman’s Gonna Carry Me Home\n\nCapturing The Flag\n\nLong Story Short\n\nBaby’s In Toyland\n\nI Want You Bad/Spectacular Fall\n\nI Had A Dream\n\nYou Just Can’t Ride The Boxcars Anymore\n\nGunslinger Man\n\nLooking For Lewis And Clark\n\nPrisoners Of Rock’N’Roll\n\n10-5-60\n\nMassive Attack Discs 990129 (CD)\n\nA great bootleg CD taken from an FM broadcast of the show at the Bottom Line in New York City on 7th May 1987. This is the very same release as the new official Long Ryders album Three Minute Warnings: The Long Ryders Live In New York City on Prima Records (SID015). However Three Minute Warnings has much, much better sound as it is from the original master tapes.\n\nInterestingly enough those original master tapes ran out with some ninety seconds left in the concert so the tail end of 10-5-60 on Three Minute Warnings is actually a digital edit from The End Of The Trail bootleg!\n\nSounds Of An Empty Pint Pitchfork (LP)\n\nFinal Wild Son\n\n(Sweet) Mental Revenge\n\nRun Dusty Run/Lights Of Downtown\n\nGood Times Tomorrow,Hard Times Today\n\nMasters Of War\n\nI Had A Dream\n\nIvory Tower\n\nWreck Of The 809\n\nState Of My Union\n\nYou Just Can’t Ride The Boxcars Anymore\n\nLooking For Lewis And Clark\n\nTell It To The Judge On Sunday\n\nSix Days On The Road\n\nA bootleg LP, recorded on the State OfOur Union UK tour at Newcastle University, 19.10.85.
