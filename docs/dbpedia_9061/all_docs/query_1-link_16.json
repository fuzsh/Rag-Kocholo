        "text": "As part of LA’s Paisley Underground, The Long Ryders were one of the first American groups to combine the cosmic country of The Byrds with the DIY punk ethos of the early 1980’s.\n\nThe band recorded their debut LP Native Sons with Henry Lewy who worked with The Flying Burrito Brothers on their legendary album Gilded Palace of Sin. Former Byrd Gene Clark joined them on their gorgeous tune “Ivory Tower” and Melody Maker Magazine called the record a “modern classic.”\n\nSigned to Island Records in 1985, the band released their 2nd album State of Our Union. Their revved-up country punk number “Looking for Lewis & Clark” became their signature song and was second only to the Smiths in the British radio charts in the mid 80’s. The band’s jangly pop won them attention of R.E.M. who stated, “As soon as we get through making the Replacements famous, you guys are next!”\n\nThe group toured extensively and continued to make a global impact with an invitation to open for U2 but disbanded in 1987 when members settled down to start families. Despite leaving the road, The Long Ryders created the template for the alt country sound and counts groups like The Byrds, Tom Petty, The Black Crowes, The Jayhawks, & Wilco as friends, admirers, and collaborators.\n\nVarious projects have kept them busy over the years. Singer/guitarist Sid Griffin moved to England, published numerous books on Bob Dylan and Graham Parsons & played with the bluegrass band The Coal Porters. Lead guitarist Stephen McCarthy worked on solo projects, collaborated with old friend and early bandmate Steve Wynn, & began playing with The Jayhawks in 2003. Bassist Tom Stephens earned a degree in computer science and released solo albums while drummer Greg Sowders, who was married for a time to Lucinda Williams, has made a career in music publishing.\n\nIn between there were side projects, reunion tours and shows including playing Glastonbury in 2004. It’s been 33 and ⅓ years since their last release, and while that’s a long gap, those numbers coincide perfectly with the revolutions per minute on their latest vinyl double album Psychedelic Country Soul, which was recorded at Dr.Dre’s studio in Los Angeles and features old friends the Bangles on harmony vocals and Dave Perlman on pedal steel guitar.\n\n“Greenville” is the perfect track to kick of the album with twangy riffs reminiscent of Exile era Stones crossed with the 12-string jangle of the Byrds and an infectious chorus that brings to mind REM’s “Don’t Go Back to Rockville.” Stephen McCarthy penned lyrics with political overtones: “How’s your revolution, and your war machine?” which cleverly rest within a country pop framework.\n\nAnother McCarthy tune, “Let If Fly” boasts tasteful B-bender guitar licks that evoke the classic sounds of the Flying Burrito Brothers with lovely fiddle and gorgeous harmonies courtesy of the Bangles.\n\n“All Aboard” has melancholy melodies with slashing guitars that show how Uncle Tupelo were influenced by the Long Ryders, and perhaps vice-versa.\n\n“Make It Real” features great harmonica playing with lush harmonies that show McCarthy picked up a thing or two from his work with the Jayhawks. “I’m getting high as a satellite.”\n\nSid’s “What The Eagle Sees” harkens back to the band’s garage rock roots with psychedelic imagery above the clouds “See, see, what the eagle sees…”\n\nOn “California State Line” McCarthy’s voice brings to mind Jay Farrar with gorgeous pedal steel guitar thanks to old friend Dave Perlman.\n\nThe band does a lovely version of Tom Petty’s “Walls”, an endearing tribute to their recently departed friend. The album closes with “Psychedelic Country Soul.” Throbbing tremolo and 12 string acoustic guitar lure the listener into a dreamlike state.\n\nThis excellent album is available as a digital download, CD, and as a double vinyl package (recorded at 45 rpms for higher fidelity.) To purchase their music and find out more about this legendary band, see their website: www.thelongryders.com\n\nThe Long Ryders are on tour worldwide. Catch them if you can!"
