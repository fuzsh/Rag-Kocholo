        "text": "As I've lamented several times on this board, it sometimes seem that the hardest music to track down on CD is music that just preceded the market switchover from vinyl to compact disc.\n\nAfter falling in love with R.E.M.'s MURMUR as a college student, I started looking for \"more stuff like that.\" In those pre-Internet days, and far removed from university radio at my small liberal arts college, I relied on the early SPIN magazine to review and profile those indie label bands. A couple times a year I'd take my list to D.C.'s Tower Records, and buy a bunch of stuff unheard. Some of it was great, some eh, and some crap.\n\nBut I what I really liked were the guitar-based bands that were described as either the Paisley Underground or Amer-Indie [sic?], with their ringing guitars, country-rock influence (by way of Gram Parsons or Neil Young rather than the slicker Eagles) and a no-******** approach that sounded \"real\" compared to the disco and increasingly bombastic classic rock I grew up with.\n\nWhen it came time to replace my vinyl, sold off in one haul when I sensed the secondhand music stores would stop taking it soon, I assumed I'd be able to replace those records shortly. Instead, it's taken a good fifteen years to track down some college favorites. Just this week I finally got hold of True West's two-fer, TWO TRUE, which contains HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAYS and DRIFTERS, courtesy of eBay. Sounds great by the way.\n\nAnyway, since my memory of the Paisley Underground or Amer-Indie movement is so faded, and my copies of SPIN long composted, can anyone remember a few more bands \"sorta like R.E.M.\" from this era? Some are still around, of course, but a few must have escaped my memory.\n\nBlasters\n\nDream Syndicate\n\nGreen On Red\n\nLone Justice\n\nLong Ryders\n\nLos Lobos\n\nSilos\n\nTrue West\n\nWire Train\n\nZeitgeist/Reivers\n\nThe Live album and Best of are \"must haves\" for fans of the band.\n\nOther great bands of that era:\n\nRave Ups\n\nGuadalcanal Diary\n\nJason and the Scorchers\n\nBeat Farmers\n\nCowboy Mouth\n\nDash Rip Rock\n\nSidewinders/Sand Rubies - Great cover of Solitary man\n\nBrandos\n\nScruffy The Cat\n\nI know what you mean. But there's plenty of used vinyl out there. I picked up 'Stone Age Romeos' by the Hoodoo Gurus for $.99 a few weeks ago.\n\nI almost started a thread on \"Ordinary CDs that command ridiculous prices on eBay,\" with the dBs's LIKE THIS as a prime example. What is Rhino Handmade waiting for?\n\nI got the True West CD cheap, and half what I was willing to pay.\n\n............I caught the Rainmakers when they played a concert at Kansas State University. Great group! The real crowdpleaser song they did seemed to be \"Drinking On The Job\". As for one of my favorite early 80s guitar oriented band-I love the music of TRANSLATOR. I have clean copies of all their vinyl releases and it's a tossup as to their very best-their incredible debut HEARTBEATS AND TRIGGERs(with the college radio hit \"Everywhere There I'm Not\" or their final Lp, EVENING OF THE HARVEST which always struck me as a wonderful hybrid of Byrds/Neil Young influences garnished with the rustic jangle rock sound.Also on an Ep I have of theirs, Translator does a superb cover of the Beatles \"Cry For A Shadow\".\n\nTranslator - Great choice\n\nI have all of their music too, have seen them live and can testify that they were a great band in their day. They have also recorded excellent cover versions of Jefferson Airplane's \"Today\" and \"Dizzy Miss Lizzy\".\n\nEd Hurdle\n\nHeavyDistortion"
