        "text": "September November\n\nCD CDBRED878, LP BRED878\n\nNew studio album by The Long Ryders, the follow up the critically acclaimed âPsychedelic Country Soulâ. The albumâs songs are all originals by guitarist/ mandolinist Sid Griffin (author of the Bob Dylan âBasement Tapesâ book Million Dollar Bash) and guitarist/pedal steel player Stephen McCarthy (who also plays with the Jayhawks and the Dream Syndicate) with help from longtime drummer Greg Sowders.\n\nProduced by Ed Stasium, best known for his long relationship as producer and engineer for the Ramones. Ed has also produced two previous Long Rydersâ records and worked with Smithereens, Soul Asylum, MotÃ¶rhead, Marshall Crenshaw, Living Colour, the Hoodoo Gurus and Julian Cope.\n\nLong Ryder guitarist/mandolinist Sid Griffin states September November is âtwo thirds the distilled alt- country genre we helped found back in the 1980s, one third Paisley Underground adventurism yet seasoned with a dash of our own crazed soulfulness thrown in.â\n\nBuy\n\nPsychedelic Country Soul\n\nCD CDBRED734, CD (US) OV-326, LP BREDD734\n\nThe Long Ryders, founders of alt-country in the 1980s, saddle up for the first time in thirty years with their biggest and best slice of Americana yet, the aptly named Psychedelic Country Soul. The album was produced by Ed Stasium (Ramones, Belinda Carlisle, The Smithereens) and features a eleven Ryder originals and a cover of their friend Tom Pettyâs great song, âWalls.â\n\nRecorded in Los Angeles at Dr. Dreâs studio, Psychedelic Country Soul is, in Long Ryder Sid Griffinâs own words, âthe album we were always trying to makeâ¦ each flavor which made the band unique is there be it C&W, rock ânâ roll, troubadour folk music, raw R&B, or out-there psychedelia.â The Long Ryders (Griffin, ex-Jayhawk Stephen McCarthy, song publisher Greg Sowders and NASA veteran Tom Stevens) are supplemented on the album by old friends The Bangles on harmony vocals and stellar sideman Dave Perlman (Everly Bros. Hoyt Axton) on pedal steel guitar.\n\nYet, ultimately the album is The Long Ryders. With Griffinâs familiar electric 12-string guitar, McCarthyâs virtuoso Clarence White licks, Tom Stevens earthy bass and Greg Sowders swinginâ drums, Psychedelic Country Soul is an album for 2019 made with the flavors of yesterday which has the sound and the spirit of tomorrow. Get ready for the ryde of your life.\n\nMore...\n\nFinal wild Songs\n\nCRCDBOX21\n\nThe Long Ryders were formed by several American musicians influenced by Gram Parsons and the Byrds, with country and punk rock influences. The band featured Sid Griffin on guitar, autoharp, and harmonica, Stephen McCarthy, guitar, steel guitar, mandolin, and banjo, Des Brewer, bassist, (later replaced by Tom Stevens) and Greg Sowders, playing drums and percussion.\n\nWith a sound reminiscent of The Clash meeting Buffalo Springfield, but with a harder edge, they anticipated the alternative country music of the 1990s by a decade. This 4-CD career overview has been compiled with both Sid Griffin and Tom Stevens from original tapes (where they exist) â the entire band has contributed a track by track breakdown for the set.\n\nRe-mastered by Andy Pearce.\n\nMore...\n\nNative Sons (Deluxe Reissue)\n\nPrima SID024\n\nNative Sons is the album which Jeff Tweedy, Chris Robinson, Kurt Cobain and Gary Louris all bought and loved, influencing their own styles. It was a huge hit on the College Radio/Alternative Charts in the USA in 1984 and by spring 1985 it was number two on the New Musical Express Indie Chart, held off the top spot by the Smithsâ Meat Is Murder. Native Sons is now re-released with the entire 10-5-6- EP added as well as three tracks from the abandoned 5 By 5 sessions at A&M Studios, the Long Rydersâ first three demos and the B-side Close To The Light, a completely different mix to the LP version. This is the LP which kick-started Americana and put the âaltâ into Alt-Country!\n\nFinal Wild Son/ Still Get By/ Ivory Tower/ Run Dusty Run/ (Sweet) Mental Revenge/ Fair Game/ Tell It To The Judge On Sunday/ Wreck Of The 809/ Too Close To The Light/ Never Got To Meet Her/ I Had A Dream/ Join My Gang (first of sixfrom tracks 10-5-60 EP)/ You Donât Know Whatâs Right, You Donât Know Whatâs Wrong/ 10-5-60/ Born To Believe In You/ The Trip/ And She Rides/ Time Keeps Travelling (first of three tracks from abandoned â5 by 5â sessions)/ I Canât Hide/ Masters Of War/ Still Get By( first of three tracks Radio Tokyo sessions, 1983)/ 10-5-60/ And She Rides/ Too Close To The Light (b-side mix, UK only)\n\nBuy\n\nState Of Our Reunion Live 2004\n\nPrima SID021\n\nFor their first live gigs in seventeen years (!) the Long Ryders knew the pressure was on. But they kicked ass and took names and you can hear the results on this stellar recording from their London gig. Cut on a hot summer night the sold out venue turned punters away and the result was a classic live album which can be filed next to Get Your Ya-Yaâs Out, Live At The Apollo or Kick Out The Jams. Featuring the classic lineup of ex-Jayhawk Stephen McCarthy, Indiana state senator Tom Stevens, publishing mogul Greg Sowders and Dylan author Sid Griffin.\n\nSo You Wanna Be A Rock & Roll Star?/Lights Of Downtown/You Donât Know Whatâs Right, You Donât Know Whatâs Wrong/A Stitch In Time/Prairie Fire/Wreck Of The 809/Gunslinger Man/Years Long Ago/I Canât Hide/Ivory Tower/Capturing The Flag/Band Introduction (Glasgow)/I Had A Dream/Final Wild Son/(Sweet) Mental Revenge/State Of Our Union/Looking For Lewis & Clark/Louisville/10-5-60\n\nBandcamp\n\nBuy\n\nThe Best of the Long Ryders\n\nPrima SID016\n\nThe first ever single CD Long Ryders compilation features tracks from across their entire career and from every label the band were on. Featuring liner notes from the rhythm section of Tom Stevens and Greg Sowders as well as Pete Frameâs very informative Long Ryders Family Tree this release includes over a dozen previously unseen photographs of the band in their heyday. This is the one Long Ryders CD to have if you only want one and an excellent introduction to the Founding Fathers of alt-country. Officially Prima Records bestselling CD as of May 1, 2008.\n\nLooking For Lewis & Clark (long version) / Lights Of Downtown / Years Long Ago / Gunslinger Man / I Want You Bad / A Stitch In Time / Man Of Misery / If I Were A Bramble And You Were A Rose / Capturing The Flag (live) / State Of My Union / Final Wild Son / Ivory Tower / (Sweet) Mental Revenge / I Had A Dream / You Donât Know Whatâs Right, You Donât Know Whatâs Wrong / And She Rides / Masters Of War / I Canât Hide\n\nbuy\n\nThree Minute Warnings\n\nPrima SID015(CD)\n\nA great recording of the Long Ryders show at the Bottom Line in New York City on 7th May 1987 which was broadcast live on FM radio. A showcase for a rocking fine band, Sidâs hair looks perfect on the front cover and the CD booklet has notes by the bandâs long time manager John Guarnieri. The CD features previously unseen photographs of the band in action. This is rock and roll which emphasises the ârollâ part as much as the rock! The album is hotter than a pepperoni and jalapeno sandwich with horse radish.\n\nPrairie Fire/Lights Of Downtown/Man Of Misery/A Stitch In Time/State Of My Union/Harriet Tubmanâs Going To Carry Me Home/Capturing The Flag/Long Story Short/Babyâs In Toyland/I Want You Bad/Spectacular Fall/I Had A Dream/You Just Canât Ride The Boxcars Anymore/Gunslinger Man/Looking For Lewis & Clark/Prisoners Of Rock/10-5-60\n\nBandcamp\n\nBuy\n\nThe Long Ryders Anthology\n\nPolygram Records 314 558 280(USA)(2xCD)\n\nReleased in July 1998, this 40 track compilation covers every period of The Long Rydersâ influential existence. Every note has been expertly remastered by sonic expert Bill Inglot so the sound quality throughout is stunning. All the unreleased tracks were mixed by Sid Griffin in Los Angeles in early 1998. The Light Gets In The Way is listed on the CD as being the album version but sounds like the demo version to everyone in the Prima Records Office. The long version of Looking For Lewis And Clark from the ten inch single release makes its first appearance on CD. Unfortunately this wonderful compilation has only been released in the USA and is now out of print.\n\nDisc One: 10-5-60 / And She Rides / Born To Believe In You / You Donât Know Whatâs Right, You Donât Know Whatâs Wrong / Join My Gang / Final Wild Son / Ivory Tower / Still Get By / Run Dusty Run/(Sweet) Mental Revenge / Fair Game / Too Close To The Light / I Had A Dream / Iâll Get Out Somehow / Masters Of War/I Canât Hide / Lights Of Downtown/Mason-Dixon Line / Capturing The Flag/Years Long Ago Disc Two: Looking For Lewis And Clark (long version)/ State Of My Union/Two Kinds Of Love/If I Were A Bramble And You Were A Rose / Christmas In New Zealand / Basic Black / Pushinâ Uphill / He Can Hear His Brother Calling / 17 Ways /Heâs Got Himself A Young Girl (And He Canât Keep Up)/ Gunslinger Man / I Want You Bad / A Stitch In Time / Babyâs In Toyland/Harriet Tubmanâs Gonna Carry Me Home / The Light Gets In The Way / Spectacular Fall/Flak Jacket / Ring Bells / Prisoners Of RockâNâRoll (live)\n\nBBC Radio One Live In Concert\n\nWindsong WINCD 058 (CD)\n\nA 1994 release of recordings made and broadcast by the BBC. Recorded live at the Mayfair Club, Newcastle, 3.6.87, except for the last four tracks which were recorded for the Andy Kershaw show at the Chester Rendezvous Club, 15.10.85. A very well recorded live performance captured with typical great care by BBC engineers, an especially noteworthy achievement when you consider a rather ugly fight broke out in the mosh pit during the Chester performance which involved a good half dozen male Brits whopping the beejeezus out of each other for about fifteen minutes till order was restored.
