        "text": "I have recently interviewed Sid Griffin for the Now Spinning Magazine Podcast but felt this wonderfully joyous album needed a review on its own and here it is. Phil\n\nSeptember November is the band’s first album in four years it is the follow up to the the critically acclaimed ‘Psychedelic Country Soul’.\n\nThe album’s songs are all originals by guitarist/mandolinist Sid Griffin (author of the Bob Dylan “Basement Tapes” book Million Dollar Bash), guitarist /pedal step player Stephen McCarthy (who also plays with the Jayhawks and the Dream Syndicate) with help from longtime Long Ryders drummer Greg Sowders.\n\nProduced by Ed Stasium, best known for his long relationship as producer and engineer for the Ramones. Ed has also produced two previous Long Ryders’ records and worked with Smithereens, Soul Asylum, Motörhead, Marshall Crenshaw, Living Colour, the Hoodoo Gurus and Julian Cope.\n\nOrder from Cherry Red Records\n\nOrder from Amazon"
