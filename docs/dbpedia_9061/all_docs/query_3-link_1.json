        "text": "September November\n\nReleased March 10, 2023.\n\nFirst album in four years from the band who helped invent Alt-country and Americana.\n\nNew studio album by The Long Ryders, the follow up the critically acclaimed âPsychedelic Country Soulâ.\n\nThe albumâs songs are all originals by guitarist/ mandolinist Sid Griffin (author of the Bob Dylan âBasement Tapesâ book Million Dollar Bash) and guitarist/pedal steel player Stephen McCarthy (who also plays with the Jayhawks and the Dream Syndicate) with help from longtime drummer Greg Sowders.\n\nProduced by Ed Stasium, best known for his long relationship as producer and engineer for the Ramones. Ed has also produced two previous Long Rydersâ records and worked with Smithereens, Soul Asylum, MotÃ¶rhead, Marshall Crenshaw, Living Colour, the Hoodoo Gurus and Julian Cope.\n\nOrder the album today!\n\nLong Ryder guitarist/mandolinist Sid Griffin states September November is âtwo thirds the distilled alt- country genre we helped found back in the 1980s, one third Paisley Underground adventurism yet seasoned with a dash of our own crazed soulfulness thrown in.â\n\nDue to the unexpected passing of bassist Tom Stevens, bass duties on the new album were shared by Murry Hammond of Americana stalwarts the Old 97s and the Long Rydersâ own Stephen McCarthy. Guests appearing in the album include D. J. Bonebrake of Los Angelesâs punk legends X and Royal Academy of Music violinist Kerenza Peacock of the Coal Porters (now a popular L.A. session player for Disney and the Los Angeles Philharmonic).\n\nState Of Our Union & Two Fisted Tales 3CD Boxsets\n\nNovember 2018 will see two very, very special releases from The Long Ryders. Both State Of Our Union and Two-Fisted Tales reappear on the marketplace after years out-of-print.\n\nNot only are these two classic albums coming back into print but each album is now a three CD set (!) with the first disc being the original album with B-sides, the second being outtakes and demos, and the third CD being a live show recorded in support of each album. State Of Our Union features a legendary live show from Londonâs Mean Fiddler whilst Two Fisted Tales has a memorable live show from the Oasis Water Park, Palm Springs.\n\nSo, yes, if you buy both releasesâ¦ and we hope you doâ¦ the discerning Long Ryders fan will have six discs of Long Ryders music, much of it unreleased. Both sets are released on November 30th, 2018 on Cherry Red Records.\n\nState Of Our Union, 3CD Boxset\n\nOrder Now\n\nThis 3-CD version overseen by Tom Stevens contains the re-mastered album, a set of demos from the bandâs archive, and a legendary show from Londonâs Mean Fiddler.\n\nAlso available via Amazon UK / Amazon US\n\nTwo Fisted Tales, 3CD Boxset\n\nOrder Now\n\nThis 3-CD version overseen by Tom Stevens contains the re-mastered album, a disc of demos from the bandâs archives and a memorable live show from Palm Springs.\n\nAlso available via Amazon UK / Amazon US\n\n\"They unwittingly invented Americana, but seldom receive credit for it... State Of Our Union was a foundation stone for what became known as No Depression, alt country and, eventually, Americana.\" Mojo\n\n\"The whole thing is a rush of ringing guitars and fire engine melodies that is retro and futuristic and timeless.\" Uncut\n\n\"Everything is fresh enough to have been recorded yesterday and puts most of todays bands to shame.\" Americana-UK"
