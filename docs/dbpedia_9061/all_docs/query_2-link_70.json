        "text": "The Long Riders is a 1980 Western film that dramatizes the exploits of the James-Younger Gang. Directed by Walter Hill, the film is notable for the casting of 4 families of actors including the Carradines (David Carradine, Keith Carradine, and Robert Carradine), the Quaids (Randy Quaid and Dennis Quaid), the Keaches (James Keach and Stacy Keach), and the Guests (Nicholas Guest and Christopher Guest). Also of interest is the amount of period weapons seen in the film besides the typical Colt Single Action Army.\n\nThe following weapons were used in the film The Long Riders:\n\nHandguns\n\nMerwin and Hulbert revolver\n\nClell Miller (Randy Quaid) carries a Merwin and Hulbert revolver as his main handgun. This revolver was not available to the public until 1876, the same year that Clell Miller helped robb the bank in Minnesota as depicted in the movie.\n\nRemington 1875\n\nCole Younger (David Carradine) is seen with a Remington 1875.\n\nSharps Model 1C Pepperbox\n\nFour-barreled Sharps Model 1C Pepperbox is also seen in the film held by Bella Starr (Pamela Reed).\n\nSmith and Wesson Schofield\n\nFrank James (Stacy Keach) is seen with a Smith & Wesson Schofield.\n\nHarrington & Richardson Premier\n\nA top-break, .38 Harrington & Richardson Premier revolver is the weapon of Vernon Biggs (Chris Mulkey). Frank is seen with one as well.\n\nColt Walker\n\nJim Younger (Keith Carradine) is seen with what appears to be a .44 caliber Colt Walker revolver when they rob the coach. Despite the presence of a loading lever latch, this is a Walker and not a Dragoon or '51 Navy. (See Discussion page for detailed argument.)\n\nMovie prop Colt Police Positive\n\nA Colt revolver is seen held by Ed Miller (Dennis Quaid) during the bank robbery. It is also seen used by Bob Younger (Robert Carradine). This double-action, modern revolver (it looks like a Colt 1917) has been modified to look like a Colt Single Action Army, installing a fake extractor rod housing on the right side of the barrel. This kind of props were frequently used in the 50's Western movies (see the Police Positive below), when an actor wasn't able to use a Single Action Army with the speed required by the script. It is somewhat surprising to find one in this movie, which uses such a variety of antique handguns. Another possibility is that it was a representation of a Colt 1878 Double Action Revolver.\n\nSingle Action Army\n\nVarious models of the Colt Single Action Army are used by several characters in the film.\n\nRifles\n\nWinchester Model 1873\n\nThe Winchester Model 1873 is used by several of the outlaws in the film.\n\nWinchester 1866 \"Yellow Boy\" Rifle\n\nA Winchester 1866 \"Yellow Boy\" Rifle is also a prominent rifle used in the film, notably by Bob Younger (Robert Carradine).\n\nWinchester 1892?\n\nThe Winchester Model 1892 also is used.\n\nFrank James uses a stainless steel Winchester 1892 that has been modified to look like a Henry Rifle.\n\nShotguns\n\n12 Gauge Harrington & Richardson Topper Single Shot Shotgun\n\nBoth Cole Younger (David Carradine) and John Younger (Kevin Brophy) carry 12 Gauge Single Shot Shotguns .\n\nColt 1878 Double Barreled Shotgun (Sawed Off)\n\nA Colt 1878 double barreled shotgun with the barrel sawed down to short length is carried by guard riding shotgun on the wagon.\n\n12 Gauge Double Barreled Shotgun"
