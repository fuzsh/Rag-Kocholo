        "text": "1.\n\nPrarie Fire 02:54\n\nThere's a prairie fire burning in my mind baby tonight With the coals stoked glowing hot 'til they get bright white So come on you gotta tag along 'til they set things right We're gonna march to Montgomery in the pale moonlight There's a prairie fir burning in my mind baby tonight With some people down on their backs thinking this ain't right So we'll see if the dawn can set us a little more on sight Everybody's riding for free as it's everyone's fight We're gonna go to the ghetto, hit the bordello Everybody come outside We're one big nation, like a UN training station Everybody's showing their pride There's a prairie fire burning in my eyes baby tonight You gotta three minute warning to join or get outta sight To stand aside is to take their side alright So c'mon we're gonna take 'em on as they ain't that bright\n\n2.\n\nLights Of Downtown 02:55\n\nWritten by Stephen McCarthy Packed my bags, packed it in Never coming back her again Paid my dues and stayed in line 16 years of serving my time Now what I did I do regret All the days that I had wept Up all night and you can bet I've got a live with that See the lights of downtown It's where I shot that ol' man down Now he's calling me Calls my insanity Now when I walk and people say How can he just away Had a gun, no daughter, no son One life is gone and one begun Now what I did I do regret All the days that I had wept Up all night and you can bet I've got a live with that See the lights of downtown It's where I shot that ol' man down Now he's calling me Calls my insanity I can't run away, I can't hide Its a slow death, for me inside See the lights of downtown It's where I shot that ol' man down Now he's calling me Calls my insanity See the lights of downtown It's where I shot that ol' man down Now he's calling me Calls my insanity See the lights of downtown It's where I shot that ol' man down Now he's calling me Calls my insanity See the lights of downtown It's where I shot that ol' man down Now he's calling me Calls my insanity\n\n3.\n\nMan Of Misery 03:33\n\nHe walks but he walks real slow And he don't have too much to say If you see him hnaging around Get his back on the ground Didn't tell him about the noise Didn't really have a choice If you see him on the street Help him out now can't you see When push comes top shove With that sound from up above What's left to see That man of misery Now he left got on that plane Came back but not the same If it seems he's not all there Help him out now don't you care\n\n4.\n\nA Stitch In Time 04:01\n\nThread the needle with one eye closed Steady hand like a jeweller do you suppose Save my world with just one poke But don't try to fix it if it ain't broke But a stitch in time is fine if you know what you're doin' Got bombs that whistle You got bombs that sing But they got 'em too Don't mean a goddamn thing Do you believe, the winner in time Will be the one with the most toys at the finish line A stitch in time is fine if you know what you're doin' But I don't understand what you're doin' With that blood on your hands I don't know It's not a case of black or white It's not a case or wrong or right it seems Just one thing that I know is true You're just as damned if you're doin' it too It seems Don't wanna argue Don't wanna place no blame Each generation thought they'd be different Just to end up the same 'Cause that money screams while ideals die But you can't pull the wool over this boy's eyes Yeah a stitch in time is fine if you nkow what you're doin' But I don't understanda what you're doin' With that blood on your hands I don't know I don't know\n\n5.\n\nState Of My Union 05:25\n\nWalk a little with me, won't you carry a bit of my song I wanna tell a little story 'bout the place where I was born If I start slowin' down 'n' throw in too many \"you all's\" Won'tcha bear with me buddy as I think I'm feeling the call Let me first off say that I don't know just what you heard But I read a little 'bout it and I don't believe a word So let's stroll to the kitchen where we'll start this meal from scratch I smell something cookin' and I want right in that first batch Corn bread, stock cars minor league baseball too Woods full of grizzlies where the alligators chomp on you Alabama football, man, you gotta try it Did I tell you my old man looks a little bit like Bear Bryant We got candied yams, sunsets in the fall We got a minstrel preacher showman He's a preachin' up a ball We got state fairs, go-karts, crashing round in bumper cars We got drunks getting drunker while the sober get thrown out of the bar Front porch swing where you know you know who you are Hey Dad I can explain 'bout the stains in the back of the car We gave you blues and jazz and country and western too We oughta ask for 'em back after what you put 'em through We got lotsa rivers, lotsa fields and streams Maybe it ain't exactly heaven but it's certainly part of my dreams So you just walk a little with me, won't you carry a bit of my song I wanna tell you a story 'bout the place where I was born If I start slowin' down 'n' throw in too many \"you all's\" Won't you bear with me honey as I think I'm feeling the call\n\n6.\n\nWell I left my man on the other side Harriet Tubman's gonna carry me home On the underground railroad I will ride Harriet Tubman's gonna carry me home At night I ride on that Northern Star Harriet Tubman's gonna carry me home If I gotta go to heaven then I'll go that far Harriet Tubman's gonna carry me home They say that old Dred Scott Will put his hooks on me But they ain'y made the shackles That'll keep me from wrestlin' free Well I left my family on the other side Harriet Tubman's gonna carry me home They ain't got their freedom but they got their pride Harriet Tubman's gonna carry me home And there's more of them as there's more of me Ain't nothing ever gonna stop us wwrestlin' free If Joshua need a soldier let him come to me As my life is but a shackle to this block of stone When Jericho is falling let them call on me Though I never had a past I got a will to be They say that Frederick Douglass Is an exception to their rules Well I just read my Bible And if they're right they're fools Well I left my man on the other side On the underground railroad I will ride At night I ride on a Northern Star If I gotta go to heaven then I'll go that far If I gotta go to heaven then I'll go that far If I gotta go to heaven then I'll go that far Harriet Tubman's gonna carry me home Harriet Tubman's gonna carry me home Harriet Tubman's gonna carry me home\n\n7.\n\nCapturing The Flag 04:05\n\nShe sings alone and brings the kinda light to wash your sorrow She waits for many things, including lies What can she do, what can she do She wants to mess so bad She wants to be held and be had She goes to church alone For love on Sunday What will she do, what will she do Roads they cross is wide Comrades in arms St Christopher guides them capturing the flag A-walking in in-line Those they left behind St Tristan for those capturing the flag Now many times she passes Plans so filled with pale tomorrows Soldiers bring back lies, instead of lives What can you do, what can you do Roads they cross is wide Comrades in arms St Christopher guides them capturing the flag A-walking in in-line Those they left behind St Tristan for those capturing the flag She once had a boy She once had a husband too She once had a son She once had a husband too They take them from the ground, shine them a light Pass them in review, tell them that was life What could they do, what could they do Roads they cross is wide Comrades to arms St Christopher guides them capturing the flag A-walking in in-line Those they left behind St Tristan for those capturing the flag\n\n8.\n\nLong Story Short 04:34\n\nPorch breezes in the afternoon Summer when it's gone too soon Rain cooling off the heat Driving to the county seat Tall tales draggin' behind you Sittin' 'neath the sheltering sky The empties, you and I Underneath a marquee moon Lazy nights in your room Tall tales draggin' behind you Making a long story short Making a long story short Making a long story short Tall tales draggin' behind you Colours in the autumn sun School days when they've jsut begun Slippin' down the river's side Splashing in the nick of time Tall tales draggin' behind you Making a long story short Don't talk about it They'll haul you in court Don't talk about it Make a long story short Making a long story short Making a long story short Making a long story short Don't talk about it Don't file no report Don't talk about it Make a long story short\n\n9.\n\nBaby's In Toyland 04:30\n\nBaby's gone down to toyland Shoppin' for a brand new gun Baby's gone down to toyland 'Cause that's how her whole life's been run It's run off the backs of those who have no say Run down in front of people in the way Baby's gone down to toyland The heat makes her whole world go 'round Baby's gone down to toyland The carousel stoppped in her town Never do the right guys call her When they call her at all Quiet, there's the phone line The static says it all And all the crimees against her Change her colours like the fall And bad times which never left Are starting to wind down Baby's gone down to toyland Stoppin' by a brand new gun My baby's gone down to toyland The metal makes her think that she's won No clouds burst into her daytime She's got her own thunder now The scenes seen on her street Can feel her sadness wow Wind down Wind you right down Wind you right away Baby's gonna take her own life into her hands Baby's gonna taker her own life into her hands Baby walks down Canal Street Reachin' for her steely blue friend Baby pulls out her mean street An out of state means to an end No more will a boy who's fadin' Make her feel like toys to men\n\n10.\n\nI Want You Bad 02:42\n\nLately, it's been drivin' me mad Cause you're the best thing that I've ever had And I want you...want you bad C'mon, let's give it a whirl So we can shake up This whole wide world And I want you...want you bad I'm all run out of things to do But I've got no other plans but you Never, never be sad I want to make you feel so glad And I want you...want you bad Thinking I'm going to lose my head You know the phone line is taking too much bread And I want you...want you bad\n\n11.\n\nSpectacular Fall 04:17\n\nDidya hear the one about the lawyer and the doctor? They were planning to make a house call All alone they were plotting out against me Nearly had my back to the wall Time and time were working out against me I really had a close call 'Til you threw love and hoppe in my direction Nearly had a spectacular fall Spectacular fall If a rich man's wealthy 'cause he counts his heroes And numbers them all his friends Is a poor man docked a notch for the time He didnt' get the numbers to spend? I've seen the world from the floor of my bedroom With the covers pulled over my head Many's the time I'd have made you mine If only at the time I'd said Time and time were working out against me I really had a close call 'Til you threw love and hope in my direction Nearly had a spectacular fall If a carpenter came to build glass houses Would you hand out stones? Knowing full well there ain't a chance in hell Of me ascending any thrones I've seen the world staring back in my mirror The daylights scared out of me You threw love anda rope in my direction Nearly had a spectacular fall Spectacular fall! Spectacular fall! Spectacular! Spectacular fall! Spectacular fall!\n\n12.\n\nI Had A Dream 03:57\n\nTried so hard to explain The way things are and how quick they can change But you never listened you just turned your head Never even heard a single word that he said While it's true now that I'm not a saint I felt pain when you live to hate Said it before and I'll say it again Leave me alone man or treat me like a friend I had a dream last night Everybody's laughing and everything was alright Still some hope in sight, that was last night I had a dream last night Nobody's crying, nobody's frightened Still some hope in sight, that was last night Well if it seems like I sound like the rest We're trying hard not to be too depressed Once they take everything I've left, it's so easy So if you're dreaming I hhope that you do Wish for the best and hope that it comes true Who knows what they'll leave when they're through I had a dream last night Everybody's laughing and everything was alright Still some hope in sight, that was last night I had a dream last night Nobody's crying, nobody's frightened Still some hope in sight, that was last night\n\n13.\n\nI was in Atlanta when the news came on TV I was washing dishes just to get my meals for free Remember grandpa talking and this he said to me As long as I live it'll never happen again When the poets hopped a ride out west Grandpa got us by just sweeping floors Now everybody's leaving town Sell the house and sell the farm But you just can't ride the boxcars anymore Now everybody's feeling all confused They went to get their money and they got refused Somebody burned 1st National down last night Smashed and looted daddy's shop downtown And grandpa said it'd never happen again The lesson it was learned real good before Now everybody's leaving town Sell the house and sell the farm But you just can't ride the boxcars anymore Looking for the few friends I have left To see if we can hitch a ride with someone else The headin' east a thousand miles or so But some one puts a knife into my back When the poets hopped a ride out west Grandpa got us by just sweeping floors Now everybody's leaving town Sell the house and sell the farm But you just can't ride the boxcars anymore Now everybody's leaving town Sell the house and sell the farm But you just can't ride the boxcars anymore\n\n14.\n\nGunslinger Man 03:07\n\nWell he came into town with His gun on his hips Fortified at night by some little pink slips Silver Smith and Wesson with a Pearl handled butt Cut polished shinin' from his hand to the nut Don't you know he's a gunslinger man 'N' he does the best that he can But you know he's a gunslinger man 'N' he won the West with his hand He used to be feared for the length of his gun Today he's known for the strength of his tongue In Poinsettia Park with Russian immigrants Hard as they work they're never heaven sent Don't you know he's a gunslinger man 'N' he does the best that he can But you know he's a gunslinger man 'N' he won the West with his hand Eight lines or worse, ten maids awaitin' He's thinking so loud that his teeth are grating False idols calling from his dusk to his dawn Got his daddy wonderin' what the hell he is on You'd see it in his eyes, see it in his verse Minute 'n' a half short of a ride in a hearse He needs no badges to identify him He's the owner/operator of original sin Don't you know he's a gunslinger man 'N' he does the best that he can But you know he's a gunslinger man 'N' he won the West with his hand\n\n15.\n\nI thought I saw some diplomat hawking secret plans in the park I thought I saw my President walking through Harlem late after dark In a world of love where they burn like Nero You write them a check and you then add zero In a world of love where they burn like Nero You write them a check and you then add zero Looking For Lewis And Clark I was standing alone in Mabuhay Gardens (looking for Lewis and Clark!) I was thinking about the late Tim Hardin Well, when Tim get to heaven hope he told Gram About the Long Ryders and just who I am Yeah, no one gave Tim reason to believe So he just packed his bags to leave Looking for Lewis and Clark Looking for Lewis and Clark Looking for Lewis and Clark I thought I saw my government running away with my heart I thought I heard Mubute anthems in Johannesburg after dark You can find them in the yellow pages, baby That's where you get your kickbacks from the Navy Looking for Lewis and Clark Looking for Lewis and Clark Looking for Lewis and Clark I said a Louie-Louie Lou...\n\n16.\n\nPrisoners Of Rock 04:08\n\n17.\n\n10-5-60 05:17"
