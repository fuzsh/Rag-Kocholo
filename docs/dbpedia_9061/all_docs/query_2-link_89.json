Even seeing someone do the ride already classifies as “previous knowledge.”\n\nBeyond category See hors catégorie.\n\nbidon A water bottle.\n\nBidon au miel (pronounced “bee-don oh mee-ell; bottle of honey”): You might know this French term as a sticky bottle—when a rider pretends to be getting a water bottle from the team car but hangs on and gets a tow. It’s become a general term for getting a push or pull when you need one.\n\nbike throw A bike throw occurs in the final moments of a bike race, usually within the last few feet.

The curved portions are called the hooks.\n\nE\n\néchappée bidon (esh-a-pay bee-don; water-bottle escape) Aside from the image of riders leisurely sipping water while others attack off the front, the literal translation from French makes little sense in English. This is a breakaway that’s more or less allowed to escape because no one is worried the riders will stay away—traditionally to give a team a chance to get some TV airtime, or to let local riders lead the way into their hometowns and make their families proud.\n\nechelon A diagonal paceline, which modifies the single-file formation for a crosswind.\n\nEl gancho (ell gan-cho; on the hook) Spanish for being at your limit—those times when if the pace picks up even a tiny bit, you’ll be finished. Like a fish on a hook being pulled from the water, a rider in this state is leaning far forward and gasping. The same experience is al gancio in Italian, though it references the idea of hanging like meat in an abattoir.\n\nendo The maneuver of flying unexpectedly over the handlebars, thus being forcibly ejected from the bike.

The image refers to a bowl suspended over or placed into a boiling pan of water for cooking—always thinking about food, those Italians.\n\nimpedimentia All the junk on a bike that impedes performance and looks bad.\n\ninvoluntary dismount A crash.\n\nJ\n\njam A period of hard, fast riding.\n\njet To accelerate quickly; to go very fast.\n\njump To aggressively increase speed without warning, hopefully creating a substantial advantage over your opponents. Also (more usually) denoting an attempt to bridge a gap from one group to another while riding.\n\nK\n\nkick Accelerating quickly with a few pedal strokes in an effort to break away from other riders (e.g. “Contador kicks again to try to rid himself of Rasmussen”).\n\nkicker A steep jump that gives you a lot of airtime. “I just flew off that kicker!”\n\nkite A rider who climbs very well but is a poor descender.\n\nknock Referred to as “the knock.” Short for “hunger knock.”\n\nL\n\nla fuga (la foo-gah; the flight) A colorful Italian term for a breakaway. (Careful with this in groups speaking multiple languages—in Spanish la fuga means ‘leaking,’ which could cause all kinds of confusion.)\n\nlanterne rouge This is the competitor in last place in a cycling race such as the Tour de France. The phrase comes from the French “Red Lantern” and refers to the red lantern hung on the caboose of a railway train, which conductors would look for in order to make sure none of the couplings had become disconnected.\n\nlead-out A race tactic in which a rider accelerates to his maximum speed for the benefit of a teammate in tow.

Used to inform the rider that you have positioned yourself in their slipstream for optimum drafting. For example: “I’m on your wheel.”\n\norgan donor A cyclist who rides without a helmet.\n\noverlap Riding in a position such that the leading edge of one’s front wheel is ahead of the trailing edge of the rear wheel of the bicycle immediately ahead. Overlap is potentially dangerous because of the instability that results if the wheels rub, and the simple fact that it allows the trailing rider to turn only in one direction (away from the wheel of the rider ahead). In road bicycle racing, overlap can be a significant cause of crashes, so beginning riders are instructed to “protect your front wheel” (avoid overlap) whenever riding in a pack.\n\nP\n\npaceline A line of riders (all it takes is two, yet the more there are, the better it works) traveling closely together and taking turns in the lead in order to save energy, share the work and travel more quickly than possible if riding alone.\n\npack The main group of riders sticking together in an event or race.\n\npalmarès A bicycle racer’s list of achievements, accomplishments or wins.\n\npanic skid To try with all one’s will and strength to prevent an impending stack by attempting to implant one’s heels as deeply as possible in the ground.

May also be called the field, bunch, or pack.\n\npinch flat A tire flat that is caused when the tube is pinched against the rim internally. It results from riding into an object too hard for the air pressure in the tube. Also called a snakebite.\n\npinned To ride fast. “You were pinned on that burrito!”\n\nportage To carry your bike.\n\nposer Derogatory term for people with expensive bikes that never actually ride.

Also called the broom wagon. SAG is an acronym for “support and gear” or “support and grub.”\n\nsand dig Section of trail with deep soft sand, tending to bog bikes down. Usage: “There’s a long sand dig from here to the mountain.”\n\nschwag Also, sometimes called “swag,” it’s free bicycle goodies, such as posters, caps, bottles, stickers etc. you pick up at cycling events, races, shops.\n\nscream To ride really fast.\n\nsession To repeatedly ride a section until you have perfected it. “I need to session those turns until I don’t have to dab anymore.”\n\nshapes To pull or throw shapes (origin: Irish slang for acting the “hard man”) is to pedal in an ungainly and un-fluid manner, usually due to exertion; a sign that a rider is about to crack or has cracked.
