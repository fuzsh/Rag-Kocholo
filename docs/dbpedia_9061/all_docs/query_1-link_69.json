        "text": "The Long Ryders\n\nSeptember November Sometime\n\nCherry Red Records\n\nReinventing the Alt. Country Template That They Helped Create.\n\nJust as I was making a list of Alt. Country pioneers for a future episode of the RMHQ Radio Show, an e-mail hailing the new album from The Long Ryders arrived in my ‘in box’ …. yet again serendipity is playing around with my brain!\n\nCountry Rock and Southern Rock had both morphed into Corporate Rock and a set of music fans like me where left waiting to sate out appetite and along came; what seems like a lifetime ago, The Long Ryders alongside The Good Sons and Grand Drive arrived out of nowhere and helped change our perception of what Country Music should and could sound like in the mid 1980’s.\n\nLeap forward nigh on 40 years and the band is back together again (for the umpteenth time) with a handful of original and key members with a brand new angle on their distinctive ‘Psychedelic Country Rock’ signature.\n\nThe title track September November Sometime comes at you like a half starved wild cat; there’s no time to get comfortable as the Ryders attack your senses with a feisty and punchy Urban tale full of passion and violin playing that’s worthy of Jerry Goodman after a night on mescal!\n\nThis is immediatly followed by Seasons Change; which sounds quite Byrdsian (no surprise there) but something that The Byrds may have thought too extreme for Dr Byrds & Mr Hyde …. if that makes sense; and hopefully will, when you hear it.\n\nWhat’s key to the arrangements here is the tightness of every track; this is the antithesis of all those fat and hirsute Truckers and Cowboys that litter Country Radio these days; there are melodies a ‘plenty, that’s for sure but a sense of ‘relationship claustrophobia’ too …. this ain’t Friday night drunk-dancing music; songs like Hand of Fate, To The Manor Born and/or Flying Down are contemporary, grown up songs with mature themes that need to be listened to (preferably in the car IMHO) that will have you pursing your lips as you tap your toes while making sure that the grandkids aren’t destroying the house.\n\nObviously I’m of an age when I can appreciate clever stories like the magnificent Tom Tom and the polar opposite and rocktastic Seasons Change without worrying if they’re ‘cool enough’ to discuss in public …. they are; but that’s not the point; I know what I like and it’s songs and albums like these; and who care what the man in the newspaper thinks?\n\nI’ll tell you what makes this album and these songs so different and more grown up than most everything that’s coming out of Nashville these days; it’s the inclusion of Song For Ukraine. An instrumental with soft Classical undertones and a melody; vis the violin that hints at Ukrainian Folk Music …. The Long Ryders probably don’t care if you like it or not (trust me you will) but it’s something that their socialist hearts felt had to be done.\n\nJust when you were least expecting it, The Long Ryders drop in a soulful Jug Band mash-up with Country Blues (Kitchen) and our little world is all the better for hearing it …. especially the harmonica solos.\n\nI’m pretty sure my choice of Favourite Song will change most every time I play this album; but while checking my notes from last week when I played it for the first time; I concur with my original thoughts that Elmer Gantry Is Alive and Well, the gentle Until God Takes Me Away and the effervescent shuffle of That’s What They Say About Love are all up there with not just the best of the Long Ryders back catalogue; but any or all of the cross-genres that make up Roots Music these days; and I’m singling out the jumping and hot That’s What They Say About Love which is everything I love about Cowtown Music all wrapped up in 2 minutes and 37 seconds.\n\nThe album closes with a fabulous dose of Country melancholia and coiled tension via Flying Out Of London which may or may not be a metaphor for a relationship break up; but regardless it’s still a stunning piece of music.\n\nDue to the unexpected passing of bassist Tom Stevens, bass duties on the new album were shared here by Murry Hammond of Americana stalwarts the Old 97s and the Long Ryders’ own Stephen McCarthy.\n\nThere’s a helluva lot to like here and absolutely nothing to dislike; regardless of the way the songs change direction on a whim without ever challenging the listeners sensibilities or taste.\n\nPS\n\nThe Long Ryders received the International Trailblazers Award from the Americana Music Association UK in January 2022. Nine months later, the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville honored the Long Ryders by including the band in a new exhibition titled “Western Edge: The Roots and Reverberations of Los Angeles Country-Rock.”\n\nReleased March 10th 2023\n\nhttps://www.thelongryders.com/"
