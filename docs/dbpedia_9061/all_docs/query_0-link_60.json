        "text": "Description\n\n'Native Sons' by the Long Ryders is and was not a mere classic but an out-and-out groundbreaking album. Recorded in early summer 1984 by the great Henry Lewy (Joni Mitchell's main man in the studio, also producer of the Flying Burrito Brothers and Gene Clark) by the time it was released it was the number one alternative/college radio album in the United States and the number two Indie Chart entry in England...kept out of first place only by the Smiths' Meat Is Murder.\n\n'Native Sons' was the first straight Country & Western meets a punk rock sensibility on the American musicial stage and it proved so influential both Chris Robinson (Black Crowes) and Jeff Tweedy (Wilco) have named it publicly as a wildly thought-provoking release for young hip (then) punks to have heard. Kurt Cobain had a copy (his favourite song was the 12-string dominated closer 'I Had A Dream' and so did Justin Currie of Del Amitri in Scotland. Elvis Costello was such a fan he signed the Long Ryders to his Demon label so 'Native Sons' could be issued in the UK.\n\nStarting off with the wild ride through a musical tip of the Stetson to Jerry Lee Lewis that the banging drums and James Burton-guitar of Final Wild Son provided to the ending McGuinn-like chimes of I Had A Dream this was a record like no others; Everly Brothers harmonies with mandolin, banjo and Rickenbackers, Dylanesque pleas for equality alongside aching heart romantic balladry, a sense of purpose and a page turning...Native Sons opened as many doors as it shut. With the late, great Gene Clark on board to sing on the Byrds-like Ivory Tower this was a sound which announced the future was here and the past was going to be part of it. 'Native Sons' is now reissued with both extra tracks and the entire 10-5-60 EP included for the first time."
