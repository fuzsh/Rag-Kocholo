        "text": "Using a MetroCard\n\nHold the card so the black magnetic strip is facing you and on the bottom of the card. (The clipped corner should be on the upper right.) Swipe your card through the reader at a medium speed, similar to how you would swipe a credit card in a credit card reader. When the turnstile screen says GO, proceed through the turnstile.\n\nNote: You cannot use an unlimited MetroCard within 18 minutes of swiping it.\n\nPay for multiple people: Up to four riders can use the same payment method. Tap OMNY or swipe a pay-per-ride MetroCard as each person enters.\n\nGet the right train\n\nSubways in New York are identified by their letters or numbers. Colors indicate which Manhattan \"trunk line\" a train serves. The ​​​ trains run along 8th Avenue, for example. The colors do not indicate similar service. The ​ and ​ each run on 6th Avenue, but only share five stops in common.\n\nKnow which train you're going to ride, and look for signs on the platform indicating where that train stops.\n\nWatch for service notices, and listen for announcements in the station.\n\nGo the right way\n\nIn Manhattan, \"Downtown\" means south and \"Uptown\" means north, so you will often see signs like \"Uptown & The Bronx\" or \"Downtown & Brooklyn.\" The train itself will not say these things. Instead, when the train arrives, its destination will be indicated by signage along the side of the train.\n\nOnce you get on the train, announcements may sound different. A \"Manhattan-bound\" ​ in Brooklyn still will go to the Bronx. It will become \"Bronx-bound\" once it gets to Manhattan, then \"Woodlawn-Jerome Avenue-bound\" in the Bronx.\n\nBe safe in the station\n\nStand back from the platform edge, especially when trains are entering and leaving the station.\n\nDon’t go onto the tracks for any reason. If you drop something on the tracks, leave it and let an MTA employee know. We’ll do our best to help retrieve it.\n\nIf there is no designated area, board at the center of the train when traveling with a personal mobility device or stroller. The conductor is usually at the center of the train, making it easier to get attention in case of problem.\n\nBoarding\n\nLet others exit the train before you board. Stand to the side of the doors before boarding, not in front of them.\n\nMove to the center of the car. It makes service faster for everyone.\n\nDon’t hold train doors open. It delays service for everyone.\n\nExiting trains and navigating stations\n\nBe sure you have all your belongings with you. We do have a lost and found, but would rather not see you there.\n\nFold strollers and carry children on stairs and escalators. Use elevators when possible.\n\nAsk any MTA employee for help when you need it. You can also use the Help Point intercom on station platforms.\n\nIf you're still in the subway, go to a station agent for help.\n\nIf not, you can file a claim with the MTA Lost & Found. Here are step-by-step instructions for what to do if you lost a personal item on the subway.\n\nIf you lost a MetroCard, see our instructions specifically for that.\n\nYou can bring...\n\nPersonal mobility devices. Wheelchairs, canes, walkers, scooters and the like are allowed at all times.\n\nDogs and other animals. They must be in a bag or other container and carried in a way that doesn’t annoy other riders. Service animals and working animals with law enforcement agencies are allowed at all times.\n\nBikes. Avoid rush hour.\n\nStrollers. Strollers are allowed as long as you’re using them to transport children.\n\nBoxes, packages, and small furniture. Don’t transport large items during rush hour."
