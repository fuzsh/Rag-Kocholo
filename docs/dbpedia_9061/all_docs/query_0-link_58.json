        "text": "Thursday 5th May. Under the Bridge. The Long Ryders. It’s the three amigos again for what is hoped to be a more sedate night than what Stamford Bridge saw on Monday and we certainly took the average age of the audience down by a few years.\n\nIt’s the reunion tour for a band whose heyday was the eighties. Lead vocals are shared amongst the three front members of the band with Sid Griffin taking the lions share. Despite its location Under the Bridge is a fine venue with good sightlines, sound and lights.\n\nThe Long Ryders have a fine repertoire of songs and they certainly wear their influence on their sleeves from The Beatles, Quo and the Byrds. It’s a whistle stop rocking good set all building up to the classic Looking for Lewis and Clark which has the whole crowd bursting into song.\n\nA great night with a great band and look forward to seeing them in another twenty years on the wheelchair ramp as Griffin puts it.\n\nRead more"
