        "text": "Welcome to Metra, the commuter rail system serving the Chicago area. Metra has 11 lines with 242 stations radiating from downtown Chicago to the six-county area of northeast Illinois. Trains run frequently during rush hour and about every hour during off-peak times. This New Riders Guide will help those who are new to the Metra system or who want to get reacquainted with it.\n\nPlanning a trip\n\nMetra's website makes it quick and easy to find out which line best fits your destination and your schedule. If you don't know which line is closest to you, don't worry. Go to our System Map and click on the \"Search\" tab on the upper right corner of the map. Enter your location and we'll tell you which station is closest to you. If you know which line you want to use, click on theMaps & Schedules tab and select your line to bring up a schedule finder tool for that line and your selected day of travel. Schedules vary depending on the day of the week you plan to travel: weekday, Saturday or Sunday. Sunday schedules are also in effect on New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas.\n\nIf you prefer to speak with a Metra representative, you can call our Passenger Services Department at 312-MY-METRA (312-696-3872) or the RTA Travel Information Center at 312-836-7000 . They'll be happy to answer your questions. You can also use the RTA Trip Planner.\n\nYour Fare\n\nMetra uses a distance-based fare structure consisting of four fare zones to determine the cost of One-Way Tickets, Day Passes, Day Pass 5-Packs and Monthly Passes. (Riders are charged based on the number of zones they travel through.) Click here to see a system map with fare zones. To determine your fare, you must know your originating station, your destination station, and the type of ticket you wish to buy. Two passes sold for weekend use cost a flat rate: the Saturday/Sunday/Holiday Day Pass is $7 and the Weekend Pass (available on the Ventra app only) is $10. Details about each ticket type can be found here.\n\nAll ticket types except Saturday/Sunday/Holiday Day Passes and Weekend Passes weekend passes and day passes are available at a reduced rate for K-12 students, seniors, low-income riders and other special classes as described here. Use the fare calculator here to see the cost of each type of ticket, full fare and reduced, between your selected origin and destination stations.\n\nIf you prefer to speak with a Metra representative, you can call our Passenger Services Department at 312-MY-METRA (312-696-3872) or the RTA Travel Information Center at 312-836-7000. They'll be happy to answer your questions.\n\nPurchasing Tickets\n\nMetra offers a few different ticket options including One-Way Tickets (a single, one-way ride), Day Passes (unlimited travel for a single day between the zones you select), Day Pass 5-Packs (five Day Passes that can be used on any five days within 90 days of purchase, available in the Ventra App only) and Monthly Passes (unlimited rides in a calendar month between your selected zones on weekdays and systemwide on weekends). On weekends, Metra offers a $7 Saturday/Sunday/Holiday Day Pass (unlimited rides on either Saturday or Sunday or Holiday) and a $10 Weekend Pass (unlimited rides on both Saturday and Sunday, available on the Ventra App only). Metra also has reduced fare rates for seniors, customers with disabilities, low-income riders, military personnel, families, students and children. For detailed information regarding all of Metra's fare programs, please go to the Fares page.\n\nThere are several ways to purchase tickets:\n\nVending Machines\n\nMost full and reduced ticket types are available from vending machines at all downtown stations and the busiest outlying stations. Click here to see which stations have vending machines.\n\nVentra App\n\nAll full and reduced ticket types are available from the Ventra app. Download the FREE app from the Apple App Store or Google Play.\n\nOn The Train\n\nOne-Way Tickets and Saturday/Sunday Day Passes can be purchased with cash on the train. However, if a vending machine was available at the station where you boarded, the conductor will charge an additional $5.\n\nThere is a summary of where to buy each type of ticket here.\n\nParking\n\nMonthly permit and daily fee parking is available at most train stations. However, Metra does not manage parking at most stations. Rather, the municipality in which the station is located usually manages the lots; each has different parking rules and regulations. For information about parking at each station, please call the phone number listed on each station page. Parking lots not operated by municipalities or their vendors generally are operated by SP+ Parking. SP+ Parking operates parking facilities at select locations in Chicago and the surrounding suburbs. SP+ Parking offers both daily and monthly parking options to meet Metra riders' parking needs.\n\nFor more details about parking at Metra stations, please go to our Parking page.\n\nRiding the Train\n\nBe sure to arrive at the station early so that you have time to park your car and purchase your ticket. Be advised that times listed in Metra timetables are departure times from each station, not arrival times; please plan accordingly and give yourself time to be in position on the platform. If a vending machine is not available at the station when you board, you can buy a ticket on the train from a conductor without penalty. You also can buy a Metra mobile ticket on your smartphone with the Ventra App. Download the FREE app from the Apple App Store or Google Play. When the train arrives, simply get on board, find a seat and, if you have a paper ticket, place it in the metal clip in front of you. (If you are riding on the upper level, the clip is on the side of the privacy panel.) If you have a mobile ticket, show the ticket on your smartphone screen when the conductor checks for tickets - you will be asked to tap the screen to verify the ticket is valid.\n\nLet the conductors know it's your first time traveling aboard Metra, and they'll be happy to help you if you have any questions or concerns about your trip. Announcements are made before each stop. When you hear the message announcing the approach of your stop, pick up your ticket and any items you brought with you and head to the vestibule to disembark at your final destination. Customers who are hearing impaired may want to notify a conductor about their stop during ticket collection.\n\nBicycles\n\nBikes are permitted on trains. For rules, procedures and restrictions about bringing bikes on Metra trains, please go to our Bikes on Trains page.\n\nMetra has also introduced new Bike Cars. Click here for details.\n\nHelpful Information\n\nAll Metra lines are fully accessible. Most stations are also fully accessible or have partial ADA accessibility. If you are in need of assistance, you should call ahead to check the level of accessibility at the stations you plan to use, or go to the Accessibility page for a list.\n\nMonthly permit and daily fee parking is available at most stations. However, Metra does not administer permit parking at most of the stations. Each municipality in which the station is located has different parking rules and regulations. For further information, see our Parking page or the appropriate station's section on this site.\n\nWe offer reduced rates for groups of 25 or more. To find out about our Group Travel call a Group Travel representative at 312-322-6772 weekdays from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Please be advised that your group's payment must be received at least two weeks prior to your trip.\n\nWe welcome your suggestions.
