        "text": "The Long Ryders were pioneers of ‘alt country’ music a good decade before the genre got a name, and Final Wild Songs, a new four-CD set issued by Cherry Red Records, is a definitive career overview…\n\nThe band’s original line-up was Sid Griffin (vocals, guitar, autoharp and bugle), Stephen McCarthy (guitar, steel guitar, mandolin and banjo), Des Brewer (bass – Brewer was later replaced by Tom Stevens) and Greg Sowders (drums and percussion). Formed in 1983 from the ashes of Los Angeles band The Unclaimed, the musicians brought a heady brew of diverse influences to the table – from country to punk rock. Consequently, the Long Ryders’ novel sound gave a respectful nod to the likes of Gram Parsons, The Clash, The Flying Burrito brothers, The Byrds and Buffalo Springfield.\n\nFor those of you less familiar with the band’s oeuvre, check out rockpillsTV’s mini-documentary here, which features a December 2014 interview with the band reliving their mid-Eighties pomp.\n\nAs discussed in the documentary, a lack of radio play in the States and the predominance of synth pop music in the UK meant that commercial success was elusive for this “organic band” whose members always followed their instincts for writing good songs rather than what would sell. That’s why, perhaps, as acerbic comedian and Long Ryders’ enthusiast Stewart Lee puts it, they are “one of rock’s great undiscovered bands, like the Flamin’ Groovies and Big Star.”\n\nSo high time to discover them, then, and this box set appears to be as good a way as any to do so. According to a post on Griffin’s Facebook page in December announcing Final Wild Songs, Griffin and Stevens spent over a year compiling and organising the songs featured in the set. With all tracks remastered by Andy Pearce (from the original tapes, where they existed), Griffin claims the recordings have never sounded so good.\n\nThe first three CDs feature the 10/5/60 EP, the three LPs the band recorded – Native Sons, State Of Our Union and Two Fisted Tales. There are also 18 rare tracks – eight of which are previously unreleased – including, on disc two, audio of the band performing Looking For Lewis And Clark on the Beeb’s Old Grey Whistle Test in 1985. The bonus tracks on that disc also include completely different mixes of Lights Of Downtown and Capturing The Flag from sessions for the State Of Our Union album. The CDs also include nine selections previously only released in the USA, and listen out for a “top-secret hidden brief track” too.\n\nThe fourth disc offers the rarest treat of all for Long Ryders disciples, showcasing as it does their March 1985 gig in Goes, The Netherlands. Long forgotten, this concert was unearthed by Stevens from his personal collection, and the track list includes live versions of songs they played on that one tour alone.\n\nThe box set’s artwork and enclosed booklet is designed by UK graphic artist, Phil Smee (a close friend of Griffin’s). The booklet features previously unseen photos, fans’ memorabilia, a fold-out poster, song-by-song comments by “five Long Ryders” (we’re assuming the fifth one is original bassist Des Brewer… ) and an introduction by Rolling Stone writer and Long Ryders’ fan, David Fricke.\n\nAnd if the box set whets your appetite to see the reformed band play live, they are touring in 2016. The schedule is currently a bit hazy so look out for precise gig dates and venues, but the European tour will begin in Spain on 23 April and end in Scandanavia (probably) on 7 May, with a London date or two (hopefully) in between. Sid Griffin will also be playing some solo gigs in the UK in June before rejoining his fellow Long Ryders in August for their first proper US tour for 28 years.\n\nFinal Wild Songs is released on 22 January 2016.\n\n• UK Pre-order: Final Wild Songs\n\n• USA Pre-order: Final Wild Songs\n\n• CANADA Pre-order: Final Wild Songs\n\n• GERMANY Pre-order: Final Wild Songs\n\n• FRANCE Pre-order: Final Wild Songs\n\n• ITALY Pre-order: Final Wild Songs\n\nDisc One: 1983-1984\n\nOriginal 10/5/60 EP:\n\nJoin My Gang\n\nYou Don’t Know What’s Right…\n\n10/5/60\n\nAnd She Rides\n\nBorn To Believe In You\n\nNative Sons:\n\nFinal Wild Son\n\nIvory Tower\n\nRun Dusty Run\n\n(Sweet) Mental Revenge\n\nFair Game\n\nTell It To The Judge On Sunday\n\nWreck Of The 809\n\nToo Close To The Light\n\nNever Got To Meet The Mom\n\nI Had A Dream\n\nMasters Of War\n\nBlack Girl – Acoustic May-June 1984\n\nWreck Of The 809 – Acoustic May-June 1984\n\nFurther Along – Acoustic May-June 1984\n\nThe Rains Came – CBGBs April 1984\n\nYou Can’t Judge A Book By The Cover – West End, Chicago Nov 1984\n\nDisc Two: 1985\n\nState Of Our Union:\n\nLooking For Lewis And Clark\n\nLights Of Downtown\n\nWDIA\n\nMason-Dixon Line\n\nHere Comes That Train Again\n\nYears Long Ago\n\nGood Times Tomorrow, Hard Times Today\n\nTwo Kinds Of Love\n\nYou Can’t Ride The Boxcars Anymore\n\nCapturing The Flag\n\nState Of My Union\n\nSouthside Of The Story\n\nChild Bride\n\nIf I Were A Bramble And You Were A Rose\n\nLooking For Lewis And Clark – OGWT\n\nLights Of Downtown – Captain’s Mix, Island Studios\n\nCapturing The Flag – Captain’s Mix, Island Studios\n\nChristmas In New Zealand – State Of Our Union\n\nEncore From Hell\n\nDisc Three: 1986\n\nTwo Fisted Tales:\n\nGunslinger Man\n\nI Want You Bad\n\nA Stitch In Time\n\nThe Light Gets In The Way\n\nPrairie Fire\n\nBaby’s In Toyland\n\nLong Story Short\n\nMan Of Misery\n\nHarriet Tubman’s Gonna Carry Me Home\n\nFor The Rest Of My Days\n\nSpectacular Fall\n\nRing Bells\n\nDemos:\n\n17 Ways\n\nBasic Black\n\nPushin’ Uphill\n\nHow Do We Feel What’s Real\n\nHe’s Got Himself A Young Girl (And He Can’t Keep Up)\n\nHe Can Hear His Brother Calling\n\nSad Sad Songs\n\nFlak Jacket\n\nBlues Theme\n\nDisc Four: Live ’T Beest, Goes, The Netherlands (1985)\n\nMason Dixon Line\n\nTime Keeps Traveling\n\n(Sweet) Mental Revenge\n\nRun Dusty Run\n\nYou Don’t Know What’s Right…\n\nAs God Is My Witness\n\nIvory Tower\n\nI Can’t Hide\n\nMasters Of War\n\nWreck Of The 809\n\nGood Times Tomorrow, Hard Times Today\n\nSix Days On The Road\n\nSouthside Of The Story\n\nStill Get By\n\nTell It To The Judge On Sunday\n\n• UK Pre-order: Final Wild Songs\n\n• USA Pre-order: Final Wild Songs\n\n• CANADA Pre-order: Final Wild Songs\n\n• GERMANY Pre-order: Final Wild Songs\n\n• FRANCE Pre-order: Final Wild Songs\n\n• ITALY Pre-order: Final Wild Songs"
