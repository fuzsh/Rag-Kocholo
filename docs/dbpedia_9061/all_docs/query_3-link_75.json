They are often credited as founders of the alt-country movement and are the recent recipients of the Americana Music Association UK’s “International Trailblazer Award”.\n\nThe band’s three founding members Sid Griffin, Stephen McCarthy and Greg Sowders continue to tour the world and are currently working on a follow-up album to 2019’s widely acclaimed #1 UK Americana album, Psychedelic Country Soul. Both records produced by Ed Stasium. Their current single “Tom Tom” is a heartfelt tribute to their late/great bass player Tom Stevens."
