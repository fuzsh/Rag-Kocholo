        "text": "There are some bands who inexplicably pass you by. Despite being favourites of some of my AUK colleagues, The Long Ryders were one of those groups for me. Having started to correct that oversight by buying the recent reissue of ‘Native Sons’ and a ticket for their tour in October, I’ve become that most irritating thing, a late convert.\n\nThe mix of 60’s psychedelia, Alt.Country and new wave punch may have been a bit subtle for 20 year old me in the early 80s, but these days blends everything I like best. From the drums that kick ‘Final Wild Son‘ into action to the almost Monkees guitar riff and the Dylaneseque vocal, they are exactly what drew me to Americana in the 90s. While their studio work has plenty enough bite, they come into their own live. Having seen them perform a couple of times in their recent reunion phase I am of course regretting not catching up earlier. A gig in Glasgow in 2019 where the encore consisted of an unaccompanied rendering of ‘I Belong to Glasgow‘ that won over the locals in fine style, following a ‘Looking for Lewis & Clark’ that confirmed it as my favourite of their songs. The guitar solo towards the end always seems to be an opportunity for chaos to set in, and that’s what led me to looking for the best take on You Tube.\n\nI discounted the version of one of their finest songs from the Whistle Test of 1985 due to the “hilarious” antics of the presenters that book end an incendiary performance, which sees them channelling MC5 more than The Byrds. You can find that, without Andy Kershaw’s inane ramblings, on the ‘Final Wild Songs’ box set, and if you don’t own that then you should… As I said I’m a late convert.\n\nSo, here we have ‘Looking for Lewis & Clark’ in the venue in Bristol to which they will return this year. A little more restrained than 40 years ago maybe, but still packing a punch. You also get a taste of the true Fleece gig-going experience, with the pillars that obstruct bits of the stage if you stand in the wrong place. It is however one of the great small venues and never fails to provide an atmosphere that enhances the best shows. So, I’ll be there early on 15th October to secure my place with maximum view of the stage ready to enjoy one of the great live bands. The only question will be, “why didn’t I find them sooner?”\n\nWhether on record or in concert, The Long Ryders deliver their music with a verve and passion that should be the template for anyone in our corner of the musical forest. They are an exciting band to experience, and you should do so. Did I mention that I’m a late convert?"
