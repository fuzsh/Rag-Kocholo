        "text": "Great band, a reunion album due out this year.\n\nThe Long Ryders - 2022 Tour Dates. ( weird…site says 2023 dates)\n\nThey did have folk, country influences like True West. I thought more Paisley Underground than alt Country that came with Jason and the Scorchers, Rosie Flores, etc., In time they were all going the same direction. Concurrent was the cow punk scene which tended to be rawer punkish Country: Blood On the Saddle, Rank and File, etc., I see Wiki dumps many bands together as one scene when they weren’t, though it seems they should be in retrospect.\n\nMy cousin's husband is the bass player, Tom Stevens. HE dropped us a cassette of the Native Sons album right after release. Soon after, they were touring overseas (UK?) with the Rock-a-billy band, The Blasters. Tom was with Paisley Underground before being recruited to The Long Ryders.\n\nThe album scheduled for release in March (September November -- that's the title!) is not a \"reunion\" album: as far as I know, the band has always been together! I have their 2019 album entitled Psychedelic Country Soul that is an excellent release. And the reason that their tour dates state \"2023\" is because they will be touring later this year to promote the new album. Here's the 2023 tour schedule.\n\nTom Stevens is dead now. And I don't think he was part of the Paisley Underground until he JOINED Long Ryders, who were considered one of the original Paisley Underground bands.\n\nMy mistake --- I was just going off what I had just read regarding the formation of The Long Ryders and possibly misunderstood.\n\nYes terribly sad about Tom Stevens. The Paisley Underground was a name given to a collective (some related some not) of bands .\n\nI'm fairly sure that there was never a band called The Paisley Underground.\n\nAt least it appears we have a young person that has discovered one of the great 1980's bands.\n\nI have a number of Tom Stevens albums.\n\nThe Long Ryders are just about to release a new album\n\nFunny thing --- Tom met his wife Elaine when they both worked at Tower Records on Sunset Blvd in LA. The demise of the record store has taken more than just music. : )\n\nNice to hear Lon Ryders are back at it.\n\nAs for the name Paisley Underground, without looking it up, I seem to remember that name is somehow connected with The Dream Syndicate and Steve Wynn. But then, that could just be my being a huge Wynn, TDS fan so I'm not sure.\n\nA fun album some here my know is called 3 x 4 in which each of four bands- The Bangles, The Three O'clock, The Dream Syndicate, and Rain Parade- recorded three songs by the other bands. Would have been cool to have Long Ryders in on this!\n\nThe Bangles* • The Three O'Clock • The Dream Syndicate • Rain Parade – 3×4\n\nLabel: Yep Roc Records – YEP-2596\n\nFormat:\n\n2 x Vinyl, LP, Stereo, Purple Swirl\n\nCountry: Worldwide\n\nReleased: Nov 23, 2018\n\nGenre: Rock, Pop"
