Tell It To The Judge On Sunday\n\nCherry Red Records (CRCDBOX21)\n\nIt took over two year’s work but the Long Ryders finally have their own box set. 76 tracks of which 23 were previously unreleased, nine were only on CD in the USA beforehand, and with a hidden snippet of a track which will make you smile.\n\nThe first three CDs contain the band’s initial EP, their first three albums and most of these above-mentioned assorted goodies. The four CD is a smokin’, totally hot live show from March 1985 in Europe with 15 performances never heard since (unless you were one of the few who had a bootleg cassette of the show) which proves, more than anything ever will or could, the Long Ryders had one of the best, strongest, and most powerful live shows on the planet.\n\nThis box set sold out entirely within eighteen days (!) of its release and now you can see and hear why. Oh yes, Cherry Red manufactured some more, you bet, and it is still in print. So you can still hear why Mojo, Uncut, Record Collector, Rolling Stone and so many other magazines gave this collection column after column in their Reviews section. This is Americana defined and honoured in a mere four discs.\n\nThe Long Ryders – Native Sons (Deluxe Reissue)\n\nFinal Wild Son\n\nStill Get By\n\nIvory Tower\n\nRun Dusty Run\n\n(Sweet) Mental Revenge\n\nFair Game\n\nTell It To The Judge On Sunday\n\nWreck Of The 809\n\nToo Close To The Light\n\nNever Got To Meet Her\n\nI Had A Dream\n\nJoin My Gang\n\nYou Don’t Know What’s Right, You Don’t Know What’s Wrong\n\n10-5-60\n\nBorn To Believe In You\n\nThe Trip\n\nAnd She Rides\n\nTime Keeps Travelling\n\nI Can’t Hide\n\nMasters Of War\n\nStill Get By\n\n10-5-60\n\nAnd She Rides\n\nToo Close To The Light\n\nPrima SID024\n\nNative Sons is the album which Jeff Tweedy, Chris Robinson, Kurt Cobain and Gary Louris all bought and loved, influencing their own styles. It was a huge hit on the College Radio/Alternative Charts in the USA in 1984 and by spring 1985 it was number two on the New Musical Express Indie Chart, held off the top spot by the Smiths’ Meat Is Murder. Arguably the most influential and long-lasting release of Sid Griffin’s career Native Sons is now re-released with the entire 10-5-6- EP added as well as three tracks from the abandoned 5 By 5 sessions at A&M Studios, the Long Ryders’ first three demos and the B-side Close To The Light, a completely different mix to the LP version. This is the LP which kick-started Americana and put the “alt” into Alt-Country!\n\nThe Long Ryders – State Of Our Reunion Live 2004\n\nSo You Wanna Be A Rock & Roll Star?\n\nLights Of Downtown\n\nYou Don’t Know What’s Right, You Don’t Know What’s Wrong\n\nA Stitch In Time\n\nPrairie Fire\n\nWreck Of The 809\n\nGunslinger Man\n\nYears Long Ago\n\nI Can’t Hide\n\nIvory Tower\n\nCapturing The Flag\n\nBand Introduction (Glasgow)\n\nI Had A Dream\n\nFinal Wild Son\n\n(Sweet) Mental Revenge\n\nState Of Our Union\n\nLooking For Lewis & Clark\n\nLouisville\n\n10-5-60\n\nPrima SID021\n\nFor their first live gigs in seventeen years (!) the Long Ryders knew the pressure was on. But they kicked ass and took names and you can hear the results on this stellar recording from their London gig. Cut on a hot summer night the sold out venue turned punters away and the result was a classic live album which can be filed next to Get Your Ya-Ya’s Out, Live At The Apollo or Kick Out The Jams. Featuring the classic lineup of ex-Jayhawk Stephen McCarthy, Indiana state senator Tom Stevens, publishing mogul Greg Sowders and Dylan author Sid Griffin.\n\nThe Best of the Long Ryders\n\nLooking For Lewis & Clark (long version)\n\nLights Of Downtown\n\nYears Long Ago\n\nGunslinger Man\n\nI Want You Bad\n\nA Stitch In Time\n\nMan Of Misery\n\nIf I Were A Bramble And You Were A Rose\n\nCapturing The Flag (live)\n\nState Of My Union\n\nFinal Wild Son\n\nIvory Tower\n\n(Sweet) Mental Revenge\n\nI Had A Dream\n\nYou Don’t Know What’s Right, You Don’t Know What’s Wrong\n\nAnd She Rides\n\nMasters Of War\n\nI Can’t Hide\n\nPrima SID016\n\nThe first ever single CD Long Ryders compilation features tracks from across their entire career and from every label the band were on. Featuring liner notes from the rhythm section of Tom Stevens and Greg Sowders as well as Pete Frame’s very informative Long Ryders Family Tree this release includes over a dozen previously unseen photographs of the band in their heyday. This is the one Long Ryders CD to have if you only want one and an excellent introduction to the Founding Fathers of alt-country. Officially Prima Records bestselling CD as of May 1, 2008.\n\nThe Long Ryders – Three Minute Warnings\n\nPrairie Fire\n\nLights Of Downtown\n\nMan Of Misery\n\nA Stitch In Time\n\nState Of My Union\n\nHarriet Tubman’s Going To Carry Me Home\n\nCapturing The Flag\n\nLong Story Short\n\nBaby’s In Toyland\n\nI Want You Bad\n\nSpectacular Fall\n\nI Had A Dream\n\nYou Just Can’t Ride The Boxcars Anymore\n\nGunslinger Man\n\nLooking For Lewis & Clark\n\nPrisoners Of Rock\n\n10-5-60\n\nPrima SID015(CD)\n\nA great recording of the Long Ryders show at the Bottom Line in New York City on 7th May 1987 as broadcast live on FM. A wonderful showcase for a rocking fine band, the CD booklet has liner notes by the band’s long time and long suffering manager John Guarnieri. Reviews in Rolling Stone (USA), The Sunday Times, Q, Mojo, UnCut et al were all estatic!\n\nThe Long Ryders Anthology\n\nDisc One: 10-5-60\n\nAnd She Rides\n\nBorn To Believe In You\n\nYou Don’t Know What’s Right, You Don’t Know What’s Wrong\n\nJoin My Gang/Final Wild Son\n\nIvory Tower\n\nStill Get By\n\nRun Dusty Run\n\n(Sweet) Mental Revenge\n\nFair Game\n\nToo Close To The Light\n\nI Had A Dream\n\nI’ll Get Out Somehow*\n\nMasters Of War**\n\nI Can’t Hide**\n\nLights Of Downtown\n\nMason-Dixon Line\n\nCapturing The Flag\n\nYears Long Ago\n\nDisc Two: Looking For Lewis And Clark (long version)\n\nState Of My Union\n\nTwo Kinds Of Love\n\nIf I Were A Bramble And You Were A Rose\n\nChristmas In New Zealand\n\nBasic Black*\n\nPushin’ Uphill*\n\nHe Can Hear His Brother Calling*\n\n17 Ways*\n\nHe’s Got Himself A Young Girl (And He Can’t Keep Up)*\n\nGunslinger Man\n\nI Want You Bad\n\nA Stitch In Time\n\nBaby’s In Toyland\n\nHarriet Tubman’s Gonna Carry Me Home*\n\nThe Light Gets In The Way*\n\nSpectacular Fall\n\nFlak Jacket\n\nRing Bells\n\nPrisoners Of Rock’N’Roll (live)\n\nPolygram Records 314 558 280 (USA) (2xCD)\n\nReleased in July 1998, this 40 track compilation covers every period of The Long Ryders’ influential existence. Every note has been expertly remastered by sonic expert Bill Inglot so the sound quality throughout is stunning. The booklet includes great sleevenotes by Rolling Stone’s David Fricke and a fine selection of photographs. Tracks marked * above are previously unreleased demos, whilst those marked ** are previously unreleased final recordings. All the unreleased tracks were mixed by Sid Griffin in Los Angeles in early 1998. The Light Gets In The Way is listed on the CD as being the album version but sounds like the demo version to everyone in the Prima Records Office. The long version of Looking For Lewis And Clark from the ten inch single release makes its first appearance on CD. Now out of print.\n\nThe Long Ryders – BBC Radio One Live In Concert\n\nPrairie Fire\n\nA Stitch In Time\n\nHarriet Tubman’s Gonna Carry Me Home\n\nI Want You Bad\n\nI Had A Dream\n\nYou Just Can’t Ride The Boxcars Anymore\n\nGunslinger Man\n\nLooking For Lewis And Clark\n\nIvory Tower\n\nFinal Wild Son\n\nState Of My Union\n\nLights Of Downtown\n\nWindsong WINCD 058 (CD)\n\nA 1994 release of recordings made and broadcast by the BBC. Recorded live at the Mayfair Club, Newcastle, 3.6.87, except for the last four tracks which were recorded for the Andy Kershaw show at the Chester Rendezvous Club, 15.10.85. An very well recorded live performance captured with typical great care by BBC engineers, an especially noteworthy achievement when you consider a rather ugly fight broke out in the mosh pit during the Chester performance which involved a good half dozen male Brits whopping the beejeezus out of each other for about fifteen minutes till order was restored.

The new edition also includes heartfelt sleeve notes by Long Ryders’ drummer Greg Sowders who is now a song publishing expert at Warner-Chappell in his native Los Angeles (or so he says.)\n\nDeluxe edition now out of print.\n\nThe Long Ryders – State Of Our Union\n\nLooking for Lewis and Clark\n\nLights of Downtown\n\nWDIA\n\nMason-Dixon Line\n\nHere Comes That Train Again\n\nYears Long Ago\n\nGood Times Tomorrow, Hard Times Today\n\nTwo Kinds Of Love\n\nYou Just Can’t Ride The Boxcars Anymore\n\nCapturing The Flag\n\nState Of My Union\n\nIf I Were a Bramble and You Were a Rose*\n\nSouthside of the Story*\n\nChild Bride*\n\nChristmas in New Zealand*\n\nIsland ILPS9802(LP); Prima SID003(CD)\n\nThe band’s most well known and highest charting album and one which features their biggest chart hit. Reissued by Prima Records in a remastered and extended form including the bonus tracks marked *. Universal Records (UK) almost released this CD once again in summer 2004 on the strength of the Long Ryders State Of Our Reunion Tour but at the last second cancelled their plans. (Bean counters run the record biz now, a pity.) Now out of print.\n\nA Conversation With The Long Ryders – State Of Our Union\n\nIsland LR1(LP)\n\nA promotional LP containing interviews with the Long Ryders in between the album tracks. Copies are occasionally seen in specialist record shops and on eBay going for ridiculous prices. Sid recently sold his entire record collection as it was in very expensive storage in L.

The Frontier and Zippo CD versions include the 10-5-60 mini album, but the latest Demon/Diabolo version (1996) does not.

The last four tracks are the most interesting as ex-Byrd Chris Hillman guests with the Long Ryders on stage at the Roxy in Hollywood\n\nThe End Of The Trail\n\nPrairie Fire\n\nLights Of Downtown\n\nMan Of Misery\n\nStitch In Time\n\nState Of My Union\n\nHarriet Tubman’s Gonna Carry Me Home\n\nCapturing The Flag\n\nLong Story Short\n\nBaby’s In Toyland\n\nI Want You Bad/Spectacular Fall\n\nI Had A Dream\n\nYou Just Can’t Ride The Boxcars Anymore\n\nGunslinger Man\n\nLooking For Lewis And Clark\n\nPrisoners Of Rock’N’Roll\n\n10-5-60\n\nMassive Attack Discs 990129 (CD)\n\nA great bootleg CD taken from an FM broadcast of the show at the Bottom Line in New York City on 7th May 1987. This is the very same release as the new official Long Ryders album Three Minute Warnings: The Long Ryders Live In New York City on Prima Records (SID015). However Three Minute Warnings has much, much better sound as it is from the original master tapes.\n\nInterestingly enough those original master tapes ran out with some ninety seconds left in the concert so the tail end of 10-5-60 on Three Minute Warnings is actually a digital edit from The End Of The Trail bootleg!\n\nSounds Of An Empty Pint Pitchfork (LP)\n\nFinal Wild Son\n\n(Sweet) Mental Revenge\n\nRun Dusty Run/Lights Of Downtown\n\nGood Times Tomorrow,Hard Times Today\n\nMasters Of War\n\nI Had A Dream\n\nIvory Tower\n\nWreck Of The 809\n\nState Of My Union\n\nYou Just Can’t Ride The Boxcars Anymore\n\nLooking For Lewis And Clark\n\nTell It To The Judge On Sunday\n\nSix Days On The Road\n\nA bootleg LP, recorded on the State OfOur Union UK tour at Newcastle University, 19.10.85.
