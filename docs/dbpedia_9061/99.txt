The Long Ryders are an American alternative country and Paisley Underground band, principally active between 1982 and 1987, who have periodically regrouped for brief reunions (2004, 2009, 2014, 2016). In 2019 they released a new studio album – their first in 32 years – and played a series of tour dates.

The Long Ryders were originally formed by several American musicians who were each multi-instrumentalists and influenced by Gram Parsons, the Byrds, country music and various punk rock groups. They were named after the Walter Hill film, the Long Riders. The band featured Sid Griffin and Stephen McCarthy on vocals and guitar; Des Brewer on bass (later replaced by Tom Stevens); and Greg Sowders on drums.

Peel was not a fan of the group and even declined a request from a listener who wanted to play a track from the group on his 05 June 1985 show. His friend and colleague, Andy Kershaw, was more of a follower of the band and even played a song from the group, whilst sitting in for Peel on his 27 May 1985 programme.
