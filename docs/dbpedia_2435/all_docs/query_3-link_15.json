        "text": "Today, we are proud to share our new three-year strategy with you. We know that having low levels of literacy risks social and economic exclusion. That is why, for the last 30 years, we have been empowering people with the literacy skills they need to succeed in life. Our mission is still as critical and powerful as ever but as the literacy landscape changes, we need a new, bold and ambitious strategy that will shape our work and help us deliver more impact over the next three years. Jonathan Douglas, CEO of the National Literacy Trust says: ‘The literacy skills we need to thrive as individuals, communities and a nation are at a higher level and more complex than ever before. As a result, we need to evolve and grow as an organisation and our ambitious, new strategy takes everything we’ve learned, all the evidence and evaluation we’ve collated over the past thirty years and builds on this knowledge, so we have the tools and the focus to meet the changing needs of the most marginalised in our society.’ Partnerships have been, and continue to be, critical to the way we make change happen. We want to share our strategy with you so that you too are inspired and emboldened to continue changing people’s life stories with us. As we deliver our strategy, your support for our work is needed now more than ever. Read the strategy: https://lnkd.in/dm5XM8wY"
