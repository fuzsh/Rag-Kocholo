The panel sifted through 596 entries for the awards.\n\nEach winner is to receive £5,000, and the ultimate Costa Book of the Year accolade is worth £30,000. Results will be announced on January 3 2017.\n\nHere is the full list of nominees shortlisted:\n\nNovel\n\nSebastian Barry for Days Without End (Faber & Faber)\n\nMaggie O'Farrell for This Must Be the Place (Tinder Press)\n\nSarah Perry for The Essex Serpent (Serpent's Tail)\n\nRose Tremain for The Gustav Sonata (Chatto & Windus)\n\nFirst novel\n\nSusan Beale for The Good Guy (John Murray)\n\nKit de Waal for My Name Is Leon (Viking)\n\nGuinevere Glasfurd for The Words in My Hand (Two Roads)\n\nFrancis Spufford for Golden Hill (Faber & Faber)\n\nBiography\n\nKeggie Carew for Dadland: A Journey Into Uncharted Territory (Chatto & Windus)\n\nJohn Guy for Elizabeth: The Forgotten Years (Viking)\n\nHisham Matar for The Return: Fathers, Sons and the Land in Between (Viking)\n\nSylvia Patterson for I'm Not With the Band: A Writer's Life Lost in Music (Sphere)\n\nPoetry\n\nMelissa Lee-Houghton for Sunshine (Penned in the Margins)\n\nAlice Oswald for Falling Awake (Jonathan Cape Poetry)\n\nDenise Riley for Say Something Back (Picador)\n\nKate Tempest for Let Them Eat Chaos (Picador)\n\nChildren's books"
