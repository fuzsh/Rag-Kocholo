        "text": "As she finally wins the prestigious Orange fiction award, Rose Tremain reveals what inspired her moving novel about an immigrant adapting to life in modern-day Britain\n\nAfter one hour's sleep, and possibly one too many glasses of champagne, Rose Tremain is hoarsely struggling to convey the precise degree of elation she feels at having won the £30,000 Orange Broadband prize for fiction after years of being the uncomplaining, best-selling runner-up.\n\nOn Wednesday night, The Road Home, her novel about the travails of an Eastern European immigrant to Britain, delivered her the imprimatur of literary recognition and, yes, \"it felt pretty good\".\n\nShe had perfected her loser's smile. Instead, she had to give an acceptance speech. Celebrated writer that she is, there was a feeling, not least to her, that the honour was a little overdue.\n\nTremain is rare in admitting the importance of prizes. She has won a few smaller ones - including the Whitbread Novel Award in 1999 for Music and Silence. They are like speed bumps, she says. \"You cannot pretend they are not there.\n\nIt's disingenuous to pretend we are indifferent to them. It's very crowded, the book world, and a prize focuses the spotlight - for which we feel grateful.\"\n\n\"People say to me: 'Do you write books for prizes?' It couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nIt is unreal, this media thing you go through - especially for writers, who are on the whole very private people. Writers these days have to be performers from time to time, they have to step into a presentational role, but it is all slightly alien.\"\n\nTremain is fine-boned and serene. Though she claims sometimes to be hysterical, you cannot imagine her even ruffled. She looks pretty much as she did nearly 20 years ago when she won her first accolade, a newspaper's book of the year award for Restoration.\n\nShe is often pigeonholed as a historical writer and this may explain why, even though her books sell between 200,000 and 250,000 copies and are published in 25 countries, she has not won a really big prize before.\n\nNovels such as Restoration (set during the reign of Charles II); the many-stranded Music and Silence (17th-century Danish court); and The Colour, with its background of the west-coast gold rush in New Zealand in the 1860s, may hold a mirror to contemporary society, but they ­are deemed not \"to engage\" with modern times sufficiently.\n\n\"There is this terrible word 'relevance' among prize judges,\" she says. \"We are so obsessed with our own time.\" And she should know: she has twice sat on the Man Booker jury and understands the way the wheels work.\n\nWhen The Road Home opens, Lev is on his way from Eastern Europe to Britain seeking work, an idealistic, heartsore man whose wife has died of cancer. He needs money to send home to his mother and four-year-old daughter. But the country he finds at the end of his 50 hour bus journey is neither welcoming nor civilised.\n\nThe book may not be overtly political, but it delivers a harsh commentary on city life - the exploitation and petty bureaucracy, dirty, hostile streets, rip-off merchants, squalid flats.\n\nBut there's comedy, too - kitchen life in a celebrity restaurant, a glimpse into the surreal cheeriness of a care home and labour in the asparagus fields of East Anglia.\n\nIt is not a big book, but it feels as though it's written on a big canvas. \"When I started, my novels were rather small-scale.\n\nThen when I came to Restoration I suddenly found this enormous big, noisy world and I've been in that noisy world ever since.\"\n\nThe idea for the book took root when she saw a television programme in 2005 about immigrants in London. A young man was living not on the street but under the street, almost in a coalhole, like the coalholes she remembered from her own London childhood.\n\n\"He had made this nest for himself, with all this weight of what was going on above. It was like all the possibilities were above him and yet unreachable. I wanted to start with a character in that situation.\"\n\nHer theme was primed by a sequence of grim news stories about immigrants: the deaths of Chinese cockle-pickers in Morecambe Bay, gang masters, people in wretched accommodation, labourers being bused to locations in the middle of the night.\n\n\"It was important to make Lev sympathetic,\" she says. \"But he has this dark, angry side, too. I also wanted to explore his melancholy.\n\nIt was a conscious decision to make him attractive to women - it would present a satisfactory set of complications in his life. But he is not a loser. I didn't want the reader to feel pity for him.\"\n\nShe thinks the British are bipolar in their attitude to immigrants - a condition she shares.\n\n\"We have this manic anxiety, which is to do with numbers, and [the limitations of] housing and resources. But also this depressive anxiety that disturbs our vision of ourselves as a benign, multicultural, liberal society.\"\n\nPeople write to her saying that, after reading the book, they look at the builders next door in a different way, not as an amorphous and slightly threatening group. \"That's exactly what I hoped might happen.\"\n\nOne of her correspondents wanted to know how the residents in an old people's home would cope when Lev stopped making beautiful meals for them.\n\n\"I love it when readers worry for a character in fiction exactly as they would worry for a friend.\"\n\nIn her big themes, Tremain is more inventive than she's sometimes given credit for and her understanding of the male psyche is unusual. Sacred Country is about a transsexual searching for acceptance.\n\nThe Way I Found Her, a psychological thriller set in Paris, gets inside the skin of an adolescent boy.\n\nThere is probably nothing, short of an autobiography, that she could not do well. \"I like to have my imagination pushed. The closer I get to my own biography, the more I feel boredom creeping round the edges.\"\n\nShe likes the question-and-answer sessions that are part of an author's performance.\n\n\"I hear myself saying things about the book that I didn't really know that I thought. Under public scrutiny, a book takes on a slightly different life. It starts to feel bigger than it was when you were writing it. That is quite a good feeling.\"\n\nTremain and her partner, the biographer Richard Holmes, work at opposite ends of a spacious Norfolk town house, meeting for lunch (which she prepares), before retreating once more to their separate lives until supper.\n\n\"I can tell from the minute he walks into the kitchen whether his day has gone well. Living with another writer is a great delight. You can kick around a problem with a listener who is attentive but neutral.\"\n\nShe says her energy for long-distance travelling is diminishing but, touch wood, her energy for writing seems to be increasing.\n\n\"I don't feel I am running out of road,\" she says. \"That sounds very hubristic, but I feel I've got a lot more work in me yet.\"\n\nTremain was born in 1943 and had a difficult early life - her father walked out when she was 10. She worked in publishing and as a picture researcher before teaching creative writing at the University of East Anglia for seven years, until 1995.\n\nThough she'd always written stories, she was 33 before her first book was published. Her daughter, Ellie, 33, from her first marriage to Jon Tremain (whom she met while still studying at university), was once an actress but is now doing an MSc in psychotherapy. Her second marriage was to Jonathan Dudley, a theatre director.\n\nWith her first prize of £20,000 in 1989 (\"I was so poor at the time\"), Tremain bought a Honda Accord, the first new car she had owned, and helped a friend who was in financial difficulties.\n\nShe is unsure how the Orange money will be spent. \"But, for anyone creative, the lovely thing about being given bits of money is that it buys you more time.\"\n\n\"I don't know whether Americans are remotely interested in the story of an immigrant to Britain,\" she says, \"but they are very interested in prizes.\"\n\nDoes she see anything wrong with a women-only prize? \"All prizes exclude somebody, some group. If you look at what's happened this year - AL Kennedy wins the Costa prize, Anne Enright wins the Booker and Doris Lessing wins the Nobel. It's been a women's year. So I think we need to stop carping and celebrate it.\""
