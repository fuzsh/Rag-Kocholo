        "text": "I\n\nNot my best side, I’m afraid,\n\nThe artist didn’t give me a chance to\n\nPose properly, and as you can see,\n\nPoor chap, he had this obsession with\n\nTriangles, so he left off two of my\n\nFeet. I didn’t comment at the time\n\n(What, after all, are two feet\n\nTo a monster?) but afterwards\n\nI was sorry for the bad publicity.\n\nWhy, I said to myself, should my conqueror\n\nBe so ostentatiously beardless, and ride\n\nA horse with a deformed neck and square hoofs?\n\nWhy should my victim be so\n\nUnattractive as to be inedible,\n\nAnd why should she have me literally\n\nOn a string? I don’t mind dying\n\nRitually, since I always rise again,\n\nBut I should have liked a little more blood\n\nTo show they were taking me seriously.\n\nII\n\nIt’s hard for a girl to be sure if\n\nShe wants to be rescued. I mean, I quite\n\nTook to the dragon. It’s nice to be\n\nLiked, if you know what I mean. He was\n\nSo nicely physical, with his claws\n\nAnd lovely green skin, and that sexy tail,And the way he looked at me,\n\nHe made me feel he was all ready to\n\nEat me. And any girl enjoys that.\n\nSo when this boy turned up, wearing machinery,\n\nOn a really dangerous horse, to be honest\n\nI didn’t much fancy him. I mean,\n\nWhat was he like underneath the hardware?\n\nHe might have acne, blackheads or even\n\nBad breath for all I could tell, but the dragon–\n\nWell, you could see all his equipment\n\nAt a glance. Still, what could I do?\n\nThe dragon got himself beaten by the boy,\n\nAnd a girl’s got to think of her future.\n\nIII\n\nI have diplomas in Dragon\n\nManagement and Virgin Reclamation.\n\nMy horse is the latest model, with\n\nAutomatic transmission and built-in\n\nObsolescence. My spear is custom-built,\n\nAnd my prototype armour\n\nStill on the secret list. You can’t\n\nDo better than me at the moment.\n\nI’m qualified and equipped to the\n\nEyebrow. So why be difficult?\n\nDon’t you want to be killed and/or rescued\n\nIn the most contemporary way? Don’t\n\nYou want to carry out the roles\n\nThat sociology and myth have designed for you?\n\nDon’t you realize that, by being choosy,\n\nYou are endangering job prospects\n\nIn the spear- and horse-building industries?\n\nWhat, in any case, does it matter what\n\nYou want? You’re in my way.\n\nUrsula Askham Fanthorpe, CBE, FRSL 22 July 1929 – 28 April 2009). English poet."
