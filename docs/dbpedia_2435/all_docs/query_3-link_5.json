        "text": "Actor Imelda Staunton, Post Office campaigner Alan Bates and artist Tracey Emin were amongst those recognised in the 2024 King's Birthday Honours.\n\nThe awards typically celebrate the contribution of well-known personalities, government employees and ordinary people who have served their community.\n\nMr Johnson's controversial list, released in June 2023, initially contained eight names rejected by the House of Lords Appointments Commission, external.\n\nIt did not name the nominees but Mr Johnson's ally, former Tory MP Nadine Dorries, said \"sinister forces\" had stopped her receiving a peerage.\n\nMs Truss was widely criticised for submitting an honours list after only 49 days in the job. Her 11 nominations largely consisted of political supporters and former aides.\n\nWhen Parliament ends before a general election, dissolution honours are typically given to politicians.\n\nAfter the death of a senior member of the Royal Family, Royal Victorian Order honours are awarded to people who served the family.\n\nResignation or dissolution honours are decided by the prime minister and do not go through the same process.\n\nThe Foreign Office has responsibility for the Diplomatic Service and Overseas List. Honorary awards for foreign nationals are recommended by the foreign secretary.\n\nHonours are traditionally kept confidential until the official announcement, with lists provided to media outlets under embargo.\n\nBut a number of 2024 New Year honours' recipients issued their own embargoed press releases weeks in advance.\n\nPeople in line for an honour are checked by the Honours and Appointments Secretariat,, external which is part of the Cabinet Office government department.\n\nThe Cabinet Office has agreements with other government departments to let it access confidential information about nominees.\n\nFor example, HMRC provides a low, medium or high-risk rating, external on a nominee's tax affairs.\n\nPeerages are vetted by the House of Lords Appointments Commission. , external\n\nA Parliamentary and Political Services Committee considers honours for politicians and for political service.\n\nIn recent years, political donations made by some nominees, external have received scrutiny.\n\nKnights and Dames\n\nThe honour of knighthood comes from the days of medieval chivalry, as does the method used to confer the knighthood - the accolade, or the touch of a sword, by the sovereign.\n\nA knight is styled \"Sir\" and their wife \"Lady\".\n\nWomen receiving the honour are styled \"Dame\" but do not receive the accolade.\n\nThe honour is given for a pre-eminent contribution in any field of activity.\n\nThe rank of Knight Commander (KBE) or Dame Commander (DBE), Order of the British Empire, appears on the Diplomatic Service and Overseas list.\n\nThe Order of the Bath\n\nThe Order of the Bath is an order of chivalry and was founded in 1725 for service of the highest calibre.\n\nIt has a civil and military division and is awarded in the following ranks: Knight Grand Cross (GCB), Knight Commander (KCB) and Companion (CB).\n\nThe Order takes its name from the symbolic bathing which, in former times, was often part of the preparation of a candidate for knighthood.\n\nOrder of St Michael and St George\n\nThis Order was founded by King George III in 1818 and is awarded to British subjects who have rendered extraordinary and important services abroad or in the Commonwealth.\n\nRanks in the Order are Knight or Dame Grand Cross (GCMG), Knight or Dame Commander (KCMG or DCMG) and Companion (CMG).\n\nOrder of the Companions of Honour\n\nThis is awarded for service of conspicuous national importance and is limited to 65 people. Recipients are entitled to put the initials CH after their name.\n\nOrders of the British Empire\n\nKing George V created these honours during World War One to reward services to the war effort by civilians at home and service personnel in support positions.\n\nThe ranks are Commander (CBE), Officer (OBE), and Member (MBE).\n\nThey are now awarded for prominent national or regional roles, and to those making distinguished or notable contributions in their own specific areas of activity.\n\nBritish Empire Medal (BEM)\n\nThe medal was founded in 1917 and was awarded for \"meritorious\" actions by civilians or military personnel, although the recipients did not attend a royal investiture.\n\nScrapped in 1993 by Conservative Prime Minister John Major, the BEM was revived in 2012.\n\nRoyal Victorian Order\n\nBy 1896, prime ministers and governments had increased their influence over the distribution of awards and had gained almost total control of the system.\n\nIn response, Queen Victoria instituted The Royal Victorian Order as a personal award for services performed on behalf of the Royal Family.\n\nThe ranks are Knight or Dame Grand Cross (GCVO), Knight or Dame Commander (KCVO or DCVO), Commander (CVO), Lieutenant (LVO) and Member (MVO).\n\nRoyal Victorian Medal\n\nAssociated with the Royal Victorian Order is the Royal Victorian Medal which has three grades: gold, silver and bronze. The circular medal is attached to the ribbon of the Order.\n\nRoyal Red Cross\n\nFounded in 1883 by Queen Victoria, the award is confined to the nursing services. Those awarded the First Class are designated \"Members\" (RRC): those awarded the Second Class are designated \"Associates\" (ARRC).\n\nKing's Police Medal\n\nAwarded for distinguished service in the police force.\n\nKing's Fire Service Medal\n\nGiven to firefighters who have displayed conspicuous devotion to duty.\n\nKing's Ambulance Service Medal\n\nAwarded for distinguished service in the ambulance service.\n\nKing's Gallantry Medal\n\nAwarded to civilians, for acts of exemplary bravery.\n\nKing's Commendation for Bravery\n\nAwarded to civilians and all ranks of the British armed forces, for actions not in the presence of an enemy.\n\nKing's Commendation for Bravery in the Air\n\nAwarded to civilians and all ranks of the British armed forces, for acts of bravery in the air not in the presence of an enemy."
