        "text": "Praiseworthy by Alexis Wright has won the A$60,000 (about US$39,600) Stella Prize, honoring the best writing by Australian women. (The novel was published by New Directions in the U.S. in February.)\n\nOrganizers said, \"Fierce and gloriously funny, Praiseworthy is a genre-defiant epic of climate catastrophe proportions. Part manifesto, part indictment, Alexis Wright's real-life frustration at the indignities of the Anthropocene stalk the pages of this, her fourth novel.\n\n\"That frustration is embodied by a methane-like haze over the once-tidy town of Praiseworthy. The haze catalyses the quest of protagonist Cause Man Steel. His search for a platinum donkey, muse for a donkey-transport business, is part of a farcical get-rich-quick scheme to capitalise on the new era of heat. Cause seeks deliverance for himself and his people to the blue-sky country of economic freedom.\n\n\"Praiseworthy belies its elegy-like form to stand firm in the author's Waanyi worldview and remind us that this is not the end times for that or any Country. Instead it asks, which way my people? Which way humanity?\"\n\nA member of the Waanyi nation of the southern highlands of the Gulf of Carpentaria, Wright is the first person to win the Stella Prize twice. In 2018, she won for Tracker, a collective memoir of Aboriginal leader Tracker Tilmouth. She has also written the novels Carpentaria (winner of the Miles Franklin Award in 2007), Plains of Promise, and The Swan Book and the nonfiction works Take Power and Grog War.\n\n---"
