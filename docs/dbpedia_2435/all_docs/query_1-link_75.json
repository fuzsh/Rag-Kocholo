Immersed in the breathtaking expanse of a panoramic mountain range, Rice has a relationship with nature most people dream of.

Originally from Bulgaria, Chakarova traveled to the United States at just thirteen years old, later obtaining a Bachelor of Fine Arts in photography from the San Francisco Art Institute and a Masters of Arts in visual studies from UC Berkeley.
