        "text": "Carrie Fisher, born on October 21, 1956, in Beverly Hills, California, was an iconic figure in the entertainment industry who left a lasting imprint on both cinema and literature. She was a multifaceted talent: an actress, writer, and humorist, best known for her role as Princess Leia in the Star Wars franchise. Fisher was the daughter of renowned Hollywood actress Debbie Reynolds and singer Eddie Fisher, making her entry into show business almost inevitable. Fisher's acting career took off in 1975 with her debut in the Broadway revival of Irene. However, it was her role in George Lucas's epic space opera Star Wars in 1977 that catapulted her to international fame. Her portrayal of the fearless Princess Leia Organa, a character she reprised in several sequels and spin-offs, became a pop culture phenomenon. Despite her success on screen, Fisher also faced personal challenges, including struggles with substance abuse and bipolar disorder, which she openly discussed in various interviews and writings. Apart from her acting prowess, Fisher was a gifted writer. She penned several semi-autobiographical novels, including the bestseller Postcards from the Edge, which was later adapted into a film starring Meryl Streep. She also established herself as one of Hollywood's top script doctors, polishing scripts for popular films such as Sister Act and The Wedding Singer. Fisher's candidness about her personal life, combined with her sharp wit and insightful commentary, made her a beloved figure far beyond her iconic Star Wars role.\n\nAyn Rand (; born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum; February 2 [O.S. January 20] 1905 â€“ March 6, 1982) was a Russian-American writer and philosopher. She is known for her two best-selling novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, and for developing a philosophical system she named Objectivism. Educated in Russia, she moved to the United States in 1926. She had a play produced on Broadway in 1935 and 1936. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, The Fountainhead. In 1957, Rand published her best-known work, the novel Atlas Shrugged. Afterward, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982. Rand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism and rejected altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism, instead supporting laissez-faire capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights, including property rights. In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas and classical liberals.Literary critics received Rand's fiction with mixed reviews and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest has increased in recent decades. The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings. She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives.\n\nJ.K. Rowling, born as Joanne Rowling in 1965, is a renowned British author and philanthropist, globally recognized for her creation of the 'Harry Potter' series. Her journey from penning down stories on restaurant napkins to becoming one of the most successful authors in the world is nothing short of phenomenal. Raised in Gloucestershire, England, Rowling's early life was filled with books, laying the foundation for her future literary pursuits. Rowling's most distinguished work, the 'Harry Potter' series, began as a simple idea during a delayed train ride from Manchester to London in 1990. However, it took seven years marked by personal challenges, including the loss of her mother, birth of her first child, and a divorce, before the first book, 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone', made its debut in 1997. The series, comprised of seven books, garnered incredible popularity worldwide, translated into multiple languages, and inspiring a successful eight-part film franchise. It is estimated that the series has sold over 500 million copies, making it one of the best-selling book series in history. Outside her literary career, Rowling is celebrated for her philanthropic work. She founded the Volant Charitable Trust in 2000, which focuses on alleviating social deprivation, particularly among women and children. Furthermore, she co-founded Lumos, a non-profit organization committed to ending the institutionalization of children worldwide. Despite the remarkable success and fame, J.K. Rowling remains a profound example of resilience, and her story continues to inspire aspiring authors across the globe.\n\nDanielle Fernandes Dominique Schuelein-Steel (born August 14, 1947) is an American writer, best known for her romance novels. She is the bestselling author alive and the fourth bestselling fiction author of all time, with over 800 million copies sold. She has written 179 books, including over 146 novels.Based in California for most of her career, Steel has produced several books a year, often juggling up to five projects at once. Despite \"a resounding lack of critical acclaim\" (Publishers Weekly), all her novels have been bestsellers, including those issued in hardback. Her formula is fairly consistent, often involving rich families facing a crisis, threatened by dark elements such as prison, fraud, blackmail and suicide. Steel has also published children's fiction and poetry, as well as raising funds for the treatment of mental disorders. Her books have been translated into 43 languages, with 22 adapted for television, including two that have received Golden Globe nominations."
