He worked for Barclays Bank from 1974-83 and became an Associate of the Chartered Institute of Bankers in 1976. He obtained an MBA at The Management College, Henley in 1979. He became a stockbroker with W Greenwell & Co in 1984 and was the top-rated bank analyst in London from 1984-89. In 1990 he became head of UK Company Research at UBS Phillips & Drew, a position from which he was dismissed in 1992 following the publication of his best selling book Accounting for Growth. He joined Collins Stewart shortly after, and became a director in 1996. In 2000 he became Chief Executive and led the management buy-out of Collins Stewart, which was floated on the London Stock Exchange five months later. In 2003 Collins Stewart acquired Tullett Liberty, the world's second largest inter-dealer broker and followed this in 2004 with the acquisition of Prebon Group. Collins Stewart and Tullett Prebon were demerged in 2006. Overall to date more than Â£2bn of shareholder value has been created by these companies.\n\nSupporters\n\nOrganisations\n\nBattle of Britain Fighter Association\n\nBattle of Britain Historical Society\n\nBentley Priory Battle of Britain Trust\n\nThe Royal New Zealand Air Force Association\n\nThe Battle of Britain Memorial Trust\n\nAircrew Association\n\nThe Caledonian Club\n\nLincoln Aero Club\n\nNorth Coates Flying Club\n\nBiggin Hill Airport\n\nThe Real Aeroplane Club\n\nShepherd Neame Brewery\n\nKemble Airport\n\nLincolnshire Aviation Heritage Centre\n\nThe Shuttleworth Trust\n\nNewark Air Museum\n\nNorth Weald Airfield\n\nLondon City Airport\n\nRAF Waddington\n\nNorfolk Gliding Club\n\nCompton Abbas Airfield\n\nWickenby Aerodrome LLP\n\nSpeke Aerodrome\n\nRAF Fairford\n\nThe Wirral Show\n\nThe Spitfire Society"
