So begins Mary's heroic struggle to change gender. In this book, her story begins from the rural community of the 1950s to London in the Sixties, and beyond to the glitter of America in the Seventies.\n\nFrom the author of The Gustav Sonata\n\nAt the age of six, Mary Ward, the child of a poor farming family in Suffolk, has a revelation: 'I am not Mary.
