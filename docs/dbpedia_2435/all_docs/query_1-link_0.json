        "text": "At the age of 11, while at boarding school, Rose Tremain experienced an epiphany. \"I remember standing in the middle of a very beautiful hayfield with the sun going down and thinking that I didn't want just to describe how beautiful I thought that place was but I wanted to write down all my feelings about it, and then try to make some equation between that place and what I felt about it and what hopes I had for my own life. I can remember the intensity of it . . . and it seemed to me then that my life would be a life in which this process of describing and identifying feelings would play a part.\"\n\nThe author of three collections of short stories and nine novels, the latest of which, The Colour, is published this month, knew then that she was a writer, although she didn't publish any fiction until she was 33. The stories she wrote in her 20s were rejected by the literary magazines she sent them to, and her first novel, Sadler's Birthday (1976), which describes the reminiscences of a retired butler, had done the rounds as well by the time it landed on the desk of a young editor at Macdonald and Jane's. \"I remember feeling utterly thrilled when I read it,\" says Penelope Hoare, who has been Tremain's editor ever since. \"It was so unlike most people's first novels, in the sense that it didn't seem to be in the least bit autobiographical.\"\n\n\"A lot of writers start from the premise of their own lives,\" Tremain says, in the large sitting room of her home on the outskirts of Norwich. \"There's this old adage which I used to try to get my students to ignore - write about what you know, because then your characters and stories will be inhabited. But invention is really the clue to everything.\"\n\nTremain's parents both died in 2001. Her mother Viola, known as Jane, was the least favourite child of parents who lost two sons (one to illness, one in the second world war). \"All her life [she] had to fight against the notion of her own unlovability,\" Tremain wrote in a recent newspaper article. Tremain's grandparents were well off, and her own childhood was split between a \"rather ordinary\" London home and holidays in the country house where they kept servants.\n\nHer father, Keith Thomson, a failed playwright, walked out on the family when she was 10, losing contact with Rose and her older sister Joanna for many years. \"I think there's a creative gene in my family, and it's from my father's side. I think that sometimes when somebody succeeds at something there's one parent who's tried to do it, who's got so far with it and then had to give it up or perhaps wasn't that good at it,\" Tremain says. For much of her adult life the relationship troubled her, but around 10 years ago, when she met her current partner, the biographer Richard Holmes, she decided to let it go. \"There was some jealousy [from my father] of what little success I was having. It was horrible, and it troubled me that my own father could feel these things . . . There was nothing I could do about it, there was nothing I could change and I decided there was no point grieving. You can make decisions to change your external landscape and I think you can make decisions to change your internal landscape as well. I'd said quite enough about it, it had plagued my life, so I decided not to concern myself anymore.\"\n\nRosemary Jane Thomson - she became Rose when she was about 16 - was born in London on August 2 1943. She attended Francis Holland, a private girls' school, but when her mother remarried, to a cousin of her first husband called Ivo Thomson, who was joint owner of the Yorkshire Post, the family moved to Berkshire. Rose was sent to boarding school at Crofton Grange, Hertfordshire, and acquired a stepbrother, Mark, now an investment banker.\n\nShe says, \"It had all the horrors of boarding school - it was very cold and the food was disgusting. But the good thing about being sent away to school is that there's a lot of what I would call dead time. You had to really use your own resources and what some of us did was to write our own plays and put them on. We starred in them, made the costumes, made the scenery, and it was thrilling.\"\n\nShe began to write stories and to paint, like her sister Jo, who went on to work as an artist before she married and had six children. \"We had a lovely teacher called Miss Robinson, whom we knew as Robbie. She was beautiful in a rather decayed way and had never married and we made up stories about how she'd had this fiance who'd been killed in the war. She said to me one day 'I think the English room is looking a bit dull - what about doing some murals?' So I spent a lot of time in my last year when I should have been revising doing a Michelangelo, lying on a ladder facing the ceiling.\"\n\nSent to a Paris finishing school by her Francophile mother for a year before university, Tremain enrolled at the Sorbonne instead, where she took a diploma in the Cours de Civilisation Française. She has retained an enthusiasm for France ever since, speaking the language, setting stories and novels there and earning a large French readership. In 1994 she spent several months in Paris with Holmes, a stay he has described as \"an extended and secret honeymoon\". \"The French interviewers always want to know if I am Kirsten Munk [the sexually voracious king's consort in Music and Silence ],\" Tremain says. \"Of course I tell them 'yes'.\"\n\nAfter Paris she studied English at the new University of East Anglia, where she was taught by Angus Wilson. On graduating, she read film scripts for a while, before taking a full-time position as a teacher at a boys' prep school in Hampstead. Her first writing job was unglamorous: a short illustrated history of the suffrage movement for a part-work publisher she had joined as a sub-editor. She later wrote a book about Stalin in the same series, published by Ballantine. \"I wasn't paid much money for that but I owe it a great debt because I thought 'if I can write 30,000 words maybe I can write 60,000 words,'\" she says.\n\nIn 1971, afraid that her mother would disapprove, she secretly married Jon Tremain, her boyfriend from university. Their daughter, Eleanor, was born a year later. Jon had trained as a teacher before moving into IT, and they set up home in a dilapidated Suffolk farmhouse. East Anglia has remained her home ever since, and its flat, wide landscapes have become a distinctive feature of her fiction. But in 1976, the year her first novel was published, the couple separated, and two years later Rose took the opportunity of a year's fellowship at Essex University to give up her part-time job as a picture researcher for British History Illustrated and commit herself to writing full-time.\n\nUnusually for a young writer, her early novels were much concerned with older people. Letter to Sister Benedicta (1979), which followed Sadler's Birthday, is told from the point of view of a disappointed middle-aged solicitor's wife, while The Cupboard (1981) recounts the life story of an 87-year-old novelist who is close to death. They were well received, and in 1983 Tremain was chosen, alongside Ian McEwan, Martin Amis, Salman Rushdie, Julian Barnes and Pat Barker, among others, as one of Granta's Best Young British Novelists.\n\nIn her fiction Tremain approached her subjects from unexpected angles, concentrating her attention on unglamorous outsiders. Like Kazuo Ishiguro in The Remains of the Day, she chose the servant's perspective from which to write about the life of an English country house. But in 1989, with Restoration, came a decisive break. Tremain remembers that it was taking her longer to get started on a new novel than previously. \"I think something happened then and I think it has to do with scope - with not wanting to be narrowly domestic.\" Restoration was set in the 1660s, and described the picaresque adventures of a courtier to Charles II. Nominated for the Booker prize, it brought Tremain more publicity and many new readers. Not all the critics, though, were convinced. Reviewing Restoration in this newspaper, Christina Konig complained that she had been left \"with the uncomfortable feeling that the whole thing has been an exercise in style, an excuse for fancy-dress histrionics\".\n\nIn 1999 Tremain returned to the 17th century with Music and Silence, the story of an English lutenist at the Danish court of King Christian IV. Although Sacred Country (1992) and the Way I Found Her (1997) were both set in the 20th century, and dealt with such contemporary issues as transexuality, crime and divorce, Tremain's new novel, The Colour, looks like cementing her reputation as a costume dramatist: \"the best historical novelist of her generation\" (taken from a review that appeared in the Daily Mail) is emblazoned across its dustjacket.\n\nThe setting of The Colour is New Zealand, during the 1860s gold rush. Its principals are a recently married English couple whose early efforts at farming founder when the husband becomes intoxicated by his first sight of gold. Tremain says \"I stumbled on the relics of the gold rush when in New Zealand in 2000 at the Wellington Festival; there's a little museum with the artefacts of the gold rush in Arrowtown - the tools, the hobnailed boots, the pans. I was really moved by the idea that people set out to change their lives with these very basic tools.\"\n\nTremain is aware that she may be accused of getting it wrong. \"I think what happens is that I start out with an obligation to learn as much as I can, and then it goes through this other process. Because it's impossible from this distance in history to know everything, I don't think you should deny yourself the opportunity to imagine - the test is, does the reader of this book believe in these characters? What I strive for in my books is the landscape and the mental landscape that take the reader somewhere else.\"\n\nIn a review of Music and Silence for the New York Review of Books, the critic John Bayley contrasted Tremain with Walter Scott and suggested that hers is \"a purely feminine form of history . . . her purpose seems to be to use the past as a convenience for her own peculiar brand of literary intimacy: in short, to de- historicise the historical novel\". Music and Silence won the Whitbread Novel of the Year award and has sold more than 200,000 copies in paperback. But it did not make the 1999 Booker shortlist, despite having been tipped as a possible winner. Writing in the Independent that year, Natasha Walter, one of the judges, damned with faint praise as \"nice\", \"fine\", \"professional and entertaining\" those women writers who have taken to setting their books in the past: Pat Barker, Michèle Roberts, Ahdaf Soueif and Deborah Moggach among them. \"Can all this pretty detail substitute for the vigour of real imaginative engagement with a novelist's own times?\" she asked.\n\n\"The term 'historical novel' implies that the action comes first - creaking decks, funny costumes,\" says poet laureate Andrew Motion, who recently published a novel based on the life of Keats. \"And we do get some of that in her books, but it's not the most important thing. I think what is interesting about her is that she manages to make good stories, ripping yarns in the case of The Colour, stories which in purely narrative terms wouldn't look out of place in the middle of the 19th century, but when we read them we realise that she's up to something more ingenious than that, more modern, self-reflexive and complicated. She takes bold narrative ingredients and subtleises them. So we're having a good time in an old-fashioned sense but also being made to think about things. I think that's the secret of her popular success.\"\n\nTremain has judged the Booker prize twice, in 1988 and 2000, and makes no secret of the fact that she would love to win it. When Beryl Bainbridge's name is mentioned - shortlisted five times but never a winner - Tremain laughs. \"I haven't even really been the bridesmaid,\" she says, \"I'd settle for being the bridesmaid.\"\n\n\"Certain juries feel this same hoary thing - that if it's historical it isn't somehow relevant to our own lives and that only what is narrowly contemporary is worthy of a prize,\" she continues. \"One of the reasons why contemporary Britain is difficult to write about is that it feels as though there is no untrodden path, no original way in.\" An admirer of American fiction, Tremain says \"I think if I were American I'd find it much easier. The complexity of America means that even so late in the day there are still sort of tracts of the American mind and the American landscape which feel unexplored . . . there is this vastness to it, this feeling of it still being an elsewhere, that I think is very liberating.\"\n\nAlthough in her fiction psychological and existential questions about, in King Christian's phrase, \"how to be in the world\" can appear more pressing, Tremain has strong views about changing social attitudes as well. She says she is interested in contentment, \"the will to accept a small, monotonous life\", versus materialism and competitiveness.\"I grew up in the 60s and I was really dismayed when the Thatcher mindset came along, but I also found it very difficult to write about it, so I went searching for some other time in history that might be a mirror, or a parallel . . . After the [English] civil war and the interregnum which were years characterised by obedience to God, by everybody being in their place, there is this great explosion. The Thames [which had frozen] explodes back into life, the theatres reopen, dress is absolutely transformed - that's what Restoration was about, though probably nobody realised.\"\n\nHer characters are hungry for power, money, sex, but susceptible too to love and loneliness: \"I am erratic, immoderate, boastful and sad,\" is how Robert Merivel, the narrator of Restoration , introduces himself. Many are preoccupied with the strange and the marvellous, and influenced by powerful dreams: inventions are a recurring motif, while Mary Ward in Sacred Country practises conjuring tricks. Everyone is longing for something, and their fervent wishes propel the stories along. Thirteen-year-old Lewis Little in The Way I Found Her is infatuated with the novelist whose latest book his mother is translating: \"the thing I wanted to do most in the world was to lick all the creamy lipstick off Valentina's lips.\" Joseph Blackstone in The Colour is overcome by his lust for gold and fearful too of women's longing, \"so tenacious that it could lead you to behaviour you had never imagined yourself capable of\". Mary Ward yearns for her own transformation: \"anything she prayed for would certainly happen. In particular, becoming a boy would happen. It was just a question of time, a question of waiting until you could invent yourself and surprise everyone with your discovery\".\n\nTremain has written in the first and third persons, in the voices of men and women and several children - she wonders aloud if the boys in her two most recent novels are imaginary versions of the son she never had. Motion says \"I think her treatment of men and women is very even-handed. I don't feel as I sometimes do reading books by women that this is not for me, that it doesn't include me, perhaps doesn't even want to include me.\" Her first novel included an account of a man's sexual relationship with an 11-year-old boy; since then she has described incest, sado-masochism and, in her new novel, a botched abortion and anal rape. Ian McEwan says, \"My own taste has been for taking things to the edge and I sympathise with writers who want to do that. Such writing generates a different drumbeat in the prose, and I guess Rose responds to that call. Also, writers who push to the extremes, if they're English, are usually reacting against a prevailing social realism of the English novel.\"\n\nIn person Tremain is tall and elegant, sharp but not severe. She speaks fluently about her writing, and says she has learned to enjoy audiences at public events and literary festivals. A tutor on the University of East Anglia's creative writing MA course from 1988 to 1995, where Andrew Miller, Tracy Chevalier and Erica Wagner were among her students, she says she would have tried to get on the course herself if it had existed when she graduated, and remains a firm believer in its benefits. \"It's so lonely trying to be a writer, starting out. Nobody knows about your stuff, nobody is waiting for it. You think 'I'm a writer' but actually you can't call yourself a writer because you haven't done anything. But the minute you come on to the course you're treated as a writer and your loneliness disappears.\n\n\"There were some dramatic moments - people lying on the floor weeping, a lot of door-slamming. I instituted a tea break which has become hallowed,\" she says. But she felt that seven years was enough. \"Writing is a strange synthesis between these two parts of your mind: the analytical side and the side that knows nothing at all, and you have to allow the dreaming side free rein. What I'm writing gets into my dreams and it gets into how I feel when I wake up in the morning. I think there used to be a greater separation between what I was writing about and my life, and now the two have crossed over which probably gives me this feeling of still having a lot to say.\"\n\nFormer student Andrew Miller says he found her slightly intimidating, \"probably because I was rather unsure about everything myself then. What was good about her was that she was the real thing, I knew that much, and also that she expected us to take responsibility for what we put down. She's a tough-minded character, who has very high standards herself, and she wasn't looking to make things too easy for us. She seems much more relaxed these days. The last time I met her was at the Booker dinner [Miller was shortlisted for Oxygen in 2001] when she called me over and said 'this is your last ever tutorial. You can fret about not winning this for two days and then you've got to forget about it.'\"\n\nTremain describes William Golding as an influence on her own work. She has also written of her admiration for Gabriel Garcia Marquez's 1967 classic One Hundred Years of Solitude, and the trace of magical realism is apparent in her vivid imagery: Music and Silence took her evocation of the cold, dark wine cellar in which the king's musicians work as its starting-point. Critics, including Christina Konig, have complained of the \"freight of symbolism\" in Tremain's work, but her intense, metaphorical prose has many admirers. McEwan says, \"I think she's a true stylist, which is surprisingly rare. In other words she's a writer who cares about her novels at the level of the sentence.\"\n\nIn 1982 Tremain married for the second time. Jonathan Dudley was a theatre director who later taught management theory, and a cousin on her mother's side whom she had known since childhood. He had two sons from a previous relationship, and with Rose's daughter Eleanor, who is now an actress, they formed a family of five. But they drifted apart, and in 1992 Tremain travelled to the Adelaide book festival with Holmes. \"We'd both been on our own for perhaps just over a year, and we were both probably resigned to it,\" she says. \"I thought I'd reached a point where my life was quite manageable so it was a surprise to fall in love again, but we did and that was amazing. I think emotional things often happen like that, when you least expect it.\"\n\nA muddle about the tickets meant Holmes had to meet her at Heathrow, and there were various telephone conversations. \"I said 'how will we recognise each other?' and he said the sweetest thing: 'I am bald and bespectacled and I will be foolishly smiling' and I thought that was such a lovely sentence that I probably fell in love with him then.\"\n\nSo does she believe in happy endings? \"The one I had the greatest dilemma about was Music and Silence. It was a knife-edge: there was a moment when I thought 'this story is going to end like Romeo and Juliet - they're just going to miss. Emilia is going to lay herself down under the trees, take her pot of poison, and then Peter Claire is going to come riding by.' But I couldn't bear it.\" More usually, there is grief as well as celebration. There are deaths in all Tremain's books, an assortment of physical and mental illnesses, moments of painful disappointment and rejection. \"I'm a person of great contrasts. I think I have a deep melancholy side, probably in common with all writers because it's an introverted way to spend one's time,\" she says. Friends refer to her lively sense of humour. \"I love the combination of something which is funny and also which is absolutely heartbreaking, both at the same time. I've never read a sentence of hers that hasn't either moved or amused me,\" says Penelope Hoare, while McEwan describes her as \"immensely wry and fun to talk to\".\n\nAs for her fiction, Tremain says, \"What the reader longs for is to embark on a journey. If you're remotely attached to the characters you want them to overcome the things that are worrying them, you want them to escape from whatever it is they want to escape from, or to find whatever it is they want to find. I think people feel - I've certainly felt in my life - that there were moments when my life seemed to be moving backwards and one doesn't want this to happen.\"\n\nHaving been bitterly disappointed by the Hollywood version of Restoration, which won two Oscars in 1995 for its lavish costumes and designs but, she felt, lacked a coherent storyline, Tremain is writing her own screenplay for a film version of The Way I Found Her. Watching hailstones come down on the beautiful garden which slopes away from the house she has lived in since 1985, she says \"Time is catching up with me now. I'm 60 in August and this looming birthday has made me think. My life seems to have gone by so fast I can't believe it, but I don't believe it's over. I feel full of ideas and power.\"\n\nRose Tremain, nee Rosemary Jane Thomson\n\nBorn: August 2 1943, London\n\nEducated Crofton Grange School '54-'61; the Sorbonne, '61-'62; University of East Anglia '62-'65\n\nNovels: Sadler's Birthday '76; Letter to Sister Benedicta '79; The Cupboard '81; The Swimming Pool Season '85; Restoration '89; Sacred Country '92; The Way I Found Her '97; Music and Silence '99; The Colour '2003\n\nShort story collections: The Colonel's Daughter and other stories '83; The Garden of the Villa Mollini and other stories '87; Evangelista's Fan and other stories '94\n\nFor children: Journey to the Volcano '85\n\nFor radio: Temporary Shelter '85; Who was Emily Davison?
