The Times\n\nHow do you find the courage to make your own life? Absolutely and Forever is an electrifying novel about first love set in 1960s London.\n\nMarianne is fifteen when she falls helplessly in love with Simon. Simon owns a Morris Minor, is in his final year at school and has a dazzling future ahead of him. Desperate to escape the stifling 1950s suburbs she has been raised in, Marianne feels sure she will be able to find true happiness with him.\n\nHowever a twist of fate sees Simon’s glittering future dashed and with it Marianne’s dreams. He flees the country and Marianne, realising she will have to make a life of her own, moves to London determined to reinvent herself. But Marianne cannot let go of that first all-encompassing love, while Simon is in Paris, nursing a secret that will alter everything.\n\nGorgeous. Observer * Profoundly moving. Financial Times *\n\nRose Tremain‘s novels and short stories have won many awards, including the Orange Prize (The Road Home), the Dylan Thomas Award (The Colonel’s Daughter and Other Stories), the Whitbread Novel of the Year (Music & Silence) the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the Prix Femina in France (Sacred Country) and the South Bank Sky Arts Award (The Gustav Sonata).
