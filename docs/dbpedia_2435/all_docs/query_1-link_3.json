        "text": "A press release from Fantastic Books: What kind of siding do you need to protect your house from werewolves? Would you kill someone to prevent them from committing suicide? What would you say to him if you met Dr. Frankenstein? Imagine building a clockwork god‚Ä¶ that truly is God. How many times can you execute a mass murderer? What is a goddess to do when her worshippers abandon her for another? Could you carry out a death sentence yourself? If you were the last person on Earth, would you know it? Forget ‚Äúraised by wolves.‚Äù What about the boy raised by birds? It‚Äôs a hard life for the man who is always second. Imagine a world where nothing dies. Nothing. What would a zombie have to do to prove his status as undead? In these Disturbing Stories, Ron Miller answers (or in some cases, asks) questions that will make you look at the world differently, and not necessarily from a position of comfort. ‚ÄúRon Miller has the rare gift of being a visionary in two ways: a superb imaginative artist who is also a fine storyteller. I‚Äôve been an admirer of his paintings for many years; what a pleasure it is to discover that his short stories are just as wonderful. Disturbing Stories is a terrific collection; read this book, by all means.‚Äù ‚ÄîAllen Steele, three-time Hugo Award-winner Disturbing Stories by Ron Miller $15.99, 268 pages, trade paperback, ISBN: 978-1-5154-5821-0 Fantastic Books is pleased to be publishing Disturbing Stories on June 11, 2024. Review copies are available upon request. https://lnkd.in/eDnuJAYy\n\nBLURBüåº The classic teen novel from bestselling and iconic author Judy Blume, now celebrating it's 50th anniversary. Over nine million copies sold worldwide. Meet Margaret. She's going through all the same things most teenage girls have to face; fitting in, friendship and first bras. Life isn't easy for Margaret. She's moved away from her childhood home, she's starting a new school... REVIEWüí´üí´üí´üí´üí´ LANG- ENGLISH FORMAT- PAPERBACK How does it feel when you are new to a place? I still remember my first day at school. I stared, crying, after the teacher instructed me to write a few lines in cursive. I knew the pattern of writing but was late to submit my answer script. Such were the reasons. After that, it was all good with everyone out there. But fitting into a space that was unknown to me actually made me feel frustrated. I was not sure whom to call or share thoughts with some particular person. Margaret also finds it difficult when everyone is new to her. She understands and accepts the fact that everything can't be told to a friend. But she finds someone in whom she can confide. Chapter two talks of a kissing scene where Nancy is curious to know what is happening behind such an act. Talking about city girls and asking her about her first kiss are some things that actually relate quite well with the contemporary talk that people normally do. Margaret asks if Nancy is aking a real kiss on the lip. Then, Nacny assures that it is what she is actually saying. Thus, the momentum for discussion rises at many meetings and events. üìåWhy is God?Is thiss the God that Maragret confides in? Any guesses? RATINGS- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5"
