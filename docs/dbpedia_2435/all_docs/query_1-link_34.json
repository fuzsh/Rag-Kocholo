        "text": "My older two children are getting, well, a bit older.\n\nThis school year, one of my intentional goals is to help them become more independent in ensuring their daily tasks are complete.\n\nThe tool I'm using to help do that is this Catholic planner for kids. (It's on sale BTW)\n\nMy liturgical-year loving son and my pretty-stationary loving daughter have both eagerly embraced this format. Although, I am certain, their enthusiasm will fade once the pages are filled with actual *gasps* work.\n\nBut no matter. I'm relishing their cooperation right now. My hope is that, even when the sparkle fades, this will help them cultivate the habits of attention, organization, and self-motivation.\n\nFor each day, I plan on listing their individual daily school work and chores (I'll likely do this the evening before). For example:\n\nPray\n\nBed, clothes, teeth, hair\n\nFeed the cat\n\nMath\n\nPhonics\n\nRead for 30 minutes\n\nCopywork\n\nPractice instrument\n\nTidy toys\n\nThey can keep this running list close by throughout the day, hopefully relieving the many \"Mom, what do I need to do next?\" questions.\n\nI will check in throughout the day to ensure they've completed everything necessary.\n\nThis will also help them learn time management and to be a self-starter (super helpful when our life involves many interruptions due to little ones).\n\nThey will love the feast days and liturgical colors listed each day. They're enjoying learning about new Saints, so the monthly space for that will be great.\n\nI'm excited about fostering these habits that they'll need their whole lifelong.\n\nI'm grateful for a beautiful Catholic student planner to help them do that.\n\nMostly, I'm looking forward to them learning how everything about their days—education, work, fun, and rest—are under the care of the Father and lived in rhythm with Holy Mother Church.\n\nWhat habit(s) are you hoping to cultivate in your children this school year? Let me know in the comments so I can cheer you on!\n\nContinue reading\n\nSelf-discipline is key to success in our endeavors and for our sanity. Particularly in the long haul of motherhood, self-discipline protects priority and peace.\n\nSelf-discipline is a habit. In fact, it is the foundation of habit formation. Whole books can and have been written on self-discipline. Here, I would like to look at self-discipline in the life of the homemaker in three areas:\n\nthe heart\n\nthe will\n\nthe life\n\nThe Heart\n\nWe can stay stuck in our emotions when it comes to self-discipline. Sometimes there’s a lot of shame around the idea.\n\nThe Holy Spirit can use our emotions to convict us. He pricks our conscience. But there is a big difference between:\n\n\"I notice that when I scroll on my phone right after I wake up instead of praying, I’m much less patient with the kids’ needs.\"\n\nand\n\n\"I’m always cranky with the kids in the morning, the worst mother, and I’m probably just screwing them up.\"\n\nOne thought is the conviction that spurs us to the right action; the other is condemnation that leads us to despair and low-level comfort-seeking.\n\nWhen we spiral like this, we tend to focus more on the circumstances rather than our interior lives.\n\nBut the heart is precisely where we must begin.\n\nWhatever your external circumstances, the Lord sees the heart. This is paramount in the life of the mother because our seasons shift often and dramatically. Self-discipline in one season will look different from self-discipline in another.\n\nWe must be more attached to Jesus than our schedules.\n\nWe must listen to His voice over self-condemnation.\n\nWe must ask Him to cast the vision for self-discipline in this season rather than the latest Reel promising to enhance our morning routine. Resources can help, but not more than the Holy Spirit.\n\nIf our goals for self-discipline are not a fruit of prayer we will likely end up defeated or self-reliant.\n\nSo before we address any other areas, we should ask the Lord for His wisdom and vision for this season of our lives.\n\nAnd if we want to grow in self-discipline, let’s ask Him for help!\n\nThe Will\n\nAs we allow the Lord to transform our hearts and clarify our vision, He is going to give us opportunities to practice! After all, we grow in virtue by doing things consistently and intentionally.\n\nOnce the Holy Spirit has shown you how to grow in self-discipline this particular season, focus your energy there. We all-or-nothing types often hear the Holy Spirit’s marching order for one step forward, then go blazing into the full battlefield.\n\nThe exercise of the will is an interesting point of reflection for the stay-at-home or homeschooling mom. We have a lot of freedom. We set the schedule. We make the appointments. We discern levels of involvement. We are the CEO, the manager, the cook, and the janitor.\n\nThis freedom is so good. It is partly why homemakers have a particular duty to preserve leisure in our culture (but that’s another email for another time).\n\nThis freedom also presents unique considerations. After all, if we make the schedule and the rules, then we can say there is no schedule and there are no rules, right?\n\nA piece of our self-discipline as homemakers is identifying the priorities of this season and being sure we steward our time and energy well.\n\nHow do we do that? Let’s look at some practical ideas.\n\nThe Life\n\nPlanning\n\nI mentioned it above, but a significant step in self-discipline is getting very clear about your priorities.\n\nThe Lord has been teaching me about this a lot this summer. He has given me my assignment in this season. When I cease hemming and hawing about it, looking to my right and left, I have much more peace.\n\nIt is worth taking this to deep, extensive prayer. It is worth sitting down with our spouses and reviewing the priorities of the season. And it is worth structuring our lives around the assignment.\n\nBoundaries\n\nBoundaries look different for different people, personality types, needs, seasons, and vocations. But they are important!\n\nOnce we have identified our priorities, it might be necessary to put some boundaries in place to ensure those priorities are nurtured as needed.\n\nFor example, one boundary I have set this year is protecting our school time in ways I have not done in the past. Unless otherwise impossible, I am not scheduling kids’ appointments during our blocked school times. I’m not taking meetings. I place my phone on “Do Not Disturb\" and put it away.\n\nNotice that this is a boundary I’ve set for myself. No one is demanding that I have a dentist appointment at 9 a.m. or that I answer their text message immediately. But I know myself well enough to recognize this is a necessary boundary to protect the priority.\n\nFlexibility + Fortitude\n\nIt requires self-discipline to make a plan and set boundaries, and it requires self-discipline when it all goes to pot.\n\nAs mothers, we must be flexible because there will be hiccups. Things will regularly not go according to plan. Ideals are often massacred by toddlers and teenagers.\n\nThese are further opportunities to exercise self-discipline. We get to discipline our minds. How will we respond? Will we throw up our hands in resentful surrender (I have no idea what that’s about. Never done that before.)? Or will we face pivots with fortitude, doing the best we can and giving the rest to God?\n\nLongevity\n\nThe last point I’ll make on the topic of self-discipline for mothers is that we must accept the Lord’s grace and realize that we are in a marathon.\n\nSometimes self-discipline looks like true self-care. Maybe it’s going to bed earlier instead of watching one more episode so you’re better rested. Maybe it’s taking a walk outside or reading a book instead of checking Facebook. Maybe it’s making time for dedicated prayer. Maybe it’s eating an actual breakfast so you’re fueled for the day.\n\nRemember, the motive of self-discipline must not be self-hatred. We can honor God by stewarding well the bodies, souls, and minds He gave us.\n\nWe want to be able to serve Him well for as long as He has us in this field.\n\nThe Font + Fruit\n\nIn our desire and effort to grow in self-discipline, our aim is to give glory to God and to allow Him to make us saints. This is simply not possible apart from grace and the action of the Holy Spirit in our lives.\n\nSo once again, I entreat us all to pray. It is the font and fruit of self-discipline.\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts on this topic. We are all always students at the feet of the Teacher! Comment below!\n\nContinue reading\n\nWhat is a Morning Basket?\n\nThe term \"morning basket\" has been tossed around in homeschool circles for a couple of decades now. It has spread like wildfire (for good reason) and is not only reserved for homeschooling families.\n\nBecause of its increased popularity, it has become somewhat of an enigma. Assembling a morning basket can feel overwhelming because what if I don't do it right?\n\nI'm here to release you from that pressure... There is no singular \"right\" way.\n\nWhen it comes to creating a morning basket for your children, the main goal is to spread a feast of truth, beauty, and goodness.\n\nIf you're already implementing The Daily Feast, then your morning basket is already, like, 85% filled.\n\nOur morning basket usually consists of the elements of The Daily Feast plus some poetry and a few picture books.\n\nWhile you get to make the rules about your morning basket, it's helpful to have a few loose principles to build upon:\n\nA morning basket incorporates beauty.This may include prayer, Scripture, hymns, Saint bios, poetry, folk songs, fairy tales, and so on.\n\nYou don't have to do it all every day. You can choose different books based on the needs of that day.\n\nIt doesn't have to be a literal basket.You don't have to store your stuff in a basket for it to be a morning basket. Simply compile your resources in a place that is easily accessible to you and where you most often gather together.\n\nIt can be done at any time of the day.Don't be beholden by the term \"morning\"! A morning basket can be done at any time of the day. The best time to do it is when you actually do it.\n\nWhat is a MOTHER'S Morning Basket?\n\nSame idea, but for you.\n\nA mother's morning basket is meant to fill her soul and mind with truth, beauty, and goodness.\n\nFor many years, my mother's morning basket has been an anchor in my day. It affords me a moment to tend to my own soul and interests so that I can be poured out for my family—not by my own power, but His.\n\nThe same loose principles of a morning basket for your kids apply to a morning basket for yourself. The focus is prayer and beauty, you don't have to \"do it all\" every single day, you don't have to use a literal basket, and you can do it at any time of the day*.\n\nYour mother's morning basket will likely shift according to seasons (both literal and metaphorical). You may be able to enjoy it before the kids wake each day or amongst their happy interruptions.\n\n*I prefer the morning because I desperately need communion with Him first thing. A few months ago, some friends and I discussed our desire to include a \"mother's night basket\" in addition to our morning baskets. I have been doing this, and it has been a peaceful way to end my days! My night basket is much more abbreviated and includes night prayer, an examen, poetry (sometimes), and a novel. Also, this is not yet as firm a habit as my morning basket because many nights I fall into bed face-down and expired.\n\nThe Elements of a Morning Basket\n\nSo what should we include in our mother's morning baskets?! This is the fun part! Again, you make the rules. But I'm happy to offer some suggestions based on what has been particularly helpful to me over the years.\n\nRemember, you can include any, all, or none of these. And you don't have to partake in what you include every day. This is meant to bless you, not burden you!\n\nPrayer\n\nThis isn't necessarily tangible, but it's the cornerstone of my morning basket.\n\nEach morning, I sleepily crawl into the lap of the Father, ask the Son to \"give me a drink\", and voice my dependency upon the Holy Spirit. I wake up like a child.\n\nAdditionally, many moms use this as a time to pray their rosary or other devotional prayers.\n\nBible/Daily Readings\n\nGod's Word has proven to be a lamp for my feet and a light for my path. I am a beggar before the Lord, and He continuously feeds me with His Word and His Body in the Eucharist.\n\nReading Sacred Scripture—most often via the daily readings for Holy Mass—is the top priority of my morning basket.\n\nWhen it comes to Bibles, I recommend the NRSVCE translation. I use this one. If you prefer a journaling Bible, I like this one.\n\nJournal\n\nI like to keep some sort of paper journal in my morning basket to jot down prayers or verses.\n\nPrayer Books\n\nDo you have a prayer book you love? Keep it tucked in your morning basket and refer to it as needed or prompted.\n\nFor example, the Pieta prayer book is magnificent.\n\nDevotional\n\nIs there a devotional you're praying through, particularly during Advent or Lent? Are you in the middle of a consecration? These are great additions to the morning basket!\n\nSpiritual Reading\n\nMy morning basket also includes whatever spiritual book I'm currently reading. You can see some of my favorites here.\n\nPoetry\n\nPoetry is not currently a part of my morning basket, but what a lovely way to rouse to the day! I have this collection of nature poems that I read with my kids, but my girlfriends love the daily version and the night version for themselves!\n\nInspiration\n\nUnder this category falls anything lovely but not necessarily religious.\n\nThink food or design magazines, coffee table books, cookbooks, art collections, nature journals, homemaking resources, etc.\n\nWhat lifts your heart and inspires you for the tasks you are about to undertake? What inspires you to live a life worthy of the call you have received?\n\nTuck these in your morning basket and take delight!\n\nNon-Fiction Reading\n\nFinally, I include any non-fiction (but not spiritual) reading I'm tending to at the time. Books about homeschooling, homemaking, homesteading, health, historical figures, parenting, marriage, work, relationships, etc. fall into this category.\n\nIt bears repeating: not all of this is to be done every single day! We would likely be neglecting the duties of our vocation if we spent three hours in prayer and reading every single morning. Don't be afraid to just start! Nothing is a failure when offered to the Lord in humility, trust, and love!\n\nSetting Time + Space\n\nOnce you have determined when would be a great and realistic time for your morning basket, put it on your actual schedule in your actual planner. It makes a difference!\n\nThen, set the space. Choose where the contents of your morning basket will reside. Choose where you will sit.\n\nHow can you make this space more conducive to prayer?\n\nCan you drape a blanket across the chair to invite you into rest with Christ? Can you hang a crucifix, icon, or other holy image nearby so you can contemplate it during your prayer?\n\nConsider obtaining a candle that is just reserved for your morning basket time. I like these clean ones and these Catholic ones (use code ITD15 for 15% off).\n\nThe night before, set out a favorite mug (perhaps one from Into the Deep... perhaps this is a hint?) to fill with rejuvenating coffee or steeping tea before you begin.\n\nI keep these highlighters and a good pen on hand for emphasizing and taking notes.\n\nMy Current Mother's Morning Basket\n\nCurious about what's in my mother's morning basket right now? Here's my lineup:\n\nMy Bible (my wellspring)\n\nA Future with Hope (my journal)\n\nDivine Intimacy (my devotional)\n\nMother Love (my prayer book)\n\nI Believe in Love (my spiritual read)\n\nThe Country Diary of an Edwardian Lady (my inspiration read)\n\nTending the Heart of Virtue (my non-fiction read)\n\nYou can see them all here, too.\n\nThe Final Thought\n\nThe demands of our vocation are blessed and many, and the Lord does not ask us to do them apart from His grace. It is worthwhile to dwell with Him in the mornings. He is waiting to meet us in prayer. He longs to fill us with His love and delight, even in seasons of dryness.\n\nLet us, then, make a point to come to Him. Let us not rely on our own limited strength but on His endless power.\n\nLet us give our families the gift of a mother filled with beauty, wonder, and the Holy Spirit.\n\nLet us make time for what fills us up so we can be poured out another day.\n\nI'm so eager to know what you think about a mother's morning basket. Totally lame? Overwhelming? Thrilling? And if you already have some version of a Mother's morning basket, I'd love to know what's included in yours!\n\nContinue reading\n\nAugust is upon us, which means it is nearly time to begin another school year in our home. I have been in planning prep for a couple of months (I take it slow!) and I'm happy to share our booklists with you here!\n\nHow I Plan a New Homeschool Year\n\nMy planning process typically follows three movements:\n\nPray (you can learn more about that here)\n\nMake booklists (jot down all my ideas and resources, then heavily edit)\n\nPut it all together in a rhythm\n\nFirst, I'll share our booklists. Then, I'll share a loose idea of our rhythm!\n\nThe Groundwork...\n\nMy oldest kids are entering the 4th and 1st grades, and my youngest two are 3 years and ten months old.\n\nWhile each child does their own level of phonics, math, copywork, and logic, most of our subjects are done family style in a loop rotation (more on that later). This fits our family best in this season and we all really enjoy this setup.\n\nMy three-year-old will not do any formal preschool work; however, he likes feeling \"big\" and has asked for his own school work this year. I've picked up A is for Art to go through with him as interest dictates.\n\nMy main priority each morning is to snuggle him and read picture books to fill his cup before our school day begins.\n\nOur Homeschool \"Curriculum\" | The Booklists\n\n***Unless otherwise linked, all books can be found on this Amazon list!***\n\nLike I mentioned, we have family subjects and individual subjects. Only the older two have individual work. These children have different learning styles, so we use different resources for each.\n\nFamily Subjects\n\nMorning Basket\n\nOur Morning Time will consist of The Daily Feast + any memory work (like poetry, Mass parts, and longer dictations for my oldest).\n\nP.S. already using my Daily Feast notepad and it's a game changer for organization!\n\nWe will also do our fun read alouds during this time. I don't have a final list yet, but I've shared some definites in the Amazon shop!\n\nCatechesis\n\nWe will be using Into the Deep Level Two this year, taking pauses to do the picture studies on the Joyful Mysteries of the Rosary during Advent, the Luminous + Sorrowful during Lent, and the Glorious during Easter.\n\nHistory\n\nWe used The Story of the World last year and it was a family favorite all around! We are moving to Volume 2 this year. I use the student guide for extra reading, map work, and projects.\n\nAdditionally, I'll be reading one story each week from American Tall Tales so they have a touch point with their national history.\n\nGeography\n\nWe use the geography prompts in the SOTW above.\n\nI'll also pepper in Charlotte Mason's Elementary Geography.\n\nNature Study/Science\n\nIt's a water year for us! I'll be using Among the Pond People in the fall semester and Ocean Anatomy and Watercolor with Me in the spring.\n\nI picked up The Good and the Beautiful's Wind + Waves. We used their Little Hearts and Hands last year and it was a great resource to have on hand for days when I needed extra support (like when a kid was sick or the baby didn't sleep). Excited to have that in my back pocket again this year.\n\nLiterature\n\nMy fave! Well, alongside catechesis and history.\n\nWe will ease into the first semester by revisiting A.A. Milne's When We Were Very Young. Aligned with our history studies, we will also read some Norse Myths!\n\nIn the second semester, we will read a couple of Shakespeare plays (the kids have loved these—not yet sure if we will revisit old favorites, read new, or a combination of both).\n\nOur main focus this spring semester will be fairy tales. I've snagged some fairy tale picture books from Will Moses, and I have a couple of collections here at home I will pull from. (A note on finding books on fairy tales: be sure they are the original text, not adaptations!)\n\nCharacter Building\n\nI have some perfectionistic students (no idea where they got that 😬), so we are working on growth mindset with Mistakes that Worked.\n\nWe will also be reading through A Book of Golden Deeds.\n\nIn the spring semester, we will revisit Connoisseur Kids. We used it this year and it was a roaring success, so the kids want to go through it again!\n\nArtist\n\nEach year, we study two artists. In the fall we will study Van Eyck and use the picture studies from Simply Charlotte Mason.\n\nIn the spring, we will deep dive Michelangelo. I'm pumped. We will use SCM's picture studies, along with The Stone Giant, Michelangelo for Kids, Mike Venezia's Michelangelo, and a giant coffee table book of his complete works.\n\nComposer\n\nAs with the artists, I select two composers to study each year. In the fall, we will study Handel and, in the spring, Paganini.\n\nI'm an Opal Wheeler fan girl, so I just use her books. Mike Venezia has a book on Handel, too, so we will use that as well.\n\nLanguage\n\nI don't stress about this much yet. My energy is focused more on reading fluency at this stage and, with a toddler and baby, I don't have much overflow to devote to foreign language.\n\nI have Prima Latina and we will use those DVDs each week in \"car school\" when we drive a small distance to pick up our farm food and dairy.\n\nOn Rhythms...\n\nOur family functions best with a rhythm rather than a strict schedule. But we typically begin around 9 a.m. (this gives us time for personal prayer, breakfast, morning chores, and getting ready).\n\nTypically, we school Monday-Thursday, as Fridays are set aside for errands, Mass, and cleaning.\n\nWeekly Loops\n\nWith that, here are the family subjects we will loop throughout the week:\n\nMondays || catechesis, character building, history, nature study, and composer\n\nWednesdays || catechesis, character building, history, literature, and nature study\n\nThursdays || catechesis, history, literature, and artist/drawing\n\nLike I mentioned, all of this will be tested by actually living it, and we will adjust as needed!\n\nI always enjoy reading other people's homeschool plans, so I hope this has brought you some entertainment and solidarity! God bless your new school year!\n\nContinue reading\n\nMemorization in catechesis can be a surprisingly divisive topic. I can understand why.\n\nSome people have childhood scars from being required to recite long prayers in Latin in front of a class, perhaps being physically reprimanded upon a mistake.\n\nOthers grew up post-pendulum swing, and were hardly required to memorize anything about the Faith beyond the Hail Mary (and whatever else they needed to pass the multiple choice tests).\n\nThe former tend to shun memorization and a question/answer format for learning the Faith because they don’t want their children to suffer the same empty talk and humiliation.\n\nThe latter tend to crave the unrelenting presence of Truth that fills one’s brain when memorizing and place highest priority on knowing the details of the doctrine, period.\n\nSo what are we to do?\n\nWhat the Church Teaches about Memorization\n\nThe Church, per usual, offers a both/and approach.\n\n\"The blossoms—if we may call them that—of faith and piety do not grow in the desert places of a memoryless catechesis\" (Catechesi Tredendae 55).\n\nWe must memorize. We were made to memorize—even brain science reveals that.\n\nBut we aren’t meant to memorize for its own sake.\n\nThe Purpose of Memorization\n\nMemorization is meant to lead to transformation.\n\nWhat we commit to memory about the Faith should compel us to commit our lives to it.\n\nThat’s why, here at Into the Deep, we emphasize meaningful memorization.\n\nWe want our kids to memorize Scripture so that, when they face giants throughout their lives, they’ll have an arsenal of the Living Word at the ready for spiritual battle.\n\nWe want our kids to memorize doctrine so that their consciences are well-formed and they’re trained to choose the good.\n\nWe want our kids to memorize prayers so that, when words fail them, they fall back on the words that were whispered over them as children.\n\nWe wants our kids to memorize truths about the Faith so that their brain and heart pathways lead them to the One Who created them.\n\n\"What is essential is that texts that are memorized must at the same time be taken in and gradually understood in depth, in order to become a source of Christian life on the personal level and on the community level\" (Catechesi Tredendae 55).\n\nMemorization is key and, when done with depth and intention, waters the blooms of devotion.\n\nWhat has been your experience with memorization in catechesis? How has that colored your approach to memorizing the Faith with your own kids?\n\nContinue reading\n\n“The mother who takes pains to endow her children with good habits secures for herself smooth and easy days; while she who lets their habits take care of themselves has a weary life of endless friction with the children.”\n\n- Charlotte Mason\n\nOrder is something we all strive to have in our lives. It makes the world go ‘round and helps create a sense of security throughout childhood and adulthood.\n\nMaintaining a smooth, rhythmic schedule aids your child in more ways than you can count. Having a rhythmic home life is good for the body, but having a rhythmic liturgical life is good for the soul.\n\nThe Faith isn't simply meant to be learned; it's meant to be lived. Things such as reading about the lives of Saints and understanding the seasons of the Church can be done during any time of day, not only during religion class. Leaning on the liturgical year provides a structure in your children's lives that can accompany them into adulthood.\n\nHow Living the Liturgical Year Now Impacts their Future as Catholics\n\nAn impactful way to help children as the next generation of Catholics is having structure built within their spiritual life. Helping your child increase attentiveness to their faith will aid them in growing long-lasting habits in their love for the Church and the Lord.\n\nReading the Bible as a family, attending Mass every Sunday, and praying the rosary are great ways to have a lasting impact. A good liturgical option is to keep up with Saints’ feast days. There is a feast every day and there are multiple ways to celebrate. Reading a summary and then praying to the Saints daily is a fun and mindful way to keep up with the liturgical year.\n\nAnother great option is considering a liturgical planner for your child. A planner is used to organize the day to day events. Your child can not only keep track of the upcoming week, but also see different religious feast days and holidays, such as Christmas and Easter.\n\nA Structure for Worship\n\nThe Catholic liturgical year organizes the Church's celebrations and events, providing a structure for worship and reflection. Having a religious structure encourages orderliness in the soul. Order is physical as well as mental. Following the ebb and flow of fasting and feasting within the liturgical year is a physical reminder of the liturgical year.\n\nFor example, let's say that, at the beginning of the week, you fill out your planner. You include things like events, birthdays, work schedule, weekend plans, etc. A liturgical planner works the same way as a normal planner, but it has Catholicism filtered into its pages. What a fun way to help your child grow in their faith!\n\nContinuous Contemplation\n\nLiving the liturgical year allows us to remember the life and teachings of Jesus and to deepen faith through various liturgical seasons and feasts. Remembering the Saints that have lived out the faith serves as an inspiration for Catholics. Contemplating the faith daily helps with spiritual growth.\n\nCatholic Connection\n\nThe liturgical year helps to create a sense of unity and community among Catholics worldwide. Community is something we as humans need. We usually look for people that we can relate to, sympathize with, similar beliefs, etc. Connecting with other Catholics over your love of the Faith is amazing!\n\nCheck Out our Student Planner!\n\nWhat’s a fun, immersive way to help your child grow in the faith?
