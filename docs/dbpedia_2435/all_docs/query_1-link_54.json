        "text": "It was another early weekend start, as we headed in to London for Prom 29. I’d missed last year’s organ recital – I can’t remember why, it may have been train strikes. This year it was the turn of Jonathan Scott. He began with Lemare’s transcription of Wagner’s overture to Tannhäuser, which certainly exercised quite a few of the pipes. Next up, J S Bach’s Fantasia and Fugue in G minor BWV 542, followed by some unfamiliar pieces: Chaminade’s Autumn from Six Concert Études Op. 35 and Jules Grison’s\n\nToccata in F major, which cheekily quoted from the Toccata and Fugue BWV565. Ives’s Variations on America was eclectic as always. Scott then talked through and demonstrated some of the settings on the organ, before his own arrangement of Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture. As he said, the organ has no “cannon” stop, but nonetheless, the performance was probably audible for anyone within half a mile of the hall. He gave us Puccini’s Nessum Dorma as an encore.\n\nAfter lunch, we headed south to Dulwich Picture Gallery, to see Yoshida: Three Generations of Japanese Printmaking. As is often the case, the first room was quite busy but the others were a bit more dispersed. Yoshida Hiroshi visited Dulwich Picture Gallery himself, so it was an opportunity to show the relevant page from the visitors book of 1900. His Japanese prints ranged from quintessential landscapes and cherry blossoms to more urban settings; in particular, Kagurazaka Dori made me think of Atkinson Grimshaw. But the prints weren’t limited to Japanese subjects, as he travelled and made images of other places, including Venice, Athens, the Sphinx and the Grand Canyon. It was interesting to see the same base image used with different colouring schemes, for different conditions or times of day. Other family members whose works are included in the exhibition were his wife Yoshida Fujio, sons Yoshida Tōshi and Yoshida Hodaka, the latter’s wife Yoshida Chizuko, through to the current generation Yoshida Ayomi. On the whole I found the abstract works less engaging, but they were still mostly interesting. A short video in the mausoleum showed how the prints were made.\n\nGranted, there were only two brothers on this occasion, Braimah on violin and Sheku on cello, but the Kanneh‐Mason siblings are surely the Von Trapp family of our time. It must have been a weird place to grow up – but hopefully, good weird rather than bad weird. Plínio Fernandes on guitar was a third soloist for the Sunday morning Prom with the Fantasia Orchestra conducted by Tom Fetherstonhaugh.\n\nAs such, it was an early start for a weekend, and arriving at the hall around 10:20 I had a spot three or four rows back in the arena, but it was quite relaxed and spaced out. The concert was loosely themed on folk song and dance, and began with two numbers attributed to “Trad”, first the Serbian Ajde Jano, followed by Scarborough Fair. More mainstream classical items were arrangements of three of Brahms’s Hungarian Dances, Bartók’s Romanian Folk Dances and Dvořák’s Song to the Moon from Rusalka. But these were interspersed by less conventional pieces by Burt Bacharach (I Say a Little Prayer), Bob Marley (Redemption Song), Laura Mvula (Sing to the Moon), Antônio Carlos Jobim (The Girl From Ipanema), Piazzolla (Libertango), Stevie Wonder (I Wish), and Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards (Good Times), rounded off with an encore of the Air from J S Bach’s Orchestral Suite No. 3.\n\nWhat struck me about many of these pieces is that the debate over authenticity is essentially meaningless. An “authentic” performance for many of these is really making use of the musicians available and ad-libbing where they feel like it. Perhaps a cimbalom for the Brahms or Bartók, or bandoneon for the Piazzola, would have made the music more authentic. But it was just great fun.\n\nEarlier in the week, I had chosen to take the tube to South Kensington, to make use of the tunnel rather than walking across Kensington Gardens in the baking heat, and I randomly noticed posters for the V&A’a Tropical Modernism exhibition. This sounded interesting enough for a detour, and so I headed there after the concert. It’s a small exhibition and contains mostly photographs and architectural models, and narrows its scope to the Ghana of Kwame Nkrumah and the India of Nehru. The era of independence was an opportunity to start afresh, and what better way than to adopt an architectural style to which the colonial power was at best indifferent? Taking local motifs and providing shelter from heat, the results were a new rendition of modernist ideas. Le Corbusier was invited to design Chandigarh, although some of the local architects found his approach somewhat high-handed and the results met with mixed success. Later innovations included geodesic domes following Buckminster Fuller, and the Hall of Nations in New Delhi (controversially demolished in 2017). Sadly, contemporary photographs of many places in the exhibition show that these modernist and brutalist structures do not stand the test of time without proper maintenance.\n\nMy journey in to London yesterday was just like old times. In Reading, I found King’s Meadow Car Park was closed for cleaning; I backtracked to Hill’s Meadow, cautious that it used to close at 9pm, but believing it now has 24 hour access (and 24 hour charges). Then, a points failure somewhere seemed to be causing chaos in the station, although in practice it wasn’t too long a wait for a train.\n\nSo for Prom 16 I was the rail, although a bit further off-centre than I would have preferred. John Storgårds conducted the BBC Philharmonic. For the first half, Lawrence Power was the soloist in Cassandra Miller’s viola concerto I cannot love without trembling. It’s not quite Rail Replacement Bus Service, but BBC co-commission isn’t one of those phrases to trigger unfettered joy. Actually the piece was interesting, but for me it never quite built up enough momentum. It seemed to be full of micro-tones but rarely broke out of its somnolence. I suspect it deserves more listening, but may be unlikely to get it.\n\nThe main event was the second half, a performance of Shostakovich’s infamous Symphony No. 4. A road not taken, as someone in the queue had said earlier, as the composer decided to file this piece after Stalin’s criticism of his opera Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk. There’s truth to that, but it still shares quite a bit of its sound world with later siblings. In the recording I have (WDR/Barshai) there’s a passage just before the recapitulation in the first movement where rising strings give me the impression of an accelerating electric motor, like a tube train, tram, or lift. But in Storgårds’ rendition, this passage was completely devoid of any legato, and produced a very different effect. I expected an interesting performance, and I was not disappointed. It’s a long time since I saw this symphony previously, and I can’t remember the detail to compare. Although I stand by the Mahlerian comparison – perhaps even more evident with the contrasts between woodwind fragments and orchestral tutti sections – as a whole the work has grown on me. The ending is tragic, but perhaps also defiant; the light is dwindling but it is not altogether extinguished.\n\nA long post, which I shall break into sections.\n\nPPC selection\n\nI suppose it began last year. As a member of the Lib Dems, I was entitled to participate in our PPC selection for the new constituency of Reading West and Mid Berkshire. A curious combination which looked intent on splitting the non-Tory vote. Anyhow, some of our candidates more or less admitted it was unwinnable; Helen Belcher, on the other hand, thought it was. And I inclined to agree with her. I also thought she was considerably better than the other candidates at the hustings – in fact someone I thought we ought to have as an MP – so I had no difficulty in deciding where to place my vote. After some unseemly procedural shenanigans (which led to one of the others becoming an independent candidate) she was declared our candidate.\n\nSunak called an election in late May. A bizarre choice, given that his own party had been heavily defeated in the local elections some weeks previously. But then, it was also a bizarre choice to announce the election in the pouring rain. As John Crace and no doubt others put it, things can only get wetter.\n\nNomination\n\nA session was convened to bundle “thank you” leaflets for our local election result, not where I live but in Reading itself. “Please raise your hand if you are a Party member”. Along with several others, I raised my hand. “Please keep your hand raised if you live in the [Parliamentary] constituency”. My hand remained raised. “Good, you can sign Helen’s nomination papers.” Well, that escalated quickly, I thought. So I found myself nominating someone to stand for election as a Member of Parliament.\n\nWe were not a target seat. It is important to note that this does not mean we cannot win, it simply means that central funding will not come here, and that efforts will be focussed elsewhere. It should also be noted that, until early 2024, Labour also considered this a non-battleground seat.\n\nThe Campaign\n\nSo, on several occasions, I delivered leaflets for Wokingham, which was our nearest target seat. Because reasons, we also became the local warehouse for leaflets for RW&MB. Initially, the leaflet bundles did go down, but then they stalled. I walked rather a lot – in fact Google says 30 miles in June – of the mean streets of Burghfield and Mortimer, and got to know more of both villages than I have in 20 years.\n\nWe noticed that Labour were turning out literature much more actively. There was only token activity from the Tories, Green, and Reform candidates.\n\nInjurious\n\nMortimer turned out to be quite hazardous. On one occasion, my leafleting spatula was confiscated by a dog. A week later, I had an unfortunate accident. The house in question had a noisy and energetic dog, which I could see was beyond a fence, but all the same I was keen to exit. The garden also had a gate. And a thick and impenetrable hedge of holly. There was no pavement on the road outside. After ensuring I had closed the gate, I saw and heard nothing. Then, Bang!\n\nSomething really bad has just happened.\n\nHave I just been hit by a car?\n\nI am still alive, although I’m a bit sore in places. Nothing seems to be missing.\n\nThat was definitely the low-light of the campaign. After shakily exchanging details and observing the entrails of the broken wing mirror on the ground, I carried on my way, believing I had escaped with only cuts and bruises. A couple of days later, my toes were an interesting colour and via NHS 111 I spent some quality time at West Berkshire Community Hospital, where it was confirmed that nothing was broken.\n\nOn polling day itself, I spent some time as a teller. Interestingly, Labour were also telling in the morning peak. In the morning, I had the sense things weren’t going our way; in the evening, it seemed a bit more encouraging. I found it interesting that Labour were visibly “knocking up” in the evening.\n\nI had expressed an interest in going to the count. As the local authority containing the majority of both constituencies, Newbury was counting both Newbury itself and RW&MB. So I thought I had a fair chance of observing at least one, and possibly two, Lib Dem victories in person. It was an interesting experience. From the perspective of those officiating, the process is divided into verifying and counting phases. But from the perspective of partisan observers, the process is divided into counting and verifying, respectively. It was a bit intimidating to start with, although a briefing earlier in the week helped considerably, and after a short while I think I found my stride. But it was a bit depressing – we were clearly well beaten, and Reform were doing disturbingly well.\n\nWe had declarations for both constituencies at around 6am. The Lib Dems had gained Newbury – hooray! But Labour had taken RW&MB, and we had come fourth. Time to go home, rest, and reflect.\n\nAftermath\n\nWe had always been aware that the Labour candidate had worked in Keir Starmer’s office, and there had been a bit of a smell around the modelling of tactical vote sites (which are widely acknowledged to have a pro-Labour bias) and effort going into this constituency. It later transpired that despite advice, Labour had directed from the top to make this a target seat. Personally, with few exceptions I’d rather be represented by a Labour than Conservative MP – not everyone feels this way, and they have their reasons – but I am unconvinced that we have a great representative as a result of this election.\n\nNationally and regionally, it’s a great result for the party, and I should try to remember that. It’s just my bad luck to live in one of the few places where circumstances combined badly against us.\n\nBook Review: The Subterranean Railway, by Christian Wolmar\n\nI bought this as a Kindle special offer before Christmas, in case I needed filler, but it had been on my radar for quite some time. This is an updated edition, with references to covid but with the Elizabeth Line still a work in progress. As I have come to expect, Wolmar is an excellent writer, and he gathers and selects his comprehensive story well, beginning with a number of transport schemes of varying plausibility that were drafted from the early nineteenth century onwards. What is remarkable is the speed of construction, once a decision to go ahead was made. Of course there was no health and safety to be concerned about, but the technology for the “cut and cover” subsurface lines was innovative, and the deep tubes which followed a generation later even more so. Despite scepticism (and smoke), the trains were generally popular, but mostly struggled to recoup their costs and pay dividends to investors. Ironically, the solution was often to build more railway, and there’s no doubt that whilst central London shaped the initial routes, the later extensions into outlying villages shaped the London of the twentieth century, most famously but not uniquely with Metro-land.\n\nThe City of London was resistant to railways, and so all the main line termini lie outside its boundaries; the original Metropolitan line ran from Paddington to Farringdon, on the edge of the city, via Euston, St Pancras and King’s Cross. For many years, some through trains were also allowed; Wolmar does not elaborate much, but it turns out that GWR had adopted standard gauge (or at least mixed gauge) on some routes into Paddington by 1863, which would otherwise have been a mystery. Although London Underground and National Rail services were separated many years ago, today’s Thameslink service running north-south is a reincarnated example of a route originally plied by many operators.\n\nIt’s not just about the trains, though. Wolmar discusses the distinctive architecture, the companies, the driving personalities, poster art, Harry Beck’s map, and the development of London. The tube was used as a shelter in World War 1, as well as more famously in World War 2. In the post-war decades, investment ground to a halt, with the rise of the motor car but without foreseeing the problems of congestion, and the service deteriorated (Wolmar singles out the King’s Cross fire as a particularly bad example of decline). But still there was innovation: the Victoria line introduced essentially driverless trains (they are manned for safety, rather than as a technical requirement). The Jubilee line was introduced to relieve congestion on the central section of the Bakerloo line; the subsequent extension was not that originally planned, being somewhat influenced by the Canary Wharf development (a factor also in the route of the later Elizabeth line). Financially, the system went through mergers, mutualisation, nationalisation, and PFI: some of these were more successful than others. A curious omission, I suppose falling mostly after publication of the original edition, is any discussion of modern ticketing: Oyster was innovative, and I’ve read elsewhere that TfL, if not the originator of the technology, arguably precipitated mass usage of contactless payments across the world. But it’s still a fine book."
