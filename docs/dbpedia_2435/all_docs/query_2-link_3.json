        "text": "Rose Tremain (born August 2, 1943, London, England) is a British novelist whose books often dramatize a moment of truth in the lives of lonely outsiders.\n\nAfter receiving a degree in English from the University of East Anglia in 1967, Tremain worked for the British Printing Corporation and wrote several nonfiction works about woman suffrage before publishing her first novel, Sadler’s Birthday (1976). This book, which presents the reminiscences of an elderly butler who lives alone in the house he has inherited from his former employers, established Tremain’s reputation as a chronicler of despair and loneliness. In Letter to Sister Benedicta (1978), a middle-aged woman whose family life is unbearable writes to her former teacher, a nun, looking for solace. The Cupboard (1981) explores the relationship between an older, neglected writer and the journalist sent to interview her.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nClassic Children’s Books Quiz"
