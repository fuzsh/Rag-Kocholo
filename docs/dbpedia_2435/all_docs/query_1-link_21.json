        "text": "As a teenager, I spent my weekends performing with the local youth theatre. Aged 19, I toured India playing Sheila in JB Priestley’s An Inspector Calls. But books already played a vital role in my life. I discovered Simone de Beauvoir in Basildon library and my first tome of Virginia Woolf – The Waves – in the school library by chance. Like so many people, one schoolteacher Mrs Lapinskas particularly inspired me. I remember reading Larkin’s The Old Fools with her in the sixth form house one day and thinking ‘ah, so that’s how you read poetry’.\n\nAt the University of Bristol, studying Drama and English, I wrote short stories on a rickety typewriter. My first job was in media training and radio production, enabling me to interview many authors whose ideas encouraged me to keep writing.\n\nI studied coaching with CoachU USA and was the first traditionally published novelist in the UK to also qualify as a life coach. I’ve taught creative writing in a wide variety of settings from Feltham Young Offenders Institution to City University. In 2012, I studied for a PGCE in Drama with English at London’s Institute of Education and subsequently taught English for a year in a London secondary school.\n\nToday, I still run The Writing Coach and am incredibly proud of the many writers I’ve worked with who have gone on to see their work in print. It’s my privilege to work with authors whose stories I deeply believe in.\n\nI am also committed to working with underrepresented writers. My business The Writing Coach is an Award Partner for Creative Futures Writers Awards, and I offer mentoring each year to two writers as prizes. Through my membership for writers, Inside Story, I also offer six annual scholarships to BAME writers. I support the homelessness charity Spear via my online course for writers Get Black on White.\n\nI have two adult children and am married to the cartoonist and visualiser David Lewis. I’m currently working on my sixth novel A Picture of You."
