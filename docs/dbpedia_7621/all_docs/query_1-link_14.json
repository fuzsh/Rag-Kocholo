        "text": "All protest music is political music, but not all political music encourages positive social change. Some political music may celebrate repressive regimes and reinforce a status quo, while other music may incite or agitate. In the flamenco community, there is a debate about whether or not flamenco itself is a form of social protest – a debate spurred by the recent death of Pete Seeger. Several scholars claim that flamenco’s political sentiment is too “invisible,” subtle, or personal to qualify as protest music. Although this certainly characterizes much of flamenco’s repertoire, it does not speak to the full breadth of flamenco’s subject matter, e.g., labor issues expressed in miner’s laments, the dissent of flamenco’s anti-Franco Left, and recent flash mobs materializing in Spain’s banks. Examining flamenco’s history, lyrics, select performances, and contemporary social media, I reveal how sentiments of protest and dissent form the core of flamenco’s ethos. Working from R. Serge Denisoff’s model of protest music, I contend that flamenco has encouraged activism (magnetic protest) and identified the marginalizing social conditions of Andalusia’s working-and-underclass (rhetorical protest). Its dance, music, song style, and performance context always embody dissent, yet flamenco is not limited to its function as a form of protest. It remains both an expression of deep personal emotion and a public display of unity, often in the same performance.\n\nThis book, written in an accessible and open style, on the one hand offers English speakers an overview of flamenco as a musical form or set of musical practices, and, on the other, uses flamenco to interrogate some of the ways in which social bonds and ideas of ‘truth’ and ‘authenticity’ are played out by both flamenco musicians and lovers of flamenco in Southern Spain. The book is divided into six chapters (including the introductory chapter and a concluding chapter) and is based on research undertaken in Spanish archives and at flamenco performances at local peñas and tablaos on trips to Madrid, Seville, Granada and Málaga funded by the British Academy in 2013-2015. The book aims to be both introductory (in that it assumes no prior knowledge of flamenco, introducing and explaining terms and concepts carefully and systematically) and analytical (in both the music-analytical sense of the term and in the sense of ‘critical’, drawing, that is, on recent developments in the fields of affect theory, critiques of identity and identity politics and gender and sexuality studies). The book differs from much Spanish- and English-language scholarship on flamenco in that it: 1. Offers detailed and technical engagement with musical examples 2. Seeks to represent recent and classic Spanish-language scholarship to an English audience 3. Seeks to balance the demands of music-analytical approaches and cultural/contextual approaches 4. Seeks to give voice to ‘insider’ narratives about flamenco from within the flamenco-practising communities formed since the beginning of the twentieth century 5. Offers gender and sexuality-inflected analyses of flamenco largely missing from the scholarship to date 6. Discusses how flamenco practices and identities have been represented on film (in both narrative cinema and in documentaries) 7. Offers a detailed and critical discography of flamenco from 1901 through to the present\n\nFrom pre-modern Christmas pageants all the way through to Jordan Peele’s “sunken place”—a place where, as Simone de Beauvoir has written, the subjectivity of “sovereign and unique” beings “is crushed by the dark weight of other things,” Whiteness and Blackness have been conjoined in a series of negative correlations. Purity and pollution, harmony and dissonance, over and under, order and disorder, Christian epiphany and damning confusion have limned the edge distinguishing freedom and personhood from enslavement and abjection. Yet in these paradigmatic dyads one term always implies—indeed, defines—the other; in these relations there is never erasure, but rather evidence of white culture’s perverse fascination—envy, even—with the sonorous, dislocated, inciting, and infinitely suggestive products of black culture. The impolite music and dance of cacophony, dissonance, and disorder vibrate with a fugitive, turbulent Otherness, hinting at the specters of alternate social, spiritual, and aesthetic orders. “What does it mean,” Fred Moten asks in The Undercommons: Fugitive Planning and Black Study (2013), “to call for disorder in the sovereign’s ‘native tongue?’” We must attend to cacophony, Moten writes; we must “inhabit and maybe even cultivate…[the] place which shows up here and now, in the sovereign’s space and time, as absence, darkness, death, things which are not.“ Stuart Hall has theorized diaspora as a “radical homelessness,” an expression of an “ethics of the self…attuned to the edges.” Flamencos, whose embodied and minstrelized Blackness is figured by the Spanish Roma, have always known this statelessness, have always adhered to this code. How, then, can flamenco illuminate theories of race and identity in performance? And, conversely, how can the theoretical tools developed in other fields help us better understand flamenco? How may we consider flamenco’s purposefully duplicitous roar, its nonsense, and its irony, in light not only of critical race theory but also of other approaches, such as ethics, or theories of gender, or of sound? And, regarding the purposeful ambiguity of calling for disorder in the sovereign’s tongue, why are some of the great theorists, such as June Jordan, and Fred Moten, poets? How can black poetics help us read, and explain to others, flamenco’s life blood, its verses? As VK Preston has wondered, when cultural wealth—verse, rhythm, or gesture, for example—is extracted, smelted, and rendered into the likeness of the oppressor, what of its animating spirit, what of its soul remains?7 And, speaking of dancing in shackles, why do the footwork steps used in early modern Spanish depictions of ruffians dancing under the lash bear such an uncanny resemblance to the shuffle steps of African American dances? That is to say, how can we posit, and argue for, genealogical relationships across the vast expanses of the African diaspora? And how may the codes of flamenco improvisation help us trace these? We don’t need to be limited to flamenco, and we don’t need to be limited to these questions. We want with this gathering to reach out, find connection, and cross the border into what Jack Halberman calls “The Wild Beyond,” to make “common cause with the brokenness of being”— “a brokenness,” he writes, “that is also blackness.”\n\nThe last quarter of the twentieth century saw a re-definition of flamenco performance, which was mostly due to the use of musical instruments associated with other styles and to the appropriation of \"non-flamenco\" performance spaces and practices. The beginning of the twenty-first century has witnessed the continued modification of the tradition via new technology, which both creates and reflects new ways of playing, singing and dancing flamenco. Artists have continued to cross both physical and technological borders, collaborating with other musicians, acquiring other sounds, and developing new concepts of flamenco performance. Rather than analysing the contemporary flamenco scene in one particular context (Spain), in this paper I propose to examine the ways in which flamenco has fitted in to the wider world popular music scene. In order to do this I will focus on international festivals in which flamenco performers have collaborated with musicians from other cultural and/or musical backgrounds. The paper will present new fieldwork carried out in Spain and elsewhere and commentaries by flamenco musicians, sound technicians and agents. The light this sheds on developments in the contemporary flamenco scene will then be compared to theoretical work on technology taking place elsewhere in popular music studies."
