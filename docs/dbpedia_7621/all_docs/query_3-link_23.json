        "text": "Just when it seemed time to lament that Spain's great flamenco dancers had all died out, along comes ''Flamenco Puro,'' an assembly of various flamenco singers, dancers and guitarists who are completely superb. The production that Claudio Segovia and Hector Orezzoli have put together at the Mark Hellinger Theater might seem to take a cue from their previous hit, ''Tango Argentino'' - the dancers again do not belong to one company but are loosely linked through a series of numbers.\n\nYet this is a format traditional to flamenco itself. The true flamenco dancer is self-absorbed, reaching inward -a ''soloist'' even when dancing with a partner. This is the essence that the production has preserved with its gypsy performers. Although flamenco music, and thus its dance forms, looks back to Andalusian sources as well as the gypsy heritage, it is the gypsy with whom flamenco art has been identified.\n\nFor many, flamenco remains a folk form. But it is hardly a musical or dance genre that can easily be picked up like a square dance. Indeed, one of flamenco's characteristics is its deeply hermetic nature. ''Flamenco Puro'' demonstrates that it is accessible to all as entertainment. And yet flamenco's depths seem to be plumbed only by those who are initiated into its mysteries - into its complex rhythms, structures and more important, the distilled cries of joy and pain that lie at its base.\n\nThat foundation is clearly an esthetic one. For all its popular roots, flamenco is an art. It would be wrong to bemoan the fact that the performers in ''Flamenco Puro'' are being seen outside the caves of Granada. They are first-rate, highly trained professionals.\n\nThe show's opening, the bulerias, has a strong ritual cast. The entire company is clustered in a circle, a communal round whose magnetic center seems to draw in the dancers. There is an air of secrecy that dissipates only when the dancers open up into a semicircle to face the public. The curve of their pattern duplicates the curve of the basic and apt set designed by Mr. Segovia and Mr. Orezzoli.\n\nIn this abstract bull ring (a huge hanging curtain with panels in front to suggest entrances), the dancers come forward like toreadors to display their art and skill before they fade quietly into its darkened passages. A carefully structured jam session, the bulerias introduces each dancer and singer.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
