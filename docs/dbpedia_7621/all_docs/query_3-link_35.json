        "text": "A\n\nafillá a type of hoarse, earthy flamenco voice\n\nalante stage front\n\nAlegrias A joyful dance, in compas of 12 beats, from Cadiz. The origin is in the jotas of Cadiz – traditional folk music of Aragon, brought to the Andalucian region by soldiers during the War of Independence in the early 19th century. The main characteristics of this style are the richness of its guitar accompaniment, the intricacy of the dancing, the demands of its difficult rhythm, and its lively sound. Descendent of the Soleares family.\n\nAndalucia region from southern Spain; birthplace of Flamenco\n\narpegio a chord whose notes are played in succession, not simultaneously\n\natrás stage rear\n\nB\n\nbaile the dance\n\nbailaor{a} dancer (male & female)\n\nbout body of the guitar\n\nbraceo movement of the arms during the dance\n\nbulerias High-spirited song & dance from Jerez. This developed like Soleares from a simple style. However, unlike Soleares, it has a fast and lively rhythm – indeed, the fastest in all flamenco – and provides enormous scope for improvisation on the part of dancers, singers and guitarists. It is wild, frenzied and lively, but nevertheless contains the germ of sorrow that is almost always present in flamenco.\n\nC\n\ncabales Flamenco experts\n\ncafé cantante coffee house with flamenco shows (originally starting with flamenco cante but eventually covering all flamenco forms)\n\ncajon percussive instrument similar to an empty wooden box\n\ncalo language of the gypsies\n\ncaña Caña, also very closely related to Soleares, is one of the oldest forms of flamenco, and one of the most pure and beautiful.\n\ncantaor{a} singer (male & female)\n\ncante song\n\ncante chico light song, more frivolous\n\ncante jondo (‘j’ prounounced as ‘h’) deep song covering both the dark and serious aspect of Flamenco\n\ncante grande more profound song\n\ncarcelera type of tonás sung by incarcerated gypsies\n\nCaracoles This is one type of cantiñ which appeared in Cadiz in the mid-19th century. It became strongly associated with Madrid, although it is essentially from Andalucia, like all flamenco music. Curro Cuchares and ‘El Tato’ who worked in the bull-rings and were also good singers took this style to Madrid where it became very popular. Later it was recreated in a masterly way by Antonio Chacon, who gave it its present brilliance and vitality.\n\ncejilla capo on a guitar\n\ncolombianas flamenco style influenced by S.American rhythms\n\ncompás beat, rhythm, measure, the characteristic rhythm of a form\n\ncopla verse\n\ncuadro group of flamenco performers, including dancers singers, and guitarists\n\nD\n\ndanza mora a style influenced by the Moors of N.Africa (stands for Moorish Dance); guitar 6th string tuned to D\n\ndebla toná with religious overtones\n\ndesplante section of a dance, as in “desplante por bulerias”, performed after the “llamada”. May range from several steps to several compass depending on the choreography\n\nduende the soul force that inspires flamenco art\n\nE\n\nentrada entrance of the dancer\n\nestribillo a flamenco phrase\n\nF\n\nfalda skirt\n\nfalseta a melodic variation played by guitarist\n\nfalsete high pitched voice\n\nfandango a dance from Huelva; cante chico\n\nfarruca A spectacular male dance, one of the more recent forms of flamenco. Its origin is perhaps in some chants from the North of Spain. It is never sung when played in the pure flamenco idiom. As a dance or as a guitar solo, it is a very dramatic piece.\n\nflamenco music/dance from Andalucia in Southern Spain. Roots in Indian, Arabic, Spanish cultures.\n\nfloreo movement of the hands\n\nG\n\ngitano gypsy\n\ngolpe An accoustic effect while playing guitar where the player hits the ‘golpeador’ (plastic protection for the guitar) with his nail.\n\ngolpeador Plastic protection for the guitar similar to a pick guard /—–\\/—\\ | __ | iii | I (__)============(—) | xxxx | iii \\_____/\\___/ If ‘o’ is the guitar sound hole, xxxx is a place, where you can find the Golpeador. Sometimes the player has more than one, depending on their style of playing\n\nguajiras a style influenced by Cuban rhythms\n\nH\n\nhondo deep, profound\n\njuergaflamenco party or jam session\n\njaleo utterances of approval, encouragement. Recognition of the duende\n\njondo variation of hondo most often associated with flamenco dance\n\njúcal A calo word used to refer to a great “bulerias” toque\n\nL\n\nletra verse of a song\n\nllamada “call” or “break”, dance movement signalling a change of section\n\nM\n\nmalagueñas a free form flamenco style (no specific compas, interpretive, and not danced) from Malaga.

The earliest known.\n\ntoque guitar playing\n\ntoque compás guitar playing with fixed patterns of rhythmic beats\n\ntoque libre guitar playing with free form rhythm\n\ntremolo a rapid fluttering of a guitar tone or alternating tones\n\nZ\n\nzapateados needs very fancy footwork; the compas speeds up, slows down, and speeds up again and is a showcase for dancers (zapato means shoes).
