        "text": "From shabi to zhuang bi to yabi,\n\nwith reference to diaosi, sang, tangping, and neijuan\n\nSource.\n\nIn a post on an enigmatic shop-sign in pinyin I’ve written about the useful term shabi (“fuckwit”), followed in Changing language by zhuang bi (“poseur”). Subcultures have thrived ever since the 1980s’ reforms, but have taken off with the internet. There’s some impressive coverage of popular recent buzzwords reflecting countercultural trends of disillusionment, from “loser” (diaosi 屌丝) and “mourner” (sang 丧) cultures to “lying flat” (tangping 躺平). Of course, like the subaltern subjects of Xu Tong’s films, such news makes a welcome counterpoint to reports on the glorious triumphs of the latest Party Plenary session.\n\nThe progression of these concepts is the subject of a substantial article by Zhu Ying and Peng Junqi, “From diaosi to sang to tangping: the Chinese DST youth subculture online” (2024). We corduroyed, monocled professor types [Speak for yourself—Ed.] may find the distinctions between such tribes as arcane as their own jaded adherents will regard the taxonomy of ritual segments of a Daoist funeral. (For “mourner” culture—apathy, rejection of the treadmill—see e.g. here; “lying flat”, subject of another Sixth tone article, struck me as a potential wacky Olympic sport. See also this article by David Cowhig.)\n\nAn interview with anthropologist Xiang Biao and a New Yorker article by Yi-Ling Liu further introduce “involution” (neijuan 内卷)—feelings of burnout, ennui, and despair. Xiang Biao scores points (with me, at least) for alluding to Prasenjit Duara’s theory of state involution. He refers to the pressures of Confucianism, but I haven’t seen wuwei cited as prototypes for the dropout generation, or early Daoist recluses such as the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove.\n\nThe Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove.\n\nAlienation has always been a theme of Chinese culture. Under Maoist campaigns, one finds hints in the memoir of Kang Zhengguo and it’s evident in much fiction, as well as the films of Jia Zhangke, masterpieces of small-town ennui in the early years of reform. Still, returning to the internet age,\n\nAccording to Professor Huang [Ping], lying down can be seen as the opposite of involution—a decades-old academic term referring to societies becoming trapped in ceaseless cycles of competition that resurfaced last year [2020] as an online buzzword in China. “In a relatively good social environment, people may feel involuted, but at least they’re trying,” he said. “If it’s worse, people will tangping.”\n\nAnd Yi-Ling Liu observes tellingly:\n\nChina’s crisis is unique in the severity of its myopia and its methods of entrapment. The young high schooler, disillusioned with the monotony of school, cannot easily access subversive subcultures or explore alternative ways of living, because, increasingly, that information is deemed “vulgar” or “immoral” and banned by the government, scrubbed from the digital sphere in the name of “promoting positive energy.” The delivery driver, seeking better working conditions, can’t protest his grievances or organize his fellow workers in an independent union, because he rightly fears that he will be detained. The disillusioned office worker, instead of taking action, will more likely sink deeper into his desk chair. Involution is a new word that helps keep an old system, and those who control it, in place.\n\n* * *\n\nFor the new kid on the ennui block, Made in China journal has an intriguing article by Casey Wei, “The involution of freedom in yabi subculture”, with analyses based on class and gender as well as a useful list of further readings.\n\nIn yabi 亚逼 the bi is shabide bi, prefixed by ya (Asia, inferior: the “sub” of yawenhua 亚文化, “subcultures” that develop among “like-minded people” 同温层 tongwenceng). * Yabi signifies “subcultural resistance under a heavily repressed authoritarian regime, […] a post-internet hotchpotch, influenced by (but not limited to) punk, otaku, e-girl, cybergoth, K-pop and J-pop, Asian babygirl, hip-hop, rave, and techno styles from across the globe”. I’m not sure how relevant are Wei’s ambitious historical perspectives on the “feminine supernatural”, from early imperial history through to the Maoist era (“From goddesses and fox spirits to Holding up half the sky”).\n\nI like the opening line of Made in China’s Twitter blurb for the article:\n\nThe yabi subculture is often deemed messy and superficial.\n\nAnyway, I’ve penned a couple more haiku (see here):\n\nSo much for wuwei\n\nLying flat is so old hat\n\nTime now for yabi\n\nNot gonna zhuang bi\n\nLie flat, fold in?—bit too much\n\nI’m just a shabi\n\n* * *\n\nEven in our own societies, it’s a challenge to absorb changing culture and language, all the more so with the explosion of digital media. In analysing Brahms manuscripts or medieval Daoist ritual manuals, the ivory tower of academia is estranged from the practical issues of Real Life. Moreover, the vocabulary of those of us who make intermittent study visits to somewhere like China is always going to be partial, based not only on our particular study topics (political, cultural, and so on) but also on our early exposure, and we may find it hard to keep up with a rapidly changing society. **\n\nI have no illusions that I could possibly keep up with UK youth culture (see Staving off old age, Cleo Sol, New British jazz, and so on). Still, chagrin and curiosity combine to encourage us to learn just how far we have fallen behind; and however traditional the topics we study in China, the attitudes of new generations will be influential. Even if we’re hoping to “salvage” Daoist ritual, our fieldwork takes place not in a social vacuum but within an ever-changing context. With the slogans of Maoism long replaced, popular culture and urban ennui seep into rural values, as grandchildren surf their phones on visits back to the countryside to attend family funerals.\n\n* * *\n\nEven ethnomusicologists documenting traditional culture need an overview of urban soundscapes and the wider cultures in which they mingle (OK, I’ll say it—”in the urban bazaar”) (note The hidden musicians)—Istanbul, for instance, is far more than genteel Ottoman ensembles, the call to prayer, and Alevi ritual, as rap replaces arabesque… Whereas the Anglo-American “classical” and pop worlds manage to ignore each other, it’s worth registering the musical diversity of Beijing and Shanghai in the 1930s and 1990s, popular genres (e.g. Shanghai jazz, and New musics in Beijing) co-existing with drum-singing, silk-and-bamboo, Daoist ritual, the qin zither, and indeed WAM (see e.g. Fou Ts’ong).\n\n* My own coterie being those who will be amused when I identify which kou character I’m referring to by explaining “Yuqie yankoude kou“. Speaking of ya 亚, I love the creative misgrouping of the elements in Lunda YaFei xueyuan 伦大亚非学院 (SOAS) by one of the Li family Daoists!\n\n** Again, my personal lexicon remains based on an incongruous mix of folk ritual terminology and the trite political slogans of the 1950s’ village Party Secretary (here, under “Rapport”).\n\nwith a not entirely meretricious fantasy on world-music Passions…\n\n©BBC/Mark Allan. Source: Artsdesk review.\n\nThis year is the 300th anniversary of the Leipzig premiere of Bach’s John Passion. * After John Butt’s performance at the 2017 Proms (more links to the Passions here), I’ve just returned to hear it with Masaaki Suzuki (b.1954) directing the Bach Collegium Japan, which he has led since 1990 (listen here—with an instructive interval talk thankfully replacing the interminable original sermon). Whereas performers these days know the work intimately, it must have been a serious challenge for Bach’s Leipzig forces (cf. this post); even to today’s listener it still sounds startingly modern—imagine how it must have sounded to the 1724 congregation!\n\nHaving studied with Ton Koopman in Amsterdam, Suzuki became a leading advocate for the early music movement in Japan. Joining several other complete recordings of the Bach cantatas (links here), his cycle with BCJ was completed in 2014. It’s most remiss of me not to have kept up, missing Suzuki’s previous visits to London, both with his own ensemble and as guest conductor of the Age of Enlightenment. Far from inscrutable, his style is dramatic, expressive, rather evoking that of Koopman, or perhaps Richard Egarr—both of whom direct from the keyboard, whereas Suzuki has gravitated to conducting from the podium, leaving the harpischord and organ to dedicated musicians (given which, he might go further and cede close control over the recitatives?).\n\nBold idea of the programme booklet: Edvard Munch’s Golgotha (1900),\n\nin which he represented himself as the Christ figure,\n\nwith the foreground figures casted as the seven deadly sins. Source: wiki.\n\nBenjamin Bruns was the Evangelist to Christian Immler’s imposing Jesus. The choir sounded fabulous, with twenty singers in an arc, including soloists who emerged for the arias. Carolyn Sampson (whom I used to accompany on Bach tours with The Sixteen) was exquisite in Zerfließe, mein Herze, as was Alexander Chance in the counter-tenor arias—succeeding his father Michael, whose singing, such as Erbarme dich, enriched our own performances with John Eliot Gardiner; excellent too were Yusuke Watanabe and Shimon Yoshida. Following HIP style, Suzuki favours small instrumental forces—wackily augmented by a towering contrabassoon (as in Bach’s fourth version); oboes and flutes, seated front stage on the right, were well highlighted.\n\nBenjamin Bruns, Christian Immler, Masaaki Suzuki.\n\n©BBC/Mark Allan. Source: Bachtrack review (with the fine heading “Promenading on Golgotha”).\n\nSuzuki and BCJ have long experience of performing and recording Bach (watch a John Passion from 2000 here); their Proms visit this week was part of a European tour—it’s a highly seasoned, accomplished ensemble.\n\nNothing can compare to the awe of being plunged into the opening chorus, with throbbing, turbulent strings overlaid by anguished suspensions on oboes.\n\nReturning to the Bach Passions regularly over a lifetime (referring, perhaps, to Gardiner’s Music in the Castle of Heaven) is an essential part of our self-cultivation.\n\n* * *\n\nIn This Day and Age™ there’s nothing remarkable about a Japanese ensemble excelling in Bach; even if we can resist projecting orientalist fantasies (with Suzuki as Zen Sage-Mystic), their taste for Historically Informed Performance somehow seems quite appropriate. Perhaps no-one else will even think of gagaku, another genre that was imported, from Tang China—and then radically slowed down until it was no longer recognisable.\n\nI’ve long had a fantasy of staging a world-music version of the Passions (cf. Bach, um, marches towards the world), held at a cosmic site like the Grand Canyon (cf. Messiaen). Amidst sand mandalas, the Dalai Lama with his own halo of deep-chanting Tibetan monks accompanied by their cymbals, drums, and booming long trumpets, as well as ethereal ondes martenot or theremin… Mark Padmore sharing the role of Evangelist with a searing cante jondo singer… Uyghur bowed satar and Persian ney flute as obbligato instruments for the arias, a gamelan to embellish the choruses, and the catharsis of an Alevi sema… One day I’ll do a detailed programme, unfettered by funding or logistics.\n\nA slightly less daunting project would be a Japanese staging of the Passions based on Noh drama. As continuo to the pilgrim/Evangelist visiting the site of an ancient mystery, the dialogue of the two drums, their eery kakegoe cries summoning the spiritual world… the Noh chorus both evoking the crowd and offering redemption… Augmented by the timbre of gagaku, magically transforming the wind music of the choruses and arias (Bach’s own timbre for Zerfließe is already not so distant—and with an archlute joining the continuo, the affinity would be even closer). While some Westerners have trained intensively in Noh, it’s more common, and must be easier, for Japanese musicians to learn to perform Bach (cf. Jazz in post-war Japan)—though it might be hard to find musicians who would be up to (or up for) the task.\n\nAt the heart of both these stagings will be Bach’s original music, devotedly illuminated by compatible traditions from around the world.\n\nSee also under my roundup of posts on Japanese culture—including some spellbinding Bach on a mile-long xylophone in an empty forest!\n\n* After all this time, I still have reservations about my choice to imitate Bach’s original omission of the “St” before John Passion (Passio secundum Joannem) and Matthew Passion (Matthäus-Passion, or even Passio Domini nostri J.C. secundum Evangelistam Matthæum), with its apparent breezy familiarity—”The name’s Matthew, but call me Matt”). But Was ich geschrieben habe, das habe ich geschrieben, as Pilate observed pithily (a foretaste of “It’s what it is”, suggesting that Robert De Niro might be well cast for the role, albeit too late to join John Wayne as centurion for the crucifixion).\n\nThey come over ’ere…\n\nOn the recommendation of Satnam Sanghera’s Empireland, I’ve been reading\n\nRobert Winder, Bloody foreigners: the story of immigration to Britain (2004, with new chapter for the 2013 edition).\n\nAs I write, it’s a horribly topical theme—but it always is (for Winder’s thoughts on this month’s riots, click here).\n\nImmigration has always been a “nuanced and uneven affair”. Migrants are diverse; loyalties can be fluid and overlapping. While Britain has a chronic history of race riots, social unrest has varied. But “the political language remains morose”, irrational—venting prejudice rather than debate. Emigration “strikes us as daring and sprightly […] yet we habitually see immigrants not as brave voyagers but as needy beggars”. Britain has been both resistant and accommodating, with successive assimilations, new prejudices, routine kindness, and adaptability. Besides all the unsung workers who keep the economy afloat, immigration has long invigorated our institutions, architecture, music, literature, and our very language; “immigration is a form of enrichment and renewal”. But Bloody foreigners is no naive celebration; of course it’s a plea for tolerance, but Winder offers no simple solutions.\n\nEven in recent times (in the war-inspired propaganda of the 20th century, for instance) we have cultivated a belief in Britain as unconquerable; mighty forces such as the Spanish Armada, Napoleon’s war machine, and the Luftwaffe, we told ourselves, failed to breach our ramshackle but resolute defences. This indoctrination has left a false but distinct impression that we have never been invaded. Indeed, the famous insularity of the British is often attributed to the fact that we do not, unlike our continental friends, have a folk memory of foreign occupation. But this means only that our memories are short and unreliable, because our early history is one of little else.\n\nOn the eve of the Norman conquest,\n\nWhat we now think of as the archetypal English character was already, at this early stage, a robust mixture of Mediterranean, Celtic, Saxon, Roman, Jute, Angle, Danish, and Norwegian, all moulded and rain-streaked by the British climate and landscape.\n\nTraders, craftspeople, entrepreneurs, artisans, and heretics all began finding a home in Britain, and were resisted. Among many disturbances, what Winder describes as a “race riot” erupted in Norwich in 1312, attacking foreign traders, mainly Flemish and Walloon weavers. Chapter 3 relates the prospering of the Jews and pogroms leading up to their expulsion in 1290—“both a tragedy and a national disgrace”. Chapter 4, “Onlie to seek woorck”, tells how migrants filled a gap in the labour market left by the 1348 Black Death. Gypsies arrived from around 1500, also suffering discrimination. By this time there were 3,000 foreigners in London, 6% of the civic population. In towns like Sandwich and Canterbury as much as a third of the population were immigrants, both bringing prosperity and causing antagonism.\n\nThe luckless foreigners incurred the wrath of the locals in two contrasting ways: they were hated if they became rich, and even more if they remained poor. If wealthy, they were gimlet-eyed exploiters; if starving, they were good-for-nothing trespassers.\n\nConcluding a section on the Jews who found a haven from the 1648 pogroms in Ukraine, Winder has a prophetic comment:\n\nIn its bumbling way, England was providing a precious sanctuary for those persecuted in brasher countries. Soon however, this newfound tolerance would be tested on a scale never before imagined.\n\nFrench Huguenots:\n\nLeft, refugees landing at Dover in 1685, engraving by Godefroy Durand, 1885 (source).\n\nRight, Hogarth, Noon, 1736 (source)—\n\nWinder’s caption: “Affluent Huguenot churchgoers tiptoe past the ill-kempt natives”.\n\nHuguenots (one of the most inspired vignettes in Stewart Lee’s debunking of UKIP! cf. Rachel Parris) had fled persecution after the 1572 St Bartholomew’s Day massacre, but the main influx began from the late 17th century. Along with their expertise in making clothes, hats, paper, pins, needles, watches, clocks, and shoes, they possessed financial and mercantile skills. [1] The Huguenot merchants\n\nprobably thought of themselves as working temporarily from the London office. The rest were waiting for civilisation to return to France so that they could go home and pick up the threads of their former lives. This is true of a great many immigrants, even today. Immigration, indeed, might be a rather grandiose unequivocal word for what is often a diffident decision, full of hesitations and reluctant compromises. The drip-drip process of acclimatisation becomes immigration only in retrospect. […]\n\nThe Huguenot exodus was torrid, and only with the benefit of several hundred years’ distance can it strike us as inspiring. But from that vantage-point we can hardly deny that they came, saw, and prospered. Nor that “we”, after a certain amount of bluster and some clenched-fist bitterness, in the end accepted them without much more than a murmur.\n\nUnder the Hanoverian empire (George I, “most important immigrant of the 18th century—according to the traditional definition of what counts as important”), Germans came to Britain to work as businessmen and artisans; German architects, playwrights, and musicians played a major role in our cultural life. Migrants arrived from Holland, France, Poland, Italy, and the British colony of India; the population of Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews kept growing.\n\nChapter 9, “Servants and slaves”, describes the African slave trade and its immense profits—a story of coercion that contrasts with the choices of previous generations of immigrants.\n\n18th-century England was home to several thousand Africans who carried messages, steered horses through crowds, cooked, swept, busked, scrimped, saved, gambled, drank, slipped into secret doorways, clenched their teeth and cowered in fear, all in plain view of so-called polite society. Most social histories of the period see it as a time of elegant country houses, […] a neoclassical arcadia, in short, shot through with bolts of sexy exuberance, gluttony, and inventive industry.\n\nAfricans in Britain were “living among those who were growing rich on their suffering”. Winder sifts the piecemeal material on their shadowy lives. Slavery and racism reinforced each other: “through the slave trade, hostility to foreigners achieved a clearer definition”. (One theme that I dared broach: as the fortepiano was becoming an emblem of gentility, the trade in slaves and ivory must have played a role in the colour reversal of its keys—see Black and white).\n\nThrough the Victorian era (another German lineage), Britain continued to provide refuge for cliques of intellectual refugees from Italy, Germany, Hungary, and Poland—”not tolerance so much as indifference”. Meanwhile Winder offers some “industrial revelations”. By 1871 Germans were the largest foreign-born minority in Britain, with roughly 50,000 living here by the end of the century, lured by the industrial boom and freedom from state interference.\n\nChapter 12 is devoted to “Little Italy”—subject of a forthcoming post. From unsanitary lodgings around Clerkenwell, puppeteers, pantomime artistes, and jesters worked the streets. Juvenile organ-grinders led wretched lives, subject to ruthless exploitation by padroni gangmasters, the street urchins bolstering anti-Italian prejudice. In a process of what would be called “chain migration”, service industries emerged: besides instrument makers, delicatessens and restaurants started a revolution in Britain’s eating habits. Italian schools, churches, and barbers were also established. By the early 20th century the “barrel-organ menace” was a remote memory.\n\nNext Winder turns to the influx of the Irish, with around 400,000 arriving in the wake of the 1840s’ potato famine—“penniless, unhealthy, unshod, and unclean, few immigrants have been less welcome”. Though they made a source of cheap labour, resentment at their presence also revived religious sectarianism, and riots were common.\n\nThe police, urged on by a sensationalist or malicious public opinion, moved in to confront the hard core, but ended up having pitched battles with the disaffected residents.\n\nWinder sifts through the stereotypes prompting such enmity, noting a significant middle-class component and assimilation. “From unpromising beginnings the Irish developed into a success story”.\n\nEast London, 1890. Source.\n\nIn 1889 the Shah Jahan mosque was built at Woking, the first in the country, commissioned by the orientalist Dr Leitner, a Hungarian Jew. A new influx came in the 1890s with around 150,000 Jewish evacuees from the pogroms of Tsarist Russia—some prospering while others toiled in murky sweatshops. The anti-immigration lobby grew; fears of being “swamped” had little justification: “between 1871 and 1910, nearly two million Britons emigrated, far more than the number who arrived”. “Lascars”, a broad term for “Asiatic” seamen, established communities in Liverpool, London, and other ports; Chinatowns began to form. Meanwhile “religion, science, and philosophy joined hands to offer a new vocabulary for racial antipathy”.\n\nDuring World War One anti-German feeling ran high, egged on by the popular press. Like Satnam Sanghera and Fatima Manji, Winder reminds us of the major contribution of Indian soldiers on the battlefield. But\n\nThe First World War was the first time that Britain’s working class had travelled overseas in numbers, and when it returned home, it brought with it a sharpened hatred of all things foreign.\n\nStill, foreign food seemed attractive. Curry had already appeared on the menu of a coffee house in the Haymarket in 1773, and in Hidden heritage Fatima Manji notes a short-lived curry-house in 1810—with a delivery service, to boot. Winder goes on:\n\nIn 1931 the Bombay Emporium opened near the Tottenham Court Road, providing the first glimmer of what would later become an indispensable part of British life: the Asian shop. In Portobello, you could buy curry powder, poppadoms, and mango chutney.\n\nSeveral Indian restaurants opened in Soho, as well as in Glasgow and Cambridge—the beginnings of another culinary revolution. By 1970 there were 2,000 Indian restaurants in Britain (cf. Musical joke-dating).\n\nWinder constantly notes both the stars of industry and culture, and the wretched lives of the exploited sweatshop labourers. Between the wars, new arrivals came from Africa and the Caribbean, mostly students. National independence movements grew. In the 1930s a surge of arrivals from the Irish Free State went largely unopposed. Between 1933 and 1939, some 60,000 Jewish refugees managed to reach Britain—including a dazzling array of cultural figures. Still, anti-Semitism, if “only a pale flaring of the venomous feelings in continental Europe”, was substantial. Nicolas Winton’s Kindertransport stood in rebuke to the British government’s exclusionary policies.\n\nThough Britain’s colonial troops again played a major role in World War Two, fear of aliens was again reinforced. Britain recognised its debt to Polish troops, whose naturalisation after the war attracted little controversy. The following waves of immigrants were not so lucky.\n\n* * *\n\nWhile all this early history is fascinating, it tends to recede from memory as the story enters the period since World War Two. These were desperate times in Britain, as on the continent (see Lowe, Savage continent). Amidst a labour shortage, the substantial new wave of Irish immigrants was accepted, as were Italian workers—the official beginning of our affair with Italian restaurants and fancy coffee machines. But British racism was clear. The term “immigrants” was fast becoming a polite euphemism for “coloured people”. The popularity of black American troops stationed in Britain during the war had been temporary.\n\nThe 1948 Nationality Act gave all imperial subjects the right of free entry to Britain. Despite Britain’s postwar poverty, this seemed a tempting opportunity to a fraction of those now entitled to do so. The voyage of the Empire Windrush attracted much publicity (and anxiety), but it didn’t create a surge of similar voyages; only after 1954 did the exodus gather pace, with London Transport initiating a recruitment drive in 1956. The new West Indian arrivals, though few in number, were unpopular. Caricatures represented by Enid Blyton were being ingrained in children—and their parents.\n\nOver the next decade nearly a quarter of a million migrants arrived from the Caribbean, India, Africa, and Hong Kong, making their way “to the country whose authority they were at last shrugging off”. Migrants were unwelcome in all but the poorest neighbourhoods. Jobs were available, but trade unions were largely hostile; housing was a source of exploitation. The migrants soon became disenchanted with their drab, hostile new home. The government seemed to have no plan:\n\nIt declined to take any overzealous measures to prevent immigration, while refusing also to stand up for the migrants themselves.\n\nFrom India came Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims. Cypriots and Hungarians fled conflict in their home countries. By 1958 the Home Office estimated that there were 210,000 people from the Commonwealth living and working in Britain, three-quarters of them male. Racist resentment grew; teddy boys, egged on by Oswald Mosley, caused havoc.\n\nWhereas male workers had formed the core of previous migrants, the 1962 Commonwealth Immigrants Act (“a preference for muddle over clarity, a refusal to be entirely guided by the promptings of either conscience or prejudice”) led indirectly to the consolidation of migrant families and communities. They became more assertive.\n\nKenyan Asians found refuge from 1967, and then Ugandan Asians from 1970. But emigration also soared through the 1960s. As tourism and package holidays took off, more Italian and Mediterranean migrants arrived. By 1971 there were a million Irish migrants, who no longer prompted resentment—though the anti-German temperament endured, recalled by my orchestral colleague Hildi.\n\nMigrants arrived from India and Pakistan, working in factories and setting up corner shops. As National Front youths indulged in “Paki-bashing” rampages, Brick lane, its population now largely from Bangladesh, again became a centre of racist violence.\n\nThe Chinese takeaway was becoming a national institution, largely staffed by migrants from Hong Kong. From 50 Chinese restaurants in 1957, numbers grew to 4,000 in 1970 (at a time when there were around 500 French restaurants!). In Sour sweet Timothy Mo gives a gripping fictional portrayal of the Chinese immigrant experience (cf. Ray Man). Despite the common complaint that newcomers refused to “fit in”,\n\nThe group of immigrants who made the least effort of all to fit in were the Chinese, who kept themselves to themselves and socialised almost entirely within their own families. Yet they were the least disliked. They kept their distance, and Britain seemed to like it just fine that way.\n\nThe Thatcher era from 1979 exacerbated relations. Still, her government soon had to accept 15,000 Vietnamese boat people, rescuing them from “the twin evils of communism and drowning”. Riots took place in Brixton, Toxteth, and Southall. While noting the violence unleashed between different communities from the Indian subcontinent, Winder observes that no-one liked to admit that “Britain’s urban culture was itself incorrigibly tough and brawling”. The terms “ethnic minorities” and “multiculturalism” came into use; schooling and religious instruction became hotly-debated issues. But\n\nNo-one could deny by now that Britain’s railways, hospitals, shops, cafés, and restaurants would have ceased to function without migrant workers.\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet bloc regimes, along with ongoing crises around the world, led to new surges. Fundamentalist Islam, the Rushdie affair, and 9/11 posed yet another challenge to Britain’s tolerance of migrants. In 2005 the 7th July suicide bombings in London reinvigorated Islamophobic sentiments in some quarters and made others question the nation’s cosmopolitanism. But somehow a violent backlash was avoided.\n\nDistinctions collapsed between refugees, asylum-seekers, and economic migrants. Measures of successive governments became more draconian while the processing system descended into chaos. The idea that Britain might benefit from migration held little sway. The mass media “seemed eager not just to report discord but to sow it”. The “debate”, if it can be called that, was (and remains) rancid and polarised.\n\nLeaving aside the barmier claims that migrants are all disease-ridden, criminally inclined scoundrels who have no place in our well-mannered, sceptred land, there is a sensible argument that they have been arriving on a scale that stretches our strained welfare resources, provokes social unease (true, though holding the migrants alone responsible is mischievous) and provides, in some cases, cover and opportunity for criminals. The opposing argument states that the demonisation of asylum-seekers is both vindictive and misjudged. It looks at a system that imprisons young children for months, and concludes that we are neglecting our moral duty. It suggests that asylum-seekers bring cultural enrichment as well as entrepreneurial drive: above all, they are individuals striving to live by our own ideals for self-improvement and betterment.\n\nThe awkward thing about these two extreme views is that they are both true, or contain truth. Immigrants are not all the same. They represent the full spectrum of human types: dreamers and schemers, rascals and rogues, saints and villains.\n\nFor the 2013 edition Winder added the chapter “Choppy waters”, with the Conclusion “Identity Parade”. Though forecasters wildly underestimated the number of those who would take advantage of the 2004 enlargement of the EU to come to Britain, it didn’t submerge the island—and it did provide us with a new generation of trusty Polish workers. Many of the new arrivals didn’t intend to stay.\n\nOn nostalgic portraits of English life by Betjeman and Orwell, Winder comments\n\nPeople who contrive thumbnail sketches of national identity are usually lamenting the passing of their own youth, the fraying of the iconography with which they grew up.\n\nHe ponders issues of identity and belonging, observing that statistics are unreliable and open to conflicting interpretations. Aware of the problems of segregation, Winder is not uncritical of multiculturalism. He explores whether integration and diversity are mutually exclusive.\n\n* * *\n\nSo I’m not sure quite what we can learn here from the famous Lesson of History. In the Preface to the 2013 edition, Winder explains:\n\nI was not seeking to imply that Britain owes everything to immigration; I was merely drawing attention to a common oversight, which was that the role played by immigrants in the story of Britain has been understated and overlooked. […]\n\nEven if entrenched communities were open to such messages, they might hardly profit from realising that we’ve always been both xenophobic and hospitable, or that migrants assimilate eventually. Still, it’s highly necessary to press the case, and among the vast literature on the topic beyond the rabid pages of the Daily Hatemail, this is a great place to start.\n\nNote also the Migration museum in Lewisham. Cf. Hidden heritage, Vermeer’s hat, and Pomodoro!.\n\n[1] Reflecting the history of migration, a 1743 Huguenot church in Brick Lane became a synagogue in 1898 (after an interlude as a Wesleyan chapel), and then a mosque in 1976 (see also this site).\n\n*Part of my strangely extensive jazz series!*\n\nSource.\n\nSuch is my devotion to Billie Holiday that I’ve never quite been able to warm to Nina Simone (1933–2003). But my interest has been revived by listening with rapt admiration to Feeling good (1965). It opens with an all-too-brief free-tempo alap, brusquely interrupted by the incongruous sleazy riff: *\n\nThe title isn’t so ironic as it sounds. Written by (white) English composers Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse for the musical The roar of the greasepaint—the smell of the crowd, satirising the British class system, the UK premiere was given by Cy Grant in the role of “the Negro” singing the song as he “wins” the game; i t was described as a “booming song of emancipation”. When the show transferred to New York the following year, the role was taken by Gilbert Price. Nina utterly transforms the song, but the optimism of its lyrics is remote from the activist songs that were becoming the core of her repertoire just at that time.\n\n* * *\n\nWithin the milieu of the day, few musicians were angels. Jazz biographies from the, um, Golden Age tend to follow a depressingly familiar trajectory of self-destruction: pain, drugs, exploitation, disastrous choice of partners, violence, disillusion, and legal woes. Despite all these features, Miles’s autobiography is strangely inspiring, tough but never helpless (for a lengthy sample, see Miles meets Bird). White musos could be no less self-destructive—few more so than Chet Baker.\n\nFor Nina, besides wiki and ninasimone.com, I’ve been reading\n\nDavid Brun-Lambert, Nina Simone: the biography (2005).\n\nAmong documentaries is Nina Simone: the legend (Frank Lords, 1991), What happened, Miss Simone? (Liz Garbus, 2015; trailer), and The amazing Nina Simone (Jeff L. Lieberman, 2015; trailer).\n\nThe sixth of eight children in a poor North Carolina family, Nina was a child prodigy at the piano; “Bach made me dedicate my life to music”. After graduating from high school in 1950, she seemed destined to become “the first black American concert pianist”. So the original, lasting, deep wound in her psyche was being refused admission to study at Curtis—which she attributed to racism. Thwarted in her classical ambitions, she continued to study privately with Curtis professor Vladimir Sokoloff for several years, funded with a regular gig at a nightclub in Atlantic City—only taking up singing because the job demanded it.\n\nWhile Nina’s classical piano training would later give her a cachet among respectable white audiences, I seem to have reservations about singers accompanying themselves at the piano, like Ray Charles. Distinctive and original as her playing was (e.g. her “destabilising” 1969 album Nina Simone and piano), it was at a tangent from jazz: stark, based on melody, hardly admitting any harmonic interest—by contrast with her cohorts in the jazz scene like Monk, Herbie Hancock, or Bill Evans. But this musical simplicity threw greater focus on her political message.\n\nBy the late 50s, as her career was taking off, her dream of fame as a classical pianist had evaporated. The civil rights movement was growing. In Greenwich Village she began hanging out with James Baldwin, Langston Hughes, LeRoi Jones, and Lorraine Hansberry. Her 1961 visit to Lagos with Baldwin, Hughes, and others as part of a delegation of the American Society for African Culture was her first time in Africa.\n\nNow married to a violent husband and manager, she gave birth to her daughter in 1962. Her entry into the civil rights struggle was embodied in her 1963 song Mississippi goddam. Nina’s activism, and the wider civil rights background, is extensively covered by Brun-Lambert, with detail on her involvement with Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam, Miriam Makeba, the Black Panthers, riots, marches, and the whole ferment in black popular music through the 1960s.\n\nBy 1970, exhausted and disillusioned, Nina seemed to have reached the end of the road. In later life she largely avoided the USA for fear of legal battles; while still touring, she sought refuge in Barbados, Liberia, Switzerland, Holland, and France, lonely and estranged from her daughter, her relationships fraught and short-lived; among a succession of managers, some had better intentions than others. Her mood-swings and behaviour on and off stage had long been volatile, becoming ever more apparent; the diagnosis of bipolar disorder was belated. Brun-Lambert describes her as “leading a double artistic life, unable to find her own place anywhere”.\n\n* * *\n\nTurning to Nina’s songs—as ever, there’s a vast selection on YouTube, notably this channel—below I give a mere sample.\n\nIn her early years she sounds benign enough, like the New York Town Hall concert in September 1959, “still without trace of savagery or sexuality”, as Brun-Lambert puts it:\n\nStill, her interpretations, such as Summertime, are distinctive. Billie Holiday had died in July that year; a couple of years earlier she had immortalised Fine and mellow in the most enthralling TV film ever. Nina sang it for her Town Hall finale.\n\n“Her first song with explicitly black consciousness” was Flo Me La at the Newport festival in 1960 (from 20.52):\n\nAmong several appearances at Carnegie Hall, here’s her 1964 concert (as playlist):\n\nThe programme introduced activist songs such as Old Jim Crow, Go limp, and Mississippi goddam into the genteel surroundings. And she is just right for Brecht/Weill songs like Pirate Jenny!\n\nSinging The house of the rising sun at the Village Gate in 1961, she sounds rather mellifluous:\n\nBy 1968, live at the Bitter End Café, her voice is harsher and more experimental:\n\nThe final number on her troubled 1965 album Pastel blues (here, as playlist) is Sinnerman, “about despair, disenchantment, disillusionment in the face of a situation that offers no alternatives but flight or prayer” (Brun-Lambert). Before that comes Strange fruit, just as visceral as Billie’s 1939 recording and 1959 performance. Nina’s concert in Antibes that year included some songs from the forthcoming album—opening with a disjointed intro that segues into Strange fruit:\n\nAnd here’s Four women, live in 1965:\n\nAfter the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968, she sang Why? (The king of love is dead)—here’s a full version live that year:\n\nIn 1967 she recorded I wish I knew how it would feel to be free—here’s her 1976 Montreux performance:\n\nAgain, I find some of these casual piano accompaniments, and even her voice, disconcerting—but maybe that’s the point.\n\nThat’s probably enough to outline the story of Nina’s heyday; in her later career she largely repeated such standards—after the original creative impetus had diluted, and as her mental troubles escalated. She had been touring in England since 1967—it’s worth hearing her live at Ronnie’s in 1985:\n\nTo encapsulate ecstasy and pain, for me it’s always going to be Billie… I may be romanticising the devotion of jazzers to their art (cf. the wonderful image of Donald Byrd practising on the subway), but I detect no inkling of any such devotion in Nina: any musical discipline that she practised seems to have been at the keyboard. She formed no bonds with her fellow musicians.\n\nWhile one gets little impression that she honed her vocal skills, in early recordings like Black is the color of my true love’s hair and Wild is the wind (in the 1959 Town Hall concert) she sounds genuinely intimate, even sweet—far removed from her later image. Still, music is about society: Nina’s voice developed into a genuine expression of the troubled times, part of the necessarily strident style that emerged from the civil rights struggle.\n\nUnder A jazz medley, see e.g. Green book, Detroit 67 and Memphis 68, as well as A Hollywood roundtable, The Tulsa race massacre, and Black and white.\n\n* Feeling good has been much covered—rather than featuring other versions, here’s Trane in 1965:\n\nAnd although nothing can compare with the raw emotion of being black in those years, here’s Andrea Motis in 2012:\n\nNot being pedantic or anything [Uh-oh—Ed.], the title seems to be cited more commonly as Feeling good than as Feelin’ good (zzzzz). Cf. I got a woman, note here.\n\nRuth Finnegan, The hidden musicians: music-making in an English town\n\n(first edition 1989, revised 2007).\n\nIn several posts I’ve praised Finnegan’s classic work en passant—and revisiting it now, I find it even more impressive. I struggle to encapsulate its virtues without citing every paragraph.\n\nIts subject is local grass-roots musicking in Milton Keynes, mainly at the amateur end of the amateur–professional continuum, so often taken for granted. It’s a model of participant observation: Finnegan was a long-term resident of the area, with most of her material collected from 1980 to 1984. Writing in an accessible style, she constantly debunks facile assumptions.\n\nHaving started out by studying oral performance in Africa, Finnegan now embarked on a project concerning doorstep (rather than armchair) ethnomusicology. The hidden musicians soon became core reading for the ethnomusicological study of musicking in Western societies, including Western Art Music (for which she abides by the traditional term “classical music”).\n\nAn attention to “ordinary musicians” was already implicit in the ethnomusicological approach to more “exotic” societies (note Bruno Nettl’s masterly survey of the field), but it is all the more revealing for a culture so near to home. In The hidden musicians, references to research on other world cultures, standard for such studies, might have been instructive, but the economy of theory and jargon is welcome. Among Finnegan’s main inspirations is Howard Becker’s 1982 study Art worlds. In 2022 her work inspired a BFE conference (in Milton Keynes, to boot, where the Open University is fortuitously based) on “ordinary musicians”, addressing topics in societies around the world.\n\nThe opening of the book anticipates that of Christopher Small’s Musicking (1998), observing the diverse ways in which music-making pervades people’s lives. Like Small, she focuses on “musical practices (what people do), not musical works (the ‘texts’ of music)”—seeking processes rather than products. She finds “an invisible but organised system” that lies at the heart of our cultural lives.\n\nAfter an important chapter unpacking gradations on the amateur–professional continuum, in Part Two Finnegan outlines the diverse yet overlapping musical worlds of classical music, brass bands, folk music (including ceilidh and Morris bands), musical theatre (amateur operatic societies, panto, and so on), jazz, Country and Western, rock and pop. She disputes the “mass society” theory that ”envisages a passive and deluded population lulled by the mass media and generating nothing themselves”, as well as simplistic socio-economic or age-based analyses. She challenges assumptions, such as “high culture”, and, taking a descriptive rather than prescriptive approach, she finds\n\nseveral different musical worlds, […] each having its own contrasting conventions about the proper modes of learning, transmission, composition, or performance. Because the pre-eminent position of classical music so often goes without saying, the existence of these differing musics has often simply been ignored.\n\nIf the pre-eminence of classical music was only notional by the 1980s, her material does indeed seem to confirm this unspoken assumption. Conversely, social scientists have emphasised “popular” or “lower-class” activities such as rock. But\n\neach musical tradition—classical, rock, jazz, or whatever—can be studied in its own right. When no longer judged by the criteria of others, each emerges as in principle equally authentic and equally influential in shaping the practices of local music.\n\nPart Three, “Contrasts and comparisons” opens with an insightful chapter on learning music (cf. the Growing into music film project). While Finnegan largely concurs with the notional dichotomy in training between the worlds of classical and popular musics, she notes commonalities. “Performances and their conditions” perceptively compares the conventions of events belonging to different musical worlds, noting aspects such as preparation and audience behaviour. In “Composition, creativity, and performance” she investigates degrees of dependence on written texts (cf. studies of “improvisation”, for which we can again consult Nettl as a handy guide). And in Chapter 14, preparing the ground for her later metaphor of “pathways”, Finnegan refines the concept of musical “worlds”, noting their plurality, with a certain overlap, and wider connections further afield; they are “relative, shifting, and situational”.\n\nPart Four, “The organisation and work of local music”, contains chapters on the home and school; the churches; clubs and pubs; a case study on the organisation and administration of the Sherwood Choir; small working bands; resources, rewards, and support (including music shops and recording studios—with more on the amateur–professional continuum, and patronage).\n\nWith amateur music, people’s time and work are often as important as their money. So too are non-monetary rewards such as aesthetic enjoyment, the pleasure of performing, status, the sense of creativity, or even just the symbol of having earned “a fee” irrespective of its actuall monetary price. This in turn chimes in with a series of commonly held values: the high worth commonly attached to “performance”, to “music”, and to working for a “good cause”, as well as the view held by many people that “doing your own thing” has something inherently valuable about it—or, at the least, that the various groups organised to pursue different ends are an acceptable part of modern life.\n\nIt would be too simple just to assert—as some do—that local music is supported by “the community” or to speak of it as essentially “community music-making”. There are too many different interests, sections, conflicts, and unfamiliarities to take that romantic picture. Nevertheless there is a grain of truth in this view. For local musical activities only remain possible through the support of a complex network of institutions, many of them essentially realised by local participants at the local level whatever their wider links: not only the continuing moral, social, and financial (as well as musical) input of local musicians, but also the local music shops, studios, businesses, special interest groups, bands, performers, musical societies, pubs, personalities, fund-raising groups, schools, churches, and charities.\n\nIn Part Five, “The significance of local music”, Finnegan asks\n\nAre there wider implications that can be drawn out from this system of local music-making? This part builds on the earlier ethnographic material to explore such questions as what local music practice and its pathways mean for those who live out their lives in the urban (perhaps impersonal?) setting of modern society or for the rituals and functioning of our society and culture more generally. Finally—and on a more speculative level—are the many many small acts and decisions which, however little recognised, lie behind the continuance of music-making of any wider significance for the fundamental experience and reality of humankind?\n\nAgain, she never falls back on untested assumptions. Critical of the familiar paradigms of the city as inimical to personal control or warmth, and of the romantic sense of “community”, she finds diversity in terms of education, wealth, and occupation—though she does conclude that gender roles remain hard to break through. She reflects on participation by age; and on the ordering of time, noting regularity—along with “rehearsals”, “concerts” and “gigs”, life-cycle and calendrical events (my term, not hers) are important social contexts.\n\nShe elaborates on “pathways” in modern living, stressing that they “depend on the constant hidden cultivation by active participants of the musical practices that, with all their real (not imaginary) wealths and meanings, keep in being the old and new cultural traditions within our society.” Finally, in “Music, society, humanity”, she broaches concepts such as sociability and the search for value; and she ponders, with typical detachment, whether music is somehow different from other social activities.\n\n* * *\n\nIn her Preface for the 2007 edition, Finnegan reflects on golden-age nostalgia, change, ebb and flow rather than decline, new technologies, immigration. She outlines gaps in her study, and how one might update it: she might now pay more attention to mass media, constantly expanding since the 1980s, and the role of cultural, religious, and ethnic “minorities” (then less evident in Milton Keynes than in many English cities) would certainly now play a greater role, including South Asian, Irish, Italian, Polish, Vietnamese, and Somali subgroups.\n\nWhile it’s an urban study, Finnegan’s book has influenced ethnographers in diverse fields, including my own study of Gaoluo village. As she comments, in a passage that applies verbatim to my work there and on the Li family Daoists, her research\n\nenlarged and challenged my own preconceptions, […] tied in to an activity to which I attached real value, and presented me with some complex intellectual, methodological, and moral challenges. […] I was dealing with something that I personally enjoyed and found inspiring. Most of all it involved human beings, not just abstractions or generalisations, and the complex and diverse pathways they both trod and created irrespective of the ways scholars thought they should be behaving. In the end, I still like this study because it is about real people in a real, not pseudonymous, place that existed and exists: about people actively engaging in intensely human practices in which they took trouble and pains, in which they experienced disputes and sociability—and, rightly, delight.\n\nNote the roundup under Society and soundscape, particularly What is serious music?! and Is Western Art Music superior?. See also Just remind me again, what is music?! and Old and new musics. Cf. Das Land ohne Musik, and for lowly tennis players and “ordinary Daoists”, here.\n\nI’ve often cited Nicolas Slonimsky’s brilliant Lexicon of musical invective. So I enjoyed reading his fascinating memoir\n\nPerfect Pitch,\n\nin a revised third edition from 2023, ably edited by his daughter Electra Slonimsky Yourke.\n\nWritten with wit and wisdom at the age of 94, and first published in 1988, it’s a captivating blend of substance and gossip, packed with wonderful anecdotes—a Who’s Who of figures that seemed to matter at the time, part of a niche zeitgeist.\n\nNicolas Slonimsky (1894–1995) (fine website, with A/V; books, including Writings on music, 4 vols., 2005; wiki) was “a typical product of the Russian intelligentsia”—in the early chapters he gives a detailed account of his Russian family history and political turmoil. Already by 1912 his early musical facility led him to describe himself as a “failed wunderkind”.\n\nIn autumn 1918 he left St Petersburg. After stays in Kiev and Yalta, in 1920 he reached Constantinople (pp.85–90), where he found many musicians among the throng of Russian refugees. Lodging with a Greek family, he accompanied Russian dancers, and played for restaurants and silent movies. He composed Obsolete foxtrot and Danse du faux Orient, later included in his Minitudes. After following a girlfriend, a Russian dancer, to Sofia, by late 1921 he arrived in Paris—also inundated by Russian emigrés. There he worked for Serge Koussevitzky for the first time, who introduced him to Stravinsky in Biarritz. Koussevitzky, sorely challenged by irregular time signatures, * asked him to rebar The Rite of Spring for him. Despite moving in cultured circles, Koussevitzky (like Tennstedt later) was not a great reader.\n\nSlonimsky was impressed by Nikolai Obukhov, a “religious fanatic” who made a living as a bricklayer. Inspired by Scriabin, and an unlikely protégé of Ravel, his magnum opus Le livre de vie for voices, orchestras, and two pianos (Preface here) contained “moaning, groaning, screaming, shrieking, and hissing”. He dreamed of “having his music performed in an open-air amphitheatre, perhaps in the Himalayas or some other exotic place”. He developed the croix sonore, a prototype of the theremin.\n\nIn 1923 Slonimsky docked in New York, travelling on a Nansen passport, “an abomination of desolation, the mark of Cain, the red spot of a pariah”. He soon found work as opera coach for the new Eastman School of Music in Rochester, at the invitation of Vladimir Rosing. He now confronted the challenge of learning English. Indeed, the book is full of gleeful comments on language learning. Taking advertising slogans as his textbook, Slonimsky’s arrangements (particularly Children cry for Castoria!) became popular. America seemed a fairy-tale land. At Eastman he found a kindred soul in author Paul Horgan.\n\nIn 1924 Koussevitzky replaced Pierre Monteux as conductor of the Symphony Orchestra (whose musicians were mainly German, French, and Russian), and the following year he invited Slonimsky to become his secretary (feeling more like a “serf”). Koussevitzky was in awe of Rachmaninoff’s genius, and despite his withering assessments of rival conductors, he did promote Mitropoulos and Bernstein; he was dismissive of Arthur Fiedler’s Boston Pops (cf. the splendid Erich Leinsdorf story). Much as he valued Slonimsky’s talents, his insecurity meant that his young protégé always had to tread carefully, and in 1927 they parted company.\n\nStill, he now enjoyed a “meteoric” conducting career. With no illusions about his rudimentary technique, he founded the Chamber Orchestra of Boston, promoting contemporary composers—notably Henry Cowell, Edgard Varèse, and Charles Ives. After a performance of a work by Cowell, they rejoiced in the headline “”Uses egg to show off piano”. Slonimsky introduced Aaron Copland to George Gershwin. After Cowell introduced Slonimsky to Charles Ives, they became close.\n\nHenry Cowell with Charles Ives, 1952.\n\nSlonimsky was full of praise for Ives:\n\nI learned to admire the nobility of his thought, his total lack of selfishness, and his faith in the inherent goodness of mankind. […] He inveighed mightily against self-inflated mediocrity, in politics and art alike. The most disparaging word in his vocabulary was “nice”. To him, it signified smugness, self-satisfaction, lack of imagination. He removed himself from the ephemeral concerns of the world at large. He never read newspapers. He did not own a radio or a phonograph, and he rarely if ever attended concerts.\n\nIn 1931 (the year he gained US citizenship), Slonimsky gave the première of Ives’s Three places in New England in New York. Promoting the work with passion, in Perfect pitch he waxes lyrical about its genius.\n\nSlonimsky conducting Varèse’s Ionisation in Havana.\n\nHe was invited to conduct in Havana, his first experience of modern Cuban music. He conducted revelatory concerts in Paris, sponsored by Ives, encouraged by Varèse. There too he married Dorothy Adlow.\n\nHe returned to Europe for more concerts in 1932—with Bartók giving the Paris premiere of his 1st piano concerto, and Rubinstein playing Brahms’s 2nd piano concerto!!! In Berlin (in the nick of time before the grip of Nazism) he conducted the Berlin Phil in a modern programme including Three places in New England and Varèse’s Arcana. He repeated the programme in Budapest.\n\nHe reflects on this ephemeral phase of his career:\n\nThe art of conducting is paradoxical, for its skills range from the mechanical to the inspirational. A conductor can be a semaphore endowed with artificial intelligence, or an illuminating spirit of music. The derisive assertion that “anyone can conduct” is literally true: musicians will play no matter how meaningless or incoherent the gestures of a baton wielder may be. In this respect, conductors stand apart from other performers. A violinist, even a beginner, must be able to play on pitch with a reasonable degree of proficiency. A pianist must have enough technical skill to get through a piece with a minimum of wrong notes. But a conductor is exempt from such obligations. He does not have to play; he orders others to play for him.\n\nThis leads him to some wonderful stories about badly-behaved conductors (cf. Viola jokes and maestro-baiting); Toscanini, Klemperer—and this story, evoking the unwelcome posturings of many a later maestro:\n\nMengelberg once apostrophised his first cello player with a long diatribe expounding the spiritual significance of a certain passage. “Your soul in distress yearns for salvation,”, he recited. “Your unhappiness mounts with every passing moment. You must pray for surcease of sorrow!” “Oh, you mean mezzo forte,” the cellist interrupted impatiently.\n\nI’m eternally grateful to Slonimsky for relating some classic Ormandy maxims (now joyously expanded here by members of the Philadelphia orchestra)—OK then, just a couple:\n\nSuddenly I was in the right tempo, but it wasn’t.\n\nWho is sitting in that empty chair?\n\nIn “Disaster in Hollywood” he tells how his first appearance with the LA Phil in 1932 ended in tears. When the programmes for his eight-week season at the Hollywood Bowl in the summer of 1933 proved far too challenging for the “moneyed dowagers”, his conducting career came to an inglorious end. He takes consolation in the later admission of the works that he championed to the pantheon (cf. the fine story of Salonen’s interview for the LA Phil!). Meanwhile in New York he conducted, and recorded, Varèse’s revolutionary Ionisation.\n\nWith typical linguistic flourishes, he devotes a proud chapter to the birth of his daughter Electra, editor of the volume. He rearranged a limerick:\n\nThere was a young woman named Hatch\n\nWho was fond of the music of Batch\n\nIt isn’t so fussy\n\nAs that of Debussy\n\nSit down, I’ll play you a snatch.\n\nHe would have enjoyed these limericks, and one by Alan Watts, n.2 here.\n\n“Like gaseous remnants of a shattered comet lost in an erratic orbit”, occasional conducting engagements still came his way. In “Lofty baton to lowly pen” he recalls his transition to musical lexicography. He met fellow Russian emigrés Léon Theremin (whose life was to take a very different course) and the iconoclastic theoretician Joseph Schillinger. As Slonimsky compiled his book Music since 1900 (1937!), he became interested in the savage reception of new music, leading to his brilliant Lexicon of musical invective.\n\nStill, he was never tied to his desk. His appetite whetted by his trips to Cuba, in “Exotic journeys” he recalls his 1941–42 tour of Brazil (hearing Villa Lobos’s tales of his Amazonian adventures), Argentina, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Columbia, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Mexico. His book Music of Latin America was published in 1945.\n\nReturning to Boston, he was plunged into family duties. In 1947 he published Thesaurus of scales and melodic patterns.\n\nIn 1935, armed with a US passport, he returned to his birthplace, now called Leningrad, visiting long-lost relatives. He reflects on the death of his mother in 1944, and the life of his aunt Isabelle Vengerova (1877–1956), who became a legendary piano teacher in the States.\n\nAfter the war, with Russia in vogue in the USA, Slonimsky enjoyed revising his proficiency in his mother tongue, updating old manuals to teach students and taking on work as translator. While he was largely free of McCarthyite suspicion of sympathising with Communism, back in the USSR his brother Michael was at far greater risk for being suspected of opposing it (for Soviet life, note The whisperers).\n\nDissatisfied with previous compendia and nerdily meticulous, he found a new mission in updating Baker’s biographical dictionary of musicians. He was proud of his 1960 article “The weather at Mozart’s funeral”. In 1956 he achieved unprecedented celebrity through appearing on the quiz show The big surprise.\n\nIn “The future of my past” he describes another trip to the USSR and the Soviet bloc in 1962–63, funded by the State Department—an Appendix to the third edition provides a detailed account. He visited Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, as well as Greece and Israel. On his meetings with musicians, he was inspired by the energy of Ukrainian and Georgian composers.\n\nHis diary is punctuated by his curiosity about language, starting in Moscow:\n\nTo my Americanised ears, the new Soviet language sounded almost theatrical in its emphasis, deliberate articulation, and expressive caesuras. I also noticed a proliferation of diminutives….\n\nIn Prague he learned the vowel-less tongue-twister Strc prst skrz krk:\n\nI used this phrase as the supposed title of a choral work by the mythical Czech composer Krsto Zyžik, whom I invented and whose name I was tempted (I ultimately desisted) to include as the last entry in my edition of Baker’s.\n\nBut soon after his return to Boston his wife Dorothy had a heart attack, which was to be fatal. Bereft after her death in January 1964, he welcomed the offer of a post at distant UCLA. He composed musical limericks for his students’ benefit, but was not always impressed by their aptitude, citing gems from their essays such as “A piano quintet is a piece for five pianos”.\n\nAfter two seasons he reached compulsory retirement age, but he was never going to go quietly. In LA he enjoyed a wide social circle. Besides many “flaky” composer friends was John Cage, now a guru (Slonimsky cites Pravda: “His music demoralises the listeners by its neurotic drive and by so doing depresses the proletarian urge to rise en masse against capitalism and imperialism”!).\n\nWith John Cage, and Frank Zappa.\n\nBack in LA, he made friends with Frank Zappa, who invited him to play at his gig.\n\nDancing Zappa, wild audience, and befuddled me: I felt like an intruder in a mad scene from Alice in Wonderland. I had reached my Age of Absurdity.\n\nMeanwhile with perestroika in the Soviet Union, Slonimsky was becoming quite a celebrity there too, making several more visits and admiring composers’ creativity in new idioms.\n\n* * *\n\nFar more than a mere entertainer, Slonimsky was a major figure in promoting new music. With his eclectic tastes, I can’t help thinking that he would have enjoyed gravitating to ethnomusicology, questioning the wider meanings of “musician” or “composer” (see e.g. Nettl); but he was deeply rooted in the WAM styles of Russian classics and the American avant-garde. Still, within the world of WAM literature it makes a most fascinating memoir.\n\nFor some reason it fills me with joy to learn that a Japanese translation of Lexicon of musical invective has been published.\n\n* Even 5/8 was too much for Koussevitzky:\n\nHe had a tendency to stretch out the last beat, counting “one, two, three, four, five, uh”. This ‘uh” constituted the sixth beat, reducing Stravinsky’s spasmodic rhythms to the regular heartbeat. When I pointed this out to him, he became quite upset. It was just a luftpause, he said. The insertion of an “air pause” reduced the passage to a nice waltz time, making it very comfortable to play for the violin section, who bore the brunt of the syncopation, but wrecking Stravinsky’s asymmetric rhythms.\n\nwith asides on religion and the alliance with China\n\nIn a curious spinoff from Euro 24, I came across the intriguing\n\nPhil Harrison, Inside the hermit kingdom: football stories from Stalinist Albania (2024) (extract here).\n\nI trust you understand why I just had to read it. The modern history of Albania holds a grim fascination for outsiders. For a book clearly aimed at a popular market, Harrison’s obsession with football through the period seems to me on a par with that of scholars who document early Daoist ritual—or does his dogged optimism resemble mine in supposing I can make the modern travails of household Daoists palatable?!\n\nInside the hermit kingdom was “written by accident”, with major input from Irvin, an Albanian expat whose own story remains opaque. * While Harrison is aware of the dangers of portraits of Albania that “instil a sense of Western, capitalist superiority”, he inevitably paints a bleak picture, sometimes reminiscent of the spoof travel guide Molvania. The account is punctuated with “Iconic games” and vignettes on the careers of some of the major stars. There may not be such a thing as a casual reader here, but fair-weather fans may find it somewhat excessive to plough through some of the detailed reports of the most obscure matches ever.\n\nThe book opens in 1905 with the arrival of Christian missionaries in the “tribal backwaters” of mountainous Shkodër, beset by banditry, a Maltese priest founding the first club in 1912. The craze soon spread (cf. Futbol in Turkey, then and now).\n\nHarrison soon plunges us into the vernacular of Albanian football terminology: positions on the pitch, organisations, and slang (humbje hapësire “a waste of space”).\n\nHe describes early internationals and the Zog-Mussolini axis. In April 1939 Mussolini’s forces invaded Albania, forcing King Zog into exile. We learn the stoies of two outstanding players among the Albanians recruited to Serie A, and of the Balkan Cup, held from 1946.\n\nClubs were now controlled by the army and police. Dinamo Tirana was founded in 1950—its stadium (above, via Fussball Geekz) built in 1956 by political prisoners supervised by armed militia, with many of the conscripts dying from exhaustion and injuries. In 1958 Partizani took part in the Spartakiad tournament in the GDR between army-affiliated clubs from the communist countries of the world.\n\n“Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship in battle between\n\nthe peoples of China and Albania!” Source.\n\nAfter the death of Stalin in 1953 Enver Hoxha’s relationship with the Soviet Union eroded, deteriorating further in 1956, until the rupture of 1961 which led to Albania’s solitary alliance with Maoist China. In 1957, the wave of Albanianization was evident in the political renaming of many football clubs. Harrison shows how the “golden goal” dates back to 1961 Albania.\n\nQuite the most remarkable image I know:\n\nformer Buddhist monk with village disciples, suburban Beijing 1959.\n\nWith religion suppressed under Hoxha, it was replaced by the ritual and passion of Sunday-afternoon football, a “communal protest against oppression and servility”. Asking “How did football make Albanians feel?”, Harrison describes wages, bicycles, cigarettes (with an aside on their manufacture), alcohol, transistor radios, and racing pigeons. In Tirana from the 1960s, Gimi’s tiny kiosk was a hub of activity, not only selling newspapers and magazines but serving as ticket office for the Albanian Football Federation. At the stadium one stand, the Tribuna, was reserved for army, police, and Party members. The only refreshments available were fara grilled sunflower seeds, wrapped in paper cones sold from tezga usherette trays. For away matches, with train links rudimentary, diehard supporters would undertake a three- or four-hour bike ride, or hitch a lift on an army truck. Attempting access to foreign matches via satellite TV was fraught with danger.\n\nPolitical anxieties were pervasive, with society surveilled by the Sigurimi secret police (eight of whose nine directors were themselves imprisoned and executed between 1943 and 1991), and the spectre of labour camps. In 1967 star player Skënder Halili was caught selling two wristwatches and sentenced to hard labour in the mines of Bulqiza, eventually cause of his death in 1982—attendance at his funeral marking a small-scale protest against the regime.\n\n“Truth over religion”, screenshots.\n\nIn 1966–67, just as the Summer of Love was under way in the West, Hoxha, emulating Mao’s Cultural Revolution, clamped down still more harshly on religion and Western influence. He sponsored the making of the 1967 propaganda film E vërteta mbi fenë [Truth over religion] (do watch here). Among the casualties were Catholic priests, imams, and leaders of the Bektashi order (cf. Turkey; for another niche topic, see Shamans in the two Koreas). This was among several waves of violent religious persecution throughout the Soviet bloc since the 1920s. I’m keen to learn more of the underground maintenance of religious traditions, one of my main themes for China; in Skopje, for instance, just northeast from Albania, a remarkable 1951 film shows self-mortification rituals of the Rufai order.\n\nSource.\n\nBack with the football, the 1966–67 “Championship of Coals” was subject to murky political interference. And in typical detail, Harrison describes the plucky goalless draw with West Germany in 1967 (above), watched from the Tribuna by Party stalwarts and Chinese dignitaries. I wonder about the lives of those visiting diplomats, who had somehow survived the Anti-Rightist purge, the Great Leap Backward and famine—now to find themselves exchanging cautious platitudes at a football match in a remote third-world country just as chaotic violence was being unleashed back home at the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution.\n\nAs purges continued, Albania became even more isolated. Harrison now devotes a substantial chapter to Fatmir Shima (with the catchy subtitle “the man from Xhomlliku”), father of his guide Irvin, who played in a lower division from 1969 to 1975 (cf. ordinary tennis players, Daoists, musicians, and so on), a temporary diversion from his career in agronomy. The chapter ends with another iconic game, between Tirona and Ajax, with predictable cultural clashes. Meanwhile Italian clubs were still scouting for Albanian players.\n\nUnder Hoxha the Gheg city of Shkodër was penalised, but its Vllaznia team rose to win the Kampionati Kombetar league in 1971–72, first of several successes over the following years—as the culture of Tirana at last no longer seemed so impregnable, people began to sense new possibilities.\n\nHarrison continues to excel in arcane nerdiness with his account of the Dinamo club, which enjoyed success through the 1950s but then languished until the 1970s. Again he ends with an iconic game, between Partizani and Celtic for the 1979 European Cup—hair once again making a potential flashpoint. The game was “a sell-out, with ticket prices ranging from 7p to 21p”.\n\nOne of the great ironies of the piece is that Celtic’s players—upon their visit to Tirana during the dire, ramshackle days of the late 1970s—were privy to observing a failing city that was grim, penurious, and devoid of hope; a place of limited prospects.\n\nIn an act verging on satire, Vata—the first Albanian footballer to ever play in Scotland—made the reverse journey to his Celt predecessors 13 years later, keen to see what the world outside of Albanian borders had to offer. He now continues, by choice, to live in Hamilton.\n\nBy the 1970s, the Sino-Albanian collaboration suffered from Hoxha’s disillusion with China’s new rapprochement with the USA. Entirely isolated from 1978 once Chinese funding was discontinued, Albania was in an even more desperate plight. As audiences for the major games declined, people turned to futboll lagjesh “neighbourhood football”, a version of Italian calcetto. Harrison praises the creative improvisation of this five-a-side street style, “an inclusive, democratic idea set against an autocratic backdrop; an arcane act of defiance hiding within plain sight”, with vivid vignettes of the architecture of suburban east Tirana. But “with increased popularity came increased scrutiny”. “Enacting a class war”, a team from privileged Blloku ended up playing a rancorous game against a local Roma team, ending in a brawl and the sending of the Roma to labour camp.\n\nBy the early 80s, the regime was on its knees. As Hoxha lay dying, links were being forged with Italy, Greece, and Turkey. Within Albania, funding for football dwindled further. But apart from the long dominance of Tirana and Shkodër, KS Labinoti (in Elbasan county in central Albania) emerged as a contender. And the national team was making progress, at first through Shyqyri Rreli’s leadership of the under-21 team, and then in the 1984 World Cup qualifiers—with another blow-by-blow account of Albania’s magnificent 2-0 win over Belgium in Tirana. Albania narrowly failed to qualify for the Mexico 1986 World Cup, but the seed had been sown.\n\nNo nation has endured a more ill-tempered relationship with Europe’s footballing community than Albania. […] The Party remained unswervingly peevish in its interactions with the outside world, and this innate narrow-mindedness transposed itself on to sport.\n\nHarrison documents the troubled domestic league, and encounters between Albanian and foreign clubs, over the whole period from the death throes of the regime from the late 1980s to the final collapse in 1992—whereupon Albania entered a period of anarchy and crushed dreams, prompting a mass exodus.\n\nBut somehow in football, clubs “trundled on”. The final chapter, “The other side of the abyss”, describes how clubs reverted to pre-Hoxha names, resentment emerged in on-pitch petulance and crowd violence, corporate sponsorship gave rise to a new kind of corruption, and criminal gangs flourished. While the domestic game has suffered, since 2014 the national side has been reborn—with the great majority of the squad playing outside Albania.\n\nThe new, great Albanian players ply their trade elsewhere and are rewarded with huge remuneration and lavish lifestyles, connected to their native people only by ethnicity, not locality or reality.\n\nMemory remains strong:\n\nThe only thing people who lived through Albanian Stalinism still celebrate, or seem to agree on, is the football [… —] a football that unified fans and provided a balm during fifty years of horrific suffering.\n\nOne has to applaud Harrison’s boundless enthusiasm for such a niche project. Of course, football was not the only source of communal celebration; musical gatherings were an important part of social life at the domestic level (see under Musical cultures of east Europe, and Bernard Lortat-Jacob at 80). For other Albanian icons, see the unlikely bedfellows of Norman Wisdom and Mother Teresa. Note also posts under Life behind the Iron Curtain; more on football under A sporting medley: ritual and gender.\n\n* With more detail on football than on social history, Harrison’s scant citations include Margo Rejmer’s collection Mud sweeter than honey: voices of Communist Albania, the memoir Erla Marinaku, “A social history of Socialist Albania, 1975-1991”, and the title Albania—who cares? is suggestive. He would doubtless like to add Lea Ypi’s perceptive 2021 memoir Free: coming of age at the end of history, which I reviewed here.\n\nThoughtful analysis of the legacy of empire is part of a productive academic trend—one which is being vehemently resisted in the corridors of entrenched power, fulminating against the “Guardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati” (links e.g. here; cf. Fatima Manji, Hidden heritage, and sources there).\n\nSathnam Sanghera, Empireland: how imperialism has shaped modern Britain (2021)\n\nmakes an engaging, accessible summary of research (among reviews, Guardian; LSE; and on the sequel Empireworld, LRB).\n\nIn the opening chapter Sanghera imagines a revival of Empire Day that would be more educational. As he notes,\n\nIt’s all very well highlighting empire awareness by talking about how our honours list still hands out Orders of the British Empire, how many of our common garden plants were originally imported into Britain by imperialists, or how Worcestershire sauce might originally have been an Indian recipe, reportedly brought back to Britain by an ex-governor of Bengal. But our imperial past has had a much more profound effect on modern Britain.\n\nEmpire explains why we have a diaspora of millions of Britons spread around the world. Empire explains the global pretensions of our Foreign and Defence secretaries. Empire explains the feeling that we are exceptional and can go it alone when it comes to dealing with everything from Brexit to dealing with global pandemics. Empire helped to establish the position of the City of London as one of the world’s major financial centres, and also ensures that the interests of finance trump the interests of so many other groups in the 21st century. Empire explains how some of our richest families and institutions became wealthy. Empire explains our particular brand of racism, it explains our distrust of cleverness, our propensity for jingoism. Let’s face it, imperialism is not something that can be erased with a few statues being torn down or a few institutions facing up to their dark pasts or a few accomplished individuals declining an OBE; it exists as a legacy in my very being and, more widely, explains nothing less than who we are as a nation.\n\nPrelude to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre (Amritsar):\n\n“All native men were forced to crawl the Kucha Kurrichhan on their hands and knees\n\nas punishment, 1919″. Source: wiki.\n\nHe frankly explores his Punjabi Sikh background, and demolishes the “futile and misleading” balance sheet of “was the Empire good or bad?”. Chapter 4, “Emotional loot” gives an instructive take on the 1903 British invasion of Tibet (“the Younghusband expedition”), leading him to consider the massive stock of looted artefacts that adorns our museums and stately homes, and the bitter debate over restitution. Chapter 5, “We are here because you were there”, opens in Brighton with the story of Dean Mahomed (1759–1851) (also explored by Fatima Manji), leading to an outline of the early presence of black and brown people in Britain.\n\nSanghera reflects on nostalgia for the Raj, the persistent self-isolation of expat communities around the world, and their taste for British food and education; on the irony of the British search for adventure (“There is no shortage on Instagram of people who confuse travelling with having a personality”); on the lure of sexual opportunity, and prudery; and on the vanity of our claim to be “world-beating”. An intriguing insight on empire’s fetish for manliness:\n\nIt was not uncommon to find men with a stammer working in administrative roles in the Indian Civil Service—to have a position in empire instantly gave a man kudos, and a speech impediment might be overlooked for “empire served as proof for masculinity”.\n\nEmpireland is full of such instructive byways, such as the history of gin and tonic, “the cornerstone of the British Empire” (Spanish fly 1976):\n\nGin to fight the boredom of exile and quinine to fight malaria. How else do you think we could have carried the cross of responsibility for the life of millions without the friendly fortitude of gin and tonic?\n\nSanghera cites a Tweet by Helen Zaltzman:\n\nBritain is hostile to people arriving in boats because Britain knows what happened when Britain arrived in other countries in boats.\n\nChapter 8, “Dirty money” continues to unearth the foundations of British wealth, while carefully identifying the complex issues. Just as balanced is Chapter 9, “The origins of our racism”:\n\nTo say Britain has a dark history of racism which influences contemporary psychology and culture […] does not preclude, for me, the fact that it simultaneously, if inadvertently, inspired anti-racism.\n\nSource.\n\nIn Chapter 10, “Empire state of mind”, Sanghera returns to his own experience, pondering the public school system, analysing the warped psychology of Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg along with other recent Tory fatuities—but finding inspiration in the work of Edward Said. Chapter 11, “Selective amnesia”, pinpoints a major theme of troubled national histories around the world (see e.g. Memory, music, society), with a trenchant vignette on Britain’s obsession for India’s railways—citing Katherine Schofield’s hashtags #OccasionalMassacre and #ButTheRailways. He introduces James Walvin’s The trader, the owner, the slave as the single best book he has read on slavery—elsewhere he imagines putting Robert Winder, Bloody foreigners on the national curriculum.\n\nChapter 12, “Working off the past”, continues to explore the right-wing backlash against the convincing arguments of historians, but in conclusion he details several reasons to be optimistic. In 2023 he issued a children’s book, Stolen history: the truth about the British Empire and how it shaped us.\n\nJust as reasonable and constructive is his two-part documentary Empire state of mind for Channel 4 (2021). Perhaps you can also find his 2019 film The massacre that shook the Empire. Do consult his useful website.\n\nI remain fond of this definition of patriotism from a Yugoslavian child in the 1990s, cited by Kapka Kassabova:\n\nI love my country. Because it is small and I feel sorry for it.\n\n* * *\n\nEmpireland makes a convenient survey of the major topics in imperialism explored by academics—and relieves bigots of the burden of reading them, allowing them to focus their fulminations on Sanghera. Despite his impartial considerations of the evidence, a counter-movement of denial soon surfaced—which he explores thoughtfully (see also here).\n\nFor what it’s worth, I am actually grateful for a great deal. […] For having had a free education at one of the best grammar schools in the country; for having attended (for free) one of the best colleges at one of the most successful universities in the world; for an NHS that cares for the people I love the most; for a welfare state that has saved my family from the most crushing consequences of poverty; for the chance to live in the greatest city on earth and work on two of the greatest newspapers in the world; for British pop music; for the glorious British countryside; for Pizza Express. But I resent being instructed to demonstrate my gratitude whenever I analyse any aspect of British life, when my white colleagues don’t get the same treatment. Yes, I have had a better life than I would probably have had in India, but I was born here, not India. I am British. I am as entitled to comment on my home nation as the next man and the endless insistence that I demonstrate my gratitude is rooted in racism. Racism which is, in itself, rooted in the fact that the children of imperial immigrants born here are not always seen as fully British.\n\nGiven that many white authors have reached precisely the same conclusions, the backlash against Sanghera and David Olusoga suggests just the kind of racism that this approach exposes, as William Dalrymple observes:\n\n“Despite writing very similar stuff to Sathnam, I have never received a single letter like that. It is a direct result of his ethnicity and skin colour,” says Dalrymple, whose latest book The anarchy tackles the “relentless” rise of the East India Company. “You can’t really draw any distinction between what Sathnam’s writing and what I’ve written. And my books have got a free pass. There is a very serious distinction to be drawn between what he’s gone through writing what he has on empire, and me as a Caucasian writing the same thing.”\n\nBTW, Sanghera, Olusoga, and Dalrymple are just the kind of scholars I would love to see elaborating on my speculations about the early-19th-century reversal of the black and white keys on fortepianos in the context of slavery and empire.\n\nLest anyone despair that my Chinese theme has recently been submerged\n\nbeneath football and tennis…\n\nHaving studied the qin zither obsessively for my first few years after coming to China in 1986, I then defected—feeling not exactly unworthy but just too immersed in the utterly different world of folk ritual life in the poor countryside (see Taking it on the qin). So my posts on this elite solo tradition (see qin tag) are partly an attempt to atone for jumping ship. The qin being a genuine ivory tower, we might try and see the wood for the trees (make up your own metaphors—though “Swirls before pine” is unbeatable!).\n\nJohn Thompson has never wavered in his devotion to the qin. The documentary\n\nMusic beyond sound: an American’s world of guqin (Lau Shing-hon, 2019)\n\n(watch here; introduction here, with links)\n\nmakes a useful introduction to his lifelong work. Interspersed with lengthy sequences in which he plays his reconstructions of Ming pieces at scenic spots in Hong Kong and Hangzhou (in the mode of the literati of Yore), he reflects on his early life, his later path, and the state of the qin (biography here). Subtitles are in both English and Chinese. It’s something of an illustrated lecture, with testimonials.\n\nFrom a background in Western Art Music (WAM), John was drawn to early music, as well as popular music and jazz. After graduating in 1967 he was confronted with the draft, serving in Military Intelligence in Vietnam (cf. Bosch) for eighteen months and making trips around East Asia. Already educating himself on Chinese culture, he returned to the USA to attend graduate school in Asian Studies, studying Chinese language and discovering “world music” through ethnomusicology, learning the Japanese shamisen. In those early days before the vast revival of traditional Chinese culture around 1980, he was understandably underwhelmed by the bland diet of conservatoire dizi and erhu solos. Instead, through reading the seminal work of Robert van Gulik, The lore of the Chinese lute, he became fascinated with the highly literate, prescribed microcosm of the qin. *\n\nFor this his best option was Taiwan, where from 1974 to 1976 he studied with Sun Yu-ch’in (1915–90); he then studied with Sun’s accomplished pupil Tong Kin-woon and the veteran Tsar Deh-yun (1905–2007) ** in Hong Kong, where he made his home. While learning from the qin renaissance in mainland China before and after the Cultural Revolution, he has forged his own path performing and researching early tablatures; setting forth from reconstructing the 64 pieces in the 1425 Shenqi mipu (6-CD compendium with 72-page booklet, 2000), he avidly sought out other early tablatures (CD Music beyond sound, 1998).\n\nThis may seem like a niche within a niche, and it’s an even more solitary pursuit, but the search for early pieces vastly expands the small repertoire handed down from master to pupil. All this work gave rise to his remarkable website.\n\nIn the PRC since the 1960s the traditional silk strings of the qin were largely replaced by metal, though they persisted in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and there are some advocates on the mainland. In keeping with his taste for historical recreation, John is a fervent advocate of silk strings (see this typically exhaustive essay).\n\nIn Hong Kong he also served as Programme Adviser for the Festival of Asian Arts from 1980 to 1998. In 2001 he married Suzanne Smith and they moved to New Jersey. Alongside his ongoing research he continues to engage with the qin scene in mainland China, where his work is respected. In 2010 he was among fourteen masters invited to take part in a festival at the Zhejiang Museum to play qin zithers from the Tang dynasty (!!!) (click here; for a 2019 festival, here). Like other wise qin players, confronted by the performance ethos of the conservatoire and the Intangible Cultural Heritage, he valiantly proclaims the literati aesthetic of self-cultivation.\n\n* * *\n\nWhile silkqin.com contains a vast range of material, John remains devoted to recreating Ming tablatures (still, I find it refreshing to hear him explaining that in such an oral tradition, there was no need for tablature!). The site contains ample material on the changing modern practice of the qin, but the social context before, during, and since Maoism (suggested in my series on the qin zither under Maoism) is not his main theme. Clearly the quietism the film evokes (cf. the spiritual quest of Bill Porter) is remote from the “red and fiery” atmosphere of the folk festivities that I frequent, but the social bond of PRC qin gatherings is also largely absent.\n\nIn the Chinese media the dominance of elite imperial culture is stark; online there is a wealth of information on the qin, whereas material for far more common traditions (such as the rituals of spirit mediums) is elusive. While John’s comments on the differences between early WAM and “Chinese music” are thoughtful, the vast variety of the latter cannot be represented by the qin; his dedicated study of one aspect of an elite tradition hardly allows room to absorb the wider context.\n\nBruno Nettl has wise words on “you [foreigners] will never understand our music” (The study of ethnomusicology: thirty-three discussions, ch.11). Conversely, I’m tired of the old clichés “Why should a foreigner study Chinese culture?” and “The monk from outside knows how to recite the scriptures“. Within China there are plenty of “monks to recite the scriptures”; no-one there would ever suggest that the qin is only understood by foreigners. John is indeed exceptional in his long-term in-depth study, but further afield this kind of thing is common—as is clear from the careers of other foreign scholar-performers such as Ric Emmert for Japanese noh drama, Veronica Doubleday for Afghan singing, or Nicolas Magriel for the sarangi in India. ***\n\nIn the sinosphere, whereas scholars rarely engage in participant observation for folk music, for the qin performing and scholarship tend to go hand in hand. So alongside the majority of qin players who have been content to transmit the repertoire that they learned from their teachers are some distinguished masters who unearth and recreate early historical sources—such as Zha Fuxi, Yao Bingyan, Tong Kin-woon, Bell Yung, Dai XIaolian, and Lin Chen. John’s work as performer and scholar is a particularly intense instance of this historical focus, a niche in the wider movement of Historically Informed Performance (HIP: see e.g. Richard Taruskin, John Butt).\n\nQin fraternities are now thriving in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and around the world. Senior figures on the Hong Kong scene include Tsar Teh-yun, Tong Kin-woon, Lau Chor-wah, and Bell Yung. Note also the work of Georges Goormaghtigh. The qin has long been a popular choice for foreign students to study in the PRC.\n\nMy usual point: given its tiny coterie of players, the qin is vastly over-represented in studies of Chinese music! But however niche, the qin is an essential aspect of literati culture through the imperial era, along with poetry, painting and calligraphy; and John Thompson’s work is an essential resource.\n\n* For my own Long March to Chinese music around this time, see Revolution and laowai, and under Ray Man.\n\n** See Bell Yung, The Last of China’s literati (2008), and the 2-CD set The art of qin music (ROI 2000 / AIMP 2014).\n\n*** Note the contrasts between these four cultures, and approaches to them: Emmert working within the “isolated preservation” (Nettl) of noh, Doubleday as participant observer of an Afghan folk tradition soon to be decimated by warfare and fundamentalism, Magriel immersed in the changing social context of sarangi, and Thompson focusing on his own historical recreations of qin music.\n\nThe Anthology provides another gateway\n\nLike Beijing nearby, the municipality of Tianjin encompasses a large region, much of it still rural. On ritual and its soundscapes there, my previous articles include\n\nTianjin: a folk Buddhist group\n\nRitual groups of Jinghai\n\nDharma-drumming assoctiations of Tianjin.\n\nSo at last I’ve been trying to digest the relevant volumes on instrumental music of the great Anthology of folk music of the Chinese peoples:\n\nZhongguo minzu minjian qiyuequ jicheng, Tianjin juan 中国民间器乐曲集成, 天津卷 (2008) (2 vols; 1,475 pages),\n\nwhich as ever contain substantial material on ritual traditions. To remind you of my introduction to a similar recent survey for Fujian province in southeast China,\n\nRitual pervades all genres of folk expressive culture: in the Anthology, it is a major theme of the volumes for folk-song, narrative-singing, opera, and dance. In the instrumental music volumes, even genres that lack explicit liturgical content are also invariably performed for ceremonial occasions—but a further reason to consult them is that the specific rubric of “religious music” has been consigned there. I’ve described the flaws of the Anthology project in my\n\n“Reading between the lines: reflections on the massive Anthology of folk music of the Chinese peoples”, Ethnomusicology 47.3 (2003), pp.287–337.\n\nApart from the Anthology‘s valuable Monographs for opera and narrative-singing and brief textual introductions to genres, its volumes consist mainly of transcriptions, of limited value without available recordings. Conceptually its classifications are rudimentary, but it opens up a world of local cultures.\n\nIt’s important to grasp the geography of the large regions covered by such surveys (cf. Layers of fieldwork). At the time of compilation the greater Tianjin municipality comprised four suburban areas (east, west, south, north), five counties (Wuqing, Jinghai, Ninghe, Baodi, * Jixian), and three districts (Tanggu, Hangu, Dagang), all of which had distinctive local traditions.\n\nUseful as always are sketches of some leading groups (pp.1327–39) and brief biographies (pp.1340–56), containing promising leads to further ritual associations and sects.\n\nVolume 1 is entirely devoted to “drumming and blowing” (guchui yue 鼓吹乐). Here the rubric of “Songs-for-winds associations” (chuige hui 吹歌会) is misleading (see under Ritual groups of Xushui), compounded by the sub-categories of leading instrument (guanzi, suona, sheng, dizi). While many musicians are versatile on wind instruments, this masks the important distinction between occupational shawm bands and devotional ritual associations led by guanzi. However, there is some valuable historical information bearing on the “classical” style of amateur ritual groups (often known as “music associations” yinyuehui) serving ritual, such as the Tongshanhui 同善会 of Huanghuadian in Wuqing county (p.1336; brief mention here, under “Further leads”). Such groups were to become my main focus (see under Sects: Hebei, Local ritual, and Gaoluo).\n\nNao and bo cymbals of the Tianxing dharma-drumming association,\n\ninscribed Xuande reign, 5th year (1429). Besides museums,\n\nfolk performing groups preserve important evidence for\n\nthe material culture of imperial China (see China’s hidden century).\n\nShawm bands always occupy a substantial part of the Anthology coverage. Here the summary introduces traditions for all the municipality’s regions, notably in the north around Baodi and Jixian (pp.36–8, 41–2; groups pp.1338–9, biographies p.1343–4, 1355).\n\nThe “great music” of Tianjin.\n\nStill under the heading of “drumming and blowing”, a separate rubric introduces the imposing “great music” (dayue 大乐, though here I seem to recall it should be pronounced daiyue) of the Tianjin region. These shawm bands, derived from the Qing court (cf. longchui and Pingtan paizhi in Fujian), were transmitted among the folk through the Republican era until the 1950s, mainly in urban districts but also in the suburbs; but later they became largely obsolete, so the Anthology fieldwork was largely a “salvage” project.\n\nThe impressive introduction (pp.599–610) refers to documents from the late Qing, including material on the “imperial assembly” (huanghui 皇会), supplementing that of the dharma-drumming associations), and details the use of the genre at weddings and funerals. Besides recordings made for the Anthology in the 1980s, the appetising transcriptions (pp.611–78) utilise early discs that I’m keen to hear—Pathé (Baidai) from 1908 and the 1920s, Shengli 胜利 from the 1930s. Cultural cadres recorded senior artists in the 1950s and even “in the mid-70s”. By the 1980s, surviving musicians were recorded for the Anthology, and took part in the Boxer movie Shenbian 神鞭 (Holy whip, 1986).\n\nShifan band, 1930s.\n\nVolume 2 opens with an introduction to the mixed ensemble shifan 十番 (text pp.679–701, transcriptions pp.702–875; further material on the late Qing societies Siru she 四如社 and Jiya she 集雅社 on pp.1327–8). Related to the better-known genres of south China, notably Jiangnan, shifan bands are also found in a few northern regions including Hebei (see my Folk music of China, pp.206–8). In Tianjin, where shifan was part of the thriving Kunqu scene before Liberation, the major figure in documenting the tradition was Liu Chuqing 刘楚青 (1909–99) (pp.1341–2), who used his youthful immersion in the culture to compile a major volume in 1987.\n\nNotable among percussion ensembles (pp.876–1138) are the dharma-drumming associations (fagu hui 法鼓会), which my mentors at the Music Research Institute (MRI) in Beijing were excited to discover in 1986 and 1987 while attending major folk music festivals in Tianjin. These groups commonly subsumed a shengguan melodic ensemble—from the 1986 festival, listen to the MRI’s audio recording of the Pudong “music and dharma-drumming association” in Nanhe township, Xiqing district 西青南河镇普东音乐法鼓会. These events led us to the fieldwork of local scholars—notably Guo Zhongping 郭忠萍, author of the valuable overview in the Anthology (pp.876–97; transcriptions pp.898–1009; see also groups pp.1328–34 and biographies pp.1347, 1349), based on her more detailed early publication Fagu yishu chutan (1991).\n\nThis section also introduces the percussion of “entertainment associations” (huahui 花会): “flying cymbals” (feicha 飞镲), stilt-walking (gaoqiao 高跷), dragon lanterns (longdeng 龙灯), and flower drum (huagu 花鼓).\n\n“Religious music”\n\nAs always, despite my criticism of the term, this is a substantial category in the Anthology, subsuming some major traditions of Buddhist and Daoist ritual.\n\nJinmen baojia tu shuo (1846).\n\nFor major insiders’ accounts by temple clerics Zhang Xiuhua and Li Ciyou before and after the 1949 “Liberation”, see n.1 here, leading to Appendix 1 of my book In search of the folk Daoists of north China and the research of Vincent Goossaert.\n\nDaoist band, Tianjin. Tell us more…\n\nFor “Buddhist music” (pp.1141–52) and “Daoist music” (pp.1274–9) the introductions can only serve as a starting point for more sophisticated fieldwork—like the transcriptions (pp.1153–1273 and 1280–1326 respectively). There are slim pickings here—although the section on Daoist temple music provides a remarkable vignette from 1972 (!) on a Pingju opera musician’s visit to Zhang Xiupei 张修培, elderly (former?) abbot of the Niangniang gong temple, to notate his singing for the purposes of “new creation”. This section also introduces Li Zhiyuan 李智远 (1894–1987) of the Lüzu tang and Tianhou gong temples; though laicized after “Liberation”, from 1985 he was able to support the renovation of the Lüzu tang. More promising are the rural areas, where there are always household Daoist bands to explore. The transcriptions end with three items of vocal liturgy from the Western suburbs (pp.1313–26): the popular “Twenty-four Pious Ones” (Ershisi xiao 二十四孝), the “Song of the Skeleton” (cf. the Li family band in north Shanxi), and Yangzhi jingshui 杨枝净水.\n\nThe accounts of many folk groups offer glimpses of the sectarian connection. In Yangliuqing township (known for its nianhua papercuts), the Incense Pagoda Old Association (Xiangta laohui 香塔老会, above) of 14th Street (which we visited all too briefly in 1989) had scriptures including Hunyuan Hong"
