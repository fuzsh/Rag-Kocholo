Among the highlights of this production are the expanded corps de ballet, featuring some of DC's most dynamic talent, original musical compositions and arrangements of traditional flamenco music, and a solid foundation of the authentic flamenco song.\n\nThe rising popularity of flamenco and a concentration of gifted artists has made Washington DC one of the epicenters of the Andalusian art form in the United States. Edwin Aparicio, described by critics as being \"the most amazing dancer seen in years,\" having \"hellfire footwork\" and choreographies with \"beautiful, evocative imagery,\" is at the forefront of the U.S. flamenco movement. His five original productions (Bailes Inéditos, Encuentros, Intimo, Camino/al flamenco and Entresueño) presented in a constellation of US cities earned accolades from flamenco connoisseurs as well as from the mainstream audience for their quality and passion. In the Edwin Aparicio: Selected Works, Aparicio revisits his best original choreographies as he continues to distill the essence of flamenco, stripping away the meaningless trappings and allowing the audience to experience the art in its pure essence.\n\nThe production highlights the individual and collective mastery of the fifteen flamenco performers ranging from highly acclaimed singer Jesús Montoya to the rising stars of flamenco in the US, \"La Genoveva\" and the New York City-based Rebecca Thomas. Original musical arrangements and compositions by the Afghani-born guitarist and percussionist Behzad Habibzai add a fresh layer of art to the choreographic canvas of Edwin Aparicio's work, which is steeped in years of mastery and talent.\n\nOne of the pieces in the production is \"Martinete,\" originally created for Aparicio's Camino/al flamenco, and inspired by the choreographer's personal quest for identity sparked by the Civil War in his native El Salvador and the immigration which followed. \"Alegrias\" from Encuentros is the artist's signature work, incorporating eleven years of Aparicio's experience as a performer, teacher, and choreographer. \"I am particularly excited about this presentation of \"Alegrias,\" as I take it to a new level, pushing the limits of my movement and inspiration, and amplifying it through the expanded corps de ballet.\"\n\nSet in Washington DC's historic Tivoli building, which has been revitalized with the artistic spirit of the GALA Hispanic Theater, Edwin Aparicio: Selected Works is guaranteed to inspire and wow the audience. With only two presentations (Saturday, July 14, and Sunday, July 15, 2007), this is a must-see performance.\n\nWHO:\n\nEdwin Aparicio: Selected Works featuring Edwin Aparicio and Guest Artists\n\nWHAT: Two performances in Washington, D.C.'s Gala Hispanic Theater\n\nWHEN/WHERE: July 14, 2007, 8:00pm\n\nJuly 15, 2007, 4:00pm\n\nGala Hispanic Theatre/Tivoli\n\n3333 14th Street NW, Washington DC 20010\n\nTICKETS www.boxofficetickets.com or call 1-800-494-TIXS (8497)\n\n$35 General Admission\n\nFriday July 20, 2007 8:00pm\n\nPedro Cortez in the Alexandria Guitar Festival\n\nMore info at the International Guitar Institute website.\n\nJuly 20, 21, 22, 24 & 25, 2007\n\nFlamenco Workshop with Anna Menendez at the American Dance Institute\n\nFrom the press release:\n\nTECHNIQUE & CHOREOGRAPHY [TIENTOS]\n\nLEVELS: ADVBEG/ INT AND UP\n\nFriday July 20th 7-9pm\n\nSaturday July 21st 1-3pm\n\nSunday July 22nd 1-3pm\n\nTuesday July 24th 7-9pm\n\nWednesday July 25th 7-9pm\n\nCOST: $30 per two hour class or $130 for all 5 days!\n\n*To register please email Anna directly at (pre-registration recommended).

He began performing at the age of seven, at which time he became known as El Rey del Fandango Grande. As a singer he has performed with many revered flamenco artists, including Fernanda Romero, Isabel Vargas, Andrés Marín, La Cipri, Manuela Salazar, Carmen de Torres, Juan Ogalla, La Truco, Pepa Montes, and Manolete. He has toured throughout the United States and Canada with such artists as José Greco, María Benítez, La Tania, Yaelisas Caminos Flamencos, and Susana DiPalmas Zorongo Flamenco. Media reviewers have dubbed him as the Pavarotti of Flamenco.\n\nTimo Nuñez (Dancer) studied in the United States and abroad with Linda Vega, Roberto Amaral, María Bermudez, Andrés Marín, Domingo Ortega, Farruquito, Rafel Campallo, Manolo Marín, Matilde Coral, and Juana Amaya.
