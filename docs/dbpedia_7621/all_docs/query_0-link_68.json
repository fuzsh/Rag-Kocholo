        "text": "On Saturday, May 14, 2022, the popular ensemble A Palo Seco will take the stage at Flushing Town Hall with a family-friendly flamenco production full of vibrant dance, live music, and emotion. The afternoon event begins with an interactive dance workshop at 1 PM, followed by a lively, not-to-be missed performance at 2:15 PM. We checked in with A Palo Seco’s Artistic Director Rebeca Tomás about her upcoming performance.\n\nMeet Rebeca Tomás\n\nWhen and how did you get started as a flamenco dancer?\n\nI discovered flamenco on a semester abroad in Granada, Spain during my junior year at college. I had grown up a musician (primarily piano, also clarinet), but not a dancer. During my semester in Granada, we went to see Antonio Canales’ production of “Torero,” and that was it. I was enthralled – more than anything, by the intricacies of the rhythms and all the musicality that I heard and saw in the footwork. Then there was the intensity of the singing and the emotional rawness inherent in everything I saw that night. I knew then that I had to make this art from an intimate part of my life. During that semester I did an independent study project on flamenco. I immersed myself in the art form; attending any concert and show I could see. I took dance classes for the first time in my life. My body wasn’t quite ready but my feet were, and I was able to pick up the rhythms pretty easily and would go home and transcribe them musically. After that semester, I finished up college and then went straight back to Granada. I took flamenco classes, as well as ballet to train my body, and classical Spanish dance. I also studied with an ethnomusicologist at the Universidad de Granada, thinking I would most likely go down a more academic path since I had started dancing so late in life. But I became more and more focused on dance and ultimately chose that path. I spent the majority of the next decade in Spain – Granada, Madrid, Sevilla – immersing myself in the art form of flamenco and honing what would become my profession and life passion.\n\nWhat intrigues you most about flamenco music and dance?\n\nWhat originally drew me to the art form continues to be one of my main true loves of flamenco – its rhythmic nature, and all of the intricate textures and groovy feels involved in it… what flamencos call “soniquete.” I am also, as I was in the beginning, drawn to the emotional rawness found in the styles of song that are sung a capella, or “a palo seco,” known as “Cante Jondo,” or “Deep Song.” It is because of this that I named my first production, “A Palo Seco,” which then became the name of my company. As described in the company bio: “A Palo Seco” is a phrase that refers to a bare-bones style of flamenco music, often consisting of singing or percussion alone. This stripped-down aesthetic has become a central theme in artistic director Rebeca Tomas’ choreography, characterizing her biggest departures from tradition, while also rooting her work in the emotional rawness that lies at the heart of the art of flamenco.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been very challenging for performing artists. How did you spend your time while venues were closed? Did you explore any new hobbies or learn new skills?\n\nApart from being a flamenco dancer/ choreographer/ artistic director, I am the mother of two – and when the pandemic hit, my daughter was in kindergarten and my son was in second grade. So I spent much of my time helping to “school” them, navigating zoom and other academic needs, as well as our whole family experience. I delved into the experience, reading all of the Roald Dahl books with them, doing many arts & crafts activities, playing music, playing games, and exploring outdoor spaces.\n\nArtistically, I studied on my own, took online classes with artists in Spain who I never would have been able to study with otherwise, and taught my own online classes as well. I did a couple of video projects, creating fun pieces that I had thought about for a while but never focused on because they wouldn’t necessarily be part of the company repertoire. I was also involved in a project with another company, modeled after the Decameron, in which ten choreographers from the U.S. and Spain each created and filmed a single choreography each day and discussed the process. The project was incredibly inspiring, fun to be involved with, and also quite challenging.\n\nWhat can visitors to Flushing Town Hall expect from your workshop and performance on May 14th?\n\nVisitors can expect a lively, engaging, colorful, and rhythmic flamenco performance by a cast of seven artists, both dancers, and musicians. Designed for a family audience, the pieces we’ll be performing tend be to more of the upbeat side of flamenco, though they’ll also get a taste of what “a palo seco” really means and feels like with our “Martinete” choreography, which features three female dancers in pants and jackets. They will see and hear castanets, “castañuelas,” footwork “zapateo,” rhythmic hand-clapping “palmas,” guitar, percussion (el cajón– a wooden percussive box), tambourines “panderetas,” and lots of colorful and traditional flamenco costumes. The cast includes three female dancers, two female dancers/singers, one male guitarist, one male percussionist/ singer.\n\nThe workshop will give an introduction to flamenco history and break down the art form so that visitors will better understand what they are going to see on stage. We will also teach the basics of flamenco dance and music – including rhythmic hand-clapping, footwork, and how to dance and communicate with the musicians.\n\nThe workshop and show are appropriate for all ages, but probably most enjoyed by ages 4 or 5 and up.\n\nAny new and exciting projects on the horizon for you?\n\nWe are in the process of creating new work that we intend to present as an evening-length production by next Spring 2023.\n\nJoin us on May 14th for flamenco with A Palo Seco! Purchase your in-person tickets for the interactive flamenco workshop and the flamenco performance."
