        "text": "Charisma, talent and freshness define this emblematic flamenco duo.\n\nIsrael Fernández is one of the most celebrated flamenco musicians of his generation. Born with flamenco in his blood, he was brought up in a gypsy family of Toledo. Now he presents his latest album – Pura Sangre (pure blood) – in collaboration with renowned Jerez guitarist Diego del Morao.\n\nThe most personal work to date, this is an intimate look at his surroundings and his way of interacting with the outside world. It is a plea for truth, the most vital expression of an artist who has composed all the lyrics and music which make up this album.\n\nHis album Amor won the Premio Odeón and he has also been nominated for Best Flamenco Album in the Latin Grammy awards.\n\nPart of Flamenco Festival\n\nImage description: This is an image of a street. In the background there are flats which have yellow facades and windows. There is a large pavement infront of the flats with some people sitting and standing casually. In the foreground of the image, a man with long hair leads a black horse with a rope."
