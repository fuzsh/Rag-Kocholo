        "text": "Flamenco is an art form that was developed in Andalusia (southern Spain). It is generally found in three disciplines: cante (song), toque (guitar playing) and baile (dance).\n\nA wide range of feelings and moods (heartache, joy, tragedy, jubilation and fear) are communicated by Flamenco artists through genuine, expressive lyrics characterized by brevity and simplicity.\n\nCante\n\nCante is the vocal expression of flamenco, sung by men and women, preferably seated, with no backing singers.\n\nBaile\n\nFlamenco baile (dance) is a dance of desire and courtship, articulating a wide range of circumstances ranging from sadness to happiness. As Flamenco became more popular, some top dancers incorporated modern dance techniques. In contrast, the traditional technique is intricate, differing depending on whether the performer is male (heavier use of the feet) or female (gentler, more sensual movements).\n\nToque\n\nToque or the art of guitar playing has long exceeded its original role as accompaniment, especially since the 1970s thanks to tralblazers like Paco de Lucía. Manolo Sanlucar and other soloists.\n\nAdditionally, other instruments, including castanets (primarily in dance), palmas (hand clapping) and foot-stomping are traditionally used as well. Moreover, various additional instruments have been added to Flamenco throughout the past decades such as the cajón (percussion instrument), electric and acoustic bass, piano, flute, cello, violin and saxophone.\n\nFlamenco is performed at regular music venues, fan clubs called peñas, nightclubs called tablaos, festivals, religious celebrations such as Holy Week processions, rituals, church ceremonies and at private events.\n\nTransmission traditionally occurred through dynasties, families, social groups and Flamenco clubs, all of which played, and still play, a key role in its preservation and dissemination.\n\nCuriously, some Flamenco performers have unusual artistic nicknames that make reference to their looks, family clan, geographical origin, profession, or some other circumstance. For instance: Terremoto (earthquake), Tomatito (small tomato), Camarón (shrimp), El Cabrero (the goatherder), Habichuela (bean), etc.\n\nFlamenco History\n\nAndalusia (Andalucía in Spanish) in southern Spain is a crossroads of cultures. Indeed, in ancient times, Phoenicians and Greeks opened coastal trading posts. Later, the region was invaded by Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Alans, Visigoths, Byzantines, Arabs, and North African Berbers (Almoravids and Almohads). There was also the peaceful arrival of the Gitanos (Gypsies or Roma) to Spain around the 16th century. And, lastly, in the 20th century, Andalusia welcomed thousands of immigrants from Latin America, Morocco and Romania as well as hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists; some purchased summer homes in or near coastal areas.\n\nMany Spanish scholars believe that Flamenco is the combination of several musical influences: the musical traditions of Spanish Christians, the folk music of the Gitanos (Spanish gypsies), the chants of the Moors, and Sephardic songs. In the essential book, “El Cante Flamenco,” one of Spain’s leading Flamenco experts, Ángel Álvarez Caballero, cites research by Pedro Camacho which indicates that Castilian romances are the main root of Flamenco. The first Flamenco songs are known as tonás and they gave way to the martinete, carcelera, debla, seguiriya (or siguiriya) and saeta.\n\nFlamenco and the Gitano community are closely linked. Certainly, many of the first Flamenco performers were Gitanos who passed down the tradition from generation to generation.\n\nGeographically, most Spanish Flamenco historians have determined that Flamenco was born in Lower Andalusia, which includes the entire Cadiz province, southern Seville province and the Ronda area of Malaga province. In detail, key towns and cities in this area include Flamenco cradles such as Cadiz, Jerez de la Frontera (Cadiz province), Morón de la Frontera (Seville province), and Ronda (Malaga province).\n\nFrom Lower Andalusia, Flamenco spread to the rest of current Andalusia’s provinces: Huelva, Granada, Cordoba, Jaen and Almeria, as well as the neighboring province of Badajoz in the Extremadura region (western Spain) and the province of Murcia in southeastern Spain. Additionally, in the 20th century, Spain’s capital, Madrid became a focal center for Flamenco artists.\n\nEarly Flamenco masters of Cádiz province include mythical singer Tío Luis el de la Juliana, born in Jerez around 1752. He was allegedly an “aguaor”, a water deliverty man; El Planeta born in Cádiz in 1790, he was the first great patriarch of Flamenco singing and quoted by Malaga writer Serafín Estébanez Calderón in Una fiesta en Triana (A party in Triana) with a young accompanist named El Fillo, a great singer from Puerto Real who was 30 years younger than El Planeta.\n\nBy the early 19th century, Flamenco was part of the entertainment at Andalusian inns (posadas) and taverns (tabernas). The early Flamenco artists were mostly poor Gitanos and Payos (a name given by Gitanos to non-gypsies in caló, the Spanish Gypsy language) who performed as a pastime. As the popularity of Flamenco grew, some of the artists became professional performers.\n\nIndeed, the experienced cantaores (singers), who accompanied themselves on guitar, were hired sometimes with dancers to perform at private parties, town fairs and at Flamenco festivals for foreign visitors seeking a glimpse of Spanish culture.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th Century, the cafés cantantes appeared in Seville and other locations. Notably, these were night bars, where the audience had drinks and watched a good music show. As a result, these venues became the foundation of the professional Flamenco artist. Markedly, one of the most famous was Silverio Franconetti, who was very competitive and challenged all the other top singers.\n\nLeading artists from Cadiz province in the 19th Century included Tomás el Nitri, cantaor from El Puerto de Santa María and holder of the 1ª Llave de Oro del Cante (1st Golden Key of Cante; and from Cádiz city, Curro Durse and the iconic Enrique el Mellizo.\n\nMarchenismo\n\nIn the 1920s, singer Pepe Marchena created a controversial revolution in Flamenco. Significantly, he “sweetened” the songs; made them easier to listen to. Thereupon, he selected certain palos (styles) that were more accessible and appealed to a broad range of listeners. Eventually, Pepe Marchena also added orchestral arrangements to Flamenco.\n\nUncommonly, Pepe Marchena wore flamboyant outfits and was one of the first to stand up on stage to perform, instead of sitting down, which was the tradition up to that point. Certainly, Marchena became the most popular Flamenco performer of his time in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s; the first Flamenco star, and was criticized by purists for diluting traditional Flamenco. As a result, Marchena’s success led to many imitators.\n\nThe Marchena-style left out traditional Flamenco. Indeed, for over two decades, the majority of the gigs available were allocated to performers who followed the Marchena style of Flamenco.\n\nOpera Flamenca\n\nOpera Flamenca were shows featuring performers specialized in the lighter side of Flamenco. Some of them were former traditional singers who were forced to adapt in order to continue to make a living. Ordinarily, the shows were meant to be affordable so they were held in large bullfighting rings and other high capacity venues.\n\nFlamenco Renaissance and Newfound Appreciation\n\nIn the mid-1950s, a confluence of events marked the return of traditional Flamenco art and new fans. Chiefly, the series of events included the recording of the first Flamenco Anthology; the rise of the first tablaos (Flamenco nightclubs); the publication of the book Flamencología by Anselmo González Climent; and the Concurso de Córdoba Flamenco contest.\n\nInterestingly, the “Antología del Cante Flamenco” was originally released in France. It was a three-volume set plus a booklet by Tomás Andrade de Silva. Initially, it was ignored in Spain but after France’s Charles Cross Academy gave it its Grand Award, people in Spain reacted with interest. Newspaper articles about the collection were published in Spanish media and Madrid-based record label Hispavox released the anthology in Spain in 1954. Some of the artists featured included Pepe el de la Matrona; Niño Almadén; Rafael Romero; Jarrito; Bernardo el de la Lobitos; and Pericón de Cádiz.\n\nGonzález Climent’s book Flamencología was published in 1955. He was an Argentine author, the son of Andalusian parents, and the book was one of the first scientific studies of Flamenco. The book’s title also coined a new scientific term, Flamencología (Flamencology).\n\nIn 1956, the first Concurso Nacional de Cante Jondo took place in Córdoba. This was yet another step in recovering the essence of the purest Flamenco. The contest was a success and launched the career of one of Flamenco’s stars of that era, Antonio Fernández Díaz, better known as “Fosforito.”\n\nMadrid, Spain’s capital, became the most influential city for Flamenco thanks to the opening of some of the most important tablaos in Spain. This led to many top Flamenco performers moving to Madrid permanently or seasonally as their main base of operation.\n\nThe second half of the 20th century gave rise to highly influential cantaores, some of the best singers of all times. These include legends like Manolo Caracol, Antonio Mairena and Camarón de la Isla. Other noteworthy singers include Chocolate, Fernanda de Utrera, Bernarda de Utrera, Chano Lobato, José Menese, María Vargas, Carmen Linares, and El Pele, among others.\n\nRise of the Guitar Masters\n\nAlthough Spain invented the guitar and produced excellent classical guitar soloists, the initial role of Flamenco guitarists was to accompany singers.\n\nIn the 19th century, several guitarists led the way in guitar innovation. Maestro Patiño is credited as the inventor or innovator of the Flamenco cejilla (guitar capo); singer, guitarist and dancer Paquirri el Guanté; and Juan Gandulla “Habichuela” disciple of Maestro Patiño and accompanist of masterful Jerez singer Don Antonio Chacón and Manuel Torre.\n\nIn the 20th century, A handful of high profile early Flamenco guitar pioneers like Ramón Montoya, Niño Ricardo and Sabicas, elevated the guitar to solo status. However, the biggest breakthrough happened in the 1970s.\n\nIn the 1970s, guitarist Paco de Lucia revolutionized Flamenco by playing instrumental music using the guitar as a lead instrument and adding non-Flamenco percussion and jazz elements. His Brazilian percussionist, Rubem Dantas, introduced the Peruvian cajón to Flamenco, and ever since the cajón has become a standard instrument used by many Flamenco performers. Variations of the Peruvian cajón are now manufactured in Spain under the name of cajón flamenco.\n\nPaco de Lucía’s acclaimed colleagues, Manolo Sanlúcar and Victor Monge “Serranito“ were also part of the early wave of Flamenco guitar innovators. Guitarist Paco Peña became very well known abroad thanks to his numerous tours. He helped introduce Flamenco to international audiences.\n\nThe 1980s, Young Flamencos\n\nIn the 1980s, young entrepreneurs in Madrid created independent record labels such as Mario Pacheco’s Nuevos Medios and Grabaciones Accidentales’ (GASA) Flamenco imprint Flamencos Accidentales. These indie labels approached Flamenco under a new perspective, producing innovative Flamenco artists using modern marketing tools and photography that appealed to wider audiences and hipsters. Consequently, new and rising artists who grew up listening to Flamenco, rock, blues, and salsa as well, were marketed as Jóvenes flamencos (young flamencos) or Nuevo Flamenco (new flamenco).\n\nThe impressive 1980s wave of Young Flamencos included:\n\nVocalists (Cantaores/Cantaoras):\n\nRamón El Portugués, Ray Heredia, Aurora, La Macanita, José El Francés, Enrique Morente, Diego Carrasco, Duquende , José Soto Sorderita, José Mercé, Guadiana, Pepe De Lucía, El Potito, Miguel El Rubio, Pepe Luis Carmona, and Dieguito (now known as Diego) El Cigala.\n\nGuitarists:\n\nLeading guitarists from the Young Flamencos generation include Rafael Riqueni, Pepe Habichuela, Tomatito, Gerardo Núñez, El Viejín, Moraito, Juan Manuel Cañizares, Óscar Herrero, Niño de Pura, and Emilio Caracafé.\n\nBands:\n\nA wave of bands primarily based in Madrid and southern Spain that combined Flamenco with other forms introduced Flamenco to new audiences, including young people and college students who were into rock, pop, jazz, etc. In particular, leading acts included Pata Negra (Flamenco blues), Ketama (Flamenco rock, world music), La Barbería del Sur (Flamenco rock), Willy Giménez y Chanela (Gypsy rumba), Tabletom (Flamenco rock), and Flamenco Jazz/Fusion artists such as Jorge Pardo, Joan Albert Amargós, Carles Benavent, Tino Di Geraldo, Karakatamba, Chano Domínguez, and Pedro Ojesto.\n\nFlamenco as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity\n\nFlamenco was inscribed in 2010 (5.COM) on UNESCO’s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\n\nMoreover, the Statute of Autonomy of the Andalusian region of Spain regards Flamenco as one of the greatest exponents of the Andalusian cultural identity. The Andalusian Institute of Flamenco reinforces this character since it refers to “exclusive competence in matters of knowledge, conservation, research, training, promotion and dissemination of Flamenco as a unique element of the Andalusian cultural heritage“, Statute of Autonomy for Andalusia (Chapter II, Competencies, Article 68. Culture and Heritage).\n\n2020, COVID-19 Devastates Flamenco\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 had a devastating effect on Flamenco. Thousands of performers lost their livelihood after tablaos (Flamenco nightclubs), live venues and festivals shut down for months. Since most of the audiences in tablaos were foreign tourists, the travel restrictions, social distancing and lockdowns in most countries unfortunately meant a catastrophic drop in the number of tourists visiting Spain. As a consequence, many tablao owners suffered an unsustainable loss of revenue. Madrid, which has the largest number of Flamenco nightclubs, saw the loss of iconic venues such as Casa Patas, Café de Chinitas, La Fragua, and Villa Rosa, which shut down permanently.\n\nThe Asociación Nacional Tablaos Flamencos de España (ANTFES) was formed to advocate for the owners of tablaos and the artists that work there, requesting government support during the pandemic.\n\nOne the best tablaos in Madrid, Torres Bermejas reopened in October 2020 under strict safety guidelines. The most famous tablao in Spain, Madrid’s Corral de la Morería reopened in May 20, 2021, after a 14-month shutdown. Other well known Madrid tablaos, Cardamomo and Las Carboneras also reopened in May 2021. Meanwhile, famous tablaos in southern Spain like Puro Arte (Jerez), La Soleá (Granada) and El Patio Sevillano (seville) remained closed during most of 2021.\n\nThe World of Flamenco percussionists\n\nThe list of Flamenco percussionists has increased throughout the years. The leading Flamenco percussionists include Rubem Dantas, Antonio Carmona, Agustín Henke, Agustín Diassera, Paquito González, Chico Fargas, Javi Ruibal, Manuel Soler, José A Galicia “El Gali“, Tino Di Geraldo, Ramón Porrina, Israel Suárez “Piraña“, Julio Jiménez “Chaboli“, Horacio “El Negro” Hernández, Paquito González, Antonio Coronel, José Manuel Ruiz Motos “Bandolero“, Guillermo McGill, Guillermo García Garrote “El Guille”, Amador Lozana, Sergio Martinez, Juan Heredia Cortés, Manuel Flores, and Luis Fernández Salazar “Lucky Losada.”\n\nThere is also an increasing number of female Flamenco percussionists, including Eli Maya, Noelia Heredia González “La Negri” and Marta Orive “La Niña del Cala“.\n\nFlamenco Pianists:\n\nAlthough guitar and percussion are the traditional instruments used in flamenco, the piano has surfaced as another successful musical tool used by Flamenco musicians.

In fact, he developed what he calls the tres flamenco. Raúl Rodríguez Quiñones released the critically acclaimed solo recordings Razón de Son (2014) and the hard cover book+CD La raíz eléctrica (2017).\n\nOne of the rising stars of Andalusian rock in 2019-2021 is Derby Motoreta’s Burrito Kachimba, a group that combines classic Andalusian rock, psychedelia and Flamenco.\n\nSinger and dancer Rosalia became one of the most popular Flamenco crossover acts in 2019 with her mix of Flamenco, pop, and electronic beats.\n\nFlamenco Musical Forms\n\nThe musical forms of Flamenco are divided into palos that can be translated as styles or subgenres. Scholars and performers have identified over 500 types of Flamenco styles. However, many of them are variations of the main palos. Some performers do not follow any rules and make changes to various styles as they please, therefore creating new palos.\n\nThe basic palos are: soleares, siguiriyas, cantiñas, tangos and fandangos. These in turn have generated many variations, most of which are still sung today.\n\nCantiñas – Lively style performed in a major tone. Very similar to soleares. Cantiñas first appeared in the city of Cadiz and the Cadiz Bay area (El Puerto de Santa María, Puerto Real, Rota, San Fernando, and Sanlúcar de Barrameda). Cantiñas include the following palos: alegrías, romeras, mirabrás and caracoles.\n\nFandango – Songs derived from a very popular folk dance found throughout Spain. Fandangos are very numerous and include the following palos: fandango de Huelva, fandango de Almería, fandango de Málaga, fandango de Lucena, malagueñas, granaínas, and taranta.\n\nSeguiriyas – A Flamenco cante jondo (deep song) genre derived from tonás, also known as seguidilla. They are full of drama and pain, and the number of variations is very high. They consist of a powerful wordless introduction followed by a four verse stanza. Seguiriyas have various regional variations: Seguiriyas de Cadiz, Seguiriyas de Jerez, Seguiriyas de Triana, and Seguiriyas de los Puertos.\n\nSoleares – A Flamenco genre of ternary beat, without rational continuity in its words, mainly formed by a quartet and a trio or solearilla de cierre, which is more agile and basic. Although, in some occasions, this conclusion is best defined as a difficult culmination that requires particular vocal qualities and a highly expressive emotion.\n\nTango flamenco – The only non-dramatic variety of the eldest Flamenco genres. The tango of Spain is a festive style, with a faster rhythm, unrelated to the tango of Argentina and Uruguay.\n\nA few Flamenco palos are grouped by region:\n\nCantes de levante includes palos that appeared in eastern Spain, in the Murcia region. Cantes de levante includes cartagenera and cantes mineros (mine songs), a song style that has as theme the mines, its working men and their difficulties.\n\nCantes extremeños – Songs from the Extremadura region.\n\nCantes de ida y vuelta – These are songs developed in Spain that have elements derived from other genres found in Spanish-speaking America. Cantes de ida y vuelta can be translated are roundtrip songs or songs that left Spain and came back transformed from Cuba and other areas of Spanish-speaking America. Genres include rumba, colombianas, and guajira.\n\nOther Palos\n\nAlboreá – Flamenco palo that is meant to be sung only in Gitano marriage ceremonies. The name comes from alba (dawn in Spanish). Many Gypsies refuse to sing it outside this context or in the presence of non-Gypsies thinking that it will lead to bad luck. Also known as albolá and alboleá.\n\nAlegrías – Palo originally from Cádiz. Alegría means joy. It has a 12 beats rhythm and belongs to the cantiñas group. Variations icludes alegrias de Cadiz and alegrias de Cordoba.\n\nBambera – The bambera or bamba derives from traditional Andalusian songs as the cante de columpio (swing song). These songs were known as bambas or mecederos (to sway in a swing in Spanish). It is usually performed with guitar and dance.\n\nBandolás – Songs derived from the Spanish bolero in terms of rhythm and related to all Andalusian fandangos.\n\nBulerías – a very popular and flexible genre that allows plenty of improvisation. The beat is fast-paced. The bulerías transmit liveliness and uproar. It is believed that bulerías were created by the Gitanos of Jerez although it is also popular in Cadiz and Utrera. The bulerías por soleás has a slower rhythm.\n\nCabal or Cabales – This is a seguiriya of change, which means that in all or part of the cante the tonality is changed: from the usual Andalusian tonality to the major mode.\n\nCalesera – Songs created by the caleseros (stagecoach drivers) to entertain themselves during long treks. It is derived from the seguidilla, without chorus.\n\nCampanilleros – This palo derives from religious street songs that are celebrated during the Dawn Rosary since the 17th century. The Flamenco form is credited to Jerez-born cantaor Manuel Torre, who introduced it in 1929. Currently, it is performed during Christmas.\n\nCaña – One of the oldest forms of Flamenco. It is very similar to soleá in terms of rhythm and tonality and may have religious influences. The caña was popular in the early 19th century and rarely performed in present times. The name of the palo is still subject of discussion. Some think it refers to an early song about sugar cane (caña de azucar) while others believe it celebrates the wine glasses that were called cañas in southern Spain.\n\nCaracoles – Songs from Cadiz that belong to the cantiñas group.\n\nCarcelera – Songs about the hardships of prison life. The name is derived from carcel (jail). It is part of the tonás group and is performed without guitar accompaniment.\n\nCartagenera – A type of Flamenco fandango from the Cartagena (Murcia) area in southeastern Spain. Part of the cantes de Levante.\n\nColombianas – Songs or tunes influenced by music from Spanish-speaking America, specially Cuba. Despite the name, it does not come from Colombia. Part of the cantes de ida y vuelta.\n\nDebla – Songs with a couplet of four verses that belongs to the group of cantes performed without guitar. It is derived from the toná and has a more profuse melismatic ornamentation than the carcelera, martinete, nana and saeta, which are also Flamenco styles performed without guitar.\n\nFandanguillo – a lighter version of the fandango. It was very popular in the Opera Flamenca era.\n\nFarruca – This is fundamentally a Flamenco dance style that is rarely sung. It is grounded in a dance from northwestern Spain, part of the tango flamenco family.\n\nMalagueña – songs originally from the Málaga region. It is a variation of the fandango.\n\nGarrotin – A variation of the tango flamenco. It is a festive music style that is rooted in folk music from northern Spain.\n\nGranaina – A type of Fandango from Granada.\n\nGuajira – A cante de ida y vuelta. It is believed that it originally traveled from Spain to Cuba and returned to Spain transformed as punto cubano. The lyrics make reference to Havana and Cuban women.\n\nJabera – An old form of Fandango from Malaga province. The name may have derived from two sisters who were haba or jaba (fava or hava bean) sellers.\n\nLiviana – Transitional light song inspired by the Castillian seguidilla.\n\nMartinete – Originally sung by Gypsy craftsmen in Spain who worked with forges and boilers. The word martinete comes from martillo (Spanish for hammer). Martinete is often performed without guitar accompaniment.\n\nPeteneras – Named after an 18th century singer from Paterna de Rivera (Cádiz) with a 12 beat meter.\n\nRondeñas – Songs from Ronda (Málaga province), a variation of the Flamenco fandango.\n\nSaeta – Passionate devotional or penitence a cappella songs performed at churches or outdoors, especially during Holy Week (Easter). Variations include the saeta cuartelera de Puente Genil.\n\nSerranas – The Serranas (hill songs) have the same beat structure as the siguiriyas, although less intense. Its lyrics revolve around the concerns of and about mountain bandits in southern Spain. More about the Serranas.\n\nTanguillos – A festive and joyful Flamenco genre derived from tango flamenco, found in Cadiz in lower Andalusia.\n\nTarantas – From Almeria in southeastern Spain, derived from the Andalusian fandango.\n\nVerdiales – Part of the Malaga fandangos group.
