        "text": "Rebeca Tomás has the kind of ingénue appeal that brings out the joyful and festive side of flamenco. In other words, if you like your flamenco infused with tragedy, look elsewhere: her soulfulness, at best, is forcefully fresh and poetically tender. On Friday night she returned to Theater 80 St. Marks, a scrappy, intimate space that retains a quirky element of the East Village  the curtain was delayed as an usher went on a spider hunt  with her group of dancers and excellent musicians, led by Pedro Cortés.\n\nIn her new show, “A Palo Seco: Rasgos Flamencos,” which refers to flamenco’s drama and playfulness, Ms. Tomás dropped some previous gimmicks. (Last spring, one number included her performing “Moonlight Sonata” on the piano.) That doesn’t mean that she has become traditional. In “Albanico: ‘Rasgo Flamenco,’ ” Ms. Tomás brandished a Spanish fan, but wielded it like a butterfly knife, lunging from side to side in profile.\n\nAt the start such poses were interposed with blackouts emphasizing shapes over movement. The stage was alive with sounds: dragging her toe on the floor or tapping the fan onto her chest, she generated her own percussive score.\n\nHowever striking her shapes were initially, the solo was dully repetitive and demonstrated one of her main problems: she is more apt to choose a robust stance over nuance and is so aware of the audience that she never lets herself go. Following that lead are her fellow dancers, the lovely Sol La Argentinita and Laura Castellano, who was tense and timid in her soleá solo.\n\nIn “Martinete,” Ms. Tomás showed her choreographic exactitude as the three women, their feet on fire, drifted in and out of unison and canon. But when she swept onto the stage for her alegrías solo  the fan, by the way, reappeared midway through  Ms. Tomás was like a burst of springtime.\n\nWearing a flowing dress in pinks and purples and flicking her long ruffled train like a mermaid’s tail, Ms. Tomás contrasted her winsome spirit with a more serious display of prickling footwork that rooted her into the floor with an earthy power. Finally the dancer was emerging from the package."
