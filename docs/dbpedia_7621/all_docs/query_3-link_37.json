        "text": "BIEN PAGA (6:03)\n\n​\n\nMusic: Miguel Poveda\n\nDate improvised: September 29, 2022\n\nTurn down the volume.\n\nPersonal artistic statement:\n\nBien Paga, composed by Juan Mostazo Morales, is an old song made famous by Spanish-born actor and singer Miguel de Molina. One can see the fragmented clip of this song in the film Esta es mi Vida.\n\n​\n\nBien Paga and others such songs fall into the category of the copla genre – a type of Andalusian Spanish song that combines its music, lyrics and interpretation made popular during the 1930s.\n\n​\n\nThese songs have been carried down throughout the decades and modern flamenco singers such as Poveda and Diego El Cigala give us their sensual interpretative version.\n\n​\n\nThe lyrics are self-explanatory. Sung by a Gypsy man to a paya or non-Gypsy woman, he tells her it is finished between them. She was well-paid with \"gold\" for her caresses and kisses. He has found another- one who gave her kisses of free will.\n\n​\n\nI often wonder about this well-paid woman. Were there regrets? Did she even care? Perhaps she herself was abandoned by a lover which caused her to adopt this mind set. For me the red roses represent the peace between them as he asks her to remember him no more.\n\n​\n\nLa bien pagá\n\nNá te debo\n\nNá te pido\n\nMe voy de tu vera, olvídame ya\n\nQue he pagao con oro tus carnes morenas\n\nNo maldigas, paya\n\nQue estamos en paz\n\nNo te quiero\n\nNo me quieras\n\nSi to' me lo diste, yo na te pedí\n\nNo me eches en cara que to' lo perdiste\n\nTambién a tu vera yo to lo perdí\n\nBien pagá\n\nSi tu eres la bien pagá\n\nPorque tus besos compré\n\nY a mi te supiste dar\n\nPor un puñado de parné\n\nBien pagá, bien pagá\n\nBien pagá fuiste, mujer\n\nNo te engaño\n\nQuiero a otra\n\nNo creas por eso que te traicione\n\nNo cayó en mis brazos\n\nMe dio solo un beso\n\nEl único beso que yo no pague\n\nNá te pido\n\nNá me llevo\n\nEntre esas paredes dejo sepultas\n\nPenas y alegrías\n\nQue te doy y me diste\n\nY esas joyas\n\nQue ahora pa' otro lucirás\n\n​\n\nWell-paid woman\n\nI don't owe you anything\n\nI'm not asking you for anything\n\nI'm leaving your side, so forget me already\n\nBecause I have paid for your sun-tanned flesh with gold\n\nDon't curse, you boor\n\nWe are in peace with each other now\n\nI don't love you\n\nSo don't love me\n\nIf you gave me everything, I never asked for anything\n\nSo don't reproach me by saying that you lost everything\n\nI also lost everything by your side\n\nWell-paid\n\nYes, you are well-paid\n\nBecause I bought your kisses\n\nAnd you surrendered yourself to me\n\nFor a handful of money\n\nWell-paid, well-paid\n\nYou were well-paid, woman\n\nI won't lie to you\n\nI love another woman\n\nBut don't think I betrayed you\n\nShe didn't fall into my arms\n\nShe gave me a single kiss\n\nThe only kiss I didn't pay for\n\nI'm not asking you for anything\n\nI won't take anything with me\n\nIn between these walls I'll bury\n\nThe sorrows and joys28\n\nThat I still give you and that you gave me\n\nAlong with the jewelry\n\nThat you will display for someone else now\n\n​\n\nNANA DE LOS ROSALES (4:02)\n\n​\n\nMusic: Miguel Poveda\n\n​\n\nDate improvised: July 29, 2022\n\nPersonal artistic statement:\n\nNanas, or cradle songs, are melancholic lullabies sung by a parent or grandparent to a disquieting child in hopes of lulling them to sleep. In many cultures these cradles songs have been passed down from generation to generation.\n\nThis year (even amidst the continuing COVID situation), the births of two baby girls gave me great joy. I thank Baby Sage and Baby Luna for being the inspiration for this improv.\n\n​\n\nA dormir va la rosa de los rosales,\n\na dormir va mi niño porque ya es tarde.\n\nA este niño divino lo vela un ángel\n\nque lo arrulla en sus brazos como una madre.\n\nEste niño chiquito no tiene cuna,\n\nsu pare es carpintero y le hará una.\n\nEa, mi niño está durmiendo,\n\ndormío se quea, dormío se quea\n\n​\n\nDREARY DAY (6:03)\n\n​\n\nMusic: Entre rosas y jazmines, composed by Chuscales\n\nDate improvised: May 26, 2022\n\nPersonal artistic statement: Inspired by the poem \"The Rainy Day,\" written in 1841 by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, \"Dreary Day\" expresses the theme of living with depression. In the poem, the author compares his emotional and mental state to the rainy, gloomy weather. As one who has lived with long-term depression, the words of this melancholic poem hit deep within my being. The yellow chair in the piece represents her mental state of depression. It is her dreaded companion always waiting for her no matter how hard she tries to disengage herself from that inescapable state of being. In the end of the piece, she descends on the yellow chair accepting her fate.\n\n​\n\nThe musical backdrop for this improv piece is a beautiful masterpiece – a granainas by Jose Valle Fajardo, known as Chuscales entitled \"Entre Rosas y Jazmines\" (\"Amongst Roses and Jasmines\"). It was, by far, a favorite composition of our singer/guitarist – the late Cesar Alvarez who was compadres with Chuscales. I last performed to this music in 2006 in the project Grito Flamenco – an homage to the passing of Cesar.\n\nRevisiting that time period and seeing myself a much younger dancer void of major injuries was quite emotional. Not only did I feel the passing of time and the wilting away of youth that Longfellow’s poem speaks to us about, but I relived the grief once felt over Cesar’s passing.\n\nThe Rainy Day by Henry Longfellow\n\n​\n\nThe day is cold, and dark, and dreary\n\nIt rains, and the wind is never weary;\n\nThe vine still clings to the mouldering wall,\n\nBut at every gust the dead leaves fall,\n\nAnd the day is dark and dreary.\n\nMy life is cold, and dark, and dreary;\n\nIt rains, and the wind is never weary;\n\nMy thoughts still cling to the mouldering Past,\n\nBut the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast,\n\nAnd the days are dark and dreary.\n\nBe still, sad heart! and cease repining;\n\nBehind the clouds is the sun still shining;\n\nThy fate is the common fate of all,\n\nInto each life some rain must fall,\n\nSome days must be dark and dreary.\n\nUNTITLED (2:39)\n\n​\n\nMusic: TEARS from the album Dustin Henze Ibiza - Licence to Chill (excerpt)\n\n​\n\nDate improvised: May 17, 2022\n\nPersonal artistic statement:\n\nSometimes after an illness, the passing of a loved one or a catastrophic event in one’s life, trying to recover to find yourself and your equilibrium is challenging. And more often than not, the recovery time far surpasses the devastating event that occurred in the first place.\n\nSuch is the case when working on the untitled excerpt “Tears”. Trying to recapture myself as that mature dancer pre COVID and yearning to be in the moment of improvisation was a challenge. I struggled and still am struggling to find that part of my artistic spirit that was lost during the illness phase.\n\nThe music falls under the electronic genre. But it is the powerful ”Flamenco echo” throughout that makes it mysteriously alluring and seductive.\n\nINNER RAGE (Excerpt) (3:55)\n\n​\n\nMusic: Baby Baby by Electro Twins (Summer Chill on the Beach. Vol. 1) or (Get into Balance with Flamenco Chill CD 3 track #5 Joyce)\n\nDate improvised: April 13, 2022\n\nPersonal artistic comment: Life can sometimes throw us a curveball and at times more than one. Between the highs and lows of life, \"walking through the valley\" can be a dark and painful place to be. It can be said that our world has walked through this valley of doom with the devastating Covid pandemic. Whatever the loss —whether globally or personally — \"walking through the valley of the shadow of death\" highlights how fragile and temporal our human existence is.\n\nThe improv piece \"INNER RAGE\" is a reflection after such a difficult walk through the valley. The feeling of not being able to go on, to have to depend on others to carry you through, and the inner conflict with one’s self when independence is greatly diminished and perhaps threatened. The tree branch represents the one who carried you — who pestered you to continue when all you wanted to do was lie down, be left alone to expire — and the self-condemnation you feel when standing on your own two feet with pride and dignity seems impossible.\n\nThank you, daughter of mine, for carrying me through.\n\nTRES CANCIONES AL ESTILO DE COPLA ANDALUZA\n\nThree songs in the style of copla andaluza\n\nMusic: Miguel Poveda\n\n​Personal Artistic Comment: Written and sung by the famous Manolo Caracol, songs like Salvaora date to the early to mid 40’s. During the first half of the 20th century from 1920 to 1955 which included the Spanish Civil war (1936–1939), it was common to see ‘Opera Flamenca’ – musicals based around Andalusian or gypsy settings, mainly love stories. The music was a mixture of Spanish popular song called 'copla andaluza' which Manolo Caracol named zambras. His songs like Salvaora and La niña de fuego became immensely famous in Spain.\n\n​\n\nMany flamenco singers of today have remastered these types of songs adding their own uniqueness. These beautiful interpretations are by Miguel Poveda.\n\nSALVAORA (3:31)\n\nZambra\n\n​\n\nDate improvised: January 6, 2022\n\nROMANCE DE JUAN DE OSUNA (3:37)\n\nRomance gitano\n\n​\n\n​\n\nDate improvised: January 5 2022\n\nLA NIÑA DE FUEGO (4:33)\n\nZambra\n\nDate improvised: January 5 2022\n\nQue razón tenia la pena traidora\n\nque el niño sufriera por la salvaora\n\ndiecisiete años tiene mi criatura\n\ny yo no me extraño de tanta locura.\n\neres tan hermosa como el firmamento.\n\nlástima que tengas malos pensamientos\n\nquién te puso salvaora\n\nque poco te conocía,\n\nel que de ti se enamora,\n\nse pierde pa toa la vida\n\ntengo a mi niño embrujao\n\npor culpa de tu querer\n\nsi yo no fuera casao\n\ncontigo me iba a perder\n\ndios mio que pena mas grande\n\nel alma... me llora..........\n\na ver cuándo suena la hora\n\nque las intenciones\n\nse le vuelvan buenas\n\na la salvaora.\n\n​\n\nHow right was the treacherous pain\n\nthat the child suffers for the Salvaora\n\nseventeen years old is my son\n\nand I'm not surprised with that craziness\n\nyou are as beautiful as the firmament.\n\ntoo bad you have bad thoughts\n\nwho called you salvaora\n\nknew you so little,\n\nthe one who falls in love with you\n\nloses himself for all his life\n\nI have my son bewitched\n\nbecause of your love\n\nif I wasn't married\n\nI'd lose myself with you\n\noh god what a great pain\n\nmy soul...is crying...\n\nlet's see when will come the time\n\nwhen the intentions\n\nturn good\n\nfor the salvaora\n\nComo me duele\n\nel alma\n\nme duele señores\n\nde tanto llorar.\n\n​\n\nNo hay flor como la amapola\n\nni corazón como el mío\n\nque lo sentencian a muerte\n\npor tenerlo \"repartío\".\n\n​\n\nA las dos de la mañana\n\nme vinieron a llevar\n\ntres pares de ojitos negros\n\ny me tuve que entregar.\n\n​\n\nLa mano en el evangelio\n\nla pongo yo aunque me muera\n\nque yo no he \"matao\" a nadie\n\nde noche en la carretera.\n\n​\n\nQue los tormentos de mis negras duquelas\n\nno se los mando ni a mis enemigos\n\nQue yo soñaba con clavito y canela\n\nme despertaron \"pa\" darme el castigo.\n\n​\n\nMi sangre y mi \"vía\"\n\neres mi lunita clara\n\nque con lo mucho que yo te quería\n\nte vas sin volver la cara.\n\n​\n\nLa rosa de los amores\n\nla cortan pobres y ricos\n\ny \"tos\" acaban llorando\n\nigual que los niños chicos.\n\n​\n\nQue los tormentos de mis negras duquelas\n\nno se los mando ni a mis enemigos\n\nque yo soñaba con clavito y canela\n\nme desperataron \"pa\"darme el castigo.\n\n​\n\nMi lunita clara\n\neres mi sangre y mi \"vía\"\n\nque con lo mucho que yo te quería\n\nte vas sin volver la cara\n\nque con lo mucho que yo te quería\n\nte vas sin volver la cara.\n\nLa luna te besa tus lágrimas puras\n\nComo una promesa de buena aventura\n\nLa niña de fuego te llama la gente\n\nY te están dejando que mueras de sed\n\nAy niña de fuego, mi niña de fuego.\n\nDentro de mi alma yo tengo una fuente\n\nPara que tu culpa se incline a beber\n\nAy niña de fuego, mi niña de fuego.\n\nMujer que llora y padece\n\nTe ofrezco la salvación\n\nTe ofrezco la salvación\n\nY el cariño ciego\n\nSoy un hombre bueno que te compadece\n\nAnda, quédate conmigo\n\nNiña de fuego.\n\nCAMINANTE\n\nCollage on Paper and Oil Pastel.\n\nPart of my Painted Diary.\n\nLiliana De Irisarri\n\nInstagram: @lilianadeirisarri5\n\nCaminante is part of an artistic diary that began few years back when Liliana decided to alter a little booklet inheritance from her mother. The book is probably 80 years old but the creation began with her childhood memories. Caminante is one from her memoires of her school. It goes hand in hand with the excerpt from Antonio Machodo's poem Caminante which fueled her inspiration in this creation.\n\nCOVID has given this artist the opportunity to create more and especially to recall more about her life's experiences and more importantly - our stand in this planet.\n\nYes, together, we will continue walking the way of peace and love.\n\nThis image was created in 2020.\n\nA CHRISTMAS LOVE SONG (2:46)\n\n​\n\nMusic: Sia and Greg Kurstin\n\nDate improvised: December 29, 2021\n\nPersonal artistic comment: For many, Christmas is felt as the most wonderful time of the year. As children, we long waited for that time to finally arrive no matter how poor our family was. But for many others Christmas and the coming of a New Year is a sad contemplating time.\n\n​\n\nThe song Snowman utilizes the symbolism of Christmas time in a unique manner. Sia confesses her affection for her snowman, a metaphor for the man she deeply loves. The man she is in love with is a depressed individual. In the lyrics of the song, the snowman who is in jeopardy of melting away, is symbolic of her lover experiencing some sort of breakdown. She tries to uplift his spirits. She assures him that she will never leave him.\n\n​\n\nThe lyrics can be thought of as light and perhaps trivial in keeping to the season of Christmas. But they hold a deeper meaning, at least for me, as I look past the veneer of Christmas cheer. The song holds the message of demonstrating love and human compassion, the true meaning for the season.\n\nMARCAJE POR CANTIŇAS (4:53)\n\n​\n\n​\n\nMusic: Sal de aquí by Mayte Martin\n\nComposer: Popular\n\nDate improvised: December 1, 2021\n\nPersonal Artistic Comment: Cantiňas are melodies from Cadiz – Aires de Cadiz. From the Cantiňas other forms developed such as Romeras, Rosas, Caracoles, Mirabras and Alegrias - the most popular.\n\nOne historical theory states that these songs emerged during the early 19th Century when Spanish partisans gathered along the Atlantic coastline near Cádiz to launch attacks against Napoleon during the Peninsular War. A merging of the music of Cadiz with jotas (songs from Aragón of northern Spain) gave way to Cantiňas and its variations.\n\nAlegrias, which some cantaores and aficionados interchange the name Alegrias and Cantiňas, means joy. The characteristics of these Cadiz melodies express elegance and beauty, whereas the Solea is known as the mother of flamenco cante, Alegrias is known as the queen because traditionally in an epoch of time past, it was the dance for a woman where the focus was more on arm, hand and torso work displaying her feminine grace.\n\nIn Sal de aqui, the amazing Mayte Martin interprets Cantiňas in a very traditional style. I am sure Cesar Alvarez – beloved singer/guitarist for Arte Flamenco wherever his spirit is, would have loved her voice and interpretation.\n\nSal de Aqui letras\n\n¡Ay! Por tabaco a Gibraltar,\n\na Roma se va por bulas,\n\npor tabaco a Gibraltar,\n\npor manzanilla a Sanlúcar,\n\ny a Cái se va por sal.\n\nEres guapa y morena,\n\nte llamas Carmen\n\ny aquí están los papeles\n\npara casarme.\n\nYa la licencia de Roma\n\nla tengo escrita,\n\na esta niña la quiero\n\ndesde chiquita.\n\nEn medio la calle Nueva\n\nManuel de Angustias cantaba,\n\nen medio la calle Nueva,\n\nlas cantiñas de Pinini,\n\naquel gitano de Utrera.\n\n¡Ay, Utrera! cuánto arte,\n\nque tó el que pisa tu suelo\n\nse emborracha con tu cante.\n\nYo soy aquel contrabandista\n\nque siempre huyendo va,\n\ncuando salgo con mi jaca\n\ndel peñón de Gibraltar.\n\nY si me salen a resguardo\n\ny el \"alto\" a mí me dan,\n\ndejo mi jaca al escape\n\nque ya sabe dónde va.\n\nCuando va andando,\n\ncuando va andando\n\nrosas y lirios,\n\nlirios y rosas\n\nva derramando.\n\nQue me han de matar de un tiro,\n\nen esta calle se suena,\n\nque me han de matar de un tiro,\n\nnunca llueve como truena,\n\ncon esa esperanza vivo.\n\nQue a los titirimundis\n\nque yo te pago la entrá,\n\nque si tu mare no quiere\n\n¡Ay! qué dirán, qué dirán...\n\nMARCAJE POR PETENERAS (2:47)\n\n​\n\nMusic: Violin Instrumental, Olvido Lanza\n\nComposer: Popular\n\nDate improvised: November 19, 2021\n\nPersonal Artistic Comment:\n\nThere is a mystique that shrouds the song of Peteneras. Believed to be a cursed palo by some Flamencos and gypsies, it carried a superstitious air about it that some refused to sing or dance it. There are many theories as to its origins. Some flamenco songs/styles of uncertain origin are explored by studying the actual words or verses of the song to make a connection to their origin.\n\nOne popular theory maintains that this palo originated in the town of Paterna de Rivera, hence Peteneras, in the province of Cadiz. According to legend, beautiful Dolores, a cantaora/singer and prostitute, died a violent death at the hands of one of her lovers. Her seductive powers caused the damnation of men or la perdición de los hombres as the song goes.\n\n“Quién te puso Petenera,\n\nNo te supo poner nombre,\n\nQue debió haberte puesto,\n\nLa perdición de los hombres.”\n\n​\n\n\"Who put you Petenera?\n\nHe did not know what name to call you.\n\nWhat should have been put upon you,\n\n“The perdition of men.\"\n\nAnother theory suggests that the Peteneras has Sephardic Jewish roots.\n\n¿Dónde vas bella judía,\n\ntan compuesta y a deshora?\n\nVoy en busca de Rebeco\n\nque está en una sinagoga\n\nWhere are you going beautiful Jewish,\n\nso composed and at the wrong time?\n\nI go in search of Chameco\n\nwho is in a synagogue\n\nAnd yet another theory suggests a connection to South America and Cuba with this letra.\n\n“En la Habana nací yo,\n\nDebajo de una palmera,\n\nAllí me echaron el agua.\n\nCantando la petenera.”\n\n\"In Havana I\n\nwas born,\n\nUnder a palm tree,\n\nthere they poured the water on me.\n\nSinging the petenera.\"\n\n​\n\nAs a young dancer, I was most familiar with the first theory. Traditional Flamenco dancers such as Rosa Duran and Manuela Vargas gave popularity to the Peteneras. And odd, ironic, and more often than not, the piece was and still is danced today in white by amazing dancers such as Mercedes Ruiz, Ana Morales and other greats.\n\n​\n\nCursed with beauty and possessive power over men, perhaps it was due to necessity of life that Dolores chose that lifestyle. And yet somehow, I envision her inner turmoil over her choices always knowing deep inside her final fate at the hands of a jealous lover.\n\nENTRE LOS DOS MUNDOS (4:25)\n\n​\n\nTranslation: Between Both Worlds\n\n​\n\nFirst version (0:00 - 2:12)\n\nSecond version (2:12 - 4:25)\n\n​\n\nArtist: Dorantes – recordando mis años a la guitarra\n\nDate improvised: October 27, 2021\n\nPersonal Artistic Comment: It is said that the veil between the physical and spiritual world is the thinnest especially leading up to Halloween, of Celtic pagan origins, or All Hallows Eve, observed in the Christian liturgical calendar on October 31st.\n\n​\n\nWhy is that?\n\n​\n\nWith days getting shorter, the harvest cycle waning and winter approaching, our natural world prepares to withdraw from the realm of life and growth. It is a time of transition - a mystical gateway passing from season of life through the season of death or hibernation. And if one is magically inclined or believes in such things, and many do, it is a time where form can meet spirit, the seen can encounter the unseen, and the known can connect with the unknown world. So, it is said…\n\n​\n\nThe beautiful melancholic music of Dorantes recalls his years with the guitar and his love for her - la guitarra. He has captured my dancer’s heart in a profound manner that it allows me, expressing in movement, to remember loved ones that have passed on from this realm.\n\n​\n\nThere are two takes on this piece. The first draft enables me to imagine and somehow sense the veil’s existence. The second, becoming more emotionally moved by the weeping guitar, I am almost at the threshold of the veil but cannot cross it.\n\n​\n\nBETWEEN BOTH WORLDS is about grief, a characteristic trait that is, unknowingly at times, embedded in many of the pieces I do. And for those who still carry any burden of grief over losing loved ones regardless of for how long, I hope this simple dance expression somehow caresses your heart.\n\nALAS RECORTADAS (6:00)\n\n​\n\nTranslation: Clipped Wings\n\nMusic: Sur\n\nArtist: David Peña Dorantes\n\nDate improvised: October 23, 2021\n\nPersonal Artistic Comment:\n\nIn Sur, Dorantes musically depicts the very essence of his South, el corazón y el alma del sur, at least that is what I sense in my core. This piece allows me to envision a hawk gliding over the landscape of the south. It saddens me to know that this once majestic hawk has been injured. His freedom, power, and full potential have been restricted. Even so, with clipped wings, the hawk still glides. It is as if the music gives him the will to soar despite his shortcomings.\n\nDate improvised: October 12, 2021\n\nMARCAJE POR SOLEA (4:31)\n\n​\n\nGuitarist: Carlone Planté\n\nSinger: Duquende\n\nPersonal Artistic Comment: Soleá or soleares, in its plural form, comes from the word soledad, meaning solitude or loneliness. The earliest known mention of soleares refers to them as soledades, by Spanish poet, Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer, in 1862. They existed before 1850 as often stated but has never proven. In any event, we can assume they arose in the Triana barrio in Seville in the mid-19th century and from there spread throughout the provinces of Seville and Cadiz, thus allowing the emergences of various styles or flavours of this musical form. Examples include Soleares from Alcalá, Soleares from Triana, Jerez, Lebrija, and Utrera which can be attributed to the singer La Serneta who lived from 1837 to 1910.\n\n​\n\nSoleá is known as the “mother of the cante” as they appear to be the matriarch, a central figure to which all flamenco revolves around. Along with Siguiriyas, they were the springboard so to speak for many other types of flamenco cante.\n\n​\n\nIts pathos and depth along with one of the most beautiful compás in flamenco, is like a crowning jewel in the achievements of the flamenco artform. The songs speak about pain of many kinds while still infusing fragments of the beauty taken from the Andalusian life, countryside, its people, especially the Gypsies.\n\n​\n\nThere are three categories to the soleares – grande, corta and soleariyas – from which bulerias is derived from. And although 'Plentitud' is sung in a faster pace and probably is a mixture of these categories, one thing is for certain, the voice of Duquende expresses the cry of the soleá.\n\nLOST POEM\n\nA friend of Elena's is looking for a poem published between 1968 and 1973 and is offering a reward if you can locate it.

Vices are negative behaviors or habits that don’t start out that way but overwhelming factors in our lives and our world can open the path to detrimental living and co-dependency.\n\nRecalling the movie Days of Wine and Roses brought a vivid memory to mind. As a child, my family lived in poverty. An additional way to make ends meet along with both parents working two jobs, we took in borders. The alcoholic couple in the movie (Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick) could have easily been our two borders, Muriel and Harold, also known by Muriel as Carlos by night. In any event, my parents could not pronounce the name Harold, thus Carlos was it.\n\nBy day, these two, especially Muriel, were sober, sane and pleasant caring people. But by 5pm after work and a stop at the local bar and coming home with a paper bag filled with liquor bottles, we saw and heard a different side of them. Talk about second-hand smoke! We were also exposed to second hand alcoholism. To make matters worse, Muriel and Harold were chain smokers and I wonder still to this day how they did not burn our house down. My parents could have easily evicted them and found better tenants, but the empathy my parents felt, particularly my mother, for Muriel and Harold was very sincere. What sheer stupid blind faith my parents had that all things would be okay! Nevertheless, as the years went by Muriel and Harold slid further and further into the world of alcoholism.\n\nIt is Muriel that I especially remember. She was a long legged woman, slender in stature - almost regal looking. And as a child I wondered why this beautiful loving woman would change personality so quickly. Why, oh why, could she not be that woman that greeted me in the morning?\n\nAnd truth be told, this past year, heading towards two, COVID has tested our patience, strength, courage, and faith beyond measure. Alcohol and substance abuse has increased. Mental health has taken a downward spiral turn with possible elevated suicidal ideation. And truth be told, there have been many a day where I sympathize with Muriel’s drinking away to oblivion.\n\n“Let me drink! Let me be so drunk that I have no eyes to see with, no ears to hear with, no mind to think with and no heart to feel with for the pain cuts too deep. And wake me up, if you can, at the appointed time.” – An ode to Muriel\n\nDate improvised: September 13 2021\n\nAIN'T NO SUNSHINE (3:15)\n\n​\n\nMusical Artist: Joe Cocker\n\nOriginal Lyrics: Bill Withers\n\nPersonal Artistic Comment: Released in 1971 as a B- side to the song Harlem, ‟Ain’t No Sunshine” became a smashing hit which brought fame to Bill Withers. He was inspired to write the song after watching the 1962 movie ‘Days of Wine and Roses’ about a couple who slid into alcoholism while attempting to repair their problematic toxic relationship.\n\n​\n\n‟Ain’t No Sunshine” is a bluesy, heartbreaking ballad about an addictive love and it is no wonder that many artists felt its call to sing it, such as Tom Jones, Paul McCartney and Prince, only to name a few. But it is the later interpretation by Joe Cocker that I have embraced the most probably because his guttural style of singing is similar to Cesar Alvarez's approach to flamenco cante.\n\n​\n\nFor me, the song ‟Ain’t No Sunshine” is about longing, yearning and loneliness one feels when she, he or even it is gone, especially with the exodus of our old way of pre-COVID life. And although the song falls into the blues genre, I can still appreciate and explore it by means of flamenco personal expression.\n\nOH! BLACK IS THIS DAY (2:51)\n\n​\n\nGreek Translation: Αχ! Μαύρη μέρα σήμερα\n\nMusic: Gnossienne No. 4 (Lent)\n\nComposer: Erik Satie (1890)\n\n​\n\n​\n\nPersonal Artistic Comment:\n\nThere are six movements to Satie’s masterpiece of Gnossiennes, a word invented by him, perhaps in connection to the Greek word gnosis meaning knowledge. Some historical accounts mention the influence of Greek culture and mythology in the creation of Gnossiennes as well as Gymnopédies. Satie’s music is eccentric, romantic, melancholic, and lonely.\n\nThe piece \"OH! BLACK IS THIS DAY\" takes its title from the opening line of Αχ! Μαύρη μέρα σήμερα, a poem written by an unknown author. When translated in English, the profoundness of that opening line is somewhat dimmed. The poem was the first, as far as I know, of many written and kept in a journal.\n\nOn December 3, 1951, in a small-town village, a young woman spends her last night surrounded by her mother and siblings. Loved ones have come to bid her farewell. Even though the dilapidated home is filled with people she loves, she feels so alone. She is about to undertake a long, treacherous journey into the unknown that will change her life forever.\n\n​\n\nThe unknown woman is of no importance, only to me as she was my mother, but she represents the many faces of immigrants who left the Old Country in search for a better tomorrow.\n\n​\n\nFor me, the melancholic music of Gnossienne No 4 is my mother, if that makes any sense, on that final day of December 31st, 1951. I sense her in the musical notes of this piece and I am intertwined in her melancholia.\n\nDate improvised: September 13, 2021\n\nDate improvised: September 4, 2021\n\nMADRE ABRAZANDO (4:26)\n\n​\n\nTranslation: Mother Embracing\n\n​\n\nMusic: Batir de Alas (a mi madre) from Sur\n\nTranslation: Flapping Wings (to my mother)\n\nBy: David Peña Dorantes\n\nPersonal Artistic Comment: As I rediscover the genius of Dorantes, I have come to the realization that for me, Dorantes is a storyteller through his amazing music. Actually, we are all something of storytellers, through our life, our work, our arts, or whatever the medium: dance, music, literary arts, visual arts, etc. His music, at least from my end, allows me to once again embrace the idea of portraying a theme. In particular, this music invites me to imagine two doves with wings fluttering as their mother cares for them and finally sets them free.\n\n​\n\nMother Embracing is about one's maternal instinct. Maternal, meaning in how one cares, encourages, guides and supports, not just their children but it goes beyond that. For me, it also symbolizes the nurturing relationship between a teacher and their students. And haven't we all had some memorable teacher that made a difference in our lives?\n\nSIEMPRE ESPERANDO (5:34)\n\n​\n\nTranslation: Always Waiting\n\n​\n\nMusic: Di di, Ana (Tell me Ana) from Sur\n\nBy: David Peña Dorantes\n\n​\n\n​\n\nPersonal Artistic Comment: Unbeknownst as I was improvising, I learned that this hypnotic music has a true melancholic tale to tell. Inspired by an endearing story written by his own father, Dorantes creates Di di, Ana, a sad fairy-tale about one of his aunts longing for the return of her only love. Taken away from her by civilians for whatever the reason one can only guess, she remained alone for the rest of her life.\n\nThere on her balcony, embroidering, she waits and hopes for her eyes to see her love again. Mystical and magical as this music is, I would like to envision that Ana is dancing in the moonlight pleading for the moon to light the path for his safe return.\n\nDate improvised: August 16, 2021\n\nLyrics\n\n​\n\nana, dime porqué bordas, di di, ana sábanas como el jazmín...\n\nen tu balcón por las tardes a quién sueñas ver venir...\n\ntienes treinta primaveras doliéndote en el vivir\n\ny en tus ojos miel y menta y una tristeza sin fin...\n\nana, dime porqué tienes, di, di, ana,\n\nel alma fuera de ti...\n\ndicen que esperas a un hombre\n\nque entre dos viste partir\n\ntienes seca la esperanza\n\nsaber te alivia el sufrir\n\nque cuando se lo llevaron suspirando iba por ti...\n\n​\n\n​\n\nana, tell me why you embroider,\n\non your balcony in the afternoons who you dream of seeing coming...\n\nthirty seasons of spring has passed while you hurt and live\n\nand in your eyes honey and mint and endless sadness...\n\nana, tell me why you have\n\nthe soul outside of you...\n\nthey say you're waiting for a man\n\nthat between two you saw depart\n\nyou have dry hope\n\nknowing relieves you of suffering\n\nthat when they took him away sighing he was going for you...\n\nDate executed: August 12, 2021\n\nWhile strongly associated with the culture and people of Sevilla, this dance form originally developed in the historical region of Castile. Around the 15th century during the era of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain (Isabel of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon), this form was derived from an old Castilian dance of the Seguidillas.\n\nSevillanas gained its status as an independent genre by the 18th century as part of Escuela Bolera (Spanish Classical Dance). It is a cross between Spanish folk dances and ballet influenced strongly by the French. In the 19th century, it was socially performed as Escuela Bolera but by the year 1900, the escuela bolera tradition (for this dance in particular) gave way to melting with flamenco.\n\nSevillanas has many different expressions from classical to flamenco. Therefore it was and still remains a socially important cultural expression. And no other film has captured this vast spectrum as in Carlos Saura's SEVILLANAS (1992).\n\nThis particular Sevillanas sung by Camarón weaves its way in and out of tempo thus allowing the dancer to improvise in those moments. The verses are light in nature. The amusing first verse - the making of a new pair of shoes that are so fine and so flamenco, one has never seen such a beautiful pair. \"Ay que flamenco mi zapatero\" (cobbler). The final verse has a change in mood and tone with Pa qué me llamas - \"Why do you call me? You know you have me (or captured my heart I would like to think) but you hold yourself back. Gazing upon you only crucifies me.\"\n\n​\n\nNevertheless there will be no other Camarón de la Isla. He will live on still influencing both Flamencos and lovers of flamenco today. May your memory be forever eternal, Camarón de la Isla.\n\nSEVILLANAS (4:07)\n\nAl cante: Camarón de la Isla\n\nAl toque: Joaquín Amador y Tomatito\n\nSoundtrack: Carlos Saura, Sevillanas\n\nTOMA QUE TOMA-MI BARRIO-PA QUE ME LLAMAS PRIMA, LYRICS\n\nVerse one\n\nMe voy a hacer unos zapatitos\n\nDel ala de mi sombrero\n\nMuy finos y muy flamenquitos\n\nQué es muy flamenco\n\nMi zapatero\n\nMe voy a hacer unos zapatitos\n\nDel ala de mi sombrero\n\nQue resuenen mis pasitos\n\nQué es muy flamenco mi zapatero\n\nMe voy a hacer unos zapatitos\n\nDel ala de mi sombrero\n\nNo los he visto más bonitos\n\nQue mis zapatitos nuevos\n\nAy que flamenco\n\nMi zapatero\n\nVerse 2\n\n​\n\nYa se van los marineros,\n\nMarujaita, con pan de telera\n\nYa se van los marineros,\n\nMarujaita, se van pa la mar\n\nYa se van pa la mar\n\nY ole mares y mares\n\nYa se van los marineros,\n\nMarujaita, con pan de telera\n\nY el motor rompe el silencio\n\nMarujaita, se van pa\n\nla mar Ya\n\nse van pa la mar Y olea y mares\n\ny mares Y\n\nel motor rompe\n\nel silencio\n\nMarujaita, con\n\npan de telera\n\nAy mi barrio marinero Mi barrio mi barrio Ay mi barrio marinero Mi barrio mi barrio\n\nAy mi barrio\n\nVerse three\n\nDame la mano, dame\n\nDame la mano, dame\n\nY súbete a mi barquilla,\n\nFlamenca, dame la mano\n\nY súbete a mi barquilla\n\nDame la mano, dame\n\nla mano, dame\n\nY súbete a mi barquilla\n\nQue el vuelo de tus volantes Salpica mi chaquetilla\n\nDame la mano dame Y el Guadalquivir\n\nDicen que dijo\n\nSi pudiera llegar hasta el Rocio\n\nAy mi rio\n\nVerse four\n\nPa qué me llamas prima Pa qué me llamas Si me crucifica que te mire Si me crucifica tu mirada\n\nPa qué me\n\nllamas Pa qué\n\nme llamas\n\nprima Pa qué me llamas\n\nSi cuando me tienes te\n\nretienes Y\n\neres como el\n\nvuelo de tu\n\nenagua Pa\n\nqué me llamas Pa qué me llamas prima Pa qué me llamas Pa que me llamas prima Pa qué me llamas\n\nSi me crucifica, ayy\n\nPa qué me llamas\n\nY EL RÍO ESTÁ LLAMANDO (3:23)\n\nTranslation: And The River Is Calling\n\n​\n\nMusic: Semblanza de un Rio, Orobroy (Translation: Semblance of a River)\n\nMusician: David Peña Dorantes\n\n​\n\n​\n\nPersonal Artistic Comment: For me, this brilliant musical piece has captured many geographical sketches and images of a flowing, living river. From its gentle stillness where one wades knee high in its banks, to its rush and unstoppable force. Our senses are stirred, as one can almost feel, hear and touch the water. Drinking from it will soothe you on a hot day. Bathing in its gentle waters will cleanse you. But one senses its ever changing mood and as it builds up force, you are caught in it, hypnotized by its ultimate power.\n\nDate improvised: August 5, 2021\n\n​\n\nTonás\n\n​\n\nNo te reveles serrana\n\nsi habla de ti gente,\n\nyo he hechado el juramento\n\nde pagarle con la muerte.\n\nVinieron y me dijieron\n\nque habías hablado mal de mi.\n\nMira mi buen pensamiento\n\nque no la creia de ti.\n\nDegraciadito de aquel que come pan en\n\ncasa ajena,\n\nsiempre mirandole a la cara, si la ponen\n\nmala o buena.\n\nY si no es verdad,\n\neso que yo digo.\n\nSi no es verdad\n\nque dios me mande la muerte\n\nsi me lo quiere mandar.\n\nDate improvised: August 5, 2021\n\n​\n\n​\n\nDo not think so highly of yourself\n\nif the people speak of you.\n\nI have sworn to pay you with death.\n\nThey came and told me\n\nthat you speak ill of me.\n\nJust imagine my opinion of you\n\nthat I didn't think you capable of it.\n\nDisgraced is one who eats bread\n\nfrom another's house or table,\n\nalways searching his face to see\n\nif they reveal a good or bad opinion.\n\nIf this is not true,\n\nwhat I am saying\n\nif this is not true\n\nmay God send me death\n\nif it is his will to send it to me.\n\n​\n\nMARCAJE POR TONÀS (3:52)\n\nSinger: Chiquilin de Cordoba: text, arrangement, vocals\n\n​\n\nTonás represents the earliest or at least one of the earliest flamenco songs. They are sung \"a palo seco\"' without accompaniment. Tonás - an original deep song (cante jondo) - gave girth to other offspring such as martinetes, deblas, carceleras and saetas.\n\n​\n\nThe text is traditional and dates back to such an early time. Words birthed from the experience of life.\n\n​\n\nThe original verse is a gypsy man speaking to a gypsy woman.\n\nMARCAJE POR RONDEÑA (3:05)\n\nExcerpt only\n\n​\n\nGuitarist: Rampli de Chiclana\n\n​\n\n​\n\nLa Rondeña is a flamenco musical form originating in the town of Ronda in the province Malaga, Spain. Having origins within another flamenco musical form called Fandango Malagueño, it is said that it is \"the oldest fandango actually known\".\n\n​\n\nLa Rondeña spread expansively throughout Andalusia in the 19th century. It is an emotional toque having a free rhythm, reflecting the haunting mountain country near Ronda. Much of the unusual and discordant sound is caused by the re-tuning of two guitar strings. It is said that it is a melody of bandits of the rugged landscape.\n\nDate of performance: June 23, 2021\n\nSeikilos​\n\nBest to play both videos simultaneously.\n\n​\n\nThe Seikilos Epitaph, composed around 200BC, is recognized as one of the oldest complete compositions of the Ancient World. The song of Seikilos is an homage to his dead wife - .Euterpe which also happens to be the name of the Muse of Music in Greek mythology. And while he tells us – the readers - not to grieve, clearly it is grief that has pierced his heart in remembrance of her.\n\n​\n\nThe tombstone has an inscription on it, which reads in Greek:\n\n​\n\nΕἰκὼν ἤ λίθος εἰμί. τίθησί με Σεικίλος ἔνθα μνήμης ἀθανάτου σῆμα πολυχρόνιον.\n\neikṑn ḗ líthos eimí. títhēsí me Seikílos éntha mnḗmēs athanátou sêma polukhrónion.\n\n​\n\nA free translation of this reads: \"I am a tombstone, an image. Seikilos placed me here as a long-lasting sign of deathless remembrance.\"\n\nSeikilos\n\nSeikilos, poem (0:44)\n\nElena Lacomadre\n\n​\n\nSeikilos, harp (0:55)\n\nBonny Chan\n\nDate of performance: June 19, 2021\n\n​\n\n​\n\nMany drafts were executed while collaborating with Gregorius. This particular one has the persistent cell phone ring during a silent dance moment before the reprise restarts. Although annoyed at the time, I decided to keep it in as it now allows me to break out in laughter - perhaps a message to self - 'cheer up - things will get better'.\n\n​\n\nArtistic comment from Gregorius: Gregorius initially wrote Mortem Obire in response to the Covid 19 pandemic. However, during the production of the album a very close friend and colleague from work died. The impact was profound and equal to losing a close family member. It was the most tragic event of his life. The grief was further compounded by the isolation from lockdown and not being able to even visit the hospital in person to say goodbye. There was also the loss of the way life was before and having to face an uncertain future carrying the torch without him. The vocals were recorded while in mourning.\n\n​\n\nBiography: Gregorius is a multi instrumentalist from Toronto. He is working on a forth coming album entitled, Nocturnus. In addition to writing and recording, Gregorius also likes to build experimental instruments and written academic papers on his music.

This piece was composed as a commission to a Dutch amateur. It captures the beautiful tone and charisma flute carries, and is overall elegant and cheerful in its own way.\n\nFantasia No. 5 in C major (4:21)\n\nGeorg Philipp Telemann\n\nTelemann was one of the most renowned composers in the Baroque era. As a fellow flutist, Telemann was an expert on the instrument and wrote this Fantasia in a very precise manner. It has three components: the first part contains typical Italian and French characteristics, the second part resembles a fugue, and the third part mimics a fete/dance.\n\nΤσοπάνα - PASTORA - SHEPHARDESS (5:42)\n\n​\n\nMusic: Πάρε γιατρέ τά γιατρικά (Pare Giatre ta Giatrika)\n\nSung by: ΓΡΗΓΟΡΗΣ ΛΙΟΛΗΣ and ΝΙΚΟΣ ΚΑΨΑΛΗΣ\n\nGreek Clarinet: ΝΙΚΟΣ ΚΑΨΑΛΗΣ\n\n​\n\nGreeks dance and sing for many reasons. Like many cultures, particularly flamenco, dance and song express pain, sorrow and sadness but also joy and happiness. Passed down from generation to generation, Pare Giatre ta Giatrika (Πάρε γιατρέ τά γιατρικά) is a well know folk song from Epirus - an area straddling southern Albania and northwestern Greece. One distinctive song category from this region includes lamenting songs (mirolóyia or dirges). Although Pare Giatre ta Giatrika is - these days - sung and danced for joyful occasions, it is this particular interpretation that carries that lamenting cry.\n\n​\n\nPare Giatre ta Giatrika loses so much when translated in English. Basically it can easily portray a dying or sick man/woman telling his doctor to take away all therapies and best go heal someone else for nothing will cure them. The wound is buried deep within their broken heart.\n\n​\n\nA prominent instrument in folk music of Epirus is the Greek κλαρίνο - clarino or clarinet. The sound is strange, slow, hypnotic and healing. Nikos Kapsalis was well known for his clarino. In the last verse, which is not part of the original text, he sings as if he knew what was to befall him.\n\n\"Oh! What can the doctors do for me now,? Let them come and administer yet another dose. Ay! If Death exists and it does, these bones will surely return to dust.\"\n\n​\n\nSuch a talent and taken away far to soon. Rest in Peace Nikos Kapsalis.\n\n​\n\nPersonal Artistic Comment: Although I cannot make out several words due to dialect, the lyrics of the song possess a deep connection for me in dealing with the passing of my own father. Embedded in me, his words haunt me still decades later in my mind: 'Take it all away for nothing will cure me'. I am sure many caregivers can relate to this.\n\n​\n\nMy father in the 'Old Country' was a shepherd. As a child I would hear stories of this hard occupation often not by choice but by family obligations. It took strength and perseverance to walk this path. What 'Old Country' does not matter. What time period does not matter. This occupation dates back to ancient times and still to this day, it carries on very much the same way for many in remote rural regions across the globe. What matters the most is the need to honour the person holding on to that shepherd's staff.\n\nDate improvised: May 22 2021\n\nShepardsstaff\n\nVEILED (1:21)\n\nOpening excerpt only\n\nMusic: Gades (Alegrias)\n\nArtist: Manolo Carrasco\n\n​\n\n​\n\nPersonal Comment: The Veil dates back several millenniums BC to the Assyrian civilization that flourished in the Mesopotamia regions. Respectable women were forced to wear the veil while women that were concubines and slaves did not have that privilege.\n\nWhen Persia conquered Mesopotamia, the veil was adopted in their social culture. From there the veil spread to neighboring kingdoms.\n\nFast forwarding to today in the current COVID world, the mask is a sign of respect for each other. But glorious will be the day when we will be able to rip them off our faces and finally... breathe.\n\nDate improvised: May 10, 2021\n\nREFLEXIONES: EL AÑO PERDIDO (3:55)\n\nTranslation: Reflections: A lost year\n\n​\n\nMusic: Abuela Perrata from Orobroy\n\nBy: David Peña Dorantes\n\n​\n\nPersonal Artistic Comment:\n\n2020 is considered by many to be a lost year due to COVID - a devastating tower moment that seems to be continuing on as we have entered 2021. As with any major loss in one's life whether - death, health, financial disasters or this pandemic creature that has gripped its claws in our world, one walks through the path of the stages of grief dealing with grave situations, and depending upon the individual - some feel it more than others.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nDate improvised: May 3, 2021\n\nStages of grief include (and not necessarily in that order) are shock, denial, bargaining, anger and pain. One arrives at the realization of final acceptance, but can be left with depression, loneliness and isolation. And the logical part of our mind tends to reflect back upon the why's and how's could this devastation have occurred in the first place.\n\nOf all improvisational pieces that I have explored, this improv of \"Reflexiones: El año perdido\", it is myself I cannot recognize. It portrays a woman who is asking those questions, praying for answers, feeling the anger, loneliness and isolation.\n\nDate improvised: April 30, 2021\n\nMARTINETE (3:57)\n\n​\n\nMusic: De Querer A No Querer from the Album Flamenco\n\nArtist: Miguel Poveda\n\n​\n\n​\n\nConsidered one of the most profound cantes, Martinetes belong to the category of Cante Jondo - deep song of Flamenco. Emerging from primitive songs of the Toná which include Deblas, Carceleras (prison songs), Saetas ( liturgical songs sung at Easter), these are sung a palo seco - meaning without marking or rhythm. Martinetes are songs from the forge - cantes of the blacksmith singing to the rhythm of his hammer, a passionate expression of grief, lamenting about the persecution of the gypsies.\n\nDe querer a no querer\n\nHay un camino muy largo\n\nQue \"to\" el mundo lo recorre\n\nSin saber cómo ni cuando\n\nY ahora que yo soy el yunque\n\nA mí me toca aguantar\n\nCuando yo sea el martillito\n\nNegras las vas a pasar\n\nSi no es verdad\n\nEsto que sale de mi boca\n\nSi no es verdad\n\nQue los pasitos que estoy dando\n\n\"p'adelante\"\n\nSe me vuelvan \"p'atrás\"\n\nThere is a long road that runs between loving and not loving\n\nThat we all travel without knowing when or how\n\nAnd now that I am the anvil\n\nI have to ENDURE the blows.\n\nWhen it is my turn to become the hammer, you will be the one to go through hell.\n\nIf it isn't true, what I am saying\n\nLet the steps that I take forward\n\nEnd up taking me backwards\n\nNANA FLAMENCA (2:36)\n\n​\n\nTranslation: Flamenco cradle song\n\n​\n\nSinger: Pablo Dominguez\n\nGuitarist: James Cosman.\n\n​\n\nLa luna por el cielo\n\nSe va durmiendo\n\nY una cama en las nubes\n\nSe está haciendo.\n\nTiene la luna\n\nLuceritos de plata\n\nJunto a su cuna.\n\nDate improvised: April 23, 2021\n\nPersonal Artistic comment: This was part of a live performance (hence the coughs) set for seven dancers, presented at the Harbourfront Theatre Centre (formerly the du Maurier Theatre) in memory of César Alvarez - original singer and guitarist for Arte Flamenco. The nana was the prelude to the piece entitled A mi lado (At My Side) - a title so fitting- not just for us dancers, but for Pablo and James who stepped in and carried on for Cesar. I will be forever in their debt.\n\nNanas are cradle songs. This nana depicts the moon against the midnight sky. As it nestles itself in a bed of clouds in order to slumber off, it casts precious silver beams of moonlight upon the child's cradle.\n\nCANCIÓN DEL AMOR DOLIDO,\n\nEL AMOR BRUJO (1:59)\n\n​\n\nTranslation: Song of Sorrowing Love\n\n​\n\nMusic: Manuel de Falla\n\nSinger: Roccio Jurado.\n\n​\n\nEl Amor Brujo is the story of Candela--an Andalusian woman who is haunted by her dead husband's ghost. In life, he cheated and tormented her with another woman named Lucia but in death he returns only to haunt Candela. Canción del amor dolido expresses how her blood blazes with jealousy. It seems even in death she cannot seem to escape his torment.\n\nDate improvised: April 3, 2021\n\nPersonal Artistic comment: Originally this piece was created for the Canadian National Exhibition's Say Si to Spain presentation in 1990, intended for only three dancers. It was later performed as part of the full work of El Amor Brujo in November 2002 and then again in 2007. Thirty years later, rediscovering the piece as a much older dancer with many sustained injuries and feeling more like a wounded warrior in dance, my heart still yearns for this music. But even more than that, it is the dancers who I miss the most.\n\nMARCAJE POR TARANTOS\n\n(Excerpt only, 2:52)\n\n​\n\nSong: Por Ti, Me Acuesto Tarde (For you, I go to bed late)\n\nGuitarist: Tomatito\n\nSinger: Pansequito\n\n​\n\nTarantos are from southeast Spain (Almeria, Murcia and Cartagena) and it belongs to the jondo or deep song category of Flamenco.

Strangely enough, they share a common thread. A crying baby is cooed by the mother to enter peaceful sleep while a lamentation or dirge symbolizes the final farewell as one crosses the threshold of life to everlasting rest.\n\nDate improvised: March 6, 2021\n\nGELEM GELEM (7:55)\n\n​\n\nKnown as the national anthem of the Roma/Gypsy people, it is a lamenting soulful song so beautifully expressed by singer Esperanza Fernandez and accompanied by the great Flamenco pianist Dorantes.\n\n​\n\nPersonal artistic comment: Work on this piece began in August of 2020 - during the aftermath of the killing of Mr. George Floyd, the protests around the world, the riots, destruction of historical statues and monuments while still enduring COVID.\n\n​\n\nIn the midst of all this, I was also involved in writing an article about my mother's difficult journey to Canada to be included as part of AN IMMIGRANT STORY - designed and told by Sholom Wargon.\n\nDate improvised: February 17, 2021\n\nGelem Gelem allowed me to lament through recalling these emotional events. Both affected me profoundly while having to close the doors to the school of Arte Flamenco dance school due to the lockdown.\n\n​\n\nGelem Gelem has for me become my improvisational dance ritual before I hang up my dance shoes. With each and every time I execute the piece, it always seems to take part of my soul away or perhaps - just perhaps - Gelem Gelem heals it.\n\nDate improvised: February 6, 2021\n\nBETRAYED (4:48)\n\n​\n\nMusical excerpts in order: Skaros by Stavros Kapsalis, Medea (Tiempo del Dolor) by Manolo Sanlucar, Llanto by Franck Monbaylet\n\n​\n\nPersonal artistic comment: It is said 'hell hath no fury like a woman scorned' as no one possesses a greater wrath or vengeance than a woman when she has been wronged as in the case of Medea.\n\nAt times, this piece allows me to empathetically understand Medea's plight. Other times - more often than not, it is an expression of anger and frustration due to the global pandemic that has seemingly brought most of humanity to their knees. Like a thief, COVID has robbed much of our time, changing our lives to accept a 'new normal' that we did not ask for.\n\nBut with hopeful anticipation, the world will see victory.\n\n​\n\nSynopsis of Medea: In Greek mythology, Medea was written by Euripides (431BC). It is the ill-fated love story of Jason ,the Greek hero of Argos, and Medea, a powerful sorceress and princess of Colchis. In order to help Jason steal the Golden Fleece, Medea betrays her country, father and she murders her brother.\n\nOnce on Greek soil and exiled to Corinth, Jason abandons her and their children in order to advance his political ambitions by agreeing to marry King Creon's daughter. Medea, overwhelmed with grief over the loss of Jason's love, vows revenge on Jason with an unspeakable act that would torture him forever. She slays her own children. She flees to Athens on a golden chariot sent by her grandfather, the god Helios.\n\n​\n\nAdditional reading: - the Wikipedia article on Medea."
