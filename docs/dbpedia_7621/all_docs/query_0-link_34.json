        "text": "INTENDED FOR\n\nBeginners and those to whom the following basic styles of the traditional repertoire of cante flamenco are unknown: alegrías, fandangos a compás and soleares. It is an essential requirement for enrolment in this course to demonstrate the ability to tune.\n\nGOAL\n\nTo introduce the student to the knowledge of vocal technique and compás, as well as to the interpretation of basic flamenco styles.\n\nThe goal of the Cante Flamenco course’s first year is to introduce the students to the technical, rhythmic, melodic, structural, stylistic, literary and expressive knowledge of cante flamenco, through an apprenticeship that begins with the interpretation of the closest cantes to Andalusian folklore (fandangos de Huelva and abandolaos) and ends with some of the fundamental rhythmic cantes of flamenco (tangos, cantiñas and soleares). Another of the mail goals of the Cante Flamenco course’s first year is to introduce the student to the secrets of “cante atrás” through the dance accompaniment to baile por alegrías, bulerías de Cádiz, as well as tientos.\n\nSUBJECTS\n\nThe syllabus is divided into trimesters and comprises theoretical subjects and specific practices (technical, stylistic), taught from Monday to Friday. Three of the subjects of the first year of Cante Flamenco are core subjects (common to all specialities).\n\nINTENDED FOR\n\nStudents who have passed all subjects of the first year of Cante Flamenco at the Fundación Cristina Heeren with an average mark of at least 7.00 (out of 10) or who prove in the level tests that they have a minimum flamenco repertoire. Namely, fandangos a compás, cantiñas, tangos and soleá.\n\nGOAL\n\nTo broaden the students’ stylistic repertoire by learning more complex singing and to consolidate the vocal technique applied to cante, together with introducing the students to the first notions of dance accompaniment, through assembling and analysing choreographies with a medium degree of difficulty.\n\nThe goal of the Cante Flamenco course’s second year is to consolidate the masteryof the techniques worked on in the previous year and to implement them in the execution of flamenco singing, considerably expanding the stylistic repertoire and introducing the study and practice of dance accompaniment cante variation, with the traditional resources of this speciality.\n\nSUBJECTS\n\nThe syllabus is divided into trimesters and comprises theoretical subjects and specific practices (technical, stylistic), taught from Monday to Friday. Four of the subjects of the second year of Cante Flamenco course are core subjects (common to all specialties).\n\nINTENDED FOR\n\nStudents who have passed all subjects of the second year of Cante Flamenco at the Fundación Cristina Heeren with an average mark of at least 7.00 (out of 10) or who prove in the level tests that they have a clear and firm command of flamenco vocal technique and of the dance accompaniment palmas, as well as the knowledge of the main cantes de Levante, the main cantes of the cantiñas family and all the basic styles of soleares. The knowledge of the structure, resources and dance accompaniment basis of soleá, soleá por bulería, caña, cantiñas and tientos-tangos will also be critical as a defining criterion for the advanced level of the cante student.\n\nGOAL\n\nConsolidate the repertoire of styles learnt and broaden the stylistic variety within each palo flamenco. Third year students will be able to search for and adapt lyrics to any sub-style and will have a wide knowledge of canonical flamenco discography. Additionally, they will master the necessary resources for dance accompaniment, being able to react and improvise in any given choreographic structure.\n\nThe goal of the third year of Flamenco Dance is to complete the students’ professional training as cantaores (singers), the most complex styles of each palo flamenco are studied, as well as the different variants in which they have been interpreted. In cante of dance accompaniment, students will study, in addition to basic styles such as the soleá, seguiriya and the fin de fiesta por bulerías, other styles of great importance in the flamenco choreographic universe, such as farruca, bulería por soleá, guajira, martinete, petenera, etc.\n\nAnother goal is for the student to integrate all the technical, stylistic, historical, choreographic and scenographic knowledge as well as to develop a quality artistic personality.\n\nSUBJECTS\n\nThe syllabus is divided into trimesters and comprises theoretical subjects and specific practices (technical, stylistic), taught from Monday to Friday. Two of the subjects of the third year of Cante Flamenco are core subjects (common to all specialities), with the Final Project being the last step in completing the FCH syllabus."
