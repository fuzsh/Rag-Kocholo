Bay Area native Jesse has studied with classical guitarist Angel Miguel Lejarza Leo, flamenco guitar virtuoso Jason Mcguire, and has worked under the mindful instruction of classical guitarist Nicholas Goluses at the Eastman School of Music, University of Rochester, New York. There Jesse completed his Bachelors in Music (Classical Performance) with distinction, and was honored with a Performer’s Certificate, demonstrating excellence in guitar performance. During his undergraduate studies, Jesse performed in masterclasses led by the prestigious GFA winner, Tengyue Zhang, and Bach expert, Paul Galbraith. His time at Eastman has given him a strong background in music theory; he is an advocate for the written and aural analysis of music, and stresses the importance of composition and instrumental exploration. As a performer and teacher, Jesse specializes in flamenco and classical guitar, though he offers instruction in a variety of genres including: folk, blues, fingerstyle, pop, rock and rumba, to name a few. As a theory educator, Jesse covers theoretical concepts dating as far back as the Baroque, and addresses concepts of harmony and improvisation that overlap with aspects of jazz and contemporary music. Lessons are tailored to meet each individual student’s needs, interests, and various learning styles in order to ensure enthusiasm and musical growth. His patience and humor make learning fun.\n\n​\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/jessetorremusic/\n\nW e are flamenc@s, we are diverse, we are evolving, and WE ARE READY!\n\n¡ FLAMENKING! is our passion, our voice, our expression of life lead by Flamenco which is from Andalucia, Spain, with a twist of wherever we're from. We met in the US through the study of this artform, which we love to showcase the world that we are here and feeling all the emotions around us such as sadness, frustration, anger, despair, solitude, breakthrough, joy, happiness, and beyond. You must see the power of sharing all of them together to embrace life through Flamenco!\n\n​\n\nM izuho Sato Flamenco Company is a brand new flamenco company based in San Francisco which includes so many immigrant dancers and musicians from all over the world which makes us very unique. Artistic director Mizuho Sato was born in Japan, trained as a classic ballet dancer since the age of 3, switched her career to flamenco at 18 while she was studying her major of Sociology in Sophia University in Japan. Mizuho is an award winner of Japanese Flamenco Association and Spanish Ambassador at the age of 20. Then she moved her base to Los Angeles in 2003. Since then she was featured in movies like \"Puss in Boots\" by Dreamworks, Los Angeles Flamenco documentary \"KUMPANIA\" by Katina Dunn, and has been teaching and performing at so many flamenco venues and festivals inside and outside of California. She was producing her student shows and workshops of Spanish artists every year in LA for a decade.\n\n​\n\nMizuho relocated to the Bay Area in 2015 due to her husband's job. She was suffering under her husband's alcoholism and verbal abuse, so she decided to leave him in 2018. Then he passed away in March 2022. During this hard time, Flamenco was her savior of life. Flamenco kept her motivated and healed her constantly. Throughout this tough time, she was still teaching kids and adults and continued performing nonstop.\n\nA fter COVID lockdown and frustrating zoom lessons, it took us over a year to prepare for this recital. It is very emotional that we're finally here to present the world how strong and resilient we are, and how much joy, laughter, dedication and love we create when we're together.\n\n​\n\nFlamenco is alive in Bay Area, and we're a brand new flamenco company in San Francisco directed by Mizuho Sato who is now more determined and on fire than ever to serve the community.
