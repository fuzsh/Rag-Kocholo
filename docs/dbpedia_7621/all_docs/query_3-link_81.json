        "text": "Megan\n\nLindsey is unique in the world of Flamenco because she has studied the history and culture extensively. She does so much more than teach you steps. She explains and connects palos (styles) with movements and can give you reasoning to help you understand why something is done, and where to do it in the cante (singing). She breaks down the mystery of Flamenco for the average person who may know nothing. You always leave her class with more knowledge than you came in with. I cannot recommend her classes enough!\n\nSharon\n\nLindsey Bourassa makes learning the art of Flamenco dance thoroughly enjoyable. Ms. Bourassa supports her students at whatever level they are at & breaks down the elements of flamenco: Its history, rhythms, singing, footwork and choreography into easy to learn sections. So thankful to have found a flamenco artist who is also a wonderful teacher.\n\nSara\n\nLearning how to flamenco dance has been a lifelong dream of mine; luckily I have Lindsey to help me make that dream a reality! Lindsey is a beautiful dancer, and a teacher who provides a safe, fun, inspiring environment to learn in. She not only inspires me as a dancer but as a human being... Learning Flamenco dance is a fantastic adventure and I’m thrilled to have Lindsey guiding me through it.\n\nRennie\n\nLindsey really takes care to nurture every level of ability from total beginners to more experienced dancers. Aside from being extremely talented and knowledgeable of Flamenco, Lindsey is a caring, mindful, professional, organized and articulate teacher.\n\nCindy\n\nLindsey takes this vibrant style of song, music, and dance developed over centuries and provides a clear and straightforward approach to begin learning flamenco dancing. I knew I appreciated dancing, but I never realized how much I would enjoy her classes, and that I would love dancing this much again! It’s just fabulously fun. I’m glad I found her and this community.\n\nCheryl\n\nLindsey Bourassa has an exceptional talent for teaching a very challenging dance form, flamenco! She has the inherent ability to break down flamenco components piece by piece for all her students and connect them together again in a clear, comprehensible style all her own. It is rare to find a dance teacher that is also a beautiful dancer in her own right. Lindsey is both an extraordinary teacher and dancer. I have learned more about this art form in my short time with her than I have in my past years of flamenco study. Gracias Lindsey, eres la mejor!"
