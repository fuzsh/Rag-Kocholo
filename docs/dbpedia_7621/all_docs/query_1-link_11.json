Whether you’re staying with us or simply visiting, we invite you to immerse yourself in the vibrant world of The Art House.\n\nStep Into History at El Martinete\n\nEnter El Martinete, once the personal residence of the legendary flamenco dancer Antonio Ruiz Soler, known globally as “El Bailarín.” This villa, synonymous with elegance and style, stands as a testament to Antonio’s extraordinary life and career. Today, when you cross its threshold, you step into a realm where the past dances with the present, filled with the echoes of Antonio’s formidable legacy.\n\nAntonio Ruiz Soler: The Maestro of Flamenco\n\nBorn on November 4, 1921, in Seville, Antonio grew up to become a towering figure in the world of Spanish dance. As a dancer, choreographer, and later the Artistic Director of the Spanish National Ballet, he wielded significant influence from 1980 to 1983 and again in 1989. His death on February 5, 1996, in Madrid marked the end of an era but the beginning of a lasting legacy. Flamenco, the dance form he so passionately championed, was declared a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2010, a reflection of its global cultural significance—an effort greatly advanced by Antonio’s dedication.\n\nInnovation in Motion: The Martinete\n\nAntonio’s creative genius was particularly evident in his adaptation of the ‘Martinetes’, traditional flamenco forms that draw inspiration from the rhythms of Andalusian blacksmiths working at their anvils. In the 1950s, he transformed these rhythms into a vibrant dance form known for its intensity and emotional depth, making the Martinete synonymous with his name and a highlight of his performances.\n\nA Legendary Partnership: Antonio and Rosario\n\nFrom the young age of six, Antonio displayed prodigious talent, which only grew as he partnered with Rosario (Florence Pérez Padilla). Together, known as Los Chavalillos Sevillanos (The Kids from Seville), they toured globally, enchanting audiences for 24 years with their synchronicity and grace, including a notable 12-year period in North America where they also ventured into cinema.\n\nAntonio’s World Stage\n\nAntonio’s influence extended far beyond the dance floor. He was a favorite among the elite, sharing stages and moments with icons like Ava Gardner, Gina Lollobrigida, and Vivien Leigh, and drawing admiration from artists such as Pablo Picasso.
