I would be happy to receive corrections and comments. Most performances forbid the use of cameras or video recorders. Whatever photos I can take I generally post on flicker but since 2016 I have opted to post some here.\n\nMadrid Sojourn 19/2-19/2/2016\n\n18 February, 2016, Villa Rosa, Madrid, 9pm\n\nSqueezed in one more tablao and happy I did. Entry was 35 euro. The young cast was dancers: Jose Maldonado, Vanessa Coloma and Immaculada Aranda. Guitar: Yeray Cortes and Singer: Ismael de la Rosa ‘La Bola’.\n\nThis was a long show starting with an extended musical bulerias then each of the woman did two dancers interspersed with a guitar solo. Of the female dancers Vanessa was the most appealing. She left it all the stage and I felt she was dancing for me. Her style was muy gitano. I was even more sympathetic once I realised she had a head cold like me.\n\nNothing however could have prepared me for Jose. He ripped up the stage and met all my male dancer criteria – interesting, athletic choreography, faultless compas, humour and the x-factor, i.e. you never knew what was coming next in his alegria. He literally danced on the edge. Loved him.\n\nBoth guitarist and singer are very talented but no goosebump moments.\n\n13/2/2015 CASA PATAS 22:30HRS\n\nAnother entertaining evening at this venue that has launched so many careers. The 36 euro drink and show per person package is a little steep for the tiny space one has to cram into but let’s just put that down to the experience. I’d just be concerned if there was a fire and you were stuck at the back of the L.\n\nCast dancers: Amelia Varga, Maria Carretero and Adrian Dominguez, singers: ‘Chaleco’ Manuel Palacin, Felix de Lola and another older man who was not listed on the bill. Guitarist was Jose Arenas.\n\nThey began with a group dance, almost a fin de fiesta, which was highly synchronised. Then we had a song and guitar section including bulerias. The first solo dance was Maria’s guajira eith abañico, Adrian did an alegrias and Amelia finished with a solea con bata de cola. The female dancers were strong, Amelia and Maria were both accomplished, but I felt they stayed very much in their comfort zone. Adrian, from Seville, is one of those explosive young men who seem to have one speed and intensity – high. I really enjoyed Chaleco, two duende moments in his singing. Jose Arenas had to work really as the only guitarist with the consequence that his guitar was miked too high and sounded really twangy, at least when he was playing alone.\n\nMaria Carretara\n\nAdrian Dominguez\n\nAmelia Varga\n\n14/2/2016 CORRAL DE LA MORERIA 20:00HRS\n\nOne of the classy touches at this tablao is the printed cast list, with notes on the dancers and on one of the singers, Chelo, in Spanish and English, that one finds on the table. We paid 49.50 euros per person for a drink and show package and as noted in the blog we enjoyed wines and tapas that brought our total spend to 140 euro. Steep for a 90 minute experience.\n\nCast: Dancers Marco Flores, Claudia Cruz and Jose Manuel Alvarez. Singers: Chelo Pantoja, Luis Moneo, Emilio Florido and Manuel Gago. Guitarists: Jose Almarcha and Antonia Jimenez.\n\nI chose this show because of Marco Flores, Antonia was not listed on the website so she was a huge bonus. It was their final show of the run and being St V Day was packed out. Marco was as wonderful as ever and Jose Manuel was certainly up to the task but not in Marco’s league. We found Claudia a little underwhelming. Like the female dancers the night before she seemed to stay in the zone but expected a lot of applause for not a lot in her alegria con bata de cola. Chela has a huge personality and typical Jerez gitano style but she shouts full volume with microphone which becomes boring. To be honest I enjoyed the male singers, especially Emilio Florido, the most. Even Antonia’s solo didn’t move me as I hoped. Am I becoming hardened? Photos sin flash only allowed in first five minutes which is fair, but the announcement didn’t stop people blatently ignoring that audience rule.\n\nFestival de Jerez IXX week two February 2105\n\nI had too much fun and worked too hard on my dance to record the shows I saw. Suffice to say it was a surfeit of talent.\n\nGo here for the full festival program http://www.jerez.es/webs_municipales/festival_jerez/otras_ediciones/festival_jerez2/\n\nMadrid Sojourn 14/2-20/2/2015\n\n14/2/2015 PABLO RUBEN MALDONADO\n\nMadrid gave me a Valentine’s Day gift, a sublime event produced by flamenco jazz pianist Pablo Ruben Maldonado, one of several scheduled with various guest artists this month that he calls ‘Flamenco Backstage’. The venue was a large studio in Amor de Dios, the Flamenco and Spanish Dance Centre, which nicely fit a grand piano, four rows of seating in an L-shape, a small bar and still had plenty of room for the dancer, Leilam Broukhim and singer, Eva Duran. For the tiny sum of 13 euros (drink included) I enjoyed ninety minutes with a short interval of tarantos, tangos, a copla sung by Eva, farrucca with Argentinian tango, malagueña, solea and alegria! Pablo can play anything he turns his mind to and I didn’t miss the guitar one beat, moreover he is an engaging presence. The warm, humorous interaction between the three artists was delightful. Eva is a consummate professional. At one point Pablo asked what she would like to sing next to which she replied, ‘I don’t mind’. ‘Perhaps you’d like to sing a copla’ he then said, to which Eva’s riposte (said with a grin) was, ‘It seems I do!’. Leilam was polished and her solea to piano only was surprisingly moving.\n\n15/2/2015 TABLAO CARDAMOMO\n\nI’m working my way round the tablaos and flamenco venues starting with those closest to my apartment in calle de la Cruz. Cardamomo tablao came with a hefty price tag, 39 euros for the ninety minute show (with 15 minute interval) and one drink. Dancers were Raquel Ortega, Noe Barroso, Paloma Fantovo and Cristian Perez. Singers were listed as Cancu (I could not verify this name) and Laura Abadia. Guitarists were David Jimenez and Petete.\n\nI’ll start with what I liked: Raquel is a trooper, 100% effort in her two solos, one featured blisteringly fast castañuelas, and Noe similarly gave us a great solo performance. They are both tall and slim and the stage seemed small for them, plus they were having to dance in two directions as the elevated stage is in the left hand corner and tables run to the three o’clock and six o’clock with a wall separating them. Happily I was in the six o’clock sectionnot too far back. There are many tables with limited view.\n\nPaloma is an unusual dancer (to me). She dancers with a very agressive style much of the time. Can’t fault her effort or footwork, especially contratiempo en silencio, but I never warmed to her. She is the kind of dancer who performs for her fellow artists not the paying public. She wore the same plainish dress the whole show (Raquel had three costumes) and her hair was in a plain ponytail with no makeup or jewelry or adornment of any kind. Strange choice for a tablao dancer. Or maybe she arrived late and forgot her stuff?!\n\nCristian, on the other hand was smartly turned out, and worked the audience well, ensuring he danced as much to the three o’clock seating as to my area. He is a spinner, turning almost as though he is on ice skates. Dizzying but wonderful.\n\nFrankly I don’t rate the singers based on their performance. They kept haranguing the sound technician to turn their microphones up to the point that there was feedback twice and Laura sounded like a metallic screech. Cancu complained of a sore throat so maybe he should have got a substitute.\n\nIt certainly was not an educated or polite crowd. Halfway through the show when David Jimenez began his solo guitar piece people were talking over the top so much that he stopped and asked them to be quiet. One Spanish speaking woman near me arrived late then talked to her date practically the whole show.\n\nI blame venue management as at no point were the artists introduced, I had to ferret out that information, and no one set the ground rules for the audience members. No wonder the punters thought they could behave any way they liked. Oddly there was no fin de fiesta.\n\n17/2/2015 EVA YERBABUENA\n\n‘¡Ay!’ the solo dance show by Eva Yerbabuena was staged at the large, raked theatre within Matadero Madrid, a wonderful exhibition and performance space reclaimed and repurposed as a ‘centre for contemporary creation’ from being a livestock market and slaughterhouse. The theatre was almost full the night I went. I paid 23.75 euros for a seat half way back. Excellent view. I’d seen this show, with musical direction by Paco Jarana, at the Festival de Jerez 2014, but Eva has changed some elements. The spotlight walking entrance, the table that splits and the giant leaning chair are all still there. The performers on the night were slightly altered too from what was published. None of the listed singers performed on my night. The only one I can be sure of was Jose Valencia which I was thrilled about, he sang at the Festival show too. He never disappoints. The guitarist was Paco Jarana, the violinist Vladimir Dimitrenco, and the percussionist Antonio Coronel.\n\nThis was a dance marathon, no intermission, only a few pauses when Eva is motionless reclined on a prop and at one point off stage during a voice piece. I enjoyed it more than last time. Eva is inventive and her footwork is second to none. A quibble might be the number of repetitions of movements. Interestingly she never smiles in this show, her face was expressionless or agonised. She smiled during the standing ovation.\n\n18/02/2015 CASA PATAS\n\nThis is the tabalo venue I was really looking forward to and it is literally five minutes walk from my apartment. Over the past thirty years countless moments of ‘duende’ have happened in Casa Patas. There is great archival footage on youtube. To choose just one clip here is a fin de fiesta. Paloma Fantova (around 4:00) and David Paniagua (around 5:00) both feature . Casa Patas\n\nTonight’s show was performed by dancers Irene ‘La Siento’ and David Paniagua with singers Jose Jimenez, Saul Quiros and Antonio Fernandez and the superb guitarist Pino Losada.\n\nMy ‘show including drink’ ticket was 36 euros. Excellent value for Madrid. To reach the performance room one walks through the Casa Patas restaurant. Clearly the food and drink are quality as it was full and not all came to see the show.\n\nIn contrast to Cardamomo, Casa Patas takes its performance standard very seriously with clear signs about no videoing, no flash photography and a respectful attitude to the artists. The show comprised two 35 minute halves with a fifteen minute interval. The elevated stage sits in a corner position with small, round tables fanning out in front and to the right side but with no visual obstacles. My allocated seat was to the right of the stage only a hand’s width from the edge of the stage. I had confidence in the dancers but at times they came perilously close to me. In Irene’s second solo she stomped so hard that an empty chair vibrated to the edge and fell off stage! The sound system was excellent and I felt the artists, the technician and the management were working as a team to give us a quality experience. The lighting was quite low a lot of the time which helped me make the decision to not take any photos of the dancers during the performance, simply focus on the performers. All the artists were strong and it was especially good to have the three different male voices, young and light to deep and more mature styles.\n\n……………………………………………………..\n\nBruce Mason Theatre, Takapuna Beach, Auckland, New Zealand, 8pm, 20 and 21 November, 2013\n\n‘Puerto Flamenco’\n\nThe show’s name is the name of this five person touring company from Spain. The lead members are Francesca Grima, ‘La Chica’ (dancer) and her husband Andrej Vujicic (cajon player). The other members of the group on this occasion were Abel Harana (dancer), Inma ‘La Carbonera’ (singer) and Mariano Campallo (guitar).\n\nAs the company were not coming to Australia on this trip, (their main reason for being in the southern hemisphere was as invited artists at the Gypsy Festival in Noumea, New Caledonia) I had to travel across the water to see them.\n\nWith such a small group the perfect formula is tablao style that showcases each of the artists, as well as choreographing several joint pieces. La Chica’s alegria with bata de cola and manton was elegant and sexy by turn with a charming improvised silencio. Abel astonished with his speed and soniquete. The audience adored him. On both nights I felt my throat catching as Inma’s voice sang of intolerable sorrow. It is a huge ask of a flamenco singer to carry a full show such as this and she did it beautifully two nights in a row. The guitar and cajon solos were virtuoso performances, a pure treat for this flamenco starved fan. Both nights the fin de fiesta was charming, especially Mariano’s little solo. He is clearly gifted like his famous dancing brother and sister!\n\n………………………….\n\nFriday 15 March, 2013, 10:30pm Pena Torres Macarena, Seville\n\nIn remembrance by the Mendez Family of La Paquera de Jerez\n\nFirst Part:\n\nCante: Antonio Mendez, Carmen MendezA, Carmeli Mendez, Mila Mendez\n\nGuitarists: Manuel Parrilla was listed but I don’t think it was him, still checking and Thiago Vasquez\n\nDancer: ‘El Zorri’\n\nSecond Part:\n\nCante: Jose Mendez\n\nGuitarist: Antonio Moya\n\nThe format of having the accomplished amateur singers present first followed by the professional cantaor made for a wonderful night. Each had a very personal style, no one was trying to replicate La Paquera. I especially liked Antonio Mendez for his bright tone and unusual phrasing. The septuagenarian ‘El Zorri’ showed off his old school bulerias and the women danced a little too. After the second part the whole lot got on stage for several more songs and in the fin de fiesta we had some wonderful pataitas from Carmen Ledesma.\n\n————\n\nThursday 14 March, 2013, 9pm, Cajasol Centro Cultural, Jueves Flamenco, Seville\n\n12.60 euros third row centre seat. (30% dance student discount)\n\n‘Giraldillos’\n\nCante and Mandola: Jose Angel Carmona\n\nGuitar: Juan Requena\n\nSpecial Dance Collaboration: Joaquin Grilo\n\nPalmas: Los Melli (brothers)\n\nProgram\n\nTaranta, malagueña y abandalao\n\nSolea por bulerias\n\nBulerias\n\nColombiana\n\nFandangos\n\nCantiñas\n\nBulerias\n\nThis show was an equal partnership between Requena and Angel Carmona. Requena started solo and Angel Carmona joined him for the second piece. It was not until the Seguiriyas that Grilo stepped on stage. We had the man in black again but this was a very different dance to what we had seen in Jerez, powerful and emotional. He came back for a brief Cantiñas dressed in white jeans, shirt and scarf and then we had his wonderful Bulerias to finish. It was a fairly short program and no amount of clapping would bring them back.\n\n—————–\n\nWednesday 13 March 10:30pm, Peña Torres Macarena, Seville\n\n6 euro general entry\n\nCante: Eva Lebri and Melchor Campos\n\nGuitar: Pedro Sanchez\n\nDance: Almudena Serrano\n\nIt was such a treat to have the two singers, Melchor with his husky gitano sound and Eva’s soulful, smooth voice. I always enjoy Pedro Danchez and on this night he played a really long, intricate solo that must have been exhausting butit was clear he enjoyed himself all evening. Almudena danced a high intensity, pounding Solea. She work right to the very endge of the raise stage and seemed to go into a trance about a third of the way through, almost backing into the Sanchez. Her second dance was an Alegrias de Cadiz with quite a short bata de cola and manton. She had a little trouble a couple of times with the manton, the ceiling is quite low, but it was a great performance. The fin de fiesta involved about five young friends/family members who are of the ‘stomping Bulerias’ school which I don’t enjoy at all.\n\n——————–\n\nTuesday, 12 March, 9pm, Teatro Central, Seville\n\n17 euro assigned seating\n\n‘Hippytano’ by Diego Carrasco\n\nCante: Dieo Carrasco\n\nGuitar: Curro Carrasco\n\nBass Guitar: Ignacio Cintado\n\nDrums: Ane Carrasco\n\nGuitar, Percussion and Voice: Luis Periquin\n\nPercussion: Juan Grande\n\nBacking vocals and Palmas: Maloco, Joselete\n\nAt almost 60 Diego Carrasco has reinvented himself professionally several times already and this is the latest iteration of his unique, playful approach to flamenco. ‘Hippytano’ is the name of his new album. It was a family affair as usual but this time all male musicians. There were three percussionists, two flamenco guitarists, a bass guitarist and two singers so there was quite a lot going on most of the time and when Diego stepped off stage to change as he did twice, they kept up the momentum with some great swinging rhythms and a couple of songs sung by Maloco and Joselete. Diego has such a infectious way of interpreting the music and is still light on his feet. At one stage we were asked to join in the palmas and sing along. We did ok with the palmas but the singing was woeful! He had family in the front row who reluctantly went on stage for the fin de fiesta which was amusing, especially the huge man wearing jeans, who lumbered up on stage and then starting a bum wiggle, in tiempo, holding his arse! Should be on youtube!\n\nMonday 11 March, 2013, 10:30pm La Caja Negra, Sevilla\n\n6 euro general entry, beer 2 euro\n\nDancer: Sonja Naranja y su cuadro\n\nI could not find out the singer or guitarist’s name. I liked the young singer. Very sincere.\n\nSonia danced a Farrucca. It was good but it was enough for me, I did not stay for the second dance.\n\n—————\n\nSaturday 9 March, 2013, 9pm Teatro Villamarta, Festival de Jerez, Jerez de la Frontera\n\n37 euro stall seat six rows from the stage in the centre.\n\n‘Federico Segun Lorca’ by the Eva Yerbabuena Ballet Flamenco\n\nDance, original idea and artistic direction: Eva Yerbabuena\n\nCorps de ballet: Mercedes de Cordoba, Lorena Franco, Maria Moreno, Eduardo Guererro, Christian Lozano, Moises Navarro\n\nSpecial Appearance: Asime Can Ozozer\n\nGuitar and Musical Direction: Paco Jarana\n\nCante: Enrique El Extremeño, Jose Valencia, Jeromo Segura\n\nPercussion: Antonio Coronel, Raul Dominguez\n\nVoiceover: Juan Diego\n\nContributing choreographers: Mercedes de Cordoba, Fernando Jimenez\n\nThis was the closing Villamarta show of the festival and it was packed. The program notes said that Eva Yerbabuena would introduce us to the world of Lorca, from his infancy, and to some of the people who inhabited his world during that epoch, such as Dali and Bunuel and who left their mark on the writer. It was a collage of some of his works. Since I had not studied them and only knew of Lorca from wikipedia I was well out of my depth. There were 11 pieces referenced to a poem or play or episode in Lorca’s life.\n\nThe staging used a large segmented stone wall with metal grips. Otherwise the stage was bare. The opening segment had the male dancers wearing a kind of modified toga and the women a brown dress and it seemed to be a quasireligious piece of contemorary dance. Eva was positioned by the edge of the wall but not watching. Eva then danced a sombre solo in black that looked tortured. There was one cheerful, peasant/gitano group piece and then a piece for two men. One naked apart from flesh coloured underwear and the other clothed. The clothed man daubed the naked one with bright blue paint (Dali and their love affair?). Then we were back in Lorca’s dark place with a young couple who fall in lust. When the man leaves the girl’s mother and sisters all dressed in black castigate her and the mother throws several buckets of water on her. Eva did another solo and then they were joined on stage by a giant puppet of Lorca. For the final ensemble the corps dressed in red toga type outfits again and they really just walked on and off stage.\n\nThe audience gave the show a standing ovation but I wonder how many really understood what was going on? I have since read much more of Lorca and about Lorca and I wonder whether he has become a kind of Andalucian martyr because of his unsolved murder in mid-life. I give him the benefit of the doubt since I can’t claim to really understand his writing in Spanish and I am sure the translations leave a lot to be desired.\n\n—————–\n\nSaturday 9 March, 2013 6pm Damajuana Cafe/Restaurant, Jerez de la Frontera\n\nFree performance\n\nThey did not announce the names of the performers and I had never seen any of them before. The singers were two young gitano women still in their teens accompanied with buitar and cajon. They sang mainly bulerias and danced a few pataitas. They were very refreshing and supported by a lot of family in the audience, especially children.\n\n——————-\n\nSaturday 9 March, 2013 2:30pm Bar Pasaje Tabanco, Jerez de la Frontera\n\nFree performance as part of the Festival de Jerez\n\nLydia Hernandez was the singer but I don’t know the guitarist’s name. She is young with a sweet voice and great presence. It was a really rumbunctious crowd of drinkers, many of them contributing loud palmas.\n\n——————–\n\nFriday 8 March, 2013 Midnight, Sala Compañia, Festival De Jerez, Jerez de la Frontera\n\n20 euro\n\n‘Solo Flamenco’\n\nCante: Jose Valencia\n\nInvited dance artist: Joaquin Grilo\n\nGuitar: Juan Requena\n\nPalmas: Juan Diego Valencia, Manuel Valencia\n\nI could tell Jose really enjoyed having his own show. He put in 110 per cent. The venue suited his big operatic voice. I was in the second row and it was a little too amplified for comfort some of the time. Joaquin came on after three songs and was greeted noisily by the audience. In all he danced three pieces with one costume change. The first was very choreographed but his bulerias were the typical crazy Joaquin schtick with all sorts and strange contratiempo and broken movements. At one point later in the night he indicated to Jose that his fly was undone which indeed it was! They had a ball working together and Jose loved his multiple curtain calls.\n\n——————–\n\nFriday 8 March, 2013 7pm, Sala Paul, Festival de Jerez, Jerez de la Frontera\n\n20 euro general seating\n\nGuitar: Javier Patino\n\nInvited dance artist: Angel Muñoz\n\nViolin: Alexis Lefevre\n\nBass guitar: Jose Manuel Posado ‘Popo’\n\nThere was a full theatre for this show. I went early and scored a front row seat. Javier Patino has a very calm, relaxed manner and he got on the right side of all the women in the audience when he dedicated the evening to women since it was International Women’s Day. He started solo then brought in the French violinist and bass player. They created a mind of jazz fusion woven around the guitar that was amazing. At times the violin sounded like a flute. Angel danced a piece but I don’t know the palo, maybe Martinete? It was lyrical and strong with a lot of turns that were then stopped and held and he finished in releve with one leg lifted. Quite amazing control. After another song he then joined the musicians and played cajon like a professional. They all seemed to enjoy playing together and the non-verbal communication was great. Angel danced another piece just to palmas by Javier which really showcased his footwork. Altogether a brilliant program.\n\n…………….\n\nWednesday 6 March, 2013 10pm Peña Torres Macarena, Seville\n\n6 euro entry, cheap food and drinks\n\nCante: Florencio Gerena\n\nGuitar: Diego Reyes\n\nDance: Emilio El Duende\n\nThis program was publicised as a night of ‘Los Jovenes’, the ‘Young Ones’ and the three main artists were in their twenties, or possibly early thirties in the case of the dancer. I was especially taken by Florencio who seems a very serious, sincere person and an accomplished singer. He dedicated his Solea to his father and brother. Emilio danced twice, a Solea por Bulerias and a Solea plus the fin de fiesta bulerias with a cast of ring ins. He has awesome soniquete and is very powerful. I was sitting right at his feet by the stage so I could see every detail. I just wish there was more light and shade in his interpretation, it is all full on. A young dancer ripped out an amazing, jumping bulerias which I caught a few seconds of on video.\n\n……………..\n\nTuesday 5 March 2013, 7pm Museo del Baile Flamenco, Seville\n\n20 euro general seating, cash bar\n\nCante: Chieto\n\nGuitar: Miguel Perez\n\nDance: Rosa Belmonte, Sergio Gonzalez\n\nThis was pretty much the same performance I saw last time I watched Chieto and Rosa perform at the Museo but as it is such good quality I was happy with Rosa’s Alegrias con bata de cola and Sergio’s solea por buleria was astonishing for his footwork.\n\n………..\n\nMonday 4 March 2013, 10:30pm La Caja Negra, Seville\n\nCante: Rocio Lopez\n\nGuitar: Gori Mazo\n\nDance: Carolina Pastor, Amada Escudero\n\n6 euro entry cash bar, no food\n\nThe advertised start time was 9:30pm so I was not entirely happy to wait an hour for the performance to start. Still it was worth the wait. The cantaor was lovely and after the instrumental start we were treated to a very energetic Solea por Buleria by both dancers. Usually I am not keen on synchronised flamenco and it was the same choreography but the women put their own personal spin on it and it was impressive. They were well matched. I did not stay for the break and part two. I was able to compliment Amada in class next day as she takes all three morning classes with Andres.\n\n——————————–\n\nSaturday March 2, 2013, Midnight, Festival de Jerez, Sala Compañia, Jerez de la Fontera\n\n25 euro general seating\n\nMacarena Ramirez ‘Recuerdos’ (Recollections)\n\nDance and choreography: Macarena Ramirez\n\nInvited artist – pianist: Jose Zarzana\n\nCante: David Carpio, May Fernandez\n\nGuitar: Pascual de Lorca, Juan Jose Alba\n\nViolin: Emilio Martin\n\nMusical Director: Juan Jose Alba\n\nMy Italian friend Vanessa who watched the show with me reminded me that we had seen Macarena dance a Seguiriyas with a black Bata de Cola in the Festival as an invited artist in the last ‘Viva Jerez’ production. I was impressed that Macarena has since worked up this show by herself. The theme was of an elderly woman recalling her youth and how she danced freely, not tied down by domestic duties. A simple theme well executed, especially in the opening scene when the older woman, the singer May Fernandez, sings looking at her reflection in the mirror and what she sees is her younger self. They swap places and Macarena continues to dance. She really is the quintessential flamenca, slim, strong and elegant with a face that looks good from every angle. She gave a faultless performance well suported by the musicians. She reminds me of a younger Rocio Molina without the edge and I look forward to seeing how she develops. Special mention for David Carpio who was singing in his second show of the night. He is such a professional.\n\n………\n\nSaturday March 2, 2013, 9pm, Festival De Jerez, Teatro Villamarta, Jerez de la Frontera\n\n29 euro stall seat front row\n\nMaria Del Mar Moreno Company ‘De Cal Vida’\n\nDance: Maria Del Mar Moreno\n\nInvited Singer: Tomasa Guerrero ‘La Macanita’\n\nCante: Antonio de la Malena, El Tolo, Jose de los Camarones, David Carpio\n\nPalmas, Percussion: Luis de la Tota, Ale de Gitaneria\n\nActress : Maria Duarte\n\nActor: Nicolas Montoya\n\nPiano: Johanna Raymont\n\nThis was an ambitious undertaking by Maria Del Mar Moreno which she mostly pulled off. The first half depicted the struggle of women to transcend their oppression by fate and men. She literally danced out of bondage. The spoken words by Maria Duarte and La Macanita’s singing went straight to the heart. So powerful.\n\nI particularly liked the segment when three of the singers sat in a semicircle and ayed guitar to accompany themselves and then passed the guitar to the next person. Could have done without El Tolo coughing back stage miked up for his entrance.\n\nWithout a break we went into the second part with a male choir singing excerpts from Bizet’s ‘Carmen’ while an actor dressed a manequin frame with an officer’s jacket. We were deep into the troubled life of the fictional Carmen. Again I have difficulties with adaptations of classical music for flamenco, especially by a French composer. One of the strongest messages she gave in her performance was that you can be a rather large woman and still burn up the floor with a main stage flamenco performance.\n\n…………..\n\nSaturday 2 March, 2013, 7pm Festival De Jerez, Sala Paul, Jerez de la Frontera\n\n20 euro general seating, cash bar outside\n\nSantiago Lara presented ‘Movimientos Nuevos’ (New Movement)\n\nGuitar: Santiago Lara and Paco Lara\n\nInvited artists cantaors: Jesus Mendez, David Lagos\n\nPercussion: Perico Navarro\n\nPalmas: Javier Peña, Rafael Ramos\n\nGuitar afficionados would know Santiago Lara as a ridiculously brilliant guitarist which of course he is. Live he also shows how he achieved close to perfection in his recordings as he spent a long time between songs tuning his guitar, sometimes long minutes. Still it was worth it as his program was impeccable. Starting with his solo then bringing in percussion and palmas he then introduced first David Lagos and later Jesus Mendez. Their contrasting voices made for a rich range of songs and by the bulerias I would have sat and listened to them all night.\n\n…………………\n\nFriday 1 March 2013, 9pm Festival de Jerez, Teatro Villamarta, Jerez de la Frontera\n\n32 euro stall seating\n\nRafael Estevez/Valeriano Paños and Company: ‘La Consagracion’ (The Consecration)\n\nInvited artist: Antonio Canales\n\nSpecial Dance Collaboration: Antonio Ruz\n\nPrincipal Dancer: Rosana Romero\n\nDancers: Sara Jimenez, Macarena Lopez, Carmen Manzanera, Veronica Llavero, Ana Latorre, Andoitz Rubal, Daniel Morillo, Jesus Perona, Manuel Ramirez\n\nCante: Rafael Jimenez ‘Falo’, Sandra Carrasco, David ‘El Galli’, Israel Fernandez\n\nThe first half of 45 minutes called, ‘Tierra’ (Earth) was inspired by a novel written by Mario Fuentes. I don’t know the title but the theme was clearly the lives of the working class field labourers, their hardships and joy and their exploitation by faceless, powerful men. I guess there is a contemporary message there. The performance had three movements in this section, all traditional flamenco. The stand out voice was Sandra Carrasco.\n\nThe venerable Antonio Canales came on for a flamenco puro cameo which he mostly danced as a male pas de deux which would have been fine except whoever decided on his costume made a terrible error of judgement. His pants were far too short and too low on the hips so that his loose white shirt didn’t cover his pot belly when he raised his arms.\n\nThe company was strong and I enjoyed all this section.\n\nAfter a twenty minute break the second part was their interpretation of the ‘Rite of Spring’ Igor Stravinsky. They used recorded music. Sadly it didn’t work for me. It was repetitious and trite. I wish they would leave dance classics alone. At the end all the dancers bar one succumbed to a violent death at the hands of the faceless men and we were left with one hopeful image of the last free man.\n\n………………..\n\nFriday 1 March 2013 7pm, Festival de Jerez, Sala Paul, Jerez de la Fontera\n\n20 euro general seating, cash bar outside\n\nCantaor: Ezequiel Benitez\n\nGuitarists: Javier Ibanez and Paquito Castro\n\nPercussion: Carlos Merino\n\nPalmas: Manuel de la Momi, Din de Jerez and Manolete de la Mini\n\nWhat a wonderful start to my Festival shows with the sublime Ezequiel Benitez singing. He is an angel trapped in a fat man’s body. His tone is so mellow and the emotion natural and restrained. He had a family member on stage to singvwith him, sorry did not get the name, and I was not keen on his exaggerated style.\n\n……………….\n\nFriday 1 March 2013 7pm, Festival de Jerez, Sala Paul, Jerez de la Fontera\n\n20 euro general entry, cash bar outside\n\nCantaor: Ezequiel Benitez\n\nGuitarists: Javier Ibanez and Paquito Castro\n\nPercussion: Carlos Merino\n\nPalmas: Manuel de la Momi, Din de Jerez and Manolete de la Mini\n\nWhat a wonderful start to my Festival shows with the sublime Ezequiel Benitez singing.

Assigned seat.\n\n‘La Pepa’\n\nBallet Flamenco Sara Baras\n\nDirection and Choreography: Sara Baras\n\nMusic: Keko Baldomero\n\nInvited Artist: Jose Serrano\n\nSingers: Saul Quiros, Emilio Florido, and Miguel Rosendo\n\nGuitarists: Keko Baldomero and Miguel Iglesias\n\nPercussion: Antonio Suarez and Manuel Muñoz ‘Pajaro’\n\nPlus 14 dancers of the Sara Baras Ballet\n\nThe Maestranza is the main music theatre in Seville and this show would fill it three nights running such is the reputation of Sara Baras. ‘La Pepa’ was a production on a grand scale honouring the 200th anniversary of the Spanish Constitution crafted in Cadiz.\n\nMy seat was in the centre of the upper circle so I had a helicopter view of the large stage. Without opera glasses I missed the facial expressions and nuances of the performances.\n\nThe show was in 11 parts so it was almost two hours long.\n\n1. The war of independence – Martinete\n\n2. Peace, Life, Hope, Serenity – Waltz\n\n3. The Gate of Cadiz – Guajira, zapateado, fandango, seguirilla\n\n4. Musical Transition\n\n5. The Consitutional Assembly 1810-1812 – Solea por Buleria\n\n6. Mission of the deputies to Cadiz – Malagueña\n\n7. Gypsy Village – Tanguillo\n\n8. The Promulgation of the Constitution – Farruca\n\n9. Musical Transition\n\n10. La Pepa 2012 – The monument de ‘La Pepa’ in Cadiz – Alegria\n\n11. Fin de Fiesta – Buleria\n\nSara Baras is indisputably technically brillant and beautiful dancer to watch as she is slender, shapely and has divine arms and metronomic precision in her footwork. The show was very ambitious but she achieved her vision with gorgeous costuming and music. The only reservations I have were that there was a bit too much gratuitous footwork in places, especially her solos and I did not enjoy Jose Serrano as I had hoped. He dances with a very stiff in the upper body and his left ankle seems rolled out (even from my seat I could see that). The corps were very good and I was pleased to see the Gaditano, Daniel Saltares with the men. The percussion second musical nterlude was much too long for my taste.\n\n……………………………………………………………………….\n\nCaja Negra, Sevilla, 12 September, 2012, 11pm\n\nFive euro entry. General seating.\n\nDancers: Kuky Santiago and Jessi ‘La Kica’\n\nSinger: Manuel Romero\n\nGuitarist: Idan Balas\n\nIn just 12 months I’ve seen Kuky and Jessica develop from competent, promising dancers to polished, exciting performers. This is what hard work and talent can do. Jessica danced with great control and nuance but Kuky really blew the crowd away. Unfortunately this was the same night as the huge Camaron homaje at FIBES so the audience was smaller than it should have been. Manuel has a warm, big voice and Idan’s solo was delightful.\n\n……………………………………………………………………..\n\nT de Triana, Sevilla, 11 September, 2012, 11pm\n\nFree entry\n\nDancers: Florencia Zuniga ‘Flori’ and ‘La Armenia’\n\nGuitarist: Fyty\n\nSinger: Cristina Soler\n\n‘La Armenia’ was beautifully dressed and groomed and danced first. She used the space well and improved as she progressed to the footwork section. In contrast Florencia had obviously dressed in a hurry as she had a button missing from her vest and zero makeup. Her Solea por Buleria more than made up for it and the crowd loved her. Cristina is a young, appealing singer and Fyty is always wonderful.\n\n……………………………………………………………………..\n\nAnother great ‘T’ show.\n\n………………………………………………….\n\nCasa de la Memoria, Sevilla, 11 September, 2102, 9pm\n\n13 euro entry with student disount.

Recycling materials and artforms. The interviews prior to the festival focussed on the recycled materials used for Ana’s costumes. A worthy aim but dance is my primary focus and I was disappointed by three out of the four pieces she presented. In addition the bata de cola dress for the first piece added nothing to her dance. It was unflattering.\n\nThe stage was set up in a different outdoor area from the Israel Galvan and they had an open air bar! Nice touch.\n\nOnly Ana’s Rondeña had life for me, the other three dances left me cold and in the case of the Seguiryas which she danced to recorded music a trifle irritated. She is an accomplished dancer but unfortunately there are so many brilliant and captivating dancers that being accomplished does not cut it. She was supported by such talented musicians and singers I wish she had used them more. I don’t think from the body language and the forced jaleos from the audience that I was alone in my response.\n\nThe art created by filming watercolours dropped and drawn from a syringe and projected onto the backdrop was interesting.\n\nThe whole show made me wonder if her selection for the festival program was based more on the worthy theme than on merit.\n\n…………………………………………………………………\n\nMonasterio de la Cartuja, Seville, 9 September, 2012, 11pm\n\nLa Bienal program – General seating\n\n‘Solo’\n\nDance and artistic direction by Israel Galvan\n\nWhen I read that Israel Galvan’ show was called ‘Solo’ I assumed it meant it would be just him performing to music. I’ve seen his idiosyncratic shows live before and always come away amazed and entertained. I realised however when I saw the program that we were in for something unique. The outdoor stage with bench seating on three sides was set before the tall twin ceramic ovens of the old ceramic factory in the grounds of the monastery. The show would be performed totally without accompaniment of any kind.\n\nI also understood as Israel walked slowly, and purposefully, dressed completely in skin tight black clothes and boots, towards the stage why he did not call it ‘El Silencio’. It is impossible to dance in complete silence unless you’re in a vacuumn or outer space… A hooting owl in a nearby tree, wind on the speakers that amplifed the sound of his flamenco boots on the stage, the cough of an audience member (me, but more on that later…).\n\nI was front row and for forty minutes I could not take my eyes off him as he put his body through a thousand precise movements (never repeated more than once) accentuated by percussion on all parts of his body including his teeth! I counted four different palos, there may have been more, and with each his style would change so we could recognise gitano tangos hips, the bull fighter stances in a Farruca and many more.\n\nWith the continued effort, like an elite tennis player (well, most Russian women)! he would make small grunting sounds – in compas. There were small snatches of phrases but I could not understand what he said. He never once lost concentration or control.\n\nWhat was clear to me and every other member of the audience was that this man is above and beyond flamenco. Example: I’ve never seen a moving double turn on the very tip of boots, have you? Not even Michael Jackson or Baryshnikov in their prime could touch him!\n\nMy only anxious moment came thirty minutes in when the tickle in my throat turned into a powerful urge to cough. I am recovering from a head cold. Try as I might I had to give in but managed to time the cough for a loud section of choreography. I fear it will still be audible in the soundtrack…\n\nThe audience rewarded his unique and awe inspiring effort with a sustained standing ovation. We were still standing and clapping loudly when he humbly bowed, stepped backwards off stage and walked slowly back down the path.\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nPlaza de Toros, Jerez de la Frontera, 8 September, 2012, 10pm\n\n20 euros general seating in the bull ring\n\nFiesta de la Buleria\n\nDedicated to Juan de la Plata\n\nPart One\n\nCuadro Flamenco ‘Jerez Por Bulerias’\n\nSingers: Lorenzo Galvez ‘Ripoll’, Jose de Joaquina, Luis de Pacote, Mara Rey, Jose Mendez, Luis Moneo, Tamara de Tane, Juanillorro\n\nGuitarists: Ismael Heredia and Isaac Moreno\n\nI think on large public occasions such as this when big stars are on stage together they dig a bit deeper to impress their compañeros. I am sure that is what happened last night. Everyone was on form but Mara Rey is a particular favourite of mine as she gives 110% and also dances well. Jose de Joaquina was polished and also danced which earns him extra points!\n\nJesus Mendez then sang accompanied by Manuel Valencia. He performed mostly seated but towards the end he stood, walked away from the microphone and sang tothe audience from the edge of the stage. It was worth gettng there early to have a seat close enough to hear him. Lovely!\n\nJuan Moneo ‘El Torta’ was the last act of the first part. This was the first time I’ve seen him perform. I don’t know whether he’d had one too many sherries before the show or something else but he started off very raggedly and was making lots of wise cracks (most went over my head). Then he settled down and we saw why he has such a big reputation, he is expressive and powerfully emotional in Bulerias mode.\n\nPart Two\n\nMercedes Ruiz (unusually) first danced a sharp, powerful Farruca with bata de cola with castañuelas accompanied by David Lagos and David Carpio. She changed dresses and returned to dance a long, no holes barred Bulerias. I was wonderful to see her take risks.\n\nTomasa Guerrero ‘La Macanito’ was the next act. Her voice in Bulerias is so powerful it could peel paint off walls. I enjoyed her very much but it was a bit too much of the same for the first section until she started to vary the letres and danced. Towards the end she sang other palos, frequently leaving the microphone to sing. Her tears seemed real and the audience loved her.\n\nI left at 2:30am, before the last act, Miguel Flores ‘Capullo de Jerez’. My head cold defeated me.\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………….\n\nReal Alcazar, Seville, 4 September, 2012, 10pm\n\nLa Bienal Program – General seating\n\n‘Las Huellas’\n\nThe Company of La Farruca and the Kathak Company of Anuj Arjun Mishra\n\nThe famous matriarch of the Farruca family, Rosario Montoya, took the bold step of sharing the stage with the exceptionally talented Indian Kathak dancer Anuj Mishra. Supporting her was her youngest son, the ‘Young Michael Jackson of Flamenco’, El Carpeta.\n\nWith two wonderful Flamenco singers, Pedro Heredia ‘El Granaina’ and Mara Rey and guitarist Juan Requena, we enjoyed a Tangos, Alegria and Solea as well as a long Kathak program. Sadly, there seemed to be some competition but no real fusion of the two styles. El Carpeta was exciting and has grown as a dancer since I saw him last.\n\nReal Alcazar, Seville, 3 September, 2012 10pm General seating\n\n‘Las Idas y Vueltas: Musicas Mestizas’\n\nFlamenco Singer: Arcangel\n\nViola: Fahmi Alqhai\n\nFlamenco Guitar: Miguel Angel Cortes\n\nFlamenco Percussion: Agustin Diassera\n\nAcademia Del Piacere\n\nSoprano: Marivi Blasco\n\nViolone: Juan Ramone Lara\n\nPercussion: Pedro Estevan\n\nFlautas de Pico: Vicente Parrilla\n\nViola de Gamba: Johanna Rose\n\nDancer: Patricia Guerrero\n\nIt’s a very special treat to see any evening performance in the courtyard of the royal alcazar but this production was even more unforgettable with the bell-like voice of Arcangel projecting from the upper balcony for his first piece. The music was a blend of Hispanic Baroque and Flamenco. Most of it worked well. Patricia Guerrera performed three dances with Arcangel and was beautifully costumed.\n\nThe program: Alegrias de Cadiz, Marionas & Canarios, Xacaras & Bulerias, Guaracha & Guajira\n\nT de Triana, Calle Betis, Seville, 3 May, 2012 11pm\n\nFree entry\n\nSinger: Cristina Soler Gago\n\nGuitarist: Idan Balas\n\nDancer: Alberto Selles\n\nI was too late for the first part with the female dancer but saw all of the second part which consisted of Alberto’s Alegrias, which was at least as good as the evening I saw him perform last year in the same venue on September 29, and a blistering hot fin de fiesta with lots of amazing flamencas like Ana Pruneda and Adi Movdat.

And whilst most of his playing was marvellous it did sound to me (and please bear in mind I am not a guitar afficianado) like he was struggling to keep in compas. Laura Vital has a rich voice and a very animated style. A pleasure to listen to. Her microphone was not set right though. I love that she looks at the audience much of the time rather than close her eyes like so many do. I am sure Jose de la Tomas is revered but he did not move me at all tonight. I found the emotion manufactured. Yolanda Lorenzo did a fairly basic Alegrias. Perhaps I have just seen too many. Was nice to see Vicente Gelo singing again.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nLa Caja Negra, Calle Fresa, 15, Seville, 1 May 2012 10pm\n\n5 euro entry. Some seating but most people stand. Bar service.\n\nSinger: Nane Ramos\n\nGuitarist: Afra Rubino\n\nBaile: Rita ‘La Zafra’\n\nCajon: ‘El Fumi’\n\nThis was my first visit to this venue and I was pleased with the ambience and the quality of the sound and performance. It attracts a fairly young, flamenca crowd and I imagine has launched many a career. Nane is clearly a seasoned performer and I love her no frills approach and caramel voice. Rita was quite nervous in her Solea causing her to smile inappropriately. She was much more relaxed in the Alegrias. Afra seemed to do a fine job and El Fumi on cajon and compas gave solid compas.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nMuseo del Baile Flamenco, Seville, 29 April 2012 8:30pm\n\n20 euro. General seating.\n\nSinger: Rafael de Utrera\n\nGuitarist: Miguel Perez\n\nDancers: Carmen Lozano and Lebri\n\nI never miss an opportunity to hear Miguel Perez play live. He is a hero of mine for the love and dedication he puts into his art and his support of emerging dancers. Rafael De Utrera captured my heart in Jerez when he sang with Gerardo Nuñez. He is the real deal. No front, no tricks, just a pure voice and raw emotion – happy and sad. I wish he would hurry up and release his solo album.\n\nCarmen danced an Alegria con bata de cola. This was her second performace in as many hours so I understand she may have been a little tired. Lebri was all personality in his Solea por Bulerias and has some wicked bulerias remate. Great night! The advantage of the second show is that you may get another Bulerias encore if you clap loudly enough! Evening only spoiled slightly by some Italian women with a lot of attitude trying to hog the front row.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nMuseo del Baile Flamenco, Seville, 28 April 2012 7pm\n\n20 euro. General seating\n\nSinger: Jorge Canestero\n\nGuitarist: Luis Amador\n\nDancers: Laura Santamaria and Felipe Mato\n\nMy seat was a few rows back so I didn’t see a whole lot of the footwork. It rained very heavily one third of the way into the show which, with the glass roof located over the stage, was a bit distracting.\n\nI came to this show principally to see Felipe as I loved his show at Casa dl Memoria. Oddly the things I enjoyed the most on this occasion were the slow, sensuous Sevillanas he and Laura danced to start the show and the guitar solo by Luis. Luis plays like breathing and with a subtlety even I can appreciate.\n\nLaura wrangled her bata de cola effectively in her Alegrias but she does not have ‘it’ for me. Felipe’s Solea por Bulerias was great with lots of precise fast footwork. Jorge did a Tangos for his solo. This is probably the third time I have heard him sing solo and he has yet to move me although he supports the dancers well.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nTablao Los Gallos, Plaza Santa Cruz, 11, Sevilla 29 April 2012 8pm\n\n30 euro for a two hour show with no interval and one drink.\n\nIt’s general seating. Get there 40 minutes before the show time to get a decent seat. I was front row with four rowdy Italian flamenkitas. This tablao has been running 45 years. All dancers are experienced professionals who dance two shows a night up to seven days a week so they might be excused for the ocasional glazed expression. This was the program I saw. I had to hang around and bother the hard working manager/waitress to get the details so my spelling may be a bit off. They should announce the artists properly.\n\nHappily there is no photography allowed during the show but it’s ok during the fin de fiesta.\n\nSingers were Paco del Viso (see 29/4 blog photo taken after show), Emilio Cabello and Kiko de Alcala. All very different voices and two were great show men.\n\nGuitarists were Paco Pastor and Juan Carlos Berlanga\n\n1. Begoñia Arce: Tangos de Malaga.\n\nVery polished and fast but no feeling.\n\n2. Saraya Garcia: Alegria con bata de cola\n\nFantastic footwork but she isn’t the right shape for this style. Her Buleria is hot and I would love to see her do Guajira or Colombiana.\n\n3. Tamara Tane sang Bulerias and was marvellous. Great use of light and shade.\n\n4. Guitar solo by Paco Pastor was solid but not special for me.\n\n5. Anam Morales: Seguirya\n\nThis was the strongest female dance I thought. She is a joy to watch but she did not seem to connect with the singers – she never looked at them.\n\n6. Hugo Sanchez: Bulerias\n\nThis guy reminded my of the way Baryshnikov danced at the same age, that risky macho athleticism – daring to turn faster and more times than anyone else. His crazy gitano Lerias moves have to be seen to be believed.\n\n7. Maria Angeles Gabaldon: Guijira with Abañico (fan)\n\nVery graceful and dextrous performer and she seemed to be having fun.\n\n8. Sevillanas and bulerias por fin de fiesta : great entertainment\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nCasa de la Memoria, Calle Ximenez de Enciso, 28, Sevilla 26 April 2012 9pm\n\n15 euro entry general seating\n\n‘La Seguirya’\n\nSinger: Vicente Gelo\n\nGuitarist: Tino\n\nDancers: Marta Arias and Juan Carlos Cardoso\n\nThis was a different kind of show as Juan Carlos did his Seguirya after the cantaor warmed up with Bulerias and for the second dance part, a Farruca, Marta did a small section solo then a partner section with Juan Carlos and he finished with a another solo. Juan Carlos is a fast and furious dancer. Quite astonishing. I don’t think I have seen many men quicker in their turns or more precise in their footwork (maybe Rafael Campallo?). I was disappointed though not to see more of Marta.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nT de Triana (bar-restaurant), Calle Betis, Sevilla 25 April 2012 11pm\n\nFree\n\nSinger: ‘El Trini’\n\nGuitarist: Fyty\n\nDancers: Francesca Grima ‘La Chica’ and Ana Pruneda\n\nThis was the third show of the night but my favourite as these two Flamencas danced their hearts out. As I’ve commented previously, El Trini is one of the hardest working cantaors in Seville and Fyty always supports the dancers 100% so we, the audience, could just relax and enjoy. Ana’s Farruca was fabulous and La Chica managed to pack so much emotion into her performance I just wish I could have seen them dance in a slightly bigger space. The Sevillanas they finished with was a great tribute to this beautiful city.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nCasa de la Memoria, Calle Ximenez de Enciso, 28, Sevilla 25 April 2012 9pm\n\n15 euro entry general seating\n\n‘El Tronio’ (I think it refers to the Flamenco bar of the same name in Triana)\n\nSinger: Vincente Gelo\n\nGuitarist: Raul Cantizano\n\nDancers: Almudena Serrano and Antonio Molina ‘Chorro’\n\nVicente has a lighter and higher voice than many male Flamenco singers but he has an effortless, natural style I loved. Nothing was forced and he can run the notes beautifully. Both Almudina and Antonio are wonderfully accomplished performers who just burned the floor with their zapateados. Almudena started strong and then sexy and Antonio is the kind of understated dancer who builds the anticipation and throws in lots of surprises – a bit like Joaquin Grilo.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nMuseo del Baile Flamenco, Calle Manuel Rojas Marcos, 3, Sevilla 25 April 2012 7pm\n\n20 euro entry general seating\n\nSinger: Chieto\n\nGuitarist: Juanma Torres\n\nDancers: Rosa Belmonte and Oscar de los Reyes\n\nThis a good quality venue but the performances can be uneven. I was most impressed by Chieto. With or without a microphone he can generate such amazing amounts of power and emotion that I embarrased myself crying during the Seguirya. Not a common thing for me. Rosa is so tall and commanding that her style, along with her cheeky enjoyment of her Alegrias con bata de cola, won the audience over. The guitarist was lovely but I don’t have sufficient knowledge to critique his playing. The male dancer has a very beautiful face and wore bright red patent leather shoes, both I found very distracting from the dance. I felt that he didn’t really own his Solea, it was rather skittish. He showed later that he is strong in footwork and wowed the audience but I left unsatisfied.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nLa Casa De La Memoria, Calle Ximenez de Enciso, 28, Sevilla 24 April 2012 9pm\n\n15 euro entry general seating\n\n‘Jondo’ (Deep)\n\nSinger: Jeromo Segura\n\nGuitarist: Tino\n\nDancer: Maribel Ramos ‘Zambra’\n\nMy hotel, Alcantara, forms part of the same building complex as the performance venue so it couldn’t be any closer! From many previous attendances I’ve learned I don’t have to queue as I can sit on the third step and just stand for the dance parts and get a great view. Last night I shared the steps with some very excited children and enjoyed explaining to them what the format would be.\n\nIt’s been more than a month since I have seen any live Flamenco and it was gratifying to get the same buzz from these wonderful performers. Flamenco is a drug I don’t seem to develop a tolerance for.\n\nI’ve enjoyed Jeromo’s singing many times in the past and his opening Alegria was sensitively sung but I do wish he would open his eyes sometimes. Both Tino and La Zambra were new to me. Tino is very good but I did not feel anything but pleasantly entertained during his solo piece.\n\nMaribel is what I call a ‘complete’ dancer. She is slim and medium height so she has lovely lines and chooses flattering costumes plus she can project strong emotions with her face and arms. This she did powerfully in the Caña and then for her Solea por Buleria she was more grounded and earthy with the ‘fat mama’ moves I Iove. Her footwork is sharp and hard – no shortcuts there. A very satisfying first night back at Casa dl Memoria!\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nFor Flamenco World’s photos, videos and reviews of the 2012 Festival de Jerez go here:\n\nhttp://www.flamenco-world.com/magazine/about/jerez2012/resenas/resenas.html?PHPSESSID=16dea2a803f98cebf792926df0f9211c\n\nTeatro Villamarta, Festival De Jerez, Jerez De La Frontera, 9pm 10 March 2012\n\nStall ticket in included in Festival registration\n\n‘La Mar De Flamenco’ (The Sea of Flamenco) by the Joaquin Grilo Company\n\nProgram:\n\nMareas Que Traen Silencio- Alegrias\n\nEcos Morunas- Zambra\n\nEl Pajaro- Abandolaos and Malagueña\n\nAprendiendo a Volar- Farruca\n\nCafe Cantante- Solea apola\n\nBanderillas En El Alma – Bulerias\n\nLa Ida Y La Vuelta – Rumba and Colombiana\n\nPunto de la Habana- Cantes de ida y vuelta\n\nDel Marao Al Cielo- Buleria\n\nDance: Joaquin Grilo and Javier Perez\n\nGuitar: Juan Requena\n\nSong: Jose Valencia and Carmen Grilo\n\nTurkish woodwind and Turkish Mandolin: Bilgin Canaz\n\nHarmonica and Accordion: Antonio Serrano\n\nAs this was the closing show of the Festival and a world premiere there were high expectations placed on local hero Joaquin Grilo. His previous Villamarta show, ‘Leyenda Personal’ (Personal Legend/Fable) had been a hit and he was expected to do even better with this one. In the preview interview with the local newspaper Grilo said he got the inspiration for the show while fishing with a flamenco friend and had wanted to collaborate with Ruben Olmo but he couldn’t because of Olmo’s commitments as the new director of the Ballet Flamenco De Andalucia. This to me could explain why there was no real coherence to the overall show even though ‘sea’ was the theme.\n\nI enjoyed the opening two solos. Dressed in a black jacket with manton fringing and slim fitting white stretch shirt and pants he warmed up with two sharp routines. Javier Perez did a very donvincing and athletic ‘naked bird’ solo dressed only in skin coloured tights with huge feathed hands. Grilo then danced a pas de deux with ‘the naked bird’. He’d removed his jacket so you could see every detail of their steps. They mirrored movements in silence and it was engaging but too long. When the ‘the bird’ came on later for a third appearance there was a palpable sigh in the audience.\n\nThe rest of Grilo’s pieces were enjoyable, especially the songs set in Havana where he donned a white jacket and white Panama, but he did seem to save his best stuff for the final tribute to the late, great Moraito who was pictured living in the stars with a projection of stars that briefly became a constellation of Moraito’s familiar outline. For that section Grilo appeared at the back of the stalls in spotlight and walked down the aisle to the stage, as if ascending to the sky.\n\nThe singers were beautiful and I especially loved Jose Valencia’s powerful, compelling voice.\n\nThe standing ovation the company received was easily the longest of the festival and this was the longest show. Grilo was stronger, faster and funkier than ever for me and his sharp white outfit was the icing on the cake. He is still my flamenco Elvis!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nTeatro Villamarta, Festival De Jerez, Jerez De La Frontera, 9pm 9 March 2012\n\nStall ticket included in Festival Registration\n\n‘Utopia’ by The Maria Pages Company\n\nProgram: Eight passages\n\nUtopia, Dialogue, Broken Time, Conscience and Desire, Going Together, Red Road, Where we want to live, Altitude\n\nDance: Maria Pages, Isabel Rodriguez, Eva Varela, Maria Vega, Jose Antonio Jurado, Paco Berbel, Ruben Puertas\n\nSong: Ana Ramon, Juan De Mairena\n\nGuitar: Ruben Lebaniegos, Jose ‘Fyty’ Carillo\n\nVoice, guitar: Fred Martins\n\nCello: Sergio Menem\n\nPercussion: Chema Uriarte\n\nConcept, artistic diection and choreography by Maria Pages except the Farruca which was choreographed by Jose Barrios.\n\nLyrics by Charles Baudelaire, Mario Benedetti, Miguel De Cervantes, Antonio Machado, Larbi El Harti, Pablo Neruda, Oscar Niemayer.\n\nMusic and arrangements by Ruben Lebaniegos, Fred Martins, Isaac Muñoz, Jose ‘Fyty’ Carillo.\n\nThis show was mounted in collaboration with the Niemayer Centre.\n\nWhen I hear of the Brasilian architect Nieymayer I immediately think of Brasilia – that bureaucratic graveyard of cancerous concrete structures in a flat greenness hewn from the Brasilian jungle rather than a Utopia – but it was refreshing to hear the gentle cadences of Brazilian rythms and lyrics for the opening and closing parts of this show. As a company performances this was the most ambitious and successful of the Festival for me. Pages wove her solos into the ensemble pieces, appearing in silhouette.\n\nHer young company dancers are extremely competent, especially the men. The costumes, as you would expect from Pages, were interesting and quite different. The grey of the opening set created interesting patterns with the lighting and the later layered clinging red and green the company wore were lovely. For the her farruca she wore only black leggings and a black top so you could see every movement which makes it much more engaging. The most striking costume was Pages red dress she wore for her barefoot solo with expansive layers of skirt she used to create whirls of red as she twirled it around and over her head and body.\n\nThe only thing that was not entirely enjoyable was her final solo dance which was with bata de cola. She seemed to struggle at some points which was a shame as she had been so strong up until then.\n\nThe singers were wonderful, especially Ana Ramon. She deserved her standing ovation.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nSala Compañia, Festival De Jerez, Jerez De La Frontera, 9pm 8 March 2012\n\nGeneral seating 25 euro ticket. I was in the second row one in from the aisle, perfect for seeing facial expressions and footwork.\n\n‘Extremo Jondo’ by Fuensanta ‘La Moneta’\n\nDance: Fuensanta ‘La Moneta’\n\nSong: Miguel Lavi\n\nGuitar: Luis Mariano\n\nPercussion: Miguel ‘El Cheyenne’\n\nAs with Mercedes Ruiz, ‘La Moneta’ was given two evening Festival shows, one on the night there was no Villamarta show. Last night she lost a shoe mid-dance but carried on until she could go off and change. It’s hardly surprising she breaks shoes, she dances like a fury. Or as she puts in the programs notes, like she is in the trance of deep song.\n\nCertainly this was a tour de force show by a gifted dancer. She was on stage for all but one unaccompanied voice solo. We saw the full range of emotions from playful to distraught and her footwork was lightning fast and strong.\n\nShe premiered this show in Granada, her home town, in 2010 and a DVD of the show was on sale tonight so she has had plenty of time to polish it. The only issue for me was that I was not at all moved by the singer so whilst I am in awe of ‘La Moneta’s’ ability I could not connect fully with the music.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nTeatro Villamarta, Festival De Jerez, Jerez De La Frontera, 9pm 7 March 2012\n\nStall ticket included in Festival Registration but I swapped seats with Stuart and sat nine rows back in stalls dead centre.\n\n‘Tauro’ (Taurus) by Manuel Liñan\n\nProgram:\n\n1. Madre Tierra (Trilla, cantes de labor y temporeras)\n\n2. Entre Las Cuerdas (Granaina)\n\n3. Paseo De !os Tristes (Taranto)\n\n4. Ni Contigo Ni Sin Ti (Sonetas del amor oscuro – cabales y abandolaos)\n\n5. A Puerta Gayola (Solea por bulerias y romance)\n\n6. Elegi A Granada (Zambra, Fandango de Albaicin, Alborea La cachucha, Tanguillo de flor, La Mosca Soleares de Arca) an homage to Chata ‘La Jampona’\n\nDance, choreography and artistic direction: Manuel Liñan\n\nCompany Dancers: Guadalupe Torres, Vanesa Coloma, Cristian Martin\n\nMusical Direction: Luis Mariano\n\nGuitar: Antonia Jimenez, Luis Mariano\n\nSong: Inmaculada Rivero, Mercedes Cortes, Matias Lopez ‘El Mati’\n\nThe program notes state that a large portion of the show is dedicated to the music, dance and poetry of Liñan’s home town of Granada, and especially the poet Lorca. Liñan employed almost the full range of props – baston, manton, bata de cola, casteñuelas and pulled out all stops in his solos. There was inventive use of strips of fabric stretched from the ceiling to the floor as the dancers wove themselves into the material in the 2nd piece and in the 4th piece Liñan danced a moving pas de deux with Martin. This was the first gay male flamenco partnering I have seen. Liñan does not seem to require the company dancers to dance exactly the same when executing the choreography which is more interesting for me. They have their own styles. Martin’s style is extremely classical extended and controlled which is a good foil for Liñan’s fluidity.\n\nApart from a sound problem with Inmaculada Rivereo’s microphone at one stage the singing was wonderful. ‘El Matl’ must be a favourite as Liñan used him in the Seville show too. The guitarists did not seem taxed and at one stage Liñan chose to use pre-recorded guitar for his solo.\n\nIn this, his first major solo show at the Festival, Liñan’s performance was almost flawless. He lost his balance on the second kneeling turn in one sequence but found an opportunity in a later solo to do a run of kneeling turns which he nailed. The Villamarta crowd rewarded Liñan’s show with an immediate and extended standing ovation.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nTeatro Villamarta, Festival De Jerez, Jerez De La Frontera, 9pm 6 March 2012\n\nStall ticket included in Festival Registration\n\n‘Made in Jerez’ by Gerardo Nuñez\n\nGuitar: Gerardo Nuñez\n\nSecond Guitar: Manuel Valencia\n\nDance: Alfonso Losa\n\nSong: David Carpio and Rafael de Utrera\n\nDouble Bass: Pablo Martin\n\nPercussion: Angel Sanchez ‘Cepillo’\n\nWhat a joy this was from start to finish – the whole hour and 45 minutes. Local boy done well and loving being home with some great mates who are also awesome performers, every one. I dig the swing Nuñez is able to put into his music and the ebb and flow of the pieces. Alfonso Lonso did some all too brief dance interludes before coming back for a longer Bulerias piece at the end. His style is along the lines of the Farrruco family – explosive and exciting. While Nuñez took a break it was fun to see the percussionist playing the double base as a drum with the double base player plucked out a hook and looped it. Utrea was a wonderful surprise to me with his piercing, sweet voice. I can’t wait to hear him again.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nTeatro Villamarta, Festival De Jerez, Jerez De La Frontera, 9pm 5 March 2012\n\nStall Ticket included in Festival registration\n\nmuDANZAs BOLERAs 1812-2012\n\nDance:\n\nFrancisco Velasco\n\nPenelope Sanchez\n\nElena Miño\n\nDaniel Morillo\n\nMyriam Manso\n\nSergio Bernal\n\nRecorded music\n\nOriginal idea and artistic direction: Sharon Sapienza assisted by Rocio Coral\n\nTaking the 200th anniversary of the signing of the Spanish constitution as an opportunity to recreate Spanish dance pieces loosely woven around a dance company plot sounds like an interesting concept but you really have to like Boleros and castenets to sit through an hour and thirty minutes of it, espevially when there is no live music. All the dancers were wonderfully talented, especially Velasco in his ‘drunk’ dance, and the two young men in their duet which had them in the air more than on the ground.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nTeatro Villamarta, Festival De Jerez, Jerez De La Frontera, 9pm 4 March 2012\n\nStall Ticket included in Festival registration\n\n‘Vinatica’ by Rocio Molina\n\nDance, concept, choreography, musical and artistic direction: Rocio Molina with additional musical direction by Rosario ‘La Tremendita’\n\nSong and Mandola: Jose Angel Carmona\n\nGuitar and original music: Eduardo Trassiera\n\nPalmas and Compas: Jose Manuel Ramos ‘El Oruco’\n\nRocio Molina performed this in Seville in 2010 so some of the shock value may have worn off for others but for me it was a revelation. With the themes of an artwork depicting the Tower of Babel and wine drinking she had a broad canvas to play with. From the first moment when we realised she was onstage from the time the audience started to drift into their seats we knew we were in for something different. Rather than say too much I urge everyone to see it for themselves on youtube or live. Molina has complete control of her body and uses it in ways that are dramatic, comical and often risky. She takes the dance vocabulary and rhythms of flamenco to another galaxy.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nPeña Buena Gente, Festival De Jerez, Jerez De La Fontera, 12:30am 4 March 2012\n\nThis was the worst organised peña event I have been to. They kept the front two rows for the ‘the President’s family’ and then three of the chairs were used for coats while many of us who had been there for 45 minutes waiting for the show to start stood the entire time. The regular dancer did not show so someone in the audience was given shoes and a skirt they pulled from a bag on the side of the stage. A drunk man came in and sat in the singer’s chair. The singer was late. Happily the drunk was not the singer but he stayed close to the stage and yelled loud jaleos far too much. There were probably 150 people trying to cram into a venue that could only comfortably hold 50.\n\nBut……when the performers finally got going they were highly entertaining. I didn’t stay for the second part.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nTeatro Villamarta, Festival De Jerez, Jerez De La Frontera, 9pm, 3 March 2012\n\nStall ticket 25 euro\n\n¡Viva Jerez!\n\nProgram: Seven scenes – The Essence Of Memory\n\nScene 1. On a street\n\nScene 2. A table, a chair\n\nScene 3. A bottle, some glasses\n\nScene 4. A mirror\n\nScene 5. Suitcases\n\nScene 6. Long live Jerez!\n\nScene 7.

As a spectacle it was successful but not riveting. Antonio El Pipa seemed to do much the same as in his show ‘Danzacali’ with the Bulerias his strongest piece. La Macanita was very theatrical, a big presence who received a good response from the audience. They took a while to warm to Macarena Ramirez’ dancing but she won them over in the end.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nPeña Las Cernicoles, Festival De Jerez, Jerez De La Frontera, 1:30am 3 March 2012\n\nBy the time I got to the peña following an after show celebratory dinner this upstairs large peña was heaving with people. A real fire trap. I climbed up on a screen support and craned my neck to get a partial view of the stage and caught the last two dance solos and some of the fin de fiesta. I don’t know which dancers performed but they were a credit to the art and the audience enjoyed them hugely.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nTeatro Villamarta, Festival De Jerez, Jerez De La Frontera, 9pm 2 March 2012\n\nStall ticket included in Fesial registration\n\n‘VORS Jerez Al Cante’ (Very Old Rare Sherry is the appelation given to the most extraordinary of the limited edition thirty-year-old sherry produced in Jerez so the title plays on the fact that the individual careers of these Jerez masters of Flamenco singing typify exceptional quality and authenticity.)\n\nSong:\n\nManuel Moneo\n\nFernando de la Morena\n\nLuis El Zambo\n\nCapullo de Jerez\n\nJuan Moneo ‘El Torta’\n\nManuel Agujetas\n\nGuitar:\n\nPerequin Niño Jeo\n\nDiego del Morao\n\nFernando Moreno\n\nBarullito\n\nCompas and Palmas: Manuel Soto ‘El Bo’, Juan Grande\n\nArtistic Direction: Alfredo Benitez, Jose Maria Castaño, Gonzalo Lopez\n\nIt’s rare to have an entire Villamarta Festial evening devoted to male voice and this joint performance by six grand masters who had never shared a stage together before was much anticipated. I’m told they come from the two different flamenco barrios in Jerez; San Miguel and Santiago, with quite different flamenco traditions even though they are in the same city. Interestingly the printed programs had only five singers listed but by show time the famous gitano (gypsy) singer Manuel Agujetas had joined the line up.\n\nI think the loss of two greatly significant Jerez artists in quick succession, Terremoto and Moraito, prompted this show. Certainly they referenced their passing several times (some have family connections) and we saw two large portraits of them in the finale.\n\nFar from being a solemn occasion they spent much of the time on stage acting like naughty school boys. I pitied the artistic directors (who were visible much of the time in the wings) as they had to be cued and shepherded throughout the evening. The show was also an homage to Jerez/Sherry so the bottles on the table they were drinking were probably the real thing.\n\nI enjoyed this show immensely. My week one seat is the last row of the stalls on the far right and with no one behind me and empty seats around me (many students leave to travel home Friday night) I could just lean back and let the sound wash over me. I even did a little soundless compas since I knew I would not be disturbing anyone!\n\nEverybody has favourites and mine on the night was Manuel Moneo with his big, beautiful sincere and soulful voice. Capullo was entertaining and Agujetas had lots of attitude but Moneo was on the money for me.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nTeatro Villamarta, Festival De Jerez, Jerez De La Frontera, 9pm 1 March 2012\n\nStall Ticket included in Festival registration\n\n‘Pastora’\n\nDance: Pastora Galvan\n\nGuitar: Ramon Amador\n\nSong: Cristian Guerrero, Jose Valencia\n\nPalmas, Compas, and Dance: Bobote\n\nConcept, Choreography and Musical Direction: Israel Galvan\n\nI could not bring myself to comment before now as I was quite conflicted by this show. My main concern is the credits. In every publication I have read sole artistic credit is accorded to Israel Galvan. For a self titled work I therefore do not know what Pastora Galvan contributed beyond the performance on the night. Obviously she had input and she, like her brother would have been hugely influenced by their father, the renowned dancer Jose Galvan, but since she is not credited it leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Having seen Israel Galvan dance in the same place two nights before it was easy to see his work in her rhythms and steps.\n\nWith that off my chest I can now say I enjoyed 70 per cent of the show. Perhaps if I had more context I would have understood more. The opening two long pieces were a parody of Triana, Seville-style peña dancing by the chubby grandmas I saw regularly who would leap up in their jiffy slip ons to pound out a Buleria full bore. In the course of the show Galvan interspersed commentary with Seville-style dance with bata de cola and manton which were a homage to previous generations of bailaoras. Much of it showcased her incredible musicality but I felt the footwork got quite ponderous. Maybe it was meant to be? I guess as I had just seen Mercedes Ruiz which may have influenced me.\n\nBobote provided great support and had his moment in the spotlight dancing Bulerias. The musicians were marvellous but nothing stands out in my memory of their performance.\n\nThe audience took a while to warm to her but by the finale they were on their feet and shouting.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nSala Compañia, Festival De Jerez, Jerez De La Frontera, 7pm 1 March 2012\n\n25 euro general seating\n\n‘Baile De Palabra’ (can mean the dance of promise/speech/word)\n\nDance and choreography: Mercedes Ruiz\n\nSong: David Lagos\n\nGuitar and Musical Direction: Santiago Laura\n\nMercedes Ruiz is the only performer to my knowledge who has given two Festival shows this week. On the Wednesday nights of the Festival there is no Villamarta Show so that performance of Ruiz’ show sold out quickly. I saw the second. I was told there were problems with the sound of the footwork on the floor the first night. That was rectified on the second and for me the performance was almost flawless. I am used to seeing her dance dark emotions, such as in her stunning Farrucca, so it took some time to adjust to the opening dance of pure flirtation and sensuality. She certainly speaks with her body, especially her arms and shoulders.\n\nThe other three dances built in complexity and for sheer technical difficulty this performance, where she used baa de cola (long tailed skirt) and manton (shawl) and bata de cola with casteñuelas (castenets), had to be the most ambitious. To be able to revert to very controlled, complicated castañuela rhythms after such vigorous dancing shows her mastery.\n\nThis was also to first show that had my tear ducts working from the first few notes of David Lagos’ singing. The timbre of his tenor shoots straight to my soul. Santiago Laura was a joy too and the whole flow and staging of the show was seamless as we went from dance to unaccompanied song to duets. Ruiz’ costumes were also a highlight of the Festival to date. The white satin dress with bata de cola was so tight you could clearly see her belly button! The icing on the cake were the three curtain calls when they used the brief blackouts to pose in a freeze frame of three different formations.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nTeatro Villamarta, Festival De Jerez, Jerez De La Frontera, 9pm 28 Februay 2012\n\nStall Ticket included in festival registraton\n\n‘De Flamencas’\n\nDance, Choreography and Artistic Direction: Marco Flores\n\nDance: Guadalupe Torres, Lidon Patiño, Esther Jurado\n\nSong: Mercedes Cortes, Inma Rivero\n\nGuitar: Antonia Jimenez, Bettina Flater\n\nPalmas and Dance: Ana Romero\n\nFandangos and Nana choreographed by Olga Pericet\n\nCostumes: Olga Pericet\n\nProgram:\n\nMariana, Tientos, Tangos\n\nLiviana, Serrana, Fandango, Cantiñas, Granaina, Malagueña\n\nNana, Solea, Romance\n\nThis was the most satisfying show I have ever seen. Not just in this Festival but ever.\n\nFlores called it ‘De Flamencas’ because he created it around the individual and combined strengths of the eight women he generously shared the stage with. From the first piece, an elegant ensemble beautiully lit, he alternated between solos, duets and ensemble pieces that allowed every performer to shine. Flores’ solos were scintillating. He has the skill of making everything look easy but you know as he builds on the complexity and ups the tempo that he is dancing on the edge of what is humanly possible. On top of that he has wonderful staging, musical and lighting sensibilities. And he’s got great sense of humour.\n\nAll the female dancers were gorgeous. It wouldn’t be fair to single anyone out, they were all allowed to dance to their strengths. The only issue they encountered was that Inma Romero’s microphone failed two thirds into the show but she just sang more powerully and the audience responded with loud ‘Ole’s’.\n\nAntonia Jimenez is a brilliant guitarist but a terrible dancer. After a long standing ovation Jimenez was urged to dance in the fin de fiesta and looked like an electrified black chook. It is possibly the first time that both guitarists at a Villamarta spectacular were women.\n\nMy only wish is that I could go and watch the entire show again.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nTeatro Villamarta, Festival De Jerez, Jerez De La Frontera, 9pm 27 February 2012\n\nStall Ticket included in festival registration\n\n‘La Curva’ (‘The bend/curve/turn/crook/crease’)\n\nDance, musical and artistic direction: Israel Galvan\n\nPiano and musical composition: Sylvie Courvoisier\n\nSong: Ines Bacan\n\nCompas: Bobote\n\nNo one who has ever seen Israel Galvan perform is indifferent to him as an artist. They either walk out or say politely they don’t care for his style. The usual reason given is that he is not ‘flamenco puro’. Those like me who think he is a lunatic genius, the savant of flamenco, would walk on hot coals to witness a new piece by him.\n\nThis work is a collaboration with the Theatre de la Ville, Paris, and is inspired in part (according to the program notes) by an avant garde jazz dance piece created by Escudero in 1924 in Paris. I don’t know that piece but the marathon of originality Galvan unleashed on the audience tonight was shocking in the best sense of the word.\n\nHe began in silence with all performers on stage. As if to announce that he was toppling expectations he pushed a stack of about 20 alumnium chairs over into the wings and then carried one back on stage.\n\nThe man is tall, extremely lean and ultra fit. Think of the shape of the traditional Pierrot. Wearing skintight black pants and shirt with a thin white scarf, white boots and a tan leather jacket that reached his thighs he used his arms, hands and soles of boots on the floor and his body, especially the jacket, to create rythmic sounds. All while contorting at high speed. Then with piano and compas accompaniment he built up even more rapid movement all with impeccable control.\n\nInes Bacan then sang an a capella solo that reached right inside me. I thought it her best of the night. None of her songs were noted on the program so I don’t know what it was but it broke my heart. Sylvie Courvoisier is a consummate pianist and as the evening progressed she used more and more unusal techniques to create cascading melodic and sometimes jarring passages. Reaching in to pluck strings and using her finger nails to create tapping sounds interspersed with notes, the rippling effect was hypnotic. Bobote’s role seemed to be to accentuate the beat and urge on the other performers.\n\nIn the course of the performance Galvan danced on and under a table, performed an amazing routine on a 2m by 4 metre board, danced with a wooden chair around his neck, created another persona and had a conversation with him (along the lines of, ‘The public is death’, ‘Death is the public’).\n\nTowards the end he took off the jacket and used huge amounts of what looked like chalk dust he’d carried in on drum skin to deaden the sound of his taps and with the dust rising as he kicked and twirled it evoked Aboriginal dancers I’ve seen in Australia and North America.\n\nHe did the final piece without boots. Diving and rolling in the chalk dust what was black became white. He was clearly mocking traditional flamenco steps as he did a brief duet with Bobote.\n\nThe performance received a standing ovation and three call backs. Not bad for for ‘flamenco no puro’. Galvan is certainly well ahead of the curve!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nTeatro Villamarta, Festival De Jerez, Jerez De La Frontera, 9pm 26 February 2012\n\nStall Ticket included in festival registration\n\n‘Ensayo Flamenco 2012’ (Flamenco Essays 2012)\n\nSong and Musical Direction: Carmen Liñares\n\nDance: Belen Maya\n\nGuitar: Salvador Gutierrez, Eduardo Pacheco\n\nPiano: Pablo Suarez\n\nPercussion: Antonio Coronel\n\nThere were two supporting female singers who also did compas but they were not credited in either program.\n\nAs a German acquaintance pointed out to me it is unusual for song to be the dominant element of a Villamarta show and doubly unusual for both the singer and the dancer to be female. Carmen Liñares is however a grand dame of flamenco singing at age 61 and her invited artist, Belen Maya (who Liñares said she has known since she was a child) also has a deserved reputation as an inventive, skilled bailarina.\n\nThe show was in concert format with 11 songs, starting with only grand piano accompaniment for the first few. Linares said that by the ‘Essay’ approach she wanted to create a time for original musical moments that are unique and unrepeatable. She takes a lot of musical risks which is very admirable when she could rest on her laurels.\n\nMaya danced twice. The first time with a bata de cola. Using evocative upper body work she gave the impression she was struggling against constraints imposed by the skirt and with herself. The second piece, the final song, was a more traditional flamenco style. She started with unaccompanied soniquete, but she again exaggerated flamenco movements to show how rote they can become, and quite void of meaning.\n\nMy favourite pieces were #3: Mis Ojos Sin Tus Ojos (My Eyes Without Your Eyes) with lyrics by Miguel Hernandez, #8 Moguer (A town in Huelva province) with lyrics by Juan Ramon Jimenez and #10 Bulerias Lorquinas with lyrics by Federico Garcia Lorca.\n\nLiñares gave an encore of an a capella rendition of a patriotic Andalucian song in honour of the provincial holiday this week.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nPeña Antonio Chacon, Jerez De La Frontera, 12mn 25 February 2012\n\nFree entry as part of the Festival program\n\nSinger: Manuel Monito\n\nGuitar: Manuel Romero\n\nBoth performers are from Jerez.\n\nThis is a large peña walking distance from the town centre. I had a front row seat. By the time the show actually started at 12:30am it was bulging. They had publicised that Davinia would be dancing and I checked at interval when they confirmed she would dance two solos but in fact the only dancing was the fin de fiesta bulerias. No complaints though as it was a full throttle performance by Monito of a wide range of material and they performed until 2:30am.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nTeatro Villamarta, Festival De Jerez, Jerez De La Frontera, 9pm 25 February 2012\n\nStall seat assigned by the Festival as part of the class and show package. Mine was the last row last seat on the side so not ideal but just happy to be there with my opera glasses.\n\n‘El Aire Que Me Lleva’ (‘The Air That Lifts Me’)\n\nDancers and Choreography: Andres Peña and Pilar Ogalla\n\nSingers: David Paolomar, Londro, Jesus Bienvenido (Tango and Milonga), Esther Weekes (‘I got rhythm’)\n\nGuitarists: Ricardo Rivera, Javier Patino\n\nPiano: Alberto Miras\n\nSaxophone: Antonio Lizana\n\nTrumpet: Lipi Calvo\n\nPercussion: Javier Catumba\n\nMusical Guidance: David Montero\n\nAssistance with Direction: Belen Maya\n\nThis was a much anticipated world premiere as its been three years since their last Jerez spectacular and to give them the first Saturday night slot must have raised expectations, and the pressure, even higher. I have to declare as a loyal student of Andres and admirer of Pilar that I came to the performance willing them to do well. Andres said in pre-show interviews that they were not trying to do ‘Swan Lake’, they just wanted to show the air currents, winds and influences that lift and carry us through life including the sweet, sad, happy periods.\n\nThis was the program:\n\nLevante: Farruca-Seguiriya-Solea (Andres and Pilar duet, she wearing short skirt and Andres in shirt and tie followed by Pilar’s solo and two intense solos by Andres.)\n\nSudestada: Milonga-Tango argentino bor bulerias-Tango a lo argentino (Literally moving southeast the Argentinian influence was sensual and light. I adored Pilar’s flirtatious bata de cola sola with abañico/fan.)\n\nSantana: Ranchera-Fandango jarocho-Fandango de Huelva\n\nViento Norte: Cancion-Martinete (This was the North American influence with Andres breaking his own rules and ripping into a full bore tap piece ‘I Got Rhythm’ from ‘An American in Paris’ complete with pork pie hat and long scarf. It was a great rendition. He still had flamenco shoulders but who am I to criticise?!)\n\nPoniente: Tientos y tangos-Cantiña y bulerias (Back to western Spain’s Flamenco roots just to show us they can do it all. Andres is the master of Bulerias (as I witnessed firsthand in class for three months) so this was a real treat.\n\nOverall the show was a hit and they received a unanimous standing ovation. My only suggestion would be for them to check the lighting from all parts of the audience seating in future venues as it was too low sometimes when they used spotlights.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nSala Compañia, Festival De Jerez, Jerez De La Frontera, 7pm 25 February 2012\n\n21 euro general seating\n\n‘Desde La Orilla’ (‘From The Edge’)\n\nDancer: Karime Amaya\n\nSingers: Paul Levia, Amador, Joaquin Gomez Contrera, Rubio de Pruna\n\nGuitarists: Justo Fernandez Heredia ‘El Tuto’ (Invited artist), Tati Amaya\n\nPercussion: Juan Cristobal Sanchez\n\nThe resemblance to her great (in all senses of that word) aunt Carmen Amaya is striking in the face and posture and Karime references her frequently in her steps and costuming, but this is no copycat show. This cat is much more sophisticated. The title was a smart choice as one sensed Karime felt she was crossing a boundary by coming to Jerez and taking this next leap in her career trajectory. Also the choices she made choreographically were brave. As she grew up in Mexico (that branch of the Amaya family stayed on after a tour) and studied in the states and travelled for her art Karime probably feels like she is always crossing boundaries to grow.\n\nShe began with a striking Seguiriya in a red fringed figure hugging dress that showed she is more curvacious than her great aunt. Annoyingly the cajon overshadowed her footwork for the first section but we had plenty of opportunity later to enjoy her clear, rapid zapateado. Both in time and contratiempo she seemed determined to demonstrate that she was not trading on the name, she has the goods.\n\nThe second piece was an alegrias which she danced in black, skin tight high-waisted pants and a white and black bolero jacket and black and white ruffled shirt (a la Carmen). This was more fun as she was warmed up and nailed her multiple spins.\n\nThe guitar solo that followed was gorgeous and gave us time to digest what we’d just witnessed. Of the singers whilst all were wonderful, I enjoyed Rubio De Pruna the most.\n\nHer final piece was a solea por bulerias for which she wore a simple black stretch velvet dress and shawl. Now she pulled out all stops and ran well over time as she seemed determined to let off every firework she had in her basket. A one point she was right in front of me (I was second row) and I felt like she was exploding/dancing just for me. The audience loved it and she received a standing ovation. Sadly the auditorium was only two-thirds full.\n\nKarime then addressed the audience in Spanish briefly, saying what an honour it was to perform in Jerez for the first time (I will upload the clip). The fin de fiesta was the usual goofing around in high spirits.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nTeatro Villamarta, Festival De Jerez, Jerez De La Frontera, 9pm 24 February 2012\n\n25 euro stall seat\n\n‘Metafora’ by Ballet Flamenco de Andalucia.\n\nDirection and choreography: Ruben Olmo assisted by Rocio Coral\n\nSoloists: Patricia Guerrero and Eduardo Leal\n\nCorps: Sara Vasquez, Ana Agras, Marta Arias, Monica Iglesias, Maise Marquez, Juan Carlos, Cardoso, Angel Fariña, Fernando Jimenez, Alvaro Paños\n\nSingers: Fabiola, Manuel ‘El Zambullo’\n\nGuitarists: David Carmona, Manuel de la Luz\n\nPercussion: David ‘Chupete’\n\nCordoba Symphony Orchestra\n\nInvited Artists: Rocio Molina and Pastora Galvan\n\nThis company spectacular opened the two-week 2012 Festival. For me it was a good choice as the depth of the company, including the newish Director Ruben Olmo, plus invited artists Rocio Molina and Pastora Galvan, gave us a good two solid hours of high quality entertainment. I don’t usually rave about synchronised dancing (too much like competitive synchronised swimming) but many of the pieces were excellently choreographed providing continuous variation with impeccable control. I saw only one slip by a male dancer in the second half – arm up when everyone else’s was down.\n\nAll the music was impeccable. I especially loved Fabiola. Lighting and the minimalist staging were effective.\n\nThey opened with the male corps who set the standard for the show then the six female dancers performed a wonderful Alegrias with bata de cola and manton (long skirt and large shawl) which was billed as an homage to Matilde Coral. Pastora Galvan joined for an inventive and sensual solo but she overdoes the tortured face for what is essentially a joyful dance. I was seated in front of Matilde Coral who shouted ‘¡Ole! every few minutes so she obviously approved.\n\nThe Tarantos by the soloists was strong. I thought Patricia shone more than Eduardo but there was no real spark between the two of them. Pastora’s solo and a company Tangos completed the first half which was the ‘flamenco’ section.\n\nThe second half morphed from an unaccompanied voice duet to orchestral classical music and we were in the world of Spanish dance but Spanish dance both embellished by ballet, as in the solo by Olmo, and Spanish dance deconstructed by Rocio Molina in her solo. Dressed in an ivory strapless short bata she resembled a beautiful android programmed to dance but with the program scrambled. Nothing was as you might expect. Brilliant.\n\nThe final company piece, in all black, ‘Body and Soul’, was a fitting finish, giving short solos to all the corps who had not solo’d previously. Very thoughtful staging.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nTeatro Central, Sevilla, 9pm 2 December 2011\n\n12 euro general seating\n\nThis event was organised by the Seville Federation of Flamenco as a tribute to the guitarist Manolo Brenes who was born in Brenes in 1924. The artists named in the original program changed somewhat so I can’t be sure I have recorded this absolutely correctly.\n\nFirst Part\n\nManolo Franco y Niño Pura (Los Compadres)\n\nSinger: Manuela Cordera\n\nJuan A. Muñoz ‘El Chozas’\n\nDance: Carmen Ledesma and her group\n\nSecond Part\n\nSinger: Jose Meneses\n\nJ. Angel Carmon\n\nDance: ‘El Junco’\n\nGuitar: Antonio Carrion, Pedro Sierra and Eduardo Trasierr\n\nComment: This was a huge program even with the substitutions (Rocio Molina and ‘La Tremendita’ were billed but did not perform). My favourites of the evening were the guitarist Pedro Sierra and the dancer ‘El Junco’ (‘The Reed’ because he is very tall and slender). I had seen him perform at Tablao El Arenal but did not know his name. He has what seems like an effortless, graceful style and fantastic footwork.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nSala Joaquin Turina, Centro Cultural Cajasol, Sevilla, 9pm 1 December 2011\n\n‘La Puerta A"
