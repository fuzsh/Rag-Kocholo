        "text": "The lights are turned on and the artists enter the tablao to the rhythm of alegrías. The dancers appear in their spectacular batas de cola. Moving them requires a refined technique, a skill that our artists possess, as they demonstrate on the tablao.\n\nDisplaying an unmistakable style and unparalleled talent, they add to the movement of the bata de cola, the fan and castanets, while the dancers complete the staging with their particular heels and movements.\n\nThe flamenco shawl is also present in the tablao, an element that gives elegance and beauty to the dance, thanks to the movements of the dancer.\n\nIt is not easy to achieve this beauty, as it requires a good technique.\n\nIt is not simply a matter of shaking the shawl, but rather it must be done in rhythm and the shawl must be an extension of the dancer’s body. The shawl must dance with the movement of the artist’s arms with the right rhythm and strength.\n\nDepending on the palo to be performed, the accent of the movement varies.\n\nThen, our artists perform some of the most representative flamenco styles of pure and traditional dance: soleá por bulería, fandango, tiento, guajira…, giving free rein to their talent.\n\nIt is then when one of the most magical moments of the show takes place. The flamenco guitar bursts in accompanied by the peculiar sound of the castanets.\n\nA piece performed by a guitarist and a dancer, a dialogue between these two instruments that create a unique atmosphere full of feeling.\n\nIn the next show, flamenco gives way to Spanish classics. Capotes and fans fill the tablao and a fragment of the well-known opera “Carmen”, by Bizet, one of the works most adapted to flamenco because of its aesthetics and plot, begins.\n\nOn this occasion several scenes are represented: the fight of the protagonist Carmen with the cigarette seller and the soldiers; a pas de deux between José, the soldier, another of the protagonists, and Carmen; the mythical scene of the bullfighter and Carmen and a final apotheosis, with the whole cast of artists on the boards. A tribute to the Spanish Classical Ballet, a bastion of tradition and culture.\n\nNormally, the concept of classical Spanish ballet is usually identified with flamenco dance. In fact, Spanish classical music has adapted quite well to this genre, with pieces by different authors, such as Manuel de Falla, Maestro Jimenez and, of course, Georges Bizet, with ‘Carmen’.\n\nAfter the performance of this piece, begins a brief journey through the roots of flamenco, in which a soleá, tangos de Málaga, farruca, cantiña and even caracoles, one of the oldest and unknown palos for the public, will be performed. Moments in which the artists leave their most personal mark on stage.\n\nWith all the artists on stage, some tangos from Triana begin to play, and the cast is carried away by their feelings. It is time for improvisation.\n\nAnd with this we give way to one of the most awaited and applauded moments by the audience: a standing solo in which the main dancer dances on a table, followed by a duet with a flamenco cajón in which he plays to the sound of the dancer’s footwork, a unique moment to appreciate the richness of the flamenco rhythm.\n\nThe flamenco continues with a martinete and seguiriyas, flamenco styles that anticipate the typical and most recognised dance of Seville, the sevillanas, which give way, to finish, to the end of the party in the purest flamenco style with a bulería performed by all the artists.\n\nA style in which the joy, the hubbub and the hullabaloo put an end to a unique flamenco show, full of art and feeling."
