        "text": "From pre-modern Christmas pageants all the way through to Jordan Peele’s “sunken place”—a place where, as Simone de Beauvoir has written, the subjectivity of “sovereign and unique” beings “is crushed by the dark weight of other things,” Whiteness and Blackness have been conjoined in a series of negative correlations. Purity and pollution, harmony and dissonance, over and under, order and disorder, Christian epiphany and damning confusion have limned the edge distinguishing freedom and personhood from enslavement and abjection. Yet in these paradigmatic dyads one term always implies—indeed, defines—the other; in these relations there is never erasure, but rather evidence of white culture’s perverse fascination—envy, even—with the sonorous, dislocated, inciting, and infinitely suggestive products of black culture. The impolite music and dance of cacophony, dissonance, and disorder vibrate with a fugitive, turbulent Otherness, hinting at the specters of alternate social, spiritual, and aesthetic orders. “What does it mean,” Fred Moten asks in The Undercommons: Fugitive Planning and Black Study (2013), “to call for disorder in the sovereign’s ‘native tongue?’” We must attend to cacophony, Moten writes; we must “inhabit and maybe even cultivate…[the] place which shows up here and now, in the sovereign’s space and time, as absence, darkness, death, things which are not.“ Stuart Hall has theorized diaspora as a “radical homelessness,” an expression of an “ethics of the self…attuned to the edges.” Flamencos, whose embodied and minstrelized Blackness is figured by the Spanish Roma, have always known this statelessness, have always adhered to this code. How, then, can flamenco illuminate theories of race and identity in performance? And, conversely, how can the theoretical tools developed in other fields help us better understand flamenco? How may we consider flamenco’s purposefully duplicitous roar, its nonsense, and its irony, in light not only of critical race theory but also of other approaches, such as ethics, or theories of gender, or of sound? And, regarding the purposeful ambiguity of calling for disorder in the sovereign’s tongue, why are some of the great theorists, such as June Jordan, and Fred Moten, poets? How can black poetics help us read, and explain to others, flamenco’s life blood, its verses? As VK Preston has wondered, when cultural wealth—verse, rhythm, or gesture, for example—is extracted, smelted, and rendered into the likeness of the oppressor, what of its animating spirit, what of its soul remains?7 And, speaking of dancing in shackles, why do the footwork steps used in early modern Spanish depictions of ruffians dancing under the lash bear such an uncanny resemblance to the shuffle steps of African American dances? That is to say, how can we posit, and argue for, genealogical relationships across the vast expanses of the African diaspora? And how may the codes of flamenco improvisation help us trace these? We don’t need to be limited to flamenco, and we don’t need to be limited to these questions. We want with this gathering to reach out, find connection, and cross the border into what Jack Halberman calls “The Wild Beyond,” to make “common cause with the brokenness of being”— “a brokenness,” he writes, “that is also blackness.”\n\nRecent studies on performance theory have turned their attention to the process of constructing social identities. This article proposes to examine the case of Gitano and non-Gitano relationships under this light. The field research in Jerez de la Frontera of Andalusia, has shown that 'objective' differences between the two groups seem to be minimal, although the members of the two groups recognize and present themselves as different. Relevant literature on Gitanos and their relationship to flamenco argues for a biological affinity of Gitano 'race' with flamenco singing and dancing. In a similar vein the indigenous discourse among Gitanos and among non-Gitanos justifies one group or the other as cultural owners and natural heirs of flamenco. Thus flamenco becomes a contested measure of social identity. This research attempts to reveal the power of the emic discourse on flamenco debate and to understand it under a constructivistic point of view. Based on the modern turn of Gypsy studies the present article re-examines the Gitanos/non-Gitanos relationship by focusing on the ways people negotiate their differences from the other group. Moreover, it attempts to observe and understand how these negotiated identities are performed on the social stage either on everyday life occasions or festivities.\n\nThis book, written in an accessible and open style, on the one hand offers English speakers an overview of flamenco as a musical form or set of musical practices, and, on the other, uses flamenco to interrogate some of the ways in which social bonds and ideas of ‘truth’ and ‘authenticity’ are played out by both flamenco musicians and lovers of flamenco in Southern Spain. The book is divided into six chapters (including the introductory chapter and a concluding chapter) and is based on research undertaken in Spanish archives and at flamenco performances at local peñas and tablaos on trips to Madrid, Seville, Granada and Málaga funded by the British Academy in 2013-2015. The book aims to be both introductory (in that it assumes no prior knowledge of flamenco, introducing and explaining terms and concepts carefully and systematically) and analytical (in both the music-analytical sense of the term and in the sense of ‘critical’, drawing, that is, on recent developments in the fields of affect theory, critiques of identity and identity politics and gender and sexuality studies). The book differs from much Spanish- and English-language scholarship on flamenco in that it: 1. Offers detailed and technical engagement with musical examples 2. Seeks to represent recent and classic Spanish-language scholarship to an English audience 3. Seeks to balance the demands of music-analytical approaches and cultural/contextual approaches 4. Seeks to give voice to ‘insider’ narratives about flamenco from within the flamenco-practising communities formed since the beginning of the twentieth century 5. Offers gender and sexuality-inflected analyses of flamenco largely missing from the scholarship to date 6. Discusses how flamenco practices and identities have been represented on film (in both narrative cinema and in documentaries) 7. Offers a detailed and critical discography of flamenco from 1901 through to the present\n\nIn order to understand Gypsies from a variety of perspectives I have carried out flamenco fieldwork in Granada, Gran Canaria (Spain) and ethnomusicology studies. In this paper I will suggest using oral, written and audiovisual sources to evaluate the comments of flamenco participants, to trace how the instruments are played and to understand how flamenco is performed. Many gypsies artists frequently cross their natural borders and take from folk and popular music, since like all of us they live in a globalized world. We must not assume, therefore, that they have been living in isolation. Since they have a complex and contested multi-cultural identity, it is not surprising that they have assimilated new sounds, forms and harmonies originating in different cultures. My experience of studying flamenco gypsies outside its \"normative territory\" of Southern Spain brings new perspectives (using other languages and sources) and I find new musical meanings assigned to this specific musical genre. These processes of recasting meanings from new theoretical perspectives alien to the flamenco tradition are as important from the outside as they are from within."
