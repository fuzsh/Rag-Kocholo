        "text": "The subject of this paper is the unconventional and highly subversive treatment of musical material of folkloric origin in the films of Pedro Almodóvar: 'Pepi, Luci, Bom and Other Girls on the Heap' ('Pepi, Luci, Bom y otras chicas del montón', 1980) and 'Labyrinth of Passion' ('Laberinto de pasiones', 1982). These films are representative examples of the director's experimental artistic poetics based on the interweaving of local and global cultural features. The focus is, therefore, on the folkloric elements of the Spanish and Catalan musical tradition and their transformation and recontextualisation in relation to the socio-political reality of post-fascist Spain. Consequently, well-known theatrical musical pieces and dances such as the pasodoble, zarzuela and sardana acquire transgressive qualities through an unusual play with traditional and postmodern signifiers, aimed at overthrowing conservative patriarchal authority under the Francoist regime.\n\nBaroque (1989), directed by Paul Leduc, is an experimental film based on the book Concierto Barroco (Baroque Concerto) by Alejo Carpentier, a Cuban writer and musicologist. The work charts a very distinct course to address the creation of identities, the idiosyncrasy of each culture, and musical syncretism, through a highly appropriate context for this type of study: the conquest and colonization of Latin America. By examining these ideas in depth, the article draws attention to the cultural process that began with the Europeans’ arrival in Latin America. At the same time, it allows us to identify the musical and ethnic elements corresponding to each culture (Spanish, South American and even African and Asian) and to observe how coexistence transformed them, to produce a new kind of music which each culture ultimately identified as their own. The experimental nature of the film is evident in the use of intertextuality and collage to maintain continuity, and a total lack of dialogue. These elements add value both to the message explored in this audiovisual analysis and also to the channel of expression Leduc employs. Baroque is a film about identity and protest and includes numerous visual representations of “baroqueness.” In this article we analyse how Leduc highlights Latin American cultural syncretism and, at the same time, question whether cinema can be responsible for creating non-real historical perspectives through the symbolic representation of specific facts or processes of identification.

Cinema quickly seized the opportunity to capture sound and image simultaneously and integrated singers who were already idolized during the early decades of the twentieth century into its star system. In this context, the musical performer not only became a cult figure but also became transmedial, regularly appearing as a cinematic character. On this occasion, we aim to analyse some parallelisms in how sound cinema capitalized on the success of Carlos Gardel — tango singer — and Amália Rodrigues — fado singer — in their respective countries, to shape the figure of the singer as a film character and project them nationally and internationally as identity emblems. To this end, we will analyse some films starring them, where they play the role of singers. From Gardel, we will take Melodía de arrabal [Suburban melody] (Louis J. Gasnier, 1932) and El día que me quieras [The day that you love me] (John Reinhardt, 1935), while from Amália, we have chosen Fado, história de uma cantadeira [Fado, Story of a Singer] (Perdigão Queiroga, 1947) and Sangue toureiro [Bullfighter’s Blood] (Augusto Fraga, 1958).\n\nhe acute processes of globalisation at the turn of the century have generated an increased interest in exploring the interactions between the so-called global cultural products or trends and their specific local manifestations. Even though cross-cultural connections are becoming more patent in filmic productions in the last decades, cinema per se has always been characterized by its hybrid, transnational, border-crossing nature. From its own inception, Spanish film production was soon tied to the Hollywood film industry for its subsistence, but other film traditions such as those in the Soviet Union, France, Germany and, in particular, Italy also determined either directly or indirectly the development of Spanish cinema. Global Genres, Local Films: The Transnational Dimension of Spanish Cinema reaches beyond the limits of the film text and analyses and contextualizes the impact of global film trends and genres on Spanish cinema in order to study how they helped articulate specific national challenges from the conflict between liberalism and tradition in the first decades of the 20th century to the management of the contemporary financial crisis. This collection provides the first comprehensive picture of the complex national and supranational forces that have shaped Spanish films, revealing the tensions and the intricate dialogue between cross-cultural aesthetic and narrative models on the one hand, and indigenous traditions on the other, as well as the political and historical contingencies these different expressions responded to.\n\nCarlos Saura’s “pure musicals,” as he calls them, are highly based on the formal properties of the image and the expressive use of light in a minimalist scenic space. Although, they have not been declared screendance pieces (as per Rosenberg 2012), which conjoin rhythmic body movements with screen-based, technologically mediated methods of rendering, they are full-fledged screendance examples, being hybrid, symbiotic, and integral (Richard James Allen, 2006). This article concentrates on Saura’s musicals from 2005 onwards – Flamenco (1995), Iberia (2005), Fados (2007), Flamenco Flamenco (2010), Argentina (Zonda, folclore argentino, 2015) and Jota de Saura (2016) – particularly the immersive mediation operated through the use of live video feed as an intermedial sensorial device. Saura’s silky, glossy, and lustrous images form an optical-haptic continuum. The twofold bodies, the digital doubles and the flesh-and-bone act as inducers of crystallization in Gilles Deleuze’s perception of modern cinema (1985), inasmuch as they interact and alternate in a cinematic flux, forming a circuit. Thus, an image of a recorded stage performance enters into a relationship with cinema, a medium already endowed with reflective features, producing the crystallization of these screendance films in all their Saurian immersivenness and sensoriality."
