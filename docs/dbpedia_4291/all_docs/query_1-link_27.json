        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe construction of the conspicuous paper, carton or wax nests by worker wasps, termites and bees has long invited investigation, and has generated many fertile ideas, including templates, self-organization, self-assembly and stigmergy (indirect communication through the environment). What wasps, termites and bees build and how they build it has been reviewed several times (Downing and Jeanne 1988; Theraulaz et. al. 1999; Seeley 1995; Karsai and Penzes 1993; Winston 1987; Hansell 1984; Wilson 1971; Korb, 2003). The nests of these social insects are examples of how complex results can emerge from the actions of many independent workers responding using simple rules to local information. In recent years, there has been intense interest in such emergent, self-organizing phenomena, in part because of the perception that they are central to social insect colonies.\n\nIn contrast, the architecture of subterranean ant nests is largely terra incognita, and the literature on it is sparse, unsystematic, unquantitative and non-experimental. These subterranean nests are hidden from view, and are fundamentally different because they are made by the removal of soil, not by construction. As a result, these nests are more difficult to study, and have received little attention. By and large, information on them is collected incidentally, rather than as a primary goal of research. Moreover, interior spaces are difficult to render from excavations, and most reports are simply verbal descriptions of nest structure or drawings of variable detail, with little quantitative or comparative information (McCook 1879; Wheeler 1910; Talbot and Kennedy 1940; 1964; Scherba 1961; Ettershank 1968; Dlussky 1968; MacKay 198133; Kugler and Hincapie 1983; Conway 1983; Lavigne, 1969; Nielsen and Jensen, 1975; McCahon and Lockwood, 1990; Bristow et al., 1992: Peeters 1994; Antonialli-Junior and Gianotti 1997; Crosland 1995; Nielsen and Jensen 1975; Ettershank 1971). At one extreme, excavation of the nests of Atta species, in spite of being a heroic undertaking, has been reported several times (Autuori 1942; Jonkman 1980; Moser, 1963).\n\nA few studies provided some quantitative description of the architecture of ant nests. Tschinkel (1987; 1999b) and Mikheyev and Tschinkel (2004) determined chamber area and shape in relation to depth and colony size in Prenolepis imparis, Pogonomyrmex badius and Formica pallidefulva, respectively. In P. badius and F. pallidefulva, average chamber size decreased downward, whereas spacing between chambers increased, so that over half the total chamber area was in the top quarter of the nest. In both, nest size was strongly correlated to the number of workers in the colony. The use of dental plaster to make casts of ant nests, first reported by Williams and Lofgren (1988), introduced a superior method for rendering the interior space of nests in three dimensions, and is one of the methods used in the work described here.\n\nIn spite of the shortcomings of most nest architectural studies, it is clear that ant nests are highly structured and species-typical in both size and morphology. It is much less apparent that the distribution of colony members and activities within natural nests are also spatially structured. Such structure takes on more significance when the ant colony is viewed as a superorganism. As observed by Bonner (1974) and Sendova-Franks and Franks (1995), the parts of a “regular” organism are attached to one another to create a spatial structure, but the individuals in a social insect colony move freely. Spatial structure of a social insect colony, unlike the nest it occupies, is thus not immediately apparent. However, the generally centrifugal movement of aging workers away from the brood (Hölldobler and Wilson 1990) creates an association of worker age, location and task, that is, a spatial social structure, even in laboratory colonies (Hölldobler and Wilson 1990; Sendova Franks and Franks 1995).\n\nMost field studies, even those based on careful excavations, provide no quantitative information on the distribution of ants among nest chambers (Dlussky 1981; Darlington 1997; Conway 1983). Exceptions include Kondoh's (1968a, b) study of the seasonal distribution of fat-repletes within the nest of Formica japonica. Pogonomyrmex harvester ants show consistent patterns of distribution of seeds within their subterranean nests (Lavigne 1969; Tschinkel, 1999a, b). In several species of harvester ants, and in Prenolepis imparis, workers are stratified by age and season: young workers are found deep in the nest and migrate upward as much as 3 to 4 meters as they age (Chew 1960; Golley and Gentry 1964; MacKay 1981ab; Tschinkel 1987; Tschinkel 1998; 1999a, b; Porter and Jorgesen 1981). In Pogonomyrmex badius nests, seeds are stored exclusively in chambers between 40 and 100 cm below ground, and brood and newly emerged workers are located primarily in the bottom third. Movement of aging workers away from the brood therefore causes them to migrate upward in the nest, leading to an increase in older workers in the upper regions of the nest (Tschinkel 1999b). Worker density increases dramatically with depth, with young workers densely packed in the lower chambers and older workers sparsely occupying the upper chambers. By inserting barriers to vertical movement from the side of a pit, Tschinkel showed that these distributions are not artifacts of driving ants downward during the excavation procedure. The great vertical spread of the nest is thus associated with an equally great vertical organization of the colony within.\n\nA few descriptions of worker nest-excavation behavior exist, most notably those of Sudd (1969; 1982), who tried to derive the nest's architecture from the orientations of individual ants digging in moist sand in the laboratory. However, these ants never produced chambers. Mikheyev and Tschinkel (2004) found that chambers in F. pallidefulva nests tend to be oriented like the shafts leading to them. Franks & Deneubourg (1997) examined the construction (not excavation) of the simple nest walls of an ant that nests between flat rocks, and showed that simple behaviors accounted for most of the nest attributes. Several researchers estimated the work involved in nest excavation (Sabiti 1980; Nielsen and Jensen 1975; Lockaby and Adams 1985), but the emphasis in these was ecological, not architectural. Sudd (1969) estimated that a worker might expend 10% of its daily energy intake on nest excavation. Nests of F. pallidefulva that moved twice a year would expend about 20% of their energy intake and 6% of their time on nest excavation (Mikheyev and Tschinkel, 2004). Sudd and Franks (1987) summarized construction of above ground mounds.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe subterranean nests of the Florida harvester ant, P. badius, show clear, consistent, species-typical structural patterns. Among these are a top-heaviness of chamber-area distribution, a decrease of chamber size and complexity with depth, an increase of vertical inter-chamber spacing with depth, helical shafts with chambers emanating from the outside of the helix, superficial chambers modified from shafts, deeper chambers initiated with a circular outline, and an increase in shaft inclination with depth. Many architectural features are nest-size related, and change as the colony grows. These include the mean size and variation of chambers at any specified depth, the maximum depth of the nest, the number of vertical shafts and the complexity of chamber outlines. A few features do not vary with nest size: the percent of total chamber area as a function of percent of maximum depth (nest “shape”), shaft diameter (except in the top decile), chamber height and vertical separation of chambers in relation to depth. Altogether, these features give casts of P. badius nests an unmistakable, easily recognized appearance (Figs. 1 and 6{ label needed for fig[@id='i1536-2442-4-21-1-f602'] }{ label needed for fig[@id='i1536-2442-4-21-1-f603'] }).\n\nSeveral of these features are shared with the nests of other species. Like those of P. badius the nests of F. pallidefulva, Pheidole morrissi and Solenopsis invicta are top-heavy in the distribution of chamber area, and grow by adding shafts with chambers (Mikheyev and Tschinkel 2004; Tschinkel 2003). Superficial chambers that differ greatly in morphology from deeper chambers are also present in Prenolepis imparis (Tschinkel 2003). Vertical spacing between chambers typically increases with depth as well. However, although these features are probably common to many species, they are by no means universal as some species show no top-heaviness, multiple shafts or differences in chamber spacing.\n\nThe nest's architecture represents a considerable investment of energy and time, and provides shelter, microclimate choice, and defendability (Sudd and Franks 1987). In addition to these obvious services, nest architecture is likely also to be a mechanism for integrating the colony members into an efficient functioning whole, the superorganism. The large amounts of time and effort invested in nest construction surely must pay dividends in fitness, for this energy could have been invested in other fitness-enhancing functions instead. An as yet unmet challenge is to identify how particular features of the architecture serve particular colony functions, and how this service contributes to colony fitness. The towers built by several tropical termite species function as ventilation and heat-exchange structures, and are thus adaptive (Korb, 2003), but similar information on subterranean ant nests is not available. For ants, a reasonable first hypothesis is that the natural nest architecture organizes colony functions to make them (ultimately) more efficient in converting labor and resources into sexuals.\n\nThat the colony is organized within the nest is clear. The vertical migration of aging workers within the nest creates vertical social structure by worker age and life stage, and therefore creates a division of labor in space as well as by worker age (Tschinkel 1999a, b; Porter and Jorgesen 1988). The “ant hotel” experiment showed that this stratification is not an incidental outcome of upward drift, but is a product of active movement and choice by the workers. Sendova-Franks and Franks (1995) found analogous patterns in single-chamber laboratory colonies of Leptothorax unifasciatus. In this species, brood was kept in a central pile, each worker had a limited movement zone, and these zones formed partially overlapping sequences from the center of the nest to the periphery. The tasks performed by a worker depended upon the location of her movement zone. Most significantly, when the colony was transferred to a new nest, workers resumed the same positions they occupied in the previous nest (Sendova-Franks and Franks 1994), recreating the original social structure, much as harvester ant workers do when moving to a new nest. These observations imply that the social structure is functional, and not a meaningless epiphenomenon.\n\nNest architecture regulates a second attribute of social structure, group size, because chamber size sets an upper limit on the number of ants that can coexist in one group, a limit that is often approached in the lowest chambers of most P. badius nests, where practically all floor space is often covered with ants. Average group size in P. badius increases with depth. Averaged over the entire year, the mean number of brood per brood-containing chamber ranges from 20 to 40 in the top half of the nest to 60 to 110 in the bottom half. In parallel, the mean numbers of workers in these same chambers in the bottom half ranges from 90 to 130 for all workers, and 25 to 50 for callow workers. Although variation is large, it is clear that there are brackets around group size and worker/brood ratios.\n\nWhether the social structure generated by the nest architecture is functional or not has rarely been tested. Exceptions include the report by Brian (1956) that brood are reared more efficiently when they are dispersed among several smaller chambers, rather than grouped in a single large chamber of equal total area. Porter and Tschinkel (1985) showed that small, single-chamber laboratory nests of fire ant workers reared brood more efficiently than did large ones. These two studies imply that nest architecture, through subdivision of the worker force into efficient-sized rearing groups, may be linked to colony function in specific ways. In field colonies of fire ants, the average nest chamber contains about 200 workers and 100 brood (Cassill and Tschinkel 2002). Laboratory nests of this size are highly efficient. Whereas single-chamber laboratory nests become less and less efficient with increased size, field colonies do not (Tschinkel 1993). This difference begs for explanation, and nest architecture is a prime suspect.\n\nThe functional significance of the top-heaviness is mysterious. This large space seems under-used, typically harboring very low worker density. Perhaps this area is important for regulating brood development rate during the cooler months, for these chambers are exposed to the greatest diurnal variation in temperature. Alternately, a unit volume of upper chamber is cheaper to excavate than deeper ones because the soil is brought up over smaller vertical distances, but if this space is not heavily used, why create it? If top-heaviness is not functional, but merely a non-adaptive epiphenomenon of some other behavior, it is an expensive one. Whatever the functional reason, all ages of workers excavate nests that are top-heavy, although perhaps not to the same degree. Interestingly, Tschinkel (1987) noted that the upper chambers of P. imparis nests were also sparsely occupied.\n\nWhether the vertical age structure is functional has not been explicitly tested, although it seems intuitive that separating different tasks into different parts of the nest ought to increase colony efficiency, much as it increases the efficiency of a factory. The possible link between colony function and nest architecture needs to be tested in experimental nests of different architectures, and between single-chamber laboratory nests and natural nests.\n\nWhatever the functional meaning of vertical social structure, workers clearly have cues as to their own vertical location within the nest; colonies resume a similar vertical arrangement of workers, brood and seeds after moving to a new nest, and workers in the “ant hotel” experiment returned to the positions they had originally occupied in their home nest. A number of soil gradients might embody information on depth. Such factors as temperature and soil moisture probably vary too much on a daily, seasonal and weather basis to serve as a template for the highly regular patterns of worker and chamber distribution. In contrast, carbon dioxide gradients are probably the result of microbial and physical processes within the soil. Governed by the balance between microbial production and diffusion to the atmosphere, these gradients are probably rather stable. In harvester ant colonies, carbon dioxide concentration increases 5-fold with depth, providing ants with a strong depth cue that would allow them to arrange themselves as observed, and to expend excavation labor to produce the top-heavy nest as observed. The observed patterns would result if young workers preferred high concentrations of carbon dioxide and this preference declined with age, and if all ages of workers dug more under low carbon dioxide concentrations.\n\nAnts have been shown to respond to carbon dioxide concentration. Hangartner (1969) showed that fire ants (Solenopsis geminata) settle preferentially at higher concentrations of carbon dioxide, and dig in response to lower concentrations. Raffy (1929) measured carbon dioxide concentrations as high as 1–2% in ant nests. Attine ant nests, because of their huge worker populations, deep nests and metabolizing fungus gardens accumulate concentrations of carbon dioxide up to 5% (Kleineidam and Roces 2000). Atta vollenweideri can detect absolute carbon dioxide concentrations (Kleineidam and Tautz 1996), and provides its nest with turrets that create wind-induced nest ventilation (Kleineidam et al. 2001).\n\nAs a subject of behavioral study, nest architecture offers an appealing feature that practically no other behaviors offer; namely, the nest is a perfect record of the collective digging effort of a colony, and once cast, is ready for study. By studying a series of casts of increasing size, it is possible to describe the nest's growth and ontogeny, infer its species-typical characteristics, and bracket the range of variation. By doing this under different environments and soil types, possibly with transplanted colonies, it is possible to tease out the variation that the environment imposes on the architecture. The current study is only a small, initial step toward creating a field of nest architectural studies, whose ultimate goal is an understanding of how the nest emerges from self-organizing behavior, what functions it serves, how it varies within and between species, and how it evolves. In addition, these nest casts reveal something previously unseen. The study of nest architecture is thus a true exploration of a hidden world that holds unsuspected beauty, pattern and complexity."
