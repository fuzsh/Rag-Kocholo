        "text": "Habitats\n\nToday, we spent a fair amount of time investigating the pond with our morning class (and we walked again to the ant hill for the afternoon class). I also started examining the insects coming out of the Winkler eclector. We sifted rotting wood (mostly brown rot and red rot logs) yesterday. The device is shown below. Not as many species were found as expected. I did note the tent was rather warm. I fear that the sifted material dried out more quickly than anticipated.\n\nEven More Insect taxa encountered\n\nAs we explored the fields and woods, we continued to put together a list of insects we encountered. We were able to identify most to family level. I have organized these below (by order). This is an updated list (new families/ orders encountered today are marked with an asterisk). This list expands on the insects encountered on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.\n\nFor those who are curious about our running total. Over the course of four days, we have encountered:\n\n17 orders of insects (16 if you exclude Collembola)\n\n79 families of insects (78 if you exclude Collembola)\n\nAgain, most of these insects were captured by students in the Illinois Insects classes (both major [morning] and minor [afternoon] classes). Since they are just learning about insects this week, I find this to be a most impressive list so far.\n\nClass Entognatha – Subclass Collembola\n\nOrder Entomobryomorpha\n\nFamily Entomobryidae\n\nClass Insecta\n\nOrder Blattodea\n\nFamily Ectobiidae (wood cockroach)\n\nOrder Coleoptera\n\nFamily Buprestidae\n\nFamily Cantharidae (soldier beetles)\n\nFamily Carabidae (ground beetles and tiger beetles)\n\nFamily Cerambycidae (long horn beetles)\n\nTetraopes tetraopthalamus [milkweed beetle]\n\nFamily Chrysomelidae (leaf beetles)\n\nFamily Cleridae (checkered beetles) *\n\nFamily Coccinellidae (lady beetles)\n\nFamily Curculionidae (weevils)\n\nFamily Dytiscidae (predaceous diving beetles)\n\nFamily Elateridae (click beetles)\n\nFamily Gyrinidae (whirligig beetles)\n\nFamily Haliplidae (crawling water beetles)\n\nFamily Lampyridae (fireflies)\n\nFamily Scarabaeidae (scarab beetles)\n\nPopillia japonica [Japanese beetle]\n\nFamily Silphidae\n\nOrder Dermaptera\n\nFamily Forficulidae (earwigs)\n\nOrder Diptera\n\nFamily Asilidae (robber flies)\n\nFamily Bombyliidae (bee flies)\n\nFamily Culicidae (mosquitoes)\n\nFamily Dolicopodidae (long legged flies)\n\nFamily Muscidae (house flies)\n\nFamily Mycropezidae (stilt-legged flies) *\n\nFamily Rhagionidae\n\nFamily Tabanidae (horse flies)\n\nFamily Tachinidae *\n\nFamily Tephritidae\n\nEurosta solidaginis (goldenrod gall fly)\n\nFamily Tipulidae (crane flies)\n\nOrder Ephemeroptera\n\nFamily Ephemeridae\n\nOrder Hemiptera\n\nFamily Aradidae (flat bugs) *\n\nFamily Belostomatidae (giant water bugs)\n\nFamily Cercopidae (spittle bugs)\n\nFamily Cicadellidae (leaf hoppers)\n\nFamily Coreidae (leaf-footed bugs)\n\nFamily Corixidae (water boatmen)\n\nFamily Gelastocoridae (toad bugs)\n\nFamily Gerridae (water striders) *\n\nFamily Membracidae (tree hoppers)\n\nFamily Myridae (plant bugs)\n\nFamily Naucoridae (creeping water bugs)\n\nFamily Nabidae (damsel bugs)\n\nFamily Nepidae (water scorpions) *\n\nFamily Reduviidae (assassin bugs)\n\nFamily Scutelleridae (shield-backed bugs)\n\nFamily Tingidae (lace bugs)\n\nFamily Veliidae (riffle bugs)\n\nOrder Hymenoptera\n\nFamily Apidae (bumble bees and honey bees)\n\nFamily Bethylidae\n\nFamily Braconidae *\n\nFamily Evaniidae (ensign wasps) *\n\nFamily Formicidae (ants)\n\nFormica pallidefulva\n\nFormica exsectoides\n\nLasius neoniger\n\nLeptothorax curvispinosus\n\nMonomorium minimum\n\nMyrmecina americana\n\nPonera pennsylvanica\n\nStrumigenys sp.\n\nFamily Ichneumonidae *\n\nFamily Sphecidae (thread waisted wasps) *\n\nFamily Tenthredinidae (sawflies)\n\nFamily Vespidae (potter wasps and others)\n\nOrder Lepidoptera\n\nFamily Erebidae\n\nHaploa confusa\n\nFamily Geometridae (geometer moths)\n\nFamily Lycaenidae [blues]\n\nFamily Nymphalide\n\nAsterocampa celtis [hackberry emperor butterfly]\n\nCheckerspot butterfly\n\nSpeyeria cybele [great spangled fritillary]\n\nFamily Papilionidae (swallowtails)\n\nFamily Pieridae (sulphurs and whites)\n\nFamily Pterophoridae (plume moths) *\n\nFamily Pyralidae\n\nFamily Satyridae (wood nymphs)\n\nFamily Tortricidae *\n\nOrder Mantodea\n\nFamily Mantidae\n\nTenodera sinensis [Chinese mantis nymphs]\n\nOrder Mecoptera\n\nFamily Panorpidae (scorpion-flies)\n\nOrder Neuroptera\n\nFamily Chrysopidae (green lacewings)\n\nOrder Odonata\n\nFamily Aeschnidae (darners)\n\nFamily Coenagrionidae (damselflies)\n\nFamily Libellulidae (skimmer dragonflies)\n\nOrder Orthoptera\n\nFamily Acrididae (band-wing grasshoppers)\n\nFamily Gryllidae\n\nPhyllopalpus pulchellus [handsome trig]\n\nFamily Rhaphidophoridae (cave crickets)\n\nFamily Tettigoniidae (katydids)\n\nFamily Tridactylidae (pygmy mole crickets)\n\nOrder Phasmatodea\n\nFamily Diapheromeridae\n\nDiapheromera femorata (common walkingstick)\n\nOrder Plectoptera *\n\nFamily Nemouridae (spring stoneflies) *\n\nOrder Thysanoptera\n\nFamily Thripidae (thrips)\n\nOther Arthorpods\n\nDiplopoda (millipedes) *\n\nIsopods\n\nGeophilomorph centipede\n\nScolopendromorph centipede\n\nSpiders (mostly wolf spiders and relatives and Salticidae)\n\nGeolycosa wrighti was the large brown spider we found in the afternoon)\n\nWe covered a lot of ground today as well.
