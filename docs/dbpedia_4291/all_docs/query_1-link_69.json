        "text": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\nThis application is a continuation application of U.S. application Ser. No. 15/727,617, filed Oct. 8, 2017, which is a continuation application of U.S. application Ser. No. 14/891,238, filed Nov. 13, 2015, which is a national stage application of International Application No. PCT/US2014/038652 filed May 19, 2014, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/824,689 filed May 17, 2013, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\nFIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE\n\nThe present disclosure relates generally to methods for the control of arthropods, including insects and arachnids. In certain aspects, photocatalytic processes may be utilized to form near-ideal gas phase hydrogen peroxide for use in the methods described herein.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs described herein, in certain aspects of the disclosure, hydrogen peroxide may be produced as a near-ideal gas phase, purified hydrogen peroxide gas (PHPG). In this form hydrogen peroxide behaves, in all respects, as a near-ideal gas and is not hydrated, or otherwise combined with water when produced.\n\nThe fundamental nature of a photocatalytic process is to create active intermediates in a chemical reaction by absorption of light. This occurs when a photon of the appropriate wavelength strikes the photocatalyst. The energy of the photon is imparted to a valence band electron, promoting the electron to the conduction band, thus leaving a “hole” in the valence band. In the absence of an adsorbed chemical species, the promoted electron will decay and recombine with the valence band hole. Recombination is prevented when the valence band hole captures an electron from an oxidizable species—preferentially molecular water—adsorbed to an active surface site on the photocatalyst. Concurrently, a reducible species adsorbed on the catalyst surface—preferentially molecular oxygen—may capture a conduction band electron.\n\nUpon initiation of the photocatalytic process, or at the entrance point of a photocatalytic plasma reactor, the following reactions occur.\n\nOxidation\n\n2 photons+2H2O→2OH*+2H++2e−\n\n2OH*→H2O2\n\nReduction\n\nO2±2H++2e→H2O2\n\nOnce hydrogen peroxide has been produced, however, the photocatalyst preferentially reduces hydrogen peroxide (reduction potential 0.71 eV) instead of molecular oxygen (reduction potential −0.13 eV), and the reaction shifts to the following equilibrium which takes place within the majority of the plasma reactor volume.\n\nOxidation\n\n2 photons+2H2O→2OH*+2H++2e−\n\n2OH*→H2O2\n\nReduction\n\nH2O2+2H++2e→2H2O\n\nIn the context of the present disclosure, near-ideal gas Purified Hydrogen Peroxide Gas (PHPG) may be produced using a photocatalytic process with a purpose-designed morphology that enables the removal of near-ideal gas phase hydrogen peroxide from the PHPG reactor before it is forced to undergo subsequent reduction by the photocatalyst. Denied ready availability of adsorbed hydrogen peroxide gas, the photocatalyst is then forced to preferentially reduce oxygen, rather than hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide gas may then generally be produced simultaneously by both the oxidation of water and the reduction of dioxygen in the photocatalytic process. Without intending to be limited, in operation the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced may be doubled, then removed from the system before the vast majority of it can be reduced—thereby resulting in an output of near-ideal gas PHPG that is thousands of times greater than the incidental output of unpurified hydrogen peroxide from an equal number of active catalyst sites within a photocatalytic plasma reactor under the same conditions. This purpose-designed morphology also enables the production of near-ideal gas PHPG at absolute humidities well below those at which a photocatalytic plasma reactor can effectively operate. For example, near-ideal gas PHPG outputs greater than 5.0 ppm have been achieved at an absolute humidity of 2.5 milligrams per Liter. In the purpose-designed morphology the dominant reactions become:\n\nOxidation\n\n2 photons+2H2O→2OH*+2H++2e−\n\n2OH*→H2O2\n\nReduction\n\nO2±2H++2e−→H2O2\n\nHowever, without being limited by theory, it should be noted that methods and devices of the present disclosure are not achieved as a result of the photocatalytic process, but by the effects of near-ideal gas PHPG once it is released into the environment.\n\nUsing morphology that permits immediate removal of hydrogen peroxide gas before it can be reduced, near-ideal gas PHPG may be generated in any suitable manner known in the art, including but not limited to, any suitable process known in the art that simultaneously oxidizes water in gas form and reduces oxygen gas, including gas phase photo-catalysis, e.g., using a metal catalyst such as titanium dioxide, zirconium oxide, titanium dioxide doped with cocatalysts (such as copper, rhodium, silver, platinum, gold, etc.), or other suitable metal oxide photocatalysts. Near-ideal gas PHPG may also be produced by electrolytic processes using anodes and cathodes made from any suitable metal, or constructed from metal oxide ceramics using morphology that permits immediate removal of hydrogen peroxide gas before it can be reduced. Alternatively, near-ideal gas PHPG may be produced by high frequency excitation of gaseous water and oxygen molecules on a suitable supporting substrate using morphology that permits immediate removal of hydrogen peroxide gas before it can be reduced.\n\nAs a near-ideal gas, hydrogen peroxide is not appreciably lighter than or heavier than air, having a molar mass of 34.0148 grams per mole. Near-ideal gas phase hydrogen peroxide diffuses through air as any other near-ideal gas would, and passes through air-permeable materials, unhindered by the surface tension of water as is seen in the behavior of micro-droplets comprising aqueous phase vapor forms of hydrogen peroxide often referred to as gaseous.\n\nIn this form, near-ideal gas phase hydrogen peroxide can penetrate to any space that can be reached by air itself. This includes all areas in which arachnids and insects are present in a room, such as crevices between materials, inside air-permeable cushions and in air-permeable bedding.\n\nContinuously produced via a PHPG diffuser device, as discussed herein, an equilibrium concentration above 0.04 parts per million of near-ideal gas phase hydrogen peroxide may be achieved and maintained continuously in an environment. At equilibrium at one atmosphere pressure and 19.51 degrees Celsius, near-ideal gas phase hydrogen peroxide will be present in every cubic micron of air at an average amount of one molecule per cubic micron for each 0.04 parts per million of concentration. At one part per million, the average number of hydrogen peroxide molecules per cubic micron will be 25, and at 3.2 parts per million it will be 80.\n\nNot to be limited by theory, near-ideal gas phase hydrogen peroxide will be “inhaled” or processed by arthropods including but not limited to arachnids and insects along with air, causing damage to sensitive tissues and either killing the arthropod or resulting in changes in behavior. In the case of arachnids, near-ideal gas phase hydrogen peroxide passes through tracheal tubes and body apertures to reach sensitive tissues and the book lungs of arachnids. The result of continuous exposure to near-ideal gas phase hydrogen peroxide at even low concentrations is damage to the tissues used in air exchange, and the death of the arachnid. Most arthropods, including insects do not have lungs, but survive solely by distributing oxygen through the body by means of a network of tracheal tubes. By this means near-ideal gas phase hydrogen peroxide reaches every portion of an arthropod's body and causes death to the arthropod, such as an insect. Not to be limited by theory the near-ideal gas phase hydrogen peroxide damages their air exchange tissues.\n\nBy contrast, humans and other vertebrates have respiratory mechanisms that protect them from equivalent concentrations of near-ideal gas phase hydrogen peroxide. Human lungs produce hydrogen peroxide at high rates and a cubic micron of human lung secretion contains an equilibrium concentration of between 600 molecules, and 60,000 molecules of hydrogen peroxide in aqueous phase, along with enzymes that consume hydrogen peroxide and regulate its concentration. Enzymes such as lactoperoxidase and catalase which perform this function are known to have enzymatic velocities of thousands of molecular reactions per second.\n\nIn one aspect of the present disclosure, a method of controlling an arthropods, such as insects or arachnids, in an environment is disclosed. In certain aspects, the arthropods are part of a population or a plurality of populations. In certain aspects, an arthropod, insect, or arachnid population is totally or partially killed. The method generally comprises (a) generating a near-ideal gas comprised of Purified Hydrogen Peroxide Gas (PHPG) that is substantially free of, e.g., hydration (i.e., non-hydrated, in the form of water in solution or water molecules bonded by covalence, van der Waals forces, or London forces), ozone, plasma species, and/or organic species; and (b) directing the gas comprised of PHPG into the environment such that the PHPG controls arthropod, insect, or arachnid populations in the environment.\n\nAs used herein, the term “Purified Hydrogen Peroxide Gas” or PHPG generally means a gas form of hydrogen peroxide that is substantially free of at least hydration (in the form of water in solution or water molecules bonded by covalence, van der Waals forces, or London forces) and substantially free of ozone.\n\nIn accordance with the present disclosure, the terms “substantial absence of ozone” “substantially free of ozone”, etc., generally mean amounts of ozone below about 0.015 ppm, down to levels below the LOD (level of detection) for ozone. Such levels are below the generally accepted limits for human health. In this regard, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires ozone output of indoor medical devices to be no more than 0.05 ppm of ozone. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires that workers not be exposed to an average concentration of more than 0.10 ppm of ozone for 8 hours. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends an upper limit of 0.10 ppm of ozone, not to be exceeded at any time. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone is a maximum 8 hour average outdoor concentration of 0.08 ppm. The diffuser devices described herein have consistently demonstrated that they do not produce ozone at levels detectable by means of a Draeger Tube.\n\nIn certain aspects, the method comprises (a) exposing a metal, or metal oxide, catalyst to ultraviolet light in the presence of humid purified ambient air under conditions so as to form near-ideal gas Purified Hydrogen Peroxide Gas (PHPG) that is substantially free of at least one of hydration (in the form of water in solution or water molecules bonded by covalence, van der Waals forces, or London forces), ozone, plasma species, and organic species; and (b) directing the PHPG into the environment such that the PHPG controls arthropods in the environment.\n\nIn one aspect, the ultraviolet light produces at least one wavelength in a range above about 181 nm, above about 185 nm, above about 187 nm, between about 182 nm and about 254 nm, between about 187 nm and about 250 nm, between about 188 nm and about 249 nm, between about 255 nm and about 380 nm, etc. In certain aspects, wavelengths between about 255 nm and 380 nm may be preferred to improve yields of PHPG.\n\nIn certain aspects, the amount of PHPG may vary from about 0.005 ppm to about 5.0 ppm, more particularly, from about 0.02 ppm to about 1.5 ppm, in the environment. In certain aspects, the amount of PHPG may vary from about 0.5 ppm to about 1.5 ppm. PHPG levels of 1.5 ppm using a feed of untreated air containing absolute humidity as low as 3.5 mg/L can consistently be achieved. More particularly, PHPG levels from about 0.09 ppm to about 5.0 ppm using humid re-circulated air, can be produced in the environment to be treated. Also provided for an included are methods of treating arthropod population comprising providing PHPG gas at between 0.4 to 1.0 ppm. In another aspect, PHPG may be provided at between 0.5 to 1.5 ppm for the control of arthropods. In certain embodiments, the level of PHPG is maintained at 1.0 ppm or less.\n\nIn certain aspects of the present disclosure, the humidity of the ambient air is preferably above about 1% relative humidity (RH), above about 5% RH, above about 10% RH, etc. In certain aspects, the humidity of the ambient air may be between about 10% and about 99% RH. In one aspect, the method of the present disclosure includes regulating the humidity of the ambient air within the range of about 5% to about 99% RH, or about 10 to about 99% RH.\n\nA suitable diffuser device may be used to generate the near-ideal gas PHPG, such as those disclosed in WO/2009/021108 or WO/2010/093796, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. The diffuser design may optimize near-ideal gas PHPG production by spreading the air permeable photocatalytic PHPG reactor surface thinly over a large area that is perpendicular to air flow (e.g., in certain aspects, over a sail-like area), rather than by compacting it into a volume-optimizing morphology designed to maximize residence time within the plasma reactor.\n\nFor example, by configuring the PHPG reactor morphology as a thin, sail-like air-permeable structure, just inside the diffuser's interior shell, the exit path length for hydrogen peroxide molecules produced on the catalyst becomes diminishingly short, and their residence time within the PHPG reactor structure is reduced to a fraction of a second, preventing the vast majority of hydrogen peroxide molecules from being subsequently adsorbed onto the catalyst and reduced back into water. Also, by placing the catalyst substrate just inside the interior surface of the diffuser shell, not only is PHPG reactor surface area maximized, but the near-ideal gas PHPG produced also passes out of the diffuser almost immediately and thus avoids photolysis from prolonged exposure to the UV light source. By means of this morphology, near-ideal gas PHPG output concentrations as high as 0.40 ppm may be achieved.\n\nGenerally, the present disclosure has been described in specific aspects with some degree of particularity, it is to be understood that this description has been given only by way of example and that numerous changes in the details of construction, fabrication and use, including the combination and arrangement of parts, may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure as shown in the following example aspects.\n\nIn previous disclosures, obstacles in the field to produce highly concentrated non-hydrated Purified Hydrogen Peroxide Gas, are overcome and the production of PHPG has many applications in domestic, industrial, and agricultural arenas. While conducting studies on the performance and PHPG output of a PHPG producing apparatus and its activity on molds, bacteria and viruses, the surprising and unexpected observation that near-ideal gas phase hydrogen peroxide can be used to kill, partially kill, or modify the behavior of most species of arthropods including insects and arachnids, among others. Without being limited by a particular theory, the surprising effects of PHPG gas on the behavior of many species of insects and arachnids may be due at least in part because many species of arthropods appear to have limited or no natural protection against hydrogen peroxide gas.\n\nSurprisingly, the inventors also discovered that non-hydrated hydrogen peroxide gas acts as a repellant against arthropods including arachnids, flying insects, and crawling insects, causing them to flee an area protected by the hydrogen peroxide gas and preventing them from entering the area. Further, the inventors found that hydrogen peroxide gas causes many species of arthropods that are unable to flee a PHPG enriched area to become inactive and die over a period of time ranging from hours to days. The inventors also observed that hydrogen peroxide gas can interrupt the life cycle of many species of arthropods, even causing pupae, larvae, and nits to die. Based on these findings, the application of PHPG gas to arthropod control has a wide range of beneficial uses in the domestic, industrial and agricultural industries.\n\nIn addition to the broad effectiveness of PHPG for the control of arthropods, PHPG, used at concentrations below a few parts per million, acts as a “green” pesticide which breaks down into water and oxygen in the environment, leaving no toxic residue, and is not harmful to humans, pets, or plants.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe present disclosure provides for, and includes, a method for controlling an arthropod in an environment comprising providing Purified Hydrogen Peroxide Gas (PHPG) to an environment to prepare a PHPG containing environment having PHPG gas at a final concentration of at least 0.05 parts per million and maintaining the PHPG containing environment for a time period sufficient to control an arthropod.\n\nThe present disclosure further provides for, and includes, a method of treating an animal for an arthropod parasite comprising placing an animal in a PHPG containing environment for a period of time.\n\nThe present disclosure further provides for, and includes, a method for controlling at least one insect or arachnid population in an environment, the comprising: (a) generating a gas comprising near-ideal gas Purified Hydrogen Peroxide Gas (PHPG) that is substantially non-hydrated and substantially free of ozone, plasma species, and optionally organic species; (b) directing the PHPG into the environment such that the hydrogen peroxide gas acts to control at least one insect or arachnid population in the environment.\n\nIn another aspect, the present disclosure provides for, and includes, a method of termite control comprising treating a termite infested house with PHPG.\n\nIn a further aspect, the present disclosure provides for, and includes, a method of controlling arthropods in a greenhouse comprising providing PHPG to a green house.\n\nIn an aspect, the present disclosure further provides for, and includes, a method of treating a houseplant for the control of an arthropod comprising placing an arthropod infested plant in a PHPG containing environment.\n\nIn another aspect, the present disclosure provides for a method for controlling an arthropod in an agricultural product during shipping comprising: providing Purified Hydrogen Peroxide Gas (PHPG) at a concentration of at least 0.05 parts per million to a shipping container containing agricultural produce to prepare a PHPG containing shipping container; shipping the PHPG containing shipping container; and maintaining the PHPG concentration during the shipping, wherein the arthropod is controlled.\n\nIn an aspect, the present disclosure provides for and includes a method for controlling an arthropod in a food processing facility comprising providing Purified Hydrogen Peroxide Gas (PHPG) at a concentration of at least 0.05 parts per million to a food processing facility.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\nUnless defined otherwise, technical and scientific terms as used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. One skilled in the art will recognize many methods can be used in the practice of the present disclosure. Indeed, the present disclosure is in no way limited to the methods and materials described. Any references cited herein are incorporated by reference in their entireties. For purposes of the present disclosure, the following terms are defined below.\n\nAs used herein, “a reduction” of a population of arthropods such as an insect population or arachnid population in an environment having PHPG means that the level is reduced relative to the numbers of organisms of a population in an environment lacking PHPG. In some aspects, a reduction may occur due to the death or incapacitation of an arthropod population or due to the exit of members of the population from the PHPG containing environment.\n\nAs used herein, the term “at least a partial reduction” of a population of arthropods such as an insect population or arachnid population in an environment having PHPG means that the level is reduced by at least 25% relative to the numbers of organisms of a population in an environment lacking PHPG. Also as used herein, it is understood that in environments having multiple populations of arthropods, each population may be “partially reduced” independently.\n\nAs used herein, the term “a substantial reduction” of a population of arthropods such as an insect population or arachnid population in an environment having PHPG means that the level is reduced by at least 75% relative to the numbers of organisms of a population in an environment lacking PHPG. Also as used herein, it is understood that in environments having multiple populations of arthropods, each population may be “substantially reduced” independently.\n\nAs used herein, the term “an effective elimination” of a population of arthropods such as an insect population or arachnid population in an environment having PHPG means that the level is reduced by greater than 95% relative to the numbers of organisms of a population in an environment lacking PHPG. Also as used herein, it is understood that in environments having multiple populations of arthropods, each population may be “effectively eliminated” independently. An effective amount of PHPG is preferably capable of providing at least a partial reduction, more preferably a substantial reduction, or most preferably effective elimination of an arthropod population.\n\nAs used herein, the terms “suppress,” “repress,” and “downregulate” when referring to a population of arthropods used equivalently herein and mean that the levels of a population of arthropods are reduced relative to the number of arthropods in a population that would occur in the absence of PHPG under similar or identical conditions.\n\nAs used herein, the terms “control,” “controls,” or “controlling” a population of arthropods by providing PHPG to the arthropod for a period of time refers to either the killing of the arthropod, induction of a behavioral change in the arthropod, or both, that results in reduction of the population of the arthropod in the PHPG environment relative to an untreated environment. As provided in detail below, different arthropod populations are controlled at different levels of PHPG and may require different periods of exposure to the PHPG environment to accomplish desired levels of reduction.\n\nAs used herein, the singular form “a,” “an” and “the” include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. For example, the term “an arthropod” or “at least one arthropod” may include a plurality of arthropods, including mixtures thereof. Also as used herein, an arthropod includes and provides for a population of arthropods. As used herein, a population of arthropods may further include a mixed population of arthropods.\n\nThe present disclosure provides for an includes method for controlling an arthropod by providing PHPG to the arthropod for a period of time. An arthropod may be controlled in a variety of ways including by killing the arthropod at one or more stages of development or as an adult. In certain aspects, providing PHPG to an environment leads to the death of the arthropod after a period of time. In an aspect, providing PHPG gas provides for the death of a nymph stage of an arthropod. In an aspect, PHPG gas causes the death of an arthropod egg such that larvae never hatch. In an aspect, PHPG acts on adult stages of an arthropod. In some aspects, providing PHPG is an effective arthropodicide against all developmental stages of an arthropod species. As provided below, both the length of time necessary to kill the arthropod and the amount of PHGP necessary to kill the arthropod may vary depending on the species of the arthropod.\n\nThe present disclosure also includes and provides for methods of control which disrupt the behavior of the arthropod. In some aspects, the methods of control provide for both the disruption of arthropod behavior and provide arthropodicidal effects. In some aspects, after initial exposure to a concentration of PHPG, the arthropod ceases all activity and becomes immobile and dormant. In other aspects, exposure to a concentration of PHPG leads to enhanced activity of the arthropod. In certain aspects, the activity of flying arthropods greatly increases and can be characterized by high agitation and frantic activity. In aspects according to the present disclosure, control of an arthropod after exposure to PHPG includes disruption of normal mating behavior. Other behavioral changes observed in arthropods exposed to PHPG containing environments includes disorientation. In an aspect, the present methods included inducing disorientation in an arthropod species. In some aspects, disorientation leads to a loss of feeding behavior. In other aspects, disorientation leads to a loss of mating behavior.\n\nIn certain aspects according to the present disclosure, changes in behavior caused by exposure to PHPG may also be accompanied by physical signs of distress of the arthropod. In some aspects, physical signs of distress include regurgitation of recent meals. In another aspect, the arthropod may prematurely lay eggs. In certain aspects, the prematurely laid eggs may be fertilized eggs. In other aspects, the prematurely laid eggs may be un-fertilized. In aspects according the present disclosure, exposure to PHPG gas results in the death of the prematurely laid eggs.\n\nAlso provided and included in the present disclosure are methods of controlling larval forms of an arthropod. In certain aspects, providing a PHPG leads to the premature hatching of an immature egg. In an aspect, methods to control an arthropod lead to the death of larval forms of an arthropod. In some aspects, larval forms are more sensitive to exposure to PHPG than adult or nymph forms. Thus, in some aspects lower levels of PHPG may control immature forms of arthropods where the adult form is significantly less affected. In some aspects, PHPG is provided to a larval form to inhibit the metamorphosis of the larva. In an aspect, PHPG may be provided at sufficient levels to act as a larvacide. The present disclosure further provides for and includes methods of killing nymph forms of arthropods.\n\nFor many arthropods, exposure to PHPG leads to significant changes in behavior and PHPG acts as a very strong repellent. In some aspects, exposure to PHPG leads arthropods to search for an exit from the PHPG containing environment. In an aspect where the arthropod is unable to escape, the arthropod locates to a source of fresh (non-PHPG containing) air and attempts to survive. In household or non-experimental setting, such arthropods would exit the domicile or environment. Similarly, arthropods are repelled from entering environments that have even very low concentrations of PHPG. Thus the present disclosure provides for methods of controlling an arthropod by providing a PHPG containing environment and repelling insects, thereby blocking their entry.\n\nIn aspects according to the present disclosure, PHPG levels may be provided in excess over the amount necessary to kill a arthropod species. In such aspects,\n\nThe control methods of the present disclosure are effective against almost every arthropod tested including examples from multiple phylogenetic orders and classes. The few arthropods that appear to be resistant to PHPG levels up to 0.6 ppm for 24 hours included adult cockroaches and tarantula spiders. PHPG is lethal to most species. Determining whether any specific species of arthropod is resistant or susceptible can be easily performed using the methods described below and known to one of skill in the art.\n\nCertain arthropods are more susceptible to the methods of the present disclosure. Not to be limited by theory, flying insects, such as Diptera, are generally most susceptible due to high activity and rapid pumping of air containing hydrogen peroxide through their tracheal tubes. Accordingly, methods to control flying insects require lower levels of PHPG gas and are particularly suited to methods of control wherein the arthropod is repelled from the PHPG containing environment.\n\nWith respect to arachnids, those species having ‘book lungs’ are generally more susceptible than the tracheal tube systems of crawling insects. The present disclosure provides for and includes methods of controlling book lung containing arthropods including arachnids and scorpions.\n\nIn some aspects, larger arthropods appear to be more resistant to the killing effects of a PHPG environment.

Conversely, various features of the invention, which are, for brevity, described in the context of a single embodiment, may also be provided separately or in any suitable subcombination or as suitable in any other described embodiment of the invention. Certain features described in the context of various embodiments are not to be considered essential features of those embodiments, unless the embodiment is inoperative without those elements. For example, methods of using PHPG gas to kill arthropods are also effective at repelling arthropods. Thus, following the initial killing of an arthropod, continued use of PHPG prevents the reinfestation.\n\nVarious embodiments and aspects of the present invention as delineated hereinabove and as claimed in the claims section below find experimental support in the following Examples. The following Examples are presented for the purposes of illustration and should not be construed as limitations.\n\nAlthough the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims.\n\nAll publications, patents and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated in their entirety by reference into the specification, to the same extent as if each individual publication, patent or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated herein by reference. In addition, citation or identification of any reference in this application shall not be construed as an admission that such reference is available as prior art to the present invention. To the extent that section headings are used, they should not be construed as necessarily limiting.\n\nEXAMPLES Example 1: Generation and Measurement of PHPG\n\nAll PHPG concentration readings take place with Draeger products. A Pac III, Polytron 7000 or Draeger Tubes are utilized in all tests, generally according to manufacturer's instructions. The Polytron displays a digital reading when air is drawn through the mesh sensor. Most commonly, Draeger Tubes are used after clipping on both ends and placement in a ACCURO™ Pump. Per manufacturer instructions, the tubes are pumped 100 times and the level of PHPG determined by observing the color change in the crystals. The PAC III has proved to be generally less effective in measuring very low levels of PHPG.\n\nExample 2: Laboratory Testing of PHPG for the Control of Arthropod Species\n\nThe effects of Purified Hydrogen Peroxide Gas (PHPG) on selected arthropod species is performed to determine the efficacy on controlling an arthropod using the indirect dispersion of PHPG in a space. In these experiments, the knockdown and mortality rates in mosquitoes, bed bugs, termites, ants, moths, house flies, and spiders is assessed.\n\nBlack wood ants, house flies (adult and pupae), large saturniid moths, termites (soldier and living), and cellar spiders are obtained from Carolina Supplies and shipped overnight. All organisms are fed prior to shipping from Carolina Supplies. Bed bugs and mosquitoes are sourced locally due to government shipping restrictions. The test samples are stored in a cabinet at ambient temperature and humidity until use in the study. The samples are labeled and color-coded for easy identification. In certain experiments, specimens of wild caught arthropods are used in the controlled experiments, including for example Brazilian cockroaches.\n\nAll testing is conducted in a sealed, Static Dissipative PVC chamber, Terra Universal (Fullerton, Calif.) Model 3305-10F: 59 inches W×24 inches D×25 inches H. With additional airlock Terra Universal Model 1680-81B 11.5 inches W×10 inches D×10.5 inches H. Arthropods are placed inside transfer containers (pint size paper containers). The top and bottom diameters of these containers are 3.75 and 2.87 inches respectively with a height of 3.5 inches. All arthropods are released once the airlock is sealed. Arthropods are allowed to recover following PHPG exposure and observed in 8 oz glass Pyrex® (Tewksbury, Mass.) containers with sealed glass lids.\n\nThree replicates of ten of each arthropod are subjected to PHPG. An additional three replicates are subjected to a non PHPG producing device and serve as untreated controls. The arthropods are observed for knockdown at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 15 minutes. Mortality counts are taken after 24 hours of PHPG exposure. If at 24 hours mortality is less 90%, additional readings are taken following 48 hours of PHPG exposure. The test samples are exposed to the test environment containing PHPG until a 90% knockdown is achieved. The test samples are provided PHPG emitted from a PHPG producing device in the center of the test chamber. Time frames are recorded for each replicate. Just prior to treatment the arthropods are transferred into the transfer containers. Forty eight hours after treatment, they are removed from the treatment chamber and transferred to recovery containers and covered with screened lids for observation.\n\nAfter treatment, the arthropods are observed for knockdown and mortality at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 15, 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 24, and 48 hours. Knockdown occurs when an arthropod cannot right itself when placed on its back but is still able to move at least one body part. The arthropods are then transferred from the treatment chamber to recovery containers. Another knockdown/mortality observation is made 15 minutes later.\n\nIf all ten arthropods are recorded as knocked down or deceased during any observation before 15 minutes have elapsed, subsequent observations are not made. Mortality counts are made at 24 hours, and 48 hours or sooner (if applicable). All dead arthropods are confirmed by probing or agitation to make sure that they are unable to move (any that show movement visible to the naked eye are recorded as moribund). Arthropods that can crawl or right themselves when placed on their backs are recorded as being alive.\n\nAfter the knockdown counts are complete, the arthropods are maintained in the laboratory at ambient temperature and humidity conditions with a normal 8:16 light:dark cycle for 24 hours. Additional mortality readings are taken at 48 hours if less than 90% mortality is recorded at 24 hours. A 48 hour reading depends upon control mortality remaining less than 10%. Temperature and humidity are recorded in the treatment area, and in the laboratory where the arthropods are subsequently held for the duration of the test. The number of dead arthropods per replicate are added together for a total mortality count. Abbott's Formula is used to correct for any mortality among the controls. The results are presented in Table 1.\n\nTABLE 1 Effect of PHPG on Arthropod Species in Laboratory Tests Attempt Organism PHPG Level Exposure Time to Flee?

Prior to testing, the primary function was for storage and the very occasional guest. Window seals were cracked and therefore air leakage throughout the space was increased. Initially there was some mold present on the wall with an “in window” air conditioning unit. Prior to the initiation of testing, the space itself was cleared out and swept clean. No chemicals or cleaners were used at any time in this space for weeks prior to testing. There was no cleaning or dusting of the exposed rafters, kitchen cabinets, drawers, closets or the HVAC system that was not operational for years. A space heater was included to maintain the temperature above 60 degrees ° F. Two 14″×12″ by 12″ PHPG generating devices comprising a filters, fan, bulb, and a PHPG generating sail (See, U.S. Pat. No. 8,168,122, U.S. Pat. No. 8,685,329, and U.S. Patent Application No. 61/988,535). Two PHPG generating devices were placed in the space for an initial cleansing and to establish levels. After 27 hours, 109 arthropods were confirmed dead including crickets, ants, spiders, and house flies. The majority of the kills happened around the outer walls of the space with limited kills in the interior portions of the space. Observed concentration of PHPG, measured as provided in Example 1, at 27 hours was 0.4 ppm. No live insects were observed.\n\nThe effects of PHPG treatment of human lice was observed. After installing a PHPG generating device, the child subject reported the end of itching within one hour. All signs of lice were eliminated and lice free within two days of the initiation of treatment.\n\nAdditional observations of the effects of PHPG treatment of arthropod species was observed during the development of PHPG generating devices for the control of molds, bacteria, and viruses. The results and observations of these species is presented in Table 2"
