leaf of Portugal section (Myrtaceae) extract, belong at least a extract in the colony that the extract of the whole strain grass of plant of Primulaceae (Primulaceae) forms.In the following embodiment, as these typical example, use mixed extractant solvent thing, the whole strain grass of Tropaeolaceae nasturtium (Tropaaeolaceae Tropaeolum majus) plant of the whole strain grass of Pirolaceae Pylora rotundolia (Pyrolaceae Pyrola rotundifolia) plant the mixed extractant solvent thing, in the mixed extractant solvent thing, the mixed extractant solvent thing of the whole strain grass of Primulaceae Spiked Loosestrife (Primulaceae Lysimachiasikokiana) plant of eucalyptus (Myrtaceae Eucalyptusglobulus) branches and leaves of homemade Portugal section plant.\n\nBecome the Pirolaceae Pylora rotundolia and the Tropaeolaceae nasturtium of raw material, do not produce in Japan.But, for example can use and produce Pirolaceae Pylora rotundolia and the Tropaeolaceae nasturtium of locating in Chinese yunnan province etc.The Pirolaceae Pylora rotundolia is that height is the perennial evergreen herbaceous plant of 20ï½30cm, and be 5ï½June flowering period, and fruiting period is 9ï½October.Be grown in the following or day cloudy moist place of tree of mountain forest.Above-mentioned herbaceous plant generally is grown in Tibet, Yunnan, Guizhou.The root of whole strain grass is all dug out, get rid of earth, shine to the vanes retract deliquescing.The two sides that is accumulated to the heating blade becomes red-purple or puce, dries once more.Later embodiment uses this raw material as the whole strain grass of Pylora rotundolia plant.\n\nThe Tropaeolaceae nasturtium, the root that also will put in order the strain grass all digs out, wash silt off after, will put in order the strain grass and under the sun, dry.Later embodiment uses this raw material as the whole strain grass of nasturtium plant.\n\nIn homemade Portugal section eucalyptus, win the branches and leaves of plant, dry in the shade.Later embodiment uses this raw material as the eucalyptus branches and leaves.\n\nPrimulaceae Chinese sorghum grass, time early summer of circular fruit maturation is taked stock in the axil of plant, behind the evaporate to dryness, it is dried in the shade to thorough drying.Later embodiment uses this raw material as the whole strain grass of Chinese sorghum grass plant.\n\nIn the following embodiment, use at least a coating resin that is selected from the colony that forms by polyvinyl alcohol, carboxymethyl cellulose, Resins, epoxy, urethane resin and vibrin.By the method that forms emulsion etc., the modulation coating resin dissolves in the so-called water soluble paint tamanori in water.Just the insect repellent coating that this extract is dissolved in this water soluble paint tamanori is described in detail.\n\n(embodiment 1)\n\nIn the present embodiment, about using the extract of the whole strain grass of Pirolaceae Pylora rotundolia, the situation of modulation insect repellent coating describes.At first, supply in extraction with after the whole strain grass of the Pirolaceae Pylora rotundolia plant thorough drying.The whole strain grass of Pirolaceae Pylora rotundolia plant is placed the mixed solvent (acetone: water=70 weight unit: 30 weight unit) flooded 48 hours of acetone and water.Use rotatory evaporator, concentrate the mixed solvent that is soluble in acetone and water material contain composition.The extract that obtains is the sticky material of chocolate high viscosity.\n\nAs extracting process, can use general method, for example with the method for material plant position long-time dipping in mixed solvent, the temperature heating below the boiling point of mixed solvent, stir, and extract, filter and obtain the method etc. of extract.In the present embodiment, implement extraction, obtain the extract that insect repellent can be high thus from the mixed solvent of acetone and water.\n\nAs shown below, after this extract dissolves in solvent, this is dissolved in liquid be blended in the solvent that contains coating resin, obtain insect repellent coating.Solvent as used herein is the solvent of the character that do not influence coating resin.As solvent, the mixed solvent that a kind of solvent that suitable is in the colony that will select free water, methyl alcohol, ethanol, Virahol and acetone to form or plural number are planted the solvent combination.In the present embodiment, use about 40 â warm water.\n\nCoating resin gets final product for the resin that generally uses in water soluble paint.In the present embodiment, use the polyurethanes coating resin.With this polyurethanes coating resin emulsification, dissolve in modulation polyurethanes coating resin (the following water soluble polyurethane resin that also is called) coating in water then.For obtaining the easily viscosity of coating, water soluble polyurethane resin coating dilution back is used with paint solvent (water).\n\nIn the present embodiment, be converted into the amount of solids component, the following water soluble polyurethane resin of above 40 weight unit of 0.5 weight unit mixes with this extract below 99.5 weight unit more than 60 weight unit, dissolves in.Coating is coated in the film surface, estimates avoiding that this films and keep away performance.Below, expression evaluation experimental method, and represent that avoiding of this extract keep away the measurement result of performance.\n\nThe evaluation experimental method:\n\n1. at length of side 10cm (100cm 2), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) the film surface of thick 125 Î¼ m, the coating above-mentioned coating.The dry weight of coating amount conversion cost extract is 100mg/100cm 2Coating method can be currently known methodss such as spray application, silk screen printing, applies with rolling method in the present embodiment.After the coating, in the free from dust part, fully ventilation is dried to thorough drying.Below, the PET film of coating also is called \" this extract \".\n\nDo not contain the water soluble polyurethane resin coating of this extract to modulate with above-mentioned same method again.The PET film that obtains with this coating of above-mentioned same coating below also is called \" blank group \".\n\nFor the weight before and after the various sample determination coatings, calculate the net weight that is coated with application.\n\nFour corners of the plastic cement experimental tank inner bottom surface of length of side 1m near, with \" this extract \" and \" blank group \" separately 2 pieces place respectively with relative form.Near the central authorities of groove inner bottom surface, place the protection thing and the aqueous gauze that become the cockroach residence.Near two pairs of samples (4 pieces) central authorities separately, place the sugar cube of having measured its initial stage weight.\n\n3. in the gas temperature that controls environment is 27 â above-mentioned experimental tank, puts into each 50 of male and female and amount to 100 Groton bug adults.Quite measure the weight of sugar cube after 72 hours, calculate the intake (sugar cube consumption) of sugar cube in the 4th day total of experiment beginning.\n\n4. avoiding the rate of keeping away is calculated by following formula.\n\nAvoid the rate of keeping away (%)=(1-(the mean square sugar consumption amount on \" this extract \")/(the sugar cube average consumption on \" blank group \")) * 100\n\nWhen the ratio of mixture of this extract and coating resin is changed separately avoid the rate of keeping away and coating characteristic is summarized in the table 1.\n\nTable 1\n\nMixed with resin is than (being converted into solids component) Avoid the rate of keeping away Coating characteristic 0.005 â To the parts non-adhesiveness 0.01 â Soft film coating 0.1 â Good films 0.2 â Good films 0.3 â Firm films 0.4 â³ Firm films\n\nAnd then, \" mixed with resin than \" expression in the table 1 be the ratio that the resin solid composition occupies in the solids weight of insect repellent coating.Again, \" â \" expression is avoided the rate of keeping away more than 90%, \" zero \" expression avoid the rate of keeping away 80% or more 90% less than, \" â³ \" represent to avoid the rate of keeping away more than 60% 80% less than.\n\nBy The above results, can confirm with this extract below 99 weight unit more than 70 weight unit and the water soluble polyurethane resin blended insect repellent coating below 30 weight unit more than 1 weight unit to have practical film performance and avoid and keep away performance.\n\nThen, show to avoid and keep away the measurement result of performance for the coating concentration of this extract.In this evaluation test, be scaled the amount of solids component, use water soluble polyurethane resin to mix the insect repellent coating that dissolves in this extract of 95 weight unit 5 weight unit.\n\nFig. 1 is that the net weight with this extract is illustrated in transverse axis, with the figure that the rate of keeping away is illustrated in the longitudinal axis that avoids of above-mentioned evaluation result.As shown in Figure 1, this extract is with 100mg/100cm 2Above coating amount, expression is to the insect repellent energy of a large amount of Groton bugs that exist in the living environment.Again, the intensity of insect repellent energy is more than realistic scale.Do not keep away dead individual after the off-test because of finding that insect is avoided, so can confirm the security of this extract.\n\nIn the present embodiment, water is described as the situation of dissolving in the solvent of extract.But, can use a kind of solvent or plural number in the colony that water, methyl alcohol, ethanol, Virahol and acetone are formed to plant the mixed solvent that solvent makes up aptly.For example, make the mixed solvent of water 30 weight unit and ethanol 70 weight unit dissolve in extract, also can confirm to have and dissolve in preferably and avoid and keep away performance.\n\nWhen the situation that coating resin is changed to polyvinyl alcohol, carboxymethyl cellulose, Resins, epoxy or vibrin, also have and the same effect of situation of using the polyurethanes coating resin again.\n\nAnd then, for the sample of above-mentioned optimal concentration, estimate to Peroplaneta fluligginosa etc. other the blattaria class insect insect repellent can the time, the situation of susceptible of proof and Groton bug has avoiding of practicality equally and keeps away performance.\n\n(comparative example 1)\n\nExcept that the aqurous ployurethane resin became acrylic resin, other and embodiment 1 were modulated insect repellent coating equally.Same with embodiment 1, coating is coated in the film surface, obtain good system film, and then estimate avoiding that this films and keep away performance.Its result, arbitrarily mixed with resin than the time, avoid the rate of keeping away be 60% less than, can't confirm to bring into play practical avoiding and keep away performance.\n\n(comparative example 2)\n\nFor comparing, keep away performance and relatively avoid by the cockroach of various extracts with the extraction process shown in the embodiment 1 and as the general aqueous extraction method of extraction process.Its evaluation result is in following explanation.By the plant shown in the aqueous extraction method extraction embodiment 1, obtain the water extract of the whole strain grass of Pirolaceae Pylora rotundolia plant.Estimate the insect repellent energy of this water extract.Evaluation method is used the evaluation method shown in the embodiment 1.\n\nFig. 2 is that the net weight with this extract is illustrated in transverse axis, with the figure that the rate of keeping away is illustrated in the longitudinal axis that avoids of above-mentioned evaluation result.As shown in Figure 2, can confirm that avoiding of water extract keep away the existence and the shortage of performance.For example, even to have confirmed the 100mg/100cm of effect in the embodiment 1 2Coating amount more than piece also confirms to show the insect repellent energy to a large amount of Groton bugs that exist in the living environment.\n\nFrom Fig. 1 and result shown in Figure 2, can think that the stripping of effective constituent is few when extracting with respect to water, and during the mixed solvent of water and organic solvent, the stripping of effective constituent is more.Explanation is because the difference of extracting process thus, and it is also different to avoid the percentage extraction of keeping away effective constituent.\n\n(embodiment 2)\n\nIn the present embodiment, the situation of modulating insect repellent coating about the extract that uses the whole strain grass of Tropaeolaceae nasturtium plant describes.At first, supply in extraction with after the whole strain grass of the Tropaeolaceae nasturtium plant thorough drying.The whole strain grass of Tropaeolaceae nasturtium plant is placed the mixed solvent (acetone: water=70 weight unit: 30 weight unit) flooded 48 hours of acetone and water.Use spray-drying process, concentrate the mixed solvent that is soluble in acetone and water material contain composition.The extract that obtains is the sticky material of strong tea brown high viscosity.\n\nAs extracting process, can use general method, the method with material plant position long-time dipping in mixed solvent is for example arranged, the temperature heating below the boiling point of mixed solvent, stir, and extract, filter and obtain the method etc. of extract.In the present embodiment, implement the extraction of the mixed solvent of acetone and water, this obtains the extract of high insect repellent energy.\n\nSame with embodiment 1, the modulation insect repellent coating is measured and is kept away performance with respect to the avoiding of coating concentration of this extract.Its result as shown in Figure 3.\n\nFig. 3 is that the net weight with this extract is illustrated in transverse axis, with the figure that the rate of keeping away is illustrated in the longitudinal axis that avoids of above-mentioned evaluation result.As shown in Figure 3, this extract is with 100mg/100cm 2Above coating amount can demonstrate the insect repellent energy to a large amount of Groton bugs that exist in the living environment.Again, the intensity of insect repellent energy is more than realistic scale.It is 0 that insect is avoided the dead number of individuals of keeping away after the off-test, so can confirm the security of this extract.\n\nIn the present embodiment, water is described as the situation of dissolving in the solvent of extract.But, the mixed solvent that can use a kind of solvent that will select in the colony that free water, methyl alcohol, ethanol, Virahol and acetone forms or plural number to plant the solvent combination aptly.For example, make the mixed solvent of water 30 weight unit and ethanol 70 weight unit dissolve in extract, also can confirm to dissolve in preferably and avoid and keep away performance.\n\nWhen the situation that coating resin is changed to polyvinyl alcohol, carboxymethyl cellulose, Resins, epoxy or vibrin, also have and the same effect of situation of using the polyurethanes coating resin again.\n\nAnd then, for the sample of above-mentioned optimal concentration, estimate to Peroplaneta fluligginosa etc. other the blattaria class insect insect repellent can the time, the situation of susceptible of proof and Groton bug has avoiding of practicality equally and keeps away performance.\n\n(comparative example 3)\n\nFor comparing, keep away performance and relatively avoid by the cockroach of each extract with the extraction process shown in the embodiment 2 and as the general aqueous extraction method of extraction process.Its evaluation result is in following explanation.By the plant shown in the aqueous extraction method extraction embodiment 2, obtain the water extract of the whole strain grass of Tropaeolaceae nasturtium plant.Estimate the insect repellent energy of this water extract.Evaluation method is used the evaluation method shown in the embodiment 1.\n\nThis result can confirm that water extract almost do not avoid keeping away property.For example, even for having confirmed the 100mg/100cm of effect in the embodiment 2 2Above coating amount also confirms to demonstrate the insect repellent energy to a large amount of Groton bugs that exist in the living environment.\n\nFrom this result, can think does not almost have the stripping of effective constituent when extracting with respect to water, and during the mixed solvent of water and organic solvent, the stripping of effective constituent can be carried out effectively.This explanation is because the difference of extracting process, and it is also different to avoid the percentage extraction of keeping away effective constituent.\n\n(embodiment 3)\n\nIn the present embodiment, the situation of modulating insect repellent coating about the extract that uses Portugal section eucalyptus plant leaf describes.At first, supply in extraction with after the Portugal section eucalyptus plant leaf thorough drying.Portugal section eucalyptus plant leaf is placed the mixed solvent (acetone: water=70 weight unit: 30 weight unit) flooded 48 hours of acetone and water.Use spray-drying process, concentrate the mixed solvent that is soluble in acetone and water material contain composition.The extract that obtains is eburneous powder mass.\n\nCarry out equally with embodiment 1, the modulation insect repellent coating is measured and is kept away performance with respect to the avoiding of coating concentration of this extract.Its result, this extract is with 100mg/100cm 2Above coating amount demonstrates the insect repellent energy to a large amount of Groton bugs that exist in the living environment.Again, the intensity of insect repellent energy is more than realistic scale.It is 0 that insect is avoided the dead number of individuals of keeping away after the off-test, so can confirm the security of this extract.\n\nIn the present embodiment, water is described as the situation of dissolving in the solvent of extract.But, the mixed solvent that can use a kind of solvent that will select in the colony that free water, methyl alcohol, ethanol, Virahol and acetone forms or plural number to plant the solvent combination aptly.For example, make the mixed solvent of water 30 weight unit and ethanol 70 weight unit dissolve in extract, also can confirm to dissolve in preferably and avoid and keep away performance.\n\nWhen the situation that coating resin is changed to polyvinyl alcohol, carboxymethyl cellulose, Resins, epoxy or vibrin, also have and the same effect of situation of using the polyurethanes coating resin again.\n\nAnd then, for the sample of above-mentioned optimal concentration, estimate to Peroplaneta fluligginosa etc. other the blattaria class insect insect repellent can the time, the situation of susceptible of proof and Groton bug has avoiding of practicality equally and keeps away performance.\n\n(embodiment 4)\n\nIn the present embodiment, the situation of modulating insect repellent coating about the extract that uses the whole strain grass of Primulaceae Chinese sorghum grass plant describes.At first, supply in extraction with after the whole strain grass of the Primulaceae Chinese sorghum grass plant thorough drying.The whole strain grass of Primulaceae Chinese sorghum grass plant is placed the mixed solvent (ethanol: water=70 weight unit: 30 weight unit) flooded 48 hours of ethanol and water.Use spray-drying process, concentrate the mixed solvent that is soluble in ethanol and water material contain composition.\n\nCarry out equally with embodiment 1, the modulation insect repellent coating is measured and is kept away performance with respect to the avoiding of coating concentration of this extract.Its result, this extract is with 100mg/100cm 2Above coating amount can demonstrate the insect repellent energy to a large amount of Groton bugs that exist in the living environment.Again, the intensity of insect repellent energy is more than realistic scale.It is 0 that insect is avoided the dead number of individuals of keeping away after the off-test, so can confirm the security of this extract.\n\nIn the present embodiment, water is described as the situation of dissolving in the solvent of extract.But, the mixed solvent that can use a kind of solvent that will select in the colony that free water, methyl alcohol, ethanol, Virahol and acetone forms or plural number to plant the solvent combination aptly.For example, make the mixed solvent of water 30 weight unit and ethanol 70 weight unit dissolve in extract, also can confirm to dissolve in preferably and avoid and keep away performance.\n\nWhen the situation that coating resin is changed to polyvinyl alcohol, carboxymethyl cellulose, Resins, epoxy or vibrin, also have and the same effect of situation of using the polyurethanes coating resin again.\n\nAnd then, for the sample of above-mentioned optimal concentration, estimate to Peroplaneta fluligginosa etc. other the blattaria class insect insect repellent can the time, the situation of susceptible of proof and Groton bug has avoiding of practicality equally and keeps away performance.\n\n(embodiment 5)\n\nIn the present embodiment, avoid about the insect that contains the natural series antiseptic-germicide and to keep away coating and describe.The insect repellent coating of present embodiment, containing, different with the insect repellent coating of embodiment 1 as aspect the catechol of natural series antiseptic-germicide.Particularly, the insect repellent coating of present embodiment is to contain and 94 parts of the extracts of the whole strain grass of the same Pirolaceae Pylora rotundolia plant that obtains of embodiment 1, and as 1 part of the catechol (Mitsui agricultural (strain) system) of tea extract, and be scaled the water soluble paint of the water soluble polyurethane resin of 5 parts of drying solid compositions.Extract and catechol are dissolved in the water as paint solvent.The blending ratio of water is adjusted to and obtains the better viscosity of coating state.Same with embodiment 1, apply modulated insect repellent coating on the PET film, use insect (blattaria class), estimate the keeping away property of avoiding of this film.\n\nIts result obtains the initial stage film performance and avoids and keep away all good the filming of performance.This is filmed be positioned over half a year in 37 â the environment space that microorganism more easily breeds.Observe the result who places the back film performance, compare with the insect repellent coating that does not add antimicrobial component, do not find microbial contamination, promptly what is called addles.That is, avoid that keeping away films can prevent microbial contamination.\n\nAs its reason, consider following situation.The insect repellent coating that contains plant extract also contains to avoid and keeps away effective constituent plant extract in addition.Avoid keep away effective constituent with and in addition plant extract, think that the microorganism utilizability is all bigger, so the possibility that addles is arranged.Addling of this extract is not only to reduce to avoid and kept away effective constituent, and cover film coated surface by the resultant that addles, and reduce the feeler of insect or the contact area of the forward foot in a step and film coated surface, so cause the contact of this extract to avoid the reduction that keeps away performance.And then, become the thing that addles, avoid when keeping away the performance disappearance, the anti-bait that becomes insect, and become the source of luring insect.\n\nIf according to present embodiment, can prevent by this extract with and the bad deterioration that causes of genus of in addition plant extract.Therefore, can guarantee to avoid and keep away continuing of performance.\n\nThe natural series antiseptic-germicide is not limited to above-mentioned catechol, and horseradish extract, the Meng, ancestor bamboo extract also can obtain same effect.Again, natural series antiseptic-germicide as an alternative uses the synthetics that is contained in the effective constituent in the natural series antiseptic-germicide of isothiocyanic acid allyl ester etc. also can obtain same effect.\n\nMoreover, be the performance anti-fungal property, by using the synthetic anti-mycotic agent that is, can improve anti-the addling property of insect repellent coating to fungi.\n\n(embodiment 6)\n\nIn the present embodiment, describe about the insect repellent coating that contains silver-series antibacterial agent.The insect repellent coating of present embodiment, from containing the aspect of silver complex class antiseptic-germicide, different with the insect repellent coating of embodiment 1 as silver-series antibacterial agent.Set forth about concrete modulator approach.The absorption of thiosulfate anion silver complex loads on the silica gel, with the silver complex antiseptic-germicide (ProductName: Amenitop of its surface with the lining of tetraethoxysilane hydrolyzate, Panasonic Electric Equipment Industrial Co.,Ltd's system) 1 weight unit, and extract 1 weight unit of the whole strain grass of Pirolaceae Pylora rotundolia plant, after dissolving in, stir and transpiring moisture as the water of 20 weight unit of solvent.Thus, modulating insect that this extract is fixed on silver complex antiseptic-germicide surface avoids and keeps away particle.For representing the coating performance, and water soluble paint resin 2 weight unit are dissolved in water solvent in advance.In this coating tamanori, dissolve in above-mentioned insect and avoid and keep away particle 98 weight unit, be modulated into insect repellent coating.\n\nMethod with same with embodiment 5 is coated in this insect repellent coating on the PET film, estimates to avoid and keeps away performance and antimicrobial decomposability.Its result, avoiding of can confirming to use keeps away performance and antimicrobial decomposability.\n\n(embodiment 7)\n\nCarry out equally with embodiment 2, obtain the concentrated extract of the whole strain grass of plant of Tropaeolaceae nasturtium.This extract is the sticky material of dark brown high viscosity.\n\nAs inorganic carrier, prepare to have the hydrotalcite compounds.This compound is a lamellar compound, can keep this extract at interlayer.This lamellar compound be the layer transverse direction (the relative direction that slightly is orthogonal) length with thickness direction be 0.3 Î¼ m, thick be that 0.06 Î¼ m, specific surface area are 14m 2The powder of/g (field, family industry (strain) system).This powder and this extract are dissolved in the mixed solvent of 70% ethanol and 30% water.After fully dissolving in, when stirring and during evaporating solvent, then obtaining on inorganic carrier load has the insect of this extract to avoid to keep away particle.Be to be dissolved with in the water in the water soluble paint of polyvinyl alcohol, dissolve in this insect and avoid and keep away particle, and the modulation insect repellent coating.\n\nAbout this insect repellent coating, use the evaluation method that discloses in the embodiment 1, similarly estimate to avoid and keep away performance.Its evaluation result is as shown in table 2.\n\nTable 2\n\nThis extract ratio of mixture (being scaled solids component) Inorganic carrier ratio of mixture (being scaled solids component) Mixed with resin is than (being scaled solids component) Avoid the rate of keeping away Coating characteristic 0.89 0.1 0.01 â Few to the parts tackyness 0.80 0.1 0.1 â Good to the parts tackyness 0.60 0.1 0.3 â Good to the parts tackyness 0.60 0.2 0.2 â Good to the parts tackyness 0.49 0.49 0.02 â Soft film coating 0.49 0.2 0.31 â Insect is avoided and keeps away particle and come off 0.39 0.51 0.1 â³\n\nMoreover, the shared ratio of resin solid composition in the solids weight of \" mixed with resin ratio \" the expression insect repellent coating in the table 2, the shared ratio of powder in the solids weight of \" inorganic carrier ratio of mixture \" expression insect repellent coating, \" this extract ratio of mixture \" expression 1 deduct above-mentioned \" mixed with resin than \" and \" inorganic carrier ratio of mixture \" with after ratio.Again, \" â \" expression avoid the rate of keeping away more than 90%, \" â³ \" expression avoid the rate of keeping away more than 60% 80% less than.\n\nFrom The above results, this following extract of above 89 weight unit of 49 weight unit, the following hydrotalcite compounds of above 50 weight unit of 10 weight unit as inorganic carrier, and the insect repellent coating that the following polyvinyl alcohol as coating resin of 30 weight unit mixes more than 1 weight unit, can confirm to have practical film performance and avoid and keep away performance.\n\nOwing to contain and dissolve in insect in the coating of polyvinyl alcohol (coating resin) and avoid and keep away particle, insect avoided keep away particle adhesion and scribbling on the PET film (parts) of coating.Again, because of this extract of high density loads on the carrier, so have the uneven situation of this extract concentration distribution on the film coated surface.In other words, this extract can form point in filming.Thus, can give the stronger stimulation of sensory organ of insect.Even this effect is similar to the food that is identical salt concentration, but because of the concentration distribution homogeneous or the heterogeneity of salt, and the one-tenth degree of people's tongue sensation produces different effects.For example, dissolve in the food of salt grain, the food that does not more dissolve in feels more salty.Therefore, the stronger effect of deterrent effect is arranged.\n\nWhen the situation that coating resin is changed to carboxymethyl cellulose, Resins, epoxy, urethane resin or vibrin, also have and the same effect of situation of using polyvinyl alcohol.\n\nBy above embodiment, susceptible of proof will belong to the extract of the whole strain grass of plant of Pirolaceae (Pyrolaceae), or any one of the extract of the whole strain grass of the plant that belongs to Tropaeolaceae (Tropaaeolaceae) dissolves in the insect repellent coating in containing the paint solvent of coating resin, at least for the insect of blattaria classes such as Groton bug or Peroplaneta fluligginosa, has the insect repellent energy.\n\nIn the insect of using in the experiment, find with age beyond reason and in the situation of death thereafter etc.At this, it is different that insect is avoided being kept away by avoiding of ingesting of seeing in the mechanism of keeping away and the repellent of passing by more as can be known.Particularly, it is to be stimulated by the nerve conduction class that the feeler or the forward foot in a step contact with medicament, is promptly avoided by contact and keeps away.Moreover, from duration of test, can investigate for the action of the insect of testing, follow the results of learning of insect, the situation that is difficult to invade the zone that applies this extract is also arranged.\n\n(embodiment 8)\n\nCarry out equally with embodiment 3, obtain the concentrated extract of Portugal section eucalyptus plant leaf.This extract is eburneous powder mass.\n\nThis extract is dissolved in the mixed solvent of 70% ethanol and 30% water.Dissolve in the liquid at this, dissolve in intercalation compound as the about 30 Î¼ m granularities of having of inorganic carrier.Afterwards, the solvent of liquid is dissolved in evaporation, obtains to avoid in inorganic carrier or the insect of this extract of carrier surface load to keep away particle., use the montomorillonite compounds herein, the concrete montomorillonite that is to use as intercalation compound.The ratio of mixture of this extract and intercalation compound, for this extract 2 weight unit, intercalation compound is 1 weight unit.Again, dissolve in the evaporative process of liquid, temperature is maintained at about 40 â.\n\nTo avoid with the insect that above-mentioned method for making obtains and keep away particle and be crushed to epigranular.At length of side 10cm (100cm 2), the PET film surface of thick 125 Î¼ m, coating thinly contains carboxymethyl cellulose water-solublely goes into coating.On this unhardened filming, stick together insect and avoid and keep away particle filming at parts surface by scattering the insect repellent coating pulverized, forming.\n\nThis is filmed, use the evaluation method same, estimate to avoid and keep away performance with embodiment 1.Its result, this extract is with 100mg/100cm 2Above coating amount then demonstrates the insect repellent energy to a large amount of Groton bugs that exist in the living environment.Again, the intensity of insect repellent energy more than realistic scale particularly is on 70%.It is 0 that insect is avoided the dead number of individuals of keeping away after the off-test, so can confirm the security of this extract.\n\nOn the other hand, filming when forming shown in the present embodiment, other are identical step except that not using this extract, and formation is filmed.Film about this, use the evaluation method same, estimate and avoid the result who keeps away performance, can't confirm to avoid and keep away performance with embodiment 1.Therefore as can be known, the cause of keeping away performance of avoiding of present embodiment is not be film coated surface concavo-convex, but is this extract.\n\nExtract is changed to the extract of the whole strain grass of Pirolaceae Pylora rotundolia plant, the extract of the whole strain grass of Tropaeolaceae nasturtium plant, the situation that Primulaceae Chinese sorghum grass plant is put in order the extract of strain grass, also have the same effect of situation with the extract that uses Portugal section eucalyptus plant leaf.\n\n(embodiment 9)\n\nAt first, supply in extraction with after the whole strain grass of the Primulaceae Chinese sorghum grass plant thorough drying.The whole strain grass of Primulaceae Chinese sorghum grass plant is placed the mixed solvent (ethanol: water=70 weight unit: 30 weight unit) flooded 48 hours of ethanol and water.Use spray-drying process, concentrate the mixed solvent that is soluble in ethanol and water material contain composition.\n\nThis extract is dissolved in the mixed solvent of 70% ethanol and 30% water.Dissolve in the liquid at this, dissolve in intercalation compound as the about 30 Î¼ m granularities of having of inorganic carrier.Afterwards, the solvent of liquid is dissolved in evaporation, obtains to avoid in inorganic carrier and the insect of this extract of carrier surface load to keep away particle.Use the hydrotalcite compounds as intercalation compound herein.The ratio of mixture of this extract and intercalation compound, for this extract 2 weight unit, intercalation compound is 1 weight unit.Again, dissolve in the evaporative process of liquid, temperature is remained about 40 â.\n\nThe insect that pulverizing obtains with above-mentioned method for making is avoided and keeps away particle, makes granularity all be about 30 Î¼ m.In with vibrin emulsive Polyester Resin Water Soluble coating, the insect of dissolving in pulverizing is avoided and keeps away particle, the modulation insect repellent coating.\n\nAt length of side 10cm (100cm 2), the PET film surface of thick 125 Î¼ m, the mode that is about 5 Î¼ m with the thickness that makes the resin part applies insect repellent coating thinly, in about 60 â temperature drying and sclerosis, formation is filmed.\n\nThis is filmed, use the evaluation method same, estimate to avoid and keep away performance with embodiment 1.Its result, this extract is with 100mg/100cm 2Above coating amount demonstrates the insect repellent energy to a large amount of Groton bugs that exist in the living environment.Again, the intensity of insect repellent energy is more than realistic scale.It is 0 that insect is avoided the dead number of individuals of keeping away after the off-test, so can confirm the security of this extract.\n\nIn the present embodiment, avoid the granularity of keeping away particle for insect and be about 30 Î¼ m, the dried coating thickness is about 5 Î¼ m.That is, insect avoid keep away particle granularity also greater than the dried coating thickness.Therefore, load has the insect of this extract to avoid to keep away particle and expresses convex in film coated surface.Because of when insect when film coated surface is creeped, can enlarge the contact area of this extract and insect, avoid and keep away effective constituent so can make insect absorb this effectively.\n\nWhen the situation that coating resin is changed to polyvinyl alcohol, carboxymethyl cellulose, Resins, epoxy or urethane resin, also have and the same effect of situation of using vibrin.\n\n(embodiment 10)\n\nAs inorganic carrier, use mainly to constitute by porous inorganic oxide, have 300m 2The specific surface area that/g is above, use contains the particle shape powder of silanol group granularity below 50 Î¼ m on the surface, and other and embodiment 7 carry out equally, the modulation insect repellent coating.Particularly, use the surface to carry out aerosil particles (ProductName: Sylophobic 200, the Silysia of Fuji chemistry (strain) system) of the granularity 1 Î¼ m after the hydrophobic treatment, through the step same with embodiment 7, the modulation insect is avoided and keeps away particle.And then, in the water soluble paint that in water, is dissolved with polyvinyl alcohol, dissolve in this insect and avoid and keep away particle, the modulation insect repellent coating.\n\nAbout this insect repellent coating, use the evaluation method that discloses in the embodiment 1, similarly estimate to avoid and keep away performance.Its result, same with the intercalation compound that uses hydrotalcite compounds etc. as the situation of inorganic carrier, mix this following extract of above 89 weight unit of 49 weight unit, following aerosil particles of above 50 weight unit of 10 weight unit, and the insect repellent coating of the polyvinyl alcohol below above 30 weight unit of 1 weight unit, can confirm to have practical film performance and avoid and keep away performance.\n\nWhen the situation that coating resin is changed to carboxymethyl cellulose, Resins, epoxy, urethane resin or vibrin, also have and the same effect of situation of using polyvinyl alcohol.\n\n(embodiment 11)\n\nIn embodiment 7, to use when the mixed solvent the interfacial agent except dissolving in inorganic carrier (hydrotalcite compounds), other steps are carried out the step same with embodiment 7, and the modulation insect is avoided and keeps away particle.In mixed solvent, for this extract 100 weight unit, the amount that can add interfacial agent is above 500 weight unit of 1 weight unit following (being 10 weight unit in the present embodiment).In the present embodiment, with this extract of 50g, the inorganic carrier of 50g, and the sorbitan stearate (nonionic of sorbitan-fatty acid ester class is an interfacial agent) of 5g dissolves in the mixed solvent (70% ethanol+30% water) at 1000ml.\n\nAfter fully dissolving in, stir and evaporating solvent, obtaining on inorganic carrier load has the insect of this extract to avoid to keep away particle.In water, be dissolved with in the water soluble paint of polyvinyl alcohol, dissolve in this insect and avoid and keep away particle, the modulation insect repellent coating.\n\nAbout this insect repellent coating, use the evaluation method that discloses in the embodiment 1, similarly estimate to avoid and keep away performance.\n\nIts result, identical with the situation of the embodiment 7 that only uses this extract and inorganic carrier (hydrotalcite compounds), the insect repellent coating of present embodiment is confirmed to have practical film performance and avoid and keep away performance.Again, the insect repellent coating of present embodiment finds that the effect persistence is improved.The mechanism that the effect persistence is improved can be thought as follows.By also usefulness, produce the effect of the assimilated efficiency of this extract that improves process worm skin with interfacial agent and this extract.At this, can effectively utilize this extract, so the consumption of this extract of may command in minimum, and improves the persistence avoid avoiding effect.\n\nWhen the situation that coating resin is changed to carboxymethyl cellulose, Resins, epoxy, urethane resin or vibrin, also have and the same effect of situation of using polyvinyl alcohol.\n\n(embodiment 12)\n\nThe water soluble polyurethane resin applying coating that will contain this extract and water soluble polyurethane resin is on parts and make to avoid and keep away member.Particularly, on the polyester film thick, with round point shape printing water soluble polyurethane resin coating by 125 Î¼ m of the surperficial compactness of corona discharge raising.Round dot is the circle of diameter 1mm with every, and being disposed at longitudinal direction and transverse direction is 3mm square grid shape at interval.\n\nUse this to avoid and keep away member, investigation is provided with the nesting property of cockroach of the rinse bath of introducer on (near the ground) below the pedal along ground.Particularly, adjacent to avoid applicator surface and the top of keeping away member, the form that his face and ground join is installed thin plate (avoid and keep away member) at the introducer of rinse bath.Keep away having or not of member setting by avoiding, relatively during the nesting property of the cockroach of this rinse bath, can find significant superiority.\n\nTherefore, keep away the part that member is arranged at the insect route of entry by avoiding, the wholesomeness in the time of can confirming to use rinse bath is improved.\n\n(embodiment 13)\n\nThe cold coating that will contain this extract and Resins, epoxy is coated in circuit substrate.Particularly, after the circuit substrate of glass reinforced epoxy system is installed electronic component, on the back side and the surface of circuit substrate, difference application of resin coating.\n\nUse this circuit substrate, make electric cooker etc. and be arranged at electrical equipment in the kitchen, use household electrical appliance such as the TV of stand-by electric often or video recorder, the Industrial products of security arrangement, communicator, office device, lavatory etc.As these Industrial products, confirm to have inhibition because of the nest effect of the fault that causes, abnormal heating etc. of the intrusion of insect.\n\nAs above, confirm to bring into play in actual use to avoid fully and to keep away performance, and can improve the maintenance of quality owing to there are the insect possible Industrial products of nesting to use insect repellent coating of the present invention.\n\n(embodiment 14)\n\nModulation contains the insect repellent coating of this extract, water soluble polyurethane resin and inorganic oxide carrier.With this insect repellent coating impregnation or be coated in the parts surface of synthetic resins thin plate, synthetic resin film, paper etc., modulation is avoided and is kept away member.This is avoided keep away component groups and be contained in the various machines again.So, make building materials, the home gardening goods, materials and equipments of wallpaper or ground thin plate etc., the Industrial products of handle official business device, internals, external member, vending machine, auto parts, traffic correlation machine, furniture, kitchen machine, medibank equipment etc.\n\nThe Industrial products of being confirmed these by spot testing have good avoiding for Peroplaneta fluligginosa and keep away performance.These member or machine not only can be arranged in the living space, also can use outside the inferior room of eaves or be provided with.This kind situation, blattaria such as Groton bug, Peroplaneta fluligginosa class not only, even also may be because of the ant class of the brown ant of Japan, Japanese considerable ant etc., and suffer damage.Confirmed to keep away performance for avoiding of the brown ant of Japan, expectation also has for the considerable ant of Japan avoids avoiding effect equally, and then expectation also can have for the outer unhappy insect that induces one of these ant classes and avoids avoiding effect equally.\n\nAbout keeping away performance, carry out spot testing equally by home monitor for avoiding of blattaria class again.Its result can confirm also have the practical bigger avoiding effect of avoiding that upward is for Groton bug or Peroplaneta fluligginosa.\n\nThese member or machine confirm to have inhibition because of the intrusion of insect the wholesomeness that causes of nesting reduces, and alleviate the expression effect of the unplessantness displeasure of using the human consumer etc.\n\nAs above, use insect repellent coating of the present invention owing to there is insect to nest on the Industrial products of possibility, affirmation can be brought into play practical going up and keep away performance for avoiding fully, and can improve the maintenance of quality.\n\nFrom above embodiment, belong to the extract of the whole strain grass of plant of Pirolaceae (Pyrolaceae), the extract that belongs to the whole strain grass of plant of Tropaeolaceae (Tropaaeolaceae), the extract of plant leaf that belongs to Portugal section (Myrtaceae) and any one of extract that belongs to the whole strain grass of plant of Primulaceae (Primulaceae), all can be to a large amount of blattaria classes that exist in the living environment or the stronger insect repellent energy of ant class performance.These plants are from the actual effect of using as Chinese medicine, even can guarantee to be positioned over the security that also can not influence the health of human body in the living environment.Again, these plant, by with as pharmaceuticals, in other words as only limiting to great and urgent situation and the method diverse ways of the Chinese medicine that uses and utilizing.That is, avoiding of obtaining from these plant keeps away composition, non-taking, but be used as the chemical substance that often has in the living environment.\n\nAnd then, nest by suppressing insect, can suppress pacing up and down of insect.Therefore, performance suppresses in advance the microorganism diffusion that produced by pacing up and down of insect, or suppresses to follow dust or dispersing of fungi and the hypersensitive effect that produces, so industrial effect of the present invention is bigger.\n\nAgain, by taking 1) this extract is loaded on carrier, 2) by also using with interfacial agent, raising keeps away the assimilated efficiency of composition to avoiding of insect, 3) by with antiseptic-germicide and usefulness, realize preventing that this avoids the microorganism utilizability of keeping away composition self, and keep to avoid and keep away performance, Deng method, can keep or improve to avoid and keep away performance.\n\nBy insect repellent coating of the present invention is applied in the various Industrial products, the sanitary insect pest that can prevent to survive in the living environment, the nesting of insect of insect, the unhappy insect that induces one etc. at home.Therefore,, improve the livability of living environment or prevent the deterioration of material of construction, prevent that the occupant's that caused by the dead bones of the body of insect allergy etc. is comparatively effective, so industrial value of the present invention is bigger for improving the hygienic issues of nesting and causing because of insect.\n\nAccording to the present invention, can provide a large amount of sanitary insect pests that exist in the living environment or the unhappy pest type that induces one is effectively, and less to the human influence, i.e. the insect repellent coating of high security.According to the present invention, can provide the Industrial products that print or apply relevant insect repellent coating again.More than,
