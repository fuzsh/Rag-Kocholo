        "text": "<strong>ABSTRACT</strong> <strong>GUÉNARD</strong>, <strong>BENOIT</strong> <strong>SÉBASTIEN</strong>. <strong>Ant</strong> <strong>Diversity</strong>, <strong>from</strong> Local to Global Scales: Effects of Environmental Conditions, Community Structure and Biological Invasions. (Under the direction of Dr. Robert R. Dunn.) Our understanding of global diversity patterns is largely based on the study of vertebrates and plants. However, the vast majority of described species (and probably undescribed species) are insects. As a consequence, the effort to protect biodiversity is skewed toward a visible minority of organisms while the impacts of human activities on the majority of species are less well known. While the study of diversity of all insects at a large scale or at a global scale is at this point impossible; the study of specific groups of insects, as surrogates for most insect groups, is feasible. The results shown here represent the first attempt to understanding the global distribution of a large group of insects, ants (Formicidae). <strong>Ant</strong>s have been shown to be one of the best surrogates at local and regional scales and are ecologically relevant for the stability and composition of ecosystems. Our results demonstrate that diversity hotspots in ants differ <strong>from</strong> those observed in vertebrates suggesting that conservation plans established on the basis of the diversity of vertebrate groups might not be optimal for insects. Based on our actual knowledge of ants, two models were designed to identify regions of the globe that have been poorly explored. These described ―hotspots of ignorance‖ also appear to be the most threatened regions in terms of deforestation, therefore leading to the conclusion that many species in these areas could disappear even before they are discovered. Our results bring to light that the development of biodiversity surveys and conservation programs with a special focus on insects is in urgent need."
