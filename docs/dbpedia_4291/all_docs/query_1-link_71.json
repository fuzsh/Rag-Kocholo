        "text": "The body surface of nearly all insects, including ants, is covered with a lipid layer that largely consists of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC). They fulfil several functions, the two best-studied ones being communication and protection against water loss. CHC profiles are astonishingly diverse as even a single individual can possess more than 100 different hydrocarbon molecules. Species vastly differ in their CHC composition, but also within species, CHC profiles vary among individuals of different sex, caste, fertility, age, health state, etc. This variation has been intensely studied especially in eusocial insects like ants, where differences are likely to have a signalling function. However, with so many sources of variation in CHC profiles, it is easy to lose track of which factors are more important than others, which patterns can be generalised, and which are idiosyncratic. Thus, we need a deeper understanding of how precisely different factors influence CHC variation. In this re...\n\nAnts (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are one of the most diverse and ubiquitous groups of social insects the largest family under the order Hymenoptera. In insects, cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC) function as chemical cues for the recognition of mates, species, and nest-mates in social insects. The surface of insects is covered by a complex mixture of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) to prevent desiccation. In this study, the cuticular hydrocarbons profiles (CHCs) of weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina workers was extracted and analyzed in Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The results reveal that O. smaragdina CHCs extract composed straight-chain and branched-chain alkanes and alkenes. A total of 18 CHCs were identified in the workers of O. smaragdina. The major cuticular hydrocarbons such as Hexadecane (C16H34), Octacosane (C28H58), Octadecane,9-ethyl-9-heptyl (C27H56), Heptacosane (C27H56), Eicosane,9-octyl (C28H58) and Pentatriacontane (C35H72). These cuticular hydrocarbons might be acted as a chemical messenger between the ant colony, nest, nest-mate recognition of the weaver ant O. smaragdina.\n\nSimple Summary Social insects use cuticular hydrocarbons for chemical recognition and communication. Cuticular hydrocarbons can also be exploited by parasites to their advantage for undermining host recognition systems. The small hive beetle (SHB) is a parasite of honey bee colonies but can also infest nests of other bee species. However, its chemical profile is still not known. For the first time, the present study investigated the SHB chemical profile and compared it with that of its honey bee host. The results show that the SHB has a low chemical profile that is similar to its honey bee host’s. However, while honey bees had a clear colony-specific chemical profile, SHBs did not. The generic chemical profile of the SHB is most likely linked to its free-flying behaviour in the field as these parasites are known to switch between host colonies, possibly limiting the acquisition of a colony specific chemical profile. Our findings also suggest that SHBs do not exploit any finely tuned...\n\nParasitic Hymenoptera can be difficult to identify by conventional taxonomic techniques. Examination of the cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) provides a basis for chemotaxonomic differentiation, which may lead to the discovery of pheromones, and can be a means of examining colonies for species cross-contamination. The parasitic wasps examined were Muscidifurax raptor, M. zaraptor, M. uniraptor, and the gregarious form of M. raptorellus. Species within the genus Muscidifurax, as well as the sex, can clearly be differentiated by examining the gas chromatograms of the CHCs. Identification of the alkanes by mass spectrometry shows uncommon dimethylalkanes and trimethylalkanes for members of the genus. The methyl branched cuticular hydrocarbons of these insects are rare compared to those found on insects reported in the literature, but are present in significant amounts on these insects. Additionally, sexual dimorphism is observed in long chain alkanes (C21–C39) present on male and female cu..."
