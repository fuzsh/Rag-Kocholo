        "text": "Insecta (insects) is a class of the kingdom Animalia (animals). Insects are distinguished by having three pairs of legs; a segmented body including a head, thorax, and abdomen; and one pair of antennae. Most have one or two pairs of wings and compound eyes.\n\nAccording to one estimate, there are between 6,000,000 and 10,000,000 living insect species worldwide. They represent at least 80%, possibly more than 90%, of all species extant worldwide. In North America north of Mexico there are more than 86,000 species in about 12,500 genera in more than 600 families in 28 orders."
