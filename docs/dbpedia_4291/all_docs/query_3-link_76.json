        "text": "ABSTRACT. Information on the biogeographical composition and spatial distribution patterns of ant assemblages in Mongolia is relatively scarce. In this study we investigated species richness, spatial distribution and biogeographical composition of the Mongolian ant fauna and recorded a total of 71 species belonging to 17 genera and three subfamilies. Genus and species richness of ants is lower in Mongolia than in most surrounding geopolitical regions. Using published literature as well as our own data we examined how ant species richness was related to phytogeographical elements. The major part of the Mongolian ant fauna is associated with the mountain taiga and forest-steppe ecosystems. A few ant species belong to the arid steppe, semi-desert and desert ecosystems. We observed no significant correlation between species richness of ants and land area size of phytogeographical regions; however, species richness of ants and plants in various phytogeographical regions showed a signific...\n\nAim Ants (Hymenoptera/Formicidae) have strong influences on ecosystems especially in arid regions. However, little is known about ants of the vast steppe and desert regions of Central Asia. Here we provide the first comprehensive study of ant communities in Mongolia, conducted along a north-to-south gradient in climate. We examined antsâ€™ distribution patterns, assessed the impact of climatic parameters on community structure and species diversity and investigated the influence of the corresponding communities of plants.Location Mongolia (Central Asia).Methods We observed 31,956 ants at seed baits at 11 study sites along a transect from steppe to Gobi desert for which we attained meteorological data (mean yearly precipitation: 197 to 84 mm). Extra sampling was conducted at sugar and protein baits and by the inspection of different microhabitats. Vegetation patterns of each plot were recorded. Statistical evaluation comprised ordination and correlation.Results We observed 15 species of ants at seed baits. Three faunal complexes of ants could be distinguished by detrended correspondence analysis (DCA): (1) in steppe baits were dominated by Formica- and Myrmica-species, (2) in semi desert we found mostly species of Tetramorium, Myrmica, Proformica, Plagiolepis, and Leptothorax, and (3) in desert Cataglyphis aenescens and Messor aciculatus dominated, and Lasius was exclusively found there. Another 11 rare ant species were sampled by hand and at sugar baits. Altogether five ant species were new to the Mongolian fauna: Cardiocondyla koshewnikovi, Myrmica koreana, Myrmica pisarskii, Polyergus nigerrimus, and Proformica kaszabi. Assignment of taxa to functional groups showed that in steppe cold climate specialists dominated, in semi desert we found mainly opportunists, and in desert hot climate specialists. Several functional groups know from arid zones in other parts of the world were missing. In desert certain species were highly dominant. First DCA scores of ant- and plant-communities were highly correlated with each other and with climatic parameters. While plant species diversity was positively correlated with increasing northern latitude, ant diversity and ant species richness were not correlated with latitude and responded neither to precipitation, nor to any other climatic parameter. Semi desert was a transition zone between steppe and desert, with high species richness. Ant genus composition of the ecotone overlapped with both other regions. However, beta diversity between pairs of plots within this zone was low, indicating a small-scale mosaic pattern.Main conclusions The ant communities in the Mongolian steppe and desert zones were strongly influenced by low temperatures and differed in many aspects from the ant fauna in other arid ecosystems, especially in terms of species richness, diversity of feeding guilds, and richness of functional groups.\n\nZonal and Zoogeographic Characteristic of the Ant Fauna (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) of UkraineOne hundred fourty ant species belonging to 38 genera of 5 subfamilies are known to occur in Ukraine nowadays. All the species are attributed to 16 zoogeographic complexes that are grouped into three faunogenetic classes. Comparative zonal and zoogeographical analysis of the fauna of different geographical regions of Ukraine has revealed their essential heterogeneity. The ant fauna of the Forest-Steppe zone is not original. At the same time, it is not transitive between the faunae of the Forest and Steppe zones. Ant fauna of the Forest-Steppe is related to those not the Steppe but the Forests zones, and the Forest-Steppe can be included in the southern subzone of a Forest zone of t Europe.\n\nNepal, a part of the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot, has a high diversity of habitat and species. Its myrmecofaunal diversity and distribution, however, is little understood. Here, I summarize the provincial distribution of all named species of ants for the seven provinces of Nepal through a literature review and examination of materials available at museum and private collections. The distribution of Nepalese ants in each province reveals that Bagmati province has the highest known generic and species richness with 37 genera and 93 species, followed by Gandaki (32, 68), Province 1 (27, 55), Sudurpashchim (15, 15), Lumbini (12, 13), Madhesh (9, 11), and Karnali (5, 5). The four of the seven provinces, Sudurpashchim, Karnali, Lumbini, and Madhesh have been significantly under sampled in the country in terms of documented species richness. Although the figures cannot accurately represent the real species richness of each province, I hope that by highlighting the research gaps, it will..."
