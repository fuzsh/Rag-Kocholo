        "meta_description": "The genitalia of male ants are interpreted in the context of the broader Hymenoptera. For the first time muscle homologies are established for twenty six species of ants in nine subfamilies: Amblyoponinae, Cerapachyinae, Dolichoderinae, Ecitoninae, Ectatomminae, Formicinae, Leptanilloidinae, Myrmicinae and Ponerinae. Fifteen muscles in total are found in the external genitalia of male ants and all are homologous with the musculature of basal Hymenoptera (Schulmeister 2001). Secondary fusion, reduction or losses of muscles have occurred in different lineages. From generalized to derived, the functional morphology and qualitative mechanics of three taxa, Formica obscuripes Forel 1886, Messor andrei Mayr (1886) and Labidus coecus Latreille (1802) are described and compared. Special reference is made to the Ecitoninae, where the work of Birket-Smith (1981) is reinterpreted and volsellar homology is clarified. The true digitus of Labidus is revealed to be a small sclerite at the base of the distal volsellar element which is re-identified as the cuspis.",
