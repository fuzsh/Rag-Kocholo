        "text": "Many temperate forests, especially those in Scandinavia, are crawling with wood ants; their mounds and trails scattered everywhere. Although most wood ants (Formica rufa group) look similar, there are a range of species based on a series of morphological features (Chapter 1). The ‘alpha taxonomy’ method established by Linnaeus has been remarkably robust, given that the ants do not use these morphological features to recognise nestmates from non-nestmates. This is achieved by a rich chemical language, and only when we understand this hidden aspect of the ants' world can we start to explain many of their observable behaviours. For example, how are territories maintained, or why do some wood ants vigorously defend their mound while other mounds are linked by trails along which ants move freely (Chapuisat et al. 2005)? We are just starting to reveal the complex recognition systems that allow each ant to distinguish its nestmates from all others and respond accordingly, and the Formica ants currently represent some of the best studied species. Ant recognition is a very active and fast-moving field of research that has been subject to several reviews, which include general reviews (e.g. Hölldobler and Wilson 1990, 2009; Howard and Blomquist 2005), ant social parasitism (Lenoir et al. 2001), fertility signals (Hefetz 2007), books on hydrocarbons (e.g. Blomquist and Bagnères 2010) and other compounds produced by ants (Morgan 2004). This chapter concentrates solely on recent advances in the chemical ecology of Formica ants, including wood ants, which have become leading model systems especially for the study of species and nestmate recognition systems.\n\nBrief history of ant chemical ecology\n\nIt has been known for over 100 years that ants use odours to distinguish friends from foes (Fielde 1901, 1903), since aggression between ants from different colonies or species is common, but not universal. In any ant colony or on any foraging trail, ants are continuously using their antenna to touch their surroundings and fellow ants. Unseen by us is an amazingly complex chemical world that governs the vast majority of their behaviours. Whereas most vertebrates rely on visual and oral forms of communication, the vast majority of invertebrates rely on chemical communication."
