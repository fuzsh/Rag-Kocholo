In this review, we cover circumstances in which ant competition escalates into combat, battle strategies and tactics, and analysis methods for these battles. The trends for when colonies choose to fight can vary greatly dependent on the species and situation, which we review in detail. Because of their large group sizes, ant conflicts can follow different patterns than many other species, with a variety of specialist adaptations and battle strategies, such as specialized worker classes and the need to rapidly recruit large number of compatriots. These same large group sizes also can make ant fighting amenable to mathematical analysis, particularly in the context of Lanchester’s laws that consider how total numbers influence the outcome of a confrontation. Yet, dynamic behavior can often disrupt idealized mathematical predictions in real-world scenarios, even though these can still shed light on the explanations for such behavior. We also systematically cover the literature on battles between groups of ants, presenting several other interesting studies on species with unique colony organization, such as army ants and leafcutter ants.\n\nKeywords: ants, aggression, battles, strategies\n\nIntroduction\n\nAnts (Hymenoptera: Formicidae, Latreille 1809) are ubiquitous. There are native ant species living on every continent on Earth except Antarctica (Moffett 2010; Peter Convey, British Antarctic Survey, personal communication). They are found in urban areas, remote areas, and everywhere in between. Ants occur in several ecological niches and indeed, they act as keystone species in various ecosystems. In their interactions with others, ants may act as prey, herbivores, predators, scavengers, seed dispersers, and farmers and may engage in mutualistic relationships (Schultheiss et al. 2022). Ants first appeared on Earth over 140 million years ago, and the current number of unique species has been estimated at 11,800 (Moreau et al. 2006) and 15,700 (Schultheiss et al. 2022). A recent study conservatively estimates an abundance of 20 quadrillion ants (Schultheiss et al. 2022).\n\nGiven their large numbers and extensive terrain coverage, ants must compete with other ants for resources. We will discuss examples of conflict among ants, which takes a myriad of forms and can range from ritualized encounters, in which ants posture to demonstrate their size and/or numbers, to lethal battles. Physical fighting typically involves the use of mandibles for biting, dragging, or holding and the release of venom, which most often takes the form of stinging. Ants may engage in combat with conspecific ants from other colonies or with members of other species. In rare cases, even ants from the same colony may fight. Differences in levels of aggression have been noted among species but, even within species, context-dependent responses lead to a diversity of aggressive behaviors and strategies.\n\nDue to the often large number of combatants engaged and the scope of the battles, ant warfare has been compared to human warfare. In both, individuals may gain advantage by using various tactics, and certain strategies may benefit the group collectively. For example, the ability to recruit larger forces can lead to victory, and using more expendable individuals can increase overall colony efficiency. A notable difference between human and ant warfare is that there is no leader or central decision maker for ants; collective strategy arises out of individual behaviors and the interactions between individuals. These battles often capture the public’s imagination, appearing in games, television, and other media.\n\nThe purpose of this manuscript is to comprehensively collect, for the first time in a single review, studies in the steadily growing field of ant combat. We examine under what circumstances ants are likely to engage, with whom, and using what strategies. We also analyze models of ant combat and describe several case studies with various species of interest. For modeling and mathematical analysis, we provide a different perspective on Lanchester’s laws than a recent review (Clifton 2020) and provide a more focused assessment of ants than another review on group conflicts (Green et al. 2020).\n\nFactors That Affect Levels of Aggression\n\nEarly anecdotal reports established that ants of different species do not always fight when they encounter one another (Dobrzanski and Dobrzanska 1975). The authors concluded that the probability of fighting was dependent on several variables including levels of aggression in the individual, the behavioral state of the colony, and the relative numbers of potential combatants. There is also marked variation in ants based on their species, that of their opponent, and colony size. Cuticular hydrocarbons are thought to act as a major component of colony member recognition [and supercolony; see Brandt et al. (2009)] and likely interspecific species recognition, and should thus be expected to play an essential role in any biological pathways involved in determining levels of aggression.\n\nWe discuss below what may affect the propensity to engage in aggressive behavior including factors such as the species encountered, whether the individual encountered is a neighbor or not, proximity to the nest, individual variation including size of the combatants, and resource distribution. These studies involved the use of comparison groups to provide information on the factors most likely to elicit aggression. However, we note that it is difficult to compare across multiple studies because there is no standardized protocol for experimental design. Ants may be presented to other ants dead or alive, in arenas of varying kinds or in situ, free or tethered. Aggression may be measured by degree of aggressive response (e.g., with ratings of 0, 1, 2) or by tallying individual behaviors (e.g., mandibles open, biting, holding, etc.). Thus, specific comparative studies would likely be needed to fully understand differences between the ranges of responses between groups of ants.\n\nSpecies Encountered\n\nAnts consistently show marked differences in response depending on what other ants they encounter. Tamarri et al. (2009) presented Formica ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Formicinae), F. cunicularia and F. rufibarbis, with several types of recently killed ants from different categories. Ants from other colonies of the same species elicited intermediate levels of aggression, whereas the presentation of Polygergus rufescens (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Formicinae) slave-maker workers led to higher levels of aggressive behaviors as well as the emergence of more ants into the stimulus area (Tamarri et al. 2009). F. rufibarbis workers were more aggressive than F. cunicularia in the presence of the slave-making ant. Interestingly, the slave-maker ants typically raid the nests of F. cunicularia in preference to F. rufibarbis, presumably as a result of the latter showing increased aggression (Tamarri et al. 2009). Differing responses to other species was demonstrated in Temnothorax longispinosus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae) with a competitor, T. ambiguous, more often dragged from the nest and a slave-maker ant attacked more aggressively (Scharf et al. 2011). An encounter with even a single dead Protomognathus americanus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae) ant raised the overall aggression level in T. longispinosus host colonies such that it extended toward non-nestmate conspecifics in addition to slave maker ants and lasted for days (Pamminger et al. 2011). Keresztes et al. (2020) presented individual Liometopum microcephalum (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Dolichoderinae) with a single ant from various colonies and measured behavior in the laboratory. Levels of aggression were highest when encountering an ant of another species, Lasius niger (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Formicinae), and lowest among nestmates (Keresztes et al. 2020).\n\nFamiliarity (Neighbor Effects)\n\nTerritorial ants often compete with their close neighbors for resources but must expend energy when engaging in combative behavior with them. Thus, there is interest in whether ants adopt the “dear enemy” strategy in which they are less aggressive with known neighbors or the “nasty neighbor” strategy in which they escalate fights with neighbors (Temeles 1994). Several studies provide support for the “nasty neighbor” effect, where aggression is increased between adjacent colonies, potentially providing long-term benefits from degraded neighbors that will be repeatedly encountered. Even when ants change nest sites frequently, as with the Japanese queenless ant, Pristomyrmex pungens, workers learn to distinguish neighbors from strangers and direct more aggression toward neighbors (Tsuji 1988, Sanada-Morimura et al. 2003). In some cases, the pattern of behavior may be established despite competition risk. For example, in tree-dwelling Liometopum microcephalum ants (Keresztes et al. 2020), there is likely less chance of meeting ants from neighboring colonies, given their vertical territories. Nevertheless, aggression levels were higher toward ants from neighboring nests and lower when workers were from more distant nests (Tsuji 1988, Sanada-Morimura et al. 2003). Other studies provide support for the “dear enemy” hypothesis in which ants may avoid the costs of combat, especially when repeated encounters are likely to occur (Sanada-Morimura et al. 2003). Tanner and Keller (2012) suggest another benefit, that of inclusive fitness, may be present in Streblognathus peetersi (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Ponerinae) because these ants disperse by group fission, so neighbors may be more closely related.\n\nTanner and Adler (2009) observed that F. integroides engaged in a period of inspection with “artificial ants” (glass beads that had been coated with surface lipids). They propose that these ants use a “tit-for-tat” strategy. If the opponent does not show aggressive behavior, as was the case with the artificial ants, they are less likely to fight. This suggests that familiar neighbors would be less aggressive and not provoke a combative response (Tanner and Adler 2009). shows the typical response to neighbors for representative species.\n\nTable 1.\n\nCitationSpeciesSupport for dear enemy or nasty neighbor Newey et al., 2010 Oecophylla smaragdina\n\nWeaver antNasty neighbor Frizzi et al., 2015 Crematogaster scutellaris Mediterranean acrobat antNasty neighbor Benedek & Kóbori, 2014 Formica pratensis\n\nBlack backed meadow antNasty neighbor Katzerke et al.

In the spring, the level of aggression toward neighbors was higher than at other times of the year. This differs from aggression toward ants of other species, which remained high despite the season. The authors suggest some explanations for these seasonal differences. Food shortages at a time of protein demand for spring reproduction may increase competition between neighbors. Alternatively, separation during winter may enhance differences between nestmate recognition cues during initial encounters in the spring (Katzerke et al. 2006).\n\nArgentine ants that live in supercolonies show higher levels of aggressive behaviors after direct encounters with ants from other colonies (Thomas et al. 2005) with more aggression directed toward non-colony neighbors upon contact than toward non-neighbors (Thomas et al. 2007). Such “supercolonies” are groups of colonies, each often with multiple queens (polygyne), that do not compete directly with each other (Thomas et al. 2005). Ants from other colonies that are part of the same “supercolony” are treated similarly to nestmates.\n\nFurther research could provide insight into the ecological and species characteristics that correlate with the “dear enemy” versus “nasty neighbor” strategies. For example, “nasty neighbor” may be more common when a species would tend to substantially overmatch its neighbors in size and power, while “dear enemy” may prevail for species in situations where the costs of conflicts would be high due to similar net combat capacity between colonies. It may also be possible that a colony can dynamically adjust its strategy in some cases as the situation evolves.\n\nProximity to the Nest\n\nCloser proximity to the nest may initiate more aggression. Workers of Diacamma sp. (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Ponerinae) were more likely to attack when a randomly encountered non-nestmate intruder was closer to the nest (Uematsu et al. 2019). In forced encounters, the workers were, likewise, more prone to attack closer to their nests as well as more likely to attack when their colony size was larger (Uematsu et al. 2019). Fire ants, Solenopsis invicta (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae), will defend distinct foraging territories and fight when they encounter one another. In the early stages of a colony, aggression is more limited to raiding in which the ants enter an opponent’s nesting territory to capture immature ants. Raids increased when colonies were located in closer proximity to one another and larger colonies were more likely to engage in raiding than were smaller colonies (Adams and Tschinkel 1995). In desert ants, Cataglyphis fortis (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Formicinae), previous encounters with conspecific non-nestmates increase aggression as does proximity to the nest (Knaden and Wehner 2003). Knaden and Wehner (2004) demonstrated that the perceived distance away from the nest is more important than its actual presence and any associated cues. They trained ants to a feeding site and then moved them to a remote area, where they were allowed to head toward their nests. They were recaptured after they had moved a long or a short distance toward their nests. Those ants who traveled longer, and would have been presumably closer to their nests, were more likely to initiate (threatening with open mandibles) and escalate (biting or spraying formic acid) aggression.\n\nVariation Among Workers\n\nWorkers of Cataglyphis niger (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Formicinae) show variation in size, providing an opportunity to test the effect of size on aggression in these ants (Nowbahari et al. 1999). Smaller workers were more likely to escape than to fight when compared to larger workers. “Ritualized encounters” involving posturing were more common between large sized opponents than small or medium opponents. Paired medium workers showed the highest frequency of biting behavior. Large workers changed their aggressive behavior in response to the size of their opponent, whereas this was not demonstrated in smaller workers. For instance, large workers increased the amount of venom spraying when paired with smaller workers. The authors suggest that the high cost of producing larger workers may result in these workers having greater discrimination abilities as well as the ability to modify aggressive behavior based on the characteristics of their opponent (Nowbahari et al. 1999).\n\nIn the red harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae), variation in aggression differs by task group with aggression toward non-nest mates most common in patrollers (Sturgis and Gordon 2013). In these ants, although belonging to a given task group affected the propensity to fight, aggression was not based on the magnitude of difference in their hydrocarbon profiles. This differs from other studies which showed that aggression is increased among ants with more dissimilar cuticular hydrocarbons (Villalta et al. 2020).\n\nIn Linepithema humile Argentine ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Dolichoderinae), access to required nutrients may cause variation in levels of aggression. Workers able to consume sucrose were more aggressive than those workers who did not have access to sucrose (Grover et al. 2007). Aggression associated with procurement of carbohydrate-rich resources such as hemipteran honeydew may contribute to the success of this invasive species.\n\nIndividuals within the same colony may differ in levels of aggression. Assays of Argentine ants demonstrated that 78% of workers were consistent in being either aggressive or non-aggressive in two successive staged encounters with non-colony conspecifics (Van Wilgenburg et al. 2010). In those individuals who changed behavior from one encounter to the next, it was more common to be a shift from less aggressive to more aggressive. Exposure to strangers apparently lowered the threshold for aggression in subsequent encounters. The effect of experience on aggression may be related to the increased aggression observed in older ants (Van Wilgenburg et al. 2010). A study on Ooceraea (formerly Cerapachys) biroi (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Dorylinae) similarly demonstrated the effects of experience on subsequent behavior (Ravary et al. 2007). Although the focus was on foraging behavior with training that involved either successful or unsuccessful foraging expeditions, the learned outcomes of the experience led to a persistent pattern of behavior and task division within the colony. Further testing is necessary to determine the effects of experience on combat for individual ants.\n\nVariation in levels of aggression among individuals in a colony has been correlated with reproductive success in T. longispinosus (Modlmeier and Foitzik 2011). The authors suggest that colonies with higher variation in this behavioral trait could be more successful due to a division of labor wherein more aggressive individuals defend the nest and less aggressive individuals engage in brood care. However, the authors could not rule out the possibility that good habitat may contribute to the observed increase in reproductive success. Good habitat is associated with an increase in nest density, and, in turn, greater nest density is correlated with higher levels of aggression.\n\nOverall, these studies suggest a model in which workers will usually show the most aggression and participate at higher rates in battles when they could actually be effective in combat, hence the reduced participation of smaller workers or those with lower energy levels. However, very valuable ants, such as young workers (with a high potential lifespan ahead of them) may be held back from combat under normal circumstances, optimizing the resource investment of the colony.\n\nSpatial Distribution and Resource Competition\n\nGenerally speaking, resource competition is likely to result in higher levels of aggression, which has been demonstrated, for example, in Argentine ants when competing for food (Thomas et al. 2005). However, other factors can influence whether combat occurs. In the Mediterranean ant, C. cruentatus, domination of a food source put out by researchers was most often determined by which ants found the resource first (Boulay et al. 2007). Only in a few cases when numbers were similar did combat occur until one colony outnumbered the other. In this species, the foraging areas of different colonies showed substantial overlap.\n\nSpatial distribution of ants within an area can help to reduce aggressive encounters, resulting in uniform spacing to minimize competition (Prather et al. 2018) and mosaics of mutually exclusive territory (Adams 1994, Tanner and Adler 2009). Defense at borders may serve to limit physical combat. Workers of territorial Azteca trigona (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Dolichoderinae) will posture with open mandibles and raised gasters while facing toward neighboring territory (Adams 1990). When workers of either colony cross the gap between territories, they are chased or killed. Posturing plays a similar role in neotropical army ant colonies (Baudier and Pavlic 2020). After encountering ants from other colonies, a temporary wall in which the ants stand side by side may facilitate avoidance and thus, reduce the high cost of combat in these ants. Walling behavior dissipates when the number of encounters with ants from other colonies declines. Displays are also utilized by honey ants, Myrmecocystus nimicus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Formicinae), who upon encountering a high-value food source, will send workers over to a competitor’s nest to engage them in a display tournament that does not include physical fighting (Hölldobler and Lumsden 1980, Lumsden and Hölldobler 1983). However, if the size of the opposing forces is significantly different, the larger colony is more likely to initiate a raid on the opponents’ nest and engage in combat (Lumsden and Hölldobler 1983).\n\nPrather et al. (2018) studied acorn-dwelling Temnothorax (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae) to determine the effect of niche partitioning on reduction of combat encounters (Prather et al. 2018). Competition between conspecific individuals of T. longispinosus and T. curvispinosus for acorns in which to nest results in greater levels of intraspecific aggression than interspecific aggression. Differences in preference for acorn attributes help to reduce competition between the species. Intraspecific aggression was more intense in T. curvispinosus, the species competing for the most specialized niche requirements. Additionally, combat increased when colonies were located in closer proximity, suggesting increased competition for this local, limited resource.\n\nL. niger tend aphids for “honeydew”—a calorically dense resource. Sakata and Katayama (2001) tested aggressiveness of these ants against Formica japonica (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Formicinae), a competitor for aphid resources. Ants were tethered and presented to workers. When presentation occurred in the field while walking alone, the majority of ants did not show aggression. In contrast, when tending aphids or walking on a trail dense with nestmates, the majority of ants responded to the intruders with aggressive behavior (Sakata and Katayama 2001). Given that there tend to be more workers at high-value resources, an aggressive response based on greater numbers of nestmates in the area results in a strategy in which high-value resources are better defended. This notion is supported by studies on Iridomyrmex purpureus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Dolichoderinae) meat ants in which higher-value food was more aggressively defended (Han et al. 2023a).\n\nResource Thievery\n\nA special case of resource competition involves direct theft of food from colonies in a systematic manner. This generally has immediate costs to the receiving colony, loss of food that the colony has already invested energy into obtaining, as opposed to a potential future cost of yielding unexploited territory, which the colony has not spent energy on exploiting. Thus, when considering energy investment, direct theft may be expected to elicit greater resistance when considering similar quantities of food.\n\nSmaller colonies of fungus-growing ants are much more vulnerable to raids on their garden. Megalomyrmex ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Formicinae), for example, are known to usurp these gardens, consume the fungus and brood, and then move on to their next target. In one experimental study, Cyphomyrmex longiscapus fungus-growing ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae) were unable to defend themselves against Megalomyrmex, instead focusing on evacuating their colony and its brood (the attacking Megalomyrmex ants sped up this process by carrying adults from the nest, usually not harming them, but potentially preventing evacuation of consumable larvae) (Adams et al. 2000). Similar results were seen during Gnamptogenys hartmani (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Ectatomminae) attacks on nests of the fungus-growing ants Trachymyrmex (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae) and Sericomyrmex (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae) (Dijkstra and Boomsma 2003).\n\nIn contrast, intermediate target colony sizes were experimentally found to be optimal when examining the slave-making ant Temnothorax americanus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae), which steals larvae from neighboring colonies (Miller 2020). Smaller colonies had too few brood to steal, while larger colonies had too many workers that could potentially fight off or cause heavy casualties for T. americanus.\n\nThief ants, which use their small size to steal and consume brood underground, appear to be an important part of ant ecosystems. Solenopsis ants, for example, represented a large fraction of the total ant biomass in central Florida, and their presence substantially reduced the size of other ant colonies (Ohyama et al. 2020), though it remains unclear how much of this is due to direct combat versus resource depletion.\n\nYamaguchi (1995) examined food stealing by the harvester ant. These have no formal territories, with nests of different colonies in close proximity. Combat occurs frequently between members of this species but is nonlethal, perhaps a more intense form of ritualized posturing. However, attacking ants, usually of the larger colony, will often steal seeds carried by workers near or inside the nests of these workers. In one instance, they also carried out workers and larva, scattering these elsewhere, rather than bringing them back to their own nest. In this case, with lower stakes, the response was also less vigorous, with combat usually remaining nonlethal.\n\nCombat Among Colony Members\n\nTypically, when ants engage in battle, it is with ants from a different colony or even a different species. It is unusual for combat to occur between ants from the same colony. An exception is found in the genus Cardiocondyla (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae). Unlike most ants, Cardiocondyla species produce wingless males, which do not engage in nuptial flights with queens (Stuart et al. 1987). These species have multiple queens in the colony, providing an opportunity for wingless males to mate without having to leave the nest. Wingless males have noticeably stronger mandibles than winged dispersing males and are thus equipped for aggressive competition among the males in the nest.\n\nCardiocondyla wroughtonii produce both winged males who do not fight and wingless males who typically fight to the death such that there is only one per colony. These males often engage in one-on-one combat until one male grips the other for a period that may last for hours. Unlike these protracted contests among adults, the resident wingless males make quick work of young eclosing competitors (Stuart et al. 1987). Cardiocondyla venustula (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae) ants show an intermediate level of aggression among males vying for mating opportunities (Frohschammer and Heinze 2009, Jacobs and Heinze 2017). Older males find and defend territories within the nest which allows greater access to females. Those Cardiocondyla species that do not show male–male aggression have a mating strategy in which many sexually receptive females occur for short periods in large nests, thus resulting in limited opportunities for the males to compete for mating territories (Frohschammer and Heinze 2009, Jacobs and Heinze 2017).\n\nIn addition to the morphological and behavioral differences observed for fighting, differences exist in the pattern of sperm production. Winged males produce sperm early and store them in advance of their relatively short-lived nuptial flights, whereas wingless males produce sperm throughout their lifetime enabling them to mate with multiple queens within the nest (Heinze and Holldobler 1993). This, in turn, increases the likelihood of physical competition among the wingless males over a longer period of time. When greater numbers of queens are present, the colony produces more wingless fighter males (Cremer and Heinze 2002).\n\nFemales may also compete with other females for the purpose of reproduction. In Harpegnathos saltator (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Ponerinae), workers of the same colony will engage in duels after the loss of the queen. During these duels, the workers strike each other with their antennae and although most workers engage for only a short period of time, some continue fighting for months and become gamergates (“pseudoqueens”) with noted changes in molecular, physiological, and behavioral measures (Opachaloemphan et al. 2021). Additionally, brain plasticity was demonstrated. Reproductive workers show reduced brain volumes, but brain volume was regained when the ants were reverted to a non-reproductive state (Penick et al. 2021). In contrast, research on harvester ants, Pogonomyrmex californicus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae), suggests that a lack of fighting among cooperatively nesting queens may be a way to enhance lasting colony survival and growth relative to single-queen colonies (Ostwald et al. 2021).\n\nRecruitment\n\nAn increase in interactions with ants from an opposing colony often leads to an escalation of fighting (Hoover et al. 2016). A positive feedback loop is in play as increased interactions lead to increased recruitment, referring to the ability of a colony to bring more workers to a particular site. This, in turn, increases the probability of interacting with another ant. Two forms of recruitment have been described in this context [with several examples (Holldobler and Wilson 1977, Adams 1994)]. Short-term recruitment occurs after interactions with potential intruders and results in local clustering in the region of encounter. This recruitment involves rapid movements not seen when recruiting for the purpose of foraging. The ants will drag the middle (not rectal) abdomen presumably to lay scents from the sternal gland (Holldobler and Wilson 1977) or pygidial gland (Adams 1994). Long-range recruitment is accomplished by some of the ants who move over a larger area or lay a trail back to the nest. They release pheromones from the rectal gland and then prime responding nestmates with a tactile signal (Holldobler and Wilson 1977, Adams 1990). Recruitment success is tied to combat success. Larger groups of A. trigona won the majority of battles and were more likely to have increased recruiting rates (Adams 1990). When smaller colonies did win, it was correlated with a more rapid recruitment rate allowing for quicker growth in numbers.\n\nHolldobler and Lumsden (1980) explored the effects of territorial structure and behavioral recruitment responses. When neighboring ants were placed within the territory of Oecophylla longinoda (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Formicinae) African weaver ants, recruitment increased dramatically among the resident ants. Weaver ants demonstrated a more vigorous response to specific types of intruders, particularly predator ants or direct competitors for resources close to their nests where a stronger defense can be mounted (Hölldobler and Lumsden 1980). Wilson described minor workers of Pheidole dentata (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae) recruiting both minor and major workers from the nest after encountering intruders (Wilson 1975, 1976). At the site of combat, the major workers (“soldiers”) outnumber the minors (although the reverse is true for the colony at large) and do most of the job of dispatching opponents. A full response is induced when even a single Solenopsis worker is detected, likely since a fire ant invasion poses a serious threat to the Pheidole colony. When the opponent numbers grow, fighting occurs closer to the nest where majors form a tight defense. In the face of defeat, the Pheidole will scatter carrying eggs, larvae, and pupae (Wilson 1975).\n\nCombat Methods\n\nWhen in a fight, ants can use two basic types of attacks. Nearly all ants can make effective use of their mandibles ( ), which can be used for cutting or crushing opponents. Ants will tend to attack enemy weak points, such as eyes, antennae, legs, and the junctions between the head, thorax, and abdomen. The second weapon is venom, which is often dispensed via an abdominal stinger and is a potent weapon in the arsenal of many ant species. This can result in an evolutionary arms race between stronger venom and mechanisms to detoxify it. For instance, the tawny crazy ant, Nylanderia fulva (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Formicinae), secretes a detoxifying substance and spreads it on their cuticle (LeBrun et al. 2014). This substance is useful at reducing the effectiveness of S. invicta fire ant venom, which could explain the displacement of invasive fire ants by invasive tawny crazy ants. Some ants can use venom in a ranged attack, allowing them to inflict damage on an enemy from a distance without immediate risk of injury to themselves. The African myrmicine ant, Crematogaster striatula (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae), can use this method to effectively attack termite nests, and other species of ants were observed to retreat when confronted with this tactical advantage (Rifflet et al. 2011). A more sacrificial tactic is used by Colobopsis ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Formicinae), which explode in combat, covering their foes with toxic substances that can inhibit or kill enemies (Laciny et al. 2018).\n\nOne simple way for ants to improve their combat power is better armor, usually thicker carapaces. For example, Megaponera (formerly Pachycondyla) analis ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Formicinae) may be able to survive attacks by Dorylus rubellus driver ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Dorylinae) by having a sufficiently thick carapace, rendering the driver ant mandible attacks ineffective (Moffett 2010). More unusual armor is also possible, as seen in a recent study on the leafcutter ant, Acromyrmex echinatior (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae), which found that the ants benefit from the development of biomineral armor composed of magnesium calcite (Li et al. 2020). Such armor substantially improved survival during combat. Similarly, improvement of weapons such as mandibles with metals can effectively increase their hardness and sharpness. In the context of cutting leaves, this was seen in Atta cephalotes (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae) (Schofield et al. 2021), though likely such improvements would also increase combat efficiency. Improvement of mandibles would also require fewer metals than increasing armor across the whole carapace. Another way to improve mandibles would be to specialize them for fighting against a particular opponent. This has not been documented thus far, but leafcutters have been observed to produce individuals with variable mandible morphology to enable increased access to different food sources (Püffel et al. 2021), suggesting the possibility that some of this variation may play a role in combat.\n\nIn many species of ants, castes of larger, powerful majors (often termed “soldiers” when they specialize in combat) can provide a significant advantage in battle, particularly when using tactics that combine their strengths with minor workers ( ). In Pheidole pallidula (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae), for instance, minors will work to immobilize enemy ants, and then majors (“soldiers”) will arrive to efficiently deliver the killing blow (Detrain and Pasteels 1992). These valuable colony members, which represent a greater investment for the colony due to their size, are often only mobilized to battle when enemy majors are present or for large-scale battles.\n\nAnother way to preserve colony strength is to attempt to rescue wounded ants, allowing them to later heal and continue to contribute to the colony. M. analis ants were observed to carry back injured nestmates after termite raids and perform wound treatment to avoid infection (Frank et al. 2018). This significantly increased the chance that their nestmates survived and thus reduced the cost to the colony of engaging in battle. Such behavioral adaptations may reduce the threshold required for colonies to undertake potentially resource-intensive behavior, such as raiding colonies of other social insects.\n\nThe need to minimize resource losses during battles can also affect the strategies of ant societies in other ways. Older workers usually undertake the riskier tasks, allowing younger workers to make important contributions in or near the nest, thus extending the average lifespan of workers and maximizing overall productivity (Whitehouse and Jaffe 1996). One study found that fire ants go even further. In staged encounters with ants from another colony, younger workers feigned death, which increased their chance of surviving the encounter (Cassill et al. 2008). In contrast, older workers did not show this behavior and fought the enemy ants. Another possible contributing explanation is that younger workers have a softer exoskeleton (Cassill et al. 2008), which reduces their fighting ability and may prevent them from effectively contributing to a battle.\n\nThe most obvious strategy in a battle is to bring superior numbers to the site of the confrontation (or possible confrontation). In some cases, larger numbers may provide an overwhelming advantage if these numbers can be brought to bear (see section on Lanchester’s laws below). The advantage of higher numbers of workers can be seen in several contexts. For example, prey being taken to nests by larger groups of Formica schaufussi (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Formicinae) was stolen at much lower rates (Traniello and Beshers 1991). The effect of number of combatants in individual encounters was investigated in F. xerophila ants (Tanner 2006). In this study, groups of varying size were placed together, and then a varying number of these were placed in artificial arenas with a food source. F. integroides soldiers, which are somewhat larger than F. xerophila, were also placed in the arena. In general, F. xerophila were substantially more aggressive if initially placed in a large group, even when engaged in subsequent one-versus-one encounters. In such encounters, F. xerophila did not prevail in any fights and were occasionally killed, but in five-versus-five encounters, both species suffered similar average casualty ratios. Observations indicated that F. xerophila used “team-fighting” tactics, ganging up against a single enemy, to substantially increase their combat power ( ).\n\nOn a larger scale, McGlynn (1999) examined the sizes of invasive ants species, concluding that individuals were usually smaller than native ants from the same genus. Examining the data more closely, this size difference was far more common among ants that fought for control of resources. This suggests that investing colony resources in superior numbers rather than larger individual ants could be a successful strategy to win battles between similar ants. Indeed, analyzing at colony size rather than individual size may be a better proxy for combat power, and this “super-organism size” could account for the invasive species’ competitive advantage. Colony size was not assessed in this study, but some reports have noted particularly large invasive colonies, as exemplified by Argentine ants where different colonies can form “supercolonies” that do not fight or compete with each other (Human and Gordon 1996, Holway 1999). Indeed, supercolonies appear to be over-represented among invasive ant species allowing for large group size with decreased intraspecific aggression (Holway et al. 2003, Buczkowski et al. 2023).\n\nNumerical superiority can be negated in siege type warfare, where the fighting space is often limited in underground passages. This can allow a numerically disadvantaged colony to prevail or at least minimize their losses compared to an open field conflict when more combat power can be brought to bear (see Lanchester’s laws section below). Space is often even more limited at ant nest entrances (Baroni Urbani 1998, Fischer et al. 2015), so a common context of battles involves one side trying to deny the other entry. Special techniques can be employed in this situation, such as some species of Cephalotes (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae) and Carebara (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae) ants with flat “plug” heads that block the entrance from invaders (Baroni Urbani 1998, Fischer et al. 2015). In longer-term competition, a unique offensive technique is employed by Dorymyrmex (formerly Conomyrma) bicolor (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Dolichoderinae) against various Myrmecocystus species (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Formicinae) (Möglich and Alpert 1979). This involves dropping small stones into nest entrances, thus temporarily blocking them and substantially inhibiting the colony from carrying out normal operations outside the nest. Siege warfare can occur not only in underground nests, but also in trees (Riginos et al. 2015) where trunks and branches can restrict the number of invading ants able to attack simultaneously, thus allowing defenders to similarly mitigate a numerical disadvantage.\n\nLanchester’s Laws\n\nWith ants generally following a set of rules for their individual behaviors, mathematical modeling of ant wars is practical and can demonstrate well-known principles of combat. The best studied examples involve Lanchester’s laws (Lanchester 1916) ( ), which have previously been reviewed in the context of social animal warfare (Borges 2002, Clifton 2020, Green et al. 2020). Such laws state that combat power is continuously applied by a certain number of individuals with potentially different combat ability. In the “linear” form of Lanchester’s laws, the number of individuals participating in combat is limited by a certain frontage ( ), referring to the width of space over which combat takes place. In this case, the total power of an army is proportional to the combat power of units that can fit at the front (which can be different between species, so the linear law does not necessarily imply one-on-one battles) multiplied by the total number of units (Lanchester 1916). This kind of situation could exist on a battlefield with lots of restricted terrain, such as inside a colony. It could also prevail in open terrain if there is a solid line between the two combatants that cannot easily be crossed by either side to bring more forces to bear on the opponent. In a second “square” form, each individual unit may engage in combat simultaneously, unlimited by frontage of a line or any other restriction ( ) (Lanchester 1916). In this case, the total power of an army is proportional to the combat power of individual units multiplied by the number of individual units squared. Thus, if army A is outnumbered 2:1, its units must inflict damage at four times the rate of individuals in army B for both armies to have equal combat power. This was suggested as an explanation for the success of invasive ants, which are generally smaller than similar native species, thus potentially allowing them to field superior numbers of combatants with the same resources (McGlynn 1999).\n\nTable 2.\n\nSpecies and referenceSystemConclusionAcacia ants (Palmer 2004)Observation with manipulationLinear due to restricted terrainMultiple species (McGlynn 2000)Natural setupLinear due to restricted opening sizeFire ants (Plowes and Adams 2005)Staged fightsLinearWood ants (Batchelor and Briffa 2010)Staged fightsLinear due to many ants remaining unengagedWood ants (Batchelor and Briffa 2011)Staged fightsSquare law closer, but result in betweenTermites (Clifton et al. 2022)Staged fightsSquare law closer, but result in betweenMeat ant (Han et al. 2023b)Staged fights and natural setupSquare lawMeat ant and Argentine ant (Lymbery et al. 2023)Staged fightsLinear, but variable with arena type\n\nLanchester’s laws were first applied to ants by Franks and Partridge (1993), who suggested that ants would try to maximize their relative combat power against an enemy colony. Ants with greater numbers would use battle strategies that maximized the number of units that could simultaneously engage the enemy (resulting in a battle following Lanchester’s square law). Ants with inferior numbers would attempt to limit the battlefield in a manner allowing each side to bring forth only a fraction of their total force, fighting a series of one-on-one combats (and thus, follow Lanchester’s linear model). Army ant colonies, with their high numbers, would be expected to follow the former strategy. Indeed, they have been observed to attack from all possible directions, maximizing the width of the front lines and potentially allowing them to bring greater numbers to the fight (Franks and Partridge 1993). Furthermore, despite the presence of larger, more powerful workers in army ant colonies, the ants participating in these attacks are overwhelmingly medium-sized workers, allowing a greater total number of ants to occupy the front line ( ). Similarly, Whitehouse and Jaffe (1996) found that significantly more soldier class Atta laevigata (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae) were recruited to simulated vertebrate disturbances than to disturbances by other ants, where they were not preferentially recruited. They further observed that in induced battles between Atta colonies, media ants participated in the bulk of the fighting (though this class was similarly responsible for most foraging and thus, initiation of combat). Interestingly, large numbers of minima ants were recruited to the battle site, though these mostly did not participate in the battle, which is not necessarily consistent with predictions from Lanchester’s square law. Slave-making ants, by contrast, usually have significantly inferior numbers compared to their opponents, and thus, they prefer to fight one-on-one battles where their individual superiority becomes more significant (Franks and Partridge 1993). This is accomplished by the use of signaling substances, which disorder the enemy colony, preventing them from using team-fighting tactics to their fullest potential.\n\nThe effect of group size was examined in conflicts between natural populations of acacia ants (Palmer 2004). The study involved four similar species, Crematogaster mimosa, Crematogaster sjostedti, Crematogaster nigriceps (all three Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae), and Tetraponera penzigi (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Pseudomyrmecinae) in a natural setting. Estimated colony size was found to be the most important predictor of success in these battles, but the death count on both sides was approximately equal, consistent with observations that most fights were one-on-one. These findings held true when the number of combatants was varied by preventing some individuals from reaching battle sites. This indicates support for Lanchester’s linear law, which is consistent with the confined terrain in which these battles took place that limited the size of the front line and thus the total combat power that could be brought to bear at one time.\n\nSeveral studies attempted to demonstrate Lanchester’s law by direct experimental manipulation. McGlynn (2000) used a natural environmental setting in Costa Rica. Bait was placed in enclosures with large or small openings, to allow entry of variable numbers of ants, mimicking the situation described in Lanchester’s square or linear laws. Instances where small, medium, or large ants ended up fully controlling the bait food resources were recorded, and it was found that large ants controlled the enclosures with small openings more frequently than smaller ants, in support of Lanchester’s linear law. However, the complicated experimental situation makes the conclusions of this study less firm, with foraging success and dynamic modulation of aggression potentially having a larger effect than potential combat, particularly given the small total numbers involved.\n\nAnother experimental study by Plowes and Adams (2005) attempted to test the application of Lanchester’s laws to fire ant battles. Size-controlled ants from different colonies were mixed in isolated containers, and the casualties were counted at the end of the resulting 24-h battle. In this study, the linear law was found to be a better match to the data than the square law, indicating that the groups of ants were not able to bring their full potential combat power to a confrontation due to the battlefield’s geometry. However, individual fighting quality was also estimated simultaneously (and varied widely, even between similarly sized ants), which may have confounded the analysis, since several combinations of fighting quality and geometry parameter (which could be linear, square, or the space in between) could produce similar outcomes. The authors did attempt to control for this by mixing ants at several ratios for each group. It is also unclear how the artificial “staged fight” setups of this and similar studies represent actual confrontations in natural settings when ants may use recruitment to more readily bring greater numbers to bear in a fight.\n\nBatchelor and Briffa (2010) investigated the applications of Lanchester’s laws to wood ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Formicinae) battles measuring the individual body size, number, and energy levels (as measured by sugar concentration in individuals) of each side in staged combats. They found that a group containing individuals with greater individual body mass was more likely to inflict the first casualty on the enemy, while group size and energy levels did not significantly affect this. However, this outcome measure may not be suitable for investigating the long-term outcome of battles, particularly in natural conditions, since larger size may be dominant in artificial encounters where ants are less able to use higher numbers (or bring them to bear quickly), putting a premium on individual fighting strength. A follow-up study by the same authors also examined staged conflicts in wood ants, obtaining several pictures of each fight for analysis (Batchelor and Briffa 2011). Larger groups here were actually able to bring greater numbers to bear in a fight, but they also had a larger fraction of unengaged individuals than smaller groups. Combat performance, as measured by enemy casualties, was improved with increasing individual body mass and, to a lesser extent, higher group size, potentially indicating weak support for Lanchester’s square law, or at least some level of group-size effect beyond linear.\n\nA recent study investigated termite battles at multiple ratios in petri dishes, also tracking the progress of the battle’s course as it occurred, rather than relying only on final casualty estimates (Clifton et al. 2022). Though not ants, termites tend to move and fight like ants in similar social colonies, making the lessons from this study potentially broadly applicable to considerations for ants. Based on analysis of these staged termite battles, Lanchester’s square law provided a better match for the results than the linear law, but the stronger army still had somewhat less combat power than predicted by the square law. Additionally, closer investigation revealed that substantial portions of both armies, even if equally sized, remained unengaged in the battle. This was counterbalanced by the fact that two or more termites ganging up on a single enemy are able to inflict much higher damage than termites involved in one-versus-one confrontations. Evidence from other sources supports this notion (le Moli and Parmigiani 1981, Powell and Clark 2004, Tanner 2006, Clifton et al. 2022), making it a potentially important consideration for modeling of ant battles.\n\nOne-on-one battles of the meat ant I. purpureus showed no relationship between the outcome of the fight and the size of the worker (Han et al. 2023b). This may have been due to small differences in worker size, but more likely, the statistical power of the study simply was not enough to detect size-level differences. This was partially because only a small fraction of worker conflicts had a clear winner. In competitions over food between colonies of the same species, the larger colony usually prevailed, though in some cases, there was still no clear winner, with both colonies retaining access to the food. This potentially implies that both colonies could cease fighting if the cost would likely be high compared to the benefit of accessing a single food source. Average worker size in these colony-level conflicts also had no effect.\n\nMost recently, various combinations of army size and individual unit strength were assessed both computationally and experimentally. Using a computer game, the authors found that an army with strong units tended to prevail over larger armies more frequently in complex battlefields, defined as having more patches of terrain that would prevent movement of individuals (Lymbery et al. 2023). Based on Lanchester’s laws, this was the expected result. The restricted terrain limited the number of units that could be engaged more severely, pushing the result more closely to the linear law, where army size gave less advantage. The authors also experimentally tested combat between the larger meat ant I. purpureus and the smaller Argentine ant L. humile. Though the variance in outcome was high, their results were similar to the simulations, with restricted terrain improving the outcome for the stronger meat ants. This study generally supports the notion that restricted terrain leads to outcomes predicted by Lanchester’s laws, with restricted terrain limiting the number of individuals that can engage simultaneously and thus favoring armies with strong individuals. However, the quantitative details of both the simulations and experiments do not support the use of the square law in open terrain, giving an outcome close to that mathematically predicted by Lanchester’s linear law. The authors note that this was partially due to nonbattle deaths, but other factors could also have influenced it, such as the units using a somewhat linear formation in the open engagements (preventing all units for the side with greater numbers from engaging until they move around the sides of the line), or simply there not being enough physical space for all units to engage, even if the units from the side with smaller numbers are completely isolated from each other.\n\nOverall, these studies suggest that Lanchester’s laws provide a good starting point for analysis of large-scale ant battles, but they may fall short for accurately approximating and understanding outcomes ( ). Perhaps most importantly, further studies should attempt to avoid artificially staged encounters, or at least present them in semi-natural situations, such as induced battles between natural or laboratory colonies, rather than simply mixing various combinations of ants together. Though allowing more natural behavior to be observed, this could be difficult in practice, since an ant colony at a severe disadvantage (such as one dependent on Lanchester’s square law) would be substantially less likely to engage in a full-scale battle unless their colony was under attack, and even then, they would need to be able to mount a coherent defense quickly enough for the subsequent battle to be easy to interpret mathematically. In general, there would be large evolutionary pressure to avoid the consequences of being highly outnumbered in Lanchester’s square law, with retreat and other measures such as colony abandonment that could still carry negative consequences often being preferable to losing a large force without being able to inflict significant damage in return.\n\nThere is also much room for improvement in the models themselves. Adams and Mesterton-Gibbons (2003) considered that Lanchester’s law in the pure linear or square forms was unlikely to capture the true dynamics of combat in social groups, and they developed modifications to address certain perceived issues. Particularly, the square law was thought to overestimate the advantage accrued from possessing numerical superiority, with the actual value falling between the linear and square laws. The recent study of termite combat in a laboratory environment by Clifton et al. (2022) supports this notion. Adams and Mesterton-Gibbons (2003) further argue that individuals with higher fighting power are not only able to inflict more damage, but also are able to suffer more damage before being incapacitated. This can potentially be modeled with the current form because “fighting quality” is essentially a constant representing the attacking power of one type versus the defense strength of the other type. However, when attempting comparisons between three or more species, this awkward use of ratios breaks down. Thus, going even further, we propose that future work could also incorporate not just fighting quality, but a separate and independently varying “toughness” quality, allowing models to better simulate interspecific confrontations, or those between different castes. This would allow representations of situations, for example, where large ants with thick cuticles are highly resistant to damage, but still not able to contribute much more attacking power than smaller ants. However, it should be noted that for some ant species, attacking power and toughness may still not be constant when considering all possible opponents, with the possibility, for example, of “paper-rock-scissors” advantages between three types that could not be explained by fixed model parameters.\n\nFor situations with linear or close to linear geometry, the width (the space needed by an individual to engage in combat) should be considered, which could vary substantially between species and castes of different sizes. In such cases, smaller ants are already thought to be better front-line fighters due to their greater numbers, but the increased advantage of ganging up on an enemy may further amplify this consideration. However, it should be noted that for species with castes of substantially different size, maximum combat power could potentially be brought to bear if different castes are able to co-occupy the front line without substantial interference due to their different heights. Finally, maximum fidelity could potentially be obtained by quantifying the specific proportions of ants that are unengaged, engaged in one-on-one battles, engaged against multiple opponents, and engaged together with comrades against a single opponent, with variable damage output in each of these situations. These could be potentially complex functions of total numbers on each side as well as battlefield geometry. Such considerations could replace Lanchester’s laws at the cost of greater difficulty in obtaining these measurements.\n\nOther Mathematical Models of Combat\n\nWhile most mathematical modeling of ant combat has been based around Lanchester’s laws, other frameworks may be more appropriate in some instances (Green et al. 2020). The earliest instance of such work examined the evolution of giant colony size in Dorylus army ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Dorylinae) compared to Eciton army ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Dorylinae) with a more modest colony size (Boswell et al. 2001). In their model of colony success, large colony size was particularly important for fighting power with intraspecific colonies, which was far more common in Dorylus due to the greater density of these ants. It also accounted for the propensity of Dorylus colonies to divide asymmetrically, preserving combat power in the main colony, compared to Eciton colonies, which undergo more symmetric colony fission.\n\nA model for fights between Lasius paralienus and invasive Lasius neglectus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Formicinae) was developed based on a framework for modeling spatially explicit chemical reactions and repurposed to represent ants in battle (Santarlasci et al. 2014). It was then compared to staged fights in arenas. Of note, since this study was agent-based, it could better predict how individuals meet and interact compared to simpler Lanchester-based models. The study drew attention to the high level of variance in outcomes compared to more commonly used deterministic predictions.\n\nTetramorium immigrans pavement ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae) establish territories based on many extended battles with low mortality between neighboring colonies. One study built several models of recruitment to battle sites inspired by field observations of such ants (Adler et al. 2018). Larger colonies were found to be able to hold more territory per worker, possibly due to the ability to recruit superior numbers to a battle site. However, smaller colonies could still hold nearby territories due to reduced travel time from the nest to the battle site, which provides an advantage in recruitment ( ).\n\nAnother study also modeled abstract ant battles with individual-based simulations (Adams and Plowes 2019). Based on several rules involving recruitment and search patterns, three types of battles were predicted: those in which the fighting group occupy an oval area, those with elongated shapes when ants search along trails, and linear battles when fighting ants physically block those from either side from passing, forming a line of increasing width as more ants start fighting. The fighting area usually moves toward the colony that is at a local disadvantage, quickly in battles along trails and slowly for linear battles. Smaller colonies were usually at a disadvantage, but they could make up for this by recruiting more efficiently. In most cases, battles were resolved quickly when one side obtained an early advantage, but some struggles were more drawn out with higher casualties.\n\nMathematical modeling of ant fights has also generally been narrowly focused on considerations of fully engaged individuals. However, more could potentially be learned by taking cues from well-understood aspects of human conflict at the strategic level. These could include the objective of combat as well as logistical aspects of conflict. For example, an ant colony with inferior numbers and individual fighting quality could potentially still win an engagement if it is able to bring its full numbers to bear more quickly than its opponent, thus defeating the enemy in detail by always substantially outnumbering them at the point of conflict. An isolated battle for a distant food source would also produce substantially different reinforcement patterns than a battle around a nest, or a moving battle between colonies.\n\nOther Studies\n\nWe here review several other research studies on ant battles that do not fall solidly into one of our previous topic categories. These are sorted by interesting focal species and together represent the remainder of the current literature in the field.\n\nArmy ants often specialize in honing in on the odors of specific prey species (Manubay and Powell 2020), representing a major danger to even large colonies of other types of ants. Indeed, some of the largest ant battles occur when leafcutter ants engage army ants. In one observation, Nomamyrmex esenbeckii ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Dorylinae) attacked an A. cephalotes nest (Swartz 1998). This occurred by a single stream of army ants on the move, and it was quickly met by a force of leafcutter majors, barricading some nest entrances and forming a defensive ring. These were individually removed by army ants, which then penetrated the nest and apparently continued fighting underground, removing several larvae from the nest. A few days later after eliminating the leafcutter ant colony, the army ants exited the nest. Several thousand dead ants on both sides of the battle were observed. Another study reported similar observations, noting also that both sides of this conflict used team-fighting tactics to bring down opponents (Powell and Clark 2004). In these cases, a major would be the main combatant, with smaller ants providing assistance by immobilizing opponent legs. Looking at several raids, Powell and Clark (2004) also reported that in many cases, larger leafcutter colonies could successfully repel the army ant attack, usually when they could form a quick response to the invasion while it was still in early stages and had not penetrated deep into the colony. Complete elimination of the leafcutter ant colony was uncommon, even for small colonies. Subterranean raids were also observed against the fungus-growing Trachymyrmex arizonensis ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae) by Neivamyrmex rugulosus army ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Dorylinae) (LaPolla et al. 2002). In these cases, the T. arizonensis evacuated some of their brood when the army ants approached. Pheidole big-headed ants, on the other hand, employ strategies led by their super-major workers against various species of Neivamyrmex army ants (Huang 2010). Initially, major workers, with assistance from minors, fight outside the nest, possibly to delay an approaching army ant column. Then, recruited super-majors attempt to block the nest entrance with their characteristic large heads. In one event, big-headed ant workers of all types counterattacked the army ants after the army ants had retreated from the nest entrance. An attack on the army ant trail disrupted potential army ant reinforcements, eventually leading to abandonment of the raid. Not all ants fight defensively against army ants, however. Red tree ants (O. longinoda) were observed to remove individual medium-sized Anomma driver ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Dorylinae) from their columns, killing and consuming them in groups (Gotwald 1972).\n\nWith their large colony size and specialized food source, mature leafcutter ant colonies rarely fight against different species, save for colony defense against army ants or large predators. However, one report described Paraponera clavate (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Paraponerinae), which nest in or near trees that are also their foraging site, defending these trees against the leafcutter A. cephalotes (Wetterer 1994). The P. clavate attacked a leafcutter foraging column, first carefully removing and killing individuals from its outer defense and then proceeding to launch a massed attack against the foraging column itself, which was successful in driving off the leaf-cutter column. Battles between leafcutter ants are more common, with each establishing defended territories. Survival and growth of small colonies tended to be severely curtailed when closer to large colonies (Jofre et al. 2022). However, it was unclear what proportion of this effect was from indirect resource competition, as opposed to direct aggression.\n\nWars among the wood ant Formica polyctena (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Formicinae) have been the subject of several studies due to high intraspecific aggression (Moli and Parmigiani 1982). One extensive investigation tracked several colonies over a large dune area in the Netherlands (Mabelis 1978, 1984). In spring, many battles lasting up to several days took place between these wood ant colonies, especially during warmer weather. Dead enemy ants were consumed, and larger colonies gained more territory during these encounters. During summer and fall, less aggression was observed, likely due to smaller territory size during summer and lower protein requirements in the fall compared to the spring when new colonies are produced. A follow-up study indicated that other wood ants represented 86% of one colony’s prey intake during spring (Driessen et al. 1984). Of note, one colony was observed to battle two others simultaneously. If being in such a strategically disadvantageous position is common, future studies could potentially investigate how colonies respond to such situations. Another species of wood ant, Formica aquilonia (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Formicinae), is usually more peaceful, though aggression appears to substantially increase in logged areas (Sorvari and Hakkarainen 2004), possibly due to the need to secure more limited resources in these damaged, less productive habitats.\n\nThe Argentine ant, L. humile, is highly invasive on multiple continents, displacing many native species in part due to their superior combat capacity (Angulo et al. 2024). In a Northern California study, Argentine ants often consumed new winged queens of rivals, and they won the majority of battles with native ant species, eventually displacing them from a portion of the study area (Human and Gordon 1996). Though not individually superior to native ants, their colonies usually had a substantial advantage from superior numbers (Holway 1999) and initiated more aggressive encounters (Human and Gordon 1999, Zee and Holway 2006). This large colony size can be partially explained by the formation of supercolonies, separate but sufficiently genetically close Argentine ant colonies that do not engage in conflict with each other (Thomas et al. 2006). A recent study examined interactions between Tapinoma nigerrimum ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Dolichoderinae) and Argentine ants in the Mediterranean (Leonetti et al. 2019). Based on their local dominance, observed competitive exclusion with Argentine ants, and ability to be invasive in other environments, T. nigerrimumare was thought to potentially have the capacity to slow Argentine ant invasions. However, it was found that T. nigerrimum were substantially less aggressive than Argentine ants, which attacked to control food resources and invaded T. nigerrimum colonies. Invasive Argentine ants even appear capable of displacing other invasive ant species, such as big-headed ants in Bermuda (Wetterer 2017) and fire ants in the United States (LeBrun et al. 2007).\n\nConclusions\n\nOverall, ant battles remain understudied, perhaps because this topic lies at an intersection of the fields of ecology, evolution, animal behavior, mathematical modeling, and conservation biology. Yet, the tractable nature of these systems combined with their intrinsically high interest levels among both scientists and the general public means that at least some studies have been undertaken regularly since at least the 1970s (see reference list), with 7 publications in the 1970s, 8 in the 80s, and now reaching over 30 per decade. These initially were observational in nature, but increasingly have made use of models and experimental manipulation, combining different techniques for a more rigorous analysis. This research has revealed many interesting components of ant interactions, ranging from the individual-based decision-making characteristics of colonies to battle strategy and tactics, and even attempts to understand the outcomes of battles from a quantitative and statistical perspective.\n\nAside from intrinsic interest in these topics, research on ant fighting can potentially provide useful knowledge to other fields, such as similar competition among termites (Tuma et al. 2020, Clifton et al. 2022) or even battles among larger animals such as groups of mammals that are less tractable to study and manipulate experimentally compared to ant colonies (Wilson et al. 2002, Green et al. 2022). In such battles, individual leaders could potentially change outcomes compared to conflict in insect societies, particularly in decisions of whether or not to retreat in various circumstances. Another area where this research can be useful is for conservation purposes. By understanding the competitive advantage of invasive ant species over their native counterparts, strategies to counteract these invasions could perhaps be more easily devised or optimized. In regions where local ants offer more competition, for example, less intensive control measures may be needed, and even gene drive-based methods would enjoy more success (Liu et al. 2023), which may be particularly important for haplodiploid species (including all ants) where suppressive power is lower (Liu and Champer 2022). Examining the decisions of individual ants in complex combat environments could prove useful for studying human conflicts from an historical perspective. In ancient warfare, humans would often be involved in melee combat, and the losing army was usually the first where soldiers disregarded commanders’ orders and fled the battlefield. This would often be done with information from only a limited segment of a battlefield, more akin to how ants would make decisions on when to retreat from a battle. Studies on ant warfare may even have implications for weapons development in matters such as conflicts between semi-autonomous drones. For example, when would a “bottom–up” approach that ants or drones might use run into deficiencies that could be improved with a minimum of “top-down” coordination? Conversely, analysis of human combat strategies to avoid some disadvantages of being outnumbered (and the attendant consequences of Lanchester’s square law) may shed light on ant behavior in similar situations. Perhaps ant nests may have some defense features similar to castles or other fortifications in species at high risk of colony raids.\n\nLooking toward future research in this area, there are many species that have not been examined at all in the context of ant fights. These are likely to employ many interesting tactics, weapons, and other innovations that have yet to be discovered, perhaps particularly so in the context of evolutionary arms races. Another major area of future work could be increasing the fidelity of quantitative models, both for how a colony allocates its resources, choosing when and where to fight, and also for the battles themselves. Such advanced models could still be derived from Lanchester’s laws. With studies of conflict in ants still in their infancy, the many pathways for future research promise to be richly rewarding.\n\nContributor Information\n\nJackson Champer, Center for Bioinformatics and Center for Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.\n\nDebra Schlenoff, Department of Biology, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, USA.\n\nFunding\n\nJ.C. was supported by laboratory startup funds from Peking University and the Center for Life Sciences, the SLS-Qidong Innovation Fund, and the NSFC Overseas Youth Fund.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nJackson Champer (Conceptualization [Equal], Investigation [Equal], Writing—original draft [Equal], Writing—review & editing [Equal]), and Debra Schlenoff (Conceptualization [Equal], Investigation [Equal], Writing—original draft [Equal], Writing—review & editing [Equal])"
