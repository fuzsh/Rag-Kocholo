In this study, soil physicochemical properties, and ant community diversity and functional characteristics were compared between experimental plots with and without biochar application. No significant differences in soil (soil physicochemical properties) or ants (ant community richness, species abundance, and morphological characteristics) were observed between the two plots before biochar application.

Biochar application promoted Cardiocondyla nuda (by 426%) and Formica japonica abundance (by 93%), but decreased Solenopsis invicta invasive ant species richness (by 54%), consistent with the fact that changes in soil properties were more beneficial to the former two species. In addition, in biochar-treated plots, F. japonica and S. invicta generally showed larger body size (18% and 6.7%), larger eyes (2.7% and 4.0%), and longer femurs (6.3% and 7.9%), which enabled them to respond better to potential barriers, such as plants. Our results highlighted that, besides species abundance and community structure, certain ant functional morphological indicators were also informative in evaluating biochar ecological implications.",
