        "meta_description": "Background In populations of most social insects, gene flow is maintained through mating between reproductive individuals from different colonies in periodic nuptial flights followed by dispersal of the fertilized foundresses. Some ant species, however, form large polygynous supercolonies, in which mating takes place within the maternal nest (intranidal mating) and fertilized queens disperse within or along the boundary of the supercolony, leading to supercolony growth (colony budding). As a consequence, gene flow is largely confined within supercolonies. Over time, such supercolonies may diverge genetically and, thus, also in recognition cues (cuticular hydrocarbons, CHC's) by a combination of genetic drift and accumulation of colony-specific, neutral mutations.  Methodology/Principal Findings We tested this hypothesis for six supercolonies of the invasive ant Anoplolepis gracilipes in north-east Borneo. Within supercolonies, workers from different nests tolerated each other, were closely related and showed highly similar CHC profiles. Between supercolonies, aggression ranged from tolerance to mortal encounters and was negatively correlated with relatedness and CHC profile similarity. Supercolonies were genetically and chemically distinct, with mutually aggressive supercolony pairs sharing only 33.1%±17.5% (mean ± SD) of their alleles across six microsatellite loci and 73.8%±11.6% of the compounds in their CHC profile. Moreover, the proportion of alleles that differed between supercolony pairs was positively correlated to the proportion of qualitatively different CHC compounds. These qualitatively differing CHC compounds were found across various substance classes including alkanes, alkenes and mono-, di- and trimethyl-branched alkanes.  Conclusions We conclude that positive feedback between genetic, chemical and behavioural traits may further enhance supercolony differentiation through genetic drift and neutral evolution, and may drive colonies towards different evolutionary pathways, possibly including speciation.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn most social insect species, a colony is a closed family unit that contains a queen and her daughter workers [1]. The queen lays eggs, which are cared for and reared by the workers. As the colony reaches maturity, males and virgin queens are produced which mate with reproductives from other colonies in periodic mating events. Soon after copulation, the males die while the fertilized queens disperse in an attempt to independently found new colonies. As a consequence of this strategy, gene flow among colonies is maintained within the population.\n\nSocial insects such as ants, however, show a large variety in social organization, reproductive systems, mating behaviour and dispersal modes. Some tramp ant species such as Linepithema humile [2], Pheidole megacephala [3], Wasmannia auropunctata [4], Lasius neglectus [5] or Anoplolepis gracilipes [6] share a similar set of strategies: They form large polydomous, highly polygynous supercolonies, within which aggression is absent and individuals move freely between nests [7]. Supercolonies differ from other polygynous and polydomous ant colonies, in that they are usually too large to allow direct cooperative interactions of individuals from distant nests [8]. In contrast to most other ant species, nuptial flights of supercolony-forming ant species are rare or even absent, and mating often takes place within the nest or the supercolony. After fertilization, queens stay within the maternal nest, move to other nests within the supercolony or disperse at the fringe of the supercolony through budding, i.e. the occupation of a suitable nest by one or several queens that are accompanied by workers and sometimes brood from the colony the queens themselves originated from. As a consequence of these mating and dispersal strategies, gene flow between supercolonies may be extremely limited or absent, as has been pointed out by studies on L. humile [2], [8], [9] and A. gracilipes [10]. The study by Thomas et al. [10] strongly suggests that gene flow is absent between two sympatric and mutually aggressive A. gracilipes supercolonies on Christmas Island, Indian Ocean. The two supercolonies were genetically differentiated both in nuclear and mitochondrial loci. Furthermore, intranidal mating in A. gracilipes can be frequently observed (in laboratory colonies of A. gracilipes) and workers are highly aggressive towards virgin queens and males from other supercolonies (Drescher, Feldhaar, pers. obs.), suggesting that gene flow among supercolonies may be prevented by behavioural barriers. As a consequence, lack of gene flow between ant colonies should lead to genetic differentiation among them.\n\nNestmate recognition in ants usually relies on cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC's) [11], [12], [13], [14], [15] although other substance classes can also be involved, such as fatty acids [16]. CHC's are largely genetically determined [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], which implies that genetic differentiation among sympatric ant colonies may entail the diversification of genetically based CHC profile compounds through genetic drift and the accumulation of supercolony-specific mutations. Thus, in ant species with strict intranidal mating, CHC-profiles may differ between colonies not only in terms of relative abundances of epicuticular compounds (quantitative differences, as is the case in most ant species with intercolonial mating), but also in the composition of the profile itself (qualitative differences).\n\nAs the origin and future of supercoloniality in ants is unclear [22], studying the degree and nature of differentiation within and between supercolonies may help in understanding the evolutionary paths that those species might take [22]. We thus measured patterns of behavioural, genetic and chemical differentiation within and between six spatially separated supercolonies in north-eastern Borneo, and discuss the data with respect to potential evolutionary trajectories of A. gracilipes. As suggested by previous studies, NE-Borneo is inhabited by a mosaic of variably related, ecologically dominant A. gracilipes supercolonies [23], [24] with unusually high intracolonial relatedness estimates compared to all other supercolonial ant species studied so far [22], [24]. Thus, assuming that the scenario described above applies to A. gracilipes, we expect that the varying genetic differentiation between supercolonies corresponds to the degree of CHC-profile differentiation. As intranidal mating may be the dominant, if not exclusive, reproductive strategy in A. gracilipes, we furthermore expect that CHC-profiles differ both quantitatively as well as qualitatively between supercolonies, and that qualitative differences between the CHC-profiles of supercolonies are independent of substance classes as would be expected by an accumulation of random, supercolony-specific mutations.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe present study revealed a significant positive correlation of aggression with differentiation of the cuticular hydrocarbon profile as well as genetic differentiation among sympatric supercolonies of the Yellow Crazy Ant Anoplolepis gracilipes in a study site in NE-Borneo. Intercolonial aggression varied among supercolony pairs, ranging from tolerance to mortal encounters in the bioassays. Mutually aggressive supercolonies were distantly related and showed highly differentiated CHC profiles, while two non-aggressive though spatially separated supercolonies were found to have highly similar CHC profiles and relatedness values that were comparable to those found within supercolonies. Similar patterns have been observed in the Argentine Ant Linepithema humile, where mutually tolerant supercolonies from different locations (even from different continents) can be highly similar in genetic and chemical terms, and are thus thought to have been introduced from the same source population [33], [34], [35]. Likewise, supercolonies that are highly differentiated in genetic and chemical terms (even if they are close to each other geographically) are thought to have been introduced from different source populations [36], [37]. Hence, the varying degrees of behaviour as well as genetic and chemical differentiation that we observed in A. gracilipes in this study may potentially be explained by the same mechanisms, i.e. supercolony pairs P1-P2 and P3-P4 may have been introduced from the same source population whereas supercolonies P5 and P6 may have been introduced from yet another population, respectively. Alternatively, two tolerant supercolonies may belong to the same supercolony separated by uninhabitable terrain (very likely for the pair P1-P2 which was separated by only 150 m) or one supercolony in a tolerant supercolony pair may have originated from the other through via human-mediated jump-dispersal within the study site (possibly true for P3-P4).\n\nCuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles have repeatedly been shown to enable ants to discriminate between nestmates and non-nestmates [12], [13], [15]. Typically, differing CHC profiles lead to aggression while similar CHC profiles do not. Aggressive responses towards individuals bearing allocolonial CHC profiles may be evoked according to a threshold rule (e.g. Cataglyphis iberica) or may be gradual (e.g. Myrmica rubra) (reviewed in [38]). The positive correlation between CHC profile dissimilarity and aggression that we observed between individuals from different supercolonies in A. gracilipes may suggest the existence of a graded response mechanism, which has also been found in other invasive ant species such as Lasius neglectus [5], Wasmannia auropunctata [39] and Linepithema humile [14], [40], [41].\n\nSupercolonies of A. gracilipes showed both quantitative and qualitative differences in their CHC profiles across various types of hydrocarbons (Fig. 4, Table S4). This is remarkable since in most ant species, CHC profiles tend to differ quantitatively between conspecific colonies and qualitatively between species [15], [42], [43]. For instance, 14 out of 41 epicuticular compounds differed qualitatively between the CHC profiles of six Formica species (Formica sensu stricto) in a study by Martin et al. [44], if the same threshold was applied as in our study. In comparison, 16 out of 30 substances differed qualitatively between the profiles of six different supercolonies of A. gracilipes in our study. On occasion, high degrees of qualitative differences between CHC profiles of colonies from non-invasive ant species have been reported, but analyses either include all substances (including trace substances, e.g. [43]) or qualitative differences are only detected in one substance class, e.g. homologous series of (Z)-9-alkenes or positional isomers of dimethyl-branched C25-bodies [45]. In invasive ant species, qualitative differences between CHC profiles of different supercolonies have repeatedly been found, e.g. between invasive and native populations of Linepithema humile [35] and Wasmannia auropunctata [39]. CHC profiles were found to be less complex in introduced areas, with substances having been lost from the profiles in comparison to colonies in the native range [39]. However, supercolonies of Linepithema humile also differ in their CHC profiles in the invasive range [41].\n\nHere, we found unusually high degrees of qualitative differences between CHC profiles of different supercolonies of A. gracilipes. We identified 30 major CHC compounds that accounted for at least 1% of the entire CHC profile and found qualitative differences in compounds that accounted for up to 8.21% of the profiles of different A. gracilipes supercolonies. The qualitatively differing substances comprised different compound classes such as alkanes, alkenes, methyl-branched alkenes as well as mono-, di- and trimethyl-branched alkanes of varying chain length (Fig. 4), as would be expected if supercolonies diverge in a drift-like process of neutral evolution.\n\nIn our study, genetic distances corresponded to chemical distances between colonies, as has been observed in several other studies on various social insect species [5], [46], [47], [48]. The correlation between differentiation in CHC profile and differentiation in microsatellite loci in A. gracilipes suggests that cuticular hydrocarbons are to a large extent genetically determined in this species as is in many other ant species [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], albeit environmental cues may also be involved [49], [50].\n\nHelanterä et al. suggested that unicoloniality (the ability of ant species to form populations consisting of one or more supercolonies [8], [22]), might be an evolutionary dead-end [22], since selfish behaviour of distantly related nestmates should lead to supercolony instability as predicted by kin-selection theory. This view is supported by the scattered distribution of unicoloniality in the ant phylogeny as well as the fact that no unicolonial ant species has a sister species that is also unicolonial [22]. In contrast to other supercolonial ant species such as L. humile and S. invicta, however, workers in A. gracilipes supercolonies are closely related [22], [23], and thus selfish behaviour is less likely to evolve.\n\nDespite this potential evolutionary dead-end, the limited or even absent gene flow between supercolonies of unicolonial ant species [2], [8], [9], [10] may be conducive to speciation [22]. As speciation occurs on timescales beyond reach for current research, indirect approaches are the only way to find clues regarding that question, e.g. by measuring how much supercolonies have diverged in neutral or selected traits [22]. As we have shown, A. gracilipes supercolonies are indeed differentiated in neutral traits, i.e. alleles of microsatellite loci and several cuticular compounds. Regardless of the origin of this initial differentiation that we see today, one should expect both the genetic and chemical differentiation to increase in the prolonged absence of gene flow between supercolonies. Although we cannot infer absence of gene flow directly, the sociogenetic structure of the supercolonies in NE-Borneo resembles that of the supercolonies found on Christmas Island, where gene flow among the two supercolonies can be excluded based on mitochondrial and microsatellite markers [10]. In addition, behavioural characteristics of A. gracilipes, such as intranidal mating soon after eclosion of female reproductives (pers. obs.) and aggression towards allocolonial sexuals by workers (Table S1), suggest that mating is non-random, resulting in strongly reduced or absent gene flow between supercolonies. Similar patterns (intranidal mating, limited or absent intercolonial gene flow) have been reported for the likewise invasive ant Linepithema humile both in its native [8], [48] and invasive range [2], [9], [51].\n\nThe initial differences that would be necessary in order for subsequent differentiation between neighbouring supercolonies to occur are likely to accumulate in allopatry, e.g. if supercolonies stem from different source populations or if supercolonies are divided into two or more fragments through human-mediated jump dispersal. In the latter scenario, lack of contact zones (and thus mating) between the resulting allopatric fragments is likely to lead to accumulation of colony (or fragment-) specific mutations and CHC compounds. If both fragments come into secondary contact again, genetic and chemical differentiation may have advanced enough to result in mutual aggression and lack of gene flow. This pattern was very recently described for Linepithema humile supercolonies from Corsica and the European mainland, where the introduction of one or several L. humile propagules from the mainland to Corsica likely entailed an interruption of gene flow between Corsican and European supercolonies, resulting in the pronounced chemical and behavioural differentiation observable today [52]. This scenario may also explain parts of our data, as supercolonies P3 and P4 are likely to be established fragments of the same supercolony which have already accumulated supercolony-specific alleles and cuticular compounds despite still tolerating each other (Tables S3 and S5). Over time, the spatial separation (allopatry) of the two supercolonies P3 and P4 should facilitate increasing genetic and chemical differentiation, which in turn should lead to mutual aggression as soon as CHC profiles are sufficiently different. Furthermore, genetic and chemical differentiation should also entail behavioural suppression of intercolonial gene flow through worker aggression against allocolonial sexuals even if they came into contact again (e.g. as a result of range expansion).\n\nThus, we suggest that the combination of exclusive intranidal mating and budding on the one hand and positive feedback between genetic, chemical and behavioural traits on the other hand may drive supercolonies towards ever increasing differentiation, possibly even involving reproductive isolation and thus, speciation. In contrast to the majority of ant species, A. gracilipes supercolonies are characterized by a combination of traits (polygyny, intranidal mating, and lack of active dispersal other than budding) that ensure the continuous production of generation upon generation of reproductives that all stay within the supercolony. Coupled with an unusual reproductive system that may potentially avoid the negative effects of inbreeding depression [23], the extreme polygyny and polydomy of A. gracilipes immensely reduces the risk of a breakdown of the entire supercolony, resulting in virtual immortality of the supercolony superorganism. Furthermore, in eusocial species with strict intranidal mating, a colony-specific signal should be sufficient for recognition between the sexes and thus, selection towards a species-specific signal that allows recognition between sexes from different supercolonies should be relaxed [53]. In concert with the virtual immortality of A. gracilipes supercolonies, relaxed selection towards a species-specific signal may even lead to a complete breakdown of intraspecific recognition between sexuals from different colonies, potentially leading to prezygotic, reproductive isolation. This, in turn, implies that different A. gracilipes supercolonies would no longer belong to the same species according to the biological concept of species, which states that species are groups of interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups [54]. Currently it is unclear whether different A. gracilipes supercolonies should be perceived as belonging to the same species, as apparent lack of random mating between sexuals from different supercolonies, intranidal mating and aggression of workers towards allocolonial sexuals may already pose a sufficient barrier preventing intercolonial gene flow. Thus, we argue that intercolonial differentiation may potentially result in reproductive barriers between colonies, ultimately leading to independent units on different evolutionary trajectories, and thus possibly speciation between neighbouring A. gracilipes supercolonies."
