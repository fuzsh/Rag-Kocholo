        "text": "I find it hard to believe that the second day of Art and Science in the Woods has already ended. I continue to be so thankful for all the help provided by Allison, Olivia, Elijah, and Mary. Olivia is with us for the morning major class and Mary is with us for the afternoon minor class. Elijah and Allison are with me all day. Elijah has been recording the many families we encounter as we tour the habitats in the vicinity of the Sun Foundation. I really appreciate his help in writing all the spot identifications down so I can compile this nightly update. The students are keen to learn as much as possible about the insects (and spiders) we encounter. They collect (capture and release) numerous specimens (and most of the families encountered were collected first hand by students in our classes).\n\nHabitats\n\nToday, we focused on oak-hickory forest and aquatic (pond) habitats. Of course, we still have to walk through the old pasture habitat on the way to our tent. We often pass spittle bugs [Heteroptera: Cercopidae] on our walk through the pasture.\n\nThe “spittle” is generated by the Cercopidae nymph to hide from predators. The nymph is partly visible near the top of the spittle. It clearly looks unappetizing.\n\nWe also encountered some insect eggs (found on the underside of leaves). Here is a photo we took using our digital microscope. It looks like the one in the upper left is about to hatch.\n\nWe spent a fair amount of time in the oak-hickory forest. In addition to collecting insects with nets, I also spent some time sifting leaf litter. I placed this in a Winkler eclector and we will check tomorrow to see what we may have found. The habitat is over grown with many low plants (much different from what I observed when I lasted visited this south facing slope almost 15 years ago. There is a large white oak in the background.\n\nMore Insect taxa encountered\n\nAs we explored the fields and woods, we continued to put together a list of insects we encountered. We were able to identify most to family level. I have organized these below (by order). This is an updated list (new families/ orders encountered are marked with an asterisk). This list expands on the insects encountered on Monday.\n\nFor those who are curious about our running total. Over the course of two whole days, we have encountered:\n\n15 orders of insects (14 if you exclude Collembola)\n\n60 families of insects (59 if you exclude Collembola)\n\nAgain, most of these insects were captured by students in the Illinois Insects classes (both major [morning] and minor [afternoon] classes).\n\nClass Entognatha – Subclass Collembola *\n\nOrder Entomobryomorpha *\n\nFamily Entomobryidae *\n\nClass Insecta\n\nOrder Blattodea *\n\nFamily Ectobiidae (wood cockroach) *\n\nOrder Coleoptera\n\nFamily Buprestidae *\n\nFamily Cantharidae (soldier beetles)\n\nFamily Carabidae (ground beetles and tiger beetles) *\n\nFamily Cerambycidae (long horn beetles)\n\nTetraopes tetraopthalamus [milkweed beetle]\n\nFamily Chrysomelidae (leaf beetles)\n\nFamily Coccinellidae (lady beetles)\n\nFamily Curculionidae (weevils)\n\nFamily Dytiscidae (predaceous diving beetles) *\n\nFamily Elateridae (click beetles) *\n\nFamily Gyrinidae (whirligig beetles) *\n\nFamily Haliplidae (crawling water beetles) *\n\nFamily Lampyridae (fireflies)\n\nFamily Scarabaeidae (scarab beetles) *\n\nPopillia japonica [Japanese beetle] *\n\nFamily Silphidae *\n\nOrder Dermaptera *\n\nFamily Forficulidae (earwigs) *\n\nOrder Diptera\n\nFamily Bombyliidae (bee flies)\n\nFamily Culicidae (mosquitoes)\n\nFamily Dolicopodidae (long legged flies) *\n\nFamily Muscidae (house flies)\n\nFamily Rhagionidae *\n\nFamily Tabanidae (horse flies) *\n\nFamily Tipulidae (crane flies) *\n\nOrder Hemiptera\n\nFamily Belostomatidae (giant water bugs) *\n\nFamily Cercopidae (spittle bugs)\n\nFamily Cicadellidae (leaf hoppers)\n\nFamily Coreidae (leaf-footed bugs)\n\nFamily Corixidae (water boatmen) *\n\nFamily Membracidae (tree hoppers)\n\nFamily Myridae (plant bugs) *\n\nFamily Naucoridae (creeping water bugs) *\n\nFamily Nabidae (damsel bugs) *\n\nFamily Reduviidae (assassin bugs)\n\nFamily Scutelleridae (shield-backed bugs)\n\nFamily Veliidae (riffle bugs) *\n\nOrder Hymenoptera\n\nFamily Apidae (bumble bees and honey bees)\n\nFamily Formicidae (ants)\n\nFormica pallidefulva\n\nFormica exsectoides\n\nLasius neomiger *\n\nMonomorium minimum\n\nFamily Tenthredinidae (sawflies) *\n\nFamily Vespidae (potter wasps and others)\n\nOrder Lepidoptera\n\nFamily Erebidae *\n\nHaploa confusa *\n\nFamily Geometridae (geometer moths) *\n\nFamily Lycaenidae [blues]\n\nFamily Nymphalide\n\nAsterocampa celtis [hackberry emperor butterfly]\n\nCheckerspot butterfly\n\nSpeyeria cybele [great spangled fritillary]\n\nFamily Papilionidae (swallowtails)\n\nFamily Pieridae (sulphurs and whites)\n\nFamily Pyralidae *\n\nFamily Satyridae (wood nymphs)\n\nOrder Mantodea\n\nFamily Mantidae\n\nTenodera sinensis [Chinese mantis nymphs]\n\nOrder Mecoptera\n\nFamily Panorpidae (scorpion-flies)\n\nOrder Neuroptera\n\nFamily Chrysopidae (green lacewings(\n\nOrder Odonata\n\nFamily Aeschnidae (darners) *\n\nFamily Coenagrionidae (damselflies)\n\nFamily Libellulidae (skimmer dragonflies)\n\nOrder Orthoptera\n\nFamily Acrididae (band-wing grasshoppers)\n\nFamily Gryllidae\n\nPhyllopalpus pulchellus [handsome trig]\n\nFamily Rhaphidophoridae (cave crickets)\n\nFamily Tettigoniidae (katydids) *\n\nFamily Tridactylidae (pygmy mole crickets)\n\nOrder Phasmatodea\n\nFamily Diapheromeridae\n\nDiapheromera femorata (common walkingstick)\n\nOrder Thysanoptera *\n\nFamily Thripidae (thrips) *\n\nOther Arthorpods\n\nIsopods\n\nScolopendromorph Centipede\n\nSpiders (mostly wolf spiders and relatives and Salticidae)\n\nGeolycosa wrighti was the large brown spider we found in the afternoon)\n\nWe covered a lot of ground today as well. My total mileage was over 7 miles again today. Coupled with the 13 miles I walked previously, I have now walked over 20 miles at the Sun Foundation in 2018."
