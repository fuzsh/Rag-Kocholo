They have annually cost humans billions of dollars in crop losses and in the expense of keeping them under control. For example, the losses caused by pests in agricultural environments include decreased crop yield, reduced crop quality, and increased harvesting costs, are annoying to humans for several reasons. Pests include pathogenic organisms which infest mammals and plants; some pests can spread disease as disease vectors. The pathogenic organisms that infest plants and cause economic loss of plant crops include fungi, insects, arachnids, gastropods, nematodes and the like. The pathogenic organisms that infest animals include ticks, mites, fleas, and mosquitoes.\n\npests include cockroaches, termites and ants. These and other pests have annually cost humans billions of dollars in crop losses in the case of agricultural pests and in the expense of keeping them under control. For example, the losses caused by pests in agricultural environments include decreased crop yield, reduced crop quality, and increased harvesting costs. In household scenarios, insect pests may act as vectors for diseases and allergic matter.\n\nInsect is used informally, in that it refers not only to members of the phylogenetic Class Insecta, but also to the various similar arthropod animals, such as spiders, centipedes, mites and ticks.\n\ninsecticide is sometimes used to identify pesticides that control non-insect arthropods such as mites, ticks, and spiders\n\ninsecticide and âpesticide,â as used herein are used interchangeably to refer to pesticidal compositions designed primarily to eradicate or kill insects, spiders, mites, ticks, etc. Most insecticides kill by damaging an insect's nervous system. However, many are toxic to people and animals and can damage the environment if not used properly.\n\nthe ideal insecticide has the following characteristics: low toxicity to non-target organisms; low cost; ready availability; a stable shelf life; nonflammability; easy preparation, nonstaining; noncorrosive; low odor and rapid breakdown to nontoxic by-products.\n\nToxicant or Active Ingredient This is the basic ingredient that has a toxic action and kills or repels the pest. It's normally shown on a pesticide label as the active ingredient or technical material. Some pesticides, especially those labeled for general use, may contain more than one active ingredient. If so, all active ingredients are listed on the label.\n\nthe pesticide carrier is mixed with the toxicant to make a finished or semi-finished pesticide product. It normally has no pesticidal action itself and will be listed under inert ingredients on the label. However, there are some carriers, such as most petroleum products, that have some pesticidal action of their own and will be listed under the active ingredients on the label. For liquid pesticides the carrier is normally water or a petroleum-based product, while for most dry pesticides, the carrier is normally talc or diatomaceous earth. Carriers may contain a solvent to dissolve a toxicant that is not readily soluble in a common carrier, thus enabling the toxicant to be added to the carrier and remain in solution.\n\nCarriers may also contain a surfactant to increase the emulsifying, dispersing and/or spreading characteristics of a pesticidal formulation.\n\na surfactant to increase the emulsifying, dispersing and/or spreading characteristics of a pesticidal formulation.\n\nOne of the most common surfactants is called a wetting agent.\n\na wetting agent causes a liquid to cover treated surfaces more thoroughly, and is most commonly used in pesticides applied to vegetation.\n\nEmulsifiers are used in liquid pesticides to help suspend one type of liquid (such as an oil-based toxicant) in another (such as water carrier).\n\ncarrier means an inert or fluid material, which may be inorganic or organic and of synthetic or natural origin, with which the toxicant/active ingredient is mixed or formulated to facilitate its application or storage, transport and/or handling.\n\na synergist is a chemical product added to a pesticide to increase or enhance the effectiveness of a pesticide's active ingredient.\n\na pesticide product may contain approximately 5-20 times more synergist than active ingredient.\n\na synergist may have active ingredient qualities itself and, if so, will be listed on the label as a secondary active ingredient. When a main active ingredient and synergist are combined, the enhanced effectiveness of the combined product is greater than the accumulative effect that would be achieved if the products were applied separately.\n\nSynergists are found in most all household, livestock and pet aerosol pesticides to enhance the action of the fast knockdown pesticides, e.g., pyrethrum, allethrin, and resmethrin, against flying insects.\n\nSynergists like piperonyl butoxide (PBO) are required in pesticidal formulations containing pyrethrum, for example, because target insects produce an enzyme (cytochrome P-450) that attacks pyrethrum and breaks it down, thereby making it effective in knocking an insect down, but ineffective for killing in many cases.\n\nthese synergists act by inhibiting P-450 dependent polysubstrate monooxygenases enzymes (PSMOs) produced by microsomes, which are subcellular units found in the liver of mammals and in some insect tissues that degrade pyrethrum and other pesticidal compounds, such as pyrethrum, allethrin, resmethrin, and the like.\n\nPSMOs P-450 dependent polysubstrate monooxygenases enzymes\n\nPBO affects humans by inhibiting important liver enzymes responsible for breakdown of some toxins, including the active ingredients of pesticides. Specifically, it has been shown to inhibit hepatic microsomal oxidase enzymes in laboratory rodents and interfere in humans. Because these enzymes act to detoxify many drugs and other chemicals, a heavy exposure to an insecticidal synergist may make a person temporarily vulnerable to a variety of toxic insults that would normally be easily tolerated. In addition to the symptoms induced by the active ingredients, signs of PBQ poisoning include anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, intestinal inflammation, pulmonary hemorrhage and perhaps mild central nervous system depression. Repeated contact with PBO may also cause slight skin irritation.\n\npesticidal compositions containing synthetic chemical toxicants have provided an effective means of pest control.\n\none approach teaches the use of complex organic insecticides.\n\nOther approaches employ absorbent organic polymers for widespread dehydration of the insects.\n\nUse of inorganic salts as components of pesticides has also been tried.\n\nthe widespread use of synthetic chemical pesticides has caused detrimental environmental effects that are harmful to humans and other animals.\n\nthe public has become concerned about the amount of residual chemicals that persist in food, ground water and the environment, and that are toxic, carcinogenic or otherwise incompatible to humans, domestic animals and/or fish.\n\nsome target pests have even shown an ability to develop resistance to many commonly used synthetic chemical pesticides.\n\nregulatory guidelines have encouraged a search for potentially less dangerous pesticidal compositions via stringent restrictions on the use of certain synthetic pesticides.\n\nelimination of effective pesticides from the market has limited economical and effective options for controlling pests.\n\nbotanical pesticides are of great interest because they are natural pesticides, i.e., toxicants derived from plants that are relatively more safe to humans and the environment.\n\nUse of food-grade plant essential oils have been tried.\n\nthese plant essential oils when used alone can be expensive, impractical or ineffective under certain circumstances.\n\nPyrethrum is a natural pesticide extracted from the flowers of a chrysanthemum grown in Kenya and Ecuador. Pyrethrum acts as an insecticide with phenomenal speed causing immediate paralysis, while at the same time exhibits negligible toxic effects on humans and warm-blooded animals.\n\nUse of pyrethrum for industrial or agricultural applications, however, is disadvantageous in that frequent treatments are required because pyrethrum becomes volatile when in contact with water and readily decomposes when exposed to direct sunlight light. Pyrethrum extracts are also undesirably neurotoxic to cold-blooded animals, such as fishes, snakes, etc.\n\npyrethrum is limited in availability and is very expensive, the industry has turned to synthetic pyrethroids, which are very photostable in sunlight and are generally effective against most agricultural insect pests. Pyrethroids are not as safe as pyrethrums, however, and disadvantageously persist in the environment for longer periods. Further, many insects disadvantageously develop resistance to pyrethroids.\n\nthe present invention provides novel pesticidal compositions for use against pests such as invertebrates, arthropods, insects, arachnids, larvae and eggs thereof.\n\nthe present invention provides novel pesticidal compositions, and methods for using same to control pests.\n\nthe prior art difficulties and drawbacks are overcome and a safe, effective insecticide is attained.\n\nthe compositions of the present invention are particularly constructed for controlling insects and other arthropods.\n\nthe present invention provides safe and effective insecticides, while also providing compositions which are non-toxic to humans, animals, and the environment.\n\nthe compositions of this invention are non-toxic, which causes no harm or injury to humans, animals, and may be biodegradable, which causes no harm to the environment, water systems.\n\nnovel pesticidal compositions of the present invention contain (1) at least one plant essential oil compound as a pesticidally active ingredient or toxicant, (2) isopropyl myristate (CAS Reg. No. 110-27-0) or analogs thereof as a synergist, and (3) a pesticidally acceptable carrier.\n\nSuitable analogs that may be used as a synergist in the pesticidal compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to members selected from the group consisting of isopropyl palmitate (CAS Reg.

No. 42065-76-9), and the like. Isopropyl myristate and isopropyl palmitate are most preferred.\n\nnovel pesticidal compositions may be used as an unscented contact and/or repellent pesticide in applications including, without limitation, household, industrial and/or agricultural applications.\n\nthe pesticidal composition and method quickly knockdown and kill pests.\n\nthe present invention further provides a method of treating a locus where pest control (i.e., repellency, knockdown and/or kill) is desired using a relatively safe pesticidal composition and method that will not harm mammals or the environment.\n\nthe present invention is directed to pesticidal compositions comprising rosemary oil and/or wintergreen oil.\n\nthe present invention is directed to a method for controlling pests by applying a pesticidally-effective amount of the pesticidal compositions of the present invention to a location where pest control is desired.\n\nthe pesticidal compositions of the represent invention can be applied and used as liquid sprays, crystals, gels, and pellets, impregnating material, such as posts, etc.\n\nisopropyl myristate denotes the ester of isopropyl alcohol and myristic acid having a molecular formula of C 17 H 34 O 2 and the following chemical structure:\n\nOther names used include: estergel; myristic acid, isopropyl ester; tetradecanoic acid 1-methylethyl ester; tetradecanoic acid, isopropyl ester; isopropyl tetradecanoate; isopropyl myristate; 1-Methylethyl tetradecanoate; and 1-Tridecanecarboxylic acid, isopropyl ester.\n\nisopropyl palmitate denotes the ester of isopropyl alcohol and palmitic acid having a molecular formula of and the following chemical structure:\n\nhexadecanoic acid 1-methylethyl ester\n\nisopropyl n-hexadecanoate isopropyl hexadecanoate\n\nhexadecanoic acid isopropyl ester\n\npalmitic acid isopropyl ester\n\n1-Methylethyl hexadecanoate isopropyl ester\n\nIsopropyl myristate and isopropyl palmitate are each commonly used as an emollient, emulsifier or thickener in cosmetic oils, creams & lotions, makeup, lipstick, skin lubricants, fragrances, deodorants, sun screens, hair preparations, nail lacquer remover; as a parenteral solvent in medicine; and as a reagent in medical test for sterility.\n\nemollient and lubricant that reduces the greasy feel of products by replacing other, oilier ingredients. It spreads very easily and promotes a dry feeling.\n\nIsopropyl myristate is generally obtained by reacting myristoyl chloride with isopropanol with aid of a suitable dehydrochlorinating agent.\n\nIsopropyl palmitate is generally obtained by reaction of palmitic acid and isopropyl alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst\n\nan acid catalyst Both are also available from commercial sources such as, for example, Emkay Chemical Co., Elizabeth, N.J.; Inolex Chemical Co, Philadelphia, Pa.; Stepan Company, Northfield, Ill.; and Unichema North America, Chicago, Ill.; Union Camp Corp, Wayne, N.J.\n\nisopropyl myristate is exempted from the requirement of a tolerance when used as a solvent in accordance with good agricultural practice as an inert ingredients in pesticide formulations.\n\nthe present invention provides, without limitation, a pesticidal composition and method that is exempt from registration with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act; may also enjoy exemption from a food tolerance residue requirement when used on food under the Federal Food and Drug Cosmetic Act and may also be allowable for use in organic farming under the Organic Materials Review Institute and the National Organic Program.\n\nisopropyl palmitate is not currently exempted under the EPA regulations, it is believed to be safe because it has been used in cosmetics without any known deleterious affects to humans.\n\npest refers to organisms and microorganisms, including pathogens, that negatively affect plants or animals by colonizing, attacking or infecting them. This includes organisms that spread disease and/or damage the host and/or compete for host nutrients.\n\nplant pests are organisms known to associate with plants and which, as a result of that association, causes a detrimental effect on the plant's health and vigor. Plant pests include but are not limited to fungi, bacteria, insects, and nematodes.\n\npesticide refers to a substance that can be used in the control of agricultural, natural environmental, and domestic/household pests, such as insects, fungi, bacteria, and viruses.\n\npests such as insects, fungi, bacteria, and viruses.\n\nthe term âpesticideâ is understood to encompass naturally occurring or synthetic chemical insecticides (larvicides, and adulticides), insect growth regulators, acaricides (miticides), nematicides, ectoparasiticides, bactericides, fungicides, and herbicides (substance which can be used in agriculture to control or modify plant growth).\n\nplant encompasses whole plants and parts of plants such as roots, stems, leaves and seed, as well as cells and tissues within the plants or plant parts.\n\nTarget crops to be protected within the scope of the present invention include, without limitation, the following species of plants: cereals (wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice, sorghum and related crops), beet (sugar beet and fodder beet), forage grasses (orchardgrass, fescue, and the like), drupes, pomes and soft fruit (apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries), leguminous plants (beans, lentils, peas, soybeans), oil plants (rape, mustard, poppy, olives, sunflowers, coconuts, castor oil plants, cocoa beans, groundnuts), cucumber plants (cucumber, marrows, melons) fiber plants (cotton, flax, hemp, jute), citrus fruit (o\n\nlinden-trees yew-trees, oak-trees, alders, poplars, birch-trees, firs, larches, pines\n\nplants such as maize, tobacco, nuts, coffee, sugar cane, tea, vines, hops, bananas and natural rubber plants, as well as ornamentals (including composites).\n\ncontrol or âcontrollingâ used throughout the specification and claims, are meant to include any pesticidal (killing) or pestistatic (inhibiting, maiming or generally interfering) activities of a pesticidal composition against a given pest.\n\nthese terms not only include killing, but also include such activities as those of chemisterilants which produce sterility in insects by preventing the production of ova or sperm, by causing death of sperm or ova, or by producing severe injury to the genetic material of sperm or ova, so that the larvae that are produced do not develop into mature progeny.\n\nthe terms also include repellant activity that protect animals, plants or products from insect attack by making food or living conditions unattractive or offensive to pests. These repellant activities may be the result of repellents that are poisonous, mildly toxic, or non-poisonous to pests.\n\ninert ingredients denote chemicals used in pesticide products to make a pesticide, e.g, solvents, surfactants, propellants and carriers, that are pesticidally inactive, i.e., do not possess pesticidal efficacy of their own.\n\ninert ingredients include, but are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own): solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons;

plant pests, including but not limited to mites, aphids, thrips, whiteflies, loopers, worms, beetles, leafrollers, moths and weevils; and invertebrates such as insects, arachnids, larvae and eggs thereof.\n\nthe present invention relates to the pesticidal compositions disclosed herein a repellent against invertebrate pests.\n\nthe present invention further relates to various optimum ratios between and among the constituents of each proprietary blend and the proper delivery system for each blend.\n\nthe ratio of isopropyl myristate (or analog thereof to active ingredient is the ratio wherein a synergistic effect is achieved and usually, for example, anywhere from approximately: 100:1 to 1:100 parts by weight; 75:1 to 1:75 parts by weight; 65:1 to 1:65 parts by weight; 55:1 to 1:55 parts by weight; 50:1 to 1:50 parts by weight; 40:1 to 1:40 parts by weight; 20:1 to 1:20 parts by weight; 10:1 to 1:10 parts by weight; or 5:1 to 1:5 parts by weight and all subranges therebetween.\n\nthe amount of plant essential oil compound present is approximately 0.1% to 5% of the total pesticidal composition.\n\nthe present invention relates to pesticidal compositions containing a carrier, isopropyl myristate or isopropyl palmitate as a synergist and at least one plant essential oil compound as a pesticidally active ingredient/toxicant.\n\nthe present invention relates to a method for controlling (e.g., knocking down or killing) invertebrates such as insects, arachnids, larvae and eggs thereof, including but not limited to cockroaches, ants, flies, spiders, mites, aphids, thrips, whiteflies, loopers, worms, beetles, leafrollers, moths and weevils, by the application of pesticidally effective amounts of the pesticidal compositions of the present invention to a location where invertebrate pest control is desired.\n\ninvertebrates such as insects, arachnids, larvae and eggs thereof, including but not limited to cockroaches, ants, flies, spiders, mites, aphids, thrips, whiteflies, loopers, worms, beetles, leafrollers, moths and weevils\n\nthe pesticidal compositions containing isopropyl myristate or isopropyl palmitate, as a synergist for at least one plant essential oil compound have a broad spectrum of activity and are particularly effective against, but not limited to, insects having a cuticle or proteinaceous exoskeleton or the like.\n\nthe composition according to the present invention comprises additional natural or essential oils as additional components and is therefore particularly advantageous in terms of its relative non-toxicity.\n\nthe pesticidal compositions of the present invention contain (1) a pesticidally acceptable carrier (including inert ingredients), (2) a pesticidally active ingredient (toxicant) comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of at least one plant essential oil compound; and (3) a synergist comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of isopropyl myristate or analogs thereof (e.g., isopropyl palmitate).\n\na pesticidally acceptable carrier including inert ingredients\n\na pesticidally active ingredient comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of at least one plant essential oil compound\n\na synergist comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of isopropyl myristate or analogs thereof (e.g., isopropyl palmitate).\n\nthe pesticidal composition of the present invention are useful in methods for controlling (repelling, knocking down and/or killing) pests, including insects, arachnids, larvae and eggs thereof, comprising applying to a locus where control is desired a pesticidally-effective amount of the pesticidal composition of the present invention.\n\nthe present invention provides very efficacious pesticides that, in a preferred aspect, may be designated as biopesticides in that they comprise a chemical substance of natural origin that can be synthesized.\n\nthe preferred pesticidal composition of the present invention have a lethal effect on pest targets.\n\nthe preferred pesticidal compositions have active ingredients that have been proven to be substantially non-toxic to man and domestic animals and which have minimal adverse effects on wildlife and the environment.\n\nthe pesticidal compositions of the present invention are advantageous in that they can typically control pests at average or lower than average dosage rates. Such pesticidal compositions are also advantageous in that they can provide extended protection to a locus. Further, such pesticidal compositions are also advantageous in that said pesticidal compositions control pests without introducing a notable amount of harm to the surrounding environment of which the provided pesticidal composition is being utilized.\n\nthe pesticidal compositions of the invention have pesticidal activity against one or more pests. However, it is understood that certain pesticidal compositions may be more effective on some pests than others, and may even be ineffective against some pests. However, that does not in any way detract from their value as pesticides since the present invention contemplates use as broad, general acting pesticides, while others have utility as specific or selective pesticides.\n\nthe non-limiting Examples set forth below illustrate methods by which the broad-acting or selectivity of pesticidal activity may be readily ascertained by routine experimentation.\n\nthe pesticidal compositions of the present invention offer several advantages over currently used pesticides.\n\nthe preferred essential oils used in the composition of the invention are naturally occurring compounds, and as such are relatively nontoxic to humans, domestic animals and wildlife. Consequently, when used for treating plant pests, food crops can be treated using the composition up to and immediately before the harvesting period, a practice that generally is avoided when using conventional methods of pest control.\n\nthe composition also can be used to control the growth of pest organisms on harvested crops.\n\nthe harvested food can be used directly as food for animals or humans with little fear of (residual toxicity) or phytotoxicity.\n\nthe environmental and health hazards involved in pest control are minimized.\n\nthe composition when necessary, can be used as a preventative on a repeated basis and, thus, can be integrated into integrated pest management (IPM) programs.\n\nthe composition can be applied to skin or to objects such as clothing, fur, feathers, or hair that come into contact with skin when used to treat pests that infest animals.\n\nthe essential oils, i.e., the active ingredients, of the pesticidal compositions of the present invention are believed to be biorational chemicals that may qualify for the US EPA Biopesticide Program.\n\npesticidal compositions of the present invention have not previously been used against microorganisms, and therefore, fungal and bacterial pathogens and other pest organisms have not acquired resistance to them.\n\nDisease resistance to chemicals other than the heavy metals occurs commonly in pests such as fungi and on rare occasions in bacterial plant disease pests.\n\na new pesticide often becomes noticeably less effective against a particular disease after several growing seasons.\n\npesticides become more specific for diseases, the pests become resistant. This can be attributed to the singular mode of action of a particular pesticide, which disrupts only one genetically controlled process in the metabolism of the pest organism. The result is that resistant populations appear suddenly, either by selection of resistant individuals in a population or by a single gene mutation.\n\nthe formulations of the subject invention provide for effective control of (microorganisms) insects, mites, fungi and microorganisms In particular situations, such as where an insect damages a plant part or tissue and a secondary fungal disease develops, this aspect of the invention is particularly advantageous.\n\nthe pesticidal compositions according to the invention have very good fungicidal properties and can be employed for controlling phytopathogenic fungi, such as, without limitation, plasmodiophoromycetes, oomycetes, chytridiomycetes, zygomycetes, ascomycetes, basidiomycetes, deuteromycetes, etc.\n\nFungal phytopathogens particularly associated with crop plants and included within the scope of the present invention include, without limitation, the following: Miscellaneous Fungal Diseases (e.g., Septoria tritici, Septoria nodorum ); Gibberella ear mold (e.g., e.g., Gibberella zeae, G. saubinetti ); Aspergillus ear rot (e.g., Aspergillus flavus, A. parasiticus ); Diplodia ear rot (e.g., Diplodia maydis, D. macrospora ); Fusarium ear rot (e.g., Fusarium moniliforme, F. monilif. var.\n\nMiscellaneous Fungal Diseases e.g., Septoria tritici, Septoria nodorum\n\nGibberella ear mold e.g., e.g., Gibberella zeae, G. saubinetti\n\nPythium stalk rot e.g., Pythium aphanidermata\n\nAnthracnose stalk rot e.g., Colletotrichum graminicola, C. tucumanensis, Glomerella graminicola\n\nDiplodia stalk rot e.g., Diplodia maydis, D. zeae - maydis, Stenocarpella maydis, Macrodiplodia zeae, Sphaeria maydis, S. zeae, D. macrospora\n\nFusarium stalk rot e.g., Fusarium moniliforme\n\nGibberella stalk rot e.g., G. zeae, G.\n\nSouthern rust e.g., Puccinia polysora, Dicaeoma polysorum\n\nHead smut e.g., Sphacelotheca reiliana\n\nCommon smut e.g., Ustilago maydis\n\nCarbonum leaf spot e.g., Helminthosporium carbonum\n\nEye spot e.g., Kabatiella zeae\n\nSorghum downy mildew e.g., Peronosclerospora sorghi\n\nBrown stripe downy mildew e.g., Sclerophthora rayssiae\n\nSugarcane downy mildew e.g., Peronosclerospora sacchari\n\nPhillipine downy mildew e.g., Peronoscler.\n\nJava downy mildew e.g., Peronosclerospora maydis\n\nSpontaneum downy mildew e.g., Peronosclerospora spantanea\n\nBengal downy mildew e.g., Peronosclerospora heteropogoni\n\nGraminicola downy mildew e.g., Sclerospora graminicola\n\nRusts e.g., Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici, Puccinia recondita f.sp.\n\nTritici Puccinia striiformis\n\nSmuts e.g., Tilletia tritici, Tilletia controversa, Tilletia indica, Ustilago tritici, Urocystis tritici\n\nRoot rots, Foot rots and Blights e.g., Gaeumannomyces graminis, Pythium spp., Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium graminaerum, Fusarium avenaceum, Drechslere tritici - repentis, Rhizoctonia spp., Colletotrichum graminicola, Helminthosporium spp., Microdochium nivale, Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides ); Mildews (e.g., Erysiphe graminis f.sp. tritici, Sclerophthora macrospora ), and the like.\n\nthe long term control of pests results in plants with an improved quality and yields of produce by host plants as compared with untreated plants.\n\nthe low concentration and single dose of anti-pest agents decreases the likelihood of damage to the plant and/or its crop, and decreases the likelihood of adverse side effects to workers applying the pesticide, or to animals, fish or fowl which ingest the tissues or parts of treated plants.\n\nthe methods of use of the pesticidal compositions of the invention will depend at least in part upon the pest to be treated and its feeding habits, as well as breeding and nesting habits. While very minor dosage rates of the novel compositions will have an adverse effect on pests, adequate control usually involves the application of a sufficient amount to either eliminate pests entirely or significantly deter their growth and/or rate of proliferation.\n\nDosage rates required to accomplish these effects vary depending on the target pest, size, and maturity, i.e., stage of growth. More mature pests may be more resistant to pesticides and require higher dosage rates for a comparable level of control.\n\nDose response experiments using different dilutions for example, about 1:1000, 1:100, 1:10 and 1:3 of the pesticidal compositions of the present invention on target organisms and on plants are performed to determine the optimal concentration of the active essential oil compound(s) that show(s) pesticidal activity without phytotoxicity or dermal sensitivity.\n\nan amount from about 0.1 to 2,000 (SMB has a question mark by this) g/ha of the active ingredients is employed onto the soil, plants, or directly onto the harmful pests, preferably as an emulsifiable concentrate or emulsion usually at a rate from 1 to 2000 ppm.\n\nthe present invention is useful for treating (e.g., preventing, controlling, impeding, killing and the like) infectious or pathogenic bacterial, viral, microbial, and other disease-causing pests is provided which includes applying an effective amount of the pesticidal composition to a locus in need thereof for controlling, treating, managing, preventing, or the like, the spread of diseases caused by germs, bacteria, or viruses such as Escherichia coli, salmonella, staphylococci, streptococci, influenza, pneumonia, various blood and urine bacterial pathogens, and the like.\n\ndiseases caused by germs, bacteria, or viruses such as Escherichia coli, salmonella, staphylococci, streptococci, influenza, pneumonia, various blood and urine bacterial pathogens, and the like.\n\nthe present invention further encompasses treatment of the following: gram-positive cocci that cause staphylococcal infections such as pneumonia, bacteremia, osteomyelitis, enterocolitis, and the like; streptococci that cause infections such as hemolytic, viridans, enterococci, lactic, and the like; pneumococci that cause infections such as pneumonia, sinusitis, otitis, Meningitis, and the like; gram-negative cocci such as meningococcus, gonococcus, and the like; gram-positive bacilli that cause infections such as erysipelothricosis, listeriosis, anthrax, nocardiosis, and the like; gram-negative bacilli that cause infections such as enterobacteriaceac salmonella, shigellosis, hemophilus, tularemia, plaque, melioidosis, bartonellosis, campylobacter, and noncholera vibrio, and the like; anaerobic bacill\n\nthe pesticidal compositions may be useful for treating surfaces containing infectious human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza, A, B, and C, parainfluenza viruses 1-4, rhonoviruses (common cold), mumps virus, adenoviruses, reoviruses, and epstein-Barr virus, infants and adult syncytial virus, primary atypical pneumonia, polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses and high numbered viruses, epidemic gastroenteritis viruses, rubeola virus, rubella virus, varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex, human herpes virus type 6, human parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis viruses types A, B, C, D, human Papillomavirus, molluscum contagiosum virus, arboviruses, togaviruses, alphaviruses, flaviviruses, bunyaviruse\n\nHIV infectious human\n\nthe present invention provides a pesticidal composition\n\na pesticidal composition comprising isopropyl myristate or isopropyl palmitate and at least one plant essential oil in admixture with other inert ingredients.\n\nSuitable plant essential oils that may be mixed with the synergists disclosed herein (i.e. isopropyl myristate and isopropyl palmitate) in the pesticidal composition of the present invention include, without limitation, enantiomerically pure or racemic mixtures of one or more members selected from the group consisting of:\n\nâ - or â -pinene â -campholenic aldehyde; â -citronellol; â -iso-amyl-cinnamic (e.g., amyl cinnamic aldehyde); â -pinene oxide; â -cinnamic terpinene; â -terpineol (e.g., methods.\n\nthe pesticidal compositions of the present invention unexpectedly exhibit excellent pesticidal efficacy in lieu of conventional pesticides which are not safe for use in households and other sensitive areas, or in lieu of pesticidal compositions containing individual plant essential oils.

They have annually cost humans billions of dollars in crop losses and in the expense of keeping them under control. For example, the losses caused by pests in agricultural environments include decreased crop yield, reduced crop quality, and increased harvesting costs, are annoying to humans for several reasons. Pests include pathogenic organisms which infest mammals and plants; some pests can spread disease as disease vectors. The pathogenic organisms that infest plants and cause economic loss of plant crops include fungi, insects, arachnids, gastropods, nematodes and the like. The pathogenic organisms that infest animals include ticks, mites, fleas, and mosquitoes. Other pests include cockroaches, termites and ants. These and other pests have annually cost humans billions of dollars in crop losses in the case of agricultural pests and in the expense of keeping them under control. For example, the losses caused by pests in agricultural environments include decreased crop yield, reduced crop quality, and increased harvesting costs. In household scenarios, insect pests may act as vectors for diseases and allergic matter.\n\nInsect, as used herein, is used informally, in that it refers not only to members of the phylogenetic Class Insecta, but also to the various similar arthropod animals, such as spiders, centipedes, mites and ticks. Although the word âinsecticideâ is sometimes used to identify pesticides that control non-insect arthropods such as mites, ticks, and spiders, âinsecticideâ and âpesticide,â as used herein, are used interchangeably to refer to pesticidal compositions designed primarily to eradicate or kill insects, spiders, mites, ticks, etc. Most insecticides kill by damaging an insect's nervous system. However, many are toxic to people and animals and can damage the environment if not used properly. The ideal insecticide has the following characteristics: low toxicity to non-target organisms; low cost; ready availability; a stable shelf life; nonflammability; easy preparation, nonstaining; noncorrosive; low odor and rapid breakdown to nontoxic by-products.\n\nThere are a wide variety of pesticides and insecticides in the prior art. However, these prior art formulations typically include active ingredients which are highly toxic to humans and/or animals. Consequently, the prior art formulations must be used at low concentrations, which decreases toxic effects, but also decreases potency. Another problem with prior art insecticides is that insects frequently develop resistance or immunity to the insecticide. Due to the highly adaptive nature of most insects and the manner in which insecticides typically function, many prior art insecticides are effective initially, but lose their effectiveness over time. The development of new insecticides helps to address this problem by providing alternate insecticides, which can be used in combination or in an alternation with other insecticides.\n\nThe following are ingredients that may be included in any pesticidal composition.\n\n(1) Toxicant or Active Ingredient. This is the basic ingredient that has a toxic action and kills or repels the pest. It's normally shown on a pesticide label as the active ingredient or technical material. Some pesticides, especially those labeled for general use, may contain more than one active ingredient. If so, all active ingredients are listed on the label.\n\n(2) Carrier. The pesticide carrier is mixed with the toxicant to make a finished or semi-finished pesticide product. It normally has no pesticidal action itself and will be listed under inert ingredients on the label. However, there are some carriers, such as most petroleum products, that have some pesticidal action of their own and will be listed under the active ingredients on the label. For liquid pesticides the carrier is normally water or a petroleum-based product, while for most dry pesticides, the carrier is normally talc or diatomaceous earth. Carriers may contain a solvent to dissolve a toxicant that is not readily soluble in a common carrier, thus enabling the toxicant to be added to the carrier and remain in solution. Some pesticides have masking agent added to change or cover the odor of a pesticidal formulation. Carriers may also contain a surfactant to increase the emulsifying, dispersing and/or spreading characteristics of a pesticidal formulation. One of the most common surfactants is called a wetting agent. A wetting agent causes a liquid to cover treated surfaces more thoroughly, and is most commonly used in pesticides applied to vegetation. Emulsifiers are used in liquid pesticides to help suspend one type of liquid (such as an oil-based toxicant) in another (such as water carrier). Essentially, as used herein, âcarrierâ means an inert or fluid material, which may be inorganic or organic and of synthetic or natural origin, with which the toxicant/active ingredient is mixed or formulated to facilitate its application or storage, transport and/or handling.\n\n(3) Synergist. A synergist is a chemical product added to a pesticide to increase or enhance the effectiveness of a pesticide's active ingredient. Typically, a pesticide product may contain approximately 5-20 times more synergist than active ingredient. A synergist may have active ingredient qualities itself and, if so, will be listed on the label as a secondary active ingredient. When a main active ingredient and synergist are combined, the enhanced effectiveness of the combined product is greater than the accumulative effect that would be achieved if the products were applied separately. Synergists are found in most all household, livestock and pet aerosol pesticides to enhance the action of the fast knockdown pesticides, e.g., pyrethrum, allethrin, and resmethrin, against flying insects. Synergists like piperonyl butoxide (PBO) are required in pesticidal formulations containing pyrethrum, for example, because target insects produce an enzyme (cytochrome P-450) that attacks pyrethrum and breaks it down, thereby making it effective in knocking an insect down, but ineffective for killing in many cases. As such, these synergists act by inhibiting P-450 dependent polysubstrate monooxygenases enzymes (PSMOs) produced by microsomes, which are subcellular units found in the liver of mammals and in some insect tissues that degrade pyrethrum and other pesticidal compounds, such as pyrethrum, allethrin, resmethrin, and the like. These synergists act by inhibiting P-450 enzymes and other like compounds that are part of the gene battery that comprise Phase I and Phase II drug metabolizing enzymes.\n\nHowever, PBO affects humans by inhibiting important liver enzymes responsible for breakdown of some toxins, including the active ingredients of pesticides. Specifically, it has been shown to inhibit hepatic microsomal oxidase enzymes in laboratory rodents and interfere in humans. Because these enzymes act to detoxify many drugs and other chemicals, a heavy exposure to an insecticidal synergist may make a person temporarily vulnerable to a variety of toxic insults that would normally be easily tolerated. In addition to the symptoms induced by the active ingredients, signs of PBQ poisoning include anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, intestinal inflammation, pulmonary hemorrhage and perhaps mild central nervous system depression. Repeated contact with PBO may also cause slight skin irritation. Chronic toxicity studies have shown increased liver weights, even at the lowest doses, 30 mg/kg/day. Animal studies have shown hepatocellular carcinomas, even treatments as low as 1.2%. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considers PBO to be a class C possible human carcinogen. As such, the use of PBO as a synergists has become undesirable despite its ability to enhance the efficacy of pyrethrins.\n\nOver the years, pesticidal compositions containing synthetic chemical toxicants have provided an effective means of pest control. For example, one approach teaches the use of complex organic insecticides. Other approaches employ absorbent organic polymers for widespread dehydration of the insects. Use of inorganic salts as components of pesticides has also been tried. However, it has become increasingly apparent that the widespread use of synthetic chemical pesticides has caused detrimental environmental effects that are harmful to humans and other animals. For instance, the public has become concerned about the amount of residual chemicals that persist in food, ground water and the environment, and that are toxic, carcinogenic or otherwise incompatible to humans, domestic animals and/or fish. Moreover, some target pests have even shown an ability to develop resistance to many commonly used synthetic chemical pesticides. In recent times, regulatory guidelines have encouraged a search for potentially less dangerous pesticidal compositions via stringent restrictions on the use of certain synthetic pesticides. As a result, elimination of effective pesticides from the market has limited economical and effective options for controlling pests.\n\nAs an alternative, botanical pesticides are of great interest because they are natural pesticides, i.e., toxicants derived from plants that are relatively more safe to humans and the environment. Use of food-grade plant essential oils have been tried. However, these plant essential oils when used alone can be expensive, impractical or ineffective under certain circumstances.\n\nPyrethrum is a natural pesticide extracted from the flowers of a chrysanthemum grown in Kenya and Ecuador. Pyrethrum acts as an insecticide with phenomenal speed causing immediate paralysis, while at the same time exhibits negligible toxic effects on humans and warm-blooded animals. Use of pyrethrum for industrial or agricultural applications, however, is disadvantageous in that frequent treatments are required because pyrethrum becomes volatile when in contact with water and readily decomposes when exposed to direct sunlight light. Pyrethrum extracts are also undesirably neurotoxic to cold-blooded animals, such as fishes, snakes, etc. Moreover, the supply of pyrethrums is limited and substantial processing is required to bring the natural product to market, and large-scale production of pyrethrum is very expensive and unless pyrethrum is formulated with a synergist, most initially paralyzed insects recover to once again become pests.\n\nBecause pyrethrum is limited in availability and is very expensive, the industry has turned to synthetic pyrethroids, which are very photostable in sunlight and are generally effective against most agricultural insect pests. Pyrethroids are not as safe as pyrethrums, however, and disadvantageously persist in the environment for longer periods. Further, many insects disadvantageously develop resistance to pyrethroids.\n\nMany natural products used as insecticides, including plant essential oils, do not provide adequate control of pests in that they either act very slowly or are not very stable and break down quickly, thereby failing to provide quick knockdown of insects or toxic residual properties. Even products such as pyrethrum, although highly toxic to pests on contact when used properly in pesticidal formulations, are not effective pesticides for many applications because they lack residual properties, thereby increasing the frequency and cost of pesticide applications, as well as increased risk and exposure to the environment.\n\nAccordingly, there is a great need for novel synergistic and residual pesticidal compositions containing no level or substantially lower levels of pyrethrum, chlorinated hydrocarbons, organo phosphates, carbamates and the like. There is also a great need for compounds that act as novel synergists for plant essential oils that are used against invertebrate pests, including insects, arachnids, larvae and eggs thereof. In addition, there is a need for a method of treating a locus to be protected to control (kill and/or repel) invertebrate pests.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention provides novel pesticidal compositions for use against pests such as invertebrates, arthropods, insects, arachnids, larvae and eggs thereof. In particular, the present invention provides novel pesticidal compositions, and methods for using same to control pests. By employing the present invention, the prior art difficulties and drawbacks are overcome and a safe, effective insecticide is attained. As detailed herein, the compositions of the present invention are particularly constructed for controlling insects and other arthropods. The present invention provides safe and effective insecticides, while also providing compositions which are non-toxic to humans, animals, and the environment. The compositions of this invention are non-toxic, which causes no harm or injury to humans, animals, and may be biodegradable, which causes no harm to the environment, water systems.\n\nHeretofore it has been unknown that isopropyl myristate and analogs of same act as synergists for pesticidally active plant essential oil compounds and compositions. The novel pesticidal compositions of the present invention contain (1) at least one plant essential oil compound as a pesticidally active ingredient or toxicant, (2) isopropyl myristate (CAS Reg. No. 110-27-0) or analogs thereof as a synergist, and (3) a pesticidally acceptable carrier. Suitable analogs that may be used as a synergist in the pesticidal compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to members selected from the group consisting of isopropyl palmitate (CAS Reg. No. 142-91-6), isopropyl acetate (CAS Reg. No. 108-21-4), isopropyl lanolin (CAS Reg. No. 63393-93-1), isopropyl stearate (CAS Reg. No. 112-10-7), isopropylamine (CAS Reg. No. 75-31-0), isopropylamine salt of oleoylisopropanolamide, isopropylamine sulfate (CAS Reg. No. 60828-92-4), 4-isopropylidene-1-methylcylohexene (CAS Reg. No. 586-62-9), 4,4â²-isopropylidenediphenol C(12-15)-alkyl phosphates (CAS Reg. No. 59189-82-1), isopropylnapthalenesulfonic acid, sodium salt (CAS Reg. No. 28348-64-3), isopropylsulfamic acid (CAS Reg. No. 42065-76-9), and the like. Isopropyl myristate and isopropyl palmitate are most preferred.\n\nThe novel pesticidal compositions may be used as an unscented contact and/or repellent pesticide in applications including, without limitation, household, industrial and/or agricultural applications. The pesticidal composition and method quickly knockdown and kill pests. The present invention further provides a method of treating a locus where pest control (i.e., repellency, knockdown and/or kill) is desired using a relatively safe pesticidal composition and method that will not harm mammals or the environment.\n\nThese and other non-limiting technical effects are accomplished by the present invention, which is directed to pesticidal compositions comprising rosemary oil and/or wintergreen oil. In addition, the present invention is directed to a method for controlling pests by applying a pesticidally-effective amount of the pesticidal compositions of the present invention to a location where pest control is desired. The pesticidal compositions of the represent invention can be applied and used as liquid sprays, crystals, gels, and pellets, impregnating material, such as posts, etc.\n\nAs used herein, the term âisopropyl myristateâ denotes the ester of isopropyl alcohol and myristic acid having a molecular formula of C17H34O2 and the following chemical structure:\n\nOther names used include: estergel; myristic acid, isopropyl ester; tetradecanoic acid 1-methylethyl ester; tetradecanoic acid, isopropyl ester; isopropyl tetradecanoate; isopropyl myristate; 1-Methylethyl tetradecanoate; and 1-Tridecanecarboxylic acid, isopropyl ester.\n\nAs used herein, âisopropyl palmitateâ denotes the ester of isopropyl alcohol and palmitic acid having a molecular formula of and the following chemical structure:\n\nOther names used include: hexadecanoic acid, 1-methylethyl ester; isopropyl n-hexadecanoate; isopropyl hexadecanoate; hexadecanoic acid, isopropyl ester; palmitic acid, isopropyl ester; and 1-Methylethyl hexadecanoate.\n\nIsopropyl myristate and isopropyl palmitate are each commonly used as an emollient, emulsifier or thickener in cosmetic oils, creams & lotions, makeup, lipstick, skin lubricants, fragrances, deodorants, sun screens, hair preparations, nail lacquer remover; as a parenteral solvent in medicine; and as a reagent in medical test for sterility. As an emollient and lubricant that reduces the greasy feel of products by replacing other, oilier ingredients. It spreads very easily and promotes a dry feeling. Isopropyl myristate is generally obtained by reacting myristoyl chloride with isopropanol with aid of a suitable dehydrochlorinating agent. Isopropyl palmitate is generally obtained by reaction of palmitic acid and isopropyl alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst Both are also available from commercial sources such as, for example, Emkay Chemical Co., Elizabeth, N.J.; Inolex Chemical Co, Philadelphia, Pa.; Stepan Company, Northfield, Ill.; and Unichema North America, Chicago, Ill.; Union Camp Corp, Wayne, N.J.\n\nIn addition, under 40 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1001(e), isopropyl myristate is exempted from the requirement of a tolerance when used as a solvent in accordance with good agricultural practice as an inert ingredients in pesticide formulations. As such, it is believed that the present invention provides, without limitation, a pesticidal composition and method that is exempt from registration with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act; may also enjoy exemption from a food tolerance residue requirement when used on food under the Federal Food and Drug Cosmetic Act and may also be allowable for use in organic farming under the Organic Materials Review Institute and the National Organic Program. Although isopropyl palmitate is not currently exempted under the EPA regulations, it is believed to be safe because it has been used in cosmetics without any known deleterious affects to humans.\n\nAs used herein, the term âpestâ refers to organisms and microorganisms, including pathogens, that negatively affect plants or animals by colonizing, attacking or infecting them. This includes organisms that spread disease and/or damage the host and/or compete for host nutrients. In addition, plant pests are organisms known to associate with plants and which, as a result of that association, causes a detrimental effect on the plant's health and vigor. Plant pests include but are not limited to fungi, bacteria, insects, and nematodes.\n\nThe term âpesticideâ as used herein refers to a substance that can be used in the control of agricultural, natural environmental, and domestic/household pests, such as insects, fungi, bacteria, and viruses. The term âpesticideâ is understood to encompass naturally occurring or synthetic chemical insecticides (larvicides, and adulticides), insect growth regulators, acaricides (miticides), nematicides, ectoparasiticides, bactericides, fungicides, and herbicides (substance which can be used in agriculture to control or modify plant growth).\n\nThe term âplantâ as used herein encompasses whole plants and parts of plants such as roots, stems, leaves and seed, as well as cells and tissues within the plants or plant parts. Target crops to be protected within the scope of the present invention include, without limitation, the following species of plants: cereals (wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice, sorghum and related crops), beet (sugar beet and fodder beet), forage grasses (orchardgrass, fescue, and the like), drupes, pomes and soft fruit (apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries), leguminous plants (beans, lentils, peas, soybeans), oil plants (rape, mustard, poppy, olives, sunflowers, coconuts, castor oil plants, cocoa beans, groundnuts), cucumber plants (cucumber, marrows, melons) fiber plants (cotton, flax, hemp, jute), citrus fruit (oranges, lemons, grapefruit, mandarins), vegetables (spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages and other Brassicae, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, paprika), lauraceae (avocados, carrots, cinnamon, camphor), deciduous trees and conifers (e.g. linden-trees, yew-trees, oak-trees, alders, poplars, birch-trees, firs, larches, pines), or plants such as maize, tobacco, nuts, coffee, sugar cane, tea, vines, hops, bananas and natural rubber plants, as well as ornamentals (including composites).\n\nThe terms âcontrolâ or âcontrollingâ used throughout the specification and claims, are meant to include any pesticidal (killing) or pestistatic (inhibiting, maiming or generally interfering) activities of a pesticidal composition against a given pest. Thus, these terms not only include killing, but also include such activities as those of chemisterilants which produce sterility in insects by preventing the production of ova or sperm, by causing death of sperm or ova, or by producing severe injury to the genetic material of sperm or ova, so that the larvae that are produced do not develop into mature progeny. The terms also include repellant activity that protect animals, plants or products from insect attack by making food or living conditions unattractive or offensive to pests. These repellant activities may be the result of repellents that are poisonous, mildly toxic, or non-poisonous to pests.\n\nAs used herein, âinert ingredientsâ or âinertsâ denote chemicals used in pesticide products to make a pesticide, e.g, solvents, surfactants, propellants and carriers, that are pesticidally inactive, i.e., do not possess pesticidal efficacy of their own. Examples of inert ingredients include, but are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own): solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading, and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; emulsifiers; etc.\n\nThe pesticidal compositions of the present invention may be used in the control of agricultural, natural environmental, and domestic/household pests, such as invertebrate insects, arachnids, larvae and eggs thereof, as well as against fungi, bacteria, and viruses.\n\nIn one aspect, the present invention relates to pesticidal compositions containing at least one plant essential oil compound and isopropyl myristate as a synergist and methods for using same against household pests including but not limited to cockroaches, ants, flies and spiders; plant pests, including but not limited to mites, aphids, thrips, whiteflies, loopers, worms, beetles, leafrollers, moths and weevils; and invertebrates such as insects, arachnids, larvae and eggs thereof.\n\nIn a further aspect, the present invention relates to the pesticidal compositions disclosed herein a repellent against invertebrate pests.\n\nThe present invention further relates to various optimum ratios between and among the constituents of each proprietary blend and the proper delivery system for each blend. The ratio of isopropyl myristate (or analog thereof to active ingredient is the ratio wherein a synergistic effect is achieved and usually, for example, anywhere from approximately: 100:1 to 1:100 parts by weight; 75:1 to 1:75 parts by weight; 65:1 to 1:65 parts by weight; 55:1 to 1:55 parts by weight; 50:1 to 1:50 parts by weight; 40:1 to 1:40 parts by weight; 20:1 to 1:20 parts by weight; 10:1 to 1:10 parts by weight; or 5:1 to 1:5 parts by weight and all subranges therebetween. Optimally, the amount of plant essential oil compound present is approximately 0.1% to 5% of the total pesticidal composition.\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to pesticidal compositions containing a carrier, isopropyl myristate or isopropyl palmitate as a synergist and at least one plant essential oil compound as a pesticidally active ingredient/toxicant.\n\nIn a further aspect, the present invention relates to a method for controlling (e.g., knocking down or killing) invertebrates such as insects, arachnids, larvae and eggs thereof, including but not limited to cockroaches, ants, flies, spiders, mites, aphids, thrips, whiteflies, loopers, worms, beetles, leafrollers, moths and weevils, by the application of pesticidally effective amounts of the pesticidal compositions of the present invention to a location where invertebrate pest control is desired.\n\nAny of the above technical effects, objects and/or advantages may be realized and attained by means of the compositions of the present invention and particularly recited in the appended claims and/or supported by this written description. Additional objects and attendant advantages of the present invention will be set forth, in part, in the description that follows, or may be learned from practicing or using the present invention. It is to be understood that the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not to be viewed as being restrictive of the invention, as claimed.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nThe accompanying drawings, if any are filed herewith, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification, illustrate the present invention and, together with the description, serves to exemplify the principles of the present invention.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n\nAll patents, patent applications and literature cited in this description are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\nThe inventors have surprisingly found that the pesticidal compositions containing isopropyl myristate or isopropyl palmitate, as a synergist for at least one plant essential oil compound have a broad spectrum of activity and are particularly effective against, but not limited to, insects having a cuticle or proteinaceous exoskeleton or the like. Furthermore, the composition according to the present invention, comprises additional natural or essential oils as additional components and is therefore particularly advantageous in terms of its relative non-toxicity.\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the pesticidal compositions of the present invention contain (1) a pesticidally acceptable carrier (including inert ingredients), (2) a pesticidally active ingredient (toxicant) comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of at least one plant essential oil compound; and (3) a synergist comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of isopropyl myristate or analogs thereof (e.g., isopropyl palmitate). In another preferred embodiment, the pesticidal composition of the present invention are useful in methods for controlling (repelling, knocking down and/or killing) pests, including insects, arachnids, larvae and eggs thereof, comprising applying to a locus where control is desired a pesticidally-effective amount of the pesticidal composition of the present invention.\n\nThe present invention provides very efficacious pesticides that, in a preferred aspect, may be designated as biopesticides in that they comprise a chemical substance of natural origin that can be synthesized. The preferred pesticidal composition of the present invention have a lethal effect on pest targets. Unlike the bulk of currently available pesticides on the market, the preferred pesticidal compositions have active ingredients that have been proven to be substantially non-toxic to man and domestic animals and which have minimal adverse effects on wildlife and the environment.\n\nThe pesticidal compositions of the present invention are advantageous in that they can typically control pests at average or lower than average dosage rates. Such pesticidal compositions are also advantageous in that they can provide extended protection to a locus. Further, such pesticidal compositions are also advantageous in that said pesticidal compositions control pests without introducing a notable amount of harm to the surrounding environment of which the provided pesticidal composition is being utilized.\n\nThe pesticidal compositions of the invention have pesticidal activity against one or more pests. However, it is understood that certain pesticidal compositions may be more effectiv"
