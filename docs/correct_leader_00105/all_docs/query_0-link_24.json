Mr. Clemenceau proposes the nomination of a permanent president.\n\nThe President of the United States (speaking in English), proposes the name of M. Clemenceau as President of the Conference, as follows: [Page 165]\n\nHis words are immediately translated into French.\n\nMr. Lloyd George (Great Britain), speaking in English, seconds the proposal of the President of the United States, as follows:\n\nHis words are immediately translated into French.\n\nBaron Sonnino (Italy), associates himself with the words just spoken, and expresses himself thus:\n\nThe proposal of President Wilson, seconded by Mr. Lloyd George and Baron Sonnino, is put to the vote and unanimously adopted.\n\nMr. Clemenceau is declared President of the Conference.\n\nThe President proposes that the Conference should proceed to the election of Vice Presidents to the number of four, chosen from the Plenipotentiaries of each of the four Great Powers not yet represented in the Bureau, namely (in alphabetical order): United States of America, the British Empire, Italy and Japan.\n\nThis proposal is unanimously accepted.\n\nThe President announces that the Japanese Plenipotentiaries have proposed, for their part, Marquis Saionji.\n\nThe Conference then proceeds to the nomination of a Secretary General.\n\nThe President proposes M. Dutasta, Ambassador of France.\n\nThis proposal is also unanimously adopted.\n\nThe President then proposes to complete the Secretariat by the nomination of one secretary for each Great Power, with the right of substitution.\n\nThis proposal is accepted.\n\nThe President adds that it is necessary to proceed to the appointment of a Drafting Committee composed of one representative of the United States of America, the British Empire, France, Italy and Japan.\n\nThis proposal is accepted.\n\nFinally, the President observes that a Committee on Credentials should be formed to include a Plenipotentiary of each of the five Great Powers.\n\nThis proposal is adopted. (Annex 1.)\n\nThe President, passing to the order of the day of the Session, delivers (speaking in French), the following speech:\n\nThe President lays on the table the rules of the conference, for distribution among the delegates. (Annex 2).\n\nPassing, then, to the last part of the order of the day of the Session, the President announces that the questions contained in it are the following:\n\n(1)\n\nThe responsibility of the authors of the war;\n\n(2)\n\nThe penalty for the crimes committed during the war;\n\n(3)\n\nInternational legislation on labor.\n\nThe President declares that the Delegates of all powers represented are invited to hand in memoranda on these three questions. He also begs the representatives of the powers who have special interests to deliver to the Secretariat General memoranda on questions of every kind—territorial, financial, or economic—which particularly interest them. This method is somewhat new, but it has not seemed right to impose upon the Conference a particular order of work. To gain time, powers are invited first to make known their claims. All the peoples represented at the Conference can put forward, not only demands which concern themselves, but also demands of a general character. The Delegations are begged to present these memoranda as soon as possible.\n\nOn these memoranda a comprehensive work will be compiled for submission to the Conference. The third question, relative to international legislation on labor, can even be treated from the point of view of the organization of labor; it therefore covers a very wide field.\n\nThe President draws the attention of the Conference to the urgency of the first question, concerning the responsibility of the authors of the war. It is unnecessary to state the reason for this; if it is wished to establish law in the world, penalties for the breach thereof can be applied at once, since the allied and associated powers are victorious. These penalties will be demanded against the authors of the abominable crimes committed during the war. This first question is, indeed, the subject of a memorandum by Mr. Larnaude, Dean of the Faculty of Law of Paris, and Mr. de Lapradelle, Professor of International Law of the same Faculty, published under the following title: “Examen de la Responsabilité Pénale de l’Empereur Guillaume II.” This memorandum will be distributed by the Secretariat-General to all the Delegations.\n\n[Page 170]\n\nIn England and in America works have also been published on this point.\n\nThis program of work having met with general approval, the President informs the Conference that at the head of the order of the day of the next Session stands the question of the League of Nations.\n\nFinally, the President thinks right to add that as the different Delegations are to work in complete agreement, each member of the Conference is invited to present such observations as he may consider necessary. The Bureau will welcome the expression of any opinion which may be manifested and will reply to all questions asked of it.\n\nAs nobody wishes to speak, the session is adjourned at 16:35 o’clock (4:35 p.m.).\n\nAnnex I\n\nBureau of the Conference\n\nPresident:\n\nMr. Georges Clémenceau (France)\n\nVice Presidents:\n\nHon.

In case of disagreement as to the wording of such communiqués, the matter shall be referred to the chief Plenipotentiaries or their representatives.\n\nIX\n\nAll documents to be incorporated in the protocols must be supplied in writing by the Plenipotentiaries originally responsible for them.\n\nNo document or proposal may be so supplied except by a Plenipotentiary or in his name.\n\nX\n\nWith a view to facilitate discussion, any Plenipotentiary wishing to propose a resolution must give the President twenty-four hours’ notice thereof, except in the case of proposals connected with the order of the day and arising from the actual discussion.\n\nExceptions may, however, be made to this rule in the case of amendments or secondary questions which do not constitute actual proposals.\n\nXI\n\nAll petitions, memoranda, observations and documents addressed to the Conference by any persons other than the Plenipotentiaries must be received and classified by the Secretariat.\n\nSuch of these communications as are of any political interest shall be briefly summarized in a list circulated to all the Plenipotentiaries. Supplementary editions of this list shall be issued as such communications are received.\n\nAll these documents shall be deposited in the archives.\n\nXII\n\nAll questions to be decided shall be discussed at a first and second reading; the former shall afford occasion for a general discussion for the purpose of arriving at an agreement on points of principle; the second reading shall provide an opportunity of discussing details.\n\n[Page 175]\n\nXIII\n\nThe Plenipotentiaries shall be entitled, subject to the approval of the Conference, to authorize their Technical Delegates to submit direct any technical explanations considered desirable regarding any particular question.\n\nIf the Conference shall think fit, the study of any particular question from the technical point of view may be entrusted to a Committee composed of Technical Delegates, who shall be instructed to present a report and suggest solutions.\n\nXVI\n\nThe protocols drawn up by the Secretariat shall be printed and circulated in proof to the Delegates with the least possible delay.\n\nTo save time, this circulation of the protocols in advance shall take the place of reading them at the beginning of the sessions. Should no alterations be demanded by the Plenipotentiaries, the text shall be considered as approved and deposited in the archives.\n\nShould any alteration be called for, it shall be read aloud by the President at the beginning of the following session.\n\nThe whole of the protocol shall, however, be read if one of the Plenipotentiary members shall so request.\n\nXV\n\nA committee shall be formed to draft the motions adopted.\n\nThis Committee shall deal only with questions which have been decided; its sole task shall be to draw up the text of the decisions adopted and to present them to the Conference for approval.\n\nIt shall consist of five members who shall not be Plenipotentiary Delegates and shall comprise one representative each of the United States of America, the British Empire, France, Italy and Japan."
