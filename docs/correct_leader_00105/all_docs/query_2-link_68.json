        "text": "Investigations are being conducted into the fire that ravaged the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France earlier this week. While the fate of its contents are uncertain, there is hope that many of the significant artifacts are unharmed and that the spire will be rebuilt.\n\nRalph Kingston, an associate professor of European history (Revolutionary Era), researches the history of Paris and the cultural, intellectual, and social histories of eighteenth-and nineteenth-century France. In our interview below, Kingston shares the history of the cathedral, and the possible fate of its relics.\n\nWhat artifacts in the cathedral are historians most concerned about being damaged or destroyed?\n\nAs well as the crown of thorns, Notre Dame holds a number of relics brought back by Saint Louis (Louis IX) from his two Crusades, including the saint’s own tunic. These most precious relics have been saved. Among the relics that are still missing are another fragment from the crown of thorns and relics of Saint Geneviève and Saint Denis, which were placed in the cathedral’s spire in order to protect the building. The copper rooster in which they were placed has been found in the rubble but it was smashed open.\n\nWhat has been lost is not yet clear. The Cathedral contained a number of seventeenth-century paintings in the side chapels, which will inevitably have suffered significant damage from the smoke, if not from the fire. The Great Organ and the enormous thirteenth-century stain glass “Rose” windows seem to have, despite all odds, survived. If they are severely damaged, it will not be for the first time. A number of panes in the south Rose window were damaged in 1831, and so it contains both medieval and nineteenth century glass.\n\nHas something like this ever happened to this structure? If not, what kinds of natural forces/disasters, or wars, has it withstood?\n\nNothing quite like this has ever happened to the main cathedral. The archbishop’s palace, which used to adjoin the cathedral, was blown up in 1831. Rubble was piled up to start a fire in 1871 during the Paris Commune, but it was never lit. Occupied Paris was spared the sort of bombing that devastated other European cities, like London and Berlin, during World War II.\n\nThat said, the building has been built and rebuilt a number of times during its lifetime, however. This was particularly true during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In the eighteenth century, all the stainglass, except that in the Rose windows, were removed and replaced with clear glazing in order to allow more light into the interior. In 1771, the architect Jacques-Germain Soufflot (who designed the Pantheon in Paris) removed the lintels in the west portal, to allow the passage of the processions. During the French Revolution, symbols of monarchy were removed from the façade. As a result, much of the gothic impact of the Cathedral as we know it was constructed in the nineteenth century.\n\nWhen was the last time you visited the Notre Dame Cathedral?\n\nI visited Notre Dame while I was in Paris last November and I was reminded first and foremost of its importance as a site of religious worship. Mass is said at least five times a day. All around the perimeter of the cathedral are the 27 side chapels, where devotees light candles and say prayers. They are relatively simple architecturally, but decorated in vibrant colors, with statues, paintings, and frescos depicting biblical stories and the lives of the saints. The chapels are devoted to particular saints – including St. Vincent de Paul (for whom the international voluntary organization, Society of Saint Vincent de Paul is named) Saint Geneviève (the patron saint of Paris), Francis-Xavier (the Jesuit missionary), and Our Lady of Guadalupe. The chapel of Our Lady of Guadalupe dates back only to 1963 and was dedicated on the request of Mexicans living in Paris. Notre Dame de Paris is also home to one of the most important relics in Catholicism – the crown of thorns brought back from Jerusalem by Saint Louis in the thirteenth century. It is brought out once a month but otherwise kept safe in the sacristy (which is one of the reasons it has survived the fire).\n\nWhat is a fact or something notable you think is important for people to know about the spire or the cathedral?\n\nNotre Dame can and will rise again. The spire that collapsed a few days ago was the one that was constructed in the 1860s, as part of Viollet-le-Duc’s renovation of the cathedral. The original spire was taken down in 1786.\n\nIt will be more difficult to replace will be the oak rafters in the cathedral’s roofs. The “forest” as it is sometimes called, contains the wood of about 13,000 mature oak trees – that is to say trees that were themselves already at least a century and a half old. Some beams were cut in the twelfth century, and many more from the thirteenth, and the roof is one of the oldest parts of the structure. Mature oak forests are few and far between in modern Europe, and those that exist are highly protected. Whatever the architects who win the contract to rebuild Notre Dame propose, it is unlikely they will be rebuilding with the same materials.\n\nDo you think it’s possible to re-build or restore the spire?\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has promised that the French state (which owns the building) will lead the effort to reconstruct the cathedral, though experts doubt his claim that it can be rebuilt in five years.\n\nAlmost inevitably, the reconstruction will turn into the kind of grand project that Paris became famous for at the end of the twentieth century, the most immediately familiar of which is the erection of the glass pyramid in the courtyard of the Louvre. It is unlikely that Notre Dame will be encased in glass (along the lines of the Reichstag dome in Berlin) but it is hard to see the spire being remade as an exact replica of its former self. What will limit the imagination of architects most is that several of the statues which have surrounded the spire since the nineteenth century were saved from the fire by virtue of the fact that they were in the South of France for restoration. I suspect that these “original” statues will figure somewhere in the plans to replace the spire.\n\nWhatever restoration plan is chosen, the cathedral will never quite be the same. Buildings are more than stone and wood, but the stone and the wood does matter. The particular acoustics of the cathedral, for example, are probably gone forever."
