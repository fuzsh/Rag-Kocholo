        "text": "November 27, 2006 at 1:40 pm | Posted in Globalization, History, Literary, Military, Research | Leave a comment\n\nPrimary Documents:\n\nPresident Poincare’s War Address, 4 August 1914\n\nWith Germany’s decision to declare war with France on 3 August 1914 the\n\nFrench government found itself swept along (and somewhat surprised) by a tide of popular\n\nenthusiasm, a jubilant mood evident throughout the European continent. Thus on the\n\nfollowing day, 4 August 1914 – the date Britain joined France and Russia in the war\n\nagainst Germany – the French President Raymond Poincare\n\nwrote the following speech (his first war address) which was read to the French parliament\n\nby the Minister of Justice. The text of his speech is reproduced below.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nFrance has just been the object of a violent and premeditated attack,\n\nwhich is an insolent defiance of the law of nations. Before any declaration of war had\n\nbeen sent to us, even before the German Ambassador had asked for his passports, our\n\nterritory has been violated. The German Empire has waited till yesterday evening to give\n\nat this late stage the true name to a state of things which it had already created.\n\nFor more than forty years the French, in sincere love of peace, have\n\nburied at the bottom of their heart the desire for legitimate reparation.\n\nThey have given to the world the example of a great nation which,\n\ndefinitely raised from defeat by the exercise of will, patience, and labour, has only used\n\nits renewed and rejuvenated strength in the interest of progress and for the good of\n\nhumanity.\n\nSince the ultimatum of Austria opened a crisis which threatened the\n\nwhole of Europe, France has persisted in following and in recommending on all sides a\n\npolicy of prudence, wisdom, and moderation.\n\nTo her there can be imputed no act, no movement, no word, which has not\n\nbeen peaceful and conciliatory.\n\nAt the hour when the struggle is beginning, she has the right, in\n\njustice to herself, of solemnly declaring that she has made, up to the last moment,\n\nsupreme efforts to avert the war now about to break out, the crushing responsibility for\n\nwhich the German Empire will have to bear before history. Our fine and courageous army,\n\nwhich France today accompanies with her maternal thought has risen eager to defend the\n\nhonour of the flag and the soil of the country.\n\nThe President of the Republic interpreting the unanimous feeling of the\n\ncountry, expresses to our troops by land and sea the admiration and confidence of every\n\nFrenchman.\n\nClosely united in a common feeling, the nation will persevere with the\n\ncool self-restraint of which, since the beginning of the crisis, she has given daily\n\nproof. Now, as always, she will know how to harmonise the most noble daring and most\n\nardent enthusiasm with that self-control which is the sign of enduring energy and is the\n\nbest guarantee of victory.\n\nIn the war which is beginning, France will have Right on her side, the\n\neternal power of which cannot with impunity be disregarded by nations any more than by\n\nindividuals.\n\nShe will be heroically defended by all her sons; nothing will break\n\ntheir sacred union before the enemy; today they are joined together as brothers in a\n\ncommon indignation against the aggressor, and in a common patriotic faith.\n\nShe is faithfully helped by Russia, her ally; she is supported by the\n\nloyal friendship of Great Britain.\n\nAnd already from every part of the civilised world sympathy and good\n\nwishes are coming to her. For today once again she stands before the universe for Liberty,\n\nJustice, and Reason.\n\n‘Haut les coeurs et vive la France!’\n\nWho’s Who: Raymond Poincare\n\nUpdated – Saturday, 11 August, 2001\n\nRaymond Poincare (1860-1934) was born on 20 August 1860 at Bar-le-duc\n\nin Lorraine, the son of an engineer.\n\nPoincare studied at the University of Paris, after which he became a\n\nlawyer.\n\nElected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1887, Poincare held various\n\ncabinet posts between 1893 and 1906, including the ministries of education and finance,\n\nentering the senate in 1903. At 33 he was the youngest person to hold a ministry in the\n\nhistory of the republic.\n\nPoincare became premier and foreign minister in January 1912 of a\n\ncoalition government and succeeded Armand Fallieres as president in January 1913,\n\ndefeating Georges Clemenceau.\n\nA conservative and a nationalist, as president Poincare moved to\n\nstrengthen France’s armed forces for the eventuality\n\nof war. A bill increasing the duration of national service to three years was passed,\n\nand alliances with Britain and Russia strengthened.\n\nDuring the First World War Poincare called upon Georges Clemenceau to\n\nform a government in 1917, despite his personal loathing of the man.\n\nFollowing the armistice\n\nPoincare called for harsh remedies against Germany, and for future guarantees of French\n\nsecurity. Partly frustrated in this, he consequently regarded the Versailles treaty as too lax in its treatment of\n\nGermany.\n\nUpon completion of his presidential term in January 1920 Poincare\n\nreturned to the senate, becoming leader of the coalition of conservative parties, the\n\n‘bloc national’. This in turn brought him to the premiership in January 1922.\n\nAs premier Poincare followed up his harsh rhetoric against Germany,\n\nsending troops to occupy the Ruhr in January 1923 to signify his anger at Germany’s\n\nfailure to pay the heavy reparations imposed at Versailles. Nevertheless he failed to\n\ncoerce Germany into making payments.\n\nAt the election of May 1924 the conservatives suffered defeat, causing\n\nPoincare to resign; he was replaced as prime minister by Edouard Herriot. He returned to\n\nthe premiership in July 1926 in the midst of a financial crisis. He dealt with this by\n\ninitiating an extreme deflationary policy, balancing the budget and stabilising the Franc\n\nat one fifth of its former value, in 1928.\n\nPoincare retired from office in July 1929 citing ill-health.\n\nRaymond Poincare died on 15 October 1934 in Paris.\n\nRaymond Poincare’s Welcoming Address\n\n18 January 1919\n\nGentlemen:\n\nFrance greets and welcomes you and thanks you for having unanimously\n\nchosen as the seat of your labours the city which, for over four years, the enemy has made\n\nhis principal military objective and which the valour of the Allied armies has\n\nvictoriously defended against unceasingly renewed offensives.\n\nAllow me to see in your decision the homage of all the nations that you\n\nrepresent towards a country which, still more than any others, has endured the sufferings\n\nof war, of which entire provinces, transformed into vast battlefields, have been\n\nsystematically wasted by the invader, and which has paid the heaviest tribute to death.\n\nFrance has borne these enormous sacrifices without having incurred the\n\nslightest responsibility for the frightful cataclysm which has overwhelmed the universe,\n\nand at the moment when this cycle of horror is ending, all the Powers whose delegates are\n\nassembled here may acquit themselves of any share in the crime which has resulted in so\n\nunprecedented a disaster.\n\nWhat gives you authority to establish a peace of justice is the fact\n\nthat none of the peoples of whom you are the delegates has had any part in injustice.\n\nHumanity can place confidence in you because you are not among those who have outraged the\n\nrights of humanity.\n\nThere is no need of further information or for special inquiries into\n\nthe origin of the drama which has just shaken the world. The truth, bathed in blood, has\n\nalready escaped from the Imperial archives. The premeditated character of the trap is\n\ntoday clearly proved.\n\nIn the hope of conquering, first, the hegemony of Europe and next the\n\nmastery of the world, the Central Empires, bound together by a secret plot, found the most\n\nabominable pretexts for trying to crush Serbia and force their way to the East. At the\n\nsame time they disowned the most solemn undertakings in order to crush Belgium and force\n\ntheir way into the heart of France.\n\nThese are the two unforgettable outrages which opened the way to\n\naggression. The combined efforts of Great Britain, France, and Russia broke themselves\n\nagainst that mad arrogance.\n\nIf, after long vicissitudes, those who wished to reign by the sword\n\nhave perished by the sword, they have but themselves to blame; they have been destroyed by\n\ntheir own blindness. What could be more significant than the shameful bargains they\n\nattempted to offer to Great Britain and France at the end of July 1914, when to Great\n\nBritain they suggested: “Allow us to attack France on land and we will notenter the Channel”; and\n\nwhen they instructed their Ambassador to say to France: “We will only accept a\n\ndeclaration of neutrality on your part if you surrender to us Briey, Toul, and\n\nVerdun”?\n\nIt is in the light of these memories, gentlemen, that all the\n\nconclusions you will have to draw from the war will take shape.\n\nYour nations entered the war successively, but came, one and all, to\n\nthe help of threatened right. Like Germany, Great Britain and France had guaranteed the\n\nindependence of Belgium.\n\nGermany sought to crush Belgium. Great Britain and France both swore to\n\nsave her. Thus, from the very beginning of hostilities, came into conflict the two ideas\n\nwhich for fifty months were to struggle for the dominion of the world – the idea of\n\nsovereign force, which accepts neither control nor check, and the idea of justice, which\n\ndepends on the sword only to prevent or repress the abuse of strength.\n\nFaithfully supported by her Dominions and Colonies, Great Britain\n\ndecided that she could not remain aloof from a struggle in which the fate of every country\n\nwas involved. She has made, and her Dominions and Colonies have made with her, prodigious\n\nefforts to prevent the war from ending in the triumph of the spirit ofconquest and the destruction\n\nof right.\n\nJapan, in her turn, only decided to take up arms out of loyalty to\n\nGreat Britain, her great Ally, and from the consciousness of the danger in which both Asia\n\nand Europe would have stood, for the hegemony of which the Germanic Empires had dreamt.\n\nItaly, who from the first had refused to lend a helping hand to German\n\nambition, rose against an age-long foe only to answer the call of oppressed populations\n\nand to destroy at the cost of her blood the artificial political combination which took no\n\naccount of human liberty.\n\nRumania resolved to fight only to realize that national unity which was\n\nopposed by the same powers of arbitrary force. Abandoned, betrayed, and strangled, she had\n\nto submit to an abominable treaty, the revision of which you will exact.\n\nGreece, whom the enemy for many months tried to turn from her\n\ntraditions and destinies, raised an army only to escape attempts at domination, of which\n\nshe felt the growing threat.\n\nPortugal, China, and Siam abandoned neutrality only to escape the\n\nstrangling pressure of the Central Powers.\n\nThus it was the extent of German ambitions that brought so many\n\npeoples, great and small, to form a league against the same adversary.\n\nAnd what shall I say of the solemn resolution taken by the United\n\nStates in the spring of 1917 under the auspices of their illustrious President, Mr.\n\nWilson, whom I am happy to greet here in the name of grateful France, and, if you will\n\nallow me to say so, gentlemen, in the name of all the nations represented in this room?\n\nWhat shall I say of the many other American Powers which either\n\ndeclared themselves against Germany – Brazil, Cuba, Panama, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Haiti,\n\nHonduras – or at least broke off diplomatic relations – Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador,Uruguay?\n\nFrom north to south the New World rose with indignation when it saw the\n\nempires of Central Europe, after having let loose the war without provocation and without\n\nexcuse, carry it on with fire, pillage, and massacre of inoffensive beings.\n\nThe intervention of the United States was something more, something\n\ngreater, than a great political and military event: it was a supreme judgment passed at\n\nthe bar of history by the lofty conscience of a free people and their Chief Magistrate on\n\nthe enormous responsibilities incurred in the frightful conflict which was lacerating\n\nhumanity.\n\nIt was not only to protect themselves from the audacious aims of German\n\nmegalomania that the United States equipped fleets and created immense armies,but also, and above all, to\n\ndefend an ideal of liberty over which they saw the huge shadow of the Imperial Eagle\n\nencroaching farther every day.\n\nAmerica, the daughter of Europe, crossed the ocean to wrest her mother\n\nfrom the humiliation of thraldom and to save civilization. The American people wished to\n\nput an end to the greatest scandal that has ever sullied the annals of mankind.\n\nAutocratic governments, having prepared in the secrecy of the Chancelleries and the General Staff a map programme of universal domination, at the time fixed by their genius for intrigue let loose their packs and sounded the horns for the chase, ordering science at the very time when it was beginning to abolish distances, bring men closer, and make life sweeter, to leave the bright sky towards which it was soaring and to place itself submissively at the service of violence, lowering the religious idea to the extent of making God the complacent auxiliary of their passions and the accomplice of their crimes; in short, counting as naught the traditions and wills of peoples, the lives of citizens, the honour of women, and all those principles of public and private morality which we for our part have endeavoured to keep unaltered through the war and which neither nations nor individuals can repudiate or disregard with impunity.\n\nWhile the conflict was gradually extending over the entire surface of the earth the clanking of chains was heard here and there, and captive nationalities from the depths of their age-long jails cried out to us for help.\n\nYet more, they escaped to come to our aid. Poland came to life again and sent us troops. The Czecho-Slovaks won their right to independence in Siberia, in France, and in Italy. The Jugo-Slays, the Armenians, the Syrians and Lebanese, the Arabs, all the oppressed peoples, all the victims, long helpless or resigned, of great historic deeds of injustice, all the martyrs of the past, all the outraged consciences, all the strangled liberties revived at the clash of our arms, and turnedtowards us, as their natural defenders.\n\nThus the war gradually attained the fullness of its first significance, and became, in the fullest sense of the term, a crusade of humanity for Right; and if anything can console us in part at least, for the losses we have suffered, it is assuredly the thought that our victory is also the victory of Right.\n\nThis victory is complete, for the enemy only asked for the armistice to escape from an irretrievable military disaster. In the interest of justice and peace it now rests with you to reap from this victory its full fruits in order to carry out this immense task. You have decided to admit, at first, only the Allied or associated Powers, and, in so far as their interests are involved in the debates, the nations which remained neutral.\n\nYou have thought that the terms of peace ought to be settled among ourselves before they are communicated to those against whom we have together fought the good fight. The solidarity which has united us during the war and has enabled us to win military success ought to remain unimpaired during the negotiations for, and after the signing of, the Treaty.\n\nIt is not only governments, but free peoples, who are represented here.\n\nThrough the test of danger they have learned to know and help one another. They want their\n\nintimacy of yesterday to assure the peace of tomorrow. V ainly would our enemies seek to\n\ndivide us. If they have not yet renounced their customary manoeuvres, they will soon find\n\nthat they are meeting today, as during the hostilities, a homogeneous block which nothing\n\nwill be able to disintegrate.\n\nEven before the armistice you placed that necessary unity under the\n\nstandard of the lofty moral and political truths of which President Wilson has nobly made\n\nhimself the interpreter.\n\nAnd in the light of those truths you intend to accomplish your mission.\n\nYou will, therefore, seek nothing but justice, “justice that has no favourites,”\n\njustice in territorial problems, justice in financial problems, justice in economic\n\nproblems.\n\nBut justice is not inert, it does not submit to injustice. What it\n\ndemands first, when it has been violated, are restitution and reparation for the peoples\n\nand individuals who have been despoiled or maltreated. In formulating this lawful claim,\n\nit obeys neither hatred nor an instinctive or thoughtless desire for reprisals. It pursues\n\na twofold object – to render to each his due, and not to encourage crime through leaving\n\nit unpunished.\n\nWhat justice also demands, inspired by the same feeling, is the\n\npunishment of the guilty and effective guaranties against an active return of the spirit\n\nby which theywere\n\ntempted; and it is logical to demand that these guaranties should be given, above all, to\n\nthe nations that have been, and might again be most exposed to aggressions or threats, to\n\nthose who have many times stood in danger of being submerged by the periodic tide of the\n\nsame invasions.\n\nWhat justice banishes is the dream of conquest and imperialism,\n\ncontempt for national will, the arbitrary exchange of provinces between states as though\n\npeoples were but articles of furniture or pawns in a game.\n\nThe time is no more when diplomatists could meet to redraw with\n\nauthority the map of the empires on the corner of a table. If you are to remake the map of\n\nthe world it is in the name of the peoples, and on condition that you shall faithfully\n\ninterpret their thoughts, and respect the right of nations, small and great, to dispose of\n\nthemselves, and to reconcile it with the right, equally sacred, of ethnical and religious\n\nminorities – a formidable task, which science and history, your two advisers, will\n\ncontribute to illumine and facilitate.\n\nYou will naturally strive to secure the material and moral means of\n\nsubsistence for all those peoples who are constituted or reconstituted into states; for\n\nthose who wish to unite themselves to their neighbours; for those who divide themselves\n\ninto separate units; for those who reorganize themselves according to their regained traditions; and, lastly, for all those whose freedom you have already sanctioned or are about to sanction.\n\nYou will not call them into existence only to sentence them to death\n\nimmediately. You would like your work in this, as in all other matters, to be fruitful and lasting.\n\nWhile thus introducing into the world as much harmony as possible, you will, in conformity with the fourteenth of the propositions unanimously adopted by the Great Allied Powers, establish a general League of Nations, which will be a supreme guarantee against any fresh assaults upon the right of peoples.\n\nYou do not intend this International Association to be directed against anybody in future. It will not of set purpose shut out anybody, but, having been organized by the nations that have sacrificed themselves in defence of Right, it will receive from them its statutes and fundamental rules. It will lay down conditions to which its present or future adherents will submit, and, as it is to have for its essential aim to prevent, as far as. possible, the renewal of wars, it will, above all, seek to gain respect for the peace which you will have established, and will find it the less difficult to maintain in proportion as this peace will in itself imply greater realities of justice and safer guaranties of stability.\n\nBy establishing this new order of things you will meet the aspiration of humanity, which, after the frightful convulsions of these bloodstained years, ardently wishes to feel itself protected by a union of free peoples against the ever-possible revivals of primitive savagely.\n\nAn immortal glory will attach to the names of the nations and the men who have desired to co-operate in this grand work in faith and brotherhood, and who have taken pains to eliminate from the future peace causes of disturbance and instability.\n\nThis very day forty-eight years ago, on January 18, 1871, the German Empire was proclaimed by an army of invasion in the Chateau at Versailles. It was consecrated by the theft of two French provinces; it was thus vitiated from its origin and by the fault of the founders; born in injustice, it has ended in opprobrium.\n\nYou are assembled in order to repair the evil that it has done and to prevent a recurrence of it. You hold in your hands the future of the world. I leave you, gentlemen, to your grave deliberations, and I declare the Conference of Paris open.\n\nSource: Source Records of the Great War, Vol. VII, ed. Charles F.
