        "text": "(1860–1934). Of all the statesmen who shaped the policies of France during the early years of the 20th century, none believed more strongly than Raymond Poincaré that war with Germany was inevitable. He worked harder than anyone else to prepare France for the conflict of World War I.\n\nPoincaré was born on Aug. 20, 1860, in Bar-le-Duc, France, and was educated at the École Polytechnique and the University of Paris. He was elected to parliament in 1887 and held several cabinet posts before becoming premier in 1912. Following an anti-German policy, he cemented France’s friendship with Great Britain and Russia. In 1913 he was elected president, and he continued in this office throughout World War I. In the Peace Conference he fought for the infliction of harsh terms on Germany.\n\nAt the end of his term of office, in 1920, Poincaré was reelected to the Senate, and twice more he was called on to serve as premier. He was holding the office of premier in 1923 when France marched troops into Germany’s Ruhr River region to force reparations payments by Germany. In 1926–28 he saved France from disaster by stabilizing the franc. Poincaré died in Paris on Oct. 15, 1934."
