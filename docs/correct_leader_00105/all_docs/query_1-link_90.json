        "text": "Discovery of major hydrocarbon deposits in the Algerian Sahara. Oil was discovered in Algeria first at Edjeleh, then Hassi Messaoud (the largest deposit on the African continent at 1,600 km2), and then a natural gas deposit at Hassi R'Mel (the largest deposit in Africa and the second largest in the world at 2,400 km2). This marked a new phase in the development of the industry as a whole new infrastructure was required to enable the export of the natural gas to consumer areas. The world's first natural gas liquefaction plant was built at Arzew, where the gas from Hassi R'mel flowed. The creation of that plant was a technological and logistical feat, and marked TotalEnergies' first steps (with an 11% stake) into the liquefied natural gas (LNG) business; a presence that has continued to grow ever since.\n\nPicture caption: Storage tanks at the Hassi Messaoud CFP-A, Algeria, 1959\n\nDiscovery of the first marine oil field at Umm Shaïf, off the coast of Abu Dhabi. The first offshore oil extraction operation began in 1962, and owed its discovery to underwater reconnaissance campaigns carried out aboard the Calypso. The legendary ship of Commandant Jacques Cousteau was made available to oil companies as part of an agreement signed in 1951 to finance his expeditions. The Compagnie française des pétroles and its French engineers, who were heavily involved in the preparatory studies, acquired solid skills in offshore exploration and production, marking the start of the business for the future TotalEnergies.\n\nPicture caption: Inauguration in Sheikh Shakhbut’s palace of the installation of the Adma platform in the Umm Shaif oil field, in the presence of the Sheikh and Victor de Metz, Chairman and CEO of CFP, Abu Dhabi, 1962\n\nDiscovery of major oil deposits off the coast of Gabon, first at Anguille, then at Torpille, Grondin, and Émeraude in the 1960s. This made Gabon one of Africa's leading oil producers. The future Elf group—which already had a presence in the Congo and Gabon since the 1950s through local subsidiaries under the banner of the Bureau de Recherche de Pétrole—consolidated its presence throughout the Gulf of Guinea. Drilling at the Anguille site required new equipment and specific techniques, which meant that the future Elf group further honed its skills in offshore operations.\n\nPicture caption: Île-de-France jack-up rig, Anguille permit, Gabon, 1968\n\nTotal acquired Direct Energie, France's third-largest supplier of green gas and electricity, strengthening its credentials in renewable energy production and retail sales. Direct Energie generates electricity from power stations, wind farms, and solar farms operated by its subsidiary Quadran. In this way, the company competes with the incumbent operators by offering low-cost alternative solutions based primarily on green energy. A strategy initiated in 2016 with the acquisition of Belgium's Lampiris, the country's third-largest gas and electricity supplier, whose electricity is 100% renewable (hydro, wind, solar). In 2017, the group also launched a renewable gas and electricity offer under its own brand in France: Total Spring.\n\nPicture caption: Direct Energie, 2018\n\nTotal took over ENGIE's upstream LNG (liquefied natural gas) assets, including long-term purchase contracts, regasification capacity in Europe, a fleet of LNG carriers, and a 16.6% stake in the Cameron LNG liquefaction plant in the United States. The company set about strengthening its position in liquefied natural gas; a transitional energy. Already very active in that market, that acquisition from Engie put it in the number two position worldwide. And by entering the Cameron LNG project, it became an integrated player in the American market, since it was already producing gas there. It also gave the group a leading position in the production and export of American LNG.\n\nPicture caption: Operators at the Cameron LNG liquefaction termina, Louisiana, United States, 2018\n\nWith the acquisition of Danish exploration-production company Maersk Oil, Total became the second largest operator in the North Sea. The most important external growth operation since the acquisition of Elf Aquitaine in 2000, that acquisition enabled the company to become the second largest operator in the North Sea, reinforcing its leading position in the UK and Norway, and extending its activities to Denmark. It came against a backdrop of falling oil prices: priority going to projects with low technical costs and less profitable assets being sold off. For existing projects, the group stepped up its efforts to achieve greater operational excellence, particularly in deep offshore operations (simplified design, shorter drilling times, use of existing facilities, etc.).\n\nPicture caption: Maersk Oil employee in the North Sea, Denmark, 2013\n\nTotal rebranded as TotalEnergies! A new identity that embodies the company's transformation into a multi-energy company (oil, gas, electricity, hydrogen, biomass, wind, solar) and its ambition to become a major player in the energy transition. A model and a strategy that took shape in the early 2020s with multiple multi-energy agreements and developments across the entire renewable energy chain: projects to recover flared gas from oil fields in order to supply power plants with gas; development of solar photovoltaic power plants and projects in Iraq and Libya; acquisition of Fonroche Biogaz in France, the French leader in renewable gas; green hydrogen project at the heart of the La Mède biorefinery near Marseille... These new projects are all part of the group's ambitions in terms of sustainable development, with particular attention to reducing the environmental footprint and emissions caused by its activities.\n\nPicture caption: Service-station rebranding in Ferch, Germany, 2021"
