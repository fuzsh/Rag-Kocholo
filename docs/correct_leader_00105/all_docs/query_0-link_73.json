Taken in 1920, Poincare is seen standing confidently in a formal suit, exuding an air of authority and leadership. Poincare's political career was marked by significant achievements and influence. Serving as Prime Minister of France on five occasions, he also held the position of President of the Republic from 1913 to 1920. This portrait reflects his role as a statesman during a crucial period in French history. The backdrop of World War I adds depth to this image, symbolizing the challenges faced by Poincare during his time in office. As one of the key figures leading France through this tumultuous era, he played an instrumental role in shaping national policies and strategies. The monochrome aesthetic enhances the gravity and seriousness associated with Poincare's political stature. His expression reveals determination and resolve, embodying his commitment to serving his country. This photograph is part of \"Album de Photographies: Dans L'Intimite de Personnages Illustres\" showcasing influential individuals from 1850-1950 Paris. It serves as both a historical document capturing an important figure in French politics and a testament to Poincare's enduring legacy as a respected leader who navigated France through challenging times.\n\nMADE IN AUSTRALIA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
