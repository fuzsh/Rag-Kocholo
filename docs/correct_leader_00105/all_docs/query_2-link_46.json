        "text": "Early political career\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nWorld War I Quiz\n\nFive days after his marriage, Clemenceau returned to France and established himself as a doctor in Vendée. But politics soon took him back to Paris. In July 1870, Napoleon III declared war on Germany. Less than two months later, the French were defeated at Sedan and the empire collapsed. Clemenceau was among the crowd that invaded the Palais-Bourbon on September 4 and hailed the radical leader Léon Gambetta, who was proclaiming the republic. Soon afterward, Clemenceau was named mayor of the 18th arrondissement (district) of Paris (Montmartre) and, on February 8, 1871, was elected as a Radical Republican deputy to represent the Seine département in the National Assembly held in Bordeaux. He voted against the preliminaries of the harsh peace terms demanded by Germany and left Bordeaux determined to avenge France’s “shameful humiliation.”\n\nBack in Paris, he became involved in the insurrection known as the Paris Commune and tried to mediate between its leaders and the National Assembly, then meeting at Versailles. He was not successful and, therefore, resigned as mayor and deputy (March 27, 1871). In 1876 he stood again for the Chamber of Deputies and was elected for the 18th arrondissement. He joined the extreme left, and his energy and mordant eloquence speedily made him the leader of the Radical bloc.\n\nIn 1877, in the constitutional crisis precipitated on le seize mai (May 16), when Pres. Patrice MacMahon attempted to make the government responsible to him rather than to the National Assembly, Clemenceau took a leading part in resisting such antirepublican policy. In 1880 he started his newspaper, La Justice, which became the principal organ of the Radicals in Paris; from that time onward, throughout the presidency (1879–87) of Jules Grévy, he rapidly built up his reputation as a political critic of republicans and radicals as well as of conservatives and as a destroyer of ministries who would not, however, take office himself. Hostile to the colonial expansion that was dispersing the resources of a weakened France, he mercilessly attacked its promoters, and in 1885 his use of a minor reverse in Tongking (Indochina; now Vietnam) was the principal factor in the fall of Jules Ferry’s cabinet. At the elections of 1885, he was returned both for his old seat in Paris and for the département of Var, for which he chose to sit. Refusing to form a ministry himself, because he could not command a majority in the Senate, he supported the government of Charles de Freycinet in 1886 and was responsible for the inclusion in the cabinet of Gen. Georges Boulanger as minister of war. Clemenceau had mistakenly imagined Boulanger to be a republican, but when he showed himself an irresponsible demagogue and nationalist, a focus for both Bonapartist and monarchist support, Clemenceau became a vigorous opponent of the Boulangist movement and helped to form the League of the Rights of Man to press for radical reforms.\n\nBy his share in the exposure of President Grévy’s son-in-law for trafficking in honours, Clemenceau caused the resignation of another prime minister, Maurice Rouvier, in 1887. Yet he refused Grévy’s request that he form a ministry and intrigued to keep various other leaders out of office. His destructive political power won him an ever-increasing number of enemies, and his implication in the scandal of 1892, caused by the failure of the French Panama Canal Company (Compagnie Universelle du Canal Interocéanique), gave them all—especially the Boulangists—an unrivalled opportunity for revenge. Clemenceau’s associations with the Jewish financier Cornélius Herz, who was deeply involved in the affair, inevitably threw suspicion on him; later he was accused of being in the pay of the British Foreign Office. The attack on Clemenceau was mounted in the powerful daily newspaper, Le Petit Journal; it took a dramatic turn when, in the Chamber of Deputies on December 20, 1892, the author and Boulangist Paul Déroulède denounced him as the protégé and supporter of Herz. Clemenceau claimed that Déroulède was lying and challenged him to a duel, in which neither was hurt. More effectively, Clemenceau brought a successful lawsuit against his detractors. Their condemnation forced some of them to resign as deputies, but in the end they took Clemenceau with them. All the accumulated venom he had aroused was concentrated in the election of 1893 when, standing again for the Var département, Clemenceau was attacked on all sides. Despite conducting an exhaustive and brilliant campaign, he was defeated.\n\nBut Clemenceau was too much of a fighter to give in to discouragement. He started upon a serious career in journalism and, after a difficult beginning, came to be classed among the foremost political writers of his time. A new Clemenceau was revealed: a man of reflection, of vast culture, a friend of the best known writers and artists of the period. An ardent supporter of the Impressionists, he especially favoured the work of Monet: after World War I he arranged for a series of Monet’s paintings to be exhibited in the Orangerie in the Tuileries Gardens.\n\nAt the same time, Clemenceau was writing books, mainly political and sociological, but his Au pied du Sinaï (At the Foot of Mount Sinai, 1922), illustrated by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, was a volume of sketches on the history of the Jewish people. He also tried his hand at writing a play.\n\nHe was, however, essentially a journalist and inevitably wrote much about the Dreyfus case, which agitated France from 1894 to 1906. At first Clemenceau had assumed that the young Jewish officer Alfred Dreyfus had, indeed, been guilty of selling secrets to Germany. But, once convinced of his innocence, Clemenceau carried on an eight-year battle (1897–1905) in his newspapers La Justice and L’Aurore (founded in 1897). Clemenceau’s support for Dreyfus brought him back into favour with his fellow republicans, and he was prevailed upon to accept election as senator for Var in April 1902.\n\nThis election was of vital importance in the political career of Clemenceau. He remained a senator from Var until 1920, the year in which he voluntarily ended his political activity. It was as senator that he was to show his greatest qualities as a statesman. He became a member of the cabinet in 1906 as interior minister and was premier from 1906 to 1909. Finally, in 1917, after three years of World War I, when France’s morale and resources were at their lowest ebb, he accepted Pres. Raymond Poincaré’s invitation to head the war government (1917–20). His steadfast and ruthless pursuit of war brought him the title “Father of Victory.”\n\nAs minister of the interior, Clemenceau faced difficult problems, notably the enforcement of the new law (1905) separating church and state, as well as serious labour problems. When a strike of miners in the Pas-de-Calais led to a threat of disorder in 1906, he resolved to employ the military. His attitude in this matter alienated the Socialist Party, from which he definitely broke in a notable speech. It marked him, however, as the “strong man” of the day in French politics, and, when the ministry of Ferdinand Sarrien resigned in October 1906, Clemenceau became premier. During 1907 and 1908 the new entente with England was cemented. In Morocco, a dispute between France and Germany over the harbouring in the German consulate of German deserters from the French Foreign Legion brought renewed tension between the two countries. Austria-Hungary urged calmness on the Germans, and in February 1909 a joint agreement was signed, recognizing the economic interests of Germany and the special political interests of France in Morocco. The Clemenceau government fell on July 20, 1909, Clemenceau resigning after a violent and unexpected argument with the influential statesman Théophile Delcassé.\n\nFreed from the responsibilities of power, Clemenceau travelled abroad. He took advantage of this opportunity to make speeches in Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil on the subject of democracy. “I am a soldier of democracy,” he said. “It is the only form of government which can establish equality for all, and which can bring closer the ultimate goals: freedom and justice.”"
