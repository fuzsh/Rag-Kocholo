        "meta_description": "The success of Marcel Pagnol's business model was unmatched in 1930s French cinema, offering industry insiders and the general public welcome proof that their nation could defend its unique cultural identity against Americanisation and could compete economically with foreign pictures at home and abroad. From Louis Lumière's invention of the 'cinématographe' in 1895 through the end of the First World War, French films accounted for roughly 80 per cent of all those in circulation worldwide. At the peak of the crisis between 1933 and 1936, some 260 French producers declared bankruptcy and the cinema industry operated at deficit. With a large reserve of capital at his disposal from his career as a playwright and the immensely successful screen adaptations of Marius and Fanny on-screen, Pagnol was uniquely positioned to implement an artisanal model of filmmaking that was immune to the problems plaguing the rest of the industry.",
