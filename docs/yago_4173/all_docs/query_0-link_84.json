        "text": "Snow White's dance in the clouds\n\nOne dream that Walt Disney took over twenty years to materialize was a dance sequence in the clouds between one of his Princesses and her Prince. Since the very first feature film, a lyrical scene was planned right after Snow White had sung Some Day My Prince Will Come, and she was daydreaming that she and Prince Charming were floating in some kind of swan-boat pulled by star-shaped angels. Then they would dance among the clouds during an instrumental reprise of the song. Snow White would wear a different dress in that scene, one that would inspire the ones used for some dolls.\n\nThe scene never went beyond the stage of storyboard. Disney felt it had to be dropped for several reasons. First of all, it stopped the pacing of the story dead: no new plot element was introduced in the sequence and it could only be a visual treat. But the major problem was that he feared that they may not manage to reach that level of perfection on a relatively reasonable (and already exploding) budget because the Prince's animation was too difficult to handle for most animators.\n\nGone was the scene. The next opportunity was of course Cinderella. One could argue that Cinderella does dance with her Prince this time, and that the evocative backgrounds of the sequence could evoke a cloudy sky at some point. But, as short as it is, the final scene of Sleeping Beauty is clearly the finalized sequence closest to the original intent.\n\nBut in my book, Aurora is no Snow White and the few seconds of waltz in Sleeping Beauty cannot compare to the lengthy unproduced dance sequence of Snow White and her magic stars. There are two other ways of seeing what a dance between the two characters would have looked like.\n\nYou can watch the bonus section of your Blu-ray edition of the film where the beautiful storyboards have been filmed in sequence or... you can buy the DVD of the Marx brothers' movie A Night at the Opera.\n\nAt this point, you probably think I'm pulling your leg. Although I consider it a great film, my interest here lies in the bonus section again. In it, there is an MGM short with quality picture and deplorable audio called Sunday Night at the Trocadero. This 1937 film is basically a party hosted by former silent star Reginald Denny who was the subject of my article last month. He introduces famous and not so famous performers who only get a few seconds of screen time. Among the ones that are not credited, or even properly introduced by Denny are two dancers in the style of the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers duo.\n\nThey actually have the most screen time of anyone else in the film. Their dance is energetic and they look like they're having fun dancing together. The names of these unknown would be revealed in an unrelated 1938 Life magazine article. The man was Louis Hightower and his partner was Marjorie Belcher, performing under the name Margie Bell.\n\nThe names may not be familiar to you but these two happen to be the live action models that Disney animators used for the characters of Snow White and the Prince! Some color home movie footage of Marge Belcher's sessions survives and is available on the Snow WhiteBlu-ray. In it, you can see the animators giving instructions to the dancer while she was being filmed. If her movements seem familiar, that's because the still frames of the film were traced on paper (a technique called rotoscoping) and animators would adapt these movements to the design of the characters. Specifically, for instance, Snow White has a much bigger head than a regular human. Marge even had to wear a helmet so that the size of her head would match the intended drawing but the idea was soon dropped because it was so uncomfortable.\n\nAlthough the use of the technique was somewhat minimized in the Life article (where the two dancers were supposedly only an inspiration), their role in the making of the film is immense. Marge Belcher, the daughter of dance instructor Ernest Belcher, went on to model for the blue fairy for Pinocchio and married animator Art Babbitt. She later achieved worldwide fame when she remarried Gower Champion and they both became stars of a dancing duo in films.

Maybe this will throw a little light on its forgotten star.\n\nWhen BFI restored \"the Hitchcock 9\": Alfred Hitchcock's surviving silent films, I couldn't help but think that some of these films probably wouldn't have gotten this attention, had they not been directed by the master of suspense. Yet, at the time they were made, his involvement was definitely not the selling point of these films. The real stars were the ones you could see on-screen and no one outside the business knew who Mr. Hitchcock was.\n\nThe scenario of Champagne, which ended up being a light comedy, was developed from the pre-established title and could have been entirely different. Indeed, Hitchcock initially thought the story would be articulated the opposite way: a poor girl working in a champagne factory would sin her way to the top of the social ladder and then go back to her old job when she grew tired of it.\n\nIn the end, the film would tell the story of a rich heiress who would be taught a lesson by her rich daddy by cutting off her endless money supply. She learns the lesson, goes back to being rich and everyone is happy.\n\n1925 portrait\n\nSuch a seemingly tepid story could not be expected to be rendered more appealing by a then relatively new director (although the pressbook for the film boasts that he already has \"the reputation of being the premier British director\"), so a star was hired to ensure box office returns. Her name was Betty Balfour, who had just been christened \"Britain's favorite actress\" and is remembered today (if at all) only for this film.\n\nYet in the early twenties, Betty Balfour had become immensely popular in Great Britain thanks to her recurring role as Squibs, which began in the eponymous film. Her fame even crossed the Channel in 1922 when these films hit the French screens.\n\nShe started to work on stage at the age 18, in October 1914, at the Ambassadors in London thanks to producer C. B. Cochran who met her through the help of her admirer Lady Fitzmaurice. There she played a one act play called From Louvain. The next year, she appears in the show More.\n\nWhen C. B. Cochran takes the direction of the Palladium, he also takes her along. Betty stars in All Women, a revue that she tours around the country. Upon her return in London, she plays at the Palace Theater in June 1917.\n\nBetty in Nothing Else Matters\n\nAt the time, she was a victim of a German bomb and had to stay in bed for several months. But she went back to work in 1919, at the Alhambra, as Violet Manstone in the show Medorah. Her success in it triggered a two-year movie contract with Welsh Pearson and Company at the condition that she would disappear from the stage during that time. Her first screen role was that of a maid, Sally, in Nothing Else Matters, starring Moyna MacGill, Angela Lansbury's mother.\n\nThen came Mary Find The Gold opposite Hugh E. Wright.\n\nThe role that propelled her to stardom was the title role of Squibs where she played a London flower girl. A character that seemed to gain the sympathy of the audience. So much so that Betty was dubbed \"the English Mary Pickford\" and, after a film called Mord Em'ly and another called Wee MacGregor's Sweetheart (shot in Scotland), she went back to the role in Squibs wins the Calcutta Sweep.\n\nWee MacGregor's Sweetheart with Donald Macardle\n\nThe Calcutta Sweep was a lottery. Each ticket cost one pound and the number of winners was determined by the number of horses in the Epsom Derby. Each winner was assigned a horse and the winning horse determined who among the ticket holders won the highest sum (several thousand pounds). For instance, a 1921 winner was a Londoner who won £69,000.\n\nGeorge Pearson, Hugh Wright, Betty Balfour & Fred Grove on the set.\n\nSome of the exteriors for this film were even shot in Paris, on the Grands Boulevards and in Piccadilly Circus where Squibs learns that she won the lottery and kisses a surprised policeman in her excitement, a scene that was apparently shot among the unsuspecting crowd. Apparently Miss Balfour's boyfriend of the time played a policeman in the film.\n\nSquibs has just won the lottery!\n\nBefore the Calcutta Sweet movie even finished shooting, the contract was renewed for two additional years. With it came two sequels called Squibs M.P., and Squibs' Honeymoon (for which she became respectively producer and screenwriter), all directed by George Pearson. Even though the next films are not direct Squibs sequels, Betty Balfour was typecast in similar roles in films like in Love, Life and Laughter. In this very recently recovered film, one of her old vaudeville act was used. She eventually ended her collaboration with George Pearson and tried to change her image.\n\nLove, Life and Laughter\n\nHer fame outside of Great Britain permitted her to export her talents in Europe, so she starred in several films in France (she was fluent in French) and in Germany.\n\nThe film Bright Eyes [Champagner], directed by Geza von Bolvary, was even sometimes confused with Alfred Hitchcock's film just because it shared the same star and a similar title.\n\nPrince Aage of Denmark visiting the set of Alfred Hitchcock's Champagne\n\nIt is ironic that her best remembered film today is Champagne, one of the films she made in an attempt to move away from her usual roles of poor but optimistic characters and the one film that is most often overlooked in the articles about her in the 1920s.\n\nOne of the films she made abroad was Monte Carlo by French director Louis Mercanton. According to Mon Ciné magazine, this was the first production to actually be filmed inside the casino. The same director also worked with her in Croquette and La petite bonne du palace. Another famous Frenchman, Marcel L'Herbier directed her in Le diable au coeur. In Paradise, she wins a prize and decides to travel to the Riviera (the actress broke a rib during her energetic dance scene with Alexandre D'Arcy).\n\nCarlyle Blackwell, Jean-Louis Allibert & Betty Balfour in Monte Carlo\n\nBy 1927, she was making another international film called La fille du régiment from an Italian operetta with a German director and German actors, for a British company, opposite an Egyptian co-star. It was shot in Barcelona, London, Berlin, Paris...\n\nIn her interviews, she says she disliked talking pictures but had more faith in color.\n\nLove, Life and Laughter\n\nWhen the talkies came, however, she had to adapt. She starred in the first British musical, Raise the Roof, opposite Maurice Evans and in a second one called The Nipper. After which she vanished from the screen for 4 years.\n\nWhen she returned, she played second fiddle to singing star Jessie Matthews in Evergreen, one of the few films she made that is available on DVD today. She then attempted to revive her fame as Squibs in a 1935 musical remake of the film. While not a complete failure, the film was not the success Betty hoped and, after one last film, she stopped filming. She made one last attempt in films ten years later in a film opposite another Hitchcock regular Gordon Harker: 29 Acacia Avenue.\n\nAfter a return on the stage, she eventually retired and, were it not for Hitchcock's unpretentious comedy, she would be forgotten today. But maybe this newly rediscovered film will change that a little.\n\nDon't forget to click like on the Facebook page for more!\n\nThat's all for today folks!\n\n↧\n\nThe Three Masks, the first French talking picture.\n\nThe Jazz singer was presented in Paris on January 24, 1929, more than one year after its huge success in the USA. It took another 10 months for a French-speaking film to hit the screens (RCA sound-on-film system), presented at the Marivaux theater on October 31, 1929 and released to the audience the next day (there was even a release in Quebec).\n\n1929 The Three Masks\n\nThe choice of subject for the first talking picture in France may surprise some as it did me when I found out that the film was called The Three Masks. The film does not exactly enjoy the cult status that The Jazz Singer has in the USA (and indeed the world) where it was recently re-released in Blu-ray or Blackmail for Great Britain.\n\n1921 The Three Masks\n\nAs a matter of fact, the film was shot in London, at the BIP studio, the only place in Europe where you could make a talky at the time. The studio had unwisely been built right next to a railway track. So a man was hired solely to warn the crew of incoming trains thanks to an electric device which activated a light inside the studio everytime he pushed a button.Other foreign productions were shot there, like Atlantic, the first talkie inspired by the sinking of the Titanic. But a French sound studio was sound built in Joinville by Pathé and the short film Chiqué was shot there later that year.\n\n1921 Henry Krauss & Charlotte Barbier-Krauss\n\nAs for The Three Masks, the choice of subject becomes clearer when you realize that this film is, not only a stage adaptation (an easy solution adopted by many filmmakers during this difficult period), but more importantly a remake of a great 1921 success. That version was even re-released in 1924, a very rare instance during the silent era where most films were released only once, never to be seen again (one of the reasons why so many films are lost today).\n\n1929 Jean Toulout & Clotilde Person\n\nAs a matter of fact, in retrospect, the choice may seem bold, as the first film had a very limited number of intertitles and did not rely on dialog, unlike most subjects chosen for early talkies. One critic even wrote then that \"the text is reduced to a bare minimum, almost nothing\".\n\nHere is a short clip of the 1929 film:\n\n1921 The dead son under a mask\n\nIn Corsica, the rich Paolo della Corba loves the pretty Viola (Speranza in the silent version) in secret, because his father won't accept a poor daughter-in-law. Soon Viola gets pregnant and the couple decides to elope, but her three brothers decide to avenge her honor. During the carnival, wearing masks, they stab Paolo and bring him back in costume to his father who thinks the boy is just a drunk schoolteacher. When he removes the mask in the morning, the old man realizes his sorrow, and eventually cares for the baby.\n\n1929 The dead son under a mask\n\nThe first version, although it did not enjoy the novelty of sound yet,was immensely successful. The critics called it admirable. It was directed by then-famous Henry Krauss who also starred in the film. One of the masks was played by Georges Wague, a celebrated mime. This version offered what the hastily shot sound film could not offer in a London studio: realism. The director went to Corsica and looked for a mansion that could be used for the father. According to Ciné Pour Tous magazine from April 8, 1921, Corsica was a poor region with very little industry or commerce and such mansions were actually very rare there. The owners of the ones he could find did not want to let the crew inside for fear of alerting the police on the origin of their wealth.\n\n1921 \"Let us in\"\n\nHenry Krauss (1921)\n\nJean Toulout (1929)\n\nIn spite of that, Krauss shot beautiful scenes in Corto, Corgese, Piana, Bastia etc. He ended up in the Castle of Feliceto near Muro, between Calvi and Belgodere, owned by a Mr. Salvetti who welcomed him and the crew. Krauss waited until late in filming to tell the story to Mr. Salvetti, for fear of upsetting the man on the dramatic depiction of a vendetta among Corsicans. The man told him that a similar story had happened only three years earlier in a nearby village.\n\n1929 Renée Héribel (Viola) & François Rozet (Paolo)\n\nWhen it was re-released in 1924, Cinémagazine (July 18, 1924) acknowledged the (very rare) event and wished that the film be always available. Unfortunately, as of today, their wish is not granted and neither the original nor the sound remake is available on DVD or any other format. Yet these films are still extant: the 1921 masterpiece was projected in Corsica as late as 2009.\n\nDon't forget to click \"like\" on the Facebook page for more pictures, articles, & updates.\n\nThat's all for today folks!\n\n↧\n\nHow Pinocchio learned to speak French\n\nFebruary 1940. Pinocchio has just been released nationwide. That was the time to repeat an international success. I don't know if Disney had plans to repeat the process used two years before with Snow White: hiring French-speaking actors to make a French version in the studio, or hire local talents.\n\nThen the war came.\n\nOn the film's Blu-ray edition, if you switch the to French track, the main and end title is sung by an unidentified singer, not from any verion released in France until then. Yet the quality of the recording and the singing itself indicates that this is not a new version. No information has transpired and no other extract either from what may be a version recorded especially for Quebec. Maybe J.B. Kaufman's upcoming book will shed some light on this.\n\nAnyway, the planned June 14 Paris release was postponed until better days.\n\nWhen the war ended, the only Disney film available was Snow White (I plan to write an article about this release), but the studio has made and released several features in the USA. For a French release, these films needed a French adaptation, but also a proper distributor.\n\nNot until May 27, did RKO film SA really presented 7 features in Paris (among which Alfred Hitchcock's Suspicion), thereby marking their return on the French scene. However, Pinocchio was the first French version recorded after the war and it enabled them to present the film a little earlier.\n\nRKO trade ad (detail)\n\nAccording to press articles found by Sébastien Roffat, Georges van Parys, who had kept a copy of the film in English, started working on it with a moviola to decipher the music and write new sheet music for an adaptation. From October 1944, they started to record the voices, and by January 1945 according to an article of the time, the tracks had been sent to New York to be mixed to the music and effects track. Again, new visual elements with French writing would be filmed at the studio.\n\nAccording to Le film français, a corporate newspaper, this French version was presented as La merveilleuse aventure de Pinocchio [The Wonderful Adventure of Pinocchio] (even though the title card reads just \"Pinocchio\" and the film is known as such today), May 22, 1940 at the two theaters where it would be projected for an exclusive run simultaneously: at the Empire, and at The Rex.\n\nBetween July 19 and 25 and July 3 and 9, the film is announced in English for its fifth and eighth week.\n\nFinally, it went in general release on October 2, 1946.\n\nThe French track was praised by Disney himself and by the press of the time : \"The French version is pleasant and spoken by good voices.\" or \"The dubbing is of an exceptional quality\".\n\nIn this version, Jiminy is called \"Criquet\" whereas he will be called \"Grillon\" later and then \"Cricket\".\n\nWhen the film was re-released in 1975, the soundtrack was re-recorded with new actors. Since then, the old version was not used and was therefore never released on home video.\n\nThanks to my friend Rémi (blog Dans l'ombre des studios), François Justamand (La Gazette du doublage), Gilles and Christian, we have gathered extracts of it as well as three other \"lost\" versions of Disney Features. That enabled them to identify the voice actors presented here:\n\nOriginal French version (1946) :\n\nDubbing : RKO2\n\nArtistic direction : Daniel Gilbert 2\n\nMusical direction : Georges Tzipine ?3\n\nAdaptation : Jean Cis &Louis Sauvat 4\n\nPinocchio : Renée Dandry2\n\nJiminy Cricket : Camille Guérini2\n\nGeppetto : René Genin2\n\nFoulfellow : Jean Davy2\n\nStromboli : Fernand Rauzena3\n\nThe Blue Fairy : Simone Gerbier3\n\nLampwick : Linette Lemercier2\n\nTalking statue at the fair : Zappy Max2\n\nPoupée russe : Lita Recio3\n\nSinger (Main Title) : Jean Lumière2\n\n? : Marcel Raine2\n\n? : Jean Daurand2\n\nList made by Olivier Kosinski (Grands Classiques Disney), François Justamand (La Gazette du Doublage), Greg Philip (A Lost Film) & Rémi Carémel (Dans l’ombre des studios).

She was the iconic vamp of the silent era. Also she portrayed iconic characters such as Juliet (from Romeo & Juliet), Camille, Carmen, Madame Du Barry, Salome, all of them still popular and, at each new incarnation, her name is often brought up as a pioneer, even though few have actually seen her films since most of them are lost and those that are preserved are not necessarily the best ones and are usually presented in a very poor shape.\n\nAs a matter of fact, she played her most famous role in one of the most sought-after lost film: Cleopatra. Not often is a lost film so well illustrated to this day: tons of production photographs can be found on the internet or in various books. Joseph Mankiewick's version starring Elizabeth Taylor is actually a remake of this film, even though it was already lost by then.\n\nCleopatra\n\nSince the film (and most of her filmography) was released during WW1, her fame reached Europe a little late, probably one of the reason why her films were not as well preserved as later ones. Theda Bara is not often mentioned in French post war film magazines, for instance. The craving for more details in movie magazines will flourish a little later and magazines like Cinéa or Cinémagazine will only be published from 1921. And most of Theda Bara's films had been released in France by then.\n\nHowever, for this particular film, I found out that its first European premiere happened in Paris on January 30, 1920 at the Mogador Palace. For the occasion, a 40 piece orchestra played an especially written score by Paul Letombe. It took me a while to realize it since the film was not called Cléopâtre as one could expect. In the magazine \"Ciné pour tous\" and in every newspaper commenting the event (Le Petit Parisien, Le Figaro, etc.), the film is clearly advertized as La Reine des Césars [Queen of Caesars]. I can only guess what other titles were used throughout Europe. There is still hope to find a copy under some unexpected title after all!\n\nAnyway, the film seems to have been a big success there since by February 3, Le Matin displayed an ad saying that over 3,000 people could not get a seat so the management of the Mogador could not guaranty entrance to anyone without a reservation.\n\nOn April 2, the film move to the Demours theater and it took another month (May 3rd, 1920) to reach Algiers.\n\nSo far, only a fragment of the film has been recovered, and in very poor shape, too:\n\nAnother fragment was thought to be from this film for a time, but it happened to be from another Fox epic with a similar cast and crew called Queen of Sheba. As a matter of fact, this film was supposed to star Theda Bara before she left the studio and she was replaced by Betty Blythe who wore equally revealing costumes.\n\nHowever, Theda Bara cannot be summed up with Cleopatra alone. She wasn't the first to portrait the Queen, nor was she the first to play all of her famous roles. But she often was the first to play them in luxurious American feature films. At the time, movie studios kept their actors voluntarily anonymous so that they wouldn't demand higher salaries as they grew more famous. The few who reached fame had gained their way progressively as they had been eventually recognized film after film.\n\nUnlike them, Theda became an overnight sensation, the first manufactured star thanks to her association with William Fox, whose studio was nearly going bankrupt and needed a publicity stunt to change his luck.\n\nAs most film actors of the time, she started her career on the East coast, at Fort Lee. After a debut under her real name, Theodosia Goodman, as a fake nurse (actually a gangster's moll) in The Stain, she starred in A Fool There Was, and became The Vampire, a bad woman who lured married men to their doom. Amazingly, these films, directed by Frank Powell, are two of the six films (out of 40) that are still extant today (A Fool There Was is even available on DVD).\n\nThe term \"vamp\" was coined for her and she was typecast to cash in the extraordinary publicity around her persona. A whole legend was spread through newspapers and studio publicity about her origins (more specifically when Cleopatra was released, when her named was conveniently revealed to be an anagram for \"Arab Death\"). In 1917, the Goodman family legally changed their name to Bara.\n\nCarmen\n\nBack to 1915: she made a short film with Raoul Walsh called Siren of Hell and two features: the first was Carmen, an adaptation of Prosper Mérimé's novel. Cecil B. DeMille also released his version starring Geraldine Farrar on the same day.\n\nIn The Serpent, she played yet another vamp. With director Herbert Brenon, she did more films with such roles, and also adaptations of classics: The Two Orphans, Alexander Dumas'The Clemenceau Case and Kreutzer Sonata from Tolstoi. That same year, she also stars in an adaptation Emile Zola's Labor called Destruction, which will be released in France 5 years later as La ravageuse.\n\nWith The Galley Slave, she started a collaboration with the director that would work on most of her films: J. Gordon Edwards, grand father of director Blake Edwards.\n\nIn 1916, she did East Lynne (still extant) with director Bertram Bracken, and a steamy version of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet with Edwards (which had yet again to face a rival production from Metro). For him, she also became Esmeralda in a 1917 adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel Notre Dame de Paris called The Darling of Paris and Camille from Alexandre Dumas's novel La dame aux camélias.\n\nFrench poster for Madame Du Barry\n\nThen came Cleopatra, for which she was asked to move to California, where the new studios were operating, and Madame Du Barry, which were both released in France three years later. By then Pola Negri's later version had reached the French screen and another comparison in critics of the time was inevitable, like Carmen or Romeo And Juliet earlier.\n\nIn 1918, she co-wrote the story of The Son of Buddha. She also did Salome. That year, Theda even became the subject of a cartoon short starring Mutt and Jeff called Meeting Theda Bara!\n\nThe next year saw the release of 2 films by Charles Brabin, Kathleen Mavourneen and La Belle Russe. Her next film, The Lure of Ambition, was the last one she made for Fox before her contract expired. She was denied a raise and decided to leave the studio. After a trip to Europe, she tried to find work at another studio but was unsuccessful until 1925 when she made a comeback with The Unchastened Woman directed by James Young. This last feature film still exists today.\n\nHer last theatrical film was a comedy short called Madame Mystery co-directed by Stan Laurel in which she shared the screen with Oliver Hardy.\n\nAfter an attempt on the stage, she retired. She had married Charles Brabin in 1921 and the two stayed together until Theda's death in 1955.\n\nIn my research, I found other French titles for her films:\n\n- Un cavalier passa (A horseman went by, I don't know which film that is) was shown from November 7, 1919 at the Aubert Palace.\n\n- Le démon de la jalousie (Demon of Jealousy, a title that could fit too many of her movies), was released on January 1920 in Rouen and on May 23, 1920 in Algiers. (probably in Paris some time in 1919).\n\n- La DuBarry (Madame Du Barry, of course) released in Paris on February 6, 1920, just one week after Cleopatra.\n\n- La ravageuse (Ravenous, which is the French title of Destruction) came out on April 15, 1920.\n\n- La bête à misère (The Misery Beast) came out in Paris on July 30, 1920 and on March 3, 1921 in Algiers.\n\n- Poppéa (French title of When a Woman Sins) came out on September 24, 1920 in Algiers.\n\n- Salomé was released on January 14, 1921 and re-released on March 7, 1924. I even found a trace of the film as late as 1928 (January 25) in Madagascar.\n\n- Apparently, La Reine des Césars (Cleopatra) was reissued on January 21, 1921 in Algiers, a rare occurrence in those days.\n\n- Avant l'heure X (Before Time X, a war movie, possibly When Men Desire) was shown in Arcachon, France on February 18, 1922.\n\nIt is very difficult to associate a film with its title considering the French titles are usually completely different from the originals (Cleopatra being a good example). Also, the release dates are no help here considering that most of her films were made during World War I or right after, and were therefore almost all released in France in 1920 within a very short time bracket. Finally, no indication concerning the story, other actors or crew members are usually mentioned in the papers, cinema programs being mostly relegated to a mere column in the theater section of newspapers at the time.\n\nIf you wish to know more about this fascinating personality, I suggest you visit this website, and see the documentary The Woman With The Hungry Eyes.\n\nCheck out my Facebook page and click \"like\" for updates.\n\nThat's all for today folks!\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nThe Lost World\n\nArthur Conan Doyle's most famous work is the creation of detective Sherlock Holmes, and indeed the first screen adaptation came in 1900.\n\nHowever, one of the most successful adaptations of his novels was not a Sherlock Holmes film. The Lost World was a dinosaur story and nobody had figured out how to adapt such a fantastic tale until Willis H. O'Brien came along.\n\nThe man had developed a technique that enabled dinosaurs or other extinct beasts to take life in front of your eyes: stop motion animation. Basically, he would photograph puppets one frame at a time and would move them little by little so that the illusion of movement would be created when the film ran at normal speed. The same trick is used for cartoons, only this time, it was with three dimensional objects. And to the untrained eye of the spectators of the time, it might as well have been a real dinosaur up there on the screen.\n\nWillis had experimented that technique since 1915 with short films like Dinosaurs and the Missing Link or R.F.D., 10,000 B.C. where he animated puppets of humans as well so they could interact with the animals, much in the way of The Flinstones. (Check out the latter: I saw several instances where you can accidentally see Willis' elbow for a split millisecond). By 1918, he fleshed out his films with live action segments that provided a more substantial story and characters that the audience could relate to. This gave birth to the short film The Ghost of Slumber Mountain.\n\nUnfortunately, two thirds of the film are now lost and what you see here is an abridged version of a longer film.\n\nWith time, Willis progressed and he figured out that if he optically merged live action shots of people with his puppet shots, then the dinosaurs would seem even more realistic, as they would evolve in the real world. Recent research show that he first tried that with his partner Herbert Dawley in the film Along the Moonbeam Trail.\n\nIn 1923, a Buster Keaton comedy called Three Ages used stop motion animation in its prehistoric segment to create the illusion that the protagonist was using a giant dinosaur as transportation device. The way was paved for a prestige feature film to used this technique.\n\nFacade of the Paris Cameo theater showing the film\n\nThe idea came to adapt Arthur Conan Doyle's novel The Lost World, a perfect material for his specific trade. It took a whole year for him to animate the many dinosaur sequences (publicity for the film said \"seven years in the making\"). To create a surefire success, real live wild beasts were photographed, and movie stars were hired. The star of Three Ages, Wallace Beery, took the part of Professor Challenger, Bessie Love was Paula White, Lewis Stone became Sir John Roxton and teen heartthrob Loyd Hughes played adventurer Ed Malone. Even Arthur Conan Doyle makes an appearance in the prologue.\n\nAlthough not a secret (some articles of the time make wild guesses), the fact that the animals were animated was, at the time, not explained in the film publicity which preferred to describe the film as if cretaceous species had somehow magically reappeared.\n\nThe Lost World was a massive hit throughout the world for several years. It even became the first in-flight film as this French article proves (an experiment that will not be repeated much, the journalist suggests, considering how flammable film is). The deed took place in London in late 1925 and, according to the imdb, was repeated in Germany on February 4, 1926.\n\nHowever, as most silent films, it was only sporadically re-released and in various edits. For many years, only severely shortened copies of lesser quality circulated. This site gives a complete explanation of this.\n\nLobster films eventually restored the film to a more acceptable length and quality, but unfortunately, portions of it are still missing. The film is also coming out on Blu-ray in France in October as a bonus feature of its 1960 sequel.\n\nFrench magazine ad\n\nThe plot of the film inspired countless others: the remote island, the romance amidst catastrophe, the giant beast turn loose in the big city, the iconic monument destroyed are all still used today. Willis O'Brien's next big finished project will be animating his most famous work: King Kong.\n\nPlease, click like on the Facebook page of the blog to received updates.\n\nThat's all for today folks!\n\n↧\n\nSnow White in France. Chapter 1 : 1938 -1943\n\nIf the fairest one of all stays eternally young, it is no secret anymore that she was born a long time ago. The date commonly given is that of the premiere at the Carthay Circle Theater on December 21, 1937. But the film did not go into general release until at least February of 1938 !\n\nThe French press mentions the film as early as 1935, when Walt Disney came to visit Paris. There are more and more articles by the end of 1937. In February of 1938, Ciné-France publishes one about Snow White patterns to make dresses. On March 11, 1938, the same magazine says that the French version is being recorded at the Disney studios (chanteuse Lily Pons's name is mentioned erroneously for the lead). It also says that band leader Ray Ventura is already recording his versions of the film's melodies.\n\nOther records were cut in the USA and in England prior to that, and some were commercialized in France. On February 21, Frank Luther, with the help of Zora Layman, records a wacky version (in English) of the story on three discs. On March 25, Anne Lenner sings two songs accompanied by Carroll Gibbons and the Savoy Hotel Orpheans: \"One Song\" and \"With a Smile And A Song\". That same month, the US original soundtrack was released in Great Britain on three discs and, despite the language barrier, also in France. Still in March, Guy Lombardo and wife Carmen recorded two songs: \"With A Smile And A Song\" et \"Whistle While You Work\".\n\nOn April 9, Joe Loss and his orchestra offers a selection of the film's songs.\n\nIn May, Georges Briez does \"Un sourire en chantant\" (With a Smile And A Song\") and a medley of \"La tyrolienne des nains\" (The Silly Song\") and \"Heigh Ho\".\n\nLe Populaire from April 22, 1938 announces the competitor's project : Max Fleischer prepares his own feature but the subject has not been revealed yet. It should be ready for the 1938/1939 season.\n\nTo conquer Europe, the film naturally started by Great Britain, where no adaptation was needed. But once finalized, the French version enabled Disney to present his first feature magnificently in Paris, on the Champs-Élysées, in only one theater, whose facade was entirely decorated for the occasion: the Marignan theater, in which Snow White replaced La tragédie impériale, a film by Marcel L'Herbier, starring Harry Baur.\n\nThe Marignan theater in 1938\n\nThe Marignan theater in 2013\n\nThe event happened on Friday May 6, 1938, and was heavily publicized in many newspapers (except in the communist paper L'Humanité which only changes the film program of the Marignan on May 11) and several personalities were invited at the gala premiere: actor Noël-Noël, opera singer Lily Pons (who, according to the press, was considered for the lead role), actress Renée St Cyr, director Robert Siodmak, etc.. Les petits chanteurs à la croix de bois (The little singers of Paris), presented by Father Munier, start the show, and \"precious souvenirs\" are handed. Seats for the evening retailed at 30, 40, 75 and even 100 francs! Guests had to be smartly dressed.\n\nFor this original release, several posters were used: one with the American design (see above), but French designer Bernard Lancy also designed several others, which were even used abroad.\n\nLe programme du Marignan announces many tie-in products. Among them, other than imported British and American records, are those of Ray Ventura (Siffler en travaillant& Un sourire en chantant) and the two first songs by Lucienne Dugard, recorded in May, in time for the release: Un sourire en chantant & Un jour mon Prince viendra. These recordings are the first to use alternate lyrics, not those of the film (and that are found on the Salabert songbook that was published then). The same phenomenon can be found in the USA: there alternate lyrics for commercial recordings also, something which endures today for almost every new recording. This particular disc will lead many to believe that Lucienne Dugard was among the cast of the French dub of the film,in spite of the fact that her voice is completely different from Snow White's.\n\nIrène Hilda in 1938\n\nAs a matter of fact, while Disney remained very secretive about the cast list, the press will speculate more than once about the star. I guess the actresses in these articles were probably mentioned for publicity, or simply because of the journalist's ignorance. Indeed, in its letters to the editor column, Pour Vous informs its readers on June 29, 1938 that \"the actress who speaks for Snow White is called Irène Hilda\". Olivier Kosinski brought to my attention the fact that A. de Montgon published an article in Le Petit Bleu on May 24, 1938 where he\"reveals\" that it is the Belgian actress and singer Sim Viva who gave her voice to Snow White in the French version. Yet, in a few paragraphs (July 20, 1938 in Pour Vous or July 7, 1938 in Cinémonde) the name of the actual actress who played the part can be found: director Jacques Tourneur's wife, Christiane Tourneur.\n\nRené Lehmann, in L'Intransigeant on May 7, 1938 (published the day before) gives his vision of the French version: \"I must say the French voices given to these legendary little characters are often plagued with Germanic or Anglo-Saxon accents that shocked me.\" This is mostly due to the fact that the French version had been recorded in the USA by expatriates. Gilbert Bernard, of Le Matin, who praises the film, also notes the same problem: \"The only critic I can make - regretfully so - is about the quality of the French voices ; which would have been better if the adaptation had been done in Paris instead of Hollywood.\"Walt Disney heard the critics and in Le Matin of May 15, 1938 one could read a press release in his name to glorify his efforts: \"My most sincere wishes of success for the French version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. I hope this production will help maintain and reinforce the friendship that always existed betwen the people of France and the U.S.A.\" That same day, the Marignan had seen thousands of spectators in a week and Le Journal de Mickey started the weekly publication of the comic adaptation of the film in color.\n\nThe Marignan\n\nThe movie thus settled at le Marignan as a permanent show from 1.30pm until 1.30am! In spite of that, the lines kept getting longer and these showings were not enough. On June 4, 1938, Le Matin announced that \"because of incalculable demands from children and parents, two special showings of Snow White will be programed for Pentecost. Walt Disney's film will play at 10am On Sunday 5 and Monday 6 and the seats for these extraordinary events will exceptionally sell at 12, 16, 18 and 20 francs.\"\n\nRKO trade ad\n\nDanielle Darrieux in 1938\n\nA contest was organized, described in the June 10 edition of Le Matin : \"Contestants were supposed to designate the famous actors who they thought were best qualified to play the fictitious characters of Walt Disney's beautiful film. Milton was chosen for Happy, to Fernandel went the part of Bashful, Dopey would be Noël-Noël, Sneezy always with a cold would be played by Lucien Baroux, for Grumpy, Raimu was proposed. Michel Simon has to be satisfied with Sleepy and Armand Bernard becomes Doc. Finally Danielle Darrieux has been chosen for the nice Snow White.\"\n\nThe Marignan\n\nOn June 14, Le Matin tells of the incredible success of the film for the past six weeks and warns its readers that the exclusivity of the Marignan will only end in seven months and that, before this, \"the film will not play in any neighborhood theater in Paris\". That same day, Fred Adison and his orchestra record La tyrolienne des nains, again with \"commercial records\" lyrics, different from that of the film.\n\nOn June 21, 1938, it is Elyane Célis, with Marcel Cariven's orchestra, who records her version of Un sourire en chantant and Un jour mon Prince viendra. That version will also be quite popular and adds a new potential player to the supposed list of actresses who played Snow White (that isn't the case: for a complete list of actors who played in the French version of the film, please read this article). In June also, Albert Valensi aka \"Valsien\" also releases a medley of the film's tunes with the great orchestra of the Odéon and Odette Moulin releases a Pathé record of \"Sifflez en travaillant\" and \"Un sourire en chantant\" with the Fredo Gardoni orchestra.\n\nOther products were made, as never before: handkerchiefs, puzzle games, card games, jewelry, and 25 postcards edited by E. Séphériadès. This series manages to tell the story of the Princesse while retaining only the dwarfs and the Prince, even adding scenes (like the one below) to cover for the absence of the Queen, the hunter, etc.\n\nPostcard 19\n\nIn Le Matin, Grumpy complains in a fictitious July 10 interview that he had to learn seven languages to allow a release abroad. He mentions the title translations (all wrong, just like one could find in the Carthay Circle Theater program) and says he had trouble with Arabic \"that isn't a language, [but] an explosion\".\n\nBut it was worth it. On July 15, the newspaper claims \"Blanche Neige breaks all records\", and says that the film \"during its nine first weeks of exclusivity, grossed a total sum of 3,600,000 francs, or a weekly sum of 400,000 francs!\"\n\nHall of the Marignan\n\nOn September 3, 1938, Le Temps announces that the film won a special prize at the Venice festival. In the meantime, Yvonne Marsay and André Pierrel release their musical fantasy played by the Fernand Warms orchestra. In the USA, the soundtrack's release sold very well. So with a cover very similar to the British release, in September two records came out in France where the story of Snow White was recorded with Marcel Cariven's orchestra and sung by Elyane Célis. In this recording only, the songs kept the film's original lyrics.\n\nThe Marignan's exclusive engagement ended after 18 weeks when the film moved to l'Impérial for another exclusive 17 weeks from September 9, 1938, and from December 9, le film came out simultaneously in several theaters in Paris in time from Christmas. Meanwhile, it had already traveled through France to become the country's most phenomenal success.\n\nHowever, even outside of Paris, exclusive engagements were negotiated: so on November 13, 1938 at the Excelsior in Rennes, Snow White plays for the first time in the region at 13H30, 16H30 and 20H45. An article in Ouest éclair says that \"the ticket office was overcrowded\". For once, the article warns that \"No one can forget Snow White's voice\" and calls the film \"a complete success as each of the arts know very few.\" Publicity boasts that the film will not play elsewhere in the district for a year and in the town for 2 years!\n\nOn November 17, the same paper says that \"all records of the film Snow White can be purchased at the maison Racine, 6 Lafayette street.\" and announces the broadcast of a\"selectiion of tunes of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, a film by Disney and Churchill.\" on radio Toulouse at 10.30pm (!)\n\nAnd earlier, on September 23, 1938, because of the success of the first record, Lucienne Dugard recorded another with the songs \"Je souhaite - Un chant\" (with the film's lyrics only slightly adapted) & \"Siffler en travaillant\". Fred Adison, too, records a new title on November 21: Heigh-Ho.\n\nKeep in mind that, at the time, France is not limited to its European territories. Snow White is also released in the many colonies. On October 31, 1938, the film reaches the Régent in Algiers and on November 9, the press says that the wildest hopes of the theater manager were fulfilled: \"a lady who had seen the film in Paris came from Constantine to Algiers only to see it again.\" It came back in June 1940 in the same theater although it had never really left the screen in this town. Snow White is visible there with almost no interruption until February of 1943!\n\nIt is also presented in Indochina, at the Majestic of Hanoi which for the occasion, prints a luxurious program with the story of the film among colored illustrations.\n\nOn November 1, Le Temps announces that the film could be the first American movie to be played in U.S.S.R. since Modern Times.\n\nSnow White continues its career in Paris: on December 11, 1938, it plays at the Lutétia, the Eldorado and at the Victor Hugo. Books are also announced: \"Published by Hachette (...) in the series Hop-là with wonderful fold out pages, the prettiest chapter of Snow White, Snow White and her animal friends.\"\n\nAs a matter of fact, at Christmas, the film is still her to stay: on December 23, 1938, as it is freezing out (10°F in Paris) 7 theaters in Paris still play it.\n\nOn Christmas day, Le Temps announces a 9.30pm radio adaptation of Snow White on radio Droitwich. The show is played again the next day.\n\nOn december 26, 1938, the films is announced at the Casino in St Malo and at the Foyer in Combourg \"which obtained the region's exclusivity for 10 month.\n\nOn January 10, 1939, the movie still plays in Paris at the Bonaparte and the Caméo.\n\nIn Fougères, on February 1, 1939, Ouest éclair praises M. Véiès' initiative who organized special showings for school children the day beforeand on that day too. In Dinard, the film is shown on February 2 and 4 at the Ciné Palace. Around this time too, the first advertisements for a collection of stickers found in the Menier chocolate bars to glue in the two Snow White albums\n\nAnd from March 2, Ouest éclair publishes a part of the comic adaptation in its Thursday pages until July 13, 1939.\n\nIn front of this lasting triumph, and to bring a response to the critics, on February17, 1939, as the film is still touring the country, a new exclusivity is announced, this time at the Normandie, a Pathé theater on the Champs-Élysées: the film in English! Showings start at 9.15pm.\n\nThis, however, doesn't last, an from March 8, Snow White has been replaced by La vie est magnifique, at the Normandie. But the public slowly took possession of the characters and the Noëlistes at St Vincent High School presented their version of the tale on February 5,1939 at 2.30 pm. Other stage adaptations will follow, on March 28, 1939, a version by Mme Jeanne Blanc is mentioned: \"Blanche Neige et le Prince charmant\"part of a show by Fernand Rouvray. That same day, the coming of a new feature called Pinocchio is announced, as well as the creation of a new Disney character: Goofy. On June 13, 1939, at the Luxembourg parc, a Snow White puppet show is played and Simone Debergé's adaptation is played on Saturday June 24, 1939 in Fougères starring Noëlla Debergé, actually a follow-up of the film.\n\nBut from March 29, 1939, the Lutétia programs two versions of the film every day. The matinée is Blanche Neige and the evening show is Snow White.\"\n\nMardi Gras offers a new occasion to publicize the film: in fact, Ouest France tells on March 20, 1939 of the carnival in Rennes with a Snow White float, and the character is even recieved at Town Hall and congratulated by the deputy mayor.\n\nOn April 8, 1939, the French version is released... in New York! At the Waldorf Theater, even French francs are accepted.\n\nOn May 5, 1939, almost a year after the release of the film, famous singer Jean Lumière also collaborates with Marcel Cariven to record his version of Un chant (One Song).\n\nOn June 12, 1939 there are advertisements in Ouest éclair for Cadum soaps who offer as a gift one of the eight color lithographies of Snow White in each box of three soaps. Each one represents a dwarf, except the eighth one which is, of course Snow White and her Prince. They met with great success and a new series with others scenes were produced.\n\nImage Cadum belge\n\nBut on September 1, 1939 comes the war and Pinocchio's release is canceled. Yet, copies of Snow White apparently were still in circulation in France for years after that. Snow White is played on March 22, 1940 in Servan, and on June 2, 1940 at the Select in Rennes.\n\nA new film from the studio was even released in March and April of 1940: La grande parade de Walt Disney, a kind of Festival of Hits which will be released later in the USA but with a rather different program: if Ferdinand the Bull is indeed part of the show, the rest is composed of other shorts: Brave Little Tailor, The Practical Pig, Donald's Golf Game, Ugly Duckling, and Farmyard Symphony.\n\nLe Midi Libre of September 9, 1942 announces the last showings of Snow White downtown Toulouse at the Nouveautés (7 francs a seat) non stop from 2 to 6 with a special 9 o'clock showing because \"this film will be forbidden in France from October 15.\"\n\nIt is indeed then that, in the free zone, that all American and British films were banned. If it hadn't been for that measure, it is likely that the little Princess' career would have gone on.\n\nDon't forget to click like on the Facebook page if you like this and would like to know the rest!\n\nThat's all for today folks!\n\n↧\n\nSnow White in France. Chapter 2: 1944 -1951\n\nAs Paris has just been liberated, and before the war is even over, life goes on in the French Capital City. But French films are soon insufficient: one can read in Le Film Français that there are 220 French films made during the war and 60 more that are about to be available, but production will stop completely. 40 new American films are ready to invade the market, and there are those from before the war that can still be shown.\n\nSo the America production, which had left the screen during the occupation, is coming back strongly.\n\nFrom October 1944, Hitchcock's comedy M. et Mme Smith (Mr. and Mrs. Smith) comes out.\n\nIn December 1944, \"Furie\" is played starring Spencer Tracy, Fra Diavolo with Laurel and Hardy, Ma femme est une sorcière (I Married a Witch) with Veronica Lake, and for feature cartoon amateurs, the Paramount theater offers Max and Dave Fleischer's Gulliver's Travels dubbed in French, with much publicity since December 20.\n\nDisney is still present though: the cartoon package film La grande parade de Walt Disney is projected (listed since December 28 in Le Figaro) at the Cinéph. Champs Elysées, where it is enjoying a successful re-release (the first release being in 1940). On December 28, Le Figaro announces that on Thursday January 4, the French association of Cinema, for its opening night at the studio de l'étoile, will show a festival of cartoons.\n\nMovie program in the Figaro of December 30, 1944\n\nThis interest for animated films and the movies in general will be satisfied with new American releases, sometimes not yet dubbed but also by old successes which copies were kept hidden during the war and allowed limited screenings. The list of films seen in Paris still varies somewhat erraticly and the systematic weekly release that was the norm before the war is still not quite adopted.\n\nOn Saturday December 30, 1944, L'Humanité and Le Figaro both announce that Le Normandie, on the Champs-Élysées has replaced the film Florence est folle,a comedy by Georges Lacombe with Annie Ducaux, by Blanche Neige et les sept nains. On the ads, on-stage attractions are announced, as well as the \"great orchestra of the Normandie\".\n\nLe Normandie 1945\n\nThis picture, taken on January 15, 1945 by an American war correspondent, Sherman Montrose, shows the facade, decorated for the occasion and the line of people waiting. Other than the obvious attraction, it seems that movie theaters then were a good and cheap shelter from the cold when many could not afford to warm their own homes\n\nThe poster retains the design of Gustaf Tenggren once again but the dwarfs are closer in aspect to what they look like in the film. Apart from that, it would seem that no other poster was designed for that release. It is very likely that, in this period of restrictions and for a limited showing, the promotional material designed before the war was re-used.\n\nLe Normandie 2014\n\nAs a matter of fact, you can catch a glimpse of the lobby with a poster that is present in the initial release pressbook. Next to it are several pictures displayed to give an idea of what the film was about to awaiting spectators. At least two of them are recognizable: there are the images I copied below.\n\nUntil I find proof of the contrary, it seems that this release was limited to that one theater. Yet at the time, the Hachette story book is published again and the 1938 E. Séphériadès postcards are also republished by Superluxe.\n\nFrom December 1945 to February 1946, the French cinémathèque organizes an exhibit on animated cartoons and the poster cannot hide who the master of the genre is: Oswald, Pluto, Donald Duck and of course Mickey Mouse are clearly displayed. I doubt that such an event would have taken place if it hadn't been for Snow White.\n\n6 years after this Paris release, the French version of the film reappears in Brussels at the Eldorado on August 10, 1951, where it stays from 1 to 9pm until August 30, 1951.\n\nThe very next day, on August 31, 1951, the film comes back, thanks to RKO in two theaters in Paris: at Gaumont Palace (Place Clichy, 4,600 seats, the place is gone now) and at the Berlitz (31 boulevard des italiens, 1,500 seats, also gone) and the success is once again astounding.\n\nFor its first exclusive week, the films makes 8,306,418 francs at the Gaumont Palace with 43,302 tickets sold and 3,434,540 francs at the Berlitz with 14,832 tickets.\n\nThe second week, it brings 5,711,692 francs at the Gaumont Palace (29,297 tickets) and 2,347,390 francs at the Berlitz (9,946 tickets), which brings it to the top of the biggest money makers in Paris in front of On The Town and September Affair.\n\nInside the Gaumont Palace in 1945\n\nOn the third week, with 28 showings in each theater, 14,382 tickets are sold in the Berlitz for 3,434,540 francs (each seat is sold between 200 and 300 francs) and 43,302 tickets earn the Gaumont Palace 8,306,418 francs (180 to 250 francs a seat).\n\nIt is at the Gaumont Palace that Cinderella premiered last Christmas and a giant ad already announces Alice in Wonderland for the coming holidays.\n\nThe poster is a copy of Bernard Lancy's original one with a different font on the title and one of the two RKO logos is replaced by \"Technicolor\".\n\nOn September 19, Blanche Neige starts a second exclusive showing in a different theater (4 weeks until October 14) at the Lord Byron (462 seats) located at number 122 on the Champs Elysees, a place now gone too. It grosses 2,125,500 francs that week with 8610 tickets sold; on the second, 2,162,500 francs with 8650 tickets; the third week 1,190,000 (4,760 tickets); and the fourth and last 1,147,500 (4,590 tickets). At this point, Snow White already conquered the land thanks to a national release.\n\nIn Lille, the film came out on September 5, in two theaters : the Bellevue, where 7,354 tickets sold and grossed 822,200 francs, and at the Caméo which sold 7,962 tickets for 887,085 francs.\n\nAlso on September 5, Nice sees the film opening in 3 theaters : the Excelsior which sold 4,682 tickets in a week for 552,382 francs, the Politéama (4,876 tickets for 579,850 francs) and the Royal (4,687 tickets for 556,200 francs).\n\nOn September 11, the film comes out in Toulouse, at the Trianon Palace where it grosses 2,270,434 francs with 17,460 tickets for the first week only, and 2,278,334 francs for the second one.\n\nIn Marseille, the film is shown for a week only in two theaters : the Capitole with 2,254,670 francs (16,607 tickets) and the Rialto with 1,731,375 francs (12,925 tickets).\n\nOn September 19, the Pathé and the Olympia in Nancy both play the film with grosses of respectively 1,501,570 francs (11,462 tickets) and 678,515 francs (6,558 tickets) during the one week of exclusivity.\n\nOn September 24, Blanche Neige comes out in Strasbourg and the October 12, 1951 issue of Le film français triumphantly announces the 3,530,140 franc grosses made in 12 days (27,851 tickets) at the Vox of Strasbourg, which sets a new record for this theater.\n\nOn September 26, the film arrives at the Ciné Journal of Lyon which sells 15,214 tickets in a week for 1,942,650 francs, 10,402 tickets the second week for 1,344,950 francs, and 8,293 tickets the third and last week.\n\nIn Bordeaux, at the Français, the grosses for the first week are 2,587,300 francs. The Sogec company which owns the theater, organized a drawing contest for kids under 15 who are supposed to draw a scene or a character from the film. The hundreds of drawing sent are exposed in the lobby of the theater. Participants all get to see the film for free and the ten best drawings get a special prize. First prize is a brand new bike.\n\nTo coincide with the release, the Hachette storybook is reissued as well as the sheet music. A new book comes out by Hachette in the collection \"Pink albums\" with new illustrations which will be used again in other books and records. Other titles will follow in this same collection such as: La maison des nains (The dwarfs' cottage) in 1953, Le couronnement de Blanche Neige (Snow White's crowning) in 1955, Le retour de Blanche Neige (The return of Snow White) in 1956 and Il était une fois (Once upon a Time) in 1959 which is actually a reissue La maison des nains followed by Noah's ark.\n\nAlthough inspired by the success of the 1939 Menier albums, a new 60 franc album is issued: in the \"éclair\" collection (éditions populaires modernes, 39 rue Paul Barruel, Paris XV) where one is supposed to glue \"a wonderful collection of 240 multicolored images\". This same album is also issued in Italy at about the same time with the same images inspired by the film but with adaptations that differ almost only in the translation.\n\nIn the following years, several types of products will fill the void when the film is not showing anywhere.\n\nIn 1953 a new Hachette picture book (collection Grands albums) where for the first time appear drawings, typical of the fifties, later used numerous times where the Queen has a red dress and where polka dots appear and disappear from Snow White's skirt from one drawing to another. The mother of Snow White is also represented as well as baby Snow White in a cradle.\n\nIn 1954, singer Paulette Rollin, who was then a sort of official voice for Disney because she voice the title character in Cinderella released three years earlier, proposed an album of Disney songs by Mercury records. She had already recorded in 1947 a selection of songs of Bambi (even when the film was released with songs in English in the French version), then songs of Cinderella. In this new album, she sang some of her non Disney songs, but also those of Alice in Wonderland, Cinderella, The Three Little Pigs, and Snow White: Heigh-Ho, Un jour mon prince viendra, Sifflez en travaillant and Un chant. The orchestra is conducted by her husband: Hubert Rostaing.\n\nIn 1955, the popular story of Blanche Neige recorded by Élyane Célis is reissued. The recording is exactly the same as the two 1938 78 rpm records but it is now on the two sides of a single 45 rpm record.\n\nRecording equipments having evolved, Lucien Adès, who has already flooded the market with other Disney features, has a new version of the story recorded, this time with more actors for better characterization. The narrator is François Périer who will later take that same role in one of the French dubs of Fantasia. The Princess is played by Lucienne Pacley. Director/actor Roger Coggio plays the Prince at a time when he is starting a long career in the movies and the theater. Ariane Murator (or Muratore) plays the Queen and the Witch. Jacques Provins, Yonal and Joé Noël share the parts of the dwarfs. Jany Sylvaire sings for Snow White and Aimé Doniat for the Prince. For the first time, a booklet with images and text comes with this record.\n\nOne of the drawings of this album will be used that same year to illustrate the cover of a record of songs from the film by singer Christiane Legrand, accompanied on some titles by Jean Cussac. These songs will be used many times on subsequent records and will even appear in 1963 (without crediting the singers) on an American record \"Snow White in French and English\" which alternates American songs by Tutti Camarata and French versions by Christiane Legrand.\n\nStill in 1955 (a prolific year for Blanche Neige given the fact that the film was not released in France then), the same drawing is used a s a cover of a book \"in 3 dimensions\" (actually a pop-up book).\n\nThe French version of the film comes out in Russia with Russian subtitles in July 1955 in theaters and even on TV! Snow White will apparently be dubbed in Russian only much later for its DVD release. It is in fact a Russian 35mm copy of the first French dubbing that is now held in the French film archives of Bois D'Arcy.\n\nIn 1958, Paulette Rollin strikes again at Barclay records with a mini album of Snow White songs. This time, the album is solely of Snow White and despite the fact that the titles are similar to the previous record, the recordings are different and the orchestra here is conducted by Mario Bua. On the cover are the rubber figurines that were displayed in the original 1937 American trailer (with a few changes).\n\nMeanwhile, the films comes out again in the US, and for the first time, it is not released by RKO anymore, as the company ceased most activities the previous year. For that reason, the main title is shot again with different credits: the emphasis on the fact that it is a feature film is toned down, the film now opens by a simple \"Walt Disney presents\" and the RKO credit is erased from the third frame. In order to achieve that, a new background, inspired by the original, has to be designed as, according to the studio, the first one has been misplaced. A new background is now available to adapt the main title of the film in an infinity of foreign versions. This is a perfect occasion to create whole new versions of Snow White throughout the world where it is scheduled to be re-released soon...\n\nDon't forget to hit \"like\" on the Facebook page for more.\n\nThat's all for today folks!\n\n↧\n\nSnow White in France. Chapter 3: 1962.\n\nAs Snow White has been released in the USA in 1958 through Buena Vista, the studio prepares an international Christmas 1962 release. Since new American credits had to be created to erase the name RKO which use to distribute the film, new foreign titles are created for the same purpose.\n\nBut Snow White must remain the fairest one of all. And Walt Disney has never been very fond of the foreign versions of his first features. For some of them, some of the songs weren't even translated (Bambi, Dumbo) in France and in the case of Snow White, not only the chorus was international (and sung wordless songs), but the recording quality had never satisfied him. As a matter of fact, most of the critics of the initial release were about the French version, the quality of the translation and the accents of the actors in it.\n\nThe solution appears obvious: re-dub the film with a new translation. Louis Sauvat is entrusted with the adaptation. The recording is done at S. P. S., Société Parisienne de Sonorisation, 8 rue Leredde, Paris 13.\n\nLucie Dolène in 1956\n\nFor the part of Snow White, just like the first version, separate people are tested for the speaking and singing voice. Lucie Dolène, then 31, has done that before. Other than her radio appearances (with Pierre Cour), her experience on the stage with operettas (\"Le chevalier du ciel\" with Luis Mariano) and on TV where she is often invited in the show \"36 chandelles\" by Jean Nohain (with her husband who composed Edith Piaf's \"Mon manège à moi\": Jean Constantin), she was Debbie Reynolds' singing voice in the French version of Singin' In The Rain and she also dubbed Dany Robin's singing in the film Frou Frou. She actually regrets that her work was kept a secret even though she was promised screen credit.\n\nBut once chosen to sing Snow White's songs, she overhears executives saying they still need an actress. She then offers to test for dialogs and gets the part. She remains, to this day, the only French artist to sing and talk for the Princess, as both other versions use two different persons. She will sing several times in other Disney productions like The Jungle Book or Beauty And The Beast.\n\nJean Cussac\n\nLikewise, the Prince's voice is 40 year old Jean Cussac's both in the singing and talking. He had already sung the part of the Prince on the 1955 record of Christiane Legrand, which is why everyone in the studio was surprised when he offered to sing in the dwarfs' chorus. He changed his voice accordingly and nobody in the audience realized the trick. He worked many times for Disney as a singer or as a musical director.\n\nClaude Gensac en 1962\n\nThe 35 year old actress who voices the Queen had started her screen career almost 10 years earlier as Michel Simon's maid in the film The Virtuous Scoundrel [La vie d'un honnête homme] where her salacious boss imagines her topless, serving tea. Claude Gensac shared the screen with Louis de Funès who also played a servant. She became famous in France as the wife of the latter in many films, like the series of Troops movies, or Oscar, Jo, etc. She brings a very aristocratic interpretation, icier than previous actresses in the part of the Queen.\n\nMarie Francey in 1961\n\nSince her voice sounds too young for the second part of the film, 63 year old Marie Francey becomes the voice of the hag. She also was Peg's voice in the French version of Lady And The Tramp and is among the pioneers of dubbing. She was the voice of Bette Davis, Madeleine Carroll, Marlene Dietrich, Gloria Swanson, Thelma Ritter, etc.\n\nRichard Francoeur\n\nRichard Francoeur (or Frankeur), a 68 year old actor then has dubbed many movies too: his chameleon voice enabled him to be the voice of many different actors: refined George Sanders, adventurer Clark Gable or seductive Gary Cooper. Here he becomes Prof (Doc). He also dubbed actor Billy Gilbert, Sneezy's American voice, in the 1942 film: Arabian Nights, as well as Moroni Olsen, the American voice of the magic mirror, in 1944 for Buffalo Bill. Better still, in the 1954 movie, The Far Country, he dubs the actor Eugene Borden, the very one who voiced... Doc in first French version of Snow White! He also voiced Uncle Edgar (Ed Wynn) in Mary Poppins.\n\nRaymond Rognoni\n\nRaymond Rognoni, 70 years old at the time of the dubbing, holds the part of Joyeux (Happy). It isn't his first Disney experience: he is Peter Lorre's voice in 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea (where Richard Francoeur dubs Paul Lukas), and King Hubert in Sleeping Beauty. Part of the Comédie Française and Chevalier of the légion d'honneur since 1932 for his actions in the favor of child actors for whom he opened a school in Paris where his bust still stands. At the comedy contest of the conservatory, Robert de Fleerswrote about him on July 10, 1922 that he was \"a big ball of sincerity and happiness.\" Could there be a better Happy?\n\nJean Daurand\n\nAtchoum (Sneezy) is probably among the most familiar faces for a 1962 audience. In fact, Jean Daurand, 49 at the time of Snow White, is invited almost monthly on their TV screen since 1958 in the part of inspector Dupuy in the famous police series The Last 5 Minutes [\"Les 5 dernières minutes\"], a part that he will let go only in 1973. This series had started live and you could catch a glimpse of the actors changing clothes and running to assume their positions between scenes. The last episodes was broadcast in 1996! That's how popular it was!\n\nLéonce Corne\n\n68 years old in 1962, Léonce Corne is a familiar face and a familiar voice on the small and the big screen. That same year, he plays with Jean Gabin in The Gentleman From Epsom [Le Gentleman d'Epsom], but his figure appears in many French classics like We Are All Murderers [Nous sommes tous des assassins] by André Cayatte, Daybreak [Le jour se lève] by Marcel Carné, Father Goriot [Le père Goriot] by Robert Vernay, The Woman Who Dared [Le ciel est à vous] de Jean Grémillon, ou The Mystery of The Yellow Room [Le mystère de la chambre jaune] by Henri Aisner. In the dubbing department, he is Groucho Marx's French voice and did many parts in films by Billy Wilder, Alfred Hitchcock, etc.\n\nGeorges Hubert, 56 years old in 1962, is about to record his most famous role: he will be Q's French voice in the James Bond series. He also dubbed many parts in famous productions: The Ten Commandments, The Wrong Man, Journey To The Center Of The Earth, etc. In animation, he will be among the cast of Tintin and the Lake of Sharks. He also works for Yves Allégret, Pierre Colombier, Jean Renoir, and many others.\n\nNow that a new main title is created, French artists can be credited, which hadn't been done before, even for the American actors.\n\nSome of them are not listed though:\n\nAndré Valmy\n\nAndré Valmy, Walter Matthau's French voice (The Odd Couple) as well as Robert Mitchum's, is 43 when he gets the part of the hunter. He also does secundary parts in films for Henri Decoin, Yves Allégret, Henri-Georges Clouzot, André Hunebelle, Raymond Bernard, Christian-Jaque... The list of dubs he did is impressive. From Sissi to Saturday Night Fever or even Jaws , it is unlikely that a French moviegoer has never heard him. In animation, he is part of the cast of The Rescuers Down Under where he is Percival McLeach, and French children born in the eighties remember his character of Vitalis in the Japanese TV Series Homeless Child Remi, from Hector Malot's novel.\n\nSerge Nadaud\n\nSerge Nadaud, 56 years old in 1962, has played under the direction of Claude Autant-Lara, Julien Duvivier, Jean Boyer, but his voice work remains more important: he also sometimes directs dubbing sessions. He plays the part of the magic mirror. He also worked several times for the Belgian animation studio Belvision and played the villain Rastapopoulos in Tintin and the Lake of Sharks [Tintin et le lac aux Requins].He also was the voice of M in the James Bond films and was Spencer Tracy's French voice, but that is only a sample of his immense work.\n\nOn the poster (see above) designed in the Jean Fourastié workshop, the film is called an \"admirable masterpiece\". Athos film is the name of the company that releases the film that year. The characters are stylized and the tag line mirrors the makeover that the film just got: \"Snow White comes back younger than ever!\"\n\nOther posters will also be used like a horizontal format where the Prince carried the young girl away in his arms under the eyes of the dwarfs (see above). The design of a 1958 American poster where Snow White, surrounded with dwarfs is drawn more faithfully to her film design is also recycled on newspaper ads.\n\nLobby card\n\nA set of 20 lobby cards is offered to theater owners.\n\nThe film comes out on September 19, 1962 in 5 theaters in Paris. Here are the numbers of tickets sold during the run:\n\n1st week\n\n2nd week\n\n3rd week\n\n4th week\n\n5th week\n\n6th week\n\nTotal\n\nMadeleine\n\n(721 seats)\n\n11,085\n\n21,156\n\n12,248\n\n6,252\n\n5,235\n\n7,556\n\n63,532\n\nMercury\n\n(500 seats)\n\n8,170\n\n16,700\n\n11,260\n\n6,500\n\n5,750\n\n8,370\n\n56,750\n\nImages\n\n(789 seats)\n\n14,100\n\n24,400\n\n14,550\n\n7,740\n\n8,060\n\n8,500\n\n77,350\n\nBretagne\n\n(850 seats)\n\n15,897\n\n29,080\n\n17,601\n\n8,747\n\n7,940\n\n-\n\n79,265\n\nMax Linder\n\n(804 seats)\n\n9,300\n\n15,631\n\n11,330\n\n7,030\n\n6,524\n\n8,490\n\n58,305\n\nTOTAL\n\n(3,664 seats)\n\n58,552\n\n106,967\n\n66,989\n\n36,269\n\n33,509\n\n32,916\n\n335,202\n\nThe film then comes out for a second exclusivity on February 1st at the Cinémonde Opéra (370 seats) and at the Royale and sells 9,986 tickets during the first week. The Cinémonde Opéra then sells 5,645 more in the second week, then 5,105 in the third, etc. And a total of 359,865 tickets are sold in 10 weeks in Paris alone during the exclusivity. 12 more neighborhood theaters still show the film after that and on March 22, 1963, the distributor reveals that 509,458 tickets have been sold.\n\nStorm in Paris\n\nOnce again, the release of Snow Whiteis greeted here by a lot of white snow! The temperatures are amazingly low and during the first week, people tend to stay at home. On the TV news of December 17, the storm that fell on Paris is illustrated by an image of one of the film's ad that fell on the pavement because of the extreme wind. But an article in Le Film Français says that in spite of these awful weather conditions, in terms of ticket sales, \"it's never been seen before\".\n\nThe film also comes out in 50 provincial towns!

Those who list the best drawings in the order eventually chosen by the jury will win, just like the young artists, a trip to Disneyland - Hollywood. The presence of Snow White is announced and she will present gift to the injured children of the hospital of Garches. This event is also announced with a trailer that runs in 200 theaters from November 15. Europe n°1 receives 30,000 drawings. On Monday December 24, a cocktail at Maxim's is organized to exhibit the best of them. Among the members of the jury, there is Maurice Chevalier, sportsman Michel Jazy, artist Jean Carzou, poster designer Raymond Savignac, illustrator Jean Bellus and journalist Louis Merlin.\n\nA new ally, not available in 1951, will help tremendously in the promotion of the film: television.\n\nIn fact, since November 5, 1961, Pierre Tchernia has created the show \"L'ami public n°1\" (Public Friend #1) on what is then the only black and white French television network. That very first episode opens with an instrumental version of the silly song, and the magic mirror appears at the eight minute.\n\nThe soup sequence\n\nOn December 7, 1962, in the show \"Cinq colonnes à la une\", a television report announces that \"Snow White comes back\" and offers a priceless document: a glimpse of the actors recording the new French version of the sequence when Snow White meets the dwarfs, after which, Pierre Tchernia brings back a 4 minute scene of Snow White which isn't in the final cut: the soup sequence. Naturally the scene isn't finished and is in English, but Tchernia briefly explains the action over the soundtrack.\n\nOn December 23, 1962, Snow White makes the cover of Télé Magazine (TV Guide) which proudly announces 4 Snow White related shows this week!\n\nThis Snow White festival begins that day at 2.30 pm, with the Tousistitis (spelled \"Twistitis\" in the program), a group of singing kids who perform in \"Télé Dimanche\" (\"Sunday TV\") where you can also see and hear Caravelli and his magical violins accompanying Lucie Dolène singing Snow White songs.\n\nAn instrumental record by Caravelli has actually been released, without Lucie Dolène's singing. At the Wednesday page, an ad for this record gives a list of the tracks: Sifflez en travaillant, un sourire en chantant, Un jour mon Prince viendra and Heigh Ho.\n\nAnother record will follow with both Caravelli and Lucie Dolène this time, just like in the show. The cover uses the same drawing as on the poster.In it, she sings Je souhaite, un chant, Un jour mon Prince viendra and Un sourire en chantant. Despite the fact that she is ow the official voice of the character, she sings reorchestrated versions of the songs, with alternate lyrics, this is not the original soundtrack of the film, which has never been released in France.\n\nYou can also purchase the Touistitis record with Sifflez en travaillant and Heigh Ho (pronounce \"ayo\") on it.\n\nAt 12.30 pm on Thursday 27, La séquence du jeune spectateur (The sequence of the young spectator), a show by Claude Mionnet presented by a puppet, deals with two movies: The Girl And The Legend starring Romy Schneider and \"a really special film, a wonderful fairy tale\"Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs. On the program is also an ad for Le Journal de Mickey (Mickey's newspaper) which publishes a comic adaptation in color.\n\nOn December 29, at 8.30 pm, Pierre Tchernia presents Snow White for 15 minutes.\n\nWalt Disney & Pierre Tchernia\n\nOn December 31, 1962, L'ami public n°1 follows Pierre Tchernia in his trip to California where he was invited at the Disney studios and Disneyland. The report shows him with Clarence Nash Clarence Nash, animators and Walt Disney himself. We are treated to 6 minutes of Snow White discovering the cottage and singing Whistle While You Work.\n\nThat same day, at 8.45, Isabelle Aubret (which had won France's third victory at Eurovision singing contest this past March) sings, disguised as Snow White, \"Un jour mon Prince viendra\" in the show \"La grande farandole\".The show opens with the seven dwarfs who are none other that the hosts Roger Pierre & Jean-Marc Thibault (a famous French comic duo), with Maurice Biraud, Jean-Claude Pascal (winner of the 1961 Eurovision contest for Luxembourg), Jean-Pierre Cassel, Gilbert Bécaud and Pierre Tchernia !\n\nIsabelle Aubret releases a record of Snow White songs conducted by Gilbert Le Roy.\n\nI mentioned it before, on December 9, Le journal de Mickey the first episode of the comic adaptation of Snow White. It is rather graphically rather similar to the 1938 version, but the adaptation is different. For instance, the meeting with the Prince does not involve a bucket anymore but he still goes to jail, a concept meant for the film but eventually abandoned.\n\nA new storybook record is also record that year: an adaptation od Jean Baitzouroff, it is Dany Robin who tells the story on this recording which will be reedited many times with various covers. Sylvine Delannoy (The Bride Wore Black) is the Princess, Claude Nollier (Moulin Rouge) plays the Queen and Gaëtan Jor plays Grincheux (Grumpy), Atchoum (Sneezy) and the magic mirror. The remaining parts are held by François Timmerman, Roland Roessler (or Roland Koessler) and Fred Descamp (or Fred Descamps). Christiane Legrand's songs, recorded in 1955 are mixed into the story. Funny detail: the animals on the first page are actually Bambi and Thumper.\n\nThese same songs are released in the US, alternating with Tutti Camarata's for the album Snow White in French and English.\n\nIn 1964, a new edition of the first recording of the story of Snow White surfaces again: after its initial 1938 release on two 78 rpm discs, then its 1955 reissue on a 45 rpm, now a 33 rpm offers the story as told by Adrien Lamy starring Elyane Célis on its flip side. On the A side of the disc is the story of Alice in Wonderland starring Marie-Claire Marty.\n\nIn 1967 comes yet again a new version of the story told by Claude Nicot with Anna Gaylor as Snow White and Monique Martial as the Queen. The story starts like the film \"il y avait une fois...\". The illustrations are the same as in the Hachette book of 1951 in the \"albums roses\" collection. At the end of the story, the same recordings of Heigh Ho and Sifflez en travaillant sung by Christiane Legrand are offered.\n\nIn 1968, it is Caroline Cler who narrates the French version of the story \"Les sept nains et la mine de diamants\" (The seven dwarfs and the diamond mine). She does all the roles. On one of the drawings, the dwarfs hold sheet music entitled \"You're never too old to be young\", a song originally conceived for the film but one that went unused. It the American version of the disc, the dwarfs do sing that song as well as Music in Your Soup, another deleted number.\n\nThe records are not the only things that make the magic of the film last through the years. Extracts regularly appear on TV, now with the new French version.The magic mirror hosts a show on January 2, 1964 called \"À nous l'an 2000\" (The year 2,000 is ours).\n\nS.V.P. Disney\n\nFor Christmas that year, a new concept will last until 1989 ! S.V.P. Disney proposes young viewers to call the show and to choose from a list, the extract of the Disney film that they want to see. The host of the show, of course, is Pierre Tchernia.\n\nMary Poppins Premiere\n\nAmateurs of Disney still are treated to the show L'ami public numéro 1 on a regular basis and in the October 3, 1965 show 4 minutes of the silly song are presented. In the same show, Snow White herself attends the premiere of Mary Poppins and meets Walt Disney himself there. The commentator reminds us that the last big world premiere happened in 1937 for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\n\nThe day after the death of Walt Disney, a short version of the soup sequence is broadcast in the show \"Panorama, le magazine de l'actualité télévisé\" on December 16, 1966, this time with a presentation by Walt Disney, interviewed by Pierre Tchernia. Twenty seconds of the silly song and a homage follow.\n\nOn December 30, 1966, for S.V.P. Disney, one of the first film chosen is, as often, Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs and 5 minutes and 40 seconds of the discovery of the cottage are shown. On December 24, 1967, we have 4 minutes of the silly song.\n\nOn December 10, 1967, L'ami public n°1 opens with a brief extract of the frog clock ringing. But the amateurs of the film will have more: an amazing 6 minutes and 20 seconds follow with the Queen ordering the hunter to kill the Princess, the flight through the woods and the song With A Smile And A Song.\n\nOn March 31, 1968, Pierre Tchernia offers 3 minutes of Snow White in L'ami public numéro 1 with an animal theme: its is the song Whistle While You Work where so many animals help the heroin.\n\nOn October 13, 1968 : Pierre Tchernia offers the soup sequence again. We then get 1 minute and 25 seconds of the song I'm Wishing.\n\nOn December 25, 1968, it's time for S.V.P. Disney again and the show opens with a shot of figurines of the dwarfs. Pierre Tchernia is not surprised that \"each year, the number one requested film is Snow White\". And he offers the scene in the mine, but he explains that, since the film is so in demand during the holidays, all available French copies in Paris are now in movie theaters so all that's left is an English copy. For once, the dwarfs will sing in English on French TV.\n\nThis little speech proves that the film, even without a national release since 1962, is still occasionally shown in some theaters, especially at Christmas.\n\nOn December 25, 1969, we get the Whistle While You Work sequence. Surprisingly, it is actually the first French version that is presented. A late appearance for such a rare track, now!\n\nOn December 25, 1970, it has become a habit of seeing an image of Snow White behind the show's title card. Once more, \"an enormous majority\" of ballots for Snow White are satisfied by 3 minutes of the silly song.\n\nOn December 25, 1971, Lucie Dolène is once again the French voice of Snow White on Whistle While you Work for 4 minutes.\n\nOn December 25, 1972, for the first time, in spite of of a three minute extract of With A Smile And A Song, Snow White is not the first requested film. Pierre Tchernia explains that by the arrival of many great new features like The Jungle Book, and also by the fact that \"Snow White may be somewhat forgotten since its last release\", but he has good news: we will get to see her again (or maybe discover her) for Christmas 1973, an important year for the Disney studios who celebrate their 50th anniversary.\n\nDon't forget to click \"like\" on the Facebook page to get updates!\n\nThat's all for today folks!\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nSnow White in France. Chapter 4: 1973.\n\nFor their 50th anniversary, the Disney studios want to to celebrate in a big way.\n\nIn September 1973, \"Si Disney m'était conté\"[Once Upon A Time Disney] is released in France. It is a package of shorts like Hawaiian Holiday starring Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy, followed by \"Le monde magique de Walt Disney World\" a documentary about the Florida resort which has opened two years before that and is twice larger than Manhattan. The film stays 15 weeks on the French screens with 149,215 tickets sold.\n\nThen comes The World's Greatest Athlete in November, One Little Indian in February 1974 and an Easter re-release of The Song of the South. The press release even announces a new feature for Christmas 1974 : Robin Hood.\n\nBut for the time being, the crowned jewel of Christmas 1973 is \"the first and still the greatest of the great feature cartoons\", Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs.\n\nOn December 14, 1973, it is announced that new arrangements regarding foreign distribution have been made: if MGM was previously responsible, it is now la 20th Century Fox International which will oversee the Disney releases in Germany, Denmark, Argentina, Columbia, Peru, Central America, Taiwan, Greece and Eastern Africa. CIC will take care of Brazil, the Middle East, Italy and Austria. Wometca is getting Puerto Rico and Amalgamated Theatres gets New Zeland.\n\nNaturally, Buena Vista International takes charge in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Japan and France, under the name \"Walt Disney Productions\", which offices are located at 52 avenue des Champs-Elysées, in the old RKO building.\n\nThe new poster, available for theater owners at 40x50 cm, 120x160 cm, as a two-piece vertical 160x240 cm, or an eight piece horizontal panel of 400x300 cm, announces \"The cartoon masterpiece\" and features the studio's 50th anniversary logo.\n\nLobby card\n\n9 color lobby cards are also available, as well as press photos and of course, a trailer. As complement, the shorts Les contes de ma mère l'Oie [Mother Goose Melodies?] and Hiawatha le petit indien [Little Hiawatha] are part of the package.\n\nBut this time, the already solid publicity campaign is coupled with a wider promotional operation. For that purpose, Jean Tomachot, head manager of the production company gathers the C.E.O.s of several big companies and the heads of the U.G.C. theater chain which will release the film on about 100 screens in the country, at Club 13, a popular restaurant among film professionals, to prepare a 6 month marketing campaign on Snow White.\n\nAs early as October, Euromarché supermarkets publicize the film with a 4 million franc budget and organize a contest to win 400 trips to Disney World at easter. The also sell boxes of Banania chocolate drink that also offer a contest where \"21,000 prizes\" can be won: the game of magic mirrors, which first prizes are a trip \"in the land of Walt Disney\" and 10,000 francs. 800 messages on several radio stations will announce the contest: Europe n°1, RTL, Radio Monte Carlo, Radio Andorre and Sud Radio.\n\nFrom October 1 to December 4, a tour in 40 provincial towns is organized with the characters in costume so that children can see their heroes in real life before press screenings or at special events.\n\nAt the salon de l'enfance (Childhood salon) which takes place at the CNIT from October 27 to November 11, a million visitors can see the shows in the giant theaters on the theme of Snow White. The Snow White trailer is shown on a giant screen during intermission.\n\nIn November, the laughing cow offers Snow White stickers in their boxes of cheese. The film's characters can be found on Nova yogurts. For 3 months, the packaging of Knorr's mashed potatoes comes with a cardboard set and characters. From November 15, all Coca-Cola trucks have a Snow White poster on the back. Henkel decorate their boxes of Super-croix washing powder with scenes of the film and offer a promotional record of the story of Snow White recorded by Micheline Presle in their boxes of Dato. 8,000 notions store \"Laines du pingouin\" sell patterns of the characters to knit.\n\n150 companies who bought the Snow White license in various domains like clothes, school supplies, toys, etc. flood the market with Snow White.\n\nHachette plans 18 different books, from the popular edition to the deluxe version with 300,000 copies for the first press. Records are announced for the end of the year. Some are old books that are being reprinted and others are new adaptations.\n\nHachette comic book\n\nFrance soir\n\nThe comic adaptation is redrawn, published as a book, and also in color in Le journal de Mickey weekly from December 1, and in black and white in France Soir.\n\nNaturally, more records are made and Le petit ménestrel company publishes Dany Robin's recording again with a new cover. This time even audio cassettes are made. François Périer's version is also reissued. Yet, in spite of an avalanche of new releases, the French original soundtrack can only be heard in theaters as no records are cut yet. Marc Laferrière also releases a 45 rpm where he plays the tunes of the film in a New Orleans jazzy version. On publie également l'enregistrement américain de Tutti Camarata pour l'occasion.\n\nThe record that has the privilege of featuring the official Snow White poster that year is the LP (and single) of Henri Salvador. On it is a song especially composed for the release and appropriately title \"Blanche Neige et les sept nains\". Other than the song Heigh Ho, that isn't even found on the single, none of the other songs of the album has anything to do with Snow White. The song \"J'ai envie de Lucie\" (=\"I want Lucie\" maybe a nod to Lucie Dolène?) is even relatively inappropriate for a child to hear.\n\nSo why such a privilege then? At the time, Henri Salvador has a weekly Sunday show on TV, Dimanche Salvador, in which he generously promotes his songs, often aimed at a young audience. He will naturally become a kind of Disney ambassador and he, along with Pierre Tchernia, is the one who will talk most of the Princess on TV that year. He had even sung Some Day Your Prince Will Come on December 16, 1972 on the show Top à Joe Dassin.\n\nSheet music of Henri Salvador's song\n\nAll dressed in white with a matching top hat, he sings his Snow White song to a playback, with characters in costume behind him (he confuses Sneezy and Bshful), on October 7 and November 25 1973, and on January 1, and May 21, 1974.\n\nOn October 21, 1973, still in Dimanche Salvador, in the same conditions, he sings Heigh Ho.\n\nPierre Tchernia\n\nDecember 2, 1973 TV Guide\n\nBut Pierre Tchernia is still very much present and is show L'ami public numéro 1 of December 2, 1973 is dedicated to Snow White. First he offers a 3,30 minute extract of the escape through the woods. Then Tchernia tells of his 1962 visit to the French dubbing studio. Images of that are shown again as well as his interview of Walt Disney and the now famous soup sequence.\n\nBut this will not be his only show: he is now host to a quizz show called Le dernier des cinq (Last of the Five), in which contestants must guess a film title according to clues. On December 23, a clip of the dwarfs washing is shown.\n\nAnd on December 25, it is time for the usual Christmas show: S.V.P. Disney, where by popular demand, the silly song is shown.\n\nPierre Tchernia\n\nAll this should not make you forget the film itself: from November, special showings of the film are organized for handicapped children, as in Nice during the carnival which theme this year is \"In Wonderland\".\n\nIn Paris, the release is announced for December 5, 1973 in sixteen theaters. In the first week, the Rex skyrockets as the first theater in the city in terms of ticket sales (31,024) and Snow White is the second film in that department right behind The Man From Acapulco starring Jean-Paul Belmondo. There are similar results in Lille where the top films are, The Man From Acapulco, Snow White, The Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob and Sugar Cookies!\n\nYet everywhere else, Snow White takes the first place of the box office, often way before its contestants, which gives it first place nationwide. The film is released in 12 cities and 40 theaters during this exclusivity.\n\nFront of the Telstar theater\n\nAt the time, competition is tough: in December 19, as Rabbi Jacob ands its ninth week with 1,093,564 tickets sold, Snow White already sold 220,261 in two weeks. The little Princess also hs to fight the most famous secret agent on the planet with the release of Live and Let Die which steals first place in Paris, although the Rex stays at the top of the list thanks to the Disney film.\n\nMagic Convention Theater front\n\nOn January 14, one can rad in La cinématographie française that Snow White is the \"absolute record breaker of Walt Disney re-releases\". \"In 4 weeks, Snow White has met Rabbi Jacob in the (very private) club of films that made over 10 million francs of gross (...). Christmas week saw an advantage for My Name Is Nobody, but the Disney film took the first place back for Newyears with 3,420,146 francs\".\n\nHere is a sample of figurs:\n\n12/5\n\nDu 6/12 au 12/12\n\nFrom 12/13 to 12/19\n\nFrom 12/20 to 12/26\n\nFrom 12/27 to 1/02\n\nFrom 1/03 to 1/08\n\nFrom 1/09 to 1/15\n\nFrom 1/16 to 1/22\n\nFrom 1/23 to 1/29\n\nFrom 1/30 to 2/05\n\nTotal (tickets + gross)\n\n16,293 (FF163,281)\n\n111,426 (FF2,286,216)\n\n92,542 (FF2,035,816)\n\n139,463 (FF2,329,865)\n\n182,266 (FF3,420,146)\n\n38,939 (FF1,057,496)\n\n36,691 (FF495,220)\n\n(FF275,127)\n\n(FF153,867)\n\nCombined Total (Paris tickets/ Country's gross)\n\n127,719 (FF2,449,497)\n\n220,261 (FF4,485,313)\n\n359,724 (FF6,815,178)\n\n541,990 (FF10,235,324)\n\n580,929 (FF11,292,820)\n\n617,620 (FF11,788,040)\n\n636,190 (FF12,063,167)\n\n647,164 (FF12,217,034)\n\n657,088\n\nList of Paris theaters (and surrounding towns):\n\nFrom 12/06 to 12/12\n\nFrom 12/13 to 12/19\n\nFrom 12/20 to 12/26\n\nFrom 12/27 to 1/02\n\nFrom 1/03 to 1/08\n\nFrom 1/09 to 1/15\n\nRex\n\n31,024\n\n24,407\n\n63,934\n\n70,652\n\n12,639\n\n12,004\n\nL'Hermitage\n\n7,512\n\n5,874\n\n9,058\n\n2,367\n\n2,505\n\nMiramar\n\n7,853\n\n5,955\n\n10,058\n\n2,384\n\n2,540\n\nMistral\n\n6,216\n\n5,130\n\n10,942\n\n2,686\n\n2,446\n\nTelstar\n\n7,565\n\n6,015\n\n11,282\n\n3,085\n\n3,228\n\nMagic-Convention\n\n7,344\n\n5,205\n\n7,552\n\n1,856\n\n1,609\n\n3 Murat\n\n3,436\n\n2,357\n\n3,854\n\n1,037\n\n-\n\nTerminal-Foch\n\n2,097\n\n1,749\n\n3,308\n\n626\n\n857\n\nUGC Odéon\n\n253\n\n6,355\n\n3,562\n\n1,119\n\n1,042\n\nCyrano Versailles\n\n6,662\n\n5,386\n\n12,511\n\n2,218\n\n2,145\n\nCarrefour Pantin\n\n6,181\n\n5,147\n\n7,449\n\n1,970\n\n1,845\n\nPalais du Parc\n\n8,013\n\n7,512\n\n11,174\n\n2,586\n\n-\n\nArtel Villeneuve\n\n5,446\n\n4,392\n\n7,478\n\n1,536\n\n-\n\nArtel Nogent\n\n1,579\n\nAlpha Argenteuil\n\n2,347\n\nLes Flanades\n\n1,969\n\nHollywood Enghien\n\n5,225\n\n3,534\n\n5,988\n\n1,189\n\nDame Blanche\n\n3,797\n\n2,518\n\n3,353\n\n595\n\n575\n\nRoyal St Germain\n\n2,802\n\n2,006\n\n4,045\n\n1,046\n\nAnd now for provincial towns:\n\nFrom 12/05 to 12/11\n\nFrom 12/12 to 12/18\n\nFrom 12/19 to 12/25\n\nFrom 12/26 to 1/01\n\nFrom 1/03 to 1/08\n\nFrom 1/09 to 1/15\n\nFrom 1/16 to 1/22\n\nFrom 1/23 to 1/29\n\nMarseille (Capitole, Odéon, Majestic, K7).\n\n24,025\n\n19,135\n\n16,412\n\n28,680\n\n9,367\n\n4,218\n\n1,682\n\n1,330\n\nBordeaux (Ariel, Mondial)\n\n9,398\n\n10,212\n\n11,149\n\n14,484\n\n4,489\n\n1,891\n\n1,189\n\nRouen (Club, Ariel)\n\n7,317\n\n5,861\n\n5,993\n\n9,525\n\n3,072\n\n1,478\n\n-\n\nStrasbourg (Capitole, Rit's)\n\n12,588\n\n9,835\n\n8,136\n\n10,792\n\n4,090\n\n1,211\n\n-\n\nNancy (Lumière)\n\n8,074\n\n8,011\n\n7,928\n\n11,305\n\n2,969\n\n1,515\n\n-\n\nLille (Métropole)\n\n9,471\n\n8,253\n\n10,288\n\n17,361\n\n3,969\n\n1,991\n\n-\n\nToulon (Royal)\n\n7,273\n\n6,830\n\n7,212\n\n10,211\n\n3,803\n\n2,311\n\n-\n\nToulouse (Variétés)\n\n10,924\n\n10,641\n\n12,181\n\n15,944\n\n5,458\n\n1,243\n\n-\n\nLyon (Cinéjournal, Ritz, Zola, Duo)\n\n17,020\n\n16,487\n\n17,552\n\n30,583\n\n8,917\n\n4,709\n\n-\n\nNice (Forum, Paramount, Concorde)\n\n12,065\n\n9,336\n\n8,598\n\n13,494\n\n4,336\n\n1,980\n\n-\n\nMetz (Ariel)\n\n6,664\n\n5,514\n\n4,223\n\n7,505\n\n2,976\n\n-\n\n-\n\nIt is eventually once more an enormous success for Snow White, especially in the week between Christmas and Newyears where grand-parents who had loved the film as kids, and who had taken their own children to see it, are now gladly waiting two hours in the cold for the chance to show Snow White to their grand-children.\n\nIn the spirit of the 1939 Menier albums, and the 1951 Eclair albums, Vanderhout internationale S.A. offers a sticker album with the poster of the film on the cover. Pierre Tchernia writes the introduction and, this time, the stickers are not new drawings, they are actual stills from the film! Issued in Belgium and France, it is clearly a French-speaking company's initiative: the still of Snow White in the bedroom has been taken from a French copy of the film: on it, the dwarfs' names are in French!\n\nAs usual, the memory of the film is kept alive through various books, records and TV Shows well after the film has left the screen. Extracts will be shown on June 15, 1975 (The silly song) in the show Système deux, On December 26, 1976 with Michel Drucker as host of a special Christmas edition of Les rendez-vous du dimanche where Henri Salvador sings \"La chanson rose\" (The pink song) where he evokes Disn"
