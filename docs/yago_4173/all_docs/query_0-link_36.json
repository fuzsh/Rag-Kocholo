Photo: Agence Générale Cinématographique.\n\t\n\tAndrée Brabant (1901-1989) was a French film actress whose career peaked in the silent era of French cinema. \n\tMarie Thérèse Andrée Brabant, born in Reims on 23 mai 1901. Shortly after her birth, she was placed in the custody of her grandmother before returning at the age of four to her father, a railway employee, and her mother, a housewife. Ten years later, after an infidelity of his father, her parents separated. She followed her mother to Paris where she quickly found work as shorthand-typist. Shortly afterwards, she met the ballet master of the Mayol concerts and was engaged by Félix Mayol himself to be a dancer in his revues. In 1916 Abel Gance was looking for a young artist for his next film, Le Droit à la vie (The Right to Life), when one of his friends advised him to go and see the new dancer at Mayol’s. The filmmaker fell for her charm and immediately offered her the female lead role. Andrée Brabant left the stage to fully devote herself to cinema. The following year Abel Gance used her again as protagonist in La zone de la mort  (The Zone of Death), also with Léon Mathot, and she acted in André Antoine’s Les travailleurs de la mer (Workers of the Sea), adapted from Victor Hugo and starring Romuald Joubé. For twelve years, the beautiful young actress, still chaperoned by her mother, performed in about twenty productions that would make her a real star. Her best films include: La cigarette (Cigarette, Germaine Dulac 1919); La maison vide (The Empty House, Raymond Bernard 1921); Le rêve (The Dream, Jacques de Baroncelli 1921), an adaptation of Emile Zola; Les ombres qui passent (The Shadows That Pass, Alexandre Volkoff 1924) with the great Russian actor Ivan Mozzhukhin with whom she has a brief liaison; and Le mariage de Mademoiselle Beulemans (The Marriage of Mademoiselle Beulemans, 1927), one of the very first films of Julien Duvivier. She also appeared in two serials of quality, Travail (Work, 1919) by Henri Pouctal and Tao, le fantôme noir (Tao, the black ghost, 1923) by Gaston Ravel and starring Joë Hamman. \n\t\n\tIn La cigarette Brabant was the wife of a museum director (Gabriel Signoret) who suspects his wife of infidelity and places a poisoned cigarette in the box on his desk, allowing fate to strike. In La maison vide Brabant was a young typist hired by an old entomologist (Henri Debain), who is fascinated with her, while two industrialists (Pierre Alcover, Jacques Roussel) try to conquer her. She instead favours a young clerk, so her employer is left alone in his empty house. In Le rêve she is a foundling gathered under a porch of a cathedral, who once adult suffers from a bishop (Gabriel Signoret) who opposes his son’s marriage with her. When he finally consents she dies during her wedding at the place where she was found. In Les ombres qui passent she is the wife of Mozzhukhin who is caught in a net of swindlers led by femme fatale Nathalie Lissenko. In Le mariage de Mademoiselle Beulemans, a romantic comedy based on a classic play by Jean François Fonson and Fernand Wicheler, Brabant is a Belgian brewer’s daughter who is bethrothed to a local (René Lefevre), even when loving a Parisian classy man (Jean Dehelly). The daughter finds out the fiancé secretly already has a wife and kid. At that time, Andrée Brabant led a sumptuous life, bought a mansion in Neuilly-sur-Seine, which was soon called the Hotel Brabant, and accumulated amorous adventures, some of them illustrious, e.g. with King Fouad 1er Of Egypt and the President of the Republic Paul Deschanel. She never married and never had a child, a sacrifice for her career that she would accept without regret for the rest of her life.\n\t\n\tIn 1929, Andrée Brabant played in her first talk film, &quot;Maternity&quot; by Jean Benoît-Lévy, but she made the mistake of believing that this new Art was not made for her. The star honoured the few film contracts in progress and then left to play comedy at the Grand-Guignol theater to prove to her audience that she did not need cinema to know how to speak. But, with the arrival of sound film,  competition became rough and the salaries less and less. Andrée separated herself little by little from all of her jewellery, then from all his possessions, including her mansion. Nevertheless, she remained active at the Grand Guignol until the end of the Second World War. After the Liberation, Andrée Brabant went to live with her mother in Marseille. After the death of the latter and without resources, she became a demonstrator in household appliances for Brandt and travelled for her job all over France and North Africa. At the age of retirement, she settled in Belgentier in the Var region. In 1964 Jean-Christophe Averty made for his TV documentary series Trente ans de silence one episode with and on Brabant. In 1964, she also played her last film role in Gilles Grangier's L'âge ingrat (The Ungrateful Age) with Fernandel and Jean Gabin, after which the old actress inexorably sank into oblivion. She died on 2 November 1989 in Toulon in the most total anonymity. All in all, Brabant acted in some 32 films.\n\t\n\tSources: Pascal Donald (<a href=\"https://www.cineartistes.com/fiche-Andr%e9e+Brabant.html?PHPSESSID=d23ec1c5a367484a97b25f756b043983\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">CineArtistes</a>), <a href=\"http://www.unifrance.org/annuaires/personne/376604/andree-brabant\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">Unifrance</a>, Wikipedia (French) and IMDb.",
