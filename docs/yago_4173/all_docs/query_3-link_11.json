        "text": "Many words in the English vocabulary are of French origin, most coming from the Anglo-Norman spoken by the upper classes in England for several hundred years after the Norman Conquest, before the language settled into what became Modern English. English words of French origin, such as art, competition, force, machine, and table are pronounced according to English rules of phonology, rather than French, and are commonly used by English speakers without any consciousness of their French origin.\n\nThis article covers French words and phrases that have entered the English lexicon without ever losing their character as Gallicisms: they remain unmistakably \"French\" to an English speaker. They are most common in written English, where they retain French diacritics and are usually printed in italics. In spoken English, at least some attempt is generally made to pronounce them as they would sound in French. An entirely English pronunciation is regarded as a solecism.\n\nSome of them were never \"good French\", in the sense of being grammatical, idiomatic French usage. Some others were once normal French, but have become very old-fashioned, or have acquired different meanings and connotations in the original language, to the extent that they would not be understood, either at all, or in the intended sense, by a native French speaker.\n\nContents\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\nNot used as such in French — Found only in English — French phrases in international air-sea rescue — See also — References\n\nà la\n\nshort for (ellipsis of) à la manière de; in the manner of/in the style of[1]\n\nà la carte\n\nlit. \"on the card, i.e. menu\"; In restaurants it refers to ordering individual dishes \"à la carte\" rather than a fixed-price meal \"menu\".

(long live free Quebec, a sovereigntist slogan famously used by French President Charles de Gaulle in 1967 in Montreal). Unlike viva (Italian and Spanish) or vivat (Latin), it cannot be used alone; it needs a complement.\n\nvive la différence!\n\nlit. \"[long] live the difference\"; originally referring to the difference between the sexes; the phrase may be also used to celebrate the difference between any two groups of people (or simply the general diversity of individuals).\n\nvoilà !\n\nlit. \"see there\"; in French it can mean simply \"there it is\"; in English it is generally restricted to a triumphant revelation.\n\nvolte-face\n\nfrenchified form of Italian volta faccia, lit. \"turn face\", an about-face, a maneuver in marching; figuratively, a complete reversal of opinion or position.\n\nvoulez-vous coucher avec moi (ce soir)?\n\n\"Do you want to sleep with me (tonight)?\" or more appropriately, \"Will you spend the night with me?\" In French, coucher is vulgar in this sense. In English it appears in Tennessee Williams's play A Streetcar Named Desire, as well as in the lyrics of a popular song by Labelle, \"Lady Marmalade.\"\n\nvoyeur\n\nlit. \"someone who sees\"; a Peeping Tom.[61]\n\nzut alors!\n\n\"Darn it!\" or the British expression \"Blimey!\" This is a general exclamation (vulgar equivalent is merde alors ! \"Damn it!\"). Just plain zut is also in use, often repeated for effect: zut, zut et zut ! There is an album by Frank Zappa, punningly titled Zoot Allures. The phrase is also used on the Saturday Night Live Weekend Update sketch by recurring character Jean K. Jean, played by Kenan Thompson as well as by John Goodman's Dan Conner in an episode of Roseanne when Roseanne dresses up in a sexy outfit and has a boudoir photo taken of her as a birthday gift for her husband.\n\nThrough the evolution of the language, many words and phrases are no longer used in modern French. Also there are expressions that, even though grammatically correct, do not have the same meaning in French as the English words derived from them. Some older word usages still appear in Quebec French.\n\nà la mode\n\nfashionable; in the US it also describes a dessert with ice cream (as in \"apple pie à la mode\") or, in some US regions, with cheese. In French, it mainly means \"fashionable\", \"trendy\", but is occasionally a culinary term usually meaning something cooked with carrots and onions (as in bœuf à la mode). It can also mean \"in the style or manner [of]\"[62] (as in tripes à la mode de Caen), and in this acceptation is similar to the shorter expression \"à la\". The British English meaning and usage is the same as in French.\n\naccoutrement\n\npersonal military or fighting armaments worn about one's self; has come to mean the accompanying items available to pursue a mission, or just accessories in general. In French, means a funny or ridiculous clothing; often a weird disguise or a getup, though it can be said also for people with bad taste in clothing.\n\nappliqué\n\nan inlaid or attached decorative feature. Lit. \"applied\", though this meaning does not exist as such in French. However \"appliqué inversé\" exists and has the same meaning as a reverse appliqué. Also an \"applique murale\" is a decorative light fixture attached on a wall.\n\naprès-ski\n\nlit. \"after skiing\", socializing after a ski session; in French, this word refers to boots used to walk in snow (e.g. MoonBoots). Commonly used for the same thing as in English in Quebec.\n\narrêt à bon temps\n\nA counterattack that attempts to take advantage of an uncertain attack in fencing. Though grammatically correct, this expression is not used in French. The term arrêt exists in fencing, with the meaning of a \"simple counteroffensive action\"; the general meaning is \"a stop\". A related French expression: s'arrêter à temps (to stop in time).\n\nartiste\n\na skilled performer, a person with artistic pretensions. In French: an artist. Can be used ironically for a person demonstrating little professional skill or passion in both languages.\n\nau naturel\n\nnude; in French, literally, in a natural manner or way (au is the contraction of à le, masculine form of à la). It means \"in an unaltered way\" and can be used either for people or things. For people, it rather refers to a person who does not use make-up or artificial manners (un entretien au naturel = a backstage interview). For things, it means that they have not been altered. Often used in cooking, like thon au naturel: canned tuna without any spices or oil. Also in heraldry, meaning \"in natural colours\", especially flesh colour, which is not one of the \"standard\" colours of heraldry.\n\nauteur\n\nA film director, specifically one who controls most aspects of a film, or other controller of an artistic situation. The English connotation derives from French film theory. It was popularized in the journal Cahiers du cinéma: auteur theory maintains that directors like Hitchcock exert a level of creative control equivalent to the author of a literary work. In French, the word means \"author\", but some expressions like cinéma d'auteur are also in use.\n\nbête noire\n\na scary or unpopular person, idea, or thing, or the archetypal scary monster in a story; literally \"black beast.\" In French, être la bête noire de quelqu'un (\"to be somebody's black beast\") means that you're particularly hated by this person or this person has a strong aversion against you, regardless of whether you're scary or not. The dictionary of the Académie française admits its use only for people, though other dictionaries admit it for things or ideas too. It also means that one is repeatedly defeated by a person, who is thus considered their archenemy (for instance, \"Nadal is the bête noire of Roger Federer\").\n\nboutique\n\na clothing store, usually selling designer/one off pieces rather than mass-produced clothes. Can also describe a quirky and/or upmarket hotel. In French, it can describe any shop, clothing or otherwise. The expression hôtel-boutique can be used to refer to upmarket hotels, but the word is recent and not as widespread as the equivalent expression boutique hotel.\n\nboutonnière\n\nIn English, a boutonnière is a flower placed in the buttonhole of a suit jacket. In French, a boutonnière is the buttonhole itself. Yet the French expression \"Une fleur à la boutonnière\" has an equivalent meaning.\n\nc'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre\n\n\"it is magnificent, but it is not war\" — quotation from Marshal Pierre Bosquet commenting on the charge of the Light Brigade. Unknown quotation in French.\n\ncause célèbre\n\nAn issue arousing widespread controversy or heated public debate, lit. 'famous cause'. It is correct grammatically, but the expression is not used in French.\n\nchacun à son goût\n\n\"each to his own taste,\" i.e. de gustibus non est disputandum or \"there's no accounting for tastes.\" The French phrase was popularized by its use in the aria \"Ich lade gern mir Gäste ein\" from Johann Strauss's operetta Die Fledermaus (1874). The correct expressions in French would be chacun ses goûts / à chacun ses goûts / à chacun son goût: \"to each his/her own taste(s).\"\n\nchanson\n\na classical \"art song\", equiv. to the German Lied or the Italian aria; or, in Russian, a cabaret-style sung narrative, usually rendered by a guttural male voice with guitar accompaniment. In French, it can be used to refer to any song, but it also refers to the same music genre as in English (someone practicing this genre being generally called a chansonnier in Quebec, especially if they sing at a restaurant or cabaret).\n\nchâteau\n\na manor house or a country house of nobility or gentry, with or without fortifications, originally—and still most frequently—in French-speaking regions. The word château is also used for castles in French, so where clarification is needed, the term château fort (\"strong castle\") is used to describe a castle.\n\nchef\n\nin English, a person who cooks professionally for other people. In French the word means \"head\" or \"chief\"; a professional cook is a cuisinier (lit. \"cook\"), chef-cuisinier referring to a head cook. Also, sous-chef, the second-in-command, directly under the head chef. Traditionally, chef used to means the head, for example a \"couvre-chef\" is a headgear, but by extension it's often used in job titles, military ranks, for a person in charge or who leads a group of people: \"chef d'État\" (lit. \"Head of State\" and \"Chief of State\"), \"chef d'entreprise\" (\"Business executive\"), \"chef d'orchestre\" (Conductor of an Orchestra), \"sergeant-chef\" (Staff Sergeant), \"chef de gare\" (stationmaster), \"chef de famille\" (head of household), etc. More casually in a work context, a chef is a boss.\n\ncinq à sept\n\nextraconjugal affair between five and seven pm. In French, though it can also mean this, it primarily means any relaxing time with friends between the end of work and the beginning of the marital obligations. In Quebec French, it is also used as a synonym for \"Happy Hour\" by bars and restaurants that serve discounted drinks after working hours.\n\nclaque\n\na group of admirers; in French, \"la claque\" is a group of people paid to applaud or disturb a piece at the theatre, though the common meaning of \"claque\" is \"a slap\"; clique is used in this sense (but in a pejorative way).\n\nconnoisseur\n\nan expert in wines, fine arts, or other matters of culture; a person of refined taste. It is spelled connaisseur in modern French (lit. \"someone who knows\").\n\ncorsage\n\nA bouquet of flowers worn on a woman's dress or worn around her wrist. In French, it refers to a woman's chest (from shoulder to waist) and, by extension, the part of a woman's garment that covers this area.\n\ncoup de main (pl. coups de main)\n\na surprise attack. In French, [donner] un coup de main means \"[to give] a hand\" (to give assistance). Even if the English meaning exists as well (as in faire le coup de main), it is old-fashioned.\n\ncoup d'état (pl. coups d'état)\n\na sudden change in government by force; literally \"hit (blow) of state.\" French uses the capital É, because the use of a capital letter alters the meaning of the word (État: a State, as in a country; état: a state of being). It also cannot be shortened as coup as is often the case in English- because this literally means a \"hit\" in French, but can be used figuratively to mean many more things.\n\ndébut\n\nfirst public performance of an entertainment personality or group. In French, it means \"beginning.\" The English meaning of the word exists only when in the plural form: [faire] ses débuts [sur scène] (to make one's débuts on the stage). The English meaning and usage also extends to sports to denote a player who is making their first appearance for a team or at an event.\n\ndécolletage\n\na low-cut neckline, cleavage. In French it means: 1. action of lowering a female garment's neckline; 2. Agric.: cutting leaves from some cultivated roots such as beets, carrots, etc.; 3. Tech. Operation consisting of making screws, bolts, etc. one after another out of a single bar of metal on a parallel lathe. A low-cut neckline, or its shape, would in French be called un décolleté (noun and adjective): un décolleté profond, a deep décolletage; une robe très décolletée, a dress with very low neckline.\n\ndémarche\n\na decisive step. In French, it means a preparing step (often used in the plural form), a specific set of steps to get a specific result (can be used in the singular form, sometimes the expression \"marche à suivre\" (lit. \"step to follow\") will be preferred), or a distinctive way of walking.\n\ndépanneur\n\na neighbourhood general/convenience store, term used in eastern Canada (often shortened to dép or dep). This term is commonly used in Canadian French; however, in France, it means a repairman or tow truck operator. In France, a convenience store would be a supérette or épicerie [de quartier].\n\némigré\n\none who has emigrated for political reasons. French also use the word exilé (exiled) or réfugié (refugee) or even \"exilé politique\" or \"réfugié politique\".\n\nencore\n\nA request to repeat a performance, as in Encore!, lit. 'again'; also used to describe additional songs played at the end of a gig. Francophones would say « Une autre ! » ('Another one!') or «Bis !» to request « un rappel » or « un bis ».\n\nen masse\n\nin a mass or group, all together. In French, masse refers only to a physical mass, whether for people or objects. It cannot be used for something immaterial, like, for example, the voice: \"they all together said 'get out'\" would be translated as ils ont dit 'dehors' en chœur ([like a chorus]). Also, en masse refers to numerous people or objects (a crowd or a mountain of things). In colloquial Québécois French, it means \"a bunch\" (as in il y avait du monde en masse, \"there was a bunch of people\").\n\nen suite\n\nas a set (not to be confused with ensuite, meaning \"then\"). Can refer, in particular, to hotel rooms with attached private bathroom, especially in Britain where hotels without private facilities are more common than in North America. In French, suite, when in the context of a hotel, already means several rooms following each other. J'ai loué une suite au Ritz would be translated as \"I rented a suite at the Ritz.\" En suite is not grammatically incorrect in French, but it is not an expression in itself and it is not used. Also used in British English to denote a bathroom that is accessible directly from the master bedroom of a house (usually with a connecting door), rather than by a separate entrance.\n\nentrée\n\nlit. \"entrance\"; in French, the first dish that starts a meal, i.e. the entrance to the meal. It can refer to a set of bites or small snacks, or a small dish served before a main course. The main dish or \"plat de résistance\" comes after the entrée. In American English, the meaning has migrated to \"main dish\". In other varieties of English it maintains its French meaning.\n\népée\n\na fencing weapon descended from the duelling sword. In French, apart from fencing (the sport) the term is more generic: it means sword.\n\nescritoire\n\na writing table. It is spelt écritoire in modern French.\n\nexposé\n\na published exposure of a fraud or scandal (past participle of \"to expose\"); in French refers to a talk or a report on any kind of subject.\n\nfemme\n\na stereotypically effeminate gay man or lesbian (slang, pronounced as written). In French, femme (pronounced 'fam') means \"woman.\"\n\nfin de siècle\n\ncomparable to (but not exactly the same as) turn-of-the-century but with a connotation of decadence, usually applied to the period from 1890 through 1910. In French, it means \"end of the century\", but it isn't a recognized expression as such. The French expression \"ambiance [de] fin de règne\" (lit. \"end-of-reign atmosphere\") also has a light connotation of boredom and decadence.\n\nforte\n\na strength, a strong point, typically of a person, from the French fort(e) (strong) and/or Italian forte (strong, esp. \"loud\" in music) and/or Latin forte (neuter form of fortis, strong). French uses fort(e) for both people and objects.\n\nAccording to Merriam Webster Dictionary, \"In forte we have a word derived from French that in its \"strong point\" sense has no entirely satisfactory pronunciation. Usage writers have denigrated \\'for-\"tA\\ and \\'for-tE\\ because they reflect the influence of the Italian-derived forte. Their recommended pronunciation \\'fort\\, however, does not exactly reflect French either: the French would write the word le fort and would rhyme it with English for [French doesn't pronounce the final \"t\"]. All are standard, however. In British English \\'fo-\"tA\\ and \\'fot\\ predominate; \\'for-\"tA\\ and \\for-'tA\\ are probably the most frequent pronunciations in American English.\"\n\nThe New Oxford Dictionary of English derives it from fencing. In French, le fort d'une épée is the third of a blade nearer the hilt, the strongest part of the sword used for parrying.\n\nhors d'oeuvres\n\nterm used for the snacks served with drinks before a meal. Literally \"outside of the work\". The French use apéritif to refer to the time before a meal and the drinks consumed during that time, yet \"hors d'œuvre\" is a synonym of \"entrée\" in French and means the first dish that starts a meal. At home in family circles it means more specifically seasoned salads taken as a starter. In Québécois French, apéritif refers to the drink only, and hors-d'œuvre (usually plural) refers to a set of bites, while an entrée is a small dish (an entrée can be made as hors-d'œuvres, but not all of them are).\n\nlavatoire or lavatory\n\nA once commonly used British term for a toilet or water closet. Before the age of the internet, it was commonly believed, and widely taught in schools in Britain, that the word \"toilet\" was a rather vulgar corruption of the French word \"toilettes\" and that \"lavatory\" was the correct expression to use because it was much closer in meaning to the French the word it was derived from, \"lavatoire,\" which was supposed[citation needed] to mean \"to wash, or to clean, yourself.\" Actually, though the word lavatoire does exist in French, it never meant a toilet or a bathroom. The lavatoire was the holy stone upon which the bodies of ecclesiastics, priest and members of the clergy, were once washed after their deaths, in order to prepare them for the afterlife, for their journey to heaven.[citation needed]\n\nmarquee\n\nthe sign above a theater that tells you what is playing. From marquise, which means not only a marchioness but also an awning. Theater buildings are generally old and nowadays there is never such a sign above them; there is only the advertisement for the play (l'affiche). In English, means a temporary structure (often made of canvas or similar material) which is erected to host an event outdoors, especially in the UK, where such events can often be affected by weather conditions (pronounced mar-key).\n\nnostalgie de la boue\n\n\"yearning for the mud\"; attraction to what is unworthy, crude or degrading.[63] Though grammatically correct, it is not used in French.\n\nobjet trouvé\n\nan ordinary object, such as a piece of driftwood, a shell, or a manufactured article, that is treated as an objet d'art because it is aesthetically pleasing.[64] In French, les objets trouvés, short for le bureau des objets trouvés, means the lost-and-found, the lost property.\n\noutré\n\nout of the ordinary, unusual. In French, it means outraged (for a person) or exaggerated, extravagant, overdone (for a thing, esp. a praise, an actor's style of acting, etc.); in that second meaning, belongs to \"literary\" style.\n\npassé\n\nout of fashion. The correct expression in French is passé de mode. Passé means past, passed, or (for a colour) faded.\n\npeignoir\n\na woman's dressing gown. It means bathrobe. In French, both peignoir and robe de chambre are used interchangeably for a dressing gown regardless of sex, though the latter is generally considered formal and the former is generally seen as colloquial. A bathrobe (for either sex, in absorbent material) is un peignoir de bain.\n\npièce d'occasion\n\n\"occasional piece\"; item written or composed for a special occasion. In French, it means \"second-hand hardware.\" Can be shortened as pièce d'occas' or even occas' (pronounced /okaz/).\n\nportmanteau (pl. portmanteaux)\n\nIn English, a portmanteau is a large piece of luggage for clothes that opens (like a book or a diptych) into two parts. From this literal sense, Lewis Carroll, in his novel Through the Looking Glass, playfully coined a further figurative sense for portmanteau: a word that fuses two or more words or parts of words to give a combined meaning. (For example, \"Brexit\" or \"emoticon\"). In French, portemanteau (lit. \"carry-coat\") was originally a person who carried the royal coat or dress train; now a large suitcase; more often, a clothes hanger. The equivalent of the English portmanteau word is un mot-valise (lit. \"word-suitcase\").\n\npotpourri\n\nmedley, mixture; French write it pot-pourri, literally 'rotten pot': primarily a pot in which different kinds of flowers or spices are put to dry for years for the scent.\n\nprécis\n\na concise summary. In French, when talking about a school course, it means an abridged book about the matter. Literally, précis means precise, accurate.\n\npremière\n\nrefers to the first performance of a play, a film, etc. \"La première\" is used in same way in French, but it more generally means \"the first\".\n\nraisonneur\n\na type of author intrusion in which a writer inserts a character to argue the author's viewpoint; alter ego, sometimes called 'author avatar'. In French, a raisonneur is a character in a play who stands for morality and reason, i.e., not necessarily the author's point of view. The first meaning of this word though is a man (fem. raisonneuse) who overdoes reasonings, who tires by objecting with numerous arguments to every order.\n\nrecherché\n\nlit. searched; obscure; pretentious. In French, means 'sophisticated' or 'delicate', or simply 'studied', without the negative connotations of the English.\n\nrendezvous\n\nlit. \"present yourself\" or \"proceed to\"; a meeting, appointment, or date in French. In English, it generally endorses a mysterious overtone and refers to a one-on-one meeting with someone for another purpose than a date. Always hyphenated in French: rendez-vous. Its only accepted abbreviation in French is RDV.\n\nreprise\n\nrepetition of previous music in a suite, programme, etc. and also applied to an actor who resumes a role that they have played previously. In French, it may mean an alternate version of a piece of music, or a cover version, or the rebroadcast of a show, piece or movie that was originally broadcast a while ago (although the term rediffusion is generally preferred, especially when talking about something on television). To express the repetition of a previous musical theme, French would exclusively use the Italian term coda.\n\nrésumé\n\nin North American English, a document listing one's qualifications for employment. In French, it means summary; French speakers would use instead curriculum vitæ, or its abbreviation, C.V. (like most other English speakers).\n\nrisqué (also risque)\n\nsexually suggestive; in French, the meaning of risqué is \"risky\", with no sexual connotation. Francophones use instead osé (lit. \"daring\") or sometimes dévergondé (very formal language). Osé, unlike dévergondé, cannot be used for people themselves, only for things (such as pictures) or attitudes.\n\nrouge (lit. \"red\")\n\n1) a rouge is red makeup, also called blusher. Rouge à lèvres is French for \"lipstick\", even if the lipstick is not red at all. The French equivalent to the English meaning is \"fard à joues\"; 2) in Canadian football, a rouge is awarded when the ball is kicked into the end zone by any legal means, other than a successful field goal, and the receiving team does not return or kick the ball out of its end zone.\n\nséance\n\na gathering, usually using a 'medium', attempting to communicate with the dead. In French, the word means 'sitting' and usually refers to any kind of meeting or session.\n\ntable d'hôte (pl. tables d'hôte)\n\nin English, when used it usually refers to type of meal: a full-course meal offered at a fixed price. However, in French, it refers to a type of lodging: the closest English equivalent would be \"a bed & breakfast\" or \"B&B.\" The origin of the meaning (for French speakers) is that at a table d'hôte (literally \"table of the house\" or \"table of the host\"), unlike at a full-service purpose-built hotel, all patrons eat together at the host's table, whatever the family have prepared for themselves (typically traditional regional dishes). Indeed, in France today a lodging labeled \"table d'hôte\" might perhaps not even offer food; the appellation meaning what an English-speaker would think of as a \"bed & breakfast -style\" family-home lodging (as opposed to a purpose-built hotel). In Quebec, table d'hôte generally has the same meaning as in English, the expression couette et café (lit. \"duvet and coffee\") is generally used to talk about B&B style accommodations, where the English expression is not used.\n\ntableau vivant (pl. tableaux vivants, often shortened as tableau)\n\nin drama, a scene where actors remain motionless as if in a picture.

In French, used for \"emotionally touched\".\n\nvignette\n\na brief description; a short scene. In French, it is a small picture or a thumbnail.

In Canada, it may also refer to the honorary position a person holds as a personal assistant to a high civil servant. It exists in French too but is written aide de camp (without any hyphens).\n\napprise\n\n\"to inform\"; used to substitute the verb to inform when the information is crucial.

In French, the exact expression is cri du cœur.\n\ndemi-monde\n\na class of women of ill repute; a fringe group or subculture. Fell out of use in the French language in the 19th century. Frenchmen still use une demi-mondaine to qualify a woman that lives (exclusively or partially) off the commerce of her charms but in a high-life style.\n\ndouble entendre\n\na figure of speech wherein a word or phrases can be taken to have two distinct coherent meanings, most often in a fashion that is suggestive and/or ironic. \"Entendre\" is an infinitive verb (\"to hear\"), not a noun; a correct rendering would be \"à double entente\", an adjectival phrase meaning \"of a double understanding or double interpretation\" (literally, \"with a double hearing\"). The modern French phrase is \"à double sens\".\n\nin lieu (of)\n\n\"in place (of)\"; partially translated from the existing French phrase au lieu (de).\n\nléger de main (legerdemain)\n\n\"light of hand\": sleight of hand, usually in the context of deception or the art of stage magic tricks. Meaningless in French; the equivalent is un tour de passe-passe.\n\nmaître d'\n\ntranslates literally as master o'. The French term for head waiter (the manager of the service side of a restaurant) is maître d'hôtel (literally \"master of the house\" or \"master of the establishment\"); French never uses \"d'\" stand-alone. Most often used in American English and its usage in the UK is rare.\n\nnegligée\n\nA robe or a dressing gown, usually of sheer or soft fabric for women, or a nightdress. As with lingerie, the usage of the word suggests the garment is alluring or fancy. French uses négligé (masculine form) or nuisette. In French, the word négligée qualifies a woman who neglects her appearance.\n\nsuccès de scandale\n\n\"Success through scandal\"; Francophones might use succès par médisance.\n\nvoir dire\n\na trial within a trial, or (in America) jury selection (Law French).

In England and Wales, the expression is used to refer to a \"trial within a trial\", during which a judge hears evidence in the absence of the jury, typically to decide whether a certain piece of evidence should be allowed to be presented to the jury or not. For example, a judge might hold a \"voir dire\" to determine whether a confession has been extracted from a defendant by an unfair inducement in order to decide whether the jury should hear evidence of the confession or not.\n\nInternational authorities have adopted a number of words and phrases from French for use by speakers of all languages in voice communications during air-sea rescues.
