        "text": "Truffaut's cinema is made of love, in all its possible meanings, and precisely for this reason it requires, in order to be appreciated, that the spectator approaches it with an attitude that is able first of all to grasp the emotional range of the images: as if it were necessary to treat the film with the same love with which it was conceived. But love is, at the same time, the main theme, the central focus, the most intimate and authentic inspiration of Truffaut's films. It is a feeling that involves all dimensions, from family to social, from romantic to sexual. This Dossier takes a close look at the director’s filmography, investigating its three main dimensions: after a General introduction (Part 1), we deal with the ways Truffaut has filmed childhood and adolescence (Part 2), the Antoine Doinel “cycle” (the mythical character from his first feature film, The 400 blows)(Part 3), and finally the sentimental “triangles” and the love obsessions, with such masterpieces as Jules and Jim and The woman next door (Part 4). The four parts are all available at Academia.edu and at www.cinemafocus.eu\n\nWithin the strategies built upon the intentional weakening of the diegetic efficiency a group apart is formed by those films which try to reach this gesture of destruction by resorting to the diegetically weaker, in this sense pre-discursive way of expression of the silent cinema. In this paper the author analyze two films from this perspective: Guy Maddin’s Careful (1992) and Esteban Sapir’s La Antena (2007). The plot of these films coupled with the effect achieved by the mimicry of the silent film challenges interpretation. What are the discursive functions in the contemporary cinema of the silent film-like formal principles and techniques weakening the diegetic effect, such as the absence of the synchronized sound and the use of the intertitles in the film? The hypothesis is, that the turning to the visual style of the silent film is associated with the problematization of the medial relationship between image and text, image and voice respectively, and is manifested both at the level of the fable and in the use of the filmic techniques.\n\nFor psychoanalytic theory, the object of the cinema has always been the gaze. The importance of the gaze as the impossible object around which films are constructed is impossible to question. However, this essay contends that we should consider the importance of the voice as a possible object of a particular type of cinema. We should think of these two objects, the voice and the gaze, as having a historical relationship with each other. The contention here is that while the gaze is the object of the sound film, the voice is the object of the silent film. The absence of voices in silent cinema provides the perfect form for depicting the voice as an absent object. Once characters actually begin to speak on the screen, however, their voices obscure the voice as an absent object, and the result is that the gaze becomes the central cinematic object and preoccupation.\n\n1 There is a distinct similarity between François Truffaut’s celebrated 1954 massacre of conventional screenwriters, “A Certain Tendency in French Cinema,” and an account published some two centuries earlier of a ritual massacre of noisy cats by a group of irate printers’ apprentices. The latter incident would not even be worthy of our attention had it not engaged the distinguished historians Robert Darnton and Roger Chartier in a debate as to whether any historically-situated way of thinking could be taken to prove that “Frenchness exists.” 1 While I share Chartier’s methodological skepticism, I would like to advance a mildly contrarian argument that the intersection of distinctive characteristics that inhered to the kinds of filmmaking I treat ― filmmaking that had an intensely medium-specific, anti-hegemonic, culturally inclusive, even vaguely incestuous character ― could be nothing but French in terms of cultural configuration and geographical specificity. 2\n\nTruffaut's cinema is made of love, in all its possible meanings, and precisely for this reason it requires, in order to be appreciated, that the spectator approaches it with an attitude that is able first of all to grasp the emotional range of the images: as if it were necessary to treat the film with the same love with which it was conceived. But love is, at the same time, the main theme, the central focus, the most intimate and authentic inspiration of Truffaut's films.

Specifically, Godard investigates the rules by which artifacts are combined—a practice he identifies with montage, and which he describes variously as a form of mathematical sequencing and an exercise of the self."
