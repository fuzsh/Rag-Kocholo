        "text": "Classical reconstructions of the history of film theories have allowed very little room, if any, for women’s discursive contribution to the investigation on cinema. From the beginning, film theory has been perceived as an intellectual practice basically reserved to men – that is, an homosocial discursive sphere. With the emergence, from the late Nineties, of a second, international wave of historically oriented feminist film studies, a new attention to the traces of female agency in all fields of film culture and production of the early decades has brought to light what already appears to be an impressive amount of evidence that women’s contribution to the film industry did not restrict itself neither to the sphere of acting nor to minor professional roles – like that, for instance, of the continuity girl – but embraced instead all the diverse creative, managerial, technical and cultural functions that are involved in the institution of cinema as a whole. All around the world women were directors, screenwriters, producers, distributors, editors, theatrical managers and sometimes even camera operators. Moreover, as Antonia Lant and Ingrid Perez have widely documented in their seminal *The Red Velvet Seat* anthology, they wrote articles and reviews, essays, declarations of poetics. Some of them had regular film columns in different kinds of periodicals, others even wrote entire volumes quite rich in scholarly research. Yet, with just a few exceptions, the names of these women still remain mostly unknown. For instance, how many of us would be able to link the once famous name of Georgette Leblanc to what undoubtedly appears to be one of the most interesting and engaging essays on cinema issued in France during the 1910s? The present article is an attempt to recover and appreciate Leblanc’s unjustly forgotten text, published in 1919 on the pages of a prestigious journal like Le \"Mercure de France\" and never reprinted ever since, remaining mysteriously unnoticed both in the frame of the contemporary French debate on film, and in subsequent reconstructions of the history of film theories.\n\nThe present article aims to show how the consolidation of the cinematic form of the essay film in Jean-Luc Godard’s work is a consequence of the evolution of his experience in the cinéma militant. This militant cinema emerges from the political and social circumstances that caused May 68 and in the case of the filmmaker is materialized through his participation in the Dziga Vertov Group. The defining elements of the group’s filmic experience –the supremacy of montage, the dialectics between images and sounds and the relevance of the spectator as an active part of a dialogical practice– are the same that bring about the essayistic form when the film is enunciated from the author’s subjectivity. With the analysis of Letter to Jane this paper tries to demonstrate how the irruption of subjectivity in the revolutionary cinematic practice allows the appearance of self-reflexivity and the thinking process that define the cinematic essay. RESUMEN El presente artículo pretende mostrar cómo la consolidación de la forma cinematográfica del film-ensayo en la obra de Jean-Luc Godard es consecuencia de la evolución de su experiencia en el cinéma militant. Un cine militante que surge de las circunstancias político-sociales que dieron lugar a mayo del 68 y que en el caso del cineasta se materializa mediante su participación en el Grupo Dziga Vertov. Los elementos definitorios de la experiencia fílmica del grupo –la primacía del montaje, la dialéctica entre imágenes y sonidos y la relevancia del espectador como parte activa de una práctica dialogística– son los mismos que propician la forma ensayística cuando la obra se enuncia desde la subjetividad del autor. Con el análisis de Letter to Jane pretendemos mostrar cómo la irrupción de la subjetividad en la práctica cinematográfica revolucionaria posibilita la aparición de la auto-reflexión y del proceso de pensamiento definitorios del ensayo cinematográfico.\n\nBased on the analysis of film studies concepts (in the context of the socio-cultural and political situation, etc.) of the first decade of the existence of the journal Cinema Art (1931–1941), the authors came to the conclusion that theoretical works on cinematographic topics during this period can be divided into the following types: - ideologized articles by Association of Revolutionary Cinematographers activists (1931–1932), emphasizing the dominance of \"truly revolutionary proletarian cinema\" and an uncompromising struggle with the views of any opponents; - ideologically reoriented articles (1932–1934), written as a positive reaction to the Resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (of Bolsheviks) “On the restructuring of literary and artistic organizations” (1932), many provisions of which (in particular, a clear indication that that the framework of the proletarian literary and artistic organizations) have become a direct threat to the existence of the Association of Revolutionary Cinematographers; in articles of this kind, activists of the Association of Revolutionary Cinematographers — until the liquidation of this organization in early 1935 – tried to prove their necessity and loyalty to the “general line of the Communist party”; - Articles containing sharp criticism of \"groupism\" (including among the Association of Revolutionary Cinematographers), \"enemies of the people\", etc. (1935–1938); - theoretical articles attacking various types of formalistic phenomena (primarily in the field of montage) in cinema and culture (1931–1941); - theoretical articles opposing empiricism, \"documentaryism\", naturalism and physiology, vulgar materialism, aestheticism, \"emotionalism\" on the basis of Marxist-Leninist ideological and class approaches (1931–1941); - theoretical articles defending the principles of socialist realism in cinema (1933–1941); - theoretical articles criticizing bourgeois film theories and Western influence on Soviet cinema (1931–1941); - theoretical articles aimed primarily at professional problems of mastering sound in cinema (in particular, the dramaturgy of sound, music), editing, image, film image, film language (for example, the cinematic possibilities of the “zeit-loop” effect), cinema style, genre, entertainment, construction script (plot, composition, conflict, typology of characters, typology of comic devices, etc.), acting, etc. (1931–1941); - theoretical articles balancing between ideology and professional approaches to the creation of cinematic works of art (1931–1941).\n\nIn 1931 USA critic Harry Allan Potamkin published a manifesto titled “A Movie Call To Action!”, in which he encouraged film critics to educate and serve the workers, calling for the creation of a “Film Action Federation”. Its ultimate goal was to mobilize cinema beyond commercial purposes, envisioning a pedagogical role that would educate spectators in social justice and political action. His arguments and concrete proposals are strikingly similar to those of critic Léon Mousinnac (France), who only a few months before had announced the creation of a “Cine-Photo Worker Federation” / “Fédération Ouvrière de Ciné-Photo” in Paris. Two years later, critic Juan Piqueras (Spain) would publish a very similar manifesto titled “Towards a Spanish Federation of Proletarian Film-clubs” / “Hacia una Federación de Cineclubs Proletarios”, echoing Potamkin’s and Moussinac’s arguments. They all mentioned the need to guarantee the distribution of proletarian films, the importance of educating class-conscious spectators, and the beneficial effects such initiatives would have towards the creation of an international proletarian cinema. In this paper, I show how such leftist cinematic front expanded its influence during the 1930s, envisioning an alternative to commercial film culture through active radical film pedagogy, both on a local and international level, creating an informal network of transnational radical film culture. When put together, these materials make apparent that, in Scott Mckenzie’s words, film history can be described as an indirect conversation “in which so many filmmakers, critics, theorists, archivists, activists, and historians have deployed cinema as a means to reconfigure the world”."
