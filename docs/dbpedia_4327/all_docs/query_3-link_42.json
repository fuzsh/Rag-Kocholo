        "text": "Ferdinand Foch\n\nmarshal of France\n\nFerdinand Foch (born October 2, 1851, Tarbes, France—died March 20, 1929, Paris) was a marshal of France and commander of Allied forces during the closing months of World War I, generally considered the leader most responsible for the Allied victory.\n\nEarly years\n\nFoch was the son of a civil servant. His family had originally lived in Valentine, a village in the Comminges area to which he used to return every year. As a young child, he was inspired by the stories of the campaigns of his maternal grandfather, who had been an officer during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, and by the age of six he was reading the descriptions of military battles he found in historical works.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nWorld War I Quiz\n\nIn 1869 he entered the Jesuit school of Saint-Clément in Metz in order to prepare for the entrance examination for the Polytechnic School. In Metz the experience of France’s defeat in the Franco-German War left an indelible impression on him. When he passed his examinations in July 1870, the war had already broken out. Once back home, he enlisted in the army but did not take part in the fighting. In 1871, after the armistice, when he returned to Saint-Clément, he was forced to live alongside the German soldiers who were there. Metz had become a German city. His pain and anger made him resolve to become a soldier and return Metz and the Lorraine region to France.\n\nRise in the military hierarchy\n\nAfter two years at the Polytechnic School in Paris, Foch entered artillery training school (1873). As an artillery officer, he proved himself to be both an ardent cavalryman and an experienced technician. After appointment to the Artillery Committee in Paris, he was married (1883) and acquired the château of Trofeunteuniou in Brittany, which then became his second family home.\n\nIn 1885 he entered the War College for the first of three periods there over the next 25 years. He returned as a major in 1895 to teach general tactics, soon becoming a full professor. In 1908, when he was a brigadier general, Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau appointed him head of the school. Foch in the meantime also had held commands and served on various staffs, thus adding to his experience and judgment. He formulated his doctrine of action in two works: Des principes de la guerre (1903; The Principles of War) and De la conduite de la guerre (1904; “On the Conduct of War”). “Thought” and “will” were the key words of these teachings.\n\nAfter commanding a division in 1911 and briefly commanding an army corps, he was, in August 1913, put in command of the XX Army Corps in Nancy, which protected the Lorraine frontier. It seemed to be the crowning point of Foch’s career because he would reach retirement age in three years.\n\nUnder Joffre in World War I\n\nWhen war broke out on August 2, 1914, Foch first fought on the right flank, in Lorraine. On August 28 a dangerous gap appeared in the centre, and the commander in chief, Joseph Joffre, called Foch to command the army detachment—which later became the IX Army—that was being formed there. The enemy tried to break through, but Foch held on. His tenacity made it possible for Joffre to win at the First Battle of the Marne. The same was true at the battles of the Yser and of Ypres, where he had been sent by Joffre to coordinate the efforts of the English, the French, and the Belgians, who were being severely attacked.\n\nFor two thankless years—1915 and 1916—Foch, commanding the Northern Army Group, vainly tried to break through the German line in Artois and at the Somme, but he could not compensate for the lack of equipment and supplies. In May 1917 he was appointed chief of the war minister’s general staff, a position that made him adviser to the Allied armies. But advising was not commanding. Russia was about to collapse, thus allowing Germany to bring all its forces back to the Western Front, where the Belgians, English, and French were lined up under separate commands. Foch predicted that when the Germans struck this poorly consolidated front, each force would think only of its own fate, and that the front would be broken up. He advocated establishing a single command, but the British prime minister David Lloyd George and Clemenceau (again appointed premier in November) refused to listen to Foch.\n\nEvents, however, were to prove Foch right. On March 21, 1918, the British front in Picardy collapsed under the impact of the German attack. By March 24, British commander Field Marshal Douglas Haig was thinking about his embarkation ports, and French commander General Philippe Pétain was thinking about Paris. The severance of the two armies had begun. The Germans, who quickly perceived the situation, were already crying victory.\n\nCommander of the Allied armies\n\nLloyd George and Clemenceau realized that Foch was the only person who could fill the void. By early May, Foch had been made commander in chief of all Allied armies on the Western and Italian fronts. The battle of two wills began: Erich Ludendorff, who was in virtual command of the German forces, versus Foch. Ludendorff, who had the initiative and superiority in numbers, redoubled his attacks. Foch resorted to parrying while waiting for the arrival of the American armies. He urged his men on to the limits of their endurance and succeeded in stopping Ludendorff in Picardy and then in Flanders. But, in order to support the English, who were being pushed back to the sea by Ludendorff, Foch withdrew troops from the French front. Ludendorff took advantage of this. On May 27 he broke through that front, and his troops spread as far as the Marne. On June 9 a new gap appeared at the Oise. Foch stopped it up again. Ludendorff then decided to gamble everything he had before the Americans joined the battle. On July 15 he made a massive attack in Champagne. Two days later he was stopped; he had lost.\n\nIt was now Foch’s turn to strike. In two offensives on July 18 and on August 8, Foch drove Ludendorff back to a defensive position. The honour of marshal of France was conferred on Foch on August 6, just as he was intensifying his offensive on the Germans, giving no respite to the enemy nor to his own troops. Finally, the German army, already exhausted and dwindling in numbers, was threatened with disintegration by the revolution in Germany and was abandoned by its allies. Germany was forced to ask for an armistice, the conditions of which were dictated by Marshal Foch in the name of the Allies on November 11, 1918, at Rethondes. On November 26 Foch returned to Metz, having succeeded in his lifelong goal of giving Alsace and Lorraine back to France.\n\nAfter the war Foch was showered with honours, including being made marshal of Great Britain and of Poland. He was buried near Napoleon under the dome of the Church of Saint-Louis, in the Invalides in Paris.\n\nCharles-André Laffargue The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
