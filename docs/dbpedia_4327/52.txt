Claus von B端low, the Danish-born man-about-society who in two trials was convicted and later acquitted of twice trying to murder his heiress wife, placing him at the center of one of the most sensational social dramas of the 1980s, died on Saturday at his home in London. He was 92.

His death was confirmed on Thursday by Riccardo Pavoncelli, his son-in-law.

Mr. von B端low was charged with the attempted murder of his wife, Martha von B端low, known as Sunny, by injecting her with insulin to aggravate her hypoglycemia, a low-blood-sugar condition. Mrs. von B端low, the heiress to a $75 million utilities fortune, went into a coma in December 1979, from which she recovered, and a second, irreversible coma in December 1980. She remained in a vegetative state until her death in 2008.
