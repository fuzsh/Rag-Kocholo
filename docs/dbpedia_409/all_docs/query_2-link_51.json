        "text": "BEIJING — Coming into these 2015 track and field world championships, it looked for — and to — all the world like this could be the meet when the American team finally reached that elusive 30-total medal count.\n\nWith the meet now at its (just-past) halfway point, that looks exceedingly unlikely. The question now is more fundamental: is this 2015 performance a blip or a precursor for next year’s Rio 2016 Summer Games and, indeed, beyond?\n\nComing into Wednesday, four nights into the nine-day meet, the United States had exactly as many golds as Canada: one.\n\nThe American Joe Kovacs won the men’s shot put; the Canadian Shawn Barber, the men’s pole vault.\n\nAfter Wednesday, the United States still had -- one.\n\nThe Brits? Three. The Americans' new political friends in Cuba? Two.\n\nOverall, Kenya led the medal count, with 11, six gold; the Americans were next, with nine (that one gold, three silver, five bronze).\n\nKenya is not just marathoners anymore. Julius Yego won the men's javelin Wednesday night with the farthest throw in 14 years, 92.72 meters, or 304 feet, 2 inches.\n\nMeanwhile, the IAAF announced earlier in the evening that two Kenyans, Francisca Koki and Joyce Zakari, had tested positive after providing samples on August 20 and 21, respectively — that is, immediately before the meet started. These “targeted tests were conducted by the IAAF at the athlete hotels,” the federation said in a statement. No other details were immediately available.\n\nThe run-up to the 2015 championships has been marked by waves of media reports alleging doping positives and cover-ups in the Kenyan track and field scene.\n\nZakari had run second in her 400 heat in 50.71, then proved a no-show for the first of Tuesday’s three semifinals.\n\nKoki, in the 400 hurdles, ran 58.96 in her opening round, second-slowest in the entire field.\n\nFor the U.S. to prevail in the medals count next year at Rio, as it did in London 2012, with 103, China next at 88, the weight rests on its track and swim teams.\n\nIn London, the swim team won 30 medals at the pool, 31 including Haley Anderson’s silver in the open-water competition. The track team: 29.\n\nA few weeks ago at the 2015 world swim championships in Kazan, Russia, the U.S. team ended up with 23 medals, eight gold. That’s arguably misleading, though, because two of those medals came in the mixed relays, which would be new Olympic events. So: 21.\n\nOf course, Michael Phelps did not swim in Kazan and threw down three world-best performances that same week at the U.S. nationals. Even so, it was arguably the American team’s poorest performance at a worlds dating to 1973; in 1994, the Americans went home from Rome with 21 medals, four gold.\n\nFor the track team, expectations had soared before this meet in Beijing, the U.S. sending arguably its deepest team ever.\n\nTo be sure, the Americans have had some successes. In the women’s 10,000 meters, for example, U.S. runners went 3-4-6, Emily Infeld passing Molly Huddle at the line for the bronze, Shalane Flanagan taking sixth.\n\nShamier Little, with a bright green bow in her hair, and Cassandra Tate went 2-3 Wednesday night in the women's 400 hurdles. Zuzana Hejnova of the Czech Republic, the Moscow 2013 champion who had spent most of 2014 recovering from a broken bone in her left foot, dominated again in a 2015 world best 53.50. Little ran 53.94, Tate 54.02.\n\nThe final events Wednesday night, however, proved hugely emblematic of American performance:\n\nOnly one American, Justin Gatlin, had even made it through the heats to the semifinals of the men’s 200. He ran an easy 19.87 to move on to the finals, that 19.87 the second-fastest semifinal time ever at a worlds; Francis Obikwelu ran 19.84 in 1999.\n\nJustin Gatlin's 19.87 in the men's 200m semi tonight was the second-fastest semifinal time ever at the World Championships. The fastest: Nigeria's Francis Obikwelu's 19.84, in 1999.\n\nIn the next heat, Usain Bolt, who defeated Gatlin in the 100 Sunday night by one-hundredth of a second, ran a season-best 19.95, chatting with South Africa's Anaso Jobodwana in the next lane, second in 20.01, as they crossed the line.\n\nIn the women's pole vault, American Jenn Suhr, the 2012 Olympic champion, afforded a huge opportunity because Russia's Yelena Isinbayeva was not jumping (the all-time pole vault diva gave birth last June to a daughter), managed a tie for fourth, at 4.70 meters, or 15 feet, 5 inches -- along with another American, Sandi Morris, a rising college star, and Sweden's Angelica Bengtsson.\n\nCuba's Yarisley Silva won, with 4.90, or 16-0 3/4. Brazil's Fabiana Murer took second, at 4.85, 15-11. Greece's Nikoleta Kyriakopoulo got third, at 4.80, 15-9.\n\nSilva made three attempts at 5.01, 16-5, but did not clear. Isinbayeva holds the world record, 5.06, 16-7, set six years ago.\n\nEmma Coburn had been a medal hope in the women's 3000 steeplechase. She finished fifth, in 9:21.78. Hyvin Kiyeng Jepkemoi of -- where else? -- Kenya took gold, in 9:19.11. Habiba Shribi of Tunisia came second, 13-hundredths back, Gesa Felicitas Krause of Germany in a personal-best 9:19.25, 14-hundredths behind.\n\nThe men's 400 proved super-crazy fast.\n\nThe American LaShawn Merritt, the Moscow 2013 and Beijing 2008 Olympic champion, in Lane 8, went out hard early on the way to personal-best 43.65. He got second.\n\nSouth Africa's Wayde Van Niekerk ran 43.48, unequivocally the fastest time of 2015. Kirani James of Grenada got third, in a season-best 43.78, Luguelin Santos of the Dominican Republic fourth in a national-record 44.11.\n\nVan Niekerk's best before Wednesday had been more than a half-second slower, 43.96. His 43.48 makes him the fourth-fastest man ever at the distance: Michael Johnson (43.18), Butch Reynolds, Jeremy Wariner.\n\nThe second-, third- and fourth-place finishes? The fastest times for those positions ever at a worlds.\n\nVan Niekerk was taken off the track in a stretcher. His condition was not immediately available.\n\nMerritt's silver tied him with Carl Lewis as the most successful American man in worlds history, with 10 medals. He has five 4x400 relay medals (all gold, dating to 2005) and five in the open 400 (two gold, three silver).\n\nWatch out going forward, meantime, for Isaac Makwala of Botswana, fifth in 44.63.\n\nMakwala had shown up big-time in the semifinals, with the field’s top time, 44.11, and from the outside lane. With an electric-green sleeve on his right arm, he dropped after the finish line and gave the crowd five push-ups, a signal that the semis amounted to nothing more than a training run.\n\nFor literally decades, the 400 has been an American stronghold, dominated by the likes of Johnson, Reynolds, Wariner and Merritt. Indeed, aside from 2011 and 2001, an American athlete had won the 400 at every worlds dating to 1991.\n\nMerritt took second in 2011 when James announced his arrival on the world stage; Merritt was coming back that year from a doping ban, and he and James have since traded off titles, James winning in London in 2012, Merritt in Moscow in 2013.\n\nAny discussion of what this all means, if anything, must start with the acknowledgement that the rest of the world has gotten way better at events that Americans used to regularly be able to count on for production in the medals count.\n\nTo take another beyond the men’s 400, consider the men’s 400 hurdles:\n\nHelsinki 2005, for instance: two medals, gold and silver. Osaka 2007: one, gold. Berlin 2009, one, gold.\n\nDaegu 2011: zero, with Britain, Puerto Rico and South Africa 1-2-3, the best Americans sixth and seventh.\n\nMoscow 2013: one, a silver, Jehue Gordon of Trinidad & Tobago winning, Emir Bekric of Serbia taking third.\n\nBeijing 2015: Kenya-Russia-Bahamas went 1-2-3.\n\nThe Americans finished fourth (Kerron Clement, the 2007 and 2009 world champion who had spent 2014 battling injuries) and eighth (Michael Tinsley, the 2012 Olympic and 2013 worlds silver medalist, in 50.02, after crashing through the eighth hurdle).\n\nTwo Americans had put down the year’s best time before this meet, Bershawn Jackson, 48.09, and Johnny Dutch, 48.13. Neither made it to the final.\n\nFor emphasis: Kenya had won 45 gold medals at the worlds, dating to 1983, but none before Tuesday night had come in an event shorter than 800 meters.\n\nTuesday night’s winner: Kenya's Nicholas Bett, in a national record and 2015 world-leading time, 47.79. From Lane 9, again far on the outside.\n\n“I am happy to win this first 400-meter hurdles medal ever for Kenya,” Bett said afterward. “I am thankful.”\n\nRussia’s Denis Kudryavtsev, in 48.05, took one-hundredth off a national record that had stood for 17 years.\n\nJeffrey Gibson of the Bahamas ran a national record 48.17. That broke his own record, 48.37, which he had run in the semifinals.\n\n“I am looking forward to more races and more training for the Olympic season,” he said afterward.\n\nIt must be acknowledged, as the New York Times pointed out in a story after Tuesday's finals, that U.S. coaches are playing a significant role in the success of other nations, and in events, such as the long jump, where memories of American success — Carl Lewis, Mike Powell, Dwight Phillips — run long.\n\nIn Tuesday night’s long jump final, the gold (Britain’s Greg Rutherford) and silver (Australian Fabrice Lapierre) medals went to athletes who train near Phoenix with the American Dan Pfaff; the bronze, China’s first long jump medal at a worlds, went to Wang Jianan, who trains with the American Randy Huntington.\n\nThe top American? Jeff Henderson, the 2015 Pan Am Games champion, ninth, one spot out of the finals.\n\nBarber, the Canadian pole vault winner? He goes to college at the University of Akron.\n\nAs in any meet, injuries always play a role. The American 200-meter specialist Wallace Spearmon, for instance, scratched out of Tuesday’s heats upon reporting a small tear in his left calf muscle.\n\nBeyond all that, it’s track and field, and stuff happens. Alysia Montaño, one of the best American racers in the women’s 800, in contention for a top-three finish in Wednesday’s heats, fell on the second lap after a tangle. She ended up getting disqualified.\n\nIn Tuesday night’s women’s 1500, Jenny Simpson, the Daegu 2011 gold and Moscow 2013 silver medalist, lost a shoe. She finished 11th. Ethiopia’s Genzebe Dibaba, one of the sport’s brightest new stars, won in 4:08.09.\n\nHopes were high in the men’s steeplechase Monday night that, for the first time ever at a world championship, the Americans — specifically, Evan Jager — might win a medal. Jager led at the bell lap but finished sixth. The Kenyans went 1-2-3-4.\n\nHow, meanwhile, to explain the men’s triple jump?\n\nTwo Americans, Marquis Dendy and Will Claye, could not summon enough Wednesday morning to make the final.\n\nComing in, Dendy had the year’s fourth-best jump, Claye the fifth; Claye, moreover, is an incredibly versatile athlete who at the 2012 London Games became the first man since 1936 to win medals in both the long jump (silver) and the triple jump (bronze).\n\nWendy, afterward: “I can’t be too, too mad, but I am disappointed.”\n\nClaye: “I’m still in shock. I don’t even know what happened. It just wasn’t my day. That’s the only way I can see it. I went out there and gave it my all. It just wasn’t my day. I have to make my rules and get ready for next season.”\n\nMOSCOW -- The clock said it was a couple minutes past 10 in the evening. All the action on the track was over. The only matter left to be decided was at the pole vault, and there was only one jumper left. Yelena Isinbayeva had all of Luzhniki Stadium to herself. Just the way she likes it.\n\nThe greatest female pole vaulter in history, the first-ever in history to clear five meters, won the third world title of her incredible career, the only one in Tuesday's field to clear 4.89 meters, or 16 feet and exactly one-half of an inch.\n\nThe world record is 5.07, or 16-7 1/2. Isinbayeva made three tries as the clock ticked past 10. None were really close. No matter. The crowd came to see the Pole Vault Diva, Isinbayeva. They were thrilled, roaring at her every attempt, at what -- for the first time -- felt like a real world championships here at Luzhniki.\n\n\"I am so happy the era of Isinbayeva is back again,\" she said at a news conference that stretched into early Wednesday. \"It was never finished.\"\n\nPerhaps this is the last of Isinbayeva's world titles. Or not. She says now she is going to take what she called a \"small woman's break,\" intending to have a baby next year. She is due to be the honorary mayor of the athlete's village at the Sochi 2014 Winter Games and said she intends to be walking around -- she really said this -- like a \"pregnant penguin\" offering the world's skiers and skaters \"the traditional bread and salt\" like a good Russian host.\n\nThe world has never seen anyone quite like Yelena Isinbayeva. And the scene at the pole vault runway -- Isinbayeva's catwalk -- capped a fantastic night of track and field, one that saw the U.S. team win four medals: one gold, three silver.\n\nLaShawn Merritt simply blew away all comers, including London 2012 Olympic champion Kirani James, to win the men's 400 meters, in 43.74 seconds, 2013's best time. Fellow American Tony McQuay took silver, in a personal-best 44.40.\n\nLuguelin Santos of the Dominican Republic -- 19 years old -- finished third, in 44.52.\n\nJames? An improbable seventh, in 44.99.\n\nOn his way out, James told Universal Sports, \"I just died. I don't know what happened.\"\n\nFor Merritt, the 2008 Olympic champion, this marked redemption, and in a big way. He has overcome injury and the embarrassment of a ban relating to the purchase of a male-enhancement product at a convenience store and weathered it all with dignity. McQuay was far from alone when he said at a late Tuesday news conference that he considered Merritt a \"great role model.\"\n\nMerritt said winning Tuesday was a \"sweet moment.\" He also said, \"I guess you could call it a comeback. But I don't feel like I ever left. I always continued to work hard and keep faith in my ability -- spiritually, physically and mentally. To come here … I was ready for it.\"\n\nIn the men's 800, Nick Symmonds took silver, in 1:43.55, the best-ever finish in the event by an American and the first medal for a U.S. man since Rich Kenah's bronze in 1997.\n\nEthiopia's Mohamed Aman won, in 1:43.31 -- the 2012 world indoor champ adding the 2013 outdoor title to his collection. He is just 19. Djibouti's Ayanleh Souleiman took third, in 1:43.76, the first medal for his country since Ahmed Salah won silver in the marathon at the Tokyo worlds in 1991. Souleiman is just 20.\n\nWell before anyone even got to Moscow, the 800 was going to be a wide-open affair. Not one of the three medalists from the 2012 Olympics was here. Gold medalist David Rudisha of Kenya, who set a world-record 1:40.91 in London, was hurt. So was silver medalist Nijel Amos of Botswana. Timothy Kitum didn't make the team Kenya sent to Moscow.\n\nNo one in the world had run under 1:43 this year.\n\nIn the heats and semifinals, astonishingly, all the Kenyans were eliminated. That meant that -- for the first time in the 30-year history of the world championships -- the men's 800 final would be Kenyan-free.\n\nSymmonds had finished fifth in London; fifth at the worlds in Daegu in 2011; sixth at the Berlin worlds in 2009. He is 29. He had blogged before coming here about how significant it would mean to him personally and professionally to leave Moscow with what he called a \"shiny medal\" around his neck.\n\nComing down the stretch, it looked like it might be gold. But with about 20 meters to go, Aman proved just too strong.\n\n\"Nothing is impossible,\" Aman said. \"You have to believe in yourself and train.\"\n\nEchoed Symmonds, \"To be a medalist takes a lot of hard work, it takes a lot of luck as well. A lot of experience. At the age of 29 ... it feels like all the hard work and the sacrifice has paid off.\"\n\nAll of that set the stage for the pole-vault drama.\n\nThere are three superb female pole-vaulters right now in the world. The American Jenn Suhr won Olympic gold, the Cuban Yarisley Silva silver in London. And then, of course, there is Isinbayeva -- the 2004 and 2008 Olympic champion who won bronze in London.\n\nIsinbayeva is also the 2005 and 2007 world champion. But in Berlin in 2009, she no-heighted. In Daegu in 2011, she took sixth.\n\nLast year in London, she was back to her old ways -- with that third. But for her, third is not -- well, first. And, as she acknowledged after the jumps were all over Tuesday, referring to the last few years, \"Sometimes I was desperate … sometimes I thought I should quit.\"\n\nWhen all three cleared 4.82, or 15-9 3/4, it marked the first time since 2007 that three women had cleared that height in the same competition. This was, in every way, world-class stuff.\n\nPlus, the crowd was totally into it. The runway and pit were set up in what, in an American stadium, would be a football end zone. The stadium was not filled -- not quite -- but attendance was, because of Isinbayeva, eminently decent. Plus, because of Luzhniki's overhanging roof, the crowd noise was loud, indeed.\n\nIsinbayeva would later say it was the best crowd support she had received. Ever.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, through a translator in Russian, \"that was the best-ever. It was my home crowd. I felt like I was at home. What can you say? Being at home helps you. If we had the Olympics in Moscow [instead of London], the results would be different.\n\n\"I've gotten support in other countries. But tonight I knew. Tonight, everyone was behind me. I felt all my emotions. I absorbed it. The support was just colossal.\"\n\nTo have the stadium all to herself? She smiled. In English, she said that was \"nice feelings.\"\n\nSuhr held the lead until she missed her first try at 4.89. Then the pressure was on.\n\nIsinbayeva cleared.\n\nGame over, pretty much -- though the other two women tried to clear, it was not their night.\n\nSuhr took silver, Silva bronze.\n\nSuhr called it a \"great competition,\" adding, \"If I was a spectator, that's exactly what I would want to see.\"\n\nShe also said, \"When I think of where pole vaulting was and where it is now, you have to thank Yelena for getting us there. making the spotlight, making it one of the premier events to watch. Look at today. Every event was over but everyone stayed to watch it. We have to thank her for really paving the road for that.\"\n\nPeople, the era of Isinbayeva is back again. For emphasis, it was never finished.\n\nDONETSK, Ukraine -- In his time, it was enough that Roger Bannister broke the four-minute mile. People cared, and a lot. Back then, track and field mattered. In their day, the likes of Edwin Moses, Carl Lewis, Florence Griffth-Joyner and Jackie Joyner-Kersee could just run fast and jump far. A great many people found track and field itself relevant and interesting.\n\nNow, track and field lives on the margins of professional sport, especially in the United States, except for one week every four years at the Summer Olympics, when it commands Super Bowl-like attention. As ratings and attendance figures at other times have demonstrated conclusively, it's not enough anymore to just to run and jump -- or even throw.\n\nSo when Kylie Hutson, a rising American pole vaulter, took her runs Saturday night here at the 23rd annual running of the \"Pole Vault Stars\" to the strains of LMFAO's \"Sexy and I Know It,\" playing to the crowd because she's sexy and she knows it -- hey, it was showtime.\n\nBrad Walker, the 2007 world champion, ran the runway to perhaps the one G-rated sentence in the song \"Move Bitch\" from Ludacris. The noise shook the roof. The crowd roared.\n\nTraditionalists may cringe. But this is the direction track and field inevitably has to move, a combination of sport and entertainment, if it wants to engage the paying public.\n\nThe Druzhba sports hall in Donetsk holds roughly 4,000. To get there, fans had to brave temperatures of minus-20 centigrade, or minus-4 Fahrenheit. The place was packed; at the start, the lines at the concession stands were three deep. The show went on for three hours, the vaulters going off on brown runways set off against a blue background, one of the guys, then one of the women, at the height of the action a vaulter going off every 90 seconds, all the time the music kicking. For three solid hours the Druzhba was an all-in track-and-field house party.\n\nGenerally, a standard-issue track meet comes off like an out-of-control circus. For the average fan, there's too much going on, all of it seemingly at one time. The genius of an event like Pole Vault Stars is that it's a break-out deal, pole-vaulting only; there aren't any competing distractions on a surrounding track; moreover, you don't have to be a track and field geek to understand what's going on.\n\nThat's what makes the concept so easily transferrable:\n\nWhy not lithe female high jumpers in Las Vegas? Studly male shot putters in downtown Manhattan? (On Wall Street?) Why not street races down Michigan Avenue in Chicago or Bourbon Street in New Orleans?\n\nIn England, they already hold a street race in Manchester. At the Diamond League meet in Zurich last September, the shot put events -- men's and women's -- were held in the entrance hall of the main train station.\n\nTrack and field has to think like this, out of the box, to get to the ultimate goal: to make the sport once again not only relevant and interesting to the average fan. That is, must-see. For American supporters, the aim has to be to pack a place like Cowboys Stadium -- with that big-screen TV -- by the 2020 or 2024 U.S. Olympic Trials, and one day to bring the world championships to the United States.\n\nIt can be done. Usain Bolt has shown that there is space in a crowded sports landscape for a single track and field personality.\n\nAt the same time, there is much to overcome.\n\nMoving beyond the sport's well-documented doping issues -- for decades, track and field has ceded the show to other sports.\n\nThe NBA, for instance, is Jack Nicholson and Spike Lee and, to invoke the legendary voice of Lawrence Tanter announcing the obvious between breaks at Staples Center, Laker Girls.\n\nName even one celebrity associated with recent editions of the U.S. Olympic track trials -- or, for that matter, the U.S. track and field season.\n\nStill waiting …\n\nDuring the Major League Baseball season, they put on sausage races at Miller Park in Milwaukee, and people care. No, really! They care so much that \"Famous Racing Sausages\" is trademarked.\n\nThe NFL, of course, offers up military flyovers and cheerleaders and, at the Super Bowl itself, the halftime rock-and-roll spectacle. Why wouldn't track and field want to be more like the NFL?\n\nOr, for that matter, the UFC?\n\nWho, a few years ago, had even heard of the UFC?\n\n\"Look at the UFC and what Dana White has done. He has marketed the hell out of his athletes,\" Walker said here late Saturday night. \"We have tremendous athletes. Nobody knows who any of us are.\"\n\nAdded Jeff Hartwig, the 1996 and 2008 Olympian who was in Donetsk representing Hutson, \"You can make the general public fall in love with you if you put money and time into it, and we,\" meaning track and field, \"don't do either.\"\n\nTrack and field's credibility as a would-be major sport is not just limited to the United States -- though it is there that it may be most on the line. As just one example: The Millrose Games moved out of Madison Square Garden. Meanwhile, a number of European indoor meets this winter disappeared, including the seeming fixture in Stuttgart.\n\nMind you -- this is an Olympic year.\n\n\"A lot of competitions are dead,\" said Germany's Björn Otto, who finished a strong second here.\n\nHe added at a news conference, referring to Pole Vault Stars, \"We need these competitions. It's promoting track and field as attractive for the world. And spectators can see that.\"\n\nThis meet began in 1990, started by Sergey Bubka, the 1988 Seoul Games pole-vault gold medalist who went to high school in Donetsk. \"For me,\" Bubka said, \"we must offer sport as a combination -- with excitement, sport as a show. It gives a different impact. When you do this, the people love it.\"\n\nBubka is now a vice-president of track and field's international governing body, the International Assn. of Athletics Federations, and is on a short list of those believed to be positioning themselves for the succession -- whenever it might occur -- of the elderly IAAF president, Lamine Diack. Bubka is also an International Olympic Committee member and president of the national Olympic committee of Ukraine.\n\nAsked if the pole-vault meet might be a play to advance his political interests, Bubka demurred. \"What kind of promotion for myself? I didn't need that. I dreamed to do well, to promote my city. It was Soviet times. It was my dream to give the people two to three hours of entertainment.\"\n\nWhich has shown staying power. Samsung has become the title sponsor. Coca-Cola and others are also in, their executives saying they were happy to be on board because the Donetsk event delivers a family friendly audience.\n\nBubka, meanwhile, is forever tinkering with the format: \"It's my baby and every year we try to do something different.\"\n\nThe show Saturday night featured mock-ups of both the Parthenon and Big Ben, tributes to the Olympic Games' Greek heritage and this summer's London Games, and a dance-number opening ceremony.\n\nIn all, 24 athletes took part, including the two Americans.\n\nThere were vaulters from Cuba, Brazil and all over Europe. Each of the vaulters got to choose his or her own music. Four picked the French artist David Guetta; in a sign of the opportunity just waiting there, virtually everyone else chose an American artist or a U.S.-based musical act, the choices ranging from Eminem to Rihanna to Jennifer Lopez.\n\nThis was a no-slouch field.\n\nRenaud Lavillenie of France, the 2009 and 2011 world championships bronze medalist, won the men's competition at 5.82 meters, or 19 feet, 1 inch. Otto, recovering from Achilles' injuries, made the same height but took second on count backs.\n\nGermany's Malte Mohr, the 2010 world indoor silver medalist, came in third.\n\nIn recent years, Russia's Yelena Isinbayeva, the Beijing 2008 gold medalist, had ruled the women's competition in Donetsk -- indeed, setting eight world records here from 2004 to 2009. She was a no-show this year, having jumped at a meet just three days before in Bydgoszcz, Poland -- going 4.68, or 15-4 1/4.\n\nThat opened it up for Jiřina Ptáčníková of the Czech Republic, fifth at the 2010 world indoors, who jumped 4.70, or 15-5, a personal-best and a national indoor record.\n\n\"I like music,\" she said afterward. \"It's special -- to have a track and field meeting set to music is special.\"\n\nCuba's Yarisley Silva, her silver navel piercing shaking with every step, took second, at 4.60, or 15-1, also a national record. Hanna Shelekh, a local, just 18, the third-place finisher at the Singapore 2010 Youth Games, took third Saturday, also at 4.60, a Ukrainian record.\n\nHutson finished fifth in the women's competition at 4.50, or 14-9; Walker, sixth in the men's field at 5.62, or 18-5 1/4.\n\n\"When you see its in person, you see how successful it can be,\" Walker said afterward, \"it clicks.\""
