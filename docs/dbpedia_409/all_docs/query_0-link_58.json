The top three finishers at the Trials for both men and women will make up the 2004 U.S. Olympic Team.\n\nOfficial practice will be held Monday, June 14 with competition beginning at 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday, June 15. After the first day of competition, the field will be eliminated to 16 men and 16 women, who will go on to compete in Round Robin matches on Wednesday on Thursday. Following competition on Thursday, the field will be cut down to eight men and eight women and the remaining archers will move on to Round Robin matches on Friday and Saturday. At the conclusion of the tournament on Saturday, points will be tabulated and the top three of the remaining eight men and women will make up the Olympic Team. One male alternate and one female alternate will also be selected.\n\nThe presentation of the Olympic Team will take place on the field following competition on Saturday.\n\nThe 2004 U.S. Olympic Men’s Archery team looks to be successful once again as three-time Olympian and top-ranked Butch Johnson (Woodstock, Conn.) and 2000 Olympian and second-ranked Vic Wunderle (Mason City, Ill.) will compete for Olympic berths at the Trials. Johnson is vying for his fourth consecutive Olympic Games appearance. He was a member of the 1992 Olympic Team in Barcelona, he won a team gold at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and won a team bronze at the 2000 Games in Sydney. Johnson is looking to not only make his fourth Olympic Team, but also to win an individual medal. Wunderle was the 2000 Individual Silver Medalist and Team Bronze Medalist. Both Wunderle and Johnson are top contenders for Athens.\n\nPrior Olympic Games success for the U.S. Men include medaling at every single Games except for Barcelona in 1992 since archery was re-instated as an Olympic Sport in 1972. The U.S. Team has captured a total of 13 medals since 1972 and currently holds the 2x27 finals total Olympic record of 502, set by Huish, Johnson and White at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. Korea will be the top threat in Athens, but the U.S. is a major contender for bringing home medals from their third consecutive Olympic Games.\n\nOn the women’s side, 2003 USA Archery Athlete of the Year and top-ranked Jennifer Nichols (Cheyenne, Wyo.) is the top prospect for the U.S. Women’s Olympic Team. Twenty-year-old Nichols is a 2003 Pan American Games double Gold Medalist, was a member of the 2003 World Championship Team and has had a very successful start to 2004 winning the National Indoor Championships, the Arizona Cup International and the Italian Grand Prix.\n\nNumber two ranked and 2000 Olympian Karen Scavotto (Enfield, Conn.) was only 17-years-old when she competed at the Games in Sydney, and at 21 is looking to make her second Olympic Team.\n\nWith Korea also the top threat to the women’s team, the U.S. is looking toward Athens to defeat the Koreans and bring home the first women’s Olympic medal since 1988.\n\nFor more information on the Olympic Trials and for complete results throughout the course of the tournament, please visit www.usarchery.org.\n\n(Photos © David Miller 2004)"
