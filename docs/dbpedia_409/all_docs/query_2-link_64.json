        "text": "NEWBERRY — Jake Kaminski was six years old when he first stole an envious glance at the tattoo during an archery tournament in California.\n\nColored blue, yellow, black, green and red, the five interlocking rings inked on five-time Olympian Butch Johnson’s ankle symbolized the prize awaiting Kaminski when he achieved his boyhood dream of representing his country as a competitive archer.\n\n“I wanted to have one,” said Kaminski, a silver medalist for the U.S. national team at the 2012 London games. “I thought it was cool. It’s great to be able to have the right to do it.”\n\nOn Sunday at the fourth annual Easton Foundation Gator Cup, Kaminski unveiled his own edgier version of the Olympic rings — tearing their way through mock shredded skin — in front of the event’s record turnout of 310 competitors.\n\nEn route to a bronze medal in the senior men’s recurve, the Gainesville resident’s completed work on his inner right bicep became visible each time Kaminski, 24, drew back for a volley.\n\n“I finally just got mine last week; I finally had time,” he said. “You can see the skin still peeling off of it in areas. It was definitely great.”\n\nWith spectators mere feet away from the competing archers, Kaminski said he was not surprised that the third qualifying event for placement on the U.S. national teams saw nearly a 40 percent spike in attendance. Last year’s Gator Cup at the Easton Newberry Sports Complex featured 190 participants in three age classifications over the four-day event.\n\nBrady Ellison, who won the gold medal in the senior men’s recurve after a one-shot playoff, attributed this year’s attendance growth to the accessibility of the sport’s athletes.\n\nEllison is the top-ranked archer in the U.S., but much like Kaminski, who moved to Gainesville in January, he practices at a facility open to the public in Chula Vista, Calif.\n\n“Any kid can come here and meet Jake,” Ellison said. “Any kid can come out to Chula Vista where I train and meet me. Not a lot of kids have the opportunity to meet Larry Fitzgerald. These kids can watch us win medals at the games, then come meet us somewhat easily.”\n\nFollowing the senior compound wins of Reo Wilde and Erika Jones, five-time U.S. Olympian Khatuna Lorig also scored a gold medal in the senior women’s recurve after finishing third at the Gator Cup last year.\n\nLorig, who notably gave archery lessons to actress Jennifer Lawrence for her role in “The Hunger Games,” said the sport’s exposure in recent films and books series has helped increase its popularity.\n\n“It’s everywhere, even overseas,” Lorig said. “Definitely the movies being out has helped archery. Thanks to Hollywood and thanks to all those writers who made those movies and used archery, now I guess archery is the cool sport.”\n\nAs one of the top eight competitors in her category, Lorig will advance along with Ellison and Kaminski to today’s Team Trials, where the archers again compete head-to-head in round-robin format in an attempt to qualify for the World Archery Championships held in Antalya, Turkey from Sept. 29 to Oct. 6."
