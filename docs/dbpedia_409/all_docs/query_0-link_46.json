        "text": "The Royal Company of Archers was the first organized group to be formed in England in 1676 with the aim of promoting the sport; in 1781, the Royal Toxophilite Society was established.\n\nThe Olympics featured archery from 1900 to 1920, after which it was dropped. During those times, Belgian athlete Hubert Van Innis was the top medalist, with ten, including six golds. The sport returned to the Olympics in 1972, but with the division of men's and women's events, which followed a further change of team events in 1988.\n\nThe World Archery Federation (WAF), formerly known as the International Archery Federation or Fédération Internationale de Tir à l'Arc (FITA), is liable for overseeing archery globally. Seven countries—France, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, Poland, the United States, Hungary, and Italy—formed the federation in September 1931 at Lwów, Poland (now Lviv, Ukraine).\n\nOver the years, the U.S.A. has won a combined 33 Olympic medals in Archery, with 14 gold medals, 10 silver medals and 9 bronze medals. Let us take a closer look at the victories of the U.S.A. in Olympic Archery.\n\nRead More : Olympic tickets\n\nThe Year-by-Year List of Olympic Medalists of Team USA in Archery\n\nTeam USA has won a total of 33 archery medals, including 14 gold.
