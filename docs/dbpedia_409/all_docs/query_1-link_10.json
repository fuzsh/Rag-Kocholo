        "text": "Rod White competed in archery at the 1996 and 2000 Olympic Games, winning two team medals, with a gold in 1996. After his 1996 appearance he started a professional outfitting and guiding career throughout Montana, New Mexico, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, and Minnesota. Primarily focusing on whitetail deer, he also guided for elk, mule deer, black bear, antelope, and mountain lion. White continued competing in archery and came back for the 2000 Olympics, but after Sydney switched to compound bow shooting, rather than the Olympic re-curve events.\n\nWhite’s outfitting and guiding businesses eventually became a specialized land management and habitat enhancement company. He managed over 8,000 acres in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Missouri, and Kansas.\n\nIn 2018 White was named Bowhunting and Event Coordinator for the National Field Archery Association (NFAA). The position had him focus on increasing the number of bowhunters in the country and working directly with clubs, state organizations, and retailers to promote bowhunting and increase its membership."
