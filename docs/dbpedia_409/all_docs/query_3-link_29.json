        "text": "23\" market is small, just a bit more than 27\" and a bit less than 25\" LH. Then, majority of customers for 23\" risers are children/beginners, so the average 23\" riser available is a cheap basic one. I'm handling the exports for Fiberbow, and can confirm their FB5.3 ( 23\" carbon, around 0.55 kg mass weight) is selling 1 to 9 to the FB 6.3 (25\" version, 0.65 kg). Probably percentage for cheap risers is much more than this.\n\nIn 1990 I have purchased an Hoyt TD5 (23\" version of TD4) and used it with long Hoyt C+ limbs for some years. It was a fantastic, soft a and stable combination I remember with pleasure. Only draw back, I could not see the sight in the window under 18 mt of distance, so in Field i had to countersight at short distancies. But nowdays 23\"+long limbs does not seem to be on fashion anymore.... and this limits a lot 23\"riser market\n\nMid-to late 1990's the short riser + long limbs combination was popular with men in the U.S. Rod White and Butch Johnson (perhaps Huish did too, but I cannot recall definitively) used that combination at the 1996 Olympics and many followed suit afterwards. The Radian, Avalon, Elan, and Aerotec were all produced in a 23\" version. PSE made a custom 23\" Universal riser for Rod. Earl Hoyt's Sky Conquest riser was 24\" and it was a fantastic riser!\n\nIt has been well known to all archers, and even admitted by those who are free to be honest, that X10's tend to always have a few fliers in the dozen. Some top archers get hand-selected shafts, while others can get enough dozens to sort out a competitive group of shafts from the larger batch.\n\nIn 2007, I was given three dozen X10's to select from, and out of those three dozen, about 10 bare shafts would not find the red or gold no matter what I did. They were set aside for blank bale and formaster practice. I had better luck with consistency when I used A/C/E's, often having 10 or 11 of the 12 that would bare shaft group at 70.\n\nThe reason I switched from X10 to Nano Pro in 2007 was that Nano Pro's gave me 12 good arrows out of a dozen shafts. I could routinely put all 12 bare shafts into the red or better at 70 meters. A few times, I managed to put all 12 in the gold, again, bare shafts from 70 meters. This is the consistency I was looking for from a top quality target arrow, and they fell between the A/C/E and X10 in weight so that was good for me because of my 32.25\" arrow.\n\nI still use Nano Pro's (X-tremes) and believe they are the equal to X10's, although the last few dozen I have received were not as consistent as the ones I was getting in 2007. I believe those were hand-selected prototypes and that could be why I saw such great consistency. I'm sure that with hand-selected X10's or A/C/E's, one would see the same thing. But how many non-sponsored archers get to shoot hand-selected shafts? None that I know of... So that leaves us non-sponsored types sorting arrows the best we can if we want the most competitive arrows we can shoot. This is particularly important during matchplay when you're probably only shooting three arrows all day long. You want to know those are your most consistent three arrows.\n\nThere are easy ways to sort arrows and expensive premium target arrows from Easton or Carbon Express are still always worth the money - even if you do have to sort them. There are other advantages they hold over less expensive arrows besides pure consistency. Things like weight, diameter, variable spine, premium components, etc.\n\nI still use my NPX because they are great arrows, but if I had the chance to sort some A/C/E's or even X10's (although I'll probably never shoot X10's again strictly because of the heavy weight and poor FOC of such long stiff arrows), I'm sure they would shoot just fine. I have put several of my students in A/C/E's (esp. the ladies) over the years and had them go on to win national titles and earn spots on world teams. I've also put some of my barebow archers in McKinney II's and do the same thing.\n\nWe are blessed with an embarrassment of riches these days when it comes to arrows. We have better choices for less $ than ever before."
