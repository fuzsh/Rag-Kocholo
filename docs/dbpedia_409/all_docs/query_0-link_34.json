        "text": "The U.S. Olympic archery squad sustained an unexpected loss when Justin Huish, the multiple gold medalist from four years ago, became involved in personal legal problems.\n\nHuish resigned in the middle of August due to charges that he possessed marijuana with intent to sell, marking the second setback to the team in the span of a year.\n\nThe first American archer to capture a pair of gold medals four years ago at Atlanta, Huish did not want to be a distraction this time around. But how could he not be?\n\nHe may be out of site, but likely is not out of the minds of teammates Vic Wunderle and Richard \"Butch\" Johnson. Rod White replaced Huish and the team's alternate will be Jason McKittrick.\n\nHuish, 25, pleaded innocent to the charges on March 15 and is scheduled to have a hearing on April 5, 2001.\n\nIn the face of adversity, his former teammates begin a quest for the gold on Sept. 18 with individual eliminations. The women begin one day earlier.\n\nLooking to fill the void created by Huish's absence is White, a 23-year-old who placed fourth at the Olympic Trials. Wunderle placed first at the Trials and Johnson third.\n\nJohnson is fresh off capturing the men's recurve bow title at the National Target Championships in early August. He replaced Shane Parker, who was suspended from the NAA for cheating.\n\nThe NAA Board of Governors determined that Parker attempted to gain an unfair advantage at the Olympic Trials semifinals, held in New Jersey last summer. He shot two additional arrows in a six-arrow end after two of his arrows missed the target.\n\nWunderle is the lone survivor from the original three-man team selected in September 1999.\n\nIn a tune-up for the Games, the men's team swept the individual competition and took gold in the team event at the Poland International Grand Prix in Chorzow on Aug. 13. White, Wunderle and Johnson took gold, silver and bronze. White edged Johnson, 107-106, then defeated Wunderle, 112-109, for his fifth straight win and the gold.\n\nA sport which boasts athletes who are not household names missed an opportunity to get one in August when actress Geena Davis failed in her attempt to make the team.\n\nLeading the way for the women is 26-year-old Denise Parker, who is going to the Olympics for the third time. She placed fifth individually in 1992 and ninth at the Trials four years ago.\n\nWhile making only her first Olympic appearance, Karen Scovotto is coming in hot as she won the women's recurve bow title in August. Her mark of 2,681 eclipsed the previous record of 2,655, set by Parker in 1991. Scovotto, 18, is the youngest and highest ranked in the world of the three.\n\nJanet Dykman, 46, placed 16th individually at the Games in 1996.\n\nWith two-thirds of the top American men's archers excluded from this year's Games, things have opened up for the South Korean team, runner-up in Atlanta. World No. 1 Lionel Torres of France and Italy's Michele Frangilli are among the top international contenders.\n\nArchery became an Olympic sport in 1900, but it was expelled from the Games as nations could not agree on official rules. It was readmitted in 1972 and underwent a series of rule changes from 1984-92.\n\nThis year's Games will be governed as they were in 1996. Sixty-four entrants in the individual events begin with a 72-arrow round of qualifying. A match play round is next with all 64 advancing.\n\nThe top qualifier plays No. 64, the second qualifer plays 63, and so on. Eighteen arrows are used at 70 meters through the eighth final, and 12 arrows in the quarterfinals, semifinals and final."
