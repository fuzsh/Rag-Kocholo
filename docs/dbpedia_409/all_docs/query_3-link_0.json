        "text": "Butch Johnson has competed at the Olympics five times for the United States, consecutively from 1992-2008. He began his archery career shooting compound bows, but switched to recurve in his teens. He switched back and forth between the two styles for several years but settled on recurve on 1994. He has won over 40 US Championships in various forms of archery, and the World Indoor Trials in 1995 and 1997. At the Pan-American Games he was silver medalist in 1995 and bronze medalist in 1999, as well as helping win a team gold in 1999. He also works in the archery industry, managing Hallâ€™s Arrow, an indoor archery range in his native Connecticut."
