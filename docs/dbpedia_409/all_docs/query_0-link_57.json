        "text": "By David Gold\n\nJune 5 - Six athletes have been nominated by United States Archery for its Olympic team following the conclusion of trials in Colorado at the weekend.\n\nMiranda Leek (pictured below), Khatuna Lorig, Jennifer Nichols, Brady Ellison (pictured top), Jake Kaminski and Jacob Wukie will hope to fly the United States flag in London this summer.\n\nBut with only one women's slot confirmed so far for the US, Leek, Lorig and Nichols will hope to qualify for the Olympics at the third World Cup stage and final Olympic qualifier in Ogden later this month.\n\nA top-three finish there would mean the whole team is sent to the Olympics â€“ but if not, it will be just Leek heading to London.\n\nArchery is one of the US' weaker sports, with none of its 110 medals at Beijing 2008 coming in the event.\n\nThey have shown signs of recent improvement, however, beating favourites South Korea to scoop the men's team honours at the London 2012 archery test event.\n\nIn Ellison, a Beijing Olympian, the US boasts the world number-one and a double World Cup winner who also won his category at the archery test event.\n\nEllison is also the first archer ever to win three consecutive World Cup stages and has been world ranked one since last year.\n\nWukie was a reserve for Beijing 2008 while Kaminski will be competing at his first Olympics, although he has only been a regular on the World Cup circuit since 2010.\n\nLeek's appearance in London will be her first trip to the Olympics after recording the highest points total, 126.75, at the trials.\n\nLorig, a veteran of four Olympics, was a flag bearer at the Beijing 2008 Closing Ceremony while Nichols is a double Olympian.\n\nThe men's trio also won the first ever World Cup team gold in America's archery history last year.\n\nJoe Fanchin and Heather Koehl have respectively been named as the men's and women's alternates.\n\nMissing out was the vastly experienced Butch Johnson, a five-times Olympian and Atlanta 1996 gold medallist, along with Dan Schuller, Thomas Stanwood and Vic Wunderle, who has gone to three Games and won two medals, silver and bronze.\n\nKristin Braun, Holly Stover, Lori Cieslinski and Mackenzie Brown were the unlucky women who missed out.\n\nContact the writer of this story at [email protected]"
