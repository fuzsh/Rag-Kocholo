        "text": "KAREN SCAVOTTO, 18, of Enfield, peeled down her white sock to display the Olympic rings tattooed on her right ankle. A white billboard with a red-and-blue striped border bid her well on the lawn not far away.\n\nAs a blue compact car came down the street, the driver honked, waved and yelled, ''All the way, U.S.A.!'' ''Everybody honks and waves around here,'' Scavotto said with a grin.\n\nAt the Summer Olympics in Sydney, which open Friday, Scavotto will be one of 10 athletes who grew up or now live in Connecticut to represent the United States. That's down from 13 in 1996.\n\nConnecticut is certainly not a powerhouse at the Olympics, like, say California, which has about 150 athletes, and Texas, with about 40. But over the years the state has nurtured a number of outstanding Olympians. Bruce Jenner, who won the 1976 gold medal in the decathlon, is from Newtown. Bill Toomey of New Canaan won the same event in 1968. Dorothy Hamill, the 1976 gold medal figure skater, is from Riverside, a section of Greenwich. Lindy Remigino, who graduated from Hartford Public High School, won two gold medals at the 1952 Games -- in the men's 100-meter dash and 4x100 relay team."
