The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in room 2322, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Cliff Stearns (chairman) presiding. Members present: Representatives Stearns, Upton, Cubin, Shadegg, Bass, Terry, Stupak, and Green. Staff present: David Cavicke, majority counsel; Ramsen Betfarhad, majority counsel; Brian McCullough, majority professional staff; Will Carty, legislative clerk; and Chris Knauer, minority investigator. Mr. Stearns. Good morning, the subcommittee will come to order. Without objection, the subcommittee will proceed pursuant to Committee Rule 4E. So ordered, the chair recognizes himself for an opening statement. At this time of heightened international tension and the possibility of war looming, devoting congressional attention to sports might not seem a high priority at first glance. But in the context of the Olympics we recognize the value of the unifying qualities of international athletic competitions that highlight our similarities and ignore our differences. And there is no competition more important or richer in tradition than the Olympics. Their ability to inspire national pride and provide a sense of identity, in addition to fulfilling the dreams of athletes to compete at the highest level, serve a purpose higher than being just another sporting competition. Over the past few months, internal problems within the USOC have surfaced, ultimately resulting in the resignation of several of its top officials. While I do not wish to downplay the significance of these events, it is apparent that they have been the catalyst in focusing attention on a broader range of issues relating to the USOC and the Olympics movement. It has been 25 years since the Amateur Sports Act recognized the USOC and provided it with its mission. If nothing else, the recent events have provided everyone involved with the Olympics with an opportunity to put everything on the table for examination, with the intention of improving the organization and preserving the Olympic ideal. The U.S. Olympic movement is, without question, better off today than it was prior to 1978. Yet the degree of negative attention that has been attached to the USOC regarding these events, recent events, has reached a fevered pitch, often characterizing the USOC as ineffective, dysfunctional and having lost its direction. Given some of the hyperbole, I was expecting an eminent collapse, similar to the corporate failures this committee investigated this year. To be sure, the USOC does appear to have some problems, and, like any organization, has room for improvement. Whether the internal problems are attributable to one-time personnel conflicts or rather problems inherent in the structure that will inevitably surface again is a question that is critical to the continued success of our Olympic movement. The USOC has responded to the criticism by appointing a ten-person internal task force to examine governance and ethics issues. Additionally, an independent five-person commission has been appointed to review the USOC and provide recommendations to Congress. These are welcome developments and I look forward to reviewing their conclusions. My one concern is that recommendations have been made in the past and have never been implemented. Despite the recent blemishes, the USOC has been and continues to provide funding and services for athletes at levels unimaginable 25 years ago. The legislation enacted in 1978 was a necessary tool to implement the changes and has been extremely successful in fulfilling its intent, by many accounts. However, that was then and this is now. Much has changed in the past 25 years, during the USOC's evolution. Athletes are better. International competition is stronger. The demands of the USOC to meet these challenges are greater. The name of the act alone appears to be a misnomer, as many Olympians today are not amateurs, but rather professionals. From the NBA basketball players to the NHL hockey players, it is a far cry from the 1980 Miracle on Ice, the U.S. hockey team that brought home the gold in Lake Placid. The one constant that has not changed is the value Americans place on the Olympics and the trust we place in the USOC as caretaker of what many consider a national treasure. It would be tragic if the recent problems of the USOC undermine the success that so many individuals have dedicated their lives to create. USOC is a unique organization with a mandate unlike any other, comprised of both paid professionals assigned to operate the organization, and heavily dependent on volunteers from a broad constituency. Observations have been made that it has resulted in a structure that can work to the detriment of fulfilling its mission. I was surprised to discover how broadly USOC membership is. From the community-based organization at the local level, all the way to the elite athletes that represent the U.S. in the Olympics, Para-Olympics and the Pan American Games, it is no wonder that a board of directors of 122 members, representing such diverse constituents, would inevitably present managerial difficulty. Whether or not this needs to be changed is clearly open for discussion. Any changes will obviously affect member organizations differently and need to be considered carefully. While it is appropriate to examine ways to improve the structure and efficiency of the USOC, it is equally, if not more important, to examine its mission itself. The USOC has been many things to many groups. The tradeoffs of a broad mission versus a narrowly focused purpose are clear. The USOC can be a jack-of-all trades and do it with reasonable success. If, however, we want it to be the best Olympic organization for the athletes, then we may have to lighten its load of responsibilities. Any restructuring effort would be premature before we consider what the Olympic movement should be and hear from all the relevant parties. With that question in mind, I look forward to the beginning of our productive dialog this morning. Today we have expert witnesses representing the USOC, the national governing bodies; the Athletics Advisory Council, the independent commission reviewing the USOC; current athletes; and of course, our distinguished colleagues from the house and senate. With that, Mr. Stupak. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thanks for holding this hearing as we examine the structure and recent problems with the USOC. And I want to thank our witnesses for being here and I am sure they will provide testimony for us today. I, for one, I have Northern Michigan University in my district. It is the only Olympic Education Center in the country. I have personally seen how hard these athletes work, train, and dream toward their Olympic goals. But for this dream they sacrifice much and I, once again, want to bring up, as I did 2 years ago, I feel the USOC does not help our Olympic Education Centers. They will give athletes from other countries scholarships and education in this country, but our own people, they do not help at all. So I am not real happy with the USOC and the way they treat our Olympic athletes. But without a doubt, and going off your statement, Mr. Chairman, the USOC does need our help. As I said, 2 years ago, the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee conducted a lengthy investigation into the International Olympic Committee and various aspects of the USOC following the tawdry bidding process affiliated with both the Salt Lake City and the Atlanta Games. What the subcommittee found in that investigation was appalling. Bribes were rampant, IOC Representatives were showered with gifts and services of all kinds to lure the games to the cities of Atlanta and Salt Lake City. All-expense paid trips were tossed to IOC members like candy. Moving fees, condos, airline tickets, college tuition, cash, and even medical services were among the long list of gifts lavished on corrupt IOC members to secure bids. Clear and overwhelming evidence was uncovered illustrating that the IOC, its representatives, and many involved in the bidding process were operating completely out of the organization's control. In short, Mr. Chairman, the system was out of control. Rather than behaving as a shining beacon of hope and good will, the example set by the IOC became close to extinguishing the Olympic flame for good. I bring up the IOC in this early investigation because it was the USOC that was responsible for aggressively overseeing and preventing these unseemly activities, at least insofar as the bid city behavior was concerned. While true that neither Atlanta nor the Salt Lake City bid committees invented this behavior, nobody at the USOC was apparently minding the store. To view breakdowns that occurred with both the Atlanta and Salt Lake bids was to observe not only a failed IOC structure, but also a failed USOC structure. Through these scandals it was clear, early on, that major problems plagued the USOC and its construction. It was also clear that major changes would be required to prevent the kind of problems we now find ourselves addressing today. That the USOC continues to grab dubious headlines, even after the earlier scandals of both Salt Lake and Atlanta, is a sad testament to the organization's continuing flaws. And while the USOC's intended mission is clearly to serve the athlete, it nonetheless appears too often to serve its own interests while leaving its original mission obscured by politics, in-fighting and a bloated bureaucracy. To be fair, I would say that some of the blame rests clearly on Congress. It is the Congress that essentially created the USOC and has oversight responsibility over its structure and its activities. Nonetheless, congressional involvement with the USOC has been absent and only tends to surface once a major problem arises. While I generally support a hands-off policy or approach, where practical, I believe that Congress must play a greater role in overseeing the direction of the USOC, particularly through this challenging period of restructuring. The plight of our U.S. athletes, the only real mission of the USOC, is too important to allow this organization to continue in stumbling along. So how did we get to where we are here today, yet again, examining a failed Olympic-related organization? It was clear after the emergence of the Salt Lake City and Atlanta scandals, that not only would a full restructuring of the IOC be necessary, but so too would a restructuring be needed at the USOC. During these earlier scandals, plenty of commissions, task forces, and blue ribbon panels were formed. Vast details were given regarding how the Olympics' governing bodies failed to do their duties and how scandals arose. A clear accounting of who shot who was examined by Congress and by the media. What didn't occur, however, was consistent follow-up with particular emphasis on the USOC. As the IOC and the USOC made promises to re-tool their respective governing structures and various commitments were made to build compliance programs into their organizations, scant review occurred to determine if these systems were adequate or even functioned. One only need review the first Mitchell report commission after the Salt Lake City scandal to recognize that clear, structural problems existed at the USOC, and that these would require major surgery to prevent future problems. As the USOC slipped from the radar, however, many deeper issues went unaddressed and unnoticed by Congress. That is why we find ourselves, yet again, in this room attempting to fix the USOC. It will now be the attempt of this committee to work with our Senate friends to begin the process of fully looking into these matters. Mr. Chairman, let me conclude by raising a note of caution. While it is important to focus on the structure of the USOC, the subject of today's hearings, we must not forget that the USOC is part of a larger governing body, the IOC. The IOC cannot and should not be ignored from this inquiry. If continued examination and accountability are not directed at the IOC, like we are now doing with the USOC, I fear another scandal will emerge with the IOC, but will yet again result in muddying the USOC. In short, in an attempt to re-tool the USOC must also involve an examination of not only how the IOC has been restructured, but also how it interacts with the USOC. Mr. Chairman, I welcome today's inquiry and the many witnesses that will testify today. I look forward to working with you and the many witnesses to begin addressing the problems facing the USOC. I would ask that if we start this project that we stay with it. I would also suggest that as we begin to address the problems associated with the USOC, we again reacquaint ourselves with some of the issues still facing the IOC. The IOC now and in the future will affect how the USOC ultimately functions. With that, Mr. Chairman, I am over my time, but thank you. I was working off two different statements here for the benefit of---- Mr. Stearns. Good job. I thank you colleague. Gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Upton. Mr. Upton. Thank you, Mr. Stearns. First of all, I welcome the two members that are here and certainly the panel to follow. It was under my chairmanship of the oversight investigations subcommittee two congresses ago that we in fact did expose a number of real problems with the Olympic bidding, both in Atlanta, Salt Lake and at the IOC. And I have to say our purpose of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee was to in fact look where there were problems, and we found them. And we thought at the time that when the blue ribbon commission was established, led by Senator Mitchell, Senator Baker, Howard Baker, Ken Duberstein and Henry Kissinger, that in fact with an ethics committee it would be solved. But we found that there was little follow-through. I wand to call it a sham, but in essence they were not given the power that they needed to see corrective changes made, and all of us were disappointed, to say the least. It is important that this committee and this subcommittee take the hearing today and look at constructive changes so that we can, in fact, look at legislation. To work with the Senate, with Republicans and Democrats, to restore the luster of what every American wants the Olympics to be. Whether it be in this country or overseas, as well. I look forward to this hearing. I look forward to working with Chairman Stearns to make sure that, in fact, we pursue legislation, but we never get into that situation again. I look forward to hearing the testimony and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Stearns. I thank my colleague. The gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Shadegg. The gentleman from Colorado, Arizona, Arizona. Mr. Shadegg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for holding this important and timely hearing and I also want to thank our witnesses for being with us and I look forward to their testimony. There is no doubt that the Olympics have inspired millions of Americans and left indelible impressions of inspiration, achievement and sportsmanship on both young and old. Just last year, at the urging of my daughter, who is a rabid fan of Olympic ice skating and also of my son who is a fan of both Olympic hockey and skiing, the Shadegg Family enjoyed the inspiration of attending the Olympics. The history of those games is remarkable. Just think of a few examples. The United States upsetting the vaunted Soviet hockey team at Lake Placid. Or the sight of Keri Strugg sticking her landing to spite an injured ankle. Or the falls of Dan Jansen before he rose up in triumphed. Fortunately, those and many other great moments are the ones that stick in people's memories when they think of the Olympics, not the dark moments. The bribery scandal which preceded the Salt Lake City Olympics or the recent in-fighting in the U.S. Olympic Committee. However, that should not detract us from examining the organization of the USOC. In deed, since the USOC in many ways is the group that oversees how many in the world view the United States, it must step up to the challenges of its Ambassadorial role. As such, we need to ensure that the Olympic Committee's focus is on athletes and not on its own management difficulties. Athletes need focus and direction to be successful. But from all evidence, the USOC lacks focus and directions. Athletes need to maintain strict discipline to achieve performance. And yet from all evidence the USOC is undisciplined. It has bloated salaries and high expenses. Athletes need to have support to win. And from evidence, the USOC can do a better job of supporting our athletes. Mr. Chairman, I am loathe to have the U.S. Congress get into the day-to-day management of the USOC. However, it maybe wise to have the Congress set out some direction for the committee as we move forward. Today, across America, young people are training hard to be able to compete at their highest, possible level. It seems to me that our focus needs to be on enabling that training and facilitating those athletes to continue and remove any unnecessary burdens or barriers. Mr. Chairman, I look forward to hearing from our witnesses and working with you on this issue so that we might improve the circumstances under which our athletes train and prepare for the Olympics. I thank you and yield back my time. Mr. Stearns. And I thank my distinguished colleague from Arizona, Mr. Shadegg. And the gentleman from Nebraska. Mr. Terry. Waive. Mr. Stearns. Okay, waive. [Additional statements submitted for the record follow:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Barbara Cubin, a Representative in Congress from the State of Wyoming Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this timely hearing. I would like to welcome my colleagues, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell and Congressman Jim Ryun. Their testimony and presence today, as both Olympic athletes and overseeing legislators, will provide invaluable insight into the U.S. Olympic Committee's current state of affairs. The U.S. Olympic program exudes the very essence of the American Spirit. It provides unspeakable opportunities to any man, woman or child who dares to dream big enough. The message is clear to all with the ambition--your hard work, determination and God given talents can soar here. A fellow Wyomingite who embodies that very thing is a member of the second panel. Against all odds in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia Rulon Gardner upset the three-time Olympic Greco-Roman champion from Russia and took home the Gold Medal. This tremendous victory will forever be remembered and celebrated. It instilled and reignited the spark of hope in all who aspire to such athletic excellence. While these triumphant moments will remain, the time has come to shed light on another aspect of the Olympics. The U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC). In recent months, a number of troubling factors within the USOC have come to light. It is first and foremost an unfortunate situation that potentially compromises our fundamental belief in what has been a tremendous source of pride. That is why we must examine the structure and mission of the USOC. It is my hope the testimony heard today will shed further light on what necessary steps might be taken to strengthen the Olympic movement in our country. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and I yield back the remainder of my time. ______ Prepared Statement of Hon. W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce Last year this Committee investigated and uncovered several high profile corporate failures. The details of the corruption and mismanagement that were the undoing of these former high flyers are legendary now. So when a non-profit organization experiences the type of problems that precipitated the resignations at the USOC recently, it is noteworthy but may seem minor in comparison. Yet there is a difference when the organization under discussion holds our national trust, as does the USOC. The dreams, hopes, and inspiration for many Americans are often traced to an Olympic hero. It is for this reason that the recent stumbles of the USOC have garnered so much attention. The ideal of integrity the Olympics represent should be the singular focus and governing factor in every decision made by the USOC. It is not clear whether the resignations of USOC officials indicate a systemic problem or if they were a single random event. Regardless, the USOC faces a problem: we are a forgiving nation, but we do not always forget. Restoring the integrity of our Olympic movement and the trust of the people is of paramount importance not only for today's athletes, but also for future generations of aspiring athletes. The USOC has taken the initial steps necessary to restore its image by forming an internal task force and appointing an independent commission to perform separate reviews. Very few of us are neither experts on managing a multi-million dollar non-profit nor experts on the needs of the diverse sports organizations that are served by the USOC. We will therefore rely heavily on the recommendations of the experts involved. I believe Congress can aid in this process as well. We should not be viewed as an adversary; we are here to assist you in any way we can. Perhaps the biggest help we can provide is through a process of education and discussion. There is a lot on the table to discuss, and it is not clear that downsizing, streamlining, or making changes at the margins to the organizational structure will take the USOC where it needs to be. While some changes are a forgone conclusion, the size and scope of any changes should reflect and be compatible with the USOC's mission. Defining the USOC's mission appears to be the most important issue we need to discuss. The USOC's responsibilities are numerous and varied. Should they be charged with facilitating participation in local communities and providing services duplicative of other organizations? While many voices need to be heard, we should not shy away from this opportunity to examine and define the USOC's responsibilities. It has been 25 years since Congress created the USOC. To say this is a vastly different country now than it was then is an understatement. Perhaps it is time that the USOC reflect these changes. I thank the Subcommittee Chair for assembling this excellent panel of experts. I look forward to hearing their views and continuing the dialogue with all interested parties. Mr. Stearns. With that, we will move to our first panel. It is a pleasure to welcome two very distinguished Members of Congress and former Olympians who will testify. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado served in the House from 1987 to 1993, and it now in his second term in the Senate. Prior to his service he was a Rancher, Horse Trainer, a Teacher, Designer of jewelry and is a Judo Champion. The Senator was on the U.S. Judo Team in the 1964 Olympics. Our other colleague from the House, Congressman Jim Ryun of Kansas is now in his fourth term. The Congressman participated in three Olympics and won the silver medal in the 1500 meter run in 1968. In addition to being a world class athlete, Jim Ryun has served as a Motivational Speaker, Author and Consultant. So I welcome, sincerely, both of my colleagues and I appreciate your time. We will start off with Senator Campbell. STATEMENTS OF HON. BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO; AND HON. JIM RYUN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF KANSAS Senator Campbell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for showing an interest in this issue and conducting this hearing. And I am just delighted to be here with my colleague and a team member. Even though we were on different Olympic teams, once you are an Olympian you are sort of the teammate of everybody that has passed before you and after you. And I am just delighted to be here with a, not only a very fine Congressman, but a world-renowned athlete too, as Jim was. I want to tell you that we are very proud in Colorado that the United States Olympic committee is housed in our State. When I was in the legislature it was only a few years after the decision was made to transfer an Air Force Base, which was government property, to the Olympic committee to be their headquarters and their training facility. And in those days many of us worked very hard on the Colorado legislature to get, as an example, in-State tuition of young athletes who wanted to train there and also go to school, to waive the in-State requirements for doctors, if they were doctors from other States who would come to the Olympic committee to practice medicine for the athletes. We even passed a bill in the legislature to allow people paying their State income tax to check off a dollar to go directly to the Olympic Committee. Which, for a while, raised about $200,000 for the team. I think in this whole dialog, if I can take just a moment, that there are thousands of supporters of the Olympic team and there many unsung heroes, Nutritionists and Coaches and Trainers and on and on. And when we talk about the problems that are basically management problems, I think we tend to cast a broad net and maybe paint with a very broad brush. But having the Olympic committee in our State, I can tell you the vast majority of people that have anything to do with the Olympic Games are just hard working and dedicated to trying to make youngsters be the best they can be. We are very proud of all the people that win gold medals as any American would be. But for everyone that wins that, there are literally hundreds and hundreds that are trying equally hard, but just didn't quite make it. But we think that citizenship and fair play and dedication to effort is an equally important mission for the U.S. Olympic Committee. I have been here almost 18 years now, and for a while there were three of us, Senator Bill Bradley and Tom McMillan, who was a colleague of yours and you knew very well. And for years, you know, it was a very proud, being noted by the Olympic team that they didn't get any government help. Unlike many States in which sports are controlled by a bureaucrat at government level that pretty much dictates and mandates everything that goes on in that amateur sport. That is the way the Soviet Union did and many of the communist countries still do today. We have always been proud of the fact that government has had kind of a hands off approach to it. But times are changing. And during the years that Tom and Bill and I were here, we formed what was called an Olympic Caucus of House members and Senate members who were interested in the Olympic movement. And basically it was kind of a bumper group that would step in and have some voice if some of our colleagues it may, it should be nationalized or the charter should be changed someway. And so we were very careful with that. Well, the need sort of went down and so Bill and Tom both left and now its just me on the Senate side with Jim on the House side. But clearly the problems that we face with the Olympic Committee, I think, need to be distinguished from the average rank and file people that are working every day to make it a better committee. Now, of course, there is big money involved in the Olympic. Not only the money they raise, but the money we put in to, through indirect funding. I saw one number that said the Salt Lake Games might have been over $4 billion expense for the Federal Government if you factor in, not only all the security, which was considerable. ATF was there. The FBI was there. The military was there, as you know. But also the infrastructure that goes to build, for instance, off-ramps from the main thoroughfares to the Olympic venues. That is almost done at taxpayers' expense. We provide that money through our transportation bills and transportation appropriation committee. So we do have a vested interest in kind of watching how a taxpayer's money is spent. We, as you know, have done two hearings on the Senate side under the authority of their Senate Commerce Committee, with Senator McCain chairing. And in those two hearings we, I think we clearly recognized it is time to make some changes and as Congressman Stupak mentioned, there have been some attempts to have some internal change done, but they have not gone very far. That is probably not as easily said as done because when you have a large board and almost everybody on that board represents an individual sport that may not have anything to do with another sport, there is always some turf involved and some worries about whether they may be left out if there is a change. And we understand that. But the thing really was brought to a head when there was a recent recognition by several members of the Ethics Committee based on a disagreement between the CEO of the Olympic committee and the President of the Olympic committee. Both thought they had a certain amount of authority, which apparently was not well defined in their by-laws about who had which authority to be spokesman at international levels. In any event, at the end of the two hearings, as you mentioned, Senator McCain did authorize an independent commission of five people, and they are supposed to report back to the U.S. Senate by the 30th, with their recommendations on what they are to do from a Federal level. In having lunch with Senator McCain yesterday, he told me we were going to move forward for sure under his authority and will be revising the Amateur Sports Act of 1978. Senator Stevens wrote that bill, by the way, and he is our President Emeritus, the President Pro Tem, excuse me, in the U.S. Senate now, as you know. When this, as it has been called, this functionalism came to light, I don't think that is where the beginning was. As I look back on where things began to go wrong, it seemed to me that when the Olympic Committee, about 4 years ago, or maybe a little more, authorized a study that was called the McKinsey report, that came back and recommended that the Olympic committee be run more like a corporation. I think that is where some of the people began to lose their way. The Olympic committee is big money, no question about it, and I think they have to have some good corporate practices there in order to manage it well. But it is also a non-profit and it is also a system of training young people. It is a little different mission, maybe a big different mission than a straight corporate board would do. And in my view, what happened after that was that there were at least a few people that began to develop what I call a cultural privilege in what I deem to be a real abuse of how money is spent. And some of the numbers that we got back, I mean it just, I couldn't believe some of the first ones we were getting back. But how much money was being spent that I considered wasteful or self-serving. In any event, Senator Stevens and I subsequently made a trip out to the United States Olympic Committee to talk to the athletes, the coaches, the management people were there. And there was an awful lot of newspaper print, as you might guess, and television attention before we even got there. We have, our office has a satellite office in Colorado Springs. We started getting a lot of calls from people that actually worked at the Olympic Committee, volunteering information of mismanagement, of things that they thought were wrong, that shouldn't be. And we told them that we, you know, I am your Senator so they have a right to come in and talk to me, obviously, but we didn't want them to just come in and be finger pointing and gossiping and, you know, he said, she said and so on. But if they had some documentation that they thought would be of interest to the U.S. Congress, they should provide that. We ended up with a book, I think, between an inch and a half and two inches thick of documentation. Which we very frankly now don't know what to do with. Some of that information was leaked to the press before we even got it, so it is already public knowledge. Some of it, I am not an attorney, but after reviewing some of it, Senator Stevens said he thought some of it bordered on violation of fraud laws, at least, and maybe other things. But when we talk about what we do with that information now, one of the things that I personally would like to avoid, very frankly, is dragging our team through any more mud. While at the same time, fixing the problems that have gotten them in trouble in the first place. We have had suggestions that we turn it over to the GAO and ask for an independent audit of how the finances are being handled. We have had a suggestion that we turn it over to the Justice Department to see if any civil rights violations have been made or any fraud laws have been broken, things of that nature. But in the meantime, some of the people that were really at the center of the storm have resigned and have left. The President of the USOC has resigned, Ms. Markmeyer resigned. Mr. Ward, who was the CEO, resigned. His right-hand helper, I forgot his name, I am sorry, it slips my mind right now, also resigned. And so I am not sure to what end it would do with all this information. However, I will tell the chairman of the committee you are interested in looking at it and he will be happy to provide that to you. But since not being an attorney, what I saw in reading that sounded much more in the realm of white collar crime. I thought, well, if we go forward with it and some of the people who are really responsible for this are gone, what would we end up doing? Slapping somebody on the wrist? Promoting more and more bad stories about a basically good willed organization? And so there we are in that quandary. But Senator McCain has indicated that when we get back the report from this independent commission, which will be here on the 30th, he intends to move forward with some changes in the Amateur Sports Act. I think, very frankly, under the new leadership of Bill Martin from the University of Michigan, as Congressman Upton very proudly has said, I think we are really beginning to turn the corner. His experience is renowned and his credentials, I think, are just sterling. And more than anything else, his heart is in the right place. And knows that the emphasis has got to be on our young people more than anything else. But we will be doing something, probably accepting some of their recommendations, too, that would be my guess. And we are hoping that they will, as you mentioned, they have an internal committee also working on how to streamline. They will probably come forward with some suggestions and that will be coupled with what the independent commission recommends to and we will go from there. But as I mentioned before, the vast majority of people that have been tainted with this, unfortunately, have been done so very unfairly. Having visited out there and knowing some of the athletes themselves, when I went around and talked to them, many of them are doing a terrific job and they are really focused on 2002, and we hope to get this behind us, long before 2002. And when the games will be Athens, instead of letting this hang over our head any longer. And we fully recognize that sometimes you have different problems at different levels. The IOC clearly has some problems. The USOC has some problems also. The organizing committee, as it was in Salt Lake, also had problems. Sometimes they work in concert and sometimes, very frankly, they don't work very well together. And some of their decisions are made somewhat independently of each other. But I would hope that our young athletes would not be distracted and I am very thankful that you invited some of them, that are actually in competition now, and not retired like some of us old-timers or retired like some of the recent ones that are just coaching now. Some that are actually going to be in Athens and are going to be in competition themselves will be able to testify, and I am looking forwards to that. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a U.S. Senator from the State of Colorado Thank you Mr. Chairman for allowing me to testify today. As you know, I have a vested interest in this issue, not only as senior Senator of the state where the USOC is headquartered, but also as one of Congress's two current members that are former Olympians. My time as a member of the U.S. Olympic Team provided me with considerable opportunities that I might not otherwise have had and fostered lifelong friendships that I will always treasure. I was literally raised in the Olympic movement and without it, I would probably be a member of another institution, but one with bars and guards. Because of these memories, I decided that I would do what I could to help other athletes have the same experiences that I did. I first started working to help the USOC as a member of the Colorado State Legislature where I worked on legislation providing a state income tax check-off to raise money for the USOC. I also worked on language to give tuition waivers to out-of-state student athletes training in Colorado and to waive in-state certification for doctors working at USOC headquarters. Since I have been a member of Congress, I have been one of the strongest supporters of the Olympic movement. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have been working for the last six years to provide the USOC with a new office building in Colorado Springs. I have worked to provide $14 million for the USOC's drug-testing administration that has been provided directly to USADA (United States Anti-Doping Agency) so that the ONDCP (Office of National Drug Control Policy) does not have administration powers or any other oversight. Congressional oversight is something we have tried to avoid since the creation of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978. Former Senator Bill Bradley, Former Representative Tom McMillan, and I formed a bipartisan caucus with other members who believed in the Olympic ideals to act as a buffer against any potential Congressional oversight of the Olympic team. After all of the difficulties the USOC has had over the past few years regarding financial mismanagement, ethics improprieties, and massive organizational dysfunction, it became apparent that Congress did need to step in. While not providing direct support to the USOC, this government has a great interest in the USOC as it has provided millions of dollars and thousands of man-hours to support Olympic events here in the U.S. and worldwide. As you know, the Senate Commerce Committee held two hearings this year to look into ethics violations only to discover many deeper problems in organizational difficulties. Following these hearings, many current and former employees and athletes came forward, both publicly and anonymously, to express their feelings and views and let me and my staff know of their complaints. Let me just say that it was eye opening to see the huge travel budgets, unnecessarily large severance packages, and bloated salaries, all occurring while athletes are having to live day to day and, in some cases, finance much of their own training in order to compete for their country. But through these hearings and media reports, we are all aware of what's been said and it is not necessary to dwell on it as long as it is recognized that these improprieties cannot occur again. Now is the time to move beyond these problems to create a new Olympic organization that will better serve its mission to promote the Olympic ideals and to develop and prepare our nation's athletes to compete against the rest of the world. I will credit the USOC for creating a task force to look at its own problems. But given everything I have come across through the ethics investigations, I don't know who can be trusted. This is why Senator McCain, Senator Stevens, and I have created an independent commission to look at the necessary changes at the USOC. We have our ideas, but I think that we'd like to avoid imposing Congress's will through legislation, if that is at all possible. But at the same time, legislation and Congressional oversight isn't impossible and I must remind everyone involved that it can be done and will be done if necessary. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stearns. Thank you, Senator. Our colleague, Jim. STATEMENT OF HON. JIM RYUN Mr. Ryun. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I appreciate the opportunity to sit here with my friend and fellow Olympian, Senator Campbell, who by the way isn't really a bad fencer. We have had a little competition with that along the way. Senator Campbell. To enlighten you, Mr. Chairman, someone got the two of us into a fencing match. Neither of us knows a broad sword from a foil, but we did our best. Mr. Ryun. And we had a good time sharing that experience and it really was a good experience, with the Olympic committee here in Washington. And I trust that this subcommittee's investigation and the continuing cooperation with the USC will actually yield some strong solutions to the problem facing the Olympic Committee. Let me begin by first of all echoing some of the concerns that Ben has expressed with regard to the Olympic movement and how far it reaches into the fabric of American society. When you consider the athlete, we often focus upon him. There is usually a coach, there is a sponsor, there are sometimes children, if they are old enough. You have the support groups that go with it. So, it reaches deep when you think of how the process is completed. Usually starting on a local level, then a State level and then a national level. And then you have to meet certain qualification standards and work your way through the process. My only point in highlighting that is that whatever you do here it is important that it is done right, because it does send a very clear message to the young people of this country, many of whom have high aspirations of maybe winning an Olympic medal, or at least being a part of the Olympic movement, and being a part of the Olympic team. For over 100 years the aim of the Olympic movement has been to build a peaceful and better world by educating youth through sport by bringing together athletes from all countries in sincere and impartial competition by sharing mutual understanding bound by friendship, solidarity and fair play that is a part of the Olympic spirit. As a three-time Olympic athlete, I have experienced first- hand the pinnacle of Olympic spirit. I have also fully appreciated what a positive force the USOC can be on young athletes. Created to, in the words of the USOC's current institution, and I quote, may the world's best national Olympic committee help U.S. Olympic athletes achieve sustained competitive excellence while inspiring all Americans and preserving the Olympic ideal. The committee has often lived up to its calling and its mission. However, scandal has followed scandal over the past several years and this is deeply, deeply troubling. Although these actions probably have not interfered with the training success of our athletes, they have certainly tarnished the image of the USOC and the Olympic movement. Mr. Chairman, I hope your subcommittee, through this and other similar hearings, will discover some of the root causes of these scandals and associated problems. Whether the causes are structural or lack of transparency, poorly realized mission and strategy, or some other reason, the need to restore confidence in the USOC is very important to the continued success of the Olympic movement. Some of the problems with the USOC are easy to identify. For instance, and you highlighted this a moment ago. With a 122 board of directors, along with their unusually layered management structure, including paid staff and volunteer executives, it is hard to imagine how effective the structure can be in carrying out its mission. However, other problems, along with their corresponding solutions, are not so easily visible. This is one of the reasons I appreciate the recent comments and actions of USOC President Bill Martin. You had created a task force called by Mr. Martin and is charged to review the USOC from top to bottom and to devise major structural changes in policy revisions. I have heard the group will focus on six areas. Ethic behavior; governance and organizational structure; maintenance of sensitive, confidential and proprietary information; communications policies; openness; transparency in disclosure; and fund raising efficiency. This is the first tremendous step and I applaud Mr. Martin for this actions. I hope the task force will review and develop strong recommendations for the structural changes needed to address the problem plaguing the USOC. During this process I encourage the task force to remain focused on the well-being of the athletes. A much needed streamlining of the organizational structure and more open and transparent environment and the required confidence building measures needed to repolish the image of the Olympic Committee. Mr. Chairman, again, I thank you for the opportunity to be here and provide a statement to the subcommittee. I would be happy to entertain any questions some of the members might have at this time. [The prepared statement of Hon. Jim Ryun follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Jim Ryun Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee. I appreciate the opportunity to sit here with my friend and fellow Olympian, Senator Campbell, and provide you some personal thoughts on the US Olympic Committee. I trust that this subcommittee's investigation and continuing cooperation with the USOC will yield strong solutions to the problems facing the Olympic Committee. For over 100 years the aim of the Olympic Movement has been to build a peaceful and better world by educating youth through sport, by bringing together athletes from all countries in sincere and impartial competition and by sharing the mutual understanding bound by friendship, solidarity and fair play that is the Olympic Spirit. As a three-time Olympic athlete, I have experienced first-hand the pinnacle of the Olympic Spirit and also fully appreciate what a positive force the USOC can be on young athletes.

This is a tremendous first step, and I applaud Mr. Martin's judicious actions.

Mr. Chairman, again, thank you for this opportunity to provide a statement to your Subcommittee. I would be happy to entertain any questions you or other Members may have. Mr. Stearns. I thank both of my colleagues. I really don't have questions. I think, Senator Campbell, I am struck by three things you said. I don't think the American people realize that $4 billion was spent by taxpayers on the Olympics. I mean I had never heard that number. Senator Campbell. I might add, Mr. Chairman, that about a year ago Senator Stevens and I and several members of the Appropriations Committee traveled to Greece. We went to several other countries too, but we did go to Greece. We already have Americans in Greece now training people for any potential terrorist event for the Athens games. That is to the extent we go as Americans to help other countries make sure that their games are safe for athletes, for officials and for coaches. Mr. Stearns. Big financial commitment. Senator Campbell. Well, we are financing those people, Americans that are over there. But there were some, we talked to the Prime Minister of Greece and several of the cabinet members who assured us that it would be safe. The venue would be completely done and all of those other things. And I hope it is. But our interest, of course, was making sure that it, that we are participating. So even when the games are not in this country, we do provide some of the money. Mr. Stearns. Your other comment that a culture of privilege has developed, is obviously a concern. And then this book that you mention. I am sort of nonplused, like you, what to do with it, because you don't want to damage further. But if you have individuals that have committed fraud and there is criminal activity, that, I think, is important. So, perhaps, a question I have is do you think this book should be given to Mr. Martin? Senator Campbell. We have offered to let Mr. Martin review it, if he would like to. Mr. Stearns. Okay, okay. Senator Campbell. As I mentioned, some of it had already been leaked to the press before we got, so it is already common knowledge. Mr. Stearns. Okay. Senator Campbell. We were also very careful that the people who provided this information would not be at the end of some retribution by mid-management or upper-management people. Mr. Martin has assured me that is not going to happen. And I have assured the people in Colorado Springs that will not happen either. And, although, I have to tell you that when we originally went out there, both Senator Stevens and I thought that because it was a federally chartered institution that the employees would be protected as government officials are by the Whistle Blowers Act, and they are not. And so Senator Stevens has indicated one of his first efforts in this whole restructuring is going to be protection for employees of the Olympic committee in that bill. Mr. Stearns. I think that is important. Having gone through the Oversight Committee on Enron and Worldcom and Qwest and Imclone, the Whistle Blower protection is extremely important. So I think obviously that should be part of legislation. Mr. Stupak, do you any questions. Mr. Ryun. Mr. Chairman, if I may, can I make another comment. I know the committee takes very seriously the charge and the process of oversight. But I might just remind you that every 4 years literally billions of people watch the Olympic. Now having said that, there is a great deal of interest in what is going on here. We often think of this as being just a national issue, but the rest of the world is watching what is going to happen with the USOC. So, you know, I know you take that seriously, but there is a larger audience out there and that is why it is important that we get it right this time. Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me thank both of our witnesses for being here and let me thank them for the help. On this side of the House we have been spear-heading the Olympic Education Scholarships, and both Senator Campbell and Jim Ryun have helped us out on those scholarships to try and help some of our athletes to get an education while they train to represent their country in their chosen sports. I want to thank them for their help there. Senator Campbell, what in your mind has really broken down over the years regarding the USOC? I know you have done this---- Senator Campbell. If I could put it in a perspective, going back to my era, which I was on the 1964 team, we have come a long way. In those days you were pretty much on your own until the trials. I mean you supported yourself. If you got hurt, you were on your own. There was no medical support, nothing, I mean that was it. And if you didn't have a job, and in fact, some people actually lost their jobs. When they would make the team, they would be fired for losing time at work. And after we won our trials we would simply get together in a designated city, which was a kick off. We would get our uniforms issued and so on and then go to wherever the games were. And then when you came back, you were totally on your own again. Little by little that has changed now. So if a young athlete wants to try out now, in fact, even if they are not in the top level of their skill. If they are just interested in doing it, there is an avenue where they can train and work their way up. And in fact, I think there is about, oh, maybe 11 or a dozen full-time teams that train year-round at Colorado Springs. Others train in Lake Placid, as you know, and some other places. But they have come along way. I went and visited the doctors when I was out there, the trainers, and ate with some of the team members. And I kept thinking that when I was going through that, boy, if we could have only had this. So all that has been made available because of the good will of every Mom and Pop that sends $10. And, of course, the big corporation sponsors that are very interested in what we are doing. Because when I was there I happened to talk to the people from McDonald's, and encouraged them to stick with us. This is going to get ironed out and they shouldn't let their confidence be shaken. But at you probably know, several sponsors have already said that they are a little worried and wondering whether they should pull their sponsorships or not. And we, I am the first one to try and discourage them from doing that because it is going to get better. We have come a long way and now we have to realize that because of this new management problem, we have got a long way to go yet. But I look forward to doing that and I know we can. But it seemed to me, as I mentioned earlier, it began to change when the McKinsey Report was issued. Which basically says they should move more toward a corporate management style. Mr. Stupak. Jim, anything you want add on that? Mr. Ryun. Just that you really are dealing with a lot of different jurisdictional issues, and it is hard to get it right because, you know, Ben's needs and for what he was doing were different than, say, the track and field athletes' needs. And so with those dynamics, even though you need a sponsorship and I am saying that is an essential part of it, you had to pull those things all together and to make it work. And I think, you know, really what we are looking at here is kind of like a family relationship. And it is the refining of those particular characteristics that is going to lead to better management and a better program. But it is a painful process, as well. Mr. Stupak. Well, 2 years ago we looked at what had happened with Salt Lake and Atlanta. And, again, as I said in my opening, we did our investigation and then they said they would reform, things would get better. And here we are 2 years later, going through basically the same allegations and the same problems. Do you believe Congress will need to do more oversight, not only of the USOC but also the IOC? Senator? Senator Campbell. Well, we have very limited ability to oversee what the IOC does, as you know. Much more with the USOC, but I think the time has come that we have to. I am not sure, very honestly, Congressman Stupak, I am not sure that they can reform themselves to the degree they need to. It is a complicated, difficult thing. And we have 122 members on that board. And many of them, you know, they represent a lot of different sports. Mr. Stupak. True. Senator Campbell. In fact, when I looked at the list, the new list of all the sports, I didn't recognize some of those sports. I didn't know what they were. And even when I went out to the Olympic committee the other day and I watched women's weight lifting and women's wrestling and some other things. I know wrestling and I know weight lifting, but my group, you know, it was pretty much a man's sport. A lot of changes have been made. And with every change there comes a constituency and an agenda for that particular sport. So when you have 122 members on that board, many of the members are much more interested in their own sport and their agenda than they are of the total picture. And then you add to that about $150 million a year that the USOC is raising now, you can see it complicates it. A few years ago, about 3 or 4 years ago, there was several groups that were leaning on Senator Stevens to revise the Sports Act and require the Olympic committee to divide up some of the money based on the percentage to their sports. And Senator Stevens and I went out and did a hearing at that time. And we rejected that notion. We thought the Olympic committee was very capable of deciding how much money went to each one of the sports, the governing bodies of each sport. But clearly, money itself has changed the dynamics of the movement. Mr. Stupak. Jim, would you care to comment? Mr. Ryun. I would say clearly money has changed the dynamics but it has been a positive influence. And I can remember 1964, as well, and how hard it was for the athletes just to make the team, and they had to provide for their own support. While money has created an avenue of making it possible, it has also created the problem. So it is worth the battle. You know, one of their recommendation is greater transparency. I agree with that. And somehow we have to take, put the polish back on the Olympic Committee, the U.S. Olympic Committee, so we can move ahead of our sponsors. Because it is not very far off before we will again be putting together an Olympic game. Senator Campbell. If I could add one comment to that. One of the things, I wish I had brought the charts over that we had staff make for our hearings over on the Senate side. But one of the things that I got very interested in when I thought that there was some mismanagement about how the money was used was the Forbes study about 6 months ago. That studied the top 200 non-profits about most efficient use of money. The Red Cross was at the top, as I remember, that had like an 85 percent efficiency rating, meaning only 15 percent went to overhead and the other 85 went to what their mission was. The Olympic committee was one of the three worst, the three bottom ones with something like a 65 percent efficiency rating. That told me that there was a lot of money going to other places than what their mission should of been, which was to the athletes. And then we, we tried to get some comparative charts made, well we did get them made, of how the Red Cross is an example and some of the other ones, how their lines of authority go. How there chain of command goes. And then we did one of the Olympic Committee. One of the people testified that it looked like a bowl of spaghetti. And when I first saw it, the first thing I thought was it looked like something you might see in a Rorschach test. There were all kinds of lines going all kinds of ways. I mean I couldn't even figure the thing out about who had responsibility to who. But clearly they have some structural problems that need to be changed. And some of that they can probably do internally and some of it we have got to do. One of the things that I noted was that one of the people that resigned from the Ethics Committee, in fact, was working for a person who he would then have to judge, he would have to judge his behavior as a member of the Ethics Committee. Well, that puts them both in a very uncomfortable and precarious position. You are working for a guy who you are going to have to judge his ethical behavior when he does something wrong? Tough place of anyone to be. So they need a lot of structural changes and hopefully we will be able to do that using some more efficient systems of governance. Mr. Stupak. Thanks. Mr. Stearns. Thanks, gentlemen. The gentleman from Michigan. Mr. Upton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to thank you both and the witnesses following as well. And sadly for me, there are a number of different pressing scheduling conflicts. We have a mark-up downstairs in Energy and I have a briefing over on the Capitol floor. I just want to say that what you have said underscores the need for a fix and I know that we can work together. And I have the greatest confidence in Bill Martin to provide us the best and most honest advice so that we can, in fact, do what every American wants us to do. And I appreciate your help on this and look forwards to your continued leadership. And yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Stearns. Thank you, gentleman. Anyone else wish to ask questions to colleagues? Barbara? Ms. Cubin. No, thank you. Mr. Stearns. Okay. Thank you very much for your time and we appreciate your thoughts. If now the second panel will come forward. We have two members who want to introduce two of the people. I will allow them to do so and I will mention the other individuals. Rachel Godino, Chair, Athletes' Advisory Council, United States Olympic Committee, National Headquarters. Harvey Schiller. Dr. Schiller is President and Chief Executive Officer of Assante. He is 1 of the 5 persons of the task force that Senator McCain has put together. Robert Marbut, Chairman, National Governing Bodies' Council, United States Olympic Committee. Jim McCarthy, a member, board of directors, United States Olympic Committee, National Headquarters. I will let me, please have a seat and I will let my colleague, Fred Upton, introduce the acting chairman. Mr. Upton. Mr. Chairman, you don't know how much I appreciate introducing an amazing blue guy to a Florida guy after the Orange Bowl win on January 1. And as I had the great privilege of saying such to your Governor, Jeb Bush, when he testified on Medicaid last week, as well, particularly in the big house, the committee hearing room downstairs. But I just want to say that Bill Martin has stepped in at the University of Michigan several years ago and there has not been a complaint out there. He has done a terrific job at bringing excellence back on the athletic field, but also the desire on academics as well. And he record in the private sector and now at the prestigious University of Michigan, is unparalleled. And even though he is in this spot, as President of the USOC, almost by default, I guess you could say. This was not something that he was looking forward to. But he has spent an enormous amount of time. He has the respect of the committee that is there and certainly of me and so many different members. We welcome you and your testimony and look forward to working with you in the years ahead. Go blue. Mr. Stearns. I thank my colleague. The gentlelady from Wyoming. Ms. Cubin. Is this on? It is really my privilege to introduce a member of today's panel who hails from Star Valley, Wyoming. His run to, in 2000, to the Olympic gold, took him to a match with one of the, a man who some people consider one of the greatest athletes of our time in the heavyweight greco- roman wrestling event. And Rulon, in an upset, upsetting to everyone on the Russian side, beat him, became a gold medal winner and certainly we are proud of him for that. Some, as I said, some people call it an upset, but I call it hard work, dedication and a never say die attitude that Rulon has and that he projects every place he goes. I want to tell you a little bit about him. I know him personally and Rulon was offered a lot of money after he won that to go into the WWF or WWE or whatever those things are that none of us watch. And a lot of money, more money than I have got. And he turned it down. And he said, you know, Barbara, he said, what good is that much money if I go home to Star Valley and I can't look anybody in the eye. And that is the kind of man that he is. And I am very proud to introduce our gold medalist winner, Rulon Gardner. Mr. Terry. Well the gentle lady yield for a minute. Mr. Gardner, will you state for the record where you went to college? Mr. Gardner. Well, first I started with Junior College in Idaho, and then of course big red, University of Nebraska. Mr. Terry. Thank you. Ms. Cubin. I left that out just so we could do that. Mr. Stearns. I thank my colleagues. I welcome all the panelists, and Mr. Martin, we will let you start. STATEMENTS OF WILLIAM C.

Good morning and thank you Mr. Chairman, and Congressman Upton, thank you for those very embarrassing comments you made about me. But I sure do appreciate it. Members of the committee, my name is Bill Martin. I am the Director of Athletics at the University of Michigan and I am serving as Acting President of the United States Olympic Committee. My experience at Michigan appears to be a parallel of what I am facing at the USOC as its volunteer leader. I came to the position as Athletic Director after spending my professional life in private business. The University's Athletic Program was in need of financial and organizational reform and I was asked to bring to that test the skills and experience that I gained from business. I am now being asked to participate in a similar process at the United States Olympic Committee. While the USOC has many challenges that certainly need to be addressed, at its core it is a magnificent organization who has dedicated, professional staff and committed volunteers performing in the highest tradition of the Olympic ideal. Look back just a year ago to Salt Lake City where American athletes captured an unprecedented 34 medals. Today, in spite of the unsettling events of the past 8 weeks, the important work of the USOC and our national governing bodies continues without disruption, in a world class manner befitting our athletes. They have not missed a single training session and access to critical support areas, such as coaching, sports science, sports medicine, training facilities and residence centers has not been impacted. In competitions across the spectrum of summer and winter sports, American athletes are distinguishing themselves, and in so doing raising hopes and expectations for similar successes in the Pan Am Games this summer, in the Olympic Games in Athens next year. Not allowing the recent events to become a distraction, is a true credit not only to the athletes but also to the dedicated men and women of the USOC and NGB who work to support them. The success of American athletes, however, does not permit us to escape the hard truth that events over the past few months have been an embarrassment to the organization, a disappointment to Congress and the American people who have entrusted to the USOC the privilege of conducting America's Olympic affairs. The good that has been and continues to be accomplished by the USOC has been obscured and attention has been shifted from America's athletes to our organizational gymnastics. Immediate attention and corrective action is required. Let me briefly outline what I see as the major challenges and what we are doing to correct them. Three inter-related areas lie at the base of the organizations recent difficulty. USOC management, structure and accountability. Almost equally important is the need to identify and agree on the USOC's mission, or more realistically agree on how to balance the many and often competing missions of the USOC as demanded by ourselves, our constituent organizations, Congress and the American people. The USOC is governed by a 122-person board of directors that meets but twice a year and a 23-person executive committee that sets policy, hires management and tends to the day-to-day affairs. The USOC board is headed by a volunteer President elected by the board. The responsibilities of the President are a bit unclear and seem to vary from incumbent to incumbent. But it is primarily a policy versus a management position. One function that is not the responsibility of the President, however, is the management of the permanent USOC professional staff, most of whom are located at USOC Headquarters in Colorado Springs. The staff and a budget of nearly $125 million a year are managed by a CEO who is hired and supervised by the executive committee. As you are probably aware, that position was recently vacated. Historically, there have been too often tensions between the President and the CEO. Congress established the USOC as a private entity that is to receive its funding, not from the Federal Treasury, but from private sources, such as payment for domestic broadcast rights, sponsorship revenues, licensing fees and so forth. Originally, the USOC's principle responsibility was to field teams for the Olympic and Pan Am Games, to which was added, by amendment in 1998, responsibility for the Paralympic Games, as well. But there are numerous other responsibilities enumerated in the Act, as well as that range from the obligation for coordinating and providing technical information on physical training to promoting grass-roots developments of amateur athletic programs. Frequently, these mandated responsibilities come into conflict with one another and certainly put them in competition for the USOC's fixed resources, which as just noted, must be generated privately. Since it is Congress to which we are ultimately accountable, the USOC needs Congress to tell us exactly what it considers are mission should or should not be. What it should not be, however, is really what brings us to this hearing today. By the USOC's conduct of this last year, it appears to be an organization in turmoil, although, as previously noted, its routine operations and athlete development and support programs are continuing uninterrupted. While I believe that the public picture is somewhat distorted, the perception is as serious an indictment as its reality, and I am embarrassed for the organization for which I have respect and affection. But I also recognize the gravity of both perception and reality and have committed to a program of remedial action that includes the following. First, a governance and ethics review task force has been appointed to study and make recommendations addressing a variety of issues ranging from ethical behavior to a new governance structure. Second, at the request of the Senate Commerce Committee, the USOC agreed to a proposal for a creation of an independent council, that the USOC will fund, of distinguished Americans who will examine all aspects of the USOC's operation and structure and submit a report containing recommendations for remedial action to the appropriate committees of the House and Senate, as well as the USOC. And third, the USOC has received and will accept the most generous offer from long-time Olympic supporter, David D'Alessandro, CEO of Olympic sponsor, John Hancock, for the conduct by a recognized national accounting firm of a comprehensive audit of the USOC's accounting and business practices. I and my colleagues are embarrassed that there is even a question about the adequacy of the USOC's ethical standards and reporting practices, because this organization, more than any other, not only should stand upon the foundation of the highest ethical principles, but should serve as an example of integrity to all Americans, particularly the young. I hope and trust that you Members of Congress would join us in this restorative effort and suggest two areas where you can be of particular assistance. We need your help in defining and focusing the USOC's missions and responsibilities. We need clear and consistent guidance regarding what Congress expects the USOC to do, and how it expects us to do it. Second, we need Congress' help in developing and implementing an organizational plan that will convert the USOC's government apparatus into a more professional and streamlined body that can better serve America's Olympic athletes and America's Olympic interests. I thank you for your support and look forward to having you as an active partner as we jointly move forward to restore America's Olympic organization to its position of prominence and effectiveness that this Congress and the American people expect and deserve. [The prepared statement of William C. Martin follows.] Prepared Statement of William C. Martin, Acting President, United States Olympic Committee Good morning Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee. My name is Bill Martin. I am the Director of Athletics at the University of Michigan and I am serving as the Acting President of the United States Olympic Committee. My experience at the University of Michigan appears to be a parallel of what I am facing at the USOC as its volunteer leader. To a certain degree I am serving in a volunteer capacity as the Michigan Athletic Director, inasmuch as I came to the position not in a continuation of a career in athletics, but after spending my professional life in private business. The University's athletic program was in need of financial and organizational reform and I was asked to bring to that task the skills and experience that I gained from business. I am now being asked to participate in a similar process at the United States Olympic Committee. I have only been a member of the executive leadership of the USOC for a few months. I was elected a Vice President last November and then succeeded to the Presidency on an acting basis five weeks ago. I have, however, been involved with the organization for many years because of my association with the Olympic sport of sailing, whose National Governing Body, a member organization of the USOC, is the U.S. Sailing Association. I have been involved with U.S. Sailing for over twenty years and served as its president. Consequently, I have both an outsider's as well as a new insider's view of the USOC and have some definite opinions about the USOC. While the USOC has many challenges that certainly need to be addressed, at its core it is a magnificent organization whose dedicated professional staff and committed volunteers are performing in the highest tradition of the Olympic ideal. Look back just a year ago to Salt Lake City where American athletes captured an unprecedented thirty-four medals. Today, despite the unsettling events of the past eight weeks, the important work of the United States Olympic Committee and our National Governing Bodies continues, without disruption, and in a world-class manner befitting our athletes. They have not missed a single training session, and access to critical support areas such as coaching, sports science, sports medicine, training facilities, and residence centers has not been impacted. In competitions across the spectrum of summer and winter sport, American athletes are distinguishing themselves and in so doing, raising hopes and expectations for similar successes in the Pan American Games this summer, and the Olympic Games in Athens next year. Not allowing the recent events to become a distraction is a true credit not only to the athletes, but also to the dedicated men and women of the USOC and NGB's who work to support them. The success of America's athletes, however, do not permit us to escape the hard truth that events over the last few months have been an embarrassment to the organization, and a disappointment to this Congress and the American people who have entrusted to the USOC the privilege of conducting America's Olympic affairs. The good that has been and continues to be accomplished by the USOC has been obscured, and attention has been shifted from America's athletes to our organizational gymnastics. Immediate attention and corrective action is required. Let me briefly outline what I see as the major challenges and what we are doing to correct them. Three interrelated areas lie at the base of the organization's current difficulty: USOC management, structure, and accountability. Almost equally important is the need to identify and agree on the USOC's mission, or, more realistically, agree on how to balance the many and often competing missions of the USOC as demanded by ourselves, our constituent organizations, Congress, and the American people. The USOC is governed by a 123-person board of directors that meets but twice a year. Meeting on a more frequent basis--every two months-- is a 23-member Executive Committee that sets policy, hires the executive leadership of the USOC, and attends to more immediate issues that cannot await semi-annual action by the full board. One Member of Congress rhetorically asked how, with governing entities of such an unwieldy size, the USOC ever accomplishes anything. The answer is that we do, but it is a struggle. But in addition to the size of these governing boards, challenges arise because of their composition. Unlike a typical corporate board of the type with which I am most familiar, the USOC governing boards are comprised almost exclusively of ``insiders,'' that is, people who represent USOC constituent organizations and often place priority on their narrow constituent interests. These are all fine people but one would expect a greater representation of independent board members with no association with the USOC and any branch of what we refer to as the ``Olympic Family.'' The USOC Board of Directors is headed by a volunteer President elected by the Board, the office that I am filling on an interim basis. The responsibilities of the President are a bit unclear and seem to vary from incumbent to incumbent, but it is primarily a policy versus a management position, with additional responsibilities dealing with representation of the USOC internationally. One function that is definitely not the responsibility of the President, however, is the management of the permanent USOC professional staff, most of whom are located at USOC headquarters in Colorado Springs. The staff, and a budget of nearly $125 million a year, are managed by a Chief Executive Officer who is hired and supervised by the Executive Committee. As you are probably aware, that position was recently vacated. Historically, there have too often been tensions between the USOC's CEO and its President. Having a CEO accountable to a 23-person Executive Committee and a 123-person Board, and to myriad other committees and constituencies, is an invitation either to chaos, or to no accountability at all, either of which can spell disaster for an organization. But this leads to the next question of the accountability of the USOC to Congress. The USOC is chartered by Congress through legislation enacted in 1978, ``The Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act,'' that sets forth certain rights, privileges, and obligations of the organization. As the entity recognized by the International Olympic Committee as the National Olympic Committee for the United States, it is also subject to the same provisions of the Olympic Charter as are the 199 other National Olympic Committees for the countries each represents. Such provisions are far ranging, including, for example, the requirement that National Governing Bodies affiliated with sports on the program of the Olympic Games must constitute a voting majority on a National Olympic Committee's Board of Directors. Congress established the USOC as a private entity that is to receive its funding not from the federal treasury, but from private sources such as payments for domestic broadcast rights, and from sponsorship revenues, licensing fees, and individual contributions. Originally, the USOC's principal responsibility was to field teams for the Olympic and Pan American Games, to which was added by amendment in 1998 responsibility for the Paralympic Games as well. But there are numerous other responsibilities enumerated in the Act as well that range from the obligation for coordinating and providing technical information on physical training, to promoting grass-roots development of amateur athletic programs. Frequently these mandated responsibilities come into conflict with one another, and certainly put them in competition for the USOC's fixed resources which, as just noted, must be generated privately. All of this comes down to the question of just what Congress, to whom we are ultimately accountable, wants the USOC to do. Unfortunately, it seems that individual Members have differing views on what our mission should be as evidenced by a hearing conducted eight years ago in which we were heavily criticized for devoting too much attention to elite programs, and not enough to grass roots development. But in that same year legislation was introduced that would require us to undertake major new responsibilities for elite disabled athlete programs. However, there was no accompanying provision for financial assistance that would enable the USOC to perform this task. Consequently, to fulfill this new Congressional mandate the USOC would have had to divert resources from other areas, such as grass roots development. I realize that the matter of priorities is something with which you elected representatives have to deal every day, and if you choose a course contrary to your constituents' interests you may pay the price at the polling place the following November. It is somewhat the same for us, and we have nearly as many competing constituency groups as each of you. But I raise this matter merely to demonstrate that since it is this Congress to which we are ultimately accountable, the USOC needs Congress to tell us exactly what it considers our mission should or should not be. ``What it should not be,'' however, is really what brings us to this hearing today. By the USOC's conduct of this last year it appears to be an organization in turmoil although, as previously noted, its routine operations and athlete development and support programs are continuing uninterrupted. While I believe that the public picture is somewhat distorted, the perception is as serious an indictment as its reality, and I am embarrassed for the organization for which I have respect and affection. But I also recognize the gravity of both the perception and the reality and have committed to a program of remedial action that includes the following: 1. A Governance and Ethics Review Task Force has been appointed to study and make recommendations addressing a variety of issues ranging from ethical behavior to a new governance structure. Many of the Task Force's recommendations can and will be instituted administratively, others may require legislative changes to the Amateur Sports Act, and still others will have to await the recommendations of an independent review commission that will be submitting its own report on or before June 30th of this year. 2. At the request of the Senate Commerce Committee the USOC agreed to a proposal for the creation of an independent panel, that the USOC will fund, of distinguished Americans who will examine all aspects of the USOC's operations and structure and submit a report containing recommendations for remedial action to the appropriate committees of the House and Senate, as well as to the USOC. Because of its independent posture our interaction with the panel will only be at their invitation, but I have communicated the USOC's pledge to cooperate fully in whatever way we are asked. 3. The USOC has received and will accept a most generous offer from long-time Olympic supporter David D'Alessandro, CEO of Olympic Sponsor John Hancock, for the conduct by a recognized national accounting firm of a comprehensive audit of the USOC's accounting and business practices. I and my colleagues are embarrassed that that there is even a question about the adequacy of the USOC's ethical standards and reporting practices because this organization, more than most any other, not only should stand upon the foundation of the highest ethical principles but should serve as an example of probity and integrity to all Americans, particularly the young. Newspaper accounts of recent days and months belie that notion but I still believe that the transgressions that besmirched the USOC's reputation were exceptions. Nevertheless, I and my colleagues are committed to doing all that we can to restore the USOC's reputation for integrity, and returning it to a position that is as deserving of respect and support as are the young men and women we have the honor to serve. I hope and trust that you Members of Congress will join us in this restorative effort, and suggest two areas where you can be of particular assistance: 1. We need your help in defining and focusing the USOC's mission and responsibilities. As previously discussed, the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act sets forth a variety of areas for which we are responsible but sets no priorities, and offers no assistance for addressing them. We need clear and consistent guidance regarding what Congress expects the USOC to do, and how it expects us to do it. 2. We need Congress' help in developing and implementing an organizational restructuring plan that will convert the USOC's governance apparatus into a more professional and streamlined body that can better serve America's Olympic athletes, and Olympic interests. This will require some fundamental changes that may be painful to some of the USOC's current leaders and constituents, but with Congress' assistance and support the overall Olympic Movement will ultimately be better for it. I thank you for your support, and look forward to having you as active partners as we jointly move forward to restore America's Olympic organization to the position of prominence and effectiveness that this Congress and the American people expect and deserve. Mr. Stearns. Mr. Martin, thank you. I just wanted to tell the panel, we have a, Mr. Ridge is giving a security briefing now, and most of the members went to that. I have decided to continue the hearing. I know many of you came from out of town and I want to get your opening statements and questions on record. Many of them probably will come back after noon, but I just want to alert that to you. So, and also I just remind all of you, our opening statements are generally 5 minutes. And so you will see that red light after 5 minutes, just for your information. And we welcome Ms. Godino. STATEMENT OF RACHEL GODINO Ms. Godino. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today about the Olympic movement in the United States and for your interest in this topic, particularly as our Nation faces the prospect of war. My name is Rachel Mayer Godino. I am a 1992 Olympian in the sport of figure skating and I serve as the elected chairperson of the Athletes' Advisory Council, the AAC of the United States Olympic Committee, the USOC. The AAC is composed of Olympic, Pan American, and Paralympic athletes who are democratically elected by their peers to represent the interests and protect the rights of America's athletes. It is truly an honor to represent and lead such a distinguished group. I imagine the question of whether the USOC's organizational structure impedes its mission has been raised, in part, because of the conflicting images of the USOC. On the one hand, it is a troubled organization. There are the recent ethical issues, questions about financial reporting and the revolving door in the positions of leadership at the USOC. On the other hand, are America's athletes. They have performed phenomenally, winning 97 medals in Sidney, 34 medals in Salt Lake City, and they have continued to be extremely successful in the 13 months since Salt Lake. Great athletic performance and dysfunctional bureaucracy. Which one of these is the true reflection of the USOC. The answer is both, today. The USOC is doing some things right. First, the USOC continues to help American athletes achieve their Olympic dreams. Second, the USOC has improved its ability and the ability of each national governing body to target dollars and resources where they will most impact athletic performance. The positive results of that are being seen on the field of play. Third, the USOC is protecting athletes' rights. Part of the genesis of the 1978 Amateur Sports Act was the lack of protection for athletes' rights. The processes and principles incorporated into the USOC constitution as a result of that 1978 Act, have been used and tested repeatedly since their inception. They have proved to be so successful, that consideration should be given to codifying these principles in the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act. Last, athletes, defined in the Act as those who have competed in the Olympic, Pan American or Paralympic Games or the World Championships in the last 10 years, bring a unique voice and perspective to both USOC and the NGBs. And both NGBs and athletes, those who know and live sport, should continue to have a meaningful voice in the governance of the USOC, and continue to have some forum for debate, such as that provided by the AAC today. The USOC can also be improved in many ways. First, the USOC faces the challenges of fulfilling many diverse purposes and serving many stakeholders identified in the Act and in the USOC organic documents, which limited resources. Many people have described the USOC as trying to be all things to all people. But given limited resources, choices must be made. The USOC cannot be all things to all people. Is the primary goal to win the medal count at the Olympic Games? What about the Paralympic and the Pan Am Games? What about promoting sport for all? To date, neither the USOC nor Congress has effectively answered these fundamental questions. An analogy can be made to an athlete training. The elite athlete has one ultimate goal, to win an Olympic medal. In order to meet that goal, the athlete must make choices. Delaying education and job opportunities, moving away from family and friends, all to attain the ultimate goal. The choices are difficult, but they must be made. The USOC today lacks this laser focus and the political will to make difficult decisions. Furthermore, all of the groups represented on the board of directors are there because they are identified as having a stake in the Olympic movement. But the lack of clear priorities leads to an ineffective decisionmaking process and fights over limited resources. I am sure that all of you can relate to the frustrations and inefficiencies of resources being doled out based on personal agendas, rather than principle decisionmaking. Overall, the USOC structure should promote operating in the best interest of the organization, rather than in the interest of a particular member or group. And going forward, a distinction must be made between representation for purposes of input, and representation for purposes of decisionmaking. Second, the rules and responsibilities of the staff, vis-a-vis the volunteers, must be defined and implemented. Third, similar to the USOC, the structure of NGBs can be made more efficient and streamlined. If economies and scales can be realized with the NGBs, additional resources can be directed to athletic performance. Fourth, even with a perfect organizational structure, leadership is about people. Selecting the right people for the leadership positions is critical for future success. Fifth, a system of accountability should be implemented. Board review processes and increased transparency are a place to start. And last, as noted earlier, the USOC is one of the only countries in the world that does not receive direct government funding. Instead, the USOC relies on corporate sponsors, television and private donors. These dollars are largely contributed so that companies and people can be associated with the Olympics and Olympic athletes. However, the dollars raised must fulfill many objectives beyond helping U.S. Olympic athletes. The revenue models should be examined, particularly with respect to fulfillment of objectives outside of helping U.S. Olympic athletes achieve sustained competitive excellence. So in sum, does the USOC's organizational structure impedes its mission? The short answer is yes. The recent attention has potentially, has provided a potentially powerful and positive impact, forcing the organization to make change. I am confident that the ongoing reform process, through the internal USOC commission and through the commission appointed at the direction of the Senate Commerce Committee, will create a USOC that is capable of enabling American athletes to reach their full potential. U.S. Olympic movement and its underlying ideas are resilient. Our athletes, the very reason the USOC exists, are strong and performing well. Setting new records on the field of play and continually striving to make Americans proud. Not only by their athletic excellence, but also by conducting themselves with honor and integrity. America's athletes continue to take pride in their efforts and we hope the American public will, as well. Thank you.
