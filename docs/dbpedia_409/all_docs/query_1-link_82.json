Whether it is tape or bandages raw fingers hurt scores.\n\nNice to see Frangilli still competing and holding his own after all these years.\n\nc365 Discussion starter\n\n955 posts ·\n\n#9 ·\n\nThanks for the info on Justin, I'm glad he's still shooting and owns a company. The way some articles talked of him when he got arrested for pot made it sound like Justin was done for. Yes that's the vid I saw w8lon first thing that caught my eye was Frangilli's glove and how his anchoring style hasn't changed a bit, also how thin he was then ...haha!.\n\nThat list of names brings back old memories limbwalker, another one is Terry Ragsdale\n\n5060 posts ·\n\n#10 ·\n\nAccording to Vittorio, Michele used the glove to help with a tendon injury. Once he was healed, he went back to a finger tab. I attach the quote below.\n\nGlove & stab story has been told many times... Anyway, problems to finger tendons appeared in 1995, and have been solved adding a glove. He used it till 1998 European target championships, but under sun, fingers were slipping inside the glove and this was giving some unconsistency to the release. So we changed to additional leather layers.\n\nIt was a choice to sacrify release smoothness to a longer life of hand tendons.\n\nChris\n\n1 post ·\n\n#11 ·\n\nFrom a quick google search....\n\nJustin Huish (born January 9, 1975 in Fountain Valley, California) is an internationally known American archer. Growing up, his parents ran an archery pro shop, but Huish did not take up shooting until he was 14. He practiced by standing on a neighbor's lawn and shooting arrows across the street, through the front door of the garage, through the back door of the garage, and into a target in his backyard. When he was 15, he won his first local tournament. He made the U.S. archery team at 18.\n\nHuish won gold medals in the men's individual and team competitions at the 1996 Summer Olympics. He had a somewhat dramatic appearance, with wraparound shades, a backward baseball cap, a ponytail, and an earring. His performance was later credited with encouraging Geena Davis to take up archery.[1]\n\nHuish earned a spot to compete at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, but he was arrested on February 15, 2000, and charged with possession of marijuana for sale. He subsequently resigned his place on the Olympic team and was replaced by Rod White. Huish pleaded no contest in May 2001 and was sentenced to 120 days in jail, serving about three months of that in a work furlough program.\n\nHe tried out for the 2004 Olympics but failed to make the U.S. team.\n\nc365 Discussion starter\n\n955 posts ·\n\n#12 ·\n\nchrstphr and arrowskill thanks for the info.\n\n109 posts ·\n\n#13 ·\n\n********** is so willing to criticise-wonder who the USA archer was that threw his arrow into the blue if I recall correctly?? The only one there??\n\n81 posts ·\n\n#14 ·\n\nI don’t see how one can call another too critical of others whilst criticizing the same person.\n\nJust my thoughts, nothing more.\n\n25655 posts ·\n\n#15 ·\n\n15 years later and some people just won't let it go. LOL How sad.\n\n5060 posts ·\n\n#16 ·\n\nWell, there wasnt just the pot selling incident. There was the hate crime incident as well. Though it was later expunged by a judge, those types of things tend to linger as indicator of ones character even 20 some years later.\n\nChris\n\nShow more replies\n\n0 Reply\n\n412 posts ·\n\n#17 ·\n\nHe and I were alone on a target at 2004 Oly trials, was a fun shoot.\n\n25655 posts ·\n\n#18 ·\n\nI enjoyed shooting with him in '04. Wish I had been able to shoot with him more once I learned more about technique because I would have loved to study his technique close up.\n\n0 Reply\n\n547 posts ·\n\n#19 ·\n\nI didn't see it in this thread yet, but he placed 41 in quals with a 1247 at outdoor nationals. I heard he had only been shooting for a few weeks prior to the tournament. Pretty impressive to me.\n\nGot to meet him as well (Thanks Stonebraker!) and that was pretty cool!\n\n23478 posts ·\n\n#20 ·\n\nI only met him briefly at two nationals. I was part of the tournament staff for the O4 trials-which was held about 2 miles from my home. I met John Magera there-though we had communicated a bunch of times before that. Justin had nothing but good things to tell me about our shoot. In 99, I was shooting national outdoors at Miami for the first time. I was not shooting well and had some equipment problems -involving a rest that was failing. One of the guys on my target that day was Justin's cousin IIRC. I cannot remember his name-I think his initials were BB. I was trying to fix my rest between moving distances. The guy I was shooting with asked me what sort of poundage I was shooting and I told him as I was working on the rest. He comes back and says \"Justin's got a back up bow you're welcome to use-I just asked him\". I had fixed the rest by then and didn't need it. but I went up to Huish after I was done shooting, to thank him and he said something like-\"I didn't need it and it beats having someone having to drop out\"\n\nNow I know some archers and coaches I respect including the late former chair of JOAD , didn't have much use for the fellow, but all I can say was that my limited interaction with him was very positive. So I wish him well-I think I saw he shot the last nationals but I couldn't make it\n\n1869 posts ·\n\n#21 ·\n\nI spoke with him at Nationals and he was really nice and seemed generally reinvigorated with archery. Your past doesn’t have to and shouldn’t dictate your present or future. The guy I spoke with just seemed generally happy to be shooting and enjoying archery and life. We should all be so lucky.\n\n499 posts ·\n\n#22 ·\n\nCompetition Archery Media Speaks with Olympic Gold Medalist Justin Huish on Competition Archery Media Podcast\n\nCompetition Archery Media did a podcast with Justin Huish, the only U.S. archer in history to win two gold medals at a single Olympics.\n\nHuish won the men’s individual gold and was part of the men’s team that won gold, both at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Ga.\n\nIn the podcast with CAM, Huish talks about his rise to the top of the archery world. He also talks for the first time to a media outlet about his famous fall from that peak.\n\nHuish quit the 2000 U.S. Olympic team after he was arrested in California for possession of marijuana for sale.\n\nHe talks about the freak injury that preceded his arrest and his subsequent attempts to make a comeback, which extend to today. Huish finished 11th at the 2020 USA Archery Target Nationals and fifth at the 2020 U.S. Open in August.\n\n25655 posts ·\n\n#23 ·\n\nI'd say he's doing alright. For an \"old guy.\"\n\n23478 posts ·\n\n#24 ·\n\nI was a line judge at that shoot and was judging senior Ladies Recurve. Mike Plummer-seeded around 14th, took out the top seed and ended up beating Justin in the finals. The wind was brutal and Justin had a four on his last round which opened the door for Mike to win-and he did. Justin was seeded sixth. While the competition was obviously missing Brady, Jack and Jacob, most of the other top shooters were there\n\n25655 posts ·\n\n#25 ·\n\nIncidentally, Justin had a match vs. Mark Hainline at that event. I never got to know Mark but have heard nothing but good things about him from Vic and others. That must have been cool for those two.\n\nMichael has done remarkably well considering his limited draw length. He won some tough matches.\n\nShow more replies\n\n0 Reply\n\n1393 posts ·\n\n#26 ·\n\nHe’s shooting now at the USATs. I lost a shoot off to him at Texas Shootout last year. Nice guy and good shooter. I shot an 8 he shot a 9. I was happy to have forced the shoot off lol!\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk\n\n2084 posts ·\n\n#28 ·\n\nHey Jim,\n\nI happened to stumble onto the Buckeye Classic on utoob last night. That wind looked crazy and I was estimating that it was 18-25 mph (maybe gusting to 30mph) based on what I saw the flags doing. Any chance you happen to have an actual wind reading?\n\n3239 posts ·\n\n#32 ·\n\nThe wind was around 10mph out of the west during eliminations and was building slightly. We didn't stick around for the Gold medal matches, as a storm was due to blow in. I assume it did.\n\nMichael Plummer was outstanding and deserves recognition. From trying NTS to regaining his own form, with Glenn's guidance. That's some phenomenal stuff. If there were a gold medal for grit, Michael deserves it.\n\nAs for Justin, I have nothing but props. He's a pleasure to be around, with a great attitude, a competitive spirit and still plenty of game.\n\n1049 posts ·\n\n#35 ·\n\nI have never seen a pothead excel at anything. Not only does it relax you but it reduces motivation. You have to give a **** to achieve excellence.\n\nGreat athletes use their nerve rather than avoiding it.\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk\n\n499 posts ·\n\n#37 ·\n\nI have never seen a pothead excel at anything.

Definitely looked like the bad weather was either on the way in or on the way out.... I'm 200 miles east of Columbus and that stuff hit us early evening. The American flag was straight out and the banners were really whipping.\n\n499 posts ·\n\n#40 ·\n\nI am not saying they fought stoned. But if you can smoke the day before the fight to relax your jitters, that's a huge advantage.\n\nPlenty of fighters can't sleep before their big fight and have blamed their performance on that.\n\n367 posts ·\n\n#41 ·\n\nJustin Started shooting again last year competitively. He has been shooting all of the USA Archery tournaments. Pretty sure he just had a Silver medal finish last week in Ohio. I think his goal is 2024 Olympics."
