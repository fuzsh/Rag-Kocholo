Pace's first Worlds - he scored 1000 even on the second round.\n\nI see that pic of Myers holding the Black Widow as well, in the secong volume of the \"History of FITA\" books. BTW, the pic of Tomi on pg 947 shooting the EX is later than the 1980 games. And if you look closely on pg 962 you can see half my head (holding the flag).\n\nStash said:\n\nMyers won in '73, in that horrible wind/rain/mud.\n\nHighest round score for the 1973 event (either men or women) was 1117!!!

And if you look closely on pg 962 you can see half my head (holding the flag).\n\nI got all those books from an old gentleman who sold me his archery/sports collection-Randall Huffman (host of the 95 US field and numerous OHio fields on his soft friendly course [shot a 330 unmarked on it-my best ever].\n\nI received the pro archery book from Arlene Rhode and don rabska sent me the last FITA book. I recall those pictures. I will see where those books are-I have too much crap in the house -my dining room (now a den) had a nice table-piled high with bows and arrows!!\n\ntoxoph said:\n\nThanks Jim. Williams positively won with a Wing\n\nWhat I thought was a picture showing Williams shooting the Wing at Munich turned out to be a later picture, my bad\n\nlimbwalker said:\n\nTox, it's the archers that win the medals The bows just do their job\n\nJohn.\n\nTrue, I knew you were picking on me :smile: We all know the bows shoot far better than we do but I figured people knew what I meant plus it was easier to say then \"Bows that were being shot by an Olympic medalist\".\n\nNever tell a car manufacturer they didnt win a race or a bow manufacturer advertising agent they didnt win a gold medal!\n\nI dieing to update the list with all the great input here but I still dont have the edit button available. Im logged in and it says I can edit post at the bottom. Even the post I edited earlier is no longer available.\n\n\"If you have registered, you will be able to edit and delete your posts.

Your ability to edit your posts may also be time-limited, depending on how the administrator has set up the forum.\"\n\nFound this, guess Ill have to repost the list rather than updating the original :thumbs_do\n\nbsu_beginner said:\n\nhey, whatever happened to the avalon? I thought it was a phenomenal riser. Sigh... why can't some people just keep their hands off a good idea and not feel like they have to change things?\n\nthe first avalon had problems with hairline cracking or worse due to the hard angle that was machined up near the limb pocket. Hence the Avalon Plus. Some considered bolted on limb pockets passe or a concession that the maker couldn't make a straight riser (the avalon was the follow up to the radian-due to stress relief in the aluminum block during machining, many radians were crooked and hoyt couldn't or wouldn't or didn't employ the set screw feature of the sky (which prevents the use of true ILF limb bushings)\n\nOnce things \"got better\" the \"need for limb pockets\" apparently waned and hence the ELAN-a really nice riser (I sold mine after we opened a shop and didn't initially get hoyt). The matrix replaced both bow risers. If you note, after the radian and sky came along in the early-mid 90's almost all the recurve machined risers were bolt on limb pockets-the avalon, the Centra, Universal and Zone by PSE, the original Merlin. You don't see many any more-I think the bernardini top line bow might-that have bolt on limb pockets-none of the WW none of the Spirgarelli's, no hoyts, not the martin, not the new PSE's not the Bests."
