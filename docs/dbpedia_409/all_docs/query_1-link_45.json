The Paralympic Games has men’s and women’s individual competition and the mixed team event for recurve open, compound open and W1 classes.\n\nButch Johnson is among Team USA’s most experienced Olympic archers, competing in five Olympic Games between 1992 and 2008. Olympian Lida Howell won three golds in 1904 St. Louis and Paralympian Jack Whitman claimed gold in Tokyo 1960 to become the first U.S. champions. Andre Shelby became both the first Navy veteran and the first Black athlete to medal in Paralympic archery, when he won gold at Rio 2016.\n\nIn celebration of Father’s Day, we look at more than 50 U.S. Olympian fathers whose children also competed for Team USA.\n\nThe first Black American archer to compete at the Paralympic Games, he was seeded 12th in the compound open tournament at Rio 2016 but captured the gold medal.\n\nThe United States led the medal count with 101 medals: 44 gold, 32 silver and 25 bronze.\n\nStarting with Rome 1960, he participated in five Paralympic Games and won 12 gold medals.\n\nArchery legend, Jack Whitman, won Team USA’s first Paralympic gold. See Whitman’s bow and other artifacts on display at the Museum.\n\nJames L. Easton served as president of the World Archery Federation for 16 years and was vice president of the International Olympic Committee from 2002 to 2006.\n\nRelive Team USA highlights from the London 2012 Paralympic Games.\n\nRelive Team USA highlights from the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Paralympic Games."
