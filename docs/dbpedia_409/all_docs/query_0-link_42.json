This year, the U.S. will attend two out of the three tournaments. The European Grand Prix will take place in Porec, Croatia May 4-10, Evry, France May 27-31 and Antalya, Turkey June 17-21.

Sheri Rhodes will be the women's coach in Turkey, and Frank Thomas will be the men's coach.\n\nThe USA Archery Grand Prix Teams are determined by the rolling ranking. The rolling ranking is a system of ranking used for Recurve archers, which calculates each archer's 18 arrow match average from their best four tournaments within a ranking period. There are generally 4-6 ranking periods throughout the calendar year. The rolling ranking is a part of the Special Athlete Support Program (SASP).

Growth hormone can increase red blood cell mass and elevate blood pressure in the brain, but the EPO probably caused the patient's clot, Dr. Jose Manuel Martinez Lage, lead author on the report, told Reuters Health. poetin, or EPO as it is commonly known, is a lab-created version of the natural hormone erythropoietin. This hormone helps spur the production of red blood cells, and EPO is used in medicine to treat some cases of severe anemia. The substance has become a favorite among endurance athletes including distance cyclists and runners because the increase in red blood cells allows more oxygen to be delivered to working muscles. But this boost in blood cells can also thicken the blood to the point of increasing the user's risk of heart attack or stroke. EPO use has been blamed in the deaths of around 20 European cyclists since the late 1980s.\n\nAccording to Lage and his colleagues at the Clinica Universitaria de Navarra in Pamplona, Spain, their case illustrates how EPO, in combination with other factors such as dehydration from heavy exertion, can have \"serious side effects\" in healthy individuals. The patient first came to them with a headache that had persisted for 2 months and worsened during a competition the previous week. He admitted to using EPO every couple of days for the past 3 months, along with the growth hormone and vitamins. Brain scans revealed the blood clot, and the patient was treated successfully with blood-thinning drugs over several months.\n\nRick Mack\n\nExecutive Director\n\nUSA Archery\n\nphone: 719-866-4550\n\nfax: 719-632-4733\n\ne-mail: rmack@usarchery.org\n\nJUNIOR and SENIOR USAT NAMED (8/24/2001) Due to length, this is a separate page\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE DATE: June 23, 2001 CONTACT: Bill Kellick (719) 578-4621\n\nKaren Scavotto Places Fifth at European Grand Prix Archery Tournament in Turkey\n\nAntalya Turkey  2000 Olympian Karen Scavotto (Enfield, Conn.) finished in fifth place on Friday at the XIV Golden Arrow Grand Prix Tournament in Antalya, Turkey on Thursday.
