        "text": "2004 Summer Olympics\n\nAt the 2004 Olympics, he was surprisingly eliminated by Ron van der Hoff with 135-145 in the round of 64, placing 52nd overall in men's individual archery. He later placed 4th as a member of the United States team.\n\n2008 Summer Olympics\n\nAt the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing Johnson finished his ranking round with a total of 653 points. This gave him the 40th seed for the final competition bracket in which he faced Andrey Abramov in the first round. Both scored 109 points in the regular match and they had to go to an extra round. In this extra round Abramov scored 25 points, while Johnson advanced to the second round with 26 points. There he faced eight seeded Im Dong-Hyun, who was too strong with 115-106.\n\nTogether with Brady Ellison and Vic Wunderle he also took part in the team event. With his 653 score from the ranking round combined with the 664 of Ellison and the 652 of Wunderle the Americans were in 10th position after the ranking round. In the first round they were not able to win against Chinese Taipei that won the confrontation by 222-218.\n\nAfter the Olympics\n\nToday, Butch Johnson has maintained himself as one of the best recurve shooters in the country, has ranked in the top five in the United States and placed sixth in the 2012 U.S. Olympic Team Trials. Amid speculation that he would retire following the Trials, Johnson came back to finish second in the 2012 National Target Championships and won a silver medal in the 2012 Hoyt World Open, second only to number one world ranked archer Brady Ellison. He reportedly plans to continue competing, and has not ruled out a run at the 2016 Olympic Team."
