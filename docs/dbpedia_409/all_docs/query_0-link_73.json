        "text": "Primitive man with his need to survive viewed nature as a means to thrive. If he could harness her power and control her energy he could better shape his destiny so early man, in his primitive ways, discovered a dance full of elegance and grace.\n\nMan shaped wood to symmetrically bend and held her captive with a string attached at each end. An arrow at rest he placed on the string. Then drawing with leverage, he forced her to bend.\n\nWith control he held and focused on a spot. The entire world became a blur, all but the dot. With nature defied he steadied his hold then gentle as a dove the string he let go. Man yielded his grasp freeing the wood and forward it cast, but not before paying the toll of force. The limbs crashed forward the string in tow and energy was transferred to an arrow at rest. The point resisted as the energy searched for somewhere to go. The shaft yielded and bowed in an arch. The nock then broke free and the arrow flexed. The projectile was in flight and man’s earliest attempts to control nature stepped in.\n\nFeathers affixed to the shaft caught wind and began to spin. With each rotation the flexing subsided and flight became clean, but all of Mother Nature’s gifts come with a price. Air forced across the feathers clung like glue. Drag was her name and speed she withdrew. Nature was not finished, her constant card she played. Gravity pushed hard and the arrow was forced to yield. Mother Nature she smiled content she had won, but the object she fought for suddenly ended her flight. With the energy that remained she drove deep in the bale after tearing the paper in the center gold dot. Man, he beamed with the result he achieved and Mother Nature she approved of an arrow well shot. The dance was completed with mutual respect. Man used nature for her power to project. Nature approved for perfection was complete.\n\nSome say we take all the fun out of shooting a bow. We’re too serious.\n\n“Just shoot and enjoy it. Quit making it work,” they say.\n\nWhat they do not know is that the pursuit of perfection, albeit unobtainable, is pleasurable for many of us. The journey, marked by incremental points of progress, brings unrivaled satisfaction to many archers, me included. The poet Longfellow remarked, “We judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing, while others judge us by what we have already done.” We strive to DO, that others might see what is possible, with an eye ever focused on the possibilities that exist within our potential. If all of us realized our true potential we might strive harder to obtain a higher level of performance.\n\nI view archery as a world with dew still on it, full of wonder and possibility. With each new arrow placed on the string there is opportunity. If I but do my part it will hit its mark and satisfaction unfeigned will be my reward. How could one ever question the pleasure obtained with a perfectly shot arrow, or the journey we took to transform what was once a possibility into a reality?\n\nNo baseball player likes to be placed on the disabled list. It can lead to frustration and depression. Archery is no different. You practice hard and set goals for the year. You aggressively pursue those goals and then you notice a twinge, soreness, and soon pain. In the spring of 2011, I changed grips on my recurve. I went to a very flat, low wrist grip, which produced great results from the start. The bow really jumped off my hand towards the target, but it changed the geometry in my hand and arm. This grip put more heel into the bow and my hand was turned up, which somewhat flexed my forearm and set my arm so that any shock went from my hand to my elbow. After a month or so I noticed some soreness in my elbow right on a tendon. I iced it and continued to shoot. It worsened but it didn’t hurt when I shot, only afterwards when I would grasp things.\n\nI managed to limp it out through the IBO World Championships in August and managed to shoot well and win there. When I returned home I knew that the only thing I had to prepare for was deer season so it was a good time for a break. I saw the doctor and we decided to inject the elbow with a corticosteroid. It worked instantly. I felt relief and was able to rest. I shot different bows until the spring of 2012 and then went back to my recurve but this time with a high wrist grip. The pain soon returned. It’s been 10 months since the injection but now it’s worse than before the first shot. I was planning to head to Erie for the 2nd Leg of the IBO National Triple Crown but now that is not possible. Traditional Worlds is 6 weeks away and I’m injured. I got another injection this past Tuesday but the instant relief did not come this time. I am icing, stretching and doing rehab exercises but the jury is still out.\n\nI share this because as I have spoken with others about my injury I have found that many other archers suffer or have suffered with this same injury. It’s very difficult to heal due to constantly having to use these muscles. A couple of orthopedic surgeons have informed me about some procedures that have been successful but require more recovery time so that may be a fall option. Right now ice is my friend, compression, and exercises. Naturally depression and anger accompany being placed on the DL, but we are creatures of flesh and bone so we must deal with ever present aches and pains.\n\n“Son, you will play like you practice.”\n\n“No I won’t. I’ll turn it on come game day, Dad.”\n\nIf I had an arrow in my quiver for every time my father and I had this discussion I could open an arrow distribution center today. The fact is, Dad was right. If you practice halfheartedly then you will play halfheartedly. Archery is no different than fielding ground balls on the baseball diamond or running a pass pattern in football. If you “fling” arrows in practice then you will fling arrows at the shoot.\n\nI know there are some out there that will say, “I just want to shoot and have fun with the boys,” and that’s fine, but don’t be upset when you perform poorly at the monthly club shoot. We reinforce something every time we draw the string. The question is are we reinforcing something good or something bad. With each arrow we must focus on every aspect of the shot.\n\nEven when we meet with friends to walk the practice range it’s important that we step up to the stake, observe the terrain and ask: is it sloping, uphill or downhill. Is our footing level and if not what must we do to compensate. When we execute the shot it must have our full attention from draw through conclusion. When the shot is over we then ask ourselves if the arrow hit the intended spot and if it didn’t why. Did we estimate the distance wrong? Were we fooled by the presentation of the target? Was it a form issue? When we know the answer to these questions we can make mental notes to ensure that we aren’t fooled again or address the flaw in our shot execution.\n\nCertainly, this type of focus doesn’t have to take the fun out of shooting. Heck, it’s always fun when we hit what we are aiming at. What we must do is to be careful in our friendly outings. It’s easy to walk along conversing and joking and start flinging arrows at the target without much thought. We have to learn to turn that switch on when we step to the stake. Remember, every time we draw the string we are reinforcing something. What we reinforce is up to us. I suggest we practice how we want to play.\n\nHappy Shooting.\n\nReport by Reynold Sarns\n\nOn the weekend of May 19 and 20, the Whidbey Island Bowmen, located on beautiful Whidbey Island, Washington hosted the Washington State Archery Association’s State 3D Championship. A lot of effort went into grooming not only the 30 target trail, but also the practice range which accommodates practice from 20-80 yards and of course the camping area of over 25 acres. My personal thanks to the members of this excellent facility for all the hard work that was evident throughout this facility.\n\nArchers were not only challenged by the unmarked 3D course, which featured 2 elevated stand shots, several steep uphill, downhill and side hill shots, but also the beauty of being on an Island in the Puget Sound, including some spectacular views of the straights of Juan De Fuca. Eagles, owls with babies, and other raptors were patrolling the skies as we shot, watching closely for a squirrel, rabbit or mouse that might get flushed out for them. The 30 Rinehart 3D targets ranged from Grizzly bears, black bears, full sized elk, monster mule deer, and huge whitetail bucks, to Veloci-raptors, Hadrasaurs, and various smaller animals such as raccoons, bobcats and coyotes.\n\nAfter Saturday’s round, I expected a lot of high scores to roll in, as the course was setup well within the State distance maximums for each style and age group. With Adult compound, and FSLR/L shooting out to 50 yards, Youth/Traditional out to 40 yards, Cub out to 25, and Pewee to 15 yards. Well I guess making it what I thought should be easy, even fooled me. The most common statement of dismay was, “Wow, great course, sure deceived me”…. I will say we had made a lot of small changes in angles, tree removal and lengthening of our course, and for those who “knew” our course, it was a very different look than normal.\n\nOur scoring system for the WSAA is 10-8-5, with no 11 or 12 scored. Here are the results for the Traditional and Oly recurve classes:\n\nAdult Male\n\n1\n\nAM TRAD GRANT\n\nMACDONALD\n\n211\n\n208\n\n419\n\n2\n\nAM TRAD DON\n\nFABRAO\n\n203\n\n209\n\n412\n\nAM TRAD MIKE\n\nKYLE\n\n160\n\n175\n\n335\n\nAM TRAD KIRK\n\nRUTTER\n\n166\n\n148\n\n314\n\nAM TRAD PETER\n\nRUTTER\n\n166\n\n136\n\n302\n\nAM TRAD DARYL\n\nHAWES\n\n108\n\n138\n\n246\n\nAM TRAD SCOTT\n\nDUCKEN\n\n120\n\n0\n\n120\n\nAM TRAD JIM\n\nBOUMA\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nAM TRAD HUNTER\n\nBOUMA\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nAdult Female\n\n1\n\nAF TRAD ANASTASIA\n\nSAMUELSON\n\n79\n\n88\n\n167\n\nAF TRAD SERABEL\n\nJONES\n\n74\n\n74\n\n148\n\nOly Recurve\n\n1 SM FSLR/L REN\n\nSARNS\n\n205\n\n195\n\n400\n\n**** SM FSLR/L TOM\n\nSAMUELSON\n\n88\n\n64\n\n152\n\nThere was quite the shootout for 1st and 2nd between Grant Macdonald and Don Fabrao. Don always seems to take the 1st place hardware home. Day one was quite the match, as I shot with that group. From the 1st target you could see they were not only going to pull away from the others, but challenge each other at each stake. The scores went back and forth all day, with Grant ending with a good string of 10’s on the last several targets eeking out an 8-point lead. On day two Don brought his “A” game, similar to last years heroics, when he was down by 15 or so, and came back to win with some outstanding shooting. This year though Grant persevered, although Don made it tough, pulling even and even having a small lead at points throughout the 2nd day. Don actually outshot Grant by 1 point on Sunday, giving Grant the 7 point win and his first 3D State Championship, to go along with his 2 Indoor titles from this year.\n\nI normally shoot in the Senior Traditional division, however due to a lack of shooters this year, I switched to the Olympic style for this shoot, with the hopes of competing against some of the top NFAA FSLR/L shooters we have in our State. I also wanted to shoot from the longer stakes in preparation for the State Field and FITA Field. I stated that I was shooting my bow all dressed out, but left the site alone after the first 2 targets of the 1st day, and shot my normal GAP system, technically shooting Barebow Recurve. It worked as I set both the 1 day and 2 day State records for the FSLR/L (Olympic) style, pretty happy with a 400 total from 50 yards unmarked. I am really looking forward to the new NFAA Longbow class, as I will be shooting in that for some of the WSAA tourneys next year.\n\nSmiling faces were abundant as archers shook hands with excitement and began another year of 3D archery in Bedford, IN. As I approached the practice butts I saw Dave Wallace, Bill Swope, Jim Powell, John Demmer and Dewayne Martin, to name but a few, catching up on the archery news. Everyone was in high spirits as we prepared to begin the 2012 IBO National Triple Crown.\n\nWhat a great group of people we have in archery. There is always a collegial atmosphere despite everyone wanting to come out on top at the end of the weekend. We laughed and made fun of a few standout oddities debuting this weekend. I simply had to shoot my new Fox Triple Crown, but I didn’t have wood arrows tuned for it so I took my stiff-spined selfbow arrows with the intent to set my gap and then aim 6” right. It briefed well, and seemed reasonable while in Tennessee, but it didn’t execute well in Indiana. I thought I might be at the butt end of more jokes than anyone, and Dewayne Martin did his best to jab me at every opportunity, but John Demmer took the heat off of me with his bow.\n\nJohn said he had tired of trying to explain to bowyers what he wanted in a bow so he decided to build his own recurve. It was far from finished but that didn’t deter him from shooting it. The tape was still on the limbs and the riser had been cut out with a band saw and then filed down……a little. He had no shelf material and no strike plate. The arrow slapped the riser as it took off, sounding like a .22 rifle, and then his arrow porpoised itself to the target. You might think I’m overly critical, but John got the last laugh as he beat me.\n\nNow to the good shooting; Randy Irvine opened with a monster 200 on the first day’s 20 targets in the longbow class. On a very tough course Randy set the standard for all to follow. Unfortunately, he hit a roadblock on day two when he had a bow malfunction with 12 targets remaining, but that didn’t slow the former World Champion down. Randy finished strong with a monster 385. Last year’s winner, Dave Wallace, finished second with a 344.\n\nIn the Recurve Unaided class Mark Lynde was at the top of his game. Mark transitioned to stringwalking this spring and took to it like a duck to water. He opened with a 191 on the first 20 and came back with a 186 on day two to keep his National Triple Crown streak of wins alive with a total score of 377. I hope to join Mark in the RU class at Erie for leg 2.\n\nBig Jim Powell was steady and solid as usual in the TRAD class. He beat DeWayne Martin 343 to 323 to win at Bedford yet again. Zach Stoner of Virginia was the lone youth TRAD shooter. Zach is also last year’s IBO Trad World Champion.\n\nOn the women’s side, Jenifer Stoner, the 2011 IBO Traditional World Champion, two-time NFAA National Indoor Champion and 2011 NAA Indoor National Champ, shot in her first National Triple Crown and made a huge statement shooting a 335. Jennifer spent the past week tuning some arrows to shoot off the shelf on her new Trad Tech Titan III. I think she got it all figured out.\n\nSo we are under way in the 2012 IBO National Triple Crown. We sincerely hope that you can find a way to join us at Leg 2. We had 46 traditional shooters at leg 1 and have plenty of room for more.\n\nFor full results go to this link: National Triple Crown Leg 1 Results\n\nThe first leg of the IBO National Triple Crown is this weekend (May 18-20) at Bedford, IN. Archers can expect a great year of shooting with the IBO. The National Triple Crown will debut the Traditional Team Competition for the first time this year.\n\nIn the longbow class Dave Wallace opened with a win at this shoot last year and went on to sweep all three rounds thus winning the Triple Crown, Traditional Worlds and the regular worlds. In the male traditional class Jim Powell swept all three legs and then went on to win the regular Worlds in New York. Fawn Girard opened with wins in the first two legs of the Triple Crown, but Vivian Bryant stopped her streak by winning the third leg by 2 points. Mark Lynde swept all three legs in the Recurve Unaided class.\n\nIn 2012 Dave, Jim, Mark, Fawn and Vivian will all be back to defend their wins, but new as well as familiar faces will be at Bedford to try and put up respectable marks of their own. IBO Indoor 3D World Champion and ASA winner in Augusta, Dewayne Martin will be competing in the Trad Class; as well as last years ASA Shooter of the Year, Dan Haire. I’m excited to be heading to Bedford myself on Friday and hope to see some of you there as well. Best of luck shooters!"
