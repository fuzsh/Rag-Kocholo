        "text": "Capsules of Tuesday's events at the Summer Olympics:\n\nARCHERY\n\nAmericans Butch Johnson and Justin Huish advanced to the third round in the men's individual competition with two victories each. A third American, Rod White, won in the first round but was eliminated in round two.\n\nMeanwhile, the world's No. 1 archer, Martinus Grove of Norway, eliminated the 1992 Olympic gold medalist, Sebastien Flute of France.\n\nBADMINTON\n\nBang Soo-hyun of South Korea, the 1992 women's silver medalist, and Indonesia's Mia Audina advanced to the women's final. Dong Jiong of China and Denmark's Paul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen will play for the men's gold medal.\n\nBASEBALL\n\nTravis Lee hit the 100th homer of the tournament as the United States completed round-robin play with a 17-1 victory over the Netherlands. The United States (6-1) finished second behind unbeaten Cuba. Cuba has a record 28 homers, the United States is next with 27. In the first Olympics with baseball as a medal sport, 1992, only 45 homers were hit during preliminary play.\n\nJapan beat Italy 12-1 and moved into the medals round. Japan will play the United States Thursday. Cuba will play Nicaragua in the other first-round game.\n\nBASKETBALL (MEN)\n\nThe semifinals will pit the Dream Team against surprising Australia and Yugoslavia vs. Lithuania.\n\nThe Dream Team beat Brazil - and legendary Olympian Oscar Schmidt - 98-75 behind a typically balanced attack. Anfernee Hardaway scored 14 points, Scottie Pippen 13, Reggie Miller 12 and Shaquille O'Neal 11. Pippen's defense on Schmidt, who had 26 points but only seven in the second half, also was a factor. It was the last stand for the 38-year-old Schmidt, the only Olympian with 1,000 career points.\n\nTony Ronaldson's four-point play with 34 seconds to play helped Australia upset Croatia 73-71 in the quarterfinals. Andrew Gaze scored 26 points for the Aussies, who made all the big plays against a Croat team that won the 1992 silver medal and features NBA standouts Toni Kukoc and Dino Radja.\n\nLithuania, the 1992 bronze medalist, beat Greece 99-66 and Yugoslavia defeated China 128-61.\n\nBOXING\n\nAmericans Rhoshii Wells, Terrance Cauthen and Nate Jones won their matches, advancing to the semifinals. All three are assured of at least bronze medals.\n\nThe 19-year-old Wells, a 165-pounder, landed a right with seven seconds remaining in his match to tie Dilshood Yarbekov of Uzbekistan and was declared winner by tiebreaker.\n\nCauthen scored often with right hands in a tactical fight in beating Thailand's Veongviact Phongsit 14-10 in the lightweight division. Jones routed Tao Jiang of China 21-4 at 201 pounds.\n\nCANOE-KAYAK\n\nDefending champions Kay Bluhm and Torsten Gutsche of Germany overtook Americans Peter Newton and John Mooney and won the two-man kayak 1,000-meter event, qualifying for Thursday's semifinal. Newton and Mooney changed their strategy in the repechage, or second-chance race, coming from behind to win and qualify for the semifinal.\n\nMike Harbold also needed the repechage to qualify for the 1,000 canoe semifinal.\n\nDIVING\n\nAmericans Melisa Moses and Jenny Keim advanced to the springboard semifinal, while two near-bellyflops put world champion Tan Shuping of China out of the competition. The other Chinese swimmer, Fu Mingxia, kept alive her hopes of becoming the first woman to win both the springboard and platform events since 1960. Fu won the platform event Saturday.\n\nFIELD HOCKEY (WOMEN)\n\nThe U.S. women's field hockey team defeated Spain 2-0 for fifth place.\n\nSouth Korea moved into the gold medal game with a 1-0 victory over Germany. Britain warmed up for the bronze medal match with a 5-0 victory over Argentina.\n\nMODERN PENTATHLON\n\nAleksandr Parygin of Kazakstan won the gold medal with 5,551 points.\n\nAfter nearly 13 hours of competition in five sports, Parygin won the gold by catching Eduard Zenovka of Russia, the 1992 bronze medalist, just before the finish line in the 21/2-mile cross-country run.\n\nMOUNTAIN BIKES\n\nThe United States got an expected medal as mountain biking made its Olympic debut. Susan DeMattei won the bronze after her teammate and pre-race favorite, Juli Furtado, faded.\n\nThree-time world champion Paola Pezzo of Italy won the women's gold. World champion Bart Jan Brentjens of the Netherlands took the men's gold.\n\nSOCCER\n\nHernan Crespo's two second-half goals helped Argentina move into its first Olympic final since 1928 with a 2-0 victory over Portugal.\n\nSOFTBALL\n\nThe U.S. team won the gold medal, defeating China 3-1. Dot Richardson went 2-for-3 and hit a two-run homer, and Sheila Cornell drove in a run. The Americans finished the tournament 8-1.\n\nU.S. starter Michele Granger struck out eight and allowed three hits before giving up a double with two outs in the sixth, putting runners at second and third. Lisa Fernandez finished.\n\nSYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING\n\nThe U.S. team moved into the lead with an almost flawless routine during the technical round of competition. The Americans, using a medley centered around \"When The Saints Go Marching In,\" scored three perfect 10s, two for technical merit and one for artistic impression. Those were the only 10s awarded.\n\nThe technical round counts for 35 percent of the total score. The five-minute freestyle programs, which count for the rest of the scoring, will be held Friday.\n\nTABLE TENNIS\n\nKong Linghui and Liu Guoliang of China won the gold medal in men's doubles, defeating defending champions Lu Lin and Wang Tao of China 21-8, 18-21, 21-19, 21-17.\n\nTEAM HANDBALL\n\nThe U.S. women's team finished winless in its round-robin pool, losing 31-21 to China. Germany beat Angola 27-12, Denmark defeated Hungary 27-22 and Korea edged Norway 25-21.\n\nTENNIS\n\nAndre Agassi closed within one victory of a medal, rallying to beat Wayne Ferreira of South Africa 7-5, 4-6, 7-5 in the quarterfinals. Agassi was penalized a point in the third set for cursing, leaving him on the verge of ejection. But the top-seeded American rallied from a 5-3 deficit against the fifth-seeded Ferreira.\n\nMaliVai Washington was eliminated by unseeded Spaniard Sergi Bruguera 7-6 (10-8), 4-6, 7-5. Washington, seeded fourth, served for the match at 5-4 in the third set. But he double-faulted on break point, then lost the next seven points.\n\nTop-seeded Mary Joe and Gigi Fernandez, bidding to repeat their Barcelona gold-medal performance, advanced to the semifinals in doubles by eliminating Valda Lake and Clare Wood of England 6-2, 6-1.\n\nVOLLEYBALL (WOMEN)\n\nThe United States was beaten by Cuba 15-1, 15-10, 15-12 in the quarterfinals.\n\nIt's the first time in four Olympics the United States will go without a medal in volleyball.\n\nRussia and China won their quarterfinal matches and will meet in the semifinals Thursday.\n\nWEIGHTLIFTING\n\nAndrey Chemerkin earned the title of \"world's strongest man.\" Again.\n\nChemerkin, the gold medalist at the 1995 World Championships, broke the world record in the clean-and-jerk on his final lift to win the gold medal with a total of 1,0081/2 pounds. His clean-and-jerk effort of 573 pounds broke the record of 562 pounds set by silver medalist Ronny Weller of Germany a few minutes earlier.\n\nWRESTLING\n\nAmerican Kurt Angle, the 220-pound world champion, won three matches to reach the semifinals. Angle was joined in the semifinals by teammates and returning Olympians Kendall Cross at 1251/2 pounds and Townsend Saunders at 1491/2.\n\nOut of the gold-medal chase were Les Gutches at 1801/2 pounds and Rob Eiter at 1051/2. Both are alive for possible bronze medals.\n\nYACHTING\n\nAmerica's woes in yachting continued when the Tornado team blew a chance for a medal. Entering the final race with a one-point lead over fourth-place France, John Lovell and Charlie Ogletree finished 12th and dropped into eighth place overall in the final standings.\n\nAfter winning medals in nine of 10 classes at Barcelona four years ago, the American sailors have none so far on home waters.\n\nFernando Leon and Jose Luis Ballester of Spain had clinched the gold Monday and decided to sit out the final races."
