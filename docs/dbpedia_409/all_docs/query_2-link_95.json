        "text": "Archery - Quick Guide\n\nArchery - Overview\n\nArchery is termed as a practice-sport, which means that it is more of a practice-oriented skill of using bow and arrow. Propelling an arrow with force through the air has only recently been considered a sport but it was always a very important hunting practise in olden days.\n\nHistorically, archery has been used for hunting and combat purposes. But in modern times, archery had become a recreational and competitive sport. A person who indulges in archery is known as an archer or a bowman. An expert in archery is known as toxophilite.\n\nArchery involves using a bow to shoot arrows at a stationary target. There are ten concentric circles that represent different tracts on the circular disk used as the target. The scores are dependent on the area of the circle where the arrow hits. The objective is to shoot the target with an arrow. The bow string will be stretched after placing the back-end of the arrow for initialising an input force which throws it towards the target.\n\nTeam Size\n\nGenerally, the game is played alone where individuals practice shooting the target or the concentric circles. However, as per the interest of the event-conducting company, the levels and types are decided and finalized. A team of 5-10 members can be formed, where they will together try to out-score the other teams by making points. The arrows contain a soft material at its tip to avoid causing any injuries to the players.\n\nParticipating Countries\n\nWhen the Olympics started, archery found its position high in the list of sports. Since then, many countries have fought for the world championship, however when it comes to serious contendership, only a few countries fight for the top position. Among all the competing nations, South Korea stands top in the list with 19 gold medals, 9 silver medals, 6 bronze medals and a total of 34 which was the highest of all.\n\nThe list of other countries participating in Olympics archery is long and the number includes nearly all the countries in the world-map. The countries having at least one Olympics medal in Archery are: South Korea, United States, Belgium, France, Great Britain, Italy, China, Soviet Union, Finland, Ukraine, Australia, Netherlands, Spain, Japan, Sweden, Chinese Taipei, Germany, Mexico, Poland, Indonesia, Unified Team and Russia.\n\nClick the link below to know more about Participating countries\n\nArchery - Participating Countries\n\nArchery - History\n\nThe history of archery goes back to 72,000 BC when bows and arrows were made in Africa. The oldest bows do not exist but it is estimated that they were invented in the period of late Paleolithic or early Mesolithic which is about 10,000 years ago.\n\nThe bows and arrows were later developed in different parts of the world. If we talk about Asia, warriors used short bows while riding a horse. Yew was used to make long bows in England which helped in improving the military power.\n\nHistory in different periods\n\nNow we will discuss history of archery in different periods\n\nPrehistoric Times\n\nBows were the main weapon of war in pre-historic times. Some of them were poisonous. The history goes long back to 72,000 BC to 60,000 BC in South Africa where arrowheads were found. Small stone points were also found in France which dates back to 54,000 years ago.\n\nThese points show the evidence of a projectile weapon whose size was less than 10mm. Arrowheads were also found in the Fa Hien caves in Sri Lanka which date back to 48,000 years ago. The pieces of evidence show that in Sri Lanka, bows and arrows were used to shoot small animals like monkeys, squirrels, etc.\n\nBladelets were found in Kenya which were pierced into the human skull which shows that bows and arrows were used as weapons 10,000 years ago. All these evidences show that the bow was introduced in Eurasia in the upper Paleolithic period.\n\nArchery came from Stellmoor to Europe 11,000 years ago. Pine was used for making arrows whose length was 6 to 8 inches and had a flint point.\n\nNeolithic Period\n\nThe oldest bow in this period is 7,400 years old and belongs to Spain. It was made up of Yew wood and was in the shape of a D letter. The forts of the European Neolithic show that archery was the major weapon of fighting.\n\nBronze Age\n\nIn Europe, India, and Eastern Asia, archery became a great weapon for warfare. The popularity of archery in warfare started declining after the invention of gunpowder. In this period, mounted archery became a feature of Eurasian nomad culture which helped in military success. Later mass usage of guns declined the usage of archery in warfare. This led archery to be developed as a sport. The first competition of archery was organized in 1583 in England. The number of participants was 3,000.\n\nHistory of Archery in different countries\n\nNow we will discuss the development of archery in different countries. A large number of archers were available in India, Persia, Japan, Egypt, etc. Archers were the main group in a war and their attack was decisive. The term that was used for archery in Sanskrit is dhanurveda. Now we will see the history of archery in different countries.\n\nNorth Africa\n\nThe archery was popular in ancient Egypt during the time of Pharaohs. At that time the technique was used in warfare and also for hunting purposes. Tomb of Thebes has different figures which shows that lessons in archery are being given to the trainees. Besides this, there are many deities of Egypt that were related to archery. The external enemies of Egypt were depicted by nine bows and one such example is the seated statue of Pharaoh Djoser\n\nMost archers belonged to Nubian extraction which provided their service to Egypt. They were so expert in the art of archery that Ancient Egyptians called Nubia as the land of bow.\n\nMesopotamia\n\nBow and arrow were used by the Assyrians and Babylonians for hunting purposes. The ancient empires of Mesopotamia also used archery in warfare. Training was given to the archers and then they were employed to show their talent in wars. Archers used to fight either on foot or on chariots. Kassites had chariot warriors that were dependent on archery as a major weapon for warfare.\n\nEurasian Steppes\n\nDuring the bronze age, European Steppes introduced a composite bow which became popular in the old world. These composite bows were introduced by the nomads from Eurasia to different civilizations like Mesopotamia, East Asia, India, Iran, and Europe. It is also believed that they introduced chariots with spoked wheels which were used in the Indo-European militaries. It is also believed that Eurasian Steppes introduced the domestication of horses and used bow and arrow while riding them.\n\nIndia\n\nIn the Indian subcontinent, archery was extensively used in warfare. The paintings of Bhimbetka rock shelters give a picture of archery. The archery is also mentioned in Rigveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda. Dhanurveda can be found in Yajurveda which includes the knowledge of using bow and arrow and its usage in warfare.\n\nDhanurveda or the science of archery can also be found in the Visnu Purana and Mahabharata. The rules of archery are available in the Dhanurveda and it also includes the ways to train the people to become perfect archers. Different types of bows and arrows were also mentioned in this book along with the process of making them.\n\nIndians also started using the composite bow on foot and chariots in the 2nd millennium BCE. The usage of archery continued in the Maurya empire. In the same period, Chanakya wrote Arthshastra which included economic and military strategies. A mention of an archery school in Taxila can also be found where training was given to 103 prices. Foot archers were a part of the army in the Gupta empire. The archery was used in India until the introduction of firearms by Mongols.\n\nGreco Roman Antiquity\n\nArchery was practiced by the people of Crete and this led to a high demand for Cretan archers. Alexander the Great included a larger number of archers in his army. The army of Romans included very few archers and later they had to employ archers trained in other countries.\n\nThe armies of Julius Caesar included Cretan archers. Archers with composite bows became a part of the Roman army in the whole empire. The Romans were pressurized when the Hun invaders used mounted archers in their army.\n\nEast Asia\n\nAncient Chinese culture also included archery. Confucius also taught archery to his students. One of the famous Chinese archers was Lie Zi who was also a Daoist philosopher. Crossbows were developed in China which helped the Han invaders to win the battles against the nomad invaders. With the expansion of Chinese culture, the techniques of archery were also diversified.\n\nEurope\n\nShort bows were used in Europe for warfare and hunting. The design of the arrows was the same as ancient period but the material used to make them was different as it was able to kill or injure an unarmored man if the range was close. In the early medieval period, usage of short bows was extensive and was used by unarmored archers.\n\nThe crossbow came to Europe in the 10thcentury. The range of these arrows was very high and accurate. These arrows also had great penetration power. Crusades used these crossbows as they could pierce into the armor and also kill a horse. French armies also used crossbows.\n\nLongbow was introduced in Europe in the 13th century and archers who used them were mostly peasants and yeomen. The rate of firing of a long bow is much higher than a short bow. Skill, training, and strength were needed to use a long bow. The long bow lacked accuracy so mass archers were used to attack the enemy. The last usage of the longbow was done in the final clan battle between the MacDonalds and the Mackintoshes. After the long bow, the McNaughton bow was introduced which was used by Highlanders.\n\nMiddle East\n\nThe composite bow was preferred in the Middle East as its power was more than that of the short bow. These composite bows could be easily shot from the horse back. Skilled craftsmen were able to make these bows. Mounted archers were included in the army of the Byzantine Empire and the ways of its usage were imposed by Emperor Mavrikios.\n\nMounted archers were also used by the tribes in Turkey against the first European Crusade. The aim of the archers was to damage the infantry of the European army to prevent their march\n\nAsia\n\nGenghis Khan and his successors had a Mongol army that consisted of mounted warriors. These warriors had Mongol bows which were similar to the recurve composite bow and were made by using leather, horn, and wood. Animal sinew was also a part of making the bow. All these items were held together with the help of fish glue. In order to make the bow waterproof, tree bark was used. Archers can shoot the arrows accurately in the range of 700 to 800 meters.\n\nTwo types of bows were used by the warriors. The short bow was used for short range and the long bow for long range. Some of the arrows also have the feature of piercing into the armor. The military of Korea was adopted from China in which archery skills were included. Later Korean archery became a practical martial art.\n\nDeclination of Archery\n\nThe usage of archery in warfare started declining after the introduction of gunpowder. Though archery was famous but gradually the usage of firearms was adopted by all the cultures. Early firearms were not very useful and they were very sensitive to the wet weather.\n\nArmies were loaded with guns which increased their firepower and this made the highly trained archers obsolete. In a few countries like Korea and China, the usage of archery continued.\n\nArchery usage for recreation\n\nEngland started using archery as a game and one of the early societies for archery was Finsbury Archers while another one was Kilwinning Papingo. Kilwinning Papingo used to arrange competitions in which a wooden parrot had to be shot which was located at the top of the abbey tower.\n\nOne of the oldest archery sporting bodies was the Company of Scottish Archers which was formed in 1676. Toxophilite Society was formed in 1781 in London by Sir Ashton Lever. Many archery societies were formed later and had their own rules for entry.\n\nModern Archery Sport\n\nThe recreation of archery was turned into a sport in the 1840s when a Grand National Archery Society meeting was held in New York. Many rules were made which included shooting of arrows at 60, 80, and 100 yards. New archery techniques were suggested and developed by Horace A Ford. He was the winner of the Grand International tournament 11 times. By the end of the 19th century, other games like croquet and tennis developed which led to the decline of the archery sport. Only 50 archery clubs remained in Britain by the end of 1889.\n\nArchery was a part of the 1900 Olympics held in Paris. The game also developed in Korea and China and craftsmen were asked to develop bows and arrows in China. In modern times, mounted archery has also become a famous sport. Archery has become the national sport of the Kingdom of Bhutan.\n\nProfessional archery was developed in the 1920s in which recurve and compound bows were used. American enthusiasts gave priority to the traditional bows. Fred Bear is considered as a developer of modern archery game. He was a bow manufacturer and bow hunter.\n\nArchery in the Olympics, Paralympics, and World Games\n\nThe sport was included in the Olympics in 1900, 1908, and 1920. In order to provide a permanent place for archery in the Olympics, World Archery was founded in 1931. After 1920, the game disappeared and returned back in 1972.\n\nAfter 1972, the game was permanently included in the Olympics. Recurve bows were used to take part in the target archery events. Archery also became a part of the Paralympic Games in the 1960s. Para archery events were held in which impaired athletes took part to show their talents by using recurve and compound bow.\n\nArchery also became a part of the World Games in 1985 and recurve and barebow were used to take part in the event. A compound bow was added to the World Game in 2013.\n\nArchery - Playing Environment\n\nGround Design\n\nArchery is played on various types of fields according to the type of game. Ground archery requires a ground and a target. Well, other types of archery include Bow Hunting, Traditional Archery, 3D Archery, Field Archery, and Target Archery.\n\nBow archery involves hunting animals using bow and arrow. It is the oldest-known form of archery and one of the most ancient hunting techniques. Long-range grounds are used for this of game play.\n\nTraditional Archery varies from country to country. The type of bow used in traditional archery varies according to the nation, following some ancient techniques. This is the reason this form of archery is called traditional archery.\n\n3D archery tournaments provide for a non-violent version of bow archery with the use of modern technology, where the archers are instructed to train their arrows on 3D form of animals for shooting. The game provides a wooden walk or open course. This ground design is recommended by International Bow-hunting Organization.\n\nField archery is played on a roving course which was set through the woods. There are paper targets ranging from 20 to 80 yards. It is one of the most exciting forms of archery and gives a feel of the old days of hunting.\n\nTarget archery was featured in the Olympics Games. It consists of shooting bull’s-eye-style, multi-coloured target at certain distances. Different disciplines of the game has different grounds of play.\n\nDimensions\n\nThe most frequently-specified distance for shooting a target is between 20 to 80 yards. In Olympics, target archery has a length of 18 meters, i.e., about 20 yards indoor and between 30 to 90 meters outdoors. It depends on age of the archer and the style of equipment.\n\nArchery - Equipment\n\nArchery is the oldest sport and was one of the games in the Olympics held in 1900. The game can be played by both males and females. Archery is considered as one of the safest games in the world. Many strict rules and regulations are followed to make the game safe. There are many pieces of equipment used in this game and we will discuss them in detail.\n\nArm Guards\n\nArm guards are worn on the shooting hand in the forearm below the elbow. This is safety equipment as the hands of the archers are saved from bruises and other injuries. These injuries can occur when stretching the bowstring with the arrow for a shot.\n\nArrows\n\nArrows are long rods that have to be shot by stretching them on a bowstring and leaving them. Many materials are used to make these arrows but the most common is the specialized carbon fiber as they do not bend and also cannot be broken easily. Other materials used to make these arrows are wood, aluminum, and fiberglass.\n\nArrows are used with bows and are shot at the target to earn more and more points to win the game. Special arrows are used for hunting animals. Arrows are available in the games stores in a set of 6 or 12.\n\nArrow Rest\n\nArrow rest is a device that is used to attach it to the bow when a shot has to be made. Arrow rest helps archers to position the arrow correctly. Arrow rests are of different types and they include −\n\nPlunger rest\n\nDrop-away rest\n\nWhisker biscuit rest\n\nProng rest\n\nV-bar rest\n\nArchers should choose arrow rests that are comfortable to use and are compatible with their shooting style.\n\nArrow Tip\n\nThe arrow tip is also known as point and it is the pointed tip of the arrow which has to be pierced into the target after the shot. The arrow tip is made up of metal and is available in different designs and shapes. These designs include field points, broad heads, and target points.\n\nField points consist of bullet-shaped tips and are included in the arrows for target practice. Broadheads consist of sharp cutting edges and are used for hunting. Arrows having target points are used in competitions.\n\nArrow Fletches\n\nFletches are attached to the arrows and they are available in the form of vanes or feathers. The fletching is very important as it is responsible for stabilizing the arrows which are on their way to the target. Natural feathers or plastic are used to make these fletches. Different types of fletching include helical, straight, and parabolic. Archers need to choose proper fletching as it can affect the flight of arrows.\n\nBags\n\nBags are available for the archers to carry all their pieces of equipment which they will use in the game. Bags are available in different shapes and sizes and archers can choose the one suitable for their requirements. Bags can have a lot of compartments, straps, and pockets to store different pieces of equipment. Some bags also have a separate compartment for the bow. Durable materials are used to make these bags to protect the equipment from wear and tear.\n\nBows\n\nAnother essential piece of equipment used in archery is the bow. Bows consist of a string which is stretched by keeping an arrow which is shot at the target to get points. Archery bows are of two types which include compound bow and recurve bow. Recurve bows consist of an arch while compound bows consist of rigid shafts.\n\nBow Sights\n\nThe bow sight is a tool which is used by archers to focus on the target. Bow sight consists of pins which help the archers to shoot the target easily. Bow sights are of two types which include fixed pin bow sight and single pin bow sight. The fixed pin bow sight cannot be adjusted as the pin is fixed at a specific point. Single pin can be easily adjusted by archers as per their requirements. Fixed pin bow sights are better for beginners while experienced archers are able to use the single pin bow sights.\n\nBow Stand\n\nA bow stand is used to keep the bow when it is not in use.\n\nChest Guards\n\nChest guards are worn over the shirt or the uniform to protect the chest from missed shots or string contraction. An adjustable strap is also available which can be used to fasten the guard. Chest guards are light in weight and do not cause a problem while shooting.\n\nCrossbows\n\nA crossbow is a bow which is used to shoot the arrows at short distances. There is a long frame in the bow and it looks similar to the capital T when kept horizontally. The speed of the arrows shot from this bow is faster than other bows. The bow also consists of a trigger so chances of human error is low.\n\nFinger Tabs\n\nA finger tab is needed to protect the fingers from the string of the bow. Finger tabs are available in the form of small devices which are worn on the fingers to protect them from injury while making a shot. Leather or synthetic materials are used for making these finger tabs. These finger tabs are easily adjustable so they can fit in any finger easily. Archers need to choose comfortable finger tabs which are easy to wear and are compatible with the bow.\n\nGloves\n\nGloves are pieces of equipment that are worn on the palms and help the archers to make a grip on the bow and arrow. Gloves are also worn for the protection of fingers from injuries. Gloves made up of leather are durable.\n\nQuivers\n\nQuivers are the cases in which the arrows are kept. Archers can store any kind of arrows in their quiver. A quiver consists of a strap and the case is located in such a way that archers can access the arrows easily. Quivers help the archers to keep both their hands free as arrows are kept in them.\n\nRangefinders\n\nRangefinders are used to find the accurate range of the target from a distance. It can also be used to view long distances of the target.\n\nRisers\n\nThe central part of the bow is called the bow riser. Grip along with other attachments are located here. This part of the bow is made up of wood, aluminum, and other materials. It is the part which archers use to hold the bow. The risers are used for making a connection between the upper and lower limbs. Bow risers are available in different designs, sizes, and shapes.\n\nSilencers\n\nSilencers are used to reduce noise and friction.\n\nSpotting Scopes\n\nSpotting scopes work in the same way as a camera. It is not attached directly to the bow. The equipment consists of a lens which archers can use for zooming the target.\n\nStabilizers\n\nStabilizers can be attached to bows for stability and balance. Stabilizers have to be chosen on the basis of the ways archers want to shoot.\n\nTargets\n\nTargets are the important pieces of equipment which are used in the archery sport to earn points. Targets are available in round shapes and have rings with different colors. The points are given on the basis of where an arrow lands. If the arrow lands on the outermost ring, one point is awarded. If the arrow hits the center, ten points are awarded.\n\nTarget Stand\n\nA target stand is a stand on which the target is fixed. The target stand is located at a particular distance and archers have to shoot the arrows on the target.\n\nArchery - Terminology\n\nBefore taking a bow into the hand and throwing an arrow towards the target, it’s mandatory to learn a few terms in the field of archery for grasping little knowledge about the game and its features.\n\nAnchor Point − The point to be touched by the string before releasing the arrow.\n\nArcher’s Paradox − The effect generated by flexing of an arrow when it leaves the bow.\n\nBow fishing − Using archery to catch fish.\n\nBow hunting − Implementing archery in hunting and the practising of hunting.\n\nBroadhead − A sharp-bladed hunting head attached to an arrow.\n\nBullseye − The centre of a target, for which hitting scores maximum points.\n\nClout Archery − A discipline in archery to shoot at a flag.

Three athletes in each team have to shoot one arrow at a time and six in total.\n\nPositions\n\nThere are three positions and three athletes have to take these positions at a time. We will discuss these positions here.\n\nPosition 1\n\nThe first position is known as Opener and this athlete has the responsibility to shoot the first arrow and help the rest of the team to set a great momentum for the team. If the shot is not good, it can create a problem for the rest of the team.\n\nPosition 2\n\nThe athlete in this position is called Middle. This position is called the heart of the team and is considered as weakest and consistent. If the middle archer is good, he may lead his team to win the match.\n\nPosition 3\n\nThe athlete in this position is called Anchor and has the option of shooting the sixth or the last arrow. The anchor has to shoot the arrow whether he can reach the target score or not. Archers at this position have the best records for shooting arrows.\n\nArchery Stances\n\nArchers have to set their stances properly so that they can shoot the arrows and earn more and more points. The stance refers to the position of the body which helps in shooting the arrow accurately. If the stance is not correct, it can be difficult to shoot the arrow at the target. Many things have to be considered to make an ideal stance placement. Some of these things are as follows −\n\nPlayers have to stand straight and upright so that every part of the body can be easily controlled.\n\nThe foot should be placed in an ideal position to maintain the balance.\n\nKnees should be kept straight and relaxed.\n\nThere are many stance options and players can adopt the one which is suitable for them to shoot the arrow. We will discuss different stance positions here.\n\nThe Square Stance\n\nThe square stance is considered as one of the most popular stances as it is very simple and can be used by beginners as well as expert archers. A square stance helps the players to create a solid base so that the target can be aimed accurately.\n\nFor this stance, an archer has to keep his feet parallel to each other and they should be on either side of the shooting line. If a player is a right-hander, his left foot will be in front and his right foot will be at the back. The opposite has to be done by the left-hander.\n\nThe Open Stance\n\nThis is a type of stance in which the archer has to keep his legs on the opposite sides of the shooting line. The difference between the open stance and the square stance is that the front leg has to be kept slightly back in the open stance. In order to use this stance, the angle of the feet has to be set to a 45 degree so that the face of the feet is towards the target along with the hips.\n\nThe Closed Stance\n\nThe Closed Stance is the opposite of the open stance. This is a stance in which the front foot is kept at front. Archers have the option of putting their front feet away from the target but the angle should be less than the angle of the front foot in the open stance.\n\nHow to Practice Archery Stance?\n\nThere are different ways which you can use to practice your stance. Some of them are discussed below −\n\nStraddling the Line\n\nThis is a way which depends on whether you are a right-handed or left-handed archer. If you are right-handed, your left foot should be kept forward and the opposite should be followed if you are left-handed.\n\nWidth of feet and shoulder\n\nThe width of the feet and shoulder should be kept apart when you are standing on the shooting line. If you feel problems while targeting the target and shooting the arrow, it is because your feet may be too close or too far apart.\n\nConsistency should be maintained\n\nChoose the stance and be consistent on it. Practice it as much as possible so that muscle strength can be developed. This will also improve your shooting experience.\n\nPosture maintenance\n\nYou always need to stand straight and tall. If you always maintain such a posture, you will be able to improve your shooting accuracy. The back should be kept straight while the knees can be bent a little.\n\nRelaxation\n\nThe chest, hips, and torso should be relaxed which will help in the reduction of the muscle strain. Shoulders should be relaxed at regular intervals because if this will not be done, you may not be able to shoot accurately.\n\nThe head should be kept straight\n\nThe head should be kept straight for accurate shooting.\n\nArchery - How to Practice?\n\nThere are steps to learn archery. Any amateur can easily be proficient in this game but to learn it, play it, and be a better sportsman, archery needs to be practiced regularly and under supervision.\n\nLet us go through the basics of how to play and grasp the joy of archery.\n\nRequirements\n\nEvery player who is willing to take part in archery should make sure their vision is sharp and that they can see the target. This has to be the first step to consider for any archer. As the targets are far away and very small, it takes keen observation power to hit the target.\n\nThe other things needed are a bow, arrows, and guards for protecting various body parts from hurts and injuries during the game.\n\nCostumes and Equipment\n\nMostly, the players suffer minor injuries on their wrist areas and fingers when they release the arrow. Hence, protection for arm, fingers and chest must be put on before entering into the game.\n\nChoose a bow that is suitable for you, and is comfortable in your grip. Arrows are prefixed with some length and sizes. Once you select one, get ready to launch the first arrow.\n\nClick the link below to know more about equipment − Archery - Equipment\n\nBefore You Start\n\nThe first step to do before you get started is to stretch the body. Stretching is compulsory to avoid a pull of the muscle. To avoid any injuries that might hurt the arms, elbows, and shoulder muscles and result in severe pain, the players are advised to do some basic stretching before the game.\n\nAll dangling objects including earrings, loose clothing should be removed. If the player possesses long hair, it should be tied back for precautions.\n\nThe next step is placing the arrow in the dent attached to the string. The string is generally made of synthetic material, so fingers need a tab for protection from minor cuts. The rubber-rest holds the arrow over the bow and it’s the responsibility of the player to make sure that it clicks the rest. The arrow must not come loose.\n\nHow to Hold the Arrow?\n\nWhile the arrow is on the dent and the string is stretched, make sure that index finger is placed above the arrow, with the middle and ring fingers below the arrow. The little finger and thumb should be placed away. Make sure they never touch the string. This enables the free movement of the arrow without putting any pressure on it.\n\nNow it’s time to release the arrow. Gently, the string should be pulled back such that it touches the tip of your nose and your hand is below your jaw. If you feel your muscle tensed, then ease it back and make sure to warm up the muscle and your arm.\n\nAiming\n\nThere is a sight located on the bow for aiming the target. Learn to use the red dot that is in the middle, and the picture which is at the centre of the target. Never hold the stretched string for more than 4 seconds.\n\nThis may end up in losing the target and stretching a muscle, causing severe pain and shivering in the hand. Try using the back muscle instead of the arm, for holding the bow. Try to close the left eye to avoid any distraction in locking a view on the target.\n\nNow, slowly ease your fingers away from the stretched string, and maintain a stance while the arrow whistles through the air. To loosen the muscle, try to breathe three times after releasing the firm grip.\n\nMake sure that during the first few attempts, your instructor stays beside you to teach you the basic necessary steps. However, some basic steps can be achieved only through practise and personal advice. The best archers were once beginners and would happily tell you that this sport works on the principle of striving for perfection. The attitude must be to learn, rather than compete.\n\nOnly after a great deal of practise, the art of archery can mastered. After going through the basic level training, make sure these skills are practised well, acquainted and applied with every arrow that is shot from the bow.\n\nScoring and Winning\n\nThere are two types of scoring in archery that depend on the level of game conducted. They are 5-zone and 10-zone scoring −\n\n5-zone Scoring − In the former one, the target is divided into 5 different coloured zones and points are awarded according to the level the arrow hits. This method is followed in GNAS rounds and the distances are measured in yards.\n\n10-zone Scoring − The 10 zone is divided into 10 scoring zones, where each colour is spilt into two parts the inner ring and the outer ring. For world archery,10-zone scoring method is used. This is used in most indoor archery and the length is measured in meters.\n\nHow to Aim the Traditional Bow?\n\nThe modern bows have sights and other equipment that help the archer to locate the target with ease and deliver the shot better, which results in a better performance. While using a traditional bow, archers find it difficult to target a point as it doesn’t allow any of these extra features on the bow.\n\nThe instinctive shooter’s focus should be especially fixed on the target. We know that peripheral vision can pick up cues that are away from the target, but an intent and focused mind doesn’t take a note of them. A reference shooter may explain the aiming reference, but that cannot be expected from an instinctive shooter.\n\nReference Methods\n\nAll reference methods are based on determining the point where the bow setup is placed while shooting. The point on distance is where the trajectory of arrow and the shooters’ line of sight shall meet. This point on distance varies from shooter to shooter.\n\nThe point on distance has an impact by the following features like arrow length, arrow speed, hold on the string, anchor point, etc. Shooters who love targeting long distances develop longer point of distance to lower the hold on far targets.\n\nSplit Vision\n\nThe split vision is the awareness of arrow shaft and adjusting to the wind-flow. Referring to many shooters, this split-vision is merely based upon the sight picture. Under a keen observation, the arrow and the riser are aligned in such a way that they line up to the target.\n\nVarious Gaps Method\n\nThe visual gap actually can be the distance between the shooter and the target itself. This depends on the shooter’s knowledge on the arrow’s trajectory at various timeframes till the point on distance is reached. Most archers pick up a point either above or below the target to coincide with the amount of trajectory that the arrow needs to compensate for gravity, while taking the arrow to the specific spot.\n\nPick up a Point\n\nIn this system of shooting, the archers select a point on the target and also calculate the trajectory of arrow, how high or low the arrow makes an impact along the path. This is same as gapping the target. The major difference is only the focus which remains constant. In a whole, the shooter tries to hit a certain spot using the point, but the trajectory takes it to a location slightly above or below the point.\n\nShort Gap\n\nIn this method, the archer visualizes the target as a spot slightly above, or directly in front of the arrow. It seems like painting while the arrow is actually the brush. This is a bit harder to few people as the brain visualizes in 3D and the target needs to be seen as a picture.\n\nShaft Gapping\n\nIn this method, the archer needs to know how to use the diameter of arrow shaft. The shooter utilizes the arrow shaft to measure the gap towards the target. This is mastered through vigorous practise that includes observation and concentration.\n\nArchery - Precautions\n\nMost people have a misconception that because they aren’t firearms, bows can be carelessly handled. But like guns, arrows can also be misused and can cause serious damage to the archer himself or people around him. Odds are that most people who are regular users of the bow have been slapped by their bowstring at least a few times, but there are much worse things that have happened.\n\nSafety\n\nSome of the potentially lethal mistakes and do-not are listed below −\n\nThe torque in the bow tends to break the string. The string should be in alignment with cams and any twist in the positions can break the string, causing a slap over the wrist and arm. Be careful while stretching the bowstring.\n\nBe sure the arrows are flexed before they are used. The carbon arrows, especially the new ones should be flexed because the damaged arrows have a greater chance of breaking when they are shot. This may send splinters into the shooters face causing injuries. Some broken arrows may get into the hands and pierce through the skin.\n\nImproper hold over the release may result in some bruises, so the archers need to make sure that they hold the bow correctly. Also, the draw-length should be maintained with proper calculations, depending upon the string material, the material used for the arrows, etc. and torque on the bow and string.\n\nNever shoot straight up. It is an obvious observation that should never be ignored. Remember, everything that goes up should come down. And if an arrow is launched straight upward, it may result in hitting you before you run away from the initial position.\n\nNever dry-fire a bow. Stretching and releasing a bow string without an arrow is one of the worst kinds of act to be performed while holding a string. Not only it damages the string, but also, it may hurt you at places where the bowstring generally doesn’t hurt. So be careful and try not to be foolish.\n\nKnowing the target and the environment around it helps you to prevent hurting others. Check the surroundings; especially, what is present behind the target. Safeguarding helps not only yourself, but also people around you.\n\nArchery - Rules\n\nArchery is a popular sport and participants have to follow many rules. Some of these rules are listed below −\n\nArchers have to follow all the rules related to the equipment they are going to use in the game. The equipment should not consist of any accessories which may help them against their opponents.\n\nArchers have to shoot three arrows in two minutes and six arrows in four minutes.\n\nThe participants can raise their bow only after receiving the signal.\n\nParticipants cannot reshoot the arrows in any circumstances.

The distance of the target in the indoor archery competitions is 16 meters while for outdoor, it is 70 meters.\n\nOlympic Archery\n\nOlympic archery is a type of target archery but has different rules. Only recurve bows are used in the Olympic Archery The first competition of archery was held in the 1900 Olympics.

Archers can shoot from front, back, overhead, and behind himself but it depends on the type of track. The results depend on the accuracy of the archers and the time taken to complete the course.\n\nKyudo\n\nKyudo is a martial art from Japan in which bows and arrows are used. The technique of playing this game is taught in Japan only. Another thing is that this game is different from archery. The bow used in this game is termed as yumi and is of asymmetrical shape.

It was also included in the Olympics in 1904, 1908, and 1920 in which many archers participated.\n\nThe rules for archery were set by the country where the Olympic Games were held. Later on, the World Archery Federation made rules to be followed in each Olympic Game. These rules were difficult to follow so archery was removed from the Olympics after 1920.\n\nReturn of Archery to Olympics\n\nThe demand to include archery in the Olympics arose in the 1930s but a fixed set of rules was needed. Seven founding member states created the World Archery Federation and these members include the following −\n\nItaly\n\nFrance\n\nHungary\n\nCzechoslovakia\n\nPoland\n\nSweden\n\nThe United States\n\nWorld Archery Federation has the responsibility of making rules and also promoting the game all over the world. The sport was regulated and many archery championships were arranged by the organization. Because of the fixed rules made by the federation, archery was again included in the 1972 Olympics held in Munich.\n\nRules of Archery in Olympics\n\nMany rules have been made which helped in returning of the archery game to the Olympics. Head-to-head competition and single elimination brackets are included. The only discipline included in the Olympic archery is recurve.

This process repeats for 6 arrows and each archer has to shoot one arrow at a time in one round and one arrow in another to complete a set of shooting 6 arrows.\n\nThe team who scores the highest gets 2 points for a set. In the case of a tie, each team wins one point. A team is declared a winner if it wins five set points. If a tie occurs after four sets, each archer from each team is invited alternatively to shoot at the target.
