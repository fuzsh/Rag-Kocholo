        "text": "PARIS (AP) — Paris: the Olympic gold medalist of naughtiness.\n\nRevolution ran like a high-voltage wire through the wacky, wonderful and rule-breaking Olympic opening ceremony that the French capital used to astound, bemuse and, at times, poke a finger in the eye of global audiences on Friday night.\n\nThat Paris put on the most flamboyant, diversity-celebrating, LGBTQ+-visible of opening ceremonies wasn't a surprise. Anything less would have seemed a betrayal of the pride the French capital takes in being a home to humanity in all its richness.\n\nBut still. Wow. Paris didn't just push the envelope. It did away with it entirely as it hammered home a message that freedom must know no bounds.\n\nA practically naked singer painted blue made thinly veiled references to his body parts. Blonde-bearded drag queen Piche crawled on all fours to the thumping beat of “Freed From Desire” by singer-songwriter Gala, who has long been a potent voice against homophobia. There were the beginnings of a menage à trois — the door was slammed on the camera before things got really steamy — and the tail end of an intimate embrace between two men who danced away, hugging and holding hands.\n\n“In France, we have the right to love each other, as we want and with who we want. In France, we have the right to believe or to not believe. In France, we have a lot of rights. Voila,” said the audacious show's artistic director, Thomas Jolly.\n\nJolly, who is gay, says being bullied as a child for supposedly being effeminate drove home early on how unjust discrimination is.\n\nThe amorous vibe and impudence were too much for some.\n\n“Know that it is not France that is speaking but a left-wing minority ready for any provocation,” posted far-right French politician Marion Maréchal, adding a hashtagged “notinmyname.”\n\nHere's a closer look at how Paris both awed and shocked.\n\nA 21st-century update of Leonardo da Vinci’s ‘Last Supper’\n\nDJ and producer Barbara Butch, an LGBTQ+ icon who calls herself a “love activist,” wore a silver headdress that looked like a halo as she got a party going on a footbridge across the Seine, above parading athletes — including those from countries that criminalize LGBTQ+ people. Drag artists, dancers and others flanked Butch on both sides.\n\nThe tableau brought to mind Leonardo da Vinci's “Last Supper,” which depicts the moment when Jesus Christ declared that an apostle would betray him.\n\nJolly says that wasn't his intention. He saw the moment as a celebration of diversity, and the table on which Butch spun her tunes as a tribute to feasting and French gastronomy.\n\n“My wish isn't to be subversive, nor to mock or to shock,” Jolly said. “Most of all, I wanted to send a message of love, a message of inclusion and not at all to divide.”\n\nStill, critics couldn't unsee what they saw.\n\n“One of the main performances of the Olympics was an LGBT mockery of a sacred Christian story - the Last Supper - the last supper of Christ. The apostles were portrayed by transvestites,” the spokesperson for Russia's Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, posted on Telegram.\n\n“Apparently, in Paris they decided that since the Olympic rings are multi-colored, they can turn everything into one big gay parade,” she added.\n\nThe French Catholic Church's conference of bishops deplored what it described as “scenes of derision and mockery of Christianity” and said “our thoughts are with all the Christians from all continents who were hurt by the outrage and provocation of certain scenes.”\n\nLGBTQ+ athletes, though, seemed to have a whale of a time. British diver Tom Daley posted a photo of himself recreating the standout Kate Winslet-Leonardo DiCaprio scene from “Titanic,” only with the roles reversed: He was at the boat's prow with arms outstretched, as rower Helen Glover held him from behind.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIs that a revolver in your pocket?\n\nWhen a giant silver dome lifted to reveal singer Philippe Katerine reclining on a crown of fruit and flowers, practically naked and painted blue, audiences who didn't think he was Papa Smurf may have guessed that he represented Dionysus, the Greek god of wine and ecstasy.\n\nBut unless they speak French, they may not have caught the cheekiness of his lyrics.\n\n“Where to hide a revolver when you’re completely naked?” he sang, pointing down to his groin. “I know where you’re thinking. But that’s not a good idea.”\n\n“No more rich and poor when you go back to being naked. Yes,” Katerine continued.\n\nDecades after Brigitte Bardot sang “Naked in the Sun,” this was Paris' reminder that everyone starts life in their birthday suit, so where's the shame?\n\nParis museums are full of paintings that celebrate the human form. Gustave Courbet's “Origin of the World” hangs in the Musée d'Orsay. The 16th-century “Gabrielle d’Estrées and one of her sisters,” showing one bare-breasted woman pinching the nipple of another, hangs in the Louvre.\n\nFrance sends a message\n\nClad in a golden costume, French-Malian pop star Aya Nakamura strode confidently out of the hallowed doors of the Institut de France, a prestigious stronghold of French language, culture and commitment to freedom of thought. Even without a note being sung, the message of diversity, inclusion and Black pride was loud.\n\nThe most listened-to French-speaking artist in the world was a target of fierce attacks from extreme-right activists when her name emerged earlier this year as a possible performer at the show. Paris prosecutors opened an investigation of alleged racism targeting the singer.\n\nNakamura performed with musicians of the French military's Republican Guard, who danced around her.\n\nAu revoir, closed minds and stuffy traditions.\n\nOff with their head!\n\nWhen London hosted the Summer Games in 2012, it paid homage to the British monarchy by giving Queen Elizabeth II a starring role in the opening ceremony. Actor Daniel Craig, in character as James Bond, was shown visiting the head of state at Buckingham Palace before the pair appeared to parachute out of a helicopter over the stadium.\n\nThe French love to joyfully tease their neighbors across the English Channel and, perhaps not incidentally, took a totally different, utterly irreverent tack.\n\nA freshly guillotined Marie Antoinette, France’s last queen before the French Revolution of 1789, was shown clutching her severed head, singing: “The aristocrats, we’ll hang them.” Then, heavy metal band Gojira tore the Paris evening with screeching electric guitar.\n\nFreedom: Does anyone do it better than the French?\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Sylvie Corbet in Paris and Jim Heintz in Tallinn, Estonia, contributed.\n\nFor more coverage of the Paris Olympics, visit https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.
