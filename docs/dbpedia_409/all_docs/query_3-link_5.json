        "text": "Butch was an icon of our sport. A legendary figure revered by so many but also as you say Midway, very grounded with no pretense. I admired him for many reasons, but the fact that he was so approachable and down to earth said a lot about the man and where his many accomplishments fit into his life. When I first began shooting Olympic archery in the summer of 2003, I immediately recognized Butch as someone to emulate. Over the next year, I paid attention to everything he did thinking if I was going to learn it might as well be from the best in the game. I first had the chance to share a bale with him at the NFAA Indoor National event in Louisville where I watched him set the new national record. It was like watching a shooting machine at work. A month later at my first USAT, I looked at the scoreboard after 36 arrows and saw my name in 2nd place right behind Butch. Talk about a massive confidence boost. To be next to him on a leaderboard was priceless. I watched everything he did during that spring and summer because I knew he had a reason for everything he did. He wasted no motion or energy. It was easy to tell he approached the sport as a professional and I admired that so much. He respected the sport and he was confident in his abilities, but would also help anyone who asked, especially if it was right after he beat you. I took a number of beatings from Butch in events and during practice rounds at the Olympic games. Every time I saw him shoot I watched very carefully to see what I could learn.\n\nThe biggest confidence boost I ever had was when I finally beat him in our first match at the 2004 trials during the round robins. That win settled me down but I knew he would never let that happen again. And he didn't! Not at those trials and not at the 2012 trials when we competed again in the round-robins. Butch was the first person to congratulate me on making the team. He did that on the way to the bale after our last scoring end. I was speechless. Not only had he beaten me in that match but in true Butch fashion he had already calculated what I needed to shoot to finish 3rd and he was keeping another eye on Jason McKittrick's bale to see which of us would be his teammate. As soon as we scored and pulled arrows, he started giving me advice on how to prepare for the Olympics. The first thing he said was \"people are going to try and give you things. New equipment. Remember you made the team with the gear you have. Don't change a thing.\" I'll never forget that. He went on to tell me that he knew how I was feeling because he had been the \"unknown\" third team member along with McKinney and Barrs at the '92 Barcelona Games. That meant a lot to me.\n\nButch was such a force of nature. He was one of those athletes that no matter where he went on the field, everyone knew where he was. I saw him be incredibly kind and generous and I also saw him cut through a competitor with a single word or look. I think we all admired that he took no prisoners when he competed because if you ever did beat him, you knew you earned it.\n\nAs much as I admired Butch, I can say that he really \"married up\" when he met Teresa and he would have been the first one to admit it. In fact he did often. She is such a treasure. Every man should have a woman who looks at them the way Teresa looked at Butch. It is so hard to understand why people like him are taken from us before their time. Someday we will. Until then I will pray for Teresa to find peace in her heart.\n\nWhat a loss."
