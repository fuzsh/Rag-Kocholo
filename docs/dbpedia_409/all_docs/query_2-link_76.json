        "text": "ADRIAN, Mich. (CBS DETROIT) - For the first time in a decade, Adam Krug will spend next season in a different hockey arena.\n\n\"We're champing at the bit to take this next step,\" said Krug, who was part of Adrian Bulldogs' first NCAA men's hockey team during the 2007-2008 season. \"My coaching career is something that is important to our family, and I appreciate that about them. But right now, our emotions are kind of all over the place. We have a lot of people to say goodbye to.\"\n\nAfter accepting an assistant coaching position with the Bakersfield Condors, the AHL affiliate of the Edmonton Oilers, Krug immediately organized a Zoom call with his players to inform them of the news, albeit emotionally off the bat.\n\n\"The next order of business was to tell the guys, and that was very difficult,\" Krug said. \"I think some guys were a little surprised that it happened now and maybe that it was the professional level. I think a lot of guys thought that I'd be moving on to Division I ... But I think everyone had a sense that I was moving on at some point. I've had that questioned asked to me a lot over the last few years when I would recruit on campus or just even guys in exit meetings. They'd say 'Well, what's next for you? When are you leaving?'\"\n\nAs Krug has told athletes before, it only takes one person to give you an opportunity and believe in your talent. That one person giving Krug the opportunity to coach at the professional level is none other than his childhood idol, Paul Coffey.\n\n\"We were playing his son's [Blake] team in 2022 in this building actually, Hobart College, and we beat them in the NCAA quarterfinal. It just so happened that I looked at the ticket list that day, saw that his name was on it. He was a childhood idol of mine as a player. I played for a team out of Garden City named the Kings, and we wore the black and silver uniforms. I wore 77 because of Paul.\"\n\nKrug called his wife Lindsay, a former soccer player for Adrian College, and asked her to find the old jersey in the basement before the game. Krug's father was able to track Coffey down during the game, explain the connection and get the jersey signed. But that wasn't the end of their chance encounter.\n\n\"After the game, fortunately for me, Paul stuck around and we chatted for a little bit, just about hockey, and about our team, and the way we played, and how I coached,\" he said. \"We exchanged phone numbers and stayed in touch. Next thing you know, I'm getting a call from him during the Stanley Cup Final this year. I was shocked – I thought it had to be some kind of pocket dial.\"\n\nAt 41, the Livonia native is excited to take on a new job without the responsibility of running the entire show. This opportunity allows him to focus on the game a little more purely, but he will always call Adrian home.\n\n\"Being a Bulldog is one of the greatest things that has ever been a part of my life and really, my family's life ... Our kids have grown up their whole lives here,\" Krug said. \"Watching the guys connect with our kids – that's been probably my favorite part of this journey. But even the season ticket holders and the fans, the support we get from the community, it's really second to none.\"\n\nAt the time of resignation, Krug owned the highest winning percentage (.800) among all active head coaches across all divisions of NCAA hockey. He leaves with a 229-52-14 coaching record, the most memorable of them all leading to the 2022 NCAA National Championship, which was the first such in Adrian College history.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh had a muted response one day after the NCAA announced a four-year, show-cause order for the former Michigan coach due to impermissible contact with recruits and players during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"I'm stopping the engagement there with commenting. My only hope is that one day college athletics will be about what's best for the young men and young women who participate. That's really all I have to say about it,\" Harbaugh said on Thursday after practice\n\nThe show-cause order effectively bans Harbaugh from college athletics until August 2028.\n\nThe response to the penalty was markedly different from his reaction on Monday when he continued to deny having any knowledge of the impermissible scouting operation that triggered an NCAA investigation of Michigan during its championship run last year.\n\n\"Never lie. Never cheat. Never steal. I was raised with that lesson. I have raised my family on that lesson. I have preached that lesson to the teams I've coached. No one's perfect. If you stumble, you apologize and you make it right,\" Harbaugh said. \"Today, I do not apologize. I did not participate. I was not aware nor complicit in those said allegations. So for me, it's back to work and attacking with an enthusiasm unknown to mankind.\"\n\nThe recruiting case is unrelated to the NCAA's investigation into impermissible in-person scouting and sign-stealing allegations that roiled Michigan's 2023 championship season and resulted in the Big Ten Conference's three-game suspension of Harbaugh.\n\nThe NCAA said Harbaugh, who left his alma mater to coach the Chargers, \"failed to promote an atmosphere of compliance and violated head coach responsibility obligations.\"\n\n\"Harbaugh engaged in unethical conduct and failed to cooperate when he denied any involvement in impermissible recruiting contacts despite substantial information to the contrary,\" the NCAA said in a 48-page decision that several times suggested the coach was not truthful with investigators.\n\nHarbaugh will only face the punishment if he makes an unexpected return to college football within the next four years.\n\nThe order runs through Aug. 6, 2028. It requires any school hiring Harbaugh over the next four years to suspend him for the first full season. After that, Harbaugh would still be barred from athletics-related activities, including team travel, practice, video study, recruiting and team meetings until the order expires.\n\nHarbaugh's attorney, Tom Mars, said on Wednesday the coach was not invited to participate in the settlement process nor was he aware that an agreement had been reached between the school and the NCAA. He blasted the NCAA's punishment.\n\n\"The way I see it, from Coach Harbaugh's perspective, today's COI decision is like being in college and getting a letter from your high school saying you've been suspended because you didn't sign your yearbook,\" Mars posted on social media. \"If I were in Coach Harbaugh's shoes and had an $80 million contract as head coach of the Chargers, I wouldn't pay any attention to the findings of a kangaroo court which claims to represent the principles of the nation's most flagrant, repeat violator of the federal antitrust laws.\"\n\nGiants backup quarterback Drew Lock left New York's preseason opener late in the first quarter Thursday night against the Lions because of a hip injury, while Detroit backup Hendon Hooker sustained a concussion in the second half.\n\nLock, a six-year veteran who signed as a free agent in the offseason, went to his knees shortly after throwing a deep sideline pass on third down to Isaiah McKenzie with 2:03 left in the quarter in the Giants' 14-3 victory. He was looked at by trainers and went to the sideline.\n\nLock was 4 of 10 for 17 yards in getting the start with Daniel Jones and most of the offense sitting out. He was sacked two plays before leaving the field, but it was not clear when the injury happened.\n\nLocal hero Tommy DeVito replaced him for a fourth-down play from the Lions 39 but he only took a delay of game penalty and New York punted.\n\nLock said after the game he did not think the injury was serious and he could have gone back in if needed.\n\nLions coach Dan Campbell said Hooker was hurt on a run after leaving the pocket.\n\n\"That's what happens when you run, in this league, at the quarterback position,\" Campbell said. \"He was moving the football, I thought he was making some solid decisions before that. A lot of those were the runs. So, he made it happen with his legs.\"\n\nHooker and Nate Sudfeld are vying for the backup spot behind Jared Goff, who did not play in the opener.\n\nThe Lions also had second-year receiver Antoine Green sustain a concussion, defensive lineman David Bada had an Achilles' tendon injury and offensive lineman Connor Galvin hurt a knee. Bada and Galvin were carted off the field,\n\nJuan \"Chi Chi\" Rodriguez, a Hall of Fame golfer whose antics on the greens and inspiring life story made him among the sport's most popular players during a long professional career, died Thursday. He was 88.\n\nRodriguez's death was announced by Carmelo Javier Ríos, a senator in Rodriguez's native Puerto Rico. He didn't provide a cause of death.\n\n\"Chi Chi Rodriguez's passion for charity and outreach was surpassed only by his incredible talent with a golf club in his hand,\" PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan said in a statement. \"A vibrant, colorful personality both on and off the golf course, he will be missed dearly by the PGA Tour and those whose lives he touched in his mission to give back. The PGA Tour sends its deepest condolences to the entire Rodriguez family during this difficult time.\"\n\nHe was born Juan Antonio Rodriguez, the second oldest of six children, in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico, when it was blanketed with sugar cane fields and where he helped his father with the harvest as a child. The area is now a dense urban landscape, part of San Juan, the capital of the U.S. island territory.\n\nRodriguez said he learned to play golf by hitting tin cans with a guava tree stick and then found work as a caddie. He claimed he could shoot a 67 by age 12, according to a biography provided by the Chi Chi Rodriguez Management Group in Stow, Ohio.\n\nNo one from Puerto Rico had ever made it to the PGA Tour and Rodriguez was determined to not only get there but to beat the best. \"They told me I was a hound dreaming about pork chops,\" he once told Sports Illustrated.\n\nHe served in the U.S. Army from 1955-57 and joined the PGA Tour in 1960 and won eight times during his 21-year career, playing on one Ryder Cup team.\n\nThe first of his eight tour victories came in 1963, when he won the Denver Open. He followed it up with two the next year and continued through 1979 with the Tallahassee Open. He had 22 victories on the Champions Tour from 1985-2002, and had total combined career earnings of more than $7.6 million. He was inducted into the PGA World Golf Hall of Fame in 1992.\n\nHis playing record doesn't look like Hall of Fame material. He contributions to the game with his showmanship and charity and devotion to youth development was gigantic.\n\n\"You've got to be different,\" he said in an interview with Golf.com, according to the PGA Tour. \"You've got to be yourself in the world. That's what I always wanted to be.\"\n\nIn a social media post late Thursday, the PGA called Rodriguez \"a showman on the course, a tireless philanthropist off the course.\"\n\nHe started an academy for children in the Tampa, Florida, area in the 1970s, focusing on those who were at risk. \"Why do I love kids so much? Because I was never a kid myself. I was too poor to really have a childhood,\" Rodriguez once said.\n\nAnd his humor never left him. He had a passion for baseball, and when the U.S. Senior Open went to Canterbury outside Cleveland in 1996, he was asked why he was why he gave up the sport. \"I used to steal bases,\" Rodriguez said as the room erupted in laughter.\n\nRodriguez was perhaps best known for fairway antics that included twirling his club like a sword, sometimes referred to as his \"matador routine,\" or doing a celebratory dance, often with a shuffling salsa step, after making a birdie putt. He often irritated fellow players in what he insisted was meant as good-natured fun.\n\nHe was hospitalized in October 1998 after experiencing chest pains and reluctantly agreed to see a doctor, who told him he was having a heart attack.\n\n\"It scared me for the first time,\" Rodriguez recalled in a 1999 interview with The Associated Press. \"Jim Anderson (his pilot) drove me to the hospital and a team of doctors were waiting to operate. If I had waited another 10 minutes, the doctor said I would have needed a heart transplant.\n\n\"They call it the widow-maker,\" he said. \"About 50% of the people who get this kind of heart attack die. So I beat the odds pretty good.\"\n\nAfter his recovery, he returned to competition for a couple of years but phased out his professional career and devoted more of his time to community and charity activities, such as the Chi Chi Rodriguez Youth Foundation, a charity based in Clearwater, Florida, founded in 1979.\n\nThe foundation \"helps at-risk youth achieve academic, social, and economic success by keeping them engaged in their education and acquiring practical skills necessary to succeed at life,\" according to its website.\n\nIn recent years, he spent most of his time in Puerto Rico, where he was a partner in a golf community project that struggled amid the recession and housing crisis, hosted a talk show on a local radio station for several years, and appeared at various sporting and other events.\n\nHe showed up at the 2008 Puerto Rico Open and strolled through the grounds in a black leather coat and dark sunglasses, shaking hands and posing for pictures but playing no golf. \"I didn't want to take a spot away from young men trying to make a living,\" he said.\n\nSunny Choi has received clear instructions from her fellow New Yorkers: Bring a gold medal home, to where her sport started.\n\n\"I don't know how often people are like: 'You don't have a choice. Like, you've got to bring it home for New York,'\" said the 35-year-old breaker, who was born in Tennessee but now lives in Queens.\n\nChoi is one of four Team USA b-boys and b-girls, as competitors are known, competing at the 2024 Paris Olympics. At a news conference on Tuesday, all of them expressed their pride at being able to represent the roots of the sport, also known as breakdancing, in its Summer Games debut.\n\n\"[We] try and pay respect to where we're coming from, where this dance comes from, and want to put some of that shine back onto the community as we go onto this on the big stage,\" said Choi.\n\nWhile the sport has its roots in 1960s New York, there have been international competitions since the 90s and the sport appeared in 2018 at the Youth Olympics Games. Now, in 2024, it's hitting its biggest stage so far.\n\n\"We're going to have all eyes on us, so I just want to make sure that everyone understands what this dance is about and what hip hop is about, because it's all about peace, unity and having fun,\" said fellow Team USA breaker Viktor Montalvo.\n\nA DJ will spin the music — breakers won't know the selections ahead of time — as the competition unfolds on the Place de la Concorde.\n\n\"It's going to feel like a party,\" said breaker Jeffrey Louis, \"from the DJ who's providing the music, the vibe, we have the dancers, we have the crowd.\"\n\nAs Montalvo puts it: \"We already made history, so why not enjoy it?\"\n\nWhat's the schedule for breaking and when does it start?\n\nThe women's competition was held on Friday. The men's events take place at the same time Saturday.\n\nOver the five hours of competition, the 16 breakers will start in groups of four with one-minute battles. Dancers are scored by a panel of judges on their musicality, vocabulary, originality, technique and execution. The top two from each group will go to the quarterfinals and then semifinals, and the best-of-three medal round will determine who takes home the gold.\n\nIn the women's competition, Japan's b-girl Ami won gold at the Olympics' first breaking event by spinning, flipping and toprocking past a field of 16 dancers.\n\nAmi, whose legal name is Ami Yuasa, won all three rounds in a battle against b-girl Nicka (Dominika Banevič) from Lithuania to clinch the gold, wrapping up a long day of flow, rhythm and skill at Place de la Concorde stadium. Banevič won the silver medal, and China's b-girl 671 (Liu Qingyi) took the bronze after battling with b-girl India (India Sardjo) from the Netherlands to \"Boom!\" by The Roots. Liu is a relative newcomer to the breaking scene.\n\nThe U.S. women failed to move into the medal rounds after the round-robin competition. Logistx claimed three wins but it wasn't enough to push her to one of the two top spots needed to make the quarterfinal. Choi earned only two wins.\n\n\"I feel like I still shined and I feel like I still represented the dance and had some moments,\" Logistx said. \"It was such a big opportunity, it's such a big platform, and I'm really happy that we're here.\"\n\nTommy DeVito replaced an injured Drew Lock late in the first quarter and led New York on two first-half scoring drives that Eric Gray capped with runs of 48 and 1 yard as the Giants beat the Detroit Lions 14-3 Thursday night in a preseason opener limited to mostly backups.\n\nWith the game played in a light rain, neither Dan Campbell of the NFC North champion Lions nor Brian Daboll of the Giants was going to risk any starters in the contest at MetLife Stadium, close to where the teams held two fight-filled joint practices on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThe NFL was so upset with the fisticuffs, the teams were fined $200,000 apiece.\n\nThere was barely a shove in the game, and just as much scoring.\n\nBrandon Joseph intercepted Lock's pass over the middle and returned it 20 yards to set up a 53-yard field goal by former United Football League kicker Jake Bates with 3:21 left in the quarter.\n\nLock, who finished 4 of 10 for 17 yards, hurt his hip on the ensuing series and did not return.\n\nDeVito, who became a local hero when he made the Giants roster last year as an undrafted free agent and then started six games after Daniel Jones and Tyrod Taylor were hurt, combined with Gray to get New York on the scoreboard in the second quarter.\n\nGray, a fifth-round draft pick who has been overlooked in camp after a so-so rookie season, caught a third-down, 24-yard swing pass to ignite a six-play, 91-yard touchdown drive that he capped with his long run that featured a great move to get into the open.\n\nDeVito hit passes of 13 yards to Gray and 18 yards to tight end Tyree Jackson to set up Gray's 1-yard run. The drive started at the Lions 37 after Lions starter Nate Sudfeld was stopped by rookie Dru Phillips on a 4th-and-1.\n\nSudfeld played the first half and former Tennessee quarterback Hendon Hooker started the second in the fight to back up Jared Goff, who led the Lions to the NFC title game last season. Both are coming off ACL injuries. Sudfeld finished 13 of 24 for 96 yards and an interception. Hooker was 5 of 9 for 36 yards with four runs for 34 yards.\n\nBoth led the Lions inside the Giants 10 in the second half only to be stopped on downs.\n\nDeVito finished 8 of 15 for 92 yards. Gray ran four times for 52 yards and free agent Dante Miller had 12 carries for 63 yards.\n\nBates, who has a shot at being the Lions kicker after playing in the UFL with the Michigan Panthers last season, hit a 53-yarder but then missed the landing zone on the ensuing kickoff and the Giants started their drive on the New York 40.\n\nThe U.S. men's basketball team defeated Serbia 95-91 Thursday in the semifinals of the Paris Olympics, mounting a huge comeback after being down by double digits entering the fourth quarter.\n\nTeam USA scored six points in two seconds. And just like that, against what looked like overwhelming odds, the U.S. Olympic men's basketball team was on its way.\n\nSteph Curry scored 36 points, including a go-ahead 3-pointer with 2:16 left, and the U.S. will play for gold in the Paris Olympics on Saturday night against France after beating Serbia 95-91. The U.S. trailed by 17 points in the first half, plus faced an 11-point halftime deficit — the biggest one successfully overcome by an American team since NBA players were added to the Olympic mix in 1992.\n\nSerbia led by 11 with 7:19 left. The rest of the way, all U.S.\n\nIt'll be the U.S. against host France for gold in a dream matchup for the host nation on Saturday night, while Serbia will face Germany earlier Saturday for bronze.\n\nThe whole game changed in the fourth after a wild sequence saw the U.S. score six points in two seconds. Kevin Durant made a 3-pointer while Anthony Davis was getting fouled. The U.S. got another possession, and off the inbounds Devin Booker made another 3-pointer.\n\nJust like that, a 78-67 lead for Serbia was down to 78-73. The comeback was on, and Curry's 3 put the U.S. up for good. He added a pair of free throws with 8.2 seconds left to make it a two-possession game and the Americans escaped.\n\nJoel Embiid scored 19 points and LeBron James added 16 for the U.S., which is now assured of its 20th medal in 20 Olympic appearances.\n\nBogdan Bogdanovic scored 20 points for Serbia, which got 17 from Nikola Jokic and 15 from Aleksa Avramovic.\n\nSerbia coach Svetislav Petic kept saying the same thing all summer, that the team the U.S. put together for the Paris Games was better than any in Olympic history. Even the Dream Team, he insisted.\n\nA barrage of Serbian 3-pointers had the Americans squarely on the ropes, until the game changed in the fourth. The U.S. improved to 144-6 all-time in Olympic play, 63-4 since NBA players were added to the Olympics in 1992.\n\nThe comeback kept Kevin Durant's hopes of becoming the first four-time Olympic men's gold medalist very much alive,\n\nAnd of all the U.S. semifinal moments, this was like few others. The four-point final margin was the second closest in American history in the Olympic semifinals; the U.S. beat Lithuania by two in the 2000 semifinals in Sydney, on the way to gold there.\n\n(CBS DETROIT) - The NFL's Top 100 list for 2024 was released this week, and five Detroit Lions made the cut.\n\nThe players themselves voted on the NFL Top 100. Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill tops the list after coming close to Lions legend and NFL Hall of Famer Calvin Johnson's single-season receiving record.\n\nFresh off a historic 2023 season that saw the Lions clinch their first division title since 1993 and first playoff win since 1991, Detroit opens its preseason Thursday against the New York Giants at 7 p.m.\n\nHere's a look at which Lions made the NFL Top 100.\n\nNo. 22 Penei Sewell\n\nChecking in at No. 22, Penei Sewell is the highest-ranked Lion in the Top 100. The seventh overall pick out of Oregon in the 2021 NFL Draft, Sewell makes his debut on the NFL Top 100 after helping lead the way for a ground game that finished fifth in rushing yards and first on touchdowns. Sewell is considered one of the best tackles and run blockers and is a two-time Pro Bowl selection.\n\nNo. 23 Amon-Ra St. Brown\n\nAmon-Ra St. Brown moves up 44 spots on this year's list. In 16 regular-season games in 2023, St. Brown tallied 1,515 yards and 10 touchdowns on a career-high 119 catches. In three seasons in the Motor City, St. Brown has established himself as quarterback Jared Goff's favorite target. In 49 career games, the 2023 First Team All-Pro has amassed 3,588 yards and 21 touchdowns on 315 catches. St. Brown became the league's highest-paid receiver when he signed a $120 million contract extension in April.\n\nNo. 47 Aidan Hutchinson\n\nComing off a sensational rookie campaign that saw him finish second in the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year voting in 2022, Michigan native Aidan Hutchinson moves up 41 spots. Hutchinson was named a Pro Bowler after racking up 11.5 sacks in the regular season and ranking second in the NFL with 94 total pressures. The former Michigan Wolverine added three forced fumbles, a fumble recovery and an interception to his 2023 resume.\n\nNo. 48 Jared Goff\n\nIn his third season in the Motor City, quarterback Jared Goff led the Lions to their first NFC Championship Game appearance in 32 years. Goff moves up 18 spots this year after finishing second in the league in passing yards (4,575) and fourth in touchdowns (30). In May, the 29-year-old signed a four-year, $212 million extension that would keep Goff in a Lions uniform through the 2027 season.\n\nNo. 80 Sam LaPorta\n\nSam LaPorta had a sensational rookie campaign to earn his first Pro Bowl invite. The Iowa product set a tight end rookie record for most catches in a season with 86 receptions while averaging 10.3 yards per catch. LaPorta finished the regular season with 889 yards and 10 touchdowns. This marks his debut on the NFL Top 100 list.\n\nThe NCAA announced a four-year show-cause order for former Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh on Wednesday for impermissible contact with recruits and players while access was restricted during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe NCAA said Harbaugh, who left his alma mater to coach the Los Angeles Chargers after last season's national championship, \"engaged in unethical conduct, failed to promote an atmosphere of compliance and violated head coach responsibility obligations.\"\n\nThe NCAA had already put Michigan on three years of probation along with a fine and recruiting limits after reaching a negotiated resolution that was approved by the committee on infractions in the same matter.\n\n\"Today's announcement mirrors the resolution we negotiated with the NCAA enforcement staff that was subsequently accepted by the NCAA's Committee on Infractions in April 2024,\" the university said in a statement Wednesday. \"We have accepted the sanctions and have already served many of the penalties outlined in the findings. Our staff has worked to improve processes and we are focused on the future and our commitment to integrity and compliance.\"\n\nHarbaugh did not go along with the agreement, disputing allegations he failed to cooperate with investigators. Harbaugh's attorney, Tom Mars, has said the coach was not invited to participate in the settlement process or aware that an agreement had been reached between the school on the NCAA.\n\n\"The panel noted that Harbaugh's intentional disregard for NCAA legislation and unethical conduct amplified the severity of the case and prompted the panel to classify Harbaugh's case as Level I-Aggravated, with penalties to include a four-year show-cause order. Subsumed in the show-cause order is a one-season suspension for Harbaugh,\" the NCAA said.\n\nThe show-cause order covers 2024-28 and would require a school wanting to hire Harbaugh to suspend him for the first full season. After that, Harbaugh would be barred from athletics-related activities, including team travel, practice, video study, recruiting and team meetings until the order expires.\n\nThe recruiting case is separate from the NCAA's investigation into impermissible in-person scouting and sign stealing that roiled Michigan's national championship season in 2023 and resulted in a three-game suspension of Harbaugh by the Big Ten.\n\nThe multiple cases could open up Michigan to being deemed a repeat violator by the NCAA, which could trigger harsher sanctions. The fine was not announced, though NCAA guidelines call for a fine of $5,000 for mitigated Level I violations.\n\nThe NCAA, which also said Harbaugh is suspended for one season as part of its penalties, is barred from working at any NCAA school in an athletic-related capacity.\n\nMichigan State point guard Jeremy Fears is joining the team for an upcoming overseas trip and plans to play for Tom Izzo for the first time since he was shot last winter.\n\n\"Grateful for this opportunity to get to play some scrimmage games, and just being able to play again,\" Fears said Tuesday after practicing with the team. \"Who knows what could have happened? But I'm still able to play at 99%, back with my team, back at the program that I love. I can't really complain.\"\n\nIzzo said the redshirt freshman is close to 100% after seeing him in recent practices, preparing to leave next week for three scrimmages in Spain.\n\n\"The last 1% would be just getting back to playing basketball every day,\" Fears said. \"Obviously I didn't play for seven months.\"\n\nA five-star recruit from Joliet West High School in Illinois, Fears was shot in the leg last Dec. 23 while on holiday break in his hometown and endured a 3-hour surgery to remove the bullet from his left thigh. Investigators believe the victims — an unidentified woman — were inside the residence along with others when a male suspect armed with a handgun entered through the front door and opened fire before fleeing.\n\nFears acknowledged a lot has changed since he stepped on campus a year ago.\n\n\"I'm stronger, mentally and physically, on the court and in life,\" he said. \"Nothing can really stop you, but you. As long as I keep pushing and keep moving forward every day, it will get better.\"\n\nFears was granted a redshirt, giving him four more seasons of eligibility after he was limited to 12 games last season. He averaged 3.5 points and 3.3 assists in 15-plus minutes, and had a season-high 10 assists in a win over Stony Brook two days before he was shot.\n\nDetroit Lions defensive back Emmanuel Moseley is out indefinitely after he was injured in a joint practice with the New York Giants.\n\nLions coach Dan Campbell said Tuesday that Moseley could potentially return late in the season.\n\nESPN reported that Moseley tore a pectoral muscle.\n\nDetroit did get better news regarding other players banged up in a physical practice in New Jersey with the Giants.\n\nRookie cornerback Terrion Arnold, the No. 24 overall pick, cleared concussion protocol after colliding with Giants offensive tackle Andrew Thomas on Monday. Offensive guard Kevin Zeitler, a key addition in the offseason, is not expected to have a long-term shoulder injury after he was hurt in the first joint practice of the week.\n\nThe Giants will host Detroit on Thursday night in the preseason opener for both teams.\n\nThe Lions were counting on the 28-year-old Moseley to be part of their revamped secondary, but he has a significant injury for a third straight year. He played in only one game for Detroit last season, making his debut with the team in Week 5 after recovering from a knee injury only to have a second straight season-ending knee injury.\n\n\"That's tough,\" Campbell said. \"He's the one that has put so much work into coming back from two ACLs and it's frustrating.\n\n\"Look, you've got two decisions, you either rally one more time or you say, `You know what, enough's enough.' My gut's going to tell me that he's going to rally again, and nothing says that he may not be ready by the end of the year.\"\n\nMoseley started in 33 of 45 games for San Francisco from 2018 to 2022 and had an interception in each of his last four seasons with the 49ers before signing with the Lions.\n\nThe U.S. Swimming team is leaving the Paris Olympics with a total of 28 medals — eight gold, 13 silver and seven bronze — an impressive haul for the Americans after a slow start to the games.\n\nThe last swim event saw Team USA's women's 4x100 medley relay team of Regan Smith, Lilly King, Gretchen Walsh and Torri Huske break a world record on the way to claiming gold.\n\n\"It was incredible,\" said Smith. \"It was just so, so special to end on such a high note and push us in the lead for the medal count.\"\n\nOver on the men's side, Team USA capped off their time at the La Defense Arena with a silver in the the men's 4x100 medley relay with the team consisting of Ryan Murphy, Nic Fink, Caeleb Dressel and Hunter Armstrong.\n\n\"There's not many people that leave in Olympics 100% satisfied and I'd say Team USA is is definitely in that category,\" said Murphy. \"But I think it's one of those scenarios where a couple of weeks from now, we're going to be able to look back and feel really proud of the effort we put in to get these results and ultimately what ended up happening.\"\n\nOne thing Team USA is proud of, after some pre-Olympic banter, is having beaten Australia not only in total medals —18 for the Aussies — but in total gold medals, earning one more than their rivals.\n\n\"It's hard to call this a rivalry because, you know, a lot of us are such good friends, and we respect how well they compete,\" said self-appointed team cheerleader Kieran Smith. But he did add, \"I think we solidified ourselves again this summer as the world's strongest team.\"\n\nThat strongest team title was in question at the start of the Games, with Australia, Canada and France claiming the majority of gold medals for the first few days of swimming. But when asked about what the future of U.S. Swimming looks like, especially as the team looks ahead to being the hosts at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, Dressel says the slow start doesn't slow down any competition.\n\n\"Maybe it wasn't our best Games, but it doesn't mean I think we're any less attractive to be the ones to beat,\" said Dressel. \"The rest of the world is getting faster in the water. And there's nothing wrong with that. Makes the sport more exciting.\"\n\nIn addition to being exciting, Dressel admits swimming can be very emotional. He had a viral moment at that Games with cameras caught him crying after he failed to qualify for the butterfly final. It was a moment he says he hopes others learn from.\n\n\"I hope maybe I humanized the Olympic experience a little bit,\" said Dressel. \"It's just something that comes with the sport. It's not broadcasted as much and it shouldn't be, it should be the excitement and the joy around it. So yeah, I'm okay if that got brought out there. I'm not very good at hiding my emotions. And I was upset. It's as simple as that.\"\n\nDan Campbell and Brian Daboll wanted a highly competitive workout when the Detroit Lions and New York Giants opened two days of joint practices in New Jersey on Monday.\n\nAnd the two coaches may have gotten a little more than even they wanted.\n\nCornerback and Lions first-round draft pick Terrion Arnold left the field after a goal-line drill and was being evaluated for a possible concussion. Detroit veteran guard Kevin Zeitler, who was signed as a free agent, injured a shoulder early and left practice.\n\nIt appeared Arnold was hurt when blocked by Giants left tackle Andrew Thomas.\n\nThere were at least four scrums after plays where the players rushed to the altercation from all sides of the field and peace was eventually restored.\n\nThere were two involving Lions All-Pro receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, one with safety Dane Belton and the other with rookie cornerback Dru Phillips.\n\nThe scariest one for the Giants was seeing quarterback Daniel Jones rush into a scrum with his center Greg Van Roten down on the field and the Lions player on top of him.\n\nIt came one play after Jones hit his hand on the equipment of a Lions defender while making a throw.\n\nDaboll immediately took exception and yelled at the Lions to stay away from his quarterback, who was wearing a red no-contact jersey.\n\n\"A situation happens like that, you try to stand up for your guys,\" Jones said of running to Van Roten's aid. \"I thought it was good competitive practice all day today and we made some plays and did some good things. There are some things we need to sure up, for sure, but good intensity and competitive spirit today.\"\n\nGiants edge rusher Brian Burns, who had a couple of tackles for losses in the workout, later rushed onto the field to help break up a scuffle during the 11-on-11 drills.\n\nHe smiled when he heard Jones got involved in another.\n\n\"Oh, Lord. Daniel got jiggy with it. Daniel was out there with it? Yeah. I'm going to need him to back up.\" Burns said. \"Let his O-Line handle that. But Daniel, he's a competitor, man. He's a fighter. So, I don't expect anything less from him.\"\n\nThe teams will practice again on Tuesday and then play their preseason opener on Thursday at MetLife Stadium.\n\n\"I told them, 'Man, like we always do. We're competing and we're not pulling back,'\" Campbell said of his pre-practice talk with his team. \"But this will be evaluated like a game, so if you do something that's going to cost us in a game, that's part of your evaluation.' But we've got to go, we've got to get better, we can't just be tiptoeing either.\"\n\nCampbell was drafted by the Giants and spent his first four seasons with them, playing in a Super Bowl with them after the 2000 season. He led the Lions to the NFC title game last season as coach.\n\n\"The most important thing is that they understand what it took to get to where we were at even last year and just because we got to that point doesn't mean anything, so we start over,\" Campbell said.\n\nThe Giants made the playoffs in Daboll's first season in 2022 but they stumbled in '23, finishing 6-11 in a season where Jones tore his ACL in November. Daboll did not put any restrictions on him Monday.\n\n\"Again, it's practice,\" Daboll said. \"It's a competitive practice against two teams. We'll try to do it the right way. Dan and I have talked about it. We talked about it last year. We thought we got a lot out of it. But again, it's practice. It's just a higher-tempo practice because you're practicing against somebody else.\"\n\nThe Giants have stressed getting big plays this season, and Jones completed a couple of long passes to No. 1 draft pick Malik Nabers and second-year wideout Jalin Hyatt. Veteran Darius Slayton also caught a long pass.\n\nLions quarterback Jared Goff completed long passes to a wide-open Daurice Fountain on the second play of the 7-on-7 drill and later with Jameson Williams in a team drill.\n\nGiants inside linebacker Bobby Okereke intercepted Goff in the 7-on-7s and nose tackle Dexter Lawrence stuffed a run early.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh on Monday said he has no reason to apologize as he continued to deny having any knowledge of the impermissible-scouting operation that triggered an NCAA investigation of his Michigan program during its championship run last year.\n\n\"Never lie. Never cheat. Never steal. I was raised with that lesson. I have raised my family on that lesson. I have preached that lesson to the teams I've coached. No one's perfect. If you stumble, you apologize and you make it right,\" Harbaugh said after practice. \"Today, I do not apologize. I did not participate. I was not aware nor complicit in those said allegations. So for me, it's back to work and attacking with an enthusiasm unknown to mankind.\"\n\nHarbaugh left the Wolverines on Jan. 24 to become coach of Los Angeles, two weeks after he led his alma mater to its first national title since 1997.\n\nHarbaugh could face Level 1 NCAA violations — the most serious the association can levy to an individual — as part of an investigation into impermissible scouting and sign-stealing.\n\nMichigan is expected to receive a notice of allegations from the NCAA soon.\n\nA draft of the notice includes accusations of rules violations by Harbaugh and other staff members, including Sherrone Moore, who was promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach, three people briefed on the document told The Associated Press on Sunday.\n\nThe people spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the notice was confidential.\n\nConnor Stalions, a former low-level recruiting staffer, is accused of running an off-campus, advanced-scouting scheme for more than two years at Michigan. Stalions sent people to the games of Michigan's opponents to digitally record play signals to be used to steal signs during games. Advanced scouting and recording signs is against NCAA rules.\n\nHarbaugh was suspended twice for a total of six games last season, first at the start of the season for an unrelated NCAA investigation into recruiting violations. Michigan resolved its portion of that case in April and was placed on three years' probation.\n\nThe Big Ten suspended Harbaugh for the final three games of the 2023 regular season to punish Michigan for violating the conference's sportsmanship policy after its own investigation of the sign-stealing scheme.\n\nThe sign-stealing case is still likely months — at least — from being resolved. NCAA policy gives schools 90 days to respond to a notice of allegations. After a response, the school would be scheduled for a hearing in front of the NCAA's committee on infractions, though a negotiated resolution would still be possible.\n\nNo medal for Simone Biles on the balance beam this time. The American gymnastics star slipped and fell off the apparatus at the end of her acrobatic series during the beam finals at the 2024 Olympics in Paris on Monday, denying her an opportunity to add to the bronzes she won in the event at the 2016 and 2020 Games.\n\nWearing a blue-and-white leotard featuring over 5,000 crystals, Biles was more than halfway through her set when she couldn't quite keep her balance. The 27-year-old hopped off the beam and onto the mat while thousands inside a packed Bercy Arena — including NFL great Tom Brady — let out an audible \"ohhh.\"\n\nBiles received a score of 13.100, tied with U.S. teammate Sunisa Lee for fourth.\n\nThere was an extended wait for her score to post. At one point, Biles rolled her eyes in seeming annoyance knowing she wasn't going to finish on the medal stand.\n\nAlice D'Amato of Italy took the gold with a score of 14.366. Zhou Yaqin of China earned silver with a 14.100, just ahead of bronze medalist Manila Esposito of Italy. Italy, which won silver behind the U.S. in the team competition, had never medaled on beam before.\n\nBiles finished in a tie for fifth with Lee, whose hopes for a gold on beam she's long coveted ended in the middle of her routine when she fell during the end of her acro series, just like Biles did a few minutes later.\n\nThe 21-year-old Lee will still leave Paris with three medals just months after she was bedridden while trying to navigate a pair of chronic kidney-related diseases.\n\nWhile Lee's Olympics are over, Biles is also in the floor final later Monday, an event where she's never lost a major international competition, including a gold in Rio do Janeiro eight years ago.\n\n\"We were both just kind of annoyed just because we know what we're capable of,\" Lee said. \"We weren't able to get it done today, but she still has floor and she's the G.O.A.T., so she'll be amazing.\"\n\nThere is plenty of history on the line for Biles in what could be the last competition of her career. Biles has 10 medals in her Olympic career, including seven golds. A medal in the floor final would tie her with Czechoslovakia's Vera Caslavska for the second-most medals by a female gymnast in Olympic history, trailing only former Soviet Union great Larisa Latynina's 18.\n\nBiles has stayed relatively quiet on what lies ahead for her beyond the Paris Games, though she did nudge the door open a little for a possible return when the Olympics shift to Los Angeles.\n\n\"Never say never,\" Biles said after claiming her second Olympic vault title on Saturday. \"Next Olympics are at home. So you just never know. I am getting really old.\""
