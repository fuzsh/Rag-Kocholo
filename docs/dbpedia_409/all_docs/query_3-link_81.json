        "text": "The sport disappeared from the agenda after the 1908 London Olympic Games. There were fifty-seven archers from three nations that participated in archery at these Games. In 1920, in Belgium, thirty archers from three nations participated in archery in the Games.\n\nArchery disappeared again from the programme until 1972, when FITA (now known as World Archery) requested the International Olympic Committee (IOC) reintroduced archery into the Olympic Games’ agenda.\n\nThe round shot at this Olympic Games was a FITA round. It consisted of 36 arrows shot at 90, 70, 50 and 30 metres for men and 70, 60, 50 and 30 metres for women. Much like today, the two furthest distances for both men and women were shot on a 122-centimetre target face and the two closest distances on an 80-centimetre target face. To be crowned Olympic Champion, the archers participated in a double FITA round and their cumulative score for both rounds.\n\nSince then, the International Olympic Committee has accepted archery as a core Olympic sport, meaning it is always on the Summer Programme. There are currently 32 of these core sports.\n\nFlash forward to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, the most technologically advanced archery Olympic competition. During the Games, heartbeat monitoring was used to give even more statistics to the viewers.\n\nThe archers’ heart rates were monitored using cameras. The data was relayed to the production team who then produced the graphics for onscreen heart monitoring.\n\nAlong with that, a system called RyngDyng, developed by Archery Analytics, was used to measure arrow hits with remote cameras. These cameras sent a live result to the in-venue scoreboards, with graphics displayed on television broadcasts.\n\nArchery has not always been in the Summer Olympic programme. But why?\n\nWhen archery was first competed in at the Olympic Games, the home nation would create the rules and regulations that were followed in competition. This was allowed at the time as there weren’t any standardized competition rules as World Archery did not exist at this point.\n\nWhen a sport has inconsistent rules every four years, it makes it very hard to be able to train and prepare for the competition. Going into a competition that favours certain people does not sound all that fun. So going into an Olympic Games that is favoured towards the home nation, really did not entice other countries and their athletes.\n\nThis is why the IOC did not keep archery in the summer programme and it was removed from the Olympic Games.\n\nHowever, when World Archery (previously known as FITA) was created in 1931, this allowed for universal rules and regulations to be brought into place. The original members of World Archery were Italy, France, Poland, Sweden, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and the United States.\n\nThe creation of World Archery/FITA meant that archery competitions had rules and the IOC could see reasoning for allowing archery to be in the Olympic Games again. So, after 52 years, archery returned to the Olympic Games in 1972.\n\n2016 Rio Olympic Games saw Ricardo Soto competing at the age of 16. He was the youngest archer to compete at those Games. In the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo (held in 2021), there was a broad age range. Korean archer Kim Je Deok, who ranked first in qualification, was just 17 years old.\n\nThe average age of an archery Olympic medallist is 25 years old. Since 1984, all individual gold medallists have been 31 years old and younger. That’s not to say that over 31 year olds do not medal, statistics just say that they are more likely to medal in the team round than individually.\n\nButch Johnson was 41 years old when he made his Olympic debut. He won gold in the men’s team event in 1996. Then went on to win bronze in the team in 2000 at age 45 and also made the team in 2008 at the age of 53.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? You could be the next Olympic archery Champion! Get in touch with ArcheryUp and start your journey in archery today!\n\nArchery is practiced in primary school for about two hours a day as part of the curriculum. Through school, the children will work closely with coaches to progress through high school and college. This is how there is such a deep pool of elite archers within South Korea. After high school and college, they will look to being professional archers and shooting for teams, to then make the international team.\n\nOnce they make the elite level, archers will be training for about 10 hours a day. Shooting 2500-plus arrows in a week. There is a lot of mental prep that goes into training as well, so that is on top of the physical archery training and gym work that is required.\n\nDuring the South Korean trials for the Tokyo Olympics, the National Governing Body for Korean archery (Korea Archery Association (KAA)), built a replica of the Olympic venue, Yumenoshima Park Archery Field. They even found somewhere that would have similar wind conditions to Yumenoshima Park.\n\nWhile the team were preparing for the Games, they would train on the purpose-built venue so they could practice and train in the Olympic-like environment. This helped a lot when the team got to the venue as they knew what to expect to a better degree than other nations.\n\nIf an archer is part of a qualified team for the Olympic Games, their score and ranking will affect their nation’s team and mixed team seeding for elimination matches. Teams are ranked on all three archers scores from the ranking round. There is a maximum of 2160 points available for the team ranking round (3 times 720). Mixed teams are made up of the highest man and highest woman’s ranking from one nation. The maximum points available for a mixed team is 1440 (2 times 720).\n\nOnce the ranking round is completed and the elimination seedings have been produced, match play takes place. Elimination seedings work with highest ranked against lowest and continue down. For example\n\n– #1 seed v #64 seed\n\n– #2 seed v #63 seed\n\n– #3 seed v #62 seed\n\nAnd so on until the Olympic Champion is crowned.\n\nThe 2020 Olympic Games took place over a full week. The week started with qualification on Friday 23 July, followed by mixed team finals on Saturday, women’s team finals on Sunday and men’s team finals on Monday. Tuesday through until Thursday were the individual elimination matches.\n\nElimination matches for individuals consist of each archer shooting three arrows to make a set. Each set won gives two points, a drawn set is one point, and a lost set is no points. The archer that gets to six points, wins. When an archer wins a match, they progress through to the next stage of elimination matches and meet their next opponent for the next match.\n\nEach Olympic Games sport has a limited number of athletes that can qualify to compete. Archery has 128 spots available, 64 men and 64 women. In order to qualify for quota spots, nations must compete in specific qualification international events.\n\nThe qualification period can run from about two years prior through to just a few weeks prior to the Olympic Games. The 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games were the first Games to have the mixed team title contested for. This gave an extra avenue for qualification for nations.\n\nFor the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, there were a few ways for nations and individuals to qualify quota spots. Let’s have a look at how this was possible.\n\nWith 64 spaces available per gender, nations and individuals could qualify by:\n\n– 28 places were available at the 2019 World Archery Championships through eight teams and four individual places.\n\n– 8 places were available at Continental Games through five mixed team, top individuals in Asia, Europe, and Americas.\n\n– 13 places were available at continental qualifying competitions\n\n– 10 places were available at final qualifying competition\n\n– 3 places were for the host country, Japan\n\n– 2 universality invitations.\n\nIn June 2019, the World Archery Championships the largest amount of quota spots available for qualification took place. The top eight teams in both men and women won spaces during the qualifying competition. Along with this, the top four individuals from any nation that had not already qualified team spots won spaces.\n\nThe Continental Games included the Pan American, European Games, African and Pacific Games in 2019. The Pan American and European Games spots available were for the top-ranked mixed team and individual that had not already qualified through another avenue for their country.\n\nThe African and Pacific Games spots were for the top-ranked mixed team that had not already qualified through another method. In the circumstance where a country has already qualified one a quota spot in one of the two genders, the additional gender spot if awarded. The duplicate gender place is then transferred to the individual event.\n\nBetween Summer 2019 and Spring 2020, Continental Events took place around the world. Each continent held continent-specific qualifying competitions for countries that had not won any quota spots at that point. Each continent had a different amount of spots available:\n\nEurope – 4\n\nAsia – 3\n\nAmericas – 3\n\nAfrica – 2\n\nOceania – 1\n\nIn the final couple of months in the run up towards Tokyo 2020, there were final qualification competitions. These were for nations that had not qualified quotas to compete in. If a nation had not qualified a team quota, they could compete in the team competition. Individual competition was open for those nations without individual spots.\n\nIn order to qualify, the top three teams at the end of the qualification competition win the quota spots. If the nation already has any individual quota spots, they are returned. For the individual quota spots, initially there is only one quota spot available. However, there are usually quota spots returned throughout the qualification process, resulting in the top-ranked individuals winning spots.\n\nThe final way of getting spots is through the Universality Spaces. This process is done to help support sport development and equality in countries that have been identified by the International Olympic Committee. Every Olympics has this process to help progress the competitive ambitions of emerging sporting nations. There are two places available through this process.\n\nThe trials consisted of ranking rounds, the WA720 72 arrow around at 70 metres. Followed by team round simulations, head-to-head elimination matches, and round robin matches. Each trial gave a total accumulated point amount for each archer. That determined a final ranking.\n\nIn regard to selecting the team after the trials for each Games, it depends on how many quota places the USAT secured during qualification. If the USAT secured three spots, then the top three archers in the rankings will be nominated to the US Olympic Team. Fourth place will be nominated as the alternate for the team.\n\nIf only one quota space is secured during qualification, the top archer in the rankings would be nominated for the Olympic Team.\n\nNot only does an archer need to participate in the trials and come out on top, but they also need to be able to shoot to a Minimum Qualification Standard. This is set by World Archery and the International Olympic Committee. For the 2020 Olympic Games, male recurve archers were required to shoot 640, and women 605 on a WA720 70 metre round. This also needed to be achieved after June 10, 2019.\n\nArcheryUP is the perfect place to start archery.
