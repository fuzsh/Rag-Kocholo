        "text": "The winnowing took months, and it was merciless. At the swimming\n\ntrials, Sydney medalists Brooke Bennett, Megan Quann and Ed Moses\n\nall finished third or worse and saw their Athens dreams vanish.\n\nIn gymnastics, teenager Chellsie Memmel, world champion in the\n\nuneven bars, failed to survive a cutthroat selection camp. At the\n\nwrestling trials, former Olympic silver medalists Brandon Paulson\n\nand Dennis Hall grappled through nearly 11 minutes of overtime in\n\ntheir Greco-Roman final before Hall scored the winning takedown\n\nand the two fell into an exhausted embrace. But when the culling\n\nwas complete and the tears had dried, America had a new set of\n\nOlympians, 531 strong, drawn from 46 of the 50 states and, this\n\nbeing a land of immigrants, 20 countries. The U.S. team has 274\n\nmen, 257 women, 52 past gold medalists and 334 first-time\n\nOlympians, from 15-year-old swimmer Katie Hoff to 47-year-old\n\ntennis player Martina Navratilova (an immigrant, of course). It\n\nhas Northerners and Southerners, favorites and long shots,\n\nmillionaire pros and starving amateurs--all soon to bond in ways\n\nonly past Olympians fully understand. The U.S. Olympic Committee\n\nhas set a goal of 100 medals for this team, but unless swimmer\n\nMichael Phelps wins seven or more golds, no number will begin to\n\nsum up the glories and disappointments--the human stories--of the\n\nclass of 2004.\n\nMost Decorated\n\n--Jenny Thompson, swimming, 10 medals (eight gold). The\n\n31-year-old Columbia medical school student is competing in her\n\nfourth Games. She could finish with 13 career medals, which would\n\nput her in a four-way tie for third among Summer Olympians,\n\nbehind Soviet gymnasts Larisa Latynina (18) and Nikolay Andrianov\n\n(15).\n\n--Gary Hall Jr., swimming, eight medals (four gold). Despite\n\nhaving battled diabetes since 1999, the 29-year-old Phoenix\n\nnative and avid musician qualified for his third U.S. team. \"The\n\nbad news is I'm getting old,\" he says. \"The good news is, it\n\nproves I haven't been spending all my time playing guitar.\"\n\nHall's dad was also a three-time Olympic swimmer.\n\nYoungest\n\n--Katie Hoff, swimming, 15. The homeschooled ninth-grader from\n\nAbingdon, Md., is a club teammate of star Michael Phelps (page\n\n90) and could win a medal in each individual medley. She gets\n\nsome of her athleticism from her mother, Jeanne, a former\n\nStanford basketball great. The team's youngest male is boxer\n\nRau'Shee Warren, a 17-year-old southpaw from Cincinnati who will\n\nfight at 106 pounds.\n\nOldest\n\n--Elizabeth (Libby) Callahan, shooting, 52. The three-time\n\nOlympian is a retired Washington, D.C., police lieutenant who\n\nlearned to shoot five years after joining the force in 1975. \"If\n\nyou stay active it will keep you young for many years,\" she says.\n\n\"I've never related my accomplishments to my age.\" The oldest\n\nmale is archer Butch Johnson, 48, a 1996 team gold medalist who's\n\ngoing to his fourth Games. His Woodstock, Conn., house has an\n\narchery range in the basement.\n\nShortest\n\n--Courtney McCool, gymnastics, 4'9\". The 16-year-old from Kansas\n\nCity, Mo., was the all-around champ at the Athens Olympic test\n\nevent in March.\n\nTallest\n\n--Tim Duncan, basketball, 7 feet. The San Antonio Spurs forward\n\nwas a competitive swimmer in the U.S. Virgin Islands and dreamed\n\nof following the path of his sister Tricia, who swam in the 1988\n\nOlympics. But when Hurricane Hugo destroyed his local pool in\n\n'89, Duncan turned to hoops.\n\nStrongest\n\n--Shane Hamman, weightlifting. The 32-year-old superheavyweight\n\nfrom Mustang, Okla., has hoisted as much as 517 pounds overhead.\n\nThe 5'9\" 350-pounder can dunk with two hands, do a standing\n\nbackflip and perform a number of other jaw-dropping tricks. \"One\n\ntime I moved a Volkswagen Jetta over three parking spots,\" he\n\nsays. \"In three seconds I can rip a phone book in half.\"\n\nMost Controversial\n\n--Marion Jones, track and field. The five-time Sydney medalist is\n\nembroiled in the BALCO drug case, and in July two newspapers\n\nreported that her ex-husband, C.J. Hunter, had told investigators\n\nthat she had used performance-enhancing drugs before and during\n\nthe 2000 Olympics (an allegation she denies).\n\n--Tammy Crow, synchronized swimming. A judge agreed to postpone\n\nCrow's serving a 90-day sentence for two counts of vehicular\n\nmanslaughter until after the Games. Crow was behind the wheel in\n\na 2003 accident in California that killed her boyfriend and a\n\n12-year-old passenger.\n\nBrothers and Sisters\n\nThe eight sets of siblings include tennis players Serena and\n\nVenus Williams and swimmers Kalyn and Klete Keller and Dana and\n\nTara Kirk (the first sisters to make the U. S. Olympic swim\n\nteam). Identical twins Bob and Mike Bryan are the second brothers\n\nto represent the U.S. in Olympic tennis. The first: Joseph and\n\nArthur Wear, great-great-uncles of President George W. Bush, in\n\n1904.\n\nOther Family Ties\n\n--Taylor Dent, tennis, is the cousin of beach volleyball Olympian\n\nMisty May and the son of former Australian tennis star Phil Dent.\n\n--Hazel Clark and Jearl Miles-Clark, track and field, are\n\nsisters-in-law and will run the 800 meters--Miles-Clark for the\n\nfourth straight Games.\n\n--Rebecca Giddens, kayaking, is distantly related to suffragist\n\nSusan B. Anthony.\n\nMost Team Members\n\n1. California (140)\n\n2. Texas (29)\n\n3. Florida (25)\n\n4. New York (22)\n\nT5. Colorado (21)\n\nT5. Ohio (21)\n\n(Based on athletes' hometowns)\n\nNo Members\n\nDelaware, North Dakota, South Dakota and West Virginia.\n\nMost Superstitious\n\n--Lisa Fernandez, softball. Besides having lucky socks, shoes and\n\nglove, the star pitcher says she always follows the same pregame\n\nritual: \"I take a cup of water and drink three swigs. The first I\n\nspit out, the second I swallow, the third I spit out. Then I\n\nleave my cup in a specific hole in the fence by the dugout.\n\nFinally I have my catcher hand off my glove to me like a\n\nquarterback to a running back, and I burst onto the field.\"\n\nMost Artistic\n\n--Cheryl Haworth, weightlifting. The 2000 superheavyweight bronze\n\nmedalist is a junior at Savannah College of Art and Design. She\n\nspent eight weeks this spring working on a nine-foot-high pencil\n\ndrawing of a figure wearing a gold leaf crown, sitting on a rock\n\nsurrounded by serpents.\n\n--Cael Sanderson, wrestling. At Iowa State, Sanderson was\n\nundefeated on the mat (159-0 with four NCAA titles) and\n\nimpressive in his work as an art and design major. He plans to\n\npursue a career in advertising design.\n\nHero\n\n--Jason Read, rowing, is chief of operations for a volunteer\n\nrescue squad in Ringoes, N.J., and worked at Ground Zero after\n\nSept. 11.\n\nMiracle Man\n\n--Tony Azevedo, water polo. When the U.S. team's star was four\n\nand playing in his backyard in Long Beach, Calif., he fell and\n\nbroke open his trachea. At the hospital he stopped breathing for\n\ntwo minutes and doctors said he would be on a respirator for\n\nlife. He recovered in just eight months. \"I showed them,\" says\n\nAzevedo, 22, who's renowned for his toughness in the pool. \"My\n\nmotto is, you can overcome anything.\"\n\nMost Inventive\n\n--Steve Tucker, rowing. Tucker, a 35-year-old MIT-trained\n\nphysicist, created a training aid he calls an \"accelerometer\"\n\nthat he and partner Greg Ruckman, 30, a Harvard philosophy grad,\n\nwire into their lightweight doubles scull. The device measures\n\nspeed, oar-lock angle, seat position and other data, which the\n\nduo study later on a laptop or Palm Pilot.\n\nUniquely Funded\n\n--Carol Cronin, sailing. After the 40-year-old Yngling-class\n\n(three-person keelboat) racer lost five pounds on the Atkins\n\ndiet, she approached Atkins Nutritionals and received $244,000\n\nover two years in sponsorship for her team.\n\n--Mohini Bhardwaj, gymnastics. She received $20,000 in training\n\nfunds from Pamela Anderson, a former gymnast who wanted to help\n\nthe Cincinnatian make her first Olympic team.\n\nCraziest\n\n--Shawn Crawford and Reese Hoffa, track and field. Crawford, a\n\nsprinter, outran a giraffe but lost to a zebra on Fox's Man vs.\n\nBeast TV special in January 2003. Two years ago he wore a Phantom\n\nof the Opera mask during a 200-meter race in Milan; the mask\n\nslipped over his eyes, causing him to stray from his lane and be\n\ndisqualified. Hoffa, a pro wrestling fanatic, calls himself the\n\nUnknown Shot-putter. He, too, competed in a mask (black, with a\n\nred X on it) at a meet in California last year, but with better\n\nluck: He threw a then PR of 68'7\".\n\nWilliam Tell Award\n\n--Vic Wunderle, archery. The 28-year-old from Lincoln, Ill., once\n\ndemonstrated his sport in front of a class of kids by piercing a\n\nballoon and then hitting progressively smaller targets,\n\nculminating with a Tic Tac.\n\nNo Stopping Them\n\n--Collyn Loper, shooting. The 17-year-old trapshooter from\n\nBirmingham was born blind in her right eye, so even though she's\n\nrighthanded she shoots lefty.\n\n--Kevin Hall, sailing. In 1990, as a senior at Brown, he was\n\nfound to have testicular cancer and had both testicles and many\n\nabdominal lymph nodes removed. Now cancer-free, he takes weekly\n\ntestosterone injections, with approval from the U.S. and\n\ninternational governing bodies.\n\n--Rulon Gardner, wrestling. Since winning gold in Sydney, the\n\nGreco-Roman heavyweight from Afton, Wyo., has had a toe on his\n\nright foot amputated because of frostbite, survived a motorcycle\n\ncrash and--just weeks before this year's trials--dislocated his\n\nright wrist playing basketball.\n\nThe Doctor Is In\n\nSeveral Olympians are in medical schools or residencies. In\n\naddition, high jumper Amy Acuff (who made news by posing for the\n\nSeptember issue of Playboy) is studying to become an\n\nacupuncturist and doctor of Oriental medicine.\n\nOther Careers\n\n--Barb Lindquist, triathlon, will soon open a bed-and-breakfast\n\nin Alta, Wyo.\n\n--Lori Harrigan, softball, is a security supervisor for Las\n\nVegas's Bellagio hotel-casino.\n\n--John Magera, archery, is the refuge manager of the Middle\n\nMississippi River National Wildlife Refuge in Marion, Ill.\n\n--Jennifer Nichols, archery, is a dance instructor in Cheyenne,\n\nWyo.\n\n--Kathy Colin, kayaking, designs, develops and tests hardware and\n\nsoftware for military tactical data systems at a San Diego\n\ncompany.\n\n--Dan Kellner, fencing, was nominated for two Daytime Emmys for\n\nhis graphic-design work on the titles for The Rosie O'Donnell\n\nShow.\n\n--Ellen Estes, water polo, studied roller-coaster design as an\n\nengineering intern for Disney.\n\n--Tela O'Donnell, wrestling, was a fisherman in her native\n\nAlaska.\n\nFastest\n\n--Marty Nothstein, cycling.

The Beaverton, Ore., high schooler\n\nhas heard Ping-Pong jokes all her life.\n\nHot List\n\n--Dain Blanton, beach volleyball. The 2000 gold medalist was a\n\nfinalist last year to star in The Bachelor.\n\n--Jennie Finch, softball. The pitcher was named one of PEOPLE's\n\n50 Most Beautiful in May.\n\n--Amanda Beard, swimming. The breaststroker has posed for Maxim\n\nand FHM.\n\nMelting Pot\n\nThirty team members were born in other countries, and they, along\n\nwith those with strong ties to their heritage--like diver Kimiko\n\nSoldati, whose Japanese-American grandparents were held in an\n\ninternment camp in Idaho after Pearl Harbor--give the delegation\n\na strong multicultural character. A few of the foreign-born\n\nstandouts:\n\n--Colleen De Reuck, track and field. The three-time South\n\nAfrican Olympian, who moved to Boulder, Colo., in 1993 and\n\nbecame a U.S. citizen in December 2000, was the surprise winner\n\nof this year's U.S. marathon trials at age 39.\n\n--Meb Keflezighi, track and field. His family left the African\n\nnation of Eritrea in search of a better life and, after a year in\n\nItaly, settled in San Diego in 1987. \"I'm always thankful,\" says\n\nKeflezighi, a 29-year-old UCLA grad who'll run the marathon in\n\nAthens.\n\n--Mary Sanders, rhythmic gymnastics. The 18-year-old Toronto\n\nnative, a dual citizen, chose the U.S. over Canada to honor her\n\nlate American-born dad, Fred, the 1963 Big Ten trampoline\n\nchampion for Michigan. \"Since my father was an American gymnast,\n\nit's always been in my mind to compete for the USA,\" she says.\n\n\"He taught me to fight for my goals, so I want to make him\n\nproud.\"\n\n--Jasna Reed, table tennis. The 33-year-old Chicago resident was\n\nborn in what is now Bosnia-Herzegovina and won an Olympic bronze\n\nfor Yugoslavia in 1988. She gave the medal to her grandmother,\n\nbut it was lost 12 years ago when Serb troops stormed her\n\nhometown.\n\nHe's Greek to Me\n\nThen there's Tom Pappas, the decathlon world champ from Glendale,\n\nOre. His great-grandfather was born in Greece, and Pappas plans\n\nto meet up with distant relatives at the Games. He often receives\n\ne-mail from Greeks asking him to change his citizenship and win\n\ngold for their country this summer.\n\nPIONEERS\n\n--Aquil Abdullah, 31, is the first black man to make the U.S.\n\nOlympic rowing team.

It was Lawson who introduced Dirrell to the sport, at age10, to keep him off the streets of Flint, Mich., and who latertried to inspire him by arranging a chat with an oldacquaintance, Andre's idol, Muhammad Ali. (As a 10th-grader in1957, Lawson trained with Ali, then 15 and known as Cassius Clay,at a Louisville gym.) What words of wisdom did Ali give to theyoung fighter? \"Listen to your granddaddy.\"\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: PORTFOLIO BY MICHAEL O'NEILL NEW YORK BORN AND RAISED The best U.S. fencing team in history has a strong New Yorkflavor. Of the 17 members and alternates, five are from the BigApple, including (from left) Erinn Smart, alternate TimMorehouse, Keeth Smart (Erinn's brother) and Ivan Lee. Lee andthe Smarts, all from Brooklyn, are products of the PeterWestbrook Foundation, an inner-city sports program launched bythe 1984 sabre bronze medalist. Last year Keeth became the firstU.S. fencer to earn a No. 1 world ranking, in sabre.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: PORTFOLIO BY MICHAEL O'NEILL Dynamic Duo When Kerri Walsh, then a shy 15-year-old, first playedvolleyball against Misty May, Walsh was so impressed by her idol,16 and a high school superstar, that she asked May for anautograph. Seven years later the two Californians met on the probeach circuit, became friends and decided to team up. They're nowranked No. 1 in the world, having run off a recent 90-matchwinning streak. Their coach, Dane Selznick, describes theno-longer-starstruck Walsh (above, left) as a \"caged cat\" who\"pounces on you\" and May as \"the opposite--calm, cool andcollected.\" Says Walsh, \"We complement each other very well.\"\n\nB/W PHOTO: PORTFOLIO BY MICHAEL O'NEILL Fond Farewell Athens will likely be the swan song for five stars who helpedbring women's soccer into America's consciousness.

Vaho, 40, is originally fromthe Republic of Georgia and won a gold medal in 1988 for theSoviet Union. Mary Beth, 30, from Munkwonago, Wis., was the firstAmerican woman to compete in the modern pentathlon, at the 2000Olympics.

But even on this stellarteam, Catchings will be one.\n\nB/W PHOTO: PORTFOLIO BY MICHAEL O'NEILL The Juggernaut Two straight Olympic gold medals, a No. 1 world ranking for 18consecutive years, only five losses in international play since1986--it might seem as if the U.S. women's softball team has runout of challenges. But coach Mike Candrea found one last October,when he put his 18 players through the Navy SEAL training coursein San Diego. First baseman Leah O'Brien-Amico says of theexperience, which included doing hundreds of push-ups and holdingboats overhead, \"We were all dying, but finding some way,somehow, to push through.\" The training has paid off so far: In53 pre-Olympic games, the team was undefeated and outscoredopponents 476-14 (top hitters: third baseman Crystl Bustos, witha .500 average and 94 RBIs, and outfielder Kelly Kretschman, witha .481 average). The pitching aces are Lisa Fernandez, 33, whowas 13-0 with a 0.21 ERA in pre-Olympic play, and 23-year-oldJennieFinch, who had a 0.27 ERA. Says Fernandez, \"Othercountries are getting better and coming after us, but you alwayswant to be the best. The SEALs reminded us of that.\" (Front row,left to right: CF Laura Berg, 2B Lovieanne Jung, O'Brien-Amico,OF Nicole Giordano.
