        "text": "\"All of a sudden sales of bows have, like, tripled,\" said Paul Haines, a salesman at the Ramsey Outdoor store in Paramus, New Jersey.\n\nA manager there made a sign for the hunting department: \"Quality bows for serious archers and girls who saw the movie,\" he said.\n\nArchery ranges around the country have enjoyed a steady uptick among kids of both sexes since the movie began cleaning up at the box office March 23, though heroine Katniss -- a deadly shot with an arrow -- seems to resonate more with girls.\n\n\"Katniss is so inspiring,\" said Gabby Lee, who asked for archery lessons for her 12th birthday in February after reading the wildly popular book trilogy by Suzanne Collins.\n\n\"I'm not very sportsy,\" she offers, but now she belongs to a youth archery league near her Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, home. \"It feels really good because I'm usually the girl who sits and reads.\"\n\nWhile some young archers have been doing it for years, motivated by generations of hunters in their families, the parents of others love it for its focus, independence and because they, too, have kids not drawn to more typical team or contact sports.\n\nAt 7, Christa Mattessich is too young for the gruesome dystopian world that thrusts 16-year-old Katniss and her fellow child tributes into the arena for a battle to the death, a battle Katniss wins thanks to the archery skills she honed while hunting game in the woods of her native District 12.\n\nBut Christa loves archery just as much and has been shooting for about two years at the same range as Gabby, Targeteers Archery in Saddle Brook, N.J., said dad Anthony Mattessich in Oakland.\n\n\"I'm an avid bow hunter,\" he said. \"At her age, with other sports, they're just running with each other and chasing a ball, then the ice cream truck comes and that's that. For archery, they're a little bit more dedicated.\"\n\nAbbey Fitzpatrick in Sandy Creek, New York, turned 11 on April 10. She also asked for and received her own bow and arrows for her birthday. \"It's black. It really looks like Katniss's bow,\" Abbey said. \"She was so brave and very heroic in the games.\"\n\nLike more than 2 million kids in nearly every state and several other countries, Abbey did archery in gym class this year as part of the decade-old National Archery in the Schools Program that trains teachers in the sport and offers discounts on equipment.\n\n\"There's a lot of buzz among young people about archery right now. They want to shoot bows and arrows so badly they're willing to follow the rules,\" said Roy Grimes, the organization's president.\n\nIn Michigan, enthusiast Robert Jellison teaches seventh-grade science and has incorporated archery through NASP into his lessons on kinetic and potential energy, eye-hand coordination and the properties of pulleys and levers.\n\nJellison was invited in March with some of his students to perform a demonstration at the local library as part of a \"Hunger Games\" reading.\n\n\"Some of the kids there went out that day and signed up for archery,\" he said. \"A lot of people look at archery as, 'Oh, you know, is it a real sport?' All of a sudden there's all this excitement.\"\n\nBobbi Bowles owns archery shop K.C.'s Outdoors with her husband in Spicewood, Texas, outside Austin. Sales of equipment have doubled in the last few weeks, she said, and they're adding beginner classes to accommodate more new recruits young and older.\n\nAt the Austin Archery Club, \"The movie is sending a lot of people our way who are interested in archery, the crossbow and survival skills,\" said a director, Roy Wenmohs. \"At a recent tournament we had about 10 young people, from ages 10 to 15,\" he said. \"About half were new. Last year we had three.\"\n\nGames of a different sort are hoping for a \"Hunger Games\" bump come July, though kids in North America looking to catch Olympic archery will likely be sleeping during live competition."
