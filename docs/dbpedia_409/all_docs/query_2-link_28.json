        "text": "One of the most adrenaline-pumping sights in an athletics event, a relay race is viewed as the ultimate example of teamwork and coordination.\n\nThe concept originated in ancient Greece, where a ‘message stick’ was passed along via a number of couriers.\n\nIn modern times, a relay race is a track and field event listed in the Olympic Games under the ‘athletics’ programme.\n\nAt the Olympics and other World Athletics-sanctioned tournaments, a relay race is an event where a team of four athletes run equal predetermined distances in a sprint race, each passing a rod-like object called the ‘baton’ to the next person to continue the race. The last runner in a relay is called the ‘anchor’.\n\nThere are also other types of relays – like sprint medley relays (where each runner runs progressively longer distances like 200m, 400m, 800 metres and so on), long distance relays (which have more than five legs) and cross-country relays. However, they are not part of the Olympic or World Athletics events.\n\nThe two relay races in the Olympics are the 4x100m and 4x400m for both men and women and mixed.\n\nThe first relay race in the Olympics was held at the London 1908 Summer Games. It was a 1600m race run by four runners starting with two 200m splits, followed by 400m and then the 800m. The first Olympic 4x100m relay race was held at Stockholm 1912. The women's race made its bow at Amsterdam 1928.\n\n4x100m relay\n\nThe 4x100m relay is an event where a relay team of four members each run a distance of 100m in a single designated lane.\n\nDuring each leg run, the athlete has to carry a baton and hand it over to the next team member.\n\nThe baton exchange has to happen within a 20m changeover box, located 10m before and 10m after the start of each leg, starting from the second relay runner.\n\nA team can be disqualified if any member drops the baton during the handover or if the handover occurs outside the designated area. The runner finishing the race will generally be the fastest sprinter in a team.\n\nThe 4x100m relay was introduced as a men’s only event at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, while the women’s event was first run at the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam.\n\n4x100m relay world records\n\nMen – 36.84 seconds set by Jamaica during London 2012 (Nesta Carter, Michael Frater, Yohan Blake, Usain Bolt)"
