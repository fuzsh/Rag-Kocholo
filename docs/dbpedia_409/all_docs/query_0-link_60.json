        "text": "Not many towns the size of Webster can boast two participants from an Olympiad, let alone two medalists.\n\nSo when Jason Gailes came home from Atlanta with a rowing silver in 1996, he wasn't quite overshadowed by Butch Johnson's archery gold. In fact, the former Bartlett High basketball standout had helped write a scintillating chapter in U.S. rowing history.\n\nWith Tim Young, Brian Jamieson and Eric Mueller, Gailes powered their quadruple sculls to Team USA's only men's rowing medal of the 26th Olympiad, placing second to Germany and ahead of Australia. That year, Gailes was named an Athlete of the Year by the U.S. Olympic Committee, the only rower so selected.\n\nThough Gailes plays down the scenario, if it hadn't been for current Boston College basketball coach Al Skinner, Gailes may have never stroked in the Olympics.\n\nGailes, a 6-foot-4 forward in high school, wanted to walk on to the University of Rhode Island basketball team upon enrolling in 1988. But Skinner, who was in his first year as URI coach, told him the only 13 players on his team would be the ones on scholarship.\n\nNow Gailes needed a sport - he always participated in three a year throughout his Bartlett days.\n\n\"I went to the first recruiting meeting in the fall, and it looked pretty cool,\" Gailes said of his introduction to the URI men's rowing club. \"Everyone seemed happy and easy to get along with, so I figured I'd give it a try. And it wasn't long until I was totally hooked.\"\n\nAfter his sophomore year at URI, instead of going home for the summer, he attended a camp at the Pennsylvania Athletic Club on the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia with a couple of Rhody teammates.\n\n\"I really learned how to race down there, and when I came back to school, I found that I was at a different level,\" he said.\n\nThough URI's program competed primarily against club and Division 3 varsity outfits, Gailes continued to make progress toward the next level. After graduating in 1992, he made the national team the following year, even unseating Olympians from the Barcelona games of the summer before.\n\nAfter participating in the World Championships in 1993 and '94 to the tune of 13th-place finishes, he enjoyed a fine run at the '95 Pan American Games in Argentina, with a fourth-place showing in a two-man boat and striking silver in quadruple sculls. A sixth-place finish in that event at the '95 Worlds set the stage for the Atlanta Games.\n\nThe hard work paid off in the memorable experience in Georgia, one he looks back on with pride. \"If I could do it all again, I'd do it 10 times over,\" he said.\n\nThe silver-medal performance in Atlanta was Gailes' last in a boat for quite a while. \"I was burnt out mentally,\" he said. \"I had trained incredibly through college and afterward. Plus, I was nervous about not having a real job.\"\n\nGailes has lived in San Francisco since 1997, working in finance, and has been with a global investment bank for the past 10 years. Of course, he again had to find a sport, a way to enjoy staying in condition. First it was mountain biking, then road cycling.\n\n\"(Road cycling is) an incredibly popular sport out here, year-round,\" said Gailes, who at age 38 will leave bachelorhood in October and marry Rachel Ward (not the actress). \"It's a social sport, meeting new people - and you see a lot of the Bay Area, a really beautiful part of the country.\"\n\nAnd again, Gailes was finding success, but after about two years, he found more stress than he wanted in an athletic endeavor. \"I found I was moving up the categories, and it was getting exponentially more competitive,\" he said.\n\nSo where did he go from there? Back to rowing, of course, for the first time in nine years. In the summer of 2005, he started competing in masters events in the U.S. and Canada out of the Marin Rowing Club, often with and against rowers in their 60s and 70s, many of them also former Olympians who remain extremely competitive. Gailes even reunited with Olympic boatmates Young, Jamieson and Mueller at the Head of the Charles that year.\n\n\"I never would've though he'd get involved in a pursuit like that, but he became so passionate about it,\" said Don Cushing, the former Bartlett boys' basketball coach who saw Gailes help his teams through some remarkable runs in the Central Mass. Tournament. \"He was a real stallion out there. He's one you really wanted to have in your program.\"\n\n\"My coaches at Bartlett, they were great people to take advice from,\" Gailes said. \"I was really lucky to have those people show the way.\"\n\nOlympics: 1996 (Atlanta) Sport/event: Rowing/men's quadruple sculls (silver medal) Central Mass. connection: Lived in Webster, graduated from Bartlett High What is he doing now: Global investment banking in San Francisco Coming tomorrow: Swimmer Alice Bridges of Uxbridge\n\nJason Gailes"
