        "text": "The 2024 summer Olympics are less than a week away. Soon all eyes will turn to Paris as athletes will gather to either make their name or defend their status from all over the world.\n\nWhether or not you care for the sport in question, there's always a special thrill when you learn that your hometown or state is being represented on the world stage. For that moment thousands of people hear your town's name. Granted, they'll forget it in the next three seconds, but it's there!\n\nSo, what about our little corner of the world? Has Massachusetts produced any gold ranking Olympians?\n\nOf course. Here are five athletes from the state you have stood on the top of the podium in past games.\n\nGold Medalists from Massachusetts\n\nAly Raisman, Needham\n\nRaisman took home two gold medals in the 2012 London games in gymnastics. She became the first U.S. woman to win a gold medal on for the floor exercise. She also won a gold medal in the team event when she returned for the 2016 games in Brazil. In total, she has six medal, three gold, two silver and one bronze.\n\nDavid Browning, Boston\n\nBrowning won the gold for men’s springboard diving in the 1952 Helsinki games. Perhaps even more memorable that his medal, he famously attempted to steal an Olympic flag in a fit of excitement.\n\nRichard Johnson, Worcester\n\nJohnson won a gold medal as a member of the U.S. team at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. He's a five-time Olympic archer who competed in every Summer Olympic Games from 1992 to 2008. He was born in Worcester, growing up in nearby Webster, but spend most of his life in Connecticut.\n\nJayson Tatum\n\nJayson Tatum might not have been born in Massachusetts, but as one of the stars of the Celtics, we're claiming him. In the 2020 games, he was part of the men's basketball team that clinched a gold medal.\n\nTim Daggett\n\nFrom Western Massachusetts, Tim Daggett was part of the gold medal-winning men’s Olympic Team in 1984 at the Los Angeles games. Memorably, he scored a perfect 10.0 on the horizontal bar, which was a key part of the team winning that gold medal. To this day, he's involved in the sport through his own gym and as an Olympic commentator for NBC. You'll hear him at the games this year.\n\nMassachusetts athletes competing in Paris 2024\n\nHere are some of the Massachusetts residents to watch for next week in Paris representing the Bay State.\n\nStephen Nedoroscik - Grew up in Worcester and competing in the gymnastics on the pommel horse.\n\nFred Richard - From Stoughton, competing in gymnastics. Richard won the Olympic trials.\n\nJennifer Mucino Fernandez - Boston native competing in archery\n\nJayson Tatum, Tremont Waters, and Derrick White - Play for the Boston Celtics, competing in basketball.\n\nEli Dershwitz - Grew up in Sherborn and competing in fencing (sabre).\n\nAlly Hammel - Grew up in Duxbury, competing in field hockey.\n\nStephen Nedoroscik - Grew up in Worcester and competing in the gymnastics on the pommel horse.\n\nKristi Wagner-From Weston, competing in rowing. It's here second Olympic games.\n\nMargaret Hedeman - From Boston, competing in rowing\n\nHenry Hollingsworth - From Dover, competing in rowing.\n\nRuby Remati - From Andover, competing in Olympic swimming\n\nKristi Kirshe - From Franklin, competing in rugby"
