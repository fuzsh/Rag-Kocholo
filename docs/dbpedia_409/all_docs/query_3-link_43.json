        "text": "While thousands anxiously watched inside Barcelona's Olympic Stadium and millions upon millions more watched on televisions across the globe, archer Antonio Rebollo raised the tip of his arrow to the Olympic torch held by Barcelona basketball star Juan Antonio San Epifanio. With the arrow quickly set ablaze, Rebollo pulled back his bow and took careful aim at the Olympic cauldron rising above the stadium. Seconds later, he released the flaming arrow, dramatically shooting it over the cauldron and igniting it to open the 1992 Summer Olympics.\n\nA replica of that arrow is in a display case at the Easton Archery Center of Excellence, which is part of the Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, California. When Khatuna Lorig sees the arrow while training there now, she fondly recalls that stirring moment.\n\n\"We were like, 'Oh, wow, it's archery!'\" she says. \"Walking into the stadium and seeing that fire, seeing the torch go on, is what gave me energy. 'This is the Olympics! Game on! This is why we're here.'\n\nArchery is why Lorig is where she is now, living in America and, at age 42, trying to compete in her sixth Olympics. If it weren't for the sport, she says, \"I'd be milking cows in Georgia.\" And by Georgia, she doesn't mean the southern Peach State, she means the country on the edge of Eastern Europe and west Asia where she was born when it still was part of the Soviet Union.\n\n\"Archery has given me a life -- traveling to Olympics and nations -- and it got me a lot of friends,\" Lorig says. \"It's taught me a lot about how to stay strong and deal with losing and winning. I wouldn't be here without archery. It kind of has saved my life in a lot of ways.\"\n\nIf Lorig qualifies for the Rio squad -- the next step in that process: this weekend's Olympic trials in Newberry, Florida -- she would be competing on her fifth continent, after Europe (1992 Barcelona and 2012 London), North America (1996 Atlanta), Australia (2000 Sydney) and Asia (2008 Beijing). Lorig has competed for three nations -- the former Soviet Union's Unified Team in 1992, Georgia in 1996 and 2000, and the United States in 2008 and 2012. She has a 23-year-old son with whom she was pregnant during her first Olympics in Barcelona. Oh, and she taught Jennifer Lawrence how to shoot arrows for \"The Hunger Games.\"\n\nAs Lorig says of the autobiography she hopes to write, \"Oh my God -- my book is going to be big and heavy.\"\n\n\"The one thing I learned from Khatuna is perseverance,\" U.S. archer and Olympian Brady Ellison says. \"She's been in this quite a while -- she started when she was very young -- and it just shows that if you continue working hard, you can stay in this sport for a long time. And her attitude, her toughness, that she is always right there at the Games -- it's inspiring.\"\n\nU.S women's archery coach Guy Krueger says Lorig has taught her teammates two important things: \"A, that archery will change your life, and B, that it is a way of life.\n\n\"This is a big part of who she is, especially for the younger generation,\" he says. \"These days, it's very difficult for them to imagine doing the same thing for 25 or 30 years. It's very difficult, but she brings that perspective. Also her hard work. She's been one of the hardest-working athletes we've had. To be able to handle that over that long a career is pretty impressive.\"\n\nTo fully appreciate just how impressive, take a look back at Lorig's Olympic history.\n\n1992 Barcelona\n\nLorig was born on New Year's Day in Tbilisi, Georgia in 1974. What was life there like then? \"Think of having a black and white TV, and you only get to watch 15 minutes a day when it's dark at night. That's what Georgia was like,\" she says.\n\nThen named Khatuna Kvrivishvili, she started in archery at age 13, though she wasn't allowed to shoot an arrow until months later. Instead, she says, her coaches required her to simply hold the bow until they were satisfied by her mechanics. \"When you start, for eight months you just stand in front of a mirror and pull the bow. It's called SPT -- Soviet physical torture,\" she says with a laugh. \"No -- Soviet physical training.\"\n\nOne day, Lorig says she and other archers sat inside a tiny, dark room staring at a computer screen where two parallel lines framed a square. As they did so, loud noises would occasionally erupt. If the archers reacted too much, they received an electric shock. This was done to teach them to maintain concentration rather than be distracted. \"It was interesting and scary,\" she says. \"I'm glad they didn't continue to do that.\"\n\nWhen she was finally was allowed to shoot arrows from the bow, her second arrow hit the first one, arrow on arrow. Her fellow archers joked: \"Oh, she's going to be a great shooter.\" But it was no joke.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union in late 1991, 12 of the USSR's former republics, including Georgia, competed at the 1992 Olympics as the Unified Team. As good as Lorig was, Unified Team officials tried to kick her out after learning she was four months pregnant. She says they were using her pregnancy as an excuse because they didn't want Georgians on the team.\n\nIn the end, she remained and helped the team win bronze in the women's team competition.\n\nShe married fellow archer Archil Onasvili (whom she would divorce in 1995 and then remarry in 2006), then gave birth to her son, Levan, in January 1993. He also is an archer with a goal of competing in the Olympics, perhaps in Tokyo in 2020, maybe alongside his mother.\n\nDenise Parker, CEO of USA Archery, was also in those 1992 Olympics, as an archer with the U.S. team. That is where she first encountered Lorig, whom she would get to know better in later years.\n\n\"I know what I remember about Khatuna, and I still think it to this day -- she is such a tough competitor. She is intimidating. She is strong. She doesn't give you an inch,\" Parker says. \"If you go up against Khatuna, you have to beat her because she is not going to cave in.\"\n\n1996 Atlanta\n\nWith the Soviet Union gone, Lorig represented the then-independent nation of Georgia in '96.\n\n\"It was funny,\" says Lorig, who finished 49th in her event that summer. \"During the opening ceremonies, they said, 'The country of Georgia,' and the whole stadium went up. 'Do they mean Georgia Georgia?'\"\n\nLorig says life in the former Soviet Union was better than most people assume - \"Nobody could say we were hungry and starving\" -- and conditions worsened considerably in Georgia after the collapse of the USSR.\n\n\"In 1996, there was no electricity, no food. It was very hard to get anything you wanted, very hard to leave the country,\" Lorig says. \"As soon as the Soviet Union was over, things went down. There was no government, no police; it was hell. I imagine that's what hell would look like.\"\n\nThe risk of crime and violence was such that Lorig would make sure to get home by sunset. Even so, she says she was robbed twice of a leather coat, once while on a train and another while walking home. The street robbery involved two thieves, one of whom held a rifle and the other who put a knife to her cheek.\n\n\"You don't want to die for a leather coat,\" she says. \"It was scary. Whenever I'm in Georgia and I pass that little corner, I always say, 'That's where I got robbed.' I don't wear leather coats anymore. I try to stay away from leather.\"\n\nThe conditions in Georgia meant that she practiced her archery techniques in her basement by candlelight when there was no electricity -- which was often. \"I knew it was dark and there was no future for me there,\" she says.\n\nLife would improve for Georgians in ensuing years, but it didn't matter to Lorig. After going to the United States for the Atlanta Games, she was determined to become an American.\n\n2000 Sydney\n\nAfter the 1996 Olympics, Lorig stayed in the United States, moving to New Jersey and working to gain U.S. citizenship. The process was so slow that, four years later, she still was competing for Georgia during the 2000 Olympics. Georgian team officials did not allow her to march during the opening ceremonies because her competition began the next day.\n\n\"I was disappointed,\" she says. \"To me, that's how you enter the Olympics. Archery is the first competition, but still it should be my choice, not theirs. But they didn't give you a choice. They didn't respect me much; they didn't respect my goal, my freedom.\"\n\nLorig, who says she was out of shape and had low expectations due to poor support, finished 46th in Sydney, but she took something out of those Olympics.\n\n\"I loved this sport more after Australia,\" she says. \"I kind of grew up a little bit and realized how lucky I was to be in the Olympics and have a bronze medal and be an Olympian, and then seeing what my sport was about. The system changed. Before, it was different in Barcelona. Then it changed and it became all about who was mentally strong. So it wasn't that easy for me to win, between raising my kid, my marriages failing and all the citizenship issues.\n\n\"But if you believe in yourself, which I do, I know I will win that gold medal one way or another.\"\n\n2008 Beijing\n\nLorig did not walk in the opening ceremonies of the 2004 Athens Olympics, either. She was in New Jersey, still waiting for U.S. citizenship, raising her son, divorced for some of the years from her second husband from whom she had taken the name Lorig in 1996, and scraping by while working a variety of jobs, including at a toy store.\n\nEventually, Lorig re-married Onashvili and also received U.S. citizenship. She swore to herself, \"I'm going to be No. 1 in this country. I'm going to go [to the Olympics]. I'm going to do it.\"\n\nShe did, representing her new country in 2008.\n\nBut just as the Games were starting, Russia and her native Georgia went to war. After the opening ceremonies, Lorig turned on the TV and saw channel after channel showing either the Georgian or Russian president. Her teammates asked what was going on in Georgia and Lorig said she had no idea.\n\n\"The next day I found out they were bombing the village next to my mom's,\" she says. \"I found out 10 minutes before [my competition].\"\n\nLorig called home to her parents in Georgia. Her mother assured Lorig that she and her father were safe and there was nothing to worry about. She was lying, however, so that her daughter would concentrate on her competition rather than worry about their safety. It was only later that Lorig learned her parents were forced to flee due to bombings and that a shell struck the nearby house of relatives and landed on a couch but fortunately did not explode.\n\nFocused on the competition, Lorig finished fifth, her then-best individual Olympic performance, but still short of a medal. She earned something much more meaningful to her, however: U.S. teammates selected her to carry the American flag in the closing ceremonies. She was so astonished at the news that she held on to her teammates to keep from falling.\n\n\"I realized how fortunate and lucky I was to be selected by the U.S. team,\" she says. \"And they respected that I came from the country that had not much freedom and no happiness and where you can't follow your dreams. And you are here. You can carry the flag of the nation. It was confirmation that it is the best country. ...\n\n\"It was very hot and it was heavy -- it's a big flag,\" she said. \"But it was one of the highlights of my life. I always say, if I had a choice between an Olympic gold medal and holding the flag, I will choose the flag. The medal I can always go and try to get again, but this is only once in a lifetime.\"\n\n2012 London\n\nIn her match against the eventual bronze medalist, Lorig fired a perfect bull's-eye that destroyed a camera that was set inside the center of the target. She wonders if being told of the camera's $100,000 value -- \"Who puts a camera there?\" -- distracted her just enough that she lost the round and finished fourth.\n\nThat same year, the blockbuster movie \"The Hunger Games\" was released, and Lorig personally trained the film's star, Jennifer Lawrence (who played Katniss Everdeen), how to shoot an arrow. Due to that book and movie series, archery's popularity has grown a bit, especially among the younger generation.\n\n\"'The Hunger Games' helped archery a lot,\" Lorig said. \"I am very happy with opportunities like that to help transport my sport. I love my sport. I want everyone to see how great and unique our sport is.\"\n\nRaising archery's popularity definitely would be a boost for Lorig, who helps support herself and her parents in Georgia by coaching whenever she can while in Chula Vista or her home in West Hollywood. \"Whatever we get [as archers] is just barely enough, so I coach.\"\n\nThe next step\n\nThe composition of the U.S. Olympic archery team is decided over the course of three trials, with the third and final trial this weekend. Despite winning the Pan Am Games last summer and her impressive Olympic résumé, Lorig had a disappointing first two trials and currently is fifth on the leaderboard, which is topped by Mackenzie Brown.\n\nInterestingly, the two have been roommates during training at the Chula Vista training center. The 21-year-old Brown says Lorig is \"quirky,\" but that the two have much in common, and will often knit and crochet together.\n\nOnly one U.S. woman will qualify for Rio at the upcoming trial, but the Americans can qualify two more archers at a tournament in Turkey next month. Even if they do, the only three women who can advance would be the top three finishers at the U.S. trials.\n\nSo reaching Rio will be a challenge for Lorig, but considering what she has overcome in her life, it is definitely a target she can hit. \"I am so ready for the next one,\" she says. \"Bring it on.\"\n\nAnd perhaps another Olympics is possible, as well. Lorig isn't too old to continue beyond 2016. U.S. archer Butch Johnson, after all, competed at the 2008 Olympics when he was almost 53 before retiring due to issues with his vision. He says Lorig is a determined person who goes after what she wants and achieves those goals. And Lorig says she will keep competing as long as she keeps shooting bull's-eyes."
