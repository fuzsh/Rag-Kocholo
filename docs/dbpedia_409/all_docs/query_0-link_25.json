        "text": "Archery competition will begin with the Ranking Round on Saturday, August 9 at the Beijing Olympic Green Archery Field next to the Olympic Village and just a short shuttle ride from the Main Press Center.\n\nThe women compete at noon, followed by the men at 3:30 p.m.\n\nRegular competition for archery begins at the same venue on Sunday, August 10 and runs through Friday, August 15. The U.S. men will be competing in both the individual and team events, while the women will just be competing in the individual events.\n\nEvent Schedule:\n\nSat, August 9: Ranking Round\n\nSun, August 10: Women's Team (U.S. team not competing)\n\nMon, August 11: Men's Team\n\nTue, August 12: Women's Individual Elimination Round (1/32 and 1/16)\n\nWed, August 13: Men's Individual Elimination Round (1/32 and 1/16)\n\nThurs, August 14: Women's Individual (Quarters, Semis, Bronze Medal and Gold Medal Matches)\n\nFri, August 15: Men's Individual (Quarters, Semis, Bronze Medal and Gold Medal Matches)\n\nThe 2008 U.S. Olympic Men's Archery team looks to be successful once again as five-time Olympian Butch Johnson (Woodstock, Conn.) and three-time Vic Wunderle ( Mason City , Ill. ) provide the leadership, with first-time Olympian Brady Ellison ( Glendale, Ariz. / Chula Vista , Calif. ) set to build on his U.S. Olympic Team Trials gold medal.\n\nJohnson is a multiple national champion and two-time Olympic medalist, including winning Team Gold in 1996. He was the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials silver medalist. Wunderle is competing in his third-consecutive Olympic Games after winning a silver medal (individual) and bronze (team) in Sydney in 2000. He was the bronze medalist at the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials. Ellison is the youngster on this year's team at 19 years old and is competing in his first Olympic Games, but he is already a multiple national champion. He is coming off of his career best performance with a silver medal at World Cup #3 in Anatalya, Turkey.\n\nThe U.S. Men just missed out on a medal in 2004 after finishing fourth in the team event. Prior Olympic Games success for the U.S. Men include medaling at every single Games except for Barcelona in 1992 since archery was re-instated as an Olympic Sport in 1972. The U.S. Team has captured a total of 13 medals since 1972 and currently holds the 2x27 finals total Olympic record of 502, set by Huish, Johnson and White at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. Once again Korea will be the top threat in Beijing, but the U.S. is a major contender for returning to the medal stand.\n\nOn the women's side, 2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials gold medalist Jennifer Nichols ( Cheyenne, Wyo. ) returns to the Olympic Games after competing in Athens in 2004. Nichols won gold (individual) and bronze (team) at the 2007 Pan American Games and is looking to improve on her ninth place finish in Athens. She will be joined by an Olympic veteran but first timer for the U.S. squad. Khatuna Lorig ( West Hollywood , Calif. / Chula Vista , Calif. ) is competing on her fourth Olympic Games team, but her first with the United States. She has competed in the past for Georgia (2000, 1996) and the Unified Soviet Team (1992). She won a bronze medal in the team event in 1992. She was the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials silver medalist.\n\nWith Korea also being the top threat to the women's team, the U.S. is looking toward Beijing to bring home the first women's Olympic medal since 1988.\n\nMore details on the event can be found here: http://results.beijing2008.cn/WRM/ENG/Schedule/AR_2008-08-09.shtml"
