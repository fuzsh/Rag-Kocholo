        "text": "If you didn't get to experience \"Twisters\" in the viral, highly immersive format 4DX, you'll have another chance soon.\n\nRegal theaters will rerelease \"Twisters\" as well as the first 1996 installment \"Twister\" in 4DX for one week, starting Aug. 30. Tickets will be available to purchase starting today, Aug. 1.\n\n“During opening week of 'Twisters,' most 4DX showtimes for the movie quickly sold out at Regal locations offering that premium format” said James Lamar, Head of Film at Regal in a press release. “Despite the packed summer movie calendar, we found an opportunity to schedule seven more days of 'Twisters 'in 4DX and introduce a new way to enjoy the original film.”\n\nAdvance tickets for showtimes at 4DX locations will be available for purchase at theatre box offices and kiosks, on the Regal mobile app, or through REGmovies.com.\n\n4DX movie theaters showing 'Twisters' in Oklahoma\n\nIn the Oklahoma City area, Regal Warren in Moore offers 4DX and will participate in showing \"Twisters\" and \"Twister\" the week of Aug. 30.\n\nWhat is 'Twisters' about?\n\nOklahoma-made \"Twisters\" is billed as a current-day chapter of the 1996 blockbuster \"Twister,\" which also was filmed in Oklahoma, and stars Golden Globe nominees Daisy Edgar-Jones and Glen Powell as opposing forces who come together to try to predict — and possibly tame — the immense power of tornadoes. It's directed by Lee Isaac Chung, who filmed his Academy Award-winning semi-autobiographical immigrant drama \"Minari\" in the Tulsa area in 2019."
