        "text": "The 2024 Paris Olympics roll on and we've seen some marquee moments already, from the spectacular Opening Ceremony punctuated by the first live performance from Celine Dion in more than four years, to the U.S. women's gymnastics team taking the team gold.\n\nBoasting a galaxy of stars, including Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, LeBron James, Sha’Carri Richardson, Noah Lyles, and so many more, Team USA is poised for success in the City of Light.\n\nRELATED: Where To Watch 2024 Paris Olympics: Complete Schedule\n\nHere's a list of the U.S. Olympic medalists in Paris:\n\nMelissa Jefferson, Twanisha Terry, Gabby Thomas, Sha’Carri Richardson\n\nTrack & Field, Women’s 4x100 Relay\n\nGold\n\nSha’Carri Richardson will return home from Paris with a gold medal after all. The American sprinter was favored to win the women’s 100m, but she placed second in that race behind Saint Lucia’s Julien Alfred. But in the women’s 4x100m relay, she ran the anchor leg that gave the American’s gold, joining teammates Melissa Jefferson, Twanisha Terry, and Gabby Thomas atop the podium. Richardson had plenty of work to do, as the U.S. was in third position entering the final leg. But Richardson blew past Great Britain’s Daryll Neita (silver) and German’s Rebekka Haase (bronze) to seal victory for Team USA.\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone\n\nTrack & Field, Women’s 400m Hurdles\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Patrick Khachfe/Getty Images\n\nIt simply couldn’t have gone better for Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone. The American track star not only successfully defended her gold medal in the women’s 400m hurdle, she annihilated the world record in the process (beating her own). Here’s an eye-popping stat, as noted by Yahoo Sports’ Jeff Eisenberg: McLaughlin-Levrone’s blazingly fast time of 50.37 seconds was better than 16 of the 24 women running in the 400m open semifinals – a race where you don’t have to also, you know, jump over things. Fellow American Anna Cockrell took silver and defending world champion Femke Bol of the Netherlands took bronze.\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall\n\nTrack & Field, Women’s Long Jump\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Sam Barnes/Sportsfile\n\nWhen she first competed at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (which were held in 2021), Tara Davis-Woodhall placed sixth in the women’s long jump. What a difference three years makes. Davis-Woodhall, 25, is now an Olympic champion, winning gold in Paris with a 7.10-meter jump, easily defeating the field to seal the top podium spot. After her win, she ran to her husband, Paralympian Hunter Woodhall and shared an emotional embrace. Germany’s Malaika Mihambo won silver and fellow American Jasmine Moore took bronze.\n\nOlivia Reeves\n\nWeightlifting, Women's 71kg/156lbs\n\nGold\n\nOlivia Reeves won the United States’ first gold medal in weightlifting in 24 years. The 21-year-old from Tennessee stood apart from the field in the women’s 71kg/156lbs division, lifting a total of 262kg (or roughly 578 pounds) which was five kilograms better than silver medalist Mari Leivis Sanchez of Colombia. Ecuador’s Angie Paola Palacios Dajomes took bronze.\n\nRai Benjamin\n\nTrack & Field, Men’s 400m Hurdles\n\nGold\n\nRai Benjamin came oh-so-close to Olympic gold at the 2020 Tokyo Games, finishing with silver in the men’s 400m hurdles. In Paris, he got the gold he came for. The 27-year-old Mount Vernon, NY native beat Norway’s Karsten Warholm (who bested him in Tokyo and won silver in Paris) and Brazil’s Alison dos Santos (bronze).\n\nGrant Holloway\n\nTrack & Field, Men’s 110m Hurdles\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Sam Barnes/Sportsfile\n\nGrant Holloway has his Olympic gold medal. The three-time world champion in the 110m hurdles won silver in this event at the 2020 Tokyo Games, but he was on top of his sport in Paris, winning with a time of 12.99 seconds. Fellow American Daniel Roberts won silver and Jamaica’s Rasheed Broadbell took bronze.\n\nGabby Thomas\n\nTrack & Field, Women’s 200m\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Michael Steele/Getty Images\n\nThe women’s 200m was billed as a showdown between American Gabby Thomas and Saint Lucia’s Julian Alfred, who won gold in the 100m. But on the day, it was Thomas and no one else. The 27-year-old Atlanta native cruised to the gold medal with a time of 21.83 seconds, comfortably ahead of Alfred’s 22.08 seconds. Thomas’ U.S. teammate Brittany Brown took bronze. For Thomas, it was her third Olympic medal and first gold. She won silver in the 4x100 relay and bronze in the women’s 200m at the 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\nNoah Lyles\n\nTrack & Field, Men’s 100m\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images\n\nEntering the men's 100m in Paris, Noah Lyles' main competition for gold appeared to be Kishane Thompson from Jamaica. The showdown didn't disappoint, with Thompson getting off to a great start in the race, but Lyles finishing strong to take home the gold. In the race's immediate aftermath, it wasn't clear who won, so officials had to consult the high-speed camera shots. Lyles just barely edged out Thompson, with fellow American Fred Kerley finishing in third. An overjoyed Lyles ripped off his name tag, thrusting it up in the air as he ran victoriously around the track before finding his family and sharing an emotional moment with them.\n\nSimone Biles\n\nGymnastics, Women’s All-Around Final\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nSimone Biles’ Paris Olympics experience could hardly be better after she clinched gold in the women’s gymnastics all-around final, two day after celebrating the team goal with her American compatriots. For Biles, it was her sixth gold medal, the most by any American gymnast in history (man or woman). Her victory also marked the sixth straight Olympic women’s all-around won by Team USA. Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade earned silver and Biles’ fellow American Suni Lee won bronze.\n\nSimone Biles\n\nGymnastics, Women's Vault\n\nGold\n\nSimone Biles' 2024 Paris Olympics just keep getting better. The U.S. gymnastics G.O.A.T. added another gold medal to her collection, soaring to victory in the women's vault. That follows her team gold, and individual all-around gold, giving her seven career Olympic golds and 10 medals overall. Brazil's Rebeca Andrade took silver and U.S. teammate Jade Carey took bronze.\n\nKatie Ledecky\n\nSwimming, Women’s 800m Freestyle\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Quinn Rooney/Getty Images\n\nKatie Ledecky just can’t stop making history. The greatest female swimmer of all time won gold in the women’s 800m freestyle, marking the fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal in that event. She’s the only woman swimmer in Olympic history who’s won the same event in four straight Games. This gold was Ledecky’s fourth medal of this Olympics and 14th in her career (nine gold). Australia’s Ariarne Titmus finished with the silver and Ledecky’s U.S. teammate Paige Madden grabbed the bronze.\n\nKatie Ledecky\n\nSwimming, Women’s 1500m Freestyle\n\nGold\n\nKatie Ledecky didn’t need another medal to be an all-time swimming legend, but she simply dominated the competition the the women’s 1500m freestyle to claim her eighth Olympic gold and 12th Olympic medal overall, joining Natalie Coughlin and Jenny Thompson as the only other U.S. women to have a dozen medals at the Olympics. Ledecky, who earned a bronze in the women’s 400m freestyle, was untouchable in the 1500m, winning by a mammoth margin of more than 10 full seconds. Her time of 15:30.02 represents a new Olympic record.\n\nSarah Hildebrandt\n\nWrestling, Women’s 50kg/149lbs\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: John Walton/PA Images via Getty Images\n\nSarah Hildebrandt was slated to wrestle India’s Vinesh Phogat in the gold medal final of the women’s 50kg/149 lbs division, but Phogat couldn’t make weight (she came in 100 kg over the limit) and was disqualified, despite trying a range of measures, including cutting her hair off. As a result, Hildebrandt was paired against Cuba’s Yusneylis Guzman. If Hildebrandt was at all thrown off by the late change, she didn’t show it, dispatching Guzman 3-0 to win Team USA’s second wrestling gold.\n\nQuincy Hall\n\nTrack & Field, Men’s 400m\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Sam Barnes/Sportsfile via Getty Images\n\nThe Paris Games are Quincy Hall’s first Olympics and he certainly rose to the occasion, winning gold in the men’s 400-meter. The 26-year-old Missouri native narrowly edged out Great Britain’s Matthew Hudson-Smith (silver), by a margin of just 0.04 seconds. Zambia’s Muzala Samukonga finished with bronze.\n\nJennifer Valente, Lilly Williams, Chloe Dygart, Kristen Faulkner\n\nCycling, Women’s Team Pursuit\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Jared C.

The squad of Jennifer Valente, Lilly Williams, Chloe Dygart, and Kristen Faulkner beat out New Zealand (silver) and Great Britain (bronze.) It’s the fifth cycling medal for the United States, and second gold. Faulkner previously won gold in the women’s road race, and Chloe Dygart took bronze in the women’s time trial.\n\nCole Hocker\n\nTrack & Field, Men’s 1500m\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Christian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nFor much of the men’s 1500-meter, American Cole Hocker was just trying to hang around. He did that, and when he got to within 200 meters of the finish line, he found another gear, passing five competitors as he stunningly seized the gold medal. Hocker’s time was a full three seconds better than his previous best, and he overtook reigning world champion Josh Kerr of Great Britain and reigning Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway, both of whom were favored heading into the race. Kerr got the silver medal, and fellow American Yared Nuguse took bronze.\n\nAmit Elor\n\nWrestling, Women's Freestyle 68kg/149 lbs\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Sarah Stier/Getty Images\n\nAmit Elor isn’t messing around. The 20-year-old wrestling phenom has won an astonishing 41 consecutive international matches. The most recent came with an Olympic gold medal. Elor dominated her final showdown in the 68-kilogram weight class, this one against Kyrgyzstan’s Meerim Zhumanazarova. It was a 3-0 victory, making Elor the youngest U.S. wrestler to win gold and just the third woman in the history of the country.\n\nCaroline Marks\n\nSurfing, Women’s\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Sylvain Lefevre/Getty Images\n\nCaroline Marks edged out Brazil’s Tatiana Weston-Webb to win gold in women’s surfing. In an event delayed several days because of bad weather, Marks caught a barrel on her second wave to earn 7.50 points, the high score in the head-to-head round. In the waning minutes of the 35-minute round, Weston-Webb caught her fifth wave for a score of 4.50, bringing her to a total of 10.33 points. It was just barely below Marks’ score of 10.50. For Marks, 22, it is her first Olympic medal. She competed in the 2020 Tokyo Games, but finished outside a podium spot. And for the United States, it’s the second consecutive gold in the women’s event; Carissa Moore won the top prize in Tokyo, the first time surfing was an Olympic sport.\n\nValarie Allman\n\nTrack & Field, Women’s Discus\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images\n\nThe defending champion in women’s discus did it again in Paris. Valarie Allman won gold in the women’s discus at the 2020 Tokyo Games and was able to successfully defend her title in 2024, beating out Bin Feng of China (silver) and Sandra Elkasevic of Croatia (bronze). In the end, it wasn’t all that close, with Allman’s longest throw measuring at 69.50 meters, nearly two full meters better than the next closest.\n\nRegan Smith, Lilly King, Gretchen Walsh, Torri Huske\n\nSwimming, Women’s 4x100m Medley Relay\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Sebastien Bozon/AFP\n\nTeam USA finished its time in the pool in style, not only winning gold in the women’s 4x100m medley relay, but setting a world record in the process. This was the final pool swim of the 2024 Paris Olympics, and the United States finished with 28 medals overall, including eight golds, beating out rivals Australia on both counts (the Aussie swimmers had 18 medals overall, with seven gold).\n\nBobby Finke\n\nSwimming, Men's 1500m Freestyle\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Jari Pestelacci/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images\n\nBobby Finke, one of Katie Ledecky's regular training partners, did his best impression of her, winning the gold medal in the men's 1500m freestyle in dominant fashion, setting a world record in the process. He also kept alive a historic streak: since 1904, the U.S. men have won at least one individual swimming gold at the Olympics, and this was the last opportunity for the Americans to extend that streak in Paris. Italy's Gregorio Paltrinieri won silver and Ireland's Daniel Wiffen took bronze. Finke previously won silver in the men's 800m freestyle.\n\nScottie Scheffler\n\nGolf, Men’s\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Andrew Redington/Getty Images\n\nScottie Scheffler entered the Olympic men’s golf tournament the top-ranked player in the world and he proved why on Sunday. Entering the final round four strokes behind leaders Jon Rahm and Xander Schauffele, Scheffler shot a 9-under 62 to seize the gold. This is Scheffler’s seventh tournament win of the year, which notably includes his second career Master’s back in the spring. Great Britain’s Tommy Fleetwood won silver and Japan’s Hideki Matsuyama took bronze.\n\nKristen Faulkner\n\nCycling, Women’s Road Race\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Tim de Waele/Getty Images\n\nBack in 2017, a 24-year-old Kristen Faulkner began to seriously take up cycling, having gotten into the sport by riding in New York City’s Central Park. Seven years later, she shocked the cycling world, winning gold in the women’s road race – a feat no American woman had achieved in 40 years. With three kilometers to go, Faulkner let loose and separated herself from the lead pack and cruised to victory in stunning style. Netherlands’ Marianne Vos won silver and Belgium’s Lotte Kopecky got bronze\n\nRyan Murphy, Nic Fink, Gretchen Walsh, Torri Huske\n\nSwimming, Mixed 4x100 Medley Relay\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images\n\nTeam USA won gold in the mixed 4x100m medley relay, beating out China (silver) and Australia (bronze). In doing so, the foursome of Ryan Murphy, Nic Fink, Gretchen Walsh, and Torri Huske set a world record and continued U.S. swimming’s strong 2024 Paris Games; this was the 25th medal for American swimmers at these Olympics.\n\nRyan Crouser\n\nTrack & Field, Men’s Shot Put\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Michael Steele/Getty Images\n\nThey call Ryan Crouser the Michael Jordan of shot put and he didn’t disappoint at the 2024 Paris Olympics, throwing his way to his third consecutive Olympic gold medal in the event. The 31-year-old Oregon native first tasted Olympic gold at the 2016 Rio Games and no one has been able to touch him since. He’s also a three-time world champion in the event.\n\nKate Douglass\n\nSwimming, Women’s 200m Breaststroke\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Maddie Meyer/Getty Images\n\nKate Douglass edged out defending champion Tatjana Smith from South Africa to take gold in the women’s 200m breaststroke.

Led by Lee Kiefer and Lauren Scruggs, the squad withstood a late rally by the Italian, letting an eight-point lead shrink to just three before Scruggs won three consecutive points to clinch a 45-39 win. This gold is Kiefer’s third in her career, and second at the Paris Olympics. She’s the first American fencer to win three golds.\n\nNicholas Mead, Justin Best, Michael Grady, Liam Corrigan\n\nRowing, Men’s Four\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Alex Davidson/Getty Images\n\nThe United States had gone 64 years since their last gold medal in men’s four rowing, but the quartet of Nicolas Mead, Justin Best, Michael Grady and Liam Corrigan changed all that in Paris.

The squad of Simone Biles, Suni Lee, Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey, and Hezly Rivera cruised to victory in the team gold, posting a huge margin in overall points (nearly six points over silver medal-winning Italy.) The U.S. had to settle for second place in the team competition at the 2020 Tokyo Games and were on a mission to reclaim the team gold, which they’ve managed to win four times now (1996 Atlanta, 2012 London, 2016 Rio).\n\nTorri Huske\n\nSwimming, Women's 100m Butterfly\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Sarah Stier/Getty Images\n\nTorri Huske and U.S. teammate Gretchen Walsh were the two fastest swimmers in the 100m semifinal (Walsh topped all swimmers), beautifully setting up the Americans for success in the final race. In that final, Huske narrowly edged out Walsh, the world record holder, to take the gold, winning by a razor-thin margin of 0.04 seconds. Notably, Huske, 21, competed in the 100m butterfly final at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, finishing 0.01 second behind the bronze medal winner. Now she's got a gold medal in the same event, adding to the silver she won in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay, which she shared with teammate Walsh.\n\nLee Kiefer\n\nFencing, Women's Individual Foil\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Al Bello/Getty Images\n\nLee Kiefer successfully defended her gold medal in the women's individual foil, defeating fellow American Lauren Scruggs in the final, Sunday, July 29, 2024. Kiefer, a 30-year-old medical student, is competing in her fourth Olympics and won gold in the same event at the 2020 Tokyo Games. Lee triumphed over Scruggs 15-6 in the final.

Jack Alexey started the race, handing off to Chris Guiliano, who surged out front and the U.S. never looked back. Hunter Armstrong's astonishingly quick third leg - he clocked in at a team best 46.75 seconds - all but clinched first place. Tokyo Olympics hero Caeleb Dressel closed out the win, ending more than a second better than Australia (silver) and China (bronze.)\n\nVincent Hancock\n\nShooting, Men’s Skeet\n\nGold\n\nPhoto: Charles McQuillan/Getty Images\n\nVincent Hancock took home his fourth individual Olympic gold medal in men’s skeet shooting.

Team USA’s Spencer Lee fell to Japan’s Rei Higuchi in the final, but walked away with a silver medal. Not a bad consolation prize. The 25-year-old from Pennsylvania is competing in his first Olympics.\n\nAnna Cockrell\n\nTrack & Field, Women’s 400m Hurdles\n\nSilver\n\nAnna Cockrell hurdled her way to the podium in her second Olympics, winning silver in the women’s 400m hurdles behind fellow American Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, who took gold. Cockrell made the finals of the 400m hurdles at the 2020 Tokyo Games, but was disqualified after officials determined she was guilty of a lane violation. There were no such problems in Paris, as the U.S. finished 1-2 in the event. Femke Bol of the Netherlands took bronze.\n\nDaniel Roberts\n\nTrack & Field, Men’s 110m Hurdles\n\nSilver\n\nDaniel Roberts ensured it was another 1-2 finish in hurdles for the United States, winning silver in the men’s 100m hurdles. Roberts, a 26-year-old first-time Olympian, finished 0.1 seconds behind Team USA compatriot Grant Holloway and less than 0.003 seconds in front of Jamaica’s Rasheed Broadbell. American’s Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone (gold) and Anna Cockrell (silver) also finished 1-2 in the women’s 400m hurdles.\n\nKenny Bednarek\n\nTrack & Field, Men’s 200m\n\nSilver\n\nKenny Bednarek, a.k.a. “Kung Fu Kenny” because of the headband he wears while competing, took silver in the men’s 200m. Prior to the race, all eyes were on Bednarek’s teammate Noah Lyles, hoping to pull off a double gold in the men’s 100m and 200m, but he was diagnosed with Covid-19 earlier in the week and, while he still raced, was noticeably off his game, finishing with the bronze medal. Bednarek was leading in the final 100 meters or so, but was overtaken by eventual gold medalist Letsile Tebogo of Botswana. Bednarek, 25, also won silver in the 200m at the 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\nKenneth Rooks\n\nTrack & Field, Men’s 3000m Steeplechase\n\nSilver\n\nPhoto: Michael Kappeler/dpa\n\nMidway through the men’s steeplechase, Kenneth Rooks was in the back half of the pack. Then he turned on the afterburners and by the final lap, he was stunningly leading the race. Rooks, a first-time Olympian, finished with a time of 8:06.41, a personal best, to claim the silver medal. Morocco’s Soufiane El Bakkali won gold and Kenya’s Abraham Kibiwott took bronze.\n\nKatie Moon\n\nTrack & Field, Women’s Pole Vault\n\nSilver\n\nPhoto: Tim Clayton/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nKatie Moon won silver in the women’s pole vault, her second career Olympics medal in the event.

The U.S. artistic swimming team took silver in the team competition, with one highlight being their synchronized moonwalk to Michael Jackson’s “Smooth Criminal” while upside down and underwater. China’s team won gold and Spain went home with bronze.\n\nAnnette Echikunwoke\n\nTrack & Field, Women’s Hammer\n\nSilver\n\nPhoto: Al Bello/Getty Images\n\nHeading into the 2020 Tokyo Games, Nigerian-American track & field athlete Annette Echikunwoke was all set to represent Nigeria. But the Nigerian Federation apparently failed to effectively coordinate with her on drug testing requirements ahead of the Games and she was disqualified. Following that organizational snafu, she decided to represent the U.S. At the 2024 Paris Olympics, the 28-year-old from Ohio added another medal into Team USA’s collection, taking silver in the women’s hammer throw.\n\nSam Kendricks\n\nTrack & Field, Men’s Pole Vault\n\nSilver\n\nPhoto: Patrick Smith/Getty Images\n\nAt the 2020 Tokyo Games, Sam Kendricks couldn’t compete because of a positive Covid-19 test.

Kendricks, 31, previously earned a bronze in the same event in the 2016 Rio Games.\n\nSimone Biles\n\nGymnastics, Women’s Floor Exercise\n\nSilver\n\nIn her final competitive appearance at the 2024 Paris Olympics (and who knows, maybe at the Olympics ever) Simone Biles took silver in the women’s floor exercise, very narrowly being edged out by Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade. This caps a hugely successful Paris Games for Biles, the U.S. gymnastics G.O.A.T.: she won gold medals in women’s team, individual all-around, and vault.\n\nSeth Rider, Taylor Spivey, Morgan Pearson, Taylor Knibb\n\nTriathlon, Mixed Team Relay\n\nSilver\n\nPhoto: Rene Nijhuis/BSR Agency/Getty Images\n\nThe United States pulled out a surprise silver medal win in the mixed team triathlon relay.

In the end, it was Team USA sporting silver.\n\nAusten Smith, Vincent Hancock\n\nShooting, Mixed Team Skeet\n\nSilver\n\nWhen Austen Smith is competing individually, she can lean on her coach, Team USA shooter Vinicent Hancock.

Richardson’s Team USA compatriot Melissa Jefferson took the bronze.\n\nBrady Ellison\n\nArchery, Men’s Individual\n\nSilver\n\nBrady Ellison and South Korea’s Woojin Kim engineered an epic final match, trading 10s in the final round to set up a sudden death tiebreak – one arrow each to determine gold. In the end, Kim, the top seed entering the tournament, emerged victorious, but Ellison could still bask in not only the silver, but for his role in a thrilling climax to the men’s individual archery event.\n\nVernon Norwood, Shamier Little, Bryce Deadmon, Kaylyn Brown\n\nTrack & Field, Mixed 4x400m Relay\n\nSilver\n\nPhoto: Christian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nTeam USA’s mixed 4x400m relay team set a world record in the semifinals, but weren’t able to replicate that feat in the finals, finishing behind Netherlands for a silver medal.

That makes her the most decorated U.S. female Olympian ever.\n\nTorri Huske\n\nSwimming, Women’s 100m Freestyle\n\nSilver\n\nTorri Huske's impressive Olympics continues. After winning gold in the women's 100m butterfly, the 21-year-old added a silver medal in the women's 100m freestyle.

Making it even more intense was the fact that they were only 0.02 seconds behind gold medal winner Nicolo Martinenghi of Italy. For Fink, a 31-year-old two-time Olympian who works an engineering job, this is the first Olympic medal.\n\nLauren Scruggs\n\nFencing, Women's Individual Foil\n\nSilver\n\nLauren Scruggs, a 21-year-old Harvard student, made an improbable run into the women's individual foil final before losing to fellow American and defending Olympic champion Lee Kiefer. It was a remarkable run for Scruggs, who wasn't widely seen as a medal contender, but managed to fight her way through the field before facing off against Kiefer.\n\nKate Douglass, Gretchen Walsh, Torri Huske, Simone Manuel\n\nSwimming, Women's 4x100m Freestyle Relay\n\nSilver\n\nThe women's swim team also saw success, seizing silver in the 4x100m freestyle relay. Kate Douglass, Gretchen Walsh, Torri Huske, and Simone Manuel battled it out with Australia and China, falling behind the rival Aussies, but eking out the second-place finish over the Chinese.\n\nSarah Bacon and Kassidy Cook\n\nDiving, Women’s 3m Synchro Springboard\n\nSilver\n\nPhoto: Sarah Stier/Getty Images\n\nBacon and Cook narrowly missed out on qualifying for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and, at the time, Bacon considered retiring from competitive diving, according to USA Today. But she kept at it and her persistence paid off in Paris. The pair finished in second behind gold medal winners Chang Yani and Chen Yiwen of China, and in front of bronze medal winners Yasmin Harper and Scarlett Mew Jensen of Great Britain.\n\nHaley Batten\n\nCycling, Women's Mountain Bike\n\nSilver\n\nHaley Batten made history, Sunday, July 28, achieving the highest finish in U.S. history in Olympic mountain biking, taking silver in the women's event. Batten, a 25-year-old Utah native, is competing in her first-ever Olympics.\n\nHelen Maroulis\n\nWrestling, Women's Freestyle 57kg/125lbs\n\nBronze\n\nHelen Maroulis made history, becoming the first American woman to win three Olympic medals in wrestling. Maroulis, 32, won bronze over Canada’s Hannah Ray Taylor, won her first medal, a gold, at the 2016 Rio Games. She won bronze at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nKristina Teachout\n\nTaekwondo, Women’s 67kg/148lbs\n\nBronze\n\nKristina Teachout may just be a teen, but she’s got an Olympic medal to her name. The 18-year-old won bronze in women’s taekwondo in the 67kg/148lbs division, defeating China’s Jie Song in her final match.\n\nAaron Brooks\n\nWrestling, Men’s Freestyle 86kg/189lbs\n\nBronze\n\nAaron Brooks lost a heartbreaker in the semifinal, but that just provided him with extra motivation in the bronze medal match, which saw him easily dispatch Uzbekistan’s Javrail Shapiev 5-0 to ensure a spot on the podium. The 24-year-old Brooks was a four-time NCAA champion with Penn State.\n\nNoah Lyles\n\nTrack & Field, Men’s 200m\n\nBronze\n\nNoah Lyles was hoping to pull off a double gold in the men’s 100m and 200m, but had to settle for bronze in the latter after being diagnosed with Covid-19 two days before the race. Lyles came into the 200m favored for gold; it’s his signature race. But he appeared well off his game during the race, finishing behind Letsile Tebogo of Botswana (gold) and Team USA compatriot Kenny Bednarek (silver). Following the race, Lyles received medical treatment and left the track in a wheelchair.\n\nSam Watson\n\nSport Climbing, Men’s Speed\n\nBronze\n\nIn a headscratching bit of irony, Sam Watson twice set a world record in speed climbing in Paris, but will depart the City of Light with only a bronze medal. Watson first broke the world record during a preliminary elimination round, notching a time of 4.75 seconds (he owned the previous record of 4.79 seconds as well). But in the semifinal matchup against China’s Wu Peng, Watson shockingly lost. Peng went on to win silver, and Indonesia’s Leonardo Veddriq took gold. In the bronze medal round, Watson again set the world record, posting a time of 4.74 seconds, giving him another record, but no gold.\n\nBrittany Brown\n\nTrack & Field, Women’s 200m\n\nBronze\n\nPhoto: Sam Barnes/Sportsfile\n\nBrittany Brown won bronze in the women’s 200m, joining Team USA compatriot Gabby Thomas (gold) on the podium in Paris. The 29-year-old Brown is competing in her first Olympics, and the bronze is her first Olympic medal.\n\nHampton Morris\n\nWeightlifting, Men’s 61kg/134 lbs\n\nBronze\n\nThe United States had been dealing with a pretty serious drought when it comes to men’s weightlifting, but Hampton Morris provided some much needed relief. Morris won bronze in the 61kg/134 lbs division, giving Team USA its first medal in men’s weightlifting in 40 years. Morris lifted 278 pounds in the snatch, then followed it up with 379 pounds in the clean and jerk, which matched an Olympic record. China’s Li Fabin won gold and Thailand’s Theerapong Silachai.\n\nOmari Jones\n\nBoxing, Men’s 71kg/156 lbs\n\nBronze\n\nPhoto: Michael Reaves/Getty Images\n\nOmari Jones lost a tight split decision against Uzbekistan’s Asadkhuja Muydinkhujaev in the semifinals of the Men’s 71kg/156 lbs division, but walked away with a nifty consolation prize: an Olympic medal. Jones’ bronze is the first and only boxing medal for Team USA at the Paris Olympics.\n\nYared Nuguse\n\nTrack & Field, Men’s 1500m\n\nBronze\n\nIn a thrilling final 200 meters in the men’s 1500m, two Americans forced their way onto the podium. Team USA’s Cole Hocker surged late for the gold, and Yared Nuguse did likewise for bronze. On his way to the third-place finish, the 25-year-old Nuguse broke past reigning Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway. The bronze is Nuguse’s first Olympic medal.\n\nDearica Hamby, Cierra Burdick, Hailey van Lith, Rhyne Howard\n\nBasketball, Women’s 3x3\n\nBronze\n\nPhoto: Daniela Porcelli/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images\n\nTeam USA pulled out a bronze medal in women’s 3x3 basketball, defeating Canada 16-13 in the final matchup. That came following a heartbreaking 18-16 overtime loss against Spain in the semifinals. Spain went on to win silver and Germany took home gold. Team USA, made up of Dearica Hamby, Cierra Burdick, Hailey van Lith, Rhyne Howard, entered the tournament as defending champions, having won gold at the 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\nJordan Chiles\n\nGymnastics, Women’s Floor Exercise\n\nBronze\n\nPhoto: Naomi Baker/Getty Images\n\nJordan Chiles capped her Olympics run with a bronze in the women’s floor exercise, finishing behind Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade (gold) and U.S. teammate Simone Biles (silver.) This makes two medals for Chiles in Paris; she won gold in the women’s team event as well.\n\nFred Kerley\n\nTrack & Field, Men’s 100m\n\nBronze\n\nAt the end of the men’s 100m in Paris, all eyes were on the photo finish showing Team USA’s Noah Lyles barely edged out Jamaica’s Kishane Thompson. But Lyles U.S. teammate Fred Kerley wasn’t that far behind. In fact, he was just 0.02 seconds off the pace, but it was good enough for a bronze medal. For the 29-year-old two-time Olympian, it’s his second Olympic medal. He won silver in the men’s 100m at the 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\nAusten Smith\n\nShooting, Women’s Skeet\n\nBronze\n\nPhoto: Charles McQuillan/Getty Images\n\nAt the 2020 Tokyo Games, Austen Smith was the youngest member of the U.S. shooting team. At the 2024 Paris Games, she distinguished herself by winning bronze in women’s skeet shooting. Smith, 23, came in third behind Chile’s Francisca Crovetto Chadid (gold) and Great Britain’s Amber Rutter (silver).\n\nMelissa Jefferson\n\nTrack & Field, Women’s 100m\n\nBronze\n\nPhoto: Harry Langer/DeFodi Images via Getty Images\n\nAll eyes were on Sha’Carri Richardson entering the women’s 100m dash, but Melissa Jefferson wasn’t about to be a footnote in Olympic history, joining Richardson, who took silver, on the podium with a third-place finish. St. Lucia’s Julien Alfred won gold.\n\nPaige Madden\n\nSwimming, Women’s 800m Freestyle\n\nBronze\n\nPaige Madden took bronze in the women’s 800m freestyle, earning her second medal of the 2024 Paris Games (she also won silver in the women’s 4x200m freestyle relay). What looked like a battle for gold between Katie Ledecky and Australia’s Ariarne Titmus got an injection of further intrigue as Madden began closing on Titmus, raising the prospect of a 1-2 finish for Team USA in the event. In the end, Titmus held off Madden for the silver, while Ledecky earned gold.\n\nJasmine Moore\n\nTrack & Field, Women’s Triple Jump\n\nBronze\n\nPhoto: Michael Steele/Getty Images\n\nJasmine Moore, the 23-year-old Texas native competing in her first Olympics, had a memorable debut, taking bronze in the women’s triple jump. It’s the first-ever Olympic medal for an American woman in the event.\n\nJasmine Moore\n\nTrack & Field, Women’s Long Jump\n\nBronze\n\nJasmine Moore added to her collection of Olympic medals, winning bronze in the women’s long jump after previously winning bronze in the triple jump. Not bad for someone competing in her first Olympics. Moore, 23, finished behind fellow American Tara Davis-Woodhall (gold) and Germany’s Malaika Mihambo (silver).\n\nStephen Nedoroscik\n\nGymnastics, Men's Pommel Horse\n\nBronze\n\nPhoto: Jamie Squire/Getty Images\n\nOne of the defining moments of the 2024 Paris Olympics came during the men's gymnastics team final. As Team USA worked their way through the event's six rotations, a conspicuously bespectacled figure sat on the sidelines in a warmup suit. It was Stephen Nedoroscik, the U.S.'s pommel horse specialist who finally was called into action during the final rotation and clinched a bronze medal for his squad. Well, he was at it again in the individual pommel horse event, seizing bronze behind Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan (gold) and Kazakhstan's Nariman Kurbanov (silver).\n\nSuni Lee\n\nGymnastics, Women’s All-Around Final\n\nBronze\n\nPhoto: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nSuni Lee took home the bronze in the women’s gymnastics all-around, three years after winning gold in the event at the Tokyo Games. That accomplishment is nothing to take for granted. No defending women’s all-around champion made it back to the podium the following Olympics other than Nadia Comǎneci, who won gold in 1976, then followed it up with silver in 1980. Lee was on the bubble for a medal entering the final rotation, but nailed her floor routine to ensure she’d add a medal to the team gold she earned two days prior. Team USA teammate Simone Biles took gold and Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade took silver.\n\nSuni Lee\n\nGymnastics, Women’s Uneven Bars\n\nBronze\n\nSuni Lee added another medal to her collection, winning bronze in the women’s uneven bars. Lee, the all-around individual champion at the 2020 Tokyo Games, now has a gold medal in the team event, and a bronze in the all-around at the 2024 Paris Games.\n\nJade Carey\n\nGymnastics, Women's Vault\n\nBronze\n\nPhoto: Naomi Baker/Getty Images\n\nJade Carey won bronze in the women's vault, extending Team USA's dominant performance in women's gymnastics at the 2024 Paris Games. Her teammate, Simone Biles won gold. For Carey, the individual bronze follows a gold in the team competition. The 24-year-old Arizona native also won an individual gold at the 2020 Tokyo Games in floor exercise.\n\nTaylor Fritz, Tommy Paul\n\nTennis, Men’s Doubles\n\nBronze\n\nTaylor Fritz and Tommy Paul ensured the Olympics podium in men’s doubles would be packed with Americans, defeating Czechs Tomas Machac and Adam Pavlasek in straight sets (6-3, 6-4) to win the bronze medal. They join their Team USA compatriots Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram in medaling in the event. The latter took home silver.\n\nHenry Hollingsworth, Nicholas Rusher, Christian Tabash, Clark Dean, Christopher Carlson, Peter Chatain, Evan Olson, Pieter Quinton, Reilly Milne\n\nRowing, Men’s Eight\n\nBronze\n\nPhoto: Joe Scarnici/Getty Images for USOPC\n\nTeam USA took home the bronze in men’s eight rowing, finishing third behind Great Britain (gold) and Netherlands (silver.) The team of Henry Hollingsworth, Nicholas Rusher, Christian Tabash, Clark Dean, Christopher Carlson, Peter Chatain, Evan Olson, Pieter Quinton and Reilly Milne earned the United States’ first medal in this event since 2008. This bronze is also the 17th medal in this event in U.S. Olympic history, the most of any nation, according to NBCOlympics.\n\nGrant Fisher\n\nTrack & Field, Men's 10,000m\n\nBronze\n\nPhoto: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images\n\nFor as dominant as the U.S. has been historically in track and field events at the Olympics, distance running has been a tough nut to crack for the red, white, and blue. Since the men's 10,000m event was included in the Olympics, in 1912, the U.S. had only made it to the podium three times. Well, Grant Fisher made it four with a scintillating bronze medal finish in the 10,000m. Fisher ran a steady race, staying with the lead pack, but briefly stumbled with around nine laps to go. He quickly recovered and maintained the steady pace he'd been on until the final 600 meters, when the sprint for the finish line really began. Uganda's Joshua Cheptegei, the current world record holder in the event, cruised to a gold medal, while Fisher briefly surged into second place before Ethiopia's Berihu Aregawi, the defending Olympic champion, overtook him right at the finish line for the silver. For Fisher, a 27-year-old two-time Olympian, this was his first Olympic medal.\n\nCasey Kaufhold, Brady Ellison\n\nArchery, Mixed Team\n\nBronze\n\nPhoto: Alex Pantling/Getty Images\n\nCasey Kaufhold and Brady Ellison defeated India 6-2 to win bronze in mixed team archery. The duo narrowly fell (5-3) to Germany in the previous round, or else they’d have been facing off against South Korea for the gold. As it stood, the South Koreans outpaced the Germans to win the competition. The medal for Kaufhold, the top-ranked woman in the world, was the first for a female American archer since 1988. It will take some of the sting out of the stunning early defeat she suffered in the individual competition.\n\nIan Barrows, Hans Henken\n\nSailing, Men’s Skiff\n\nBronze\n\nIan Barrows and Hans Henken’s bronze medal in the men’s skiff is the first U.S. Olympic sailing medal since 2016. Spain won gold and New Zealand silver.\n\nEvy Leibfarth\n\nCanoeing, Women’s Canoe Slalom\n\nBronze\n\nEvy Leibfarth, a 20-year-old North Carolina native competing in her first Olympics, took bronze in the women’s canoe slalom.

It was the 23-year-old’s first medal in her first-ever Olympics.\n\nU.S. Women’s Rugby Team\n\nBronze\n\nPhoto: Arturo Holmes/Getty Images\n\nThe United States women defeated Australia 14-12 to take the bronze medal at in Rugby Sevens. The Americans had a chance to play for the gold medal, but lost to New Zealand. They recovered, however, to earn a place on the podium.\n\nFrederick Richard, Asher Hong, Paul Juda, Brody Malone, and Stephen Nedoroscik\n\nGymnastics, Men's Team\n\nBronze\n\nPhoto: Jamie Squire/Getty Images\n\nThe last time the U.S. men's gymnastics team took home a team medal at the Olympics as in 2008. Until this year in Paris. The team, consisting of Fred Richards, Asher Hong, Paul Juda, Brody Malone, and Stephen Nedoroscik, earned the bronze medal after a fierce day of competition, finishing behind Japan (gold) and China (silver). And in fact, it was the performance of Nedoroscik on pommel horse, his specialty event and the only apparatus he competed in on the day, that capped the Americans' day and clinched the medal.\n\nEmma Weyant\n\nWomen’s 400m Individual Medley\n\nBronze\n\nEmma Weyant clinched bronze in the women’s 400m individual medley, behind Canada’s Summer McIntosh (gold) and Team USA compatriot Katie Grimes. Weyant, 22, is competing in her second Olympics and took the silver medal in this same event at the 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\nRyan Murphy\n\nSwimming, Men’s 100m Backstroke\n\nBronze\n\nU.S. Olympic veteran Ryan Murphy took home the bronze in the men’s 100m backstroke. Murphy, 29, is competing in this third Olympics and is a decorated swimmer, having four gold medals to his name and now seven medals overall (one silver, two bronze).

The Nevada native earned the bronze in the men’s 200m freestyle\n\nNyjah Huston\n\nSkateboarding, Men's Street\n\nBronze\n\nPhoto: KIRILL KUDRYAVTSEV/AFP via Getty Images\n\nNyjah Huston joined his fellow American Jagger Eaton on the podium after the men's street event, earning a bronze medal for his performance. Perhaps disappointingly, Huston had been leading the event the entire way before being overtaken by Eaton and gold medalist Yuto Horigome from Japan.\n\nCarson Foster\n\nSwimming, Men's 400m Individual Medley\n\nBronze\n\nCarson Foster, a 22-year-old Ohio native, earned the bronze medal in the men's 400m individual medley, narrowly missing out on a silver, finishing behind Japan's Tomoyuki Matsushita by a mere 0.04 seconds. France's Leon Marchand brought home the gold.\n\nChloe Dygert\n\nCycling, Women's Time Trial\n\nBronze\n\nAmid rainy conditions, American cyclist Chloe Dygert took home bronze in the women's road cycling time trial, despite sustaining a fall during the race. Dygert's bronze is her second career Olympics medal; she took silver at the 2016 Rio Olympics in track cycling team pursuit.\n\nKatie Ledecky\n\nSwimming, Women's 400m Freestyle\n\nBronze\n\nPhoto: Gregory Shamus/Getty Images\n\nAmerican Olympic legend Katie Ledecky had the fastest time in the qualifying heats for the women's 400m freestyle, but was overtaken in the final by Australian Ariarne Titmus (gold) and Canadian Summer McIntosh (silver). Ledecky's bronze now gives her 11 career Olympic medals (7 gold, 3 silver, 1 bronze).\n\nNick Itkin\n\nFencing, Men's Individual Foil\n\nBronze\n\nNick Itkin earned the bronze medal in men's individual foil, adding to the team bronze he earned in men's foil at the 2020 Tokyo Games. Itkin, 24, is a two-time NCAA champion."
