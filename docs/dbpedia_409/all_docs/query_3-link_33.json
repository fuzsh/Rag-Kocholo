        "text": "STURBRIDGE — Nearly 700 bow and arrow enthusiasts and experts from northern Vermont to the south Bronx gathered over the weekend inside the Tantasqua Regional High School field house to compete in the East Region USA Archery Indoor National Championship and Junior Olympic Archery Development National Championship hosted by the State Archery Association of Massachusetts.\n\nBoth events are among 11 regional competitions held nationwide, with the action at Tantasqua recognized as the largest, according to SAAM founder and Tournament Director Richard Hart.\n\nResults from each of the 11 regional locations are compiled to determine the national champs for both events, which qualifies competitors for landing on a spot on the U.S. Archery Team.\n\nUSA Archery is the qualifying and governing body for the national Olympic and Paralympic teams, and this year's competitors at Tantasqua included a two-time Olympic medalist.\n\nRichard \"Butch\" Johnson, who got his first archery lessons at age 15 in Webster, was a member of the gold-medal U.S. Olympic team in 1996 at Atlanta, and the 2000 team that took bronze in Sydney, Australia.\n\nNow a resident of Woodstock, Mr. Johnson, 58, recounted the importance of his early training by John Jones at the former Hilltop Archery in Webster.\n\n\"You have to have someone showing you the basics, otherwise it is a much harder, longer road,\" Mr. Johnson said prior to his shoot on Friday.\n\nMr. Johnson, who competed on five Olympic teams, said he would hone his skill by practicing five hours a day.\n\n\"I enjoy it. It's a funny sport. It can be frustrating at times, but it is also relaxing. Your problems in life seem to go away because you are so focused,\" Mr. Johnson said. \"I have a lot of friends in archery.\"\n\nWorcester resident Daniel Alicandro, 15, competed over the weekend. He practices twice a week, for a total of four hours.\n\nDuring a break in the competition, Mr. Alicandro said he prefers archery competition to attending school.\n\n\"School is hard. This is easy,\" he said.\n\nMr. Alicandro has been shooting for five years, according to his coach, Larry Sullivan of the Riverside Gun Club in Hudson.\n\n\"(Mr. Alicandro) is one of our top shooters,\" Mr. Sullivan said. \"It is something people any age can do, and being physically challenged is not an impediment.\"\n\nIt is the second consecutive year SAAM has hosted the indoor championships at Tantasqua.\n\nThe Junior Olympic or JOAD event is open to youths, while the National Indoor Championship is open to more advanced youth and adult competitors alike. Mr. Hart, 60, founded and organized SAAM 17 years ago, and said the weekend events can draw archers ranging in age from 7 to 70, and sometimes older.\n\nGabrielle Cyr, 16, who has been shooting since she was 5, came down from Falmouth, Maine, with her parents to compete.\n\n\"I've always been around it, I am good at it and I am sticking with it,\" said Ms. Cyr, who practices two hours a day by shooting 200 arrows.\n\nAsked what she does to prepare immediately before competition, Ms. Cyr said, \"I'm trying to trick my brain into being confident.\"\n\nShe said her competition consists of two rounds of 30 shots each, and noted that her best performance was a score of 293 that included 23 bull's-eyes from the indoor competition distance of 18 meters.\n\nShe finished third nationally in her age group last year."
