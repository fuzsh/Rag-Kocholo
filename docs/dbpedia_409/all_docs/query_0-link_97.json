        "text": "Medals aren't the only prize up for grabs at the 2012 London Olympics. Every Summer Games presents an opportunity for the world's greatest athletes to measure themselves up against their predecessors by pursuing Olympic records.\n\nDuring the 2008 Games in Beijing, we witnessed Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt assault the record books with all-time performances that etched their places in the pantheon of Olympic greats. More records are sure to fall in London, where the globe's elite competitors are busy hunting down gold-medal glory and a shot at Olympic immortality.\n\nSome records fall more frequently than others. All but one women's Olympic swimming record was bested in Beijing, while American Bob Beamon's record long jump performance at the 1968 Mexico City Games continues to serve as a benchmark in Olympic competition nearly a half-century after the legendary leap.\n\nOlympic records provide an additional challenge for those looking to make an indelible impact on the Summer Games. From Phelps to Flo Jo, stars emerge at every Olympics.\n\nAs we wonder who might steal the spotlight in London, here's a look at heralded records that many athletes are chasing.\n\n100 meter—Usain Bolt, Jamaica, 2008 Beijing, 9.69\n\n(World record—9.58—Usain Bolt, 2009)\n\n200 meter—Usain Bolt, 2008 Beijing, 19.30\n\nBolt's brilliance in Beijing thrust him into the global spotlight as the World's Fastest Man and his confident (cocky may be more appropriate) demeanor made the Jamaican sprinter a marketing star. His legendary performances in the 200- and 100-meter dashes left even his competitors in awe, as evidenced by American medalist Shawn Crawford's post-race comments.\n\n“What Bolt has done, he’s made history,” Crawford told The New York Times. “He added spirit to the sport. He danced for us in the introduction. He danced for us at the end. He put on a show. To me, I feel like him and athletics is like Michael Phelps and swimming. He raised the bar for us in athletics.”\n\n(WR—19.19—Usain Bolt, 2009)\n\n400 meter—Michael Johnson, U.S., 1996 Atlanta, 43.49\n\n(WR—43:18—Michael Johnson, 1999)\n\n800 meter—Vebjørn Rodal, Norway, 1996 Atlanta, 1:42.58\n\n(WR—1:41.01—David Rudisha, Kenya, 2010)\n\n1,500 meter—Noah Ngeny, Kenya, 2000 Sydney, 3:32.07\n\n(WR—3:26.00—Hicham El Guerrouj, Morocco, 1998)\n\n5,000 meter—Kenenisa Bekele, Ethiopia, 2008 Beijing, 12:57.82\n\n(WR—12:37.35—Kenenisa Bekele, 2004)\n\n10,000 meter—Kenenisa Bekele, 2008 Beijing, 27:01.17\n\nBekele's performance in Beijing may have been overshadowed by Bolt, but the Ethiopian was every bit as dominant, setting two Olympic records. In London, Bekele could become the first man to win gold in the 10,000 meter three times.\n\n(WR—26:17.53—Kenenisa Bekele, 2005)\n\nMarathon—Samuel Wanjiru, Kenya, 2008 Beijing, 2:06:32\n\n(WR—2:03:38—Patrick Makau Musyoki, Kenya, 2011)\n\n110 meter hurdles—Liu Xiang, China, 2004 Athens, 12.91\n\n(WR—12.87—Dayron Robles, Cuba 2011)\n\n400 meter hurdles—Kevin Young, U.S., 1992 Barcelona, 46.78 (WR)\n\nYoung's record is the only Olympic men's athletics mark that also stands as a world record. He galloped to victory in Barcelona, well ahead of the competition, which you can see here.\n\n3,000 meter steeplechase—Julius Kariuki, Kenya, 1988 Seoul, 8:05.51\n\n(WR—7:53.63—Saif Saaeed Shaheen, Qatar 2004)\n\n4×100 meter relay—Nesta Carter, Michael Frater, Usain Bolt and Asafa Powell, Jamaica, 2008 Beijing, 37.10\n\n(WR—37.04—Nesta Carter, Michael Frater, Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake, Jamaica, 2011)\n\n4×400 meter relay—LaShawn Merritt, Angelo Taylor, David Neville and Jeremy Wariner, U.S., 2008 Beijing, 2:55.39\n\n(WR—2:54.29—Andrew Valmon, Quincy Watts, Butch Reynolds and Michael Johnson, U.S., 1993)\n\n20 kilometer walk—Robert Korzeniowski, Poland, 2000 Sydney, 1:18:59\n\n(WR—1:17:16—Vladimir Kanaykin, Russia, 2007)\n\n50 kilometer walk—Alex Schwazer, Italy, 2008 Beijing, 3:37:09\n\n(WR—3:35:27—Yohann Diniz, France, 2011)\n\nHigh jump—Charles Austin, U.S., 1996 Atlanta, 2.39 meters\n\n(WR—2.45 meters—Javier Sotomayor, Cuba, 1993)\n\nLong jump—Bob Beamon, U.S., 1968 Mexico City, 8.90 meters\n\nBeamon's \"perfect jump\" is the oldest record in Olympic athletics. He leaped into history by breaking Jesse Owen's revered mark with a jump so impressive that it has stifled generations of great Olympians.\n\n(WR—8.95 meters—Mike Powell, U.S., 1991)\n\nPole vault—Steven Hooker, Australia, 2008 Beijing, 5.96 meters\n\n(WR—6.14 meters—Sergey Bubka, Ukraine, 1994)\n\nTriple jump—Kenny Harrison, U.S., 1996 Atlanta, 18.09 meters\n\n(WR—18.29 meters—Jonathan Edwards, U.S., 1995)\n\nShot put—Ulf Timmermann, East Germany, 1988 Seoul, 22.47 meters\n\n(WR—23.12 meters—Randy Barnes, U.S., 1990)\n\nDiscus throw—Virgilijus Alekna, Lithuania, 2004 Athens, 69.89 meters\n\n(WR—74.08 meters—Jurgen Schult, East Germany, 1986)\n\nHammer throw—Sergey Litvinov, Soviet Union, 1988 Seoul, 84.80 meters\n\n(WR—86.74 meters—Yuriy Sedykh, Soviet Union, 1986)\n\nJavelin throw—Andreas Thorkildsen, Norway, 2008 Beijing, 90.57 meters\n\n(WR—98.48 meters—Jan Zelezny, Czech Republic, 1996)\n\nDecathlon—Roman Sebrle, Czech Republic, 2004 Athens, 8893 points\n\nOf all the records on this list, Sebrle's decathlon mark may be the most likely to fall. Ashton Easton eclipsed Sebrle's world record while competing at the 2012 U.S. Team Trials in Eugene, Ore. last month. The 24-year-old compiled 9,039 points and he is among the premier, topping an 11-year-old mark by 13 points. Many believe Eaton will display similar dominance in London.\n\n(WR—9,039 points—Ashton Eaton, U.S., 2012)\n\n100 meter—Florence Griffith-Joyner, U.S., 1988 Seoul, 10.62\n\n(WR—10.49—Florence Griffith-Joyner, U.S., 1988)\n\n200 meter—Florence Griffith-Joyner, 1988 Seoul, 21.34 (WR)\n\nAlmost a quarter-century later, Flo Jo's 200-meter mark remains the all-time world record. It is one of just two individual Olympic women's track records that also stands as a world record. By the way, she also holds the world record in the 100-meter dash, which she also set in 1988, outside of Olympic competition.\n\n400 meter—Marie-Jose Perec, France, 1996 Atlanta, 48.25\n\n(WR—47.60—Marita Koch, East Germany, 1985)\n\n800 meter—Nadezhda Olizarenko, Soviet Union, 1980 Moscow, 1:53.43\n\n(WR—1:53.28—Jarmila Kratochvilova, Czech Republic, 1983)\n\n1,500 meter—Paula Ivan, Romania, 1988 Seoul, 3:53.96\n\nIvan absolutely cruised to a gold medal in the event at the '88 Olympics. Her margin of victory in the 1,500 (nearly seven seconds) remains the largest to this day.\n\n(WR—3:50.46—Qu Yunxia, China, 1993)\n\n5,000 meter—Gabriela Szabo, Romania, 2000 Sydney, 14:40.79\n\n(WR—14:11.15—Tirunesh Dibaba, Ethiopia, 2008)\n\n10,000 meter—Tirunesh Dibaba, Ethiopia, 2008 Beijing, 29:54.66\n\n(WR—29:31.78—Wang Junxia, China, 1993)\n\nMarathon—Naoko Takahashi, Japan, 2000 Sydney, 2:23:14\n\nRemarkably, Takahashi's Olympic record remains more than seven minutes behind the all-time women's world record set by Paula Radcliffe in 2003.\n\n(WR—2:15:25—Paula Radcliffe, Great Britain, 2003)\n\n100 meter hurdles—Joanna Hayes, U.S., 2004 Athens, 12.37\n\n(WR—12.21—Yordanka Donkova, Bulgaria, 1988)\n\n400 meter hurdles—Melanie Walker, Jamaica, 2008 Beijing, 52.64\n\nThis was one of four new Olympic records established by Jamaican runners at the 2008 Games.\n\n(WR—52.34—Yuliya Pechonkina, Russia, 2003)\n\n3,000 meter steeplechase —Gulnara Galkina-Samitova, Russia, 2008 Beijing, 8:58.81 (WR)\n\nThis mark joins Griffith-Joyner's 200 meter finish as the only individual Olympic women's running records to double as world records.\n\n4x100 meter relay—Romy Muller, Barbel Wockel, Ingrid Auerswald and Marlies Gohr, East Germany, 1980 Moscow, 41.60\n\n(WR—41.37—Silke Gladisch, Sabine Rieger, Ingrid Auerswald and Marlies Gohr, East Germany, 1985)\n\n4x400 meter relay—Tatyana Ledovskaya, Olga Nazarova, Mariya Pinigina and Olga Bryzgina, Soviet Union, 1988 Seoul, 3:15.17 (WR)\n\nThe Soviets' performance still stands as the all-time world record in the 4x400.\n\n20 kilometer walk—Olga Kaniskina, Russia, 2008 Beijing, 1:26:31\n\n(WR—1:25:08—Vera Sokolova, Russia , 2011)\n\nHigh jump—Yelena Slesarenko, Russia, 2004 Athens, 2.06 meters\n\n(WR—2.09 meters—Stefka Kostadinova, Bulgaria, 1987)\n\nLong jump—Jackie Joyner-Kersee, U.S., 1988 Seoul, 7.40 meters\n\n(WR—7.52 meters—Galina Chistyakova, Soviet Union, 2009)\n\nPole vault—Yelena Isinbayeva, Russia, 2008 Beijing, 5.05 meters\n\n(WR—5.06 meters—Yelena Isinbayeva, Russia, 2009)\n\nTriple jump—Francoise Mbango Etone, Cameroon, 2008 Beijing, 15.39 meters\n\n(WR—15.50 meters—Inessa Kravets, Ukraine, 1995)\n\nShot put—Ilona Slupianek, East Germany, 1980 Moscow, 22.41 meters\n\n(WR—22.63 meters—Natalya Lisovskaya, Soviet Union, 1987)\n\nDiscus throw—Martina Hellmann, East Germany, 1988 Seoul, 72.30 meters\n\n(WR—76.80 meters—Gabriele Reinsch, East Germany, 1987)\n\nHammer throw—Aksana Miankova, Belarus, 2008 Seoul, 76.34 meters\n\n(WR—79.42 meters—Betty Heidler, Germany, 2011)\n\nJavelin throw—Osleidys Menendez, Cuba, 2004 Athens, 71.53 meters\n\n(WR—72.28 meters—Barbora Spotakova, Czech Republic, 2008)\n\nHeptathlon—Jackie Joyner-Kersee, 1988 Seoul, 7,291 points (WR)\n\nJoyner-Kersee teamed up with fellow American Griffith-Joyner to dominate the '88 Games. Both stars still hold two all-time Olympic marks, each set in Seoul."
