        "text": "American Lilly King misses out on the podium in the 100m breaststroke\n\nThe world record holder in the women’s 100m breaststroke won’t be on the Olympic podium for the race this time around.\n\nKing, competing in her third Olympics, won bronze in Tokyo and was hoping for redemption this time around. She won gold in the race during the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nSouth Africa's Tatjana Smith defends her gold medal in the 100m breaststroke\n\nTatjana Smith is a back-to-back gold medal winner in the women’s 100m breaststroke, repeating her feat from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nSmith posted a time of 1:05.28 to take home the gold and Tang Qianting of China was just behind at 1:05.54. Mona McSharry won Ireland’s first medal of the games by taking bronze, finishing in 1:05.59.\n\nThe USA’s Lilly King, who holds the world record in this event, finished in a disappointing fourth place — just .01 seconds behind McSharry.\n\nWorld record holder Thomas Ceccon of Italy takes gold in 100m backstroke as US' Ryan Murphy takes bronze\n\nAnother men’s race, another photo finish.\n\nWorld record holder Thomas Ceccon of Italy takes home the gold in the men’s 100m backstroke, finishing just .32 seconds ahead of Xi Jiayu of China.\n\nTeam USA’s Ryan Murphy came in just behind to take bronze at 52.39 seconds, equaling his performance in the Tokyo Games.\n\nAmerican Luke Hobson says he's feeling great after bronze in 200m freestyle\n\nLuke Hobson is standing on the podium after finishing just .07 seconds away from a gold medal — and he’s thrilled about it.\n\nHobson is receiving his bronze medal now at La Défense Arena.\n\nCometh the hour, cometh Stephen Nedoroscik's clutch pommel horse routine\n\nStephen Nedoroscik had one job for the USA in the men’s team gymnastics final – and he delivered.\n\nNedoroscik, dubbed the “Clark Kent” of the US team, is a pommel horse specialist, unusually qualifying for the team solely based on his ability in that one event. He’s gained his nickname for wearing thick-rimmed glasses right up until the moment he performs.\n\nThe final gymnast to compete on the pommel horse on the competition’s sixth rotation, the 25-year-old stepped up when needed, scoring 14.866 to help the US to a famous bronze medal – the team’s first in 16 years.\n\nNedoroscik’s efforts earned him a huge cheer from the crowd when his name was announced during the medal ceremony.\n\nThat cameo surely justified his selection in the US team.\n\nAmerican fans out in force at tonight's swimming session\n\nAmerican flags are all over La Défense Arena and chants of “USA” are already echoing around the pool.\n\nThis is obviously one of Team USA’s signature sports, and it seems like the US fans are going to be extremely loud here tonight.\n\nWhat we're watching tonight at the swimming competition\n\nHello from the arena that possesses what appears to be the world’s strongest sound system, La Défense Arena outside Paris, for tonight’s swimming contest.\n\nHighlights tonight include:\n\nWomen’s 400m individual medley: World record holder Summer McIntosh of Canada is looking to capture her first gold medal. Americans Emma Weyant and Katie Grimes are looking to hold her off.\n\nMen’s 200m freestyle: American Luke Hobson is aiming to make the medal stand\n\nMen’s 100m backstroke: American Ryan Murphy aims to avenge a silver medal finish in Tokyo to recapture the gold medal as he did in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.\n\nWomen’s 100m breaststroke: World record holder American Lilly King is also aiming to recapture gold as she did in 2016. She earned bronze in this event in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nWomen’s 200m freestyle: This race is all about Australian Ariarne Titmus, fresh off her gold medal win in the 400m freestyle on Saturday night. She holds both the world and Olympic records in this event.\n\nJapan takes dramatic gold over China in men's team gymnastics final, USA takes bronze\n\nIncredible drama in the men’s team gymnastics final.\n\nJapan has snatched gold on the final rotation having outscored China on the horizontal bar, finishing on 259.594 points overall to China’s 259.062. The US takes bronze with 257.793, the team’s first medal in this event for 16 years.\n\nChina was in pole position to claim gold heading into that final rotation but some costly mistakes dented the team’s chances, with a visibly upset Su Weide scoring just 11.600 after falling twice.\n\nChina’s final athlete, Zhang Boheng, needed to score 15.266 for his country to win gold, and he has a history of doing so after scoring more than that in qualification.\n\nBut after a solid routine, a slight step on the dismount seemed to cost Zhang and he was scored 14.733, relegating China to silver.\n\nThere’s plenty of Japanese fans inside the Bercy Arena, and they’re making a huge amount of noise with that result.\n\nMen's gymnastics team final in full swing at the Bercy Arena\n\nThere’s a packed house at Paris’ Bercy Arena for the men’s gymnastics team final, which is approaching its conclusion.\n\nChina currently leads ahead of Japan and the USA, which has lots of support inside the arena. Chants of “USA! USA!” ring out as Fred Richard completes his floor routine, scoring 14.466.\n\nWill there be a change in the current podium standings with the final rotation? We’ll find out soon enough.\n\nHere's what to watch next at the Olympic Games\n\nMonday continues to be a jam-packed day at the 2024 Olympics.\n\nIt’ll be a big day for swimming with five gold medals up for grabs. Meanwhile, Team USA is feeling the pressure to keep up their streak of being number one in women’s basketball.\n\nHere’s what to watch:\n\nSwimming: Swimmers from all over the world will be vying for gold medals at five events beginning at 8:30 p.m. local time (2:30 p.m. ET). Women’s 400m Individual Medley, Men’s 200m Freestyle, Men’s 100m Backstroke, Women’s 100m Breaststroke and Women’s 200m Freestyle.\n\nWomen’s basketball: USA women’s basketball team is under great expectations to maintain their impressive streak. With seven Olympic gold medals in a row, a 55-game Olympic winning streak and a roster full of incredible talent — all the pressure will be on one of sporting history’s greatest-ever entities to continue its run. US women’s basketball plays at 9 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET).\n\nOlympics commentator dropped over sexist comments about women’s swim team\n\nOlympics commentator Bob Ballard was dropped from Eurosport, the European pay TV company, on Monday after the veteran sportscaster made sexist comments about the Australian women’s swim team.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of Sunday’s 4x100 meter freestyle relay, during which the Australian team won the gold medal, Ballard commented on the team’s apparent delay in exiting the Paris Aquatic Centre as they celebrated.\n\n“Well, the women just finishing off. You know what women are like, hanging around, doing their makeup,” Ballard said.\n\nLizzie Simmonds, the former Olympian and Ballard’s Eurosport co-host, immediately rebuffed his comments.\n\n“Outrageous, Bob,” Simmons said, as Ballard laughed. “Some of the men are doing that as well.”\n\nA spokesperson for Eurosport, which distributes the Olympic broadcast in Europe and shares the same parent company as CNN, confirmed Ballard had been dropped over his comments.\n\nBallard, a veteran commentator who has reported on sports since the mid-’80s, has covered several Olympic games. He also works as a music and news presenter for BBC Local Radio.\n\nIn a statement posted Monday on social media, Ballard offered an apology for his remarks.\n\n“The comments I made during the Australian freestyle relay victory ceremony on Saturday have caused some offense. It was never my intention to upset or belittle anyone and, if I did, I apologize. I am a massive advocate of women’s sport,” he wrote.\n\nJapan's Yuto Horigome defends men's street skateboarding title\n\nJapan’s Yuto Horigome defended his Olympic title in the men’s street skateboarding in dramatic fashion Monday at the 2024 Paris Games.\n\nSitting in seventh place in the eight-man competition before his final trick, the 25-year-old registered the best score of the event with 97.08 points. He would finish with a total score of 281.14.\n\nUSA’s Jagger Eaton and Nyjah Huston earned silver and bronze, respectively. Eaton finished with 281.04 points. Huston had 279.38.\n\nThis event made its Olympic debut at the 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\nChrista Deguchi wins Canada’s first gold of the Paris Games and first ever Olympic judo gold medal\n\nChrista Deguchi won Canada’s first ever Olympic judo gold medal in a thrilling women’s 57kg final Monday with South Korea’s Huh Mimi.\n\nThere was nothing between Deguchi and Huh during regulation time which meant it went to a golden score – an additional period to try and find a winner.\n\nAnd in the extra period, Huh was given her third shido – a warning – for a false attack. Three shidos are equivalent to an automatic ippon, awarding the gold medal to Deguchi, with the Canadian appearing almost disbelieving at the ending.\n\nThe gold medal is Canada’s first gold of the Paris Games.\n\nBronzes were won by Japan’s Funakubo Haruka and France’s Sarah Léonie Cysique.\n\nFrance’s Nicolas Gestin wins gold in men’s canoe slalom\n\nFrance’s Nicolas Gestin won gold in the men’s canoe slalom Monday, finishing over five seconds ahead of Adam Burgess of Team GB in second.\n\nAfter Burgess had laid down an emphatic marker with a time of 96.84 seconds, the pressure was on Gestin to beat the time at the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium who was going with the last attempt of the day having finished first in qualifying.\n\nAnd the 24-year-old didn’t disappoint the home fans, producing a remarkably quick run down the course to finish with a time of 91.36 seconds and claim gold.\n\nBurgess won silver while Slovakia’s Matej Beňuš won bronze.\n\nRafael Nadal says he's at peace if Monday's loss to Novak Djokovic was his last\n\nNovak Djokovic defeated Rafael Nadal in a memorable match in the second round of the Olympics.\n\nHe finished the match with an exclamation mark ace. The 24-time grand slam singles champion won the final two games of the second set after Nadal had won four straight, sending the Roland Garros crowd into raptures.\n\nFollowing the match, Nadal said, “I cannot complain. I have been playing on this (court) for 20 years, fighting for the most important things. I have achieved much more than what I could have dreamed. If that was the last match here, or when(ever) the last match will be, I am going to accept (it) in peace.”\n\nNadal is still competing with Carlos Alcaraz in the men’s doubles draw.\n\nCanada Soccer appeals FIFA's Olympic six-point deduction\n\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) and Canada Soccer are appealing FIFA’s six-point Olympics sanction imposed to the national women’s soccer team with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) amid the drone-spying scandal at the 2024 Paris Games.\n\nOn Saturday, football’s world governing body FIFA deducted six points from the team in group play and suspended coaches for one year.\n\n“The appeal is based on the disproportionality of the sanction, which we believe unfairly punishes the athletes for actions they had no part in and goes far beyond restoring fairness to the match against New Zealand,” COC said in a statement.\n\nA hearing is expected to take place Tuesday, according to Monday’s CAS press release, with a decision to be issued Wednesday.\n\nCNN has reached out to FIFA for comment.\n\nThe COC formally apologized Wednesday after the New Zealand Olympic Committee lodged a complaint that its women’s soccer team practice was recorded by a drone in Saint-Étienne.\n\nCanada, the defending Olympic champion, has won its first two matches of the Games – a 2-1 victory against New Zealand on Thursday and a 2-1 win over France on Sunday.\n\nWith the points deduction, Canada currently sits tied for third with New Zealand, behind Colombia and France in Group A.\n\nCanada plays Colombia at Nice Stadium on Wednesday, still with a chance to advance to the knockout stage.\n\nSouth Korea men's squad wins third team archery Olympic gold medal in a row\n\nThe South Korean dominance over the sport of archery continued on Monday as the nation’s men won the team competition event in Paris.\n\nSouth Korea thoroughly beat host France 5-1 in the final to claim its third Olympic gold medal in a row and seventh in 10 total Summer Games.\n\nThe team – comprised of Kim Je-deok, Kim Woo-jin and Lee Woo-seok – was dominant en route to the final, easing past Japan in the quarterfinals and China in the semifinals.\n\nAnd in the final, the archers showed no sign of nerves, romping to the gold medal with extremely accurate shooting, missing out on the top score of 10 with just four of their 18 arrows.\n\nThey wrapped up the top spot with scores of 57-57, 59-58 and 59-56, not needing a decisive fourth set such was their margin of victory.\n\nThe men’s victory came a day after their women counterparts won their 10th consecutive gold medal in the team event – tied for the longest active gold medal streak at the Olympic Games.\n\nTeam GB silver medalist Tom Daley doesn't rule out a 2028 Summer Games return\n\nOn Monday, famed British diver Tom Daley said he was thrilled to win silver alongside partner Noah Williams in the men’s synchronized 10-meter platform.\n\nThat marked the fourth medal of Daley’s long Olympic career, dating all the way back to the Beijing Games in 2008 when he competed as a fresh-faced 14-year-old.\n\nDaley didn’t rule out competing in Los Angeles for the 2028 Games.\n\n“I live in LA now, so there are chances to do a second home Olympic Games. But right now, I just want to enjoy this moment, and we’ll see how it goes after that.”\n\nNorth Korean table tennis duo, lowest ranked team in the tournament, reaches the gold medal match\n\nRi Jong Sik and Kim Kum Yong of North Korea have produced a sensational run at the Paris Olympics to reach the final of the table tennis mixed doubles.\n\nRemarkably, they are the lowest ranked pair in the tournament but beat the fourth seeds, Wong Chun Ting and Doo Hoi Kem of Hong Kong, to reach the gold medal match.\n\nRi and Kim have already beaten the second and eighth seeds en route to an improbable final appearance.\n\nThey will face China’s Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha, the world No. 1 pair, or Lim Jonghoon and Shin Yubin of South Korea in the final.\n\nSimone Biles will compete in all 4 events in women's team final Tuesday\n\nUSA Gymnastics announced Monday that Simone Biles will compete in all four events – vault, uneven bars, balance beam and floor exercise – in Tuesday’s women’s team final.\n\nAfter her performance on the balance beam, Biles landed awkwardly while warming up for her floor routine and exited the arena before reemerging to get her lower left leg heavily taped.\n\nDespite the apparent discomfort Sunday, she still ended up on the top of the leaderboard in first place in the all-around rankings and with Team USA in first place in team standings.\n\nCecile Landi, her coach, told reporters after the competition that Biles had been dealing with calf pain a couple weeks before Paris that flared up again during Sunday’s competition.\n\nHere is Biles’ 2024 Olympic schedule:\n\nTuesday: Women’s team final, 6:15 p.m. local time (12:15 p.m. ET)\n\nThursday: Women’s all-around final, 6:15 p.m. local time (12:15 p.m. ET)\n\nSaturday: Women’s vault final, 4:20 p.m. local time (10:20 a.m. ET)\n\nAugust 5: Women’s balance beam final, 12:38 p.m. local time (6:38 a.m. ET)\n\nAugust 5: Women’s floor exercise final, 2:23 a.m. local time (8:23 a.m. ET)\n\nThe \"blue man\" at this year’s opening ceremony defends memorable Olympic moment\n\nIt was one of the more memorable moments of arguably the most unique opening ceremony in history, but one that has sparked controversy around the world.\n\nThe scene in question has been described by some critics as a parody of “The Last Supper” and one which featured drag artists and multiple dancers.\n\nThe performance also included Philippe Katerine, a French entertainer who featured as the Greek god of wine, Dionysus, and quickly became known as the “semi-naked blue guy.”\n\nHis appearance went viral on social media, watched by millions of people around the world. In an interview with CNN, Katerine said his song “Nue” – or “Naked” – was a message for peace, inspired by war, such as those in Gaza and Ukraine.\n\nOlympic organizers have already apologized for the scene after it was criticized by the Catholic Church and Christian groups.\n\nYou can read more here.\n\n\"Grateful to be doing what I love,\" Simone Biles says, a day after fighting through a calf injury flareup\n\n“Grateful to be doing what I love,” Simone Biles said Monday in an Instagram post, a day after fighting through a calf injury flareup during women’s gymnastics qualification.\n\nDespite the apparent discomfort Sunday, she still ended up on the top of the leaderboard, with Biles in first place in the all-around rankings and with Team USA in first place in team standings.\n\nAfter her performance on the balance beam, Biles landed awkwardly while warming up for her floor routine and exited the arena before reemerging to get her lower left leg heavily taped.\n\nCecile Landi, her coach, told reporters after the competition that Biles had been dealing with calf pain a couple weeks before Paris that flared up again during Sunday’s competition.\n\nThe men’s team final takes place Monday, while the women’s team final is Tuesday.\n\nMichael Jung wins eventing individual gold for Germany\n\nMichael Jung won gold for Germany in the eventing individual final, becoming the first rider in history to win the Olympic title three times.\n\nThe 41-year-old finished with a score of 21.80, just ahead of Australia’s Christopher Burton on 22.40 in silver medal position.\n\nTeam GB’s Laura Collett picked up the bronze medal just hours after winning team gold.\n\nTeam USA to finally receive figure skating gold medals from Beijing 2022 on August 7 in Paris\n\nTeam USA’s figure skating team will finally receive the gold medals it earned from the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics on August 7 in a special reallocation event in Paris following the Kamila Valieva doping case fallout.\n\nOn Monday, International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams announced the delayed ceremony will occur at the Paris Games’ Champions Park, where 2024 Summer Olympics’ medal winners receive their hardware.\n\nInitially, Valieva and the other members of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) squad were awarded first in the team figure skating event. However, the results were removed when Valieva was disqualified after being found guilty of an anti-doping rule violation.\n\nThe reallocation also means the team from Japan will be awarded silver.\n\nIt is unclear who will receive bronze. Earlier this year, Canada filed an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) seeking to move up to bronze position. CAS said last week it is still considering Canada’s appeal. As of now, the ROC sits in third after the reallocation.\n\nAdams also said that another allocation ceremony will take place in Paris on August 9. Ten other athletes will be awarded medals following retroactive results decisions from three previous Summer Olympic Games.\n\nHere is the latest medal count for this year's Olympic Games\n\nCNN is tracking every country in the race for the most gold medals in Paris at the 2024 Summer Olympic Games.\n\nCheck back throughout the two weeks of events for the number of golds by country.\n\nBelow is the medal count, so far:\n\nTeam GB's Tom Pidcock recovers from puncture to retain his mountain bike Olympic title\n\nTeam GB’s Tom Pidcock put in a heroic performance to recover from a puncture and still retain his mountain bike Olympic title on Monday.\n\nPidcock’s race looked to be over when he suffered a front wheel puncture on the third lap which cost him approximately 26 seconds and saw him slip down to ninth.\n\nBut the 24-year-old dug deep and clawed his way back despite falling almost 40 seconds behind the leading rider, France’s Victor Koretzky.\n\nAnd in an astonishing finish, Pidcock passed Koretzky with just over a lap to go, with the pair going head-to-head all the way to the finish line.\n\nPidcock staved off a late charge from the Frenchman but in the end, had enough to finish 9 seconds clear to complete a remarkable race for the reigning Olympic gold medalist.\n\nHe was joined in celebration by his family, while Koretzky could be seen in tears having won silver. South Africa’s Alan Hatherly finished in third to claim bronze.\n\nPidcock – who turns 25 on Tuesday – becomes just the second man to win two Olympic mountain bike gold medals after France’s Julien Absalon.\n\nAfter the race, Pidcock described his race as “suffering, suffering.”\n\n“I enjoy the races where I put the work in and it’s kind of easier – Tokyo was better in that respect because I was in control.\n\n“Here, I was not in control, I was fighting to come back. I made two mistakes, I punctured and fell off the course in the same place, so it was a battle out there.”\n\nHere are the official race times:\n\nPidcock: 1:26:22\n\nKoretzky: 1:26:31\n\nAlan Hatherly of South Africa: 1:26:33\n\nThis post was updated with remarks by Great Britain’s Tom Pidcock.\n\nNovak Djokovic puts an end to Rafael Nadal's comeback and moves on to the third round\n\nNovak Djokovic defeated Rafael Nadal in an epic showdown in the second round of the Olympics, putting the Spaniard away in straight sets 6-1, 6-4.\n\nHe finished the match with an exclamation mark ace.\n\nThe 24-time grand slam singles champion won the final two games of the second set after Nadal had won four straight, sending the Roland Garros crowd into raptures. But the top-seeded Serb would not be denied in his quest for a first gold medal and the completion of the career golden slam.\n\nNadal draws even with Djokovic in the second set, 4-4\n\nRafael Nadal has now taken four consecutive games from Novak Djokovic as the top-seeded Serb is reeling.\n\nRoland Garros is rocking and Nadal looks a completely different player from earlier in the match.\n\nDjokovic still is only two games away from taking this match but all the momentum is with his longtime rival.\n\nCoco Gauff reaches 3rd round of women's singles tournament with straight sets win over María Lourdes Carlé\n\nCoco Gauff advanced to the third round of the women’s singles tournament on Monday after a straight sets victory over María Lourdes Carlé.\n\nThe No. 2 seed raced into a 5-0 lead in the first set on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, eventually winning 6-1.\n\nThe US player broke Argentina’s Carlé in the opening game of the second set to continue to assert her control, racing away to clinch her spot in the next round 6-1.\n\nGauff has already shown she is formidable on Paris’ clay courts this year, having won the women’s doubles title at the French Open in June.\n\nShe will now face Croatia’s Donna Vekić in the next round after the 28-year-old beat Bianca Andreescu in straight sets earlier on Monday.\n\nVekić’s run to the third round continues her excellent form this season, after reaching the semifinals of Wimbledon earlier this month, her career-best performance at a grand slam.\n\nNadal takes 3 straight games and the mood has completely changed at Roland Garros\n\nThe cheers of “Rafa!” began feeling a little half-hearted here in Paris as Novak Djokovic built a 4-0 lead in the second set, threatening to run away with this one.\n\nBut Rafael Nadal and Paris have a special relationship. And he’s riding that wave of love to a remarkable surge in momentum.\n\nIt’s now 4-3 in the second set and we are set for a crucial game. If Nadal breaks Djokovic here, then it’s all to play for. But if this wave of momentum breaks, then Djokovic is just one set away from victory.\n\nNadal breaks Djokovic and is clawing back into this match, down 4-2\n\nWell, don’t look now but Rafael Nadal isn’t quite done yet.\n\nThe Spanish great has a tall mountain to climb against Novak Djokovic but he’s taken two straight games in the second set and now trails 4-2. He just broke Djokovic after the Serb double faulted.\n\nIf he takes this third game, expect Roland Garros to explode.\n\nDjokovic breaks Nadal again to take a 4-0 lead\n\nThe all-time men’s grand slam leader is flying out of the blocks here.\n\nHe just took the third and fourth games of the match, breaking Nadal’s serve a second time to take a commanding lead in the first set – including not allowing Nadal to take a point in the third game of the set.\n\nIt’s probably a little earlier for a pressure moment than Nadal would have wanted, but he’s facing a crucial game.\n\nDjokovic has also displayed a bit of sportsmanship: on a close shot that got by him on his left, the Serb went over to the ball mark to show it had landed in play.\n\nDjokovic breaks Nadal in 2nd game of their match\n\nIt didn’t take long for a major moment in the match to take place.\n\nNovak Djokovic just got the first break of the match in only the second game. He’s now up 2-0 over Rafael Nadal in the early going.\n\nUnlike in grand slam play, Olympic men’s matches are only three sets. That means there’s little margin for error from either competitor as the match gets going.\n\nDjokovic takes the first game as epic clash against Nadal gets underway\n\nTop-seeded Novak Djokovic has taken the first game in his match against Rafael Nadal as this clash of the titans gets going at Ronald Garros today.\n\nIf the first game is any indication, we are in for a treat. The power of both men has been on display so far with both sending rockets past one another in the opening game.\n\nWhile the crowd is mostly pro-Nadal, with loud chants of “Ra-fa!” after most points, bursts of noise follow every winner in this nearly 15,000 seat stadium.\n\nTeam GB defends team eventing title to secure first gold medal of Paris Olympics\n\nTeam GB defended its team eventing title Monday to earn the nation’s first gold medal of the Paris Olympics.\n\nRider Laura Collett – teamed up with Rosalind Canter and Tom McEwen – put in a near-faultless final round to secure back-to-back Olympic titles ahead of host nation France, whose riders were overjoyed with securing silver.\n\nIt’s only the second time Team GB has successfully defended the team eventing title after also doing so in 1972, according to the BBC.\n\nTeam GB now has five Olympic golds in team eventing, the most in history.\n\nJapan took the bronze medal, its first equestrian medal since 1932.\n\n“Unreal feeling,” Collett said of retaining gold. “It felt so special in Tokyo, but this is blowing it out of the water.”\n\nMcEwen added: “Humans. Spectators. It’s been amazing. From yesterday’s cross-country with the noise as you were going around, it’s like a world of noise following you around. Today’s shown off the best of this sport’s abilities.\n\n“These horses have been incredible and these people in this team is even better.”\n\nThis post was updated with remarks by Great Britain’s Laura Collett and Tom McEwen.\n\nDjokovic and Nadal take the court and Roland Garros explodes\n\nThe anticipation is off the charts here. Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal just posed for the prematch photo and are warming up to roars from Roland Garros.\n\nFew people are sitting as the two men knock the ball back and forth across the clay. They’re both wearing the red shirts of their respective countries and Nadal is in his trademark white headband.\n\nNadal and Djokovic set for their 60th matchup\n\nIt’s one of the most storied rivalries in world tennis over the last two decades.\n\nMonday’s match will be the 60th time Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal have faced each other, extending their record. Over their previous matches, Djokovic has the slimmest of advantages over Nadal, 30-29.\n\nThey’ve met before in the Olympics, in the 2008 semifinals that Nadal won on his way to a gold medal. Their last meeting was in 2022 at Roland Garros in the French Open, which Nadal also won.\n\nThe crowd here in Paris is absolutely amped in preparation for this renewal of a legendary matchup, with Djokovic looking for his first gold medal in his career.\n\nOlympic Games officials say they are confident triathlon events will go ahead Tuesday\n\nOlmpic officials remain confident that triathlon events will be able to go ahead despite concerns over the water quality of the River Seine.\n\nSpeaking at the daily International Olympic Committee press conference, Thobois said that “as you could see there’s been quite a lot of rain in the last couple of days, but we are monitoring very closely,” adding that the forecast is improving.\n\n“We are very respectful of the athletes and they are the heart of the Olympic Games,” Thobois added when pressed on how he feels about the athletes going to bed tonight not knowing whether they will be able to compete when they wake up.\n\nThe Paris 2024 chief reiterated that everything possible has been done “to achieve the level quality to swim in the River Seine.”\n\nAsked whether authorities are concerned about the current of the river, Thobois said that although “it’s been much higher than normally this time of the year,” there are no issues in this regard.\n\nWhat to watch out for today\n\nIt was another action-packed day at the Games yesterday and Day 3 shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nNadal vs Djokovic: A huge moment at this year’s Games is almost underway in the men’s singles tennis tournament. Two of the greatest players of all-time, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, are facing each other in the second round at Court Philippe-Chatrier with play set to begin very shortly.\n\nTeam USA women’s basketball: Much is expected of the US women’s basketball team at this year’s Olympics, as it bids to win an eighth consecutive gold medal. The squad’s campaign gets underway against Japan, with action due to start at 3 p.m. ET (9 p.m. local).\n\nMen’s skateboarding final: We saw a 14-year-old win gold in the women’s street skateboarding final yesterday and it’s now over to the men. The men’s street skateboarding final is due to start at 11 a.m. ET (5 p.m. local) and defending Olympic champion Yuto Horigome is one to watch out for.\n\nGymnastics team final: The men’s team gymnastics final is set to begin at 11:30 a.m. ET (5:30 p.m. local).
