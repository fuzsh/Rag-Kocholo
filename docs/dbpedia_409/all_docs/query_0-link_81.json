        "text": "With all the controversy surrounding the Olympics in recent years, maybe it shouldn't raise eyebrows when one American athlete is tossed after being accused of cheating and a 1996 gold medalist quits after being charged with possession and sale of drugs.\n\nBut on the archery squad?The six archers who will represent the United States in Sydney are among several hundred competing at the National Target Championships through Friday at Heritage Park.\n\nMuch of the attention won't be on U.S. medal chances - still very good - but on the elimination of Shane Parker and ponytailed Justin Huish, the latter a media star at the Atlanta Games.\n\nHuish, who won an individual gold medal, resigned from the team this past spring after Simi Valley, Calif., police charged him and his roommate with possession of marijuana and hashish oil and with selling drugs to a police informant.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty, but has been replaced on the team by Rod White of Waterloo, Iowa.\n\nParker, from Hurdle Mills, S.C., was dismissed from the team for allegedly shooting two extra arrows during the final qualifying meet last year, an event at which he had seemed to knock two-time Olympian Butch Johnson to the alternate spot.\n\nTeam officials said Parker shot the extra arrows without being caught because he twice missed the target completely in the rainy conditions, something almost unheard of at this level.\n\nBill Kellum, a spokesman for the National Archery Association, said Parker later told someone he had shot two more arrows than were allowed, and word got back to the association.\n\nThe NAA replaced Parker with Johnson, who won a team gold medal in Atlanta in 1996. Parker is appealing.\n\nIn addition to White and Johnson, the other member of the U.S. men's team is Vic Wunderle of Mason City, Ill.\n\nThe women's team includes perennial champion Janet Dykman of El Monte, Calif.; Karen Scavotto of Enfield, Conn.; and Denise Parker of Salt Lake City (no relation to Shane Parker).\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
