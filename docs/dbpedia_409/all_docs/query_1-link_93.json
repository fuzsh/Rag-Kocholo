        "text": "The U.S. Olympic Archery Team for the Paris Olympics 2024 was announced a couple of months ago. Compared to the Tokyo Olympics, the American team for this edition is a bit smaller.\n\nFor the first time since the Seoul Olympics in 1988, the U.S. Olympic Archery Team will not include the men's team. This is because the male archers failed to qualify for the Paris Olympics.\n\nSo only Brady Ellison will accompany the female archers to the Paris Olympics 2024. Apart from Ellison, world number 1 archer Casey Kaufhold proved her mettle at the U.S. Olympic trials, and she will be accompanied by fellow archers Catalina GNoriega and Jennifer Mucino-Fernandez, who stood second and third respectively.\n\nThis would be the second chance for Casey Kaufhold, who was one of the youngest American archers since Denise Parker to have taken part in the Summer Olympics. Kaufhold was just 16 when she took part in the Tokyo Olympics, although she was eliminated in the preliminary rounds. At the Paris Olympics, she would be looking forward to proving herself.\n\nCan Brady Ellison end the golden drought for the U.S. Olympic Archery Team at Paris Olympics 2024?\n\nHowever, at the Paris Olympics 2024, all eyes will be on Brady Ellison, one of the most experienced archers of the U.S. Olympic Archery Team. Paris Olympics 2024 will be his fifth and final shot at Olympic glory. Can Brady Ellison bring back the gold medal that has eluded the U.S. Olympic Archery Team in almost every category since Atlanta 1996?\n\nBrady Ellison made his Olympic debut in Beijing in 2008. He had qualified for both the individual, as well as the team event, but didn't proceed beyond the second round in either. However, the then 20-year-old archer had gained enough experience to try his luck again at the London Olympics in 2012.\n\nOnce again, Ellison couldn't proceed beyond the second round in the individual category. However, he more than made up for it by leading the men's team to a silver medal, losing to the Italian team in the finals by just one point. This was the USA's first medal in Olympic archery in 12 years, their last medals coming at the Sydney Olympics held in 2000. Ellison further ended the individual medal drought by winning a bronze medal at the Rio Olympics in 2016.\n\nWhile the Tokyo Olympics was a forgettable affair for Brady Ellison, he would be looking forward to giving it his all at the Paris Olympics, where he is competing in both the individual, as well as the mixed team event."
