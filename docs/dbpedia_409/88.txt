USA Archery has announced the sudden passing of five-time Olympian and Atlanta 1996 team gold medallist Butch Johnson at the age of 68.

Johnson, a well-known figure domestically and abroad, competed at five consecutive Olympic Games from Barcelona 1992 to Beijing 2008.

His best individual finish – 11th – came in 1996, when he also combined with Justin Huish and Rod White to deliver the USA’s only recurve men’s Olympic team gold medal to date.

Butch had success at world, continental and national level throughout his long career.

A converted compound archer, Johnson was known for his unorthodox and analytical approach to his equipment, and for anchoring the US international team over two decades.

World Archery secretary general Tom Dielen celebrated his legacy.

“Butch was an icon in the sport, matching a unique technique approach with elite success and unrivalled longevity as the USA Archery’s most-capped Olympian.”

“His impact went beyond the shooting line to the many archers he coached and mentored. My condolences go to his wife, Teresa, his family and the archery community in the USA.”
