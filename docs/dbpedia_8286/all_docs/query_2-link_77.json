        "text": "MySQL Workbench is a graphical visual database design tool with multiple functionalities. This tutorial will cover database design and modeling with MySQL Workbench. <!--more-->\n\nPrerequisites #\n\nThis article is suitable for beginner to intermediate MySQL Workbench users. It requires no prior knowledge of MySQL Workbench.\n\nHowever, knowledge in relational databases and database design may be required. To get started with the MySQL database, check the MySQL Tutorial website.\n\nIntroduction to MySQL Workbench #\n\nThere are two editions of MySQL Workbench: the community edition and the commercial edition. The community edition is open source. Both editions are available for three major platforms; MS Windows, macOS, and Linux. The commercial edition comes with more functionalities at a cost.\n\nSome of the extra functionalities available in the commercial edition are:\n\nMySQL Enterprise backup\n\nMySQL Firewall\n\nMySQL Audit\n\nMySQL Workbench has five main functions:\n\nDatabase design (data modeling) #\n\nThis involves creating simple to complex entity-relationship (ER) models. Reverse engineering creates a database from ER models. Forward engineering creates an ER model from a live database.\n\nDeveloping SQL #\n\nMySQL Workbench has a built-in SQL editor with syntax highlighting and auto-complete. It is used to interact with the MySQL Server.\n\nAdministration #\n\nSome of the MySQL Workbench database administrative functions are:\n\nBackup\n\nRecovery\n\nAudit\n\nMonitoring server performance\n\nChecking database health\n\nUser management\n\nMySQL Workbench has a visual performance dashboard. The visual performance dashboard enables database administrators to view key performance indicators. Below is a screenshot of the MySQL Workbench visual performance dashboard.\n\nImage source\n\nData migration #\n\nMySQL Workbench is used to migrate databases from other relational database management systems (RDBMS). Some of the supported RDBMS are PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, SQLite, MS Access, Sybase, and Sybase SQL Anywhere.\n\nMySQL enterprise support #\n\nMySQL Workbench enterprise edition supports MySQL enterprise products.\n\nIn this tutorial, the focus will be on database design.\n\nSetting up MySQL Workbench #\n\nWorkbench is one of the MySQL products. Use MySQL Installer to manage MySQL products installations. Find the list of MySQL Workbench supported platforms on MySQL official website. For the MySQL Workbench hardware requirements, check the image below.\n\nImage source\n\nInstalling MySQL Workbench on Windows #\n\nDownload MySQL Installer from the official website. Install MySQL Workbench using the downloaded installer. For this installation, I recommend the default configurations, as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nThe Developer Default setup type comes with MySQL Workbench and other developer tools.\n\nYou can find more detailed installation guidelines for MySQL Workbench on MySQL Workbench Manual.\n\nVerifying MySQL Workbench installation #\n\nLaunch MySQL Workbench.\n\nYou can do this from the installation wizard.\n\nLinux: Launch by typing the command mysql-workbench. Alternatively, navigate to Activities > MySQL WorkBench.\n\nmacOS: Navigate to Applications > MySQL Workbench.\n\nWindows: Navigate to Start > Programs > MySQL > MySQL Workbench.\n\nMake sure there is a connection to the MySQL Server local instance, as shown in the screenshot below. If there is no connection, click the + icon to create a new connection, as highlighted in the screenshot below.\n\nProvide the connection details.\n\nThe created connection will be displayed, as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nDatabase design with MySQL Workbench #\n\nThis section will create a new ER model and then translate it into a physical MySQL database. On MySQL Workbench, navigate to File > New Model as shown below.\n\nSave the model. Double click MySQL Schema and change the name from mydb to booksdb. Click the Add Diagram icon to create a new EER diagram. Refer to the screenshot below.\n\nAfter adding a new diagram, a new window will be opened, as in the screenshot below.\n\nScenario #\n\nIn this tutorial, we will model and create a database that will be used to keep book details. The database should store books with author and publisher details. We will skip the database normalization process details.\n\nThe final database will have three main entities with attributes, as shown below:\n\nBook: id, title, ISBN, publisher, total_pages, publication_year, author.\n\nAuthor: id, first_name, last_name.\n\nPublisher: id, name.\n\nWe will use the information in the tables below to design the ER model. All the column names have been defined. Primary keys, foreign keys, and datatypes are also outlined.\n\nBook table\n\ncolumn namedata typecan be nullindex typeauto_incrementidintegernoprimary keyyesisbnvarchar(45)nouniquepublisherintegernoforeign keyauthorintegernoforeign keytotal_pagesintegernopublication_yearyear(4)notitlevarchar(255)no\n\nAuthor table\n\ncolumn namedata typecan be nullindex typeauto_incrementidintegernoprimary keyyesfirst_namevarchar(45)nolast_namevarchar(45)no\n\nPublisher table\n\ncolumn namedata typecan be nullindex typeauto_incrementidintegernoprimary keyyesnamevarchar(45)no\n\nThe relationships between the entities are as below:\n\nThe relationship between the book and the author is many-to-many. An author can have multiple publications. A book can also have multiple authors. This type of relationship requires an extra table called a bridge table. MySQL Workbench automatically creates a bridge table when we add a many-to-many relationship.\n\nThe relationship between the book and the publisher is one-to-many. A book can only have one publisher. A publisher can publish multiple books.\n\nUsing MySQL Workbench, we will design an enhanced entity-relationship (EER) diagram. MySQL Workbench allows us to create tables, edit the attributes, and create relationships between the tables.\n\nThe visual design interface #\n\nThe diagram below shows a MySQL Workbench design window screenshot. The window has different panels highlighted in different colors.\n\nThe vertical toolbar panel #\n\nThe vertical toolbar has different tools used in creating EER diagrams. The screenshot below shows all the tools. Hovering the mouse pointer on each tool will show the name or the function of each tool.\n\nThere are six tools used to create different types of relationships in MySQL Workbench. 1:1 is read as one-to-one; 1:n is read as one-to-many, n:m is read as many-to-many.\n\nAdd tables #\n\nWe are going to add three tables to the EER model. The animation below shows the process of adding a table and the columns.\n\nTo add a table, follow these steps:\n\nSelect the table tool on the vertical tools panel, then click anywhere on the EER diagram canvas. This creates a table with no columns.\n\nDouble click the table created to open the table properties window.\n\nOn the table properties window, change the table name.\n\nAdd columns to the table. To add new columns, click on the last blank column. Edit the column name and select the appropriate data type for each column.\n\nPlease do not add the columns described as foreign keys. MySQL Workbench has an easier way of adding them by creating relationships, and the foreign keys are added automatically.\n\nSelect all the column properties such as primary key, not null, unique, and autoincrement.\n\nRepeat the process for all the tables.\n\nYour EER diagram should look as shown below.\n\nAdd relationships #\n\nWe will add two different relationships to the EER diagram.\n\nOne-to-many relationship #\n\nThere is a one-to-many relationship between the book and the publisher. We will use the relationship tools to add relationships. To create a one-to-many relationship, make sure that one of the tables has a primary key.\n\nSelect the appropriate relationship tool. In this case, we are going to use the one-to-many non-identifying relationship. Click the table on the \"many\" side. In this case, it is the book table.\n\nClick the table containing the referenced key. In this case, it is the publisher table. A foreign key is created on the book table with the default name as fk_book_has_author_book. To change the foreign key properties, double click the connection line to open the relationship editor.\n\nMany-to-many relationship #\n\nThere is a many-to-many relationship between the book and the author. Select the many-to-many relationship tool. Click on the book table, then click on the author table as shown in the animation below. A bridge table with the name book_has_author is generated automatically.\n\nAfter creating the relationships, the EER diagram will be as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nYou can find the EER diagram workbench file created in this tutorial on Github.\n\nForward engineering with MySQL Workbench #\n\nThe visual database model created can be transformed into a physical database. This process is known as forward engineering. SQL code is generated and executed on a target MySQL Server. This is easier than writing the code manually.\n\nStep 1 #\n\nTo launch forward engineering wizard, Navigate to Databases > Forward Engineer.\n\nStep 2 #\n\nCreate a new connection to MySQL Server or select an existing one, as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nClick NEXT.\n\nStep 3 #\n\nThe wizard gives us SQL export options. For this exercise, use the default selected options.\n\nStep 4 #\n\nSelect the objects you would like to include in the EER diagram. These will include tables, views, routines, users, and triggers. In this exercise, we only have tables.\n\nMake sure the option to import 4 table objects is selected, then click NEXT.\n\nStep 5 #\n\nIn this step, we are provided with the generated SQL script. Find the SQL file generated in this tutorial on Github.\n\nStep 6 #\n\nThis is the final step. Click finish to commit. The generated SQL file is used to create a physical database in the connected MySQL Server.\n\nTo view the database created on MySQL Workbench, navigate to Database > Connect to Database. Choose an existing connection to connect to MySQL Server or create a new one. The database created will be as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nReverse engineering with MySQL Workbench #\n\nReverse engineering enables us to have a better view of an existing database. A physical database is converted to an EER diagram. We will be reverse engineering the database we created earlier. Reverse engineering can be done while using a MySQL Create Script or by using a live database.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will use the live database we created in the forward engineering section.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nStep 1 #\n\nNavigate to Database > Reverse Engineer.\n\nStep 2 #\n\nCreate a new connection to the MySQL Server or select an existing one, as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nClick NEXT.\n\nStep 3 #\n\nReview the information displayed and make sure that the connection was successful, then click NEXT.\n\nStep 4 #\n\nSelect the schema you would like to reverse engineer. In this case, select booksdb, then click NEXT.\n\nStep 5 #\n\nThe results of the tasks carried out are displayed in the wizard below. Review the results, then click NEXT.\n\nStep 6 #\n\nWe are prompted to select the objects to reverse engineer. By default, all the available objects are selected. Leave the default options, then click NEXT.\n\nStep 7 #\n\nThe wizard shows the reverse engineering progress. In the screenshot below, the process was successful. In case of an error, check error details by clicking Show Logs.\n\nClick NEXT.\n\nStep 8 #\n\nThis step shows the summary of the objects generated. In this case, we have four table objects.\n\nClick Finish.\n\nOutput #\n\nThe EER diagram below is generated. You can save it for later use.\n\nConclusion #\n\nMySQL Workbench is such a useful tool. It can be used by MySQL database administrators, system developers, and database developers. You can create a database from an ER model without writing MySQL statements. At first, the tool may seem complex to use, but with time it gets easier. Practice makes perfect.\n\nHappy Coding!"
