It used to crash on me on a daily basis however it has improved significantly in the last 6 months or so. I'm not sure if you're aware but every few weeks they release a new minor version. The latest version is 5.2.37 and it's been working quite well for me. If you haven't updated your installation please consider that before searching for an alternative.\n\nAlso...\n\nsquirrel SQL is a Java/JDBC database tool. It isn't database specific, but you can use with whatever DB you have JDBC drivers for. Clunky at times, but useful.\n\nEclipse SQL Explorer which can be used within eclipse or as a standalone client. It also uses JDBC."
