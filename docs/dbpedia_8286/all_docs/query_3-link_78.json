The expertise of working with Objective C has resulted in sound solutions and performing applications.\n\nWhen is it advised to work with Objective C and why?\n\nWhen:\n\nYou need to achieve maximum performance for iPhone, iPad, Apple products\n\nYou are searching rapid solutions for iOS and MacOS\n\nBecause:\n\nObjective C is the native programming language for iOS and MacOS (OS X)\n\nIt is simpler than C++ and is easier to learn\n\nIt allows dynamic typing and dynamic loading\n\nObjective C is the right option for:\n\niOS\n\nMacOS (OS X)\n\nTechnologies:\n\niPhone SDK, CoCoa, CoCoa Touch\n\nGood to know\n\nObjective C is a strict superset of C. Dating since the 80â€™s, Objective C is a general purpose, object-oriented programming language that incudes Smalltalk style to the C programming language. Currently it is used mainly for OS X and iOS, their APIs, Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.\n\nCodespring software engineers find Objective C easy to use and reliable for high performance applications developed for iOS and MacOS. The possibility to compile any C program with an Objective-C compiler and to freely include C code within an Objective-C class is an opportunity for the seasoned developer."
