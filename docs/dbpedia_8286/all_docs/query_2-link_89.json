        "text": "Hey Sam, as far as I know, none of those development environments come with MySQL Workbench, although I've only used XAMPP personally. XAMPP comes with PHPMySQL, if you need a GUI interface for working with your databases, but Workbench is nicer and can be used with any development environment on your machine. I'd also suggest just learning how to interface with MySQL through the command line. It may seem scary at first, but it's actually much faster and easier once you get the hang of it. I suggest running though the new SQL Basics course as well as the Console Foundations course here on Treehouse. And the older course Database Foundations course (confusingly located in the Development Tools section of the library rather than the Database section) shows you how to download and work with MySQL Workbench. :-) In other words, Treehouse has you covered.\n\nI actually haven't used Drupal before. Most of my learning was initially centered around Wordpress. But the basic PHP and SQL fundamentals are the same. The best thing you can do is just sponge up all the knowledge you can and put things into practice as quickly as possible. And if you run into something you don't know, go ahead and Google it. :-)"
