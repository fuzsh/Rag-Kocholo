        "text": "I'm a big fan of MySQL.\n\nThe community edition of the MySQL server, as the open-source database is formally known, is a popular choice for both development and deployment because it checks all the right boxes:\n\nIt's open source.\n\nIt's actively maintained.\n\nIt's GPL-licensed.\n\nIt's standards-based.\n\nIts system requirements are minimal.\n\nFurthermore, it's relatively easy to install the MySQL database on a Windows machine. It's also simple to set up MySQL on your preferred version of Linux.\n\nHow to install MySQL on Windows\n\nTo install MySQL on Windows, simply follow these steps:\n\nDownload the MySQL Community Edition installer.\n\nOpen the MySQL installer and choose a full installation.\n\nProvide a password for the admin account when asked.\n\nAccept the remaining defaults and click Finish when done.\n\nDuring the installation you can change the port number on which the MySQL database runs, but it's best to just stick to the default, Port 3306. That's where other applications expect it to run.\n\nMySQL Windows service\n\nFurthermore, you can choose to run MySQL as a Windows service, which causes MySQL to start every time you reboot your machine.\n\nThe MySQL database on Windows is lightweight, and its impact on performance is minimal. Nevertheless, if you want to conserve memory and clock-cycles, you can turn off the Windows MySQL service and start MySQL from the command line when needed.\n\nMySQL Server and components\n\nWhen you choose a full MySQL install on Windows, the following components will be installed:\n\nThe MySQL Server -- the core of the database.\n\nMySQL Workbench to view your databases and schemas.\n\nMySQL Shell to issue SQL statements on the command-line.\n\nMySQL Router to help with database scaling.\n\nThe MySQL Documentation.\n\nSome pre-populated database tables to play with.\n\nAfter the database is installed, a good smoke test is to open the MySQL Workbench.\n\nWith this, you can validate your credentials, verify the database is running, and run queries and issue SQL statements to ensure the database is working correctly.\n\nWhen the smoke test is complete, you're ready to configure the database for development or prepare it for enterprise deployment.\n\nDatabase development with Java, C++ and Python\n\nDevelopers often install MySQL to support database development with technologies including Hibernate, SQLAlchemy, or even Open Database Community queries. However, you need to download a separate driver to connect a Java, Python or C++ app to MySQL. The database drivers are no longer part of the basic installation.\n\nThe MySQL database drivers are available from the MySQL site's downloads page and can be manually added to any Python or Java app. However, an approach that's more compliant with 12-Factor App is to specify the required driver in Maven POM file or a Python requirements TXT file.\n\nCameron McKenzie has been a Java EE software engineer for 20 years.
