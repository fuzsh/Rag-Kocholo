        "text": "MySQL Workbench is a powerful visual tool for administering your MySQL database. It replaces MySQL's previous GUI tools, such as MySQL Administrator and MySQL Query Browser, allowing you to configure, maintain, and backup your database in one place.\n\nThere is a separate guide available that covers how to Back up and restore MySQL databases using MySQL Workbench 5.\n\nBefore backing up your database\n\nWe strongly recommend that you create regular backups of your database so it can be easily and quickly recovered in the unlikely event that your data is lost or becomes corrupted.\n\nTo backup your database using the methods described in this article you will need to have a copy of MySQL Workbench, an application developed by the producers of MySQL. You can find more information and download the software from https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/.\n\nDefine your server connection\n\nBefore you begin you need to add a connection to the database server.\n\nOnce connected you will be able to backup or restore your database. These links will take you to the relevant instructions:\n\nBackup your database (Export)\n\nRestore your database (Import)\n\nBackup your database (Export)\n\nMySQL Workbench can export a backup of your database to a file on your local computer. This is also sometimes referred to as a data dump.\n\nStep 1\n\nClick Data Export under the Server tab.\n\nStep 2\n\nIn the left pane, select your database by ticking the checkbox next to it.\n\nEnter your database password if prompted.\n\nStep 3\n\nFrom the right hand pane, select the tables that you want to include in your export.\n\nStep 4\n\nChoose where you would like to save your database backup. There are two options available and you can use either. However, Export to Self-Contained File is more commonly used for most Fasthosts customers:\n\nExport to Dump Project Folder: MySQL Workbench will create a separate backup file for each table in your database, which will make it possible to store selected tables in the future without the need to restore the entire database.\n\nExport to Self-Contained File: All selected tables will be exported to one single SQL file.\n\nStep 5\n\nClick Start Export and enter the database password if prompted.\n\nRestore your database from a previous backup (Import)\n\nStep 1\n\nSelect the database you want to import data in to.\n\nStep 2\n\nClick Data Import under the Server tab.\n\nStep 3\n\nEnter your database password if prompted.\n\nStep 4\n\nWhen you created the backup you were presented with the option to export your database tables to a folder or a single self-contained file. This step will differ depending on which option you chose.\n\nStep 5\n\nImport from Dump Project Folder\n\nSelect Import from Dump Project Folder and enter the location in the Folder Path text field. Click Load Folder Contents.\n\nSelect which tables from the backup you would like to restore.\n\nImport from Self-Contained File\n\nSelect Import from Self-Contained File and enter the location in the File Path text field.\n\nStep 6\n\nClick Start Import in the bottom right and enter the database password if prompted. This process may take several minutes depending on the size of your database backup."
