        "text": "Is MySQL Good for Big Data?\n\nMySQL is one of the most popular open-source relational database management systems (RDBMS) designed for fast transactions, making MySQL unsuited as a tool for heavy data analysis.\n\nPerforming big data analysis and compute-intensive business intelligence workflows across large datasets is better suited for a cloud-based data warehouse like Snowflake, BigQuery or Redshift.\n\nIs MySQL a Data Warehouse?\n\nMySQL is not a data warehouse, but is rather more frequently used as one of many data sources to extract MySQL data out of, or to load data into.\n\nUsing MySQL data pipelines, data analysts can extract data MySQL data out of a database into a data warehouse for analysis.\n\nData analysts can subsequently load data transformed in data warehouse into a MySQL production schema, to be consumed by APIs or utilized in the user interfaces of apps. This is a popular use case for SaaS apps that feature reporting or analytics for their users.\n\nIs MySQL an ETL tool?\n\nMySQL is not an ETL tool and does not have built-in ETL connectors.\n\nThus, in order to extract MySQL data as XML or CSV files, or load data into a data warehouse for data analysis, you'll need an ETL tool.\n\nWhat are the Advantages of MySQL ETL tools?\n\nThe advantages of MySQL ETL tools are outsourced complexity and accelerated time-to-value.\n\nYou can configure your own Python-based data integrations by following tutorials, but this can be overly complex and not very user-friendly, especially when dealing with multiple data flows and data pipelines.\n\nA good MySQL ETL process is easy-to-automate and user-friendly.\n\nBelow are the top ETL tools with pricing so you can choose one that works best for your organization's use cases.\n\nList of MySQL ETL Tools\n\nPortable\n\nStitch\n\nFivetran\n\nBlendo\n\nAirbyte\n\nIntegrate.io\n\nPentaho\n\nHevo Data\n\nTalend Open Studio\n\nAmazon AWS Glue\n\nAzure Data Factory\n\nGoogle Dataflow\n\nTop 5 MySQL ETL tools\n\n1.
