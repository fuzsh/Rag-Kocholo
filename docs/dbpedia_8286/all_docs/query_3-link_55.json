        "text": "App development programing languages have evolved substantially throughout the years. What once seemed to be the rarest of skills in programming platforms, mobile programming languages, specifically Apple’s Objective-C and Swift, have come the distance. Today, Swift is easy to pick up, offers better security, adaptability and interoperability. Yet thousands of applications still exist in Objective-C, with many technical teams wondering if there is benefit in upgrading.\n\nIn this post, we’ll take a look at the key differences between Objective-C and Swift, and offer code examples of each. We hope this blog post offers considerable value if you are considering upgrading your application to Swift, or are evaluating which language to write your application in.\n\nA Background on Objective-C\n\nObjective-C is a high-level programming language that was first developed in the early 1980s. It was created by Brad Cox and Tom Love at their company, Stepstone. The language was designed as an extension to the C programming language, adding object-oriented programming capabilities to the language.\n\nIn 1986, NeXT adopted Objective-C as the primary programming language for their NeXTSTEP operating system. Objective-C then became the primary development language for NeXT's software development kits and frameworks, which were later used to develop the first versions of the macOS and iOS operating systems.\n\nIn 1996, Apple acquired NeXT, and with it, the Objective-C language and development frameworks. Objective-C then became the primary language for developing software for the Macintosh, iOS, and macOS. Since then, it has been widely used by millions of developers to build a wide range of applications, from games to productivity tools and everything in between.\n\nAlong Came Swift\n\nHowever, in 2014, Apple introduced Swift, a new programming language which was intended to replace Objective-C as the primary language for iOS and macOS development. Swift was designed to be more secure and easier to learn and use than Objective-C. Swift addresses some of the limitations and complexities of Objective-C including improved readability, safety, modernity, performance, and interoperability.\n\nSwift was designed with safety in mind and it introduced several new features such as optionals, automatic reference counting, and type inference. It's a more modern and expressive language than Objective-C and it's designed to work seamlessly with Cocoa Touch and Cocoa frameworks, which are key development frameworks for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS.\n\nSwift evolution, a process of improving the language, has been ongoing since its release, with new versions of Swift being released regularly, introducing new features and improvements to the language. With the release of Swift 5.7.2 in December 2022, the language has continued to evolve and improve, making it more powerful and versatile than ever before."
