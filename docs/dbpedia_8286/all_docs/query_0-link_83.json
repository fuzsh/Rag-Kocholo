I have a problem importing a csv file which contains roughtly 100,000 records (approximately 34MB) into my database via the Import function in phpMyAdmin.\n\nI have changed the max_execution_time value from 30 to 600 (seconds) in the php.ini file in the C:\\xampp\\php directory.\n\nI’ve also changed the $cfg[‘ExecTimeLimit’] value from 300 to 0 in the config.default.php in the C:\\xampp\\phpMyAdmin\\libraries directory.\n\nI’ve also tried reducign the file down to 25,000 records but still get errors:\n\nWarning in .\\libraries\\dbi\\DBIMysqli.class.php#258\n\nmysqli_query(): MySQL server has gone away\n\nWarning in .\\libraries\\dbi\\DBIMysqli.class.php#258 mysqli_query(): MySQL server has gone away Backtrace .\\libraries\\dbi\\DBIMysqli.class.php#258: mysqli_query( object, string , integer 0, ) .\\libraries\\DatabaseInterface.class.php#183: PMA_DBI_Mysqli->realQuery( string , object, integer 0, ) .\\libraries\\import.lib.php#170: PMA_DatabaseInterface->tryQuery(string ) .\\libraries\\plugins\\import\\ImportCsv.class.php#622: PMA_importRunQuery() .\\import.php#599: ImportCsv->doImport(array)\n\nCan anyone please help?\n\n(Ideally, I need to automate the import so that it runs on a daily basis at a specific time but, for now, I’m just trying to get the data imported. I’d also be happy with importing it via PHP by clicking a button on a web page)\n\nThe phpMyAdmin import routine is limited in some way. I can’t remember what the limiting factor is though. I suspect the 34Mb file is over the limit for file upload size though. This limit is likely set under the xampp config somewhere.\n\nDoes the import need to be done through a web interface? Have a look at MySQL Workbench ( https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/ ) or even MySQL command-line routines (I believe phpMyAdmin simply calls the command-line routines internally!)"
