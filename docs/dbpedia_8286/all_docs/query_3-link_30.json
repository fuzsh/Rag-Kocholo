        "text": "Here is a rundown of the Swift vs Objective-C programming language contest, and how they stack up against each other:\n\nObjective-C Programming Language\n\nObjective-C is an object-oriented programming language used by NeXT Computer Inc., a company founded by Steve Jobs in the 90s. It utilizes two languages, C and Smalltalk. This coding language uses the object syntax of Smalltalk and non-object-oriented operations from C. It\\â€™s popular for its maturity because it has been tried and tested for decades.\n\nIf you use Objective-C to develop an OS X or iOS application, you will most likely need the Xcode IDE. Xcode integrates with Cocoa Touch, the framework you need for iOS mobile application development. Objective C can work with other environments, such as AppCode or Visual Studio Code, but needs Xcode underneath to work properly.\n\nSwift\n\nSwift is a fairly new language, developed and released by Apple in 2014. It is the latest coding language used in app development. It is totally compatible with Objective-C in developing Cocoa Touch. As a developer, you can create mixed-language apps by alternating between Swift and Objective-C. Swift has almost all the advantages of Objective-C plus a lot more room for development.\n\nSwift vs Objective-C Programming Language: Similarities\n\nBoth Swift and Objective-C can be used to develop applications for macOS, iOS, tvOS, watch OS, and CarPlay. They both have the corresponding app programming interfaces (APIs) and frameworks (Cocoa, Cocoa Touch).\n\nSwift vs. Objective-C Programming Languages: Differences\n\nIn the differences, we shall highlight the features of each so that you get all the information you need.\n\nSwift programming language runs faster than Objective-C and almost as fast as C++. It is also easier to read and learn because of its light syntax. This also means that Swift requires less code. If you are well versed with C#, C++, JavaScript, Java, or Python, then learning Swift will be a breeze for you. In contrast, Objective-C has long syntax and is a very bulky language to write, making it harder to study than Swift.\n\nObjective-C programming language has been tried and tested for a longer time than Swift, and more stable and mature. Since Swift is still developing, it needs regular updates while Objective-C requires no more development. It is also more reliable and has a lot of great third-party frameworks.\n\nObjective-C works well with C++ and is easier to connect with private APIs. On the other hand, Swift is incompatible with C++ and is somewhat unstable with private APIs because it is constantly developing.\n\nSince Objective-C is older than Swift, it is harder to find an iOS app developer well versed in it. There are lots of software programmers proficient in Swift today, but not many know how to use Objective-C."
