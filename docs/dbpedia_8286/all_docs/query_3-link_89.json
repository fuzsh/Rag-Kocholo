        "text": "Last Updated : 07 Feb, 2023\n\nImprove\n\n1. Swift : Swift is a general-purpose, compiled, high-level programming language which is designed by Apple in 2014. It was developed by Chris Lattner with eventual collaboration with other programmers at Apple. It has object-oriented features of Objective-C and has similar syntax. Swift is intended to be used primarily for iOS and macOS development, it also can be used for Linux development. Swift handles some programming obstacles faced when using Objective C such as:\n\nIt prevents integers from overflowing their allotted memory.\n\nIt automatically manages memory.\n\nIt initializes variables before obstacles are in used.\n\nIt is optimized for Apple hardware so, it can performed better than other language.\n\nPros of Swift :\n\nIn 2018 swift was in 14th ranked among the most popular programming languages.\n\nAs the performance of swift, it is 2.6x faster than Objective C and 8.4x faster than python.\n\nIt got an encouraging syntax that make you write clean and consistent code.\n\nIt provides improve readability and prevent errors.\n\nCons of Swift :\n\nThe cons in swift was it can only be used to develop application that targets iOS7 or later.\n\nSwift may be the fastest language in the era but still it is still so young and need to be fix some issues.\n\nThis language got limited talent pool.\n\nIn swift, there is a lot lack of support for earlier iOS version.\n\n2. Objective C : Objective C is an general purpose, object-oriented programming language. It was developed by Brad Cox and Tom Love at their company Stepstone. Where C is a Procedural Oriented Language, Objective C adds syntax and semantics that allows for an object oriented language. This is also called as Obj C in programming language. It is a type of programming language that used in the OS X and iOS OS and their APIs. Originally it developed by Brad Cox and Tom Love at their company Stepstone in 1980s. Objective C adds to a new language features in C Programming language. ‘.m’ source code is the extensions used for Objective C.\n\nPros of Objective C :\n\nAs the language was implemented on existing C compilers as a pre processor a GCC module.\n\nObjective C is more compatible with C++.\n\nObjective C is more stable.\n\nIn Objective C, the usages of private APIs is easier.\n\nCons of Objective C :\n\nAs a cons Objective C does not supports operator overloading like C++.\n\nThe first version of Objective C does not supports garbage collection, but still it uses a little runtime written in C which added to the size of the application.\n\nSince it was based on C Compilers, it is dependent on a header file to work well.\n\nThe language Objective C is a little complex but this is expected as a fairly old language.\n\nDifference between Swift and Objective C :\n\nPlease Login to comment...\n\nArticle Tags :\n\nDifference Between\n\nProgramming Language"
