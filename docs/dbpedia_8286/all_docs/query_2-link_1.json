        "text": "MySQL Workbench is a visual tool developed by Oracle, which helps to administer MySQL Databases. It is known for being a cross-platform software that allows MySQL to run on many platforms such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.\n\nWhat is MySQL?\n\nMySQL is an open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) developed by Oracle Corporation, Sun Microsystems, that uses Structured Query language(SQL) to interact with databases. You can use MySQL to store, retrieve, manipulate and process data that is in the form of tables.\n\nWhy Use MySQL?\n\nThere are various relational database management systems present in the tech world today, such as Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, Oracle, DB2, etc.\n\nHere are some reasons why people use MySQL over other Database Management Systems.Â\n\nMultiple Storage Engines\n\nMySQL adheres to multiple storage engines, and each one of the storage engines possesses unique features, while other databases like SQL Server only support a single storage engine.Â Â\n\nInnoDB: It is the default storage engine fabricated with MySQL since version 5.5. It supports ACID-based transactions.\n\nMyISAM: Former to version 5.5, MyISAM was the default storage engine used by MySQL. It does not support ACID-based transactions.\n\nHigh Performance\n\nMySQL has reported high performance compared to other database management systems because of its simplicity in design, and adherence to multiple storage engines.\n\nCost-Effective\n\nThe community edition of MySQL is free of cost, and the commercial edition has a licensing fee, which is cost-effective compared to other products available in the market.\n\nCross-Platform\n\nMySQL runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS because of its cross-platform property.\n\nWith this, it is clear why MySQL is used. Now, you will see what MySQL Workbench exactly is and how one can use it.Â Â\n\nWhat is MySQL Workbench?\n\nMySQL Workbench is a unified cross-platform, open-source relational database design tool that adds functionality and ease to MySQL and SQL development work. MySQL Workbench provides data modeling, SQL development, and various administration tools for configuration. It also offers a graphical interface to work with the databases in a structured way.\n\nYou can create a Graphical Model using MySQL Workbench\n\nMySQL Workbench provides reverse engineering for live databases to models\n\nMySQL Workbench offers a forward engineering model to a script/live database\n\nMySQL Workbench - Modeling and Designing Tool\n\nMySQL Workbench possesses tools that allow database administrators to virtually create physical database design models that can be easily transitioned into MySQL databases using forward engineering.\n\nMySQL Workbench adheres to all objects such as tables, views, stored procedures, triggers, etc.\n\nMySQL Workbench also creates models from a target database or even imported SQL files.\n\nMySQL Workbench - SQL Development Tool\n\nMySQL Workbench comes with a visual SQL editor.\n\nThe Visual SQL editor gives developers the access to build, edit, and run queries against MySQL server databases. It has utilities for viewing data and exporting it.\n\nMySQL Workbench has auto-complete and color highlighters that aid in the writing and debugging of SQL statements, easily.\n\nMultiple queries can be run at a time, and the result is automatically displayed.\n\nIt also saves the queries in the history panel for previewing and running it later on.\n\nMySQL Workbench - SQL Administration Tool\n\nMySQL Workbench makes user management much easier.\n\nYou can view the account information of all users on the MySQL server\n\nMySQL Workbench gives access to add and remove users\n\nMySQL Workbench grants and revokes privileges\n\nYou can modify global and database permissions on the MySQL server\n\nYou can change passwords using MySQL\n\nYou can audit to see who did what and when on the server\n\nHow to Install MySQL Workbench?\n\nMoving on, you will look at how to install MySQL Workbench on Windows. The installation process is similar to other operating systems.\n\nOpen the MySQL website on a browser. Click on the following link: MySQL Downloads.\n\nSelect the Downloads option.\n\nSelect MySQL Installer for Windows.\n\nChoose the desired installer and click on download.\n\nAfter it downloads the installer, open it.\n\nIt will ask for permission; when it does, click Yes. The installer will then open. Now, it will ask to choose the setup type, here, select Custom.\n\nClick on Next. With this, you will be able to install MySQL server, MySQL Workbench, and MySQL shell.\n\nOpen MySQL Servers, select the server you want to install, and move it to theÂ Products/Features to be installed window section. Now, expand Applications, choose MySQL Workbench and MySQL shell. Move both of them to âProducts/Features to be installedâ.\n\nClick on the Next button. Now, click on the Execute button to download and install the MySQL server, MySQL Workbench, and the MySQL shell.\n\nOnce the product is ready to configure, click on Next. Under Type and Networking, go with the default settings and select Next.\n\nFor authentication, use the recommended strong password encryption.\n\nSet your MySQL Root password and click on next.\n\nGo for the default windows service settings and under apply configuration, click on execute. Once the configuration is complete, click on finish.\n\nComplete the installation. This will now launch the MySQL Workbench and the MySQL Shell.\n\nOnce MySQL Workbench is installed, select the Local instance and enter the password.\n\nNow, you can use the MySQL query tab to write your SQL queries.Â\n\nCheck the databases that are present in MySQL using the following command:\n\nShow Databases;\n\nIn the result grid, you can see the list of databases that are already present.\n\nTo choose a database and display the tables in the database, execute the below queries:Â\n\nUse sql_intro;\n\nShow Tables;\n\nHere, you must are select the sql_intro database and display the tables that are present in it.\n\nDisplay the records present in the products table.\n\nSelect * from products;\n\nConclusion\n\nMySQL Workbench is widely used to handle structured data. In this tutorial, you learned the steps to install MySQL Workbench on Windows. You also explored a few commands on the query editor.Â\n\nIf you are looking to enhance your software development skills, we highly recommend you to check Simplilearn's SQL Certification Course.
