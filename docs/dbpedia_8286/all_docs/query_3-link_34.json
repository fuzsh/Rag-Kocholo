They are responsible for developing code that integrates into the operating systems, embedded systems, high-level languages or low-level libraries, and so on. They are well trained with iOS frameworks such as Cora data, core animation, etc.\n\nObjective C Developer ensures the performance and quality of an application.\n\nThey are responsible for identifying and correcting bottlenecks and fix bugs.\n\nThey are responsible for maintaining code quality, organization, and automatization.\n\nThey are responsible for analysis, design, and implementation.\n\nThey are responsible for creating high-level designs.\n\nHere are the skills that needed to be an objective c developer. Let's have a look:\n\nStrong command on a programming language: Just like a chef should know how to cook, you need to know about C programming language if you really want to be an objective C Developer. The most important task of an objective developer is to have a strong command over the C programming language as it is the primary language that Apple uses for its app development.\n\nExcellent problems solving skills: An objective C Developer must have unique problem-solving skills so, that they can find out any type of technical issues. They must have the creativity and analytical abilities to identify any types of technical problems related to apps. The Objective C developer needs to have skills in analyzing bugs and fixing the technical glitches in the app."
