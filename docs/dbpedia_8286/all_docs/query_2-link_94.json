        "text": "Sadly, you can't find these in the Ubuntu Software Centre in later versions of Ubuntu any more. This is because these two pieces of software have reached their end-of-life, and are no longer supported.\n\nMySQL Workbench is probably the most complete tool, but a bit sluggish according to me.\n\nI prefer \"MySQL Query browser\" and \"MySQL Administrator\". These two can do all basic stuff, and are very user friendly.\n\nI like Emma. Emma is an open source project that isn't developed by Oracle.\n\nEmma is available from the Ubuntu repositories in older versions of Ubuntu. Run:\n\nsudo apt install emma\n\nIn newer versions of Ubuntu, Emma is no longer available in the Ubuntu repositories. See this question.\n\nI know the answer is already accepted but I felt I should add SQLYog to this list anyway since it is such a powerful tool... There is no official build available for Linux but it works quite well on Wine.\n\nI use Adminer. It's very lightweight and with a clear web interface. It's an alternative to phpMyAdmin.\n\nhttps://www.adminer.org\n\nIt can be installed like this:\n\nsudo apt-get install adminer sudo a2enconf adminer sudo systemctl reload apache2\n\nThen open http://localhost/adminer\n\nBut if you want newer versions you should install manually:\n\nhttps://www.vultr.com/docs/install-adminer-on-debian-ubuntu\n\nI'm definitely late to answer here, but a friend and I were fed up of the overcomplicated Java Swing apps, so we built our own open source SQL editor & Database manager. It's 100% Open source - GPLv3 licensed.\n\nWorks great on Linux (I'm a Linux user), Windows, and MacOS, and we support loads of databases.\n\nIt's really modern compared to many of those listed here, but doesn't have as many advanced features, so it is not as well suited for DBAs, but it's GREAT for regular developers.\n\nFull version: Beekeeper Studio\n\nOpen Source version: GitHub\n\nAt the time of editing (May 2024), Beekeeper Studio has over 1.25 million downloads, and 15,000 GitHub stars, so it's a mature and well-liked app!\n\nHope someone else likes using it as much as I do!\n\nI solved this problem with the following method (I used to install quanta+ 3.5 in ubuntu 12.04. In the same repositories you can find mysql gui tools):\n\nThe tutorial is in this blog article.\n\nFollow the tutorial, and replace:\n\nsudo apt-get install quanta\n\nwith:\n\nsudo apt-get install mysql-query-browser mysql-admin\n\nbut maybe it is mysql-gui-tools, but i'm not sure.\n\nOne possibility is using SQLExplorer, either as an Eclipse plugin or a standalone \"RCP\" application. I use it as a plugin, but you can download a Linux standalone version, too. To start the standalone version extract it and execute the sqlexplorer file.\n\nIt's being actively developed (last version was in April 2013) and for many people IDE integration is a plus."
