        "text": "Ahead of Postgres and SQLite, MySQL has been the leading relational database for years. This is corroborated most recently by Stack Overflow’s 2021 Developer Survey, in which 50.18 percent of all respondents (73,317) claim to have used MySQL extensively and plan to do so in the coming year.\n\nMySQL Shell might feel unapproachable, and even its fundamental components like MySQL Workbench or MySQL Connectors don’t appeal to everyone. Some may not even require every advanced feature under the database’s umbrella. Thankfully, the third-party tooling market has grown substantially throughout MySQL’s twenty-six-year history.\n\nThis assessment is meant to be as objective as possible, with added comments that you might find helpful. Here are the top five picks.\n\nPerhaps one of the more no-nonsense members on this list (in stock form), Adminer aims to provide powerful functionality within a simplified package. Launched in 2007, the tool prioritizes security, performance, and size. You can select your preferred look from over twenty-five included themes—sourced by Adminer’s developers, with others contributed by community members.\n\nThe tool promises robust database management using a single PHP file. This makes it relatively easy to set Adminer up on any machine with PHP. Learn how to set up PHP on your computer with this guide.\n\nYou can install optional MySQL database servers either locally or remotely. This second option lets you tap into a remote machine as needed, saving space on your physical drive. Accordingly, it may be advantageous to install any database extensions for MySQL that you cannot live without. This is great preparation for the remaining steps.\n\nFinally, download the latest Adminer PHP file directly from Adminer’s website. Any associated plugins you’ll want to add are hosted and documented on this website and on Adminer’s GitHub page. Getting started is as easy as logging into your essential databases.\n\nAmong other features, Adminer allows plenty of table manipulations—especially those involving listing, indexing, altering, creating, dropping, and adding records or indexes. You can execute any SQL command using text fields and files. It’s also possible to create new databases, export data structures, kill processes, and display users alongside their rights. Adminer allows all of this while encouraging you to harness your preferred data type.\n\nThe makers of Adminer highlight two seemingly paradoxical benefits: its simplicity and its customizability. But customization isn’t necessary to get the most out of the GUI. It’s available for power users, while the base package remains usable to novices.\n\nThat said, flexibility is a major strength of Adminer. It allows experienced developers to stretch their capabilities with plugins, extensions, and other APIs. It’s great for those with solid knowledge of PHP and avoids the one-size-fits-all pitfalls of other applications. Finally, the toolset is welcoming to newcomers thanks to liberal inclusion of text fields, drop-downs, toggles, checklists, and radio buttons.\n\nDecidedly the junior compared to something like Adminer, Beekeeper Studio first launched in early 2020 as a modern approach to MySQL database management. This is reflected in its aesthetic, which mirrors that of other GUI-centric applications in the past five years. The interface and editor come with numerous content views, most of which are information-rich and well-organized. Development has also been steady, with forty-one releases in the past year and a half (at the time of writing).\n\nBeekeeper highlights a host of key features on its homepage. Security is highly important, given that SSL encryption is standard for all database connections. Beekeeper will hold onto your password for safekeeping. It also helps you connect through firewalls via specific ports.\n\nBeekeeper Studio supports SQL autocompletion through the built-in editor, which provides dev-friendly features like syntax highlighting and pop-up suggestions. This makes it much easier and less tedious to fly through numerous SQL queries. Beekeeper also provides the following:\n\nBeekeeper also supports multiple run contexts. It’s possible to run all queries by default, run the current highlighted query, or run selected queries only. Once data is retrieved and arranged in a table, you can filter, sort, and peruse this information however you wish. Beekeeper also supports a number of default keyboard shortcuts.\n\nBeekeeper Studio is designed to work with several DBs, like Postgres, SQLite, and SQL Server. It’s not built solely for MySQL and is therefore better suited for day-to-day data lookup and manipulation, as opposed to intensive or detailed projects. Compared to something like Adminer, Beekeeper supports a smaller array of MySQL-specific features, which you might miss.\n\nThe editor is the star of the show here. It’s attractive, easy to work with, and relatively powerful. If you’re looking to bang out numerous lines of SQL queries, you’ll feel right at home within the app.\n\nReleased around the same time as Beekeeper Studio, CloudBeaver is a smaller, open-source project supported by a stable of thirteen contributors. Because of this, development schedules are a little more deliberate, but that hasn’t stopped CloudBeaver from fine-tuning its lightweight, user-friendly GUI. The interface is clean and has both dark and light modes. CloudBeaver also presents users with informative visualizations, keeping you engaged and organized as databases scale. Being a web application, this tool is accessible to a larger subset of users without consuming too many resources or disk space.\n\nCloudBeaver comes in three flavors. First is the web application, which leverages a web server and JavaScript frontend. While this method is accessible, CloudBeaver warns that the setup process can be somewhat complex.\n\nThe final version is CloudBeaver Enterprise. The development team has made a Docker container specifically for this purpose, or you can secure an AWS-compatible version within the AWS Marketplace. The application is predominantly built using TypeScript and Java.\n\nScanning these custom categories and arranging data in a sensible format is doable in a snap. Both relational and document-oriented databases are supported. Quickly view values for all data types, read from tables regardless of length, use the dedicated data-filter panel, or even order tables based on column numbers.\n\nFor export, CloudBeaver supports CSV, XLSX, XML, JSON, and SQL INSERTs formats. Entity diagrams offer more interesting features. Should you want to visualize your entire database schema, Beaver will provide a flowchart-style diagram with labels and categorized data points. Unique keys, foreign keys, and automatic layouts are supported by default. You can even export this visualization as a PNG or SVG file for safekeeping.\n\nYou can integrate CloudBeaver with your AWS account to unlock authorized browsing of AWS databases using AWS credentials and RDS authentication. This type of process relies either on Kerberos or Active Directory, and thus allows you to clamp down on unintended access. You also have compatibility with Docker environments and the ability to serve local or remote databases.\n\nA stalwart in the database management space, phpMyAdmin launched in 1998 and has since enjoyed voracious support. GitHub has recorded 469 releases since launch—an ambitious schedule made possible by over 1,100 contributors. It’s written mainly in PHP.\n\nphpMyAdmin has had plenty of time to develop a list of highly requested features. Administrators and architects can trust it to handle tasks ranging from menial to intricate.\n\nMySQL Workbench was launched in 2015 as a visualization tool for database architects, developers, and DBAs. It’s a full-fledged suite that allows you to data model, develop SQL, and administer everything around your databases. It’s written mainly in C++ and has twenty-five releases stored on GitHub.\n\nMySQL Workbench is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux distributions. It’s designed to work best with (yet doesn’t require) a MySQL server connection, along with simultaneous client connections.\n\nMySQL Workbench can be installed via the command line. However, there are unique installation pathways for each OS.\n\nMySQL Workbench is primarily a GUI-centric tool and thus ditches the scripting interfaces found elsewhere. Designed to work with MySQL Server 5.6+, it offers the following:\n\nLike phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench is made for both novices and experts. As the native database management option for MySQL, the tool excels at supporting the database technology without major hiccups. It’s perfect for those hoping to keep everything under one proverbial roof.\n\nAs you can see, there are plenty of exceptional (and approachable) MySQL GUIs on the market. No tool is perfect, but your needs and preferences will help determine which is ideal for you.\n\nIf you need to extend beyond basic database administration and build more robust frontend apps on top of your data, Retool might be a good choice for you. At Retool, we make it easy to build apps on top of your MySQL database data. We've built a clean, organized GUI that enables you to quickly view, edit, and analyze information whether you prefer lists, tables, or richer visualizations. What's more, you can share your apps across your organization, integrate with other APIs and database types, and customize your interface with code whenever you need to."
