MySQL Workbench is a visual tool developed by Oracle, which helps to administer MySQL Databases. It is known for being a cross-platform software that allows MySQL to run on many platforms such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.

What is MySQL?

MySQL is an open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) developed by Oracle Corporation, Sun Microsystems, that uses Structured Query language(SQL) to interact with databases. You can use MySQL to store, retrieve, manipulate and process data that is in the form of tables.

Why Use MySQL?

There are various relational database management systems present in the tech world today, such as Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, Oracle, DB2, etc.

Here are some reasons why people use MySQL over other Database Management Systems.Â

Multiple Storage Engines

MySQL adheres to multiple storage engines, and each one of the storage engines possesses unique features, while other databases like SQL Server only support a single storage engine.Â Â

InnoDB: It is the default storage engine fabricated with MySQL since version 5.5. It supports ACID-based transactions.

MyISAM: Former to version 5.5, MyISAM was the default storage engine used by MySQL. It does not support ACID-based transactions.

High Performance

MySQL has reported high performance compared to other database management systems because of its simplicity in design, and adherence to multiple storage engines.

Cost-Effective

The community edition of MySQL is free of cost, and the commercial edition has a licensing fee, which is cost-effective compared to other products available in the market.

Cross-Platform

MySQL runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS because of its cross-platform property.

With this, it is clear why MySQL is used. Now, you will see what MySQL Workbench exactly is and how one can use it.Â Â

What is MySQL Workbench?

MySQL Workbench is a unified cross-platform, open-source relational database design tool that adds functionality and ease to MySQL and SQL development work. MySQL Workbench provides data modeling, SQL development, and various administration tools for configuration. It also offers a graphical interface to work with the databases in a structured way.

You can create a Graphical Model using MySQL Workbench

MySQL Workbench provides reverse engineering for live databases to models

MySQL Workbench offers a forward engineering model to a script/live database

MySQL Workbench - Modeling and Designing Tool

MySQL Workbench possesses tools that allow database administrators to virtually create physical database design models that can be easily transitioned into MySQL databases using forward engineering.

MySQL Workbench adheres to all objects such as tables, views, stored procedures, triggers, etc.

MySQL Workbench also creates models from a target database or even imported SQL files.

MySQL Workbench - SQL Development Tool

MySQL Workbench comes with a visual SQL editor.

The Visual SQL editor gives developers the access to build, edit, and run queries against MySQL server databases. It has utilities for viewing data and exporting it.

MySQL Workbench has auto-complete and color highlighters that aid in the writing and debugging of SQL statements, easily.

Multiple queries can be run at a time, and the result is automatically displayed.

It also saves the queries in the history panel for previewing and running it later on.

Show Tables;

Here, you must are select the sql_intro database and display the tables that are present in it.

Display the records present in the products table.

Select * from products;
