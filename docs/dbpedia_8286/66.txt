MySQL Workbench is development, administration and data modeling tool for MySQL. Besides editing and running SQL queries and scripts, it supports the design of MySQL databases through a EER diagram, which is then used to generate SQL scripts. Workbench also supports migration from many RDBMS products to MySQL.

# Connections

If you use connections, Workbench use Password Manager and ssh to work properly.

So it is necessary to give this permission explicitly.

``` snap connect mysql-workbench-community:password-manager-service ```

``` snap connect mysql-workbench-community:ssh-keys ```

Or if you use files on external disks or need to print files, too.

``` snap connect mysql-workbench-community:cups-control ```

``` snap connect mysql-workbench-community:removable-media ```
