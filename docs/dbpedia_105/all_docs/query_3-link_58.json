        "text": "Parents whose children have previously attended public school lined up for hours to register their children for a Catholic high school in Brampton.\n\nThe 85 available spaces at Cardinal Ambrozic Catholic Secondary School went quickly, and 50 more names were placed on the waiting list.\n\nParents spend a cold Tuesday night outside waiting for Wednesday’s registration to begin, and that’s not unusual, Bruce E. Campbell, a spokesman for the Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board, told CityNews on Tuesday.\n\nIn the past, parents have begun lining up as early as 3 a.m. This year, the lineup began the night before. The lineups happen every year and it also happens at other schools.\n\nThe students must live in the catchment area of Cardinal Ambrozic. The school gives priority to Grade 9 students from the Catholic elementary feeder schools. After that, there are approximately 85 spaces available for open access students or those looking to attend from other school boards, Campbell said.\n\nAll 85 spaces were filled. Enrolment is capped at 320 students per grade.\n\nCampbell said that there is a perception that the school “is a good place to learn, is very safe, maintains good discipline, and performs well. Also, parents have commented on ‘liking’ uniforms.”\n\nClick here to see more requirements for registration.\n\nThe waitlist process, sent home with parents after registration, can be seen below."
