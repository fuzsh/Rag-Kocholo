He was man of intense dedication to his vocation and during his 56 years as a priest he was honoured for his service by being named a Cardinal by Pope John Paul II.“From start to finish he was a good and faithful servant and a humble man,” said Archbishop Thomas Collins, who took Cardinal Ambrozic’s place in 2006. “That is incredibly noble. His steady devotion was exemplary and the effect of that on others lasts over time.”\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS\n\nEnjoy the latest local, national and international news.\n\nExclusive articles by Conrad Black, Barbara Kay and others.

In May 1945, the entire family fled to Austria, living in several refugee camps. After completing high school in Austria his family came to Canada in 1948.\n\nHe entered St. Augustine’s Seminary in Toronto a short time later.\n\nAfter almost 21 years as a diocesan priest, Fr. Ambrozic was named an Auxiliary Bishop for the Archdiocese of Toronto in 1976. Bishop Ambrozic served alongside Archbishop Philip Pocock and Cardinal Emmett Carter, before his appointment as Archbishop of Toronto on March 17, 1990. He was named Cardinal eight years later.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nHe spent 16 years as the city’s Archbishop. Under Church law, he had to retire his position in 2006 when he turned 75.\n\nArchbishop Collins said that Cardinal Ambrozic was also known in academic circles as a great Biblical scholar. The Cardinal’s book on the Gospel of Mark, The Hidden Kingdom, is considered one of the classics in the field, he said.\n\nBut he noted the most remarkable thing about Cardinal Ambrozic was not his involvement with spectacular events but in remaining a man of such steady faith for so many years.\n\n“That’s the heart of it. Just to be a steady and devoted in his mission as a priest and as a bishop. It is really important for priests to know their bishop is faithfully serving the Lord. That faithful service is what we saw in Cardinal Ambrozic.”\n\nNational Post\n\n• Email: clewis@nationalpost.com | Twitter: holycharlie\n\nThe Cardinal will lie in state at St. Michael’s Cathedral for a public viewing, dates and times to be determined. His funeral Mass will also take place at the Cathedral.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest from Shopping Essentials"
