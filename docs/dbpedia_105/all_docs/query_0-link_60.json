        "text": "Best Schools in Brampton\n\nWe get a lot of questions as to what are the best schools in Brampton. How are they ranked? Which schools are the best? And which schools are to be avoided?\n\nFortunately, today there are a number of organizations which provide rating information. This can help parents to determine the academic performance of their children’s schools.\n\nThree of the most frequently asked questions that we get are:\n\nQ: What is the best high school in Brampton?\n\nA: Khalsa Community School is the top high school in Brampton, scoring an amazing perfect 10.0 on the Fraser Institute ranking score.\n\nQ: What is the best elementary school in Brampton?\n\nA: Khalsa Community School also offers elementary schooling, and it has also scored a perfect 10 here on the Fraser Institute rankings. Next is Our Lady of Lourdes Separate School with an 8.3 score, and St. Ursula Separate School with 8.1\n\nQ: Does Brampton have French immersion schools?\n\nA: Yes, Brampton has plenty of excellent French immersion schools\n\nFraser Institute Rating System\n\nThe Fraser Institute is a leading source for school rankings in Canada. They are an independent international research and educational organization, headquartered in Vancouver, B.C.\n\nThey use a specific set of measurements to gauge elementary, middle, and high school academic performance for Brampton, and many other parts of Canada.\n\nThe Fraser Institute compilation of Ontario School rankings provides specific data on how students in various schools rate against each other, using defined and specific methodologies.\n\nTheir “Report Card” was last updated for high schools in May, 2024, and for elementary schools in early 2024.\n\nTesting was put on pause during 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and has been slow to return.\n\nIt ranks all participating schools in Ontario based on results using standardized tests in the Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO).\n\nTest results are ranked within a range up to a perfect score of 10, and these results are then compared to previous years’ scores as well as previous years’ rankings.\n\nSchools are then given a numeric rank based upon their students’ test scores.\n\nControversy\n\nMany educators are quick to point out that an academic test such as used by the Fraser Institute is only one measure of school performance.\n\nPeter Cowley, co-author of the report, has acknowledged that these test scores are only one method of measurement in trying to determine any school’s effectiveness.\n\n“On the other hand, this report card says nothing about fine arts, athletics, french immersion, or how schools develop leadership and citizenship among their students. This will tell parents how students are doing in areas of basic skills in which the province tests them.”\n\nThe Brampton school rankings also allow parents to monitor any significant trends for increases or decreases in the test scores, Cowley said.\n\nAccordingly, despite the caveat from many observers that the Report is only a single measure of any school’s effectiveness, parents can nevertheless gain some insight as to the academic credentials of Brampton’s schools, and how they measure up against each other.\n\nLooking for a Home in a Specific School District?\n\nBrampton High School Rankings\n\n** Partial Update 2024 **\n\nWe initially published Brampton high school rankings based on the 2018-2019 test results. Results for 2021-2022 were finally released in May, 2024, but are unfortunately missing data from the Peel District School Board. While almost every Catholic high school is included in the new rankings, public high schools are not.\n\nThere are several independent schools that are also missing from this year’s results.\n\nWe have attempted to update our chart with the latest data. Updated ranking scores for 2021-2022 are shown with two asterisks (**). Those without an asterisk are from 2018-2019.\n\nSchools’ numeric rankings within the province are also incomplete. Updated provincial rankings for 2021-2022 are shown with two asterisks(**). Those without an asterisk are from 2018-2019.\n\nProvincial rankings are a scorecard from a list of participating schools in Ontario. The total number of participating high schools in 2018-2019 was 739. In 2021-2022, that number was reduced to 685.\n\nChart Example:\n\nHarold M. Brathwaite Secondary School with a score of 8.2, and a provincial rank of 42 is from 2018/2019\n\nHoly Name of Mary Catholic Secondary School with a score of 8.0 ** and a provincial rank of 66 ** is from 2021/2022\n\nFirst column on the left is the rank of each school compared to those public, catholic, and private secondary schools in the Province of Ontario who chose to participate in the survey.\n\nFrom this chart, you can see that Khalsa Community School, which is a private school serving the Sikh community, is the highest rated secondary school in Brampton.\n\nIt has been recognized as both the top high school in Brampton, as well as the top school academically in all of Ontario. coming in at first place out of all secondary schools in the entire province.\n\nCongratulations to the teachers, staff, and students of Khalsa Community School!\n\nRelated posts:\n\nBrampton vs Mississauga School Rankings\n\nBrampton vs Oakville School Rankings\n\nSpecialized Programs\n\nSHSM Specialist High Skills Major\n\nBest High Schools in Brampton\n\nProvincial RankSchoolRating 2018/19 + 2021/2022**2018/19 + 2021/2022** 1 **Khalsa Community School10.0 ** 52Harold M Brathwaite Secondary School8.1 66 **Holy Name of Mary Catholic Secondary School8.0 ** 130Chinguacousy Secondary School7.5 130North Park Secondary School7.5 209Castlebrooke Secondary School7.1 227 **St Edmund Campion Secondary School6.9 ** 244Fletcher's Meadow Secondary School6.9 244Louise Arbour Secondary School6.9 246 **Cardinal Ambrozic Catholic Secondary School6.8 ** 261Turner Fenton Secondary School6.8 281Brampton Centennial Secondary School6.7 260 **École secondaire Jeunes sans frontières6.7 ** 281Mayfield Secondary School6.7 288 **St. Roch Catholic Secondary School6.5 ** 305 **Notre Dame Catholic Secondary School6.4 ** 305 **Cardinal Leger Catholic Secondary School6.4 ** 341St. Marguerite d'Youville Secondary School6.2 ** 391Central Peel Secondary School6.2 406Sandalwood Heights Secondary School6.1 440David Suzuki Secondary School5.9 409 **St. Augustine Catholic Secondary School5.8 ** 484Heart Lake Secondary School5.6 480 **St. Thomas Aquinas Secondary School5.3 ** 520Bramalea Secondary School5.3 556Jean Augustine Secondary School5.0 733Judith Nyman Secondary School0.0\n\nBrampton Elementary School Rankings\n\n** updated 2024 **\n\nThere are more than 100 public, catholic, and private Brampton elementary and middle schools\n\nThe Fraser Institute’s most recent findings on Brampton elementary school rankings and middle school ratings were released in March, 2024, and are based on 2021/2022 grade 3 and grade 6 EQAO results.\n\nWhen test results between schools ended in a rating tie, school rank is shown as an equal rank (left column).\n\nSome schools are not listed due to not offering both grades 3 & 6.\n\nThe following list is a summary of Brampton elementary school rankings, including public and separate (Catholic), and independent school rankings.\n\nCertain school rankings are not available due to lack of participation in the EQAO tests. The exclusion of a school should in no way be construed as a judgement of the school’s effectiveness.\n\nThe top elementary school in Brampton has a perfect score of 10 in academics: Khalsa Community School.\n\nThe Khalsa Community School also scores among the top schools in the Greater Toronto area, and indeed, in all of Ontario. Academically, it is definitely among the best elementary schools in Brampton.\n\nProvincial RankSchoolRating 2021/222021/22 1Khalsa Community School10.0 231Our Lady of Lourdes8.3 321St Ursula 8.1 346Wali ul Asr School GTA West7.9 580St. Alphonsa7.5 580St Brigid School7.5 626McClure PS 7.4 690Castlemore Public School7.3 690Pauline Vanier7.3 746Eldorado PS (Elementary)7.2 746Ingleborough (Elementary)7.2 746Springbrook PS7.2 746ÉÉC Sainte-Jeanne-d'Arc7.2 797Lester B Pearson7.1 797Pte Buckam Singh PS7.1 797St Francis Xavier Elementary7.1 870Father Francis McSpiritt7.0 870Good Shepherd7.0 870Sir Isaac Brock PS 7.0 943Great Lakes Public School6.9 943St Angela Merici6.9 943St Joachim Separate School6.9 1013Malala Yousafzai PS6.8 1013Mountain Ash (Elementary)6.8 1013Our Lady of Peace School6.8 1094Mount Royal Public School6.7 1094Sacred Heart 6.7 1094St. John Henry Newman6.7 1094St Stephen Separate School6.7 1176Churchville Public School6.6 1176Our Lady of Providence6.6 1225Georges Vanier6.5 1225Ross Drive P.S. 6.5 1225Shaw Public School6.5 1225St Josephine Bakhita6.5 1225St Rita Elementary School6.5 1225Walnut Grove PS6.5 1303St Anne Separate School6.4 1303St. Jean-Marie Vianney6.4 1439Beryl Ford6.2 1439Lorenville P.S.
