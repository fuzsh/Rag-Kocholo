        "text": "DURING CNS PROTEST OF HILLARY CLINTON HONORS, MARYMOUNT MANHATTAN COLLEGE DECLARED NOT CATHOLIC\n\n(April 28, 2005)\n\nThe Archdiocese of New York has formally declared Marymount Manhattan College – which has been under protest by the Cardinal Newman Society for inviting pro-abortion Sen. Hillary Clinton to give its commencement address and receive an honorary degree on May 20 – no longer a Catholic institution. The College will no longer be listed in The Official Catholic Directory, which identifies institutions including Marymount Manhattan College that are formally recognized as Catholic.\n\nThis is the fourth time since Pope John Paul II issued Ex Corde Ecclesiae, the apostolic constitution on Catholic universities, that a bishop has declared an historically Catholic college or university to be not Catholic. The 1990 document gives local bishops the responsibility of determining whether colleges can bear the label “Catholic.” Catholic colleges established prior to 1990 are assumed to be Catholic and to conform sufficiently to the guidelines of Ex Corde Ecclesiae until a bishop declares otherwise.\n\nMarist College in Poughkeepsie, New York, was declared “no longer Catholic” by Cardinal Edward Egan of the Archdiocese of New York in 2003, during a similar protest by Cardinal Newman Society of the college’s commencement speaker, pro-abortion New York Attorney General Elliott Spitzer. CNS also protested Spitzer as the commencement speaker at Marymount Manhattan College last year, but no public action was taken by the Archdiocese and the College took no step to end its affiliation with the Catholic Church. Two other historically Catholic colleges in Rochester, New York – Nazareth College and Saint John Fisher College – have been declared no longer Catholic by Bishop Matthew Clark.\n\n“The decision to honor one of Congress’ most outspoken and strident advocates of abortion rights was just the latest episode in a long history of secularization at Marymount Manhattan College,” said Patrick J. Reilly, President of the Cardinal Newman Society (CNS), in a press release. CNS is a national organization dedicated to the renewal of Catholic identity at America’s 220 – now 219 – Catholic colleges and universities.\n\n“Why the College chose to remain officially Catholic while turning traitor against the Catholic Church, I cannot say,\" Reilly continued. \"This is a good day for those seeking truth and clarity, but at the same time a sad day for Catholics, who founded, attended and funded this college only to be turned away for the sake of government funding and private ambitions.”\n\nCNS wrote Cardinal Egan on April 14, complaining about Marymount Manhattan College’s plans to honor Sen. Clinton and suggesting “immediate action to prevent scandal in the Archdiocese of New York.” CNS asked Cardinal Egan to consider advising the College privately to withdraw Clinton’s invitation, but also acknowledged “that the enforcement of Ex Corde Ecclesiae may require the declaration that an institution is no longer Catholic, and we support such action if Marymount Manhattan College obstinately refuses to acknowledge your pastoral authority as bishop and to uphold the Church’s fundamental teachings.”\n\nAccording to the Archdiocese of New York, the College’s officials agreed with today’s action. Indeed, College employees had been rebuffing CNS protesters of the Clinton honors by claiming that Marymount Manhattan College has not been Catholic since 1961, when it separated from its parent institution, Marymount College of Tarrytown, and its founding women’s religious order, the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary. In fact, the College’s actions in 1961 were similar to those of most other Catholic institutions throughout the country that incorporated separate from the Church to qualify for state government funding. The vast majority of those colleges continue to claim a Catholic identity while slowly secularizing, and Marymount Manhattan College is not much different – any apparent trace of its Catholic identity has disappeared over time, even though until today it preserved its official status as Catholic, possibly to avoid alienating its Catholic alumni and donors. “There is tremendous value to clearly and formally identifying wayward Catholic institutions as no longer Catholic, as Cardinal Egan has done so courageously,” Reilly said. “If Senator Clinton had a similar degree of dignity, she might have declined the College’s honor out of respect for faithful Catholics who are appalled by her stridency on abortion and embryonic stem cell research. If the College’s trustees and officials had a similar degree of dignity, they might have chosen to respect the College’s roots and give their students something young people today are longing for – a moral education rooted in the truth about God and man.”\n\nOutstanding! Either be a Catholic college in more than name, or be cast out!\n\nMaranatha:\n\nThe questions now are:\n\n*]How many professors will resign?\n\n*]Do they have any religious working there anymore?\n\n*]Will alumni stop supporting the school?\n\nInteresting questions for all Catholic universities, especially the last one. Since I work at one, I can say for a fact that many of our alumni are very concerned that the school improve its Catholic image (although we aren’t nearly as bad as some), & since they contribute money their opinions carry weight. The religious order here does have a high profile on campus, although like every other one their numbers aren’t what they used to be, and aside from doing some silly things like encouraging hand-holding during the Our Father at mass they are really rather orthodox - especially the African priests that come from their missions. However, there is still a concern among alumni & the local diocese as well that the Catholic character of this place isn’t what it should be, but that seems to be symptomatic of most American Catholic schools. If I had to make an educated guess, I’d say that the wind is blowing in the direction of fidelity & orthodoxy.\n\nCan this be applied to Catholic high schools as well?\n\nfrom www.thelaity.org\n\nDear Laity,\n\nYesterday, Tuesday, February 17, 2004, Servite High School celebrated an all school Mass in observance of the feast of the Seven Holy Founders of the Servite order and in commemoration of the 45th anniversary of the founding of the school. Rev. Tod Brown, bishop of the Diocese of Orange, was the celebrant.\n\nAfter communion but before the final blessing of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, Bro. Joel Lechner, O.S.M, President of Servite High School, recognized many of the principals and presidents of Catholic schools who were in attendance. Included in the list of those recognized by Bro. Joel, and then applauded by the students and staff of the school and the many priests on the altar were: Fr. Gerald Horan O.S.M., past president of Servite High School and present Superintendent of Catholic Schools in the OC Diocese; Fr. Gabriel Stack O.Praem., principal of St. Michael’s Preparatory School (run by the Norbertine Fathers); Frances Clare, Principal of Mater Dei High School; Patrick Murphy, President of Mater Dei High School; and a few other principals of Catholic schools in OC. Then Bro. Joel recognized Loretta Sanchez, a staunchly pro-abortion, radical pro-gay rights member of the House of Representatives, 47th District, after which was the expected and received applause.\n\nIt is reprehensible that Loretta Sanchez was invited to attend this Mass. It is even more tragic that Bishop Brown was apparently complicit in her recognition.\n\nIf you are not yet aware of Ms. Sanchez’ voting record or method of public relations, you may download the few documents we have attached to this email. Ms. Sanchez claims openly to be Catholic, but consistently votes pro- abortion, including support for the horrific procedure commonly known as partial birth abortion. The documents attached include a front page of the OC Register article, July 9, 1998 with quotes from our Bishop McFarland and Msgr. Baird denouncing her activities; and copies of a March 2003 issue of Playboy Magazine, page 12 “A Night at the Haunted Mansion” with a photograph of Sanchez and pornography icon Hugh Hefner, standing with his arm around her at the ‘party’. This woman was recognized yesterday by the president of Servite High School and applauded by the 40 or so teachers in attendance and over 800 young male students whose consciences are still being formed.\n\nEdmund Burke (1729-1797), an Irish philosopher and statesman once said, “The\n\nonly thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”\n\nWe ask that you please contact the responsible parties listed below, today, to charitably yet firmly express your deep concern.\n\nWe also ask that you please forward this email and attachments to everyone on your lists so the voice of Catholics still faithful to the teachings of the magisterium will be heard throughout our diocese."
