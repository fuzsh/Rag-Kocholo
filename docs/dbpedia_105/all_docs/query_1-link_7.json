        "text": "Hello to all coaches, My name is Johannes Barnes. I am a right-footed 19 years old player. I am a Central Defensive Midfielder who can also play at either wing-back position. I am a person who has a desire and passion for soccer. Since I was a little child, I would spend hours watching highlights of the \"Invincibles\" Arsenal team. On and off the field, I am a hard worker and always look to better myself as an individual in society. I also enjoy leading and being the individual who motivates a team or a group of people to do well. I am also a people person who loves to socialize and get to know people. In terms of soccer, on the pitch, I am a hard worker and a team player who always looks to make the game simple rather than harder for myself and others. In the past, I am looking to play competitive soccer while also working towards a degree.\n\nThank you!"
