S E P T E M B E R 2 0 1 2 Welcome to Cardinal Ambrozic Catholic Secondary School and a special welcome to those who are new to our River Hawk Family. Cardinal Ambrozic is a “Culturally Proficient Catholic Professional Learning Community” committed to providing all our students with positive spiritual, academic and social experiences. We are blessed to be part of the Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board, Brampton North East Family of Schools, St. Patrick's and St. Marguerite D’Youville Parishes and the dynamic City of Brampton. Cardinal Ambrozic opened its doors September 8, 2009 and is home to just under 1300 diverse, full time grade 9-12 students and arguably the most innovative teaching faculty and support staff in the province. We are located in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. Cardinal Ambrozic is home to three programs: a traditional Academic/Applied/Locally Developed program, an Autism Spectrum Disorder program and a Planning for Independence Special Needs program. We also offer Secondary High School Major programs in “Non-Profit” (social justice) and “Sports Industry”. We have a dynamic and technologically focused facility which enhances the learning opportunities and skills for our 21 st century learners to thrive. It is our collective goal to consistently obtain provincial EQAO scores that rate among the top in the province and the City of Brampton. We refer to our commitment to student success as “River Hawks Soaring to Success”. This initiative is supported by providing our students with a Pyramid of Interventions that foster the dreams and inspirations of all students. Our unique timetable also cultivates and allows for student achievement through the use of targeted interventions. At Cardinal Ambrozic we offer a diverse co-curricular program. We believe opportunities for student engagement lead to improved student achievement levels. Therefore, we encourage our students to get involved in serious outreach experiences as well as the extracurricular and pastoral life of the school. Cardinal Ambrozic also encourages and provides opportunities for domestic and international travel experiences to promote global citizenship and stewardship. We strongly believe when students become connected to the school and community they become intrinsically motivated to be successful in school. Cardinal Ambrozic encourages all of our parents to be involved in their children’s education in some way. We have a strong Parent Council under the leadership of Chair Anna Aidoo, local pastors Rev.Papais and Rev.Day, trustee Mr. Scott McLauchlan and our Superintendent Max Vecchiarino who are also sources of essential support and direction. We believe as a Cardinal Ambrozic community, it is a privilege that parents have entrusted us to educate their children in a Catholic School culture. We are very excited this year because on June 25, 2013, we will host our first Graduation Ceremony at the Brampton Powerade Centre. Upcoming Events!
