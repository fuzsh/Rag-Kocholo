        "text": "A Brampton high school posted a picture of their new principal on Twitter, but there was a huge backlash when people saw a certain book sitting on her desk.\n\nThe book is titled “The Guide for White Women Who Teach Black Boys.”\n\nThe Dufferin-Peel Catholic School Board is defending the principal at Cardinal Ambrozic Catholic Secondary School, saying although the book has a provocative title, it’s actually helpful when it comes to dealing with racial and cultural oppression in education.\n\nSome people who saw the picture suggested the book was a sign of racism or incompetence while others said it might be a prop meant to improve the school’s image.\n\nThe picture was also shared by 6ixBuzzTV on Instagram, an account with about 1.2-million followers."
