Parents whose children have previously attended public school lined up for hours to register their children for a Catholic high school in Brampton.

The 85 available spaces at Cardinal Ambrozic Catholic Secondary School went quickly, and 50 more names were placed on the waiting list.

Parents spend a cold Tuesday night outside waiting for Wednesday’s registration to begin, and that’s not unusual, Bruce E. Campbell, a spokesman for the Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board, told CityNews on Tuesday.

In the past, parents have begun lining up as early as 3 a.m. This year, the lineup began the night before. The lineups happen every year and it also happens at other schools.

The students must live in the catchment area of Cardinal Ambrozic. The school gives priority to Grade 9 students from the Catholic elementary feeder schools. After that, there are approximately 85 spaces available for open access students or those looking to attend from other school boards, Campbell said.

All 85 spaces were filled. Enrolment is capped at 320 students per grade.

Campbell said that there is a perception that the school “is a good place to learn, is very safe, maintains good discipline, and performs well. Also, parents have commented on ‘liking’ uniforms.”
