Watch it to understand why so many Jews, like myself, are saying these words proudly right now: Not in our name.”\n\n— Dave Zirin, The Nation\n\nTo help provide context that’s too often been missing in U.S. corporate media since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, we’re streaming a newly abridged 49-minute cut of our film The Occupation of the American Mind for free. This new edit places special emphasis on propaganda efforts that have helped conceal Israel’s brutal and illegal decades-long occupation of Palestinian land while dehumanizing Palestinians and vilifying those who speak up for Palestinian human rights as either anti-Semitic or terrorist-sympathizers. Click “Watch the Film” above to stream the new cut.\n\nMAKE A DONATION\n\nJoin educators, organizers, and students using this film to spark critical thinking and discussion about American media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Nevertheless, public sympathy and support for Israel within the US continues to hold strong. The Occupation of the American Mind zeroes in on this critical exception, breaking down the devastatingly effective public relations war that Israel and right-wing pro-Israel advocacy groups have been waging for decades in the US. Narrated by Roger Waters and featuring leading observers of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, the film explores how the Israeli government, the US government, and the pro-Israel lobby have joined forces, often with very different motives and interests, to shape American media coverage of the conflict in Israel’s favor. The result is a stunning look at how — and why — American media coverage of the conflict regularly minimizes the occupation, vilifies critics of Israeli policy, and dehumanizes the Palestinian people.\n\nPRESS KIT BUY THE DVD"
