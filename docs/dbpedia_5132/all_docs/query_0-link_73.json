        "text": "Public Health documentary films have been around since the advent of film. In 1922, the very first long-form documentary feature was released. It was a silent, anthropological film called Nanook of the North. Other films began taking a look at important facts, rather than simply fictitious, artful imitations of life. The genre of the documentary film remains a favorite among people who are interested in learning, offering more images than reading, and being less expensive than being there. For those who are specifically interested in the ways that Public Health is depicted in films, and in the topics that documentaries can often expose for people look no further.\n\nIn the current era of tech-obsession, many overworked Americans could not imagine reading a non-fiction book, even about something that matters to them. The newspaper is becoming a thing of the past, replaced with clickbait titles and social media blasts. With technology to learn about and to make films more accessible to all of us than ever before, the number of good quality documentaries available to everyone is on the rise. Video streaming apps like Netflix and Prime Video from Amazon are making this terrific resource at the ready all the time. Gone are the days that you had to be in film school or live in a cultural epicenter where film festivals came to you, in order to see niche documentary films. Many of the documentaries below take a deep dive into some of the most intense Public Health crises of our time. Ranging in topic from Global Health and Epidemiology, to Emergency Risk Management, the concepts portrayed on screen in these films is gripping and will leave you aware of a human complexity that you may have never known.\n\n1.

It is in the first few moments of the film that we discover that many people living in the village have passed away from what we later find out is Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever. Francis is traumatized by his findings, which lead him to later work at the front lines of HIV/AIDS research for the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Prior to its HBO broadcast, the film premiered at the Montreal World Film Festival and has been ubiquitously known as one of the most foundational public health films of our time.\n\nRelease year: 1993\n\nRuntime: 2 hr 21 min\n\n2.

The narrative of the film is driven by the story of a man who communicates only by moving his eyes.

The film asks us to comprehend a flu that kills 70 percent of those it infects and has the possibility of being as contagious as a winter common cold. What would the panic look like in relation to an illness such as this? There are many questions posed, including would the martial law have to be enacted? The avian flu was the first to make it to the collective conscience in Asia, beginning in 1997.

Public Health hero Rajni Kant Singh is a character we get to know in this documentary, and he helps us explore the ways Leprosy has been shuttled off public health agendas, allowing eradication resources to go dormant. Not only does this film dive into the fight to end leprosy, but it educates the public about this misunderstood disease. We are given the information that multidrug treatments and early diagnoses can actually cure the illness. The takeaway of this provocative piece is that there is still work to be done in terms of eradicating leprosy, and the first step is getting it back onto a public health agenda.\n\nRelease year: 2014\n\n8. How to Slay a Dragon\n\nThe film How to Slay a Dragon is a documentary that goes into detail about the illness Dracunculiasis, which is also known as Guinea Worm.

In 1986 there were over 3.5 million cases reported, and as of 2013 the Carter Center reported only 148 cases. This film calls us to ask the question: what was it that allowed this illness to be fought so successfully? Was it the efforts of an international band of Public Health workers? There is no cure or vaccine for Guinea Worm. President Jimmy Carter dedicated much of his philanthropic organization’s mission to eradicate this illness.\n\nRelease year: 2015\n\n9.

How You Really Make Decisions\n\nThis BBC documentary explains the psychological structures that make up the human decision making patterns. Scientists have been able to map these patterns over decades of studies. At the heart of human thinking is a conflict between intuition and logic, says the documentarians. The reason the mind must weigh many variables when making decisions instead of simply taking input and regurgitation output like a computer would is because intuition and emotionality play a role in our decision making as well. The reason this is a Public Health issue is that if we are able to have a better sense of how people decide between two or more variables, we will become able more efficiently educate a population against preventable diseases such as sexually transmitted infections and dietary illnesses like diabetes and heart disease.\n\nRelease year: 2015\n\n14.
