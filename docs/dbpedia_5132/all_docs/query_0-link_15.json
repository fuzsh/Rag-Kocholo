        "text": "Martin Doblmeier\n\nMartin holds degrees in Religious Studies, Broadcast Journalism and honorary degrees in Fine Arts and Humane Letters. Since 1984 he has produced and directed more than 30 films focused on religion, faith and spirituality. He founded Journey Films in 1983 as a television and film production company specializing in religion, faith and spirituality. Journey has produced more than 30 documentary films that have aired on PBS, ABC, NBC, the BBC and on broadcast outlets around the world. Martin combines a lifelong interest in religion with a passion for storytelling. Over the years he has traveled on location to more than forty countries to profile numerous religious leaders, spiritual communities, heads of state and Nobel Laureates. His films explore how belief can lead individuals to extraordinary acts, how spirituality creates and sustains communities and how faith is lived in extraordinary ways.\n\nRichard Crouter\n\nRichard Crouter (Occidental, B.A.; Union Theological Seminary, B.D., Th.D.) taught at Carleton from 1967- 2003 and is the John M. and Elizabeth W. Musser Professor of Religious Studies, Emeritus. His primary interests are in the modern religious thought of Schleiermacher, Kierkegaard, and Reinhold Niebuhr. He is the translator of Friedrich Schleiermacher’s 1799 On Religion: Speeches to its Cultured Despisers (1996), co-edited the Journal for the History of Modern of Theology, (1993-2010), and is the author of Friedrich Schleiermacher: Between Enlightenment and Romanticism (2005). His most recent book is Reinhold Niebuhr: On Politics, Religion, and Christian Faith (2010).\n\nAnthony Bateza\n\nAn instructor in religion at St. Olaf since 2015, Anthony is a specialist in Martin Luther, moral theology and Christian ethics. His research examines Luther’s understanding of human agency and his relationship with the virtue tradition. His other scholarly interests include the broader Augustinian tradition, the impact of Luther’s thought on 19th century philosophy, and questions of race, identity, and social justice. He holds a B.S. from Iowa State University, an M.Div. from the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago, and is a Ph.D. Candidate at Princeton Theological Seminary.\n\nLori Pearson\n\n(St. Olaf College, B.A.; Harvard, M.T.S, Th.D.), 2003\n\nProfessor of Religion at Carleton College and a specialist in the history of Christian theology, with particular interests in modern philosophy of religion, social theory, race, and gender. Her research has focused on theories of tradition, and on concepts of religion, modernity, and the secular in nineteenth-century Germany. She is author of Beyond Essence: Ernst Troeltsch as Historian and Theorist of Christianity (2008) and co-editor of The Future of the Study of Religion (2004). Her current book project uses the work of Marianne Weber (wife of Max Weber) to explore the ways in which cultural and political debates about women’s rights informed early 20th-century theories of religion, social order, and secularization in fin-de-siècle Germany.\n\nEdmund N. Santurri"
