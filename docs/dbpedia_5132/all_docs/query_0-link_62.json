        "text": "As we commemorate Yom HaShoah this year, we are privileged to host the English premiere of an untold story of bravery and morality. “The Conscience of a City” recounts the actions of the citizens of the Germany-Netherlands border town Enschede under the direction of Pastor Leendert Overduin. Risking his own life, the lives of his relatives, and those of the community, he was able to build a full underground network to provide food, funds, and hiding places to many Jews across The Netherlands. Saving 1000 Jewish lives in the darkness of WWII, “The Conscience of a City” is a beacon of light and hope that can inspire generations to come.\n\nJoin us for an opportunity to discuss the history and the film on Thursday, April 8th at 8:00pm. We will hear first hand accounts from survivors, the film director, and Overduin’s family.\n\nFilm available: April 5th-11th\n\nPanelists (Click each name, below, to see full biography)\n\nHerbert Zwartz\n\nHerbert Zwartz was born in 1928 in Enschede.
