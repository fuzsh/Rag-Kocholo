        "text": "It's Ryan's World, We're Just Living In It When I say that the Media ecosystem of the last 40 years is coming to an end, some people think I am being hyperbolic. When I urge folks who've lost their Media & Tech jobs to look outside traditional Media for new ways and new places to wield their superpowers, I think many believe that that doesn't apply to them. Goldman Sachs sizes the Creator Economy at $250 billion today, growing to $500 billion in the next three years. Deloitte just issued a report that says that the majority of GenZ and Millennials would rather watch social video than a \"Hollywood\" film or TV show. And this summer... \"YouTube star Ryan Kaji has created a merchandise line for Walmart, a float for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade and a TV show for Nickelodeon. Now the 12-year-old Texan is going to release a movie in theaters nationwide. Ryanâ€™s World the Movie: Titan Universe Adventure will debut on Aug. 16 on more than 2,000 screens across the US. Kajiâ€™s parents and their partners at pocket.watch will release the film without the help of a major studio.\" https://lnkd.in/eewSaZ5A There is an artisan revolution taking place in the Community Economy - where depth of passion trumps scale, and fandom eats celebrity for lunch. Sure, only the top 1-5% of creators make millions. But search through the ranks of Patreon for an hour, and you'll also see hundreds of self-run small Media businesses making tens of thousands of dollars per month, with only a few thousand subs. My entire enterprise is run on the backbone of this LinkedIn page, and my Substack newsletter. Is it easy? Fuck no. Is it a new way to do the things I've always wanted to do, without the vagaries and bullshit of the corporate tilt-a-wheel? Hells yeah. pocket.watch is a great example of an epic success story in a market (Kids) where the corporations all seem to be failing - built on the backbone of the Creator/Community Economy. There are others. Numerous. And this is just one area that's growing while traditional Media retreats. If you want to get past this terrible no good moment in Media, you have to let go of what's been, and actively look for what's next. You have to wake up stupid, every day, and learn something new about something new. No, not every YouTuber is a Ryan or MrBeast. But few, if any, of us made MrBeast level money when things were \"good.\" There is a way to meet your hierarchy of needs, doing the things you do well. But it involves reimagining how, where, and why you do them for the time we're in, rather than the time gone by."
