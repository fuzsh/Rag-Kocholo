        "text": "Film Independent’s Fiscal Sponsorship program opens the door to nonprofit funding for independent filmmakers and media artists.\n\nLogline\n\nExposing a painful, quintessentially American geography, Conscience Point unearths a deep clash of values between the Native American Shinnecock and their elite Hamptons neighbors, who have made sacred land their playground.\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe Hamptons: playground of the super rich. Epicenter of a luxury property boom, with developers scheming for any scrap of land on which to make millions. Meanwhile, the original inhabitants of this beautiful peninsula, the Shinnecock Indians, find themselves pushed to a point of near extinction, squeezed onto a tiny 750-acre reservation. Over hundreds of years the Shinnecock have seen their ancient burial grounds plowed up unceremoniously for the widening of roads, golf courses and new mansions. On the reservation, wounds run deep. A long-simmering tension between the wealthiest Americans and the Shinnecock will come to a head in the summer of 2018 when the world will be watching the U.S. Open golf tournament unfolding at the ultra-exclusive Shinnecock Hills Golf Club. Few will have any idea that the course was literally carved out of a Shinnecock burial site. A resonant, universal story about place, belonging and power, Conscience Point will expose the true story that underlies the Hamptons as longtime Shinnecock activist Becky Hill-Genia takes a courageous stand to secure the Shinnecock’s future against the odds.\n\nMeet the Filmmakers\n\nTreva Wurmfeld — Director/Producer\n\nTreva Wurmfeld’s feature directorial debut, Shepard & Dark, about playwright Sam Shepard, made its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2012 and won top awards at the Woodstock International Film Festival, the Cleveland International Film Festival and the Florida Film Festival.
