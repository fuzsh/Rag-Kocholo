        "text": "My friend, John Donaghy, who used to do campus ministry at Iowa State University and now is a lay missioner with the Catholic diocese of Santa Rosa de Copán, Honduras, reminds us that on this date in 1943 “Blessed Franz Jägerstätter, Austrian Catholic peasant, husband and father of three girls, conscientious objector to the Nazi army, was executed in Berlin, Germany.” Donaghy notes, moreover, that on this date in 1945, the U.S. dropped its second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan. The connection between these two historical events is not merely coincidental.\n\nAccording to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, “A human being must always obey the certain judgment of his conscience. If he were deliberately to act against it, he would condemn himself.” (no. 1790). At the beginning of my “War and Peace in the Christian Tradition” course, I usually show the film “The Refusal,” which vividly portrays Jägerstätter’s wrestling with the question of whether to obey the summons to serve in the Nazi military. Sadly, most of my students, prior to viewing this movie, say they’ve never heard of Jägerstätter, who was beatified in October 2007. Though a peasant lay Catholic, Jägerstätter carefully informed his conscience about Catholic teaching on war and peace, concluding–humbly and courageously–that the Axis powers’ war against the Allies was unjust. He thereby followed his conscience and refused to act in ways (i.e., fighting in an unjust war) contrary to it. As the Catechism now puts it: “Actions deliberately contrary to the law of nations and to its universal principles are crimes, as are the orders that command such actions. Blind obedience does not suffice to excuse those who carry them out” (no. 2313). Of course, from my reading of Jägerstätter’s writings, I would not necessarily conclude that he was a pacifist (i.e., conscientious objector); much of what he objected to was based on an honest just-war assessment of the war, so he might rather be regarded as a selective conscientious objector. Either way, too bad more Christians back then didn’t join him in taking a conscientious stand–including Christians fighting on the side of the Allies, especially in connection with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki."
