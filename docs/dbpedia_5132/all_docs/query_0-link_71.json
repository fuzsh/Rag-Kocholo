00:01:17.214\n\nHi, how\\'s everything?\n\n00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.990\n\nGood morning, Grandmother.\n\n00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.897\n\nAre we ready to get ready?\n\n00:01:28.897 --> 00:01:29.730\n\nOkay.\n\n00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.981\n\nGood morning, Boopsie.\n\n00:01:30.981 --> 00:01:31.900\n\n(speaking foreign language)\n\n00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.883\n\nMy baby.\n\n00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.970\n\nHenry, hurry, hurry, hurry.\n\n00:01:40.805 --> 00:01:41.638\n\nGive me one second.\n\n00:01:41.638 --> 00:01:42.471\n\nHe\\'ll be right here.\n\n00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:52.646\n\n- [Nasha] Love you.\n\n00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:53.563\n\n- Love you.\n\n00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.900\n\n- [Nasha] See you later.\n\n00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.600\n\n- Shinnecock Nation, it\\'s a small tribe.\n\n00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.630\n\nOn the reservation, 500 people or so\n\n00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:13.310\n\nand we\\'re surrounded by the wealthy folks\n\n00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.790\n\nwho are living on our land.\n\n00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.230\n\nAs native people, you\n\nfeel a responsibility\n\n00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.410\n\nto your ancestral territory,\n\n00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.890\n\nto protect the land as much as we can.\n\n00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.490\n\nIt\\'s nearly impossible in this day and age\n\n00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.563\n\nbut we\\'re still gonna do the best we can.\n\n00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:37.892\n\n(quiet upbeat music)\n\n00:02:39.657 --> 00:02:41.689\n\n- [Group] We pledge allegiance to the Flag\n\n00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.562\n\nof the United States of America\n\n00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:44.410\n\nand to the Republic--\n\n00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.670\n\n- [Man] We\\'re a maritime community.\n\n00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.930\n\nPeople are coming here with\n\nlarge amounts of money.\n\n00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.030\n\nThe conflict now is over development.\n\n00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.040\n\n- More often than not, I hardly recognize\n\n00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.530\n\nthis place I call home.\n\n00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.300\n\n- In the last 10 years we\\'ve\n\nlost right-of-ways to the bay.\n\n00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.500\n\n- This property was\n\ntransferred from the town\n\n00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.633\n\nwithout the town board\n\nunderstanding this agreement.\n\n00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.910\n\n- You watch what happens\n\nwith all this preserve land.\n\n00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.310\n\nThey\\'re gonna be encroaching on it.\n\n00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.140\n\nThey\\'re gonna be putting\n\ndriveways through it.\n\n00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.520\n\n- [Man] That guy down\n\nthere changed that place\n\n00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.027\n\ninto his Hamptons\n\n00:03:17.027 --> 00:03:18.487\n\nand you took our Hamptons.\n\n00:03:18.487 --> 00:03:20.590\n\n- But I don\\'t feel so alone today.\n\n00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.690\n\nI feel what the farmers are feeling.\n\n00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.140\n\nI feel what the people are feeling.\n\n00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.173\n\nAnd we\\'re gonna do something about this.\n\n00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.393\n\nOh my gosh, it\\'s so beautiful today.\n\n00:03:41.672 --> 00:03:42.505\n\nA little bluejay.\n\n00:03:42.505 --> 00:03:43.590\n\nNo, that\\'s a woodpecker.\n\n00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.040\n\nWhat is that?\n\n00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.053\n\nThese are mostly clamshells.\n\n00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.960\n\nWe are at Conscience Point.\n\n00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.930\n\nThis is where our Shinnecock ancestors\n\n00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.230\n\nmet the first Europeans, pilgrims.\n\n00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.670\n\nSome people say, you know,\n\n00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.990\n\nwell my family\\'s been here for\n\nfour, five, six generations.\n\n00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.990\n\nWell, we\\'re been here\n\n400 generations plus.\n\n00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.410\n\nAs far as land was,\n\n00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.680\n\nit was just a total\n\ndifferent way of thinking.\n\n00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.523\n\nLike to own your land,\n\nwe\\'re just caretakers.\n\n00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.850\n\nI love this spot because it is beautiful\n\n00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.050\n\nand it is preserved land over there\n\n00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.630\n\nbut it\\'s a good place to\n\ncommune with the ancestors\n\n00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.670\n\nand let them know how much we honor\n\n00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.310\n\nand respect and care for them\n\n00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.810\n\nand try to be good people\n\n00:04:35.157 --> 00:04:36.136\n\nand think about them.\n\n00:04:36.136 --> 00:04:38.553\n\n(soft music)\n\n00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.450\n\nFor at least the last century\n\n00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.080\n\nthe Hamptons has been\n\na spot for the wealthy\n\n00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.320\n\nto get away from the hustle and bustle.\n\n00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.300\n\nThey can drive their limousines\n\n00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.110\n\nright past this indigenous community\n\n00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.963\n\nand not even know that we exist.\n\n00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.810\n\n- We\\'re a small community.\n\n00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.150\n\nWe\\'re finite in this greater\n\ncommunity of the Hamptons.\n\n00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.410\n\nThe land base that we have here\n\n00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.290\n\nis approximately 1,200 acres.\n\n00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.260\n\nThis is a small piece of\n\nour original territory.\n\n00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.070\n\nOur original territory extended\n\n00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.080\n\nfrom the East Hampton town line\n\n00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.470\n\nall the way to the Brookhaven town line.\n\n00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.000\n\nOne of the first things\n\nthat we did as a people\n\n00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.320\n\nin 1640 when the first settlers arrived,\n\n00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.070\n\nis we gave them eight\n\nsquare miles of land to use\n\n00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.000\n\nwhich is now current\n\nday Southampton Village\n\n00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.310\n\nand we\\'ve paid the\n\nprice for it ever since.\n\n00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.770\n\nHere we sit, you know,\n\n00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.140\n\nin the middle of lifestyles\n\nof the rich and famous\n\n00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.340\n\nand yet 60% of our people in our community\n\n00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.610\n\nare below the poverty level.\n\n00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:55.782\n\nThat\\'s a problem.\n\n00:05:55.782 --> 00:06:00.516\n\n(soft music)\n\n00:06:08.584 --> 00:06:11.060\n\n- You know Modell\\'s Shopping stores?\n\n00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.160\n\nThat\\'s Modell\\'s house.\n\n00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.262\n\nIt\\'s funny the people that live out here.\n\n00:06:16.262 --> 00:06:18.440\n\nYou see this house right here,\n\n00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.160\n\nhouse on an acre?\n\n00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.070\n\nThat\\'s eight million dollars right there.\n\n00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.490\n\nThat huge house back there\n\n00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.370\n\nI sold to a 29 year old 10 years ago\n\n00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.550\n\nfor 15 million dollars.\n\n00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.115\n\nThe owner of Coach just built that house.\n\n00:06:31.115 --> 00:06:34.680\n\nHe paid 25 million dollars\n\nfor the land right there.\n\n00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.530\n\nAnd a farmer sold it that\n\nowned it for hundreds of years.\n\n00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.973\n\nIt\\'s a crazy place.\n\n00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.780\n\nAlmost everybody who\\'s successful\n\n00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.080\n\nfinancially in New York,\n\nthey wanna be here.\n\n00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.550\n\nSo when you have a lot of people chasing\n\n00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.673\n\nnot that much property\n\nit just keeps going up.\n\n00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.110\n\nBut there\\'s something about it out here\n\n00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.360\n\nthat they all wanna come.\n\n00:07:00.238 --> 00:07:02.932\n\nI just happened to enter\n\nreal estate in 1996\n\n00:07:02.932 --> 00:07:05.960\n\nand I call it the best\n\n20 years in real estate\n\n00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.720\n\nin 10,000 years.\n\n00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.530\n\nWe were selling 18 million\n\ndollar houses in \\'06 and \\'07\n\n00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.260\n\nto hedge fund managers\n\nlike they were candy.\n\n00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.290\n\nBeing a finance guy, I like\n\nto turn things quickly.\n\n00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.890\n\nI call it the velocity of money.\n\n00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.710\n\nThe big complaint out\n\nhere is overdevelopment\n\n00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:24.850\n\nand I agree with them.\n\n00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.080\n\nBut people are gonna continue\n\n00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.150\n\nto want homes and buy homes.\n\n00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.870\n\nDoesn\\'t the next generation deserve\n\n00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.583\n\na house, pool, and tennis in the Hamptons?\n\n00:07:31.583 --> 00:07:32.983\n\nI mean, that\\'s how I see it.\n\n00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.270\n\n(waves crashing)\n\n00:07:40.108 --> 00:07:41.630\n\n- This is a very unique area.\n\n00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.670\n\nBesides having a population\n\nof close to 60,000,\n\n00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.210\n\nthat\\'s a year round population.\n\n00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.690\n\nIn the summer months it quadruples\n\n00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.510\n\nand it\\'s very culturally diverse\n\n00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.280\n\nand economically diverse.\n\n00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.530\n\nWe have some of the wealthiest\n\npeople on the planet,\n\n00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:59.050\n\nheads of multinational corporations.\n\n00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.470\n\nThe one percent of the one percenters.\n\n00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.810\n\nThen we also have very modest people\n\n00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.410\n\nwho work two or three jobs to deal with\n\n00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.560\n\nthe high cost of living here.\n\n00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.500\n\nSo the disparity between rich and poor\n\n00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.890\n\nis probably no greater anywhere else\n\n00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.287\n\nthan right here in the\n\ntown of Southampton.\n\n00:08:15.287 --> 00:08:18.070\n\nAnd of course that\n\nmakes things complicated\n\n00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.520\n\nbecause you have to serve\n\nand protect all people.\n\n00:08:31.391 --> 00:08:34.224\n\n(birds squawking)\n\n00:08:35.759 --> 00:08:38.978\n\n(engine revving)\n\n00:08:38.978 --> 00:08:41.395\n\n(soft music)\n\n00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.710\n\n- My family\\'s been out here\n\nsince the early 1700\\'s.\n\n00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.760\n\nI grew up in a farming-fishing community.\n\n00:08:52.985 --> 00:08:54.360\n\nYou know, it\\'s still a gorgeous place,\n\n00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.193\n\ndon\\'t get me wrong,\n\n00:08:55.193 --> 00:08:56.893\n\nbut it\\'s pretty much been bought up.\n\n00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.630\n\n20 years ago that would\\'ve\n\nbeen stuffed with scallops\n\n00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:17.183\n\nfor weeks.\n\n00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.793\n\nThis is called sputnik grass.\n\n00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.390\n\nIt\\'s kind of the only thing\n\n00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.850\n\nthat every scallop larvae\n\nhas to hide in these days.\n\n00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:28.683\n\nIt\\'s heavy.\n\n00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.920\n\nWith all the toxins that\n\nare going into the bays,\n\n00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.340\n\nit makes it really difficult.\n\n00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.420\n\nYou know, (laughs) God knows\n\nwhat goes into these bays.\n\n00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.030\n\nIn the morning you see\n\nthem spray, vector spray,\n\n00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.870\n\nfor mosquito control.\n\n00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.370\n\nYou\\'re like, ugh.\n\n00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.780\n\nJuvenile fish are eating mosquito larvae.\n\n00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.840\n\nYou know, that\\'s how\n\nthe whole cycle works.\n\n00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.310\n\nA lot of the locals back in the day\n\n00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.580\n\ndidn\\'t really wanna build on the water.\n\n00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.130\n\nThat\\'s why land next to\n\nthe water was so cheap\n\n00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:56.640\n\nbecause there was too many mosquitoes.\n\n00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.260\n\nYou\\'d get eaten alive.\n\n00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.130\n\nYou know, and now as everything is kinda\n\n00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.036\n\nchanging ecologically\n\nthere\\'s no mosquitoes.\n\n00:10:03.036 --> 00:10:05.200\n\nWell that\\'s why there\\'s no juvenile fish\n\n00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.440\n\nkind of making their way back up\n\n00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.290\n\ninto the marshes and stuff like that.\n\n00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.440\n\nThe Shinnecocks are the only ones\n\n00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.093\n\nthat have respectively\n\nkept it undeveloped.\n\n00:10:17.959 --> 00:10:19.490\n\nYou know, if you look at the bay\n\n00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.140\n\naround where the reservation\n\nis, it\\'s gorgeous\n\n00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.200\n\nand then everywhere else\n\nhas been built up on.\n\n00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.860\n\nSo, I mean, for me it has basically\n\n00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.443\n\ndestroyed my livelihood,\n\nthe development on the bay.\n\n00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.183\n\n- All right, see you guys later.\n\n00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.160\n\nWe\\'re gonna go over to where the fish\n\n00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.103\n\nusually show up in the early season.\n\n00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.060\n\nWhat I do catch, I eat myself.\n\n00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.730\n\nI\\'ll also give it to people\n\nfor free, free of charge\n\n00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:57.193\n\nup here on the reservation.\n\n00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.530\n\nI do the same thing with hunting.\n\n00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:00.930\n\nYou know, I shoot a couple deer,\n\n00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.370\n\nI shoot a few ducks,\n\n00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.920\n\nI give them away to people\n\nhere on the reservation.\n\n00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:06.870\n\nPeople like it.\n\n00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:08.053\n\nMy dad taught me that.\n\n00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.220\n\nOne of our traditional ways\n\n00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.200\n\nat the end of a prayer\n\n00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.760\n\nor at the end of a ceremony,\n\n00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.120\n\nwe say (speaking foreign language)\n\n00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.103\n\nwhich means all of my relations.\n\n00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.040\n\nAnd when you\\'re saying all of my relations\n\n00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.660\n\nyou\\'re acknowledging the connection,\n\n00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.410\n\nnot just between your immediate family,\n\n00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.380\n\nbut you\\'re acknowledging the connection\n\n00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.040\n\nyou have to everything, all of creation,\n\n00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.970\n\nand that what you do with one thing,\n\n00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:38.630\n\nit affects the other thing.\n\n00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.330\n\nThere\\'s actually different kind of fish\n\n00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:41.923\n\nthan there were when I was a kid.\n\n00:11:41.923 --> 00:11:43.480\n\nI was out there right in front\n\n00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.730\n\nof Calvin Klein\\'s house, actually,\n\n00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:45.563\n\nand I pulled up a sand shark\n\n00:11:45.563 --> 00:11:46.760\n\nand the boat right next to me\n\n00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.437\n\npulled up a sand shark too and he was like\n\n00:11:48.437 --> 00:11:50.380\n\n\\\"I\\'ve never seen a sand\n\nshark in Heady Creek!\\\"\n\n00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.296\n\nI was like, \\\"Me either!\\\"\n\n00:11:51.296 --> 00:11:53.379\n\n(laughs)\n\n00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.350\n\nOur reservation\\'s a peninsula\n\n00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.820\n\nand on the east side is Heady Creek\n\n00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.590\n\nand half of Heady Creek, and just in 2015,\n\n00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.450\n\ngot shut down for shellfish\n\n00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:05.730\n\nand that\\'s just because of runoff\n\n00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:09.203\n\nfrom all the houses, the golf\n\ncourse, things like that.\n\n00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:12.790\n\nFor the most part what you see\n\n00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.090\n\nin all of the Hamptons are assets.\n\n00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:16.850\n\nYou know, they don\\'t\n\nactually really live there\n\n00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:17.683\n\nfor the most part.\n\n00:12:17.683 --> 00:12:19.520\n\nIn the summertime they\n\ncome out here to vacation\n\n00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.870\n\nbut for the most part, they\\'re assets.\n\n00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.090\n\nIf they were there year round\n\n00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:24.790\n\nthere\\'d be a lot more pollution.\n\n00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.080\n\nIt is detrimental to our health here\n\n00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.483\n\nand economy on Shinnecock.\n\n00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.690\n\nYou know, so our biggest thing\n\n00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:34.273\n\nis that we have to continue\n\nto protect our front line.\n\n00:12:34.273 --> 00:12:39.190\n\n(soft music)\n\n00:12:49.308 --> 00:12:50.404\n\n- [Nasha] You want a clam rake?\n\n00:12:50.404 --> 00:12:51.237\n\n- Um, no.\n\n00:12:52.677 --> 00:12:54.493\n\nWe\\'re not doing good here.\n\n00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:59.220\n\nHunting and fishing to near\n\nextinction of everything.\n\n00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.383\n\nIt happened so fast.\n\n00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.520\n\nThere\\'s barely any more scallops left.\n\n00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.220\n\nWe had a tribal oyster\n\nhatchery for a while\n\n00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.603\n\nbut that closed down, unfortunately.\n\n00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.580\n\nSo there\\'s no tribal shellfish business\n\n00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.163\n\nlike they do on the outside.\n\n00:13:19.804 --> 00:13:23.090\n\n(speaking foreign language)\n\n00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:26.455\n\nWe\\'re just back to sustenance living.\n\n00:13:26.455 --> 00:13:28.200\n\nYou know, go out, get some clams,\n\n00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.333\n\nsome mussels, scallops,\n\nfor our own supper.\n\n00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:34.410\n\nFish to eat, you know, for the week or so.\n\n00:13:37.531 --> 00:13:41.123\n\n- Look it!\n\n- Let\\'s open our bucket.\n\n00:13:41.123 --> 00:13:41.956\n\nYay!\n\n00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:45.531\n\n- [Girl] Now we get to eat here!\n\n00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:58.160\n\n- I absolutely, unequivocally\n\nsee a correlation\n\n00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:02.450\n\nbetween the overdevelopment\n\nand especially our waterways.\n\n00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:03.870\n\nWe are people of the shore.\n\n00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.560\n\nOur livelihood over the course of time\n\n00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.340\n\nhas been derived from the waters.\n\n00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:13.690\n\nWe, as whalers, basically\n\nestablished the economy out here\n\n00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.120\n\nand selling whale oil for the street lamps\n\n00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.333\n\nand things like that.\n\n00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:23.860\n\n- We have to live here together.\n\n00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.020\n\nIt\\'s not getting any better.\n\n00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.320\n\nIt\\'s getting worse.\n\n00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.980\n\nThe groundwater pollution,\n\n00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.560\n\nthe contamination, the pesticides\n\n00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.000\n\n\\'cause your lawn has to be spotless\n\n00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.680\n\nand bright green and unnatural,\n\n00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.520\n\nand the chemicals, everything\n\nthat\\'s polluting this earth\n\n00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.980\n\nand we\\'re drinking it and people\n\n00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.810\n\nare dying of cancer left and right.\n\n00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.563\n\nCan\\'t you see it\\'s got to stop?\n\n00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.070\n\n- Right here will be the tennis court,\n\n00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.830\n\nin the back is the pool,\n\n00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.090\n\nand this house will sell\n\nfor about 10 million\n\n00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.690\n\nbut I\\'m confident it\\'ll\n\nsell in the next 90 days.\n\n00:15:01.512 --> 00:15:02.345\n\nDo you speak English?\n\n00:15:02.345 --> 00:15:03.850\n\n- A little, yes.\n\n00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:05.720\n\n- I need that shut off for five minutes.\n\n00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.400\n\n- Oh, okay, okay.\n\n- Okay, while we do something.\n\n00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.380\n\nThanks, bud.\n\n00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.140\n\nAs you see, it\\'s like so wide open.\n\n00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.010\n\nThis has changed with our clients\n\n00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.260\n\nwho are now in their 30\\'s and 40\\'s\n\n00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.850\n\nand they want more modern and very open.\n\n00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.050\n\nSo people pay for that\n\n00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:20.430\n\nand there\\'s no woods.\n\n00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.240\n\nPeople don\\'t really love the woods.\n\n00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.393\n\nThey want openness.\n\n00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.660\n\nBut, you know, you\\'ll drive up the street\n\n00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.430\n\nand you\\'ll see four of\n\nmy houses in a farm field\n\n00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.423\n\nand that gets people crazy.\n\n00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.137\n\nSo, how do I defend myself against that?\n\n00:15:35.137 --> 00:15:37.060\n\nYou know, I didn\\'t buy the farm\n\n00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.423\n\nand cut it up and sell it,\n\n00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.530\n\nyou know, the farmer did.\n\n00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:44.290\n\n- Broc, fennel,\n\n00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.270\n\nlooks like forage in there.\n\n00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.560\n\nThese are all perennial herbs.\n\n00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.510\n\nCardoon over there.\n\n00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:51.890\n\nEdible violas.\n\n00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:53.740\n\nNasturtiums.\n\n00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.470\n\nWe do a lot of edible flowers.\n\n00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:56.840\n\nPeople discovered kale.\n\n00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.330\n\nNow we have about six or\n\neight different types of kale.\n\n00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.980\n\n- Yeah, this is a real\n\nworking farm, as you can tell.\n\n00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.510\n\nAs the landscape has changed,\n\n00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:06.450\n\nwe\\'ve had to evolve.\n\n00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:08.050\n\nAnd it\\'s constant.\n\n00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.070\n\nNettles, 12.99 a pound.\n\n00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.430\n\nThe family farm has been\n\nhere since the 1600\\'s\n\n00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.770\n\nand we are the 11th generation.\n\n00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:21.067\n\nWe were growing up in a very\n\nsweet provincial little town\n\n00:16:21.067 --> 00:16:23.290\n\nand there was so much land.\n\n00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:24.925\n\nI mean, I...\n\n00:16:24.925 --> 00:16:27.500\n\nIt\\'s really amazing what\\'s happened\n\n00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.245\n\nin a short amount of time\n\n00:16:29.245 --> 00:16:30.670\n\nwith the waters being polluted\n\n00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.480\n\nand the overbuilding.\n\n00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.750\n\n- Yeah, even in the past 10, 15 years\n\n00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:36.610\n\na lot of acreage that we used to rent\n\n00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:40.223\n\nfrom family members, now\n\nthat\\'s all gone and developed.\n\n00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:43.390\n\n- It\\'s a lot easier to\n\nsell an acre of land\n\n00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.403\n\nfor half a million dollars\n\n00:16:44.403 --> 00:16:49.403\n\nthan it is to struggle and\n\nwork 50, 60 hours a week.\n\n00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:55.504\n\n(soft music)\n\n00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.140\n\n- Since 1640 there were all these\n\n00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.000\n\ndifferent disputes about land.\n\n00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.920\n\nPeople challenging whether\n\nthe land was theirs,\n\n00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.710\n\nwhether they had the right to graze there.\n\n00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.500\n\nThe town of Southampton\n\napproached the tribe\n\n00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.367\n\nand said \\\"Okay, this is how we\\'re going\n\n00:17:16.367 --> 00:17:17.737\n\n\\\"to try to resolve this.\n\n00:17:17.737 --> 00:17:22.357\n\n\\\"We will give to the tribe\n\na lease for 1,000 years.\\\"\n\n00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:28.000\n\nAnd that includes the lands\n\nfor where we live now,\n\n00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.570\n\nShinnecock Neck, the Shinnecock Hills.\n\n00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:33.910\n\nWe were able to hold this lease\n\n00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:35.920\n\nand then the tribe would sublease\n\n00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.000\n\nto farmers and other people\n\n00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.350\n\nand still be able to use our own land.\n\n00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:44.300\n\nThat\\'s how we were able to get\n\na lot of our basic needs met.\n\n00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.100\n\n- We were given a lease\n\nfor 3,000 plus acres.\n\n00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.300\n\nThat was whittled away,\n\nwhittled away, whittled away\n\n00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.970\n\nuntil 1859.\n\n00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:56.330\n\n1859, the robber barons,\n\nthe railroad people,\n\n00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.200\n\nwanted to build the railroad line\n\n00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.510\n\nfrom Manhattan out to Montauk\n\n00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:05.510\n\nand in blatant disregard\n\nfor the Non-intercourse Act,\n\n00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:10.750\n\nwhich said that no state,\n\nno town, no village,\n\n00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:14.180\n\nno farmer could take land from an Indian\n\n00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.130\n\nor an Indian tribe without\n\nan act of Congress.\n\n00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.850\n\nWell New York state,\n\nthey had 20 signatures\n\n00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.690\n\nsupposedly giving the land to the state.\n\n00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:26.870\n\nWell 10 of those signatures\n\nwere people that were dead.\n\n00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:29.770\n\nThey had gone and gotten\n\nnames off of headstones.\n\n00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:32.380\n\nThe other 10 were not Shinnecock.\n\n00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.650\n\nThis is what they put before the judge,\n\n00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.280\n\nthey got the land, and our people,\n\n00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.680\n\nfrom that next day when\n\nwe found out about it,\n\n00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.610\n\nproceeded to fight for it.\n\n00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:47.460\n\nBut we, as Indian people,\n\nwere not considered citizens,\n\n00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.973\n\nso they would not allow us\n\nto take this into court.\n\n00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.520\n\nThis land was stolen from us.\n\n00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.703\n\nFlat-out, no questions,\n\nhands down, stolen.\n\n00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:02.030\n\nNow what sits on the acreage\n\n00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.050\n\nis some of the most\n\n00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:06.560\n\nprestigious golf courses in the world.\n\n00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.967\n\nYou have a national golf course.\n\n00:19:08.967 --> 00:19:11.390\n\nYou have a brand new one,\n\nSebonack Golf Course.\n\n00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:15.800\n\nYou have Shinnecock Hills which\n\nwill be hosting the US Open.\n\n00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.520\n\nAnd you have a multitude of\n\nmulti-million dollar homes\n\n00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.313\n\nthat sit in what was once\n\nour sacred Shinnecock Hills.\n\n00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.390\n\n- Property under video surveillance.\n\n00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:36.410\n\nThis is the Shinnecock Hills Golf Course.\n\n00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:39.390\n\nThis was, this is a sacred place to us\n\n00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:41.560\n\nand it was a long time ago\n\n00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.713\n\nand it still is.\n\n00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.160\n\nWe can come here but still\n\nwe\\'re on the outside.\n\n00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.780\n\nWe\\'re not allowed in here.\n\n00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:53.780\n\nWe\\'re not allowed any\n\naccess to our sacred sites.\n\n00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.680\n\nThey use our name for whatever they want.\n\n00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.100\n\nTheir logo is a native\n\nchief with a headdress on.\n\n00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:05.160\n\nIt\\'s the in your face kind of boldness.\n\n00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.170\n\nWe know we have still to this day\n\n00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:13.913\n\nancestors buried in this golf course.\n\n00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.700\n\nBuried with respect and ceremony\n\n00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.683\n\nand love and honor.\n\n00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:26.090\n\nShinnecock men were hired to\n\nhelp construct the golf course.\n\n00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.230\n\nStories handed down to us say\n\n00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:30.200\n\nthat they witnessed hundreds and hundreds\n\n00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.650\n\nof the ancestor\\'s bones being desecrated\n\n00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:35.120\n\nduring this construction.\n\n00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.150\n\nThey couldn\\'t do anything about it.\n\n00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.950\n\nAnd to host the U.S Golf Open here,\n\n00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.970\n\nit\\'s just a slap in the face.\n\n00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:43.550\n\n- [Employee] What are you guys doing?\n\n00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.395\n\n- [Woman] We\\'re making a documentary.\n\n00:20:45.395 --> 00:20:46.946\n\n- Okay well, I got a call about\n\n00:20:46.946 --> 00:20:49.590\n\na suspicious vehicle here, so.\n\n00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.310\n\n- We\\'re not trespassing.\n\n00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.530\n\nThis is none of your business\n\nright now, so goodbye.\n\n00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:54.363\n\n- Actually it is.\n\n- Goodbye, no it isn\\'t.\n\n00:20:54.363 --> 00:20:55.196\n\n- [Employee] I\\'m an\n\nemployee of the golf club.\n\n00:20:55.196 --> 00:20:56.890\n\n- This is public property, goodbye,\n\n00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:58.240\n\nand I\\'m a Shinnecock Indian.\n\n00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.389\n\nSo leave us alone, goodbye.\n\n- I don\\'t care about\n\n00:20:59.389 --> 00:21:00.222\n\nthat at all.\n\n00:21:00.222 --> 00:21:01.055\n\n- I don\\'t care who you are either.\n\n00:21:01.055 --> 00:21:02.780\n\nWe\\'re on public property,

are you kidding me?\n\n00:21:05.955 --> 00:21:07.040\n\n- Want me to call the police?\n\n00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.767\n\n- Sure, go right ahead.\n\n- Okay, ma\\'am.\n\n00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:10.440\n\n- I\\'m not even on the golf course.\n\n00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.005\n\nI\\'m on the doggone shoulder\n\n00:21:12.005 --> 00:21:13.863\n\nand already this guy is harassing me.\n\n00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:19.910\n\nWell that\\'s how the\n\nParrish Pond fight started.\n\n00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:21.340\n\nWe were on the shoulder of the road\n\n00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.650\n\nhaving our peaceful protest\n\n00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:25.890\n\nand the New York State Police showed up\n\n00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.690\n\nwith a chip on their shoulder.\n\n00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:30.679\n\nSomeone told them that\n\nthere was a bunch of Indians\n\n00:21:30.679 --> 00:21:32.880\n\non the side of the road protesting\n\n00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.230\n\nthe desecration of the land.\n\n00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:36.450\n\nWe were well within our rights\n\n00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:38.320\n\nwhere we were standing.\n\n00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.020\n\nThis is the Parrish Pond development.\n\n00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:45.230\n\n62 acres of beautiful, pristine land\n\n00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:48.623\n\nwith some of the last of\n\nthe marine plant life,\n\n00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:50.893\n\nHeathland they call it.\n\n00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:54.510\n\nIt\\'s gone.\n\n00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.003\n\nIt\\'s now someone\\'s lawn.\n\n00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.193\n\nIt\\'s gone forever.\n\n00:22:02.392 --> 00:22:04.256\n\nWe are protecting our sovereign territory.\n\n00:22:04.256 --> 00:22:05.497\n\n- [Man] You\\'re talking about our land.\n\n00:22:05.497 --> 00:22:06.800\n\n- Where\\'s that not one more acre sign?\n\n00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:07.633\n\nCan you read that?\n\n00:22:07.633 --> 00:22:09.080\n\nI hope everybody here can read\n\n00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.570\n\n\\'cause that\\'s what we\\'re here for.\n\n00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:11.883\n\nNot one more acre.\n\n00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:14.300\n\nNot one more acre.\n\n00:22:15.887 --> 00:22:17.640\n\nThe state police were just hollering\n\n00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.943\n\nand cursing at us.\n\n00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.990\n\nOne in particular,\n\n00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:23.893\n\nafter the bulldozers\n\nstarted up their engines,\n\n00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.930\n\nhe came from behind with all his might\n\n00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.033\n\nand pushed me into the middle of the road.\n\n00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.970\n\nWe know that bones were dug up here\n\n00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:45.170\n\nand construction workers were instructed\n\n00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:46.633\n\nto put them in the dumpster.\n\n00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:52.870\n\n- When we ride through\n\nthe Shinnecock Hills,\n\n00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:57.400\n\nand you see what we consider\n\nthe destruction of our land,\n\n00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.040\n\nyou know, you hear about the Sioux\n\n00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.020\n\nand their famed Black Hills,\n\n00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:03.730\n\nour Shinnecock Hills here\n\n00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:07.490\n\nheld the same meaning,\n\nthe same historic value\n\n00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:10.900\n\nthat any of these other\n\ntribes around the country\n\n00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.150\n\nhave held with their land.\n\n00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:15.560\n\nWe\\'ve had several digs\n\nup in the hills there\n\n00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.290\n\nthat have traced our lineage in this area\n\n00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.053\n\nback over 10,000 years.\n\n00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:26.960\n\n- Our ancestors would bury\n\npeople on the hilltops.\n\n00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.740\n\nThe villages that we would live on\n\n00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.500\n\nwould be on the east\n\nside where the sun rises\n\n00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:36.390\n\nand then the burials\n\nwould be all facing west\n\n00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:39.160\n\nand so that\\'s so the sunset can bring them\n\n00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.673\n\ninto the spirit world.\n\n00:23:57.331 --> 00:24:02.139\n\n(train rattling)\n\n00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.754\n\n- Good morning, everybody.\n\n00:24:14.754 --> 00:24:17.610\n\nDid you guys have a good\n\nMemorial Day weekend?\n\n00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:19.763\n\nRuthie and I, we have a special guest here\n\n00:24:19.763 --> 00:24:21.090\n\nwith us today.\n\n00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:23.273\n\nOur town supervisor, Jay\n\nSchneiderman is here.\n\n00:24:23.273 --> 00:24:25.510\n\n(crowd applauding)\n\n00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:26.343\n\n- Thank you.\n\n00:24:26.343 --> 00:24:28.740\n\nIt\\'s an honor for me to\n\nserve as your supervisor.\n\n00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.388\n\nThe town is in great shape.\n\n00:24:30.388 --> 00:24:32.410\n\nWe continue to work really hard\n\n00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:35.520\n\non protecting drinking\n\nwater and surface waters\n\n00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:39.520\n\nand open space, keeping taxes\n\nlow which I know is important.\n\n00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.640\n\nWe have the U.S. Open coming\n\n00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.800\n\nand you know, the big\n\nUSGA golf tournament,\n\n00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.320\n\nthat is coming next week.\n\n00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.450\n\nIt brings a lot of money to the economy\n\n00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:50.899\n\nand that\\'s a good thing.\n\n00:24:50.899 --> 00:24:52.610\n\n- [Citizen] My question\\'s about taxes.\n\n00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:53.443\n\n- [Jay] Sure.\n\n00:24:53.443 --> 00:24:55.980\n\n- Taxes really have become a problem.\n\n00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.240\n\nAre you concerned about that?\n\n00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.850\n\n- So I realize a lot of\n\nyou pay property taxes\n\n00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:02.550\n\nand property values are\n\ngoing up in general.\n\n00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:04.810\n\nAnd I know most of you\n\nare on fixed incomes.\n\n00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:08.300\n\nThe high cost of land complicates\n\na lot of things out here\n\n00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.970\n\nand it acts as a filter.\n\n00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:11.930\n\nSo a lot of people who may be\n\n00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:13.410\n\nthird, fourth, fifth generation\n\n00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:14.963\n\nkinda grew up out here,\n\n00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:18.430\n\nthey see the cost of living go up\n\n00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:20.830\n\nbut their property values\n\nare going through the roof.\n\n00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.550\n\nTheir taxes are going higher and higher.\n\n00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:24.940\n\nThey end up selling those houses\n\n00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.600\n\nand then that house will become\n\n00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.510\n\nprobably a second home\n\n00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:32.460\n\nand somebody will have to\n\nservice that second home\n\n00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:35.120\n\nto take care of the landscaping\n\n00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.260\n\nor fix the boiler or mow the lawn.\n\n00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.750\n\nThat person probably isn\\'t gonna be able\n\n00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:41.180\n\nto live in the community.\n\n00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.410\n\nSo a lot more workers are commuting in\n\n00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:45.457\n\nfrom further and further away\n\n00:25:45.457 --> 00:25:48.360\n\nand you see that in the mornings between,\n\n00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.560\n\nsay 6:00 o\\'clock and 9:00 o\\'clock.\n\n00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:54.430\n\nThe traffic eastbound is unbelievable.\n\n00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:56.660\n\nSo we\\'re creating a demand for labor\n\n00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.750\n\nthat can\\'t live in this community.\n\n00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:00.340\n\n- [Reporter] Southampton\n\ntown officials say\n\n00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:02.700\n\nthe most horrifying violations they found\n\n00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.910\n\nat the Bel-Aire Cove Motel.\n\n00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:06.450\n\nTown code officers this week\n\n00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:10.930\n\nissued 215 code violations\n\nagainst 28 landlords.\n\n00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:13.310\n\nOfficials say they found 17 people\n\n00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:16.022\n\nliving in this four bedroom house.\n\n00:26:16.022 --> 00:26:18.439\n\n(soft music)\n\n00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:22.970\n\n- A lot of people are struggling.\n\n00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:27.627\n\nIf a three bedroom house\n\ncost you, I don\\'t know,\n\n00:26:27.627 --> 00:26:31.710\n\n$3,000 a month and you\\'re only making,\n\n00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:33.943\n\nyou know, $15 an hour,\n\n00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.800\n\nand they\\'re only letting\n\nyou work 25 hours a week\n\n00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.593\n\nbecause they don\\'t wanna\n\ngive you insurance,\n\n00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.640\n\nwe have people that\n\ndon\\'t have places to live\n\n00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.110\n\nthat are sleeping out in the woods\n\n00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:50.910\n\nor have making little shacks\n\nfor themselves to live\n\n00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:53.080\n\nbecause they\\'re poor and they\\'re homeless.\n\n00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:53.913\n\nPeople hear that.\n\n00:26:53.913 --> 00:26:55.327\n\nThey\\'re like \\\"Oh, you\\'re in the Hamptons.\n\n00:26:55.327 --> 00:26:56.427\n\n\\\"What are you talking about?\n\n00:26:56.427 --> 00:26:57.747\n\n\\\"Are you kidding me?\n\n00:26:57.747 --> 00:26:59.520\n\n\\\"You\\'re in the Hamptons.\\\"\n\n00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.950\n\n- It\\'s a kind of classic\n\ntown gown in the Hamptons.\n\n00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:04.590\n\nThe professional middle class\n\n00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:06.400\n\nis so far from the elite\n\n00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.000\n\nand there is such an\n\nantagonism towards the elite.\n\n00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.040\n\nYou could feel that on a visceral level.\n\n00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:15.640\n\nOn the other hand, the whole\n\neconomy is based on this elite.\n\n00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.590\n\nAnd so it\\'s really hard not to kind of\n\n00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:21.570\n\ncontinue to market and cater to this elite\n\n00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:23.743\n\nat the same time that you resent them.\n\n00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:28.850\n\nI think the Hamptons represents\n\na historical microcosm\n\n00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:30.747\n\nof the class struggle\n\nhere in the United States\n\n00:27:30.747 --> 00:27:33.310\n\nand in many cases, around the world\n\n00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:36.400\n\nbecause it begins when Native Americans\n\n00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.270\n\nwho had lived here on the land\n\n00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:40.410\n\nhave that land taken away from them\n\n00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:41.600\n\nand the only thing left\n\n00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.960\n\nis really for them to become\n\n00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.363\n\nthe initial working class\n\nhere in the Hamptons.\n\n00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:49.490\n\n- Did you have fun on the playground?\n\n00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:51.940\n\nDid you go to the\n\nplayground or to the beach?\n\n00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:53.107\n\n- To the park.\n\n00:27:53.107 --> 00:27:54.350\n\n- Okay.\n\n00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:56.710\n\nOne child sleeps on that couch.\n\n00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:57.850\n\nTwo sleep on this couch.\n\n00:27:57.850 --> 00:27:59.470\n\nI sleep on that bed.\n\n00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:02.450\n\nAnd when another grandson comes over\n\n00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:03.940\n\nhe sleeps like right here.\n\n00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:06.520\n\nHe\\'ll put the pillows down and sleep here.\n\n00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:10.320\n\nAnd then Nasha and her\n\ndaughter sleep in one bedroom\n\n00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.890\n\nand my mother sleeps in that bedroom.\n\n00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:15.720\n\nSo, we have to take care of each other.\n\n00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.873\n\nThe housing situation doesn\\'t\n\nget any better around here.\n\n00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:23.673\n\nAnd I mean, the oppression runs deep.\n\n00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.380\n\n- Every member of the Shinnecock Nation\n\n00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.320\n\nis a member of the town of Southampton\n\n00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.140\n\nand so they\\'re entitled to everything\n\n00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:35.700\n\nthat any town resident would have.\n\n00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.140\n\nThey certainly vote,\n\n00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:40.040\n\nthey get permits to park on the beaches,\n\n00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.180\n\nthey use all town facilities.\n\n00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:43.760\n\nThere are tremendous things\n\n00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.990\n\nthat members of the nation\n\ncan take advantage of\n\n00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:48.150\n\nwithout paying any property taxes.\n\n00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:50.910\n\nBut we do have high value properties\n\n00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:51.900\n\nthat pay high taxes\n\n00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.480\n\nthat provide services.\n\n00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.730\n\nYouth services, transportation services,\n\n00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:58.320\n\npark services, roads.\n\n00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.680\n\nAnd the Shinnecock Nation,\n\n00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.820\n\nthey benefit from all of those things.\n\n00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:03.580\n\nThe same things that I\n\ncan take advantage of\n\n00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.650\n\nand you know, I pay property taxes.\n\n00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:09.430\n\nWe\\'re obviously in a very\n\nstrong fiscal position.\n\n00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:12.550\n\nWe\\'re improving our roads,\n\nwe\\'re fixing drainage problems,\n\n00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:14.740\n\nwe\\'re addressing infrastructure,\n\n00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.870\n\nwe\\'re improving our parks\n\nthat everybody enjoys.\n\n00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:19.910\n\nWhat happens when you do that?\n\n00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:22.950\n\nPeople want to live in\n\na community like that.\n\n00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:25.510\n\n- What we\\'ve done is\n\ntremendous for the town.\n\n00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:27.450\n\n400 homes we\\'ve built\n\n00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:32.080\n\nand the average tax bill\\'s\n\ngotta be $30,000 on my homes.\n\n00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.870\n\nIt\\'s really helped keep up\n\n00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:35.450\n\nwith the ever growing budget.\n\n00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:38.540\n\nYou know, the town needs the\n\ndevelopment to keep going.\n\n00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.020\n\nThey\\'ll never say that\n\n00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.472\n\nbut what would they do without it?\n\n00:29:42.472 --> 00:29:44.972\n\n(heavy music)\n\n00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:56.650\n\n- The Hamptons as a place\n\nof paradise and respite\n\n00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.590\n\nwas something that Walt\n\nWhitman wrote about\n\n00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:01.930\n\nand inspired a whole generation of artists\n\n00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:03.423\n\nto leave New York to go out.\n\n00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.320\n\nIt became a place that symbolized nature.\n\n00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:10.320\n\nIt\\'s symbolized this authenticity.\n\n00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:15.320\n\nAs the bohemian pioneers do in\n\nall forms of gentrification,\n\n00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.640\n\nthe artists brought out\n\nthe very rich people\n\n00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.140\n\nwho saw this place for its natural beauty\n\n00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:24.023\n\nbut also as a place that they\n\ncould put their mark on it.\n\n00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.530\n\nVery wealthy people from New York City\n\n00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:30.030\n\nwent out and built these\n\nhuge summer cottages\n\n00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:31.980\n\nand it became kind of the place\n\n00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:34.180\n\nfor the rich and famous to go.\n\n00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.560\n\nOn the one hand,\n\ncelebrating its naturalness\n\n00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.150\n\nbut also bringing in electric lights\n\n00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:41.830\n\nand bringing in the golf clubs\n\n00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:43.850\n\nand bringing in all\n\nthe different trappings\n\n00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:46.093\n\nof their New York high society.\n\n00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.960\n\n- Hi, welcome back to \\\"Talk of the Town\\\".\n\n00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.190\n\nI\\'m your host Jay Schneiderman\n\n00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:58.400\n\nand we are talking about the U.S. Open,\n\n00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.600\n\nthe 118th U.S. Open.\n\n00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.460\n\nYou have been here for two\n\nyears planning this event.\n\n00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:05.950\n\n- [Man] We\\'ve been in\n\nthe community for a while\n\n00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:07.073\n\nbut now it\\'s real.\n\n00:31:07.073 --> 00:31:10.050\n\n- Well we certainly like\n\nhaving you guys here.\n\n00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:11.340\n\nWe try at the town level\n\n00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:13.180\n\nto be as accommodating as we can\n\n00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.410\n\nand we recognize over $100 million\n\n00:31:16.246 --> 00:31:18.313\n\nin economic flow into the community.\n\n00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:22.860\n\n- Despite the bumper to bumper traffic,\n\n00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.010\n\nand the hassle of getting\n\n00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:26.990\n\nto one of golf\\'s premier\n\ntournaments played right here\n\n00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:30.000\n\nat Shinnecock Hills Golf\n\nCourse in Southampton,\n\n00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.860\n\nit\\'s estimated about 30,000 spectators\n\n00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.450\n\nwill attend the week long event,\n\n00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:37.230\n\nhelping business boom in the area.\n\n00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:39.670\n\nIncluding here at Melrose Pizza\n\n00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:41.820\n\nwhere pies are flying out the door.\n\n00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.190\n\nAnd they are certainly\n\nhappy to get a piece\n\n00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:47.720\n\nof the U.S. Open pie.\n\n00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.220\n\n- You guys sat right at the table with us\n\n00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:51.430\n\nin that last meeting\n\n00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:53.570\n\nand I feel personally that you misled us.\n\n00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:55.550\n\nSo, as far as I\\'m concerned,\n\n00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:56.770\n\nyou could\\'ve mentioned that then\n\n00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:59.570\n\nand said well we really have\n\nno need for overflow parking\n\n00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:01.470\n\nwhen Sage and Williams said to you\n\n00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:02.897\n\nall the people coming from the east\n\n00:32:02.897 --> 00:32:04.900\n\ncould be parked on the res.\n\n00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:06.120\n\nYou never mentioned that you had\n\n00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.390\n\nalready established parking east.\n\n00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:10.497\n\nSo, you know, you can sit there\n\n00:32:10.497 --> 00:32:11.840\n\nand try to spin it because\n\n00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.870\n\nthat\\'s what you do as a media person,\n\n00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:15.930\n\nbut we still have to answer to the people\n\n00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:18.360\n\nand the people right\n\nnow didn\\'t even want us\n\n00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.330\n\nto continue any negotiations.\n\n00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:22.832\n\nThat was the sentiment\n\nin the meeting Wednesday.\n\n00:32:22.832 --> 00:32:24.410\n\n(audience applauding)\n\n00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:26.050\n\n- [Golfer] Hey Phil, hit\n\nit in the holes, baby.\n\n00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:26.883\n\nYeah, baby!\n\n00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:29.900\n\n- Don\\'t even continue the negotiations.\n\n00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.903\n\nLike, let\\'s just go out there and protest.\n\n00:32:32.903 --> 00:32:33.749\n\n(tribal percussion music)\n\n00:32:33.749 --> 00:32:38.082\n\n(woman singing in foreign language)\n\n00:33:02.359 --> 00:33:07.359\n\n(car horn honks)\n\n(woman vociferating)\n\n00:33:07.527 --> 00:33:08.447\n\n- Hi, Rebecca.\n\n00:33:08.447 --> 00:33:09.672\n\n- Hi, how are you?\n\n00:33:09.672 --> 00:33:13.409\n\nWe\\'ll be here probably from at\n\nleast 8:00 to 5:00 everyday.\n\n00:33:13.409 --> 00:33:14.670\n\n- Okay.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:17.690\n\nHe said if we need\n\nanything just let him know.\n\n00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:18.790\n\nWe need our land back.\n\n00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.410\n\n- You know, they\\'re sitting on\n\n00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:24.670\n\none of the most valuable\n\npieces of land in the country\n\n00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:27.713\n\nand they could generate\n\nincome from that land.\n\n00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:33.570\n\nLike they could all be\n\nmillionaires, literally.\n\n00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:36.180\n\nBut they can\\'t seem to get behind\n\n00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:38.853\n\nany one idea and stick\n\nwith it for very long.\n\n00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:41.320\n\nI don\\'t know what\\'s the right\n\n00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:45.150\n\neconomic development\n\ndirection for the Shinnecocks.\n\n00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:46.633\n\nIt\\'s really up to them.\n\n00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:51.493\n\nBut they have opportunities.\n\n00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:55.880\n\nThe town is not standing in their way.\n\n00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.600\n\n- [Reporter] It\\'s the\n\nmulti-million dollar question,\n\n00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.530\n\nwhere will the Shinnecock Indians\n\n00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:03.010\n\nwant to build their casino\n\n00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:04.780\n\nnow that they\\'ve cleared a big hurdle\n\n00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:07.337\n\nin getting federal recognition as a tribe?\n\n00:34:07.337 --> 00:34:09.180\n\n- There was a tribe in Connecticut\n\n00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:12.520\n\nthat owned one of the largest\n\ncasinos in the country.\n\n00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.170\n\nThey excelled.\n\n00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:17.330\n\nThey went by us like\n\nwe were standing still\n\n00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:22.330\n\nand in terms of creating\n\neconomic development.\n\n00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.510\n\nWhen we started the gaming\n\n00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:28.023\n\nthere was a lot of hope in our community.\n\n00:34:29.397 --> 00:34:30.230\n\nAs soon as we did that\n\n00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:32.110\n\nwe became public enemy number one.\n\n00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:33.760\n\n- I\\'ve been living here 43 years.\n\n00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.320\n\nI have no desire to have that around here.\n\n00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.900\n\n- The island\\'s narrow.\n\n00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.280\n\nWe have traffic problems as it is.\n\n00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:43.040\n\n- Certainly, revenues from\n\na casino could be quite high\n\n00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.964\n\nbut the community does not want to see\n\n00:34:44.964 --> 00:34:48.100\n\na gambling facility out on the east end.\n\n00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.520\n\nA lot of people had\n\nconcerns about the traffic\n\n00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:54.300\n\nand the problems that are\n\nsometimes associated with gaming.\n\n00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.583\n\n- It\\'s gonna cause traffic.\n\n00:34:55.583 --> 00:34:57.900\n\nHave you been out there on 27 lately\n\n00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:59.840\n\nto understand the traffic out there?\n\n00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.210\n\nWe didn\\'t create that.\n\n00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:02.043\n\nYou did.\n\n00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.210\n\nWe were going to start a small facility.\n\n00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:07.310\n\nWe weren\\'t going to go into\n\n00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:11.710\n\nthe big billion dollar\n\nfacilities or anything like that.\n\n00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:13.080\n\nWe went through that whole year\n\n00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.890\n\nand it was really a nightmare.\n\n00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:16.777\n\nThe developer backed away\n\n00:35:16.777 --> 00:35:18.800\n\nand the whole thing just fell apart.\n\n00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.680\n\nLiterally, it fell apart.\n\n00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.630\n\nWhile we were good neighbors\n\neverything was okay.\n\n00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:25.160\n\nYou know, as long as you Indians\n\n00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.880\n\nstay up on the reservation\n\nand in your place,\n\n00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.983\n\nyou know, we\\'re fine having you here.\n\n00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:33.910\n\n- I\\'m not really sure what else\n\n00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:36.690\n\nthe town can do for members of the nation\n\n00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:38.320\n\nbut I think that they could improve\n\n00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.743\n\ntheir economic situation in a lot of ways\n\n00:35:40.743 --> 00:35:43.800\n\nand I\\'d love to work\n\nwith the Tribal Council\n\n00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.470\n\nmoving an idea forward as long as it\\'s one\n\n00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:51.130\n\nthat is, you know, really\n\nsupports the community,\n\n00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:54.000\n\nit\\'s not gonna be a\n\nproblem for the community.\n\n00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.150\n\n- The Hamptons itself has become a brand.\n\n00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:59.160\n\nIt\\'s become a commodity.\n\n00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.450\n\nAnd one of the things\n\n00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:02.550\n\nthat\\'s buttress the image of the Hamptons\n\n00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:04.780\n\nas the land of the rich and famous\n\n00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:07.630\n\nis the marketing to the rich and famous.\n\n00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:10.880\n\nThat makes it even harder for\n\npeople who are struggling.\n\n00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.920\n\nThat makes it even harder for the people\n\n00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.880\n\nwho are in the backroom doing the dishes\n\n00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.400\n\nor the people who are\n\nserving and being ignored\n\n00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.420\n\nor the people who are cleaning the streets\n\n00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:20.870\n\nor the people who are in places\n\n00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:22.950\n\nlike the Shinnecock Reservation\n\n00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:27.480\n\nwhere you essentially have\n\nwhatever cultural capitol\n\n00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.150\n\nhaving, quote unquote, \\\"Real Indians\\\"\n\n00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:33.006\n\ngives to a location but\n\nwithout any knowledge\n\n00:36:33.006 --> 00:36:34.780\n\nof the history struggle\n\n00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:37.295\n\nand what those different\n\nlocations actually mean.\n\n00:36:37.295 --> 00:36:42.287\n\n(soft music)\n\n00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:13.549\n\n- We\\'ve seen more Porches\n\nand Mercedes and--\n\n00:37:13.549 --> 00:37:14.764\n\n(car horn honks)\n\n00:37:14.764 --> 00:37:16.380\n\nWhoo!\n\n00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.547\n\nThanks friend!\n\n00:37:18.482 --> 00:37:19.526\n\n- Hi, how you doing?\n\n00:37:19.526 --> 00:37:20.773\n\n- Good.\n\n- All right, and you?\n\n00:37:20.773 --> 00:37:21.651\n\n- I\\'m well.\n\n00:37:21.651 --> 00:37:25.490\n\nSo I saw the signs and I wanted\n\nto see what was going on.\n\n00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:30.490\n\nSo there are remains that are just--\n\n00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:33.920\n\n- Our ancestors are still buried there.\n\n00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.140\n\n- What do you think should be done\n\n00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:36.730\n\nfor them to right a wrong?\n\n00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:38.290\n\nLike what do you think?\n\n00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:39.123\n\n- [Woman] Really?\n\n00:37:39.123 --> 00:37:40.560\n\nGive us our land back.\n\n00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.060\n\n- Yeah, you want the whole course back.\n\n00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:44.562\n\n- It would be nice if\n\nwe got our whole 360--\n\n00:37:44.562 --> 00:37:45.395\n\n- That would be nice.\n\n00:37:45.395 --> 00:37:47.245\n\nI don\\'t think that that\n\nactually will happen.\n\n00:37:47.245 --> 00:37:49.190\n\n- They can start with the\n\nreconstruction of the graves\n\n00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:53.160\n\nso that they don\\'t play golf\n\non the graves of our ancestors.\n\n00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:56.180\n\n- And at least acknowledgment\n\nto Shinnecock, the people.\n\n00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.060\n\nNot Shinnecock the golf course.\n\n00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:58.893\n\n- No, I know.\n\n00:37:58.893 --> 00:38:00.300\n\nI was really curious because I know\n\n00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:03.930\n\nthere\\'s millions and millions\n\nof dollars being made.\n\n00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:05.280\n\nLike how can you right\n\n00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:08.823\n\nor how would you want the\n\nright, the wrong to be--\n\n00:38:08.823 --> 00:38:10.070\n\n- [Woman] I just told you.\n\n00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:11.060\n\n- Yeah to get back the land.\n\n00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:12.555\n\n- [Woman] I just told\n\nyou, give back our land.\n\n00:38:12.555 --> 00:38:13.950\n\n- Right, they probably won\\'t.\n\n- That\\'s all.\n\n00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:16.220\n\n- Why is it fair to continue on\n\n00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.910\n\ncommitting this crime of stolen property?\n\n00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:21.200\n\nJust because you stole it\n\na hundred and so years ago\n\n00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.720\n\ndoesn\\'t mean the crime goes away.\n\n00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:27.300\n\nYou take our land, you\n\ndesecrate our graves,\n\n00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.670\n\nyou play golf, you make\n\nbazillions of dollars.\n\n00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:31.470\n\nWhat is just and fair about that?\n\n00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:32.303\n\nNothing.\n\n00:38:32.303 --> 00:38:34.350\n\nYou gotta start from square one.\n\n00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:35.183\n\n- Start.\n\n00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:37.103\n\nYeah.\n\n00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:41.593\n\nI\\'m with you.\n\n00:38:41.593 --> 00:38:42.870\n\n- [Rebecca] Okay, thank you.\n\n00:38:53.604 --> 00:38:55.620\n\n- [Man] You have the logo on your shirt.\n\n00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:56.480\n\n- Yeah, that\\'s the real logo\n\n00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.533\n\nnot that fake Shinnecock Open logo.\n\n00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:02.950\n\nMy grandmother was one of the\n\nmatriarchs of our community.\n\n00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:04.640\n\nShe was born in 1889.\n\n00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.980\n\nI think one of the things\n\nthat she instilled in us,\n\n00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:09.960\n\nI had two uncles.\n\n00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.793\n\nThey caddied.\n\n00:39:10.793 --> 00:39:13.280\n\nThey used to caddy right\n\nover here at Shinnecock Hills\n\n00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.600\n\nand everyday that we\n\nrode on that golf course\n\n00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.487\n\nshe would say to us \\\"Little\n\nman, this is your land.\n\n00:39:19.487 --> 00:39:23.977\n\n\\\"This is our land and you\n\nhave to get this back for us.\n\n00:39:23.977 --> 00:39:26.257\n\n\\\"It\\'s gonna be your\n\ngeneration that does it.\\\"\n\n00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.080\n\nThe land battle has been ongoing.\n\n00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:36.080\n\nFrom 1978 we started\n\nthis battle, this fight\n\n00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:41.540\n\nfor recognition and land.\n\n00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:46.240\n\nIn the last 15 years we\n\nfinally had enough funding\n\n00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.937\n\nto really fight it in court.\n\n00:39:47.937 --> 00:39:51.580\n\n- So it was 2005 that we first\n\n00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.070\n\nofficially filed our land claim.\n\n00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:55.690\n\n- They\\'re claiming latches.\n\n00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:58.070\n\nAnd what latches is, latches says that,\n\n00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:00.110\n\nwell you waited too long.\n\n00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:01.800\n\nYou didn\\'t fight for it.\n\n00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.500\n\nAnd we\\'re like, are you kidding?\n\n00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:08.240\n\n- And the equitable doctrine of latches,\n\n00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:13.240\n\nyou can\\'t disrupt the expectation\n\nof current land owners\n\n00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:19.310\n\nand because the court of appeals\n\njust dismissed our claims\n\n00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:24.140\n\nwe weren\\'t able to delve\n\ninto the facts of the case.\n\n00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:28.400\n\nSo I put together a petition\n\nfor a writ of certiorari\n\n00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.173\n\nto the Supreme Court for our land claim.\n\n00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:34.630\n\nIt\\'s kind of the last way\n\n00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:39.110\n\nto really exhaust your\n\nclaim through the system.\n\n00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:43.580\n\nBut the Supreme Court decided\n\nnot to review our claim.\n\n00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:46.340\n\nYou know, in that sense it\\'s still alive.\n\n00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.883\n\nIf it was an unfavorable decision,\n\n00:40:48.883 --> 00:40:52.920\n\nthat would really have ended our claim.\n\n00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.580\n\nBut they didn\\'t and because of that,\n\n00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:59.418\n\nwe still have ways that\n\nwe can bring our claims.\n\n00:40:59.418 --> 00:41:01.835\n\n(soft music)\n\n00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.503\n\n- We have a saying.\n\n00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:13.840\n\nWe have to preserve our way of life\n\n00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.493\n\nfor the next seven generations.\n\n00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:20.913\n\nWhat that means is that we\n\nhave to understand who we are,\n\n00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:24.110\n\nwe have to understand our history,\n\n00:41:25.336 --> 00:41:27.936\n\nand we have to be able to\n\ntell that to our children.\n\n00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:30.757\n\nIt was a famous quote.\n\n00:41:30.757 --> 00:41:33.280\n\n\\\"To save the man you\n\nmust kill the Indian.\\\"\n\n00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.402\n\nMeaning not literally kill the person\n\n00:41:35.402 --> 00:41:37.390\n\nbut you have to kill the\n\nIndian spirit inside of them.\n\n00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:39.670\n\nYou have to kill their way of life\n\n00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:42.013\n\nand turn them into a civilized person.\n\n00:41:43.923 --> 00:41:46.480\n\nIt was actually illegal in\n\nthe United States and Canada\n\n00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.520\n\nfor Native Americans to\n\npractice our cultures,\n\n00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.200\n\nfor us to hold ceremonies,\n\n00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.163\n\nfor us to wear our traditional regalia.\n\n00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.330\n\nThey would say that we couldn\\'t\n\nhave been worshiping God\n\n00:41:58.330 --> 00:41:59.580\n\nbecause we weren\\'t Christian.\n\n00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:01.680\n\nSo we must have been worshiping the Devil.\n\n00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:07.370\n\nWe were forced to assimilate\n\nto the colonized world\n\n00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:11.823\n\ndue to what I call\n\ninstitutionalized colonialism.\n\n00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:15.230\n\nA lot of culture was lost.\n\n00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:16.800\n\nA lot of our history was lost.\n\n00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:21.090\n\n- There used to be a stockade downtown\n\n00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:25.120\n\nand our people used to\n\nbe put in that stockade\n\n00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.163\n\nif we were caught speaking our language.\n\n00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:35.670\n\n- The Hamptons has its own\n\nsense of its own history\n\n00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:37.370\n\nand who gets to tell that history?\n\n00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.500\n\nThere are two ways that people\n\n00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.943\n\nwho kind of come to an area\n\n00:42:44.943 --> 00:42:48.520\n\nand conquer and settle an area\n\n00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:52.100\n\ntry to both imprint\n\ntheir own identity on it\n\n00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.510\n\nand then naturalize it in a way\n\n00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:55.290\n\nas if they\\'ve always been there.\n\n00:42:55.290 --> 00:43:00.290\n\nThe first way is to establish\n\nthe aesthetic of their lives.\n\n00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:02.860\n\nThey build buildings that\n\nlook like the buildings\n\n00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:04.370\n\nthat they\\'re used to.\n\n00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:07.540\n\nSo you bring with you and\n\nyou build what you know.\n\n00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.930\n\nBut eventually you need to suggest\n\n00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:12.420\n\nthat this always was.\n\n00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:14.930\n\nYou start to look at the history\n\n00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:16.830\n\nand who gets to tell the history\n\n00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:19.100\n\nand where do you start your history.\n\n00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:22.830\n\nYou start to look at how things are named.\n\n00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:25.540\n\nYou start to create a\n\nkind of historical sense\n\n00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:28.210\n\nthat this has always been your place,\n\n00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:29.900\n\nyou are of this place.\n\n00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:31.560\n\nAnd so, if we\\'re really going to have\n\n00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.281\n\nan accurate picture of history,\n\n00:43:33.281 --> 00:43:36.280\n\nwhose voices aren\\'t\n\nbeing portrayed in this\n\n00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.993\n\nand what do they add to the story?\n\n00:43:38.946 --> 00:43:41.529\n\n(bell dinging)\n\n00:43:58.110 --> 00:43:59.540\n\n- The Southampton Town Board\n\n00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:02.950\n\nhas made massive efforts to\n\nprotect their colonial sites\n\n00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:04.560\n\nand their colonial cemeteries,\n\n00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.100\n\ntheir colonial old houses\n\n00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:11.040\n\nbut they don\\'t make an effort to help us\n\n00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:15.090\n\npreserve our Native American\n\nsensitive sacred sites.\n\n00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:17.390\n\nThey just, they don\\'t see it as the same.\n\n00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:21.130\n\n- The acquisition of lands\n\nof Romeo in Shinnecock Hills.\n\n00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:23.790\n\n- We have been before you many many times\n\n00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:26.880\n\nand always have said the same thing.\n\n00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.153\n\nThe goal is to preserve the 13 acres.\n\n00:44:30.985 --> 00:44:32.235\n\nGood afternoon.\n\n00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:37.110\n\nI am Rebecca Genia and this\n\nis Nasha, my granddaughter.\n\n00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:39.330\n\nWe\\'re from the Shinnecock Indian Nation.\n\n00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:42.190\n\nI believe the town of\n\nSouthampton needs a reminder\n\n00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:44.730\n\nthat life did not begin in 1640\n\n00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:47.840\n\nwhen the pilgrims arrived\n\non our shores from Europe.\n\n00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.730\n\nNative people lived on this\n\nland in harmony with nature\n\n00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:53.890\n\nfor thousands and thousands\n\nof years before your arrival.\n\n00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:54.990\n\n- Public hearing number five\n\n00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:57.890\n\nto consider the acquisition\n\nof lands of Parrish Pond.\n\n00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:59.040\n\n- The source of funding would be\n\n00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.760\n\nthe Community Preservation Fund.\n\n00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.370\n\n- Those lots were historically sensitive\n\n00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:05.190\n\nand what they\\'re planning to do with it\n\n00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:06.890\n\nto preserve it, does anybody know?\n\n00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.590\n\n- Today we\\'re talking about preservation.\n\n00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:12.510\n\nPrimarily land preservation\n\n00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:14.610\n\nand the Community Preservation Fund.\n\n00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:16.280\n\n- When property transfers,\n\n00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.330\n\nthe buyer pays 2% of the purchase price\n\n00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:19.580\n\ninto a dedicated fund.\n\n00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:22.950\n\n- This 2% tax has been\n\ngenerating quite a bit of money.\n\n00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:24.460\n\n- In the town of Southampton alone\n\n00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:27.842\n\nthe fund has generated\n\nover $700 million, yes.\n\n00:45:27.842 --> 00:45:28.722\n\n- Right.\n\n00:45:28.722 --> 00:45:30.960\n\nWow, $700 million.\n\n- Yes.\n\n00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.500\n\nPrevious to the 1990\\'s,\n\n00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:37.130\n\nthere was your small year\n\nround population here\n\n00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:41.010\n\nas well as your summer resort homeowners.\n\n00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:42.750\n\nI think in the 1990\\'s,\n\n00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:46.433\n\nWall Street started to sort of get bigger.\n\n00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.933\n\nThe Hamptons became an\n\nattractive place to have equity.\n\n00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:54.770\n\n- With the pace of development\n\n00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:57.120\n\nwe\\'re losing open spaces.\n\n00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.200\n\nWoodlands, which are an important habitat.\n\n00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.510\n\nWe\\'re losing farmland,\n\n00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:05.800\n\nwhich was part of our\n\nagricultural character.\n\n00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:09.540\n\nSo we started to buy a\n\nlot of these properties.\n\n00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:13.300\n\nIt really kind of protected\n\nour rural character.\n\n00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:16.190\n\n- People who spend a lot\n\nof money on homes out here\n\n00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:18.320\n\nreally love to drive past farmland.\n\n00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.730\n\nCommunity Preservation Fund\n\n00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:21.870\n\nwas to preserve our community character\n\n00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:25.300\n\nwhich is defined, in part,\n\nwith our scenic landscapes.\n\n00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:27.870\n\n- You know, one of the\n\nthings that accompanies\n\n00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:30.330\n\nthis new wave out to the Hamptons\n\n00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:31.970\n\nis a kind of aesthetic\n\n00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:34.683\n\nthat really creates a new sense of nature.\n\n00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.160\n\nIf you look at some of the photography\n\n00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.260\n\nof the disappearing farms\n\n00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.820\n\nand there\\'s this kind of\n\nromanticization of the farms\n\n00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:45.300\n\nat the same time that\n\nfarms are becoming vistas\n\n00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:46.450\n\nand not working farms.\n\n00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:48.940\n\nThey don\\'t produce food, right?\n\n00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:50.630\n\nThey produce views.\n\n00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:52.070\n\nPhotographers kind of create\n\n00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:54.600\n\nthis whole nostalgia around the farms\n\n00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.270\n\nat the same time that they kind of\n\n00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:58.290\n\nnaturalize their extinction.\n\n00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:00.610\n\nIt really turns farms into this\n\n00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:04.070\n\nkind of caricature of\n\nsomething that\\'s historical.\n\n00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:04.940\n\nAnd on the other hand,\n\n00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:07.690\n\nit\\'s a distortion of the\n\nhistorical narrative itself\n\n00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:10.250\n\nbecause it suggests that\n\nthe farms themselves\n\n00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:12.070\n\nare what\\'s indigenous to the place.\n\n00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:14.140\n\nAnd of course, the farms only represent\n\n00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:16.970\n\nthat wave of conqueror\n\nthat clear cut the land\n\n00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:19.050\n\nand destroy the Native American economy\n\n00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:20.290\n\nand brought in their own kind\n\n00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:22.143\n\nof commercial agricultural economy.\n\n00:47:29.793 --> 00:47:32.730\n\n- Shinnecocks do alert me to properties\n\n00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:34.640\n\nthat they think are important.\n\n00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:38.050\n\nThey will get involved,\n\nparticularly for a subdivision\n\n00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:40.510\n\non a property that they feel is important\n\n00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:42.390\n\nto explore preservation.\n\n00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:44.680\n\nIt has to do with timing and persistence\n\n00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.733\n\nand also with the Shinnecock Tribe members\n\n00:47:46.733 --> 00:47:50.040\n\neducating land owners and helping them\n\n00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.890\n\nto understand why it\\'s important.\n\n00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:56.140\n\n- We\\'ve been able to preserve,\n\n00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:59.760\n\nI think it\\'s less than 20 acres of land,\n\n00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.910\n\nfighting tooth and nail\n\n00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:03.410\n\ntelling them these are graves,\n\n00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:05.870\n\nwe have to protect them,\n\nthis is sacred land,\n\n00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:08.290\n\nthis is ancient burials.\n\n00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:11.190\n\nNew York is one of four\n\nstates in the whole country\n\n00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:13.672\n\nthat don\\'t have graves protection laws.\n\n00:48:13.672 --> 00:48:15.830\n\n(thrilling music)\n\n00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:17.450\n\n- [Reporter] Walter\n\nRichards of Shelter Island\n\n00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:19.480\n\nspeaks with awe about the\n\ndiscovery he unearthed\n\n00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:22.130\n\non the grounds of his Osprey Road home.\n\n00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:24.110\n\nA mass grave containing the remains\n\n00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:25.770\n\nof Native American Indians.\n\n00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:28.230\n\nSkeletal remains buried in fetal positions\n\n00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:30.930\n\nabout four feet into the ground.\n\n00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:33.730\n\n- It\\'s not too late and it\\'s\n\nnot over till it\\'s over.\n\n00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:36.080\n\nThere\\'s not one foundation up there yet.\n\n00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:40.300\n\n- A horse barn was built\n\nover a massive grave site\n\n00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:42.620\n\non private property.\n\n00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:44.480\n\nDespite the good intentions\n\n00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:48.320\n\nand the good will of\n\nindividuals and town people,\n\n00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.917\n\nthey went ahead and built it.\n\n00:48:54.453 --> 00:48:55.630\n\nYou have a known grave site,\n\n00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:59.860\n\nyou have a known, it\\'s on\n\ncounty land or public land,\n\n00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:04.490\n\nthere are laws, there\n\nare rules and regulations\n\n00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:06.660\n\nin place to protect those sites\n\n00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:10.600\n\nbut if they\\'re on private land,\n\nthen it\\'s a different story.\n\n00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:11.970\n\n- Everybody watches Discovery Channel.\n\n00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:12.803\n\nWe thought this was something\n\n00:49:12.803 --> 00:49:14.800\n\nthat was gonna be really neat\n\n00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:15.910\n\nand be able to uncover.\n\n00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:17.810\n\nWe had a really good time uncovering it\n\n00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:19.200\n\nand looking at everything and studying it.\n\n00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.510\n\nIt was a real, it was really exciting.\n\n00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:23.200\n\nWe thought it would be\n\nin the best interest\n\n00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.097\n\nof the remains to be encased\n\n00:49:25.097 --> 00:49:28.000\n\nwithin the four walls of our structure\n\n00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.240\n\nand basically preserved forever.\n\n00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.800\n\nWhich when you get into the whole,\n\n00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.880\n\nwhich that\\'s when things went awry\n\n00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:38.650\n\nbecause we didn\\'t know\n\nthat their belief system\n\n00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:40.460\n\nwas not similar to our belief system\n\n00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:43.930\n\nwhere we bury people in\n\nconcrete vaults all the time.\n\n00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:46.550\n\n- Don\\'t imagine how we feel.\n\n00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:50.523\n\nImagine how you would feel if it were you.\n\n00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:57.750\n\n- Shelter Island prompted us\n\nto start writing legislation.\n\n00:49:57.750 --> 00:50:00.550\n\n- When these issues are\n\nbrought to our attention\n\n00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:02.800\n\nwe address them like a fire drill.\n\n00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.760\n\nSeeing that, the Shinnecocks have proposed\n\n00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:09.460\n\nthat there be a systematized\n\napproach to this,\n\n00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:12.120\n\nnamely a colonial and Native Americans\n\n00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:14.080\n\ngraves preservation act.\n\n00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:17.120\n\n- This draft has been with\n\nthe Southampton Town Board\n\n00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:20.080\n\nprobably since 2003.\n\n00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:22.720\n\nYou know, archeologists have helped.\n\n00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:25.430\n\nOver the past 13 years or so,\n\n00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:27.830\n\nevery time we go to the\n\nSouthampton Town Board,\n\n00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:29.720\n\nokay well here\\'s another draft.\n\n00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:31.370\n\nWe\\'ll have to run it by the attorney.\n\n00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:36.370\n\nWe have, we\\'re probably on\n\nour fourth town supervisor.\n\n00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:37.713\n\n- George.\n\n00:50:37.713 --> 00:50:39.100\n\n- I think the real experts on this\n\n00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:41.256\n\nare sitting in front of\n\nyou, the Shinnecocks.\n\n00:50:41.256 --> 00:50:42.089\n\n- [Board Member] Of course.\n\n00:50:42.089 --> 00:50:44.420\n\n- What you said to us in\n\nthe following phone calls\n\n00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:45.940\n\nis that it\\'s in the attorney\\'s hands.\n\n00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:47.696\n\nWhat has your attorney come up with\n\n00:50:47.696 --> 00:50:51.620\n\nin four and a half years\n\nof

through at least\n\nthree different attorneys.\n\n00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:00.140\n\n- We\\'ve been through many supervisors,\n\n00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:01.470\n\nmany different board members,\n\n00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:03.570\n\nmany different town attorneys,\n\n00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:05.150\n\nand everybody has the same story.\n\n00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:08.020\n\nOh, we\\'re looking into\n\nit and we\\'ll, you know,\n\n00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:09.489\n\npass it by the attorneys.\n\n00:51:09.489 --> 00:51:10.790\n\n- The people that buy the property\n\n00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:11.810\n\ndon\\'t know the property.\n\n00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:13.460\n\nThey only see the value.\n\n00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:14.510\n\nI don\\'t blame them for that.\n\n00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:16.430\n\nThat\\'s all we show them.\n\n00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:19.530\n\nSouthampton Town needs\n\nto say there\\'s graves.\n\n00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:21.746\n\nIf you find one, you\\'re moving your house,\n\n00:51:21.746 --> 00:51:23.070\n\nyou\\'re moving your driveway.\n\n- Okay, but I wanna\n\n00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:24.040\n\nget you there legally.\n\n00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.550\n\n- Legally.\n\n- Okay.\n\n00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:27.150\n\nAnd we\\'ve talked about this\n\n00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:29.520\n\nand I know it\\'s all\n\ncumbersome and complicated\n\n00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:32.130\n\nand I\\'m asking my town attorney\n\nto please pay attention\n\n00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:34.550\n\nso that you can move it through\n\nthe town attorney\\'s office.\n\n00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:37.660\n\n- It\\'s only complicated because\n\nyou\\'ve never done it before.\n\n00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:38.860\n\nIt\\'s not complicated.\n\n00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:39.800\n\nThis is very simple.\n\n00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.350\n\nIf you want it done, you do it.\n\n00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:42.930\n\nAnd anyone who buys property here\n\n00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:46.240\n\nthat is part of the gamble they take\n\n00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:47.690\n\nwhen they buy a piece of property\n\n00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:48.523\n\nin the town of Southampton.\n\n00:51:48.523 --> 00:51:50.793\n\nAnd it can be done at your next meeting.\n\n00:51:50.793 --> 00:51:51.626\n\n- I understand what\n\n00:51:51.626 --> 00:51:52.459\n\nyou\\'re saying.\n\n- Well if it\\'s that simple,\n\n00:51:52.459 --> 00:51:53.670\n\nwe will try it but I\\'m telling you,\n\n00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:55.050\n\nI don\\'t think it\\'s that simple.\n\n00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:56.710\n\n- Now, on private property there\\'s a law\n\n00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:59.550\n\nthat you can\\'t bury a person.\n\n00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:01.680\n\nI don\\'t see how it\\'s so hard to have a law\n\n00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:04.302\n\nthat says you can\\'t dig up a person.\n\n00:52:04.302 --> 00:52:06.600\n\nSome things are as simple\n\nas that, they really are.\n\n00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:08.500\n\n- We\\'re not going to settle for this\n\n00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:11.730\n\neach and every single\n\ntime a grave is unearthed.\n\n00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:13.810\n\n- So within a month we\\'re gonna regroup,\n\n00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:15.910\n\nwe\\'re gonna give our\n\ntown attorney some time.\n\n00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:17.110\n\nWe will get back to you\n\n00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:19.270\n\nand Becky is, you\\'re our main point person\n\n00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:21.770\n\nfor heading up the task force.\n\n00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:51.100\n\n- A number of you have come to approach\n\n00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:56.100\n\nthe board of Native American\n\nGraves Burial Site Protection.\n\n00:52:57.552 --> 00:52:59.583\n\n- If you all could just, pass it on.\n\n00:53:00.721 --> 00:53:03.770\n\nWe\\'re on our fourth supervisor since 2003\n\n00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:08.420\n\nand we have not really\n\ngotten too much of anywhere.\n\n00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:10.130\n\n- You\\'re saying the owner\\'s rights\n\n00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:13.750\n\nare over yours, is that,\n\npresently and you\\'re looking to--\n\n00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:16.590\n\n- Yes, go over the rights of\n\nthe desecration of the grave.\n\n00:53:16.590 --> 00:53:19.560\n\n- Do we have a committee for relationships\n\n00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:21.700\n\nbetween the Shinnecock\n\nNation and the town?\n\n00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:22.730\n\n- No.\n\n- All right.\n\n00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:23.563\n\nProbably is a good idea\n\n00:53:23.563 --> 00:53:26.320\n\nwhether it would be twice a year\n\n00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:27.777\n\nor something like that, I don\\'t know.\n\n00:53:27.777 --> 00:53:28.610\n\n- I don\\'t either\n\n00:53:28.610 --> 00:53:32.550\n\nbut in order for us to\n\naccomplish certain things\n\n00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.250\n\nwe have to kind of keep it separate.\n\n00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:37.170\n\n- I just wanna make sure,\n\n00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:39.120\n\ntoday you\\'re speaking as a representative\n\n00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:41.470\n\nof the Shinnecock Nation\n\nor as an individual?\n\n00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:44.620\n\n- I am on the Shinnecock\n\nArcheological Advisory Committee,\n\n00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:46.740\n\nthe, so I don\\'t know what you\\'re asking.\n\n00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:47.573\n\n- We just wanna know if this is--\n\n00:53:47.573 --> 00:53:50.850\n\n- Plus I am general counselor.\n\n- Your position today,\n\n00:53:50.850 --> 00:53:53.070\n\nis it an official position\n\n00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:54.930\n\nof the Shinnecock Nation\n\n00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:56.960\n\nor is an individual position?\n\n- I am an official\n\n00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:58.710\n\nrepresentative of the Shinnecock\n\n00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:00.920\n\nArcheological Advisory Committee\n\n00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:04.830\n\nand I\\'m no stranger, maybe\n\nto you all because I predate,\n\n00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:07.530\n\nI don\\'t really remember anybody\\'s face.\n\n00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:08.540\n\n- So I just wanna make sure\n\n00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:10.147\n\nyou\\'re speaking on behalf of the nation.\n\n00:54:10.147 --> 00:54:12.350\n\n- [Rebecca] And I have been since 2003\n\n00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:14.000\n\nand it\\'s in black and white\n\nright in front of you.\n\n00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.530\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\n- Okay, appreciate it.\n\n00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:18.500\n\n- We think a simple procedure\n\n00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:21.070\n\nto protect these inadvertent discoveries.\n\n00:54:21.070 --> 00:54:22.270\n\n- [Jay] You know what my fear is, right?\n\n00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:23.103\n\n- I know what it is.\n\n00:54:23.103 --> 00:54:24.410\n\n- That a developer, not, you know,\n\n00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:25.980\n\ndevelopers are good people, you know?\n\n00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:30.980\n\nBut that if we make the\n\nprocess too onerous,\n\n00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:32.600\n\nthat they\\'re not gonna tell us.\n\n00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:33.774\n\nThey\\'re just, they\\'ll simply\n\n00:54:33.774 --> 00:54:35.240\n\npretend they never saw it.\n\n00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:36.151\n\n- [Rebecca] That\\'s what\\'s been happening.\n\n00:54:36.151 --> 00:54:36.984\n\n- And so we have to make sure--\n\n00:54:36.984 --> 00:54:38.213\n\n- [Woman] That\\'s what\\'s been happening.\n\n00:54:38.213 --> 00:54:40.334\n\n- Okay, but there are\n\nremedies for that, all right?\n\n00:54:40.334 --> 00:54:43.564\n\nIf you dig up wetlands, don\\'t\n\nyou have a remedy for that?\n\n00:54:43.564 --> 00:54:44.397\n\n- Yes, yeah, that\\'s what I\\'m--\n\n00:54:44.397 --> 00:54:46.040\n\n- Okay, so if you dig up a place\n\n00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:48.250\n\nwhere there are certain\n\nfish that are protected\n\n00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:50.140\n\nor certain trees that are protected\n\n00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:51.370\n\ndon\\'t you have a remedy\n\n00:54:51.370 --> 00:54:54.730\n\nand it includes potential\n\ncriminal prosecution, right?\n\n00:54:54.730 --> 00:54:58.040\n\nOr potential violation or\n\nwithdrawal of your permit.\n\n00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:01.140\n\nThere are penalties for\n\nall of this misbehavior.\n\n00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:04.490\n\nNow we don\\'t, we want\n\npeople to do the right thing\n\n00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:08.743\n\nbut when they don\\'t, there\\'s\n\na consequence to misbehavior.\n\n00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:13.120\n\n- The fear is that graves\n\nare being encountered\n\n00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:15.160\n\nwhen homes are being excavated?\n\n00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:16.220\n\n- [Harry] Oh, we know that.\n\n00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:17.060\n\nWe absolutely know that.\n\n00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:18.730\n\n- And no one\\'s being notified?\n\n00:55:18.730 --> 00:55:19.570\n\n- [Harry] No one\\'s being notified.\n\n00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:20.790\n\n- Not even the M.E.\n\n00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:21.960\n\n- [Harry] Not even the M.E.\n\n00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:25.260\n\n- Yeah, so I mean, we have\n\nto enforce that somehow.\n\n00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:26.093\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- Why don\\'t we look\n\n00:55:26.093 --> 00:55:27.040\n\nat the laws that are on the books.\n\n00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:28.830\n\nJohn, what are you finding here?\n\n00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:30.690\n\n- You know, this is total news to me\n\n00:55:30.690 --> 00:55:32.750\n\nso I wanna research this and find out\n\n00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:35.790\n\nwhat we have here as far as the law goes.\n\n00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:37.310\n\n- Isn\\'t it just common sense\n\n00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:38.684\n\nif you dig up bones--\n\n00:55:38.684 --> 00:55:41.110\n\n- How come you didn\\'t know this\n\n00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:42.218\n\nbefore when you first came here?\n\n00:55:42.218 --> 00:55:44.180\n\n- You know too, the Tribal\n\nCouncil has changed too\n\n00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:46.160\n\nat Shinnecock.\n\n- This has nothing to do\n\n00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:47.280\n\nwith the Tribal Council.\n\n00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:49.673\n\nThis has absolutely nothing\n\nto do with the Tribal Council.\n\n00:55:49.673 --> 00:55:52.756\n\n(bright flute music)\n\n00:56:03.989 --> 00:56:06.406\n\n(soft music)\n\n00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:47.993\n\n- Pesha, can you go hand\n\nme her belt, please?\n\n00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:52.115\n\nLace \\'em up.\n\n00:56:52.115 --> 00:56:52.948\n\nGive me five, give me 10.\n\n00:56:52.948 --> 00:56:54.324\n\nThere we go.\n\n00:56:54.324 --> 00:56:58.783\n\n- Oh, check you out.\n\n- Turn this way, let me see.\n\n00:56:59.845 --> 00:57:01.200\n\n- You coming back with more?\n\n00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.146\n\nChief Little Fox, you\\'re\n\nin the same space.\n\n00:57:03.146 --> 00:57:03.979\n\nOkay, hi.\n\n00:57:04.868 --> 00:57:05.868\n\n- Mary-Anne.\n\n00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:24.050\n\n- My grandfather was one of the cofounders\n\n00:57:24.050 --> 00:57:26.280\n\nwho began the powwow.\n\n00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:29.810\n\nHe had a vision that it was going to\n\n00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:31.735\n\nbring the people together.\n\n00:57:31.735 --> 00:57:35.568\n\n(singing in foreign language)\n\n00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:49.150\n\n- From Nassau County to Suffolk\n\n00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:51.920\n\nwhere a grim discovery\n\nhappened in the Hamptons.\n\n00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:54.730\n\nHuman remains found at a construction site\n\n00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:56.097\n\nin Shinnecock Hills.\n\n00:57:56.097 --> 00:57:57.870\n\nNow the remains were taken to the office\n\n00:57:57.870 --> 00:58:00.590\n\nof the Suffolk County Medical Examiner.\n\n00:58:00.590 --> 00:58:03.260\n\n- We became very defensive\n\nwhen we saw officers\n\n00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:05.580\n\ngoing down there with shovels and sifters.\n\n00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:07.190\n\nThat was very offensive.\n\n00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:08.543\n\n- Yeah, they were\n\ntreating it like a crime.\n\n00:58:08.543 --> 00:58:10.360\n\n- They was treating it like a crime scene.\n\n00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:11.650\n\nI didn\\'t even wanna pull it out\n\n00:58:11.650 --> 00:58:14.980\n\nbecause I\\'m afraid that\n\nI\\'m gonna damage something.\n\n00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:18.950\n\n- I don\\'t wanna see it turn\n\ninto a long thing that--\n\n00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:19.783\n\n- I\\'m sorry.\n\n00:58:19.783 --> 00:58:22.739\n\n- As an archeologically sensitive site\n\n00:58:22.739 --> 00:58:24.850\n\nif it meets CPF, we don\\'t know yet.\n\n00:58:24.850 --> 00:58:26.460\n\n- Construction is being halted\n\n00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:28.450\n\nin parts of Southampton this morning.\n\n00:58:28.450 --> 00:58:30.370\n\nThe state\\'s asking Southampton Town\n\n00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:33.431\n\nto consult with members of\n\nthe Shinnecock Indian Nation.\n\n00:58:33.431 --> 00:58:35.848\n\n(soft music)\n\n00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:41.310\n\n- It\\'s very hard to\n\nsee what the profile is\n\n00:58:41.310 --> 00:58:45.970\n\nbecause it\\'s all different\n\nbecause it\\'s all been disturbed.\n\n00:58:45.970 --> 00:58:48.160\n\nSo things are falling\n\ndown on top of each other.\n\n00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:52.220\n\nI can\\'t get a good look at\n\nwhat the soil even looks like.\n\n00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:54.510\n\nCharcoal down there\n\nfalling out of the wall.\n\n00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:55.499\n\n- [Lance] Yeah, it looks\n\nlike it\\'s charcoal.\n\n00:58:55.499 --> 00:58:57.390\n\n- Which could have something\n\nto do with the burial.\n\n00:58:57.390 --> 00:58:58.370\n\n- [Lance] Looks like it, looks like--\n\n00:58:58.370 --> 00:59:03.370\n\n- You could probably date,\n\ndo carbon-14 on the charcoal.\n\n00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:05.720\n\nTypically you find fresh water, so.\n\n00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:07.330\n\n- It\\'s right here.\n\n- It\\'s right there.\n\n00:59:07.330 --> 00:59:10.581\n\n- Shinnecock Bay was fresh\n\nwater until the hurricane.\n\n00:59:10.581 --> 00:59:13.164\n\n(vociferating)\n\n00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:16.230\n\n- Members of the Shinnecock\n\nTribe in Southampton\n\n00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:19.220\n\nare fighting to protect the\n\ngraves of their ancestors.\n\n00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:21.330\n\nRebecca Genia tells me she believes\n\n00:59:21.330 --> 00:59:23.560\n\nthe remains are likely\n\nthree centuries old.\n\n00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:25.790\n\n- The Suffolk County\n\nHomicide kept telling us\n\n00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:28.840\n\nwe have to make sure\n\nit\\'s not an MS-13 murder.\n\n00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:32.303\n\nSo it was kinda like almost\n\ninsulting from day one.\n\n00:59:48.155 --> 00:59:50.720\n\nKonstantin, the home owner,\n\n00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:53.970\n\nunearthing this grave, he\n\ndid not take very lightly\n\n00:59:53.970 --> 00:59:56.070\n\nand he comes from a country\n\n00:59:56.070 --> 00:59:59.660\n\nwhere there\\'s war torn, mass burials.\n\n00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:04.163\n\nSo he was very sensitive to this site.\n\n01:00:07.090 --> 01:00:09.530\n\nWe asked the Community Preservation Fund\n\n01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:11.630\n\nto possibly make the offer\n\n01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:12.810\n\nso we can put it back\n\n01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:15.972\n\nas much as a natural\n\nstate as we possibly can,\n\n01:00:15.972 --> 01:00:20.013\n\nyou know, after all of this destruction.\n\n01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:36.663\n\n- Why is that?\n\n01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.820\n\nYou guys promised that you\n\nwere gonna take care of this\n\n01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:45.010\n\nand now you\\'re canceling the meeting.\n\n01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:46.560\n\nYou know, he\\'s in a bad position.\n\n01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.570\n\nNow he\\'s having problems with his lender\n\n01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:52.060\n\n\\'cause his lender saw this in the paper.\n\n01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:54.630\n\nSo, you know, now they\n\ncould call the loan on him\n\n01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:57.140\n\n\\'cause he hasn\\'t started, he stopped.\n\n01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:59.540\n\nYou know, I don\\'t know\n\nwhat to do at this point.\n\n01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:01.473\n\nAll right, bye.\n\n01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.390\n\nThe day you were there,\n\n01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:06.850\n\nyou heard everything you needed to hear\n\n01:01:06.850 --> 01:01:08.567\n\nwhen they said \\\"What,\n\ndo you want us to buy\n\n01:01:08.567 --> 01:01:10.410\n\n\\\"every piece that had bones on it?\\\"\n\n01:01:10.410 --> 01:01:11.930\n\nI mean, you heard.\n\n01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:13.330\n\nWe should\\'ve known in the beginning\n\n01:01:13.330 --> 01:01:14.380\n\nwhere that was going.\n\n01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:18.973\n\n- [Konstantin] Call Becky, I\n\nneed their blessing to start.\n\n01:01:22.779 --> 01:01:24.980\n\n- Hey, how are ya?\n\n01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:26.770\n\nThey canceled the meeting.\n\n01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:28.490\n\nThey don\\'t wanna get in a battle right now\n\n01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:31.310\n\n\\'cause they know the powwow\\'s going on.\n\n01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:32.630\n\nAnd what they\\'re gonna do is\n\n01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:34.210\n\nthey\\'ll say there\\'s not enough money\n\n01:01:34.210 --> 01:01:35.780\n\nor didn\\'t appraise high enough\n\n01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:37.650\n\nand they\\'re gonna try to throw it\n\n01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:39.960\n\nas Konstantin, the bad builder.\n\n01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:41.520\n\nMeanwhile, he\\'s willing to sell\n\n01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.653\n\nfor exactly what he has into it.\n\n01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:48.760\n\nI mean, it\\'s probably half\n\na million dollars, you know,\n\n01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:52.878\n\nand they\\'ve spent billions,\n\nalmost, in that fund.\n\n01:01:52.878 --> 01:01:55.810\n\n- [Rebecca] I can feel\n\nit slipping already.\n\n01:01:55.810 --> 01:01:58.650\n\n- I will just take\n\nexcavator there tomorrow\n\n01:01:58.650 --> 01:02:01.293\n\nand if it\\'s nothing\n\nresolved then we\\'ll start.\n\n01:02:01.293 --> 01:02:03.710\n\n(soft music)\n\n01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:09.980\n\n- Their offer is what it is\n\n01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:14.980\n\nand there\\'s still $185,000 that\n\nhe\\'s put into this project.\n\n01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:18.700\n\nYes.\n\n01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.150\n\nThat\\'s the amount he\\'s short.\n\n01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.920\n\nYou know, we\\'re trying to do this.\n\n01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:28.210\n\nI need support from everybody to call him\n\n01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:30.670\n\nand say, look we are\n\ngoing to raise this money.\n\n01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:32.623\n\nWe\\'re gonna do this.\n\n01:02:36.490 --> 01:02:39.880\n\nKonstantine wants to come back Tuesday\n\n01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.200\n\nand finish his project.\n\n01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.300\n\nThe worse case scenario,\n\n01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:46.110\n\nlet\\'s say he\\'s allowed\n\nto come back in here\n\n01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:47.190\n\nand he said, okay--\n\n01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:48.370\n\n- I will monitor.\n\n01:02:48.370 --> 01:02:50.611\n\n- Okay.\n\n- I can watch.\n\n01:02:50.611 --> 01:02:51.930\n\nThe problem with monitoring\n\n01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:55.240\n\nis the backhoe gets to\n\nit before you can see it.\n\n01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:59.519\n\nSo even if you say stop, which they stop,\n\n01:02:59.519 --> 01:03:01.580\n\nthings are already disturbed.\n\n01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:02.413\n\n- Right.\n\n01:03:11.032 --> 01:03:11.957\n\nYou know, it is an emergency\n\n01:03:11.957 --> 01:03:13.700\n\nand the last text I sent you\n\n01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:15.824\n\nI said why can\\'t we purchase the land\n\n01:03:15.824 --> 01:03:18.483\n\nand put in land, into trust.\n\n01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:22.820\n\nIt\\'s ours, we can own it\n\nand put it into trust.\n\n01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:24.800\n\n- My question is who\n\nwill control the land?\n\n01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:25.633\n\n- Us.\n\n01:03:25.633 --> 01:03:28.440\n\nWe will draw up a contract where\n\nwe\\'re stewards of the land.\n\n01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.410\n\nThey don\\'t want another thing to do.\n\n01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:32.760\n\nThey\\'ve proposed this in the past to us\n\n01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:35.840\n\nand not your board of trustees\n\nbut other boards of trustees.\n\n01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.210\n\nPlease read this, please read this,\n\n01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:38.400\n\nplease read this, please.\n\n01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:39.810\n\nA year, two,

developing to come here\n\n01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:50.139\n\nso he can hear it from\n\nsomeone else besides me.\n\n01:03:50.139 --> 01:03:50.972\n\n- Okay.\n\n01:03:50.972 --> 01:03:52.442\n\nAll right, we gotta find some more money.\n\n01:03:52.442 --> 01:03:53.275\n\n- Yep.\n\n01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:01.950\n\nWe\\'re trying to get the man all the money.\n\n01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:03.830\n\nHe needs all of his money back\n\n01:04:03.830 --> 01:04:06.433\n\nand he deserves to have\n\nall of his money back.\n\n01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:10.640\n\nAnd that should be no question.\n\n01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:13.870\n\nBut it\\'s always got to\n\nbe the native people\n\n01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:17.225\n\nwho stand up and begin something good.\n\n01:04:17.225 --> 01:04:19.080\n\n(baby babbles)\n\n01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:21.497\n\n(soft music)\n\n01:04:30.148 --> 01:04:33.350\n\n(rhythmic drum music)\n\n01:04:33.350 --> 01:04:35.750\n\n- Good afternoon, ladies and

01:04:53.330\n\nfeels very strongly\n\nthat this piece of land\n\n01:04:53.330 --> 01:04:55.300\n\nshould be returned to the tribe.\n\n01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:58.320\n\nWe call upon you to stand with

relationship\n\n01:07:37.410 --> 01:07:39.540\n\nbetween Shinnecock and Southampton.\n\n01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:42.600\n\n- We are concerned about our\n\nhouse on a private street\n\n01:07:42.600 -->

--> 01:08:05.460\n\nthe last time this happens.\n\n01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:09.660\n\nSo I really hope that there are policies\n\n01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:11.170\n\nand protocols put in place\n\n01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:13.270\n\nfor the next time.\n\n01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:14.973\n\n- Anyone else on the motion?\n\n01:08:16.032 --> 01:08:16.865\n\nI\\'ll call the vote.\n\n01:08:16.865

01:08:59.120\n\n- No more accidental unearthing.\n\n01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:01.500\n\nThere\\'s no such thing.\n\n01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.681\n\nI\\'d do a jig but my legs hurt.\n\n01:09:03.681 -->
