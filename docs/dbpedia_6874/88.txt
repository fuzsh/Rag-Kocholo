RADIO ONLINE | Thursday, December 1, 2022

WXKB-FM (B103.9)/Fort Myers, in collaboration with The Salvation Army of Lee County, will collect toys to benefit Southwest Florida's Families during the B1039 Stuff-A-Bus Toy Drive. The station will broadcast live from a SWFL Waste Management Truck located on site at the Wal-Mart on Tamiami Trail in Estero, FL from 6-10am on Friday, December 9. Air personalities will encourage listeners and businesses to stop by and donate a bike and toys to benefit children residing throughout the local community.

"Santa can use a little help sometimes, and our communities are full of the Christmas Spirit," said Budman from The Wild Bunch. "I know we'll make Santa proud by spreading Holiday magic and joy to the kids of Southwest Florida."

"Christmas is all about the kids and with the last few months, especially, being difficult for so many families in SWFL, we are excited to spread the joy of the holiday season," added Marija from The Wild Bunch. "There's nothing like seeing the face of child light up at the sight of gifts under the tree and we're happy to help make that a reality for kids in our community this year."
