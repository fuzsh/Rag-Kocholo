        "text": "Radio Babe recently met with Clear Channel Sarasota's new vice president/ marketing manager Sherri Carlson, and marketing consultant Linda McKnight, who shared info on the corporation's local doings.\n\nTheir biggest interest is the new 105.9 FM, now called \"The Buzz,\" the call letters for which, WTZB, have been approved by the Federal Communication Commission. Its old call letters, WSRQ, were transferred to the former WSPB (1450 AM), which simulcasts WFLA (970 AM).\n\nAnd construction of its Web site, www.1059theBuzz.com, has begun.\n\nBy the time you read this, the Buzz's DJs will be on air (such as assistant program director and afternoon drive guy Ron Miller), and \"Bob & Tom\" doing mornings. The actual program director, Ron White, does double duty as (Oldies 108) WSRZ (107.9 FM)'s PD, too.\n\nAs for CC's move into its new facility at 1779 Independence Blvd., Sarasota, that hasn't occurred yet. But it's imminent and includes the entire cluster of stations -- WAMR (1320 AM), WCTQ (106.5 FM), WDDV (92.1 FM), WSRQ (1450 FM), WTZB and WSRZ -- not just the Sarasota-based stations, as had been previously reported.\n\nCOMMUNICATION BREAKDOWNS -- The CC women and R.B. also discussed how most networks/outlets are guilty of information dissemination ineptitude, as evidenced by the following info bytes:\n\nR.B. discovered in April 16's newsletter Radio Ink that Sarasota's WJIS (88.1 FM The Joy FM) hired new promotions director Andrea Kleid at its noncommercial contemporary Christian station.\n\nIn Internet radio news mi2n's March 26 issue, R.B. read about Beasley Broadcast Group's new Southwest Florida regional business manager Shane Reilly and assistant business manager Melinda Lang, who'll hold down the WRXK (96.1 FM), WXKB (103.9 FM), WJBX (99.3 FM), WJPT (106.3 FM) and WWCN (770 AM) Fort Myers/Naples cluster stations.\n\nAnd in the April 15 ALLACCESS report, she found out that CC/WYNF's long-gone gravel-voiced Bob Garrett moved from CC/WEBN in Cincinnati to Beasley's Fort Myers alternative rocker WJBX (99.3 FM 99X).\n\nEven more ironic is that he teams with another former CC/WYNF'er, Jeff Zito, on the new \"Zito & Garrett\" morning show. How quaint.\n\nGood thing R.B. gets those reports from out-of-state so she can find out what's going on in the area.\n\nODOM BLUNDER -- R.B. also found out that her recent reference to Fort Myers' WOLZ (95.3 FM) jock B.J. Odom being fired while on leave for heart transplant surgery was based on bad information.\n\nShe found the item in radio news source ALLACCESS, which had taken its information from the Fort Myers News-Press. What ALLACCESS -- and R.B. -- didn't find was a later News-Press retraction.\n\nFortunately, WOLZ's vice president Jim Keating caught the blunder. And after communiqués with him and Odom, the truth is that Odom is still a Clear Channel employee, but since he could be out for nine months or more, the station canceled the \"BJ & Bill\" morning show -- and canned Bill (Official word: \"Bill was not retained because we didn't have another position to move him into.\")\n\nAs for BJ, he says he's \"feeling stronger every day. And life is good. The anti-rejection drugs make you feel a little wired, but the newfound energy and to be alive is more than worth the side effects.\" He also says that he's on CC's payroll thanks to the Family Leave Act, but they have an option to release him after May 8 and he's waiting to see what happens.\n\nE-RADIO WEEKLY -- Arbitron uses MeasureCast to \"measure\" Internet radio audience trends in units called TTSL -- total time spent listening.\n\nIn March, the top three stations based on \"the sum total of hours tuned by listeners to a given station or network\" were RadioioEcelectic (www.radioio.com/radioioeclectic; subscriptions are $3/month and up) with 1,354,007 hours TTSL, MUSICMATCH ArtistMatch (via www.musicmatch.com/home.htm; $2.95/month and up) with 1,328,508 hours TTSL, and Virgin Radio (www.virginradio.co.uk; free) with 1,316,963 hours TTSL.\n\nBoth Radioio and MusicMatch have free radio streams, however the top-rated stations were the subscription-based services.\n\nWrite to Radio Babe c/o the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, P.O.
