        "text": "Pet Spider Murder: Florida Woman Arrested for Drowning Arachnid In Ginger Ale\n\nOnly in Florida does someone end up in trouble with the law over a tiny pet spider. A Florida woman named Ilena Rasmussen got herself an animal cruelty charge for killing a spider. Now, I’m not a fan of any sort of eight-legged freak show. But, this was her roommate’s pet jumping spider. Sure, keeping little spiders as pets may seem kind of weird, but it’s still someone’s pet nonetheless.\n\nAccording to WKYT, the roommate comes home one day, checks the tank, and her beloved pet spider is gone. It’s nowhere to be found. Naturally, she freaks out—because who wouldn’t be upset over a missing $70 spider, right? So, she confronts her Ilena about it. And what does Ilena do? She comes clean like it’s no big deal. Admits she drowned the poor little guy in ginger ale. Yes, death by ginger ale. I can’t think of a worse drink to suffer by… Not a soda like Coke, Dr. Pepper or an Orange Crush… No. Ginger ale. And now there’s a spider in it. Gross.\n\nPet Spider Slayer:\n\nNow, why’d she do it? Your guess is as good as mine. Maybe the spider gave her the side-eye, or maybe she just had a grudge against anything that gave her the creeps. Either way, the spider didn’t stand a chance against the Canadian-made beverage.\n\nThe authorities didn’t take too kindly to this little act of pet spider slaying. They slapped her with a misdemeanor animal cruelty charge. This Florida woman now has to answer for this tiny murder, plus they’re getting her on petty theft, too. Maybe that ginger ale wasn’t hers either.\n\nSo now, Ilena’s looking for a new place to live, and her roommate’s mourning a pet spider while sipping on ginger ale. It’s all very sad.\n\nMeet Budman, dynamic host of Marconi Award winning radio station WXKB's WiLD Bunch Morning Show, on B1039.
