        "text": "From beaver nuggets to beef jerky, the love for Buc-ee’s is real and the chain has plans to continue their Florida expansion with talks of an exciting new location.\n\nSadly for us here in Fort Myers, there’s no Buc-ee’s close by. The closest location to us is in Daytona Beach, with another in St. Augustine. There are plans for a location in Marion County, which is getting closer to us, but not close enough. But there are talks about yet another location, however, that’s not nearby either. Great for road tripping though. There hasn’t been any sort of official announcement, it looks like the site they’re eyeing is in Fort Pierce on the Treasure Coast.\n\nThere was a pre-application meeting at the end of July, and while the name “Buc-ee’s” wasn’t specifically mentioned, Benjamin Balcer with the Planning and Development Services Department, told the TCPalm that “it was understood at the meeting what it was.” A conceptual drawing shows a 73,000 square foot retail space, 733 parking spots, 11 bus parking spots and 120 fueling gas pumps.\n\nWhy do people love Buc-ee’s so much?\n\nBuc-ee’s is so much more than your average gas station or rest stop. From Beaver Nuggets and beef jerky to monster bags of gummy bears, there’s plenty of snacks. If you’re hungry for more, you can sink your teeth into juicy brisket sandwiches, smoked sausages and comfort foods like mac ‘n’ cheese and loaded baked potatoes. Deciding what to pick is the hard part. They also have thee most fun merch line. From cozy hoodies with the iconic beaver logo to things you never knew you needed like a beaver-shaped ice cube tray, there’s no shortage of quirky souvenirs.\n\nWhile I’m excited for a new Buc-ee’s location in Florida, I’m still clinging to the hope that one day, ONE DAY, we’ll get one here in SWFL.\n\nThe Buc-ee's In Ocala Will Be Full Of Weird Things. Here's 10 Of Our Favorites\n\nMarija is a morning show host on WXKB/B1039 and midday host on WRXK/96KRock. She loves to write about food, travel, and things to do around the state of Florida."
