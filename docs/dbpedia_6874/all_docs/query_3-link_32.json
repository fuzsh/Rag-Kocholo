        "text": "A 4th Buc-ee’s Location Could Be Coming To Florida\n\nIf there’s a gas station that is talked about more than any other it’s Buc-ee’s and a 4th location could be coming to Florida.\n\nFor as much traveling as I do, shockingly, I’ve never been to a Buc-ee’s. I know, I know. But there isn’t a location in Fort Myers, nor do I do much road tripping. I much prefer to fly. My brother used to be in a touring blues band, and it was when he was on the road that his love affair with Buc-ee’s began. He’s a BBQ fanatic, and stands firm on Buc-ee’s having the best brisket he’s found so far. I have a friend that will go out of her way on any trip to make sure she can stop for a bag of beaver nuggets and possibly even a new t-shirt. I think I saw her with an inflatable Buc-ee’s Christmas decoration now that I think about it.\n\nA 4th Buc-ee’s Location Could Be Coming To Florida\n\nSo far, there are 2 Buc-ee’s locations here in the Sunshine State: Daytona Beach and St. Augustine. It was announced last year the world’s largest Buc-ee’s will be built in Ocala and open in 2025. This one will be massive with over 100 gas pumps. It will be over 6,000 square feet larger than the current world’s largest located in Tennessee. And now, a 4th location could be coming. According to WFLA, this week the company submitted plans for another east coast location in Port St. Lucie.\n\nNext, I’m hoping we hear of a location coming to Southwest Florida!\n\nThe Buc-ee's In Ocala Will Be Full Of Weird Things. Here's 10 Of Our Favorites\n\nMarija is a morning show host on WXKB/B1039 and midday host on WRXK/96KRock. She loves to write about food, travel, and things to do around the state of Florida."
