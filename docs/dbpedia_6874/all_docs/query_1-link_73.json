Before signing on with Beasley to do nights on 99X WJBX in June 2008, he programmed two stations on the West Coast, and hosted a Night Show in Minneapolis and a Morning Show in Philadelphia. Previously, he was an on-air personality in Tampa and Fort Myers, Florida.\n\nThe radio bug bit him early on, in 1983, when he was backstage at The Bull Run Jamboree in Virginia with his step dad who was popular D.C. Country Jock. He grew up a radio kid, and by the age of 21 was hosting his own show and controlling the airwaves over Dayton, Ohio.\n\nBig Mama is the creator of Reality Radio, launched the RadioDorm in 2006, and is currently the designer of the first ever video platform exclusively for radio stations."
