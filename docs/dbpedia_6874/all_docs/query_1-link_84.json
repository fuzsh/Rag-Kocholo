        "text": "WPCU-TV[]\n\nNot to be confused with the real life telvision station WPSU-TV.\n\nFor the UPN-affiliated TV station that currently uses the former call sign of this station, see WPCU.\n\n1950-1954[]\n\nThe station first made its on-air debut on September 12, 1950 at 5:15 pm as WPCU-TV, the third commercial television station in Plotagon City after WIER-TV (channel 8, which debuted on July 5, 1949) and WKBA-TV (channel 10, which debuted on October 5, 1947). Originally owned by Ursula Broadcast System, which also owned radio stations WPCU-AM (902 AM) and WPCU-FM (93.9 FM), WPCU-TV was the DuMont Television Network affiliate for the Plotagon market, taking over its affiliation from WKBA-TV. WPCU-TV then took over the full-time NBC affiliation in 1952, after WKBA-TV decided to become a full-time affiliate of rival network ABC that year, resulting in DuMont being relegated to a secondary affiliate.\n\n1954-1962[]\n\nLOGO MISSING\n\nIn 1954, NBC decided to affiliate with WZOA-TV (channel 7, now Fox affiliate WKPL), as its sister radio station had long been an affiliate of the NBC Red Network. The switch in affiliation occurred on March 3, 1954, with WKPL becoming a full-time NBC affiliate and WPCU-TV becoming an independent station, the second in the Plotagon market after the first two independent stations in the market, the combination of WDQ-TV and WXAW-TV (channel 14, now merged into WDAP-TV as the sole occupant of the channel 14 frequency, until it became current NBC affiliate WYAK-TV since 1996).\n\nWPUT-TV[]\n\n1962-1970[]\n\nLOGO MISSING\n\nIn July 1961, Ursula Broadcast System announced it would sell WPCU-TV to the non-profit group Plotagon University of Television, a subsidiary of Plotagonia State University for $29.5 million, under the condition of a 5-month sign-off period to transition from a commercial to a public TV station. The FCC approved the transfer in September of the same year, and changed Channel 2's license to non-commercial, with the transfer becoming final on November 18. On January 12, 1962, after 5 months of preparation for the station's sign-off, WPCU-TV was relaunched as the first educational station in Plotagon City under the new call sign WPUT-TV (to reflect the abbreviation of the station's owner). Initially operating as an independent, non-commercial educational station, WPUT-TV later joined National Educational Television (NET) as an affiliate in 1964.\n\n1970-1974[]\n\n1974-1981[]\n\n1981-1993[]\n\nLOGO MISSING\n\n1993-2016[]\n\n1993-1995[]\n\n1995-2012[]\n\nIn 1995, the PBS logo (included in a circle) was added to the station's logo, becoming the first station (and technically, the first PBS station) to carry the PBS logo in a circle.\n\n2012-2016[]\n\nJanuary-March 2016[]\n\nWPPB[]\n\nMarch 2016-present[]\n\nMarch 2016-2019[]\n\nOn March 19, 2016, two months after the station's parent company changed its name to Plotagon Public Broadcasting, WPUT-TV changed its callsign to the current WPPB to reflect the station owner's new name. A new logo (which was a slight revision of WPUT-TV's previous logo with only the station's callsign changed) was also introduced along with a rebranding of the station's callsign.\n\n2019-present[]"
