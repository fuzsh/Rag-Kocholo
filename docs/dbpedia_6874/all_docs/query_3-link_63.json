        "text": "We’re so lucky to live in paradise, a place where other people come to vacation, and 2 Southwest Florida cities have made a list of ideal destinations for a 3 day weekend in 2024.\n\nLiving in Florida has so many perks. We have year-round warm weather, we have beautiful beaches that are just a short drive away, there are outdoor events that never have to be put on pause (other than maybe being interrupted by an afternoon thunderstorm in the summer), pub subs, and the fact that you can jump in the car and be to the other coast in a matter of a few hours. I love exploring around the state of Florida, whether it be visiting it the bigger cities like Miami and Tampa, or smaller coastal towns full of charm.\n\nWhether you’re from out of town, or a local, there are 2 Southwest Florida cities that have made a list of idea destinations for a 3 day weekend in 2024.\n\n2 Southwest Florida Cities Make List Of Ideal Destinations For A 3 Day Weekend In 2024\n\nWhile I love a week-long vacation somewhere, there is no denying that a 3 day weekend is great for getting out of town for a few days. It’s a perfect amount of time to check out a new place, and if it’s one you fall in love with, or find yourself needing more time to get in everything there is to do, you can always go back again, or for longer.\n\nWorldAtlas put out their list of 12 ideal Florida destinations for a 3-day weekend in 2024 and 2 Southwest Florida cities made the list. The first city is Naples. Some of my favorite things in Naples are the botanical garden and strolling down 5th Avenue South. In the article they mention both in fact, including restaurants like Aqua, Bice and Hobnob. The other city mentioned is one of our beautiful islands, Sanibel. While they’re still rebuilding after Hurricane Ian, the beaches are beautiful and there are lots of bars and restaurants that have opened and new things continue to pop up all the time. Of course, the article mentions shelling and the historic lighthouse.\n\nTo check out the full list for 3 day weekend getaway ideas in the state of Florida, click here\n\nMarija is a morning show host on WXKB/B1039 and midday host on WRXK/96KRock.
