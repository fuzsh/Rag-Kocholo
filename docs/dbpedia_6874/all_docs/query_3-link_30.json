        "text": "No joke, I had to scroll all the way down to number 139 on the list to find a city in Florida listed. And then the surprise of – Miami Beach? According to their findings, Miami Beach has a 95% affordability with a monthly homeowner cost of $3,634. But this is Miami Beach, right? Well, you can buy a house there, but perhaps it’s a bit shy of the “dream home” you may have planned on. Here’s a cozy 640 square foot, well, it’s essentially a walk in closet with a bathroom, that you can get for $300,000.\n\nhttps://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/1211-Pennsylvania-Ave-Apt-C2_Miami-Beach_FL_33139_M50681-82371?from=srp-list-card\n\nI actually know someone who moved from Southwest Florida to go to Jacksonville to save money. With just over 94% relative affordability and a monthly homeowner cost of $3,811, he was quite happy with his move. J-Ville is a much bigger city, so you’ll need to be extra cautious of the neighborhood you buy in to, but there’s some affordability here. I found this one for less than $300K and $13 a month HOA.\n\nhttps://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/7600-Pilgrims-Trace-Dr_Jacksonville_FL_32244_M61016-56135?from=srp-list-card\n\nSo where does Southwest Florida end up on this list? Not good. But we already knew that. Cape Coral comes in at number 452 on the list. There are 451 other cities in America that are cheaper to live. The relative affordability is 90% and the monthly homeowner cost is $5,253. Let’s scroll down to number 460 on the list. Fort Myers. A similar relative affordability with a monthly homeowner cost of $5,298.\n\nLet’s go up the coast a bit. Bradenton is at number 560. Their monthly homeowner cost is $6,015. Sarasota is number 606. It’s $6,401 a month to live there.\n\nBonita Springs. Number 686 on the list. A relative affordability of 83% and a monthly homeowner cost of $7,760. You know some of those expensive little towns in California? Bonita Springs is right there with them.\n\nWhere’s Naples? The population cutoff on this list was 50,000 people, so Naples wasn’t surveyed. But I’m sure it would not have been good."
