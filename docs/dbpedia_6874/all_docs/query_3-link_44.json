        "text": "If you’re a cookie lover, get ready because a new Crumbl Cookies location is coming to Fort Myers.\n\nIt was more than a few months back I had heard a rumor that Fort Myers was getting a Crumbl Cookies. There are already locations in Naples and Cape Coral. So it makes sense that this popular cookie spot will soon be coming to Fort Myers as well. I reached out to the company back in September to either confirm or deny what I had heard. The response I got said that they do have a store tentatively set to open there, but that they were still in the early stages of planning and permitting. But we now have more info.\n\nCrumbl Cookies Is Coming To Fort Myers\n\nThe store is located at 7925 Dani Drive #130. And the official opening date of Crumbl Cookies is March 8th. According to a press release, on opening day the store will be open from 8am to midnight and cookie lovers are invited to come out to be part of the celebration which will include balloons, free merch and photo ops.\n\nAlso, be sure to download the Crumbl App to participate in a special Grand Opening 30-day promotion using promo code FLFTMYERS. With that, starting on March 11th, you can get a free chocolate chip cookie at the Fort Myers location.\n\nIf you’ve never been to a Crumbl or don’t know that much about it, it is definitely a spot to try. They have weekly rotating lineup of cookies, so the variety is always different. This week for instance: brownie batter, old fashioned doughnut, strawberry cake, cornbread, and blue monster. YUM!\n\nYou can find a list of all their locations and their weekly cookie lineup here\n\nThe Best Local Cuisine Restaurants In Southwest Florida\n\nMarija is a morning show host on WXKB/B1039 and midday host on WRXK/96KRock.
