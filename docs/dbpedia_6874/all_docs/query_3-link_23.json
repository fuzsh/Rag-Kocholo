        "text": "Dear Radio Babe: How many stations are in Sarasota? -- I.W.\n\nDear I. Dub: What a perfectly straightforward question! In fact, the simplicity of it prevents Radio Babe from providing a clear-cut answer.\n\nHow so? Well, a radio station may be licensed in a particular city but could be located elsewhere. For example, WTZB (105.9 FM) is licensed in Englewood, but its studio is in Sarasota.\n\nOr, a station may be located in one city, yet might be considered part of a different radio market altogether -- such as WHPT (102.5 FM), which is licensed and transmits from Sarasota, but its studio is in St. Petersburg.\n\nIf, in asking about Sarasota stations, you sought stations with studios physically located in Sarasota, the answer is 10: WJIS (88.1 FM), WSMR (89.1 FM), WLTQ (92.1 FM), WTZB (105.9 FM), WCTQ (106.5 FM), WSRZ (107.9 FM), WSRQ (1220 AM), WTMY (1280 AM), WDDV (1320 AM) and WSDV (1450 AM).\n\nTen stations -- technically, nine plus a \"translator\" (a device simulcasting a distant station) -- list their city of FCC license as Sarasota. They are: WSMR, WSLR 96.5 (FM-LP), the WYFO translator at 97.3 FM, WHPT (102.5 FM), WKZM (104.3 FM), WCTQ, WLSS (930 AM), WSRQ, WTMY and WSDV.\n\nThe actual Sarasota/Bradenton radio market consists of 17 stations: WJIS, WSMR, WSEB (91.3 FM), WLTQ, WSLR, WKZM, WTZB, WCTQ, WSRZ, WLSS, WSRQ, WTMY, WDDV, WBRD (1420 AM), WSDV, WWPR (1490 AM) and WENG (1530 AM).\n\nBear in mind, however, that the definition of a \"radio market\" is tenuous.\n\nOne school of thought assigned by the Arbitron ratings company places stations into specific city-market groupings by where they're actually heard and/or where a station might identify and align itself within a particular locale (even if not physically being in proximity).\n\nIn another market designation, station signal contours -- the transmitter's coverage radius -- were used to mark boundaries.\n\nIn fact, both market-definition designations are used to skew data by adding and/or subtracting various factors -- such as the true number of stations in a given place, for example, so large corporations might purchase more in an area than they are allowed.\n\nBob, bob, bobbin' along\n\nFort Myers/Naples has a Bob. Not just any Bob, mind you, but a genuine Bob FM format at Renda's WJGO (102.9 FM).\n\nYou may recall the buzz that began with Jack (er, Jack FM, the trademark, and now-brand name, format) in 2005, spreading from Canada to several U.S. cities.\n\nJack FM (and others of these trademarked formats) wiped out entire stations' staff members, supplanting them with recorded joke-y fill-lines and all-music-all-the-time formats, typically adult contemporary hits mixes from the '60s to '90s.\n\nThat spawned \"Dave,\" \"Steve,\" \"Bob\" and other similarly named formats.\n\nNow, 102.9's \"We Play Anything\" tag line is \"new to Southwest Florida,\" it likely won't take long for the novelty to wear thin, as those who've heard it elsewhere already know.\n\nEven WCBS in New York -- the station with the top ratings, which dropped to absolute bottom with Jack FM -- knows, and it's added a few hosted programs with targeted music to woo listeners back.\n\nWatch for new call letters and a Web site redesign. Sign up for a heads-up at www.1029bobfm.com.\n\nSo, what's a 'diva'?\n\nToday, WINK (96.9 FM) will one-up all the one-named stations with its own \"Diva Radio\" starting at 7:30 a.m. when, according to an e-mail and its Web site, \"The fresh new sound of Diva Radio comes to 96.9 FM.\" Its program director wasn't available for comment before press time, so we'll all be surprised together. Lucky us.\n\nA face for radio?\n\nAlong with news that Beasley's WXKB (103.9 FM) jock Drew Steele becomes the new morning drive-time host (6-10 a.m. weekdays) comes an announcement that he'll conduct a \"Star Search,\" of sorts, for a new partner in \"B103.9's Next Radio Star\" contest.\n\nCall (888) FUN-EGOS (386-3467) to record your name and phone number, along with a 60-second message telling Steele why you should be his next co-host.\n\nThe contest plays out over several phases. Good luck.\n\nDirect queries and comments to Radio Babe c/o the Herald-Tribune, P.O. Drawer 1719, Sarasota, FL 34230, or e-mail dawnzig@hotmail .com. Answers will appear in this forum only.
