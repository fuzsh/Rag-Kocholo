        "text": "See How Media Companies Can Improve Their Email Stats Through Segmentation\n\nBy now, just about everyone has begun to recognize the value of email and implemented goals to grow their database. And while you should definitely prioritize building a large email database and effective email capture methods, there is just as much (if not more) value in reaching a small, targeted audience.\n\nWhat is Email Segmentation?\n\nEmail segmentation is the ability to leverage all the consumer data you collect and send specific emails to a group of people who will likely be engaged in an email’s topic.\n\nMost marketing campaigns are judged on click-through and open rates. Sending to a smaller list of users can lead to a much more efficient campaign. This is because you’re eliminating extraneous users who would likely not be interested in the message. When you send irrelevant information to your subscribers, it actually does more harm than good. When a user doesn’t take action on an email, it lowers the results of that specific campaign. Those users are also much more likely to unsubscribe – or worse – report you as spam.\n\nSegmenting your list will:\n\nIncrease your open rates\n\nBoost email subscriber retention\n\nGrow revenue\n\nHow KY3-TV Found the Value of Email Segmentation\n\nThis station from Springfield, Missouri decided to run an A/B test on one of their event emails. They sent 1/3 to a target audience (50 mile radius + interest: country music + concerts) and 2/3 sent to regular ‘offers’ recipients (no targeting).\n\nThe emails sent to the targeted audience earned an 18% open rate (including 2 opt-outs and 2 spam complaints,) while the non-targeted email only received a 6% open rate (including 7 opt-outs and 6 spam complaints.)\n\nOverall, the targeted emails earned 3x better open rate, 3x better click-through rate, and 3x fewer complaints and opt-outs. This proves bigger lists don’t equal better results.\n\nHow to Get Started With Email Segmentation\n\nThe quickest way to get started is segmenting your opt-ins by ZAG (zip code, age, and gender). Most likely, your database already has a lot of this information about each of your consumers. But if you don’t, start adding these questions onto your registration forms. You can also segment your existing opt-ins further with these following parameters:\n\nAge and Gender\n\nDepending on the marketing campaign, you may prefer to limit your messages to a specific age or gender that range that would be the most responsive. Sending a message announcing enrollment for a new intense fitness class may not be suitable for the same audience getting retirement financial advice. Sending an email advertising maternity clothes, pedicures, or a bikini-wax could lead to a male reader unsubscribing from future emails with your company.\n\nCustomer vs Prospect\n\nIf you are selling any kind of prospect or service, it is incredibly important to be able to separate current customers from formers and prospects. This allows you to tailor different messages for retention and acquisition without having to dilute your offers or messaging.\n\nThese five areas may be some of the simplest ways to get started with email segmentation, but you don’t have to end there. The more consumer profile data you collect, the deeper you can dive into email segmentation. And that means the more you can personalize your emails. As you continue sending more relevant messages, users will increasingly look for them and be excited to get these personalized messages. You’ll build trust with your subscribers, and in turn, produce better results for advertisers."
