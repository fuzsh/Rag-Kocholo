        "text": "Days of relocation packages are dwindling away, but Florida nurses can get paid to leave the state.\n\nI’d like to think most people that live in Florida are happy with where we live. I grew up in Chicago and made my way to Fort Myers almost 5 years ago. It’s the best move I ever made and am grateful to live in such a beautiful place. Especially during a week like this one where everyone up north is absolutely freezing. It’s warm year-round, we have beautiful beaches, there’s outdoor activities that occur 12 months of the year. We’re close to many theme parks, cruise ports and flights to islands in the Caribbean are just a few hours long. But there’s also things people might not like about living in the Sunshine State. Alligators, hurricanes, Florida Man, no-see-ums, expensive car insurance, the humidity. So if you’re a nurse here in Florida and have thought about a change of scenery, you can actually get paid to leave.\n\nFlorida Nurses Can Get Paid To Leave The State\n\nNursing is a job I respect so much. Not only is the schooling an arduous process, but having to deal with body fluids and an array of personalities, while having compassion, on a daily basis can’t be easy. Nurses really are the unsung heroes of healthcare. If you’re a nurse in the state of Florida and could use a change, due to high demand, there’s a few places offering pretty incredible singing bonuses. You can find the full list here, but I’ll highlight those paying the most.\n\nIn California, USC Arcadia Hospital is offering up to $40,000. Minnesota is cold, but M Fairview Health is offering up to $50,000. (I lived in North Dakota for a year when I was offered a great paying job. If I can do it for the money, so can you.) In Pennsylvania, St Lukes is offering up to $30,000. Bassett Health in Cooperstown, New York is offering up to $35,000. Some of these offers also include relocation, loan repayment and more.\n\nThe Most Affordable Cities In Florida to Buy a House\n\nMarija is a morning show host on WXKB/B1039 and midday host on WRXK/96KRock.
