        "text": "If you live in the Cape, it’s time to get excited because Mellow Mushroom in Cape Coral has set an opening date.\n\nBeing from Chicago, I feel like I was born with a love for pizza in my blood. While Chicago-style ‘za is my favorite, when it comes to pizza, I like a little bit of everything. How can you go wrong with good dough, delicious sauce, melty cheesy goodness and toppings to your hearts desire? It’s a food that I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone dislike.\n\nHere in Southwest Florida, we have a lot of great pizza. I have to be honest that outside of Fort Myers and Cape Coral, I haven’t gotten to too many pizza spots, but I’m trying to expand beyond my tried and true. My favorite is the Chicago from Chicago Pizza in Cape Coral, but I also really enjoy Downtown House of Pizza, Uncle Rico’s, Mellow Mushroom and Two Meatballs in the Kitchen. And speaking of Mellow Mushroom, a new location is coming to Southwest Florida.\n\nMellow Mushroom In Cape Coral Sets Opening Date\n\nBack in October, construction began on the new Mellow Mushroom in Cape Coral. It will be on Pine Island Road right next door to Gator Mike’s. According to the Mellow Mushroom website, the official opening date will be June 3rd and this will be the 3rd Mellow Mushroom location in Southwest Florida. The other two are in Estero in University Village and Fort Myers right on Daniels by Whole Foods.\n\nWhat to get at Mellow Mushroom In Cape Coral\n\nThey have a lot of fun and funky combinations and one of my favorite pizzas at Mellow Mushroom is the Holy Shiitake. Usually I do like meat on my pizza, but I am a junkie for truffle anything so I had to try it and I keep going back for it. This pizza has a base of olive oil & garlic with a variety of mushrooms, caramelized onions, mozzarella and cheddar cheeses, a garlic aioli swirl and black truffle oil on top. Trust me when I say it is absolutely delicious.\n\nTo check out the menu and for an application, click here\n\nHighest-Rated Pizza Restaurants in Naples in 2023 According to Yelp\n\nMarija is a morning show host on WXKB/B1039 and midday host on WRXK/96KRock.
