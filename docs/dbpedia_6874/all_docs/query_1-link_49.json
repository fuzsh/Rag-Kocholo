        "text": "When you are taking a road trip into and out of Southwest Florida, it can take a minute. Not just because of traffic but because we are so far south. It’s inevitable that you’ll need to stop for some kind of refueling. Next time you need a good pit stop for sustenance, check out the biggest BBQ sandwich found in Bartow.\n\nIt’s at a restaurant called Boney Mac’s BBQ and it is my latest discovery for Favorite Florida Pit Stops. Favorite Florida Pit Stops is a culinary and travel series. It primarily features mom and pop restaurants along well traveled roads to and from Southwest Florida.\n\nThis is one of those places that you can smell before you see on Highway 17 and Martin Luther King Jr, Blvd. in Bartow. You likely whiz right by if 17 is the route you take to Orlando and other Central Florida locations.\n\nAbout The Biggest BBQ Sandwich Found In Bartow\n\nBoney Mac’s is old school. The smoker is in the parking lot facing the highway. The interior is wide open and orders are taken at a small counter. Beware, it also has tempting, homemade desserts linted up. The selections change daily.\n\nThe rest of the menu is full of southern and soulful favorites like collard greens, lima beans, fried okra, mac-n-cheese and more. Smoked meats include chicken, ribs and pork which all come in a variety of ways.\n\nI ordered what I thought was a simple rib sandwich. I could not pick it up. The rib meat didn’t even come close to fitting between the two pieces of white bread it came with and I wasn’t mad about it at all. The amount of meat was enough to feed three people.\n\nThe BBQ sauce on the side was sweet and tangy mustard base. Best part was the value. The sandwich was only $11. If you are trying to feed a bunch of people and not break the bank, this is your stop. Everything I had was delicious too.\n\nThere is another great stop for BBQ lovers on Highway 17. It’s about 20 minutes south of Boney Mac’s. Click here to find more about Smokin’ Joes.\n\nHere Are Photos Of The Biggest BBQ Sandwich Found In Bartow"
