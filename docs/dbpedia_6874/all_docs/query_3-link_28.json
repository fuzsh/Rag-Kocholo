        "text": "Exciting New Virtual Reality Venue Coming Soon To Fort Myers\n\nVR is a pretty cool thing and an exciting new virtual reality venue is coming soon to Fort Myers.\n\nVirtual reality is all the rage right now. Maybe it’s the fact that a lot of people want an escape from our reality, to experience something in a whole new way or that they want a different form of gaming. With devices like the Meta Quest, Apple Vision Pro and Oculus just to name a few, they are accessible, but they’re also expensive.\n\nI have to be honest with the few times I’ve tried a VR headset, it’s made me a little queasy, but I also get motion sickness pretty easily. I have friends that use them all the time though and now prefer to play that way. Some though may opt for just once in a while use, so being able to go somewhere to play and with others, may be the better option.\n\nVirtual Reality Venue Coming Soon To Fort Myers\n\nSandbox VR just opened a virtual reality venue in St. Pete, but soon there will also be a location right here in Fort Myers. According to their website groups of up to 6 players at a time can see and physically interact with everyone inside letting you feel like you’re living inside a game or a movie. The technology sounds awesome as they say “Thanks to Hollywood motion capture cameras, 3D precision body trackers, custom hardware, and haptic suits, you get a feeling of transformation you can’t get anywhere else. You might forget you left reality.”\n\nWhile the location and exact opening date hasn’t been announced yet, some of the games you can play at Sandbox VR have. Squid Game, Seekers of the Shard, Deadwood Valley, Amber Sky, Curse of Davy Jones and more.\n\nFor more info on Sandbox VR and to sign up for updates on the new Fort Myers location, click here\n\nMarija is a morning show host on WXKB/B1039 and midday host on WRXK/96KRock.
