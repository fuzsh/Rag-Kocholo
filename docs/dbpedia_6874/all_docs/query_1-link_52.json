        "text": "When it comes to pie, everyone has a favorite but this is the one to try in Southwest Florida.\n\nWhen it comes to pies, there are so many different kinds. From chocolate pies to fruit pies to cream pies. I’ve always been a fan of key lime pie, where my brother is a banana cream pie fanatic. He requested my mom made him one for his birthday every year all growing up, and now that my parents live here, his requests have been fulfilled once again.\n\nSo where do you go for the best? I usually don’t have room for dessert after a meal, but I know that here in Fort Myers, my mom really enjoys the key lime pie at Snug Harbor and Dixie Fish Company. A friend at work raves about the pie at Publix (which I agree is amazing). If you want the alcoholic version, the key lime colada at Parrot Key Caribbean Grill is my favorite. But if you want the very best, you won’t have to go too far.\n\nThis Is The Pie You Have To Try In Southwest Florida\n\nYelp just released their list of the “50 pies you need to try” which looked at pies from a variety of restaurants in all 50 states in the country. We often think of pies as being sweet and for dessert. But on their list I was surprised to see some savory options as well. Key Lime Pie is a Florida staple, and according to their list, Fresh Catch Fish Market and Grill in Sarasota has the very best in Florida. Their menu indicates that the pie is homemade with homemade whipped cream and a slice costs $6.50.\n\nTo see the full list of “50 states, 50 pies you need to try”, click here\n\nThe Best Local Cuisine Restaurants In Southwest Florida\n\nMarija is a morning show host on WXKB/B1039 and midday host on WRXK/96KRock.
