        "text": "Everybody loves a good hamburger and Whataburger is coming to Bradenton.\n\nCheeseburgers are one of my favorite thing. And to me, while some are better than others, I really don’t mind where they come from. Whether it’s a fast food burger, one cooked at home on the grill or from a sit-down restaurant, I enjoy them all. In fact, one of my favorite burgers is the mushroom & swiss from Hardees. I don’t go often because it’s completely out of my way from my home in Fort Myers up to Palm Beach Blvd, but if I’m up there, I’ll stop and enjoy every bite.\n\nI haven’t yet been to a Whataburger, but I have a lot of friends who are obsessed. My friend Alek lives in Texas and he and I get into debates all the time about what is better, Whataburger or In-N-Out. I’m In-N-Out all the way, but without trying Whataburger, I can’t say for sure. I had a layover in Dallas last year and was about to try it until I saw the line was extremely long, so I opted for BBQ instead. But soon, we’ll have a Whataburger is coming to Bradenton, a little closer to us in SWFL, so I can try it.\n\nWhataburger Is Coming To Bradenton\n\nRight now, there are 45 Whataburger locations in Florida, but none in south Florida at all. In fact, the furthest south is St. Augustine, which for us down here is a hike. But soon, there will be one coming to Bradenton, which will make for a perfect stop on the way to or from Tampa. According to the Miami Herald, a franchisee from the Chicago area put in an application back in May for plans to open a location at the Marketplace at Heritage Harbour shopping center at State Road 64 and Heritage Harbour Parkway.\n\nEvery Whataburger burger is made to order with 100% pure, never-frozen beef and served on a 5-inch toasted bun. And with toppings like grilled jalapenos, bacon, cheese, tomatoes, pickles, avocado and more, there’s plenty of ways to customize it to your taste.\n\nAnd they don’t just serve burgers. Also on the menu are chicken sandwiches, salads and wings. Yum!\n\nMarija is a morning show host on WXKB/B1039 and midday host on WRXK/96KRock.
