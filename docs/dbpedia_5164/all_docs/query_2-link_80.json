You can give to our emergency fund which goes to where the need is greatest at that time or you could learn about the benefits of monthly donations to charity. You can give in memory to celebrate the life of a loved one, or leave a gift in a will to help us continue to deliver life-changing work. You can also give just to our UK work or learn more about our fundraising ideas and fundraising charity events that way.\n\nYou could make a donation of unwanted clothes, books, bric-a-brac, toys, music and films to one of our many Save the Children charity shops, or even pop in to one to find something that takes your fancy. We also have our Mary’s Living and Giving shops, set up with retail expert Mary Portas, these boutique shops ensure you’ll find something beautiful, whilst also supporting our work."
