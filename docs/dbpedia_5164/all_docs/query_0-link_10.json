That said, it’s not their fault; they did as they were told, as they anlways do, and nothing need be said beyond that.\n\n__________\n\nI think with the Rebel Alliance being scattered and spread thin for so many years and the New Republic never able to get their act together, it's probably all they could muster for an orchestra at that point.\n\nAnd if you think that freelance orchestra was sub-par, wait 'til you see some of the players from Andor...\n\nEdit: In all seriousness, I should add that the Andor soundtrack is brilliant and the funeral march is one of the best tracks of the entire lot! Nicholas Britell did an amazing job.\n\nHey, i just rewatched the prequel trilogy and noticed that the main title from episode 7 sounds really weak compared to the prequel recording.\n\nThen i read that it was recorded by an freelance orchestra?\n\nWhy didnt they just recorded the theme again with the LSO?\n\nIMO, it would have sounded better if it was recorded by the LSO, because it sounds very weak especially in the intro..\n\nCan somebody explain to me WHY they made this decision, and who came up with that stupid idea??\n\nthanks in advance\n\nI'm not fully sure but I think it had to do with the union here in Los Angeles. They've got exclusive rights with certain studios and these studios can only record in LA. The old Star Was Prequels were done with Lucas Films which was more of an indie company but when bought by Disney it became a Studio Film. I think that maybe HZ suffered the same fate when doing Superman but since I'm not in that inner circle, pure speculation on my part.\n\nBoth LA and London are badass but London has a bigger studio. The brass isn't weak at all but just not as great as THE LSO in Abbey Road\n\nDon't you hear how terribly weak the brass sounds in the opening bars? Just compare the Trombones to the recording of Episode 3 for example.\n\nThanks for posting. I hear what you are saying about the trombones. Definitely more staccato, and more bold. But listen to these (Ep7 first, followed by Sith):\n\nHere's the very opening, and yes, Sith does sound a bit bolder. But not by a lot. The Sith trombones are also up in the mix more, but that could be a decision based on the performance.\n\nView attachment sw1.mp3\n\nBut listen to the trumpets here:\n\nView attachment sw2.mp3\n\nDoesn't Ep7 sound bigger, fuller and bolder?\n\nAnd listen again to the end of that phrase:\n\nView attachment sw3.mp3\n\nBoth have their stronger points, I think."
