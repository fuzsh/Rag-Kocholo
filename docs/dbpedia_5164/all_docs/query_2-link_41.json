        "text": "Typically, dashes are used between numbers and dots are used to denote sections. For example: 2-2-2-2.4-4-3-1 looks a little bit tidier than 2.2.2.2-4.4.3.1. It is more of a matter of personal aesthetic - as long as denotation of sections is clear. For your example, if the composition is just for string orchestra, then using dots between numbers would not be confusing as only 1 section is involved.\n\nFor a wind ensemble, it would be a little different if the instrumentation is other than the accepted standard. In those cases, it would be a good idea to include instrumental abbreviations. For example, here is the shorthand instrumentation of a piece that I wrote for a large wind ensemble:\n\npicc.5.2.6.bcl.bsn.2asax.tsax.bsax.4.6.3.btbn.2euph.tba-db-perc(6)-timp.\n\nAs you can see, I mix both numbers and abbreviations in order to clearly define the instrumentation in a concise way."
