        "text": "American pop rock band\n\nThis article is about the band. For their self-titled EP, see Imagine Dragons (EP).\n\nImagine Dragons are an American pop rock band formed in 2008, based in Las Vegas, Nevada, and currently consisting of lead singer Dan Reynolds, guitarist Wayne Sermon, and bassist Ben McKee.[1][2] The band first gained exposure with the release of their single \"It's Time\", followed by their debut album Night Visions (2012), which resulted in the chart-topping singles \"Radioactive\" and \"Demons\". Rolling Stone named \"Radioactive\", which held the record for most weeks charted on the Billboard Hot 100, the \"biggest rock hit of the year\".[3][4][5][6] MTV called them \"the year's biggest breakout band\",[7] and Billboard named them their \"Breakthrough Band of 2013\" and \"Biggest Band of 2017\",[8] and placed them at the top of their \"Year in Rock\" rankings for 2013,[9] 2017,[10] and 2018.[11] Imagine Dragons topped the Billboard Year-End \"Top Artists – Duo/Group\" category in 2018.[12]\n\nThe band's second studio album Smoke + Mirrors (2015) reached number one in the US, Canada and the UK.[13][14] This was followed by their third studio album Evolve (2017), which resulted in three chart-topping singles, \"Believer\", \"Thunder\", and \"Whatever It Takes\", also making them the artist with the most weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart. The album reached the top five in many countries.[15] The band's fourth studio album Origins (2018) featured the single \"Natural\", which became their fifth song to top the Hot Rock Songs chart. Although all four albums were commercially successful, critical reception was mixed.[16] The band’s fifth studio album Mercury – Acts 1 & 2 (2022) was a double album released in two parts in 2021 and 2022, and also received mixed reviews.\n\nImagine Dragons have won three American Music Awards, nine Billboard Music Awards, one Grammy Award, one MTV Video Music Award, and one World Music Award. In May 2014, the band was nominated for 14 Billboard Music Awards, including Top Artist of the Year and a Milestone Award, which recognizes innovation and creativity of artists across different genres. In April 2018, the band was nominated 11 more times for Billboard Music Awards.[17]\n\nImagine Dragons have sold more than 74 million albums and 65 million digital songs worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists.[18] They have also earned 160 billion streams across music platforms.[18] They were the most streamed group of 2018 on Spotify,[19] the first rock act to have four songs, \"Radioactive\", \"Demons\", \"Believer\", and \"Thunder\", to surpass one billion streams each,[20] and the only group in RIAA history to have four songs certified higher than Diamond.[21] According to Billboard, \"Believer\", \"Thunder\", and \"Radioactive\" were the three best performing rock songs of the 2010s.[22]\n\nHistory\n\n2008–2011: early years\n\nIn 2008, lead singer Dan Reynolds met drummer Andrew Tolman at Brigham Young University, where they were both students.[23] Reynolds and Tolman recruited Andrew Beck, Dave Lemke, and Aurora Florence to play guitar, bass, and piano, respectively, for their band. Their name is an anagram for a phrase only known to members of the group, which Reynolds stated each member approved of.[24] The five-piece recorded demos that they uploaded to MySpace that year, but Beck and Florence left the band later that year. In 2009, Tolman recruited long-time high school friend Wayne Sermon, who had graduated from Berklee College of Music, to play guitar. Tolman later recruited his wife, Brittany Tolman, to sing back-up and play keys, and the band began to play shows together again. Lemke left the band shortly thereafter, leading Sermon to recruit another Berklee music student, Ben McKee, to join the band as their bassist and complete the line-up.[25][26] The band garnered a large following in their hometown of Provo, Utah, before the members moved to Las Vegas, the hometown of Dan Reynolds, where the band recorded and released their first three EPs.[27]\n\nThe band released a self-titled EP Imagine Dragons on September 1, 2009, and Hell and Silence on March 10, 2010, both recorded at Battle Born Studios, in Las Vegas.[28][29][30] Six months after releasing their third EP, It's Time, on March 12, 2011, they signed a record deal with Interscope Records on November 18, 2011.[31]\n\nThey got their first big break when Train's frontman Pat Monahan fell sick just prior to the Bite of Las Vegas Festival 2009. Imagine Dragons was called to fill in and performed to a crowd of more than 26,000 people.[32] Local accolades including \"Best CD of 2011\" (Vegas SEVEN),[33] \"Best Local Indie Band 2010\" (Las Vegas Weekly),[34] \"Las Vegas' Newest Must See Live Act\" (Las Vegas CityLife),[35] Vegas Music Summit Headliner 2010,[36] and more sent the band on a positive trajectory. In November 2011, they signed with Interscope Records and began working with English Grammy Award-winning producer Alex da Kid.[37] Eventually, the Tolmans left the group. Drummer Daniel Platzman and keyboardist Theresa Flaminio were recruited by McKee in August 2011, prior to the band's label deal in November 2011.[38] Flaminio departed from the group around the time of the band's deal with Interscope, leaving the band a four-piece.\n\n2012–2014: Night Visions\n\nMain article: Night Visions\n\nThe band worked closely with Alex da Kid, with whom they recorded their first major-label release at Westlake Recording Studios in West Hollywood, California.\n\nAn EP entitled Continued Silence was released on February 14, 2012 digitally and peaked at number 40 on the Billboard 200. The band also released an EP titled Hear Me in 2012.\n\nShortly after, \"It's Time\" was released as a single and peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100.[39] The music video debuted on April 17, 2012, on all MTV affiliates and was subsequently nominated for an MTV Video Music Award in the \"Best Rock Video\" category.[40] \"It's Time\" was certified a 7× platinum single by the RIAA.[41]\n\nThe band finished recording their debut album Night Visions in the summer of 2012 at Studio X inside Palms Casino Resort and released the album in the United States on September 4, 2012. It peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart with first week sales in excess of 83,000 copies, the highest charting for a debut rock album since 2006.[42] The album also reached No. 1 on the Billboard Alternative and Rock Album charts as well as the top ten on the Australian, Austrian, Canadian, Dutch, German, Irish, Norwegian, Portuguese, Scottish, Spanish, and United Kingdom Albums charts. It won a Billboard Music Award for Top Rock Album and was nominated for the Juno Award for International Album of the Year.[43] Night Visions is certified platinum in the US by the RIAA as well as in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. The album produced three tracks that reached the Billboard Top 40, four tracks in the ARIA Top 40, and five tracks charting in the UK Top 40.\n\nThe album's second single \"Radioactive\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard Alternative Songs, Billboard Rock Songs, and Swedish singles chart and has sold more than 14 million singles in the United States, entering the top 3 of the most selling songs digitally ever.[44] It also smashed the record of the longest running song on the Billboard Hot 100 by spending 87 weeks before being broken by The Weeknd's \"Blinding Lights\" in 2021.[45] \"Radioactive\" stayed at No. 1 on the Hot Rock Songs chart for a record-breaking 23 weeks and ultimately became the genre's biggest hit of 2013.[46] It peaked at No. 3, becoming their first top ten single in the United States and broke the record for the longest run into the top five. It is the best-selling rock song on the Nielsen SoundScan running list of best-selling rock songs in digital history.[47] By the end of 2013, \"Radioactive\" had already sold over three million copies.[48] Rolling Stone called it \"the biggest rock hit of the year\". It was also the most streamed song of 2013 on Spotify in the United States.[49] It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, winning the latter of the two. The band performed a medley of \"Radioactive\" and \"M.A.A.D City\" alongside rapper Kendrick Lamar at the ceremony. A remixed version of \"Radioactive\", featuring a newly added verse from Lamar, was released the next day and performed on the February 1, 2014 episode of Saturday Night Live.\n\nThird single \"Demons\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard Pop Songs, peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent 61 weeks on it.[41][50] In 2021, RIAA declared that the song has become the band's third diamond selling song in the US.[44] Fourth single \"On Top Of The World\" reached a peak of No. 79 on the Billboard Hot 100 and also spent 20 weeks on the chart.[44] In the US, the non-singles off the album, \"Bleeding Out\" and \"Amsterdam\" were certified platinum while \"Hear Me\" and \"Tiptoe\" were certified gold.[44] Billboard listed them as one of \"2012's Brightest New Stars\" and later \"The Breakout Band of 2013\".[51] Imagine Dragons won the 2014 Billboard Music Awards for Top Duo/Group, Top Hot 100 Artist, and Top Rock Artist.

The band released a one night only concert film, Imagine Dragons In Concert: Smoke + Mirrors, in select theaters on March 2, 2016, which was later released on DVD and Blu-Ray.

In terms of success, Reynolds credits bands like Foster the People and Mumford & Sons for bringing alternative pop music to a new level of commercial success in recent years.[133]\n\nPublic image\n\nDespite their popularity and large social media followings, reception towards Imagine Dragons from other musicians and music critics has been mixed since their breakthrough to the mainstream. Review aggregator Metacritic reports that the band's first four studio albums—Night Visions, Smoke + Mirrors, Evolve, and Origins—have scores of 53, 60, 47, and 59, respectively, out of 100, indicating generally mixed reviews.[134] The band's music has been criticized for its repetitive lyrics, \"overblown\" arena rock production, overemphasis on reverberation effects, sticking to formulas, and genre-hopping.[135][136] Following the band's halftime show performance at the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship, American music publication Spin ran an article titled 'Is Imagine Dragons The Worst Band Ever?', which described the band's songs as having lyrics that are \"a composite of motivational platitudes and pseudo-dramatic yelps, barely merit repeating, if only because Reynolds seems so willing to do that himself\" and featuring a \"punishing, squelching rhythmic force\".[137] The band has frequently been compared to Canadian rock band Nickelback by critics, referring to Nickelback's own negative public perception.\n\nDespite this criticism, the band has described themselves as \"genre-less\". In an interview with Billboard at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, Reynolds stated, \"We've always kind of prided ourselves on being kind of a genre-less band. [...] I have no idea how I'd categorize us. Sometimes it's definitely pop; sometimes the songs are all guitar-driven. It depends on the song.\"[138]\n\nThe band has also been the subject of ridicule by several musicians. In a 2019 interview, Slipknot frontman Corey Taylor echoed the Nickelback comparisons, claiming that Nickelback were \"passing the baton of being rock and roll's scapegoat\" to Imagine Dragons.[139] Matty Healy of The 1975 described \"Radioactive\" as 'nothingness', stating, \"It might as well be called 'Pikachu Banana'.\" In a 2018 interview, Mark Foster joked that his band Foster the People give their rejected material to Imagine Dragons. In response, Reynolds took to Twitter, denouncing what he described as \"click-bait horse shit filled with vile and hate meant to feed humanity's need to laugh at each other's imperfections and fails.\"[140] Foster issued an apology to Reynolds on Twitter, expressing regret over the joke and praising him for his humanitarian efforts. Taylor, on the other hand, criticized Reynolds and claimed that his words were taken out of context, tweeting, \"As long as people are stupid, letting salacious headlines do their thinking for them, there will always be controversy. Do some research and find the truth...\".[141] Healy responded in a radio interview, stating, \"You're a millionaire in a huge band. You don't say, 'Oh, I'm gonna do this, and also can I be void of criticism?' It's like … no.\"[142] The band has ignored calls from pro-Palestinian activists to boycott Israel, performing in Tel Aviv, Israel on August 30, 2023.[143] In a similar case, the band performed in Baku, Azerbaijan, which was criticized by System of a Down singer and activist Serj Tankian, as it could be seen as \"an endorsement of Azerbeijan's authoritarian president, Ilham Aliyev\".[144]\n\nOn the other hand, the band has been praised by some for their genre-bending style, and for keeping arena rock popular during the 2010s, a decade which saw guitars and bands dwindling in mainstream music.[145]\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nIn 2013, along with the family of Tyler Robinson, Imagine Dragons started a charity called the Tyler Robinson Foundation, helping young people battling cancer. Beginning in 2014, the first annual Tyler Robinson Foundation Gala was held in Las Vegas.[146] Imagine Dragons performed for \"Playing It Forward\" (S1 E2) to raise $100,000 for school music programs.[147] The band partnered with mtvU to help choose four Fulbright-mtvU Fellowship recipients.[148] They partnered with Do the Write Thing: National Campaign to Stop Violence for a fundraising event.[149]\n\nImagine Dragons performed as part of Amnesty International's \"Bringing Human Rights Home\" concert in Brooklyn on February 5, 2014.[150] In 2015, Imagine Dragons released the track \"I Was Me\" for the One4 project with all proceeds going to the UN Refugee Agency to support fleeing refugees, particularly in the Middle East.[151] Imagine Dragons also released cover track \"I Love You All The Time\" to benefit the victims of the terrorist attacks in Paris.[152] In 2017, the band helped organize the annual LoveLoud Festival which aims to raise awareness about LGBTQ youth and benefit LGBTQ organizations such as the Trevor Project.[153]\n\nOn June 22, 2018, in collaboration with film score composer Hans Zimmer, lead singer Dan Reynolds released a single titled \"Skipping Stones\". The song was released to correspond with his new documentary, Believer, a film that discusses the topic of the intersection between the LGBT community and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. All proceeds from the song benefit LGBTQ charities.[154]\n\nOn July 23, 2022, Imagine Dragons became the official ambassadors of the United24 platform,[155] joining the fundraising for C-type ambulances, which allow medics to save even the most seriously injured. In total, the project, announced at the First Ladies and Gentlemen Summit, raised more than $6 million. These funds were used to purchase 92 vehicles that are already helping Ukrainian medics in the field.[155]\n\nOn May 10, 2023, the band released a music video for the song \"Crushed\".[156] Directed by Ty Arnold, the video tells the true story of a 14-year-old boy named Sasha. Russian troops occupied his village for five months until Ukrainian forces finally liberated it. Despite this, the conflict left his home, school and neighborhood in ruins. He survived the shelling only by hiding in an underground shelter. The visualization details his story of perseverance as he walks through the rubble.[157][158]\n\nBand members\n\nTimeline\n\nDiscography\n\nMain articles: Imagine Dragons discography and songs\n\nNight Visions (2012)\n\nSmoke + Mirrors (2015)\n\nEvolve (2017)\n\nOrigins (2018)\n\nMercury – Acts 1 & 2 (2022)\n\nLoom (2024)\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nTours\n\nImagine Dragons on Tour (2011–2012)\n\nFall Tour 2012 (2012)\n\nNight Visions Tour (2013–2014)[160][161][162]\n\nSmoke + Mirrors Tour (2015–2016)\n\nEvolve World Tour (2017–2019)[163]\n\nMercury World Tour (2022–2023)[164]\n\nLoom World Tour (2024)[165]\n\nNotes\n\nReferences"
