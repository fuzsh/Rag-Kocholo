        "text": "For other uses of this name, see One Piece (Disambiguation).\n\nAs has become typical of long-running youth-oriented anime, One Piece has gone through a long succession of theme songs, performed by popular artists, since its debut on television. Though performed by popular singers and bands, most seem to be written specifically for the show, as nearly all of them reference treasure, the sea, or ships in some way. As of July 31, 2024, there have been 26 opening themes, 20 regular ending themes, and a number of ending themes for films and specials as well. During the show, there has also been recognizable music being played in the background (like Dvorak's New World Symphony and Schiller's Ode to Joy). Soundtrack CDs released in Japan also include a large number of \"image songs\" based on the series, performed either by cast members in character, or by theme song artists.\n\nEnglish dubs of the series have had different approaches to localizing the theme music. The 4Kids' dub of the series removed the Japanese opening and ending music entirely in favor of an original rap piece known as the \"One Piece Theme\"; This piece was used throughout all of their localized episodes, with the lyrics altered slightly to coincide with each new member of the crew. Funimation opted to record English versions of the theme songs, using familiar voice actors and the original instrumentals; This practice stopped with Episode 207 (and only the eighth Movie), at which point Funimation switched to using the Japanese versions (even for the \"Straw Hat\" version of 'We Are!'). Similarly, Odex's Singapore-based dub kept the Japanese music unaltered. In some cases, the Japanese music would be unobtainable at all for foreign releases, and swapped out with either an adjacent theme song or an extract from the original soundtrack, regardless of language options.\n\nThemes\n\nOpenings\n\nTV Episodes\n\n# Title Original Artist English Artist Episodes Episode Count 01 \"We Are!\" Hiroshi Kitadani (Ep 1-47 & 1000)\n\nRussell Velazquez (4Kids; unused)\n\nVic Mignogna, Jerry Jewell (Funimation) 1-47\n\n1000 48 02 \"Believe\" Folder 5 Meredith McCoy 48-115 68 03 \"Hikari e\" The Babystars Vic Mignogna 116-168 53 04 \"BON VOYAGE!\" Bon-Bon Blanco Brina Palencia 169-206 38 05 \"Kokoro no Chizu\" BOYSTYLE N/A (Not dubbed) 207-263 57 06 \"Brand New World\" D-51 264-278 15 07 \"We Are!
