        "text": "Irish pop rock band\n\nPicture This are an Irish pop rock musical band based in Athy, County Kildare, Ireland, comprising Ryan Hennessy, Jimmy Rainsford, Owen Cardiff and Cliff Deane. In 2017, they released their eponymous debut album, which entered atop the Irish Albums Chart. In early 2019, they released their follow up album Mdrn Lv. Their third studio album “Life In Colour” was released in June 2021. On 26 April 2024 they released \"Parked Car Conversations\", also a studio album, their fourth album.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nPicture This originate from Athy, County Kildare, Ireland. The band consists of Ryan Hennessy (vocals), Jimmy Rainsford (drums), Owen Cardiff (guitar) and Cliff Deane (bass). Rainsford had previously toured with Ryan Sheridan, whilst Hennessy had been a member of another local band. Deane, Cardiff and Rainsford were childhood friends. Deane and Cardiff joined the band when Hennessy and Rainsford asked them to play with Picture This.[1]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\n2015–2017: Breakthrough and Picture This\n\n[edit]\n\nIn October 2015, Ryan Hennessy recorded a sample of the song \"Take My Hand\" on his iPhone, which he and Rainsford later recorded in the studio. The video was uploaded to Facebook and YouTube, and has amassed over 4 million views across all platforms. The band's debut gig was to be played in the Grand Social venue in Dublin, which they sold out in under 30 minutes. To meet the demand, the gig was moved to The Academy, which has a capacity of 850 people. The band became the first act to sell out the venue for their debut gig.\n\nThe band announced a 20-date tour of Ireland in spring 2016. The tour began in Leixlip on 4 June and culminated with three dates at the Olympia, a 1,600 capacity venue in Dublin on 1–3 November. By 22 July 2016 tickets for 16 of the shows had sold out, including two dates at the Olympia. The band later announced that they would be playing a third and final date at the Olympia on 3 November 2016.[2]\n\nIn July 2016, the band announced that they would be releasing their debut self-titled EP on 12 August. The track list featured five original songs including \"Take My Hand\". The EP debuted at number 1 on the Irish Albums Chart for the week ending 18 August 2016.[3]\n\nIn May 2017, Picture This released \"Never Change\", the lead single from their debut studio album. Rainsford told Billboard the song was inspired by \"the feeling of loving somebody exactly how they are and never wanting them to change a thing. The video signifies that we could go anywhere in the world but we always end up back home and will never change that.\"[4]\n\nThey released their self-titled debut album on 25 August 2017.[5] It ended up topping the IRMA charts in Ireland.[6]\n\n2018–present: Mdrn Lv and Life in Colour\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 23 March 2018, Picture This released \"This Morning\". On 15 June 2018, they released \"When We Were Young\". On 17 October 2018, they announced their second album, Mdrn Lv, and released its lead single, \"One Drink\". Following the release, they also announced their second headline tour. On 7 December 2018, they released the second single from Mdrn Lv, \"Everything or Nothing\". The album was released on 19 February 2019, with a performance atop the Empire State Building in New York City. On 18 October 2019 they released their single \"One Night\". On 19 October they announced three concert dates in Ireland in Cork, Dublin and Belfast for June 2020.\n\nIn June 2021, the band released their third studio album, Life in Colour, which includes the single \"LA House Party\". The album debuted at number 2 on the Irish Albums Chart.\n\nBand members\n\n[edit]\n\nRyan Hennessy – vocals\n\nJimmy Rainsford – drums\n\nOwen Cardiff – guitar\n\nCliff Deane – bass\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Album details Peak chart positions IRL\n\n[7] UK\n\n[8] Picture This\n\nReleased: 25 August 2017[5]\n\nLabel: Picture This Music, Republic (0190295781637)\n\nFormats: CD, LP, DD, streaming\n\n1 — Mdrn Lv\n\nReleased: 15 February 2019[9]\n\nLabel: Republic (00602577242977)\n\nFormat: CD, LP, DD, streaming\n\n1 54 Life in Colour\n\nReleased: 25 June 2021\n\nLabel: Let's Get It, Republic (3832728)\n\nFormat: CD, LP, DD, streaming\n\n2 51 Parked Car Conversations\n\nReleased: 26 April 2024\n\nLabel: RCA, Sony\n\nFormat: CD, LP, DD, streaming\n\n2\n\n[10] 74\n\nExtended plays\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Extended play details Peak\n\nchart\n\npositions IRL\n\n[7] Picture This\n\nReleased: 12 August 2016\n\nLabel: Picture This Music Ltd., Warner Music Ireland\n\nFormats: CD, DD, streaming\n\n1\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Peak chart positions Sales Album IRL\n\n[7] UK\n\n[8] 2015 \"Take My Hand\"[11] 21 —\n\nIRL: 10,000[12]\n\nPicture This 2016 \"You & I\"[13] 48 — \"Let's Be Young\"[14] 66 — \"For You\"[15] — — \"I Don't Know Why\"[16] — — \"This Christmas\"[17] 25 — 2017 \"Never Change\"[4] 30 — \"Everything I Need\" 72 — \"95\" 61 — \"Addicted to You\" 22 — 2018 \"This Morning\"[18] 6 — Non-album single \"When We Were Young\"[19] 28 — \"One Drink\"[20] 12 98 Mdrn Lv \"Everything or Nothing\"[21] 7 — 2019 \"If You Wanna Be Loved\"[22][23] 18 — \"Modern Love\"[24] 23 — \"One Night\"[25] 4 — Non-album single \"This Christmas\" (Orchestral Version) [26] — — 2020 \"Winona Ryder\"[27] 20 — Life in Colour \"Troublemaker\"[28] 38 — Non-album single \"If I Build a Home on the Moon\"[29] 23 — \"Unconditional\"[30] 17 — Life in Colour 2021 \"Things Are Different\"[31] 16 — \"LA House Party\"[32] 20 — \"Heart's Not In It\"\n\n(with Loote)[33] — — Non-album single \"If Ever However Whenever Forever\"[34] 49 — Life in Colour 2022 \"Get on My Love\" 38 — Parked Car Conversations 2023 \"Song to Myself\" 31 — \"Ireland\" — — Non-album single \"Leftover Love\" 65 — Parked Car Conversations \"Call It Love\" 78 — 2024 \"Act of Innocence\" 71 — \"Parked Car Conversations\" 87\n\n[35] — \"Satellites\"[36] — — \"—\" denotes a title that did not chart.\n\nOther charted songs\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Peak chart positions Album IRL\n\n[7] 2017 \"Smell Like Him\" 73 Picture This \"Jane\" 81 \"Carry On\" 82 \"Dream\" 92 \"Saviour\" 97 \"Body and Mind\" 62 2019 \"Nevada\" 93 Mdrn Lv \"Hurt Nobody\" 52 2021 \"Addict of Magic\" 10 Life in Colour \"Die for You\" 49\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nMusic of Ireland\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
