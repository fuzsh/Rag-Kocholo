        "text": "Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens\n\nBright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens\n\nWoodwinds and Brass and Percussion and Strings,\n\nThese are a few of my favorite things!\n\nOnce upon a time, I played flute, piccolo, bass drum, cymbals and baritone (but… not all at the same time).\n\nIn high school, I placed my flute on a shelf to collect years of dust and walked away from a God-given talent, mainly because I never developed a love of the music I played. In the midst of playing solos and ensembles, memorizing many pieces, and leading an entire section of instruments, I had never actually studied classical music or composers. I never appreciated the music I played. I never enjoyed it. Even when I played solos with band accompaniments, I could not tell you anything about a composer or even recognize a piece (except Stars & Stripes Forever). That was two decades ago (TWO DECADES?!?!?). And yet I have thought back longingly to those moments when conductor unified chaos. (Really, I wish I could raise my hands and conduct my home in such a way.)\n\nAnd so now we return to the formal study of such things. I personally have come to appreciate this aspect of Fine Arts more in the past year, albeit through The Nutcracker and Disney’s Little Einsteins. (If you’re like me and want an easy way to incorporate Fine Arts into your home, visit Wikipedia’s List of Little Einsteins Episodes for a list of Little Einstein’s episodes along with each art/music focus and then go to this list to find out which episodes are on which DVD. Last year prior to our official composer study, our boys already knew the names “Stravinsky” and “Tchaikovsky” and were familiar with their music due to Disney’s Little Einsteins, specifically, Rocket’s Firebird Rescue (Stravinsky’s Firebird Suite) and Christmas Wish (Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker Suite).) And despite the fact that I ran away from this classical music stuff at one time, now I look forward to it. It’s fun! (I now love taking the boys to the Symphony!)\n\nThe main thing for composer study is to simply listen to the music to become familiar with the composer’s sound and style, and to learn the vocabulary. You can supplement with biographies and notebooking pages, or coloring pages, or let your child draw or scribble, but the most important thing is to listen to the music and gain a basic understanding of classical music!\n\nTowards the bottom of this post, you’ll find a list of the resources we’ve found, but before I get to that point, here’s my filtered, less intimidating list of things we might use this semester (ha! This one looks intimidating, too, but so you know, it’s not intended for you to use all of this stuff! Find one or two things you’d like to use, but mostly just try to listen to the music of each composer. If you come across broken links, please let me know.)\n\nDid you know? Our Mission: Great Commission curriculum series incorporates a study of the Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Modern Eras over a three year period, as well as famous composers from each time period along with a study of each section of the orchestra using the book A Child’s Introduction to the Orchestra.\n\nBecause of the enormous amount of time it takes for me to research in compiling these link lists, I ask that you do not copy and paste the links in other documents, websites, or emails, but instead send people to this webpage. Thank you for honoring this request!\n\nAs a parent…\n\nThese are the resources that I find helpful to introduce children to the orchestra and classical music. Our most favorite classical music and composer study was this Hands-On History Activity Pak: Composers by Homeschool in the Woods. For a detailed review of this fantastic resource, click here.\n\nVideos:\n\nLet’s Go to the Symphony Video\n\nGeorge Meets the Orchestra\n\nThe Orchestra Song\n\nThe King’s Singers Singing Famous Composers’ names in they style of the Composer\n\nThe Story of Great Music: Free lessons on the Renaissance and Early Baroque Era\n\nMeet the Instruments Study. For a review of this resource, click here.\n\nPrintable Activities:\n\nA study of Prokofiev and Peter and the Wolf\n\nFamous Composer Notebooking Pages\n\nActivities, Resources and Lesson Plans from the Dallas Symphony Orchestra\n\nFamous Musician Resources from Practical Pages\n\nComposer of the Month wall chart\n\nOrchestra Lapbook\n\nOrchestra Teaching Resources/Printables\n\nFree SQUILT Lessons to practice music appreciation. Also available for purchase is the fantastic SQUILT Meet the Instrument Study.\n\nClick here to read a review.\n\nOrchestra Lapbook\n\nVery fun interactive Classical Music & Composer Study, including classical music audios, composer timeline, instrument seating charts, and much more!\n\nSee additional orchestra and symphony websites for kids or interactives listed at the bottom of this post. You can also try out two free lessons on The Renaissance and The Early Baroque Era from The Story of Great Music.\n\nAs a tutor or co-op teacher…\n\nI find some of the resources below helpful for introducing a group of children to the orchestra, instrument families, and/or composers.\n\nClassical Conversations Orchestra MP3 Song (Free Public Library – CC Connected)\n\nOrchestra Seating Charts (Printable)\n\nMusical Instrument Bingo & Flashcards\n\nColoring Sheets:\n\nInstrument Coloring Book\n\nMy Musical Instrument Book and Activity Pages\n\nComposer Coloring Pages\n\nClassical Composers Notebooking Pages\n\nFeel free to use our composer notebooking pages from our fine arts notebooking packets!\n\nRenaissance & Baroque Era Fine Arts Notebooking Packet (Handel, Bach, Mozart; Cycle 1)\n\nImpressionists & Classical/Romantic Era Fine Arts Notebooking Packet (Beethoven, Brahms, Dvorak; Cycle 2)\n\nAmerican Artists & Romantic/Modern Era Fine Arts Notebooking Packet (Tchaikovsky, Debussy, Stravinsky; Cycle 3).\n\nThe following image is from our Impressionists & Classical/Romantic Era packet, just to show you what the composer pages look like.\n\nEach composer page includes a place to write something about the composer or the music at the top, and a section along the bottom to draw as you listen.\n\nListening Flowcharts\n\nSometimes it can be easier to listen for specific parts of an orchestral piece by using a listening guide or flowchart. We’ve put these together for Handel, Bach, and Mozart but do not have versions available for other composers."
