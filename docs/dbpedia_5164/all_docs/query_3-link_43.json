        "text": "Program music is a term applied to any musical composition on the classical music tradition in which the piece is designed according to some preconceived narrative, or is designed to evoke a specific idea and atmosphere. This is distinct from the more traditional absolute music popular in the Baroque and Classical eras, in which the piece has no narrative program or ideas and is simply created for music's sake. Musical forms such as the symphonic poem, ballade, suite, overture and some compositions in freer forms are named as program music since they intended to bring out extra-musical elements like sights and incidents.\n\nOpera, ballet, and Lieder could also trivially be considered program music since they are unintended to accompany vocal or stage performances. They will be excluded from this list except where they have been extensively popularised and played without the original vocals and/or stage performance.\n\nThe orchestral program music tradition is also continued in some pieces for jazz orchestras. For narrative or evocative popular music, please see Concept Album.\n\nAny discussion of program music brings to mind Walt Disney's animated features Fantasia (1940) and Fantasia 2000 (1999), in which the Disney animators provided graphic visualisation of several famous pieces of program music. However, not all the pieces used in the films were particularly programmatic, and in most cases, the narratives illustrated by the animators were different from whatever programmatic narrative might have existed originally.\n\nToy Symphony\n\nCapriccio for keyboard in B♭ \"On the departure of a beloved brother\" BWV 992\n\nSt Matthew Passion BWV 244\n\nMany of Bach's cantatas contain elements that could be considered programmatic\n\n1712 Overture\n\nRitual of the Savage (1951)\n\nThe Passions: featuring Bas Sheva (1954)\n\nCoriolan Overture, Op. 62 (1807); based on the story of Coriolanus\n\nSymphony No. 6, Pastoral, Op. 68 (1808); features titled movements, country dances, bird calls, and a storm.\n\nLeonore No. 3 Overture, Op. 72b (1806); one of a series of overtures composed for the opera Leonore, later renamed Fidelio. Leonore No. 3 is well known for portraying some of the major events of the plot in a condensed, purely orchestral form, most notably the distant trumpet fanfares of the finale. Next to the actual, finalized Fidelio overture, this is the most commonly performed version, and still sometimes replaces the Fidelio overture in some productions.\n\nEgmont Overture, Op. 84\n\nWellington's Victory, Op. 91 is also known as the Battle Symphony and describes the battle between the French and British armies outside the Spanish town of Vitoria and the subsequent British victory. The work features rifles and cannons as instruments. It also makes use of Rule Britannia, which is used to describe the British, whereas the French side is announced by the French song Marlbrouk s'en va-t-en guerre.\n\nPiano Sonata in A flat Op. 26 (3rd movement subtitled \"Death of a hero\", 4th movement manifestly \"Life goes on\" in intent)\n\nPiano Sonata in D minor Op. 31 Nr. 2 (\"Der Sturm\", inspired by Shakespeare's The Tempest)\n\nPiano Sonata in E-flat major Op. 81a \"Les Adieux\"\n\nSymphonie Fantastique, (1830)\n\nHarold in Italy, based on Childe Harold's Pilgrimage by Lord Byron, (1834)\n\nRomeo et Juliette, symphonie dramatique\n\nFour Sea Interludes, (1945) — Britten extracted four of the six interludes from his opera Peter Grimes for performance as a stand-alone orchestral piece. \"I. Dawn,\" \"II. Sunday Morning\" (describing a seaside community gathering to worship), \"III. Moonlight,\" and \"IV. Storm\" were all meant to describe these scenes and images through Britten's music literally.[1][2]\n\nSymphony No. 4 in E-flat major, \"Romantic\" — The program, involving medieval castles and dawn and royal hunts, appears to have been an afterthought like it was with the other Symphonies, but the validity of it, in this case, is supported by the subtitle given to the work, the only one of Bruckner's Symphonies to have been given a subtitle by the composer himself.\n\nWinds of Nagual\n\nAppalachian Spring\n\nBilly the Kid\n\nLincoln Portrait\n\nRodeo\n\nDebussy wrote more or less entirely in the 'program' style; see List of compositions by Claude Debussy\n\nThe Sorcerer's Apprentice\n\nSymphony No. 9, From the New World, which is associated with The Song of Hiawatha and describes the composer's impressions of America.\n\nThe Water Goblin\n\nThe Noon Witch\n\nA Hero's Song\n\nFour Overtures:\n\nHussite Overture\n\nIn Nature's Realm\n\nCarnival\n\nOthello\n\nMany of Elgar's works are associated with favourite places, mostly in Herefordshire and Worcestershire where he lived, and his MSS are often noted as such\n\nVariations on an Original Theme (Enigma), Op. 36, a series of musical portraits of the composer's friends (and in one case their dog as well), and incidents associated with them. In addition a secret underlying \"Enigma\" theme runs through the whole work, which has never been definitely discovered\n\nSea Pictures\n\nOverture Cockaigne (In London Town), Op. 40\n\nThe Wand of Youth, Opp. 1a and 1b, two suites based on music he had written as a child\n\nOverture In the South (Alassio), Op. 50\n\nFalstaff, symphonic study, Op. 68\n\nThe Severn Suite, Op. 85, for brass band\n\nNursery Suite\n\nHarlem Air Shaft[3]\n\nAlexander Konstantinovich Glazunov was a prolific composer of symphonic poems, independent overtures and fantasias, who often drew his inspiration from history.\n\nTo the Memory of a Hero, elegy for orchestra, Op. 8\n\nStenka Razin, Op. 13\n\nThe Forest, fantasy for orchestra, Op. 19\n\nSlavonian Feast, symphonic sketches, Op. 26A\n\nThe Sea, fantasy for orchestra, Op. 28\n\nOriental Rhapsody, Op. 29\n\nThe Kremlin, symphonic picture in three parts, Op. 30\n\nThe Spring, symphonic picture, Op. 34\n\nCarnaval, overture for large orchestra and organ, Op. 45\n\nFrom Dark into Light, fantasy for orchestra, Op. 53\n\nSolemn Overture, Op. 73\n\nFrom the Middle Ages, suite for orchestra, Op. 79\n\nThe Song of Destiny, dramatic overture, Op. 84\n\nRussian Fantasy for balalaika-orchestra, Op. 86\n\nTo the Memory of Gogol, symphonic prologue, Op. 87\n\nFinnish Fantasy for orchestra, Op. 88\n\nFinnish Sketches for orchestra, Op. 89\n\nKarelian Legend, Op. 99\n\nPoème épique, Op. posth.\n\nAn American in Paris\n\nCuban Overture\n\nPeer Gynt, originally a selection from incidental music and a song for the play Peer Gynt by Henrik Ibsen, but now is almost always played by itself.\n\nLyric Pieces\n\nWedding Day at Troldhaugen\n\nGrand Canyon Suite, (1931).

He composed a total of thirteen symphonic poems as well as two programmatic symphonies, drawing his inspiration from a variety of literary, mythological, historical and artistic sources.\n\nCe qu'on entend sur la montagne (What is heard on the mountain), after a poem by Victor Hugo\n\nTasso, Lamento e Trionfo, based on stories by Byron and Goethe on the life of the poet Torquato Tasso\n\nLes Préludes, based on Lamartine\n\nOrpheus\n\nPrometheus\n\nMazeppa, based on Hugo and Byron\n\nFestklänge (Festival Sounds)\n\nHéroïde funèbre\n\nFrom the Cradle to the Grave\n\nHungaria\n\nHamlet, based on the play by Shakespeare\n\nHunnenschlacht (Battle of the Huns), based on a monumental fresco by painter Wilhelm von Kaulbach depicting the battle between Emperor Theoderic and Attila the Hun in 451\n\nDie Ideale based on a work by Friedrich von Schiller\n\nFaust Symphony, after the epic work by Goethe\n\nDante Symphony, after Dante's Divine Comedy\n\nThe Hope (2001), depicting the battle of Copenhagen\n\nMuch of Mahler's early work was designed programmatically.
