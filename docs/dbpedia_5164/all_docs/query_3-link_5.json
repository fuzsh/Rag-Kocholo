It was released on March 26, 2021,[1][2][3] by the band's own label AJR Productions. The album was produced by group member Ryan Met.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring a majority of the production of OK Orchestra, the album was titled Mad Orchestra, with AJR intending to make a \"Bang!\"-esque \"dark and evil sounding\" album. The band later decided on a more \"melancholy, longing, and hopeful\" sound, thinking of the negative mental repercussions that would come with writing a dark album. They replaced the album's \"Mad\" prefix with \"OK\" to represent the album's theme of \"being worried about becoming irrelevant and obsolete\" in the future but feeling OK in the current moment.[4] In an interview alongside Rivers Cuomo, AJR confirmed that the title of OK Orchestra was not based on either Radiohead's OK Computer or Weezer's OK Human,[5] the latter of which features the band on a remix of the track \"All My Favorite Songs\".\n\nPromotion and release\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2020, AJR released the album's first single, \"Bang!\", which became one of the trio's biggest hits ever in 2021 and in their entire time playing music. The single was originally intended as a track for a deluxe version of Neotheater, however this never came to fruition and the song eventually became the lead single for the forthcoming album.[6]\n\nOn August 31, 2020 they released the album's second single, \"Bummerland\", a song about the band sarcastically expressing their feelings on the COVID-19 pandemic. On December 20, 2020, they announced that OK Orchestra would be the name of their upcoming album, while also releasing the third single from the album, \"My Play\". It was put up for pre-order on iTunes/Apple Music[7] and showed that the album contained 13 tracks.[3] AJR released the album's fourth single \"Way Less Sad\" and its music video on February 17, 2021,[8][9] On March 21, 2021, AJR launched OKO World, an interactive experience playable on their official website.[10]\n\nAJR released a music video for \"OK Overture\" and \"World's Smallest Violin\" the same day the album was released. On June 23, almost three months later, they released a music video for \"3 O'Clock Things\". Two months afterwards on August 12, a music video for \"Christmas in June\" was released which featured footage filmed at the Wonderstruck Festival in Cleveland. On February 9, 2022, AJR released a music video for \"Ordinaryish People\".\n\nOK Orchestra Tour\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 31, 2021, a tour for OK Orchestra was announced by AJR. A majority of 2022 tour dates in the US went public on April 11 and September 23,[11][12] with an additional 12 dates in 2021 being published on July 27, 2021.[13] The tour sold over 350 thousand tickets across 50 shows in the US.[14]\n\nA concert from the European Leg of the tour was supposed to happen on October 22, 2022 at the 1930 Moscow Concert hall in Moscow, Russia. It was supposed to be the final concert of the tour. This concert was then cancelled due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 25, 2022.[15]\n\nAJR OK Orchestra Tour Dates Date City Country Venue North America September 7, 2021 Madison United States The Slyvee September 8, 2021 Grand Rapids DeltaPlex Arena & Conference Center September 12, 2021 Peoria Peoria Civic Center September 14, 2021 Des Moines Wells Fargo Arena September 15, 2021 Wichita Hartman Arena September 16, 2021 Oklahoma CIty Zoo Ampitheatre September 19, 2021 Norfolk Atlantic Union Bank Pavilion September 23, 2021 Albany The Palace Theatre (Albany, New York) September 24, 2021 Portland Cross Insurance Arena September 25, 2021 Wallingford Toyota Oakdale Theatre September 28, 2021 Louisville The Palace Theatre (Louisville, Kentucky) October 1, 2021 Jacksonville Daily's Place April 28, 2022 Dallas Toyota Music Factory April 29, 2022 Austin Circuit of the Americas April 30, 2022 Houston Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion May 3, 2022 Orlando Additional Financial Arena May 4, 2022 Tampa MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre May 6, 2022 Atlanta Ameris Bank Amphitheatre May 7, 2022 Raleigh Red Hat Amphitheater May 8, 2022 Charlotte PNC Music Pavilion May 10, 2022 Cincinnati Riverbend Music Center May 11, 2022 Cleveland Wolstein Center May 12, 2022 Columbus KEMBA Live!

Amorosi of Variety described the album as \"harmonically vocalized, hyper-memoir-centric, atmospheric mélange of pop, hip-hop, and doo-wop with quirky rhythms and a salting of smart-assed They Might Be Giants for tart taste\".[2] In a review for AllMusic, Matt Collar wrote that \"OK Orchestra isn't just full of hit-worthy pop hooks, it's stage-worthy, ambitious, and full of insights driven by AJR's personal experience\", rating the album 4/5.[16] Thomas Stremfel of Spectrum Culture received the album less positively, rating the album 1/5 and stating that \"hearing the terrible production and cringe-inducing songwriting of OK Orchestra without warning makes for an undeniably engaging listen... Year-end album lists should be filing restraining orders against this album, but that doesn't mean you can't listen to it for a cheap laugh.\"[17]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nThe album was nominated for Top Rock Album at the 2022 Billboard Music Awards alongside other bands Twenty One Pilots, Coldplay, and Imagine Dragons.[18]\n\nCommercial performance\n\n[edit]\n\nOK Orchestra debuted at number 10 on the US Billboard 200 dated April 10, 2021, becoming AJR's second top-10 album. It earned 32,000 album-equivalent units, including 13,000 pure album sales.[19] Although OK Orchestra placed at number 55 on the midweek UK Albums Chart dated March 29, 2021,[20] it did not place in the final listing on April 2.[21] Much of the album's popularity has been attributed to the singles \"Bang!\", \"Way Less Sad\", and \"World's Smallest Violin\".\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nCredits adapted from Tidal.[22]\n\nAJR\n\nAdam Met – bass guitar, instruments, vocals\n\nJack Met – lead vocals, instruments\n\nRyan Met – lead vocals, vocals, production (all tracks), instruments (2, 7), programming (2, 4, 12)\n\nAdditional personnel\n\nChris Gehringer – mastering\n\nJoe Zook – mixing\n\nAlba Avoricani – additional vocals (1, 3–6, 8–13)\n\nRuth Kornblatt-Stier – cello (1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10)\n\nDanny Ferenbach – violin (1, 3–6, 8–13), trumpet (12)\n\nEmelia Suljic – violin (1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10)\n\nAndrew Sobelsohn – slide guitar (1, 6)\n\nBarbara D Dirickson – narrator (1)\n\nChris Berry – drums (3, 6, 13)\n\nJosh Plotner – flute (3), clarinet (13)\n\nArnetta Johnson – trumpet (3, 9, 13)\n\nThe Beu Sisters – vocals (3)\n\nBas Janssen – trumpet engineer (3)\n\nKenny Urban – beatbox (5)\n\nCharlie Pellett – additional vocals (7)\n\nJJ Kirkpatrick – trumpet (7)\n\nBlue Man Group – ensemble (9)\n\nJeff Quay – percussion (9)\n\nMike Jones – sousaphone (9)\n\nKamila Stankiewicz – artwork\n\nChris Cerrato – design\n\nJader Souza – design\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications for OK Orchestra Region Certification Certified units/sales United States (RIAA)[34] Gold 500,000‡\n\n‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of 2021 albums (January–June)"
