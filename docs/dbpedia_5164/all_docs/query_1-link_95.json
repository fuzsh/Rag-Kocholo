        "text": "Microsoft and other Fortune 500 companies are already leveraging Semantic Kernel because itâs flexible, modular, and observable. Backed with security enhancing capabilities like telemetry support, and hooks and filters so youâll feel confident youâre delivering responsible AI solutions at scale.\n\nVersion 1.0+ support across C#, Python, and Java means itâs reliable, committed to non breaking changes. Any existing chat-based APIs are easily expanded to support additional modalities like voice and video.\n\nSemantic Kernel was designed to be future proof, easily connecting your code to the latest AI models evolving with the technology as it advances. When new models are released, youâll simply swap them out without needing to rewrite your entire codebase."
