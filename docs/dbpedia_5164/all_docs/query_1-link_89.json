So come and join in!\n\nYou are now on the English language edition of the Warhammer 40,000 Lexicanum. The complete content of this wiki currently consists of 40,488 Articles that have been edited 584,290 times. But the Warhammer 40,000 wiki also exists in German and French:\n\nWarhammer 40,000 Lexicanum in German\n\nWarhammer 40,000 Lexicanum in French\n\nOur Portals will help you to find your way around:\n\nFaction Portals Imperium Space Marines Astra Militarum Mechanicum Adepta Sororitas Inquisition Adeptus Custodes\n\nChaos Asuryani Drukhari Orks Necrons T'au Tyranids Genestealer Cults Leagues of Votann\n\nOther Portals Quotes Miniatures Galaxy Games Lexicanum Publications\n\nOverview of all Lexicanum wikis\n\nLexicanum does not only cover the Warhammer 40,000 setting, but also Games Workshop's other main game systems:\n\nExplore Our Warhammer Wikis Warhammer 40K Age of Sigmar Warhammer FB\n\nHow can I contribute\n\nThe Lexicanum as a wiki is a collaborative effort. This also means that it can only exist and thrive if people are willing to help to maintain, improve and expand it. At first the prospect of editing might seem like a daunting task to you - but don't worry about this, you can contribute to the Lexicanum in many ways, there are tasks suited to all levels of expertise and amount of time you have at your disposal. People who don't want or can't expand articles could for example help out in the essential mission to correct spelling or grammar mistakes or improve the writing style. You can find more suggestions of such \"easy\" (but as said nevertheless very necessary tasks) here.\n\nShould you decide to become an active member of the Lexicanum team the first thing you will have to do is to request an account (you will find all necessary information under this link). To avoid all potential misunderstandings: If you only want to read the Lexicanum you don't need an account. This is only necessary if you want to become an Editor. Requesting this absolutely free account obviously does not mean you have to edit, it is and always will be entirely up to you if and how much you want to contribute.\n\nShould you have decided to join the Lexicanum team we invite you to familiarize yourself with the rules and tools of the Lexicanum. They can be found here. There is also a place where you can play around and test out things like the wiki formating - the so-called Immaterium. Once you feel ready to edit articles, the best way is to choose one or more topics you feel most comfortable with or interested in and start contributing in a way you feel is suited to your skills and time.\n\nAs mentioned there is a number of rules for editing articles that you will learn over time. The first and most important rule you should learn however immediately is the following:\n\nLexicanum News\n\nLexicanum has an official YouTube Channel. Please subscribe!\n\nThe 10th Edition of Warhammer 40,000 has been released\n\nJoin our community Lexicanum Discord channel and chat with your fellow Lexicanum friends!\n\nThe Lexicanum has a Mobile template (you can set which style you want in the footer)\n\nFollow Lexicanum on Facebook and Twitter for daily news and updates!\n\nRegister and help us keep the Lexicanum current with all the breakneck GW releases!"
