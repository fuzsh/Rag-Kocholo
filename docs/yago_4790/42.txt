Godzilla (original title Gojira) is the original 1954 science fiction film featuring the legendary radiation-spewing "Kaiju". Directed by Ishirô Honda and starring Akira Takarada, Momoko Kôchi, Akihiko Hirata, Takashi Shimura, and Fuyuki Murakami, the film was viewed as a thinly veiled critique of the incendiary and atomic bombings of Japan during World War II. For its subsequent release in the United States in 1956 under the title Godzilla, King of the Monsters, the film was heavily edited to remove most of its references to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and several new scenes were shot that featured Raymond Burr. The Godzilla monster would be featured in numerous sequels throughout the last five decades, including a 1998 big budget "reimagining" from director Roland Emmerich. A new feature film adaptation, produced by Warner Bros. and directed by Gareth Edwards, was released in 2014 and formed the beginning of a new shared universe, named the "MonsterVerse".
