        "text": "As I mentioned very briefly in my last post, Godzilla was a film that had a ton of mishaps in its production, some of which affected the entire movie – and not in a good way! So, let’s look at the negative side of Godzilla’s production.\n\nOne month before the Lucky Dragon disaster of March 1st, 1954, a 44-year-old producer by the name of Tomoyuki Tanaka was returning to Toho Studios in a heated mess. The producer had gone to Indonesia to prepare a big-budget film called In the Shadow of Glory, a film that was going to be Toho’s first film in color.\n\nThe movie was going to be about a former Japanese soldier who fights for Indonesia during the War of Independence. As mentioned earlier, the film was a big deal – until it was scrapped by the Indonesian authorities due to an ongoing tension between Indonesia and Japan at the time.\n\nBecause of this, Tanaka needed an idea for a new film – and fast. On the plane ride home, Tanaka was very desperate and was constantly sweating. Trying to distract himself from the tension, he found an airplane magazine and started to read an article that a film critic had made on an American B-movie flick.\n\nThe movie was called The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms. It was an American film that was based on a short story by Ray Bradbury. The movie follows a giant beast (portrayed by legendary stop-motion animation by Ray Harryhausen) as it becomes awoken from the Arctic by nuclear weapons. After being awakened, it rampages through a city, destroying everything in its path.\n\nDespite being a typical B-movie, the film was a huge success, making $5 million at the box office (which, by today’s standards, is HUGE)! Tanaka liked the premise of the movie (because even though the Americans blew up Japan, the Japanese were obsessed with American culture) and decided to copy the movie, hoping to get the same or similar success.\n\nAfter arriving in Japan, Tanaka went right to work. He contacted the popular writer Shigeru Kayama, who had written a short story titled, “Jira Monster” in 1952. They collaborated together and wrote the first draft of Godzilla when it was titled The Giant Monster from 20,000 Miles Under the Sea.\n\nWhile Toho liked the idea of a giant monster awakened by nuclear bombs, they were also a little skeptical and nervous. Nothing like this was ever made in Japan at the time. The movie would be hella expensive and rather controversial with the discussion of nuclear weapons and all. Also, how would Japanese audiences react to a kaiju (monster) movie about the effects of nuclear bombs? How would they create a convincing creature that would make audiences scared to death?\n\nWith this in mind, Toho turned to special effects wizard Eiji Tsuburaya. He created the effects of many Japanese propaganda films, making him quite popular in mainstream media. Tsuburaya was enthusiastic to start the project, and Godzilla was green-lighted. But the movie wouldn’t have become such a classic if it were not for the director: Ishiro Honda.\n\nIshiro Honda was actually an odd choice to direct the film, as he had focused on wartime love stories and issue-driven films about female pearl divers. He actually didn’t even know if we wanted to make the project… until the recurring nightmare of the two atomic bombs plagued his mind. And, it was around this time that the Lucky Dragon incident was made public. So, after putting these into mind, Honda decided to make Godzilla so that he could vent about his problems to the public by turning them into a giant monster!\n\nIt turned out that Honda was the perfect choice to direct Godzilla, as he had an interest in science and a background in special effects.\n\nPretty soon, Honda and co-writer Takeo Murata finished the first draft of the script in June. It was actually very identical to the final film (since I already talked about the plot in a previous post, I’m not going to talk about it again).\n\nTanaka liked the script when it was presented to him in June of 1953 and he said that filming would begin in a little over a month. With this news, Honda was nervous. He was afraid the movie was going to fail horribly, or something was going to go wrong with the production of the movie to the point where it would end his career. Well, that almost happened.\n\nThe first part of filming began on August 1st, 1953. Godzilla was one of those movies where some parts were filmed on location. This was the case of the Odo Island scenes.\n\nThey filmed on a small, mountain island named Ijika, where the oppressive humidity caused the temperature to rise to 100 degrees. The actor for paleontologist Kyohei Yamane, Takashi Shimura, said that, because of the heat, filming was almost impossible. The actors hung out at the nearby city of Toba before they were transported by boat to the set. This took an hour and a half. Once arriving, four or five actors (actresses) are throwing up from the motion sickness and heat. Then, it took another hour to hike to the mountain, where there was absolutely no shade from the sun. At this point, filming wasn’t even a concern, as everyone was so focused on trying not to get sick from the intense heat.\n\nThe only person who didn’t even seem to care about the sun and heat was Honda. He filmed these scenes shirtless. He was so focused on the film that he ended up getting intense sunburns and blisters. Ouch!\n\nThe main problem with filming Godzilla was trying to imagine a giant monster. As I said earlier, this kind of thing had never been done before in Japan. Godzilla was the first Kaiju film in the country. It was difficult for the actors to imagine a giant monster rising his mighty head behind a hill.\n\nThe Ijika natives (who were extras in the movie) were the worst offender in this instance. They were indigenous people who were stuck in the stone age, as some of them had never even heard of a movie, let alone actually owned a TV. So, when Honda told them about what movie they would be starring in, they were quite puzzled about running from a creature that didn’t exist. But, all Honda told the people to do was run, so that made that part a lot easier.\n\nAnother problem with the movie was the acting. With the exception of Shimura, who was a veteran in the field of acting, the actress who played the paleontologist’s daughter, Emiko, was a newbie. The same went for the actor who played her love interest, Hideto Ogata. They needed coaching from the seasoned director constantly. At one point, Hideto’s actor said that he and the other actress were like schoolchildren, constantly asking Honda questions. Luckily, Honda was a patient man and tried to answer their questions as much as he could.\n\nThe next part of filming came in the form of the underwater scenes where Godzilla finally met his match with the Oxygen Destroyer.\n\nWhile these were not as hard to film as the Odo Island scenes, there were still plenty of challenges to overcome. The heat was still present and someone almost died trying to film the scene!\n\nA crew member forgot to turn on the cameraman’s air pump during the underwater filming of the scene. By the time someone had noticed something was wrong, the cameraman was floating on the top of the water, unconscious. Luckily, the man was saved and the crew avoided what would’ve been a tragedy.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the filming of the destruction of Tokyo. Because it was in a studio, the scenes were Godzilla destroyed Tokyo was very easy to film because there was no heat and danger of drowning. But because of a low budget, the crew was forced to use 1930s-style cameras and outdated nitrate film stock. While it made the movie look old and outdated, the cinematographer used this to his advantage to create a dark, noir setting that fit the movie’s premise and theme.\n\nLittle known fact: Originally, the monster was going to be portrayed by stop-motion, a common practice used in the original King Kong and The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms. But because of time and money, Godzilla became the most popular movie to use suitmation, where a guy lumbered around in a giant monster suit and hand puppets were used in close-ups of the giant beast. The hand puppets would later be replaced by animatronics in future movies.\n\nGodzilla’s design was based on a T-rex the suit designer saw in a magazine and the Rhedosaurus from The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms.\n\nWith this, the crew ran into its first problem: the actor who played Godzilla, Haruo Nakajima, did not know how to portray the creature. As I’ve said millions of times in this post, this was the first Kaiju movie from Japan, so no one knew how the monster would act. Honda simply said, “Just don’t act like a guy in a suit.”\n\nWhile these problems were pretty big, nothing could prepare Nakajima for the torture of living in the suit; and neither could the crew. The first suit was so heavy that Nakajima could hardly move. Even the second version of the suit, which was a lot lighter, was still too heavy for the actor. He suffered from sores and burns and he could only wear the suit for a couple of minutes. If he didn’t, he would pass out. It was so hot in the suit (140 degrees F) that the crew had to pour the actor’s sweat from the costume in-between takes. Yikes!\n\nDespite the discomfort, Nakajima never complained and he continued to wear the suit in future Godzilla movies!\n\nWhile the suit was being tweaked, the crew was busy building a 1:25 scale model Tokyo for Godzilla to destroy. On September 5th, filming of the destruction scenes began, and it was a disaster. Katsumi Tezuka was the first person in the Godzilla suit at the time and he was supposed to destroy the National Diet Building. Unfortunately, the actor tripped and fell on the miniature, destroying it.\n\nThe crew spent that night rebuilding the miniature and filming resumed the next morning, this time with Nakajima in the suit. The second take worked better than the first, but Tsuburaya, who was monitoring all of the monster scenes, didn’t like the final project. He found it to be very artificial.\n\nThen, after a grueling 122 days, filming of Godzilla wrapped and they were now entering the editing stage. Tsuburaya edited every scene with Godzilla in it to make it look like it wasn’t a guy in a suit. He was a perfectionist. He didn’t want the monster to look silly.\n\nThe editing process was finished rather quickly. Now, there was only one more thing standing in Godzilla’s way: there was no musical score. And without one, the movie looked stupid, according to Honda.\n\nBut then, a miracle happened in the form of a veteran composer: Akira Ifukube.\n\nWhen Ifukube was hired to do the musical score for Godzilla, he was quite happy to start the project, mainly because he was working with a small orchestra at the time. This made the music a little bit easier to compose. Using this small orchestra, Ifukube created the Godzilla theme song, a piece of music that would go on to be one of the greatest pieces of music in all of cinema.\n\nIfukube was also responsible for creating for the monster’s iconic roar you heard at the beginning of the song. After failing to create a convincing roar using a mix of animal sounds, he decided to get creative: he covered a glove in resin and rubbed it against the strings of a cello. He then slowed down the recording and the iconic sound was born!\n\nNow, everything was in order for the movie to be released. Everyone, especially Honda, was really nervous. But no one had to worry: on opening day, there was a line out the door of the theater and around the block!\n\nNakajima was one of the people in line waiting for the film. When he finally made it into the theater and started to watch the movie, he noticed a group of kids squirming around in the front during a particularly boring scene. But then, Godzilla appeared and the children looked at the screen, their eyes widened. This act alone made Nakajima cry.\n\nAnd that was the production of one of the greatest movies ever made. Not only was it a huge success in both Japan and the States, but it also spawned an entire genre of movies that many people know today as kaiju movies. They, along with American monster movies, are a staple of movie history; they are also still present in today’s pop culture!\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading, and RIP Haruo Nakajima, who died in mid-2017. You will be missed."
