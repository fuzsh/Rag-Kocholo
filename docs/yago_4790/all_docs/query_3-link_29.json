        "text": "When The Pedlar reviewed King Kong Vs. Godzilla back in June 2020, I speculated that the Japanese version would have been better than the American-Japanese co-production included in the Criterion release. It’s a pleasure to realise that the Japanese version is included in the bonus disc of supplements to its lavish box-set, and that it is indeed the superior film. Shorn of the English dialogue and the weak linking scenes that frame so much of the film as a television report from the other side of the world, Ishirō Honda manages to make the human stakes matter as much as the monster action.\n\nMuch more strongly than in the American version, Mr. Tako (Ichirō Arishima) emerges as the film’s MVP. He’s a hilariously comic role, a parodic satire of a media man who cares about nothing other than his ratings. When we first meet him, he’s bored watching the TV show they sponsor, and desperate to create excitement to get one up on his main rivals. And so, when he hears that a small island in the Solomon Islands is talking about the return of an Evil Monster Spirit, he sends out two of his best men to track it down and bring it back.\n\nThe advertising stakes are raised by the return of Godzilla, smashing his way out of an iceberg somewhere in the Arctic, and taking out an American submarine in the process. There are two salient points here. Firstly, while the threat of Godzilla is very real (and the ministers are very sanguine about their expectation that Godzilla will home in on Japan), for Mr. Tako it’s more about the fact that the rival newspapers have got the scoop and pictures of Godzilla, making his mission to retrieve a monster even more urgent. But perhaps more pertinently, the programme he is bored while watching is about climate change and the melting of the ice caps. As such, Godzilla – even back in 1963 – comes to represent a climate threat, the slumbering menace of global warming who is ignored by those more interested in immediate financial gain, but which quickly rears its head to threaten all life.\n\nNothing can redeem the racist blacking-up of the inhabitants of King Kong’s island, where Osamu and Kinsaburo find a tribe of Indigenous people performing ecstatic dances in celebration of Kong, their protector against monsters from the sea. The native peoples are afraid of Kong, but also recognise his importance; more importantly, they show Osamu and Kinsaburo how to lull the monster to sleep. This becomes important later when Kong grabs Osamu’s sister Fumiko; by playing a recording of the chanting and drumming along, the explorers are able to achieve the same effect. It’s a distasteful simulation of the appropriation of other cultures, and the extended dance sequences are difficult to watch.\n\nThe film at least creates a sense of fear for the humans, and the fact that Fumiko keeps getting into trouble is a welcome reminder of an era when Godzilla was the baddie. Fumiko is particularly rubbish at running away, but the realisation that one does have to hide from Godzilla and let the moment pass does make a difference, as do the extreme low angles that make Godzilla look distant and threatening (as opposed to the later films, where the camera more often frames Godzilla on a level). Here, the monster seems impossible to defeat, even for Kong, who shrugs in confusion and turns away after being hopelessly outclassed in their first encounter.\n\nThe final smackdown is brutal, with Godzilla laying heavily into Kong with rocks, burying him alive at one point, and the two eventually wrestling each other off a cliff. Here we see some of the first instances of the humour that would come to dominate the series, as well as the personalities of the beasts. But yet there’s still something of the epic and awesome about it, especially with the collateral damage to buildings (and presumably lives) as they fight. Throughout the film, Honda lingers on the state’s preparations for disaster, the evacuations, the preparations. It’s a film that, unlike Mr. Tako, insists on the importance of preparedness and taking threats seriously. Because even if Kong and Godzilla are having fun with their wrestling moves, their presence has major ramifications for the lives of those they encounter, and they can’t be ignored."
