        "text": "Godzilla incarnations\n\n← None\n\nGodzilla (First Generation)\n\nGodzilla (Second Generation) →\n\n“\n\nThis creature, according to the folklore of Odo Island, is called Godzilla.\n\n„\n\n— Kyohei Yamane (Godzilla)\n\nGodzilla (ゴジラ, Gojira) is a kaiju who first appeared in the 1954 film Godzilla.\n\nThe original Godzilla is a prehistoric amphibious sea creature that was disturbed and burned when an American hydrogen bomb test conducted in the Pacific Ocean destroyed his habitat and drew him to the surface. Godzilla unleashed his rage upon humanity, destroying any ships in his vicinity and eventually laying waste to Odo Island and the city of Tokyo. Daisuke Serizawa eventually used his invention, the Oxygen Destroyer, to kill Godzilla, while taking his own life to ensure the weapon could never be used again. Typically, in the various continuities of the Godzilla franchise, a second Godzilla appears sometime after this Godzilla's death. Despite only being the focus of one film, the First Generation Godzilla has been referenced to some degree in several entries in the series since. In the film Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla, the remains of this Godzilla were salvaged by the Japanese government and converted into a bio-robot dubbed Kiryu in order to battle against a second Godzilla. However, the original Godzilla's spirit remained attached to the machine, and at some points even took possession of Kiryu and rebelled against its human masters.\n\nName\n\nGodzilla's Japanese name, Gojira (ゴジラ), is a combination of the Japanese approximation of \"gorilla,\" gorira (ゴリラ), and the Japanese word for \"whale,\" kujira (クジラ). In-universe, Godzilla's name is known to the natives of Odo Island by the ateji spelling 呉爾羅 (Gojira); the kanji do not have any intended meaning, and are simply used for sound. On at least the cover of one of the revisions of the film's script, Godzilla's name was instead spelled as ゴヂラ, though still pronounced as Gojira.\n\nThis specific incarnation of Godzilla is typically designated as the First Generation Godzilla (初代ゴジラ, Shodai Gojira), in order to distinguish him from subsequent incarnations. ShodaiGoji (初代ゴジ) is also used for short, and is the nickname of his suit design. It is debated who exactly devised Godzilla's name and why. In his 1998 book Godzilla Days, Japanese author Shinichi Kabuki posits that the Gojira name was decided upon by producer Tomoyuki Tanaka, who took inspiration from a Toho employee nicknamed \"Gujira\" (グジラ), a different combination of gorira and kujira. Kabuki continues that, after Tanaka's idea was received positively around the studio, the film's codename \"Project G\" was officially changed to Godzilla. However, in their 2017 book Ishiro Honda: A Life in Film, from Godzilla to Kurosawa, Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski state that \"there is evidence\" to suggest storywriter Shigeru Kayama had already written of a \"Gojira\" in his diaries by the time that his treatment for Project G was completed. They also acknowledge the employee nickname story, albeit an alternate telling in which the man was nicknamed Gojira (rather than Gujira); Tanaka, Ishiro Honda, and Eiji Tsuburaya are all noted to have cited this explanation over the years, but the authors conclude that \"this bit of studio folklore has never been satisfactorily corroborated.\" Of the potential origin story, Honda's wife Kimi was quoted as saying, \"I suspect the name was thought up after very careful discussion between Mr. Tanaka, Mr. Tsuburaya, and my husband. [...] The backstage boys at Toho loved to joke around with tall stories, but I don't believe that one.\" Despite this, in a 2001 episode of the NHK documentary series PROJECT X ~Challengers~, entitled \"The Birth of Godzilla,\" it was asserted that \"Gojira\" was a real employee of Toho's theater department named Shiro Amikura. Named as such for his gorilla-like appearance and love of whale meat, the documentary credited Tsuburaya with taking notice of Amikura while eating in the studio cafeteria, and recounted that the man had even once proclaimed \"I'm the monster Godzilla!\" when coming home to his family.[10]\n\nContrary to popular belief, the English translation \"Godzilla\" was not invented by the American distributors of the original film. Before Toho sold the film to U.S. distributors, the company's international division had already marketed English-subtitled prints of the film under the title Godzilla, which were shown briefly in Japanese-American theaters. The name was personally chosen by Iwao Mori, then-head of Toho's Production Division, who was presented with three possible translations: Gojira, Gozila, and Godila. Mori liked the use of \"God\" in Godila, but suggested the addition of a Z after consulting a foreigner.[11]\n\nIn Gigantis, the Fire Monster, the American theatrical version of Godzilla Raids Again, this Godzilla is instead referred to as the first \"Angurus.\" It is explained that Godzilla (\"Gigantis\") and Anguirus (\"Angurus\") come from the same lineage of Angurus \"fire monsters,\" in keeping with producer Paul Schreibman's decision to market the film as an original work rather than a sequel to Godzilla, King of the Monsters!\n\nDesign\n\nMain article: ShodaiGoji#Design.\n\nPersonality\n\nThe original Godzilla was a prehistoric creature whose underwater habitat was completely destroyed by a hydrogen bomb test which also killed his family and burned and scarred him. With his home and kin taken from him, Godzilla unleashed his vengeance upon humankind, destroying most human vessels he came across and eventually laying waste to the city of Tokyo.[6] In the Kiryu series continuity, Godzilla remained aggressive towards humankind as his spirit was first awakened and took control of Kiryu, causing as much destruction as possible while allowing his energy reserves to deplete. While Anti-Megalosaurus Force engineers were temporarily able to suppress his spirit, he took over Kiryu again during another confrontation with Godzilla, this time sinking both himself and the monster in the Pacific Ocean to resolve the conflict. Just before plunging into the depths, he opened a door to release mechanic Yoshito Chujo, who had been trapped inside him, and displayed a farewell message to him.\n\nOrigins\n\nIn the original Godzilla, it is proposed that Godzilla was a type of prehistoric intermediary reptile related to both land and sea reptiles that slept deep underwater for millions of years feeding on deep sea organisms before being disturbed and enhanced by an American hydrogen bomb test. Dr. Kyohei Yamane proposes that the original Godzilla might have been living among others of his kind prior to the detonation, but the H-bomb completely destroyed his home and drew him out. This idea is supported by official artwork of the 1954 Godzilla living with other Godzillas underwater before a huge explosion destroys his habitat, killing his companions and burning and enraging Godzilla and drawing him to the surface.[6] After the original Godzilla is killed, Yamane proposes that other Godzillas may have survived to the present day and could be awakened by future nuclear tests. This explains how in the various continuities that encompass the series, multiple individual Godzillas have appeared.\n\nHistory\n\nGodzilla (1954)\n\nGodzilla Raids Again (1955) [stock footage]\n\nVaran (1958) [stock footage, erroneous]\n\nMonster Booska (TV 1966-1967) [episode 1, stock footage]\n\nThe Return of Godzilla (1984) [photograph]\n\nGodzilla 1985 (1985) [stock footage]\n\nGodzilla vs. King Ghidorah (1991) [photograph]\n\nGodzilla vs. Destoroyah (1995) [stock footage]\n\nGodzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack (2001) [mentioned]\n\nGodzilla Against Mechagodzilla (2002)\n\nGodzilla: Tokyo SOS (2003) [stock footage]\n\nGodzilla Final Wars (2004) [stock footage]\n\nShowa era\n\nGodzilla (1954)\n\nFollowing an American hydrogen bomb test at Bikini Atoll in the South Pacific Ocean, a giant prehistoric reptile was disturbed from its underwater slumber and heavily irradiated. The monster began attacking various ships in the waters off Japan, prompting a search party to be sent to Odo Island, where some of the survivors had washed ashore. The islanders believed the shipwrecks were caused by Godzilla, a giant sea monster from their folklore which they believed would come ashore to feed on humanity. One night, a typhoon struck the island, leaving it devastated. However, it was apparent most of the damage was caused by something other than a typhoon, as houses in the village appeared to have been crushed from above. A research team headed by Kyohei Yamane was sent to the island, and discovered a giant radioactive footprint on the island, with a Trilobite embedded in it. Suddenly, the monster that was responsible for the shipwrecks and the damage on the island appeared over a hill on the island. The people fled upon realizing the enormous presence of the 50-meter creature. Back in Japan, Yamane named the creature \"Godzilla\" after the monster from Odo Island folklore, and proposed it was a transitional organism from the Jurassic Period, related to both land-living and sea-dwelling reptiles. Yamane believed that Godzilla was exposed to a recent American H-bomb test, hence the radiation found in his footprint, and stressed the monster should be studied to see how he survived to this point. The JSDF sent battleships to destroy Godzilla with depth charges, declaring him dead. However, Godzilla soon surfaced in Tokyo Bay completely unharmed, plunging Japan and the international community into a state of emergency. One night, Godzilla came ashore in Tokyo, destroying the outskirts of the city before returning to the bay. In response, the JSDF erected a barrier of power lines around the heart of Tokyo, with 50,000 volts of electricity passing through them, in the hopes they would halt Godzilla. When Godzilla came ashore again another night, he tore through the power lines and melted them with a beam of radioactive heat fired from his mouth. The JSDF fired on Godzilla with artillery and tanks, but their weapons had no effect. Godzilla proceeded into downtown Tokyo, transforming the Japanese capital into a sea of flame overnight. With his rampage concluded, Godzilla returned to the bay, where he was attacked by F-86F Sabre fighter jets before finally disappearing beneath the waves.\n\nIn the aftermath of Godzilla's raid, Tokyo was an uninhabitable wasteland, burned to a crater and contaminated with deadly radiation. The Japanese government was at a loss in combating the monster and preventing future attacks. Scientist Daisuke Serizawa was approached by his former fiance Emiko Yamane and her boyfriend Hideto Ogata, who asked for him to use his experimental chemical weapon, the Oxygen Destroyer, against Godzilla. Serizawa was horrified by the idea of revealing his invention to the world and refused at first, but was convinced after watching a television program showing Japanese schoolchildren singing a song praying for peace. Serizawa burned his notes on the Oxygen Destroyer and handed it over to the JSDF. A boat was sent to Tokyo Bay, using a Geiger counter to locate Godzilla underwater. Serizawa and Ogata donned diving suits to go underwater and detonate the device. Once they reached Godzilla, who was sitting on the ocean floor, Ogata was pulled to the surface while Serizawa severed his line and activated the device, sacrificing his own life to stop Godzilla and prevent his weapon from ever falling into the wrong hands. After a few moments, Godzilla rose to the surface and roared defiantly at the boat before sinking under the waves to his death. While the people on the boat both celebrated Godzilla's demise and mourned Serizawa's sacrifice, Dr. Yamane solemnly warned that it was unlikely Godzilla was the last member of his species, and that if mankind continued nuclear testing, another Godzilla would almost certainly appear.\n\nGodzilla Raids Again\n\nAfter pilots Shoichi Tsukioka and Koji Kobayashi witnessed a second Godzilla battling another monster called Anguirus on Iwato Island, Dr. Yamane was brought to Osaka to meet with city officials to discuss countermeasures. Yamane showed footage of the first Godzilla's Tokyo rampage from a year prior, and expressed his regret in saying there was no reliable way to combat Godzilla with Dr. Serizawa and the Oxygen Destroyer both gone forever. He did however remark that the first Godzilla had a peculiar instinct toward lights and was enraged by and drawn to them, likely because they reminded him of the hydrogen bomb explosion. Assuming this second Godzilla possessed the same instinct, Yamane proposed instituting a citywide blackout in Osaka, while using flares to lure Godzilla away from the city.\n\nHeisei era\n\nThe Return of Godzilla\n\nWhen interviewing Hiroshi Okumura about the giant monster that supposedly attacked the fishing boat he was on, Doctor Hayashida showed him photographs taken of the original Godzilla's attack in 1954. After viewing the photographs, Okumura confirmed that the creature he saw was Godzilla.\n\nGodzilla vs. Destoroyah\n\nWhen Godzilla's heart became unstable after absorbing an excessive amount of radiation from a uranium explosion on Baas Island, G-Force determined that he would eventually explode, setting off a chain reaction that would cause the planet's atmosphere to ignite and wipe out all life on Earth. G-Force sought out the expertise of Dr. Yamane's grandson Kenkichi, who had written a thesis paper on Godzilla's biology. Kenkichi proposed that the only way to prevent this cataclysm was to kill Godzilla before he exploded. He stated that they had to kill this Godzilla the same way they killed the first Godzilla, using the Oxygen Destroyer. Kenkichi's aunt Emiko had warned his sister Yukari that Dr. Kensaku Ijuin's recently-unveiled invention, Micro-Oxygen, was dangerously similar to the weapon her friend Daisuke Serizawa had given his own life to ensure would never be used again. Kenkichi convinced Yukari to go against their aunt's wishes and try to get Ijuin to recreate the weapon. However, Ijuin had recently performed analysis on the soil from the part of Tokyo Bay where the Oxygen Destroyer was detonated to kill the first Godzilla in 1954, and found that it had caused microbes trapped in the strata since the Precambrian Era to revive and begin evolving abnormally.\n\nMillennium era\n\nGodzilla vs. Megaguirus\n\nDisclaimer: While the Godzilla featured in Godzilla vs. Megaguirus is stated to be the same Godzilla that attacked in 1954, it is treated as a separate incarnation of the character.\n\nMain article: Godzilla (Godzilla vs. Megaguirus).\n\nIn 1954, Godzilla was awakened by nuclear testing, and immediately vented his rage against Tokyo, annihilating the entire city in one night. After leaving Tokyo in ruins, Godzilla slipped into Tokyo Bay and vanished. The damage was so great that the Japanese government was forced to move its capital to Osaka. Over the next decade, Japan began rebuilding and recovering from Godzilla's attack, embracing nuclear power in the process. However, in 1966, Godzilla returned to feed on the nuclear plant in Tokai, leading Japan to realize that the monster was attracted to nuclear power. Japan's nuclear program was shelved, but the nation struggled to find alternate energy sources over the next several decades. A breakthrough was made in the 1990's in the form of plasma energy, a renewable, efficient and non-nuclear energy source that had the potential to power Japan well into the future. However, Godzilla would choose to feed on this plasma energy in the absence of nuclear energy, and attacked a plasma reactor in Osaka in 1996.\n\nGodzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack\n\nIn 1954, Japan suffered an attack from Godzilla. The monster laid waste to Tokyo, transforming the once-proud capital of Japan into ground zero of a nuclear disaster overnight. Godzilla was finally killed with an experimental chemical weapon, while the weapon's inventor took his own life to ensure it could never be used again. In order to avoid facing ridicule for failing to stop Godzilla and ensure the citizens of Japan they were safe from future attacks, the JSDF claimed credit for killing Godzilla. Over the next several decades, humanity gradually began to forget about Godzilla, with many assuming the creature never existed and was simply a legend. However, a second Godzilla emerged to seek horrible vengeance against Japan in 2002.\n\nGodzilla Against Mechagodzilla\n\nMain article: Kiryu.\n\nIn 1954, Godzilla appeared and laid waste to Tokyo before being killed by Daisuke Serizawa's Oxygen Destroyer. In the decades that followed, Japan was frequently attacked by giant monsters, including Mothra and Gaira. The Anti-Megalosaurus Force (AMF) was formed to combat these creatures, armed with advanced space-age weapons known as Maser Cannons. In 1999, a second Godzilla suddenly came ashore at Tateyama during a typhoon. The AMF was deployed, with their new Type 90 Maser Cannons, to stop Godzilla's rampage. To the AMF's shock, Maser Cannons had no effect on Godzilla, and only served to further enrage him. Godzilla destroyed most of the Maser Cannons attacking him and roared victoriously into the air, with lightning striking his dorsal fins. In the aftermath of the attack, the Japanese government was scrambling to find a new way to fight Godzilla. When the first Godzilla's intact skeleton was discovered off Boso Peninsula, it was decided to use it to construct a mechanical Godzilla to fight the new one. By 2003, the anti-Godzilla weapon built around the first Godzilla's skeleton, codenamed Kiryu, was completed. However, the original Godzilla's restless spirit remained attached to the skeleton, and during Kiryu's first battle against the new Godzilla, it was reawakened upon hearing his roar. Kiryu then went berserk, believing itself to be Godzilla once again, and destroyed much of the surrounding area before powering down. Kiryu was repaired and reprogrammed afterward to prevent it from going berserk again, and was launched into battle against Godzilla once more. This time, Kiryu and Godzilla fought to a draw, with an injured Godzilla wading out to sea and Kiryu being left badly damaged.\n\nGodzilla: Tokyo SOS\n\nJust one year after Godzilla and Kiryu's epic battle, Mothra's Shobijin appeared to Shinichi Chujo and warned him that the first Godzilla's bones must be returned to their resting place in the sea, and that it was blasphemous to use them as a weapon. The Shobijin stated that Mothra would have to declare war on humanity if the bones were not returned, and that she did not want to do that. Chujo spoke to the Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Igarashi, who stated that too many resources had been sunk into the Kiryu project for it to be scrapped now. He expressed his hope that Kiryu would one day kill the current Godzilla, after which the project could finally be scrapped. Meanwhile, Kiryu's former operator Akane Yashiro told one of the mecha's mechanics that she could sense that Kiryu no longer wanted to fight Godzilla. When Godzilla and Mothra both appeared in Tokyo, Kiryu was launched into battle once again. After Godzilla was subdued by the combined efforts of Kiryu and Mothra's larvae, Kiryu was ordered to finish Godzilla once and for all. However, the original Godzilla's spirit was awakened yet again and took control of Kiryu. Rather than kill Godzilla, Kiryu simply restrained him and flew out to sea, sinking itself along with Godzilla in the Japanese trench. As Kiryu sank into the trench, the first Godzilla's spirit was finally put at rest and Kiryu deactivated.\n\nThe original Godzilla's skeleton\n\nAbilities\n\nIncandescent light\n\nGodzilla can exhale a powerful radioactive incandescent light (白熱光, hakunekkō, lit. white-hot light), or atomic breath (放射熱線, hōsha nessen, lit. radioactive heat ray),[12] which takes the form of a white vapor. It is hot enough to melt metal and cause raging fires that can spread across entire city blocks. Whenever Godzilla attacked a human vessel in the water from below, his breath boiled the ocean instantly and reduced said vessel to a sinking shipwreck.\n\nDurability\n\nThe original Godzilla displayed an immunity to conventional weaponry, being virtually impervious to everything the JSDF threw at him, including power lines charged with 50,000 volts. Dr. Kyohei Yamane noted that Godzilla's ability to survive exposure to a hydrogen bomb explosion was a testament to his durability. While he was disintegrated by the Oxygen Destroyer in Godzilla (1954), the weapon left his skeleton completely intact in the Kiryu series continuity, and it was recovered by the Japanese government over 40 years later.\n\nAmphibiousness\n\nThough technically a reptile and not an amphibian, Godzilla has an amphibious lifestyle, spending time both on land and at sea. He is capable of remaining completely submerged underwater for long periods of time, and it is suggested by Dr. Yamane that he survived for millions of years living inside a deep underwater cavern. Godzilla's atomic breath is not impeded while underwater, shown when he obliterates boats with it while completely submerged underwater. While underwater, Godzilla can swim or simply march across the sea floor.\n\nPhysical abilities\n\nGodzilla employed his tail, his fangs, and his sheer brute force while tearing through Tokyo. His strength is enough to tear apart and demolish enormous structures, including uplifting a bridge and dumping it in Tokyo Bay during his second rampage through the city and toppling a radio tower.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nGodzilla was ultimately killed by the Oxygen Destroyer, a weapon that contained a chemical compound that liquefies oxygen atoms, causing living creatures to asphyxiate and disintegrate. The Oxygen Destroyer was the first, and in many ways the only, weapon to defeat Godzilla, liquefying the monster on a sub-atomic level. However, in Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla, the original film's ending is altered so that Godzilla's skeleton remained intact, with the monster's spirit still attached to it.\n\nVideo games\n\nCinemaScope Adventure: Godzilla (1984) - NEC PC-8801 and Fujitsu FM-7\n\nGodzilla (1993) - NEC PC-9801 [stills]\n\nGodzilla Generations (1998) - Sega Dreamcast\n\nGodzilla: Trading Battle (1998) - Sony PlayStation\n\nGodzilla: Giant Monsters All-Out Typing Attack (2001) - IBM PC/AT, NEC PC98-NX [opening, end credits]\n\nGodzilla: Unleashed (2007) - Nintendo Wii\n\nMonster Strike (2013) - Android and iOS\n\nGodzilla (2014) - PlayStation 3 and 4 [Kaiju Guide]\n\nGodzilla Kaiju Collection (2015) - Android and iOS\n\nKai-Ri-Sei Million Arthur (2014; added in 2016) - Android and iOS\n\nGodzilla Defense Force (2019) - Android and iOS\n\nGodzilla Battle Line (2021; added in 2022) - Android and iOS\n\nXR World (2022) - Android, iOS, and PC\n\nMinecraft: Bedrock Edition (2011; added in 2024) - Windows 10, Windows 11, Xbox One, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Fire OS/TV, Android, iOS, Windows Mobile, Samsung Gear VR\n\nGodzilla 1954 in Godzilla Kaiju Collection\n\nGodzilla: Unleashed\n\nGodzilla 1954 bio\n\n\"The original king of the monsters, this towering behemoth was the first post-war radioactive monster unleashed upon the world. Godzilla '54's atomic-powered body was so powerful that each footprint he left was a crater seeping with lethal radiation. The infamous day that Godzilla rose from the sea to conquer Tokyo will be remembered as the beginning of the humanity's epic struggle against the reign of giant monsters.\"\n\nIn the Wii version of Godzilla: Unleashed, all three Godzilla incarnations are playable, each with a few differences between them, but all are fairly alike. Godzilla is simple to control, and with many different fearsome attacks, he is able to easily floor multiple monsters at once. Although his combat ability might be lacking in some regards, he still retains the deadly atomic breath ray which is an easy attack to execute and deals a lot of damage.\n\nIn the Wii version of the game, Godzilla 2000 is the only incarnation that can be played in Story mode. Godzilla 1954 and Godzilla 1990's are only playable in Brawl mode, although Godzilla 1990's is playable in Story mode in the PlayStation 2 version of the game.\n\nGodzilla (PlayStation 3 / PlayStation 4)\n\nKaiju Guide\n\nMain article: Godzilla (2014 video game)/Kaiju_Guide#Godzilla (Showa Series).\n\nGodzilla Battle Line\n\nGodzilla\n\nStars: ★★★★\n\nEnergy cost: 6\n\nAttack speed: 2.6 seconds\n\nTarget: Leader/Ground/Aerial/Facility\n\nMovement speed: 11\n\nSearch range: 60\n\nReach: 60\n\nGodzilla(Tokyo ver.)\n\nStars: ★★★★\n\nEnergy cost: 6\n\nAttack speed: 3 seconds\n\nTarget: Leader/Ground/Aerial/Facility\n\nMovement speed: 15\n\nSearch range: 55\n\nReach: 55\n\nIcon\n\nFragment\n\nFragment\n\nSticker\n\nComics\n\nScience Adventure Picture Story: Godzilla (1954)\n\nMonster Godzilla (1954)\n\nMonster Picture Story: Godzilla (1955)\n\nGodzilla vs. Destoroyah (1995) - Rippu Shobo [flashback]\n\nGallery\n\nMain article: ShodaiGoji#Gallery.\n\nSightings\n\nMain article: Godzilla in popular culture.\n\nRoar\n\nWhen he first signed onto Godzilla, composer Akira Ifukube thought that the monster, being a reptile, shouldn't roar at all.[13] Director Ishiro Honda explained it as another consequence of his mutation by nuclear testing. Sound technicians Ichiro Minawa and Hisashi Shimonaga tried modifying the cries of lions, tigers, and night herons recorded at Ueno Zoo, but everything they produced was still too natural. It was Ifukube who hit upon the idea of using a musical instrument: the contrabass. He unwound the E string and recorded his assistant, Sei Ikano, drawing his hands across it with gloves covered in pine tar. Minawa then manipulated the speed of the recordings, added echoes, and overlaid some of the animal sounds he had previously gathered. This roar would later be altered for use as the roar of other Toho monsters, including Varan, Baragon, and Gorosaurus.\n\nGodzilla's roar can be written in readable characters and has been done so in comics, and not only by a simple \"roar.\" In Japanese, the official onomatopoeia for Godzilla's roar is \"Gyaoon\" (ギャオーン, Gyaōn)--additional \"o\"s can be added to extend the roar.\n\nVideos\n\nKaiju Profile: Godzilla 1954\n\nTrivia\n\nIn the American version of the first Godzilla film, Dr. Kyohei Yamane estimates Godzilla's height as \"over 400 feet,\" more than twice his canonical height.\n\nIn explaining the existence of Minilla in the book Definitive Edition Godzilla Introduction, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka speculated that this Godzilla could have been female.[14]\n\nThe first and, by extent, second Showa Godzillas' weights of 20,000 metric tons are said to be equal to that of 5,000 elephants.[12]\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nThis is a list of references for Godzilla (First Generation).
