Produced by Toho, it is the 10th installment in the Godzilla series as well as the Showa series. It stars Kenji Sahara, Machiko Naka, Tomonori Yazaki, Hideyo Amamoto, Sachio Sakai, and Kazuo Suzuki. The film was released to Japanese theaters by Toho on December 20, 1969, as part of the Winter Toho Champion Festival.[1] Henry G. Saperstein's United Productions of America prepared an English-dubbed version of the film titled Godzilla's Revenge which was released to American theaters by Maron Films on December 8, 1971 as a double feature with Island of the Burning Damned.\n\nReleased just one year after the Godzilla series' intended finale, Destroy All Monsters, and with monster scenes consisting mostly of stock footage culled from Ebirah, Horror of the Deep and Son of Godzilla, All Monsters Attack was the franchise's first entry to be aimed primarily at children, setting off a new campaign of films under the Toho Champion Festival banner. It follows Ichiro Miki, a latchkey kid living in Tokyo who daydreams about visiting Monster Island, the home of Godzilla, his son Minilla, and other famous kaiju. Ichiro befriends Minilla and learns that just like him, he deals with bullying, specifically from the giant toad monster Gabara. Ichiro helps Minilla face his tormentor and triumph, while the lessons in bravery Ichiro learns from Minilla inspire him to escape when he finds himself kidnapped by two bank robbers. All Monsters Attack was the final Godzilla film produced prior to the death of special effects director Eiji Tsuburaya, who received a supervisor credit on the film. It was followed by Godzilla vs. Hedorah in 1971.\n\nPlot\n\nA young boy named Ichiro Miki walks home from school alongside his friend Sachiko. After a brief run-in with his father, a train driver, the two come across an abandoned factory. Despite Sachiko’s warning, he crawls under the fence to investigate. Immediately, a group of bullies surround him, led by a boy named Sanko, whom Ichiro refers to as \"Gabara.\" Sachiko leaves with her mother, leaving Ichiro alone. Gabara takes a vacuum tube he found earlier in his walk, and then tells him he can have it back if he honks the horn on a bike belonging to a sign-painter nearby. Ichiro refuses and runs away as the bullies jeer.\n\nAt his apartment, Ichiro visits his neighbor Shinpei Minami, a toymaker, who is working on a miniature computer for children. When he turns it on, a voice begins talking about the Moon. Ichiro is unimpressed, saying that he would prefer visiting Monster Island instead, where monsters like Godzilla, Rodan, and Minilla live. He then begins telling Shinpei about the bully Gabara. Shinpei encourages him to stand up for himself. Ichiro, realizing it is getting late, heads to his home. He prepares his own supper, per his mother’s instructions, and watches a news report of a bank robbery with disinterest. To entertain himself, he pretends to contact Monster Island through a toy radio. He imagines himself traveling to the island on a passenger jet.\n\nUpon arrival, he immediately witnesses Godzilla fighting three Kamacuras, killing two of them as one escapes. Climbing up a tree, he spots Gorosaurus, Manda, Anguirus, and a Giant Eagle, who engages Godzilla. After a scuffle, Godzilla sends the monster plummeting into the sea to his death with a blast of his atomic ray. The surviving Kamacuras then takes notice of Ichiro, and he falls down a hole while trying to run away. The Kamacuras peers into the hole, but moves on. As he struggles to climb out, someone lowers a vine and lifts him out. When he gets to the surface, he is surprised to see a cheerful, human-sized Minilla, Godzilla's son. Their conversation is interrupted by the warble of a giant toad monster, who also happens to be named Gabara. Like Ichiro, Minilla is bullied by Gabara and is too afraid to fight him.\n\nIchiro, now asleep, is awakened by Shinpei, who tells the boy that his mother will be home late. Wandering around outside, Ichiro encounters Gabara's gang again and runs away after they call him over. His escape leads him into the same abandoned factory. The bullies follow him, but are distracted by a passing police car. A locker door behind Ichiro then falls to the ground, drawing his attention. He finds a pair of dusty headphones inside, and a driver's license nearby. Above the license, he spots a hole in the ceiling. Before he can go upstairs, loud sirens send him running out of the factory.\n\nAs soon as he leaves, the two bank robbers, Senbayashi and Okuda, emerge from hiding. Senbayashi berates Okuda for letting his license fall down the hole, and sends him after Ichiro to get it back. Back at his apartment building, Ichiro eats dinner with Shinpei, and asks not to be awakened the next time he falls asleep, as he plans to visit Godzilla and Minilla again. Unfortunately, the first monster he comes upon is Gabara, who chases him for a time. Upon escaping, he encounters Minilla again, who laments his distant relationship with Godzilla. They watch with admiration as Godzilla defeats Ebirah and Kumonga in successive battles. Minilla decides to confront Gabara, growing to giant size - though he is still only half the beast's height. His smoke rings have no effect on Gabara, who pummels him mercilessly. Reverting to his human-sized form, Minilla retreats alongside Ichiro. They watch Godzilla destroy a squadron of fighter jets, the latest human incursion on Monster Island. Godzilla calls Minilla over and attempts to teach him to generate an atomic ray; he is unable to until Godzilla steps on his tail. As Ichiro cheers his success, a plant monster seizes him from behind. He awakens to the sight of the two robbers, who kidnap him at knifepoint and take him to the factory.\n\nAs Senbayashi keeps an eye on Ichiro, Okuda breaks into Shinpei’s car. Ichiro quietly covers the hole in the floor with newspapers and begins to daydream about Monster Island again. There, Minilla is fighting another losing battle against Gabara. Ichiro helps by pushing a boulder onto Minilla’s tail, allowing him to fire an atomic ray into Gabara's face. A newly confident Minilla easily evades the monster's attempts to grab him. Godzilla arrives on the scene, but refuses to enter the fight himself. Minilla tries to attack Gabara head-on again, but is overpowered and retreats. Ichiro suggests that Minilla use a fallen tree as a see-saw, jumping down on one end after he taunts Gabara into standing on the other. The plan is a success, and Gabara goes flying through the air. Godzilla congratulates Minilla on his victory, only to be bitten on the leg by Gabara. The resulting fight is one-sided, with Gabara running away after Godzilla flips him over his shoulder.\n\nIchiro reacts with fear as Godzilla reaches for him, only to be shaken awake by Senbayashi. Okuda returns with the car, and they plan to leave with Ichiro. Inspired by Minilla's example, he breaks free of the handkerchiefs they used to tie his hands, running back inside the factory. The robbers, thoroughly on edge, split up to find him. Outside, Shinpei happens upon his car. Stunned by the stolen money inside, he calls the police.\n\nIchiro tricks Okuda into falling through the hole on the second floor and wards off Senbayashi with a fire extinguisher, buying enough time for the police to arrive and arrest them both. The next morning, Ichiro’s mother vows not to work at night anymore. Reporters surround him as he leaves for school; he surprises them by saying that Minilla was with him as he fought the robbers. Shinpei explains that Minilla is a type of god to children.\n\nIchiro and Sachiko encounter Gabara and his gang again, but this time Ichiro rushes into a fight with the bully. He then runs over to the sign-painter and honks his motorcycle's horn. He falls from his ladder, getting paint on his face, and chases after Ichiro. He runs into his father driving a train and asks him to stall the painter with an apology. Now accepted by the gang, he continues on his way to school with them.\n\nStaff\n\nMain article: All Monsters Attack/Credits.\n\nStaff role on the left, staff member's name on the right.\n\nDirected by Ishiro Honda\n\nWritten by Shinichi Sekizawa\n\nExecutive producer Tomoyuki Tanaka\n\nMusic by Kunio Miyauchi\n\nTheme song \"Monster March\"\n\nPerformed by Lily Sasaki, Tokyo Children's Choir[a]\n\nComposed by Gendai Kano\n\nLyrics by Shinichi Sekizawa\n\nArranged by Hitoshi Kosugi\n\nCinematography by Motoyoshi Tomioka\n\nEdited by Masahisa Himi\n\nProduction design by Takeo Kita\n\nFirst assistant director Masaaki Hisamatsu\n\nSpecial effects supervisor Eiji Tsuburaya\n\nDirectors of special effects Ishiro Honda, Teruyoshi Nakano (uncredited)\n\nFirst assistant director of special effects Teruyoshi Nakano[3]\n\nCast\n\nActor's name on the left, character played on the right.\n\nTomonori Yazaki as Ichiro Miki\n\nKenji Sahara as Kenkichi Miki, Ichiro's father\n\nMachiko Naka as Tamie Miki, Ichiro's mother\n\nHideyo Amamoto as Shinpei Minami, toy consultant\n\nSachio Sakai as Senbayashi, bank robber\n\nKazuo Suzuki as Okuda, bank robber\n\nIkio Sawamura as bartender\n\nShigeki Ishida as landlord\n\nYutaka Sada as Hei, trainman\n\nChotaro Togin as young detective\n\nYutaka Nakayama as billboard painter\n\nYoshibumi Tajima as middle-aged detective\n\nJunichi Ito as Sanko (\"Gabara\"), bully\n\nToru Mori, Toshiya Kurokawa, Hiroyuki Miyaoka, Nobuto Takahashi as Sanko's gang\n\nHidemi Ito as Sachiko, Ichiro's girlfriend\n\nMasao Fukazawa as Minilla (as \"Little Man Machan\")\n\nYasuhiko Kakuko as Gabara\n\nHaruo Nakajima as Godzilla\n\nMidori Uchiyama as Minilla (voice)\n\nRyder Sound Services English dub\n\nRiley Jackson as Minya / \"Roy\" Senbayashi / Hubert, character on TV drama / middle-aged detective\n\nSusan Davis as Ichiro / Gabara, bully\n\nAppearances\n\nMonsters\n\nGodzilla (SoshingekiGoji)\n\nMinilla\n\nGabara\n\nKamacuras\n\nManeater\n\nAnguirus (stock footage)\n\nGorosaurus (stock footage)\n\nManda (stock footage)\n\nKumonga (stock footage)\n\nGiant Eagle (stock footage)\n\nEbirah (stock footage)\n\nRodan (mentioned)\n\nWeapons, vehicles, and races\n\nRed Bamboo Fighter Jet (stock footage)\n\nUNSC Moon Base (stock footage)\n\nProduction\n\nAll Monsters Attack began shooting on October 11, 1969, and wrapped that November 20, with ADR work performed from November 30 to December 3.\n\nIn a first for the Godzilla series, the film's human and monster scenes were not shot by separate units,[5] thus making Ishiro Honda officially both the director and director of special effects.[3] However, according to SFX first assistant director Teruyoshi Nakano,[3] Honda requested that Nakano shoot the effects on his behalf, due to his inexperience with the medium.[5][6] Nakano also storyboarded all of the sequences.[3] Honda was not completely uninvolved with the effects though, as Nakano called on him to direct Ichiro's interactions with the monsters, which Nakano felt were just an extension of the human drama.[5] Masaaki Hisamatsu was Honda's first assistant director on the drama side,[5] while Koji Hashimoto, who would go on to direct The Return of Godzilla, fulfilled the roles of both second and third assistant director.[7] Atypically, Nakano also worked on the human scenes as an additional AD.[5][8]\n\nAlthough Eiji Tsuburaya is credited on the movie as special effects supervisor, he was not present onset.[7] However, Honda later testified, \"I believe [Tsuburaya] was personally involved with editing and similar matters. The film may have been generally put together, but he definitely looked over the footage and instructed the staff to shorten certain scenes, etc.\"[9]\n\nGallery\n\nMain article: All Monsters Attack/Gallery.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nMain article: All Monsters Attack/Soundtrack.\n\nAlternate titles\n\nGodzilla, Minilla, Gabara: All Monsters Attack (literal Japanese title)\n\nGodzilla, Minilla, Gebara: All Monsters Attack (final script title)\n\nMonster No. 1 Godzilla (怪獣No. (ナンバー)1 (ワン)ゴジラ, Kaijū Nanbā Wan Gojira, Japanese 8mm title)\n\nAttack All Monsters (English title on Japanese VHS)\n\nGodzilla's Revenge (United States)\n\nMinya, Son of Godzilla (alternate U.S. title)[10]\n\nTerror of Godzilla (alternate U.S. title)[11]\n\nGodzilla - Attack All Monsters (Germany)\n\nThe Island of the Monsters (La Isla de los Monstruos; Colombia; Spain; L'Illa dels Monstres; Spain (Catalonia))\n\nMonsterland (Monstrolândia; Brazil)\n\nAttack of Godzilla (Атака Годзиллы; Russia)\n\nTheatrical releases\n\nView all posters for the film here.\n\nJapan - December 20, 1969[1]\n\nUnited States - August 1971[11] ; February 1972[10]\n\nBrazil - January 1971\n\nColombia - May 1971\n\nForeign releases\n\nU.S. release\n\nAll Monsters Attack was acquired by Henry G. Saperstein's United Productions of America and released in American theaters on December 8, 1971 by Maron Films as Godzilla's Revenge. It was released as the first half of a double feature with Island of the Burning Damned, with some theaters screening it alongside Monster Zero and The War of the Gargantuas.[citation needed]\n\nThe film's original U.S. title was Minya, Son of Godzilla, which appeared in BoxOffice magazine's list of upcoming releases from May 3 to May 31, 1971.[11] Publicity materials exist for Minya, Son of Godzilla, including a poster, and a version of the film under that title saw limited screenings in the northeastern U.S. from February to April of 1972.[10] The title was changed to Godzilla's Revenge for general release to avoid confusion with Son of Godzilla, which had already been shown in the U.S.[14] The film was also listed as Terror of Godzilla in BoxOffice from June 7 to July 26, 1971.[11] A variation of this title, The Terror of Godzilla, would later be used as the American theatrical title for Terror of Mechagodzilla, another film acquired by Saperstein.\n\nThe dubbed version of Godzilla's Revenge was recorded at Ryder Sound Services, Inc. in Hollywood under the supervision of Riley Jackson. Minilla, called \"Minya\" in the dub, was voiced by a man, instead of a woman as in the Japanese version. The first localized release of a Godzilla series film in the United States to be totally uncut, the only significant change to the film was the removal of the theme song \"Monster March,\" which played over the opening credits and once again during the film. It was replaced in both instances by a stock instrumental jazz piece by Ervin Jereb titled \"Crime Fiction,\"[16] although the credit for \"Monster March\" remains in the American version.[17] The music and effects track prepared by Toho and provided for the purposes of dubbing contains several minor differences.[18][19] UPA's version of Godzilla's Revenge was subsequently released on VHS and DVD by companies such as Simitar Entertainment and Classic Media. Classic Media made the original Japanese version of the film officially available in North America for the first time in a 2008 DVD release.\n\nUnited Kingdom release\n\nThe United Kingdom television premiere of All Monsters Attack took place on Channel 4 in December 1999, in Japanese with English subtitles.[20] Sony released the Japanese version of the film on Blu-ray in 2019 as part of The Criterion Collection's Godzilla: The Showa-Era Films, 1954–1975 box set. Currently, the BBFC has rated the Japanese version of the film PG for “mild threat, language”.[21]\n\nBox office\n\nIn Japan, the film sold 1,480,000 tickets. This was over 1 million tickets less than the previous Godzilla film, Destroy All Monsters, and it was the first Godzilla film to sell less than 2 million tickets.\n\nReception\n\nAll Monsters Attack has gained very negative reviews from Godzilla fans, with many considering it the weakest of all the Godzilla films.\n\nVideo releases\n\nParadise DVD (year unknown)\n\nRegion: 2\n\nDiscs: 1\n\nAudio: Japanese (2.0 Mono)\n\nSubtitles: Dutch\n\nSpecial features: Trailers for the film and other entries in the Godzilla series\n\nSimitar DVD (1998)\n\nRegion: 1\n\nDiscs: 1\n\nAudio: English (2.0 Mono and 5.1 Surround)\n\nSubtitles: None\n\nSpecial features: Optional 1.33:1 presentation (cropped), Simitar-produced trailers for the company's other kaiju releases, art gallery, trivia game\n\nNotes: Out of print.\n\nClassic Media DVD (2002)\n\nRegion: 1\n\nDiscs: 1\n\nAudio: English (2.0 Mono and 5.1 Surround)\n\nSubtitles: English\n\nSpecial features: Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee trailer\n\nNotes: Cropped 1.33:1 aspect ratio.

The only monsters to appear in newly-shot footage for this film are Godzilla, Minilla, and Gabara, along with a single new shot of Kamacuras walking above the hole Ichiro falls into.\n\nAll Monsters Attack is similar to Gamera Super Monster, as both were produced in the Showa era, rely on a large amount of stock footage for monster scenes, and feature a young boy as the human protagonist.\n\nThis is one of three films in which monsters speak. The other two are Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster, though it was translated by the Shobijin, and Godzilla vs. Gigan, where Godzilla speaks to Anguirus.\n\nAlthough Ichiro says Rodan also lives on Monster Island, he does not make any kind of appearance in the entire film.\n\nAll Monsters Attack is the first onscreen appearance of Monster Island, a location that would be featured as the home of Godzilla and most of the other terrestrial kaiju in subsequent films.\n\nAll Monsters Attack was released at the Winter Toho Champion Festival on December 10 alongside the comedy film Konto 55: Grand Outer Space Adventure and an animated film entitled Star of the Giants: Go Hyuma!. This was the first Champion Festival, which would be continually held in Japan until 1978.\n\nWhen Godzilla arrives to fight Kumonga, stock footage from Son of Godzilla is employed where Kumonga has Minilla wrapped in webbing before getting hit by a boulder thrown by Godzilla. This film hides Minilla from the shot by superimposing a rock over him, but if one pays attention during this scene as Kumonga flips from the rock hitting him, Minilla can be seen wrapped in webbing for a brief second.\n\nIshiro Honda himself considered this as one of his own personal favorites of the Godzilla movies he directed. In an interview he stated that, despite budgetary constraints, \"We decided to take on one of the social problems of that time, the latchkey kid. We set it up that the kid liked monsters, so he pretends and makes it all real [in his dreams].
