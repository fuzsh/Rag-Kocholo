        "text": "(1911–93). Japanese filmmaker Honda Ishiro was perhaps best known for his leading role in Japan’s monster movie craze of the 1950s and ’60s. He was the director of Gojira (1954; Godzilla) and several sequels. He also had a close working relationship with internationally acclaimed director Kurosawa Akira.\n\nHonda was born on May 7, 1911, in Asahi (now part of Tsuruoka), Yamagata prefecture, Japan, to a Buddhist priest and his wife. His family moved to the Tokyo area when Honda was still a child, and that was where he became acquainted with motion pictures. From 1931 to 1933 he attended Nihon University as one of its first film majors. Before graduating, he began working at the Photo Chemical Laboratory, a film-production facility that in 1936 was merged into the Toho Motion Picture Company. Until the early 1950s Honda worked as an assistant director for the studio on more than a dozen films. After he enlisted in the army in 1935, however, his budding film career was periodically interrupted by military duties. He was sent to China and Manchuria during the second Sino-Japanese War, and, while in China in 1945, he was held as a prisoner of war for about six months.\n\nAt Toho Honda had become friends with the young director Kurosawa. Honda later worked as chief assistant director on Kurosawa’s Nora inu (1949; Stray Dog), capturing footage of areas of Tokyo devastated by World War II. He established himself as a director in his own right with Aoi shinju (1951; “The Blue Pearl”). This film, a semidocumentary about pearl divers, was the first full-length Japanese movie to feature underwater sequences. Honda won wide attention, however, with the special-effects-laden film Gojira, which he also cowrote. In this movie a giant lizardlike monster, the mutant result of atomic radiation in the ocean, terrorizes Japan. Although Honda had intended the film to warn audiences about the dangers of nuclear war, it was more commonly seen as an escapist fantasy. Nevertheless, it became immensely popular at the box office.\n\nGojira was the beginning of a wave of low-budget Japanese monster and alien movies. Toho had Honda direct such eventual cult favorites as Sora no daikaiju Radon (1956; Rodan), Uchu daisenso (1959; Battle in Outer Space), and Mosura (1961; Mothra). Although his monster movies derived much of their success from their crudely spectacular nature, his attempt to make sympathetic characters, which was atypical for the genre, also won fans. Beginning with Godzilla, King of the Monsters! (1956), a liberally edited American release of Gojira, Honda’s films attracted a sizable international audience.\n\nThroughout his career, Honda directed more than 40 feature-length productions, most in the science-fiction genre. His last film was Mekagojira no gyakushu (1975; Terror of Mechagodzilla). He then resumed his association with Kurosawa, assisting him on his final five films, including the acclaimed Ran (1985). In addition to movies, Honda directed for television in the 1960s and ’70s. He died on February 28, 1993, in Tokyo."
