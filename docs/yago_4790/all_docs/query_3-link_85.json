        "text": "INCREDIBLE, UNSTOPPABLE TITANS OF TERROR!From 2005 to 2007, I frequently reviewed DVDs of daikaiju movie releases for About Horror.comwhich has changed formats so that the reviews no longer exist online. I've posted a number of those reviews (as well as a few from G-Fan magazine) at The Blog Where Horror Dwells and set up this page with handy links to them. Since many of the movies have been released under different titles at different times, they are catalogued here by the titles of their respective DVD releases. On each blog page, you may click on the DVD cover art to visit the Amazon.com site for that film. New reviews will be added periodically.\n\nGAMERA 1: GUARDIAN OF THE UNIVERSE (1995)\n\nNo More Mr. Nice Gyaos\n\nNot that the Showa-era Gyaos was particularly nice, but the Heisei version, which makes its first appearance in this film, is quite the nasty critter indeed. And there's more than one of them. For the Heisei Gamera series, the big turtle's origin has been completely reworked; no longer merely a prehistoric giant resurrected by a nuclear bomb, Gamera is the genetically engineered product of an advanced but extinct race that lived 10,000 years ago.... (Read more.)\n\nGAMERA 2: THE ADVENT OF LEGION (1996)\n\nAttack of Legion\n\nThe second of the Heisei Gamera series advances another step in bringing a semblance of stark reality to daikaiju films, despite its vivid element of fantasy and more complexand distinctly aliencountenance of Gamera's newest threat. Some comparisons between The Advent of Legion and Godzilla vs. Destroyer, made the previous year, seem inevitable, since both movies feature relatively small insect-like creatures, which swarm the respective title monsters in both films, as well as huge counterparts that engage the title beasts in battle.... (Read more.)\n\nGAMERA 3: THE REVENGE OF IRIS (1999)\n\nGamera, Absolute Guardian of the Incomplete Struggle for the Awakening of the Revenge of Iris\n\nYes, Gamera 3 has a crapload of aliases; The Awakening of Iris; The Incomplete Struggle; The Absolute Guardian of the Universe. Revenge of Iris is the official U.S. release title, so for our purposes, we'll go with that. This film seems to be the fan favorite of the Heisei series, and not without good reason (although I marginally prefer both of the other films in the series, as noted in their respective reviews).... (Read more.)\n\nGAMERA: THE SUPER MONSTER (1980)\n\nGamera Is Super Bad\n\nA big old starshipwhich looks so like an Imperial Star Destroyer from Star Wars that you just know it can't be a friendly thingcomes round the earth and deposits a reasonably hot alien woman named Giruge (Keiko Kudo) in the middle of Japan. She is, in a fact, a minion of the evil space marauder Zanon and has come to eliminate three goody-goody space women named Kilara (Mach Fumiake), Marsha (Yaeko Kojima), and Mitan (Yoko Komatsu)who, for whatever reason, have sent the bad folk into a tizzy.... (Read more.) GAMERA VS. GUIRON (1969)\n\nAttack of the Monsters!The best thing about Gamera vs. Guiron is that it inspired Bill Gudmundsonillustrious Japanese Giants guy, long-time friend, and former roommatesometime long or about the late 1970s, to devise a Guiron butter knife, using... yes... an honest-to-god butter knife, sculpting compound, and a spot of paint. Beyond that, I don't know that there's any real need to review this movie. But I will. Briefly. It's like this: Gamera hits the penultimate nadir of the series (yes, I realize what I just wrote, so pipe down).... (Read more.)\n\nGAMERA VS. VIRAS (1968)\n\nDestroy All Planets!\n\nUnbeknownst to its people, the earth is about to come under attack! As a bizarre cluster of striped spheres hurtles toward the unsuspecting planet, Gamera suddenly comes round, pops the spaceship a good one, and down it goes. Before their demise, the aliens on board report back to their home world that they have an enemy on Earththe big flying turtle. Cut to Japan, where we meet Jim (Carl Craig) and Masao (Tôru Takatsuka), a couple of precocious Boy Scouts.... (Read more.)\n\nGAPPA, THE TRIPHIBIAN MONSTER (1967)\n\nIf At First You Don't Succeed, Triphibian\n\nIn the mid 1960s, Nikkatsu Productions endeavored to capitalize on the giant monster craze, which at the time was at its height, with something of a satire. Gappa takes most of the clichéd elements of the standard giant monster filman exotic South Pacific setting, a greedy exploiter who wants to capitalize on the discovery of the critter, major city destruction, and all-out efforts by the military to stop the monstersand delivers a package that mostly succeeds, both as send-up and traditional daikaiju fare.... (Read more.)\n\nGODZILLA VS. DESTROYAH(1995)\n\nA Major Monster Meltdown!\n\n\"I've always gotten a chuckle out of the name \"Destroyah,\" since it's simply a too-literal translation of the Japanese Katakana characters that represent the English word \"Destroyer.\" Toho tends to trademark its monster names using whatever odd spellings its resident linguists come up with, so \"Destroyah\" actually is Toho's official name for Godzilla's ultimate foe of the Heisei series. But because I find it all a silly thing, you will never see me refer to the monster as anything but \"Destroyer\"which is, after all, what the damn name means....\"\n\n(Read more.)\n\nGODZILLA: TOKYO S.O.S. (2003)\n\nSOS! More MechaGodzilla!\n\nGodzilla: Tokyo SOS is a direct sequel to Godzilla Against MechaGodzilla (2002), as well as the original Mothra (1963), and features the return of Kiryuthe fourth incarnation of Godzillas mechanical counterpart. After a virtual stalemate between Godzilla and Kiryu in the previous film, Mothra appears to join in an epic battle between the monsters, and Tokyo is once again in a big heap of trouble.... (Read more.)\n\nTHE H-MAN (1958)\n\nMolecular Man Terrorizes the World!\n\nAt long last, Toho's 1958 foray into the more horrific side of science-fiction,The H-Man, is now available on DVD, as part of the Columbia Toho Collection package that also featuresBattle in Outer Space andMothra. The story is openly based on the 1954 Lucky Dragon incidentoftentimes referred to as the third nuking of Japanwhen a Japanese fishing boat strayed into waters contaminated by nuclear fallout, resulting in the crew succumbing to radiation sickness.... (Read more.)\n\nINVASION OF THE ASTRO MONSTER (1965)\n\nMonster Zero!\n\nWhen I was a youngster, I caught the double-feature release ofWar of the Gargantuas/Monster Zeroat our local theater, and the pair made a more powerful impression on me than just about any other film experience to that time. Perhaps strangely, given my special fondness for Godzilla, I then preferredWar of the Gargantuasand still do, for that matter. Like all of Toho's fantasy-oriented daikaiju films of the 1960s,Monster Zero is quite silly, and ever since childhood, I've preferred my monsters played straight, as in the original 1954Godzilla....

This is the first and only movie to feature MechaniKong, one of Toho's most popular creations. With a few nods to the original Kong as well as the Rankin-Bass cartoon that spawned it, King Kong Escapes makes for some of the best escapist fun anyone can have at the movies.... (Read more.)\n\nKING KONG VS. GODZILLA (1962)\n\nGodzilla vs. Raggedy Ape\n\nOne of the all-time classic monster duels comes to DVDa beautiful print presented in anamorphic widescreen. Unlike the recent Sony and Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock releases of Toho classics, which include the original Japanese versions, this Universal release offers only the American version produced by John Beck in 1963 (Universal owns the rights, which frees them from having to wrangle with Toho for licensing).... (Read more.)\n\nLATITUDE ZERO (1969)\n\nHorrors From Bloodrock\n\nOver the past few years, Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock has treated tokusatsuphiles to some mighty fine goodies, and its release of Latitude Zero has been among my most anticipated. I first saw this 1969 Toho film in August, 1978, during a memorable visit with Japanese Giants guys, Ed Godziszewski and Bill Gudmundson, and I was immediately taken with its action-packed storyline, colorful cinematography, and superb musical score.... (Read more.)\n\nMATANGO (1962)\n\nAttack of the Mushroom People\n\nBased on the William Hope Hodgson short story \"A Voice in the Night,\" this 1962 Toho horror classic could almost be titled \"Gilligan's Island Goes to Hell.\" Seven shipwrecked survivors find themselves on an island haunted by the ghosts of previous wrecksor so it seems. The castaways soon discover that the crew of one abandoned vessel was conducting experiments with a mutated fungus known as \"Matango\"and may not actually be dead but weirdly transformed.... (Read more.)\n\nMONSTER X STRIKES BACK (2008)\n\nAttack the Summit of Bad Actors!\n\nBack in the early days of my very odd personal development, I was introduced to Greg Shoemaker's Japanese Fantasy Film Journal by way of issue #4late 1970, there or about. In its pages, I found mention of a creature named Guilala, which was unknown to me at the time. Fascinated, I wrote letters to Mr. Shoemaker and other fans of my acquaintance, trying to determine just who or what this Guilala actually was. \"Oh, that's The X From Outer Space,\" came at least one reply.... (Read more.)\n\nMOTHRA (1961)\n\nRavishing the Universe for Love!\n\nMothra has always been one of my least favorite of Toho's giant monsters. It's a bug; depending on its incarnation, either an unremarkable, big honking caterpillar or a terribly unreal-looking giant moth. Yet Mothra has also starred in some of Toho's best Showa-era epics, from the original Mothra to Mothra vs. Godzilla (1963). Later incarnations of the critter, such as those in Godzilla - Mothra - King Ghidorah: All-Out Monster Attack and Godzilla: Tokyo SOS have been outright impressive.... (Read more.)\n\nMOTHRA VS. GODZILLA (1963)\n\nThe Egg Belongs to Mothra...the Mighty Thing!\n\nMothra vs. Godzilla features one of Godzilla's finest screen appearances, with human drama and spectacular monster action coming together to create a near-flawless daikaiju picture. Classic Media presents an excellent DVD release, with both the original Japanese version and the 1964 American International Pictures release (under the original A.I.P. title Godzilla vs. the Thing). This film is one of the few Toho monster fests whose American release version surpasses the original.... (Read more.)\n\nTHE MYSTERIANS (1957)\n\nThe Mysterians Want Our Women!\n\nAlmost fifty years after its original release, The Mysterians (Chikiyu Boeigun) has landed in America on DVD, courtesy of Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock, not only uncut, but in its original widescreen format (2.35:1). And unlike the Sony 50th anniversary releases of numerous Godzilla films, this package contains a number of special features (which are reportedly identical to the Toho [region 2] release).... (Read more.)\n\nRETURN OF GODZILLA (1984)\n\nJapan's Urban Renewal Program\n\nSo far, I've reviewed only daikaiju films that are available domestically on DVD; however, there are a couple in the Godzilla series that, due to complicated licensing situations, have never been released in the U.S. on DVD. Godzilla 1985 (a.k.a. Godzilla and Return of Godzilla) is the most significant of them, in that it launched the Heisei Godzilla series (the films from 1984 to 1995) and was a direct sequel to the original Godzilla (1954), ignoring all the prior films and creating an entirely new continuity..... (Read more.)\n\nRODAN, THE FLYING MONSTER (1956)\n\nThundering Out of Unknown Skies!\n\nMuch likeGodzilla Raids Again (Gigantis, the Fire Monster),the American version ofRodan, the Flying Monster, released by King Brothers in 1957,was substantially re-edited, with obligatory scenes of atomic tests inserted at the beginning and endless narration by Chinese actor Keye Luke added to the soundtrack. Numerous scenes were re-arranged or excised altogether, occasionally to good effect, though mostly to the film's detriment.... (Read more.)\n\nSON OF GODZILLA (1967)\n\nTadzilla?!\n\nA group of Japanese scientists set up a station on Solgel Island to conduct weather control experiments. However, an accident causes their experiment to go out of control, and several gigantic, mutated preying mantises are created. In turn, they unearth a gigantic egg, from which an odd reptilian creature emergesMinira, a.k.a. Minya, the son of Godzilla (once dubbed \"Tadzilla\" by Forry Ackerman in the pages of Famous Monsters of Filmland, and the name stuck).... (Read more.)\n\nSPACE AMOEBA (1970)\n\nYog, Monster From Space\n\nBetter known as Yog, Monster From Space, this Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock DVD release is another welcome addition to its expanding daikaiju library. With a healthy complement of extra features, it features a beautiful, widescreen print and a choice of the original Japanese soundtrack with subtitles or English dubbingthough not the Titra dub that accompanied the 1971 American International release of Yog; this is the inferior international dub created in Hong Kong.... (Read more.)\n\nTERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA (1975)\n\nThose Black Hole Guys Are At It Again\n\nAfter a string of juvenile, budget-strapped Godzilla movies in the early 1970s, the big G's 15th film was touted as a \"return to greatness,\" with veteran director Ishiro Honda at the helm and maestro Akira Ifukube providing the score. Without question, the film has more going for it than several of Godzilla's previous outings, but as for a \"return to greatness,\" well...it just kind of ain't. It is, overall, an entertaining if still highly juvenile monster romp.... (Read more.)\n\nVARAN, THE UNBELIEVABLE (1958)\n\nDaikaiju Baran...The Unbelievable\n\nOne of Toho's most obscure giant monster flicks, the original Japanese version of Varan, The Unbelievable has long been an object of desire for collectors. The Tokyo Shock DVD presents the original black-and-white film, uncut (sans Myron Healy, who starred in the 1962 American version), in anamorphic widescreen, with numerous extras, including an abridged, alternately scored version originally made for Japanese television release.... (Read more.)\n\nWAR OF THE GARGANTUAS (1966)\n\nThe Frankenstein Brothers\n\nOver the years, the terms most often used by reviewers to describe War of the Gargantuas are \"cheesy,\" \"tedious,\" \"insipid,\" \"goofy,\" and so forth, though genre fans often rate the movie relatively high on the daikaiju scale. Me, I put it right at the top of the daikaiju scale, and I'll unabashedly state that it's one of my all-time favorite monster movies. I would be hard-pressed to find a more enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half or so.... (Read more.)\n\nWAR IN SPACE (1977)\n\nMr. Pyrotechnics in Outer Space\n\nSitting down to watch The War in Spacea.k.a. \"Star Wars in Japan\"was actually kind of cool because, even after all these years, I had never made it through the entire picture before. Way back when, I'd started it a time or two, but in my impatient youth, I couldn't get through the first 15 minutes without either yawning or rolling my eyes. The movie is more or less a rehash of every other Toho alien invasion movie ever made, and borrows very heavily from 1963's Atragonwith a dash of Toei's Space Cruiser Yamato for good measure.... (Read more.)\n\nYONGARY, MONSTER FROM THE DEEP (1967)\n\nYongary's Got Seoul\n\nUnlike 1999's Yonggary (a.k.a. Reptilian), which was so awful as to be unwatchable, the original 1967 Yongary definitely falls into the so-awful-it's-fun category. It's a low-budget South Korean daikaiju film wannabe featuring a goofy dancing monster (whose open mouth frequently reveals a metal flame-shooting nozzle); cheap but occasionally compelling special effects; and several nondescript characters, most of whom are never named....
