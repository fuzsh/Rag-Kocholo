        "text": "The Godzilla series from Toho Studios is one of the longest-running cinematic franchises in history. Only the James Bond series has had more consistent theatrical releases since its start (the Godzilla series boasts more live action films at 32, but there have been some rather lengthy breaks). Godzilla himself, a dinosaur mutated by nuclear radiation into a destructive fire-breathing titan, is one of the most recognizable characters in the word, as his Stegosaurus spins give him a distinctive silhouette. I was introduced to the character at the age of ten or eleven when I found a series of children’s books on movie monsters at the library. While checking out some of the movies I became hooked on Godzilla in particular and have been a fan since.\n\nGodzilla has gone through numerous changes in his storied filmography. He started off as a serious and tragic representation of Japan’s experiences with nuclear weapons and wartime devastation, but has also been an antihero, flat-out villain, and cartoonish superhero. Brought to life by director Ishiro Honda and special effects master Ejji Tsuburaya, he helped launch the Kaiju genre. His thirty plus movies run the gamut from legitimate masterpieces to flat-out dreck. This is my attempt to rank all the live-action films (I couldn’t muster the will to rewatch the anime trilogy, which has some interesting ideas but is given over to dull pacing and overlong philosophical waxing).\n\nI sometimes use the term Kaiju. Kaiju refers to the genre of giant monster movies. Many say the terms only applies to Japanese or Asian monster movies. I should also list the eras of Godzilla films with dates so you can understand some of the other references I make.\n\nShowa Era (1954-1975) The Showa Era began with the first Godzilla film and spawned numerous Kaiju and sci-fi films. Its financial and creative peak was the early to mid-sixties. Going into the 70s the Japanese film industry went into a depression as TV took over. The Godzilla series fell into campy fare, just starting to get better before the franchise was put to rest.\n\nHeisei Era (1984-1995): The Heisei Era started with Godzilla’s return in 1984. It took some time for sequels to develop and then fans got one new movie a year. The Heisei series was noted for its attempt at a solid continuity instead of the loose universe of the Showa Era. The movies took on a more serious tone even with the later introduction of fantastical elements like time travel.\n\nMillennium Era (1999-2004): Also known as the Shinsei Era, this period began in response to Tri-Star’s blasphemous take on Godzilla. It went the opposite direction of the Heisei Era by allowing each director to retool the continuity for his own purposes. This resulted in some good new takes, but also confused moviegoers. The series was not as financially profitable as the Heisei series and was given a big finale with Godzilla: Final Wars.\n\nReiwa Era (2016-present): This era began with best picture winner Shin Godzilla. Despite the movie’s box office and critical success, Toho has yet to make any more live-action features, focusing on anime instead.\n\nAmerican: Tri-Star Pictures created the much maligned Godzilla in 1998. Legendary Pictures is currently taking a much more well-received (if still critically mixed) crack at the Big G.\n\nWith so many movies to choose from this was a very difficult task. My opinions will probably change in the future, especially in the middle rankings. Since there are 33 films, I will release the ranking in three parts of 11 films each. Our first entry is actually not in the rankings.\n\nOff the List\n\nGodzilla (1998)\n\nPlot: French nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific mutates an iguana into a massive dinosaur-like beast. For some reason it chooses to cross Central America and go all the way to New York City, where it immediately causes chaos. While the US military inadvertently causes more damage in while trying to destroy the creature, a scientist who specializes in radiation and mutation discovers that it’s pregnant!\n\nMini-Review: Tri-Star Pictures gained the rights to make an American Godzilla movie in the 90s. Fans were excited to see a Hollywood-budgeted Godzilla film with CGI (still very new at the time), and early concepts for the film looked pretty good. Then Roland Emmerich and his producer Dean Devlin, fresh off their smash success with Independence Day, got the gig. The problem is that they did not respect or understand the character. They tried to create a more realistic animal and turned Godzilla from a nigh-indestructible god of natural destruction into a T-Rex rip-off who runs away from the military, doesn’t breathe fire, and gets killed by mere missiles. Fans were pissed, while many non-fans and critics blasted the movie for simply being dumb.\n\nI took this film off the list because technically it’s better than several other Godzilla films, but it’s still the biggest bastardization of the character and concept. Taken as a non-Godzilla film (the spines and roar are still there), it’s actually an enjoyable dumb 90s action flick. The special effects team can’t seem to decide what Zilla’s size is, some of the main characters are weak and unlikeable, and Emmerich fails to really give the asshole characters proper comeuppances (he turned his nemeses Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel, famed movie critics, into an incompetent mayor and his yes man; The real-life critics dunked on him for not actually having their characters suffer a comically horrific death). The legitimate positives are Jean Reno as a French foreign agent and David Arnold’s awesome musical score.\n\nSaturday Morning Junk\n\n#32: All Monsters Attack (1969)\n\nPlot: A young lower-class and somewhat neglected boy, Ichiro, fantasizes about trips to Monster Island to escape his real life where he’s constantly tormented by bullies. In the dream world he befriends Godzilla’s son Minya. Together they watch Godzilla pummel other monsters via stock footage from previous films. Minya has his own bully, a red-haired abomination named Gabara.\n\nMini-Review: Most Godzilla fans list this as the worst movie, which is ironic because director Ishiro Honda (the acclaimed director of the very first film) thought it was a good, meaningful work. With all due respect to Honda he’s wrong. The movie feels like a children’s TV special, almost down to a mere hour in length, padded with stock footage, and centered around a little kid. The dub makes matters worse, with Minya talking in a Barney Rubble voice and Ichiro making goofy monster sounds. Also, the anti-bullying message falls flat. In the real world Ichiro gains the respect of the other children, only to pull a ladder out from under a painter to show how he’s part of the group. On Monster Island Minya learns to stand up to Gabara, then Godzilla steps in and helps him beat the crap out of the villain, delivering the message that you should get your father to dish out a protracted beat down to the kid that’s picking on you. The American title is Godzilla’s Revenge, which makes absolutely no sense unless Godzilla is trying to punish humanity by releasing this film.\n\n#31: Godzilla vs. Megalon (1973)\n\nPlot: Threatened by nuclear testing, the underwater kingdom of Seatopia unleashes the deity Megalon, a beetle with drill arms, on the surface world. To help guide him they break into the home of inventor Goro and steal his robot Jet Jaguar. Eventually Jet Jaguar breaks free guide duties and gets Godzilla to come help while aliens send Gigan to help Megalon. This leads to a ludicrous, yet admittedly entertaining tag team match.\n\nMini-Review: Godzilla vs. Megalon epitomizes the decayed state of the Godzilla franchise in the early 70s. Trying to compete with television’s superhero vs. monster series (of which Ultraman is the most famous), Toho attempted to copy the formula with Jet Jaguar. The problem is that kids could already get such fare for free on the tube. The movie itself is on a shoestring budget, with excessive stock footage for the monster scenes and a miniscule cast of humans. The music is also whack outside of Jet Jaguar’s catchy theme. While I rank this near last, I do admit that it’s a so-bad-it’s-good affair. Mystery Science Theater 3000 even had an episode with it!\n\nI should mention that for some reason this movie got a big promotion in the United States. It had an epic movie poster showing the monsters square off on the World Trade Center (this never happens in the movie). It then got a television special promoted by skits featuring John Belushi in a Godzilla suit. Thanks to this one brief cultural moment, Godzilla was cemented in American minds as a stupid, goofy superhero instead of the serious beast from the early films. This led to years of ridicule for Godzilla and his fans.\n\n#30: Godzilla vs. Gigan (1972)\n\nPlot: Cartoonist Gengo gets a gig at World Children’s Land, a theme park that advocates for peace and sports a Godzilla-shaped tower that doubles as the command center. Gengo and his friends, including a Japanese hippie, discover that the park’s staff are in fact cockroach aliens from M Space Hunter Nebula. The Nebulans unleash the three-headed King Ghidorah and cyborg Gigan on Japan. Godzilla and his ally Anguirus swim over to fight them in a tag team match while the humans look for a way to disable Godzilla Tower.\n\nMini-Review: This was the precursor to Godzilla vs. Megalon and was little better. This was where the alien invasion plot in the series began to be overused and tired. The villains themselves are shockingly ineffectual, with the heroes coming and going from their “impenetrable” base at will. There’s even a scene where Gengo’s girlfriend sends armed men running with a couple karate chops. The monster scenes have a big dose of stock footage, but unlike Megalon there’s still a good amount of original destruction scenes featuring neat pyrotechnics. The battle is also fun even with King Ghidorah’s suit showing visible signs of decay. It should be noted that the musical score was just reused tapes of longtime franchise composer Akira Ifukube, which explains a couple odd music-to-visual moments and the lack of a theme for Gigan.\n\nA Way to Pass a Couple Hours\n\n#29: Godzilla Raids Again (1955)\n\nPlot: A year after the first Godzilla’s death, another Godzilla emerges, locked in a feud with the Ankylosaur-like Anguirus. This disrupts the livelihoods of a fishing company and also sets Osaka on fire. Pilots for the fishing company eventually join former mates from Japan’s WWII air force to stop this latest monster rampage.\n\nMini-Review: Godzilla Raids Again is technically not horrible, but it commits the sin of being the most boring Godzilla film. Back in the day sequels to successful movies were often hastily put together and released for fear that audiences would forget about the first film and not see the continuation. Thus this Kaiju outing is a big step down from its historic predecessor, the first Godzilla movie. The script isn’t as deep and meaningful, though the monsters do represent how the Cold War could affect nations in between the main powers. Most of the A-team from the first movie’s crew, from director Ishiro Honda to composer Akira Ifukube, didn’t return. The introduction of another monster for Godzilla to fight was a natural and momentous development but (spoiler) Anguirus gets killed halfway through the movie and then we have to get through a bunch of everyday drama for a glacial-paced climax (you’ll notice the pun if you’ve seen the movie). This is one Godzilla movie I never feel a strong urge to go back to. It’s not good or entertaining enough.\n\n#28: Destroy All Monsters (1968)\n\nPlot: In the future of 1999, when man can easily rocket back and forth from the moon and has a one-world government, all of earth’s monsters are contained on Monster Island. Then they are released and put under mind control by a feminine race of aliens called the Kilaaks. The humans look for a way to free the monsters’ minds and repel the invasion.\n\nMini-Review: Some Godzilla fans might be shocked to see this here. Destroy All Monsters was an anniversary film featuring almost all of Toho’s Kaiju. It was even originally meant to be the end of the Godzilla series. As a kid I was stoked to see this because of the large monster cast. I was deeply disappointed. Yes, there are tons of monsters, but most are relegated to cameos. The final battle where they all team up against King Ghidorah is surprisingly uncomfortable to watch because the big villain gets ganged up on so badly. The filmmakers also seemed too interested in showing humans get into second-rate gunfights, rocket flights, and alien encounters. These scenes are mostly dull and take too long. Overall Destroy All Monsters winds up being incredibly underwhelming because the premise is so awesome. I do want to add that I found the set-up of future earth disturbing. Everyone seems to answer to a one world government which employs a massive and secretive police force. It also imprisoned Mothra, a benevolent character, alongside the others monsters, implying that they stole her from her worshippers on Infant Island.\n\n#27: Godzilla: Final Wars (2004)\n\nPlot: In the future a global inter-government force uses high tech and newly evolved mutant soldiers to battle a wide array of monsters. Suddenly all the monsters attack at the same time before being teleported away by the Xiliens, aliens who claim to be allies and want to stop a traveling planet, Gorath, from crashing into the earth. It turns out they don’t have such noble intentions and are in fact controlling the monsters. They launch an invasion that wrecks the planet. The remnants of the Earth Defense Force, led by the hulking Captain Gordon (played by mixed marital artist and professional wrestler Don Frye), try to free the weapon they had imprisoned years earlier: Godzilla!\n\nMini-Review: If the plot sounds similar to Destroy All Monsters that’s because this was something of a remake for Godzilla’s 50th birthday. It was the biggest-budgeted Japanese Godzilla movie yet and ran for a full two hours instead of the 90-100 minute mark. Toho strangely chose young director Ryuhei Kitamura, known for his frenetic action movies, to helm this important entry and the results are not up to par. As with Destroy All Monsters most of the Kaiju appear for glorified cameos, if that. Pretty much every monster except Godzilla and new antagonist Monster X come off as easily disposable chumps. This is unfortunate because a lot of the redesigns, particularly Gigan’s, are pretty cool. The main problem is that Kitamura was more interested in using his budget to ape his favorite American films, to the point that 90% of the final battle is humans vs. aliens in Matrix style scenes. The main protagonist even looks like Keanu Reeves! I do have to confess, however, that this movie is incredibly fun to watch. While longer than Destroy All Monsters, it is much more entertaining.\n\n#26: Ebirah, Horror of the Deep (1966)\n\nPlot: After Ryota’s brother goes missing at sea, he and a couple of his friends steal a boat to look for him. They end up on the island guarded by the giant lobster Ebirah. The island itself is run by the Red Bamboo, a terrorist organization that employs slave labor from Mothra’s Infant Island. Dodging patrols with an escaped slave woman and a fugitive bank robber, the heroes find Godzilla and plan to awaken him so he’ll destroy the Red Bamboo and get rid of Ebirah.\n\nMini-Review: Better known as Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster, this is a fun if unremarkable entry in the series. It scales back the scope of the Godzilla franchise so that the monsters are hanging out on a tropical island instead of heavily populated Japan. This was actually supposed to be a King Kong movie in conjunction with a Rankin/Bass cartoon series. Rankin/Bass instead opted for King Kong Escapes the following year and Toho inserted Godzilla into Kong’s place. This explains some odd bits like Godzilla taking a fancy to Kumi Mizuno’s island beauty. Godzilla’s monster opponents are also underwhelming, though his battle with Ebirah has some comically fun moments. Overall this is a fun movie to watch but not one that holds anything special.\n\n#25: Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla (1994)\n\nPlot: Godzilla cells taken to space on Biollante and Mothra in previous films are radiated in a black hole and create a Godzilla clone (yeah, it’s kind of ridiculous). The new monster, with crystals emanating from his back and shoulders, comes to earth to terraform the planet to his liking. As for human drama, recurring psychic character Miki Saegusa feels conflicted over participating in a project that aims to control Godzilla with telepathy. There’s also Major Yuki, a G-Force soldier who’s obsessed with avenging his best friend’s death by killing Godzilla.\n\nMini-Review: Many consider this to the nadir of the Heisei era. I concur, though the fact that I’ve only seen the English dub might contribute to my opinion. Director Kensho Yamashita tried to turn Miki, a popular side character, into the main character. This isn’t necessarily a bad choice, but she’s put into a love angle and says some of the dumbest crap. I’ve heard that the English dub is responsible for the latter issue, but I can’t verify this. The special effects are also uneven, with a positive being a more flexible Godzilla suit and a negative an obviously fake asteroid field battle. Some of the subplots tend to get dropped or come out of nowhere, most notably one involving the Yakuza. The final battle also starts to drag because the special effects men put too much emphasis on beam battles (a recurring problem in the Heisei series). That being said Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla is not as horrifically bad as some make it out to be. It just needs to juggle its story elements better or get a tighter script.\n\nSolid Kaiju Fare part 1\n\n#24: Godzilla vs. Megaguirus (2000)\n\nPlot: In this continuity the original 1954 Godzilla did not die but returns several times. Japan shuts down plasma and nuclear power as these are proven to attract the monster. Soldier Kiriko seeks revenge on Godzilla after he caused the death of her commanding officer. She works with the Dimension Tide Project, which plans to suck Godzilla away with an artificial black hole. The weapons test accidentally brings over Meganula, giant prehistoric dragonflies. The bugs start interfering with Dimension Tide.\n\nMini-Review: This used to be one of my favorite Godzilla movies. I was surprised to see that many fans ranked it low and now as an older viewer I understand why. Godzilla vs. Megaguirus has many interesting concepts and that’s the problem. We have giant prehistoric insects, a black hole machine, a subplot about energy, and a revenge story. Director Masaaki Tezuka (this was his first of three Godzilla films), didn’t know how to gel all the elements together. The black hole and Meganula plots, for example, don’t have anything to do with each other except that one enables the other to happen. It’s like the Dimension Tide plot goes on hold while we’re waiting for Godzilla to finish his Kaiju match. Speaking of Dimension Tide, the idea of artificial black holes is actually a very unethical and horrifying concept that should have provoked more reaction among the characters. A final complaint is that there was no reason to make this Godzilla the same as the 1954 original. Nothing interesting is done with it so they might as well have made this a direct sequel to Godzilla 2000. That being said the action in this movie is good, with the final match being a highlight. This was also the first Godzilla outing for Michiru Oshima, my favorite Godzilla composer. Her music is probably the reason I gravitated so much to this entry in my teens. Overall this is an enjoyable if spotty entry.\n\n#23: Godzilla vs. MechaGodzilla II (1993)\n\nPlot: Using the remains of Mecha-King Ghidorah, the newly established G-Force creates a mechanical version of Godzilla. Meanwhile Japanese scientists discover an egg as well as giant pterosaur Rodan. The egg is brought to Japan, where it hatches to reveal a baby from the same species as Godzilla. Godzilla and Rodan fight for custody of Baby while MechaGodzilla tries to stop their rampages.\n\nMini-Review: This movie holds the record for most Godzilla screentime. Despite all the complaints of moviegoers of how the monsters need to be on screen more, I actually find this film a little dull at times and partly because of this reason. The problem is that the Heisei era was really into beam battles, because apparently they were more serious than the professional wrestling of the Showa era (The material for MechaGodzilla’s costume was fragile, so they were extra careful about having it knocked around). The movie has a lot of interesting elements and themes of nature and technology, but the final battle turns into a slog until its impactful ending. I do have to say that Baby is a much better infant Godzilla than the Showa era’s Minya and the recasting of MechaGodzilla as a government mech rather than alien invader is a smart choice that also allows the humans to directly challenge the Big G.\n\nTo be continued with #22-12"
