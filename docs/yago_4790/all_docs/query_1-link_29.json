Godzilla (aka Gojira) is the beginning of the longest running film series in history, the grandfather Godzilla if you will, and we’re darn happy to be showing the new restoration. It all begins with nuclear testing in the Pacific spawning a 150 foot tall monster that goes on a destructive rampage. Will man be able to destroy its own creation before it destroys us all?"
