        "text": "GODZILLA x KONG: THE NEW EMPIRE (2024)\n\nSequel to Godzilla vs Kong opens a few years after Godzilla and Kong’s battle where the two earned each other’s respect and parted ways peacefully…for the time being. Kong now lives in the Hollow Earth and constantly searches for others like him, while being watched by Monarch and Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall). Kong unwittingly opens a chasm leading into a sealed-off section of the underground world, freeing the sinister Skar King and his simian slaves and soldiers. At the same time Godzilla begins to attack nuclear facilities and other titans, absorbing massive amounts of energy. It’s discovered that Jia’s (Kaylee Hottle) people the Iwi also live in that hidden part of the Hollow Earth and have sent a signal out alerting Godzilla to the coming threat. Now the only hope to defeat Skar King and his massive ice titan Shimo is if Kong and Godzilla can somehow coexist and fight together…unless they destroy each other first.\n\nSequel to Godzilla vs. Kong is again directed by Adam Wingard (The Guest, You’re Next) from a script by Terry Rossio, Simon Barrett and Jeremy Slater. It is a blast of colossal monster fun, that puts the monsters first and the people in supporting roles. It’s more on the level of some of the lighter Japanese flicks from the 60s and 70s like Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster and King Kong Escapes so anyone expecting the emotional resonance of the recent Godzilla Minus One will be sadly disappointed. If you are fine with some lighthearted comic book style adventure then this is a really fun time at the movies with some dazzling visual sequences and some rip-roaring monster battles, including the climactic showdown that rages from Hollow Earth to Rio de Janeiro, to Godzilla and Kong going at it once again among the pyramids of Egypt. The FX are top notch, the flick is loaded with critters familiar and new, and the human character sequences may be weak but do their job. The monsters are the stars, and the humans really only exist to give the exposition we can’t get from our titanic main characters. It’s a true popcorn movie and longtime Godzilla fans in particular should love the references and tone that harkens back to classic Toho. Wingard moves things along quickly, makes it colorful and action-packed and gives the film a sense of fun without making fun of his colossal subjects.\n\n“Did we just become best friends?”\n\nThe director once again has assembled a good cast that may not have a lot to do but make their parts fun. Rebecca Hall is front and center returning as strong-willed Dr. Ilene Andrews. She’s a little tougher yet still capable of being a wide-eyed kid when seeing the new sights in Hollow Earth. She is also trying hard to be mom towards Jia who shares Kong’s loneliness of being the last of her kind…or so she thinks. As Jia, Kaylee Hottle has a larger and more important role here and handles it very well. She finds not only her people but a heritage linking her to another classic Toho creature that works really well and establishes a bond that could be important moving forward. Brian Tyree Henry is again fun as podcaster Bernie. Now he gets to travel to uncharted territory in the Hollow Earth. New to the team is Dan Stevens as eccentric titan dentist Trapper. He is charming and a lot of fun as he accompanies Andrews and Jia in following Kong into this new realm. Kong is once again presented as a noble hero now finally finding his own kind who are enslaved by the tyrannical Skar King. Kong bravely goes topside to try to convince Godzilla to fight along with him despite knowing he’s still not the King of the Monsters’ favorite kaiju. Godzilla is not a bad guy at all here but is portrayed as ruthless when motivated and not exactly concerned with mankind when he is maintaining monster order. Skar King and Shimo are quite formidable but one wishes they were introduced a little sooner to help solidify their menace. Finally, there is simian child Suko who is a fun and brave little guy that bonds with Kong. There is also a wonderful appearance by another familiar face from Toho, but you’ll have to see the film to find out!\n\nOverall, those expecting a monster flick with the story depth of the recent Godzilla Minus One will be disappointed. Those going in expecting a monster throwdown of epic portions, will be very entertained. Once again, Wingard and company deliver big time. The action is fast and furious with human characters definitely taking a back seat to the monsters and the massive brawls when titans meet. The visuals, especially in Hollow Earth, are stunning and the critter battles are as brutal and intense as last time. Adam Wingard delivers another wonderfully entertaining, popcorn flick that might be the most fun entry in the Legendary Monsterverse so far and simply a blast of a good time at the movies.\n\n-MonsterZero NJ\n\nRated 3 and 1/2 (out of 4) Godzillas\n\n**************************************************\n\nGODZILLA MINUS ONE (2023)\n\nGodzilla Minus One is the 33rd Toho Godzilla film in this 70-year-old franchise and like 2016’s Shin Godzilla is a standalone feature that reboots Godzilla yet again, this time taking his origin back to his original post WWII roots.\n\nThe film opens in 1945 as the war in the Pacific is coming to an end. Kamikaze pilot Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) does not want to die and lands on a remote repair base on Odo Island claiming his plane is suffering a malfunction. That night, amid accusations of cowardice, a dinosaur-like creature that local legends refer to as Godzilla, attacks the base. Shikishima freezes behind his plane’s guns and all but one of the technicians there are killed. Kōichi returns home to a war desolated Tokyo with shame, dishonor and guilt for his failure to complete his mission and letting men die. The film then picks up two years later where Kōichi has befriended a young woman Noriko (Minami Hamabe) and an orphaned child Akiko (Sae Nagatani) and formed a family. There is little time to recover from the war, however, as the creature Godzilla, now enlarged and enraged by American atomic bomb tests, lays siege to a defenseless Japan. Kōichi now sees a way to regain his honor and end his inner torment as he vows to somehow destroy this unstoppable monster.\n\nGodzilla’s latest romp through Tokyo is written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki who also produced the very impressive visual effects. Yamazaki returns Godzilla to his nuclear roots as a product of the Pacific bomb tests from the 40s and 50s. His initial origin is never explained beyond a creature of local folklore that has now become irradiated, mutated and enraged by the nuclear weapons testing. He turns his nuclear fueled anger on an already desolate post war Japan. The scenes of Godzilla laying siege to Tokyo are given a power and sense of awe that we haven’t seen in this series since 1954. This is a truly frightening and rage-filled beast that can heal any damage that what little weaponry the Japanese have left can cause. For the first time advanced SPFX show Godzilla healing his battle damage like Wolverine in an X-Men movie. His atomic breath is also given renewed power as he now causes mini atomic explosions with every blast. It’s used minimally but to very impressive effect. Godzilla hasn’t been a powerhouse threat like this in a long time and the scenes he appears in are awe-inspiring. The human drama gives the film some strong emotional resonance and the fact that the U.S. refuses to help, fearing any military intervention will trigger a Soviet response, adds a helplessness to the situation. Not to be ignored is some impressive cinematography by Kōzō Shibasaki and a pulse-pounding score by Naoki Satō that uses some of Akira Ifukube’s original Godzilla theme.\n\nIt’s not perfect. The human story elements can get melodramatic, especially Shikishima’s inner war with his cowardice and his failure to save the men on Odo Island. This added to him trying to support and fight for his new adopted family amidst Godzilla’s attack can get a little heavy-handed. The film lays this on a little thick but thankfully not enough to spill into camp. Also, as governments abandon them, a group of citizens and former military men band together to formulate a plan to destroy Godzilla and it is a bit far-fetched but, these folks are desperate, so we go along with it. Besides, it is a film about a giant mutant dinosaur after all. Regardless, any flaws melt away once Godzilla is on screen and said farfetched plan is fun to watch in spite of itself in the action-packed climax.\n\nThe cast is good. Ryunosuke Kamiki is impressive as failed Kamikaze pilot Kōichi Shikishima. He is at war with himself over his perceived failures and cowardice and the actor really sells this inner turmoil. He also portrays well his overcoming of his fears and finding his inner hero as he cares for his foster family and joins the fight against Godzilla. A solid lead. Minami Hamabe is good as Noriko a woman who will do what it takes to survive yet one who has a heart and cares about Shikishima and little Akiko. She’s a strong woman and it’s a shame she’s not more involved in the exciting last act. Munetaka Aoki is also solid as the other survivor of Odo Island, Sōsaku Tachibana, who overcomes his hatred of Shikishima to join forces, and Hidetaka Yoshioka is good as weapons engineer Kenji Noda, who devises the plan that is their only hope against Godzilla. As for Godzilla, his portrayal is one of pure rage and powerful, destructive anger. One of his best performances.\n\nOverall, this may be one of the most intense and powerful portrayals of Godzilla since the 1954 original. He’s a beast of incredible rage and destruction and one can feel the hopelessness that the human characters feel as he destroys everything and everyone in sight. As for the human drama, it can cross over into melodrama at times but is still successful at giving the film a strong emotional core and depth. The SPFX portraying Godzilla and his destructive activities are breathtaking and are a sight that should be seen on the biggest screen possible. The Legendary Monsterverse films have been fun to various degrees, but Toho’s Godzilla is back and badder than ever.\n\n-MonsterZero NJ\n\nRated 3 and 1/2 (out of 4) Godzillas\n\n**************************************************\n\nKING KONG vs. GODZILLA (1962)\n\nWith Legendary’s rematch finally on the horizon for release, maybe it’s time to look back at Godzilla and Kong’s first cinematic slugfest. This review is of the original Japanese language version.\n\nThe story finds Godzilla breaking out of his icy prison after seven years and, once more, heading for Japan, after he makes a quick snack of a nuclear submarine. Meanwhile, pharmaceutical company CEO Tako (Ichirō Arishima) is looking for something big to boost the ratings of the TV shows his company sponsors. Rumors of a large creature on a Pacific island may be just what he needs. The creature is a massive ape known as Kong and Tako plans to bring the beast to Japan. Obviously, Godzilla and an escaped Kong arrive on Japanese shores at the same time and are destined to cross paths and lock horns.\n\nFlick is directed by Ishirō Honda from a script by Shinichi Sekizawa. The film is a lot lighter than the first two Godzilla films and goes for more comical situations than dramatic intensity…though it has that, too. Godzilla is clearly the bad guy here with Japanese authorities even provoking a second fight between the titans, after Godzilla’s heat ray cause Kong to retreat the first time around. The film is colorful, as were most of the 60s era Godzilla flicks and the FX from the legendary Eiji Tsuburaya range from some really elaborate model work to the sadly inadequate Kong costume, which looks like a Halloween ape suit. The arms laughably and drastically change length from shot to shot. Kong is the underdog here, with Godzilla portrayed as bigger and more powerful. Kong is given an added caveat of being able to absorb power from electricity to even up the odds. The battles are fun, though keeping in consistency with the rest of the flick, carry a lighter, more humorous tone. There is a lot of damage caused by both Kong and Godzilla when they are apart and utter destruction when they are in combat. The human drama is amusing enough to occupy us whenever our colossal critters are not on screen, which isn’t often and Kong gets to show he still has a way with the ladies. Legendary Toho composer Akira Ifukube provides another classic score. It’s a fun movie, though slightly disappointing for those expecting the more serious tone of both Godzilla and Kong’s original movies.\n\nThe cast are all good. Ichirō Arishima was known in his native land as the “Japanese Chaplin” and one can see why, as the actor delivers a fun performance of both exaggerated line delivery and physical comedy. Toho veteran Tadao Takashima and Yū Fujiki share hero duties as Osamu Sakurai and Kinsaburo Furueshare, the two PR men sent to retrieve Kong and then get involved with the carnage between the big ape and his opponent. Joining the two is Bond girl Mie Hama as Osamu’s sister Fumiko and Toho veteran Kenji Sahara as Kazuo Fujita, her boyfriend. Haruo Nakajima once again does a great job in the Godzilla suit, as does Shoichi Hirose give Kong a lot of character despite the sub-par gorilla suit. Ironically Nakajima would get to play Kong, too, in Toho’s only other Kong adventure, King Kong Escapes.\n\nDespite being a sillier entry in Godzilla’s early filmography, Kong was said to be popular in Japan, so the film pairing of the two monsters was a big hit and remains one of the top grossing Toho Godzilla flicks. It’s a lot of fun and fast moving at 97 minutes long. The FX are standard for Toho sci-fi flicks of this era, save for the awful Kong costume, and there is a lot of destruction for the buck. For almost 60 years, a rumor has persisted that there are two versions of the film, with Godzilla winning in the Japanese version and Kong winning in the U.S. version. Despite Universal’s U.S. version being heavily edited, with some new footage of Western actors added in, the ending remains the same with both monsters tumbling into the sea. Kong surfaces, swimming off and Godzilla remains underwater, his fate uncertain until the next flick. Godzilla would re-emerge in 1964 for Mothra vs. Godzilla and Kong would fight his mechanical double for Toho in 1967’s King Kong Escapes also starring Mie Hama.\n\n-MonsterZero NJ\n\n3 rampaging Godzillas.\n\nGODZILLA (GOJIRA) (1954)\n\nThis is a review of the uncut Japanese version without the U.S. release inserts with Raymond Burr…\n\nGodzilla is a film classic and sits along with the original King Kong as one of the greatest giant monster flicks of all time and introduced us to one of the most famous characters and names in pop culture history. Whether you like these movies or not, most of the civilized world has, at least, heard of Godzilla. Most people associate him with the goofy monster fests that he appeared in later in his career, but more serious fans know that the original film uses the creature as a metaphor for the atomic bomb and the horror and death it caused when unleashed on Japan during WWII and was devoid of the campy-ness and goofy humor later entries in the series would have.\n\nThe story finds a series of ship disappearances in an area off the Japanese coast that is causing much mystery and concern. What few survivors are found report of the sea ‘exploding’ and catching fire. The people of the remote fishing village of Odo Island say the cause is a gigantic creature of legend known as “Godzilla”. Paleontologist Dr. Yamane (Takashi Shimura) is dispatched to the island and makes the horrifying discovery that not only does this legendary creature exist, but it is highly radioactive. Yamane theorizes that this species of prehistoric creature has been living peacefully in deep sea caverns in the Pacific and that it has been irradiated and it’s habitat destroyed by H-Bomb testing. Now this creature is loosed upon the world and sees Japan as it’s new hunting ground. Efforts to destroy the creature at sea prove futile and soon it wades ashore and lays waste to the great city of Tokyo causing untold damage and death in it’s radioactive wake. But there is hope. A Dr. Serizawa (Akihiko Hirata) has created a weapon that destroys oxygen and it could be the key to ending both the destruction and Godzilla’s reign of terror, but only if he agrees to use it, something he is reluctant to do.\n\nUnder the skilled direction of the legendary Ishirō Honda from his script with Takeo Murata…from a story by Shigeru Kayama…Godzilla is a dead serious and sometimes very grim allegory of the horrors of the atomic bomb, horrors the people of Japan know all too well. The film starts off with Honda slowly building the mystery and tension and doesn’t give us our first quick glimpse of Godzilla till almost a half hour in and once we know what we’re in for, it is almost an hour before Godzilla launches his devastating attack on Tokyo which, unlike future installments, is not a fun city stomping romp, but an act of destruction where we are treated to horrifying images of death and those trapped in the creatures path or, victims of it’s radioactive fallout. It is a somber and heart wrenching sequence and meant to illustrate what Japan went through when the U.S. used the atomic bomb in Nagasaki and Hiroshima. And Honda pulls no punches and shows us from a perspective of the embattled citizens what the horrors of such an event have on the innocent. His Godzilla here is no cute superhero or even anti-hero, he is a destructive force and one that causes horrific carnage, a true symbol of man’s irresponsible meddling with destructive power and the effect it has on those it’s used on. The black and white cinematography by Masao Tamai creates stark and powerful imagery especially when the camera movies through the destruction caused by the behemoth and it really gives the film such rich atmosphere to accent Honda’s taunt direction. The SPFX rendering Godzilla and his wrath are well executed by legendary FX master Eiji Tsuburaya and while they may be primitive by today’s CGI standards, they are very effective for the time in presenting the beast’s power and the grim results of his attacks. The film would also mark suit-mation actor Haruo Nakajima’s first portrayal of Godzilla, a role he would play till the last Showa (original series) Godzilla film Terror Of Mechagodzilla in 1975. And wrapping it all together is Akira Ifukube’s brilliant and moody score which would become Godzilla’s trademark theme till this day.\n\nHonda had a good cast and when watched in the original Japanese with subtitles, without the sub-standard dubbing, we get some very good performances from actors who treat the material with the seriousness and respect it deserved. Shimura’s Yamane is a humble man of science who sees the lesson to be learned in Godzilla and despite his destructiveness, thinks he should be studied not destroyed. Momoko Kochi gives a strong emotion-filled performance as Yamane’s daughter, Emiko who is engaged to Serizawa, but falls in love with shipping company owner Ogata (Akira Takarada) and gets caught between those two men. Akihiko Hirata gives a simmering portrayal of Dr. Serizawa, a reclusive but brilliant scientist who has created a weapon with the destructive potential of the H-Bomb and knowing that, refuses to use it even to save his country. And as the man who steals Emiko’s heart, Akira Takarada is effective as Ogata, a working man who rises to hero status when his loved ones and country are in danger. Having lost many ships to Godzilla’s attacks, Ogata tries to convince Dr. Serizawa to change his mind and save his country and people. And as the title creature, Nakajima gives the beast a serpentine menace and an aura of great power. Had his work inside the suit not been effective, the film would not have worked and we wouldn’t still be seeing Godzilla films decades later. A solid cast who give strong performances and are sadly not given the credit they deserve due to being judged by ineffective dubbing which does not honor their work.\n\nNot only is this one of the greatest monster films of all time, it is a great film period. The horrors of war and the devastation of the atomic bomb metaphorically portrayed by the attack of a creature created by meddling with nature and powers best left alone. The film is entertaining, yet also humbling as it never shies away from the result of such overpowering destructive force personified by one of film’s most iconic and famous characters. If he didn’t directly cause death and destruction, his radioactivity did. Something that would be lost in future films. Godzilla would slowly become a monster bashing superhero and sometimes, depending on the era and film, an anti-hero who we still cheer, despite him not being a good guy. But in his first movie, Godzilla was a horror and a devastating one at that and his first feature was a grim story of the negative aspects of science when it’s applications are used to destroy not improve life. And it is a message that is still completely resonant today. A true classic unfairly judged by the sillier films that came later on.\n\nMONSTERZERO N.J. TRIVIA: Godzilla, or more appropriately, Gojira’s name comes from a combination of the Japanese words ‘gorira’ meaning gorilla and ‘kujira’ meaning whale. There are tales that it was a nickname taken from a large and strong Toho Studios employee, but it has never been confirmed and may only be an urban legend. While the Godzilla in future films is acknowledged to be another irradiated animal of the same species, I have an interesting theory…SPOILERS…When Dr. Serizawa demonstrates the oxygen destroyer to Emiko on a fish tank, the fish all dissolve. But when Serizawa is convinced to use the weapon on Godzilla by Emiko and Ogata later on, Honda pans over to a fish tank now filled with fish. Were they replaced?…or was he trying to tell us the effects of Serizawa’s weapon were only temporarily and Godzilla would return? Whatever the answer, Godzilla is now in his 60th year and about to return in a new big budget production. Whether this was the intention or not…Godzilla is a legendary film icon that, like in his films, continues to live on and become known to each new generation.\n\nMONSTERZERO N.J. PERSONAL TRIVIA: I had the wonderful opportunity in 1994 to meet Godzilla himself, Haruo Nakajima and my signed 40th anniversary edition laserdisc box set of the original 1954 Gojira is one of my most treasured possessions.\n\n4 Godzillas."
