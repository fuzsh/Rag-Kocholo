        "text": "Starting off my series re-watch of the entire Godzilla franchise, we find ourselves at the beginning with Gojira. This movie is so much of a cinematic classic, there isn’t much that I can say that hasn’t already been said before. This movie is almost required watching for any film buffs.\n\nI will be referring to the movie as Gojira throughout this review for several reasons. The first is so that I can better differentiate between Godzilla as a character and the movie itself. Secondly, because I watched the original 1954 classic uncut version of the film, in Japanese with English subtitles. This is important because there is an English version of this film called Godzilla: King of the Monsters that released in 1956. Aside from having English dubbing, there are a few jarring differences between the two films. The first and most obvious is that the American version has actor Raymond Burr superimposed into many of the shots. The character ‘Steve Martin’ was created in order to cater to American audiences, and entirely new shots with him were added to the film. The American version of the film also cut substantial chunks of the original movie in order to fit these new scenes in. Unfortunately, some of the original tone was completely lost. In the Japanese original, the tone is more about the disaster of nuclear testing… while the English version talks more about the sheer power of the nuclear bombs. I’ll talk more about that in a bit.\n\nThe film begins with ToHo’s logo on a black backdrop, and we hear loud pounding that imitates footsteps. As the logo pans up, we see the Gojira title card and hear Godzilla’s iconic roar. The film then opens to a scene of a Japanese fishing boat minding its own business out at sea. The crew witnesses a bright white flash coming from the ocean, and soon after that the ship is run underwater by an unseen force (that we assume is Godzilla), off the shore of Odo Island. Most of the beginning of film after that is spent introducing our main characters Hideto Ogata, Emiko Yamane, Dr. Daisuke Serizawa & Dr. Kyohei Yamane. Odo Island is reporting that their fishing catches have dropped to zero. Then, one night during an awful tropical storm, the island is visited by Godzilla who destroys several homes and killing multiple people. Dr. Yamane comes to Odo Island to investigate some of the strange reports, and it is there that they notice what they believe to be giant foot prints in the ground, and they are emitting some levels of radiation. They also discover an ancient organism called a trilobite; which sets up Godzilla’s prehistoric origin.\n\nShortly after that, the village bell rings and we get out first official look at Godzilla, who is seen looking over the mountainside. He retreats back to ocean after that. Dr. Yamane returns to mainland Japan where he reports his findings, suggesting that Godzilla is a 50meter tall prehistoric monster that was revived and mutated by nuclear testing. The government then debates if they should tell its people. Around this time, reports start coming in that now 17 boats have been lost at sea; all experiencing the same fiery fate.\n\nWe’re introduced to a bit of a love triangle between Ogata, Emiko and Dr. Serizawa. Emiko is the daughter of Dr. Yamane, and Dr. Serizawa is a younger college of his. As such, Dr. Yamane is pressuring an arranged marriage between Emiko and Serizawa. However, it is revealed that Emiko is having an affair relationship with Ogata. The dynamic relationship between all of the characters work perfectly. They all work together at various points. About midway through the film, Godzilla makes his first appearance on mainland Japan. Godzilla causes just a bit of destruction, chewing up a train before returning to the ocean again.\n\nAt this point Japan’s authorities begin to reach out to leading scientists, trying to figure out a solution to their Godzilla problem. Dr. Serizawa takes Emiko to his lab to show her something he has discovered, that he calls “Oxygen Destroyer.” He drops just one bit of this into his fish tank, and the only thing we get to see is Emiko’s disgusted face and she screams. Later it is revealed that the Oxygen Destroyer liquifies living tissue, and the fish are dissolved.\n\nFast forward to Godzilla’s final mainland appearance. This is where I’ll start forming my actual opinion. This 3rd act of the film completely commits to the serious tone that Gojira has been setting up. Godzilla comes ashore as an unstoppable force of nature. A literal god. It is at this point that Godzilla begins to plow through Tokyo, leaving flames in his wake.\n\nThis part of the movie almost made me uncomfortable. Unlike many other monster movies made before and after, I felt like I was watching a war film instead of monster mayhem. There are shots of Godzilla mowing down civilians, and destroying buildings with people in them. There is one shot that sticks out in my mind. This scene did not make it to the American version; a mother huddled in a street corner with her two children. She calmly tells her children that everything will be alright, and that they will be seeing their father very soon in heaven. There is also a sequence in which a radio host is relaying Godzilla’s path of destruction from the vantage point of a radio tower. Godzilla turns his attention to the tower, and the radio host narrates his own demise. “The monster is drawing near,” the host says, “this surely will mean the end of me.”\n\nDuring most of this rampage, Akira Ifukube’s amazing composition is playing in the background; what would become Godzilla’s theme music which appears in nearly every film. The music mixed with the deep guttural roars from Godzilla makes a gut wrenching experience. However, what is actually more chilling are scene where the music is cut all together. I remember it catching my attention while I watched. There are a handful of scenes where viewers are just left with visuals. No music, no sounds. This was the most noticeable when the camera would sit on images of Tokyo on fire. There were no screams, no monster roar, no music. Just fire.\n\nAfter Japan is left devastated and the military chases Godzilla back into the ocean, Emiko decides to share what Dr. Serizawa had shown her earlier in the film. Together, Emiko and Ogata confront the doctor, asking if he would allow them to use the Oxygen Destroyer on Godzilla. He denies the request at first, fearing that once the news about the Oxygen Destroyer gets out world politicians would use it to make horrible weapons of war. Dr. Serizawa is eventually convinced that his work would be used for good, saving the planet from Godzilla. After agreeing, Serizawa sets all of his work on fire so that it can not be replicated, and with Ogata they don diving gear and deliver the Oxygen Destroyer to Godzilla’s watery home. This is another point of the movie where silence is used masterfully, as all the scenes underwater are devoid of sound. We get to see Godzilla meandering on the ocean floor, seemingly minding his own business. Serizawa activates the Oxygen Destroyer, and we see Godzilla begin to flail around, obviously in pain. It is at this point that Serizawa cuts the line of his gear, and decides to die with Godzilla and his life’s works. His last words to Ogata and Emiko are to live a happy life. Godzilla’s flesh melts from his bones, and then the bones dissolve. The camera lingers on a shot of the boat crew mourning the loss of Serizawa in silence. The movie ends there.\n\nGojira is not a fun movie. However, that was never the intention of the film. It is a masterpiece in the same way that Schindler’s List is revered. Many of the movie’s elements were reenactments of reality; both in real events and the real feeling of devastation. Shortly after World War II, war themed movies were banned in Japan, so ToHo studios replaced the act of war with an embodiment of war in Godzilla. The fishing boat at the beginning of the movie was a reference to a real life fishing boat that fell victim to atomic testing. The Lucky Dragon 5 and its crew were hit with nuclear fallout; most of the crew dying over the next several years from radiation poisoning. The movie is a solemn reminder of the atrocities of war, and the awful capabilities of man. With Serizawa, they showed that even good men with good intentions can be dangerous, and politicians can not be trusted.\n\nGojira might be the first movie in the franchise, but it is the last movie to harness this same feeling. ToHo would try a couple times, but each standalone Godzilla movie from that point on would be a product of its time. Gojira was such a commercial success for ToHo that they would rush a sequel just one year later. I will save a lot of detail for that review, but Godzilla Raids Again started the classic big dumb monster fights that the series is known for. The sequel is much more lighthearted, and that is the major reason why it is divisive among fans.\n\nI love this movie, but it is something that I would not watch regularly. It has to simmer for a while. I have to be in a certain mood to watch it. I had honestly forgotten how depressing the movie actually was until my recent re-watch. Since I am coming into my reviews with a critical mindset, I made sure to sit up and really pay attention. I almost wish I hadn’t because I’ve been thinking about it all day.\n\nWith that said, some causal movie-goers might not really enjoy the film. The Godzilla suit looks especially rubbery, and the scenes where they used a Godzilla puppet are painfully obvious. In the Japanese version of the film it can be kind of hard to keep track of what is going on. Since the tone of the movie is so dry, there isn’t very many character moments that will draw you in. As such, I’m sure that there are some people that would be happy dismissing the movie entirely.\n\nFor the longest time, the Americanized version with Raymond Burr was the only way to actually watch the film. I never knew there were two version of the film until I was already in my teen years. The American version was the version that got release worldwide, so it became the norm. ToHo kept the original film as their best-kept treasure until about 2004 when the company celebrated Godzilla’s 50th birthday. From that point on, it was much easier to get your hands on Gojira, often with the American version included. If you have watched this movie in the past, chances are that you actually watched the American version.\n\nI would highly recommend watching Gojira as it was intended, however I know that means you’ll have to deal with Japanese language and English subtitles. Quite a few people are insanely averse to watching films with subtitles, an issue I’ve encountered with many of my friends. Some of my all time favorite films are foreign films, so I am used to it, but I have been left frustrated multiple times when people would ignore my recommendations because they didn’t want to read.\n\nIf I had to give this movie a score… I would say 9/10. Gojira is near perfect, but elements of it have aged kind of poorly. There are very few movies I would consider perfect 10s, and I just don’t see Gojira on that same level. However, I do view Gojira as quintessential. Gojira wasn’t the first monster movie, but it is by far the best known, and is responsible for their boom throughout the 60’s. Even though the movie itself was loosely inspired by The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. The Beast was an American made movie where a prehistoric dinosaur is awakened by a nuclear detention… if that sounds familiar. The two movies couldn’t be more tonally different, however, as the Beast’s monster mayhem is mostly lighthearted, and he is eventual subdued by a roller coaster. By comparison, Godzilla is the King of the Monsters.\n\nThat is my Gojira review! Thank you for stopping by! If you liked what I had to say, consider leaving a commen, or sharing with your friends. I will be uploading a review every week, and next week will be my review for Godzilla Raids Again. I hope you check back then!\n\nGOJIRA: 9/10\n\n-LoaphMeat"
