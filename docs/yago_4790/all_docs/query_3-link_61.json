        "text": "Post by Mighty Jack on\n\nBecause I just don’t write enough! I’ll throw my hat into this ring.\n\nSock it to Shell-Head\n\n[glow=red,2,300]To Thine Own Self Be True[/glow]\n\nWe have many reviewers out and about on this board, and as they can attest - we are a breed plagued by an affliction that compels us to compile “Best Of” lists. Listing can be fun but challenging, sometimes you get it all down pat then you look again and wonder, “Do I really like X better than Z, especially with Y slotted there?” – “What about B, shouldn’t it be placed next to A but not as high as C?”\n\nIt’s enough to make your puzzler hurt.\n\nAnd I haven’t even mentioned the peer pressure.\n\nWhat if I make a silly list and look the fool, what if they revoke my reviewer’s license, what if people jeer, tease, mock and pants me? Yee gads!\n\nIt’s not that I’m a complete slave to the will of the masses. I have no problem asserting that I love Ang Lee’s Hulk while only having a lukewarm response to Richard Donner’s Superman. Let the bastiches burn me in effigy, I don’t care. I’ll stand strong because I feel so strongly about this opinion.\n\nBut it’s with the grayer areas where I find myself getting weak in the knees.\n\nI had this notion of writing a “Top comic bookie flicks of 2008” article and began with a simple list. The first 3? No problemo. Dark Knight, Iron Man, Wanted. Bada-bing, bada-boom! Easy peasy lemon squeezey, hel-looo Nurse--- er, anyway.\n\nThe back end was a breeze as well. Superhero Movie, Speed Racer, Jumper! Yes - Hole in one, nothing but net, bend over Kenny and hike me the ball!\n\nAfter popping in the Spirit followed by the Incredible Hulk I entered the realm of the loathsome gray.\n\nHellboy II, Hancock, Punisher\n\nHellyboy II had the polish and the prestige, but damned if I didn’t enjoy that insane blood bath that was Punisher War Zone.\n\nIt is at this point where I get all sweaty, become plagued by inner demons, and the floating head of my teacher haunts my very dreams (No wait, that’s what happened when I cheated on a test).\n\nIn truth this is where I ask… can I really rank it (Punisher) above the other 2? I’d normally watch the DVD to make extra sure. But I can’t do this because it hasn’t been released yet and thus far I haven’t been able to get lightning to strike my time traveling DeLorian. It is possible that when I watch it again I’ll gag and say WTF? (Or initials to that effect).\n\nSometimes movies always keep the same vibe. Sometimes they get stronger (as was the case with Iron Man and the Bat flick), sometimes they become weaker and sometimes birds suddenly appear every time you are near (which is a contradiction, but that’s neither here nor there)\n\nWith Hellboy II, repeated showings exposed the cracks and my esteem diminished in size. Hellboy II is a pretty looking film, man there’s a lot I like, yet “Boy Howdie!” there’s a lot I don’t like.\n\nSo, Punisher, Hancock, Hellboy? Yes, no…\n\nyes…\n\nMmmm no?\n\nIn truth this is a stupid internal debate. Who really gives a rat’s fuzzy beard? When I’m dead and buried do you think anyone will care. Will Saint Peter greet me at the Pearly gates with a, “Hey dumbass! Punisher, seriously? Are you high?”\n\nYes this struggle is all sound and fury signifying nothing but can you now see all the empty, insipid, useless tribulations that weigh upon my furrowed brow? Oh the burden of being a geek.\n\nSo screw it! I’m a fierce individualist and this is my list of the top comic bookie/super hero-ee flicks of 2008.\n\n1. The Dark Knight\n\n2. Iron Man\n\n3. Wanted\n\n4. Bolt\n\n5. Punisher: War Zone\n\n6. Hancock\n\n7. Hellboy II\n\n8. Incredible Hulk\n\n9. The Spirit\n\n10. Jumper\n\n11. Speed Racer\n\n12. Superhero Movie\n\nMaybe…\n\nYes…\n\nNo?\n\nPost by Mighty Jack on\n\n[glow=red,2,300]Goodbye dad, it was a beautiful day[/glow]\n\nI've tried to just post as usual these past few weeks. I spoke a bit about my father's passing and was thankful for the condolences, but I didn't want to overdo it on this board.\n\nEveryone has gone through this, everyone knows this pain and everyone has something memorable to say about someone special they've lost.\n\nBut I wanted to take a small moment and post the eulogy my Nephew gave at the funeral. It was moving and it summed up everything dad was and stood for.\n\nThe funeral was very nice. It was a traditional Catholic Mass; many family members participated as cross and candle bearers, reading of prayers etc.\n\nThis one was different for me as this was the first funeral I ever helped plan; it was my first as a Pall Bearer. Because of that it held a special significance. The songs I helped picked were chosen for a reason, the passage I chose to have printed in the announcements, each resonated a little deeper.\n\nAnd standing with my brother at the head of the casket, each of us carrying him... it was a honor to do this. He'd carried us in so many ways it was nice to be able to give him my strength in this moment.\n\nAt the cemetery there was a Navy honor guard, they saluted him and handed the flag to my mother. It was a sad but beautiful day. And that would make my father happy, that was one of the things he'd always say if you asked him how life was treating him... \"It's a beautiful day\"\n\nMy nephew’s eulogy...\n\nWhen the world loses a man like my grandfather, it feels a little emptier, but we must remember that the world’s loss is heavens gain. As I began to think of what to say today, my mind was flooded with a host of many great memories of times shared together with him. I soon began to realize that although we grieve for the loss of a man that meant so much to us all, to truly honor him, we must lighten the heaviness of our hearts and embrace the celebration of a life truly created in God's image.\n\nToday we celebrate the life of a man whose devotion and love for his family and friends is rivaled by no other.\n\nWe celebrate the life of a man who could forgive any trespass without hesitation.\n\nWe celebrate the life of a man whose wisdom and teachings were valued by many.\n\nWe celebrate the life of a man who regarded every moment of life as a precious gift no matter how simple or uneventful it seemed to the rest of us.\n\nWe celebrate of man whose unwavering faith could hold strong through even the most dismal of times.\n\nWe celebrate the life of a man who would give everything and expect nothing.\n\nWe celebrate a man who could see the rainbow in the sky even before the storm was finished.\n\nWe celebrate a man who would gladly relieve any burden and carry the heaviest cross just because he loves us.\n\nWe do not find men like this often in life. But as we look at our surroundings now, we realize these qualities can be found in the man that grandpa admired the most...Jesus. And just as Christ did for the world, my grandfather walked the Stations of the Cross for all of us as well. Just as with Christ, in death, we celebrate life.\n\nI think that anyone of us here today would give anything to have just a little more time to share with such a great man. But we must find comfort in knowing that the time we did share together with him made us all a little bit stronger. He is someone special to all of us and has touched us all in a unique way. To me, he is the foundation that the family was built on, the loving arms that embraced me every time I saw him, the smile that you couldn't help but follow with one of your own, and the man that taught me to believe in myself. I know that all that is good in myself, comes from his caring hands and guidance. He is the man that I have always looked up to...He is the father that I strive to be.\n\nSo as we remember him in our own special ways, let us also remember that he is looking on us now and waiting for us to smile.\n\nGrandpa...I know you can hear me, and although it is hard to say at this moment, I want to honor you the best way I know how...It's a beautiful day Grandpa, I know you're watching from above smiling upon us.\n\nPost by Mighty Jack on\n\nExcuse me while I piss you off (well some of you)\n\n[glow=red,2,300]Blog #3: Batman vs. Frodo![/glow]\n\nI’m not sure where all this “Dark Knight is the greatest movie ever” talk comes from. I’ve never said that myself, I can number several movies that I think are greater. But I do think it is a great movie and I imagine it would rank somewhere in my top 50.\n\nWhat I find strange in the Dark Knight debates are my LOTR friends who diss the film simply because they can’t get past a guy in a bat costume. They feel it isn’t worthy of a best picture nomination (I disagree) and then become incensed if I turn their own logic and words against them and suggest that their precious Rings movie should never have received an Oscar because it’s just about some short people with hairy feet.\n\nHey, if your going to dismiss the Dark Knight because there’s a bat suit in it then your going to have to dismiss everything with a fantastic, sci-fi, mythological slant to it.\n\nI guess I feel the same way about the LOTR saga as some people do about the Dark Knight. I feel flaws mar the Rings trilogy. Aside from bothersom Hobbits riding in trees, it’s turgid, bloated - marked by all that damned slow motion and overwrought speeches. Ugh, get over yourself movie.\n\nYeah I know some folks reading this just popped a blood vessel, but hey, I didn’t say you couldn’t love your movie with a passion. But if your going to sling mud at my God then you’d better be prepared to take a little mud in your God’s eye in kind.\n\nBut my friend got all over heated and refused to see my side of it. LOTR was the greatest movie ever in their mind and to suggest otherwise was blasphemy. Ah well, it’s not a big deal really. Dark Knight isn’t perfect but I felt it was pretty damn near. It isn’t the greatest movie ever but I feel it leaves all the Ring movies in the dust. I don’t know if it’s even the greatest movie of 2009, but from what I’ve seen, as of now it ranks among the best on my list. So let’s call a truce, your elves and wizards can keep their Oscar, if you would please not begrudge my bat and clown a shot at theirs.\n\nAnd after typing that last sentence I came to the realization that this is the silliest damned debate I’ve ever engaged in. Lo the heavens rang with the cries of “Geek war! Geek war! Geek war!”\n\nPost by Afgncaap5 on\n\nYep. Silly debate.\n\nAnd here I was hoping that you would be proposing a cage match between the caped crusader and the ring bearer, each using their own skills and weapons in a battle for supremacy. I believe that particular debate would be even sillier.\n\nAs for the movies, I think a lot of this can boil down to the old balancing act of \"what makes a good movie\" vs. \"what makes an enjoyable movie.\" Arguably, a movie needs to be at least somewhat enjoyable to be good, but also a movie needs to be a little good otherwise it can't be enjoyable.\n\nI wouldn't really call the Road movies by Bob Hope and Bing Crosby \"good,\" but I certainly enjoy them a whole lot more than Citizen Kane or The Godfather. Those latter two are masterpieces, but they just can't hold a candle to a couple of buddies in exotic locales getting into comical misadventures.\n\nI also think that this particular silly debate that you've posed overlaps a bit with the discussion about having the right story for your media. Both LotR and Dark Knight are offshoots (remakes, if you will) from other genres. I'll oversimplify it by claiming that they respectively come from Epic Fantasy Novels and Serialized Sequential Art Storytelling.\n\nBatman has the clear advantage here. There have been so many different Batman stories (and some of those stories even have their own multitudes of differing versions) that it's expected that the plot of a Batman movie can be fresh. In a LotR movie, there's not much room for deviation from the story without bringing the original fanbase into a rage (I mean, people were angry that Tom Bombadil got cut. Bombadil! I mean, I love the character, yeah, but there's no way I wanna admit to watching a movie with him in it.) Special effects and acting abilities aside (both movies did a fine job in those respects), this basically comes down to the writing aspect.\n\nHere's where we come to the focal point of the argument, I think. Fans of the Lord of the Rings movie would base their argument on the basic story, because if you boil the movies down a few levels to see simplified versions of the plot structures, LotR would definitely have the more complicated (which to the nerd mind means \"better\") structure. Fans of Dark Knight would base their argument on the script itself, for while much of what makes LotR shine had to be cut, truncated or altered, Dark Knight was able to tell its story in as precise a fashion as possible (I like how the Writing Excuses team talked about the movie being a basic Three Act formula, but with the first act being capable of standing on its own as a shorter Three Act formula.)\n\nSo there you come to the focal point, I believe, where the argument comes down to taste yet again. And, as always, there's no accounting for taste.\n\nPost by Mighty Jack on\n\n[glow=red,2,300]Blog #4: Letterheads[/glow]\n\nI was trying to find an old Iron Man letterhead when I came across this site… Comicbook Letterhead Museum. People will blog about anything; I once found one on celebrity handbags. It was just filled with pics of entertainers with their purses.\n\nI thought this was a cool blog though because it brought back so many fond memories. We don’t have letter pages anymore, it’s all done on the Internet and while immediate feedback is cool, those old letter pages were pretty fun. Here are a few of my favorites from the museum.\n\nThis is the one that inspired the title of my blog here. It was Iron Man’s original. They used to have such cute names for these things. Later on Marvel changed it to “Printed Circuits” which was more sophisticated but signaled the end of innocence. Comics would get dark and serious and Tony Stark would become an alcoholic, which would later inspire Toyfare parodies about Stark peeing in his armor in a drunken stupor.\n\nAs if Captain America wasn’t square enough. This title evokes images of white bread Steve Rodgers attempting to connect with the teens. “Hey boys and girls, lets rap. What’s bringing you a downer? What is “groovy” these days, hu kids. Tell your pal Cap because he’s down with the street lingo, can you dig on it man!”\n\nOf course if you didn’t feel the need to rap with Cap, you could always level with Daredevil. I feel it’s important to always level with a Daredevil because he might kneecap you with that Billy club of his (after using his radar sense to tell if you’re lying). This one brings to mind images of a school guidance councilor, “Level with me Chip, you did break the window in Mrs. Carleson’s class didn’t you?” This letterhead came from 1976 and it actually looks pretty good.\n\nOver at DC, circa 1959, they took a different tactic. Here we see Superman scanning letters for traces of anthrax. He also appears rather uncomfortable as if Lex had placed a kryptonite thumbtack on his chair. Or maybe he’s suffering from Super-roids? Might be why his left hand is knotted in a tighlty clenched fist (the itching, the burning, the Parasite!)\n\nHere’s one for the Hulk in the early 60s. I’m starting to wonder if I have a dirty mind. Because this entire thing makes me giggle like a schoolboy, the juxtaposition of the term “green skin”, next to that, uh, sack, which is referred to as a “Grab Bag”. Tee, Hee, Hee. Look I’m not grabbing Hulk’s bag no matter how much Stan Lee asks.\n\nPost by Mighty Jack on\n\n[glow=red,2,300]#5 Creativity[/glow]\n\nI was the quiet one in the family... sometimes I was even called the black sheep. Mom said she never had to worry about me. If the other kids had disappeared and gone quiet she knew they were into something they shouldn't, but me, she'd find me behind the recliner drawing a picture.\n\nI liked drawing when I was a kid. Mostly dinosaurs or mini war scenes with helicopters and parachutes in the sky. Friends, family and teachers would be astounded but I couldn't understand the fuss. Couldn't everybody do this? It would be like them getting excited because I had a nose.\n\nI used to send submissions to all the comic book publishers back in the day, but soon stopped. Drawing became work and besides that it hurt my hands. My hands ache, the pain is unbelievable and I mostly only scribble here and there these days. It got to where I'd hide the fact that I could even do it because of the pain. People find out you can draw and they always want a picture. Always. They never knew what a hurtin' they were putting on me with their requests.\n\nthis is the only scribbling i ever scanned and can show. I drew it at work in 2006 with a pen on the back of a report...\n\nMusic never hurt and even when it was hard work, it was more rewarding. It felt even more natural than drawing. Art was something I did, music was something I lived and breathed. Good thing... not a lot of random requests to write songs from people.\n\nLennon was a big influence because he showed me that music could give you a voice. And being a quiet kid who sat behind a recliner and drew, I didn't used to have much of a voice.\n\nMy songs reflect so much of what I'm going through. Chart my music and it would read like a diary. That diary can sound pretty tattered - I've written a concept album about what it was like to live with and love a junkie for example. It's a hard album, a difficult one to sit through for me. But I needed to write those songs, dark or not.\n\nI wonder what compels people to write stuff like the Basketball Diaries or sing, draw the equivalent? I don't have an easy answer other than it gives a release. Also it gives a certain clarity. Those bleak days...man it was like I was in the grip of madness, I was stuck in this desperate situation and losing my mind in fear, worry... I couldn't save her and watching this once funny, intelligent and talented woman deteriorate and self-destruct before my eyes split me in so many pieces. All I could do was rage and scream and cry out at the top of my lungs.\n\nTime and the writing of all those songs helped clear away the madness. It soothed the sorrow until I was no longer a raw nerve on the brink of an explosive breakdown.\n\nMaybe that's it maybe it's salvation... we write it and put it out there and feel clean again. Many of my songs are about pain, a few about love and happiness, but much are about being or feeling hurt.\n\nWriting (something other than lyrics) on the other hand is pure light and joy and happiness... I know I'm not the best writer, the grammar Police probably want to lock me in jail. A college teacher said I struggled with the technical aspects, but that I excelled on the creative side.\n\nI spend most of my time doing website reviews, I use to wonder why. Then I watched the movie \"Into the Wild\" and at the end the protagonist writes that, \"Happiness isn't real unless it's shared\" - That really clicked for me. Yeah man, I write because I get so excited over something I'm bursting to share it.\n\nIt also gives me a little shot at indulging my art side, making banners and the like add to the fun. I put so much time and effort into the appearance of my MST3K site because I wanted it to look good as well as be interesting and informative to read.\n\nI did this simple little banner a while ago. I might use in my signature. It's for a top 100 superhero movie list (I still don't quite have 100 flicks). It'll be a part of the Superhero Marathon site when it's ready. The banner isn't a major work but it was fun to make...\n\nFunny how little things bug me, there's too much space around Iron Man - I should go back to formula lol.\n\n---\n\nSo I create to share my happiness.\n\nAnd to try and understand the bad and clear my mind.\n\nAnd to disappear into my own world.\n\nAnd to experience the joy in making something that looks nice.\n\nIt's fulfilling, edifying, a kick...\n\nas a great man once said.... \"You know it's fun to have an idea\" -- \"There, wasn't that fun?\"\n\nYes, yes it was.\n\nPost by Mighty Jack on\n\n[glow=red,2,300]More Nerdy Comic book movie lists[/glow]\n\nI was fartin’ around at Rotten Tomatoes and I thought it might be fun to take my top 10 superflicks from my website reviews, and see how they ranked. Since this endeavor enchanted my simple mind I went and did my top 30. For kicks I listed and compared, using the average rating (1 to 10) as the defining factor and their less accurate percentage as the tiebreaker.\n\nNote: A lot of direct to DVD releases did not get rated at Tomatoes, so I threw them all out (so no Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman) and Internet films weren’t listed (So no Dr. Horrible as was on my list) and my beloved Cutie Honey wasn't graded. Therefore to fill out the top 30 I branched out into my top 36. Here’s the Rotten Tomatoes ranking, using my top list. My listing is shown in yellow.\n\nThe Tomato/MJ rankings\n\n1. The Dark Knight - 8.5 (94%) My Ranking #2\n\n2. The Incredibles - 8.3 (97%) #9\n\n3. Spider-Man 2 - 8.3 (93%) #1\n\n4. Robocop – 7.7 (85%) #10\n\n5. Batman Begins – 7.7 (84%) #3\n\n6. Iron Man – 7.6 (93%) #6\n\n7. Spider-Man – 7.6 (90%) #5\n\n8. X2: X-Men United – 7.4 (74%) #4\n\n9. Superman Returns – 7.1 (77%) #36\n\n10. Krrish – 7.0 (100%) #27\n\n11. Batman: Mask of the Phantasm – 6.9 (87%) #20\n\n12. X-Men – 6.9 (80%) #13\n\n13. Hellboy – 6.7 (80%) #14\n\n14. The Mask - 6.5 (77%) #32\n\n15. Darkman – 6.5 (76%) #14\n\n16. Sky High – 6.5 (72%) #22\n\n17. Tie: Batman ’89 #31 & Hollywoodland – 6.5 (69%) #11\n\n18. Unbreakable – 6.2 (67%) #8\n\n19. Hulk – 6.2 (61%) #7\n\n20. Spider-Man 3 – 6.1 (62%) #25\n\n21. Mystery Men – 5.9 (64%) #18\n\n22. Rocketeer – 5.9 (63%) #19\n\n23. Blade 2 – 5.9 (57%) #17\n\n24. X3: The Last Stand – 5.9 (56%) #26\n\n25. Zebraman – 5.9 (46%) #28\n\n26. Daredevil – 5.2 (44%) #24\n\n27. The Specials – 5.1 (47%) #23\n\n28. The Phantom – 5.1 (43%) #16\n\n29. TMNT – 4.9 (33%) #30\n\n30. Punisher: War Zone – 4.2 (24%) #34\n\nNote: I knew I was in the minority on a few sequels, so I looked them up just to see, unlike me, most rate Hellboy II higher than the first – HB II got a 7.2 (88%), which would have put it behind X2.\n\nIncredible Hulk strangely had the same average rating to Ang Lee’s Hulk – 6.2, though it did receive a higher percentage in a tie breaker (67%) – Nice to know Lee’s Hulk gets some respect out there.\n\nAnd the one I’ve never ranked high, that everyone loves?\n\nSuperman The Movie - had an 8.0 (93%), it would have been #4 Behind Spider-Man 2, ahead of Robocop. (It was interesting to see it had 3 rotten reviews. One woman actually echoes my own sentiments about the campy/Lex stuff hurting the picture. Not saying that makes me right, but it’s cool to know I’m not alone in that thought)"
