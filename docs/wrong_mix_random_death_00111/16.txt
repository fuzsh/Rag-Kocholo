Our best bets for this weekend include the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul Mary J. Blige, punk-rockers Stiff Little Fingers and rockers Switchfoot.

Mary J. Blige in Oakland

Music fads come. And music fads go. But one thing has remained the same over the past 25 years – Mary J. Blige is the undisputed Queen of Hip-Hop Soul. She earned the throne with the release of her very first album – 1992’s amazing “What’s the 411?” – and she’s been there ever since, knocking out one solid album after another. Blige is out on the road in support of her 13th studio effort, “Strength of a Woman,” and performs Sept. 9 at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. Details: 8 p.m.; $40.50-$176, www.ticketmaster.com.

Stiff Little Fingers return

The list of greatest Irish bands of all time would include The Pogues, Them, Thin Lizzy, The Chieftains, My Bloody Valentine and, of course, U2. Yet, it would also include the Stiff Little Fingers, the legendary Belfast outfit responsible for a string of punk-rock classics in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s. Led by original vocalist Jake Burns, the Fingers are definitely worth seeing in concert. Find out for yourself when the band performs Sept. 10 at Slim’s in San Francisco. Details: 8 p.m.; $23-$25, www.slimspresents.com.

Switchfoot in San Francisco

Switchfoot is back and touring behind its 10th studio effort, “Where the Light Shines Through.” The album follows such acclaimed offerings as 2009’s “Hello Hurricane,” which went on to win a Grammy for best rock or rap gospel album. The band performs a co-headlining bill with Lifehouse on Sept. 10 at The Masonic in San Francisco. Brynn Elliott opens the show. Details: 7 p.m.; $39.50-$49.50, www.livenation.com.
