Grammy winner Mary J. Blige will give away five pairs of tickets to her Friday show at the Concord pavilion this afternoon at the Powell Street Sephora store in San Francisco.

Blige will be at the two-story makeup store at the corner of Powell and Market streets from 5 to 7 p.m. to promote the Carol’s Daughter line of hair and body care products and to autograph pictures — with proof of purchase, of course.

Sephora is at 33 Powell St., San Francisco. Visit www.carolsdaughter.com for more information.
