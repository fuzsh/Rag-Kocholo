        "text": "CUPERTINO (CBS/AP) -- A pair of clips teasing Mary J. Blige's interview with Hillary Clinton on her upcoming Apple Music show \"The 411\" weren't exactly a hit on social media.\n\nThe teaser featuring the R&B singer crooning Bruce Springsteen's \"American Skin (41 Shots)\" and clasping hands with Clinton set off a flurry of negative comments after it was released on Twitter by Apple.\n\n\"Apple Music, go back in time and delete this idea from whoever's head it came from,\" wrote one user.\n\n\"Who knew you could fit so much embarrassment into one minute,\" wrote another.\n\nLike you've never seen them before.@MaryJBlige sits down with @HillaryClinton.#The411\n\nComing September 30th.https://t.co/hbaWqfjJcp pic.twitter.com/P2qpm3h3Pm\n\n— Apple Music (@AppleMusic) September 27, 2016\n\nIn a followup titled 'Someone Please Explain What the Hell Is Going on With This Mary J. Blige, Hillary Clinton Interview,' Inae Oh of Mother Jonees wrote the teaser \"created far more confusion than the excitement Apple likely intended.\"\n\nOne less cynical user wrote, \"I'm so excited about this interaction because I feel it will be honest.\"\n\nSpringsteen wrote \"American Skin (41 Shots)\" about the 1999 police shooting death of Guinean immigrant Amadou Diallo.\n\n\"The 411 with Mary J. Blige\" is set to debut September 30.\n\nTM and © Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries. CBS RADIO and EYE Logo TM and Copyright 2014 CBS Broadcasting Inc. Used under license.
