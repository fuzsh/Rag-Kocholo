        "text": "It is some years since I first met Mary J Blige. That was around the time of her third album, Share My World, which debuted at number one in the US and won her an American Music Award for best soul/R&B album. Her reputation (as a person, not a singer) wasn't good. I'd heard she was sulky and withdrawn; she was famous and successful enough not to have to care what people thought of her. She had released her debut album, What's The 411?, in 1992, and it had gone triple platinum in 1996. At the same time, she was only in her late 20s, too early in her career to have developed the old trouper's reflex courtesy.\n\nI thought maybe it would cheer her up if I took her a present. It was like getting a present for your French exchange partner: you don't know anything about them, except that they're roughly the same age as you. I gathered, from my in-depth research, that she was very close to her sister, LaTonya Blige-DaCosta, and I thought: \"I know what she'd like - this biography of the Cavendish sisters, two sisters in the English Civil War who really got on famously, and also wrote short plays and pastorals, with vaguely political subtexts.\"\n\nI gave her the book - whose cover was an indifferent oil painting of two weak-chinned aristo siblings in 17th-century frocks - and she looked at me, in the manner of, \"What possessed you?\" \"Er, thanks,\" she said. She laughed. She wasn't at all hostile, it has to be said; she just seemed incredibly shy, and uncomfortable, as if she would much rather be back home in Yonkers, the famously rough area of New York she grew up in, with whatever no-good love rat she'd fetched up with at the time. At the time, she was the Billie Holiday of failed relationships - slightly gawky, physically unprepossessing. I liked her a lot, but I wouldn't have wanted to hang out with her. She probably didn't read the book.\n\nSomething's happened between then and now - something big, probably, because Blige is a totally different person. She looks completely different: beautiful, almond-eyed, 10 years younger than she is (34), sexy, just perfect. She once told Oprah Winfrey that she had let a boyfriend treat her badly because \"I didn't believe I was beautiful. I thought I looked like a camel.\" And the funny thing was, she was beautiful, but she did also look a bit like a camel. She's chased away that look, now, anyway. Some people take an awfully long time to grow into their faces.\n\nBlige sounds different, too. She radiates warmth and - sorry, but this really is the only word for it - merriment. Her new, seventh album, The Breakthrough, sounds contented without being complacent. It's true that, as we talk, she slags off just about everybody she knows, apart from her husband, music industry big shot Kendu Isaacs, but she says it all with a smile.\n\nBlige was discovered at the age of 17 by producer Andre Harrell, a friend of her mother's boyfriend, and the man who launched LL Cool J and Run DMC. She was then taken up by Sean \"Puffy\" Combs, who produced What's The 411? Combs noticed, shortly before the rest of the world did, that Blige was never going to be any ordinary hip-hop hot stuff - not because she wouldn't take off all her clothes (although she wouldn't), but because she represented a totally original marriage of rap and soul music; without her, there would be no Destiny's Child, no Keyshia Cole. Throughout the 90s, she was the female vocalist every rapper wanted to work with; by 1997, she'd sung with Method Man, Jay-Z, Ghostface Killah, Lil' Kim. Since then, you can add Whitney Houston, Sting, Elton John (of all the nerdy, unrap faces), U2 (a yet to be released single) and Wyclef Jean. It would be quicker to name the people Blige hasn't worked with. She is also credited with inventing \"ghetto fabulous\" chic, a forerunner of bling, that hyper-designer, hyper-pricey, hyper-street look that almost every American female now favours (until they get on to a red carpet, when suddenly they dress up like Miss Marple). Mary J Blige is a force of nature, in other words, a trailblazer - and she knows it, and gives it a nod even now, 14 years into her career. \"Other people have to go out, follow what's happening. I just do what I do, and people follow me,\" she says, in a chin-jutty way that is more endearing than annoying.\n\nIt turns out that her relationship with LaTonya was less harmonious than it seemed. They no longer have anything to do with each other professionally; Blige won't say why, but she has nothing good to say about her family. Most people who grew up poor talk about the deprivation; Blige talks about the attitudes. Of her family, she says, \"The environment that I was in - they'll be mad at me, but it's the truth - they were angry, hateful, jealous, ignorant, prideful people. My aunts were very, very mean people. I didn't want to be like that. But it turns out that everything I didn't want to be like, that's what I ended up being like, and I had to change. Whatever I do, I came from that. I came from that tree. And that's the reason why I've been considered an angry, mad, ignorant black woman in the music business.\"\n\nShe was told by one of these mean aunts, she says, that she'd never finish high school, and she didn't. Any sign of ambition was stamped on, not just by her family but by the wider community. \"You couldn't stand out because you would have to fight - people would get mad at you. Even if we weren't sticking ourselves out, even if we were just leading a regular life and trying to be happy and trying to be cute, we would have problems.\"\n\nHer relationship with her mother was difficult. I ask if her mother was proud of her, if this was the life she dreamed of for her daughter. \"No, this was her dream. She wanted to do this. It might be that she's living vicariously through me, but I believe she's gotten real bitter about it. It's probably why we've never really got along. Even as a child, she was a little rough on me, because on top of my father leaving, I was singing as a child, and it was what she wanted but she didn't use it. She didn't have the courage to use it.\"\n\nIt was a similar situation with her father, whom she didn't meet for years. When she finally did, she says, his focus was all to do with his being a washed-up bass player who never made it, and with her having somehow stolen a march on him. This isn't all sob story: Blige speaks pretty neutrally, as if her life happened to someone else, but she also sounds a little conflicted, on one level the just-like-you, well-adjusted superstar, and on another the raging fury who'd still go a few rounds with her relatives if ever they fetched up in the same bar (not that they would, since she no longer drinks).\n\nShe is similarly conflicted over having \"found God\", whom she mentions a lot. On the one hand, there is no intrusive evangelism or repetitive tub-thumping; on the other, the main manifestation of her turn towards religion is that she's trying really hard not to swear. Whenever she does, she gives this demure little \"Excuse me!\", or sometimes she'll try out a synonym: \"But it takes you to hit rock bottom, and see yourself lying in all the ... shit ... excuse me ... faeces around you, it's almost like you're swimming in a toilet full of ... faeces ... and suddenly the stink hits you, and you think, oh my God, I've got to get out of here.\" I wanted to laugh, but I got the strong impression I wasn't allowed.\n\nBlige says she got into drink and drugs because everybody else did. \"When you went to school, you'd see the girl with the drug dealer boyfriends. She had everything. You can't even run halfway neck and neck with her, so you get with your group of miserable friends, and you do drugs and you drink and you say, 'Fuck it' ... excuse me.\" The fact she got signed was down to luck and coincidence on a Charlie And The Chocolate Factory scale: at 17, she made a recording of Anita Baker's Caught Up In The Rapture in a karaoke machine in a mall, which was passed on to Andre Harrell, who signed her to Uptown records, initially as a backing singer.\n\nThree years later, she released What's the 411? - critically acclaimed, listenable, original. The massive mainstream recognition, though, came with My Life, released two years later. \"I had no idea that my personal pain would create such a big fanbase,\" she says. \"Everything that was bringing me down was everything that rose me up. From a business standpoint, that is. I was still down in my personal life. All the money and fame in the world couldn't change what was going on in my heart. That's how messed up I was, and how depressed I was. But for people to like that, there had to be a lot of pain. The world is in pain. Right now, there's a fat girl at home, eating potato chips and shit - excuse me - and she thinks she's nothing because the television says you have to be skinny to be beautiful. Society wants to make you think you don't even have a place on the earth.\"\n\nBy this time, she was heavily into booze and cocaine. \"I was drinking, I was doing drugs heavy, so I couldn't even feel or see anything, and that made it all right for the moment, until I had to come down and go look for some more. But at the end of the day, it depressed me that, you know - I didn't know for sure - but that so many people were banking on my demise.\"\n\nShe gave up drinking and doing drugs when Aaliyah died, in a plane crash, on the last weekend of August 2001. \"She wasn't a close friend. It was just that when I saw her die, that's when I discovered the fact that I'm next. I don't know how or when, but I'm next. I don't know what kind of freak accident they're going to put me in, or what kind of overdose of heroin they're going to sort out, but at the end of the day, I knew I was next. I just thought, I'm scared.\"\n\nBlige believes the record business meant her ill. \"A lot of people were just depending on the fact, you know, 'She won't be around long.' There would be another girl, who looked like me, or dressed like me, or sounded like me, and there would be another one, year after year after year. It was like, 'Wow, they really expect for me to be dead.' I think the music business in general, all the record companies, were going, 'We need a Mary J Blige.' In their mind, they already thought that I was dead.\"\n\nWhether or not Blige ever believed the record industry actually meant to kill her is up for grabs; her main point is that it wouldn't have been like killing a person - it would have been like killing off old stock. I think Blige just doesn't like the industry: she thinks it's grabby and atavistic. \"I do know that in this business, it's like being in the [housing] projects again, only now we have all the stuff. You've got all this money, but you're still living right next door to the person that robbed your house. It's the same thing.\"\n\nShe is a happier person than she was, but she doesn't think America's changed at all when it comes to race relations. \"The blacker you are, the worse it is for you. If you're mixed, you've got a shot. If you cater to what white America wants you to do and how they want you to look, you can survive. But if you want to be yourself, and try to do things that fit you, and your skin, nobody cares about that. At the end of the day, white America dominates and rules. And it's racist.\"\n\nShe was very active in the Hurricane Katrina benefits; the tragedy struck a particular chord, since it happened not that far from where her grandmother used to have her to stay, in Savannah, Georgia. \"All I can remember is her going, 'Put some clothes on! You all put some clothes on!' \"\n\n\"Everybody should look at Katrina,\" she says. \"Don't act like it can't happen to us. That's how it's been for years [the rich-poor divide, she's talking about, broadly]. I haven't seen anything change. I've just seen things get worse. We would have been those people in New Orleans, the people who couldn't get out, the people who died.\"\n\nBut as improbable as it sounds, and as much as the feminist in me balks at mentioning it, Mary J Blige has been a whole new quantity since she met Isaacs. \"When you can see better, you want better. And you know, my husband, he had something better. He had a mom that raised him, he had a father that raised him. He had a family unit. He had sisters and brothers that weren't jealous of him. He didn't have to fight them. He had beautiful things in him, and he was already a Christian when I met him. When I saw his life, that's the life I wanted.\"\n\nWas she not worried she'd lose her creative spark, landing in a happy relationship? \"I wasn't happy when I got married! I was scared. The only thing I could think about was, 'This nigger - excuse me - this dude is gonna cheat on me. I'm gonna take this chance, but this is fucked - excuse me.' And at the same time, I'd actually made it to a point where I could say, 'I love this person and I want to marry him', but all that stuff in me was saying, 'I'm gonna kill him! He's gonna cheat on me, then I'm gonna kill him.' \"\n\nShe smiles again and gives her final verdict: \"I believe what God says about me. He says that I'm beautiful, I'm strong, I'm a good woman, I have love in my heart, I can be fat or skinny ... I can do whatever I want.\""
