        "text": "Mary J. Blige is giving Taraji P. Henson her flowers.\n\nOn Wednesday (April 17), TIME released its iconic \"100 Most Influential People\" issue, in which \"The Color Purple\" star was honored as an \"Icon.\" The outlet also tapped the nine-time Grammy winner to describe what solidifies Henson as an icon.\n\nThe \"Good Morning Gorgeous\" singer revealed that before they became friends, she admired the actor.\n\n\"Even before I knew her, I already felt like Taraji P. Henson was my friend. She was an actor I loved to watch, and I always felt like I could relate to her because she perfectly embodied who we are as women,\" she said. \"I couldn’t wait to meet her.\"\n\nWhen they finally met, Blige said, \"it was on and popping from there. Taraji fit right into my crew.\"\n\nThe singer also said she respects the fact that the NAACP Award winner is \"unapologetically herself\" in all areas of her life.\n\n\"Taraji is a real woman—she doesn’t bite her tongue, and she’s not afraid to stand up for what she believes in,\" she noted. \"She’s always true and authentic, and she’s just as fearless onscreen, which is why she’s one of my favorite actors. Watching her commit 1 million percent to whatever character she’s portraying is amazing. Her courage really sets her apart, in Hollywood and in real life.\"\n\nBlige wrapped up her message by encouraging Henson to \"keep being yourself and keep doing what you’re doing. There’s nobody like you. I love you.\"\n\nBy clicking Subscribe, you confirm that you have read and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Policy.
