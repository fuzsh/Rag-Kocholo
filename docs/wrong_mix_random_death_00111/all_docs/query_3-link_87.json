        "text": "As we previously reported, Andre Harrell recently passed at the age of 59. The Uptown Records founders’ passing was first announced by DJ D-Nice on his Instagram Live early Saturday morning (May 9).\n\nOn Monday (May 11), Diddy broke his silence regarding his close friend and mentor’s death. “I honestly still can’t believe it,” Diddy wrote on Instagram. “I’ve got to give myself the reality of this in doses. Because I can’t even handle this.”\n\n“I hope to God that you are all blessed to have someone in your life that loves you and believes in you like this man believed in me.… I’m going to miss him so much,” Diddy continued. “I can’t even imagine life without Dre. God bless @gianni, @onealmcknight and the rest of the family.”\n\n⁣\n\n“LOVE YOU FOREVER @andreharrell !!!!!!!!!!,” Diddy wrote in conclusion. In the post, the hip-hop mogul shared a video of himself previously publicly thanking Harrell,\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CAEC-t1H1we/\n\nMary J. Blige also recently took to Instagram to break her silence regarding Harrell. The “My Life” singer shared an old interview where she set alongside Harrell.\n\n“I don’t know where I would be if you didn’t believe in me,” Blige wrote in the caption of her post. “RIP @andreharrell … This can’t be real. Thank you for helping me and loving me until the last days of your life.”\n\n“Rest easy my musical father. I will continue to do my very best to make you proud and continue to find joy and inspiration in your life and legacy,” Mary J. Blige continued. “Another angel watching over me.”\n\nGlennisha Morgan is a Detroit-bred multimedia journalist and writer.
