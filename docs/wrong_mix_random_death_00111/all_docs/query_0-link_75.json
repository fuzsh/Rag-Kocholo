        "text": "Be sure to check out our full 2023 Summer Arts Guide to live music, movies, art, theater, festivals and more in the Bay Area.\n\nFeeling the sun’s warmth, sipping something cold and dancing with friends is life-giving. And we need more of that medicine after three years of pandemic living. Fortunately for Bay Area music fans, there’s plenty of opportunity to do all of the above with a summer calendar packed with festivals and concerts. The events we’ve rounded up range from $free.99 to splurge-worthy experiences to help you get out there and make the most of our warm(ish)-weather months.\n\nLaRussell Live From the Pergola\n\nJune 4–Aug. 6, 2023\n\nVallejo\n\nPay what you want\n\nDon’t let the boyish grin and Crocs fool you — LaRussell’s razor-sharp lyrics and savvy business maneuvers command respect. Truly a man of the people, he’s built a successful brand by selling pay-what-you-want concert tickets, and transparently narrating his artistic journey on social media in real time. His grassroots momentum has caught the eye of crucial industry figures: most recently, he appeared on a DJ Drama mixtape alongside Lil Wayne, Lil Baby and Tyler, the Creator. It probably won’t be too much longer that his backyard can contain his growing fanbase, so consider his summer Live from the Pergola shows a special opportunity to see the rising Vallejo artist perform at his parents’ house, surrounded by his real-life friends and family.\n\nSummer of Music SF\n\nSaturdays, June 17–Sept. 2023\n\nVarious locations, San Francisco\n\nFree\n\nLocal musicians need a leg up to rebound from the many difficulties they’ve faced during the pandemic. And so do small businesses in neighborhoods with dwindling foot traffic and empty storefronts. As part of the solution, local promoter Noise Pop and the nonprofit Civic Joy Fund are hoping to create a positive feedback loop of fun to bolster San Francisco’s culture and economy. Their new Summer of Music SF concert series kicks off in June, with free shows to be announced in neighborhoods such as the Mission, the Castro, Chinatown, Bayview and more.\n\nStern Grove\n\nSundays, June 18–Aug. 20, 2023\n\nStern Grove Meadow, San Francisco\n\nFree with RSVP\n\nStern Grove is a San Francisco institution, and this year the free series of park concerts kicks off with a performance by jazz fusion band Snarky Puppy. Other lineup highlights include the gritty synthpop of Santigold, the San Francisco Symphony, punk poet laureate Patti Smith and the Flaming Lips, who close out the festival at its annual Big Picnic.\n\nPeaches\n\nWith Micahtron and Your Muther\n\nJune 25, 2023\n\n1015 Folsom, San Francisco\n\n$40+\n\nWay before it was mainstream, Peaches made anthems for the pursuit of feminine sexual pleasure — with album art that featured natural-body nudity, fake beards, balaclavas and other provocative fun that doesn’t cater to the male gaze. Now it seems like the world has caught up to the cult-favorite indie star, who’s been paving the way since 2000. What else is in the teaches of Peaches? If there’s one Pride event you can’t miss, it’s Peaches in a live show produced by feminist adult performer Courtney Trouble. Rapper Micahtron and genre-bending DJ Your Muther will open, with performances by Club Mercy BDSM Burlesque and more.\n\nMosswood Meltdown\n\nJuly 1–2, 2023\n\nMosswood Park, Oakland\n\n$89+\n\nMosswood Meltdown is a wholesome gathering for punks of all ages, and this year’s fest — hosted, as always, by counterculture godfather John Waters — brings some rare treats. Following last year’s near-spiritual Bikini Kill set, Kathleen Hanna returns in a rare appearance with her electroclash outfit Le Tigre. Veteran female rap group JJ Fad, Brontez Purnell’s lovably chaotic band Gravy Train!!!! and punky funk veterans ESG are among the standout acts.\n\nIc3peak\n\nJuly 12, 2023\n\nThe Independent, San Francisco\n\n$25+\n\nIc3peak embodies true punk — not just because of their screamo vocals or dark makeup, but because the Russian duo has made it their mission to stand against oppression in an era when political dissent is criminalized in their home country. The two have previously risked arrest over anti-police lyrics. More recently, they’ve boldly taken a public anti-war stance, which carries a jail sentence in Russia. Fortunately their international profile is expanding, especially with their 2022 album Kiss of Death, which features Russian and English lyrics in an exquisite nu metal, hyperpop and rap mashup.\n\nLarry June\n\nWith The Alchemist, Monroe Flow and Dvme\n\nJuly 26, 2023\n\nThe Fox Theater, Oakland\n\n$49.50+\n\nLarry June has had an impressive come-up this year. After a decade of grinding it out in the local scene — from early SoundCloud mixtapes to opening a boba shop — the entrepreneurial rapper exploded nationally with his Alchemist-produced album The Great Escape, a collection of luxuriously laidback rhymes for coastal drives to cliffside mansions. Aspirational yet playful, June’s raps bridge hip-hop generations, and he has a proud legion of fans at home in the Bay watching his rise. The two hometown dates of his national tour sold out, but fortunately The Fox Theater has added a third night with tickets available.\n\nBlue Note Jazz Festival\n\nJuly 28–30, 2023\n\nSilverado Resort, Napa\n\nSingle-day general admission: $225+, three-day pass: $575+\n\nThe 2010s saw the explosion of mega-fests like Coachella, whose lineups are enormous enough to appeal to hundreds of thousands of fans. But there’s something to be said for a more intimate experience catering to the diehards of a specific scene. Blue Note Jazz Festival is that event for the grown-and-sexy hip-hop, jazz and soul crowd. It’s definitely on the pricey side, and in a remote wine country location, but seeing Mary J. Blige, Nas and Chance the Rapper in a small-ish crowd as the sun sets behind oak trees sounds like a peak experience to me. This festival celebrates top-tier Black musical excellence: the 2023 lineup also includes funk legend George Clinton, drum virtuoso Yussef Dayes and powerhouse vocalists like Ari Lennox.\n\nOutside Lands Music & Arts Festival\n\nAug. 11–13, 2023\n\nGolden Gate Park, San Francisco\n\nSingle-day general admission: $199+, three-day pass: $449+"
