        "text": "Aretha. Otis. Marvin. Sam. Gladys. James.\n\nMary J.\n\nPeople are understandably reluctant to include a contemporary artist on any list of all-time greats. It’s risky to make such a call without the benefit of hindsight. Yet, the case presented on Saturday night at the Sleep Train Pavilion was undeniable:\n\nMary J. Blige deserves to be ranked among the greatest soul singers in history.\n\nHer 90-minute set in Concord was nothing less than spectacular, delivering reason after reason why Blige is in the same class as Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye, Sam Cooke, Gladys Knight, James Brown and any other soul singer worth mentioning.\n\nBlige is the single most influential female vocalist of the last 20 years, having married hip-hop and soul in a fashion that has inspired countless imitators. Yet, as Saturday’s show so eloquently demonstrated, nobody does it better than Blige. Nobody really comes close.\n\nIt’s remarkable to see how, at 41, she’s as powerful as ever. And she’s been on top of the game for 20 years, ever since she released the debut “What’s the 411?” in 1992. Her peak period, which shows no signs of closing anytime soon, has lasted longer than those of most of the previously mentioned legends.\n\nShe opened the show with a nod to another soul icon, Chaka Khan, as she covered the 1983 hit “Ain’t Nobody,” which Blige recorded on her most recent album, last year’s “My Life II … The Journey Continues (Act 1).” She then moved into one of her own up-tempo classics, “Family Affair” (from 2001’s “No More Drama”), sending the some 7,000 fans in attendance into a frenzy.\n\nBlige worked a stage populated with a full band and some backup vocalists, yet it was hard to pay attention to anybody other than the main attraction. Her sheer star power was nearly blinding, brightening up the venue in ways that far exceeded what came from the expert light show.\n\nMaybe Blige lacks pure vocal chops of some of her contemporaries — Mariah Carey, for instance — but what she has, in abundance, is passion.\n\nThat was never more clear than on “No More Drama,” which she sang like her life depended on it, delivering more feeling in one song than most multi-octave songbirds muster up in entire careers. We felt her pain. We believed each word like it was coming from our own diaries. Then we celebrated her — our — triumph.\n\nIt was an emotional roller coaster of a set, propelled by the promise that the ride would somehow manage to stay on track. What a thrill.\n\nD’Angelo, the neo-soul crooner who came to fame in the mid-’90s, was the other attraction on the bill. Remember him? He was pretty good back in the day, but he basically hasn’t been heard from since 2000’s “Voodoo” (although a new album has been promised — and promised).\n\nWhat’s D’Angelo been doing over the last dozen years? It’s a pretty safe bet that he hasn’t spent much time practicing his live show. The soul star’s set was a disorganized mess — built on meandering jams, pointless solos and curious song selections. It was, to be blunt, a disservice to his local, patient fans."
