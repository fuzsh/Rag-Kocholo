        "text": "If you’ve got dry skin – seriously dry skin – Carol’s Daughter has your name written on it.\n\nThis nature-inspired line started about 15 years ago in Brooklyn native Lisa Price’s (a.k.a. Carol’s Daughter) home. Her creations spread like wildfire and within a few years counted celebs like Jada Pinkett Smith, Mary J. Blige, Erykah Badu, Brad Pitt and Chaka Khan as fans.\n\nNow, Carol’s Daughter is partnering with Mary J. Blige’s charity FFAWN to help send women to college. Blige will appear on Oprah today, April 13, to announce the news. But, first, let’s talk about all these handmade goods.\n\nI’ve used the Almond Cookie Sea Salt Scrub ($28; above). With avocado, jojoba and wheat germ oil it leaves skin super supple. It’s got chunky granules of sea salt so you don’t need to rub much. I actually think I scrubbed my arm a little too aggressively, which made it a bit sensitive for a few minutes.\n\nI’ve also used the Love Butter ($18; above) a spicy blend of honey, cinnamon and brown sugar. It’s intensely rich and leaves skin with high sheen. It’s great on legs after shaving, as well as on elbows and knees. My honey wasn’t fond of the scent (it’s quite cinnamon-y), but it’s magic on dry skin. My feet looked like I had a professional pedi after a quick rubdown.\n\nI’m SO coveting the Almond Cookie Shea Souffle ($13-$30; above). Tell me that doesn’t sound like your skin wouldn’t want to gobble that up?\n\nAnd, how about the SweetHoneyDipChocolateBrownSugah Body Butter ($18; above)? Shut up and give me a spoon!\n\nThe roster of products for hair, body & bath, hands & feet, face, even kids is extensive, natural and soothing. All products have mouth-watering ingredients with names to match.\n\nNow for the cool part:\n\nIn celebration of this partnership and to campaign to send women to college, today and tomorrow, Carol’s Daughter will donate 30% of all online purchases on CarolsDaughter.com to Mary J. Blige’s charity FFAWN, the Foundation for the Advancement of Women Now, Inc.\n\nMary J. Blige will appear on Oprah today to announce the partnership. She has been an avid supporter and fan of Carol’s Daughter for more than five years now."
