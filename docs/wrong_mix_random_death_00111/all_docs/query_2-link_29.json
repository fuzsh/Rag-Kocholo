I don’t know what I’m going to do without you baby. I miss you so much. Today I’m going to pay tribute to you, I’m going to try and find the words to explain our unexplainable relationship,\" he said.\n\nQuestions around Diddy's former lovers are of concern following a lawsuit alleging that the mogul subjected R&B singer Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura to a yearslong relationship that included beatings and rape.\n\nVentura, alleged in the suit filed against the producer and music mogul in New York federal court that Combs brought her into his \"ostentatious, fast-paced, and drug-fueled lifestyle\" not long after she met him and signed to his label when she was 19 and he was 37 in 2005.\n\nAttorney Ben Brafman said Combs \"vehemently denies\" the allegations, calling them \"lies.\" The two reached a settlement 24 hours later.\n\nWho is Kim Porter?\n\nThe model, actress, and former assistant dated Diddy for 13 years in an on-again-off-again relationship that ended when she died.\n\nPorter also has a son, actor-singer Quincy Brown, from a previous relationship with R&B singer Al B. Sure!\n\nQuincy is Combs' adopted son with Kim Porter.\n\nPorter has appeared in films and TV series like \"The Brothers\" and \"Single Ladies,\" and was very connected within the entertainment industry.\n\nHow did Kim Porter die?\n\nNovember 16, 2018: Kim Porter dies at 47\n\nAt the time, citing law enforcement sources, TMZ reported that police received a call to Porter's Los Angeles home around noon and the 911 call reported \"a patient in cardiac arrest.\"\n\nAP reported that Porter was found dead in her Los Angeles home after going into cardiac arrest while fighting flu-like symptoms.\n\nAt the time it still remained unclear how she died.\n\nTributes began pouring in online after news of Porter's death broke.\n\nNovember 26, 2018: Kim Porter laid to rest in Georgia\n\nA little over a week after her passing, Combs eulogized Porter at her funeral in her hometown of Columbus, Georgia.\n\nNumerous celebrities, including Usher, Mary J. Blige, Lil' Kim and producer Russell Simmons attended the ceremony, which ended with fireworks.\n\nThe funeral took place at Cascade Hill Church.\n\nThe Porter, Goodwin and Combs families said in a statement that \"God broke the mold when he made Kim, there was truly no other woman like her.\"\n\nJanauary 25, 2019: Coroner confirms Porter died from pneumonia\n\nNearly two months later, the Los Angeles coroner's office confirmed that Porter had died from pneumonia.\n\nThey released the results of its investigation into Porter's Nov. 15 death. Investigators determined after an autopsy that her death was from natural causes.\n\nCombs eulogized Porter at her funeral in her hometown of Columbus, Georgia. Numerous celebrities, including Usher, Mary J. Blige, Lil' Kim and producer Russell Simmons attended the ceremony, which ended with fireworks.\n\nCombs called Porter \"more than a soul mate\" in a tweet after her death.\n\nDiddy has two other children, Justin Dior Combs with fashion designer Misa Hylton, and Chance Combs with internet personality Sarah Chapman."
