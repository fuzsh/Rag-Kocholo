        "text": "Share My World is Mary J. Blige's third studio album.\n\nThe album was released on April 22, 1997 on MCA Records. It became Mary's first number-one album on the Billbord 200 chart & her first album where she serves as an executive producer (alongside the other executive producer Steve Stoute).\n\nIt contains guest appearances by hip hop and R&B artists such as Lil' Kim, Nas, George Benson, Roy Ayers, R. Kelly, Nas & The LOX.\n\nAlbum Background[]\n\nThe album marked several personal and professional changes in Mary's life and career.\n\nFollowing the departure of label head Andre Harrell the year before, she left Uptown Records in favor of its MCA parent label.\n\nMeanwhile, she severed professional ties with long-time producer, manager and mentor Sean “Puffy” Combs shortly before the production of the album began.\n\nHis absence was filled with a bevy of high profile producers such as Rodney Jerkins, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Babyface, Bryce Wilson and R. Kelly.\n\nThe end result produced an album that was less entrenched in the hip-hop soul of her first two albums and replaced with a style that was more aligned with contemporary R&B music.\n\nDuring the making and run of her sophomore album \"My Life,\" Mary had reportedly experienced clinical depression, while also battling drug and alcohol addiction, and enduring an often turbulent relationship with K-Ci Hailey (all of which heavily influenced the dark mood of that album).\n\nIn 1996, Mary reportedly made a concerted effort to clean up her life and subsequently found herself in more positive frame of mind while recording \"Share My World\" which influenced the albums noticeably lighter mood.\n\nTracklisting[]\n\nIntro (1:21) (written & produced by Poke & Tone and Rich Nice)\n\nI Can Love You (feat.

It also reached number thirty-seven on the German Albums Chart.\n\nCritical Reception[]\n\nAlex Henderson of Allmusic gave the album a full four out of five stars, stating that:\n\n\"Her strongest and most confident effort up to that point, Share had much more character, personality, and honesty than most of the assembly line fare dominating urban radio in 1997. For all their slickness, emotive cuts like \"Get to Know You Better,\" \"Love Is All We Need,\" and \"Keep Your Head\" left no doubt that Blige was indeed a singer of depth and substance. Although high tech, the production of everyone from R. Kelly (with whom she duets on the inviting \"It's On\") and Babyface to Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis doesn't come across as forced or robotic, but, in fact, is impressively organic.\"\n\nErnest Hardy of Rolling Stone commended Brandy's transition from sound to singing, gave the album three-out-of-five stars, commenting that\n\n\"On Share My World even Blige's harshest critics will have to concede that she's moved beyond sound to real singing. Listen to \"Seven Days,\" \"Missing You\" and the already-classic \"Not Gon' Cry\" (also on the \"Waiting to Exhale\" soundtrack), and you hear Blige's signature ache married to newfound technique. There's shading, depth and control in her vocals now.\"\n\nHowever in the 2004 edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, the album was viewed in an ambivalent light, stating that \"[i]t displays Blige's hit-song savvy but fewer memorable performances.\"\n\nMusic critic Robert Christgau gave the album a favorable review, commenting that:\n\n\"Blige is a diva for her own time. As befits her hip hop ethos, she's never soft if often vulnerable, and as befits her hip hop aesthetic, she plays her natural vocal cadences for melodic signature and sometimes hook. She redefines the New York accent for the '90s. And she's taken two straight follow-ups to the next level.\" He awarded the album an (A-) rating.\n\nJonathan Bernstein of Entertainment Weekly was also favorable of the album, and gave it a B+ rating, but was critical of Mary's songwriting, stating that \"...[i]t comes off as meandering and half finished.\"\n\nHe went on to praise the album, regarding that:\n\n\"In another era, when songcraft was a consideration and singers had discernible identities, Mary J. Blige might have attained the mid-level status of a Thelma [Houston]. But right now, having made an uneven album packed with career-peak performances, she is the only example of a hip-hop soul practitioner attempting to make a record that's more than a product placement opportunity for Lexus and Cristal. For that, Blige deserves her crown.\"\n\nSteve Jones of USA Today was also pleased with the album, and he awarded three-and-a-half out of four stars, commenting that \"The songs run the usual gamut of love themes, but it's Blige's powerful, emotional deliveries and street sensibility that separate her from the competition.\"\n\nPersonnel[]\n\nMichael Jordan – Guitar\n\nR.
