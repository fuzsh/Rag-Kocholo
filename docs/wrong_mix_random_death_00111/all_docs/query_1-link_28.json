        "text": "This section presents lists of contemporary and historic African American entrepreneurs in the United States who have made an impact in the business world. While these lists are by no means comprehensive, they provide a good starting point for students, scholars, and independent researchers to begin researching prominent and influential African American businessmen and businesswomen. Researchers may notice that several historic African American entrepreneurs were heavily involved in beauty, health, and fashion including but not limited to Annie T. Malone, Madame C.J. Walker, Rose Meta Morgan, Anthony Overton, and many more. Many were also either the descendants of enslaved people or born into slavery and freed with the passage of the 13th Amendment. Furthermore, several contemporary African American entrepreneurs became prominent businessmen and businesswomen only after reaching celebrity in other fields such as music and sports, including but not limited to Jay-Z, Rihanna, Michael Jordan, and many more. Even in present times, the beauty, health, and fashion industries have proved incredibly lucrative for African American entrepreneurs.\n\nConsult the Biography page for search advice and resources to search on African American entrepreneurs. To begin doing more in-depth research on individuals from the past, search for business advertisements in both the Prints & Photographs Online Catalog and Chronicling America, as well as for portraits and pictures of the men and women themselves. Also visit the Doing Company Research guide to learn how to conduct in-depth research on companies and businesses. To find more general photos of African American businesses and their owners, search African American businesses or Negro businesses in the Prints & Photographs Online Catalog."
