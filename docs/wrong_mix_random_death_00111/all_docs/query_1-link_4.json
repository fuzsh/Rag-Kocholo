He recently taught his first course at the Juilliard School entitled ‘Fusion, Re-imagination and Revelation.’\n\nAbout Denise Carite, vocalist\n\nShe has recorded with Stevie Wonder, Katy Perry, 30 Seconds to Mars, Adam Lambert, Moby, Coldplay, and has sung on the films Jordan Peele’s Us, The Lion King, Just Mercy, Hidden Figures, the Boss Baby, Monster High: The Great Scarrier Reef, and is the singing voice of R&B on Trollstopia. She has two song placements as a co-writer with Coldplay on “Higher Power” and Daya’s “Sit Still, Look Pretty” debut album.\n\nWhile these life-changing opportunities have fueled her artistic fire, they have simultaneously kept Denise humbled and inspired.
