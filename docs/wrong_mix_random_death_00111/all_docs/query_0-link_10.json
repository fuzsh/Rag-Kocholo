        "text": "Mia and Tony met at a mutual friend’s barbeque in 2010. Eight years later and this committed pair made their union official with a minimalistic wedding at San Francisco City Hall. Check out their special day, captured by Karen De Jager: Spectrum Photography.\n\nBride’s full name: Mia H. Jones\n\nGroom’s full name: Tony Jones\n\nPlace of residence: Martinez, California\n\nWedding date: August 1, 2018\n\nWedding location: San Francisco City Hall, San Francisco, California\n\nEngagement story:\n\nAfter a year of dating, we bonded our little family and moved in with each other. During the move, Tony knew that was his chance and proposed to me in our new living room. It was perfect.\n\nWhat makes your love special?\n\nI had a son and Tony had a daughter from a previous relationship, and neither of us were looking for anything romantic. We enjoyed a budding friendship for two years while we were focused on our own lives and raised our children. We grew very close and came to rely on each other as best friends do. Since our relationship is so deeply rooted in friendship, we have a solid foundation to grow from.\n\nFrom the Bride:\n\nWe were married under the San Francisco City Hall Rotunda in front of family and close friends. The ceremony was simple, elegant, and personal. I walked down the aisle with my mother by my side while I held a picture of her father who had passed.\n\nWe recited our own vows and promised to love each other through the good, bad, and child raising! Tony promised to love me on the difficult days and I promised to always make Tony dinner.\n\nFrom the Groom:\n\nI got to marry the most beautiful woman in the world, who happens to be my best friend. The day was mostly a blur but the clearest moment of the day was when Mia turned the corner and we made eye contact. I knew at that moment that everything was going to be just fine. And that I was the luckiest man in the world!\n\nYour most memorable moment:\n\nWe ended our big day filled with love and smiles and headed to the beach for a private toast to our newly wedded bliss. As the sun set on our perfect day, we cuddled close and planned our future together.\n\nWedding song:\n\n“Give Me You” by Mary J Blige. This song means a lot to Tony and I. I’m a woman of simple taste and style. I don’t ask for a lot and this song embodies that.\n\nFavorite wedding detail:\n\nI loved the way our centerpieces came out. My flossy posse banded together are created them, with the help of our planner.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to as a married couple?\n\nI’d have to say building a life of happiness and love. Buying a house, going on vacations, watching our children grow and accomplish goals. Watching Tony coach our son’s basketball team. Just being an old married couple!\n\nAdvice for a Bride and Groom on their wedding day:\n\nGet a planner you trust early and set a budget. It will make your wedding planning so much easier!\n\nPlease feel free to include any other interesting anecdotes from your big day:\n\nMy flossy posse toasted our marriage and my mom blessed us with many happy years to come. Tony’s cousin gave up his secrets with a funny story and his aunt asked us for another baby. The toasts were absolutely hilarious and were one of my favorite parts of the day.\n\nCongratulations to the happy couple! We wish you many years of wedded bliss!\n\nSources"
