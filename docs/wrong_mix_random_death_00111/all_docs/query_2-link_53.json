        "text": "What is synesthesia?\n\nSynesthesia is a phenomenon that causes sensory crossovers, such as tasting colors or feeling sounds. Some people describe it as having “wires crossed” in their brain because it activates two or more senses when there’s only a reason for one sense to activate.\n\nSynesthesia isn’t a disease or a medical condition, but it can be a symptom of certain brain-related conditions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n\nHow does synesthesia work?\n\nTo understand synesthesia (pronounced “sin-ess-THEE-zh-uh”), it helps to understand how your senses work. Your brain relies on your five main senses — sight, sound, smell, taste or touch — to know what’s happening around you.\n\nThat involves the following steps:\n\nDetection: Your senses pick up something happening around you. An example would be using your eyes to look at your surroundings or using your ears to listen for certain sounds.\n\nSignaling: Your senses send a signal to your brain describing what they’re experiencing. For example, your eyes would describe the colors and shapes of the things you can see nearby, or your ears would send signals that describe how loud a sound is, if it’s high- or low-pitched, etc.\n\nProcessing: Your brain receives those signals and routes them to a certain area for processing. The area that does the processing connects to areas that help you understand what you’re seeing. Examples of this are recognizing a stop sign by its shape and/or color or recognizing that a sound is a piece of music or someone’s voice.\n\nIn short, your senses describe to your brain what they pick up, and your brain creates its own understanding of the world around you from those descriptions. But people with synesthesia experience the processing step differently. Their brains process the same information through two or more brain areas at once. That causes a primary and at least one secondary effect:\n\nPrimary effect: The primary effect is what you experience because of sensory input. An example of this would be hearing sounds and recognizing them as music.\n\nSecondary effect: People with synesthesia experience a secondary effect (or more than one) that seems like it’s one of their senses working, but there’s no input from that sense that should be causing it. An example of this would be seeing colors because you hear music.\n\nVisual synesthesia can also happen in different ways. Some people experience visual synesthesia like a “projection,” meaning their brain directly combines the secondary effect into their sense of sight. That causes them to experience it as if they actually see it. Other people have an “internal screen” effect. They can automatically picture it in their head but don’t experience it as if they were seeing it directly.\n\nHow many different forms of synesthesia are there?\n\nWhile you have five main senses, there are many different things you can identify with each sense. These are perception abilities. Some examples include:\n\nSight: Colors, patterns, textures, shapes.\n\nHearing: Volume, pitch, frequency.\n\nTouch: Temperatures, pressure, textures, vibrations, pain.\n\nSome perception abilities involve more than one sense, like balance. Your perception abilities can also involve concepts you understand using your senses, such as time, numbers and language.\n\nBecause there are so many possible combinations between your senses and perception abilities, researchers can identify at least 60 different forms of synesthesia. Some experts estimate there are more than 150 different forms. This is also why many people with synesthesia have it but don’t know what it is or that it’s unusual.\n\nSome forms of synesthesia are better known or are more common. These include:\n\nAuditory-tactile synesthesia.\n\nDay-color synesthesia.\n\nGrapheme-color synesthesia.\n\nHearing-motion synesthesia.\n\nMirror-touch synesthesia.\n\nTime-space synesthesia.\n\nVisualized sensations.\n\nAuditory-tactile synesthesia\n\nThis form of synesthesia means that sounds cause you to feel touch-based sensations, such as temperature changes, pressure or pain.\n\nDay-color synesthesia\n\nSome people see or associate certain colors with days of the week. This is one of the more common forms of synesthesia.\n\nGrapheme-color synesthesia\n\n“Grapheme” is the word for the smallest part of a written language, like a letter, number or symbol. Some people see different graphemes with specific colors. People who experience visual synesthesia’s projection effect often see graphemes as different colors.\n\nHearing-motion synesthesia\n\nSome people experience sounds related to seeing things moving. An example of this would be a person hearing a “whoosh” sound when watching something go past them.\n\nMirror-touch synesthesia\n\nMirror-touch synesthesia is when you see something happen to someone else and physically feel it, too. It works similarly to the reflexive cringe you might have if you see someone trip and face-plant in front of you. However, the effect is much stronger.\n\nSome people can watch another person being touched on the arm or hand and they also feel it. Other people can actually feel pain that others describe or pain from visible injuries. This form is more likely to be disruptive if it causes you to feel pain as a secondary effect.\n\nSound-color synesthesia\n\nSound-color synesthesia is where you see specific colors when you hear certain sounds. It tends to be specific to certain sounds or music. Musicians and artists often describe having this form.\n\nTime-space synesthesia\n\nThis is a form of synesthesia where you visualize things in a very specific way. People who have this form of synesthesia often “see” sequences with specific patterns or forms. An example of this is visualizing a calendar or a string of numbers in a certain way. Some people can mentally “map” these out in vivid or detailed ways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCan synesthesia have different levels of intensity?\n\nYes, synesthesia can affect people differently. Some people may only experience synesthesia under certain circumstances. Others may experience synesthesia for many reasons, or they might experience more than one secondary effect.\n\nIn severe cases, synesthesia can be strong enough to affect your ability to concentrate or focus. Fortunately, this is rare. Synesthesia is usually short-lived, so it’s usually not disruptive to this degree. People who do have it to this extent can usually learn to manage these secondary effects.\n\nIs synesthesia something that happens naturally, or is it learnable?\n\nScientists and researchers have worked to describe and understand synesthesia since the 1800s, but skepticism about this was also very common. It wasn’t until the 1990s that imaging technologies like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) allowed scientists to see activity in specific brain areas. Those technologies were key in confirming that synesthesia is real.\n\nBut research shows synesthesia often has a learned component. Some examples of this are learning the alphabet, counting and numbers, or the names of days and months of the year. And there’s evidence that synesthesia may be something people develop very early in life to help themselves learn and retain information.\n\nResearch also shows you can “train” yourself to have a synesthesia-like response with practice. But the effect is temporary and can fade if you don’t use it. It’s also not as fast or as strong as someone who experiences synesthesia naturally.\n\nHow rare is synesthesia?\n\nSynesthesia isn’t common, but it isn’t rare, either. Experts estimate at least 4% of people worldwide experience it. However, that number may be higher because there are so many possible forms of synesthesia. Some experts estimate that certain forms of synesthesia — especially time-space synesthesia — may affect as many as 1 in 8 people. It’s also possible that synesthesia is so natural for some people that they experience it and don’t realize what it is.\n\nWhat is the rarest synesthesia?\n\nExperts know that some forms of synesthesia are rare, but there’s no way to know which form is rarest. A major reason for this is that many people have synesthesia and don’t know what it is or think that everyone experiences it. But the available research shows that taste- and smell-based forms of synesthesia are less common, while sight-, hearing- and touch-based forms of synesthesia are more common.\n\nAre there advantages to having synesthesia?\n\nResearch shows that synesthesia has benefits. People with it often have better memory abilities relating to the form of synesthesia they have. They also tend to score higher on tests that measure intelligence.\n\nSynesthesia also has clear ties to creativity, and people with synesthesia are more likely to choose creative- or art-based careers. Sound-color synesthesia is something that many music artists have. Famous music artists with synesthesia include Beyoncé, Duke Ellington, Billy Joel and Mary J. Blige.\n\nIs synesthesia a mental illness?\n\nNo, synesthesia isn’t a mental health condition. In some cases, it can be a symptom of certain medical issues, but this is rare.\n\nCan people who can’t use certain senses still have synesthesia?\n\nYes, synesthesia can happen in people with certain sensory problems. There are confirmed cases of synesthesia in people who developed blindness later in life and in at least one person with congenital blindness (meaning they had blindness when they were born). There’s also research on one person with synesthesia and a color vision problem who could still experience a color their eyes couldn’t actually see.\n\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nSynesthesia is a phenomenon that causes sensory crossovers, which means you experience the world with two or more senses or perception abilities that aren’t otherwise related. Research shows synesthesia involves real differences in how your brain works, especially when it starts in childhood. It isn’t a medical condition, but it can be a symptom of certain issues when it happens after childhood.\n\nPeople with synesthesia tend to be more intelligent, creative and have better memory abilities. If you think you have synesthesia, there’s no shortage of books, online communities and other resources to help you explore it. They can help you better understand the way your brain works. That’s the first step to using this ability in a way that enriches and improves your life."
