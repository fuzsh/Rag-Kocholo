The North American summer trek now includes new dates in Brooklyn, Baltimore, Newark, and Indianapolis, as well as a special closing show at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.\n\nSet to run from early July through mid-September, the “Royalty Tour” will see the R&B icon and rap legend turn in hit-filled sets night after night.

Ahead of their upcoming concerts together, last month Blige and Nas shared a new single called “Thriving”.\n\n(Read: The 25 Greatest Hip-Hop Debut Albums)\n\nTickets for the new tour dates go on sale this Friday, June 28th via LiveNation.
