        "text": "Irv Gotti has been accused of sexually assaulting a woman he allegedly dated a couple of years ago.\n\nIn a report the Miami New Times published on Tuesday, July 16, a woman only known as \"Jane Doe\" filed a lawsuit against the Murder Inc. Records co-founder for allegedly sexually assaulting and abusing her in Saint Martin, Miami, and Atlanta over two years. The woman claims she met Gotti through a mutual friend at a poker tournament in the summer of 2020. Afterward, he invited her on a vacation to Saint Martin. Once they got there, Doe claims Gotti threatened to send her home if she didn't have sex with him.\n\n\"Due to his power and influence in the music world, she complied,\" the lawsuit states. \"As a result of this sexually abusive relationship, Plaintiff has suffered severe emotional and psychological harm for which she had to be committed to a psychiatric ward. These injuries continue and affect Plaintiff to this day.\"\n\nAfter that trip, Jane Doe began a relationship with Gotti that lasted until 2022. Throughout that time, she claims Gotti abused her by forcing her to do sexual acts on him and putting her down. In one instance, Gotti allegedly flew her out to Miami in January 2022 and forced her to give him oral sex in the elevator of the Four Season Hotel. A few months later, he flew her out to Atlanta and forced her to perform oral sex on him while they traveled in an Uber.\n\nJane Doe also claims Gotti defamed her to his massive social network after their relationship ended. The victim claims she \"endured significant pain and suffering of both mind and body and will continue to endure such pain and suffering in the future.\" She's currently seeking a trial by jury.\n\nYou can read the full lawsuit here. iHeartRadio has reached out to Irv Gotti for comment. See what Way Up With Angela Yee had to say about the situation below."
