        "text": "Chance the Rapper is making concert moves this year!\n\nThe Voice Coach will be headlining an upcoming music festival called The Blue Note Jazz Festival this July. Other performers include Mary J Blige, Nas, Ari Lennox, Gary Clark Jr., and more. Read about all the details, below.\n\nWhat is the Blue Note Jazz Festival?\n\nPer the festival's website, \"With jazz at its vibrant core, the Blue Note Jazz Festival brings the biggest names in music and culture to the most intimate, small-town setting.\"\n\nHow do I get tickets to the Blue Note Jazz Festival?\n\nTickets go on sale Friday, April 7 and can be purchased here.\n\nWhen is the Blue Note Jazz Festival?\n\nThe California version of this year's Blue Note Jazz Festival will take place July 28, 29, and 30, 2023.\n\nChance the Rapper's Norman, Oklahoma free concert\n\nChance the Rapper is also performing a free concert in Oklahoma this April to support a faith-based, student-led nonprofit organization at the University of Oklahoma. The concert will take place at the Gaylord Family-Oklahoma Memorial Stadium and will be held on April 29, 2023, at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nThe show's mission is to be \"an event that brings people together for a concert and gospel proclamation on OU’s campus,\" according to OU Daily.\n\nTickets for the concert can be purchased in advance here.\n\nChance the Rapper is currently making his mark as a new Coach on The Voice for Season 23. In a recent interview with TODAY, he opened up about his mentorship techniques and his personal mission as to why he chose to be on the show.\n\n“My main goal on being on the show is trying to help the other Artists bring themselves out of their performances. I wanna give people the opportunity to show their identity, to tell their story through song. It's not so much about turning them into an Artist but just giving them a platform to be themselves, sing the songs they grew up listening to, really just present themselves fully,\" he explained.\n\nHe also gave some details about his upcoming album. “The Star Line Gallery has been well underway. I started it off when I first traveled to Ghana last year, and I met with some of the top contemporary Artists, painters, sculptors, all types of different visual Artists in the world and started creating connections overseas with Artists in Jamaica, and Artists on the continent, and we basically come together and create new pieces,” he said."
