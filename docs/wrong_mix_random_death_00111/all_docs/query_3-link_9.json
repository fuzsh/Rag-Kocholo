The page quickly gained nearly one million followers, and the news spread to other social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram. Many fans were shocked and saddened by the news, and expressed their grief and disbelief.\n\nThe Debunking of the Hoax\n\nHowever, the news was soon revealed to be a complete hoax and a cruel prank.

They also urged fans to stop believing what they see on the internet, and to check the official sources for any news about the singer. The Facebook page was also exposed as a scam, as it was created by a group of hackers who wanted to generate traffic and revenue from the clicks and views. The page was eventually deleted by Facebook, and the hackers were reported to the authorities.\n\nThe Reaction of the Singer and the Fans\n\nMary J Blige herself did not comment on the hoax, as she was busy working on her upcoming projects and preparing for her tour. However, she did post a video on her Instagram account on December 12, 2023, where she thanked her fans for their love and support, and assured them that she was doing fine and happy. She also sang a snippet of her hit song âNo More Dramaâ, and said that she was looking forward to seeing her fans on the road. The video received over 10 million views and thousands of comments from fans who were relieved and glad that she was alive and well. Many fans also expressed their anger and frustration at the hoax, and said that it was disrespectful and hurtful to the singer and her family.\n\nConclusion\n\nMary J Blige is not dead, and she is still going strong as one of the most iconic and talented singers of our time. She has overcome many challenges and hardships in her life, and she has inspired millions of people with her music and her message. She is a living legend, and she deserves respect and admiration, not fake death rumors and hoaxes.
