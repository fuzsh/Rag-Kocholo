        "text": "On March 9, 1997, the world lost the greatest rapper of all time — but only in the physical form. Despite the aftermath of that fateful date, the life of Christopher Wallace, better known as “The Notorious B.I.G.,” is preserved through lasting memories. After all, besides death, one of two things guaranteed in life is memories. While the former creates an air of solemness, the latter is what prompts a light to shine through.\n\nFor Big, that light is what has allowed legacy to loom larger by the year. From his family to the sonic motion pictures he scored in his lifetime (Ready to Die, Life After Death); not to mention the foundations laid because of his iconic presence (REVOLT) and the undying love of his borough, the thrill of Big’s presence is far from gone.\n\nWhere there is life, there are memories. So in keeping with that notion, we spoke to a few of Biggie’s peers to get their fondest memories with Big Poppa."
