        "text": "LOS ANGELES - Mary J. Blige is ending her marriage to her husband-manager after nearly 13 years.\n\nCourt records show the \"Family Affair\" singer filed for divorce from Martin \"Kendu\" Isaacs on Tuesday in Los Angeles, citing irreconcilable differences. No additional details for the breakup were included in the filing.\n\nBlige and Isaacs were married in December 2003 and have no children together. The actress-singer has won nine Grammy Awards, including for her albums \"Growing Pains\" and \"The Breakthrough.\"\n\nThe singer is asking a court to deny Isaacs spousal support.\n\nA representative for the singer said Blige is saddened by the end of her marriage but will continue working on new music for an album slated to be released later this year.\n\nThe divorce was first reported Thursday by celebrity website TMZ."
