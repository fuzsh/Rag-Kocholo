Techtron® PPS (polyphenylene sulfide) products close the price and performance gaps between standard and advanced engineering thermoplastics. Our range of Techtron® materials offer the broadest resistance to chemicals of any advanced engineering plastic. They have no known solvents below 200 °C and offer inertness to steam, strong bases, fuels and acids. Minimal moisture absorption and a very low coefficient of linear thermal expansion, combined with stress relieving processes, make these PPS products ideally suited for precise tolerance machined components. In addition, PPS products exhibit excellent electrical characteristics and are inherently flame retardant. These materials are an excellent alternative to PEEK at lower temperatures. Techtron® PSGF Polyphenylene Sulfide PPS shapes are compression molded and glass filled, giving them extreme dimensional stability as well as improved chemical and corrosion resistance over unfilled PPS materials. Due to these improved performance characteristics, Techtron® PSGF is often chosen as a solution for applications involving critical sealing and structural components, such as pump housings, valves, and compressors within the oil and gas industry. Material Properties Compression molded, 40% glass-filled Improved dimensional stability over unfilled PPS Improved chemical and corrosion resistance Techtron® PSBG PPS compression molded shapes are internally lubricated and carbon fiber-reinforced, allowing them to exhibit excellent wear resistance, outstanding dimensional stability, and extreme chemical and corrosion resistance.
