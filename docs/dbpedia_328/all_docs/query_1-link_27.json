Click Here\n\nRefractometers From Rudolph Research All Feature:\n\nEasy to clean, shallow Sample well – A clean sample well is imperative to accurate measurements.\n\nDurable Sapphire Prisms with Long-life Light sources – Low Life of instrument cost.\n\n3 Year Domestic Warranty, Up to 3 International Warranty\n\nSales and local service located near your lab anywhere in the world.\n\nDecades of leading Analytical Instrument Design and Support.\n\nHigh Durability Sapphire Prism\n\nAll Rudolph Research J-Series instrument offer a sapphire prism for high mechanical and chemical durability. The sample well is acid resistant 316 stainless steel with a Techtron sealing ring. There is no lamp to change, the LED light source is guaranteed for 1,000,000 measurements.\n\nShallow Refractometer Sample Well – All Rudolph J-Series Models\n\nRefractometer measurement accuracy is only as reliable as the cleanliness of the sample well. Hard to clean sample wells can lead to inaccuracies due to residual from a prior measurement. Rudolph Research set out to dramatically minimize this problem by taking a new approach to sample well design. The Rudolph sample well is very shallow and smooth allowing easier cleaning and less surface area for contaminants to hide. Less sample is required and the well cleans easily. The result is more accurate measurements due to significantly less opportunity for sample contamination.\n\nRefractometer – Sample Temperature Control\n\nRudolph’s uniquely designed refractometer sample well and electronic heating and cooling system improves results. For many applications sample temperatures must be accurately controlled within the sample well. When an application requires highly controlled temperature, a temperature controlled presser will assure even and highly accurate temperature stability. A sample in the measurement well that is controlled from both the top and bottom affords the most accurate measurement at a required temperature.\n\nRefractometer Models – 10 Models with dozens of application specific options.\n\nRudolph understands your measurement applications and provides the needed instruments and configurations to meet your requirements. Application requirements may be dictated by regulatory agencies, quality control demands, or sample handling concerns. Refractometers may also be utilized in conjunction with other instruments for multiple measurements – load one sample to receive multiple measurement results. Sample delivery may also automated with or without other instruments for a complete Laboratory Automation solution designed to increase efficiency in your laboratory.\n\nLaboratory Refractometer – Model J457 – Our Most Advanced Model – For Very demanding Pharmaceutical, Analytical, and Chemical Labs.\n\nSmart Measure™ Improves Results with Live Measurement and Sample Load Well Monitoring.\n\nDual Electronic Temperature Control – Range 10ºC – 110ºC or 10ºC – 120ºC (optional)\n\nAccuracy: Refractive Index ±0.00002, BRIX ±0.01\n\nFully 21 CFR Part 11 Compliance and On-Board Data Storage\n\nWidest Measurement Range: Refractive Index 1.26 – 1.72, BRIX 0 – 100\n\nData Storage – 32GB non-removable Compact Flash – Or Fully Networkable\n\nRead more about the J457 Refractometer\n\nRefractometer – Model J457 NDR – Hospital Refractometer Ideal For Drug Dispensing Pharmacies\n\nIdeal for Hospitals in tracking Narcotics and Drug diversion\n\nStore pre and post operating room sample measurements in a database.\n\nSecure Log-in\n\nSecure Data backup\n\nRead more about the J457 NDR Refractometer\n\nRefractometer – Model J357 – Excellent for Pharmaceutical, Chemical, Petroleum, Essential Oils, Fragrance, Cosmetic Laboratories.\n\nDual Electronic Temperature Control – Range 15ºC – 100ºC or 10ºC – 120ºC (optional)\n\nAccuracy: ±0.00004 RI, ±0.03 BRIX\n\nHigh Durability Sapphire Prism\n\nData Storage: Removable media card or upload via RS 232 to LIMS systems\n\nRead more about the J357 Refractometer\n\nWide Range Refractometer – Model J257 – High Accuracy – Wide Range for Polymer, Petroleum, Chemical, Pharmaceutical, Essential Oil Laboratories.\n\nWide refractive index range of 1.26-1.72 measures beyond instruments with only a food refractive index range of 1.33-1.53\n\nMeasures aromatic essential oils, fluorocarbon solvents, and all known materials.\n\nLarge, easy to read, 7.5cm x 10cm cold cathode fluorescent back lit, digital LCD Screen\n\nRead more about the J257 Refractometer\n\nDigital Refractometer – Model J157 and J157-633 – High Accuracy for Food, Beverage, Water Based Chemicals, & Sugar Industries.\n\nMeasures to ±0.00002 RI / ±0.01 BRIX making it more accurate and reproducible than 4 decimal place wide range chemical refractometers.\n\nDual Electronic temperature control from the top and bottom of the sample well.\n\nLarge range of standard and customized scales are available.\n\nLarge, easy to read, 7.5cm x 10cm cold cathode fluorescent back lit, digital LCD Screen\n\nJ157-633 operates at 633nm for OWLS system Bio-technical and Bio-engineering labs.\n\nRead more about the J157 Refractometer\n\nRefractometer – Models J57HA, J57WR, J57TPN Refractometer Heavy Use, High Accuracy, QC.\n\nWide Measurement Range for the Chemical Industry.\n\nHigh Accuracy\n\nJ57WR offers an wide Refractive Index (RI) measurement range from 1.26 – 1.70\n\nRead more about the J57 Refractometer\n\nRefractometer – Model J47, When QC Counts, Ideal for Food and Beverage\n\nPrecision lab refractometer with traceable calibration.\n\nStores measurement electronically.\n\nOn-board temperature correction tables for sugar and water based samples.\n\nRead more about the J47 Refractometer\n\nExcellent for QC when Quality is truly important in the Food and Beverage product industry.\n\nAll Rudolph Instruments carry our exclusive 20 Commitment to service your instrument."
