        "text": "put in tank and fill it up..\n\nto mix it up well.\n\nI use the 22 gal treatment bottle.\n\nYou can use it anytime.... but for sanity- I usually do it 1 tank before an oil change....\n\nTheres the discussion of the DI engines not getting techron on the top of the valves.... But from what Ive read-- theres a service procedure that calls for its use right after a dealer services a car for carbon buildup on the valves... to help get rid of what may be left--- so it does something....\n\nAnyways-- theres plenty of discussion of that on other threads....\n\nBut its good for cleaning your fuel level sender from sulfur buildup....(erratic fuel gauges)\n\ncleaning the fuel system, fuel injectors etc etc.\n\nIts good to use in my opinion....\n\nI'm sort of on the fence about Techron in general, but not really in any negative way; please let me \"splain\":\n\nFirst, I like it and use it occasionally, as I figure it can't really hurt in most any event. When I use it, I only use it as specified; poured into a full tank. I don't view it as some radically extreme cleaner that will do some sort of lubricant-stripping harm. I personally doubt whether it really could cause harm via blow-by or whatever, so don't necessarily 'time' it to do so in the tank just before an oil change. I'm not 'knocking' that, just don't see how it could cause much if any harm in any event, outside of the zealous extremists who think that \"more is better\" and want to try to dump it into a nearly empty tank.\n\nYes, it's supposed to be included in \"all grades of Chevron gas\", per Chevron. Right or wrong, what my trusted mechanic of 40+ years in direct industry service, along with high level automotive instruction, claims is that Techron or its equivalent is supposed to be in most all other top tier gas brands too. So that's where some of my fence-sitting originates and now you know why I'm not too concerned about the frequency of use, etc."
