        "text": "BioDot as your âIntel Insideâ\n\nWeâve all heard the saying, âIntel Inside.â The Intel Corporation started the âIntel Insideâ marketing campaign in 1991, and it still holds power today. That logo communicated to the customer that the Intel brand of microprocessors were the âbrainsâ of the personal computer you were buying. This type of marketing is referred to as Ingredient Branding.\n\nSeveral other companies have since followed the same advertising strategy â NutraSweetÂ® with Diet Pepsi; Gore-TexÂ® with The North Face outerwear; MicrobanÂ® for antimicrobial surfaces; TechronÂ® with Chevron gasoline. The list can go on. The key to a successful Ingredient Brand strategy is combining quality and well-known technology to add value to your end-user product. The quality makes the difference.\n\nSpeaking of quality and technology, let me introduce you to BioDot. BioDot was founded in 1994 to meet the growing demands in the medical diagnostic test manufacturing space for automated ultra-low volume, precision, non-contact dispensing. This is where BioDot's Discrete Droplet Dispensingâ¢ technology was born and nearly 30 years and 25+ patents later has generated the industry standard liquid dispense instrumentation for lateral flow diagnostic test strip manufacturing.\n\nThe fundamental core of BioDotâs patented dispense technology is how we perform dispense droplet formation. Our Discrete Droplet Dispensingâ¢ technology allows you to tune your instrument to dispense an exact desired volume as an individual droplet. For example, if 100nL was the volume of interest, we would not dispense 5 drops of 20nLs each to \"build\" a 100nL droplet, we would dispense a single drop of exactly 100nL. Now you might be thinking to yourself, \"But 100nL is 100nL whether it's made from 1 discrete 100nL drop or 5 20nL droplets.\" Of course, but what if an assay optimally performs with a 90nL volume of reagent instead? If a dispenser can only build droplets in increments of 20nL you'll have to settle for 80nL or 100nL total dispense volume.\n\nIs that level of inaccuracy acceptable for a successful test reaction? Maybe. Maybe not. But wouldnât you rather hit 90nL on the money regardless? That's why having the ability to tune a discrete droplet to a precise volume is a critical functionality for test optimization. On top of improved accuracy, dispensing a target volume as a single droplet instead of multiple droplets is often faster as well. While speed and accuracy are often in direct opposition to one another, it's a special feat when a single technology can optimize both simultaneously.\n\nNow as useful as the ability to dispense discrete single droplets across the nanoliter range is, some applications demand even lower volumes. For that reason, weâve developed Discrete Droplet Dispensingâ¢ technology to cover the picoliter volume range too. In fact, BioDot's Rainmakerâ¢ Dispensers can create droplets as small as 25pL. For comparison, the lower size limit of an object that can be seen by the naked human eye is ~40Âµm (microns) in diameter while a 25pL liquid droplet is ~36Âµm across. In other words, the Rainmaker dispenser can dispense liquid droplets so small theyâre only visible under a microscope\n\nAs I briefly touched upon earlier, our core business has long been in the diagnostics manufacturing industry, developing, selling, and supporting our dispensing technologies. BioDotâs branded XYZ motion platforms have been used in diagnostic production facilities for applications ranging from lateral flow to biochips and biosensors. Our products are at the core of billions of diagnostics tests for infectious diseases like COVID-19, HIV, and the ever-growing demand for glucose monitoring test strips. In addition\n\nto supporting leading diagnostic manufacturing partners, we have disrupted the Cytogenetics life sciences by offering an automated solution for FISH (Fluorescent-In-Situ-Hybridization) and karyotyping (KT). Our CellWriterâ¢S platform miniaturizes the process, reducing laboratory needs for expensive probe by 10-fold to 20-fold. Decreased probe use saves clinical diagnostic labs upwards of $100,000/year.\n\nMost recently, BioDot has entered the general life sciences space. This should come as no surprise, given that reagent and sample volumes for assays in the sciences are miniaturizing. As the volumes fall below 1ÂµL, traditional liquid handling companies like Tecan, Hamilton, Agilent, and Eppendorf struggle to dispense without sacrificing quality.\n\nFor applications like low volume PCR, micro-ELISA, Direct Titration, Protein Crystallography, Single-Cell Proteomics/Sequencing, Microarray/Plate Array, and more, non-contact, low volume dispensing is a growing trend (or should I say shrinking trend?) in the life sciences. Letâs look at an example for Low Volume PCR. If a total reaction volume is currently at 50ÂµL, it will use approximately 0.5ÂµL of Taq (DNA polymerase). If you want to reduce the total volume used 20ÂµL, you will also need to dispense 0.2ÂµL of Taq.\n\nA hand pipette instrument generally cannot dispense lower than 0.2ÂµL, and that requires some finesse from the technician. Now translate that skill to an automated liquid handler, where there is no technician tilting the tube to ensure the dispense is made in the desired location and at the designated volume. A somewhat difficult, but doable step in a manual PCR workflow would be a significant struggle for traditional liquid handling robotics that canât reliably pipette much below 1uL. For BioDot dispensing 0.2ÂµL is a cake walk.\n\nThis is where BioDotâs core competency of dispensing small volumes is so useful. We initially started by focusing on small volumes in the diagnostics manufacturing sphere because life science applications didnât need ultra-low volume dispensing at the time. That need is now here and growing exponentially. As life science applications miniaturize, sub 1uL dispensing technology must be incorporated as âpartâ of the overall scientific solution.\n\nNow that you know what BioDot can do letâs circle back to the initial concepts of âIngredient Brandingâ and âIntel Insideâ. When laboratory instrumentation companies are pushing the boundaries of automated life science application workflows, such as packing as many unique assay targets in the smallest microarray chip possible, isolating single cells for downstream genomic analysis, or simply miniaturizing an assay as much as possible to conserve costly reagents and samples they need a class leading integrated liquid dispenser that will reliably and quickly deliver highly accurate, discrete fluid droplets. They need the life science version of the âIntel Insideâ to be their small volume liquid dispensing engine. Or simply put, they need an Engine for Scienceâ¢. So regardless of whether your need is to dispense nL volumes, pL volumes, aqueous solutions, high viscosity fluids, biologics, small molecules, or single cells in suspension what better company to partner with than BioDot to provide your Engine for Scienceâ¢?\n\nAnd while a great engine is a must for a great vehicle you always need additional pieces to drive and ensure everything is working properly. So as we engage with you to understand your scientific needs, we can guide you through other challenges such as the verification of volumes. Because, after all, how would you verify a 25 picoliter dot, when itâs smaller than the naked eye can see? Or, what if there is a need for in-process drop verification? How about motion control for your dispense head with high precision positional resolution and vision for fiducial finding? What about dispensing software or training for your global support staff? With more than 6,000+ instruments installed globally and nearly 30 years of experience in automated Discrete Droplete Dispensingâ¢, BioDot has you covered to get the absolute best performance from your Engine for Scienceâ¢.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nDebbie has 26 years in supporting global Life Science customers through automation consultation, applications development and first in class customer care.
