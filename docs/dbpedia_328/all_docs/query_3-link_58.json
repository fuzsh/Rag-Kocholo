        "text": "If you’re searching for a plastic manufacturing company capable of processing materials that others might find challenging, your search ends here. Jaco Products excels in a range of services, including plastic stamping, die cutting, and plastic injection molding. As one of the top-quality plastic manufacturers in proximity, we specialize in 5-axis CNC plastic machining.\n\nWhether you require precision machining for materials like Delrin, Nylon, various thermoplastics, or thermal mold materials, we are well-equipped to meet your needs. Our capabilities extend to working with custom-fabricated materials, cut-size, stock, machined-to-print, and more. If you’re dealing with a unique mold design, tight tolerance specifications, or materials that are difficult to reproduce in bulk, our expertise in plastics manufacturing positions us as your ideal choice. Let us demonstrate why we stand out as a reliable partner for your plastic manufacturing requirements.\n\nJaco excels in working with “no quote” materials, tolerances, and configurations, setting us apart as one of the premier injection molding companies. While many injection molding companies might shy away from certain materials, we specialize in creating high-quality products and parts from challenging materials that others may not touch. Our plastic injection molding service accommodates a diverse range of materials, including polyamides, polyethylenes (HDPE), and polycarbonates. What truly distinguishes us is our unique capability to work with high-temperature materials such as Ultem and Polysulfone.\n\nInjection molding involves feeding molten material into a mold, allowing it to cool and harden, forming the desired shape. For our plastic injection molding services, we collaborate with trusted plastics material suppliers to meet our customers’ specifications, adhering to best practices established by the Society of Plastic Industry (SPI).\n\nIf precise tolerances are crucial or if you’re struggling to find a company willing to work with your specific substrate, we stand out as one of the best plastic injection molding companies to consider.\n\nJaco excels in CNC machining of plastic, leveraging a 5-axis CNC machine in our facility. This multi-axis machining process involves tools moving in different directions simultaneously to shape the desired product. Over the years, we have mastered CNC plastic machining, assuring our customers that we will meet precision tolerances of .0001″.\n\nSeveral distinctive capabilities set Jaco apart as a plastics machining company:\n\nAdvanced Quality Control: Our quality control processes go above and beyond industry standards, ensuring the highest level of precision and consistency.\n\nFull-Service Machining: We offer comprehensive machining services, covering the entire process from development to the final product.\n\nAdvanced CNC Plastic Machining: Our capabilities in CNC plastic machining are advanced and cater to diverse needs.\n\nWe specialize in machining various substrates, including but not limited to:\n\nDelrin\n\nNylon\n\nHDPE\n\nPEEK\n\nTeflon\n\nIn addition to our machining capabilities, we offer support for prototyping and research, ensuring that machined plastic components and parts are built to precise specifications.\n\nJaco specializes in the manufacturing of thermal insulation, recognizing the critical role that the proper grade of insulated molding plays in mold making processes. Optimal mold performance is essential, especially in injection molding machinery where some parts of the machine may be colder than others.\n\nIn injection molding, heat naturally moves towards cooler areas, potentially affecting the efficiency of the process. Mold insulation, a specialized form of industrial thermal insulation, is crucial in preventing the transfer of heat from the mold to the cooler product, which could otherwise elongate the finalization of the part or component.\n\nThe performance of thermal insulation boards is evaluated based on their ability to provide thermal resistance. The specific application dictates the required tolerance, material, and conductivity levels for the insulation plates. Jaco has the capability to manufacture thermal insulation sheets from a diverse range of materials, tailoring them to meet precise specifications. Additionally, we can produce high-temperature insulation boards suitable for applications requiring fire resistance.\n\nWhat is Ultem: Understanding Ultem Material and Plastic\n\nWhat is Ultem? Ultem is a high-performance thermoplastic material known\n\nBy |August 8th, 2024|Categories: Plastic Fabrication|\n\nHow The Right Polycarbonate Sheet Guarantees Security.\n\nWhen to Use Polycarbonate Sheet | Lexan®| Acrylic | Plexiglass® | for Machining and Fabrication Polycarbonate sheets (Lexan) or acrylic (Plexiglass®) can have a wide range of applications in both industrial and residential applications. This article is a guide to when to choose one over the other for a specific application at use.\n\nBy |July 18th, 2024|Categories: News|\n\nPEEK Plastic | PEEK Machining Services, Molding, & Properties\n\nWhat Is PEEK Plastic? PEEK plastic, also known as polyetheretherketone, is ideal for components used in harsh environments that require excellent chemical resistance over a wide range of temperatures. PEEK is engineered resin designed to perform well applications that require and hydrolysis resistance while maintaining stiffness with PEEK temperature limits up to 170°C / 338°F.\n\nBy |July 18th, 2024|Categories: News|"
