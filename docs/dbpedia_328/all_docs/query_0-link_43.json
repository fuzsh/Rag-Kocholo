        "text": "High-performance PEI, PEEK, PTFE, PPS, electrostatic dissipative plastics, and more\n\nThis suite of engineering-grade plastics gives you the opportunity to find and test the best material solutions for your unique application. Advanced engineering materials exhibit high mechanical strength and stiffness over an elevated temperature range, with predictable performance even in heat as high as 230°C (450°F).\n\nThese semi-finished thermoplastic products also exhibit excellent dimensional stability and creep resistance, superior electrical characteristics (including insulating and dielectric properties), and some of the broadest chemical resistance of all advanced engineering polymers. They are excellent candidates for applications with very specific demands – such as analytical instrumentation, medical devices, and semiconductor process equipment components. Our offering includes availability in plastic stock shapes, as well as Near Net Shapes."
