        "text": "Digital Refractometer – J157 PLUS available in several models and option configurations.\n\nThe Rudolph J157 Digital Refractometer offers high performance and a range of features to suit many demanding applications in laboratories and harsh industrial environments. Rudolph Research Analytical, working together with refractometer (Refraktometer) users from various countries and disciplines, has developed the J157 series of Digital Refractometers. The Rudolph J157 benchtop refractometer line combines the features, measurement range, and accuracy that meet the most demanding applications both in and out of the laboratory and shares many features with the Rudolph Research Refractometer Product Line.\n\nTrouble viewing this video? Click Here\n\nJ157 PLUS HA Digital Refractometer perfect for High Accuracy measurements in the Sugar, Food & Beverage Industry\n\nThe Rudolph J157HA Digital Refractometer offers High Accuracy of RI ±0.00002, BRIX ±0.01 with a measurement range of RI 1.32 – 1.53, BRIX 0 – 100. Most importantly, this makes the J157HA an excellent choice for quality control of food and beverage products.\n\nDigital Refractometer – J157 PLUS WR ideal for the Chemical Industry.\n\nWith a measurement range of RI 1.29 – 1.66 and BRIX 0 – 100 the Rudolph J157WR offer the versatility needed for Chemical plants where the chemicals are primarily non-water based. In addition, the J157WR offers accuracy of ±0.0001 RI and ±0.1 BRIX which is in excess of the accuracy required in most Chemical Plants.\n\nJ157-633 for Biotechnology and Bioengineering Research\n\nA Biotechnology and Bioengineering refractometer designed specifically for measuring materials in the Optical Waveguide Lightmode Spectroscopy (OWLS) system thus capable of measuring the effective refractive index of a thin layer above an Si(Ti)O2 waveguide surface. The Digital J157-633 has all of the same features as the standard J157 automatic refractometer but operates at 633nm instead of the standard 589nm. The J157-633 is part of the Rudolph Research Refractometer Product Line and shares many of the same features as our other refractometers.\n\nDigital Refractometer – Includes the Rudolph PLUS Option\n\nIf you like or your application require some of the features of our higher end models you may add the J157 Plus option to either the HA or WR models. The Plus option adds the Smart Measure™ and Trend Analysis features that aid you in loading samples quickly and accurately. Rather than just choosing from the ever expanding range of custom scales provided by Rudolph the plus option lets users make their own. Simply measure 2 or more known points and the J157 plus has the ability to do the rest.\n\nThe temperature Control range is expanded to 10-85ºC and the Rudolph CC Temperature Sample Cover is added making the J157HA or J157WR an even more versatile refractometer.\n\nDigital Refractometer Operation\n\nOperating the J157 PLUS is as simple as placing a sample on the prism, closing the cover and reading the answer – all in just a few seconds. There are no shadow lines to match and there is no eyepiece requiring any type of operator determination or manual adjustment as necessary with ABBE type refractometers. When the “measure when stable mode” is selected, the J157 automatically waits until the sample has been electronically heated or cooled to a predefined temperature before initiating a measurement.\n\nDual Electronic Temperature Control System\n\nUnlike other temperature controlled refractometers, the J157 PLUS has electronic temperature control from both above and below the sample.\n\nThe sample cover is controlled to the same temperature as the prism and, when lowered, is designed to provide a temperature controlled micro-environment that provides unrivaled temperature stability, fast measurement time and minimal evaporation. Depending on options, the sample cover can also be used to initiate an automatic measurement.\n\nOptional Sample Presser\n\nThe J157 PLUS digital refractometer is available with an optional Temperature Controlled Sample Presser that touches the sample. Compared with the standard temperature controlled cover, the optional presser reduces the empty volume of the measurement area thereby greatly reducing evaporation and at the same time helping to evenly spread many types of materials including semi solids, and pastes over the measurement prism. This feature offers improved measurement performance on many samples.\n\nMore about Rudolph Refractometer Sample Cover Options\n\nDigital Refractometer Auto Measure Option\n\nThe Rudolph Auto Measure Option allows the closing and opening of the presser to start and end a measurement. The operator just closes the cover to start measuring and lifts the cover to stop measuring. The closing and lifting of the lid functions as the start/stop in the measurement process without ever touching the measure button.\n\nEasy to Clean Digital Refractometer Sample Well\n\nNo matter how great the refractometer is, accurate results will only be obtained if the prism is clean. All Rudolph J Series refractometers offer a flat, easy to clean prism that makes the cleaning process between measurements simple, even with sticky samples.\n\nUser Defined Scales\n\nThe J157 PLUS digital refractometer can be supplied with a large range of standard and customized scales. Scales can be customized in a few minutes. Simply enter 2, 6 or 10 points of concentration vs. corresponding RI data. The instrument calculates the custom scale automatically.\n\nDigital Refractometer Calibration\n\nThe J157 PLUS Digital Refractometer offers 1 point, 2 point or a full multi-point calibration. Calibration can be done at 20°C, 25°C or any user selectable temperature within the available range. Regardless of how many times the refractometer has been calibrated, it can always be restored to the initial factory calibration if required.\n\nUser Configurable\n\nVersatile laboratory instruments have the advantage of being able to display significant amounts of information. However this versatility can also lead to confusion, with extra buttons and by forcing operators to interpret extra results. These extra results that have no relevance to their application. Above all, the Rudolph J Series customizable display allows the refractometer to be configured to exactly what is required for each application.\n\nThe customizable digital keypad can be “locked out” or just a few keys can be operable. For example, the measure key, print key, zero key, customer specified sample keys or any combination thereof. In addition, the lockout function, calibration and other functions are all password protected.\n\nHigh Durability Sapphire Prism\n\nThe J series refractometers offer a sapphire prism for high mechanical and chemical durability. The sample well is made of acid resistant 316 stainless steel with a Techtron sealing ring. Most importantly, there is no lamp to change, the LED light source is guaranteed for 1,000,000 measurements.\n\nDigital Refractometer – Three Displays Allow For Three Interface Solutions\n\nRudolph allows the lab manager to select from different display options. We understand laboratories and manufacturing floors have different needs when it comes to the information required for monitoring a process. Your instrument’s interface can be customized to meet the information your application and environment demand. You can choose our full featured interface or our Load-and-Go™ display interface. The J157 PLUS Digital Refractometer Series offer laboratory flexibility with industrial strength. Thus, this makes this model series at home on the laboratory bench or on the factory floor.\n\nIn a modern factory, the most precious commodity is time. When a process starts to move outside its limits people want to know FAST. They want to correct the problem, preferably while it’s still small and before a product goes out of specification. The Rudolph live reading and Trend Analysis™ feature allows users to easily and quickly see how a process is going. In addition, catching minor deviations before they become major ones. Even in the most tightly controlled manufacturing environments, things do occasionally go out of specification.\n\nWhen an out of specification condition happens, material has to be quickly identified. In addition, decisions need to be made as to what to do with the product. Long term data collection is a part of any good process. Knowing when and where the out of specification condition happened is equally as important. Most importantly, Rudolph Trend Analysis™ software quickly shows a supervisor the process history and where the problem occurred.\n\nSimple Yet Flexible\n\nOperating the J157 PLUS Digital Refractometer is simple. Simply place a sample on the prism, close the presser and read the answer. This can be done in a few short seconds. The entire keypad can be “locked out” or just a few keys can be operable. For example, the measure key, print key, zero key, customer specified sample keys or any combination thereof. In addition, the lockout function, like calibration and other functions are all password protected.\n\nRefractometer Options and Accessories\n\nCalibration liquids from 1.33 – 1.70 (available with 4 decimal & 5 decimal accuracy).\n\nContinuous Flow and Pour-ln Style Pressers allow samples to be continuously monitored or poured directly from a beaker. The J157 PLUS Digital Refractometer standard presser is easily removable with a captured hinge pin and replaced with a Pour-In presser. As shown at right or a Continuous Flow presser with an inlet and outlet port.\n\nIn all cases, volume required for measurement is less than 5ml.
