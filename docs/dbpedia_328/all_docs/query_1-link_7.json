        "text": "Why aren't there more CEO's who come from a HR background? When compared to those from CFO, COO, CMO and GC backgrounds HR is bottom-dog when it comes to making the leap to CEO. The (legacy) data on this is pretty bleak for CPO's looking to elevate themselves in the corporate value chain; üîπ2018 - The Harvard Business Review reported that only 3% of Fortune 100 CEOs had a background in HR. üîπ 2019 - Spencer Stuart reported that fewer than 2% of CEOs in S&P 500 companies came from HR backgrounds üîπ 2021 - a study by the University of South Carolina's Darla Moore School of Business reported that only 3% of Fortune 500 CEOs had a background in human resources. I'd imagine that the stats have moved on a little in recent years with the scope of the Chief People Officer role broadening, and an ever increasing demand for CPO's with cross-functional leadership backgrounds, but there is still someway to go to catch-up with the ExCo peer group. According to ISS ESG data, the share of directorship roles across companies in the S&P 1500 with specific HR skills increased from 11.3% in 2020 to 19.4% in 2023. While not CEOs, this shows HR leaders are gaining more board representation.... albeit bloody slowly. Is it just an image problem or something fundamental which inhibits this move?\n\nHappy at work?
