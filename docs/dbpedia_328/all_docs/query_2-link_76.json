They use recycled plastic and wood to produce decking that looks stunningly similar to natural wood, but stands up infinitely better to life outdoors. ⁠ 2. Frequent weatherproofing, maintenance, repairs, and replacement required to keep wood decks safe and attractive isn't required here, saving homeowners time and money. ⁠ 3. TimberTech also helps to keep trees in the ground and decking out of landfills by building highly durable composite decking that lasts anywhere from two to five times as long as natural wood decking. ⁠ ⁠ What's not to love?

If the weather continues to cooperate it looks like this will be our last week without grass. Irrigation and gutters going in this week, final grade and then sod Tuesday or Wednesday! Can. Not. Wait. The lakeshore landscaping is a much more complex process with the required permitting and design process, but we know it is going to be worth the wait! In the meantime, between guests we will be working on adding a bocce court, Gaga ball pit, disc golf and more. #workinprogress #airbnb #newvacationrental #vrbo #minnesotacabin #airbnbwisconsin #airbnbminnesota #greatoutdoors #landscaping #timbertechdeck #timbertech\n\nOutdoor Living Reimagined with Potomac Outdoor Living. 🌟 With a backyard like this, you'll never want to leave home. 😍 Potomac Outdoor Living is the leading design + build company in the Montgomery County area, specializing in TimberTech decking, custom pools, hardscapes, and more!

There are two costs to consider — your building costs and your longterm costs. Though composite decking may cost more up front, the maintenance costs of wood often cost you even more over the life of your deck. For long-term savings, opting for low-maintenance decking from timbertech can be a game-changer!
