        "text": "PFAS stands for per- and fluoroalkyl substances and refers to a large class of synthetic chemicals that contain at least one fully fluorinated methyl (CF3-) or methylene (-CF2-) carbon atom (without any attached H/Cl/Br/I).\n\nDue to the extremely strong chemical bond between carbon and fluorine in PFAS chemicals, these substances resist degradation to an extreme degree. Their persistent characteristics, combined with their water solubility, make PFAS difficult to contain and dispose of, resulting in high levels of PFAS in soil as well as in surface, ground, and drinking water around the world. PFAS are sometimes referred to as “eternity chemicals,” as there is currently no efficient or cost-effective method for removing accumulated PFAS from the environment. Though not the case for all chemicals in this class, some PFAS have shown to be toxic to human health as well as the environment.\n\nThe ECHA proposal from February 7, 2023 aims to restrict the manufacture and use of PFAS chemicals in order to slow pollution from these substances and prevent their further accumulation in the environment. A full list of the now more than 10,000 substances subject to impending restriction is available on the ECHA website.\n\nDue to the unique property profile of fluoroplastics, there is no single polymer with a PFAS-free composition that might replace it in every application. If you are looking to replace a PTFE- or PVDF-containing material, we recommend starting with a detailed analysis of the thermal, chemical, and mechanical requirements of your application. Furthermore, it should be noted that replacing the material of a part often results in the need to change its design as well.\n\nBecause we offer the market's broadest range of engineering plastic shapes, Mitsubishi Chemical - Advanced Materials Division is in a unique position to help you navigate the transition away from fluoropolymers. Beyond our portfolio of hundreds of materials with a PFAS-free composition spanning diverse performance profiles, our technical services department is available to assist you with material selection, design considerations, and processing options."
