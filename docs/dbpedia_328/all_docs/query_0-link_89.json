        "text": "The relationship between research productivity and economic growth is the subject of information science which deals in this study to examine the impact of number of publications, research & development (RD while there is bidirectional causality between real economic growth and number of publication, in United States, Italy, Spain, Australia, India, Netherlands, Brazil, Switzerland, Taiwan, and Poland. Similarly, there is two-way causal relationship between real economic growth and R&D expenditures in USA, China, UK, Japan, India, Switzerland, Taiwan, Sweden, and Turkey. Finally, there is evident of feedback hypothesis between real economic growth and researchers involved in R&D activities in the USA, UK, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. The direction of causality is crucial because it has significantly policy implications for economic development.\n\nThe correlation between GDP and research publications is an important issue in scientometrics. This article provides further empirical evidence connecting revealed comparative advantage in national research with effects on economic output. Using quantitative time series analysis, this study attempts to determine the nature of causal relationships between research output and economic growth. One empirical result is that there is mutual causality between research and economic growth in Asia, whereas in Western countries the causality is much less clear. The results may be of use to underdeveloped nations deciding how to direct their investment: toward education, infrastructure and engineering, or more toward fundamental science."
