        "text": "Dimensional stability is a measure of a material’s ability to retain its fit, form, and functional properties throughout its lifecycle.\n\nEngineering plastics are subject to a myriad of extreme conditions – from machining of parts to intense operating environments – that can impact how well both the material and the overall part function throughout their lifecycles. The material property that is most often affected by a lack of dimensional stability are the dimensions of the finished part, as excessive moisture or extreme temperature environments can cause materials to expand or contract.\n\nEven if a part will not be exposed to particularly demanding operating conditions, it is still important to consider the dimensional stability of a material when machining the part to close tolerances – a process that subjects a material to high levels of mechanical stress.\n\nIn order to ensure performance and safe operation throughout a part’s lifetime, a plastic material’s dimensional stability is one of the key performance properties that must be taken into consideration during both material selection and part design. Mitsubishi Chemical group offers a comprehensive portfolio of engineering polymers covering an array of dimensional stability needs.\n\nThere are many engineering applications in which the dimensional stability of the materials involved must be considered. Sealing components are an example of parts requiring dimensionally stable materials, as changes to the dimensions of the seal could result in leakage. Dimensional stability should also be a consideration in choosing a material for parts that will be subject to regular cleaning with steam, chemicals, or hot liquid.\n\nBeyond the final application of the part, the dimensional stability of a material impacts machining and the final tolerances that can be acheived. With less dimensionally stable polymers, the build-up of heat during machining and internal stress in the underlying shape may make it difficult to consistently machine parts involving precise dimensions with tight tolerances. Sophisticated processing and state-of-the-art machining technology, along with polymers exhibiting superior dimensional stability, make it possible to machine intricate parts with small scales and tight tolerances, such as electrical connectors and test sockets."
