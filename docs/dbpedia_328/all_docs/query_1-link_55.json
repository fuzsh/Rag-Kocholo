Florov\n\nMany different systems for drip irrigation are used in the modern agriculture. Their main advantages are that they permit the economical usage of water (up to 50% reduction in the quantity of water used), the automation of the irrigation processes and the ability to make local water irrigation in steep terrain. Two systems are widely used in Bulgaria. They are made of high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene and polypropilene. The 'Agrodrip' system finds usage in the irrigation of vegetables and flowers (both in greenhouses and in the open fields). The system combines an inner corrugate pipe with an outer smooth pipe which are perforated at certain points.\n\nA system, which combines smooth polyethylene pipe and 'labyrinth' type KP-4.6 drippers, is used for the drip irrigation of orchards and vineyards. The technical characteristics of these systems manufactured by the Institute of Land Reclamation and Agricultural Mechanization, the possibilities of their usage in the irrigation of various crops, the main principles for the choice of such installations and the economic effectiveness of such systems are viewed in the following development.\n\nKeywords: agriculture, drip irrigation, equipment, polymers, pipes, drippers.\n\nHIGH ENERGY RADIATION RESISTANCE OF ADVANCED ENGINEERING PLASTIC PRODUCTS\n\nM. Natov, N. Cholakova*\n\nThe highest achievement of the polymer chemistry are the advanced engineering plastic products.\n\nTheir physico-mechanical, thermal and electrical properties and their chemical resistance in different surroundings together with resistance against high-energy radiation make them exclusively important for the development of many different industrial branches.\n\nThe advanced engineering plastic products of Quadrant Engineering Plastic Products-Belgium such as Ketron PEEK, Torlon, Techtron, Celazole, Cestidur, Borolene have excellent resistance against high- energy radiation. They find their application in nuclear industry- in cyclotrons, valves and other machined parts in nuclear power stations; in textile industry - in spinning process where X-rays for contolling some parameters of the raw material and produced fibres are used; in medical industry- in UV-sterilizators, etc.; in chemical industry - for process controlling; in electronic industry - for different parts and also in many other industrial branches.\n\nThe presence of the above products on Bulgarian market makes possible their introduction in the equivalent branches in our industry.\n\nThe knowledge and information about EPP of our technically competent persons such as engineers and technicians, mechanics and constructors will result in modernization and eco-protection in processes and apparats in all fields where problems are available.\n\nKeywords: high-energy radiation, engineering plastic products, X-rays\n\nALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR DESTRUCTION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS\n\nM. Haralampiev\n\nAlternative destruction technologies for the chemical weapons have long been promoted by many groups of people in the USA though the USA army has decided to use incineration as their basic technology to destroy the huge chemical weapons stockpiles across the States. Actually there are a few sites in the USA where there has already been successfully tested with different alternatives and several new plants are being built based on alternative technologies. The agent release (happened in May 2000) in TOCDF, Tooele, Utah caused disturbances among the citizens living nearby. A hot debate emerged also around the other sites in the USA where the same incineration technology of CW destruction will be used (e.g Anniston, Alabama). To seek an alternative technology rather than incineration has long been preferred by many groups. Therefore it provided a good case for the opposition to incineration. The TOCDF has been shut down for a few months since its agent release.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to compare the alternative technologies with the incineration (which is also called baseline technology). It will cover the following: a) the principles of these alternatives; b) the possible applications; c) advantages and disadvantages.\n\nIt will be worthwhile to say, though, this paper is not comprehensive. The major sources of this paper are open publications, Internet access.\n\nKeywords: chemical weapons, destruction, neutralization, alternative technologies.\n\nON SOME MILESTONES IN THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF RUBBER\n\nN. Dishovsky\n\nThe most important milestones in the development of the rubber science and technology during the last 270 years have been considered and discussed.\n\nKeywords: rubber, vulcanization, network formation, reversible rubber elasticity, theory of branching processes\n\nA REVIEW ON THE VISCOSITY ADDITIVES IN MOTOR OILS\n\nS.
