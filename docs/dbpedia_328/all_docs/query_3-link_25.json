There really is little\n\npoint in adding more aromatics to the gasoline - the Clean Air Act\n\nreduced aromatics from about 30-35% to 25% maximum, and so there is\n\nalready plenty in gasoline. It is useful (undiluted) for dissolving gums\n\nand some fuel system deposits during cleaning and tar spots on paint.\n\nAs there is about 25% of aromatics ( mainly toluene, ethyl benzene,\n\northo/meta/para xylenes) in the gasoline, you would have to add large\n\namounts to obtain a significant cleaning effect, and consequently\n\nmove into the adverse effect on elastomers/combustion levels.\n\n>On 1 Oct 1994, FRED W.

Although the Clean Air Act\n\nwas intended to reduce aromatics for smog reasons ( aromatics and\n\nolefins in exhaust emissions are major contributers to ozone formation )\n\nthe reduction in benzene emissions is another major health plus.\n\nThe aromatics and olefins are a very convenient source of octane,\n\nbut their adverse environmental effects means they are on the\n\nway down.

While methanol produce far fewer species in the exhaust,\n\nthe soup from hydrocarbon fuels sometimes results in fewer simple toxic\n\nproducts because they react in the exhaust. The toxics from methanol\n\nare just as hard to control. Remember that in the US the \"methanol\"\n\nfuel is actually 15% HCs ( for ease of starting, safety etc ), so you have\n\nsome of each. The problem with methanol remains the cold start\n\nemissions ( as it is with HC fuels ), which can have 5-10X the amount\n\nof formaldehyde than cold start HC fuels. That's why so many people\n\nare working on cold start options ( from traps to fast light-up cats ).\n\nUntil the lean-burn cat ( as Mazda has ) is available both methanol\n\nand HC fuels have emissions problems, and even then the cold-start\n\nand evaporative emissions ( new gasolines will have lower volatility )\n\nissues will have to be addressed.\n\nBruce Hamilton\n\n[Snip]]\n\n>195 * .55 = 107.25 / 10 / 2.54 = 4.22 inches\n\n>\n\n>now the tire height is approximately 4.22 * 2 + 15 = 23.44 in\n\n>\n\n>a 205/50R15 would have a height of 23.07 in\n\n>\n\n>The 205/55R15 might work but the speedo would be off by a bit.

I've seen variations of up to 1/2 inch between\n\ntires of differing brands. As for the speedo error, at 55 mph, the\n\nspeedo would read 54.13 mph (a error of -1.6%).

I think I buy the argument too,\n\nespecially given the fact that I am unlikely to be able to go with a\n\nmuch bigger tire.

I will be referencing the 1994 Yearbook from the Tire and Rim\n\nAssociation (TRA). TRA sets industry standards for tire and wheel\n\nmanufacturers. They refer to the first number of a tire size designation\n\nas the 'Tire Design Section Width'. They define it as the \"width of a new\n\ntire, including 24-hour inflation growth and including normal sidewalls, but\n\nnot including protective side ribs, bars, or decorations.\" BTW standard\n\nload tires are inflated to 26 psi for this measurement. The measurement is\n\ndone using a standard width rim assigned to each tire size. It is rounded\n\nof to the nearest 10mm, but on a 5 digit, not a zero.\n\nHope this clears this up and puts an end to this thread.\n\nMark Kiesow\n\nChassis Design Engineer\n\n>>Hmmmm.

Approx 9\"...(25mm = 1inch)...\n\nThe only reasons a tire of a \"higher\" aspect ratio would have a\n\nsmaller patch are:\n\nThe rim is several inches smaller than the tire, thus pulling\n\nthe outer edges of the tread in (and down) toward the\n\nrim. You can overcome this by lowering the tire\n\npressure, or getting larger (wider) rims.\n\nOr the tire pressures are WAY TOO HIGH...\n\nIf you compare a 225/50/15 on a 10\" rim,\n\nand a 225/75/15 on a 10\" rim...\n\nThey WILL be the same width...\n\nLATER!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWreasirX-- | Targeting America... |\n\n\"Watch For Him; But Don't Blink!\" | |\n\nSamir A.
