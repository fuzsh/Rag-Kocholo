Our charges are based on hours spent on your project irrespective of whether the task is completed or not. It is always possible that any task may go unaccomplished due to various reasons like Service limitations, this is however less likely as our developers are a team of highly experienced professionals who has vast experience in the domain that they work on. We recommend our clients prepare a process document that describes the whole process flow in great detail along with a flow chart in order to avoid further confusion in estimating the projected hours hence we can estimate the correct hours so we can finish the project with no further confusion. We render our services to the best of our capabilities and try our best to accomplish what our Clients look to achieve, however, it is often possible that we are left helpless in achieving certain tasks due to limitations in the software that we deal with. In such a scenario, we come up with the best alternative workaround or recommendations as per industry standards. We always strive to hire the best expertise in the industry and try our best to accomplish what our Clients look to achieve, however, the same cannot be taken for granted. Any requests that are not part of the original approved plan (list of Tasks) would be considered change requests or new requests and would be billed extra for the extra efforts that we will be taking irrespective of whether it is a mandatory instance or a feature based on your process requirements. In order to avoid such a scenario, we advise our customers to make sure they receive and approve a copy of the original project plan before accepting any proposal and going ahead with the proposed implementation. This is to avoid any future complications.\n\n​\n\nTo be more precise, our charges are solely for the efforts that we spend on your requirement and should not be considered as a guarantee in fulfilling your requirement.\n\n​\n\nOur priority has always been to serve in the best interest of our customers and b we always advise our customers to stay aware of the complexities involved in any implementation/ system integration process in order to avoid any future conflict of interest.\n\n​\n\nOur Developers are highly skilled professionals and It is possible that our developers are always not in line with what our customer's requirements are and this affects the outcome of the project. In such scenarios, customers should ensure that the developer has understood their requirement and are completely in line with the developer. In case of any such event of miscommunication, the customer should fully compensate Techtron Services for the time & effort our developers will be putting into finding a perfect solution for you. In such scenarios, we always suggest you make the best use of the initial consultation and ask our consultants/developers to listen to your requirement patiently and also give them back a patient hearing of what solution they have for you.\n\n​\n\nOur developers are experts in referring to tutorials and going thru documentation that is necessary that may involve third-party integrations and you understand that we put in our efforts in doing the same and any such efforts must be compensated by our clients irrespective of whether the goal is achieved or not.\n\n​\n\nClients are expected to document their own workflow and have the same check for feasibility with us before agreeing to work together on a project.\n\n​\n\nWe will be responsible only for the task that will be shared with you and any extra task would be charged extra based on the efforts required\n\nYou should have a clear idea of all the tasks that will be carried out and please ask for detailed documentation.\n\nYou are advised not to rely on assumptions and be clear about the deliverables.\n\n​\n\nWe will be providing you services within the limitations of our skillset.
