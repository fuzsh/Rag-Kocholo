        "text": "We reported last week that Stellantis might shed some brands that aren't making money.\n\nNaturally, Maserati's sales and revenue reports came in and the numbers fell short of expectations.\n\nSo it follows that Maserati could be on the chopping block.\n\nMaserati sold only 6,500 cars between January and June of this year, as opposed to 15,300 units in the same time frame last year. If my math is correct, that's about a 57 percent decline.\n\nThe company also had an adjusted operating loss of about $88.7 million through that span, as opposed to a profit of about $130 million during the first six months of 2023.\n\nDisappointing numbers don't necessarily mean Stellantis will sell off Maserati, though it doesn't help that it will be a minute before new or redesigned models hit the market.\n\nSo, what does this mean? We don't have a crystal ball, nor do you, but you can, of course, speculate in the comments.\n\nSound off below.\n\n[Image: Maserati]\n\nBecome a TTAC insider.

Despite this, he wanted to pursue a career in sports writing but he ended up falling semi-accidentally into the automotive-journalism industry, first at Consumer Guide Automotive and later at Web2Carz.com. He also worked as an industry analyst at Mintel Group and freelanced for About.com, CarFax, Vehix.com, High Gear Media, Torque News, FutureCar.com, Cars.com, among others, and of course Vertical Scope sites such as AutoGuide.com, Off-Road.com, and HybridCars.com. He’s an urbanite and as such, doesn’t need a daily driver, but if he had one, it would be compact, sporty, and have a manual transmission.\n\nMore by Tim Healey"
