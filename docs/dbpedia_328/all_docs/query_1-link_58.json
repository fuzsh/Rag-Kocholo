        "text": "Notes\n\nThe atomic absorption spectrophotometer was invented by Alan Walsh, of the CSIRO Division of Chemical Physics, to determine the elemental content of a variety of solutions. The light source is selected to emit the spectrum of the metal being determined. The solution to be analysed is drawn up a capillary, converted to a fine spray, mixed with a combustible gas and burned in a long flame at a stainless steel burner. The light from the lamp travels through the flame, where it is absorbed to an extent dependent on the concentration of the metal in the solution; it then enters a monochrometer which has been set at the wavelength of the resonance line of the metal to be determined. It then falls onto a photomultiplier and is amplified by an AC amplifier, whose output is read on a meter. The instrument was designed and made by Techtron, Melbourne, under licence to CSIRO. Techtron was later taken over by Varian and still trades as Varian Techtron, making AAS and other spectrophotometers. Key organisations Varian Australia Pty Ltd : manufacture CSIRO Division of Chemical Physics : research and development Key people Alan Walsh : researcher, inventor John Willis : developed applications Further Reading 'Walsh and the atomic absorption spectrometer' John Willis Australian Science Mag, 1987 (3).\n\nNotes\n\nUniversity of New England Department of Physiology used the instrument to study the physiology of domestic ruminants from 1968 until 1981. Dr Alan Lloyd purchased the instrument in 1985 and established Soiltec at Coffs Harbour. This company, now run by Tim and Kylie Bennett at Alstonville, continued to use the instrument for soil analysis until 1995."
