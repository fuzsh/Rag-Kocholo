        "text": "Hi folks. I have this power amplifier that I would like to hook up to a function generator and send a 125 khz signal. I've been reading the doc's and I can't understand what exactly I need to do to communicate with it through the db9 port or maybe the front balanced input port. https://aetechron.com/IND-RESEARCH-7114.shtml#download\n\nHere is everything I can find on the device. My function generator will be a Digilent Discovery 2 that has 2 channel BNC out. Is it as simple as getting a bnc to db9 adapter and sending the wave normally or does more need to be done than that? Thank you for taking the time to look at this.\n\nDid you look at section 6 of the owners manual. It looks like everything you need is right there. There are a few pins that you would need to worry about. Mostly there are two pins that you need for controlling the min to max setting using 0-10VDC signal. This should be very easy to do. You would need something to control the signal voltage.\n\nTim\n\nGHSP\n\nYes, that seems to be what I need however, I'm not sure how to physically connect it as I have a bnc outputs on this Discovery 2, do I need a breakout cable? I believe this discovery 2 also can act as a power supply too.\n\nIs there a certain way within LabVIEW to communicate with certain pins of a serial port?\n\nI have this chart that tells me what I need to do, I just don't know how to automate it with LabVIEW or how to use my BNC probes with this port. Here is the diagram.\n\nI really appreciate any help with this.\n\nThe picture you attached is not a serial port. It might be a DB-9 connector which is the same connector that DB-9 serial ports have. But it is not a serial port because its pins don't match the RS-232 definition.\n\nWhat device or instrument is this port on?\n\nWhat BNC probes are you talking about?\n\nit says it is a control port. So if you want a computer with a LabVIEW program to control it, you'll probably need to get a data acquisition board with some analog and digital outputs that you would then wire to a DB-9 connector to plug into here according to that wiring diagram.\n\nThank you very much. I have an Analog Discovery 2 with a probe coming out of a BNC adaptor board that plugs into the Analog Discovery 2. I also have a LabJack U3-HV that can do analog and digital output. Might you know where I can find out how to wire that up to a db9 connector?\n\nThe 7114 has inputs called \"balanced\" and \"unbalanced\":\n\nhttps://aetechron.com/pdf/7114manual.pdf\n\nDo you know what they mean by those terms in this context? I'm guessing the balanced is a differential signal where the minus is the inverse of the plus, and the unbalanced is a single-ended signal? That would suggest to me you want to use the unbalanced and yes any sort of BNC breakout would be convenient:\n\nhttps://www.jameco.com/shop/keyword=Bnc-Breakout\n\nI am not clear on what type of signal you want to send to this BNC input on the 7114.\n\nYou mentioned a 125 kHz signal. Is this a square wave? Rectangular wave? What is the needed low voltage and the high voltage?\n\nI'm not sure if this applies to the BNC input, but the manual it says signal input type is AC, level when asserted 10V and level when reasserted 0V. Confusing. Does the 10V mean a 10 Vrms sine wave centered around 0 volts?\n\nI had a talk with Jacob at Techron and he said it's okay to just send a continuous 125khz sine wave just normal through the unbalanced bnc in the front of the box. I don't know a whole lot about the voltages yet but my analog discovery can only do a max of +/- 5v but the amplifier can take up to +/- 10v but I might not need that much. I also just discovered from a colleague that you can't use the BNC adapter board on the Analog Discovery 2 to send out a wave, it is only for reading so I hooked up a break out cable for all the pins and what I have to do is wire individual pins to an aligator clip to bnc cable and route the signal that way. In this case it would be W1 pin which is the yellow cable."
