It employs 140 people in a complex of eight small factories in the outer Melbourne suburb of Dandenong. It makes and exports Australian-developed scientific measuring instruments, ranging in price from $20,000 to $150,000 for industrial, medical and laboratory applications. Its products include an atomic absorption spectrometer, a device than measures the chemical make-up of research specimens.",

Its products include an atomic absorption spectrometer, a device than measures the chemical make-up of research specimens.\n\nThe managing director of GBC, Ron Grey, says the company's sales this year will be worth about $12 million, and will represent 8% of the world sales of atomic absorption spectrometers. The company sells its products in 67 countries, and is the market leader in Asia. It exports 90% of its production and has averaged 56% annual sales growth for the past five years. Grey says growth this year has been hit by the world recession but he still expects it to be about 10%. The company won Commonwealth export awards in 1988 and 1990. GBC salvaged another \"clever\" Australian manufacturer last July when it bought the scientific instruments division of Labtam from the receiver."
