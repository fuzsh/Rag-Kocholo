        "text": "Demands for added functionality can require advanced & fine pitch PCBs, allowing more circuits in smaller spaces. High-density interconnects (HDI), advanced multi-layer boards, and innovative IC substrates all are accelerating demands for extreme PCB miniaturization. DuPont Interconnect Solutions ensures innovation has no boundaries and fabricators can create miniaturized yet reliable next-gen PCBs matching design requirements over the long term.\n\nDuPont Electronics & Industrial makes next-generation technology a reality. Through industry-leading innovation, deep materials science expertise and large scale, best-in-class manufacturing we address our customers’ needs for innovative materials and connectivity – today and in the future.\n\nThe chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process is key to building circuitry for semiconductor devices. It’s a precise operation that enables microchips to process data faster and store large volumes of data while using less power. DuPont E&I’s expertise, commitment to collaboration, and specialized materials enable a wide range of applications, moving innovation forward.\n\nIn the electronics industry, high-performance chips require extremely small features—features that DuPont E&I’s photoresists support. Our ultra-high-purity manufacturing process and tight batch control result in high-quality resists that can be spread in very thin layers. Our production-proven photoresists are optimized for wavelengths from 436 nanometers all the way down to the smallest, 13.5 nanometers.\n\nUsing science and innovation to build a sustainable world.\n\nOur purpose — to empower the world with the essential innovations to thrive — represents our commitment to society. We apply our passion and proven expertise in science and innovation to provide sustainable solutions to the complex challenges facing our world."
