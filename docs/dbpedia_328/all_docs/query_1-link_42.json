We bring a qualified Industrial Hygienist and world-class lab to you! And we can do so 24/7/365. Yes, you read that right! Techtron is Driving Environmental Testing Forward. Imagine this: You or your customer incurs a loss, and you need environmental testing done, FAST. That's where Techtron steps in! With a dedicated on-call team ready to spring into action, Techtron can dispatch a fully equipped lab directly to your location, and deliver the testing results you need in hours, not days. This means less waiting, more doing, and getting back to what you do best, even quicker. ‚è±Ô∏è Ready to experience the future of environmental testing? üåü üìû Call us today at 800.264.8929 and discover how Techtron is driving environmental testing forward, one project at a time. #Techtron #MobileLab #EnvironmentalTesting #Innovation\n\nNearly a decade ago, the U.S. EPA introduced the Clean Water Act ¬ß 316(b) regulations (Rule), mandating that existing generating and manufacturing facilities using modified traveling water screens (MTWS) undergo a two-year impingement technology performance optimization study. The reason for this Rule? To enhance screen efficiency and minimize fish mortality. The Verdantas Flow Labs team has been and remains at the forefront of helping our clients understand the guidelines and processes of optimization studies. We can assist in selecting the appropriate modified traveling water screen (MTWS) vendor for your particular needs and in developing engineering specifications to ensure a successful MTWS installation. üêü Our vast experience conducting lab and field studies to assess fish mortality associated with collection and return systems, paired with our past and present work conducting optimization studies, makes us the true industry leaders in the design of fish-friendly MTWS and fish return system installations. Let us help you navigate the Rule! https://lnkd.in/ee3wXwhZ #CleanWaterAct #MTWS #FlowLabs\n\nCongratulations to Todd Webster, Ph.D., P.E. of Envirogen for co-authoring an article on ‚ÄúEvaluation of a sequential anaerobic-aerobic membrane bioreactor system for treatment of traditional and insensitive munitions constituents‚Äù. Read the full article for FREE over the next 50 days: https://lnkd.in/eBzvWJHb Published in Chemosphere Journal (Volume 340), the paper highlights: - A dual anaerobic-aerobic MBR system treated a wide range of traditional explosives, IHE, and anions including DNAN, RDX, HMX, TNT, NTO, NQ, NO3‚àí and ClO4‚àí. - The MBR system was resilient to upsets and changing munitions constituents. - Residual ATO present in the effluent of the dual system was readily oxidized using bleach. - The dual MBR system is expected to be widely applicable and sustainable for treating wastewaters with explosives. Special thanks to Jim Pezzillo who is acknowledged in the article for his contribution and assistance with MBR set-up and start-up. This underscores Envirogen's commitment to advancing environmental technology and engineering, addressing intricate challenges for a cleaner and safer world.

What makes the VacuMag 3000 and our extraction and filtration system so special? Ultra-high performance: Rapidly remove contaminant coatings such as lead, achieving results previously considered impossible. Operator comfort and safety: With the VacuMag 3000, the ultra-high pressure pump can be turned on and off by remote control. The operator stands comfortably at a safe distance. Increased Productivity: With up to FIVE times more productivity, the VacuMag 3000 turns a workday into a work moment. Environment: By extracting the paint sludge containing pollutants and then treating it, the water is treated so that it remains in a closed system. Share this innovation with your network and together redefine the standards for the removal of pollutant-containing coatings! üö®Convince yourself and rent a complete system for your upcoming project. info@oftec-gmbh.com #surfaceprep #coatingremoval #oilgas #storagetanks #tankcleaning #robotics #closesystem #envionment #watertreatment #madeingermany #dorsten #oftec #oftecgmbh #industrialservices #waterjetting #uhp\n\nüåüCase Study Highlight: Specto Technology & Langan at 250 Water Street üåü Specto Technology was proud to assist Langan in maintaining compliance with the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and reassuring the community during the challenging remediation of 250 Water Street, a 1.1-acre brownfield in Manhattan‚Äôs Seaport Historic District. Key Points: üèóÔ∏è Project Scope: Howard Hughes Corp. invested $850 million to redevelop the polluted site, hiring Langan to implement the Brownfield Cleanup Program. üöõ Cleanup Effort: 21,700 cubic yards of lead and mercury-impacted soil required excavation and disposal. üå¨Ô∏è Monitoring Mandates: Due to proximity to sensitive receptors, the DEC required a Community Air Monitoring Plan (CAMP) to monitor PM10, VOCs, and mercury vapor. Our Solution: Langan partnered with Specto Technology to streamline costs and complexity: üîß Installed 10 Aeroqual AQS 1 air quality stations with Jerome¬Æ analyzers for comprehensive monitoring. üìä Utilized real-time data and alerts from Aeroqual Cloud for pre-emptive mitigation measures. üìà Generated daily field reports from the cloud, replacing manual processes. üåê Provided the community with daily air quality updates via a project website. Outcome: Aeroqual‚Äôs solution reduced setup, breakdown, and reporting time by half, minimized potential exposure, reassured the community with quality data, and helped complete the cleanup on time and within budget. üìñ Read the full case study here: https://hubs.ly/Q02DzT9M0 #BrownfieldCleanup #EnvironmentalMonitoring #SpectoTechnology #Innovation #Sustainability #CommunitySafety #RealTimeData\n\nüîßüí® Fast & Sealfurious case studies!
