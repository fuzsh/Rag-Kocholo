        "text": "I am pumped about what's new to Vistaly this week. If you're building opportunity solution trees, impact maps, KPI trees, or using trees to visualize product processes or business systems, check this out. We've been working with customers to build tools that get out of your way, so you can focus on building strategy and discovery systems that work. What does \"getting out of the way\" mean in this context? - More than short-lived whiteboarding artifacts, you know, the ones that started as a brainstorming doc but evolved into something‚Ä¶ else. - Shareable without requiring a personal guided 1:1 tour. - ALWAYS clean, organized, and structured without spending minutes dragging boxes around each time you want to make a meaningful change. - Scales past the one or two people who spent time building the thing. - It doesn't lock your data inside, requiring double or triple entry to get information where it needs to go. - Quickly see what changed, when, and by whom. On to what‚Äôs new! Let's say you've been capturing customer insights and identifying opportunities, your tree's getting big, the team is committed to addressing several opportunities, and you're responsible for a few. Imagine taking a tree of 100-200 cards (multiple opportunity solution trees, KPI trees, etc.) and minimizing it to the 2-5 areas you care about. Then imagine you can explore from there to learn more or get a refresher. Wouldn‚Äôt that be cool üòâ We have some use cases that we'll be sharing over the next few days. Follow along and check them out ‚Äì Vistaly #productdiscovery #product #productdevelopment\n\nAfter getting inspired last week about ways to make Insights work harder, I came across Vistaly and decided to keep going beyond reporting. In my experience, some companies churn and burn through their insights, potentially reducing their value. By keeping them siloed, it not only adds complexity but misses overarching themes that can drive new value when put together. üõéÔ∏è Cue: Insights Curation First - what is it? üìà Making Insights activation easier for business stakeholders to refine and execute their roadmaps quicker So - why might it be needed? üóøProduct example: Sprawling customer/user insights adding to a product manager‚Äôs new product development technical debt. Great - what‚Äôs the takeaway? üßÆ Leverage better information architecture: Molding findings into pruned impact maps and opportunity solution trees that blueprint product development priorities. #productdevelopment #productmanagement #informationarchitecture #customerinsights\n\nüåü Sprintform Spotlighted in Behaviour Magazine! We are excited to share that Sprintform has been featured in Behaviour - a HR-magazine! This recognition comes from our innovative approach to bridging business strategy with technology. üéØ Leadership and Vision: In the feature, our founder and CEO, Andras Berczeli, shares insights into the motivations behind Sprintform's inception and its successful journey since 2019.
