Rudolph offers the widest range of refractometers available in the market. Rudolph is a leading analytical laboratory instrument supplier. For instance, we manufacture precision quality, benchtop instrumentation. We serve the Pharmaceutical, Chemical, Petroleum, Petro-Chemical, Food, Beverage, Flavor, fragrance, and Alcohol industries. Therefore, all our instruments are designed to meet specific application requirements.. Our instruments are designed to exceed your requirements. To meet many needs, we offer a range of models and numerous configurations. We are of course always pleased to advise you as you make a purchase decision for your laboratory.\n\nWhat does a refractometer measure?\n\nMeasuring Refractive Index\n\nMeasuring BRIX\n\nMeasure the Refractive Index of Solids\n\nUAN Fertilizer Concentration Analysis\n\nRefractive Index for Powder-Particle Size Analysis\n\nWhat industries use a refractometer?\n\nEvery industry has its unique application requirements, environmental constraints, and operator handling issues with which to contend. Different capabilities, sample handling options, and configurations are needed for different industries.\n\nFor more applications and industry uses see the Rudolph Refractometer Selection Guide\n\nRefractometer: Watch a video about the Rudolph Research line of Automatic Refractometers\n\nTrouble viewing this video? Click Here\n\nRefractometers From Rudolph Research All Feature:\n\nEasy to clean, shallow Sample well. A clean sample well is imperative to accurate measurements.\n\nDurable Sapphire Prisms with Long-life Light sources. Low Life of instrument cost.\n\n3 Year Domestic Warranty.\n\nUp to 3 year International Warranty.\n\n20 Year Support Guarantee.\n\nSales and local service located near your lab anywhere in the world.\n\nDurability to stand up to the harshest environments.\n\nModern Refractometer Data Storage\n\nMost Importantly, decades of leading Analytical Instrument Design and Support.\n\nHigh Durability Sapphire Prism\n\nAll Rudolph Research J-Series refractometer instruments offer a sapphire prism. This provides for high mechanical and chemical durability. The sample well is made of acid resistant 316 stainless steel with a Techtron sealing ring. The LED light source is designed to last for one million measurements. The prism does not scratch and can with stand the harshest environments.\n\nShallow Refractometer Sample Well – All Rudolph J-Series Models\n\nRefractometer measurement accuracy is only as reliable as the cleanliness of the sample well. Thus, hard to clean sample wells can lead to inaccuracies. This is due to residual sample left from a prior measurement. Rudolph set out to dramatically minimize this problem with a new approach to sample well design. Using higher quality optics Rudolph was able to design a sample well that is very shallow and smooth. This design, allows much easier cleaning and less surface area for contaminants to hide. The well cleans easily. The result is more accurate measurements due to significantly sample cross-contamination.\n\nRefractometers – With advanced sample temperature control\n\nRudolph’s sample well has an electronic heating and cooling system. This greatly improves results and is simple to use. Moreover, sample temperatures must be accurately controlled within the sample well. This is true for most applications. Some applications requires highly controlled temperature. A temperature-controlled presser can be added to ensure even and accurate temperature stability. This provides stable temperature control from both the top and bottom. Therefore, a precisely controlled micro-environment is created. Thus, temperature-controlled samples from both the top and bottom allow for the most accurate measurement.\n\nRefractometers – with dozens of application specific options, over 10 Models\n\nRudolph understands your measurement applications. We provide the needed instruments and configurations to meet your requirements. For example, application requirements may be dictated by regulatory agencies, quality control demands, or sample handling concerns. Refractometers may also be utilized in conjunction with other instruments for multiple measurements. You may load one sample to receive multiple measurement results. Measurements can be used together with sample specific tables or calculations. Sample delivery can also be automated. Automation can be with or without other instruments for a complete Laboratory Automation solution. Above all, Rudolph products will increase efficiency in your laboratory.\n\nHigh Accuracy Laboratory Refractometer – Model J457 Our Most Advanced Model.
