        "text": "Licensed TOP TIER™ Gasoline Retailers must adhere to the rigorous fuel detergency performance requirements. Be assured, the performance standard applies to all octane grades sold in each of the retail outlets, even if a TOP TIER™ Approved Gasoline sticker is not found on the pump. Please contact us if no pump sticker is found on licensed brands.\n\nMany of the leading automakers sponsor the TOP TIER™ program and recommend its consistent use in vehicles to minimize carbon deposit build-up and keep engines operating as designed. The number of sponsors has grown over the years and now includes BMW, General Motors, Stellantis, Ford, Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, Navistar and Audi.\n\nIn the United States, fuel standards are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In 1996 EPA established a gasoline deposit control additive program to ensure that all gasoline used in the United States contains additives that limit the formation of such deposits. This is known as LAC (Lowest Allowable Concentration). Over the next 8 years, automakers saw evidence that detergency levels should be higher for optimum performance and introduced the TOP TIER ™ Performance Standard in 2004.\n\nDeposits that form in engines and fuel delivery systems can cause performance issues such as reduced fuel economy, increased emissions and drivability problems such as hard starting, hesitation and stalling. TOP TIER™ Detergent Gasolines use additives tested and shown to minimize deposits.\n\nFuel marketers and retailers voluntarily join the TOP TIER™ program and agree to supply fuel meeting the Performance Standard using TOP TIER™ approved additives at a specified concentration. TOP TIER™ retailers supply fuel meeting the requirements at all their stations in all octane grades offered."
