        "text": "U.S. technology company\n\nFor other uses of \"Varian\", see Varian (disambiguation).\n\nVarian, Inc. was one of the largest manufacturers of scientific instruments for the scientific industry.[1] They had offerings over a broad range of chemical analysis equipment, with a particular focus on Information Rich Detection[clarification needed] and Vacuum technology. Varian was spun off from Varian Associates in 1999 and was purchased by Agilent Technologies in May 2010 for $1.5 billion, or $52 per share.[2]\n\nVarian Inc. had its corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, California, and offices in Australia, the Benelux countries, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nVarian Inc. contained the following manufacturing plants:\n\nLake Forest, California USA\n\nPalo Alto, California USA\n\nWalnut Creek, California USA\n\nLexington, Massachusetts, USA\n\nCary, North Carolina, USA\n\nMulgrave, Victoria Australia (the largest Varian Inc manufacturing and R&D plant)\n\nMiddelburg, The Netherlands\n\nGrenoble, France\n\nYarnton, United Kingdom\n\nChurch Stretton, Shropshire, United Kingdom (polymer laboratories)\n\nTurin, Italy\n\nChromatography, including gas chromatography, GC/MS, high performance liquid chromatography, and LC/MS.\n\nSpectroscopy, including UV-Vis, CD, near infrared, and FT-IR\n\nInductively coupled plasma, including mass spectroscopic and atomic emission spectroscopic detection.\n\nmass spectrometry, including FTMS\n\nNuclear magnetic resonance\n\nLinear accelerator\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging\n\nX-ray Crystallography\n\nInformation rich detection\n\nDrugs of Abuse Testing\n\nDissolution Testing\n\nVacuum Pumps\n\nLeak Detection\n\nTurbo Pumping Systems\n\nVacuum Measurement\n\nValves and components\n\nIn October 1967, Techtron Pty Ltd merged with Varian Associates. Techtron is a manufacturer of Atomic Absorption Spectrometers and Spectral lamps.\n\nIn 1982, Varian transferred the Cary UV-Visible product line to Australia.\n\nIn 1997, Varian bought Chemagnetics, a Colorado-based manufacturer of solid-state NMR spectrometers.[3]\n\nIn 2002, Varian bought Ansys Technologies, Inc., a California-based manufacturer of In-Vitro Medical Devices.\n\nIn 2004, Varian Inc bought Magnex Scientific, an Oxford-based manufacturer of high-field magnets.\n\nIn 2005, Varian bought Polymer Laboratories, a speciality polymer analysis and manufacturing company.\n\nIn 2006, Varian bought Ion Spec, an FTMS (Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometry) manufacturing company.\n\nIn 2007, Varian, Inc. bought Analogix, Inc., a company specializing in flash chromatography.\n\nIn 2008, Varian bought Oxford Diffraction, a British company specializing in X-ray diffraction equipment.\n\nOn 27 July 2009, Agilent Technologies announced it would buy Varian Inc, for $1.5 Billion.\n\nOn 14 October 2014, Agilent made the strategic decision to close its NMR business. Agilent entered the NMR business in 2010, with the acquisition of Varian.\n\nLaboratory equipment"
