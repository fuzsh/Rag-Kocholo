        "text": "We exclusively supply our customers’ private label products and do not supply products to the end user.\n\nTechtron’s intellectual property is made up of over 1000 chemical formulations and we are continually developing new products to add to our database.\n\nIf you have a bespoke product you would like to produce, but do not have the capability of developing it, we can guide you through our new product development process. Our process is simple and accessible to large scale operations and start-up companies alike.\n\nOur team of chemical formulation experts formulate and reformulate products to enable your business or brand to offer products that fit your specification. We are able to not only formulate, bottle, label and deliver your product – we are also able to test it at our ISO9001:2015 accredited facility.\n\nWe have outlined our new product development (NPD) process into six steps, to make it as easy as possible for our customers to work in partnership with us to produce bespoke products.\n\nStep 1: Product Specification Questions\n\nWe ask a variety of simple questions to make sure we know exactly what kind of product you require. These questions based on application methods, pack sizes, materials and accreditations will help us to produce our new product brief.\n\nStep Two: Product Brief\n\nWe will then produce a product brief, which will be sent to you for approval. This brief will ensure that all parties involved in the development process understand the product specification, and we will ask you to verify that our assumptions or product information is correct.\n\nWhen the product brief has been approved by you, it is forwarded to our new product development department to be reviewed.\n\nStep Three: Our Formulation Chemists Begin Product Development\n\nOnce our development team have reviewed and approved the product brief, our team of in-house formulation chemists will proceed to formulate the product based on your specifications. The first product sample will be formulated and sent to you, so you can review the product for yourself, to make sure everything is correct, and it performs as required.\n\nStep Four: Formulations are Developed After a Product Review\n\nFeedback on the product samples will then be requested by your account manager and our development team will amend the formulation if you have identified any areas for improvement with the sample(s) you have reviewed.\n\nOnce this has been completed, any amended samples will be re-sent to you, until you are happy with the product's performance.\n\nIt is very important to us to ensure customers are happy with the product at this stage, to avoid any future issues when we manufacture your new formulation on a larger scale.\n\nStep Five: 12-Week Stability Test\n\nWe put all new formulations through a 12-week stability test, examining the product under a variety of conditions that the product may be exposed to in a typical retail environment or distribution channels.\n\nYour new product will be tested at specific time points against strict quality control parameters that are unique to each product to ensure compliance against its specification.\n\nStep Six: Large Scale Manufacturing Can Begin\n\nOnce product specifications, product formulation and development, and required tests are completed and confirmed, the new product development process is finished, we can then proceed into large scale manufacturing."
