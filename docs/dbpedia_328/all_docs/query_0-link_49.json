In fact, some superabsorbent polymers are highly sought after in advanced applications for medical, construction and more. Yet, moisture absorption of thermoplastics leads to changes with regard to processing and properties.\n\nIt is crucial for machinists and designers to understand the moisture absorption of thermoplastics for CNC machining. During the design phase, this not only helps with initial material selection, but plays a role in predicting the life span of a part. At AIP, we take great care in providing unrivaled results to ensure the optimal dimensions and properties for machined polymers and composites. Join us in this technical brief as we give an in-depth explanation of the effects of moisture absorption for machined polymers.\n\nPlastics Machining and the Importance of Water Absorption\n\nMoisture / water absorption is the capacity of a plastic or a polymer to absorb moisture from its environment. Absorbed moisture sometimes acts as a plasticizer, reducing the glass transition temperature and strength of plastic (this is a reversible side effect). However, absorbed water also can lead to irreversible degradation of the polymer structure.\n\nSome effects include:\n\nDimensional and mass changes (swelling) caused by water absorption\n\nExtraction of water-soluble components\n\nChanges in mechanical (elasticity, tensile strength, impact strength) and electrical performance\n\nWater absorption is expressed as increase in weight percent or % weight gain of a plastic specimen under the following testing procedures:\n\nWater Absorption 24 hrs at 23°C – Immersion of a plastic specimen in distilled water during 24 hours at 23°C\n\nWater Absorption 24 hrs at 100°C– Immersion of a plastic specimen in distilled boiling water during 24 hours Water Absorption at saturation – Immersion of a plastic specimen in distilled water at 23°C. Measurement occurs when the polymer does not absorb water anymore\n\nWater Absorption at Equilibrium– Plastic specimen is exposed to a humid environment — generally at 50% relative humidity — at a specified temperature — 23°C or 73.4°F — for 24 hours\n\n(Source: Omnexus)\n\nExposure to humidity, immersion and boiling water can result in different material responses. The equilibrium moisture content can be used to compare the amount of water absorbed by different types of plastics when they are exposed to moisture.\n\nPlastics Processing and Properties\n\nPolymers are affected by moisture from their environment or from simply sitting on a shelf waiting to be used. This is not a huge concern, but when the moisture absorption reaches more than 1% or 2%+, this can result in enough dimensional movement to create concerns.\n\nMoisture Absorption Affects:\n\nMechanical properties\n\nWear properties\n\nDimensions\n\nFor example, parts made from TORLON (PAI) require special attention due to a 1.7% moisture at saturation value. While this number may not sound like much, it is enough to cause a precision machined TORLON part to exceed tolerance; in this scenario, the part cannot be used.\n\nTherefore, it is important to properly package these mission critical polymers for lasting shelf-life and function. This can be achieved in two ways: 1) Vacuum-sealing them in a moisture-impermeable layer or 2) packaging them with bags of desiccant. This prevents moisture uptake in humid environments.\n\nTests to Measure Water Absorption of Plastics\n\nSource\n\nASTM D570 – Standard Test Method for Water Absorption of Plastics\n\nThis test method for rate of water absorption has two main functions:\n\nA guide to the proportion of water absorbed by a material and consequently, in those cases where the relationships between moisture and electrical or mechanical properties, dimensions, or appearance have been determined, as a guide to the effects of exposure to water or humid conditions on such properties.\n\nA control test on the uniformity of a product. It is particularly applicable to sheet, rod, and tube arms when the test is made on the finished product.\n\nProcedure: Parts are dried in an oven for a specified time and temperature and then placed in a desiccator to cool. Upon cooling, the specimens are weighed to establish a point of reference. The material is then submerged in water at standardized conditions (usually 23°C for 24 hours or until equilibrium). Specimens are removed from the liquid, dried and weighed.\n\nWhat affects water absorption?\n\nType of plastic\n\nMorphology (crystalline, amorphous…)\n\nType and proportion of additives, fillers and reinforcements used\n\nFiber fraction and orientation (in composites)\n\nRelative humidity and temperature\n\nLength of exposure\n\nWater Absorption Values for Common Polymers\n\nPolymer Name Min Value (% weight) Max Value (% weight) ABS – Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene 0.05 1.80 PA – Nylon Polyamide, 66 30% Glass Fiber 0.80 1.10 PAI – Polyamide-Imides (TORLON) 0.10 0.30 PBI – Polybenzimidazole (CELAZOLE) 0.4 5 PC – Polycarbonate, high heat 0.10 0.20 PE – Polyethylene, 30% glass fiber 0.02 0.06 PEEK – Polyetheretherketone 0.10 0.50 PEI – Polyetherimide (ULTEM) 0.20 0.30 PP – Polypropylene 0.01 0.10 PS – Polystyrene, high heat 0.01 0.07 PSU – Polysulfone 0.20 0.80 PTFE – Polytetrafluorethylene 0.005 0.015 PVC – Polyvinyl chloride, rigid 0.04 0.40 PVDF – Polyvinylidene fluoride (KYNAR) 0.03 0.05\n\nAs the chart notes, some polymers such as Nylon (PA) have a higher rate of % gain from moisture absorption. However, polymers like PVDF and PTFE have a very low % gain in weight after the ASTM D570 test – which makes them excellent candidates for applications where moisture is a factor.\n\nPerformance thermoplastics are often exposed to high temperature applications (aircraft engines) which also absorb high levels of moisture. This is common in materials such as PBI (Celazole) and PAI (Torlon), since these polymers absorb moisture at high rates but are also specified in high temperature applications.\n\nBasically, what can happen is that these materials absorb the moisture if not properly stored and packaged. Then if subject to high levels of heat without time for the moisture to dissipate, the internal moisture boils and turns to steam causing the parts to crack and blister.\n\nManaging Moisture Absorption\n\nFor predictable machined part fit and performance, stock shapes and finished parts should be stored in a dry environment. Both finished parts and stock shapes should be packed in moisture barrier packaging. Only open packaging just prior to use. In the event that a part may have adsorbed so much moisture as to risk shocking it when placing it in high temperature or vacuum service, consider drying the material prior to use or re-use.\n\nYour machining facility will have specifications on temperature and storage procedures for all polymers, stock shapes and components. When it comes to critical applications, work with a machine shop that has high standards for storing products. After all, machining a polymer is only part of the entire process; wasted machining, revenue and parts is not worth risking poor storage conditions. The table below shows some common packaging for polymers to increase and preserve shelf-life.\n\nGenerally, you can find a polymer’s 24 Hour and Saturation Moisture Absorption Values on a data chart. A chart can give a general idea of the moisture absorption, but an entire data set with the curve of a material is the best way to determine the right material for your project. Be sure to work with a plastics machining company that can provide you a wide range of data on the moisture absorption of polymers and composites. Your machinist will be able to identify how moisture and humidity will affect your project’s design and functionality. Talk to one our engineers at AIP about your project design, and we will work with you to provide unrivaled expertise from your project’s initial concept to completion.\n\nSupporting Materials\n\nCertifications and Regulatory Resources\n\nWant to learn more about factors that contribute to effective CNC machining?\n\nRead Our Blog on CLTE\n\nFollow AIP Precision Machining on Linkedin\n\nWith over three decades of experience machining precision plastic and composite parts for the Aerospace & Defense industry, AIP Precision Machining knows that weight and strength are critical for your flight-ready hardware. That’s why we’ve carefully selected, machined, and tested all our thermoplastic materials to various aerospace industry standards. Our lightweight polymers and composites have stable chemical and corrosion resistance, as well as improved strength to weight ratios when compared to exotic alloys and non-ferrous metals. AIP’s polymer and composite materials maintain their properties even at high temperatures.\n\nRead more on thermoplastic materials commonly used in the Aerospace & Defense industry for every day to mission-critical applications.\n\nULTEM – PEI\n\nULTEM has one of the highest dielectric strengths of any thermoplastic material, meaning it works very efficiently as an electrical insulator. Being resistant to both hot water and steam, ULTEM can withstand repeated cycles in a steam autoclave and can operate in high service temperature environments (340F or 170C). ULTEM also has one of the lowest rates of thermal conductivity, allowing parts machined from ULTEM to act as thermal insulators. ULTEM is FDA and NSF approved for both food and medical contact and therefore is an excellent choice for aircraft galley equipment such as ovens, microwaves and hot or cold beverage dispensing systems. UL94 V-O flame rating with very low smoke output makes this material ideal for aircraft interior components.\n\nCELAZOLE – PBI\n\nCELAZOLE provides the highest mechanical properties of any thermoplastic above 400F (204C) and offers a continuous use operating temperature of 750F (399C). CELAZOLE has outstanding high-temperature mechanical properties for use in aircraft engines and other HOT section areas. This impressive lightweight material retains 100% tensile strength after being submerged in hydraulic fluid at 200°F for thirty days.\n\nRYTON – PPS\n\nRYTON’s inherent fire retardancy, thermal stability and corrosion resistance makes it perfectly suited for aerospace applications, while its dimensional stability means even the most intricate parts can be molded from RYTON with very tight tolerances. RYTON is typically used for injection molded parts, however, there is limited availability of extruded rod and plate for machining.\n\nVESPEL or DURATRON – PI\n\nLike RYTON, VESPEL is dimensionally stable and has fantastic temperature resistance. It can operate uninterrupted from cryogenic temperatures to 550°F, with intermittent to 900°F. Thanks to its resistance to high wear and friction, VESPEL performs with excellence and longevity in severe environments—like those used in aerospace applications. VESPEL is a trademarked material of DuPont and can be provided in direct formed blanks or finished parts directly from DuPont. AIP provides precision machined components from DuPont manufactured rod and plate stock. VESPEL is typically used in high temperature and high-speed bearing and wear applications such as stator bushings.\n\nTORLON or DURATRON – PAI\n\nDURATRON PAI’s extremely low coefficient of linear thermal expansion and high creep resistance deliver excellent dimensional stability over its entire service range. DURATRON PAI is an amorphous material with a Tg (glass transition temperature) of 537°F (280°C). DURATRON PAI stock shapes are post-cured using procedures developed jointly by BP Amoco under the TORLON trade name and Quadrant under the DURATRON trade name. A post-curing cycle is sometimes recommended for components fabricated from extruded shapes where optimization of chemical resistance and/or wear performance is required. TOLRON parts are used in structural, wear and electrical aerospace applications.\n\nTECHTRON – PPS\n\nTECHTRON has essentially zero moisture absorption which allows products manufactured from this material to maintain extreme dimensional and density stability. TECHTRON is highly chemical resistant allowing it to operate while submerged in harsh chemicals. It is inherently flame retardant and can be easily machined to close tolerances. It has a broader resistance to chemicals than most high-performing plastics and can work well as an alternative to PEEK at lower temperatures.\n\nRADEL – PPSU\n\nWith high heat and high impact performance, RADEL delivers better impact resistance and chemical resistance than other sulfone based polymers, such as PSU and PEI. Its toughness and long-term hydrolytic stability means it performs well even under autoclave pressure. RADEL R5500 meets the stringent aircraft flammability requirements of 14CFR Part 25, allowing the aircraft design engineer to provide lightweight, safe and aesthetically pleasing precision components for various aircraft interior layouts. RADEL can be polished to a mirror finish and is FDA and NSF approved for food and beverage contact.\n\nKEL – F\n\nKel-F is a winning combination of physical and mechanical properties, non-flammability, chemical resistance, near-zero moisture absorption and of course outstanding electrical properties. This stands out from other thermoplastic fluoropolymers, as only Kel-F has these characteristics in a useful temperature range of -400°F to +400°F. In addition, it has very low outgassing and offers extreme transmissivity for radar and microwave applications. Many aircraft and ground-based random applications use Kel-F.\n\nPEEK\n\nPEEK can be used continuously to 480°F (250°C) and in hot water or steam without permanent loss in physical properties. For hostile environments, PEEK is a high strength alternative to fluoropolymers. PEEK carries a V-O flammability rating and exhibits very low smoke and toxic gas emission when exposed to flame. PEEK is an increasingly popular replacement for metal in the aerospace industry due to its lightweight nature, mechanical strength, creep and fatigue resistance, as well as its ease in processing. Its exceptional physical and thermal characteristics make it a versatile thermoplastic polymer in many aerospace applications. AIP has provided flight control, fuel system, interior, engine and aerodynamic related PEEK components for various aircraft OEM and MRO providers worldwide.\n\nKYNAR – PVDF\n\nAnother example of thermoplastic materials used in aerospace and defense is KYNAR, or PVDF. This polymer has impressive chemical resistance at ambient and elevated temperatures, as well as good thermomechanical and tensile strength. KYNAR is extremely durable due to its weather-ability and toughness even in the most severe environments. In addition to being flame-resistant, KYNAR is easy to machine, too. You can typically find KYNAR components in pipe fitting and various fuel or other fluid-related precision manifolds or connectors.\n\nClick here to search our material data for more information or request a quote here.\n\nFollow AIP Precision Machining on Linkedin\n\nPART SUMMARY:\n\nOne of the high-performance thermoplastics that AIP machines is Polyetherimide (PEI), known by its tradename ULTEM.

Additionally, since it has a high thermal resistance rating, polymer components have the benefit of evading radar detection in military aircraft.\n\nAIP machines ULTEM 1000 & ULTEM 2300\n\nULTEM 2300 is a 30 percent glass filled version of virgin ULTEM 1000. The addition of glass increases ULTEM 1000’s dimensional stability by almost three times.\n\nFor over three decades, AIP has provided flight control, fuel system, interior, engine and aerodynamic-related ULTEM components for various aircraft OEM and MRO providers worldwide. As this industry continues to expand, evolve and innovate, the demand for high-performance materials like ULTEM contribute significantly to streamlined operations.\n\nWHAT CAN ULTEM DO FOR MEDICAL & LIFE SCIENCES?\n\nIn the Medical Industry, biocompatibility and sterilization are paramount to medical instruments and implants. ULTEM is often a popular choice in this sector due to its resistance to chemicals and lipids. Polyetherimide also withstands dry heat sterilization at 356°F (180°C), ethylene oxide gas, gamma radiation and steam autoclave.\n\nSome popular medical applications include disposable and re-usable medical devices and medical monitor probe housings. These could be surgical instrument handles and enclosures or non-implant prostheses. It gets extensive use in membrane applications due to its separation, permeance and biocompatible properties.\n\nWHAT CAN ULTEM DO FOR SPECIALIZED INDUSTRIAL Sectors?\n\nAt AIP, we precision machine ULTEM for many specialized industrial applications as well: automotive, electrical and metal replacement, to name a few.

Over the course of the last century countless test flights, thousands of blueprints, and endless research from passionate minds have propelled the evolution of aircraft and aerospace technologies. Read on to discover how aviation materials have shifted to create a better, safer, and more efficient flight experience.\n\nThe Pioneers of Aviation\n\nFor much of human history, we have been fascinated with taking flight. The ancient Greeks contemplated sprouting wings in myths like Icarus and Daedalus – the boy who flew too close to the sun with wax and feather wings. Leonardo Da Vinci sketched flying machines that were way ahead of Renaissance times. It all came to fruition in 1857 when Félix du Temple de la Croix, a French Naval officer, received a patent for a flying machine. By 1874, he had developed a lightweight steam-powered monoplane which flew short distances under its own power after takeoff from a ski-jump. Finally, in 1903, the Wright Brothers made the first controlled, powered, and sustained flight near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The Wright Flyer featured a lightweight aluminum engine, wood and steel construction, and a fabric wing warping. According to the U.S. Smithsonian Institution, the Wright brothers accomplished the “world’s first successful flights of a powered heavier-than-air flying machine.”\n\nJust 12 years later, the first all-metal airplane (Junkers J1), built by Hugo Junkers (1859-1935), took flight in 1915. Previously, aircraft experts believed that airplanes can only fly with light materials such as wood, struts, tension wires, and canvas. Junkers thought differently and believed that heavier materials like metal were necessary to transport passengers and goods.\n\nThe Golden Age\n\nThe Roaring 20’s ushered in airplane racing competitions, which led aircraft designers to focus on performance. Innovators, such as Howard Hughes, found that monoplanes (aircraft with one pair of wings) were more aerodynamic in comparison to biplanes, and that frames made with aluminum alloys were capable of withstanding extraordinary pressures and stresses. Due to its lightweight properties, aluminum also made its way into the internal fittings of the aircraft decreasing the weight and allowing for a more fuel-efficient design.\n\nIn 1925, Henry Ford acquired the Stout Metal Airplane Company, utilizing the all-metal design principles proposed by Hugo Junkers, Ford developed the Ford Trimotor, nicknamed the “Tin Goose.” The “Tin Goose” propelled the race to design safe and reliable engines for airline travel. A few years later, Henry Ford’s Trimotor NC8407 became the first airplane flown by Eastern Air Transport, a leading domestic airline in the 1930s flying routes from New York to Florida. This positioned metal as the primary material for domestic aircraft, and eventually military applications with the onset of WWII.\n\nPlastic’s Mettle: Wartime Materials Take Flight\n\nBy the 1930’s, the use of wood became obsolete and all-metal aircrafts were produced for their durability. Imperial Airways, known today as British Airways, made headway in the air travel industry with advertisements of luxury and adventure to cross borders. However, those borders were sealed off with the breakout of WWII. In 1939, Imperial Airways, a private commercial airline, was ordered to operate from a military standpoint at Bristol Airport. Across the Atlantic, engineers focused their efforts on building aircraft meant specifically for military strategy – strength, durability, agility, and weaponry. The Boeing P-26 “Peashooter” entered service with the United States Army Air Corps as the first all-metal and low-wing monoplane fighter aircraft. Known for its speed and maneuverability, the small but feisty P-26 formed the core of pursuit squadrons throughout the United States.\n\nIn times of war, there are often significant advancements in material usage, weaponry, and machinery. World War II was no different. Plastics entered the scene during World War II, starting with the replacement of metal parts for rubber parts in U.S. aircraft after Japan limited metal trade with the United States. Following that, plastics of higher grades began to replace electrical insulators and mechanical components such as gears, pulleys, and fasteners. Aircraft manufacturers began to replace aluminum parts with plastics as they were lighter and thus more fuel efficient than aluminum.\n\nThe Race for Space\n\nLighter and more fuel efficient were the key words following World War II as nations turned their attention to the skies and beyond. The space program in the 1960’s brought together illustrious minds to solve the seemingly impossible feat of being the first country to put mankind on the moon, thus, the great race for space began. Aircraft were now going beyond the sky and NASA scientists knew they were dealing with new territory in aero innovation. They needed a material that could break the Earth’s atmosphere and carry a hefty amount of fuel, while protecting the spacecraft’s crew from extreme temperatures. NASA scientists turned to plastics, specifically Kevlar and nylon. Layers of nylon and other insulators were wrapped under the body of the spacecraft to protect the crew from the extreme temperatures of space. Both of these plastics are still staples in the aerospace industry – keeping the Hubble telescope and many other satellites scanning humanity’s charted and uncharted expanse.\n\nPlastics of the Future\n\nPlastics continue to lead the future of materials in aerospace and aviation industries for their durability, precision, and ingenuity. For example, in 2009, the 787-8 Dreamliner made its first maiden flight, becoming the first aircraft to have wings and fuselage made from carbon-fiber plastics. Besides being lightweight, plastics offered increased safety with their resistance to high impact, and their proven ability to withstand chemically harsh environments. This proved plastics an invaluable material when compared to alternative material choices like glass or metal.\n\nStarting in the 1970s, plastics began to play a more crucial part in the defense and military industry, especially in stealth aircraft. The U.S. Air Force saw the potential of plastics when they learned that plastics could absorb radar waves. The added benefit of reduced radar signature makes plastics ideal for creating stealthy aircraft. Plastics continue to contribute to innovation in the defense industry, especially with stealth fabrics and other composite materials which can virtually create invisibility to radars in the near future.\n\nAside from plastics becoming increasingly popular for use in the defense and military sector, high grade plastics like PEEK are highly favorable for space travel due to its ability to function in hostile environments, critical in space exploration. Plastics are even being researched for lightweight radiation shielding for the International Space Station and flights to Mars.\n\nAt AIP, we’re proud to be a continued part of aviation and aerospace advancements and we look forward to engineering solutions for the next frontier.

This article is intended to provide educational insight as to a more sensible alternative for precision-machined, high-strength, durable parts: machined polymers and composites. Let’s explore the benefits of opting for a plastic material versus the more traditional metal materials for precision parts.\n\nBenefits Across the Board\n\nMachined polymer and composite components are the most cost-effective solution when compared to metal.\n\nMachined plastic parts are lighter and therefore provide immense advantages over metals by offering lower lifetime freight costs for equipment that is regularly transported or handled over the product’s lifetime. In bearing and wear applications, polymers provide extensive advantages over metals by allowing for lower power motors for moving parts due to lower frictional properties of polymer wear components compared to metals. The low frictional properties provide for less wear as well. The lower wear rates allow for less maintenance-related downtime. Now your equipment can be online longer producing you more profit. Not only are plastics lighter, but they’re also less expensive than many raw metal materials used for parts. Plastics are produced in faster cycles than metals which helps keep manufacturing costs down as well.\n\nPlastics are more resistant to chemicals than their metal counterparts.\n\nWithout extensive and costly secondary finishes and coatings, metals are easily attacked by many common chemicals. Corrosion due to moisture or even dissimilar metals in close contact is also a major concern with metal components. Polymer and composite materials such as PEEK, Kynar, Teflon, and Polyethylene are impervious to some of the harshest chemicals. This allows for the manufacture and use of precision fluid handling components in the chemical and processing industries which would otherwise dissolve if manufactured from metallic materials. Some polymer materials available for machining can withstand temperatures over 700°F (370°C).\n\nPlastic parts do not require post-treatment finishing efforts, unlike metal.\n\nPolymer and composites are both thermally and electrically insulating. Metallic components require special secondary processing and coating in order to achieve any sort of insulating properties. These secondary processes add cost to metallic components without offering the level of insulation offered by polymer materials. Plastic and composite components are also naturally corrosion resistant and experience no galvanic effects in a dissimilar metal scenario that require sheathing. Unlike metals, plastic materials are compounded with color before machining, eliminating the need for post-treatment finishing efforts such as painting.\n\nLet’s Break It Down by Industry\n\nThe benefits and features of plastic materials over metals discussed above span across multiple industries, showcasing the utility and versatility that plastic brings to the table.\n\nAerospace & Defense\n\nLightweight: Polymer and composite materials are up to ten times lighter than typical metals. A reduction in the weight of parts can have a huge impact on an aerospace company’s bottom line. For every pound of weight reduced on a plane, the airline can realize up to $15k per year in fuel cost reduction.\n\nCorrosion-Resistant: Plastic materials handle far better than metals in chemically harsh environments. This increases the lifespan of the aircraft and avoids costly repairs brought about by corroding metal components an in-turn reducing MRO downtime provides for more operational time per aircraft per year.\n\nInsulating and Radar Absorbent: Polymers are naturally radar absorbent as well as thermally and electrically insulating.\n\nFlame & Smoke Resistances: High-performance thermoplastics meet the stringent flame and smoke resistances required for aerospace applications.\n\nLearn More\n\nMedical & Life Sciences\n\nSterility: In the medical industry, cleanliness is vital when it comes to equipment. Infection is the greatest threat facing hospital patients. Polymer and composite materials are easier to clean and sterilize than metal.\n\nRadiolucency: Radiolucency is the quality of permitting the passage of radiant energy, such as x-rays, while still offering some resistance to it. Surgical instruments and components manufactured from polymer materials allow the surgeon a clear unobstructed view under fluoroscopy. This allows for safer, more precise surgeon outcomes in the OR. Metal instruments impede the surgeon’s view.\n\nLightweight: Plastic and composite surgical components allow orthopedic OEMs to meet ergonomic weight limits for surgical trays. Each metallic instrument adds weight and strain to the surgical team carrying and using metal instruments.\n\nReduced Stress-Shielding: Stress shielding occurs when metal implants and bone don’t become one nor work in unison. In medical-grade polymers like PEEK, however, its similar modulus to bone “fuses” with the bone into a single construct.\n\nLearn More\n\nSpecialized Industrial\n\nHigh Tensile Strength: Several lightweight thermoplastics can match the strength of metals, making them perfect for industrial equipment metal part replacement.\n\nChemical & Corrosion Resistances: Semiconductor equipment and electronics require survival in extreme, high-pressure environments.\n\nFlexibility & Impact Resistance: Polymers are resistant to impact damage, making them less prone to denting or cracking the way that metals do.\n\nExcellent Bearing & Wear Properties: Bearing-grade plastics can withstand repeated friction and wear for your high-load solutions.\n\nLearn More\n\nPower & Energy\n\nWeight, corrosion, and sealing: Plastic materials allow the oil and gas industry to explore deeper depths than ever before by offering tool weight reduction without a loss of strength as well as materials which offer superior sealing attributes.\n\nSuperior Insulation: Naturally insulating plastics provide for superior thermal and electrical insulation over metals, which is a must for power generation equipment that deals with electrical currents.\n\nChemical, Wear & Corrosion Resistances: Plastic components with a strong chemical, wear and corrosion resistances reduce downtime and yield long-lasting performance and reliability.\n\nExtreme Water & Earth Depth Capabilities: These qualities are necessary for high pressure and temperature applications that involve surviving extreme environments.\n\nLearn More\n\nAs you can see, plastics have a variety of unique attributes which place them above metals in terms of utility, cost-effectiveness and flexibility for precision-machined components.

To list just a few of its impressive qualities, Delrin offers great stiffness, flexural modulus, and high tensile and impact strength.\n\nOur latest machining guide discusses what goes into machining Delrin and how its considerations differ from other manufacturing options such as metal machining, injection molding, and 3D printing.\n\nHow does AIP approach Delrin and its machining process? To start, we’ll explain the difference between machining Delrin, a thermoplastic, and machining thermosets.\n\nMachining Thermoplastics vs Thermosets\n\nWe’ve already said that Delrin is a thermoplastic, but what does that mean exactly?\n\nAll polymers can more or less be divided into two categories: thermoplastics and thermosets. The main difference between them is how they react to heat. Thermoplastics like Delrin, for example, melt in the heat, while thermosets remain “set” once they’re formed. Understanding the technical distinction between these types of materials is essential to CNC machining them properly.\n\nWhat type of thermoplastic is Delrin in particular? Acetal homopolymer is a semi–crystalline, engineering thermoplastic.\n\nProperties & Grades of Machined Delrin\n\nThis strong, stiff and hard acetal homopolymer is easy to machine and exhibits dimensional stability and good creep resistance, among several other desirable qualities. Delrin is also known for its superior friction resistance, high tensile strength, and its fatigue, abrasion, solvent and moisture resistance.\n\nThe latter quality allows Delrin to significantly outperform other thermoplastics like Nylon in high moisture or submerged environments without losing high-performance in the process. In other words, Delrin can retain its low coefficient of friction and good wear properties in wet environments.\n\nOne of the main reasons for Delrin’s popularity is its sheer versatility. The above blend of unique qualities makes Delrin broadly applicable to various industries in the medical, aerospace and energy sectors. For example, you can machine Delrin for medical implants and instruments, or for industrial bearings, rollers, gears, and scraper blades. It is ideal for smaller applications at temperatures below 250 °F (121°C) and can have centerline porosity.\n\nSome of the Delrin grades we regularly machine at AIP include:\n\nPTFE-Filled Acetals\n\nPTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) filled grades of Delrin is ideal where impact strength and wear capability are of the highest importance.\n\nGlass-Reinforced Acetals\n\nAcetals that are reinforced with glass have a much higher strength and greater heat resistance than other grades of Delrin.\n\nFDA-Compliant Acetals\n\nThere are FDA-compliant grades of Delrin available for use in medical and food-related applications.\n\nMachining Delrin\n\nMachining Delrin\n\nIt’s true that Delrin is an easy material to work with in terms of machining. It is a very stable material, which makes precise, tight tolerances easier to achieve for this thermoplastic.\n\nWhile machining, keep in mind that Delrin is sensitive to heat at or above 250 °F (121°C).\n\nBalance the material removal as best as you can to keep your dimensions stable.\n\nWe also suggest non-aromatic, air-based coolants to achieve optimum surface finishes and close tolerances. Coolants have the additional benefit of extending tool life as well.\n\nPreventing Contamination\n\nContamination is a serious concern when machining polymer components for technically demanding industries such as medical and life sciences. To ensure the highest level of sanitation down to the sub-molecular level, AIP Precision Machining designs, heat-treats, and machines only plastics, with any sub-manufactured metalwork processed outside our facility.\n\nDelrin Machining Guide: Supportive Information\n\nGeneral Engineering Materials\n\nWant to learn more about AIP’s polymer and composite materials?\n\nor request a quote here.\n\nFollow AIP Precision Machining on Linkedin\n\nFollow AIP Precision Machining on Linkedin\n\nFollow AIP Precision Machining on Linkedin"
