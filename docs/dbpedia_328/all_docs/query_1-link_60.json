        "text": "DISCUSSION\n\nThere have been several reports on the effectiveness of intraoral spacers in radiotherapy. Hollows et al. reported that the use of intraoral spacers made using maxillofacial prosthetic technology in oral radiotherapy reduced the dose to normal tissues around the treatment site, reduced the rate of the early adverse events of mucositis and improved the patients’ oral comfort and eating [6]; in addition, the risk of late adverse events such as radiation caries and osteonecrosis was reduced, leading to the maintenance of the patients’ quality of life [6]. In recent years, mouthpiece-type intraoral spacers created with 3D printers have been reported. Huang et al. demonstrated that the use of a silicone mouthpiece created by a 3D printer based on CT image data for the treatment planning of head and neck radiotherapy provided good occlusal-plane congruence and tongue fixation without inducing oral reflexes, resulting in dose reduction in normal tissues [7].\n\nMouthpiece-type intraoral spacers with or without dental impression material have been available as commercial products; e.g. PreciseBite (CIVCO Medical Solutions) and BiteLok™ (Klarity Medical Products). Some of these spacers can be fixed with dental molds and integrated with thermoplastic shells, but they are not versatile enough to cope with adaptive cases or changes in the oral environment during treatment.\n\nIn several reports using mouthpieces, original in-house mouthpieces were made for each case [5,6]. The mouthpiece designed in the present study is highly versatile and can be easily customized for each patient by using the patient’s dental impression materials. Our new mouthpiece also has a simple structure with no parts, and it is thus easy to handle even for inexperienced users. Depending on the case, additional impression material can be adhered to the side of the mouthpiece, which is useful for lateral compression of the tongue. The gripping part of the mouthpiece is designed to be integrated with the thermoplastic shell, which can reduce intra-fractional set-up errors by suppressing the movement when the patient wears the thermoplastic shell. The gripping part of the mouthpiece acts as a guide when the shell is attached, which is thought to reduce inter-fractional set-up errors. The new mouthpiece can be easily attached and removed in an emergency because the gripping part of the mouthpiece and shell are fixed by simply attaching the thermoplastic shell, whereas commercially available mouthpieces must be fixed with clips and other parts. The air hole in the center of the mouthpiece not only allows patients to breathe through their mouths and vocalize in emergencies but also provides a route for vomit to escape if a patient vomits while wearing the mouthpiece.\n\nThe purpose of using a fixation device in radiotherapy is to maintain a stable treatment position and to ensure reproducibility of the treatment position each time. However, even if the fixation device has excellent fixation accuracy, it cannot be considered an optimal fixation device if a sufficient dose cannot be administered due to X-ray attenuation by the fixation device itself. We evaluated the effect of the X-ray attenuation of the mouthpiece material for three different photon beams (4, 6 and 10 MV) in the present investigation and observed that the relative value of the absorbed dose to water by the mouthpiece material was 0.32% at a measurement depth of 50 mm for the 10-MV photon beam. Considering that the specific gravity of polypropylene is only slightly different from that of water, the influence of the mouthpiece material on the X-ray attenuation is small.\n\nDental impression materials are frequently used to make dental molds for mouthpieces and oral spacers in head and neck radiotherapy. Dental impression materials made of agar, alginate and silicone are commonly used. We compared the artifacts and differences in HU values on CT images of several commercially available dental impression materials herein. The results revealed that an alginate material had the lowest HU value at 377.1 HU. However, dental impression materials made of alginate are not as hard as those made of silicon because they contain a high amount of water during preparation. On the other hand, silicone dental impression materials are known to take impressions with high reliability [8]. Our present findings demonstrated that the HU values of silicon material varied widely from 574.2 HU to 3183.9 HU.\n\nWe next compared the changes in the PDD of the 4-MV photon beam incident on a water-equivalent phantom with a plate of dental impression material placed inside in the treatment planning system. The PDD curves of the rear surfaces of the dental impression material varied from −0.94% to −2.90%. The dose-calculation algorithm that we used in this study is known to cause calculation errors in high-density regions such as bones and metals [9]. It should be noted that the presence of high-density materials not only causes uncertainty about the HU value due to artifacts but also contributes to dose calculation uncertainty in the calculation algorithm. We therefore decided to use the silicon material with the lowest HU value in our new fixation system ( ).\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Human Health Series report 31 described the uncertainty of treatment position set-ups for various patient fixation systems used in radiotherapy, comparing each anatomical region. The uncertainty values of the treatment position for head and neck radiotherapy using thermoplastic shells are approx. 2.0 mm and 3.0 mm, respectively [10]. It has been reported that the combination of a mouthpiece and a thermoplastic shell can improve the reproducibility of treatment position set-up accuracy; Tryggestad et al. compared several patient fixation systems in combination and found that the inter-fractional set-up error of the mouthpiece-thermoplastic shell combination was minimal at 2.1 ± 1.0 mm, making it useful in stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) where treatment position set-up accuracy is required [11]. Willner et al. conducted a prospective study on the set-up accuracy of radiotherapy in the head and neck region using a fixation system with a bite block and head and neck support. Their results showed that the maximum set-up error was 3.1 mm, and the use of bite blocks was useful for improving the set-up accuracy and reproducibility of accurate treatment positions [12]. Doi et al. analyzed the positional matching data of set-ups based on skin marks or thermoplastic shell marks and those based on cone beam CT for the usefulness of an intraoral mouthpiece in intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) of the head and neck region. They reported that the set-up error was as small as 2.42 mm, and they concluded that the use of intraoral spacers was useful in reducing random and systematic errors in set-up [13].\n\nIn the present study, we evaluated how well the combination of a mouthpiece’s gripping part and a thermoplastic shell suppressed the patient’s head motion inside the fixation device under the verbal instructions of head motion. This is a different condition from actual radiotherapy and from previous reports on the use of intraoral spacers. However, our results demonstrated that the fixation accuracy with the mouthpiece was sufficient even for intentionally generated head motion. The use of a fixation system that combines the new mouthpiece and a thermoplastic shell will lead to a reduction in intra-fractional set-up errors during actual radiotherapy.\n\nIt has been noted that in radiotherapy of the head and neck region, it is necessary to reduce the dose to the organ at risk in the oral cavity and to reduce the risk of side effects, which is also important from the viewpoint of improving patients’ quality of life [14–17]. Thus, reducing the oral-tissue side effects that occur during radiotherapy is of great benefit to patients. Our present findings revealed that the mouthpiece was able to create a distance of approx. 28 mm from the hard palate to the anterior part of the dorsal surface of the tongue. In radiotherapy of the maxillary and sinus regions, the oral cavity may be included in the high-dose region. Even in such cases, the use of this mouthpiece can maintain the distance between the treatment site and the tongue surface, leading to a dose reduction in the organ at risk. However, the root of the tongue and the soft palate were in contact in all cases, and the distance from the posterior pharyngeal wall to the root of the tongue was not changed with or without the mouthpiece (data not shown). This mouthpiece does not provide spacing ability in these areas.\n\nWe believe that our fixation system in this study is useful as a tongue depressor, in particular, in the radiotherapy of tongue cancer or maxillary sinus cancer. Our system may be also useful for improving the fixation accuracy by integrating the gripping part and the thermoplastic shell in patients with brain tumor or head and neck cancer. However, in some cases, the tongue depressor function of the mouthpiece in this study may not be sufficient in the areas around the soft palate or the posterior pharyngeal wall, and this should be carefully considered in the treatment of nasopharyngeal or mesopharyngeal tumors."
