        "text": "There’s no doubt that plastics have become more and more popular in modern medicine. Short lead times are essential in this industry, and both 3D additive manufacturing and CNC machining provide fast production times. When is your medical application better suited for 3D printing, though, and when does precision plastic machining have the upper hand in plastic manufacturing?\n\nThere are a few key differences and similarities between these types of plastic manufacturing that you should keep in mind for your medical applications. It helps to have a basic understanding of each manufacturing process, first.\n\nSubtractive vs Additive Manufacturing\n\nSubtractive Manufacturing\n\nCNC machining is a type of “subtractive manufacturing.” This means that the process generally begins with a solid block of plastic material which is cut or shaped into the desired product through “removing” excess material.\n\nWhile CNC machining requires more initial setup than 3D printing, it offers repeatability, accuracy for both large and small parts, and a wide range of polymers and composites to choose from, as well as a variety of surface finishes. It scales easily between one-time jobs and high-volume production.\n\nAdditive Manufacturing\n\n3D printing is “additive manufacturing,” which means the initial material is built layer by layer, rather than removed as in subtractive manufacturing. 3D printing creates three-dimensional objects from reading a digital file’s blueprint. When working with plastics, you’re primarily talking about FDM 3D printing. While FDM is widely considered the most quick and cost-effective way of producing custom thermoplastic parts and prototypes, it also has the lowest dimensional accuracy and resolution of any other 3D printing technology.\n\nAnother option for additive manufacturing is SLS 3D printing, which fuses together the particles of thermoplastic polymer powders. This version of 3D printing has higher accuracy than FDM; however, it comes at the cost of longer lead times, which can be expensive in the medical industry.\n\nChoosing the Right Technology for Your Medical Application\n\nAs always, choosing the correct technology is dependent on your particular medical application. What you value in your completed product can help determine which style of plastics manufacturing works best for your needs. Some of your considerations should be:\n\nMaterial Consultancy\n\nBoth CNC machining and additive manufacturing work with a wide variety of thermoplastics, but those plastics react to manufacturing in different ways. Some materials machine more easily than others, while certain thermoplastic materials are more prone to warping in 3D printing.\n\nYour manufacturer should be familiar with your chosen material and be able to discuss the process of machining or 3D printing it with you. At AIP Precision Machining, we have 35+ years of material and machining expertise and we include consultancy as an integral part of our manufacturing process.\n\nMechanical Properties\n\nCNC machining ultimately provides greater dimensional accuracy and better performing properties than additive manufacturing. Machined thermoplastics possess both great mechanical and thermal properties with fully isotropic behavior. If your product requires unique, strong design with critical tolerances, then FDM 3D printing may not be not ideal; this type of printing is inherently anisotropic, meaning it isn’t the best option for mechanically critical components.\n\nMedical applications, in particular, have unique considerations that ought to be taken into account, both for choosing your initial material and determining how it ought to be manufactured.\n\nPrecision Tolerances\n\nPrecision CNC machining provides close tolerances for your applications with a fine, burr-free finish. In fact, 3D printed products for the medical field regularly go into CNC machining post-processing as a secondary step in order to accomplish better tolerances or a finishing cut, as FDM parts tend to have visible layer lines.\n\nExtreme tolerances up to 0.002mm can be produced by AIP Precision Machining, which can be necessary in demanding industries such as the medical, aerospace and energy markets.\n\nQuick Turnaround\n\nBoth CNC machining and 3D printing have quick turnarounds, especially when compared to injection molding. Machining designs are crafted on the same computer applications used by 3D printers, so there is no cost associated with design changes for either type of plastics manufacturing. However, when time is truly critical, 3D printed parts can be delivered in 24 hours. Quality and functional usefulness, in this case, may be sacrificed for expediency.\n\nAIP Precision Machining can guarantee your complex polymers machined in as little as 10 business days, with quality assured from concept to completion.\n\nVolume of Production\n\nSmaller batches, such as 1-10 plastic components, can be more cost-effective if produced with additive manufacturing. This is because using a non-standard blank size increases the cost of machining. Plastic machining, however, easily scales between small and large outputs.\n\nIf you require a high-quality product that possesses extreme mechanical and thermal strength, it is worth precision machining for that reason alone.\n\nThe Final Consideration? Experience.\n\nThe medical field often has no room for error when it comes to implants, spinal devices and orthopedic equipment. This is why—no matter what type of plastic manufacturing you choose—you want to be sure you’re working with an expert who understands the importance of sterilization, biocompatibility, and other traits that may be necessary for your application.\n\nAIP is FDA and ISO 13485:2016 registered and has been audited by some of the most stringent OEMs in the orthopedic and medical device industries. We process our plastics with strict hygienic procedures.\n\nWhoever you work with, be sure they understand the needs of your industry and have the experience to prove it.\n\nClick here to learn more about the utility of each technology with regard to precision efficiency, materials and more.\n\nOr, request a quote with AIP Precision Machining here.\n\nAn Informational Brief on Polymer Machining\n\nOne of the high-performance thermoplastics that AIP works with is ULTEM: a PEI, or polyetherimide. ULTEM was developed by General Electric Plastics Division (Now SABIC) back in the early 1980s. Polyetherimide (PEI) is an amorphous, amber-to-transparent thermoplastic.\n\nAmong other uses, ULTEM is popularly used in medical instrument components, aircraft interiors, missile and defense-related components, electrical insulation parts, and semiconductor equipment components.\n\nAIP has over 35 years of experience machining complex components from ULTEM and various other thermoplastic materials. We are providing this Machining ULTEM as yet another insightful technical brief about our polymer component manufacturing process, and how it differs from that of metal machining or injection molding.\n\nPlastic CNC Machining\n\nBefore discussing the process of machining ULTEM, it’s important to understand exactly what plastic machining is.\n\nCNC (Computer Numerical Control) machining is a process in the manufacturing sector that involves the use of computers to control machine tools. In the case of plastic machining, this involves the precise removal of layers from a plastic sheet, rod, tube or near net molded blank.\n\nThe early history of CNC machining is almost as complex as a modern CNC system. The earliest version of computer numerical control (CNC) technology was developed shortly after World War II as a reliable, repeatable way to manufacture more accurate and complex parts for the aircraft industry. Numerical control—the precursor to CNC—was developed by John Parsons as a method of producing integrally stiffened aircraft skins.\n\nParsons, while working at his father’s Traverse City, Michigan-based Parsons Corp., had previously collaborated on the development of a system for producing helicopter rotor blade templates. Using an IBM 602A multiplier to calculate airfoil coordinates, and inputting this data to a Swiss jig borer, it was possible to produce templates from data on punched cards.\n\nParsons’ work lead to numerous Air Force research projects at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) starting in 1949. Following extensive research and development, an experimental milling machine was constructed at MIT’s Servomechanisms Laboratory.\n\nDue to the many different kinds of polymers and composites, it’s important to have strong technical expertise of polymer materials when machining plastic components; some plastics are brittle, for example, while others cut similarly to metal. The challenge of plastics is their wide range of mechanical and thermal properties which result in varying behavior when machined. Therefore, it’s important to understand the polymer structure and properties of ULTEM if you’re machining it.\n\nThermoplastics vs Thermosets\n\nWhen it comes to polymers, you have two basic types: thermoplastics and thermosets. It’s crucial to know which one you’re working with due to distinct differences between how these two main polymer categories react to chemicals and temperature.\n\nThermoplastics soften when heated and become more fluid as additional heat is applied. The curing process is completely reversible as no chemical bonding takes place. This characteristic allows thermoplastics to be remolded and recycled without negatively affecting the material’s physical properties.\n\nThey possess the following properties:\n\n-Good Resistance to Creep\n\n-Soluble in Certain Solvents\n\n-Swell in Presence of Certain Solvents\n\n-Allows for Plastic Deformation when Heated\n\nThermosets plastics contain polymers that cross-link together during the curing process to form an irreversible chemical bond. The cross-linking process eliminates the risk of the product re-melting when heat is applied, making thermosets ideal for high-heat applications such as electronics and appliances.\n\nThey possess the following properties:\n\n-High Resistance to Creep\n\n-Cannot Melt\n\n-Insoluble\n\n-Rarely Swell in Presence of Solvents\n\nPhenolic, Bakelite, Vinyl Ester and Epoxy materials would be considered examples of a thermoset, while ULTEM, PEEK, DELRIN and Polycarbonate materials are examples of thermoplastics.\n\nThe thermoplastic category of polymers is further categorized into Amorphous and Crystalline polymers per the figure below:\n\nULTEM is considered an amorphous, high-performance thermoplastic. Most amorphous polymers are thermoform capable, translucent and easily bonded with adhesives or solvents.\n\nVarious Grades of Machined ULTEM\n\nULTEM PEI (polyetherimide) is a high-strength amorphous polymer. PEI has more than just excellent heat and flame resistance. It can perform continuously up to 340°F thanks to its high flammability rating. That’s not all, though: this polymer is also hydrolysis resistant and highly acid-resistant. ULTEM PEI also outperforms both Nylon and DELRIN with the highest dielectric properties of thermoplastic materials.\n\nWhile ULTEM is relatively chemical resistant relative to lower end amorphous polymers, you will need to carefully assess the chemical compatibility for the application. This material is also more notch sensitive than RADEL PPSU.\n\nThere’s more than one particular type of ULTEM PEI you can machine, and each has slightly different properties for perfecting this material’s use in different applications.\n\nHere are two grades of ULTEM PEI we machine regularly at AIP Precision Machining:\n\nULTEM 1000\n\nULTEM 1000 is an unfilled grade of ULTEM PEI. This is considered the “virgin” or “neat” grade of the resin… this basically means no-fillers. It’s well suited to interior aircraft components thanks to its impressive flame resistance and limited oxygen index. Its resistance to UV and gamma radiation and low NBS smoke evolution, low thermal conductivity, and ability to retain 85% of its tensile strength at 10,000 hours of immersion in boiling water make it useful for a variety of structural food processing components. ULTEM 1000 is also FDA, USDA, and NSF-compliant, as well as USP Class VI-compliant.\n\nULTEM 2300\n\nULTEM 2300 is a 30% glass-reinforced grade of ULTEM PEI. This gives the high-performance polymer greater tensile strength and rigidity than ULTEM 1000, plus greater dimensional stability, meaning less movement with temperature or load changes. It possesses low thermal conductivity and excellent electrical insulation properties. Additionally, it reacts well to autoclave sterilizations, making it useful for reusable medical applications where repeated cycles are required. ULTEM 2300 is commonly used for structural components where light weight is valuable such as found in many aerospace and defense-related components. ULTEM 2300 is a common direct replacement for aluminum as it has a similar coefficient of thermal expansion to 6061-T6.\n\nMachining ULTEM\n\nAnnealing ULTEM\n\nULTEM can be received in the form of rods, sheets, tube or film. Stress-relieving before machining through an annealing process is crucial, as it reduces the likelihood that surface cracks and internal stresses will occur from the heat generated. This also helps prevent any warping or distortion of your plastic materials.\n\nIf the machine shop you are working with does not have a computer controlled annealing oven for plastics, then “head for dee hills” as they are obviously not ULTEM machining experts.\n\nMachining ULTEM\n\nGlass-reinforced ULTEM will require coolants during drilling operations, as they are especially notch sensitive. Non-aromatic, water soluble coolants are most suitable for ideal surface finishes and close tolerances. These include pressurized air and spray mists. Coolants have the additional benefit of extending tool life as well.\n\nMany metal shops use petroleum-based coolants, but these types of fluids attack ULTEM. Many past experiences have shown parts going to customer without cracks, only to develop cracks over time due to exposure to metal machine shop fluids. Be sure to use a facility like AIP who machines polymers and only polymers.\n\nAnother difference between glass-reinforced ULTEM and non-filled ULTEM is that non-reinforced thermoplastics can be machined with high-speed steel cutting tools. You’ll want hard metal tools for reinforced materials.\n\nPreventing Contamination\n\nContamination is a serious concern when machining polymer components for technically demanding industries such as aerospace and medical. To ensure the highest level of sanitation down to the sub-molecular level, AIP Precision Machining designs, heat-treats and machines only plastics, with any sub-manufactured metalwork processed outside our facility.\n\nULTEM Machining Guide: Supportive Information\n\nMedical Sector Biomaterials Guide\n\nEnergy Sector Materials Guide\n\nAerospace Sector Materials Guide\n\nAmorphous Materials\n\nStrict Hygienic Procedures for Precision Machining\n\nIt’s no secret that cleanliness and sterilization are crucial for applications in the medical industry. Any manufacturer you hire for machining your plastic component should be aware of this, and taking actions to prevent any contamination from taking place.\n\nHere are three ways you can ensure that your medical application is being precision machined by a manufacturer committed to following strict hygienic procedures.\n\n1) Check Industry Standards\n\nEnsuring sterilization starts with picking the right manufacturing company, and you’ll want to be sure they take the matter of contamination seriously. To start, check their commitment to quality management and industry standards.\n\nAll product manufacturing companies must follow industry standards like International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Before you work with a manufacturing company for your medical application, look at their certifications.\n\nFor example, ISO 13485 specifies requirements for a quality management system where a company demonstrates it can provide medical devices and related services to consistently meet customer and regulatory requirements. ISO 9001 focuses on meeting customer expectations and continually delivering satisfaction, plus reflects constant improvement from the company.\n\nIf the manufacturer you are interested in using does not have any of the above standards, then you may want to ask them why.\n\nHere at AIP Precision Machining, we have been successfully audited by some of the most stringent OEMs in the orthopedic and medical device industries, and are ISO 13485:2016., ISO 9001:2015 , and FDA registered.\n\n2) Plastic Machining isn’t Metal Machining\n\nBe wary of any manufacturer who machines both plastics and metals in the same facility. The tiniest sliver of metal embedded in a plastic part can have widespread ramifications, such as an unexpected electrical problem in the medical device.\n\nAdditionally, it’s common for metal machining companies to use oil-based cutting fluids. Any equipment that machines metal, then, can contaminate your plastic parts with those fluids. Many plastic materials are especially sensitive to those petroleum-based liquids, and they can degrade when in contact with them; others are hydroscopic and will absorb the oils.\n\nIt should be noted that plastic parts manufactured using equipment that machines metal parts will not meet FDA-approval, or the other industry standards mentioned above. The safest way to avoid this is to hire a plastics expert, not a metal machining company.\n\nAIP takes the matter of sterilization seriously, and ensures the highest level of sanitation down to the sub-molecular level for its products. By designing, stress relieving and machining only plastics, AIP significantly reduces the threat of metallic cross contamination and therefore allows for the highest hygienic products possible.\n\n3) Look for Experience\n\nThe most important factor to take into account overall is experience. Your supplier should be familiar with the types of polymers and composites you need machined, and should additionally know the best machining process for your application.\n\nFor the medical industry, you want to know that your manufacturer is experienced with the complex needs of your applications. For example, if your components are going to come into contact with body tissue or fluids, then they must be biocompatible per ISO 10993.\n\nWhich is to say: If you’re machining implants, your plastics will require different needs than if you’re machining reusable surgical instruments. Both require, however, careful attention to detail. A surgical instrument must be designed with sterilization compatibility for regular cycles in mind, while an implant requires biocompatibility to be safe for use.\n\nBe sure that your manufacturer is familiar with the processes that come with your application, and check that they’ve done it before.\n\nWith 35+ years of experience, AIP is well acquainted with precision machining for the medical industry and guarantees careful material selection and processing for your medical applications.\n\nThe #1 Best Way to Avoid Contamination?\n\nOverall, the best thing you can do to avoid contamination is to hire a plastic manufacturer with the experience and the credentials to complete your project to the highest standards of quality possible. Keeping the above three factors in mind will help you do just that.\n\nTo ask about AIP Precision Machining’s capabilities for precision machining medical applications, please contact us.\n\nAn Informational Brief on Polymer Machining\n\nThe recent popularity of PEEK (polyetheretherketone) in complex industries such as Aerospace & Defense and Medical & Life Sciences is well documented, and for good reason: this lightweight thermoplastic bears properties that make it ideal for a variety of specialized applications. This versatility makes PEEK equally capable of being used for implants and custom medical devices or machined lightweight aircraft components.\n\nWhat is less known, however, is the process that goes into machining this plastic material. With over 35 years of experience machining this thermoplastic material, we at AIP have written a brief introduction to machining PEEK. We hope this gives you some insight into our polymer machining process, and how it differs from that of metal machining or injection molding.\n\nPlastic CNC Machining\n\nBefore discussing the process of machining PEEK, it’s important to understand exactly what plastic machining is.\n\nCNC (Computer Numerical Control) machining is a process in the manufacturing sector that involves the use of computers to control machine tools. In the case of plastic machining, this involves the precise removal of layers from a plastic material. The technique of utilizing drilling tools to carve plastics was introduced by MIT during the 1950s, and because this process is computer-controlled, products with extremely precise tolerances can be achieved.\n\nDue to the many different kinds of polymers and composites, it’s important to have strong technical expertise of polymer materials when machining plastic components; some plastics are brittle, for example, while others cut similarly to metal. The challenge of plastics is their wide range of mechanical properties and varying behavior when machined. Therefore, it’s important to understand the polymer structure of PEEK if you’re machining it.\n\nThermoplastics vs Thermosets\n\nWhen it comes to polymers, you have two basic types: thermoplastics and thermosets. It’s crucial to know which one you’re working with due to distinct differences between how those polymers react to heat and temperature.\n\nThermoplastics are capable of being repeatedly softened and pliable when temperature increases, meaning that when heat is applied, that results in a physical change for the polymer. They possess the following properties:\n\n– Good Resistance to Creep\n\n– May Melt Before Turning to Gaseous State\n\n– Soluble in Certain Solvents\n\n– Swell in Presence of Certain Solvents\n\n– Allows for Plastic Deformation when Heated\n\nThermosets, in contrast, turn into an infusible and insoluble material when cured by application of heat or chemical means, making for poor elasticity. They possess the following properties:\n\n– High Resistance to Creep\n\n– Cannot Melt\n\n– Insoluble\n\n– Rarely Swell in Presence of Solvents\n\nPhenolic materials would be considered examples of a thermoset, while PEEK is an example of a thermoplastic.\n\nIn particular, PEEK is considered a semi-crystalline, high-performance thermoplastic. This gives it enough elasticity to be machined to various custom designs, with strong mechanical properties that provide resistance to fatigue and stress-cracking, as well as a good structure for bearing, wear, and structural applications.\n\nIndustrial Grade vs Medical Grade PEEK Machining\n\nDepending on your application, you’ll want to machine either industrial-grade PEEK or medical-grade PEEK.\n\nIndustrial-grade PEEK is a strong, flame-retardant and abrasion resistant thermoplastic with high impact strength and a low coefficient of friction. It’s known for retaining its mechanical properties, even at elevated temperatures. As suggested by its name, this grade is most commonly used in aerospace, automotive, chemical, electronics, petroleum, as well as food and beverage industries.\n\nMedical-grade PEEK adds biocompatibility per ISO 10993, high chemical resistance, and sterilization compatibilities to the above list of qualities. In addition, this thermoplastic is radiolucent, meaning it is not visible under X-ray, MRI or CT. Medical-grade PEEK includes polymers suitable for implants, such as PEEK Optima and Zeniva PEEK, which can stay in contact with blood or tissue indefinitely while mimicking the stiffness of bone. Other variations of medical-grade PEEK can be used for custom medical components and applications, such as articulating joints and spinal devices.\n\nMachining PEEK\n\nAnnealing PEEK\n\nMost shops receive PEEK in the form of rods of various lengths, ranging from 6mm to 150mm in diameter. Stress-relieving before machining through an annealing process is crucial, as it reduces the likelihood that surface cracks and internal stresses will occur from the heat generated. Additional benefits of annealing include increased levels of crystallinity and the opportunity to limit dimensional changes.\n\nIf your PEEK components will undergo long stretches of machining time, it is likely you will require additional intermediate annealing steps to assure the ability to maintain critically tight tolerances and flatness.\n\nMachining Industrial-Grade & Medical-Grade PEEK\n\nBoth industrial-grade and most medical-grade PEEK machine similarly, save for PEEK reinforced with carbon fiber. Silicon carbide cutting tools work well for natural PEEK, while diamond tools work well for PEEK reinforced with carbon-fiber.\n\nFor medical-grade PEEK applications, the best way to avoid jeopardizing the biocompatibility of the material is to machine dry. However, PEEK doesn’t dissipate heat the way that metals do, so often a coolant is necessary. In that case, air is the coolant option least likely to affect medical-grade PEEK’s biocompatibility. Any chips that are a result of machining medical-grade PEEK can be reused for industrial applications.\n\nPreventing Contamination\n\nContamination is a serious concern when machining polymer components for technically demanding industries such as aerospace and medical. To ensure the highest level of sanitation down to the sub-molecular level, AIP Precision Machining designs, heat-treats, and machines only plastics, with any sub-manufactured metalwork processed outside our facility.\n\nPEEK Machining Guide: Guidelines\n\n(Courtesy of Invibio)\n\nNatural PEEK\n\nCarbon-Fiber-Reinforced PEEK\n\nblank Sawing blank Preheat material to 120 C degrees Clearance angle—degrees 15 to 30 15 to 30 Rake angle—degrees 0 to 5 10 to 15 Cutting speed—m/min 500 to 800 200 to 300 Pitch—mm 3 to 5 3 to 5 Drilling blank Preheat material to 120 C degrees Clearance angle—degrees 5 to 10 6 Rake angle—degrees 10 to 30 5 to 10 Cutting speed—m/min 50 to 200 80 to 100 Feed rate—mm/rev 0.1 to 0.3 0.1 to 0.3 Milling blank No material preheat is necessary Clearance angle—degrees 5 to 10 15 to 30 Rake angle—degrees 10 to 30 10 to 15 Cutting Speed—m/min 50 to 200 200 to 300 Turning blank No material preheat is necessary Clearance angle—degrees 6 to 8 6 to 8 Rake angle—degrees 0 to 5 2 to 8 Cutting speed—m/min 250 to 500 150 to 200 Feed rate—mm/rev 0.1 to 0.5 0.1 to 0.5\n\nPEEK Machining Guide: PEEK Variants\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nWhen it comes to choosing a thermoplastic material for your medical applications, product durability, agency approval, biocompatibility and cleanliness aren’t just desirable—they’re essential. Beyond even that, though, a host of other factors must be considered when determining which high-performance plastic or composite material to use for an implant, orthopedic surgical guides, body fluid contact components, spinal devices, or surgical instruments. Medical product applications are becoming more and more advanced due to critical performance and alignment requirements as well as the need for radiolucency to support minimally invasive procedures. Therefore, the choice of plastic material specified for a given application as well as a manufacturer with battle-hardened experience is the critical first step in your decision process.\n\nAIP has well over three decades of expertise with thermoplastic materials, and understands how plastics react when machined. We are one of a very select few companies able to hold incredibly tight tolerances in plastic parts. AIP has been successfully audited by some of the most stringent OEMs in the orthopedic and medical device industries, and are ISO 13485:2016, ISO 9001:2015 and FDA registered.\n\nHere are just a few initial, yet critical considerations that take place when we determine the thermoplastic to best suit your particular medical or life science application.\n\nBiocompatibility\n\nIf your components are going to come into contact with body tissue or fluids, then those components must be biocompatible per ISO 10993; if the manufacturer you are working with is not familiar with this standard and cannot provide you with this certification for the material, then move on to a manufacturer with medical industry knowledge. This is especially true if the polymers will undergo long-term contact with body tissues and fluid, such as when used as an implant. Polymers can undergo degradation due to biochemical and mechanical factors in the body, which results in ionic attack and formation of hydroxyl ions and dissolved oxygen. In turn, this can lead to tissue irritation, inflammation, and other reactions with body-like corrosion, wear and potential death. Due to this, very few polymers are available as medical grade for medical application, with an even smaller amount considered a candidate for implants.\n\nAIP Precision Machining includes machined PEEK implants among its many capabilities for custom medical applications precisely due to PEEK’s biocompatibility. PEEK is also inert to body fluids, making it exceptional for bone surgery as well as areas of traumatology and orthopaedics. Another valuable trait of PEEK is that this material has a very similar modulus to that of human bone. The similar modulus to bone reduces the potential for stress shielding. Stress shielding is common with metallic implants whereby the metal implant and bone do not become one nor work in unison to form a single construct. By using Invibio’s PEEK Optima or Solvay’s Zeniva PEEK as an implant material, the bone and PEEK will grow into a single construct mimicking the bone’s natural tendency to repair the fracture or fusion.\n\nSterilization Compatibility\n\nPlastics react differently to various sterilization methods, and if a product is not a single-use device and involves body tissue and fluid contact, then it may regularly undergo sterilization. The usual sterilization methods are radiation (gamma/e-beam), chemical (ETO), or autoclave (steam). ETO is rarely a concern, but radiation and autoclaving both require resistance from plastics. Several radiation resistant thermoplastics are:\n\n– PEEK\n\n– PEI (Polyetherimide)\n\n– PES\n\n– PSU (Polysulfone)\n\n– PPSU (Polyphenylsulfone)\n\n– UHMWPE\n\nWhen it comes to autoclaving, the best polymers for resistance are PPSU and PEEK, with both capable of handling exposure to thousands of cycles.\n\nAIP takes the matter of sterilization seriously and ensures the highest level of sanitation down to the sub-molecular level for its products. By designing, stress relieving and machining only plastics, AIP significantly reduces the threat of metallic cross-contamination and therefore allows for the highest hygienic products possible.\n\nChemical Resistance\n\nA polymer can be exposed to plenty of disinfection chemicals in a hospital. That exposure can deteriorate plastics, and negatively affect part performance. Polymer chains can be affected by isopropyl alcohol, bleaches, and peroxides. Semi-crystalline polymers like PP, PE, PTFE and PEEK can be expected to have better chemical resistance than amorphous polymers like ABS and PC. However, it’s important to check the performance to be certain of resistances, as exceptions can take place.\n\nWith decades of experience working with thermoplastics, AIP guarantees extreme chemical resistance in its material selection for your medical applications.\n\nElectrical & Thermal Properties\n\nDielectric strength and thermal resistance are necessary for medical devices enclosed in areas that require high heat resistance. Thermoplastics such as PC (Polycarbonate), PC blends, PPS (polyphenylene sulfide), PEI and PS (polystyrene) blends have electrical properties that perform well, some even at elevated temperatures.\n\nAIP’s material library includes thermoplastics that exhibit extreme thermal performance, and we are familiar with machining them in applications for medical life & sciences.\n\nMechanical Properties\n\nProperties such as tensile and compressive strength, wear resistance, impact strength, and bending stiffness also must be considered when choosing your thermoplastic. Engineered thermoplastics such as PC, PEEK, PPSU, POM, PEI and reinforced grades of these same materials (glass, aramid and carbon fillers) perform very well in this respect, making them ideal for a variety of climate conditions, such as during transportation.\n\nAIP provides thermoplastics that show extreme wear resistance, x-ray visibility or invisibility and high structural performance.\n\nThese are just a few of the many considerations that take place when choosing the right plastic for your medical applications. AIP offers you our full material consultancy from concept to completion, so that together, we find the right thermoplastic for your projects.\n\nor request a quote here.\n\nA Brief History of CNC Machining & Plastic Machining\n\nAn important part of working with any company is understanding what they do; at AIP Precision Machining, plastic CNC machining is what we’ve done best for the past 35 years.\n\nCNC (Computer Numerical Control) machining is a process in the manufacturing sector that involves the use of computers to control machine tools. In the case of plastic machining, this involves the precise removal of layers from a plastic sheet, rod, tube or near net molded blank. This subtractive manufacturing differs from additive manufacturing techniques, such as 3D printing.\n\nThe History of CNC Machining\n\nThe early history of CNC machining is almost as complex as a modern CNC system. The earliest version of computer numerical control (CNC) technology was developed shortly after World War II as a reliable, repeatable way to manufacture more accurate and complex parts for the aircraft industry. Numerical control—the precursor to CNC—was developed by John Parsons as a method of producing integrally stiffened aircraft skins.\n\nParsons, while working at his father’s Traverse City, Michigan-based Parsons Corp., had previously collaborated on the development of a system for producing helicopter rotor blade templates. Using an IBM 602A multiplier to calculate airfoil coordinates, and inputting this data to a Swiss jig borer, it was possible to produce templates from data on punched cards.\n\nParsons’ work lead to numerous Air Force research projects at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) starting in 1949. Following extensive research and development, an experimental milling machine was constructed at MIT’s Servomechanisms Laboratory.\n\nCNC machining can be used for a wide variety of materials, but at AIP Precision Machining, we solely machine polymers and composites. This significantly reduces the threat of metallic cross contamination in our products, allowing us to provide the most hygienic devices and components for our clients.\n\nThe Complexity of Polymer Machining\n\nThere are benefits to machining polymer components over metallic materials, but it’s a mistake to assume both machine the same way. Due to the many different kinds of polymers and composites, it’s important to have strong technical expertise of polymer materials when machining plastic components; some plastics are brittle, for example, while others cut similarly to metal.\n\nThe challenge of plastics is their wide range of mechanical and thermal properties which result in varying behavior when machined. Therefore, it’s important to understand the polymer structure and properties of a material if you’re machining it. Having expert material knowledge is essential for this reason, which is why AIP has it as one of our core offerings.\n\nOne example of this would be knowing if you’re machining a thermoset or a thermoplastic.\n\nHere are a few polymer machining guides that discuss the specifics of plastic machining various materials:\n\nPEEK Machining\n\nULTEM Machining\n\nTORLON Machining\n\nRADEL Machining\n\nWant to learn more about AIP Precision Machining’s capabilities?\n\nExplore our extensive plastic machining capabilities here, or if you like, you can contact us to get a quote here.\n\nWith over two decades of experience machining precision plastic and composite parts for the Aerospace & Defense industry, AIP Precision Machining knows that weight and strength are critical for your flight-ready hardware. That’s why we’ve carefully selected, machined and tested all our thermoplastic materials to various aerospace and defense industry standards. Our lightweight polymers and composites have stable chemical and corrosion resistance, as well as improved strength to weight ratios when compared to exotic alloys and non-ferrous metals. AIP’s polymer and composite materials maintain their properties even at high temperatures.\n\nHere are some specific examples of thermoplastic materials commonly used in the Aerospace & Defense industry.\n\nULTEM – PEI\n\nULTEM has one of the highest dielectric strengths of any thermoplastic material. This enables ULTEM to work very efficiently as an electrical insulator. Being resistant to both hot water and steam, ULTEM can withstand repeated cycles in a steam autoclave and operate in high service temperature environments (340F or 170C). ULTEM also has one of the lowest rates of thermal conductivity among thermoplastics, allowing machined ULTEM parts to act as thermal insulators. ULTEM is FDA and NSF approved for both food and medical contact, making it an excellent choice for aircraft galley equipment such as ovens, microwaves and hot or cold beverage dispensing systems. Finally, its UL94 V-O flame rating with very low smoke output makes this material ideal for aircraft interior components.\n\nCELAZOLE – PBI\n\nCELAZOLE provides the highest mechanical properties of any thermoplastic above 400F (204C) and offers a continuous use operating temperature of 750F (399C). This impressive lightweight material has outstanding high-temperature mechanical properties for use in aircraft engines and other HOT section areas. These properties include good fatigue resistance, compressive strength, wear resistance and electrical insulation. After being submerged in hydraulic fluid at 200°F for thirty days, CELAZOLE retains 100% tensile strength.\n\nRYTON – PPS\n\nRYTON’s inherent fire retardancy, thermal stability, and corrosion resistance make it perfectly suited for aerospace applications, while its dimensional stability means even the most intricate parts can be manufactured from RYTON with very tight tolerances. RYTON is typically used for injection molded parts; however, there is limited availability of extruded rod and plate for machining.\n\nVESPEL or DURATRON – PI\n\nLike RYTON, VESPEL is dimensionally stable and has fantastic temperature resistance. It can operate uninterrupted from cryogenic temperatures to 550°F, with intermittent to 900°F. Thanks to its high wear and friction resistance, VESPEL performs with excellence and longevity in severe aerospace environments. VESPEL is a trademark material of DuPont and can be provided in direct formed blanks or finished parts directly from DuPont. AIP has provided precision machined components from DuPont manufactured rod and plate stock. You can typically find VESPEL used in high temperature and high-speed bearing and wear applications, such as stator bushings.\n\nTORLON or DURATRON – PAI\n\nDURATRON PAI’s extremely low coefficient of linear thermal expansion and high creep resistance deliver excellent dimensional stability over its entire service range. PAI is an amorphous material with a Tg (glass transition temperature) of 537°F (280°C). DURATRON PAI stock shapes are post-cured using procedures developed jointly by BP Amoco under the TORLON trade name and Quadrant under the DURATRON trade name. PAI components fabricated from extruded shapes that require optimization of chemical resistance and/or wear performance often receive a post-curing cycle. You can find TORLON parts in structural, wear and electrical aerospace applications.\n\nTECHTRON – PPS\n\nTECHTRON has essentially zero moisture absorption, which allows products manufactured from this material to maintain extreme dimensional and density stability. PPS is highly chemical resistant and can operate while submerged in harsh chemicals. Additionally, TECHTRON is inherently flame retardant and can be easily machined to close tolerances. PPS has a broader resistance to chemicals than most high-performing plastics, as well. TECHTRON can work well as an alternative to PEEK at lower temperatures for this reason.\n\nRADEL – PPSU\n\nWith high heat and high impact performance, RADEL delivers better impact resistance and chemical resistance than other sulfone-based polymers, such as PSU and PEI. Its toughness and long-term hydrolytic stability mean it performs well even under autoclave pressure. Importantly, RADEL R5500 meets the stringent aircraft flammability requirements of 14CFR Part 25. These allow the aircraft design engineer to provide lightweight, safe and aesthetically pleasing precision components for various aircraft interior layouts. RADEL can also be polished to a mirror finish and is FDA and NSF approved for food and beverage contact.\n\nKEL – F\n\nKel-F is a winning combination of physical and mechanical properties, non-flammability, chemical resistance, near-zero moisture absorption and of course outstanding electrical properties. This stands out from other thermoplastic fluoropolymers, as only Kel-F has these characteristics in a useful temperature range of -400°F to +400°F. In addition, it has very low outgassing and offers extreme transmissivity for radar and microwave applications. Many aircraft and ground-based random applications use Kel-F.\n\nPEEK\n\nPEEK can be used continuously in temperatures of 480°F (250°C) and in hot water or steam without permanent loss of physical properties. For hostile environments, PEEK is a high strength alternative to fluoropolymers. PEEK carries a V-O flammability rating and exhibits very low smoke and toxic gas emission when exposed to flame. These aren’t the only reasons that PEEK is an increasingly popular choice for metal replacement in aerospace, however. Many manufacturers prefer PEEK for its lightweight nature, mechanical strength, creep and fatigue resistance, as well as its ease of processing. These and other exceptional physical and thermal characteristics make PEEK a versatile thermoplastic polymer for many aerospace applications. AIP has provided flight control, fuel system, interior, engine and aerodynamic-related PEEK components for various aircraft OEM and MRO providers worldwide.\n\nKYNAR – PVDF\n\nAnother example of thermoplastic materials used in aerospace and defense is KYNAR, or PVDF. This polymer has impressive chemical resistance at ambient and elevated temperatures, as well as good thermomechanical and tensile strength. KYNAR is extremely durable due to its weather-ability and toughness even in the most severe environments. In addition to being flame-resistant, KYNAR is easy to machine, too. You can typically find KYNAR components in pipe fitting and various fuel or other fluid related precision manifolds or connectors.\n\nor request a quote HERE.\n\nWhen looking to design a custom critical component for the aerospace industry, finding the right plastics manufacturer is just as important as deciding what resin works best for your project’s needs. The use of high performing plastics and thermoplastics such as ULTEM, TORLON, PEEK, and RADEL has quadrupled in aerospace design over the last 45 years thanks to their unique dynamic properties, and with them comes the need for precise machining and manufacturing.\n\nHere are 5 considerations you should take into account before choosing your aerospace plastic parts manufacturing company:\n\nCapabilities & Competency\n\nBefore hiring a plastics manufacturing company, first ensure that they have the plastic designing and production capabilities necessary to handle your aerospace project’s needs. The three main plastic production processes are 3D Printing, Injection Molding and Plastics Machining. Discovering which technology is most appropriate for your project is dependent on your project’s requirements… and the plastics manufacturer you decide on should be able to tell you the pros and cons of each technology.\n\nThe manufacturer you choose should also have the ability to navigate from your product’s initial vision through its production, addressing quality and customer care every step of the way. They should be able to competently handle the raw plastic materials of your choice as well, so that you receive the highest quality product in regards to cost, time, precision, efficiency, materials and more. Your project, regardless of specificity, can be machined into a highly precise and extremely resilient product.\n\nHere at AIP Precision Machining, our decades of experience working with ULTEM, TORLON, PEEK, and RADEL high performing plastics ensures smooth navigation from your project’s start to finish.\n\nIndustry Standards\n\nProduct manufacturing companies must follow industry standards like International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) and more in order to ensure that their products hold up to specific requirements. Be wary of companies that have a default “Standard” methods—these are made-up specifications that do not follow recognized, insured specifications.\n\nTake a careful look at a company’s ISO certifications. For instance, ISO 9001 is focused on meeting customer expectations, continually delivering customer satisfaction and it requires an organization to demonstrate constant improvement… If an organization doesn’t have this regulated license, you may want to ask them why.\n\nAlso, consider other notable ISO certifications like the AS9100 standard which is similar to the ISO 9001 standard, but with additional requirements for aerospace manufacturing that are tailored to a particular industry’s quality system expectations and regulatory requirements.\n\nHere at AIP Precision Machining, not only are we registered to these standards, but we are registered to the most recent version of the ISO standards.\n\nAdditional Services\n\nPlenty of plastic manufacturing firms offer consulting services as well as developmental processes. Going with a plastic product manufacturing company that has manufacturing conceptualization engineers can help in the long run if your project requires any design modifications. Engineering support also ensures efficiency through every step of your project’s progression.\n\nSome plastics manufacturers also offer quality assurance measures. Not every company guarantees that their end products will hold up to your specifications but the firms that do will additionally offer services focused on comprehensive product design, development, patent registration guidance and prototype creation.\n\nHere at AIP Precision Machining, we’re proud to offer a complete and effective quality assurance process that focuses on product quality, fast delivery, and cost-effective options.\n\nDomestic vs. Overseas\n\nIf you decide to use an overseas factory, asking the right questions is critical to determine if they have the capabilities, credentials, and experience to become your trusted partner. It can often be difficult to find a reliable company that delivers high quality work. Some ways to find the best plastic manufacturer overseas is by asking for referrals, actually flying to their location, and asking a lot of questions and paying close attention to their responses. Many overseas factories will usually have a U.S.-based agent to represent them. If you find a company that seems like a good fit, ask to contact their domestic agent.\n\nDomestic manufacturers, meanwhile, greatly reduce delivery times and shipping expenses; one who is in your same time zone allows for easy communication and improved customer services. There’s also the advantage that U.S. manufacturers have higher quality and labor standards, greater payment security, and high intellectual property right protection.\n\nAIP Precision Machining is headquartered in Daytona Beach, Florida with an additional sales office in southern California. We provide an “open door” policy to our facility for potential and existing clients.\n\nExperience & Expertise\n\nChecking the track record of a company is important to get a clear outline of their performance, customer satisfaction, and overall product deliverability. Ask about their work history to see their range of experience and their level of expertise with aerospace projects similar to yours.\n\nFor instance, we at AIP Precision Machining have worked with leading aerospace and defense engineers and contractors such as Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, and GE Aviation. With our 35+ years of polymer machining experience, we’re ready to take on the most stringent challenge to meet your needs.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about how to choose a plastic product manufacturer for your critical aerospace components, feel free to reach out to us online or call us at +1 386.274.5335 for a free consultation with one of our highly-skilled engineers.\n\nTo a certain degree, 3D printing, injection molding, and plastic machining technology overlap in their capabilities and offerings. But which fabrication process is most appropriate for your project? What are their key differentiators? The following article assesses the utility of each technology with regard to precision, efficiency, materials and more.\n\nCapabilities\n\n3D printing is an additive manufacturing process that prints layers of plastic substance in three dimensions onto a single point. The popularity of 3D has grown significantly over the past few years, and it can easily be used for rapid prototyping, DIY production and manufacturing by small-scale engineers or designers. Many of the advances in 3D printing have been focused on bringing down prices, rather than technological advancement so that it can be more accessible to “mom-and-pop” users who are otherwise not eligible for the more expensive and advanced manufacturing processes.\n\nAnother additive technology, injection molding is a manufacturing process in which parts are produced by injecting materials in liquid form into a mold. Commonly performed with thermoplastic polymers, it can be used with a variety of other metal and glass materials. Small pellets of material are heated into a molten liquid which is then injected into a mold at high pressures and rapidly cooled—causing it to harden—and then ejected from the mold, exposing the part to air. Two of its key benefits include a fully automated process—permitting very high rates of production—and also that its molds allow for highly detailed and intricate parts.\n\nFinally, plastic machining, or CNC (Computer Numerical Control) plastic machining or CNC milling, involves the precise removal of layers from a material. Typically beginning with a block of the desired plastic material, plastic machining involves removing material layers at a time and allows for many different materials to be used. Introduced by MIT during the 1950s, this technique utilizing drilling tools to carve plastics—and because it’s computer-controlled, extremely precise and tolerant products are achieved.\n\nComparing the Options\n\n3D Printing Injection Molding Plastic Machining Cost Very low cost when you need 1-10 rapid design iterations on a prototype part. Because creating (or updating) a mold can end up being much more expensive than the actual order itself, this is only cost-effective with very large-scale projects. Significantly cost-effective when you need a few parts up to a few thousand. Design Designs can be highly personalized and unique—this technology is often used by artists and creative professionals. Allows for deep features, square holes and living hinges to be produced easily. High design flexibility at lower costs are allowed. Material Very limited in comparison to other plastic fabrication and unable to achieve the same smooth surfaces as the other technologies. Injection molding has a much wider range of materials available for use compared to 3D printing but is more limited than CNC machining. Broadest range of materials are allowed—CNC plastic machining also achieves the smoothest finish with the fewest imperfections. Production Fast and extremely convenient—small products can be machined in seconds. Requires time to make the mold but once the mold is finalized, production moves quickly. One of the fastest forms of fabrication and can easily scale between small and large outputs. Tolerance 3D printed prototypes are not typically finished parts and are much more likely to delaminate. Best for home and personal consumer-grade products. Parts are molded at tighter tolerances than 3D printed parts but are not as tolerant as plastic machined parts. Highest tolerances available—parts are able to reach +/- 0.002 mm and are best for demanding industries like aerospace and defense, medical and life sciences and power generation.\n\nWhy Plastics Machining Ranks Best\n\nFrom the above chart, you can see the differentiators of each fabrication process. However, we’ve found that CNC plastic machining is by far the most precise and beneficial process for custom applications.\n\nCost-wise, plastics machining is the most effective for any project that requires unique, strong designs. 3D printing is the cheapest form of fabrication but you get what you pay for with that medium… and the quality typically just isn’t there. Injection molding, meanwhile, offers much stronger products than those that are 3D printed, but modifications to a mold are extremely expensive and injection molded products are not as tolerant as plastic machined parts.\n\nLooking at design abilities, each medium offers a wide range of capabilities but again, if it’s quality that your project needs, CNC machining is the way to go—3D printed materials are really only suited to personal or home use and injection molded products cannot hold up to the rigors of the aerospace and defense, medical or power and energy industries (among others). Further, machining designs are crafted on the same computer applications that 3D printing uses so there’s no cost associated with changing the design of the product (unlike injection molding, where a new mold would then need to be created).\n\nIt is important to note that CNC plastic machining is a specialized craft… not just anyone interested in 3D modeling can create the design for a plastic machined product. Here at AIP Precision Machining, we have over 35 years of technical design expertise and we work diligently with our clients to craft products that exactly meet their project requirements.\n\nIf you’re looking to decide on a fabrication process via the material selection available to you, plastics machining offers the widest range of diverse thermoplastics for your project. 3D printing has not advanced its material range in many years and because injection molding requires liquidating its materials, you won’t be able to use the stronger, heat-resistant plastics that might be best for your needs. CNC machining is the only process that allows you to choose from the full assortment of material selections.\n\n3D printing and CNC machining tie for the fastest production times, as both take minutes to complete. Injection molding, however, requires more time to make the mold (which can take weeks to finalize).\n\nFinally, if your project requires the highest levels of tolerance, precision machining produces the most precise and extremely tolerant products. It’s the only fabrication process suited for critical pieces.\n\nWant More Information?\n\nOf 3D printing, injection molding and CNC plastic machining, one process is not necessarily better than the other—it’s dependent on your project requirements. However, plastics machining is by far the most specialized and precise option for high-quality, critical parts needed in industries like aerospace and defense, medical and life sciences and power and energy.\n\nHere at AIP Precision Machining, we commonly craft pieces that are able to survive the rigors of space, the inside of a human body or the corrosive chemicals used on an oil rig. We offer state-of-the-art technology and extensive expertise to provide you with the highest quality products. Contact us to learn more about our process and what CNC plastics machining could do for you."
