        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nMagnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is an emerging biomedical imaging modality without the use of ionizing radiation Gleich and Weizenecker (2005). MPI holds great promise to surpass existing in vivo imaging modalities in certain clinical applications, such as angiography Weizenecker et al. (2009), cancer screening Yu et al. (2017), functional imaging Cooley et al. (2018), and cell tracking Zheng et al. (2015, 2016); Bulte et al. (2015). MPI scanners rely on Faraday induction to detect the signal from the superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs). When combined with a magnetic field gradient for spatial encoding it is possible to dynamically image their spatial distribution with high spatial and temporal resolutions Weizenecker et al. (2009). Most MPI scanners share similar cylindrical geometry with the imaging scanners from other imaging modalities to enclose the subject. Recently, a low resolution human head scanner was presented for potential stroke detection Graeser et al. (2019). Another novel geometry has an open bore scanner currently designed for small volume imaging Top et al. (2017); Top and Güngör (2020). Such geometries, however, may not be practical to extend the technology into full body due to high-power requirements Borgert et al. (2013). In the alternative approach to the MPI scanners a single-sided or asymmetric geometry is utilized so that all the hardware is located on one side and the imaging volume is unrestricted Sattel et al. (2009); Kaethner et al. (2015). Recent developments in asymmetric MPI include scanners with field-free point (FFP) Gräfe et al. (2016); von Gladiss et al. (2019) or magnetic particle probes Cooley et al. (2018); Mason et al. (2021). However, the major drawbacks of all asymmetric devices are low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and limited penetration depth due to excessive noise coupling and magnetic fields inhomogeneity, respectively.\n\nOur single-sided MPI device utilizes a field-free line (FFL) that in principal offers higher signal and more robust image reconstruction technique than typical FFP geometry Weizenecker et al. (2008). Asymmetric design allows imaging of a small animal or a region of interest in humans alike Tonyushkin (2017a, b). In our implementation we utilize an excitation magnetic field with a single drive coil and the detection of an SPIO response by a surface receive coil Pagan et al. (2021); McDonough et al. (2022).\n\nIn most MPI systems, the detection is done continuously with the excitation thus the response from the SPIOs is probed at higher harmonics. Traditionally, a notch or high-pass filter is used to reject strong feedthrough voltage at the excitation frequency in the receive coil directly induced by the excitation. However, excitation field saturation persists, concealing the small SPIO response and impinging potential sensitivity gain.\n\nCylindrical-bore style scanners have traditionally utilized solenoid gradiometer coils, which efficiently extinguish direct feedthrough voltage Goodwill et al. (2012); Schulz et al. (2015). As an alternative a wrapped coil around a subject with a collinear compensation coil was also demonstrated for such closed bore scanner Graeser et al. (2020). However, neither of these geometries can be accommodated in the truly single-sided scanner geometry. Thus, the surface scanner designs so far solely relied on the receive filters with high attenuation of the drive component at some expense of the high pass response. Moreover, due to the overall lower inherent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the single-sided scanners the attenuation of the signal at higher harmonics affects the limit of detection and makes the image reconstruction more challenging. Here, we study various options for the receive coils configurations based on the elementary circular surface receive coil with the purpose of removing direct feedthrough. In particular, we implement various gradiometer coil configurations in dual coil arrangements and compare their performance based on the spatial signal profile and the sensitivity. In addition, we demonstrate highest sensitivity, new SPIO detection limit, and recovery of the fundamental harmonic in a single-sided scanner with a surface gradiometer receive coil arrangement.\n\n2. Material and Methods\n\nIn this section we provide the details on the hardware of the single-sided FFL scanner and the measurement protocols used for each study.\n\n2.1. MPI System Hardware\n\nThe coil assembly of the MPI device is comprised of a coil pair that serves as a generator for an FFL and a single drive coil as shown in .\n\nThe actual coils are shown in . The top two coils are used to create a stationary selection gradient magnetic field in the form of the FFL, as well as to translate the FFL by altering the relative current in the two coils. These coils are separated by 11 mm from each other and located 4 mm from the surface of the device. The bottom coil, located in the middle of the device 5 mm deep under the top coils, is primarily used to generate the drive field for the excitation of SPIO as well as to vertically shift the FFL and adjust its trajectory.\n\nThe coil assembly and a water-cooled enclosure are manufactured by Resonance Research, Inc. (Billerica, MA, USA). The enclosure has dimensions of 39.3 cm length, 18.3 cm width, and a thickness of 6.7 cm. Each of the two top electromagnetic coils is 30.4 cm long with a 10 mm inner gap and a 55 mm width and consists of 8 planar coil elements with N = 26 winding of of 1.95 × 0.85 mm2 rectangular-shaped copper wire. The elements were stacked and connected in parallel to shared terminals. The bottom coil consists of 6 planar coil elements with the same dimensions as the top coils. Each coil element is separated by transverse epoxy strips forming micro-channels through the conductor’s volume for water cooling. The measured electric properties of the drive and selection coils are: dc resistances of 119 and 124 mΩ and inductances of 377 and 396 μH at 1 kHz, respectively. To prevent an ambient electromagnetic interference the device is placed inside a custom-made copper-shielded box.\n\nThe magnetic field mapping was performed using a gaussmeter (Magsys HGM09s, Germany) with the transverse hall probe mounted on a custom-made 3-D robot. For the respective drive field mapping we applied dc current of 1 A to the coils from a regulated current supply.\n\nThe iso-axis of the device is defined as the axial projection of the drive coil onto the top surface of the device and serves as the x = 0 reference position. The z-component of the magnetic field was measured along the surface of the device. Measurements indicated the node of the Bz field near the surface offset by x = 34 mm from the iso-axis.\n\n2.2. Receive Coils\n\nThe single-sided FFL design only allows incorporation of surface receive coils. Among the possibilities there are a single or multiple Rx coils and a gradiometer configuration of the Rx coil with the compensation coil. The two gradiometer configurations that we implemented are an Rx coil with the compensation coil in coaxial symmetry configuration (vertical gradiometer) and an Rx coil with the the compensation coil adjacent to the main coil on the surface (surface gradiometer). Thus, in this study, we examine variations of the above three configurations as shown in . As a measure of the performance we investigate the drive feedthrough attenuation, sensitivity, and spatial profile of the signal in each case.\n\nEach receive coil configuration was assembled from a universal circular Rx coil, which was then used in various orientations and combinations. This Rx coil was designed for optimum uniformity of the spatial sensitivity profile 10 mm above the center of the coil. The coil has an inner diameter of 25 mm and an outer diameter of 60 mm. The dual layer coil has total 38 turns of Litz wire (AWG 22, 40/38), with an inductance of 62.5 μH. The wire wound on a structural support of 3-D printed ABS plastic with a base thickness of 1.3 mm.\n\nThe first orientation consisted of the single receive coil placed in the center of the top surface of the device as seen in . This position serves as a reference for the other combinations.\n\nThe second receive scheme also consists of a single Rx coil, which exploits polarity reversal near the node of the drive Bz field as explained in the diagram in .\n\nThe third receive scheme is a vertical gradiometer comprised of two collinear coils: Rx1 placed at the top and Rx2 placed at the bottom surfaces equidistant from the drive coil and connected in series with opposite polarity, see . This configuration was positioned either at the center or at the node of the drive field as shown in .\n\nThe fourth configuration is a ”figure-8” arrangement, where two Rx coils positioned at the top surface symmetrically around the iso-axis at the two nodes of Bz and connected in series with the same polarity, .\n\nThe last configuration, surface gradiometer, utilizes the Rx1 coil at the center and the compensation Rx2 coil placed at the surface next to it along the iso-axis (y-axis) and connected in series with the opposite polarity, .\n\n2.3. Signal Chain\n\nThe schematic diagram of signal chain is shown in . The experimental validation and comparison tests were obtained at a drive frequency of f0 = 25 kHz. The SPIO detection limit results were obtained with the ultra-low distortion function generator DS360 (Stanford Research Systems, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) as the drive source. The drive field is generated by a power amplifier Techron 7548 (AE Techron, Elkhart, IN, USA). To prevent any unwanted higher harmonics from passing to the drive coil we implemented a custom-made high-power resonant low-pass filter. The lower-pass filter achieves an attenuation of 70 dB at the third harmonic.\n\nThe nonlinear SPIO response, induced by the drive field, is detected by the receive coil. The signal is then passed through a 3rd order Butterworth band stop filter with a resonant tuning at 75 kHz. Since the receive coil configurations utilize different coil combinations, the receive filters were tuned for each configuration to provide ~ 70 dB attenuation of fundamental harmonic. To select signal at 3f0 = 75 kHz, the output of the filter is connected to a Lock-In Amplifier SR830 DPS (Stanford Research Systems, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). While the analog signal provided by Lock-In Amplifier is available with high gain, the digital signal is detected with no extra gain applied. The digital signal from the Lock-In Amplifier is the amplitude of the desired harmonic, because the Lock-In amplifier acts as a Fourier transform. The time series signal is then recorded with a GPIB card by a custom written LabView (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) interface.\n\n2.4. Feedthrough Coupling Attenuation Analysis\n\nDirect coupling of the drive field to the receive coil is the primary cause of saturation of the preamplifier preventing detection of a small signal with high gain amplification. To determine feedthrough from the drive field a function generator AFG3022C (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR, USA) was directly connected to the drive coil with an applied voltage of Vpp = 10 V at 25 kHz. A robotic arm shifted the Rx coil from the iso-axis to the edge of the device. For comparison, the gradiometer’s voltages were measured at the two positions along x-axis passing the node of Bz of the drive field. The output from each receive configuration was directly connected to an oscilloscope to determine the induced voltages. The performance in each case was compared with the voltage in the single Rx coil at the center.\n\n2.5. Signal Profile and Dilution Series Experiments\n\nIn order to determine the signal profile in x- or y- directions we performed calibration scans of an SPIO sample along x,y-axes. In this SPIO detection experiment we used an 18 μl glass-bulb phantom containing VivoTrax (Magnetic Insight, CA, USA) nanoparticles with the undiluted content c(Fe) = 5.5 mg/ml. The study was performed for various Rx coil configurations (see ). A robotic arm repeatedly introduced the SPIO sample into the field-of-view (FOV) at the fixed height of z = 0.9 cm above the surface for 5 s followed by the sample moved 4 cm higher, which was determined to be sufficient to serve as a no-signal reference, for another 5 s and scanning along x- or y- axis with 1 mm increment with 5 time repetition per each location. The signal is calculated as the averaged SPIO voltage with the subtracted averaged reference voltage.\n\nTo determine the efficiency of the receive coil configurations we performed sensitivity studies for the single, vertical and surface gradiometer coils’ configurations at the node position as well as at the center. To prevent the Lock-In preamplifier saturation in all the configurations we fixed the drive current to 6 A RMS. In this study a series of dilutions: 1 : 1 : 10 : 20 : 30 : 50 : 100 of the SPIO were used. The sample was placed at the position of the maximum signal as determined in the corresponding signal profile study. A time series with and without the sample were recorded with 5 times averaging. The background signal is obtained by performing a polynomial fit of the signal vs time for when the sample is not within the FOV of the receive coil. Subtracting this background signal allows us to eliminate background effects originating from drifts in the drive current, which are caused by heating of electrical components.\n\nFor the final study of the SPIO detection limit we implemented an Rx coil at the center in the surface gradiometer arrangement. The study was performed with a series of dilutions: 1 : 1 : 10 : 50 : 100 : 200 : 500 : 1000 : 2000. A time series with and without the sample were recorded with 10 s time steps and 10–20 times averaging for two drive currents: 9 A RMS and 14 A RMS corresponding to 3.1 mT and 4.8 mT drive field amplitudes, respectively.\n\n2.6. 1D Imaging Experiments\n\nIn order to demonstrate the imaging capability of the receive coil configurations implemented in our scanner we have preformed 1D imaging with an SPIO sample. To measure the signal produced by the sample we used the same signal chain that is discussed in Section 2.3, with the exception of removing the HPF for recovery of the 1st harmonic. In our hybrid encoding method the stationary object is imaged by electronically shifting FFL across the imaging plane by alternating current pattern in the selection coils Pagan et al. (2021), whereas relatively weak drive field applied across the entire FOV thus the small oscillation of FFL along vertical direction due to the drive field is neglected Chinchilla et al. (2021). The image in this study is taken to be the amplitudes of the first and third harmonics: u^1(x) and u^3(x), respectively, vs the position of the FFL.\n\nA sinusoidal current with a frequency of 25 kHz and a RMS amplitude of 4.7 A was applied to the drive coil, which creates an oscillating magnetic field with a strength of 1.6 mT at the surface of the scanner. In this study we used VivoTrax Plus (Magnetic Insight, CA, USA) nanoparticles with the undiluted content c(Fe) = 5.5 mg/ml. The sample is an original vial with the inner cross-section of 13 mm and a total volume of 1.1 mL of nanoparticle solution. The sample is placed on a stand and the scanning is done at the FFL height of 17 mm above the scanner corresponding to the vial cross-section at the height of 6 mm.\n\nTo collect 1D images no rotation of the phantom is required. The FFL is moved 81 different discrete positions from x = −20 mm to x = 20 mm across the scanner with a step size of 0.5 mm and the signal at each discrete position is recorded by a custom built LabView interface. Due to the inhomogeneity of our fields the FFL travels along an arc described in more depth in previous works Chinchilla et al. (2021), at the central position x = 0 mm the FFL is located 17 mm above the surface of the scanner and has a gradient of 0.58 T/m. In 1D scanning mode only one projection of the phantom is measured. To create an image projections are obtained with and without the sample, and the signal is obtained by subtracting the background signal from the total signal. In addition, the FFL is scanned in two opposite directions to form two different images, one from x = −20 mm to x = 20 mm and the other from x = 20 mm to x = −20 mm, which would be identical if not for eddy current dependent artifacts. These two images are then averaged to form a final image, meaning each 1D image consists of four separate projections.\n\n2.7. Signal Simulations\n\nWe performed simulations using MATLAB to produce signal profiles for arbitrary receive coils. These simulations can be used for fast prototyping of receive coils or fitting signal profile data. First the simulation calculates the magnetic fields of the drive, and receive coil. This is done using a numeric approximation to the Biot-Savart for infinitesimal wires.\n\nB→(r→)=μ0I4π∮Cdl→×(r→−l→)|r→−l→|3≈μ0I4π∑idli→×(r→−li→)|r→−l→i|3,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere dl→ is an infinitesimal piece of the current carrying wire that produces the magnetic field, r→ is the position of the magnetic field, l→ is the position of infinitesimal piece of wire, and C is the contour of the coil producing the magnetic field. Different coil geometries can be simulated by providing different positions of all infinitesimal current carrying wires l→. The direction of the current dl→ for the ith element is estimated by the following difference: dl→i=l→i+1−l→i. Running this script for different values of r→ allows the user to produce magnetic fields over volumes specified by the user. Magnetic fields for all coils used in our scanner were simulated using their geometries, which are described in Sections 2.1, 2.2.\n\nIn MPI the signal is caused by a response in the SPIO sample due to a changing magnetic field produced by the drive coil. As the drive field oscillates the total magnetization of the SPIO sample is described by the Langevin theory of paramagnetism. When applying an oscillating magnetic field H→(r→,t) the magnetization of the SPIO sample will be:\n\nM→(r→,t)=c(r→)M→0(r→,t),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\n\nM→0(r→,t)=mℒ(β|H→(r→,t)|)H^(r→,t).\n\n(3)\n\nHere, c(r→) describes the spatial distribution of the magnetic nanoparticles, m is the dipole moment of the particles, and ℒ is the Langevin function. The factor β is a ratio that relates the dipole moment of the sample to the thermal energy of the system and it is given by β=μ0mkBT where μ0 is vacuum permeability, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature of the SPIO. In our simulations we take m = 3.6 * 10−18Am2, and T = 300 K. When calculating the signal profile of a receive coil the spatial distribution of SPIO is given by a point source at an arbitrary location:\n\nc(r→)=mSPIOδ(r→−rs→),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere δ is the Dirac delta function, mSPIO is the total mass of the sample, and rs→ is the location of the sample. The oscillations of this magnetization lead to a signal in the receive coil due to Faraday’s law of induction. In general this signal is given by the following expression:\n\nv(t)=−∫∂∂tM→(r→,t)⋅B→rx(r→)dr→\n\n(5)\n\nThis is known as the MPI signal equation and was first published in Rahmer et al. (2009). The first term in the integral Eq. 5 defines the time derivative of the magnetization given by Eqs. 2–3; BRx is the sensitivity profile of the receive coil, which is defined as the magnetic field produced by a unit current. For each location of the point source rs→ and considering Eq. 4 the signal profile Eq. 5 simplifies as following:\n\nv(t)=−mSPIO ∫∂∂tM→0(r→,t)⋅B→rx(r→)δ(r→−rs→)dr→=−mSPIO ∂∂tM→0(rs→,t)⋅B→rx(rs→)\n\n(6)\n\nWhen the sample is driven by a sinusoidal drive field this signal can be decomposed into odd harmonics of the drive frequency. In the lab we observe the third harmonic due to it being the largest signal that is exclusively caused by the SPIO sample. To mimic the effect of the lock in amplifier the simulation takes the fast Fourier transform of this signal and records the magnitude of the third harmonic as the signal. To obtain the complete signal profile of a receive coil Eq. 6 is calculated for all sample locations r→s.\n\n3. Results\n\nIn this section we present the experimental results of different studies.\n\n3.1. Feedthrough Attenuation Analysis\n\nIn this study we compared the direct feedthrough coupling in three Rx coil’s configurations: single, vertical gradiometer and surface gradiometer coils’ arrangement. To compare the feedthrough signal as a reference we show the map of the drive field in . In our prototype device the drive field has Bz and Bx components that may equally excite the SPIO depending on it’s location with respect to the iso-axis. However, since the area of the surface coil is in the x, y-plane only Bz component of the drive field is contributing to the feedthrough. Thus, the maximum coupling of Bz is expected at the center of the scanner where the Rx and drive coils are collinear.\n\nThe feedthrough voltage from the direct coupling of the drive field into the single Rx coil is shown in . The direct feedthrough voltage is following similar trend as the Bz drive field shown in , however, with a shifted zero to x=38.5 mm due to finite size of the coil. When the Rx coil is located at the node of the drive Bz field it effectively provides a first order gradiometer effect. This results in 49 dB feedthrough attenuation compared to the Rx coil at the center.\n\nThe next Rx coils’ arrangement with an additional collinear compensation coil provides a drive field cancellation that relies on the symmetry of the field along z-axis with respect to the position of the drive coil inside the scanner. This vertical gradiometer, comprised of two coils, was evaluated at the center and at the node. We measured a 17 dB attenuation at the center of the device compared to the single coil at the same positiofign (see ).\n\nWhen placed at the node, the vertical gradiometer scheme effectively provides second order field cancellation with the measured 39 dB attenuation compared to itself at the center. Thus, overall the vertical gradiometer configuration provides a 57 dB feedthrough attenuation as referenced to the single Rx coil at the center.\n\nIn the alternative surface gradiometer arrangement the Rx1 coil is placed at the center and the compensation Rx2 coil is placed next to the Rx1 along the iso-axis. Since the drive coil has the same elongated shape as the SC generating long FFL this arrangement allows coupling essentially the same feedthrough in both coils providing nearly perfect subtraction. In addition, the central location of the Rx1 coil provides a symmetrical sensitivity profile with maximum gain, which is required for the projection-based imaging reconstruction. The measured feedthrough attenuation at the center is 41 dB compared to the single coil without compensation (see ) corresponding to overall 80 dB attenuation of the input drive field.\n\n3.2. Signal Profile\n\nIn this study we measured the sensitivity profiles versus different Rx coil arrangements. This was done using a robot that would move a 18 μl sample of SPIO across the detector. The results of this study are presented in .\n\nSince vertical arrangement is equivalent to the corresponding single coil profile, we plotted profiles for two distinct coil configurations: central Rx coil with surface gradiometer and figure-8 Rx coil. Sensitivity profiles were measured and compared to simulations (solid curves) as seen in . A rotational symmetric profile of central Rx coil is shown in showing good agreement with the simulated profile. The observed asymmetries in the data are caused by the drive current drift over the long scan time over the full FOV. The sensitivity profile of the central Rx coil gives a nearly uniform sensitivity profile ±20 mm from the center of the scanner (see ) allowing imaging with FOV=4 cm. Sensitivity profiles of figure-8 arrangement where the two coils are located at the opposite nodes with respect to iso-axis are shown in and along x and y axes respectively. Both profiles show agreement with the simulations including features along x-axis in with some asymmetries caused by the current drift.\n\n3.3. Sensitivity Studies\n\nTo compare performance of three coil configurations: single Rx, vertical and surface gradiometer coils we performed a dilution series of VivoTrax SPIO. The results of the signal versus the iron content are shown in . We set the limit of detection to be lowest dilution with signal-to-noise (SNR), as defined by SNR = Signal/σ, greater than 1. For the single coil the limit of detection was 9.9 μg (Fe), 1:10 dilution, with an SNR=2.83. For the vertical gradiometer, the limit of detection was 1.98 μg (Fe), 1:50 dilution, with an SNR=1.59. The surface gradiometer shows a linear detection of at least 0.99 μg (Fe), 1:100 dilution, with an SNR=10.\n\nThe instrumental sensitivities of various detection schemes were deduced from the corresponding least squares linear fits of the signal (see ). The single coil resulted in a sensitivity of 0.802 μV/mg (Fe) and the vertical gradiometer resulted in a sensitivity of 3.019 μV/mg (Fe), ~ 4 fold increase in sensitivity. The surface gradiometer resulted in a sensitivity of 5.887 μV/mg, ~ 7.5 increase in magnitude in the signal when compared to the single coil arrangement.\n\n3.4. Detection limit\n\nFor the study of the ultimate SPIO detection limit we used the Rx coil at the center with the surface gradiometer configuration, using the procedure outlined in Section 2.5. The study was performed with a series of dilutions: 1 : 1 : 10 : 50 : 100 : 200 : 500 : 1000 : 2000. A time series at the 3rd harmonic with and without the sample were recorded with 10 s time steps and 20 times averaging and the drive field amplitudes of 3.1 mT and 4.8 mT. An example of the raw time series data at 4.8 mT corrected for the slow current drift are shown in , where the inset corresponds to the zoomed in data of the last three detectable dilutions.\n\nDilution series signal versus the dilution ratio is shown in . The smallest concentration of iron with an SNR ≥ 1 was detected for the 1:1000 dilution corresponding to 100 ng of iron content in the sample for both drive currents. This dilution was found to have a signal magnitude of 4 nV for a drive field strength of 3.1 mT. As a test of the bottom noise, we performed the experiment with the same phantom filled with deionized water obtaining the signal of ~ 0.5 nV.\n\n3.5. 1D imaging\n\nTo show the imaging capability of the scanner with the surface gradiometer configuration, we performed a basic 1D imaging experiment. In this study a cross-section of the bottle at the height of 6 mm and containing an undiluted SPIO, shown in , was imaged as outlined in the diagram in so that 1D signal along x-axis represents the integration over the disk-shaped SPIO sample. First, the sample was imaged by measuring the magnitude of the 1st harmonic without the use of receive filter after the Rx coil, the resulting image is shown in , where the solid curve is the Gaussian fit to the data. demonstrated that the surface gradiometer provides adequate feedthrough reduction to allow for the recovery of the 1st harmonic.\n\nAdditional imaging was performed by measuring the magnitude of the 3rd harmonic with and without the use of the receive filter located after the Rx coil. It is shown in that the surface gradiometer alone provides factor of ~1.5 higher magnitude of the 3rd harmonic than the one obtained utilizing the receive filter.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nIn this work, for the first time, we implemented and studied different designs of the receive coils with compensation in a gradiometer arrangements for the single-sided FFL scanner. To date no other single-sided MPI scanner utilized a gradiometer receive scheme resulting in worst performance of such devices compared to conventional geometries and preventing their usage in various applications.\n\nThe analysis presented in Sec.3.1 of different Rx coil arrangements showed that the single Rx coil without compensation can only be used if placed at the node of the drive field. While this location provides a working arrangement with just a single Rx coil, the attenuation at the node position is not sufficient due to drop of the drive field along x-axis (see ). To improve attenuation without introduction of a gradiometer, the coil must be redesigned to account for the spatial inhomogeneity across the surface of the scanner.\n\nIn the collinear compensation scheme or the vertical gradiometer arrangement the attenuation factor was not sufficient for an SPIO signal detection. One of the reasons for poor feedthrough subtraction in this arrangement is drive field asymmetry at the top and the bottom surfaces that includes extra coils at the upper side of the drive coil, which makes it harder to predict the behavior of the compensation. Single-sided MPI devices are especially prone to this effect since the drive coil is typically located closer to the top surface. Moreover, single sided scanners may not have an access from the bottom for the compensation due to the requirements of the additional mechanical hardware. Another drawback of the vertical arrangement is that the optimization to achieve Maxwell configuration requires increasing the radius of wingdings in each coil to match the height of the scanner, which makes this configuration dependable on the dimensions of the scanner itself. Provided the physical dimensions allow such arrangements, one way to improve the performance of the vertical gradiometer arrangement is to design the compensation Rx2 coil with different shape or number of turns than Rx1 effectively compensating for the asymmetry in the drive field and coil design. In addition, placing such gradiometer at the location of the drive’s node makes it more effective as in the case of a single Rx coil.\n\nThe best performance of all the compensation schemes gave the surface gradiometer arrangement where the compensation coil was placed next to the Rx coil along the iso-axis. This result comes from the symmetry of the FFL device that creates the same drive field profile along the iso-axis of the device. While this arrangement provides an ideal feedthrough rejection a care should be taken to avoid the imaging volume from overlapping with the compensation coil, which in most cases should not be a problem due to the localized Rx field profile of the surface coil. Increasing the size of the receive and gradiometer coil, in this design, would allow for a larger FOV, however, the maximum FOV is ultimately defined by the underlying coil system of the scanner and the shape of the drive and selection fields.\n\nThe study of the sensitivity profile showed that the central Rx coil with surface gradiometer is the most practical receive configuration for most imaging applications we have explored thus far. However, other designs have their uses as well, such as the figure-8 Rx coil configuration where the two coils are located at the two opposite nodes of field with respect to iso-axis (see , ). The figure-8 Rx coil configuration has a smaller uniform sensitivity region than the central Rx coil, but it is sensitive to SPIO at distances greater than 30 mm away from the center of the scanner. The existence of the lobes at the spatial profile and further shaping of the profile by adjusting the size of each coil makes this coil configuration a good candidate for parallel imaging with sensitivity encoding similar to SENSE technique in MRI Pruessmann et al. (1999). Parallel MPI imaging were previously explored using sensitivity profile of the pickup coil Zhong et al. (2018), multiple pickup coils Hamanaga et al. (2019), and multi FFP design Vogel et al. (2020). Incorporating surface gradiometer and figure-8 coils at the same time may be used for multi-channel imaging that may be helpful to eliminate background scans speeding up the acquisition sequence.\n\nIn the sensitivity study we compared three distinguished configurations: single Rx, vertical and surface gradiometer coils. In agreement with the above discussion the surface gradiometer coil arrangement provides the greatest sensitivity of all the arrangements we have tested, which enables to reach highest detection limit of SPIO. This limit corresponds to 100 ng of iron content in the sample, which is much better than our estimated sensitivity needed to detect 1 mm3 tumors by EPR effect ~ 4.8 μg Pagan et al. (2021). In this study we were limited by the maximum drive field of 4.8 mT mainly due to excessive heating of the transmit filter components and resulted current instabilities during continuous operation of the coils. However, the linear fit to the data at 4.8 mT drive field (see ) as crossing the horizontal level of the SNR=1 implies that we should be able to reach the sensitivity of 10 ng of iron content. Operating at higher drive fields would provide higher SNRs that could be traded for less averaging and faster detection.\n\nFinally, we carried out 1D imaging experiment with various electronic filter configurations. The results demonstrated that the surface gradiometer provides adequate feedthrough reduction to allow for the recovery of the 1st harmonic. In addition, imaging with the 3rd harmonic with and without the use of the receive filter located after the Rx coil gave higher signal for the latter case. These results demonstrate the capabilities of the implemented detection scheme in narrowband imaging without use of notch filters helping to recover fundamental harmonic and boosting the signal at higher harmonics, which could be valuable for x-space type of image reconstruction techniques Goodwill et al. (2012). While in general x-space method is not currently applicable to our system due to fields inhomogeneity we believe that x-space imaging may be implemented in single-sided scanners within specified FOV provided that the magnetic fields are homogeneous enough."
