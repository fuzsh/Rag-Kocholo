The value for money is exceptional, and the sturdy packaging ensured that the scooter reached me in perfect condition. As for the scooter itself, it's nothing short of amazing. I've been thoroughly impressed by its performance and durability. Needless to say, I am beyond happy with this purchase. Thank you, Techtron, for delivering such an outstanding product!\n\nDate of experience : January 31, 2024\n\nExcellent customer service\n\nMy initial order was lost by the courier, Maggie the customer service agent was amazing, she resent the order and even when I accidentally put the wrong postcode on the delivery she was very patient and sent the delivery again at the companyâ€™s cost!\n\nShe rang with updates and went above and beyond to help me!\n\nI did initially struggle to find a contact number to ring but once u did the customer service was excellent! I look forward to receiving my order today!! Thank you ðŸ˜Š\n\nDate of experience : November 13, 2023\n\npleasure scooter\n\nthe scooter feels good quality didn't like the solid wheels at first but will get used to them and punctures can be a pain, so great to not have flats.buyers be aware of cruise control turn off. before you use can be dangerous and keep the speed setting low at first the rear break is excellent.\n\nDate of experience : February 03, 2023\n\n100% worth it\n\nI first ordered 2 Pro 3500 for kids, admittedly I didn't think I would receive them buy I did abd quicker than expected ! Now bought 3 of the elite 3500 for myself partner and Xmas present. Have recommended to everyone looking to buy a scooter.\n\nDate of experience : August 17, 2023\n\nThis could and would have been a 5 starâ€¦\n\nThis could and would have been a 5 star rating BUT after receiving the item, I dropped Techtron an email and asked how much a replacement battery costs. I have yet to hear back from them and this SADLY gives the \"impression\" that they are ONLY interested in the Sales aspect of things and NOT Customer Service or Care.\n\nDate of experience : June 06, 2023\n\nReply from Multibrands International Ltd\n\nDear Berry, We sincerely apologize for the lack of response regarding your enquiring about the battery costs. To assist you further, could you please specify ,battery for which scooter are you inquiring about. We are committed to rectifying this lapse in our customer service and provide you with a prompt reply. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nBrilliant comms\n\nBrilliant comms from the customer service department and a great scooter for the price.\n\nThere was a delay in it coming, which was really annoying as Iâ€™d paid for express delivery. I then read the reviews and panicked! No need to, they responded very quickly to my email and subsequent emails. It took longer to come than I would have liked but they refunded the extra I paid for the express delivery.\n\nIâ€™ve just emailed them again to get some spares. Again a very quick response. Would highly recommend.\n\nDate of experience : September 08, 2023\n\nCustomer service is non existent\n\nI went to their website for general enquiry, they call themselves Multibrand not techtron which was a bit confusing.Their email service does not work. Nobody answers any calls. Imagine the nightmare of trying to get replacement parts for your scooter. Luckily I haven't purchased anything from them. The only response I got from them is here after putting a review on trust pilot.\n\nDate of experience : September 05, 2023\n\nReply from Multibrands International Ltd\n\nHi, We are a multinational consumer goods company . We design, manufacture and supply a diverse range of consumer products. The techtron e scooters are one of the main products. Incase If you have purchased any product and have any issue please send us a an email on customerservices@techtron.co and we will do our best to assist you.\n\nGreat company\n\nI bought a techtron Elite 3500 scooter last year for my son. Recently he noticed he had damaged the back mud guard. I got in touch with the company and they were brilliant. They arranged the repair all at a very good price. Highly recommended\n\nDate of experience : February 12, 2024\n\nGreat scooters, looking forward to new range on the website\n\nI bought a scooter from these guys last year. looking to get a slightly faster one now so got my new T5 on pre-order. very excited. would reccomend these guys for anyone wanting an electric scooter.\n\nDate of experience : July 14, 2023\n\nI will be taking them to court\n\nI will be taking them to court. No customer service skills at all just rude sent the broken scooter back still broken but more broken. Can't believe they are even still trading the reviews on here complete joke I think any good reviews are fake because I've heard so many bad experiences like mine\n\nDate of experience : March 08, 2023\n\nFaulty item (e-scooter) and no customer support\n\nItem purchased (e-scooter) and when assembled did not charge. The adaptor was showing a green light but item would not switch on. Contacted customer services for advice and was told to send serial number and photo of item which I did.\n\nNo one from customer services called me back as requested. Tried to call them again over 50 times with no joy.\n\nLeft with faulty item 4 days before Christmas and given no help or support from this company.\n\nUpdate - courier collected faulty item on 3rd January, as of today 16th January no further communications from this companyby way of an update and no refund on the card used to purchase. Very poor customer service.\n\nDate of experience : December 20, 2023\n\nVery poor quality product and terribleâ€¦\n\nVery poor quality product and terrible after sales.\n\nWe have spent tens of thousands as a retailer, stocking and selling the Techtron scooters and had numerous issues with their quality.\n\nCustomer services is based in Bangladesh who have little, to no knowledge of the products.\n\nThe scooters come with a 1 year warranty. Tehctorn have now informed us they have no parts for the Pro 3500 scooter and no idea of when they will receive parts. Given the poor quality of the products we have a number of warranty claims, which Techtron are providing no support what so ever.\n\nWe have worked with c.50 different suppliers, manufactures & wholesales and can honesty say Techtron is without doubt the worst we have had the misfortune of dealing with.\n\nDate of experience : December 07, 2023\n\nVery disappointed\n\nBought two Techtron Pro 3500 on June 25th 2023. One for my son and the other for my daughter. After a few weeks one of the scooter stopped working and started beeping continuously. I contacted Techtron and sent all the associated proof of purchase and video evidence of the issue. They refuse to repair or replace , stating that I did not register the scooter on their website within 30 days to make use of the warranty. My son is now left devastated.\n\nDate of experience : June 25, 2023\n\nYou won't be disappointed\n\nVery happy with the scooter and it's features. The only down fall is can't connect to the app, and trying to log the warranty with customer service is hard too. No one answers!! Scooter itself is very good I'm very happy. But calling customer service is a no no.\n\nDate of experience : April 12, 2023"
