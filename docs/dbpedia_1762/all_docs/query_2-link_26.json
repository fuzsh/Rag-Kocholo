        "text": "In a country revered for its scenery, Milford Sound is truly one of the gems in New Zealand’s crown. This pristine and supremely photogenic location is reached either by scenic light aircraft or helicopter flight, by coach tour or in the comfort of your own motorhome, and less commonly by cruise ship or with the help of a sturdy pair of boots via the world famous Milford track. Each option has its own distinct benefits, but for independent travellers embarking on a nationwide road trip of three weeks duration or longer, Milford is a ‘must do’ inclusion and the option of self-driving will take you along a road that will remain a highlight of your lifetime. The 120 km highway from Te Anau was partially completed as a government employment project during the recession of the 1930s. It crosses the Main Divide that provides occasional monumental earthquakes, and through the 1.3 km Homer Tunnel located at 945 m that was finally opened in 1952. Photo stops and opportunities for short walks along the route at places such as Te Anau Downs, Mirror Lakes, Knobs Flat, Cascade Creek, Pop’s Lookout, Monkey Creek and the Chasm ensure that one can easily spend a day just getting to or from the sound. A superb strenuous half-day walk to Key Summit on the Routeburn track is available from The Divide. Overnighting opportunities in Department of Conservation campsites along the route or at a holiday park in Milford Sound facilitate the highly recommended option of dedicating a full day to the road journey. The 16 km long fjord is the northern-most (and smallest) of a string of 15 fjords that penetrate a 200 km stretch of the south-western South Island’s coastline, and is the only one to have direct road access. The area is renown for the rainfall that adds dozens of new waterfalls to the permanent ones within hours of rainfall commencing. Milford Sound’s small settlement receives over six metres of rainfall annually, making it the wettest inhabited place in the country. Despite this, rainfall occurs on only roughly half the days in any month throughout the year and visiting under both blue and grey skies is an equally religious experience. Vertical rock faces rise more than a kilometre directly from sea level, the centrepiece majestic Mitre Peak rises to 1683 m, and glacier clad peaks rise to over 2700 m within the immediate vicinity of the fjord. Rainfall and snow melt that cascades down the sides of this rugged alpine landscape, if not blown skyward before reaching its destination, provides a layer of tannin darkened fresh water up to 10 m deep on the surface of the fjord.\n\nMilford Sound is just one example of how New Zealand Frontiers is well placed to provide clients with useful advice that exceeds the service offered by other rental companies. Most visitors to Milford are only able to budget a day for the experience due to having tighter itineraries than those enjoyed by people travelling by campervan, and as a result choose to join a day tour by coach from distant Queenstown. This results in a daily pulse of traffic along the route which reaches its peak between Te Anau and Milford between 0900 and 1200. Limiting the distance covered by staying in Te Anau and travelling outside these hours greatly enhances enjoyment of both the drive and the photo opportunities en route. While the cost of providing scenic flights results in these options being expensive, the absolutely unsurpassed experience of taking a helicopter flight through Fiordland's breath-taking scenery or of landing alongside a remote alpine lake guarantees that the financial outlay is the last thing you remember. Flights can be taken from either Te Anau or Queenstown as an alternative to the road trip, or more affordably from Milford Sound once you’ve completed the memorable drive in.\n\nThe road descent into Milford Sound from the Homer Tunnel is one of a handful of prolonged steep gradients in New Zealand where brake pad heating is a safety issue. Drivers should ensure they are familiar with selecting a lower gear to utilise engine braking and should employ this technique accordingly. Drivers are also advised that the Milford Road is subject to occasional closures due to inclement weather or avalanche risk. Advice on current highway conditions throughout New Zealand can be found on the New Zealand Transport Agency’s Journey Planner website.\n\nTe Anau is a peaceful lakeside town, with wonderful views of the Fiordland National Park, which has avoided much of the development of other semi alpine towns. It is situated on the shores of New Zealand’s second largest lake, from which it takes its name, and serves as a great departure point for the 120 kilometre drive to Milford Sound. Te Anau is also used as a base for hikers embarking upon the multi-day 54 km Milford and 60 km Kepler tracks, both of which are accessed by local ferry operators and offer unsurpassed scenery for those of fitness levels and on sufficiently leisurely itineraries to be able to incorporate such an experience into their travels. A shorter stroll along the unhurried lakeshore of the 2000 inhabitant township, both by day and under the sparkling skies of a crystal clear night is equally rewarding. Cruises can also be taken to visit glow worm caves across the 344 sq km lake. The Murchison Mountains of the Fiordland National Park, adjacent to Te Anau, are a home of the endangered Takahe large, flightless alpine hen that has been successfully saved from the brink of extinction to number over 400 birds. The Te Anau Bird Sanctuary provides an excellent opportunity to view Takahe and other native bird species such as the large forest parrot the kaka and alpine parrot the kea. Te Anau also boasts a splendid opportunity to visit an alternative to big city cinemas, with the Fiordland Cinema including a bar and café and featuring hourly screenings of the breath-taking Ata Whenua movie about the rather acceptable enormous national park the locals live on the door step of. Nearby Manapouri township (population less than 300 people) is just 20 minutes’ drive away and offers even more peaceful holiday parks on the shores of its own 142 sq km lake.\n\nWith a population of just over 50,000 people, Invercargill holds the titles as New Zealand’s most southerly and westerly city, and indeed rates as one of the most southern cities in the world. The original settlement was established as a service town for the inland gold rush of the 1860s, in an area frequented by the sparse populations of South Island Maori. As one of New Zealand’s coolest, cloudiest and windiest places, once the gold rush was over it took until the rapid growth of dairy farming in the area since the 1990s and the arrival of a gregarious mayor from Auckland who remains in power a quarter of a century later to boost the local economy. A former student activist, Mayor Tim Shadbolt is credited with initiating sponsored tuition fees at the local Southland Institute of Technology that has also contributed to the city’s change of fortunes. A nearby smelter at Tiwai Point uses 13% of the country’s electricity output to produce some of the purest aluminium in the world, and the dairy factory at Edendale is rated as the largest in the world with a processing capacity of 15 million litres of milk per day. Invercargill has an excellent collection of transport museums that provide quality reminiscing for visitors, including the Bill Richardson Transport World and the Classic Motorcycle Mecca. The later capitalises on fame generated when Anthony Hopkins played local hero Burt Munro who raced The World’s Fastest Indian motorcycle on the nearby Oreti Beach. 30 km south of Invercargill, the port township of Bluff stands on the shores of Foveaux Strait that separates the South Island from Rakiura / Stewart Island. Magnificent views are available from the lookout atop Bluff Hill of Stewart Island and the township below that is hometown to Peter Arnett who provided CNN’s ground breaking live coverage of the Gulf War from Baghdad."
