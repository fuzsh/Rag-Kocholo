At any time of the year, the skies above Southland are a twinkling ceiling of stars - the Milky Way and Southern Cross are extraordinarily beautiful from down here. Stewart Island/Rakiura is a Dark Sky Sanctuary, the southernmost Dark Sky Sanctuary in the world awarded this accreditation in January 2019 from its outstanding sky quality.\n\nDiscover the moonshine\n\nNot-so-legal whisky distilling is part of Southland history. In the early 1800s, a local carpenter created a cabbage tree distillate known as 'McShane's Chained Lightning'. Then in the 1870s, members of the McRae clan from the Scottish Highlands brought their whisky-making skills to the Hokonui area and spent the next 80 years scurrying from the law and the temperance society. You can feel the spirit at the bi-annual Hokonui Moonshine Festival in February and uncover the amazing stories at the Hokonui Moonshine Museum.\n\nReceive alerts about cheap flights to Invercargill\n\nIf you're looking for cheap Invercargill fares, we run regular specials.
