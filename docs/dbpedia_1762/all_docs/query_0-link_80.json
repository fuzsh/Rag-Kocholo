The Colony of New Zealand consists of three main islands, ^xth several groups of smaller islands lying at some distance from* tBe\" principal group. The main islands, known as the North, the Middle, and Stewart Islands, have a coast- line 4,330 miles in length— North Island, 2,200 miles; Middle Island, 2,000 miles; and Stewart Island, 130 miles. Other islands included within the colony are tho Chatham, Auckland, Campbell, Antipodes, Bounty, and Kermadec Islands. The annexation of the Cook or Hervey Group and snndry other islands has recently necessitated an enlarge- ment of the boundaries of the colony, which will bo specially treated of further on. New Zealand is mountainous in many parts, but has, never- theless, larf^e plains in both North and Middle Islands. In the North Island, which is highly volcanic, is situated the famous Thermal- Springs District, of which a special account will be given. The Middle Island is remarkable for its lofty mountains, with their magnificent glaciers, and for the deep sounds or fiords on the western coast. New Zealand is firstly a pastoral, and secondly an agricultural country. Sown graSvSes are grown almost everywhere, the extent of land laid down being more than eleven millions of acres. The soil is admirably adapted for receiving these grasses, and, after the bush has been burnt off, is mostly sown over without previous ploughing. In the Middle Island a large area is covered with native grasses, all used for grazing purposes. The large extent of good grazing- land has made the colony a great wool and meat- producing country ; and its agricultural capabilities are, speakmg generally, very considerable. The abundance of water and tho quantity of valuable timber are other natural advantages. 2 NEW ZEALAND OFFICIAL YEAK-BOOK. New Zealand is, besides, a mining country. Large deposits of coal are met with, chiefly on the west coast of the Middle Island. Gold, alluvial and in quartz, is found in both islands, the yield having been nearly fifty-eight millions sterling in value to the pre- sent time. Full statistical information on this subject is given further on, compiled up to the latest dates. Discovery and Ea>(ly Settlement. The first authentic account of the discovery of New Zealand is that given by Abel Jansen Tasmari, the Dutch navigator. He left Batavia on the 14th August^^ 1642, in the yacht '* Heemskirk,\" accompanied by the **Z^ehaen** (or ** Sea-hen\") fly-boat. After having visited Mauritius,, and discovered Tasmania, named by him ** Van Diemen'fi -Land,\" in honour of Anthony van Diemen, Governor of the Dutch possessions in the East Indies, he steered eastward, and Dii the 13th December of the same year sighted the west coast ot the Middle Island of New Zealand, described by him as **a high -Tpountainous country, which is at present marked in the charts as' New Zealand.\" Tasman, under the belief that the land he saw belonged to a gr^jeCt polar continent, and was part of the country discovered some *yh&vfi before by Schouten and Le Maire, to which the name of Staaten Land had been given, gave the same name of Staaten Land to New Zealand ; but within about three months afterwards Schouten's ** Staaten Land \" was found to be merely an inconsider- able island. Upon this discovery being announced, the country that Tasman had called Staaten Land received again the name of ** New Zealand,\" by which it has ever since been known. Tasman sailed along the coast to a bay, where he anchored. To this he gave the name of Murderers (now Massacre) Bay, on account of an unprovoked attack on a boat's crew by the natives, and the massacre of four white men. Thence he steered along the west coast of the North Island, and gave the name of Cape Maria van Diemen to the north-western extremity thereof. After sighting the islands of the Three Kings he finally departed, not having set foot in the country. There is no record of any visit to New Zealand after Tasman's departure until the time of Captain Cook, who, after leaving the Society Islands, sailed in search of a southern continent then believed to exist. He sighted land on the 6th October, 1769, at Young Nick's Hea<l, and on the 8th of that month cast anchor in Poverty Bay. After having coasted round the North Island and the Middle and Stewart Islands — which last he mistook for part of the Middle Island — he took his departure from Cape Farewell on the 31st March, 1770, for Australia. He visited New Zealand again in 1773, in 1774, and in 1777. M. de Surville, a French oflicer in command of the vessel \"Saint Jean Baptiste,\" while on a voyage of discovery, sighted the north- east coast of New Zealand on the 12th December, 1769, and re- COLON 1 8 AT ION. ^ined for a sliorL time. A visit was soon after paid by another French oflicer, M. Mariou du Freane, who arrived on the west coast of the North Island of New Zealand on the 24th March, 1772, but was* on the 12th June follow ing, treaclierously nuvrdered at the Bay of Islands by the Natives. in 1793 tlie \" Dccdalus,\" under the command of Lieutenant Hanson. wa« sent by the Government of New South Wales to New Zealand, and two chiefs were taken thence to Norfolk Island. There was after this an occasional intercourse between the islands of New Zealand and the Elnghsh settlements in New South Wales. Jn 1814 the first missionaries arrived in New Zealand- -Messrs. Hall and Kendall^ who had been sent as forerunners by Mr* Mar&den, chaplain to the New South Wales Government. After a short stay they returned to New South Wales, and on the 19th November of that year again embarked in company with Mr, Mai^sden, who preached his first sermon in New Zealand on Christ- inas Day, 1814. He returned tu Sydney on tlie 23rd March, 1815, leaving Messrs. Hall and Kendall, who formed the first mission station at Eangihoua, Bay of Islands, under the auspices of the Church Missionary Society. Six years later, in 1821, the work of evangelization was put on a more durable basis ; but the first station of the W^esleyan mission, established by Mr. Leigh and his wife, at the valley of the Kaeo, Whangaroa, was not taken possession of until the 10th June, 1823. COLONtSATIOK, The first attempt at colonisation w^as made in 1825 by a com- pany formed in London, An expedition was sent out under the command of Captain Herd, who bought two islands in the HauraJd Gulf and a strip of land at Hokianga. The attempt, however, was a ftiilure, owing to the savage character of tht> inhabitants, la consequence of frequent visits of whaling- vessels to the Bay of Islands, a settlement grew up at Kororareka — now called Russell— and in 1833 Mr, Busby was appointed British Resident there, A number of Europeans — generally men of low character — gi'adually settled in diflferent parts of the country, and married N alive women. In 1838 a colonisation company, known as the New Zealand Company, was formed to establish settlement on systematic pnn- ciples. A preliminary expedition, under the command of Colonel William Wakefield, was despatched from England on the 12th May, 1839, and arrived in New Zealand in the following August. Having purchased land from the Natives, Colonel Wakefield selected the shore of Port Nicholson, in Cook Strait, as the site of the first settle- ment. On the 22nd January, 1840, the first body of immigrants arrived, and founded the town of Wellington. About the same time — namely, on the 29th January, 1840 — Captain Hobson, R.N., arrived at the Bay of Islands, empowered, witli tlie con?=eiit of the I I I 4 NEW ZEALAND OFFICIAL YEAK-BOOK. Natives, to proclaim the sovereignty of Queen Victoria over the islands of New Zealand, and to assume tlie government tliereof. A compact called \" The Treaty of Waitangi,\" to which in less than six months five hundred and twelve names were aflixed, was entered into, whereby all rights and powers of sovereignty were ceded to the Queen, all territorial rights being secured to the chiefs and their tribes. Now Zealand was then constituted a dependency of the Colony of New South Wales, but on the 3rd May, 1841, was pro- claimed a separate colony. The seat of Government had been previously established at Waitemata (Auckland), round which & settlement was formed. The New Zealand Company having decided to form another settlement, to which the name of \"Nelson\" was to bo given, de- spatched a preliminary expedition from England in April, 1841, for the purpose of selecting a site. The spot chosen was the head of Blind ]5ay, where a settlement was establislied. About the same time a number of pioneers arrived in Taranaki, despatched thither by the New Plymouth Company, a colonising society which had been formed in England, and had bought 50,000 acres of land from the Now Zealand Company. The next important event in the progress of colonisation was the arrival at Port Chalmers, on the 23rd March, 1848, of the first of two oinigraut ships sent out by the Otiigo Association for the foundalioii of a settlement by persons belonging to or in sympathy with tlie Eree ('hurch of Scotland. In IS 10 the '* Canterbury Association for founding a Settlement in New Zealand\" was incorporated. On the 16th December, 1850, the first emigrant ship despatched by the association arrived at Port Cooper, and the work of opening up tlie adjoining country was set about in a systematic fasliion, tlie intention of the promoters being to establish a settlement complete in itself, and composed entirely of members of the then United Church of England and Ireland. Thk ^Iaouis. Prior to the colonisation of New Zealand by Europeans, the earliest navigators and cxi)lorers found a race of people already inhabiting both islands. Papers written in 1874 by Mr. (after- wards Sir) William Fox, and Sir Donald McTjoan, then Native Minister, state that at what time the discovery of these islands was made by the Maoris, or from what place they came, are matters of tradition only, and that much has bcn^n lost in the obscurity enveloping the history of a people without letters. Nor is there anything on record respecting the origin of the Maori people them- selves, beyond the general tradition of the Polynesian race, which seems to show a series of successive migrations from west to east, probably by way of ^lalaysia to the Pacific. Little more can now be gathered from their traditions than that they were immigrants, and that they probably found inhabitants on the east coast of the North Island belonging to the same race as themselves — the descend- BOUNDARIES AND AHBA ftnfca of a prior migration, whose history is lost. The tra^lition runs that, grtnerations ago. the Mtioris dwelt im a comitiy naine^l Rawaiki. anil that one of thuir chiefs, after a long voyage, reached the northern iftland of Now Zealand, Rhu ruing to his hotne with a flattering description of the country he had discovered, tliis chief, it is said, pyrsuaJftd a nnmUer of Ids kinsfolk and friends, who were much harassed by war, to set out with a fleet of doable canoes for the uew land. The names of most of the canoes are still remera- ber6«l, and each tribe agrees in its account of the doings of the people of the principal canoes after their arrival in New Zealand ; and from these traditional accounts the descent of the numerous tribes has been traced. Calculations, based on the genealogical staves kept by the tohiifigas, or priests, and on the well -authenticated traditions of the people, mdicate that about twenty-one generations have passoti since the migration, which may therefore be assumed to have taken place about five imnilred and twenty -five years ago. The position of the legendary Hawaiki is unknown, but many places in the South Seas have been thus named m memory of the mother- land. The Maoris speak a very pure dialect of the Polynesian language, the common tongue, with more or less variation, in ail tlie Eastern Pacific Ishinds. When Captain Cook first visited New Zealand he availed himself of the services of a native from Tahiti, whose speech was easily understood by the Maoris. In this way much information respecting the early history of the country and its inhabitants was obtained which could not have otherwise been had. For results of recent researches as to probable origin and present ottmbeis of the Maoris, see Part II., po$t, BOUNDABIBS AifD AbEA. The Proclamation of Captain Hobson on the 30th January, 1840, gave as the boundaries of the colony the following degrees of lati- tude and longitude : On the north, 34'^ 30' S, lat, ; on the south, 47\"* 10' S, lat. ; on the east. 179'^ 0' E. long, ; on the west, 166'' 5' E, long. These limits excluded small portions of the extreme north of Ihe North Inland and of the extreme south of Stewart Island. In April. 1642, by Royal Letters Patent, and again by th© Imperial Act 26 and 27 Vict., c. 23 (1863), the boundaries of the colony were altered so as to extend from SS' to 53^ of south lati- tude and from 162^ of east longitude to 173\"^ of west longitude. By Prockunation bearing date the 2 1st July, 1887, the K'irmadec Islands, lying between the 29th and 32ud degrees of south lati- tude and the 177th and 180th degrees of west longitude, were declared to be annexed to and to become part of the Colony of Now Zealand. The following now constitute the Colony of New Zealand : — 1. The island commonly known as the North Island, with its ndjacent islets, having an aggregate area of 44,468 square miles, or 88,469,520 acres. 6 NKW ZKALAND OFFICIAL YRAK-BOOK. 2.

North Cape to Cape Palliser, the extreme northerly and southerly pomts of the island, is about 515 statute miles. This island is, as a whole, hilly, and, in parts, mountainous in character, but there are large areas of plain or comparatively level country that are, or by clearing may be made, available for agricul- tural purposes. Of these, the principal are the plains in Hawke's Bay on the East Coast, the Wairarapa Plain in the Wellington District, and a strip of country along the West CoasD, about 250 miles in length, extending from a point about thirty miles from the City of Wellington to a little north of New Plymouth. The largest plain in the North Island, Kaingaroa, extends from the shore of Lake Taupo in a north-north-easterly direction to the sea-coast in the Bay of Plenty ; but a great part of it is covered with pumice- sand, and is unfitted for tillage or pasture. There are several smaller plains and numerous valleys suitable for agriculture. The level or undulating country in this island fit, or capable of being made fit, for agriculture has been roughly estimated at 13,000,000 acres. This includes lands now covered with standing forest, and swamps that can be drained ; also large areas of clay-marl and pumice-covered land. The clay-marl in its natural state is cold and uninviting to the farmer, but under proper drainage and culti- vation it can be brought to a high state of productiveness. This kind of land is generally neglected at the present time, as settlers prefer soils more rapidly renmnerative and less costly to work. The larger portion of the North Island was originally covered with forest. Although the area of bush-land is still very great, yet year by year the amount is being reduced, chiefly to meet the requirements of settlement, the trees being cut down and burnt, and grass-seed sown on the ashes to create pasture. Hilly as the country is, yet from the nature of the climate it is especially suited for the growth of English grasses, which will flourish wherever there is any soil, however steep the land may be ; once laid down in grass very little of the land is too })oor to supply food for cattle and sheep. The area of land in the North Island deemed purely pastoral or capable of being made so, while too steep for agricul- tural purposes, is estimated at 14,200,000 acres. In the centre of the island is a lake, about twenty miles across either way, called Taupo. A large area adjacent to the lake is at present worthless pumice-country. The Waikato Kiver, the largest in the North Island, flows out of the north-eastern corner of this lake, and runs thence north-westward until it enters the ocean a little distance south of the Manukau Harbour. This river is navigable for small steamers for about a hundred miles from its mouth. The Maori King-country, occupied by Natives who for several years isolated themselves from Europeans, lies between Lake Taupo and the western coast. The River Thames, or Waihou, having its sources north of Lake Taupo, flows northward into the Firth of Thames. It is navigable for about fifty miles, but only for small steamers. The other navigable rivers in this island are the Wairoa (Kaipara), FHTfilCAIi FBATUEES OF THE NORTH ISLAND. 9 tho Wangaiiui. and the Maiiawatu, the two last of which flow towanls the fi.outh-west into Cook Strait. The uiouiitains m the Noiili Ishuid are estimated to occupy about OMH-teiuh of the siirfiice, and do not exceed 4r,000rt- in height, with the exception of a few volcanic mountains that are more lofty. Of these, tlie three foUowinf; are the most important : — 1. The Tongariro Mountain, situated to the southward of Lake Taupo, It consisis of a group of distinct volcanic cones, the lava-stream?i from which have so overlapped in their descent as to form one compact mountain-mass at the base. The highest of these cones is called N'^auruhoe» and attains an elevation of 7.515ft. The craters of Nganruhoe, the Red Crater (6 J-lOft.), and Te Mari (4,990ft.) are the three vents from whjck the latest dischargees of lava have taken place, the most recent having occurred in 1868. These craters are still active, steam and vapour issuing from them with considerable force anil noise, the vapours* charged with pungent gases and acids, making it dangerous to approach too near the crater-lips. 2. Ruapehu. This mountain lies to the south of Ngauruhoo and Tongariro. It is a volcanic cone iu the solfatara stage, and reaches the height of 9,tK>8ft., being in part considerably above the hue of perpetual snow. The most remarkable teature of this mountain is the crater-lake on its summit, which is subject to slight and inter- mittent eruptions, giving rise to vast quantities of steam. Recently — in March, lH9o — such an eruption took place, forming a few hot springs on the margni of the lake, and increasing the heat in the lake itself. This lake lies at the bottom of a funnel -shaped crater, the 8teep sides of wliieh are mantled w ith ice and snow. The water occu- pies a circular bafein about 500ft. in diameter, some 300ft. below the enclosing peaks, and is quite inaccessible except by the use of ropes. This lake, and the three craters previously mentioned on Tongariro, are all in one stniight line, which, if profiuced, would pass througii the boihng b])iing8 at Tokaauu on the southern margin of Ltike Taapo, the volcanic country north-east of that lake, and White laland^ an active volcano m the Bay of Plenty » situated about twenty-seven nnles from the mainland. 3. Mount Eginont. This is an extinct volcanic cone, rising to a hcigiit of B, 260ft- The upper part is alw^ays covered with snow. This mountain is situated close to New Plymouth, and is surrounded by one of the most fertile districts in New Zealand. Rising from the plains in solitary grandeur, it is an object of extreme beauty, the cone being one of the most perfect in the world. It is estimated that the area of mountain-tops and barren COUDtry at too high an altitude for sheep, and therefore worthless lot pastoral purposes, amounts, in the North Island, to 300,000 acres. 'Without a doubt the hot sprmgs form the most remarkable feature of the North Island. They are found over a large area, ex- U^nding from Tongariro, soutli of Lake Taupo» to Ohaeawai, in the extreme north^ — a distance of some 300 miles ; but the principal seat 10 NfiJW ZEALAND OFFICIAL YEAK-BOOK. of hydrothermal action appears to be in the neighbourhood of Lake Rotorua, about forty miles north-north-east from Lake Taupo. By the destruction of the famed Pink and White Terraces and of Lake Rotomahana during the eruption of Mount Tarawera on the 10th June, 1886, the neighbourhood has been deprived of attractions unique in character and of unrivalled beauty ; but the natural features of the country — the numerous lakes, geysers, and hot springs, some of which possess remarkable curative properties in certain complaints — are still very attractive to tourists and invalids. The world-wide importance of conserving this region as a sanatoriuno for all time has been recognised by the Government, and it is now dedicated by Act of Parliament to that purpose. Notwithstanding the length of coast-line, good harbours in the North Island are not numerous. Those on the' west coast north of New Plymouth are bar-harbours, unsuitable for large vessels. The principal harbours are the Waitemata Harbour, on which Auckland is situated — this is rather a deep estuary than a harbour f several excellent havens in the northern peninsula ; and Port Nicholson, on the borders of which Welhngton is situated. This is a land- locked harbour, about six miles across, having a comparatively narrow but deep entrance from the ocean. The water is deep nearly throughout. The Cape Colville Peninsula is rich in gold-bearing quartz. Cook Strait. Cook Strait separates the North and Middle Islands. It is some sixteen miles across at its narrowest part, but in the widest about ninety. The strait is invaluable for the purpose of traffic between different parts of the colony. Physical Features of the Middle Island. The extreme length of the Middle Island, from Jackson's Head, in Cook Strait, to Puysegur Point, at the extreme south-west, is about 625 statute miles ; the greatest distance across at any point is in Otago (tlie soutliernmost) District, about 180 miles. The Middle Island is intersected along almost its entire length by a range of mouiitams known as the Southern Alps. Some of the summits reach a height of from 10,000ft. to 12,000ft., Mount Cook, the highest peak, rising to 1 2,349ft. In tho soutli, in the neighbourhood of the sounds and Lake Te Anau, there are many magnificent peaks, which, though not of great height, are, owing to their latitude, nearly all crowned with perpetual ice and snow. Further north the mountains increase in height — Mount Earnslaw^ at Lake Wakatipu ; and Mount Aspiring, wliieh has been aptly termed the New Zealand Matterhorn, 9,949 ft. in height, at Lake Wanaka. Northward of this again are Mount Cook (or Aorangi), Mount Sefton, and other magnificent peaks! For beauty and grandeur of scenery the Southern .\\lps of New Zealand may worthily compare with, while in point of variety they are PHYBICAL FEATURRS OP THE MIDDLE ISLAND. 11 said actually to surpass, tho Alps of Switzerland. In New Zealand few of the mountains have been scaled ; many of the peaks and most of the glaciers are as yet unnamed ; and there is stilly in parts of the Middle Island, a tine field for exploration and discovery — geogra- phical, geological, and botanical. The wonders of the Southern Alps are only beginning to be known; hnt the more they are known the more they are appreciated. The snow-line in New Zealand being so much lower than in Switzerland, the scenery, though the moun- tains are not quite so higli, is of surpassing grandeur. There are extensive glaciers on both sides of the range, those on the west being of exceptional beauty, as, from the greater abrupt- ness of the mountain-slopes on that side, they descend to within about 700ft. of the sea-level, and into the midst of the evergreen forest. The largest glaciers on either side of the range are easily accessible. The following gives the sizes of some of the glaciers on the easterti slope : — Name.

It is in length and width inferior to the Tasman Glacier. Numerous sounds or fiords penetrate the south- western coast. They are long, narrow, and deep (the depth of water at the appa part of Mdford Sound is 1,270ft., although at the entrance on I J 130ft.). surrounded by giant monntatns clothed with foliage to the\" snow-line, with waterfalls, glaciers, and snowfields at every turn. Some of the mountains rise almost precipitously from the water's edge to 5,000ft. and 6,00Oft. above the sea. Near Milford, the finest of these sounds, is the great Sutherland Waterfall* 1 ♦904ft. high. The general surface of the northern portion of the Middle Island, comprising the Provincial Districts of Nelson and Marlborough, is moutitainous, but the greater part is suitable for grazing purposes. There are some fine valleys and small plains suitable for agriculture^ of which the Wairau Valley or Plain is the largest. Deep sounds, extending for many miles, break the coast-line abutting on Cook Strait. The City of Nelson is situated at the head of Blind Bay, which has a depth inwards from Cook Strait of about forty statute miles, Tho Provincial District of Canterbury lies to the south of the Marlborough District, and on the eastern side of the island. To* I wards the tiorth the land is undulating ; then there is a stretch of almost perfectly level country extending towards the souih-west 160 jniles, after which » on the south, the country is undulating as far as the borders of the Otago Distiiet. On the east a block of hill'country rises abnijuly from the plain and extends for sotne miles seaward. This is Banks Peninsula, containing several good harbours, the principal licing Port Cooper, on the north, on which is situated Lyttt^lton, the cliief port of the district: the harbour of Akaroa, one of the finest in the colony, is on the southern coast of this peninsula. The District of Otago is, on tlie whole^ mountainous, but has many fine plains and valleys suitable for tillage. The mountains, except towards the west coast, are generally destitute of timber, and suitable for grazing sheep. There are goldfields of considerable extent in the interior of this district. The inland lakes are also very remarkable features. Lake Wakatipu extends over tifty-four miles in length, but its greatest width is not more than four miles, and its area only 114 square miles. It is 1,070ft, above sea-level, and has a depth varying from 1,170ft. to 1,296ft. Te Anau Lake is somewhat larger, having an area of 132 st^uare miles. These lakes are bounded on the west by broken, mountduous, and wood^ country, extending to the ocean. The cliief harbours in Otago are Port Chalmers, at the head of which Dunedin is situated^ and the Bluff Harbour, at the extreme south. The District of Westland, extending along the west coast of the Middle Island » abreast of Canterbury, is more or less auriferous throughout. Tfie western slopes of the central range of mountains are clothed with forost-trees to the snow-line; but on the eastero side timber is scarce, natural grasses covering the ground. The rivers in the Middle Island are for the most part mountain torrents, fed by glaciers in the principal mountain ranges. When the snow melts they rise in flood, forming, where not con6ned by rocky walls, beds of considerable width, generally covered by enor- mous deposits of shingle. The largest river in the colony as regards volun^e of water is the Clutha* It is 154 miles in length, hut is only navigable for boats or small rivcr^steamers for about thirty miles. The Eivei-s Duller, Grey, and Ilokitika, on the West Coast, are navigable for a short distance from their mouths. They form the only ports in the Westland District. In then* unimproved state they admitted, owing to the bars at their mouths, none but vessels of Gmall draught ; but, in consequence of the importance of the Grey and BuUer Rivers as the sole ports available for the coal-export trade, large hta-bour- works have been un<ler taken, resulting in the deet>ening of the beds of these rivers, and giving a depth of from lyft, to 2Cft. of water on the bar. The area of level or undulating land in the Middle Island avail- able for agriculture is estnnated at about 15,000,000 acres. About 13,000,000 are suitable for pastoral purposes only, or may become ' k. THK OUTtrmO TSt*tTn>8. 19 so when cleared of forest and sown with grass-seed. The area of barren land and mouatam-tops is estimated at about 9,000,000 acres. Stewabt Island. Foveaux Strait separates the Middle from Stewart Island. This last island has an area of only ^25,390 acres. Stewart Island is a great fcounst resort during the summer montns* and is easily reached by steamer from the Bluff, distant about 25 miles. The principal peak is Mount An glem, 3.200 ft» above sea-level, which ha*^ an extiact crater at its summit. Most of the island is ragged and forest-clad; the climate is mild, frost being seldom ex- perienced ; and the soil, wlien cleared of bush, is fertile, Tiie chief attractions are the numerous bays and fiords, Paterson Inlet is a maginticent sheet of water, about ten miles by four miles, situated close to Htilf-moon Bay, the principal port, where over two hundred people live. Horse- shoo Bay and Port Willmm are within easy reach of Half-moon Bay. Port Pegasus, a land-locked sheet of water about eight miles by a mile and a h*Uf, is a very fine harbour. At '* The Nock \" (Pateisou Inlet) there is a Nativti settle- ment o£ over a hundred Mttoris and lialf-castes. The bush is generally very dense, with thick underj:;iowth. Hata, black-pine, white-pine, niiro, and totara are the principal timber trees. Fish are to be had in great abundance and variety ; oysters form an important industry. Wild pigeons, ducks, and mutton-birds are plentiful The OuTLYii^G Islands. The ou*Jying group of the Chatham Islands, 480 statute mile& east-south-east from Wellington, and 536 miles eastwrtrd of Lyt- tclton, consists of two principal islands and several unimportant ishfts. The largest island contains about 22:3, 490 acres, of which an irres; alar- sli aped lake or la^^oon absorbs 45,960 acres. About on© quarter of thi surface of th*? land is covered with fot'est, the rest with fern or grass. The hills nowhere rise to a great heii^ht. Pitt Island ia the next in size ; the area is 15.330 acres* The greater portion of both islan<ls is used for gra;5ing sheep. The Kenaadec group of islands, four in number, is situated between 20*\" 10' and 3F 80' south latitudH, and between 177'^ 45' jind 179*- west longitude. They are named Raoul or Sunday Islandi Macaulay Island, Curtis Island, and L'Esperance or French Rock. The principal island^ Sunday, is GOO miles distant from Auckland* The islands are volcanic, and in two of them signs of activity are utill to bo seen. The rainfall is plentiful, but not excessive. The climate is mild and equable, and slightly warmer than the north of New Zealand. The following are the areas of the islands and islets of the group : Sunday Island, 7,200 acres; Herald group of islets, 85 acres; Macaulay Island, 764 acres; Curtis Islands, 12H acres and 19 acres; L*Esperance, 12 acres: total, 8,208 acres. Sunday island is twenty miles in circumference, roughly triangular NBW ZEALAND OFFIOTAL VRAKBOOK. I I in shape. a,nd at the highest point 1,723ft. above the sea-level. It is rugged aud brokeii over a very large exteut of its surface, aud, except in a few places, covered with forest. The soil everywhere on the island is very rich, being formed by the decomposition of a dark-coloured pumiceous tuff r.nd a black andesitic lava, with wldch is closely mixed a fine vegetable mould. The great luxuriance and richness of the vegetation bear witness to the excellence of the Boih which is every where —except where destroyed by eruptions, and on the steep cliifs — the same rich loam. Want of water is one of the drawbacks. Three of the four lakes on tlie island are fresh, but so difficult of approach as to be practically useless. The Auckland Islands are about 290 miles south of Bluff Har* hour, their position being given on the Adudralty chart as latitude 50\" 31' 29' S,, and longitude* 166'^ 19^ 12\" E. They have several good harbours. Port Ross, at the north end of the principal island, was described by the eminent French commander, l^'Urville^ as one of the best harbours of refuge in the known world. At the southerji end of the island there is a through passage extending from the east to the west coast. It has been variously named Adam's Strait and Cai'nley Harbour, and forms a splendid sheet of water. The largest of the islands is about 27 miles long by about 15 miles broatl, and is very mountainous, the highest part being about 2,0CH)ft. above the sea. The west coast is bold and pre- cipitous, but the east coast has several inlets* The wood on the island is, owmg to the strong prevailing wind, scrubby in charac- ter. The New Zealand Government maintains at this island a depot of provisions and clothing for the use of shipwrecked mariners. The Cook Islands, with others recently annexed, have been specially refen-ed to* CONSTITLTTION. British sovereignty was proclaimed over New Zealand iuJanuary» 1840» and the country became a dependency of New South Wales until tlie 3rd May, 1841, wlien it was made a separate colony. The seat of Government was at Auckland, and the Executive included the Governor, and three gentlemen holding office as Colonial Secre- tary, Attorney General, and Colonial Treasurer. The successors of these gentlemen, appointed in August, 1841, May, 1842, and January, 1844» respectively, continued in office until the estabhshment of Responsible Government on the 7th May, 1856. Only one of them—Mr. Swainson, the Attorney-General — ^sat as a member of the first General Assembly, opened on the 27th May, 1B54, During the session of that year there were associated with the permanent members of the Executive Council certain members of the General Assembly. These latter hold no portfolios. The Government of the colony was at first vested in the Governor, who was responsible only to the Crowii ; but in 1862 an Act granting representative institutions to the colony waa passed by the Imperial Legislature, Under it the constitution of A General Assembly for the whole colony was provided for, to QOVKHNfiffENT, consist of a Legislative Council, the nienibers of which were to be nominated by the Governor, and of an elective House of Eepresenta- tives. The first session of the General Assembly was opened on the 27th May, 1B54, but the members of the Executive were not respon- sible to Parliament. The first Ministers under a system of Respon- sible Government were appointed on the ISth April, 1856. By the Act of 1852 the colony was divided iuto six provinces, each to be presided over by an elective Superintendent, and to have an elective Pfovincial Ck)uncil, empowered to legislate, except on certain specified subjects. The franchise amounted practically to househokl suffrage. In each casL' the election was for four years, but a dissolution of the Provincial Council by the Governor could take place at any time, necessitating a fresh election botli of the Council and of the Superin- tendent, The Superintendent was chosen by the whole body of electors o! the province; each member of the Provincial Council by the electors of a district. The Provincial Governments, after- wards increased to nine, remained as integral parts of the Con- stitution of the colony until the 1st November. 1876, when they were abolished by an Act of the General Assembly, that body having been vested with the power of altering the Constitution Act. On the same day an Act of the General Assembly which subdivided tht* esolony (exclusive of the areas included within m uuici pal i ties) into «;oiintie3, and established a system of local county government, camt into force. Government. The Governor is appointed by the Kin^. His salary is £5,000 a year, with an annual allowance of £1,500 on account of his esta- tjtblishment, and of £500 for travelling-expenses, provided by the colony. Members of the Legislative Council hold their seats under writs of summons from the Governor. Till the year 1891 the appoint- ments were for life ; but in September of that year an Act was passed making appointments after that time tenable for seven years only, though Councillors may be reappointed. In either case seats may be vacated by resignation or extended absence. Two members of the Council are aboriginal native chiefs. The members of the House of Representatives are elected for three years from the time of each gtnieral election ; but at any time a dissolution of Parliament by the Governor may render a general Section necessary. Four of the members are representatives of Native cunstituencies. An Act was passed in 1B87 which provided that, on tlie dissolution of the then General Assembly, the number of members to be thereafter elected to the House of Repre- sentatives should be seventy-four in all, of whom four were to be elected, under the provisions of the Maori Representation Acts, as representatives of Maori electors only. For the purposes of Euro- pean representation the colony is divided into sixty -two electoral districts, four of which — the Cities of Auckland, Wellington, Christ- church, and Dunedin^ — return each three members, itnd all the other 16 NEW ZBALAND OKFlCIAli YKAK-BOOK. electorates one each. ^ Members of the House of Represent at irea are chosen by the votes of the inhal>itants in every electoral districi appointed for that purpose. By \"Tlie Meinh«^rs of the House of Representatives Disquihlicilion .\\et., 1807,\" no person, who, bein^ a bankrupt within tlie nu'aninj: of *' The Bankruptcy Act, 1892,\" has not obtained an ordeT of ihsohar^t*. mi'ler that Act shall be qualified to be nominated as a candidiitt* for t'hu'iion, or to be electeil, or to take his seat as a nienii>er of the IU)useof Representatives, anything in **Tho Electoral Act, IHlKi,\" or any other Act to the contrary not- withstanding. In 1889 an amendment of tlie Representation Act was passed^ which contained a provision prohibiting any el<ictor from giving his vote in respect of more than one electorate at any election. \" The Electoral Act, 1893,\" extended to women of botli races the right to register as electors, and to vole at the elections for members of the House of Representatives. The qualilication for registration is the same for both sexes. No person is entitled to be registered on more than one electoral roll within the colony. Women are not qualified to be elected as mend)ers of the House of Representatives. The electoral laws are the subject of special comment further on in this work. Every man registered as an elector, and not coming within the meaning of section 8 of \"Tiie Electoral Act, 1893,\" {i.e., alien, lunatic, public otTender. defaulter, <<:c.), is qualified to be elected a member of the House of Representatives for any- electoral district. For European representation every adult per- son, if resident one year in the colony and three months in one electoral district, can be registered as an elector. Frt.'eliold property of the value of £25 held for six months preceding the day of regis- tration until 1896 entitled a man or woman to register, if not already registered under the residential qualification. Jku the Amendment Act of 1896 abolished the property qualilicatii>n (except in case of existing registrations), and n^sidence alone now entitles a man or woman to have his or her name placed upon an electoral roll . For Maori representation every adult Maori resident in any Maori elec- toral district (of which there are four only in the colony) can vote. Registration is not required in Native districts. TiiK Skat of Govehnment. Up to the year I860 the seat of Government of New Zealand was at Auckland. Several attempts were made by members of Parliament, by motions in the Legislative Council and House of Representatives, to have it remove<l to some more central place; but it was not until November, 1803. that Mr. Domett (the then ex-Premier) was successful in carrying resolutions in the House of • \" Th« Kcpic-entation Act, 19tX),** provides that, on the expration by eflluxion of tiino or other boomit .ict.;rminaiion of the present Graneral A semhly, tlie mimhiT t.f membcr-t forpurpoa-H of European Mpresenlation to be ihcroafiec eleolod to the Hoimo of K.;pfeM«ntAtive8 shall be seven tv-six in- toad of t-evemy^ «nd that there aro to be bix now didtrtct«, one for eaoh additional member.

(3.) That, with this view, a Bill should be introduced to give effect to the above resolu- tion b/* On the 25th November an address was presented to the Governor, Sir Qeorge Grey, K,C.B., by the Commons of New Zea- land, requesting that the Governors of the Colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania, might each be asked to appoint one Commissioner for the purpose of determining the best site in Cook Strait. Accordingly, the Hon. Joseph Docker, M.L.C., New South Wales; the Hon. Sir Francis Murphy, Speaker of the Legislative Council, Victoria; and B. C. Gunn, Esq., Tasmania, were appointed Commissioners. These gentlemen, having made a personal inspection of all suit- able places, arrived at the unanimous decision ** that Wellington, in Port Nicholson, was the site upon the shores of Cook Strait which presented the greatest advantages for the administration of the government of the colony/* The seat of Government was, therefore, in accordance with the recommendation of the Commissioners, removed to Wellington in February, 1865. Public Wokks. Nearly all the public works of New Zealand are in the hands of the Government of the colony, and in the early days they simply kept pace with the spread of settlement. In 1870, however, a great impetus was given to the progress of the whole country by the inauguration of the ** Public Works and Immigration Pohcy,\" which provided for caixying out works in advance of settlement. Railways^ roads, and water-races were constructed* and immigration was con- ducted on a large scale. As a consequence, the population increased from 267,0<J0 in 1871 to 501.000 in 1881, and to 772.455 in March, 1901, exclusive of Maoris. SUCGESSn^E GOVERNORS.
